(collectively, “Plaintiffs”)
 
RESPONDING PARTY: None
 
            The Court has considered the moving papers.
 The motion is unopposed.  Any opposition was required to have been
filed and served at least nine court days prior to the hearing.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1005, subd. (b).)  
 
BACKGROUND
            This action arises from the alleged
breach of a lease agreement concerning a residential real property located at 1318
North Mansfield Avenue, #307, Los Angeles, California 90028 (the “Premises”).  On April 12, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a complaint
for Damages for Breach of Written Lease (the “Complaint”) against Defendant Diana
Pal (“Defendant”) and DOES 1 through 20, inclusive, alleging a sole cause of
action for Breach of Lease.  
 
The
Complaint alleges the following: on or about February 22, 2021, Plaintiffs’
predecessor-in-interest, as landlord, entered into a written rental agreement
(the “Lease”) with Defendant, as tenant, concerning the Premises.  (Complaint, ¶ 7.)  Pursuant to Paragraph 6 of the Lease,
Defendant is obligated to pay a monthly base rent of $1,750.00, plus additional
charges due under the Lease.  (Complaint,
¶ 9.)  Plaintiff alleges that in or about
October 2021 and continuing thereafter, Defendant breached the Lease, by, among
other things, failing to pay rent and other charges due under the Lease.
(Complaint, ¶ 11.)   
 
On
May 10, 2023, Defendant filed an Answer—Unlawful Detainer to the
Complaint.   
 
On
March 7, 2024, Plaintiffs filed and served the instant Motion for Summary
Judgment (the “Motion”).  No opposition
to the Motion has been filed.
 
DISCUSSION
Legal Standard
The function of a motion for summary judgment or
adjudication is to allow a determination as to whether an opposing party cannot
show evidentiary support for a pleading or claim and to enable an order of
summary dismissal without the need for trial.  (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co.
(2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.)  Code Civ.
Proc. § 437c(c) “requires the trial judge to grant summary judgment if all the
evidence submitted, and all inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence
and uncontradicted by other inferences or evidence, show that there is no
triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to
judgment as a matter of law.”  (Adler
v. Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.)  “The function of the pleadings in a motion for
summary judgment is to delimit the scope of the issues; the function of the
affidavits or declarations is to disclose whether there is any triable issue of
fact within the issues delimited by the pleadings.”  (Juge v. County of Sacramento (1993) 12
Cal.App.4th 59, 67.) 
 
“On a motion for summary judgment, the initial
burden is always on the moving party to make a prima facie showing that there
are no triable issues of material fact.”  (Scalf v. D.B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005)
128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1519.)  “A
plaintiff . . . has met his or her burden of showing there is no defense to a
cause of action if that party has proved each element of the cause of action
entitling the party to judgment on that cause of action.”  (Troyk v. Farmers Group, Inc. (2009)
171 Cal.App.4th 1305, 1320.)  A plaintiff
is not required “to disprove any defense asserted by the defendant as well as
prove each element of his own cause of action.” (WRI Opportunity Loans II,
LLC v. Cooper (2007) 154 Cal.App.4th 525, 531-32.)  “Once the plaintiff makes an adequate initial
showing, the burden shifts to the defendant to show a triable issue of fact as
to that cause of action or a defense thereto.”  (Id. at p. 532; CCP § 437c(p)(1).)  
 
“There is a triable issue of material fact if, and
only if, the evidence would allow a reasonable trier of fact to find the
underlying fact in favor of the party opposing the motion in accordance with
the applicable standard of proof.”  (Aguilar,
25 Cal.4th at 850.)  The defendant “shall
not rely upon the¿allegations or denials of its pleadings to show that a
triable issue of material fact exists but, instead, shall set forth the
specific facts showing that a triable issue of material fact exists as
to¿the¿cause of action or a defense thereto.” 
(CCP § 437c(p)(1).) 
 
Analysis 
“The standard elements of a claim for breach of
contract are: ‘(1) the contract, (2) plaintiff’s performance or excuse for
nonperformance, (3) defendant’s breach, and (4) damage to plaintiff
therefrom.’” (Wall Street Network, Ltd. v. New York Times Co. (2008) 164
Cal.App.4th 1171, 1178; San Mateo Union High School Dist. v. County of San
Mateo (2013) 213 Cal.App.4th 418, 439.) 

 
Plaintiffs present the following undisputed material
facts: on or about February 22, 2021, Plaintiffs’ predecessor-in-interest, as landlord,
and Defendant, as Tenant, entered into the Lease for the Premises.  Plaintiffs are the current owner of the
Premises and the lessor under the Lease. (UMF No. 1.)  Pursuant to Paragraph 6 of the Lease,
Defendant was and is currently obligated to pay a monthly base rent of $1,750.00
and Defendant is also responsible for paying all utilities except electricity
pursuant to Paragraph 7 of the Lease.  (UMF No. 2.)  Plaintiffs have performed all conditions of
the Lease required of it except those conditions in which Plaintiffs’
nonperformance thereof was excused or justified.  (UMF No. 3.)  Defendant’s failure to pay, among other
things, the rent due under the Lease has excused Plaintiffs from any other
obligations under the Lease.  (Id.)
 In or about September 2021 and
continuing thereafter, Defendant breached the Lease by, among other things,
failing to pay rent and other charges due under the Lease.  (UMF No. 4.) The total billed unpaid rental
damages—base rent and utilities—through May 31, 2023 is $29,982.03.  (UMF No. 5.) 

 
            The Court finds that
there are no factual issues regarding Plaintiffs’ claims.  Plaintiffs have established the existence of
a lease agreement between the parties.  (Declaration of Violeta Vitkova in Support of
Motion for Summary Judgment, ¶ 3; Exh. A.)  Plaintiffs have also submitted sufficient
evidence to establish Defendant’s breach of the agreement with respect to the
failure to pay rent.  (Id.; Exh.
B.)  
 
Plaintiffs have met their burden of showing the
existence of each element for the cause of action for breach of lease.  The burden now shifts to Defendant to show a
triable issue of material fact.  Defendant,
on the other hand, has presented no evidence to controvert the facts as
presented by Plaintiffs.  The Court notes
that while Defendant, in her answer, raised defenses applicable to unlawful
detainer actions, this is not an action for unlawful detainer/eviction but for
breach of lease due to nonpayment of rent.
 
Given that the Motion is unopposed, Defendant has
not met her burden of showing a triable issue of material fact.  Moreover, because Defendant has failed to
oppose the Motion, Defendant has conceded to the arguments raised therein, as
“[c]ontentions are waived when a party fails to support them with reasoned
argument and citations to authority.” (Moulton Niguel Water Dist. v. Colombo
(2003) 111 Cal.App.4th 1210, 1215.)
