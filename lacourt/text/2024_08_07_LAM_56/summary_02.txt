And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motions to withdraw as counsel filed by Steffanie Stelnick, representing RVCC Intersect, LLC, Reserve Vault, LLC, Christopher L. Adams, and Nicolo James Rusconi. The motions are unopposed and cite "irreconcilable differences" as the reason for withdrawal. The court finds that the motions set forth an adequate basis for withdrawal and grants the motions. However, the court notes that Reserve Vault, LLC and RVCC Intersect, LLC must appear by counsel at trial, and therefore, will hold an OSC on August 28, 2024 to discuss their representation by counsel. The trial date is continued to November 5, 2024, and the final status conference is continued to October 21, 2024.
