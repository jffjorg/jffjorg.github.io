BACKGROUND 
On
August 15, 2019, Plaintiff Dambar Garung filed a complaint against Defendants Renu
Kayastha, Tilak Rana, Himalayan Hut, LLC and Does 1 through 10, inclusive,
alleging claims for: 1) fraud and deceit; 2) violations of Labor Code (“LC”)
section 98.6; 3) violation of LC section 1102.5; 4) violation of LA section
232.5; 5) wrongful termination; 6) failure to pay wages and/or overtime under
LC sections 510, 1194 and 1199; 7) failure to reimburse expenses pursuant to LC
section 2802; 8) violation of LC section 226(a); 9) waiting time penalties
under LC section 203; and 10) Unfair Business Practices under Business &
Professions Code Section 17200, et seq.. 
Although trial in this case, which was set for July 8, 2024, had been
taken off-calendar because on the eve of trial the parties informed the Court
that they had reached a settlement, it appears that the settlement may not be
completed, such that the Court must set another trial date, and will do so at
the hearing on this motion.  The last
date for this case to be brought to trial is February 14, 2025.
 
On
June 26, 2024, Counsel filed the instant motion to be relieved as counsel for
Defendants. No opposition has been filed.
 
 
DISCUSSION
The court may order that an attorney be
changed or substituted at any time before or after judgment or final
determination upon request by either client or attorney and after notice from
one to the other. (Code Civ. Proc. § 284, subd. (2).) “The determination
whether to grant or deny a motion to withdraw as counsel lies within the sound
discretion of the trial court.” (Manfredi & Levine v. Superior
Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128, 1133.) An application to be relieved as
counsel must be made on Judicial Counsel Forms MC-051 (Notice of Motion and
Motion), MC-052 (Declaration), and MC-053 (Proposed Order). (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1362, subds. (a), (c), (e).) 
 
In addition, California Rules of Court,
rule 3.1362 subsection (d) requires that the notice of motion and motion,
declaration, and proposed order be served on the client and all other parties
who have appeared in the case by personal service, electronic service, or mail.
If the notice is served by mail, it must be accompanied by a declaration
stating facts showing that either: 
(A) The
service address is the current residence or business address of the client; or 
(B) The
service address is the last known residence or business address of the client,
and the attorney has been unable to locate a more current address after making
reasonable efforts to do so within 30 days before the filing of the motion to
be relieved. 
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, subd. (1)(A) & (2).)  
 
Under Code of Civil Procedure section
1014, “A defendant appears in an action when the defendant answers, demurs,
files a notice of motion to strike, files a notice of motion to transfer
pursuant to Section 396(b), moves for reclassification pursuant to Section
403.040, gives the plaintiff written notice of appearance, or when an attorney
gives notice of appearance for the defendant. After appearance, a defendant or
the defendant's attorney is entitled to notice of all subsequent proceedings of
which notice is required to be given. Where a defendant has not appeared,
service of notice or papers need not be made upon the defendant.”
 
Analysis
Although Counsel filed a noticed Motion and Motion to be relieved
as counsel, he was required to file but did not file the proper form for making
such a motion (MC-051). Counsel also failed to file the proper form of a
Declaration in Support of the Motions (MC-052).
 


 
On July 15, 2024, the Court ordered that Counsel file forms MC-051
and MC-052 as a prerequisite to the granting of the Motion.  Counsel failed to do so, and for that reason,
the Court denies the Motion. 
Dated this 7th day of August 2024
