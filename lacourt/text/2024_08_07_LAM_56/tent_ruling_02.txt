  CASE NO.:  19STCV45806
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER RE: 
MOTIONS TO BE RELIEVED AS COUNSEL
 
Date: August 7, 2024
Time: 8:30 a.m.
Dept. 56
 
 



 
BACKGROUND
             This action arises out of a dispute over money
that Defendants RVCC Intersect, LLC (“RVCC”), Reserve Vault, LLC (“Reserve”),
Christopher L. Adams (“Adams”) and Nicolo James Rusconi (“Rusconi”)
(collectively, “Defendants”) allegedly owed to Plaintiff Mal Bien Bar, LLC under
a promissory note.  The currently
operative first amended complaint alleges: (1) breach of promissory note; (2)
breach of oral contract; and (3) conversion.
 
Counsel
for Defendants, Steffanie Stelnick (“Stelnick”), is seeking to withdraw as
counsel for all four Defendants, namely Rusconi, Adams, RVCC and Reserve, .and
has filed four motions to be relieved as counsel (collectively, the “Motions”)
on July 10, 2024.  The Motions are
compliant with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362.  The Motions are unopposed.  Trial is currently set for August 26, 2024
DISCUSSION
The court has discretion on whether to allow an
attorney to withdraw, and a motion to withdraw will not be granted where
withdrawal would prejudice the client. (Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21
Cal.App.4th 904, 915.)  Withdrawal is
generally permitted unless there is a compelling reason to continue the
representation.  (Heple v. Kluge
(1951) 104 Cal.App.2d 461, 462.)  
 
In connection with the Motions, Stelnick cites “irreconcilable
differences” as ground for the Motions and declares that “the attorney-client
relationship is broken” and counsel is “unable to make any settlement offers,
accept any settlements, or adequately prepare for trial.”  
 
The Court finds that the Motions set forth an
adequate basis for withdrawal.  The Court,
therefore, GRANTS the Motions.  The Court
notes that while Adams and Rusconi can appear in propria persona, Reserve
and RVCC must appear by counsel and cannot defend themselves at trial without
being represented by counsel.  The Court
will therefore hold an OSC regarding Defendants Reserve’s and RVCC’s
representation by counsel on August 28, 2024 at 8:30 a.m. in this Department.         
 
In order for the individual Defendants either to
prepare for trial or hire new counsel, and for Reserve and RVCC to retain new
counsel and for all Defendants and counsel to prepare for trial, the Court, on
its own motion, advances to this date and CONTINUES the trial to November 5,
2024, at 9:30 a.m  The Final Status
Conference is advanced to this date and CONTINUED to October 21, 2024, at 8:30 a.m.
 All Pretrial dates remain as set under
the August 26, 2024 trial date.
 
Moving
Party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.            
 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed
by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive an email
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off
calendar.
 
Dated this 7th day of August, 2024
