STATEMENT OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS: 
 
On February 27, 2023, Plaintiff John Bernard Carlin
(Plaintiff) filed a Complaint against Defendants Stephen Copen, Stephen Copen
Trustee of the Stephen Copen 2012 Irrevocable Trust, and City of Los Angeles
with nine causes of action for: (1) Breach of Contract, (2) Harassment, (3)
Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress, (4) Negligent Infliction of
Emotional Distress, (5) Gross Negligence, (6) Negligence Per Se, (7)
Retaliatory Eviction, (8) Breach of the Implied Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment,
and (9) Nuisance. 
 
On May 2, 2023, Defendants Stephen Copen and Stephen Copen
Trustee of the Stephen Copen 2012 Irrevocable Trust (Copen Defendants) filed a
Demurrer and Motion to Strike.
 
On July 12, 2023, Defendant City of Los Angeles filed an
Answer and a Cross-Complaint.
 
On August 16, 2023, Plaintiff filed a First Amended
Complaint (FAC) with six causes of action for: (1) Breach of Contract, (2)
Tenant Harassment, (3) Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress; (4)
Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress; (5) Negligence; and (6) Nuisance. 
 
According to the FAC, the dispute concerns property located
at 809 Toulen Drive, Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles County, California (the Property).
Plaintiff alleges to have entered a one-year lease of the Property with
Defendant Copen on December 6, 2019 that would commence around February 1, 2020
and expire on January 31, 2021 with monthly rent at $7,500.00. The parties
amended the lease around August 10, 2020 extending the term to July 30, 2023.
Plaintiff paid Defendant Copen $94,000.00 via wire transfer on August 11, 2022.
Plaintiff alleges that during the tenancy, he observed rot and mold growing on
tile on the Property, lack of chimney cap, requested copies of lead and
asbestos reports, and a severe sewage spill around October 22, 2022. Plaintiff
further alleges that Defendant Copen prevented remediation companies Plaintiff
hired from entering the Property. As to Defendant City of Los Angeles,
Plaintiff alleges that they were responsible for the severe sewage spill and
failed to reimburse Plaintiff for damage because he was not the Property owner.
Finally, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant Copen sought ways to unlawfully terminate
Plaintiff’s right to possession. Plaintiff vacated the Property on July 31,
2023.
 
On September 19, 2023, Copen Defendants filed a Demurrer and
Motion to Strike which the court SUSTAINED with leave to amend and DENIED as
moot.
 
On December 22, 2023, Plaintiff filed a Second Amended
Complaint (SAC) with six causes of action for: (1) Breach of Contract, (2)
Tenant Harassment, (3) Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress, (4)
Negligence, (5) Nuisance, and (6) Failure to Account for an Return Security
Deposit.
 
On January 23, 2024, Defendants filed a Demurrer with Motion
to Strike. 
 
On March 19, 2024, the court SUSTAINED the Demurrer as the
Third, Fourth, and Sixth Causes of Action, OVERRULED the Demurrer as to the
Second and Fifth Causes of Action, and GRANTED the Motion to Strike.
 
On April 15, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant Motion for
Leave to Amend the Complaint. On May 16, 2024, Defendants filed an Opposition. On
June 18, 2024, Plaintiff filed a reply. 
 
LEGAL STANDARD: 
 
California Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) section 473,
subdivision (a)(1) provides, in relevant part: “The court may, in furtherance
of justice, and on any terms as may be proper, allow a party to amend any pleading
or proceeding by adding or striking out the name of any party, or by correcting
a mistake in the name of a party, or a mistake in any other respect; and may,
upon like terms, enlarge the time for answer or demurrer.¿ The court may
likewise, in its discretion, after notice to the adverse party, allow, upon any
terms as may be just, an amendment to any pleading or proceeding in other
particulars; and may upon like terms allow an answer to be made after the time
limited by this code.”¿¿¿ 
¿¿ 
“This discretion should be exercised liberally in favor of
amendments, for judicial policy favors resolution of all disputed matters in
the same lawsuit.”¿ (Kittredge Sports Co.
v. Superior Court¿(1989) 213 Cal.App.3d 1045, 1047.)¿ Ordinarily, the court
will not consider the validity of the proposed amended pleading in ruling on a
motion for leave since grounds for a demurrer or motion to strike are
premature.¿ The court, however, does have discretion to deny leave to amend
where a proposed amendment fails to state a valid cause of action as a matter
of law and the defect cannot be cured by further amendment.¿ (See¿California Casualty General Ins. Co. v.
Superior Court¿(1985) 173 Cal.App.3d 274, 281 (overruled on other grounds
by¿Kransco¿v. American Empire Surplus
Lines Ins. Co.¿(2000) 23 Cal.4th 390).)¿¿¿ 
¿¿ 
Under California Rules of Court Rule (CRC), rule 3.1324,
subdivision (a), a motion to amend a pleading shall (1) include a copy of the
proposed amendment or amended pleading, which must be serially numbered to
differentiate it from previous pleadings or amendments; (2) state what
allegations in the previous pleading are proposed to be deleted, if any, and
where, by page, paragraph and line number, the deleted allegations are located;
and (3) state what allegations are proposed to be added to the previous pleading,
if any, and where, by page, paragraph, and line number, the additional
allegations are located.¿¿  
¿¿ 
Under California Rules of Court (CRC), rule 3.1324,
subdivision (b), a separate declaration must accompany the motion and must
specify (1) the effect of the amendment; (2) why the amendment is necessary and
proper; (3) when the facts giving rise to the amended allegations were
discovered; and (4) the reasons why the request for amendment was not made
earlier.¿¿¿ 
 
ANALYSIS: 
 
Plaintiff contends leave to amend to add the proposed Sixth
Cause of Action is warranted because it had not accrued when he filed the FAC
and that he waited a reasonable amount of time from when he vacated the
property before attempting to add it to his SAC. Plaintiff also contends the
amendment will not prejudice Defendants and would serve judicial economy to
include it in the pending lawsuit as it relates to the remaining claims at
issue. The Copen Defendants argue in opposition that Plaintiff attempts to add
allegations even though the case is about a sewer spill and Plaintiff’s failure
to obtain insurance for his personal property.[1]

 
Here, leave to amend is warranted. First, Plaintiff complied
with the requirements of CRC, rule 3.1324(b). Second, to the extent the
proposed Sixth Cause of Action is invalid, Defendants would have an opportunity
to attack it after amendment. (See Atkinson
v. Elk Corp. (2003) 109 Cal.App.4th 739, 760.) Finally, the Copen
Defendants have not otherwise indicated prejudice should the court allow the
amendment and the court sees none. 
 
Accordingly, the court GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion for leave
to amend.[2]
 
 
 
CONCLUSION:
 
            For
the foregoing reasons, the Court decides the pending motion as follows: 
 
1.      Motion
for Leave to Amend is GRANTED;
2.      The
Proposed Fourth Amended Complaint is deemed filed this date.
Moving party is to give notice. 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
