```

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the plaintiff's motion for leave to amend the complaint to add a new cause of action for Failure to Account for Return Security Deposit. The court finds that the amendment is warranted because it is a reasonable amount of time after the plaintiff vacated the property, and the amendment will not prejudice the defendants. The court also notes that the proposed amendment complies with the requirements of California Rules of Court Rule 3.1324. The court grants the motion for leave to amend and deems the proposed fourth amended complaint filed.
