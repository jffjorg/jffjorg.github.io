And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion for trial preference due to her age and health. The plaintiff, Virginia B. Adams, is 86 years old and was diagnosed with malignant pleural mesothelioma in 2022. She experiences fatigue, body pain, coughing, and shortness of breath, and requires the use of an oxygen tank. The judge finds that Adams has a substantial interest in the action and that her health and age make it necessary to grant her preference to prevent prejudicing her interest in the litigation. The motion is granted, and trial is set for January 22, 2024.
