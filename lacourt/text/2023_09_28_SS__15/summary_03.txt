And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has considered the motions and responses in this case and has tentatively ruled on the motion to quash service of summons. The Plaintiff, Maria Lozano, alleges that she was injured as a result of asbestos exposure from the Defendant, Charles B. Chrystal Company's products. The Defendant has moved to quash service of summons on the ground of lack of personal jurisdiction.

The Court has considered the arguments of both parties and has found that the Plaintiff has not yet established facts justifying the exercise of jurisdiction over the Defendant. However, the Court has granted the Plaintiff's request for discovery on issues of specific jurisdiction regarding the Defendant's sales of talc to Revlon and Max Factor during the time period when the Plaintiff used those products in California.

The Court has also continued the hearing on the motion to January 3, 2024, at 9 a.m. and has allowed the parties to file supplemental briefs. The Court will reconsider the motion based on the new evidence and arguments presented at the hearing.
