**English Summary:**

In this case, Maria Lozano alleges she was injured due to asbestos exposure from products made by Charles B. Chrystal Company.  The Defendant has filed a motion to dismiss the case, arguing that the California court lacks jurisdiction over them.

The judge acknowledges that the Plaintiff initially bears the burden of proving that the court has jurisdiction over the Defendant.  The Plaintiff argues that the Defendant placed its products in the stream of commerce, which may be sufficient to establish jurisdiction.  The Defendant counters by stating that it never sold, shipped, or marketed its talc products in California.

The judge has granted the Plaintiff's request for further discovery to determine whether the Defendant sold talc to companies like Revlon and Max Factor, who sell products in California.  The judge has also continued the hearing on the motion to quash to January 3, 2024, to allow both parties to submit additional briefs based on the discovery findings.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses a motion to quash service of summons filed by the defendant, Charles B. Chrystal Company, alleging that the court lacks personal jurisdiction over the company. The plaintiff, Maria Lozano, alleges that she was injured as a result of asbestos exposure from the company's products. The judge finds that the plaintiff has the initial burden of demonstrating facts justifying the exercise of jurisdiction, and that the defendant has the burden to demonstrate that the exercise of jurisdiction would be unreasonable. The judge grants the request for discovery on issues of specific jurisdiction regarding the company's possible sales of talc to Revlon and Max Factor for products that would be shipped to or sold in California. The hearing on the motion is continued to January 3, 2024, and the parties are allowed to file supplemental briefs.
