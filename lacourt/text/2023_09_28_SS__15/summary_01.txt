And here is an English-language summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion for summary adjudication of the plaintiffs' claims that the defendant's products caused exposure to asbestos. The plaintiffs claimed that the defendant, Puget Sound Commerce Center, Inc., was liable for installing defective parts on a Navy ship. The defendant argued that maritime law does not provide for a strict liability cause of action against a contractor that constructs a Navy ship, citing the case of McIndoe v. Huntington Ingalls Inc. The judge agreed with the defendant, finding that the plaintiffs failed to demonstrate the existence of triable issues of fact and that the defendant had shown that the plaintiffs did not possess and could not reasonably obtain the needed evidence to prove their claims. The judge also rejected the plaintiffs' arguments that the case of Saratoga Fishing Co. v. J.M. Martinac & Co. supported their claims, finding that the case did not address the issue of liability for installing defective parts on a Navy ship.
