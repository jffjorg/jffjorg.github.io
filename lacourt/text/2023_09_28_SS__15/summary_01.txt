And here is an English-language summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion for summary adjudication of the plaintiffs' claims that the defendant's products caused exposure to asbestos. The plaintiffs claimed that the defendant, Puget Sound Commerce Center, Inc., was liable for installing defective parts on a Navy ship. The defendant argued that maritime law does not provide for a strict liability cause of action against a contractor that constructs a Navy ship, citing the case of McIndoe v. Huntington Ingalls Inc. The judge agreed with the defendant, finding that the plaintiffs failed to demonstrate the existence of triable issues of fact and that the defendant had shown that the plaintiffs did not possess and could not reasonably obtain the needed evidence to prove their claims. The judge also rejected the plaintiffs' arguments that the case of Saratoga Fishing Co. v. J.M. Martinac & Co. supported their claims, finding that the case did not address the issue of liability for installing defective parts on a Navy ship.

Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for summary adjudication filed by Puget Sound Commerce Center, Inc. (Defendant) against Polly Gastrom and Suzanne Nesbit (Plaintiffs). The Plaintiffs are seeking to establish a strict liability cause of action against the Defendant for alleged exposure to asbestos from its products. The Defendant argues that maritime law does not provide for a strict liability cause of action against a contractor that constructs a Navy ship, citing the case of McIndoe v. Huntington Ingalls Inc. (9th Cir. 2016) 817 F.3d 1170.

The judge has ruled in favor of the Defendant, granting the motion for summary adjudication. The judge found that the Defendant has conclusively negated the necessary element of the Plaintiffs' cause of action, and that the Plaintiffs do not possess, and cannot reasonably obtain, needed evidence to establish their claims. The judge also found that the Plaintiffs failed to distinguish McIndoe from this case, and that their arguments rely on the Restatement (Third) of Torts, which does not address maritime law or McIndoe.

The judge has ordered the Defendant to give notice of the ruling, and has set a hearing date for September 28, 2023.
