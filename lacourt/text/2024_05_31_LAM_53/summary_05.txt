And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling by the judge summarizes the dispute between the Plaintiff and the Defendant regarding the deadline for discovery. The Plaintiff filed two sets of moving papers, on March 18 and 20, 2024. The Plaintiff had requested an informal discovery conference on October 31, 2023, stating that they needed further responses to Form Interrogatories. The Defendant offered to extend the deadline to two weeks after the informal discovery conference, which would have been December 14, 2023. However, the Plaintiff did not attend the conference, and the court ordered the matter off-calendar. The judge is considering the dispute and will make a final decision at a future hearing.
