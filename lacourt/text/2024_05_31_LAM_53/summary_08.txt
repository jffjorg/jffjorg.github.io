And here is the summary in English:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge Robert B. Broadbelt III in a case involving Emilio Reyes (plaintiff) and Lorraine Ann Escobar (defendant). The plaintiff sought to impose terminating, issue, or evidence sanctions against the defendant, alleging that the defendant destroyed thousands of emails relevant to the case. The court finds that the plaintiff did not provide sufficient notice of the motion and therefore denies the motion. The court also finds that the plaintiff has not shown that the defendant destroyed evidence that had a substantial probability of damaging his ability to establish an essential element of his claim. The court denies both the plaintiff's and defendant's requests for sanctions.
