plaintiff’s request for court judgment by

MOVING PARTY:                 Plaintiff Chris Loomis            
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       n/a
Request for Court Judgment by Default 
Plaintiff Chris Loomis (“Plaintiff”) requests that the court enter
judgment by default against defendant Cristina Amado Loomis (“Defendant”) in
the total amount of $382,600.22, consisting of (1) $200,000 in damages, (2)
$100,000 in punitive damages, (3) $71,956.80 in interest, (4) $643.42 in costs,
and (5) $10,000 in attorney’s fees.  (CIV-100,
¶ 2; Loomis Decl., ¶¶ 47-48; Seanez Decl., ¶¶ 35-36, 39.)
The court notes various
defects in Plaintiff’s request for default judgment. 
First, the supporting
declarations of Plaintiff and his counsel request that the court enter default
judgment in an amount different than what is requested on the mandatory “Request
for Court Judgment” form (Judicial Council form CIV-100).  Specifically, Plaintiff and his counsel request
that the court enter default judgment “in the amount of $252,722.70[,]” consisting
of $200,000 in damages, $643.42 in costs, $11,430 in attorney’s fees, and
$40,649.28 in prejudgment interest. 
(Loomis Decl., ¶ 51; Seanez Decl., ¶ 40.)  However,
as set forth above, on the mandatory Request for Court Judgment Judicial
Council form, Plaintiff has requested that the court enter default in the total
amount of $382,600.22, consisting of, inter alia, $10,000 in attorney’s
fees (i.e., not $11,430), $71,956.80 in interest (i.e., not $40,649.28), and
$100,000 in punitive damages.  (Ibid.;
CIV-100, ¶ 2.)
Thus, Plaintiff’s request for
default judgment is inconsistent with his supporting declarations and is
therefore unclear. 
Second, Plaintiff has not (1)
made clear how he has calculated his requested damages in the amount of
$200,000, or (2) submitted sufficient evidence to prove up those damages. 
Specifically, Plaintiff has
not provided the court with calculations as to his damages for his lost/damaged
property, and instead has requested the general amount of $200,000 as
“representative of the total sum of damages [he has] suffered due to the
battery by Defendant, the resulting emotional distress, and the damages or
destruction to [his] property[.]” 
(Loomis Decl., ¶ 47.)  Thus,
Plaintiff has not provided the court with sufficient information to evaluate
his request for damages. 
Moreover, Plaintiff has not
presented sufficient evidence establishing the damages that he sustained as a
result of the loss or destruction of his property.  Plaintiff appears to have provided ranges of
the value of certain items, but not specific amounts.  (Loomis Decl., ¶¶ 36-37, 39, 40-42.)  While the court “may permit the use of
affidavits, in lieu of personal testimony, as to all or any part of the
evidence or proof required or permitted to be offered,” “[t]he facts stated in
the affidavit or affidavits shall be within the personal knowledge of the
affiant and shall be set forth with particularity . . . .”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 585, subd. (d) [emphasis
added].)  Plaintiff has not set forth the
value of his lost or damaged items and the damages that he has sustained with
particularity, as required.  Thus, the
court finds that Plaintiff’s declaration is insufficient to prove that he is
entitled to the damages requested.  (Kim
v. Westmoore Partners, Inc. (2011) 201 Cal.App.4th 267, 287 [“the plaintiff
must affirmatively establish his entitlement to the specific judgment
requested”], 288 [“‘Plaintiffs in a default judgment proceeding must prove they
are entitled to the damages claimed’”].) 
            Third,
Plaintiff (1) has requested that the court award interest in inconsistent
amounts (i.e., $40,649.28 in his supporting declarations and $71,956.80 in his
request for default judgment), as set forth above, and (2) has not set forth
interest calculations as required.  (Loomis
Decl., ¶ 51; Seanez Decl., ¶ 40; CIV-100, ¶ 2, subd. (c); Cal. Rules of Ct.,
rule 3.1800, subd. (a)(3).) 
Fourth, Plaintiff has not filed a request for dismissal of all parties
against whom judgment is not sought (i.e., Doe defendants 1-10) as required.  (Cal. Rules of Ct., rule 3.1800, subd.
(a)(7); FAC  ¶ 3.) 
Based on the defects set forth above, the court denies Plaintiff’s
request for court judgment by default against Defendant, without prejudice to
Plaintiff’s filing new default judgment papers that cure the defects set forth
in this ruling.
ORDER
            The court denies plaintiff Chris
Loomis’s request for court judgment by default, without prejudice to plaintiff
Chris Loomis’s filing new default judgment papers that cure the deficiencies
set forth in this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
