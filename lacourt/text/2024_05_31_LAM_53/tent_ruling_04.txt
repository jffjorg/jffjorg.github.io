plaintiff’s motion to compel further

MOVING PARTY:                 Plaintiff Kofoworola Folashade
Olatunde     
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Defendant Eyanu Health Services, LLC
Motion to Compel Further Responses to Form Interrogatories, Employment,
Set Two
The court
considered the moving papers filed on March 20, 2024,[1]
and the opposition and reply papers filed in connection with this motion. 
DISCUSSION
Plaintiff Kofoworola Folashade Olatunde (“Plaintiff”) moves the court
for an order          (1) compelling
defendant Eyanu Health Services, LLC (“Defendant”) to serve further responses
to Plaintiff’s Form Interrogatories, Employment, number 216.1, as to
Defendant’s affirmative defenses numbered 1-4, 36-40, 42, and 43, and (2)
awarding monetary sanctions in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant in the
amount of $4,560.
 
As a threshold matter, the court notes that, in opposition, Defendant
asserts that Plaintiff’s motion was not filed within the time required by Code
of Civil Procedure section 2030.300.   Based on the court’s review of the
correspondence between counsel for Plaintiff and Defendant, the court agrees
and finds that Plaintiff’s motion is untimely.
“Unless notice of [a] motion [to compel further responses to
interrogatories] is given within 45 days of the service of the verified
response, or any supplemental verified response, or on or before any specific
later date to which the propounding party and the responding party have agreed
in writing, the propounding party waives any right to compel a further response
to the interrogatories.”  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (c).)  This
deadline is jurisdictional.  (Sexton
v. Superior Court (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410 [“the time within which
to make a motion to compel production of documents is mandatory and
jurisdictional just as it is for motions to compel further answers to
interrogatories”].)
Defendant served the amended responses that are the subject of
Plaintiff’s motion on July 12, 2023. 
(Obiamiwe Decl., ¶ 8 [“On July 12, 2023, Defendant served Amended
Response . . . .  These responses are the
bases of the instant motion”].)  On
August 7, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel sent a meet and confer letter regarding
Defendant’s July 12, 2023 responses to, inter alia, the discovery that
is the subject of this motion, i.e., Plaintiff’s Employment Interrogatories,
number 216.1.  (Obiamaiwe Decl., Ex. F,
p. 1; Mot., pp. 7:4-9:4 [requesting a further response to number 216.1].)  This letter does not request an extension of Plaintiff’s
deadline to file a motion to compel further responses.  (Obiamaiwe Decl., Ex. F.)  On August 21, 2023, counsel for Defendant
responded to Plaintiff’s counsel’s meet and confer letter, in which counsel
“offer[ed] to extend [Plaintiff’s] motion to compel deadline for the specific
requests identified in [Plaintiff’s counsel’s] last meet and confer letter, to
2 weeks after the IDC can take place.” 
(Obiamiwe Decl., Ex. G, pp. 1 [noting receipt of meet and confer letter
regarding Defendant’s responses to Plaintiff’s employment interrogatories], 2.)
Although the parties appear to assert that counsel therefore agreed to
extend Plaintiff’s deadline to file a motion to compel further responses, the
court disagrees.  First, Plaintiff did
not submit evidence establishing that Plaintiff’s counsel accepted Defendant’s offer
of this extension.  For example,
Plaintiff’s September 6, 2023 letter does not accept that extension.  (Obiamiwe Decl., Ex. H.)  Thus, there does not appear to have been an
agreement “in writing” to extend Plaintiff’s deadline at this time.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd.
(c).)  Second, even if Plaintiff had
produced such evidence, the parties did not comply with section 2030.300 by
failing to extend the deadline to a “specific later date[.]”  As set forth above, a motion to compel
further responses to interrogatories must be filed within 45 days of service of
the verified response, “or on or before any specific later date to which
the propounding party and the responding party have agreed in writing[.]”  (Ibid. [emphasis added].)  To the extent that the parties attempted to
extend Plaintiff’s deadline to file a motion to compel further to “2 weeks
after” an informal discovery conference, such an agreement is insufficient and
does not satisfy Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.300.  (Ibid.; Obiamiwe Decl., Ex. G, p. 2.)
Thus, the court finds that Plaintiff was required to file this motion
no later than 45 days after July 12, 2023, i.e., the date on which Defendant
served its verified responses.  (Obiamiwe
Decl., ¶ 8; Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (c).)  Plaintiff filed this motion on March 20,
2024, i.e., later than 45 days after July 12, 2023, and therefore is untimely.[2]  
The court therefore finds that it does not have jurisdiction to rule
on Plaintiff’s motion other than to deny it. 
(Sexton, supra, 58 Cal.App.4th at p. 1410 [the deadline is
jurisdictional “in the sense that it renders the court without authority to
rule on motions to compel other than to deny them”].)
The court denies Defendant’s request for monetary sanctions against
Plaintiff, made in its opposition. 
ORDER
The court denies plaintiff Kofoworola Folashade Olatunde’s motion to
compel further responses to form interrogatories, employment. 
The court orders defendant Eyanu Health Services, LLC to give notice
of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
