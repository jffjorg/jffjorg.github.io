And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The court finds that the defendants have not satisfied the requirements for an ex parte order, specifically failing to make an affirmative factual showing of irreparable harm, immediate danger, or other statutory basis for granting relief ex parte. The defendants have also failed to demonstrate diligence in filing their motions to compel, waiting until May 2024 to file after receiving responses to their discovery requests in July 2021. Furthermore, the defendants failed to disclose their previous ex parte application seeking the same relief. The court denies the defendants' ex parte application and orders them to give notice of this order.
