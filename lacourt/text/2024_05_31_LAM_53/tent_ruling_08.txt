  Order RE:
 
plaintiff’s motion for terminating, issue,
  or evidence sanctions
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                 Plaintiff Emilio Reyes
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Defendant Lorraine Ann Escobar
Motion for Terminating, Issue, or Evidence Sanctions
The court
considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers filed in connection with
this motion. 
REQUEST FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE
The court grants plaintiff
Emilio Reyes’s request for judicial notice as to Exhibits 4, 5, 6, 13, 15, and
17.  (Evid. Code, § 452, subd. (d).) 
The court denies plaintiff
Emilio Reyes’s request for judicial notice as to Exhibit 16 as an improper
subject for judicial notice.  (Evid.
Code, § 452.)
DISCUSSION
Plaintiff Emilio Reyes (“Plaintiff”) moves the court for an order (1)
imposing terminating sanctions against defendant Lorraine Ann Escobar
(“Defendant”) or, alternatively, (2) imposing issue and/or evidence sanctions
against Defendant.  Plaintiff also
appears to request the imposition of “criminal penalties[.]”  (Mot., p. 17:11-17.)
The court finds that Plaintiff did not provide Defendant with
sufficient notice of this motion and therefore denies Plaintiff’s motion. 
“[A]ll
moving and supporting papers shall be served and filed at least 16 court days
before the hearing.”  (Code Civ. Proc., §¿1005, subd. (b).)  “Any
period of notice . . . which time period or date is prescribed by statute or
rule of court, shall be extended after service by electronic means by two court
days . . . .”  (Code Civ Proc., § 1010.6, subd. (a)(3)(B).)  
Plaintiff
filed the pending motion on May 7, 2024. 
Attached to the motion is a proof of service stating that Plaintiff
electronically served Defendant with the moving papers on that date.  (Mot., p. 21.)  However, for a hearing date of May 31, 2024,
Plaintiff was required to serve Defendant no later than May 6, 2024 (16 court
days + 2 court days for electronic service).[1] 
(Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1005, subd. (b), 1010.6, subd. (a)(3)(B).)  Plaintiff served Defendant with this motion
one day late, on May 7, 2024.  (Mot., p.
21.) 
Thus, the
court finds that Plaintiff failed to serve this motion and supporting papers on
Defendant at least 18 court days before the hearing as required by Code of Civil
Procedure sections 1005, subdivision (b), and 1010.6, subdivision
(a)(3)(B).  The court therefore denies Plaintiff’s motion due to this
insufficient notice. 
However, even if Plaintiff had provided sufficient notice to
Defendant, the court finds that Plaintiff has not shown that the court should
exercise its discretion to impose terminating, issue, or evidence sanctions
against Defendant.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2023.030, subds. (b)-(d).) 
Plaintiff moves for relief on the ground that Defendant (1) disobeyed
the Court of Appeal’s opinion and remittitur and two orders of this court, and
(2) willfully destroyed thousands of emails related to this action. 
First, the court finds that Plaintiff has not shown that Defendant has
willfully violated the orders awarding costs to Plaintiff in the amount of
$582.59.  (Remittitur issued October 21,
2022, p. 33 [“Reyes is entitled to recover his costs as to his appeal of
Escobar’s special motion to strike”]; Dec. 13, 2022 Minute Order, p. 1
[awarding costs to Plaintiff against Defendant in the amount of $582.59]; Feb.
21, 2024 Order, p. 4:1-4 [ordering that Defendant “shall pay costs to
[Plaintiff] as to [Plaintiff’s] appeal of [Defendant’s] special motion to
strike in the total amount of $582.59”].) 
In those orders, the Court of Appeal and Departments 45 and 53 of the
Superior Court did not direct Defendant to pay those costs to Plaintiff within
a certain amount of time.  Instead, the
court’s orders constitute a money judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against
Defendant for costs in the amount of $582.29. 
(Cal. Rules of Ct., rule 8.278, subd. (c)(3) [“An award of costs is
enforceable as a money judgment”].) 
Thus, as noted in the court’s February 21, 2024 order, Plaintiff’s
remedy for nonpayment of those costs is not to seek terminating sanctions, but
rather to enforce the money judgment pursuant to the Enforcement of Judgments
Law (Code Civ. Proc., § 680.010 et seq.). 
(Feb. 21, 2024 Order, p. 3:8-10.) 
Moreover, even if the court were to find that Defendant violated the
court’s orders by failing to pay costs to Plaintiff, the court finds that it
would be improper to impose terminating sanctions against her for that
reason.  (Victor Valley Union High
School District v. Superior Court of San Bernardino County (2023) 91
Cal.App.5th 1121, 1158 [“Discovery sanctions should be appropriate to the
dereliction, and should not exceed that which is required to protect the
interests of the party entitled to but denied discovery”] [internal quotations
and citations omitted]; See Newland v. Superior Court (1995) 40
Cal.App.4th 608, 615 [“a terminating sanction issued solely because of a
failure to pay a monetary discovery sanction is never justified”].) 
Second, the court finds that Plaintiff has not shown that Defendant
engaged in the spoilation of evidence, such that the court should impose
terminating, issue, or evidence sanctions against Defendant. 
The court acknowledges that, in response to Plaintiff’s Requests for
Production, number 72, which demanded the production of documents in support of
her contention that consent is not required to write about lineage as stated to
Andrew Salas in an email on July 8, 2020, Defendant stated that she “does not
have a record of any e-mail to ANDREW SALAS dated July 8, 2020, due to the
necessary purging the thousands of emails previously sent to Defendant by her
former client, Chairman Andrew Salas.” 
(Reyes Decl., Ex. 16, p. 22:15-18.)  However, Plaintiff has not presented adequate
argument establishing that Defendant’s “purging” of emails, presumably
including the July 8, 2020 email, shows that Defendant “in fact destroyed
evidence that had a substantial probability of damaging [Plaintiff’s] ability
to establish an essential element of his claim or defense.”  (Williams v. Russ (2008) 167
Cal.App.4th 1215, 1227.)  Although
Plaintiff argues that “[t]he destroyed communications could have assisted
Plaintiff in developing facts to support each cause of action presented against
each Defendant in the instant case,” he has not explained how the contents of
the July 8, 2020 email would have assisted him in establishing any specific
element(s) of his remaining causes of action. 
(Ibid.; Mot., p. 18:13-17; Reyes Decl., ¶¶ 46-47.)  
Further, to the extent that Plaintiff contends that Defendant’s
discovery response shows that she destroyed “thousands of communications
relevant to the instant case[,]” the court disagrees.  Defendant’s response did not state that she
has deleted thousands of relevant emails, and instead stated that she “purg[ed]
the thousands of emails previously sent to Defendant by her former client,
Chairman Andrew Salas[,]” many of which may not be relevant to this
action.  (Reyes Decl., ¶ 53; Reyes Decl.,
Ex. 16, p. 22:15-18.)  Moreover,
Defendant has stated, in her declaration, that (1) the relevant emails between Defendant
and Salas “had already been submitted to the courts in exhibits by me and
Plaintiff[;]” (2) “the ‘thousands of emails’ [she] talked about [in her
discovery response] were NOT relevant to the instant case[;]” and (3) the
purged emails “were NOT ‘thousands of emails’ about Plaintiff, his claims, or
any of the underlying events in this case.” 
(Escobar Decl., ¶¶ 6-7, 10.)
Thus, the court finds that Plaintiff has not met his burden to show
that Defendant spoliated evidence that had a substantial probability of
damaging his ability to establish an essential element of his remaining causes
of action.  (Williams, supra,
167 Cal.App.4th at p. 1227.)  The court
therefore finds that Plaintiff has not met his burden to show that the court
should exercise its discretion to impose terminating, issue, or evidence
sanctions against Defendant.
Third, the court, after considering the factors set forth in Code of
Civil Procedure section 2024.050, subdivision (b), exercises its discretion to
deny Plaintiff’s alternative request to reopen discovery.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2024.050, subds. (a),
(b).) 
Fourth, the court denies Defendant’s request to impose monetary
sanctions against Plaintiff.  (Code Civ.
Proc., 2023.030, subd. (a).) 
ORDER
            The court denies plaintiff Emilio
Reyes’s motion for terminating, issue, and evidence sanctions.
            The court orders defendant Lorraine
Ann Escobar to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
