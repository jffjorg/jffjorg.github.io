  Case Number:  21STCV13408    Hearing Date:   May 31, 2024    Dept:  53 DB Maple Avenue LLC v. 450
Maple Condominium Owners Assoc.  21STCV13408   
Ex
Parte Application  5.31.24
The
court finds that defendants have not satisfied the requirement of California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1202, subdivision (c), that an applicant for an ex parte
order must make an affirmative factual showing in a declaration containing
competent testimony based on personal knowledge of irreparable harm, immediate
danger, or other statutory basis for granting relief ex parte.  Although defendants received plaintiffs’
responses to defendants’ form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and
requests for production of documents in July 2021, defendants waited until May
2024 to file motions to compel responses with respect to those discovery
requests.  Trial is set for July 24,
2024.  Defendants have not shown that
they have acted with diligence with respect to filing those motions to compel.    
  On April 30, 2024, defendants filed an ex
parte application to continue trial and all related pre-trial dates.  On May 2, 2024, the court issued a minute
order denying that ex parte application and finding that defendants had not met
their burden to show good cause to continue trial.  Defendants have now filed a second ex parte
application on May 30, 2024, seeking the same relief.  But defendants have not included a disclosure
of their previous ex parte application seeking the same relief and the court’s order
thereon, as required by California Rules of Court, rule 3.1202, subdivision (b).

The
court also finds that defendants have not met their burden to show good cause
to continue trial.     
The
court therefore denies defendants’ ex parte application.
The court
orders defendants to give notice of this order.
