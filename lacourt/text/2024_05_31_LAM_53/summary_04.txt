The Judge rules that the Plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to form interrogatories, employment is untimely. The Plaintiff's motion was filed after the jurisdictional deadline of 45 days after the defendant served the amended responses. The parties did not agree to extend the deadline in writing, which is required by law. The Judge denies the motion and orders the defendant to give notice of the ruling. The Judge also denies the defendant's request for monetary sanctions against the Plaintiff.
