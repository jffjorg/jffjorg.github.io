Plaintiff appears to have filed two sets of moving papers, first on March 18,
2024, and second, on March 20, 2024.


[2] Moreover,
even if the parties could agree to extend the deadline without stating a date certain,
it appears that Plaintiff’s deadline would have expired two weeks after the
December 14, 2023 informal discovery conference.  Plaintiff filed, on October 31, 2023, a
request for an informal discovery conference, in which Plaintiff stated that
she “would like further responses to Form Interrogatories:” and noted that
Plaintiff propounded employment interrogatories on Defendant.  (Oct. 31, 2023, p. 1, ¶ 1.)  This request (1) notes the informal discovery
conference date to be “12/14/23, [at] 10:00 am[,]” and (2) lists the
reservation ID number to be 547974241288, which is associated with the December
14, 2023 informal discovery conference on the court’s case management
system.   (Id., pp. 1-2.)  Defendant’s offer to extend the deadline “to
2 weeks after the IDC can take place” would therefore appear to have
applied to December 14, 2023, because that is the date on which the informal
discovery conference could have taken place, had Plaintiff’s counsel
appeared.  (Obiamiwe Decl., Ex. G, p. 2
[emphasis added]; Dec. 14, 2023 Minute Order, p. 1 [noting that Plaintiff
(moving party) is not present and therefore ordering the matter off-calendar on
the court’s own motion].)
