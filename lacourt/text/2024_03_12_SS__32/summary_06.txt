And here is the text summary:

This tentative ruling grants the motion for summary judgment filed by defendants Sufi Ismail and Ifus Global USA, Inc. dba Cars4Less. The defendants argue that they are a used car dealership who sold the subject car to Salvador Cisneros prior to the accident, and therefore had no ownership interest in the car or agency relationship with the driver. The plaintiff, Amanda Williams, has not filed an opposition to the motion. The court finds that the defendants have met their initial burden of showing that there is no triable dispute of material fact regarding ownership of the vehicle and whether the driver was an agent of the defendants. Therefore, the defendants' motion for summary judgment is granted.
