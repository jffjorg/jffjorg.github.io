And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge is considering a motion to compel the deposition of defendant Antoine Jackson, filed by Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (LACMTA). LACMTA had previously served notices for the deposition, but Jackson failed to appear. The judge finds that the meet and confer requirement has not been met, as LACMTA's counsel did not contact Jackson before filing the motion. Despite this, the judge grants the motion to compel the deposition, as Jackson failed to appear or serve a valid objection. The judge also awards monetary sanctions of $500 to LACMTA, as Jackson's counsel was recently retained and the amount requested was excessive. The judge orders Jackson to appear for deposition within 30 days and to pay the monetary sanctions within 30 days.
