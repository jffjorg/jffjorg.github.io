English-text summary:

The tentative ruling is regarding a motion to set aside and vacate a dismissal with prejudice entered in September 2022. The motion was filed by the plaintiffs, Aida Sedano-Herrera and Ayhden Herrera, who claim that their former counsel inadvertently filed a request for dismissal with prejudice after the case settled, but before a minor's compromise could be approved. The court grants the motion to reopen the case for the limited purpose of a hearing on a petition for approval of a minor's compromise, based on the notice of settlement filed in June 2022. The matter is set for an order to show cause re dismissal (settlement) for May 13, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. in Department 32 of the Spring Street Courthouse.
