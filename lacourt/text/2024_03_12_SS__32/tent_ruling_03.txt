TENTATIVE
RULING
 



DEPT:


32




HEARING DATE:


March
  12, 2024




CASE NUMBER:


21STCV03475




MOTIONS:  


Motion
  for Terminating Sanctions   




MOVING PARTY:


Defendants Steuber Corporation and Patrick
  Fink




OPPOSING PARTY:


None
  



 
 
BACKGROUND
 
Defendants Steuber Corporation dba Alta Service and Patrick Fink
(“Defendants”) move for terminating sanctions against Plaintiff Christina
Stever (“Plaintiff”) for failure to comply with the Court’s November 8, 2023 discovery
order. No opposition has been filed. 
 
LEGAL
STANDARD 
 
“To
the extent authorized by the chapter governing any particular discovery method
or any other provision of this title, the court, after notice to any affected
party, person, or attorney, and after opportunity for hearing, may
impose…sanctions against anyone engaging in conduct that is a misuse of the
discovery process.” (Code Civ. Proc. section 2023.030.) The court may impose a
terminating sanction for misuse of the discovery process by any of the
following: “(1) An order striking out the pleadings or parts of the pleadings
of any party engaging in the misuse of the discovery process; (2) An order
staying further proceedings by that party until an order for discovery is
obeyed; (3) An order dismissing the action, or any part of the action, of that
party; (4) An order rendering a judgment by default against that party.” (Code
Civ. Proc. § 2023.030(d).)  Failing to
respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery, or
disobeying
a court order to provide discovery, constitutes a
misuse of the discovery process. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (d), (g).)

 
“The trial court may order a terminating sanction for discovery abuse
‘after considering the totality of the circumstances: [the] conduct of the
party to determine if the actions were willful; the detriment to the
propounding party; and the number of formal and informal attempts to obtain the
discovery.’” (Los Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez (2014) 223 Cal. App. 4th 377, 390,
quoting Lang v. Hochman (2000) 77 Cal. App. 4th 1225, 1246.)   
 
“Generally, ‘[a] decision to order terminating sanctions should not be
made lightly.  But where a violation is
willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less
severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the
trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction.’” (Los Defensores,
supra, 223 Cal. App. 4th at p. 390 [citation omitted].)    
 
“Under this standard, trial courts have properly imposed terminating
sanctions when parties have willfully disobeyed one or more discovery orders.”
(Los Defensores, supra, 223 Cal.App.4th at p. 390 citing Lang, supra, 77
Cal.App.4th at pp. 1244-1246 [discussing cases]; see, e.g., Collisson &
Kaplan v. Hartunian (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 1611, 1617-1622 [terminating
sanctions imposed (by striking the defendant’s Answer and subsequently granting
default judgment) after defendants failed to comply with one court order to
produce discovery]; Laguna Auto Body v. Farmers Ins. Exchange (1991) 231
Cal.App.3d 481, 491, disapproved on other grounds in Garcia v. McCutchen (1997)
16 Cal.4th 469, 478, n. 4 [terminating sanctions imposed against the plaintiff
for failing to comply with a discovery order and for violating various
discovery statutes].)  
 
DISCUSSION
 
From February 21, 2023 to July 14, 2023, Defendants attempted to
notice Plaintiff’s deposition. (Chapman Decl. ¶ 3–5.) Each time, Plaintiff
unilaterally cancelled the deposition but failed to provide alternative dates.
Defendants then moved to compel Plaintiff’s deposition. 
 
On November 8, 2023, the Court granted Defendants’ unopposed motion to
compel Plaintiff’s deposition. Counsel for Plaintiff submitted on the Court’s
tentative ruling. The Court ordered Plaintiff to appear for deposition within
30 days and ordered Plaintiff to pay $229.65 in monetary sanctions to
Defendants’ counsel. (Min. Order, 11/8/23.) On November 13, 2023, Defendants
served notice of the order on Plaintiff’s counsel.
 
On November 30, 2023, Defendants noticed Plaintiff’s deposition for
December 19, 2023. (Chapman Decl. ¶ 12, Exh. B.) Plaintiff has not responded to
the notice. Defendants argue that therefore, Plaintiff is unresponsive and has
made it impossible to move forward with discovery.
 
The Court finds that Plaintiff has not complied with the November 8,
2023 order. Plaintiff also has been unresponsive or uncooperative in attempts
to schedule her deposition since February 2023. Plaintiff does not oppose this
motion and therefore fails to set forth reasons for the discovery abuse. Accordingly,
the Court grants the motion.
 
CONCLUSION
 
Therefore, Defendants’ motion for terminating sanctions is GRANTED. The
complaint as to Defendants Steuber Corporation dba Alta Service and Patrick
Fink is dismissed without prejudice.
 
Defendants shall provide notice of the Court’s ruling and file a proof
of service of such.
