Significant Statements:
  - "The court may impose a terminating sanction for misuse of the discovery process... after considering the totality of the circumstances..."
  - "A decision to order terminating sanctions should not be made lightly. But where a violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction."
```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the motion for terminating sanctions filed by defendants Steuber Corporation and Patrick Fink against plaintiff Christina Stever. The motion is granted because the plaintiff has failed to comply with a discovery order and has been unresponsive or uncooperative in attempts to schedule her deposition since February 2023. The plaintiff did not oppose the motion, and therefore failed to set forth reasons for the discovery abuse. As a result, the complaint as to the defendants is dismissed without prejudice.
