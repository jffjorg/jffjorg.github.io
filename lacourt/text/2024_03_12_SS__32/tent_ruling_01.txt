  12, 2024




CASE NUMBER:


18STCV04392




MOTIONS:  


Motion
  to Set Aside and Vacate Dismissal 




MOVING PARTY:


Plaintiffs Aida Sedano-Herrera and Ayhden
  Herrera




OPPOSING PARTY:


None



 
BACKGROUND
 
On November 6, 2018, Plaintiffs Aida Sedano-Herrera and Ayhden Herrera
(“Plaintiffs”) filed a complaint against Defendant McDonald’s Corporation and
Does 1 to 25 after Ahyden Herrera, Aida Sedano-Herrera’s son, allegedly
consumed food with a foreign object. Since Ahyden Herrera is a minor, Aida was
appointed guardian ad litem on March 11, 2019. 
 
On June 28, 2022, Plaintiffs filed a notice of settlement of the
entire case. 
 
On September 14, 2022, Plaintiffs’ action was dismissed with prejudice,
pursuant to Plaintiffs’ request for dismissal. (Dismissal filed 9/13/22.) 
 
On February 21, 2024, Plaintiffs filed the instant motion to set aside
and vacate the dismissal so that they may file a petition to approve a minor’s
compromise. No opposition has been filed. 
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
Under Code
of Civil Procedure section 473(b), the Court may relieve a party from a
dismissal taken against him through his mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or
excusable neglect.  This application must
be filed no more than six months after entry of the order from which relief is
sought, and must contain an affidavit of fault demonstrating the moving party’s
mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. 
 
A mistake
is a basis for relief under section 473 when by reason of the mistake a party
failed to make a timely response.  Surprise occurs when a party is
unexpectedly placed in a position to his injury without any negligence of his
own. Excusable neglect is a basis for relief when the party has shown some
reasonable excuse for the default.  (Credit Managers Association of
California v. National Independent Business Alliance (1984) 162 Cal.App.3d
1166, 1173; Davis v. Thayer (1980) 113 Cal.App.3d 892, 905.)  Under
Code of Civil Procedure section 473, the moving party bears the burden of
demonstrating an excusable ground, such as fraud or mistake, justifying a
court’s vacating a judgment.  (Basinger v. Roger & Wells (1990)
220 Cal.App.3d 16, 23–24.)   
 
Relief under
this section is mandatory when based on an attorney affidavit of fault;
otherwise, it is discretionary. (Id.) However mandatory relief is only
available when a party fails to oppose a dismissal motion (“which are
procedurally equivalent to a default”). (Leader v. Health Industries of America, Inc. (2001) 89
Cal.App.4th 603, 620.) The mandatory relief provision
does not apply to dismissals for “failure to prosecute [citations omitted], dismissals
for failure to serve a complaint within three years [citations omitted],
dismissals based on running of the statute of limitations [citations omitted],
and voluntary dismissals entered pursuant to settlement [citations omitted].”
(Id.) 
 
DISCUSSION
 
            Plaintiffs’
notice of motion does not state the grounds for bringing this motion. However,
in the memorandum, Plaintiffs cite to Code of Civil Procedure section 473(b).  Procedurally, the present motion is untimely
under section 473(b) since it was filed over six months after the case was
dismissed.  The six-month limitations periods of the
mandatory and the discretionary relief provisions of section 473(b) mean the
longer of six calendar months or 182 days. (See Jimenez
v. Chavez (2023) 97 Cal.App.5th 50, 58.) Therefore, Plaintiffs’ deadline to
file this motion was March 15, 2023. Since the motion was filed on February
21, 2024,
it is untimely under section 473(b). 
 
            However,
Plaintiffs also argue the minor Plaintiff will be prejudiced if relief if not
granted. 
 
“After six months from default, a
trial court may still vacate a default on equitable ground even if statutory
relief is unavailable.”¿ (Rappleyea v. Campbell (1994) 8 Cal.4th 975,
981.)¿ A party may obtain equitable relief from
an entry of dismissal based on an extrinsic mistake when the moving party: (1)
has a meritorious case, (2) articulates a satisfactory excuse for not
presenting a defense to the original action, and (3) demonstrates diligence in
seeking to set aside the dismissal once discovered.¿ (Id. at p. 982.)¿¿ 
¿ 
An extrinsic
mistake is broadly defined “. . . to encompass almost any set of extrinsic
circumstances which deprive a party of a fair adversary hearing. It does not
seem to matter if the particular circumstances qualify as fraudulent or
mistaken in the strict sense.”¿(In re Marriage of Park (1980) 27 Cal.3d
337, 342.) An ‘extrinsic’ mistake means a mistake that deprived a party of the
opportunity to present a claim or defense while an ‘intrinsic’ mistake is one
that goes to the merits of a proceeding.¿ (In re Marriage of Stevenot
(1984) 154 Cal.App.3d 1051, 1064-1065.)¿¿ 
¿ 
A default cannot
be set aside when the complaining party’s negligence contributed to the rise to
the fraud or mistake.¿(See Kulchar v. Kulchar (1969) 1 Cal.3d 467,
473-474 [complaining party’s failure to investigate and assemble evidence at
trial as grounds for denying equitable relief sought].)¿An extrinsic mistake
may result from a disability when the disability renders the party incompetent or
incapacitated such that it deprives the party from asserting a claim or
defense. (See id. at pp. 471-472.)¿ “For attorney misconduct to support
equitable relief from a default judgment due to extrinsic mistake, there must
have been ‘neglect of an extreme degree amounting to positive misconduct’ by
counsel, rather than mere inexcusable neglect, sufficient to obliterate the
attorney-client relationship and thereby preclude any imputation of counsel's
neglect to the client. [Citations.] ‘Positive misconduct is found where there
is a total failure on the part of counsel to represent his client.’ [Citation.]”
(People v. One Parcel of Land (1991) 235 Cal.App.3d 579, 584.) 
 
            Here,
Plaintiffs argue that their former counsel inadvertently filed a request for dismissal
with prejudice after the case settled, but before a minor’s compromise could be
approved. (Pirnia Decl. ¶ 4.) This attorney is no longer with the firm.
Plaintiff’s current counsel declares that on December 6, 2023, he discovered
that the former attorney had filed a minor’s compromise petition in Probate
Court on November 16, 2022. Plaintiffs argue their counsel acted diligently to
bring this motion after discovering the inadvertent dismissal. Plaintiffs seek
to reopen this case solely to file their petition for approval of a minor’s
compromise, pursuant to the settlement that occurred in 2022. 
             
CONCLUSION AND
ORDER
 
The Court grants the motion to reopen for the limited purpose of a
hearing on a petition for approval of minor’s compromise, based on the notice
of settlement filed on June 28, 2022. Plaintiffs must file and serve the
petition within 30 days.
 
The matter is set for an Order to Show Cause Re Dismissal (Settlement)
for May 13, 2024 at 8:30 a.m. in Department 32 of the Spring Street Courthouse.
 
Plaintiffs to provide notice and file a proof of service of such.
