This is a tentative ruling by the judge in a civil case (Case Number: 20STCV47618) regarding a motion to quash a subpoena issued by the defendants, Jerome Lee Brandehoff and The Hertz Corporation, to T-Mobile USA, Inc. for the phone records of the plaintiff, Kristine Louise Delgado. The plaintiff argues that the subpoena is irrelevant, overly broad, and violates her right to privacy, and that the defendants did not comply with Code of Civil Procedure section 1985.3(f) requiring written consent before obtaining phone records. The judge grants the motion to quash the subpoena, finding that the records for a short period of time are relevant but seeking records for an entire day is overly broad, and that the defendants did not comply with section 1985.3(f). The judge also awards the plaintiff monetary sanctions in the reduced amount of $2,061.65.
