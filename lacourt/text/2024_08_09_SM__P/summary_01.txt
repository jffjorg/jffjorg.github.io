And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on August 9, 2024, regarding the case between Umberto Ferri, Devgan Enterprises, LLC, and Arefadib. The case involved multiple claims and counterclaims related to breaches of leases and the use of a retail space as a restaurant. Arefadib initially leased the premises and then subleased it to Ferri. The Judge found that the lease was unenforceable, and Arefadib's claims against Devgan failed. Devgan, on the other hand, failed to prove its claims against Arefadib. Arefadib sought attorney's fees and costs, but the Judge denied the request, finding that neither party was the prevailing party and therefore not entitled to prevailing party damages. The Judge applied Civil Code §1717, Code of Civil Procedure §1032, and Code of Civil Procedure §1033.5 to determine the prevailing party, taking into account the parties' objectives and the relief awarded.
