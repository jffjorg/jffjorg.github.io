And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling is that the motion to continue the trial, filed by the City of Los Angeles (the defendant), is denied without prejudice on procedural grounds. The defendant has requested a continuance of approximately six months, citing the need for additional discovery to be completed. However, the motion was not filed and served in a timely fashion, and therefore is denied. The court has considered the factors set forth in California Rules of Court, rule 3.1332, including the proximity of the trial date, the previous continuances granted, and the availability of alternative means to address the problem that gave rise to the motion. The court has determined that the interests of justice are best served by denying the motion and proceeding with the trial as scheduled.
