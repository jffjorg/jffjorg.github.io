Background
On November 14, 2023, Maria Del
Carmen Rodriguez (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against El Pollo Loco, Inc.
(“Defendant”), and Does 1 through 100 for negligence and premises liability arising
out of a slip and fall on August 29, 2023, at location on North Alvarado Street
in Los Angeles. 
 
On December 11, 2023, Defendant filed
an answer.  On the same day, Defendant
served Plaintiff with discovery, including Form Interrogatories (Set One),
Special Interrogatories (Set One), and Requests for Production (Set One).  (Glazer Decls., ¶ 3-4 & Exhs. A.)  Plaintiff requested, and Defendant granted,
several extensions, but still Plaintiff provided no responses.  (Id., ¶¶ 5-13.)  
 
On April 22, 2024, Defendant filed these
three motions to compel initial responses. 
No opposition has been filed.
 
Legal Standard
 
A party must respond to interrogatories within 30 days after
service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subd.(a).) If a party to whom
interrogatories are directed does not provide a timely response, the
propounding party may move for an order compelling response to the
interrogatories. (Id., § 2030.290, subd. (b).) There is no time limit
for a motion to compel initial responses, and no meet and confer efforts are
required. (See id., § 2030.290; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc.
v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor
must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who
fails to provide a timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).) 
When a party moves to compel initial responses to
interrogatories, “the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the motion], unless it finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd.
(c).)
A party must respond to requests for production of
documents within 30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260,
subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests for production of documents are directed
does not provide timely responses, the requesting party may move for an order
compelling response to the demand. (Id., § 2031.300, subd. (b).) There
is no time limit for a motion to compel initial responses, and no meet and
confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2031.300; Sinaiko Healthcare
Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th
390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who
fails to provide a timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a).) 
When
a party moves to compel initial responses to requests for production, “the
court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes [the motion], unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction
acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the
imposition of the sanction unjust.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (c).) 
In Chapter 7 of the Civil Discovery
Act, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010, subdivision (d), defines
“[m]isuses of the discovery process” to include “[f]ailing to respond to or to
submit to an authorized method of discovery.” 
Where a party or attorney has engaged in misuse of the discovery
process, the court may impose a monetary sanction in the amount of “the
reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result
of that conduct.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2023.020, subd. (a).)
Discussion
Defendant served Plaintiff with
discovery on December 11, 2023, including Form Interrogatories (Set One),
Special Interrogatories (Set One), and Requests for Production (Set One).  (Glazer Decls., ¶ 3-4 & Exhs. A.)  Despite receiving several extensions,
Plaintiff Plaintiff never responded.  (Id.,
¶¶ 5-13.)  
 
Defendant need not show anything
more.  The three
motions to compel are GRANTED.
 
The
Court denies the sanctions requests in the three motions to compel.  
 
Defendant seeks sanctions under Code
of Civil Procedure section 2031.010, 2023.030, 2030.290, 2031.300.
Section 2023.010 defines “misuses of the discovery process”
but does not contain an authorization for the imposition of sanctions.
Section 2023.030 provides for sanctions for the misuse of the
discovery process “[t]o the extent authorized by any chapter governing any
particular discovery method or any other provision of this title [the Civil
Discovery Act].”  In other words, section
2023.030 does not contain an independent authorization or sanctions but
provides for the type of sanctions that may be imposed when authorized
elsewhere in the Civil Discovery Act. 
Sections 2030.290 and 2031.300 authorize sanctions against a party,
person, or attorney “who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to
compel.”  Here, Plaintiff has not opposed
the motion, and therefore is not subject to sanctions under these provisions.  
The Court notes that other provisions of the Civil Discovery
Act provide for sanctions even in the absence of an unsuccessful motion or
opposition.  (See, e.g., Code Civ. Proc.,
§§ 2025.450, subd. (g)(1) & 2033.280, subd. (c).)  For the motions to compel at issue here,
however, the Legislature has provided for sanctions only upon an unsuccessful
motion or opposition.
Accordingly, in the absence of a statutory authorization for
sanctions, the requests for sanctions are denied.
