And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

**Tentative Ruling**

The court has reviewed the motions to consolidate the DeSilveira Case and the Bledsoe Case, and to continue the trial. The court rules that the cases are not related, and therefore the motion to consolidate is denied. The court also denies the motion to continue the trial, as there is no good cause shown for the continuance. The court's denial of the motion to consolidate is based on its previous ruling that the cases are not related. The court's denial of the motion to continue the trial is based on the fact that there is no good cause shown for the continuance, and the court's discretion in granting continuances.
