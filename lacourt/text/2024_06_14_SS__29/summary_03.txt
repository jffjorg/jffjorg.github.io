And here is the English text summary:

This tentative ruling grants in part the motion to compel additional physical examination of the Plaintiff, Daniel Romero Garcia, by Defendant Vanis Mikaelian. The motion was filed on May 10, 2024, and no opposition was filed. The Defendant seeks to conduct an additional physical examination of the Plaintiff by orthopedic surgeon Steven C. Dennis, M.D. The examination will include taking of the Plaintiff's medical history, visual inspection, review of systems, range of motion testing, gait testing, coordination testing, motor testing, strength testing, sensory examination, and palpation of the plaintiff's allegedly injured body parts. The examination will not be invasive, will not involve painful, protracted, or intrusive procedures, and will not involve x-rays. The Court grants the motion, subject to three exceptions: the date of the examination must be reset to give the Plaintiff adequate advance notice, the examiner's taking of a medical history of the Plaintiff is limited to the orthopedic injuries attributed to the accident and the parts of the Plaintiff's body that he contends were injured in the accident, and the Defendant has not shown good cause for an orthopedic surgeon to conduct "mental status and cranial nerve testing." The examination is scheduled for July __, 2024, at 9 a.m. at the medical offices of Dr. Steven C. Dennis.
