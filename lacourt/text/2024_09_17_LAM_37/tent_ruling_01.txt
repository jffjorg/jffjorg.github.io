Background
 
This
action stems from a claim for childhood sexual assault. On July 14, 2022, Mary
Bolden (“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint against Doe 1 with four causes of action:
1)    
Negligence (against
School);
2)    
Negligence (against DOES
2 through 25);
3)    
Negligent Hiring,
Retention, and Supervision (against School); and
4)    
Negligent Hiring,
Retention, and 6. Supervision (against DOES 2 through 25). 
 
Defendant
Los Angeles Unified School District (“LAUSD”) filed a motion for judgment on
the pleadings. Plaintiff opposes the Motion. The matter is now before the
court.

judgment on the pleadings[1]
 
I.         Legal Standard
 
“A motion for judgment on the pleadings performs the same
function as a general demurrer, and hence attacks only defects disclosed on the
face of the pleadings or by matters that can be judicially noticed.” (Burnett
v. Chimney Sweep (2004) 123 Cal.App.4th 1057, 1064.) “In deciding or
reviewing a judgment on the pleadings, all properly pleaded material facts are
deemed to be true, as well as all facts that may be implied or inferred from
those expressly alleged.” (Fire Ins. Exchange v. Superior Court (2004)
116 Cal.App.4th 446, 452.) When considering demurrers and judgment on the
pleadings, courts read the allegations liberally and in context. (Wilson v.
Transit Authority of City of Sacramento (1962) 199 Cal.App.2d 716, 720-21.)
A motion for judgment on the pleadings does not lie as to a portion of a cause
of action. (Id.) “In the case of either a demurrer or a motion for
judgment on the pleadings, leave to amend should be granted if there is any
reasonable possibility that the plaintiff can state a good cause of action.” (Gami
v. Mullikin Medical Ctr. (1993) 18 Cal.App.4th 870, 876.) A non-statutory
motion for judgment on the pleadings may be made any time before or during
trial. (Stoops v. Abbassi (2002) 100 Cal.App.4th 644, 650.)¿¿ 
 
II.        Request for Judicial Notice
 
The court may take judicial notice
of “official acts of the legislative, executive, and judicial departments of
the United States and of any state of the United States,” “[r]ecords of (1) any
court of this state or (2) any court of record of the United States or of any
state of the United States,” and “[f]acts and propositions that are not
reasonably subject to dispute and are capable of immediate and accurate
determination by resort to sources of reasonably indisputable accuracy.” (Evid.
Code, § 452, subds. (c), (d), and (h).) “Taking judicial notice of a
document is not the same as accepting the truth of its contents or accepting a
particular interpretation of its meaning.” (Joslin v. H.A.S. Ins. Brokerage (1986)
184 Cal.App.3d 369, 374.)
 
Defendant LAUSD requests judicial
notice of the following: 
 
1)    
Exhibit 1: Notice of Entry of Order in
Jane Doe #1, et al. v. Acalanes Union High School District, et al., Contra
Costa County Superior Court, Case No. C22-02613, regarding the sustaining of
defendant’s demurrer without leave to amend on June 13, 2023.
 
Defendant’s request for judicial
notice of Exhibit 1 is denied. Defendant LAUSD seeks judicial notice of a trial
court ruling in another case which is unpublished with no precedential value in
this court.  The opinion is submitted not
as evidence but is cited as precedent. Such a citation is beyond the scope of
judicial notice and is legally improper. (Budrow v. Dave & Buster’s of
California, Inc. (2009) 171 Cal.App.4th 875, 884-885.)
Plaintiff similarly requests
judicial notice of several minute orders and trial court orders that are
submitted not as evidence but as precedent. As stated above, this is legally improper,
and the court denies Plaintiff’s request for judicial notice as to Exhibits 2
to 17. 
 
Exhibit 18 is “Assembly
floor analysis AB 218 dated August 30, 2019.” The court may take judicial
notice of an assembly bill. (K.M. v. Grossmont Union High School Dist.
(2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 717, 740.) Exhibit 19 is the appellate opinion by
the First Appellate District, Division Five, in West Contra Costa Unified
School District v. The Superior Court of Contra Costa County (Appellate
Case No. A169314). The court may similarly take judicial notice of Exhibit 19
because it is an official court order. 
 
Plaintiff’s request for judicial
notice is denied as to Exhibits 1 to 17 and granted as to Exhibits 18 and 19. 
 
III.      Discussion
 
Defendant LAUSD
requests judgment on the pleadings on the basis that Assembly Bill 218’s (“AB
218”) retroactive elimination of the government claims requirement constitutes
an unconstitutional gift of public funds prohibited by Article XVI, § 6 of the
California Constitution. 
 
Under the
Government Tort Claims Act, no person may sue a public entity or public
employee for money or damages unless a timely written claim has been presented to
and acted on or deemed rejected by the public entity. (Gov. Code, §§ 905,
912.4, 945.4.) Gov. Code § 905(m) exempts “[c]laims made pursuant to
Section 340.1 of the Code of Civil Procedure for the recovery of damages
suffered as a result of childhood sexual abuse.” (Gov. Code, § 904(m); see also
A.M. v. Ventura Unified School Dist. (2016) 3 Cal.App.5th 1252,
1254–1255 (A.M.).)¿¿ Furthermore, Gov. Code § 905(p) explicitly
states:  
 
The changes made to this section by the act that
added this subdivision are retroactive and apply to any action commenced on or
after the date of enactment of that act, and to any action filed before the
date of enactment and still pending on that date, including any action or
causes of action that would have been barred by the laws in effect before the
date of enactment. 
 
AB 218, as codified
in CCP § 340.1, abolished the statute of limitation for childhood sexual
assault claims, and subdivisions (m) and (p) of Gov. Code § 905 expressly
exclude such claims from the claim presentation requirement and retroactively
revives such claims. Because AB 218 revives childhood sexual assault claims
that would otherwise have lapsed, Defendant LAUSD asserts Plaintiff’s entire
action is barred because it violates the gift clause of the California
Constitution. 
 
Defendant LAUSD
fails to address the recent decision in West Contra Costa Unified School
District v. Superior Court of Contra Costa County (2024) 103 Cal.App.5th
1243 [323 Cal.Rptr.3d 904, 913], in which the Court of Appeal found that AB 218
did not violate the gift clause of the California constitution. 
As we explain, waiver of the claim presentation
requirement did not constitute an expenditure of public funds that may be
considered a “gift” because AB 218 did not create new “substantive liability”
[citation] for the underlying alleged wrongful conduct. Instead, AB 218 simply
waived a condition the state had imposed on its consent to suit. [Citations.] 
 
(West Contra
Costa, at p. 913.) 
 
The West Contra
Costa Court found that AB 218’s retroactive elimination of the government
claims requirement is not unconstitutional because a gift of public funds is
not unconstitutional if it is used for a public rather than a private purpose.  “’The benefit to the state from an
expenditure for a ‘public purpose’ is in the nature of consideration and the
funds expended are therefore not a gift even though private persons are
benefited there from.’ ’ ” (West Contra Costa, at p. 912 [internal
citations omitted].)  “Even if we had
ruled that AB 218 authorizes expenditures within the scope of the gift clause,
the expenditures are not “gifts” because they serve a public purpose.” (Id.,
at p. 919.) 


Therefore, LAUSD’s
claim that AB 218 is unconstitutional because it violates the gift clause is
without merit. Moreover, the decision of the appellate court is binding on this
court. (Cuccia v. Superior Court (2007) 153 Cal.App.4th 347,
353–354; Auto Equity Sales, Inc. v. Superior Court (1962) 57 Cal.2d
450, 455.) Consequently, the motion for judgment on the pleadings is denied. 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant LAUSD’s motion for
judgment on the pleadings is denied.
