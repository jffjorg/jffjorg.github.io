And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English:

Pibe's Auto LLC has filed a motion to consolidate two related cases, Case No. 22STCV33027 (the "Ornelaz Action") and Case No. 23BBCV00602 (the "Talamantes Action"), arising out of a vehicle accident on May 16, 2022. Both cases involve similar claims and defendants, including Pibe's Auto LLC. However, the motion is denied without prejudice because no notice of motion was filed in the Talamantes Action, violating a mandatory procedural requirement. The Court finds that the cases are related and should be consolidated, but the denial is based on a procedural defect and is therefore without prejudice.
