(Set Two), and Requests for Production of Documents (Set Two) filed by
Defendant Silfred Lopez Duarte.
 
Tentative
The motion is granted.
Background
On June 18, 2021, Plaintiff Juan Francisco Segura
Barrientos (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Silfred Lopez Duarte
(“Defendant”), S.L.A.J Transport LLC, and Does 1 through 50, asserting causes
of action for motor vehicle negligence and general negligence arising out of an
accident that occurred on October 9, 2020, at or near the intersection of the 210
and 610 Freeways in Duarte.  Defendant
filed an answer on November 18, 2022.
 
On November 30, 2023, Defendant served Plaintiff with discovery,
including Special Interrogatories (Set Two), and Requests
for Production of Documents (Set Two). (Lyon Decl., ¶¶ 4, 5 & Exhs. E-F.)  Plaintiff did not respond.  (Id., ¶¶ 6-7.) 
 
On January 11, 2024, Defendant filed his motion to compel
Plaintiff’s responses. No opposition has been filed. 
 
Legal Standard
A party must respond to interrogatories within 30 days
after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subd.(a).) If a party to whom
interrogatories are directed does not provide a timely response, the propounding
party may move for an order compelling response to the interrogatories. (Id.,
§ 2030.290, subd. (b).) There is no time limit for a motion to compel initial
responses, and no meet and confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2030.290;
Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants
(2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In
addition, a party who fails to provide a timely response generally waives all
objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.290, subd. (a).) 
A party must respond to requests for production of
documents within 30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260,
subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests for production of documents are directed
does not provide timely responses, the requesting party may move for an order
compelling response to the demand. (Id., § 2031.300, subd. (b).) There
is no time limit for a motion to compel initial responses, and no meet and
confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2031.300; Sinaiko Healthcare
Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th
390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who
fails to provide a timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a).)
