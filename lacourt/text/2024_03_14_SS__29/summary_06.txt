Here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for a protective order filed by the defendants. The motion was denied. The defendants also sought sanctions against the plaintiffs, which were also denied. The ruling relates to a shooting that occurred in a bar on August 28, 2022, and a subsequent lawsuit filed by the plaintiffs against the defendants. The defendants had sought to prevent the plaintiffs from serving discovery requests on Cross-Defendant Roman, who has not appeared in the case. The Judge found that the defendants did not have the authority to seek a protective order and that the imposition of sanctions would be unjust. The case will proceed without the protective order and sanctions.
