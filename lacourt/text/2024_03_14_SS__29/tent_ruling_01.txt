  Case Number:  19STCV17761    Hearing Date:   March 14, 2024    Dept:  29 Motion to Enforce Settlement filed by Defendant Simon M.
Keushkerian
Motion to Enforce Settlement filed by Defendant Glendale Adventist Medical
Center.
 
Tentative
 
The motions are continued.
 
Background
On May 22, 2019, Vahe Menachkanian and
Margyet Manaserian (collectively “Plaintiffs”) filed a complaint against Simon
M. Keushkerian, M.D. (“Keushkerian”), Faisal A. Khan, M.D. (“Khan”), Glendale
Adventist Medical Center (“GAMC”), and Does 1 through 20 for professional
negligence and loss of consortium arising out of a surgical procedure that
occurred on May 25, 2018.
Keushkerian, Khan, and GAMC filed their answers
on October 8 and 11, 2019.  In or about
July 2020, Plaintiffs settled with Khan.
The case proceeded against Keushkerian and
GAMC.  The parties participated in a
mediation at Judicate West on or about May 8, 2023.  Subsequently, on or about May 25, 2023, Plaintiffs,
Keushkerian, and GMAC all signed a one-page written Settlement Agreement. (Wend
Decl., ¶¶ 3-5 & Exh. A; Kjar Decl., ¶¶ 3-5 & Exh. C.)
The Settlement Agreement provides for a total
settlement amount of $325,000, with each of Keushkerian and GAMC to contribute
half of that amount ($162,500).  Plaintiff
Menachkanian is to receive $295,000, and Plaintiff Menaserian is to receive
$30,000.  Each side bears its own fees
and costs, and liens are the responsibility of Plaintiffs.  The Settlement Agreement also provides (among
other terms):
Plaintiffs’ counsel to provide a W9 and
payment instructions as soon as practicable. 
Defendant’s counsel to provide complete release documents, including
waiver of Civil Code section 1542, to plaintiffs within 7 business days
thereof.  Proceeds to plaintiffs and
their counsel within 30 days of defense counsels’ receipt of all properly executed
closing documents, including a dismissal with prejudice as to the entire case.
(Wend Decl., Exh. A; Kjar Decl., Exh. C.)
According to Defendants’ counsel, they sent
Plaintiffs the release documents on or about June 5, 2023.  (Wend Decl., ¶ 7 & Exh. D; Kjar Decl., ¶
7 & Exh. D.)
On June 22, 2023, Plaintiffs’ counsel filed a
Notice of Settlement of Entire Case.
According to Defendants’ counsel, however, Plaintiffs
and their counsel did not execute the release sent by Defendants’ counsel (or
propose any other or different release terms). 
(Wend Decl., ¶¶ 7-9; Kjar Decl., ¶¶ 9-10.)
On November 30, 2023, Plaintiffs’ counsel
filed motions to be relieved as counsel, stating that counsel and Plaintiffs “have
come to a point of irreconcilable differences” regarding “the future handling
of this action.”  After a hearing on
January 4, 2024, the Court granted the motions and signed the proposed
orders.  Each of the orders, signed by
the Court, states that the orders is “effective upon the filing of the proof of
service of this signed order upon the client.” 
(Orders dated January 4, 2024, item 5(a).)
To date, Plaintiffs’ counsel has not filed a
proof of service of either of the signed orders on the client.  Instead, Plaintiffs’ counsel filed, on
January 5, a proof that the minute order – not a signed order – was served on
Plaintiffs.
On February 13, 2024, GAMC filed its motion
to enforce the settlement agreement. 
GAMC served Plaintiffs in pro per by mail and email.  GAMC did not serve Plaintiffs’ counsel.  
On February 15, 2024, Keushkerian filed his
motion to enforce the settlement agreement. 
Keushkerian served Plaintiffs’ counsel by email and served Plaintiffs in
pro per by overnight delivery.
Both motions are set for hearing on March 14,
2024.  No opposition has been filed.
Legal Standard
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6 provides: 
(a) If parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a
writing signed by the parties outside the presence of the court or orally
before the court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon
motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement. If
requested by the parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties to
enforce the settlement until performance in full of the terms of the
settlement. 
(b) For purposes of this section, a
writing is signed by a party if it is signed by any of the following:
(1) The party.
(2) An attorney who represents the party.
(3) If the party is an insurer, an agent
who is authorized in writing by the insurer to sign on the insurer's behalf. 
Because of the summary nature of a proceeding to enforce a
settlement agreement under section 664.6, and because settlement of a lawsuit
implicates a substantial right of a litigant, strict compliance with the
statutory requirements is required.  (J.B.B.
Investment Partners, Ltd. v. Fair (2014)
232 Cal.App.4th 974, 985; Sully-Miller Contracting Co. v.
Gledson/Cashman Construction, Inc. (2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 30, 37.) 
Before the Legislature amended the statute effective as of January 1, 2021, “parties” under section 664.6 meant the litigants
themselves, not their attorneys.  (See Levy v. Superior Court
(1995) 10 Cal.4th 578, 586.)  In any event, however, for a settlement
agreement to be enforceable under section 664.6, all “parties” (as that term is
defined in the statute) must sign, including the party seeking to enforce the
agreement and the party against whom enforcement is sought.  (J.B.B.
Investment Partners, supra, 232 Cal.App.4th at p. 985.) 
If the settlement leaves material terms wanting, or confusing, the
settlement cannot be enforced through the section 664.6 summary
proceeding.  (Compare Terry v. Conlan (2005) 131 Cal.App.4th 1445
[finding parties never agreed to the means that were material to the
settlement, including what role an independent manager was to play regarding
management of a trust property, and whether the trust should be qualified as a QTIP,
thereby indicating that there was no meeting of the minds as to the material
terms] with Osumi v. Sutton (2007) 151 Cal.App.4th 1355 [holding trial
court’s decision to extend closing date for vendor’s agreement to repurchase
house did not create a material term and was within court’s power because the
closing date had passed by the time the motions came on for hearing and a new
closing date was necessary to grant the relief sought by both parties].)  Nonetheless, when the “parties intend that an agreement be
binding, the fact that a more formal agreement must be prepared and executed
does not alter the validity of the agreement.” (Blix St.
Records, Inc. v. Cassidy (2010)
191 CA4th 39, 48.)  
It is possible for parties to have an
enforceable settlement agreement that is not subject to the summary enforcement
proceedings of section 664.6 (including, for example, an
enforceable oral agreement to settle or an agreement that is signed by an
authorized representative who has the power to bind the party but is not listed
in subdivision (b) of the statute).  In
those circumstances, a party seeking to enforce the agreement must proceed
through other means, such as a separate civil action, an amendment to the
answer to add a new affirmative defense, and/or a motion for summary judgment,
rather than through the summary procedures of section 664.6.  (See generally Weddington Productions v.
Flick (1998) 60 Cal.App.4th 793, 809 [“Section 664.6 was enacted to provide
a summary procedure for specifically enforcing a settlement contract without
the need for a new lawsuit.”].)
In ruling on a motion brought under Code of
Civil Procedure section 664.6, the court acts as a trier of fact.  The court may consider any admissible
evidence, including documents, declarations, and oral testimony.  (Kohn v. Jaymar-Ruby, Inc. (1994) 23
Cal.App.4th 1530, 1533; 3 Weil & Brown, California Practice Guide: Civil
Procedure Before Trial (2023), ¶¶ 12:977-12:978.6.)
Discussion
Before reaching the merits of Defendants’
motions, the Court must address some uncertainty in the record regarding the
status of Plaintiffs’ representation.  
On January 4, 2024, the Court granted the
motions of Plaintiffs’ counsel to be relieved as counsel.  The orders signed by the Court state that
each order is “effective upon the filing of the proof of service of this signed
order upon the client.”  (Orders dated
January 4, 2024, item 5(a).)
The Court has reviewed its records and does
not see any proof of service on Plaintiffs of the orders signed on January 4,
2024.  All that is in the file is a proof
that the Court’s minute order (which is not a signed order) on Plaintiffs.  That alone is not sufficient.
As a result, there may well be some (understandable)
confusion as between Plaintiffs and Plaintiffs’ counsel regarding the status of
their representation.  Given the
important rights that are at stake in a motion brought under Code of Civil
Procedure section 664.6, the issues relating to the representation of
Plaintiffs must be resolved before the Court proceeds to address the merits.
Accordingly, the Court continues the hearing
on these motions for approximately 30 days to allow Plaintiffs and Plaintiffs’
counsel to address the issues regarding the status of their representation.  
If Plaintiffs’ counsel continues to represent
Plaintiffs, then GAMC must serve its motion on Plaintiffs’ counsel.  
If Plaintiffs’ counsel files a proof of
service of the signed orders of January 4, 2024, and thereby makes effective
the orders granting the motions to withdraw, then Plaintiffs (either representing
themselves or with new counsel) may file and serve any oppositions to the two
motions by no later than nine court days prior to the new hearing date.  Defendants may file and serve any replies no
later than five court days prior to the new hearing date.
Conclusion
The Court CONTINUES the motions to enforce
the settlement agreement for approximately 30 days. 
Moving Parties is ORDERED to give notice,
including to Plaintiffs and Plaintiffs’ counsel.
