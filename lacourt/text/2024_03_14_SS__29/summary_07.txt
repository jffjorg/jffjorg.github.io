Here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The defendant, Noreen Marie Dimster-Denk, has moved to strike the punitive damages allegations in the plaintiff, Jose Sanchez's, complaint. The plaintiff alleges that the defendant was driving under the influence and negligent, resulting in the plaintiff's injuries. The court has reviewed the complaint and finds that it lacks specific factual allegations to support the claim for punitive damages. The court has granted the defendant's motion to strike with leave to amend, allowing the plaintiff to plead specific facts showing the defendant's guilt of malice, oppression, or fraud. The court has struck the reference to punitive damages in the complaint and granted the defendant leave to notice the plaintiff of the amendment.
