The defendant, Silfred Lopez Duarte, filed a motion to compel the plaintiff, Juan Francisco Segura Barrientos, to respond to special interrogatories and requests for production of documents. The defendant served the plaintiff with discovery on November 30, 2023, but the plaintiff did not respond. The court finds that the defendant has shown that the plaintiff failed to respond to the discovery requests and has waived all objections. Therefore, the court grants the defendant's motion to compel and orders the plaintiff to serve verified, code-compliant, written responses to the special interrogatories and requests for production of documents within 14 days of notice.
