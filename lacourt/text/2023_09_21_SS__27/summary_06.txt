## English Summary

The Judge has reviewed the arguments from both parties regarding the Defendant's responses to interrogatories. While the Plaintiff wants complete answers, the Defendant seeks to protect some information with a protective order. 

The Judge believes that the appropriate way to handle this dispute is not through a motion to compel, but rather through a motion to compel further responses and a separate statement requirement.  The Judge emphasizes that, under the Eighth Amended Standing Order, any motion to compel further responses in this type of court requires the parties to first participate in an Informal Discovery Conference.
