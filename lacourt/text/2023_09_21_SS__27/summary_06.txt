The Judge's tentative ruling addresses the dispute over the interrogatories and the request for a protective order by the Defendant. The Judge holds that a motion to compel further responses and its separate statement requirement are more suitable vehicles to resolve this discovery dispute, given that the Defendant has already provided responses. The Judge also notes that the Plaintiff should review the Eighth Amended Standing Order if they wish to compel further responses from the Defendant. Furthermore, the Judge rules that a court in the Personal Injury Court System will not hear a motion to compel further responses unless the parties participate in an Informal Discovery Conference.
