And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge Kerry Bensinger in a case between Shalia Gibson and Burlington Coat Factory of Texas, Inc. The case is about a slip and fall on the defendant's premises in 2019, and the plaintiff is seeking damages. The defendant filed a motion for a protective order against the plaintiff's special interrogatories, set one, and also requested sanctions against the plaintiff and her counsel. The judge finds that the defendant has already provided responses to the interrogatories, so the motion for a protective order is moot. The judge denies the motion and orders the defendant to give notice.
