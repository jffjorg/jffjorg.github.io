[1] Erroneously sued as Burlington
Coat Factory, Burlington Coat Factory Warehouse Corporation, and Burlington
Coat Factory Direct Corporation (Doe 21).


[2] The parties argue the merits of
the interrogatories for which Defendant seeks a protective order.  A motion to compel further responses and its
separate statement requirement are better vehicles to adjudicate this discovery
dispute given that Defendant has provided responses.  Should Plaintiff seek to compel
further responses from Defendant, Plaintiff is directed to review the Eighth
Amended Standing Order.  A court in the
Personal Injury Court System will not hear a motion to compel further unless
and until the parties participate in an Informal Discovery Conference.
