## Tentative Ruling Summary: Hernandez et al. v. Caramedix, Inc.

**Case Number:** 20STCV32190

**Hearing Date:** September 21, 2023

**Judge:** Kerry Bensinger, Department 27

**Plaintiffs:** Adrian Hernandez, Raoul Guzman, and Araseli Zuniga

**Defendant:** Caramedix, Inc.

**Subject:**

* Motion to compel Defendant Caramedix to provide a Person Most Knowledgeable (PMK) for deposition and to produce documents.
* Motions to compel further responses to Plaintiffs' discovery requests (Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, and Requests for Production of Documents).
* Request for monetary sanctions against Caramedix.

**Summary:**

The Plaintiffs are suing Caramedix, a rideshare service, for the wrongful death of their mother, Christina Garcia.  They allege Caramedix's driver failed to properly secure Garcia's wheelchair, causing her to fall and ultimately die.

The Court finds that Caramedix has unreasonably delayed providing a PMK for deposition and responsive documents.  The Court finds Caramedix's objections to the discovery requests meritless and orders them to provide complete and verified responses to all outstanding discovery within 10 days.

The Court also grants Plaintiffs' request for monetary sanctions against Caramedix in the amount of $2,480, due to their unsuccessful opposition to these motions.

**Key Points:**

* **Discovery Disputes:** Plaintiffs successfully compelled Caramedix to provide a PMK for deposition and responsive documents. They also compelled Caramedix to provide complete and verified answers to their outstanding discovery requests.
* **Sanctions:** The Court imposed monetary sanctions on Caramedix for their unsuccessful opposition to the Plaintiffs' discovery motions.
* **Next Steps:** Caramedix is ordered to provide a PMK for deposition and complete discovery responses within 10 days. They must also pay sanctions of $2,480 within 30 days.
