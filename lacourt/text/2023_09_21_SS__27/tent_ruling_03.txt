MOTION
TO COMPEL DEFENDANT CARAMEDIX, INC.’S PERSON MOST KNOWLEDGEABLE DEPOSITION
& PRODUCTION OF RECORDS
 
MOTIONS
TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES TO DISCOVERY



 
MOVING PARTY:               Plaintiffs
Adrian Hernandez, Raoul Guzman, and Araseli Zuniga
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     Defendant Caramedix,
Inc.
 
 
I.          BACKGROUND
 
            On August 24, 2020, Plaintiffs, Adrian Hernandez, Raoul
Guzman, and Araseli Zuniga, initiated this wrongful death action against
Defendant, Caramedix, Inc. (“Caramedix”), arising from a motor vehicle incident.  Defendant is a health care rideshare
service.  Plaintiffs, the children of
Decedent, Christina Garcia, allege that Caramedix’s driver failed to properly
restrain Decedent’s wheelchair in their rideshare van.  The driver abruptly stopped while transporting
Decedent, causing Decedent to fall and suffer injuries and ultimately resulting
in her death. 
 
            On August 22,
2023, Plaintiffs filed a motion to compel Caramedix to provide their person
most knowledgeable (PMK) for deposition and to produce documents.  Plaintiff seeks sanctions against
Caramedix.  
 
            On August
25, 2023, Plaintiffs filed motions to compel Caramedix’s further responses to
Plaintiffs’ Form Interrogatories, Set One, Special Interrogatories, Set One,
and Requests for Production of Documents, Set One.  Plaintiff also seeks sanctions against
Caramedix in connection with these motions.
 
            Caramedix
has filed oppositions to the foregoing motions. 
Plaintiffs have filed an omnibus reply.
 
            As Caramedix
opposes all the foregoing motions on the same basis, the Court addresses
Plaintiffs’ motion to compel Caramedix’s PMK deposition and motions to compel
further discovery responses together.
 
II.        LEGAL STANDARDS 
 
Compel PMK Deposition
 
Any party may obtain discovery by
taking in California the oral deposition of any person.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2025.010.)  “If, after service of a deposition notice, a party to the action…without
having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails to appear for
examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for inspection any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the
deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move for an order compelling
the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the production for inspection of
any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in
the deposition notice.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd.
(a).)   
 
            Compel
Further Responses to Discovery
 
            Under
Code of Civil Procedure sections 2030.300 and 2031.310, parties may move for a
further response to interrogatories and requests for production of documents
where an answer to the requests are evasive or incomplete or where an objection
is without merit or too general.¿ A motion to compel further response to
requests for production “shall set forth specific facts showing good cause
justifying the discovery sought by the inspection demand.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.310, subd. (b)(1).)¿¿ 
¿ 
Notice of the motions must be
given within 45 days of service of the verified response, otherwise, the
propounding party waives any right to compel a further response.¿ (Code Civ.
Proc., §§ 2030.300, subd. (c); 2031.310, subd. (c).)¿ The motions must also be
accompanied by a meet and confer declaration.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300,
subd. (c); 2031.310, subd. (c).)¿¿ 
¿ 
Finally, Cal. Rules of Court, Rule
3.1345 requires that all motions or responses involving further discovery
contain a separate statement with the text of each request, the response, and a
statement of factual and legal reasons for compelling further responses.¿ (Cal.
Rules of Court, Rule 3.1345, subd. (a)(3).)¿ 
¿ 
            Monetary
Sanctions¿ 
¿ 
            Code
of Civil Procedure section 2023.030 is a general statute authorizing the Court
to impose discovery sanctions for “misuse of the discovery process,” which
includes (without limitation) a variety of conduct such as: making, without
substantial justification, an unmeritorious objection to discovery; making an
evasive response to discovery; and unsuccessfully and without substantial
justification making or opposing a motion to compel or limit discovery.¿ (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2023.010.)¿¿ 
¿ 
            If
sanctions are sought, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.040 requires that
the notice specify the identity of the person against whom sanctions are sought
and the type of sanction requested, that the motion be supported in the points
and authorities, and the facts be set forth in a declaration supporting the
amount of any monetary sanction.¿¿¿¿ 
 
            “If
a motion under [Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.450] subdivision (a) is
granted, the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing
with Section 2023.010) in favor of the party who noticed the deposition and
against the deponent or the party with whom the deponent is affiliated, unless
the court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial
justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction
unjust.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (g)(1).)¿¿¿¿ 
 
            With
regard to a motion to compel further responses to interrogatories and requests
for production, Code of Civil Procedure sections 2030.290 and 2031.310 provide
that sanctions shall be awarded against any party, person or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel further responses, unless
the Court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial
justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of sanctions
unjust.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (c); 2031.310, subd. (h).) 
 
III.      DISCUSSION
 
            Compel
PMK Depo    
 
            Plaintiffs
properly noticed Caramedix’s PMK deposition on four occasions and Caramedix has
yet to produce a person most knowledgeable for deposition or the documents
requested in the deposition notice.  Caramedix
argues this motion should be denied for two reasons.  First, defense counsel has finally identified
Caramedix’s person(s) most knowledgeable and will work with plaintiffs’ counsel
to complete the deposition.  Further,
Caramedix agrees to provide responses to the production requests.  As such, counsel for Caramedix does not
oppose producing a PMK for deposition or providing responsive documents.  Second, the deposition categories are overbroad
and not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible
evidence.  
 
            Both
arguments fail.  No doubt, complications
with one’s client, complicate matters, but do present a defense and is little
solace to opposing counsel.  Plaintiffs
have tried to schedule Caramedix’s PMK deposition since December of 2021.  Plaintiffs are entitled to this
discovery.  Given this history, a Court
order is warranted.
 
            Second, Caramedix’s
objections to the deposition categories are boilerplate and lack merit.  The PMK categories seek basic information
that is relevant to the prosecution of this case, such as information about the
incident, the driver’s employment status, driving history, and training, policies
and procedures for securing wheel-chair bound clients, the condition of the
subject transport van, and communications and reports regarding the
incident.  These categories are
reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence; they are
not overbroad. 
 
            Based on
the foregoing, Plaintiffs are entitled to an order compelling Caramedix to
provide person(s) most knowledgeable for deposition and to provide responsive
documents to the documents requested in the deposition notice.  
 
            Compel
Further Responses to Discovery[1]
 
            Plaintiffs
seek further responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One, Nos. 12.1-12.3, 15.1, and
16.1-16.5,[2]
Special Interrogatories, Set One, Nos. 1-4, 6-14, 16-22, 24-31, and 33- 35, and
Requests for Production of Documents, Set One, Nos. 2, 3, 7-11, 13, 16-17,
19-20, 28-30, 33-35, 41, 43, 45-53, and 54-56. 

 
            Caramedix
argues these motions should be denied for the same reasons discussed
above.  Defense counsel lost contact with
Caramedix’s representative and could not obtain verifications for the discovery
responses.  The argument lacks
merit.  Defense counsel’s inability to
contact their client has no bearing on whether Plaintiffs are entitled to discovery
sought.  Given that Plaintiffs propounded
this discovery on December 20, 2021, it is not clear Caramedix will provide
responses to Plaintiffs’ discovery absent a court order.  For the reasons indicated herein, Plaintiffs
are entitled to objection-free, verified responses.
 
            1. Form
Interrogatories
            
            Section
2030.220(a) requires responses to each interrogatory “to the extent possible”
which are “as complete and straightforward as the information reasonably
available” to the responding party.¿ 
 
            Here, Caramedix
asserted meritless objections and incomplete responses to the Form Interrogatories.¿
Such responses are not code compliant.¿ The Form Interrogatories are not
overbroad.  To the extent Caramedix
asserts an objection based on privilege, Caramedix has not provided a privilege
log showing that Plaintiffs’ discovery request intrudes upon the
privilege.  
¿ 
            Accordingly,
the motion is GRANTED as to Form Interrogatories, Set One, Nos. 12.1-12.3,
15.1, and 16.1-16.5.
 
            2.  Special Interrogatories
 
            Caramedix
asserted meritless objections to the Special Interrogatories.  Such responses are not code compliant.  The Special Interrogatories are sufficiently
limited and not overbroad.  To the extent
Caramedix asserts an objection based on privilege, Caramedix has not provided a
privilege log showing that Plaintiffs’ discovery request intrudes upon the
privilege.  Further, Caramedix’s objections based on the intrusion of
privacy of the driver involved in the underlying incident also lack merit.  The assertion of privacy does not overcome
the relevancy of the information sought (driving history and contact
information of the driver).
 
            Accordingly,
the motion is GRANTED as to Special Interrogatories, Set One, Nos. 1-4, 6-14,
16-22, 24-31, and 33- 35.
 
            3.  Request for Production of Documents
            
            Caramedix
asserted meritless objections to the Requests for Production.  Such responses are not code compliant.  The production requests seek relevant
information that are sufficiently limited in time and scope.  To the extent Caramedix asserts an objection
based on privilege, Caramedix has not provided a privilege log showing that
Plaintiffs’ discovery request intrudes upon the privilege.  
 
            Accordingly,
the motion is GRANTED as to Request for Production of Documents, Set One, Nos. 2,
3, 7-11, 13, 16-17, 19-20, 28-30, 33-35, 41, 43, 45-53, and 54-56.
 
            Monetary
Sanctions
 
            Plaintiffs
seek sanctions against Caramedix in connection with the foregoing motions.  As Caramedix has unsuccessfully opposed these
motions, sanctions are warranted.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2025.450, subd. (g)(1); 2030.290,
subd. (c); 2031.310, subd. (h).) Accordingly, sanctions are imposed
against Caramedix in the total sum of $2,480, consisting of 4 hours at
plaintiffs’ counsel’s hourly rate, 2 hours at plaintiffs’ counsel’s paralegal’s
hourly rate, and $180 in filing fees.
 
IV.       CONCLUSION 
 
The motion to compel the deposition of Defendant Caramedix,
Inc.’s person most knowledgeable and to produce documents responsive to the
documents requested in the deposition notice is granted.  Caramedix is ordered to provide person(s)
most knowledgeable for deposition and responsive documents to the deposition
notice within 10 days of this order.
 
The motions to compel further responses to discovery are
granted.  Caramedix is ordered to provide
verified, objection-free responses to Plaintiffs’ Form Interrogatories, Set
One, Nos. 12.1-12.3, 15.1, and 16.1-16.5, Special Interrogatories, Set One,
Nos. 1-4, 6-14, 16-22, 24-31, and 33- 35, and Request for Production of
Documents, Set One, Nos. 2, 3, 7-11, 13, 16-17, 19-20, 28-30, 33-35, 41, 43,
45-53, and 54-56 within 10 days of this order.
 
The request for sanctions is granted.  Caramedix is order to pay $2,480 in sanctions
to Plaintiffs, by and through their counsel, within 30 days of this order.
 
Moving party to give notice.
