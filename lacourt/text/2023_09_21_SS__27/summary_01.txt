## English Summary

Judge Kerry Bensinger has tentatively ruled to grant Michael S. Trabish's request to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff Hares Fazli.  The judge found that Trabish's motion complied with the required legal procedures. 

The basis for Trabish's request is that Fazli has expressed distrust and negativity toward him, refusing to communicate since January 2023.  Fazli made these negative statements about Trabish to other attorneys during a meeting in July 2023. 

Because there is no evidence of resulting prejudice to Fazli, the Judge found that granting the motion was appropriate.  The ruling will become final unless a party objects before the hearing on September 21, 2023.
