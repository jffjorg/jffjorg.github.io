## English Summary

Judge Kerry Bensinger issued a tentative ruling in the case of Patricia Knox against Rosalind and Akindeji Wesey.  

The case involves a settlement agreement where Knox, a person with a disability, will receive $300,000.  $15,549.38 of this will be used for medical expenses, $120,000 for attorney's fees, $67,886.36 for other expenses, and the remaining $112,113.64 will be placed in a special needs trust to benefit Knox.

While the Judge finds the settlement fair and reasonable,  the proposed trust agreement needs revisions to comply with California law and court rules. The Judge identified several issues:

* The trust document doesn't specify how the trustee will report its activities to the court.
* The document lacks a clause requiring court approval for certain financial actions like borrowing, lending, or transferring property.
*  It includes a provision for distributing remaining trust assets to a named individual upon Knox's death, which is considered improper estate planning for someone with incapacities. 
* The document doesn't specify a bond amount, which is required for non-corporate trustees.  

The Judge is continuing the case to October 27, 2023, giving the Petitioner time to address these issues and file revised documents.
