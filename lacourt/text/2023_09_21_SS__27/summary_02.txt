## English Summary

Judge Kerry Bensinger issued a tentative ruling in the case of Patricia Knox against Rosalind and Akindeji Wesey.  

The case involves a settlement agreement where Knox, a person with a disability, will receive $300,000.  $15,549.38 of this will be used for medical expenses, $120,000 for attorney's fees, $67,886.36 for other expenses, and the remaining $112,113.64 will be placed in a special needs trust to benefit Knox.

While the Judge finds the settlement fair and reasonable,  the proposed trust agreement needs revisions to comply with California law and court rules. The Judge identified several issues:

* The trust document doesn't specify how the trustee will report its activities to the court.
* The document lacks a clause requiring court approval for certain financial actions like borrowing, lending, or transferring property.
*  It includes a provision for distributing remaining trust assets to a named individual upon Knox's death, which is considered improper estate planning for someone with incapacities. 
* The document doesn't specify a bond amount, which is required for non-corporate trustees.  

The Judge is continuing the case to October 27, 2023, giving the Petitioner time to address these issues and file revised documents.

Additionally, the court finds that the Petitioner has not filed proof of service demonstrating notification of the required state agencies.

The Court finds the settlement fair and reasonable, but the proposed trust instrument and order need revisions. 

Specifically, the Court identified issues with the proposed trust instrument's compliance with court rules regarding trustee reporting and financial actions, as well as the Joinder Agreement's beneficiary inheritance provisions. 

The Court also determined that a bond is required for the trustee and that the proposed order lacks crucial elements related to trust administration and court oversight. 

The hearing is continued to allow the Petitioner to address these deficiencies and file revised documents.

Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

Judge Kerry Bensinger has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Patricia Knox v. Rosalind Wesey, et al. (Case No. 20STCV02815). The case involves a settlement agreement in which Patricia Knox, a person with a disability, agrees to settle her claims against defendants Rosalind and Akindeji Wesey in exchange for $300,000. The settlement funds will be used to pay for medical expenses, attorney's fees, and other expenses, with a balance of $112,113.64 to be paid or transferred to a special needs trust established under Probate Code section 3604.

However, Judge Bensinger's tentative ruling finds that the proposed trust instrument does not meet the requirements of CRC rule 7.903(c)(6) and LASC rule 4.116(b)(4). Specifically, the proposed trust instrument does not provide for the trustee to file accounts and reports for court approval, and it does not contain a term prohibiting the trustee from borrowing money or lending money without prior authorization of the court. Additionally, the proposed joinder agreement contains a deficient term providing that upon Patricia Knox's death, any assets remaining in the trust account shall be paid to a named individual, rather than to her heirs at law.

The tentative ruling also finds that a bond is required for the trustee, Legacy Enhancement, and that the proposed bond calculation is inadequate. Finally, the proposed order is deficient for several reasons, including lack of trust terms, continued court jurisdiction, and failure to require a first trust accounting and notice of commencement of proceedings.

The case is continued to October 27, 2023, at 1:30 p.m., and Patricia Knox's guardian ad litem, Danny Barnes, is directed to file a revised trust instrument, joinder agreement, proposed order, and proof of service consistent with this order no later than five court days before the rescheduled hearing.
