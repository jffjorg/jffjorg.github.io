MOTION
FOR PROTECTIVE ORDER
      


 
MOVING PARTY:               Defendant
Burlington Coat Factory of Texas, Inc.
 
RESPONDING PARTY:      Plaintiff Shalia Gibson
            
 
I.          INTRODUCTION 
 
On November 10, 2021, Plaintiff, Shalia Gibson, initiated
this action against Defendant, Burlington Coat Factory of Texas, Inc.,[1]
for injuries arising from a slip and fall on Defendant’s premises.  Plaintiff alleges that on December 9, 2019, she
slipped and fell over a small bench on the floor in the shoe department of
Defendant’s store in Hawthorne, California.
 
On June 21, 2023, Plaintiff served Defendant with Special
Interrogatories, Set One.  The discovery
set consists of 52 interrogatories.  Defense
counsel found several of the interrogatories to be objectionable.  On July 21, 2023, defense counsel attempted
to meet and confer with plaintiff’s counsel regarding the interrogatories and
requested that the improper interrogatories be withdrawn.  Plaintiff’s counsel refused.  
 
On July 28, 2023, Defendant served objection-only responses
to the discovery.  On the same date,
Defendant filed this motion for a protective order against Plaintiff’s Special
Interrogatories.  Defendant also requests
sanctions against Plaintiff and her counsel of record.
 
II.        DISCUSSION
 
When propounded with Plaintiff’s discovery, Defendant had
two options: move for a protective order or provide responses.  “It is not necessary to seek
a protective order to avoid answering interrogatories that are truly ‘burdensome
and oppressive.’ The responding party can simply object on
this ground.”  (Weil & Brown, Cal.
Prac. Guide Civ. Pro. Before Trial (The Rutter Group 2023), ¶ 8:1022.) 
Here, however, Defendant did both.  Given
that Defendant has provided responses to Plaintiff’s Special Interrogatories,
Set One, the burden shifts to Plaintiff to seek a further response.  As such, the Court finds Defendant’s motion
for a protective order is moot.[2]  
                                                            
IiI.       CONCLUSION
 
            The motion is denied as moot.  
 
Moving party to give notice.
