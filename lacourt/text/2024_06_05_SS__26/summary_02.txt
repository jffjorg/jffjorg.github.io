```

And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

"The Defendant's motion to vacate the default and default judgment is granted. The Defendant is to file and serve a proposed verified answer within 20 days of this order. The Court finds that the Defendant's failure to receive notice of the action and the Plaintiff's counsel's failure to inform the Defendant's counsel of the default constitute equitable grounds for relief. The Defendant's answer, which was filed after the default was entered, is accepted for filing and will be considered as a timely filing. The Court's finding of equitable relief is based on the Defendant's meritorious case, satisfactory excuse for not presenting a defense, and diligence in seeking to set aside the default once the mistake was discovered."
