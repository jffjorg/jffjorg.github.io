ANALYSIS:
 
Plaintiffs Eduardo Tiempo, Gary Rand & Suzanne E.
Rand-Lewis, Professional Law
Corporations (“Plaintiffs”) filed the instant action against
Defendants Finchey Corporation of California dba Pacific BMW, David Ho, Arsen
Dagbashyan, Sevak Adamyan, and Andy Adamyan (“Defendants”) on December 11,
2022. The action alleges causes of action for (1) breach of express contract;
(2) constructive trust; (3) unjust enrichment; (4) violation of Business and
Professions Code § 17200; and (5) interference with prospective economic
advantage & business relations. Defendants filed an answer on January 19,
2023. 
 
On February 14, 2024, Defendants filed the instant Motion
for Sanctions. Plaintiffs filed an opposition on April 11, 2024 and Defendants
replied with evidentiary objections on April 17, 2024. 
 
At the hearing on April 24, 2024, the Court continued the
hearing to June 5, 2024 and set an “Order to Show Cause why counsel for
Plaintiff and counsel for Defendant should not each be sanctioned in the amount
of $250 pursuant to California Rules of Court, Rule 2.30 and Los Angeles County
Court Rules, Rule 3.10 for failure to file a Notice of Related Case as required
by California Rules of Court, Rule 3.300 and Los Angeles County Court Rules,
Rule 3.3(f).” (Minute Order, 04/24/24.) On the same date, Defendants filed a
Notice of Related Case with respect to Tiempo v. Finchey Corp., LASC
Case No. 21STCV32444 (“Case No. 21STCV32444”). The next day, on April 25, 2024,
Plaintiffs filed an opposition to the Notice of Related Case, to which
Defendants filed a reply. The same papers were filed in Case No. 21STCV32444. 
 
On May 16, 2024, following a discussion with counsel
regarding the status of the case, the Court discharged the Order to Show Cause.
(Minute Order, 05/16/24.) However, no ruling on the Notice of Related Case has
been issued yet by Department 3 in the Stanley Mosk Courthouse, where Case No. 21STCV32444
is assigned. Accordingly, the hearing on the Motion for Sanction is again
continued to September 4, 2024 at 10:00 am in Department 26 in the Spring
Street Courthouse.
