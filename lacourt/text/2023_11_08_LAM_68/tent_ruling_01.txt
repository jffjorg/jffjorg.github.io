to Amend Complaint

Greater
Fountain of Life Church of God in Christ vs. Sedgwick McCray; 21STCV32068
Moving
Party: Plaintiff Greater Fountain of Life Church of God in Christ

­­­­­­­­­BACKGROUND
            Plaintiff Greater Fountain of Life
Church of God in Christ (Plaintiff) filed this action on August 30, 2021. This
case involves Defendant Sedgwick McCray’s (Defendant) alleged failure to
transfer title of a property to Plaintiff. Plaintiff alleges that it learned
new information in the last six months that requires it to add three causes of
action to its complaint. The new causes of action are adverse possession,
unjust enrichment, and declaratory relief. Plaintiff brings this motion pursuant
to CCP § 473(a)(1). The trial is set for December 18, 2023. No opposition to
Plaintiff’s motion has been filed.
LEGAL STANDARD AND ANALYSIS
            This court is authorized, in its
discretion, to “allow, upon any terms as may be just, an amendment to any
pleading or proceeding in other particulars . . .” (CCP § 473(a)(1).) CCP §
576, likewise, provides that “any judge, at any time before or after
commencement of trial, in the furtherance of justice, and upon such terms as
may be proper, may allow the amendment to any pleading . . .” (CCP § 576.) The
determination of whether to grant leave to file an amended pleading rests in
the court’s sound discretion.
            Leave to amend is to be liberally
granted at any stage in the proceedings, up to and including trial. (Magpali
v. Farmers Group, Inc. (1986) 48 Cal.App.4th 471, 487; see also County
of Sanitation Dist. No. 2 of Los Angeles County v. Kern County (2005) 127
Cal.App.4th 1544, 1618 (noting that a plaintiff may be granted amendment even
at the time of trial).) To overcome the policy of liberally granting amendments
at any stage of litigation, a defendant must show both actual prejudice and
inexcusable delay. (Magpali, 48 Cal.App.4th at 487.)
            In this case, Plaintiff requested
leave to amend after recently learning new information related to the case. While
the trial is just over a month away, Defendant has not filed any opposition to
Plaintiff’s motion. Amendments to pleadings are to be liberally granted, up to
and including at trial.
            Therefore, the Court grants
Plaintiff’s motion for leave to amend complaint.
ORDER
1.      Plaintiff’s
motion for leave to amend complaint is GRANTED.
