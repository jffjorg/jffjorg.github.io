And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion from the plaintiff, Greater Fountain of Life Church of God in Christ, to amend its complaint to add three new causes of action: adverse possession, unjust enrichment, and declaratory relief. The plaintiff alleges that it recently learned new information that requires these new causes of action. The defendant, Sedgwick McCray, has not opposed the motion. The court finds that leave to amend is to be liberally granted at any stage in the proceedings, and since the defendant has not shown actual prejudice or inexcusable delay, the court grants the plaintiff's motion for leave to amend its complaint.
