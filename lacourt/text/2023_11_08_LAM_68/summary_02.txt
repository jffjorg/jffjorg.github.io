Summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling:

The Court has ruled that the motions filed by Content Checked Holdings, Inc. (CCH) are moot in light of the previous ruling that CCH has unclean hands and is in pari delicto. The Court has denied CCH's motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, new trial, and prejudgment interest.

CCH's motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict is denied because the collateral source rule does not apply in this case. The Court has also denied CCH's motion for new trial on the issue of the value of the shares of stock given to Finstad, finding that the jury correctly concluded that the value of the shares was zero.

CCH's motion for new trial on the issue of the summary judgment order granted in favor of RBSM, LLP in 2020 is also denied. The Court has found that the award for the services rendered by RBSM, LLP is not affected by the fact that CCH defrauded the accountant by providing a forged bank statement.

Finally, the Court has denied CCH's motion for prejudgment interest because the amount of damages was only determinable until the parties obtained the verdict of the jury.
