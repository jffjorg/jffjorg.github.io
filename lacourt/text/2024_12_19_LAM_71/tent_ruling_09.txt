  vs.
 
WHOLESALE PARTS DISTRIBUTOR LLC, et al.


 Case
  No.:  24STCV05805
 
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  December 19, 2024



 

Plaintiff Cathay Bank’s Request for Default Judgment
          Having considered all documents submitted in support of a default
judgment, the Court rules as follows:
 
Background
On March 8, 2024, Cathay Bank
(“Plaintiff”) filed its operative Complaint against Defendants Wholesale Parts
Distributor, LLC, and Eun Sook Min (collectively, “Defendants”) for breach of
written promissory note and business loan agreement, breach of written
guaranty, money lent, open book account, account stated, and indebtedness.
On August 29, 2024, the clerk
entered default against Wholesale Parts Distributor, LLC, and Eun Sook Min.  On September 30, 2024, Plaintiff filed a
Request for Court Judgment to be heard on December 19, 2024.
 
Party’s Request
Plaintiff requests the Court to enter a
default judgment against Defendants and award Plaintiff a judgment of $43,894.69
consisting of $35,000.00 in damages, $16.41 in late charges, $6,571.58 in
prejudgment interest, $866.70 in costs, and $1,440.00 in attorneys’ fees. 
Unfortunately, Plaintiff’s JUD-100 and
CIV-100 forms incorrectly note that attorneys’ fees are sought in the amount of
“$1,4400.00.”  This error needs to be
corrected before this Court can enter judgment; otherwise Plaintiff’s submitted
documents are correct.
 
Discussion
Plaintiff submitted a
completed default judgment packet, with all applicable attachments. The Court
finds sufficient evidence to justify the requested award and grants Plaintiff Cathay
Bank’s request in full.
 
Conclusion
The application for default
judgment filed on September 30, is granted. 
Judgment of $43,894.69
is entered
against Defendants Wholesale Parts Distributor, LLC, and Eun Sook Min.
Plaintiff is ordered to give notice of
this ruling.
