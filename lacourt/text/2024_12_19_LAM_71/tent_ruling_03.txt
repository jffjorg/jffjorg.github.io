[1] Plaintiff does not provide a clear summary of the
attorneys’ hourly rates or their total hours incurred.  Plaintiff merely provides each time keeper’s total
fees; this does not provide for a breakdown of the values necessary to
calculate the lodestar rate.  (See
Decl. of Pitchford, Exh. C at pg. 5.) 
Plaintiff’s brief summary obfuscates the hours worked by each attorney
and the rate at which they charged for such work.  This is puzzling because the copious
information and detailed records available to counsel, Plaintiff should have
been able to easily present this information in a straightforward manner.  In fact, there are column headers in
Plaintiff’s Exhibit C for each time keeper’s rate and hours worked; there is no
reason a total could not have been calculated. 
“Courts are entitled to
assistance from counsel, and an invitation to search without guidance is no
more useful than a litigant’s request to a district court at the summary
judgment stage to paw through the assembled discovery material. ‘Judges are not
like pigs, hunting for truffles buried in’ the record. [Citation].”  (Albrechtsen
v. Board of Regents of University of Wisconsin System (2002) 309 F.3d 433, 436.)
