And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge has expressed concerns about the Plaintiff's failure to provide a clear breakdown of the attorneys' hourly rates and total hours incurred. Instead, the Plaintiff only provided the total fees for each time keeper. The Judge notes that detailed records are available, but the Plaintiff has not presented this information in a straightforward manner. The Judge is looking for assistance from the Plaintiff's counsel to provide the necessary information, citing the case of Albrechtsen v. Board of Regents of University of Wisconsin System (2002) 309 F.3d 433, 436, which states that courts are entitled to assistance from counsel and judges are not expected to search for information without guidance.
