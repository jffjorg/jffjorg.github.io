GRAYMILLS
  CORPORATION.


 Case No.: 
  21STCV32398
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  December 19, 2024



 
Plaintiff
DCK Sales, Corporation’s motion for
attorneys’ fees and costs is granted in the reduced total amount of $225,378.25,
comprised of $225,378.25 in attorneys’ fees and $0.00 in total expenses.
 
Plaintiff DCK Sales, Corporation (“DCK”)
(“Plaintiff”) moves for an order awarding it attorneys’ fees in the total
amount of $901,513, comprised of $890,013 in attorneys’ fees, including $11,500
incurred on the instant motion, and costs in the amount of $35,308 against Defendant Graymills
Corporation (“Graymills”) (“Defendant”).  (Notice of Motion, pg. 2;
Notice of Ex Parte Application, pgs. 2-3; C.C.P. §§1032, 1033.5; 820 Ill. Comp.
Stat. Ann. 120/1 et seq.)  Plaintiff
moves on the basis that this Court already ruled in its August 7, 2023, Order (“ISRA
Order”) that the Illinois Sales Representative Act (“ISRA”) applies in this
action, and Defendant has admitted to non-payment of commissions owed to Plaintiff
during the course of the action and accepted liability under the ISRA in the
$120,000 998 Offer and judgment entered on July 17, 2024 (“Judgment”).  (Notice Motion, pg. 2.)  Plaintiff moves on the basis that both the
998 Offer and the Judgment expressly preserve its right to seek its fees and costs
in this matter.  (Notice of Motion, pg. 2.)
 
CRC
Violations
CRC Rule 3.1354(b) provides in part, “[a]ll
written objections to evidence must be served and filed separately from the
other papers in support of or in opposition to the motion. Objections to
specific evidence must be referenced by the objection number in the right
column of a separate statement in opposition or reply to a motion, but the
objections must not be restated or reargued in the separate statement. Each
written objection must be numbered consecutively . . ..”  (CRC Rule
3.1354(b), emphasis added.)
Plaintiff fails to consecutively number its 73-pages
long evidentiary objections in violation of CRC Rule 3.1354(b).  The
Court noted in its July 21, 2023, ruling on ISRA Order this exact same CRC
violation by Plaintiff.  (See
8/7/23 Ruling on Submitted Matter, pgs. 1-2 of 7.)  Plaintiff has the audacity to cite to CRC Rule
3.1113(d) in its reply regarding Defendant’s overlong opposition papers.  (Reply, pg. 2 n.1.)  The Court in its discretion does not
consider Plaintiff’s evidentiary objections to (a) the Declaration of Gerald G.
Knapton (“Knapton”), (b) the Declaration of Andrew Bassak (“Bassak”), (c) the
Declaration of Kristen Shields (“Shields”), and certain exhibits thereto. 
CRC Rule 3.113(d) provides, in part, “[e]xcept
in a summary judgment or summary adjudication motion, no opening or
responding memorandum may exceed 15 pages. . . . The page limit does not
include the caption page, the notice of motion and motion, exhibits,
declarations, attachments, the table of contents, the table of authorities, or
the proof of service.”  (CRC Rule
3.113(d), emphasis added.)
Defendant’s 17-pages long opposition is in
violation of CRC Rule 3.113(d) because it exceeds the 15-page limit, and
Defendant did not apply to the court ex parte for permission to file a longer
memorandum, as allowed in CRC Rule 3.113(e). 
The Court in its discretion does not consider the pages in
excess of the 15-page limit in Defendant’s opposition.
 
           Request
for Judicial Notice
           Defendant’s
12/6/24 request for judicial notice of the ISRA (820 ILCS 120/01-120/03)
(D-RJN, Exh. 1) is granted.
 
Background
On
September 1, 2021, Plaintiff filed its operative Complaint against Defendant
alleging eleven causes of action.  On April
3, 2024, Plaintiff accepted Defendant’s C.C.P. §998 offer of judgment for
$120,000 (“§998 Offer”).  This Court
entered Judgment on July 17, 2024 (“Judgment”).
On
September 16, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant motion.  Defendant filed its opposition on December 6,
2024.  Plaintiff filed its reply on December
12, 2024.
On
December 18, 2024, Plaintiff filed an ex parte application regarding the
instant motion.
 
Discussion
This Court ruled in the ISRA Ruling
that Illinois law and the ISRA apply to the instant action.  (See 8/7/23 Ruling on
Submitted Matter.)
This Court stated in the Judgment Pursuant
to C.C.P. §998: “Plaintiff DCK’s entitlement to and the amount of any recoverable
statutory costs pursuant to Code of Procedure section 1032, including
reasonable attorneys’ fees, if any, shall be determined by the court after
entry of this judgment in accordance with applicable law and according to
proof.”  (7/17/24 Judgment, pg. 2.)
C.C.P. §1032(a)(4) provides: 
“Prevailing party” includes the party with a net monetary recovery, a
defendant in whose favor a dismissal is entered, a defendant where neither
plaintiff nor defendant obtains any relief, and a defendant as against those
plaintiffs who do not recover any relief against that defendant. If any party
recovers other than monetary relief and in situations other than as specified,
the “prevailing party” shall be as determined by the court, and under those
circumstances, the court, in its discretion, may allow costs or not and, if
allowed, may apportion costs between the parties on the same or adverse sides
pursuant to rules adopted under Section 1034.
 
(C.C.P. §1032(a)(4).)
The ISRA provides that a principal that
fails to pay commissions due “shall pay the sales representative’s reasonable
attorney’s fees and court costs.”  (820
Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 120/3; see also C.C.P. §1033.5(10)(B).)  Under Illinois law, “a prevailing party, for
purposes of awarding attorney fees, is one that is successful on a significant
issue and achieves some benefit in bringing suit. A party that receives
judgment in his favor is usually considered the prevailing party.”  (J.B. Esker & Sons, Inc. v. Cle-Pa’s Partnership
(2001) 325 Ill.App.3d 276, 280-281.)
Here, the Judgment entered by this
Court states: 
Plaintiff DCK shall have and recover from Defendant Graymills the sum
of One Hundred Twenty Thousand Dollars and No Cents ($120,000.00) comprised of:
(a) $3,350.00 in commissions due from Defendant Graymills to Plaintiff DCK
upon Graymills’ termination of DCK as an independent sales representative for
Graymills in 2020, which amount Graymills acknowledges was not timely paid to
DCK as required by 820 ILCS 120/2, and (b) $116,650.00, in compromise of
all of Plaintiff DCK’s remaining disputed claims for unpaid commissions and interest
over the ten year period from September 1, 2011 to September 1, 2021. This
judgment amount is in full satisfaction of all of Plaintiff DCK’s claims
against Graymills, including DCK’s claims for damages any kind (including DCK’s
claim for exemplary damages per 820 ILCS 120/3), restitution, and pre-judgment
interest.
 
(7/17/24 Judgment, pgs. 1-2, emphasis added.)
           Plaintiff
recovered $3,350.00 in commissions
under its ISRA cause of action, for which it now moves for attorneys’ fees, and
$116,650.00 in compromise of Plaintiff’s remaining claims.  Accordingly, Plaintiff is the prevailing
party in this action and is entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and costs.
 
Reasonable
Fees
To calculate
a lodestar amount, the Court must first determine the reasonableness of the
hourly rates sought by Plaintiff’s counsel. The Supreme Court of California has
concluded that a reasonable hourly lodestar rate is the prevailing rate for
private attorneys “conducting non-contingent litigation of the same type.”  (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th
1122, 1133; see also Merchandise National Bank of
Chicago v. Scanlon (1980) 86 Ill.App.3d 719, 731 [adopting lodestar
computation].)
Plaintiff’s
Counsel provides the following hourly rates for attorneys who worked on this
case: (1) Evan Pitchford ($450.00/hour to $525/hour); (2) Shaahin Jafari-Moafi ($325.00/hour);
(3) Derrick Chu ($375.00/hour); (4) Eric S. Engel ($550.00/hour); (5) Alec
Pressley ($325.00/hour); (6) Raef Cogan ($350.00/hour); (7) Mark D. Kremer ($550.00/hour);
(8) John Conkle ($550.00/hour).  (See Decl. of Pitchford
¶¶5-6, 10, Exhs. A-B.)[1]  Plaintiff fails to sufficiently demonstrate his
counsel’s hourly rates are reasonable in their community of practice in their
specialized area of law.  (Decl. of Pitchford
¶¶5-6, 10, Exhs. A-B.)  Plaintiff does
not provide the training and experience of counsel other than Evan Pitchford
and Eric Engel.  (See Decl. of
Pitchford ¶¶5-6; Decl. of Engel ¶¶2-3.)
 
Billed
Hours
The party
seeking fees and costs bears the burden to show “the fees incurred were
allowable, were reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation, and were
reasonable in amount.”  (Nightingale
v. Hyundai Motor America (1994) 31 Cal.App.4th 99, 104.) To satisfy this
burden, evidence and descriptions of billable tasks must be presented in
sufficient detail, enabling the court to evaluate whether the case was
overstaffed, the time attorneys spent on specific claims, and the
reasonableness of the hours expended.  (Lunada
Biomedical v. Nunez (2014) 230 Cal.App.4th 459, 486-487.)
Plaintiff’s
counsel provides that the total number of hours billed to litigate this matter was
$1,932.10 hours.  (Decl. of Pitchford,
Exh. B at pg. 49 of 49.)  The amount of
billed hours is wildly excessive for a matter that did not involve a single
demurrer, motion for summary judgment, or any trial preparation.  Nearly 2,000 hours expended on primarily
discovery disputes and meeting and conferring regarding discovery is not
reasonable in amount.  A total of nine
noticed motions, excluding ex parte applications and the instant motion, were
filed in the instant action in the span of this case’s 951 days of existence.
Further, the
instant motion fails to provide that its counsel’s hourly rates are reasonable
in their community of practice in their specialized area of law and obfuscates
the hours incurred on the ISRA cause of action.
Plaintiff’s
request for attorneys’ fees mirrors that of the plaintiffs in Guillory v.
Hill.  In Guillory v. Hill,
the plaintiffs prevailed against the Orange County Sheriff’s Department on
their civil rights claims and were awarded less than $5,400.  (Guillory v. Hill (2019) 36 Cal.App.5th
802, 806.)  Despite the amount of this
award, Plaintiffs filed a motion for attorneys’ fees seeking nearly $3.8
million which the trial court denied.  (Id.)
 On appeal, the Court of Appeal assessed
whether the fee was reasonable based on the degree of success, the amount of
fees requested and the credibility of the supporting evidence.  (Id. at pg. 811.) The Guillory plaintiff
argued that because it did not seek “any specific amount” in the complaint, the
$5,400 award demonstrated their success.  (Id. at pg. 814.)  The Court of Appeal disagreed given that the Guillory
plaintiffs sought nearly $1 million dollars at the outset.  (Id.)  As to the amount of fees and supporting
evidence, the Guillory Court agreed that substantial evidence supported
the trial court’s conclusion that the billing records showed “overinclusive,
unculled, redundant, redacted, and padded billing entries, thereby ‘destroying
the credibility of the submission and . . . justifying a severe reduction.’” (Id.
at pgs. 814-815.) Thus, the Guillory Court affirmed the lower court’s
rejection of plaintiffs’ requests for attorney’s fees.  (Id. at pg. 816.)
Here, as in Guillory,
Plaintiff requests nearly $1 million in attorneys’ fees and costs despite only
recovering $3,350 under the ISRA.  Most
of Plaintiff’s billing entries are unrelated to the ISRA.  For example, 79 entries were for research
unrelated to the ISRA (DCK Appendix of Declarations, Exh. A at pgs. 24-25), 112
entries were for managing and organizing documents (id. at pgs. 26-27),
101 entries were for analysis and strategic planning unrelated to the ISRA (id.
at pgs. 32-33), 264 entries were for preparing or responding to discovery (id.
at pgs. 45-49), and 225 entries were just for meeting and conferring regarding
discovery issues (id. at pgs. 57-60).  None of these narrative entries make any
reference whatsoever to the ISRA nor were they labelled as ISRA-related work by
the code description.  Plaintiff failed
to allocate the entries specifically related to the ISRA to which it alleges it
is entitled.  Per the ISRA’s express
language, Plaintiff can only recover fees related to the ISRA itself—namely any
failure to pay commissions.  Therefore,
Plaintiff failed to meet its burden to demonstrate these fees were reasonable
or related to the single ISRA claim it succeeded on.
Nonetheless,
Defendant’s resistance to providing Plaintiff with Code-compliant discovery
responses were also a major factor in the unnecessarily excessive litigation in
this matter.  “A defendant cannot
litigate tenaciously and then be heard to complain about the time necessarily
spent by the plaintiff in response.”  (Peak-Las
Positas Partners v. Bollag (2009) 172 Cal.App.4th 101, 114; Serrano
v. Unruh (1982) 32 Cal.3d 621, 638.)
Balancing
these factors, the Court reduces elects to grant Plaintiff’s request for fees
but reduces them by 75%.  Accordingly, Plaintiff’s requested fees are
granted in the reduced amount of $225,378.25.
 
Costs
CRC Rule 3.1700
states, “A prevailing party who claims costs must serve and file a memorandum
of costs within 15 days after the date of service of the notice of entry of judgment
or dismissal by the clerk . . ..” (CRC 3.1700.)  It is well settled law in California that “the
omission of an item from a cost memo may be regarded as a waiver of the
prevailing party’s claim to that item.”  (Gorman
v. Tassajara Development Corp. (2009) 178 Cal.App.4th 44, 70; see also
Hotchkiss v. Smith (1895) 108 Cal. 285, 286-287[“it was incumbent upon
plaintiff to include and claim [for fees and expenses] in her cost bill, or
they were waived”].)
On August 1,
2024, Plaintiff submitted a memorandum of costs for the total amount of $19,107.63.  (8/1/24 Memorandum of Costs.)  
           Plaintiff now requests an additional $35,308 in costs not explicitly requested in Plaintiff’s memorandum of costs.  (Compare 8/1/24 Memorandum of Costs with Notice of Motion, pg. 2 n.1.)  Plaintiff
provides no explanation for why such costs were omitted from its memorandum of
costs and presents no substantive argument in its moving papers pertaining
exclusively to these $35,308 in
costs.
           Accordingly, Plaintiff’s request for
costs separate from those requested in its memorandum of costs filed on August
1, 2024, is denied.
 
Conclusion
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s motion
for attorneys’ fees is granted in the reduced total amount of $225,378.25, comprised of $225,378.25 in attorneys’ fees and
$0.00 in costs.
