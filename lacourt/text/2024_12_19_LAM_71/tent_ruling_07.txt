 Hearing Date:  December 19, 2024



 
Defendants Korea
Gardens Restaurant, Inc.’s and Kenneth Kim’s demurrer to Plaintiff No Soo Kim’ Second Amended Complaint is sustained with 20 days leave to amend as to the 4th and 6th causes of action.
 
Defendants Korean Gardens Restaurant, Inc. (“KGR”) and
Kenneth Kim (“Kenneth”) (collectively, “Defendant”) demur to the 4th and 6th
causes of action in Plaintiff No Soo Kim’s (“No Soo”) (“Plaintiff”) second
amended complaint (“SAC”).  (Notice of
Demurrer, pg. 1; C.C.P. §430.10(e).)
Defendants also move to strike portions of Plaintiff’s SAC
pertaining to punitive damages.  (Notice
of MTS, pgs. 1-2; C.C.P. §§435, 436.)
 
Request for
Judicial Notice
Defendants’ 10/15/24 request for judicial notice of (1) Pertinent
portions of 15 U.S.C. §636 (D-RJN, Exh. A); and (2) 15 U.S.C. § 9009c (D-RJN,
Exh. B), is granted.
Defendants’ 10/15/24 request for judicial notice of Plaintiff’s
Ex Parte Application for an Order for Leave to File a Second Amended Complaint,
filed and served on August 28, 2024, is denied because this Court does not need
to take judicial notice of filings on the instant docket.
 
A.   Demurrer
Meet and Confer
Before filing a demurrer, the demurring party must meet and
confer in person, by telephone, or by video conference with the party who filed
the pleading to attempt to reach an agreement that would resolve the objections
to the pleading and obviate the need for filing the demurrer.  (C.C.P. §430.41(a).)
The demurring party shall file and serve with the demurrer
a declaration stating either of the following: (A) The means by which the
demurring party met and conferred with the party who filed the pleading subject
to demurrer, and that the parties did not reach an agreement resolving the
objections raised in the demurrer. (B) That the party who filed the pleading
subject to demurrer failed to respond to the meet and confer request of the
demurring party or otherwise failed to meet and confer in good faith.  (C.C.P. §430.41(a)(3).)
Defendants’ counsel declares that on October 8, 2024, she
met and conferred with Plaintiff’s counsel by videoconference to discuss the
instant demurrer, and the parties did not reach an agreement to resolve the
issues presented in the instant demurrer. 
(See Decl. of Goldsmith ¶2.) 
Defendants’ counsel’s declaration is sufficient under C.C.P. §430.41(a).  Therefore, the Court will consider Defendants’
demurrer.
 
Procedural
Background
          Plaintiff
filed her initial Complaint against Defendants on October 7, 2022, alleging
three causes of action: (1) dissolution of partnership; (2) accounting; and (3)
declaratory relief.  On January 6, 2023,
this Court overruled Defendants’ demurrer to Plaintiff’s 3rd cause of action
for declaratory relief.  (See
1/6/23 Minute Order.)  
On February 1, 2024, the parties stipulated to an order
granting Plaintiff leave to file a first amended complaint (“FAC”).  (See 2/1/24 Stipulation.)  
Plaintiff filed her FAC against Defendants on April 25,
2024, alleging six causes of action: (1) dissolution of partnership; (2)
accounting; (3) declaratory relief; (4) conversion; (5) breach of fiduciary
duty; and (6) unjust enrichment.
On August 29, 2024, this Court granted Plaintiff’s ex parte
application for leave to file an SAC.  (See
8/29/24 Minute Order.) 
Plaintiff filed the operative SAC on September 6, 2024,
against Defendants, alleging six causes of action: (1) dissolution of
partnership; (2) accounting; (3) declaratory relief; (4) conversion; (5) breach
of fiduciary duty; and (6) unjust enrichment.
Defendants filed the instant demurrer and associated motion
to strike on October 15, 2024.  Plaintiff
filed her opposition on December 6, 2024. 
Defendants filed their reply on December 12, 2024.
 
Summary of Allegations
Plaintiff alleges that on or about April 1, 1998, in Los

Plaintiff alleges on information and belief that Kenneth is
the alter ego of KGR, that Kenneth is the sole shareholder of KGR, that KGR is
merely an instrumentality by which Kenneth conducts his personal business, that
the funds and assets of Kenneth and KGR are commingled together without regard
to which are properly corporate and which are individual, that KGR is, and has
always been grossly undercapitalized for the business it operates and the
obligations it has incurred, that Kenneth and KGR have failed to keep separate
books and records or to observe corporate formalities, and that it would be
inequitable to permit the fiction of KGR’s separate existence to continue to be
observed.  (SAC ¶6.)

Partnership.  (SAC ¶8.)  
Plaintiff alleges that pursuant to Article I of the

Capital Contribution Value”); and (b) any and all licenses and permits issued
to KGR to operate the Restaurant in the City of Los Angeles, including the
California On Sale General Liquor License (“Liquor License”).  (SAC ¶10, Exh. 2.)  Plaintiff alleges that the Partnership Agreement
states that Defendant KGR “contributed” the Real Property with “an agreed value
of $2,170,000.00, which shall be the sum of $1,000,000 and the Korean Gardens’
existing mortgage of $1,170,000 on the property with California Center Bank.” (SAC

total sum of $500,000.00 (“Additional $500,000.00 Capital”) as follows: (a) $100,000.00
in cash prior to execution of the Partnership Agreement, which Defendant KGR

of the Restaurant which sums shall be credited towards the Additional
$500,000.00 Capital; (c) one-half of all of Defendant KGR’s outstanding
accounts payables assumed by the Partnership, which sums shall be paid by the
Partnership and credited towards the Additional $500,000.00 Capital; and ( d) after
crediting all monies due under Section 2.2(1), (2), and (3), should any
remaining balance of the Additional $500,000.00 Capital be due by Plaintiff,
Plaintiff shall pay to Defendant KGR, its share of profits from the

obligation exceeding the sum of $5,000.00 that is obtained without the other
Partner's express written consent shall be charged to and collected from the
Partner who incurred the obligation.  (SAC
¶14.) 
Plaintiff alleges that pursuant to Section 3.2 of the
Partnership Agreement, the Partners agreed that the Partnership shall indemnify
the Partners for payments made and personal liabilities reasonably incurred by
them in the ordinary and proper course of the Partnership’s business or for the
preservation of the Partnership business or property.  (SAC ¶15.)  
Plaintiff alleges that pursuant to Section 4.1 of the
Partnership Agreement, the Partners agreed that the net profits or net losses
of the Partnership shall be credited or charged to the Partners in equal
proportions.  (SAC ¶16.)  Plaintiff alleges that pursuant to Section
4.2 of the Partnership Agreement, the Partners agreed that the Partnership’s

Partnership Agreement, which was endorsed in writing.  (SAC ¶23, Exh. 1.)
 
Summary of Demurrer
Defendants demur to Plaintiff’s 4th
and 6th causes of action on the basis that Plaintiff fails to state facts
sufficient to constitute causes of action for conversion and unjust enrichment,
respectively.  (Demurrer, pgs. 4-8.)
 
Legal Standard
“[A] demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of the allegations in a
complaint.” (Lewis v. Safeway, Inc. (2015) 235 Cal.App.4th 385,
388.)  A demurrer can be used only to
challenge defects that appear on the face of the pleading under attack or from
matters outside the pleading that are judicially noticeable.  (See Donabedian v. Mercury Insurance Co. (2004)
116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994 [in ruling on a demurrer, a court may not consider
declarations, matters not subject to judicial notice, or documents not accepted
for the truth of their contents].)  For
purposes of ruling on a demurrer, all facts pleaded in a complaint are assumed
to be true, but the reviewing court does not assume the truth of conclusions of
law.  (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital
District (1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 967.)
 
Failure to State a Cause of
Action
Conversion (4th
COA)
“Conversion is the wrongful
exercise of dominion over the property of another. The elements of a conversion
claim are: (1) the plaintiff’s ownership or right to possession of the
property; (2) the defendant’s conversion by a wrongful act or disposition of
property rights; and (3) damages.”  (Lee v. Hanley (2015) 61 Cal.4th 1225, 1240.)
“It is not necessary that there
be a manual taking of the property; it is only necessary to show an assumption
of control or ownership over the property, or that the alleged converter has
applied the property to his own use.”  (Shopoff &
Cavallo LLP v. Hyon (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 1489, 1507.)
“[C]onversion is a strict
liability tort. It does not require bad faith, knowledge, or even negligence;
it requires only that the defendant have intentionally done the act depriving
the plaintiff of his or her rightful possession.”  (Voris v. Lampert (2019) 7 Cal.5th 1141, 1158.)
“‘Money cannot be the subject of
a cause of action for conversion unless there is a specific, identifiable sum
involved, such as where an agent accepts a sum of money to be paid to another
and fails to make the payment.’ A ‘generalized claim for money [is] not
actionable as conversion.’”  (PCO, Inc. v.
Christensen, Miller, Fink, Jacobs, Glaser, Weil & Shapiro, LLP (2007) 150 Cal.App.4th 384,
395, internal citations omitted.)
Plaintiff alleges on information
and belief that commencing in 2020 and continuing to the present, Defendants
KGR and Kenneth unilaterally, and without Plaintiff’s prior consent or
knowledge, took Plaintiffs 50% interest in the Partnership and have refused to
pay Plaintiff his 50% of the Restaurant’s revenue.  (SAC ¶42.)
Plaintiff alleges on information
and belief that in or around May of 2020 and February of 2021, Defendants KGR and
Kenneth received the sum of $120,000.00 and $166,368.000, respectively, from
the government’s Paycheck Protection Program to assist business owners keep
their workforce employed during the Covid pandemic (collectively, “PPP Funds”).  (SAC ¶43.)
Plaintiff alleges on information
and belief that in or around May of 2020 and May of 2021, Defendants KGR and Kenneth
received the sum of $1,424,527.00 from the Small Business Administration’s
Restaurant Revitalization Fund for emergency assistance (“RRR Funds”).  (SAC ¶44.)
Plaintiff alleges the Restaurant’s
revenue, PPP Funds, and RRR Funds were Partnership assets which Plaintiff had a
50% interest in.  (SAC ¶45.)  Plaintiff alleges that without informing
Plaintiff that they had received the PPP Funds and RRR Funds, along with
revenue for the Restaurant from 2020, Defendants converted said funds for their
own personal use.  (SAC ¶45.)
Plaintiff alleges on information
and belief that Defendants intentionally exercised dominion and control over the
PPP Funds, RRR Funds, and the 50% interest in the Restaurant’s revenue.  (SAC ¶46.) 
Plaintiff alleges that Defendants’ continued control over the PPP Funds,
RRR Funds, and the 50% interest in the Partnership, including the Restaurant’s revenue,
is inconsistent with Plaintiffs rights as a 50% Partner in the Partnership.  (SAC ¶46.)
Plaintiff alleges Defendants’
conversion of the PPP Funds, RRR Funds, and the 50% interest in the
Partnership, including the Restaurant’s revenue, caused damages to Plaintiff in
a sum subject to proof at trial.  (SAC
¶47.)
Plaintiff fails to allege a
cause of action for conversion. Corporation Code §16501 provides, “A partner is
not a coowner of partnership property and has no interest in partnership
property that can be transferred, either voluntarily or involuntarily.”  (Corp. Code §16501; see id. §16101(a)(15) [“‘Property’ means all property,
real, personal, or mixed, tangible or intangible, or any interest therein.”]; see id. §16502 [“The only transferable interest of a
partner in the partnership is the partner’s share of the profits and losses of
the partnership and the partner’s right to receive distributions.”].)  Plaintiff alleges, “[p]ursuant to Section 2.2
of the Partnership Agreement, the Partners agreed that Plaintiff shall have the
right to pay off any remaining balance of the Additional $500,000.00 Capital in
a lump sum at any time. Should Plaintiff elect to pay off any remaining balance
of the Additional $500,000.00 Capital in a lump sum, Plaintiff shall
immediately be entitled to receive its 50% share of profits from the
Partnership.”  (SAC ¶13.)  
Plaintiff does not allege that
he elected to pay off any remaining balance of the Additional $500,000.00
Capital in a lump sum, entitling him to receive its 50% share of profits from
the Partnership.  Further, Plaintiff is
not entitled to the PPP Funds, RRR Funds, and the 50% interest in the
Partnership, including the Restaurant’s revenue because those assets belong to
the Partnership, not Plaintiff. 
Plaintiff’s only transferable interest in the Partnership is his share of
the profits and losses of the Partnership and his right to receive
distributions.  (Corp. Code §16502.)
Accordingly, Defendant’s
demurrer to Plaintiff’s 4th cause of action is sustained with 20 days leave to amend.
 
Unjust Enrichment
(6th COA)
The elements of an unjust
enrichment claim are the “receipt of a benefit and [the] unjust retention of
the benefit at the expense of another.” 
(Peterson v. Cellco
Partnership (2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 1583, 1593, citing Lectrodryer v. SeoulBank (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 723, 726.)
“As a matter of law, an unjust
enrichment claim does not lie where the parties have an enforceable express
contract.”  (Durell v. Sharp Healthcare (2010) 183 Cal.App.4th 1350, 1370;
see also
California Medical Association, Inc. v. Aetna U.S. Healthcare of California,
Inc. (2001) 94
Cal.App.4th 151, 172 [“a quasi-contract action for unjust enrichment does not
lie where, as here, express binding agreements exist and define the parties’
right.”].)
Plaintiff alleges Defendants
were unjustly enriched by their use of monies and assets belonging to the
Partnership including the Real Property and Restaurant to the damage and
detriment to Plaintiff.  (SAC ¶57.)  Plaintiff alleges Defendants have unjustly
retained the benefit of the monies and assets belonging to the Partnership,
including the Real Property and the Restaurant and the 50% interest in the
partnership without providing adequate compensation to Plaintiff.  (SAC ¶58.)
Plaintiff alleges Defendants
have unjustly retained a benefit at the expense of Plaintiff and should be
required to disgorge all amounts by which they have been unjustly enriched.  (SAC ¶59.)
Plaintiff fails to allege a
cause of action for unjust enrichment because Plaintiff has plead the existence
an enforceable agreement between KGR and Plaintiff that covers the subject of
the Real Property and partnership assets. (See Hedging Concepts, Inc. v. First Alliance
Mortgage Co.
(1996) 41 Cal.App.4th 1410, 1420 [“When parties have an actual contract
covering a subject, a court cannot—not even under the guise of equity jurisprudence—substitute
the court’s own concepts of fairness regarding that subject in place of the
parties’ own contract.”].) 
Accordingly, Defendant’s
demurrer to Plaintiff’s 6th cause of action is sustained with 20 days leave to amend.
 
Conclusion
Defendant’s demurrer to
Plaintiff’s SAC is sustained with 20 days leave to amend as to the 4th and 6th causes of action.
Moving Party to give notice.
 
B.   
Motion to Strike
In light of this Court’s ruling
on Defendants’ demurrer, Defendants’ motion to strike is denied as moot.
 
Conclusion
Defendants’ motion to strike
portions of Plaintiff’s SAC is denied as moot.
Moving Party to give notice.
