The judge has reviewed the documents submitted by the plaintiff, Cathay Bank, in support of a default judgment against the defendants, Wholesale Parts Distributor LLC, and Eun Sook Min. The plaintiff is seeking a judgment of $43,894.69, which includes damages, late charges, prejudgment interest, costs, and attorneys' fees. The judge finds sufficient evidence to support the requested award and grants the plaintiff's request in full. However, the judge notes that the plaintiff's JUD-100 and CIV-100 forms contain an error in the amount of attorneys' fees sought, which must be corrected before the court can enter judgment. The application for default judgment is granted, and a judgment of $43,894.69 is entered against the defendants.
