TENTATIVE RULING
 



HUSAM
  ASI,  
  
         vs.
 
HOLLYWOOD
  FOREIGN PRESS ASSOCIATION, et al.


 Case No.: 
  22STCV15728
 
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  December 19, 2024



 
Defendant Hollywood Foreign Press
Association’s motion to compel responses from pro per
Plaintiff Husam Asi to its Request for Production of Documents (Set One) is granted.  Plaintiff is ordered to provide verified
responses pursuant to C.C.P. §2031.210 and to produce the documents,
electronically stored information, and/or other things requested without
objections within 20 days of this ruling.
 
Defendant
Hollywood Foreign Press Association (“HFPA”) (“Defendant”) moves to compel
responses from pro per Plaintiff Husam Asi (“Asi”) (“Plaintiff”) to its Request
for Production (Set One) (“RFP”). 
(Notice MTC, pg. 2; C.C.P. §§2031.010, et seq.)  Further, the HFPA requests an order
compelling Plaintiff to produce all communications he had with third party
David Quinto (“Quinto”) about this case, which Plaintiff is improperly
withholding on the basis that Quinto is an attorney (though not his attorney).  (Notice MTC, pg. 2.)
 
Background
On April
30, 2024, Defendant propounded RFP on Plaintiff.  (Decl. of Ellison ¶2, Exh. 1.)  To date, Plaintiff has not provided written
responses or objections to the Requests; however, he did produce documents on
May 16 and June 15, 2024, together with a spreadsheet titled
“lawyers_email_logs 2022-2024.”  (Decl.
of Ellison ¶3, Exh. 2.)  
Defendant filed the instant motion on September
16, 2024.  Plaintiff filed his opposition
on December 6, 2024.  Defendant filed its
reply on December 12, 2024.
 
Legal
Standard
“The
party claiming the privilege has the burden of establishing the preliminary
facts necessary to support its exercise, i.e., a communication made in the
course of an attorney-client relationship.”  (Costco Wholesale Corp. v. Superior Court
(2009) 219 Cal.4th 725, 733.)  This is
done by providing a privilege log, which contains sufficient information for
judicial evaluation of a claim of privilege.  (Best Products, Inc. v. Superior Court (2004)
119 Cal.App.4th 1181, 1188.)  “Once that
party establishes facts necessary to support a prima facie claim of
privilege, the communication is presumed to have been made in confidence and
the opponent of the claim of privilege has the burden of proof to establish the
communication was not confidential or that the privilege does not for other
reasons apply.”  (Costco Wholesale
Corp., 219 Cal.4th at pg. 733.)
 
Discussion
Having
reviewed Defendant’s motion to compel responses from Plaintiff the Court rules
as follows:  
Defendant’s motion to compel
RFP is granted pursuant to C.C.P. §2031.300. 
Plaintiff is ordered to provide verified responses pursuant to C.C.P.
§2031.210 and to produce the documents, electronically stored information,
and/or other things requested without objections within 20 days of this ruling.
Plaintiff
cannot withhold his communications with Quinto on the grounds of the attorney-client
privilege because Plaintiff concedes that they never had an attorney-client
relationship and Plaintiff never intended to hire Quintos.  (Decl. of Ellison ¶5, Exh. 5; see People
v. Navarro (2006) 138 Cal.App.4th 146, 157 [information obtained by lawyer
in conversation with person who is seeking legal assistance and intends on
hiring the lawyer is
privileged even if actual employment does not result].)  Plaintiff bears the burden of establishing his
privilege claim.  (See Titmas v.
Superior Court (2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 738, 745.)  Plaintiff has not met this burden.  Plaintiff’s communications with Quinto,
reflected on Plaintiff’s privilege log, are not privileged because there
was no attorney-client relationship between Quinto and Plaintiff, and no such
relationship was contemplated. 
Accordingly,
Defendant’s motion to compel responses is granted.
          
Conclusion
Defendant’s
motion to compel further responses from Plaintiff to RFP is granted.  Plaintiff is ordered to provide verified
responses pursuant to C.C.P. §2031.210 and to produce the documents,
electronically stored information, and/or other things requested without
objections within 20 days of this ruling.
