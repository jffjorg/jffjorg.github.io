And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the defendant's motion to compel responses from the plaintiff, Husam Asi, with regards to the defendant's Request for Production of Documents (Set One). The plaintiff, who is representing himself, has failed to provide written responses or objections to the requests, but has produced some documents and a spreadsheet. The court has ordered the plaintiff to provide verified responses and produce the requested documents, electronically stored information, and/or other things without objections within 20 days of the ruling.

The court has also ruled that the plaintiff's communications with David Quinto, a third party, are not privileged because there was no attorney-client relationship between the two parties. The plaintiff had claimed that his communications with Quinto were privileged, but the court has found that the plaintiff did not meet his burden of proving that the communications were confidential or that the privilege applied.

As a result, the court has granted the defendant's motion to compel responses from the plaintiff and ordered the plaintiff to provide the requested information within 20 days.
