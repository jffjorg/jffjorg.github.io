The default judgment application was previously denied because: “(1) a declaration has not been submitted by the client establishing his damages; (2) the attorneys’ fee request does not comply with Local Rules, Rule 3.214; and (3) prejudgment interest at 10% per year was not calculated correctly.”While these issues have seemingly been rectified, the proposed judgment now requests “20,119.96” in “other” damages without any explanation.  The Court will enter judgment in the amount of $27,847.88, which is the amount that has been explained. Plaintiff to give notice.
