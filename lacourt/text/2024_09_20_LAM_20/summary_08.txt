And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on two motions: a motion to seal the plaintiff's identity and a motion for contempt. In the motion to seal, the plaintiff seeks to use a pseudonym due to concerns about physical retaliation. The judge finds that there is an overriding interest in sealing the record due to the sensitive nature of the case, which involves child sexual abuse. The judge also finds that the sealing is narrowly tailored and that there are no less restrictive means to protect the plaintiff. The motion to seal is therefore granted.

In the motion for contempt, the plaintiff seeks an order compelling the defendants to comply with prior court orders. The judge finds that the defendants' actions were improper, but that this is not a matter for which the Court would typically hold a litigant in contempt or award fees. The judge instead orders that the filing be stricken and denies the motion for contempt.
