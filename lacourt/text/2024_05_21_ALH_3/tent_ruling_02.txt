On March 22, 2023,
plaintiffs Gerardo Martinez (“Plaintiff”) and Leila Martinez filed
this action against defendant City of Pasadena (“Defendant”) arising from injuries
 sustained in a fight that occurred at a soccer match. On July 31,
 2023, Defendant served Plaintiff with Form Interrogatories,
Set One. Defendant extended the deadline to respond three times, but Plaintiff
did not serve any responses. On February 28, 2024, Defendant filed this motion
for an order compelling Plaintiff to serve verified responses, without
objections, to Form Interrogatories, Set One. 
Where a party fails to serve timely
responses to discovery requests, the court may make an order compelling
responses. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290.) A party that fails to serve timely
responses waives any objections to the request, including ones based on
privilege or the protection of attorney work product. (Code Civ. Proc., §§
2030.290, subd. (a).) 
Plaintiff
did not oppose this motion and it is undisputed responses were not served. Accordingly,
 Defenant’s Motion is GRANTED and Plaintiff
is ordered to serve verified responses without objections to Form
Interrogatories, Set One, within 20 days of the date of this Order. 
The Code of Civil Procedure provides
that the court shall impose a monetary sanction against the party who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel, unless the party acted with
substantial justification or the sanction would otherwise be unjust. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (c), 2031.300, subd. (c).) 
Defendant’s
request for monetary sanctions is GRANTED and imposed against Plaintiff in the
reduced amount of $ 285 for 1 hour
at defense
counsel’s hourly rate of $225.00 and $60.00
in filing fees, to be paid within 20 days of the date of this Order.
Moving party to give notice.
Dated
this 21st
day of May 2024
