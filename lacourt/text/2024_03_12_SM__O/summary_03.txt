The judge's tentative ruling in the case of Longmire v. Blaske is that the defendant's demurrer to the plaintiff's only cause of action, breach of contract, is sustained with 20 days leave to amend. The plaintiff, Michael Allen Longmire, alleges that the defendant, Brady Blaske, breached a contract by terminating his access to Blaske's Fiji Water account without notice or communication. However, the plaintiff fails to allege any damages resulting from the breach of contract. Additionally, the judge grants the defendant's motion to strike the prayer for punitive damages from the complaint, as punitive damages are not allowed in a breach of contract cause of action under California Civil Code ยง 3294.
