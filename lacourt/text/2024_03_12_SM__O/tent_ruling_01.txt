TENTATIVE
RULING
            Plaintiff Eula Mae Brown’s Motion to Compel Further
Responses to Requests for Production (SET ONE), Nos. 16–17, 22–25 as to
Defendant General Motors, LLC is GRANTED. Defendant is ordered to serve further
responses without objection in ______ days.  Plaintiffs have abided by the
statutory requirements of CCP § 2031.310 with its request for further responses
to RFP. RFPs Nos. 16–17, and 22–25 are reasonably calculated to lead to the
discovery of admissible evidence. 
 
Request
Nos. 16–17, and 22–25—These Requests seek documents regarding cars of the same
year, make and model as Plaintiff Eula May Brown’s (“Brown”) vehicle. They do

seek the following information regarding cars of the same make, model and year
as Brown’s vehicle:

activation of dtc 00299 engine underboost; removal of turbocharger; replacement
of turbocharger; and any other concern identified in the repair history for the
subject 2021 Chevrolet Trailblazer; Vehicle Identification Number
KL79MMS21MB172417.” (Walker Decl., ¶ 17, Ex. 6, p. 3.)

Brown
has the initial burden of demonstrating good cause on a motion to compel
further responses to Requests by making a facts specific showing of relevance. (See
Code Civ. Proc. §2031.310, subd., (b)(1); Kirkland v. Supr. Ct. (2002)
95 Cal.App.4th 92, 98 [“Once good cause was shown, the burden shifted to
Kirkland to justify his objection.”].) It is only after Brown demonstrates good
cause to the satisfaction of the Court that the burden shifts to GM to justify
its objections. This burden is no different in an action under the Song-Beverly
Act, and Brown fails to cite any authority to the contrary. 
 
Brown
makes a convincing case of good cause to compel production of documents
relating to other customer complaints involving vehicles of the same make,
model and year. Such information would be relevant to GM’s knowledge of the
particular defect in Brown’s specific vehicle and its good faith or bad faith
attempts at compliance with the Act. Brown establishes the relevance of these
complaints GM’s alleged willful violation of the Song-Beverly Act. The nature
of other complaints regarding the same vehicle type is also relevant to what
constitutes a “reasonable” number of repair attempts.
 
Brown
therefore makes a fact-specific showing of relevance as to Request Nos. 16–17
and 22–25 and refutes the objection based on undue burden. The burden therefore
shifts to GM to justify its objections. GM fails to satisfy this burden. GM
argues this general information pertaining to vehicles of the same make, model
and year are irrelevant and unduly burdensome, and could include trade secret
information. As discussed above, Plaintiff makes a sufficient showing of
relevance. 
 
GM
fails to demonstrate that production in response to these Requests would be
unduly burdensome. Counsel Kay’s declaration does not set forth specific facts
regarding what production in response to these Requests would entail, or how
production in response to these Requests would be unduly burdensome. (See Kay Decl.,
filed on 2-28-24, ¶ 13 (detailing orders in other cases where court notes the
burden such discovery imposes on the courts). “The objection based upon burden
must be sustained by evidence showing the quantum of work required, while to
support an objection of oppression there must be some showing either of an
intent to create an unreasonable burden or that the ultimate effect of the
burden is incommensurate with the result sought.” (West Pico Furniture Co.
of Los Angeles v. Supr. Ct. (1961) 56 Cal.2d 407, 417 [discussing such
objections asserted to interrogatories].) 
            
            Further, GM fails to demonstrate that production in
response to these Requests would include trade secret information in which the 4-26-23,
or the stipulated 2-8-24, Protective Order would not protect (See 4-26-23
Protective Order; see also Kay Decl., ¶ 10.)
