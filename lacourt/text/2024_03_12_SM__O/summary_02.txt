And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the Motion to Strike filed by the defendants, Kenmore Realty Corp and Farhad Eshaghpour, regarding the punitive damages allegations and prayer for punitive damages made by the plaintiffs, Andrew Myers and David Desmond. The Judge has denied the motion, finding that the plaintiffs have pleaded sufficient factual allegations for a jury to possibly find that the defendants acted with malice towards the plaintiffs.

The Judge notes that punitive damages may be awarded in an action by a residential tenant based on the landlord's interference with peaceful possession, and that the plaintiffs have alleged numerous facts alleging the defendants' interference with their rent-stabilized unit. Specifically, the plaintiffs alleged that their downstairs neighbor began a campaign of harassment and intimidation against them, and that the defendants intentionally chose not to take reasonable measures to prevent this campaign because they wanted to force the plaintiffs to vacate the property.

The Judge finds that these allegations are sufficient for the jury to possibly find that the defendants acted with malice towards the plaintiffs, and therefore denies the defendants' motion to strike the punitive damages allegations and prayer for punitive damages.
