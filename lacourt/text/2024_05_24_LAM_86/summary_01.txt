**Summary of the Tentative Ruling**

The judge's tentative ruling in this case is a summary of the legal issues and the judge's opinions on the case. The case is about a charter school, Global Education Collaborative, which wants to use the facilities of the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) for the 2024-25 school year. The school claims that the district did not accept its facilities request, which was submitted online through the district's portal.

The judge's tentative ruling addresses the following issues:

1. **Preemption**: The judge concludes that the district's requirement for charter schools to submit facilities requests through its online portal is not preempted by state law.
2. **Whether GEA "submitted" a facilities request**: The judge interprets "submit" to mean that the request must be transmitted or conveyed for review, consideration, and decision by the district. The judge finds that GEA did not actually submit its facilities request, as the request remained "in progress" on the district's portal.
3. **Burden of proof**: The judge concludes that petitioner bears the burden of proof in demonstrating that GEA submitted a facilities request that the district was obligated to consider.

The judge's tentative ruling is not a final decision and is subject to change based on further arguments and evidence presented by the parties.
