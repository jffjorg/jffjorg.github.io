[2]           Respondent District never filed an Answer
to the Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate. Accordingly, the facts alleged
are thus deemed admitted. (CCP § 431.20(a); Carlsen v. Koivumaki (2014)
227 Cal.App.4th 879, 898 [“A defendant's failure to answer the complaint has
the same effect as admitting the well-pleaded allegations of the complaint”].)
 


[3]           The District did not use the online portal
to accept Proposition 39 facilities requests for the 2023-24 school year
because the District was addressing systemwide network security issues that had
arisen from an external cyber attack. (Hwang Decl. ¶ 19.) 


[4]           In its November 22, 2023 email, GEA
also sought to initiate the dispute resolution process set forth in its
charter. (Lee Decl. ¶ 13 & Ex. 12 at GEA 197-98.) The District later moved
to dismiss this proceeding on the ground that GEA did not engage in the
mandatory dispute resolution process, or, in the alternative, to compel petitioner
to participate in dispute resolution. On March 13, 2024, the Court denied the
District’s motion. 


[5]           Similarly, in the legal context, Black’s Law Dictionary defines “submit”
as “[t]o end the presentation of further evidence in (a
case) and tender a legal position for decision.” (Black's Law Dict. (11th ed.
2019).)
