[TENTATIVE] RULING ON VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT
  OF MANDATE
 
Dept. 86 (Hon. Curtis A. Kin)
 
 




 


 


 


 



Petitioner
Global Education Collaborative seeks a writ of mandate compelling respondent
Los Angeles Unified School District to accept its facilities request and
prepare a proposal of facilities to be offered to Global Education Academy for
the 2024-25 school year.
 
I.       Factual Background
 
A.          
Charter
Schools Act and Proposition 39
 
In
enacting the Charter Schools Act of 1992 (Ed. Code § 47600, et seq.),[1]
the Legislature intended “to provide opportunities for teachers, parents,
pupils, and community members to establish and maintain schools that operate
independently from the existing school district structure.” (§ 47601.) “Charter
schools are public schools ‘free from most state laws pertaining uniquely to
school districts.’ [Citation.] The freedom granted to charter schools is
intended to promote choice and innovation, and to stimulate ‘competition within
the public school system.’ [Citation.]” (California Charter Schools Assn. v.
Los Angeles Unified School Dist. (2015) 60 Cal.4th 1221, 1228 [“Cal.
Charter Schools Assn.”].) 
 
Prior
to the enactment of Proposition 39 by California voters in 2000, due to limited
public funding to cover the cost of facilities, charter schools could use facilities
which were not currently being used by the districts. (Id. at 1226,
1228.) Proposition 39 amended section 47614 and changed the way charter schools
may obtain access to district facilities. (Id. at 1228.) Section 47614
provides, in relevant part:
 
(a)
The intent of the people in amending Section 47614 is that public school
facilities should be shared fairly among all public school pupils, including
those in charter schools.
 
(b)
Each school district shall make available, to each charter school operating in
the school district, facilities sufficient for the charter school to
accommodate all of the charter school’s in-district students in conditions
reasonably equivalent to those in which the students would be accommodated if
they were attending other public schools of the district. 
 
Charter
schools seeking to use district facilities are required to provide the district
“with a reasonable projection of the charter school’s average daily classroom
attendance by in-district students for the following year” on an annual basis.
(§ 47614(b)(2).) 
 
The
State Board of Education subsequently issued regulations governing the
implementation of section 47614. (5 C.C.R. §§ 11969.1-11969.10.) Under regulation
11969.9(b), “[t]o receive facilities during a particular fiscal year, a charter
school must submit a written facilities request to the school district on or
before November 1 of the preceding fiscal year.” “School districts may require
the charter school to submit its facilities request…on a form available from
the [California Department of Education] and developed in consultation with the
Advisory Commission on Charter Schools (ACCS) or another form specified by the
school district.” (5 C.C.R. § 11969.9(c)(3).) The district then has until
December 1 to object in writing and state the projects it considers reasonable.
(Id. § 11969.9(d).) The charter school then has until January 2 to
respond to the district. (Id. § 11969.9(e).)
 
            As summarized by the California
Supreme Court, the procedure after submission of a facilities request is as follows:
 
By
the following February 1, the school district receiving the request must make a
preliminary space allocation proposal that “[at] a minimum” “shall include (1)
the projections of in-district classroom [average daily attendance] on which
the proposal is based, (2) the specific location or locations of the space, (3)
all conditions pertaining to the space, including a draft of any proposed
agreement pertaining to the charter school's use of the space, and (4) the
projected pro rata share amount and a description of the methodology used to
determine that amount. The district shall also provide the charter school a
list and description of the comparison group schools used in developing its
preliminary proposal, and a description of the differences between the
preliminary proposal and the charter school’s facilities request....” [Citation.]
After the charter school has had an opportunity to respond to the proposal, the
district must make a final space offer to the charter school by April 1, and
the charter school must notify the District whether it accepts the offer within
30 days or by May 1, whichever is later. [Citation.]
 
(Cal.
Charter Schools Assn., 60 Cal.4th at 1231.)
 
B.          
Global
Education Academy
 
Petitioner
Global Education Collaborative operates a charter school known as Global
Education Academy (“GEA”). (Lee Decl. ¶ 1.) GEA has been operating as a charter
school authorized by respondent Los Angeles Unified School District (“District”
or “LAUSD”) since 2007 and serves approximately 350 primarily low-income
students in grades TK through eight within the geographic boundaries of the
District. (Lee Decl. ¶ 2; Pet. ¶ 23.)[2]
The California Department of Education recently designated GEA a “high
performing” school ranking in the top 10% of charter schools statewide and the
top 8% in the District. (Lee Decl. ¶ 2 & Ex. 1 at GEA 1.) 
 
GEA
was originally chartered to instruct students in kindergarten through fifth
grade but was later expanded to include grades six through eight in 2018. (Pet.
¶ 24.) To accommodate the middle school grades, GEA began making use of
Proposition 39 facilities in 2020 and currently uses facility space at the
nearby District-operated high school site, Manual Arts Senior High School. (Lee
Decl. ¶ 5; Pet. ¶ 24.) GEA currently uses seven classrooms, two special
education rooms, and one administrative “office” classroom at the Manual Arts
campus. (Lee Decl. ¶ 5 & Ex. 2 at GEA 57, Ex. 3 at GEA 104.) GEA wishes to continue
using the same classrooms in the 2024-25 school year that it is using in the
2023-24 school year, as was stated in the facilities request at issue in this
case. (Lee Decl. ¶¶ 5, 10 & Ex. 6 at GEA 179.) 
 
C.          
District’s
Online Facilities Request Portal
 
To
standardize and help process annual Proposition 39 facilities requests, the
District developed an online Proposition 39 facilities request portal for charter
schools to submit their Proposition 39 facilities request forms to the
District. (Hwang Decl., ¶ 9.) According to the District, the online portal has
worked for years to successfully receive and process hundreds of Proposition 39
facilities request forms. (Hwang Decl. ¶ 13; Otto Decl. ¶ 31.) Apart from GEA’s
allegations in this lawsuit, LAUSD purportedly has never received any reported
failures, glitches, or related problems with the operation of its online
Proposition 39 facilities request portal. (Hwang Decl. ¶ 13; Otto Decl. ¶ 31.)
 
To
submit a facilities request, users of the portal register themselves to obtain a
login username and password credentials. (Otto Decl. ¶ 5.) After registering
and logging in to the District’s online portal, and up until the submission
deadline, the user will be able to view any “in progress” or “submitted”
Proposition 39 facilities request forms. (Otto Decl. ¶ 6.) A link is also available
to begin a new Proposition 39 facilities request. (Otto Decl. ¶ 6.) When a
charter school commences a new Proposition 39 facilities request process, the
District’s online portal automatically produces a pop-up window detailing
instructions applicable to the submission of a facilities request form. (Otto
Decl. ¶ 7 & Ex. I.)
 
After
acknowledging the instructions, the user is taken to an online form, which
includes several sections requesting information pertaining to a charter
school’s Proposition 39 facilities request. (Otto Decl. ¶¶ 8-9, 13 & Ex.
J.) The form does not need to be completed in a single sitting and information entered
into the online form, as well as any uploaded documents, can be saved by the
user. (Otto Decl. ¶ 10.) This allows the user an opportunity to work on an “in
progress” request, stop, log out, and log back in at a later date and/or time
to continue entering information and/or edit any existing information or
uploaded documents. (Otto Decl. ¶ 10.) The online facilities request form
states: “The District is not responsible for any difficulties charter schools
may have in navigating or submitting the Online Facilities Request Form.” (Otto
Decl. ¶ 13 & Ex. J at LAUSD 13590.)
 
After
a charter school user has finished entering or editing information and
uploading documents to the form, the user must scroll to the bottom of the
online form and check a box affirming that the information added is true and
accurate. (Otto Decl. ¶ 11.) Finally, the charter school user must click the “Submit
Facilities Request Form” button. (Otto Decl. ¶ 12.) A charter school user may
submit a Proposition 39 facilities request form for the following school year
any time on or before November 1 at 11:59:59 p.m. (Otto Decl., ¶ 13.)
 
The
District offers workshops and publishes “how-to” guides on how to navigate the
portal. (Lee Decl. ¶ 9 & Ex. 4 at GEA 162, Ex. 5 at GEA 163-70.) The
District provides emailed instructions explaining how to submit a Proposition
39 facilities request form to charter schools, regular virtual workshops to
walk through the process, and online office hours to answer any questions.
(Hwang Decl., ¶¶ 21, 22, 25; Exs. C, D.) 
 
 
D.          
GEA’s
Experience with Proposition 39 Facilities Requests Prior to Request for 2024-25
School Year
 
Until
the 2024-25 school year, GEA submitted a Proposition 39 facilities request form
through the District’s online portal every year since it first requested
facilities for the 2019-20 school year (except for the 2023-24 school year).[3]
(Hwang Decl., ¶¶ 18-20 & Ex. B.) GEA’s Principal Linda Lee submitted GEA’s
facilities request forms for each of those school years. (Otto Decl. ¶¶ 25-26
& Ex. N.) At her deposition, Lee acknowledged that she did not have difficulty
with any step of the entire facilities request process, nor any problems
submitting requests, in prior years on behalf of GEA. (Yeomans Decl. ¶ 3 & Ex.
P at 19:8-15, 21:20-24:9, 28:17-36:15.) Lee understood that she was required to
click the “Submit” button to transmit GEA’s facilities request form to LAUSD
and have the facilities request processed. (Yeomans Decl. ¶ 3 & Ex. P at 34:12-36:15.)
 
E.          
GEA’s
Facilities Request and District’s Response
 
With
respect to the 2024-25 school year, by November 1, 2023, GEA’s Principal Linda
Lee had input, uploaded, and saved all of GEA’s Proposition 39 information
responses and documentary support into the District’s facilities request
portal. (Lee Decl. ¶ 10.) However, the District maintains it did not receive a
Proposition 39 facilities request form from GEA for the 2024-25 school year by
the November 1, 2023 deadline. (Hwang Decl., ¶ 27; Otto Decl., ¶¶ 23 &
28-32; 5 C.C.R. § 11969.9(b).)
 
Lee
testified during deposition that she remembers clicking the button to submit
her facilities request. (Colomba Supp. Decl. ¶ 6 & Ex. 27 at 8:9-59:22.) Though
Lee thought she had submitted the facilities request, Lee could not confirm
whether the District’s system accepted the request. (Lee Decl. ¶ 11.) Lee alerted
District staff to the issue by email on November 2, 2023 at 7:47 a.m. (Lee
Decl. ¶ 11 & Ex. 10 at GEA 195.) Lee wrote: “I thought I had submitted our
Prop 39 facilities request yesterday, but I don’t think it went through. I
tried to check this morning and it says that I can’t access the
application/website. [¶] This was truly an honest mistake, and one that has
never been made before on our end. All the documents are uploaded and the
application is completed. Is it possible to accept our prop 39 application for
the 2024-25 school year?” (Lee Decl. ¶ 11 & Ex. 10 at GEA 195; see also Hwang
Decl. ¶ 33 & Ex. F [same email].) 
 
Lee
also telephoned the District. (Pawinski Decl. ¶¶ 8, 9.) According to the
District, Lee acknowledged that she did not submit GEA’s facilities request
form for the 2024-25 school year. (Pawinski Decl. ¶¶ 8-10; Exh. G.) Lee
purportedly never claimed to have submitted GEA’s facilities request, or that
there was any issue or glitch with the District’s portal. (Pawinski Decl. ¶ 9.)
Lee also purportedly did not express any confusion about what had happened, although
she was very upset. (Pawinski Decl. ¶ 9.) After Lee’s telephone call, Lee sent an
email identically worded to the email she had sent earlier to additional
District staff at 7:58 a.m. (Lee Decl. ¶ 12 & Ex. 11 at GEA 196.)
 
The
District did not provide the confirmation requested by Lee. (Lee Decl. ¶ 12.)
On November 2, 2023, at 3:48 p.m., the District’s Proposition 39 email address
responded that Lee’s email was received and that the District would review the communication.
(Lee Decl. ¶ 11 & Ex. 10 at GEA 195.) The District did not substantively
respond for several weeks. (Lee Decl. ¶ 13.) Out of an abundance of caution, on
November 22, 2023, GEA sent by email to the District all of the documents and questionnaire
responses comprising its facilities request, as they were uploaded on November
1.[4]
(Lee Decl. ¶¶ 13, 14 & Ex. 12 at GEA 197-98, Ex. 13 at GEA 200.)
 
On
November 30, 2024, the District responded by email, stating:
 
Global
Education Academy (“Charter School”) did not submit a written facilities
request for the 2024-25 school year to the Los Angeles Unified School District
(“District”) on or before November 1, 2023, and therefore, failed to comply
with the requirements of California Code of Regulations, title 5, section
11969.9, subdivisions (b) and (c)(3). As such, Charter School is not entitled
to be allocated and/or provided access to facilities by the District for the
2024-25 school year pursuant to Proposition 39.
 
(Lee
Decl. ¶¶ 15, 16 & Ex. 14 at GEA 201.) The District stated it had no duty
under 5 C.C.R § 11969(d) to respond to GEA’s Proposition 39 request. The
District then asserted a reservation of its rights to evaluate the
reasonability of GEA’s request per section 11969.9(d). Finally, the District
claimed that, even if GEA’s request should later be found valid, the District
would still not allocate any facilities to GEA, because in that case the
District would allocate facilities to accommodate “0.00” daily classroom
attendance. (Lee Decl. ¶ 15 & Ex. 14 at GEA 201.) 


 
F.          
GEA’s
Contentions Regarding Consequences if Facilities Request Not Processed
 
If
GEA cannot continue using the public school facilities it currently occupies, GEA
contends there is a substantial risk it will have to close its sixth through
eighth grade classes. (Lee Decl. ¶¶ 19-20.) GEA has worked with a charter
school property development firm, a real estate broker, and the California
Charter School Association to find other facilities. (Lee Decl. ¶ 20.) Despite
these efforts, GEA has been unable to find any suitable replacement school
site. (Lee Decl., ¶ 20; Pet. ¶ 42.) As a result, GEA contends it likely will
have to close its sixth through eighth grade classes, terminate over 20
employees, and disenroll 150 middle school students. (Lee Decl. ¶¶ 19-20.)
 
II.      Procedural
History
 
            On January 16, 2014, petitioner
filed a Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate. No answer has been filed.  On April 2, 2024, petitioner filed an opening
brief. On April 23, 2024, respondent filed an opposition. On May 7, 2024,
petitioner filed a reply. 
 
The
Court has received a lodged hard copy of a joint appendix containing exhibits
attached to declarations filed in support of the opening brief, opposition, and
reply. The Court has also received a USB drive containing the exhibits cited in
support of the papers. 
 
III.     Standard of Review
 
 CCP § 1085(a) provides: “A writ of mandate may
be issued by any court to any inferior tribunal, corporation, board, or person,
to compel the performance of an act which the law specially enjoins, as a duty
resulting from an office, trust, or station, or to compel the admission of a
party to the use and enjoyment of a right or office to which the party is
entitled, and from which the party is unlawfully precluded by that inferior
tribunal, corporation, board, or person.”
 
“There
are two essential requirements to the issuance of a traditional writ of
mandate: (1) a clear, present and usually ministerial duty on the part of the
respondent, and (2) a clear, present and beneficial right on the part of the
petitioner to the performance of that duty.” (California Assn. for Health
Services at Home v. State Dept. of Health Services (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th
696, 704.) “An action in ordinary mandamus is proper where…the claim is that an
agency has failed to act as required by law.” (Id. at 705.)
 
“When
a party seeks review of an administrative decision pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 1085, judicial review is limited to examining the agency proceedings to
ascertain whether the agency’s action has been arbitrary, capricious or lacking
entirely in evidentiary support, or whether the agency failed to follow the
proper procedure and give notices required by law. And, where the case involves
the interpretation of a statute or ordinance, our review of the trial court’s
decision is de novo.” (Ideal Boat & Camper Storage v. County of Alameda
(2012) 208 Cal.App.4th 301, 311, citing Pomona Police Officers’ Assn. v.
City of Pomona (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 578, 584.) In independently reviewing
legal questions, “[a]n administrative agency’s interpretation does not bind
judicial review but it is entitled to consideration and respect.” (Housing
Partners I, Inc. v. Duncan (2012) 206 Cal.App.4th 1335, 1343.) 
 
An
agency is presumed to have regularly performed its official duties. (Evid. Code
§ 664.) In a CCP § 1085 writ petition, the petitioner generally bears the
burden of proof. (California Correctional Peace Officers Assn. v. State
Personnel Bd. (1995) 10 Cal.4th 1133, 1154.)         
 
IV.     Analysis
 
A.          
Evidentiary
Matters
 
Respondent
District’s evidentiary objections are OVERRULED. 
 
Respondent
District’s request to take judicial notice of the California State Board of
Education’s Final Statement of Reasons with respect to Proposition 39
regulations is GRANTED. (Evid. Code § 452(c); Ochoa v. Anaheim City School
Dist. (2017) 11 Cal.App.5th 209, 221 [taking judicial notice of State Board
of Education’s agenda, minutes, and “Final Statement of Reasons” for adoption
of regulations].) 
 
B.          
Whether District’s Portal is Preempted by State Law
 
Petitioner argues that the District’s requirement
that charter schools submit facilities requests through an online submission
portal is preempted by the regulations promulgated by the State Board of
Education to implement Proposition 39. Petitioner contends that the state regulations
did not impose any single method by which charter schools must submit their
facilities requests. The Court disagrees.
 
“‘Under
article XI, section 7 of the California Constitution, ‘[a] county or city may
make and enforce within its limits all local, police, sanitary, and other
ordinances and regulations not in conflict with general laws.’ If otherwise
valid local legislation conflicts with state law, it is preempted by such law
and is void. A conflict exists if the local legislation duplicates,
contradicts, or enters an area fully occupied by general law, either expressly
or by legislative implication. Local legislation is ‘duplicative’ of general
law when it is coextensive therewith. Similarly, local legislation is ‘contradictory’
to general law when it is inimical thereto. Finally, local legislation enters
an area that is ‘fully occupied’ by general law when the Legislature has
expressly manifested its intent to ‘fully occupy’ the area, or when it has
impliedly done so in light of one of the following indicia of intent:’….” (San
Diego Gas & Electric Co. v. City of Carlsbad (1998) 64 Cal.App.4th 785,
792-793, quoting Sherwin–Williams Co. v. City of Los Angeles (1993) 4
Cal.4th 893, 897–98.)
 
With
respect to education, the Legislature is charged with determining and forming
policy and fixing a primary standard. (Wilson v. State Bd. of Educ.
(1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 1125, 1146.) Afterward, the Legislature may “confer upon
executive or administrative officers the ‘power to fill up the details’ by
prescribing administrative rules and regulations to promote the purposes of the
legislation and to carry it into effect.” (Ibid., quoting State Bd.
of Education v. Honig (1993) 13 Cal.App.4th 720, 750 [Honig].) “In
the educational setting, legislatures rarely control public school operations
directly, but delegate authority which permits state, regional, and local
education agencies to establish school policies and practices.” (Honig, 13
Cal.App.4th at 750.) 
 
Petitioner
is correct that section 47614 sets forth a policy that school districts share
their facilities with charter schools “in conditions reasonably equivalent to
those in which the students would be accommodated if they were attending other
public schools of the district.” (§ 47614(b); see Reply at 10:23-27.)
Section 47614 states explicitly that “[t]he school district shall make
reasonable efforts to provide the charter school with facilities near to where
the charter school wishes to locate, and shall not move the charter school unnecessarily.”
(§ 47614(b).)
 
But,
having determined and formed its policy regarding charter schools and fixed a
primary standard, the Legislature permissibly delegated the establishment of
policies and practices regarding the review of facilities requests under
Proposition 39 down to the District. The Legislature delegated the task of defining the
procedures and establishing the timelines for the request of facilities to the State
Board of Education. (§ 47614(b)(6).) In turn, the State Board of Education
expressly allowed school districts to mandate forms by which charter schools
are to submit their facilities requests. Regulation 11969.9 states: “School
districts may require the charter school to submit its facilities request
containing the information specified in paragraphs (1) and (2) on a form
available from the [California
Department of Education] and developed in consultation with the Advisory
Commission on Charter Schools (ACCS) or another form specified by the school
district.” (5 C.C.R. § 11969.9(c)(3), emphasis added; see also § 35160.1(a), (c) [school
districts “should have the flexibility to create their own unique solutions,”
as they “have diverse needs unique to their individual communities and
programs”].)   
 
The
District’s requirement for charter schools to submit their facilities requests
through the District’s portal neither duplicates nor contradicts Proposition 39
regulations. Nor has the Legislature expressed any intent to fully “occupy the
area” of submission of facilities requests. The Court thus concludes that the
District’s use of a submission portal is not preempted by state law. 


 
C.          
Whether GEA “Submitted” a Facilities Request
 
As stated above, the Legislature charged the State
Board of Education with establishing the timelines for Proposition 39
facilities requests. Regulation 11969.9(b) states: “To receive facilities
during a particular fiscal year, a charter school must submit a written
facilities request to the school district on or before November 1 of the
preceding fiscal year.” (5 C.C.R. § 11969.9(b).) 
 
Lee avers that, on November 1, 2023, she finalized,
entered, and uploaded GEA’s facility request to the online portal. (Lee Decl. ¶
10.) Lee further avers that she thought she had submitted the request on
November 1, 2023. (Lee Decl. ¶ 11.) 
 
Petitioner contends that merely uploading the
facilities request on November 1 should be deemed the same as actually
submitting such request. (Reply at 2:18-19.) The Court disagrees. Regulation
11969.9(b) does not define “submit.” (See 5 C.C.R. § 11969.2 [definitions
governing charter school facilities do not include “submit”].) The Court
therefore looks to dictionary definitions for the usual and ordinary meaning of
“submit.” (People v. Killian (2024) 100 Cal.App.5th 191, 212.)
 
Merriam-Webster defines “submit” to mean “to
present or propose to another for review, consideration, or decision.”[5]
(See Merriam-Webster, definition of “submit,” located at https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/submit.) As
section 47614(b)(6) requires the adoption of regulations governing the
procedures and timelines for the “request” of facilities, it makes sense that
submitting a facilities request must be a method by which the charter school transmits
or conveys its request for the District’s actual review, consideration, and
decision. (See 5 C.C.R. § 11969.9(d) [“The school district shall
review the charter school's projections of in-district and total ADA and
in-district and total classroom ADA and, on or before December 1, express any
objections in writing and state the projections the district considers
reasonable”].) 
 
            This
interpretation of “submit” is consistent with the instructions provided by the
District. The “Submission Instructions” for the online facilities request form
instructs the charter school user to complete each section and attach all
required and supporting documents. (Otto Decl. ¶¶ 7, 13 & Exs. I at LAUSD
13589, J at LAUSD 13590.) The user must then check a box affirming that the
information provided by the charter school is true and accurate. (Otto Decl. ¶
13 & Ex. J at LAUSD 13597.) The user must then click the “Submit Online Facilities
Request Form” button. (Otto Decl. ¶¶ 7, 12, 13 & Exs. I at LAUSD 13589, J
at LAUSD 13590.) Otherwise, the request remains “in progress.” (Otto Decl. ¶
14.) A request that is still “in progress” because it has not been submitted is
not distributed to the District’s Charter Schools Division. (Otto Decl. ¶ 14.) 
 
            The
District’s records reflect that GEA initiated a facilities request form on
October 9, 2023 for the 2024-25 school year but that the request remained “in
progress.” (Otto Decl. ¶ 27 & Ex. B at LAUSD 152.) This is in contrast to
GEA’s requests in 2018 through 2022—corresponding to the 2019-20, 2020-21,
2021-22, 2022-23, and 2023-24 school years—which the District reflects as
having actually been “submitted.” (Ibid.) It therefore appears that GEA did
not, in fact, submit a facilities request form for the 2024-25 school year.
 
            Further,
it was no surprise to Lee that she needed to take action to actually submit the
application. When Lee was asked during her deposition whether she understood
that by not clicking the “Submit Online Facilities Request Form” button the
District would not process the facilities request, Lee said, “Yes.” (Yeomans Decl. ¶ 3 & Ex. P at
34:4-36:15.) Prior to Lee’s attempt to request facilities for the 2024-25
school year, Lee used the online portal to submit facilities requests on
October 23, 2018; November 1, 2019; October 31, 2020; and November 1, 2021. (Hwang
Decl. ¶¶ 18, 20; Otto Decl. ¶¶ 26, 27 & Ex. B at LAUSD 152.) Lee had no difficulties
submitting facilities requests during those years. (Yeomans Decl. ¶ 3 & Ex.
P at 19:8-15, 21:20-24:9, 28:17-36:15.)
 
            In
the reply, petitioner refers to a facilities request form completed by GEA for
the 2024-25 school year, which the District provided in discovery. (Colomba
Supp. Decl. ¶ 5 & Ex. 23 at GEA 277-85.)  Even if it is true the District had possession
of GEA’s facilities request, the District’s records reflect that any such
request was never submitted by GEA for the District’s consideration. Indeed, when a request form is submitted
through the District’s portal, an automated email confirming the date and
time of submission is immediately generated and sent to the charter school
user. (Otto Decl. ¶ 19 & Ex. M at LAUSD 13626.) Petitioner has not referred
the Court to any confirming email evidencing GEA’s timely submission of a
facilities request. 
 
Petitioner also posits that, if the portal did not
register GEA’s facilities request as having been submitted, there must then be
a “substantial likelihood” that the portal malfunctioned, as opposed to user
error in the submission process. (Reply at 5:14-25.) This is pure speculation.  The only asserted basis for this supposition
is the fact that the portal was inoperative for requests for the 2023-24 school
year. (Hwang Decl. ¶ 19.) However, the systemwide network security issues that caused
the District to accept requests by email for that school year does not indicate
(let alone establish a “substantial likelihood”) that there was technical
problem for the 2024-25 school year. In the absence of any other evidence of
malfunction, petitioner argues that the District “has [no]t done much at all to
conclusively rule out the possibility of a system malfunction….” (Reply at
5:19-21.) But petitioner bears the burden of proof in demonstrating that GEA
submitted a facilities request that the District was obligated to consider. (California Correctional
Peace Officers Assn., 10 Cal.4th at 1154.) Petitioner has not satisfied
that burden. Instead, the Court is left with the District’s uncontradicted averment
that the portal has worked for years without failures or glitches and that it
was not notified of any technical issues, glitches, shut-downs, or other errors
associated with the District’s portal in November 2023, when Lee attempted to
submit the facilities request. (Otto Decl. ¶¶ 21, 30, 31.) The Court has
no basis to doubt these averments.

 
            Finally,
petitioner argues that, even if the GEA facilities request was not actually
submitted, it has substantially complied with the legal requirements of
Proposition 39. “Substantial compliance…means actual compliance in respect to
the substance essential to every reasonable objective of the statute.” (Stasher
v. Harger-Haldeman (1962) 58 Cal.2d 23, 29.) “When there is such actual
compliance as to all matters of substance then mere technical imperfections of
form or variations in mode of expression…or such minima as obvious
typographical errors, should not be given the stature of noncompliance….” (Stasher
v. Harger-Haldeman (1962) 58 Cal.2d 23, 29, superseded by statute on other
grounds.) This is not a case where the doctrine of substantial compliance is
applicable. GEA’s failure to submit the facilities request is far from an
imperfection of form, variation in expression, or typographical error. Rather,
like preparing an application but failing to deposit the application in the
mailbox to be delivered to the reviewing entity, GEA failed to submit the
request to the District. GEA simply failed to trigger any duty by the District
to consider its request.
 
In sum, the State Board of Education allowed the
District to specify the form under which facilities requests are to be
submitted. (5 C.C.R. § 11969.9(c)(3).) The District required requests to be
submitted, not just uploaded, through its online portal. (Hwang Decl. ¶ 9; Otto
Decl. ¶¶ 12, 14.) The Proposition 39 regulations impose a mandatory submission
date of November 1, to which the District must timely object or else it waives
the ability to challenge the charter school’s projections of daily classroom
attendance. (5 C.C.R. § 11969.9(b).) The regulatory timeframe for the review
and response to facilities requests “is a compromise that balances the time
needed for charter schools to determine and provide accurate projections of
average daily attendance (ADA), with the time needed for districts to evaluate
those projections (and other aspects of charter schools’ facilities requests)
and prepare their preliminary proposals and final offers.” (Yeomans Decl. ¶ 4
& Ex. Q at 25.) Given the serious consequence to the District of not timely
objecting to a timely submitted facilities requests, GEA cannot rely on the
mere uploading of its request to assert that it substantially complied with
Proposition 39. GEA must submit the request in the manner required by the
District to trigger its review. GEA fails to demonstrate the timely submission
of its request for the 2024-25 school year.
 
The Court is mindful of the possible severe
consequences of this ruling, including the effect it may have on students
currently enrolled at GEA, their parents, and the teachers employed by GEA. Notwithstanding
the potentially harsh result here, the District was entitled to set forth the
procedure GEA was required to follow to request to use District facilities. Petitioner
having failed to show that GEA complied with that procedure and thereby created
a mandatory duty for the District to process its facilities request, the Court
finds that petitioner is not entitled to traditional mandamus relief. 
 
D.          
Evidentiary Sanctions
 
Petitioner requests that evidence sanctions be
imposed for the purported failure to respond to its discovery requests before
the due date of its opening brief. (Opening Br. at 14:19-20.) Petitioner does
not specify the nature of the proposed evidence sanction, such as what evidence
the District would be barred from presenting. (See CCP § 2023.030(c).)
In any event, petitioner does not demonstrate the existence of any court order
compelling discovery, the violation of which is necessary before the Court may
impose evidentiary sanctions. (See CCP § 2030.300(e), 2031.310(i); see
Colomba Decl. ¶ 4 & Ex. 20 [requests for production and form
interrogatories].) While the parties contemplated limited discovery during the
trial setting conference (see Colomba Decl. ¶ 2 & Ex. 19 at GEA
242-43), the Court never ordered discovery to be provided by a particular date.
(3/12/24 Minute Order.) The District provided discovery responses 30 days after
service, as contemplated by the discovery statutes. (Colomba Decl. ¶ 4
[discovery propounded on 3/15/24]; Colomba Supp. Decl. ¶ 3 & Ex. 22 [discovery
responses provided on 4/15/24]; CCP §§ 2030.260(a), 2031.260(a), 2033.250(a)
[responses due 30 days after service].) 
 
Further, even if the Court were to possess authority
to impose an evidentiary sanction, the Court would decline to do so under the
circumstances. It appears that petitioner obtained discovery responses in time
to incorporate them into the reply. (See Colomba Supp. Decl. ¶¶ 3, 5
& Ex. 22-26.) Petitioner does not demonstrate any prejudice resulting from not
having had the responses in time to file the opening brief. 
 
For the foregoing reasons, the Court declines to
impose evidentiary sanctions. 
 
III.     Conclusion
            
The petition is DENIED. Pursuant to Local Rule
3.231(n), respondent Los Angeles Unified School District shall prepare, serve,
and ultimately file a proposed judgment.
