And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Hyundai Motor America's motion to compel arbitration of plaintiff Donald Rayo's lemon law claims. The court finds that the arbitration provision in the Bluelink Agreement applies to the present action and that the provision is valid and enforceable. The court also finds that the provision is not unconscionable, despite Rayo's arguments that it deprives him of his right to a jury trial and limits his ability to conduct discovery. The court notes that the arbitration provision is meant to be streamlined and that parties are entitled to discovery sufficient to adequately arbitrate their statutory claims. The matter is stayed pending completion of binding arbitration.
