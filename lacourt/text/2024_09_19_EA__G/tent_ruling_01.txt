Plaintiffs M Capital
Global California and Sokly Chen’s Demurrer to Cross-Complaint and Plaintiff M Capital Global California’s
Motion to Strike Cross-Complaint are CONTINUED to a
date to be determined at the hearing in Department G (Pomona).

regarding the Demurrer and Motion to Strike and to file a supplemental

BACKGROUND
This
is an action for breach of contract and fraud. In August 2021, Plaintiff Sokly
Chen, a member of Plaintiff M Capital Global California (M Capital), met with
Defendant Yanlin Li who invited Chen to invest in Li’s vehicle dealership
business by purchasing a fifty percent ownership interest in Fiorano Motorsport
LLC (Fiorano Motorsport) for $1,000,000. On September 22, 2021, Li prepared an
operating agreement that established Li and M Capital’s membership in Fiorano
Motorsport. That same month, M Capital provided an additional $1,500,000 at
Li’s request so Fiorano Motorsport could allegedly open a dealership. In total,
M Capital invested a total of $6,683,000 in Fiorano Motorsport. However, M
Capital and Chen allege Li subsequently embezzled most of these funds through
personal use or transferring the funds to other entities.
In
February 2022, Fiorano Motorsport’s account had been drained of funds as Li had
been allegedly transferring the money to Li’s personal accounts and pocketing
revenue from purchases. When Li requested a $2,350,000 investment from M
Capital to cover expenses, M Capital questioned why the sale revenue was
insufficient. In response, Li claimed there was insufficient revenue and that
Li had used personal money to purchase vehicles. Li then claimed the $2,350,000
was debt owed by M Capital and began attempting to collect this debt by
allegedly threatening M Capital employees, attempting to break into M Capital’s
office, falsely reporting Chen to law enforcement for vehicle theft, and
stalking Chen.
On
May 10, 2022, M Capital filed a complaint against Li, Fiorano Motorsport,
Bianco Corsa Motorsport, and Does 1-50, alleging the following causes of
action: (1) fraud, (2) breach of fiduciary duty, (3) breach of oral contract,
(4) common counts, (5) conversion, and (6) accounting.
On
September 12, 2022, M Capital and Chen filed a First Amended Complaint (FAC)
against Li, Fiorano Motorsport, Bianco Corsa Motorsport (Bianco Corsa), and
Yokohama Imports USA, LLC (Yokohama, collectively Defendants) as well as Does
1-50, alleging the following causes of action: (1) fraud, (2) breach of
fiduciary duty, (3) breach of contract, (4) breach of quasi contract, (5)
involuntary dissolution under Corporations Code section 17707.03, (6) common
counts, (7) conversion, (8) accounting, (9) offer and sale of unqualified,
non-exempt securities in violation of Corporations Code section 25110, (10)
misrepresentation and/ or omissions of material facts in violation of
Corporations Code section 25401, (11) unlawful sale of securities under the
Securities Act of 1933, section 5, (12) unlawful fraudulent scheme under the
Securities Act of 1933, section 17, (13) unlawful business practices under
Business & Professions Code section 17200, and (14) intentional infliction
of emotional distress. On April 11, 2023, the court sustained Defendants’
demurrer to the FAC in part and overruled it in part.
On
May 11, 2023, M Capital and Chen filed a Second Amended Complaint (SAC) against
the same Defendants alleging the following causes of action: (1) fraudulent
inducement, (2) fraud, (3) breach of fiduciary duty, (4) breach of contract,
(5) breach of quasi contract, (6) involuntary dissolution pursuant to
Corporations Code section 17707.03, (7) common counts, (8) conversion, (9)
accounting, (10) sale of securities by unlicensed broker-dealer in violation of
Corporations Code section 25501.5 et seq., (11) offer and sale of unqualified,
non-exempt securities in violation of Corporations Code sections 25503, 25504,
25504.1, and 25110 et seq., (12) offer misrepresentations and/or omissions of
material facts in violation of Corporations Code sections 25401, 25403, and
25404 et seq., (13) unlawful sale of securities pursuant to Securities Act,
section five, (14) unlawful fraudulent scheme pursuant to the Securities Act,
section 17, (15) unlawful business practices pursuant to Business and
Professions Code section 17200, and (16) intentional infliction of emotional
distress (IIED). On October 18, 2023, the court sustained Defendants’ demurrer
to the SAC in part and overruled it in part.
On
November 6, 2023, M Capital and Chen filed a Third Amended Complaint (TAC)
against the same defendants alleging the same causes of action.¿On February 5,
2024, the court overruled Defendants’ demurrer to the TAC.
On
February 21, 2024, Defendants filed a cross-complaint against Chen, M Capital,
and Roes 1-100, alleging the following causes of action: (1) breach of
contract, (2) breach of contract, (3) breach of fiduciary duty, (4) fraud and
deceit, (5) fraudulent inducement, (6) conversion, (7) unjust enrichment, (8)
theft, (9) constructive trust, (10) declaratory relief, (11) injunctive relief,
(12) intentional interference with prospective economic relations, (13)
negligent interference with prospective economic relations, (14) intentional
infliction of emotional distress (IIED), and (15) negligent infliction of
emotional distress (NIED).
On
April 23, 2024, M Capital and Chen filed the present demurrer and motion to
strike. On July 25, 2024, the court continued the hearing on demurrer and motion
to strike in order for parties to meet and confer. On August 27, 2024, the
court again continued the hearing on the demurrer and motion to strike after M
Capital and Chen’s counsel failed to timely file a supplemental declaration
describing meet and confer attempts. On August 28, 2024, M Capital and Chen’s
counsel filed a supplemental declaration that stated parties met and conferred
on July 30, 2024. (Ma Suppl. Decl., ¶ 4.)
A hearing
on the present demurrer and motion to strike is set for September 19, 2024,
along with a case management conference/status conference re: ADR.
ANALYSIS
Chen
and M Capital demur to Defendants’ entire Cross-Complaint. For the following reasons,
the court finds parties did not adequately meet and confer for a second time.
Legal
Standard
Pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41, subdivision (a), prior to filing a
demurrer, “the demurring party shall meet and confer in person or by
telephone, or by video conference with the party who filed the pleading that is
subject to demurrer for the purpose of determining whether an agreement can be
reached that would resolve the objections to be raised in the demurrer.”
This section further provides that “the demurring party shall identify all of
the specific causes of action that it believes are subject to demurrer and
identify with legal support the basis of the deficiencies.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
430.41, subd. (a)(1).)
While
Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41, subdivision (a)(4) makes clear failing
to meet and confer is not grounds to overrule a demurrer, courts “are not
required to ignore defects in the meet and confer process” and if the court
determines “no meet and confer has taken place, or concludes further
conferences between counsel would likely be productive, it retains discretion
to order counsel to meaningfully discuss the pleadings with an eye toward
reducing the number of issues or eliminating the need for a demurrer, and to
continue the hearing date to facilitate that effort.” (Dumas v. Los Angeles
County Bd. of Supervisors (2020) 45 Cal.App.5th 348, 355 & fn. 3.)
Meet and Confer Defects
The
court notes that despite being given two additional opportunities to comply
with the Code of Civil Procedure’s meet and confer requirements, M Capital and
Chen’s counsel continues to fail to do so. Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 430.41, subdivision (a)(3)(A), the demurring party must file a
declaration stating “[t]he means by which the demurring party met and conferred
with the party who filed the pleading subject to demurrer, and that the parties
did not reach an agreement resolving the objections raised in the demurrer.”
Here,
while counsel spent multiple paragraphs describing counsel’s conversation in detail, counsel did not provide a single statement describing how
this conversation took place, including whether it was by telephone, videoconference,
or in-person. (Ma Suppl. Decl., paragraph 4.)
Accordingly, the court finds a continuance of the
hearing on Chen and M Capital’s demurrer and motion to strike is appropriate so
that the parties may meet and confer pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 430.41 and provide the court with a declaration that
specifies whether the meet and confer occurred by telephone, videoconference,
or in-person.
CONCLUSION
Plaintiffs M Capital Global
California and Sokly Chen’s Demurrer to Cross-Complaint and Plaintiff M
Capital Global California’s Motion to Strike Cross-Complaint are CONTINUED to a date to be determined at the hearing in
Department G (Pomona).
Cross-Defendants’
counsel is ordered to meet and confer with Cross-Complainants’ counsel
regarding the Demurrer and Motion to Strike and to file a supplemental
declaration describing such meet and confer efforts at least nine (9) court
days before the next scheduled hearing.
