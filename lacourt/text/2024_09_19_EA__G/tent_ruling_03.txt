TENTATIVE
RULING
 
Defendant Garfield Beach CVS, LLC’s Motion
to Strike the Improper Breach of Warranty Claims from Plaintiff’s Complaint is DENIED.
 
BACKGROUND

This is a premises liability action. In June
2022, Plaintiff Elizabeth Tamayo visited a CVS in San Dimas on premises owned
or controlled by Defendants Garfield Beach CVS, LLC (Garfield Beach CVS), D.H.
Pace Company, Inc. (D.H. Pace), and Dorothy Yey, trustee of the 1996 Dorothy
Yey Louie Family Trust Agreement Dated March 26, 1996 (Yey Louie Trust). As
Tamayo entered the store, Tamayo alleges the automatic doors closed on Tamayo
and caused severe injury and pain.
 
On May 21, 2024, Tamayo filed a complaint
against Garfield Beach CVS, D.H. Pace, Yey, and Does 1-50, alleging the
following causes of action: (1) general negligence, (2) premises liability, and
(3) products liability.
 
On August 13, 2024, Garfield Beach CVS filed
the present motion. Prior to filing on August 12, 2024, Garfield Beach CVS’s
counsel attempted to meet and confer telephonically with Tamayo’s counsel.
(Sowatsky Decl., ¶ 10.)
 
A hearing on the present motion to strike is
set for September 19, 2024, along with a case management conference on October
14, 2024.
 
ANALYSIS

Garfield Beach CVS moves to strike
allegations that Garfield Beach CVS breached implied and express warranties from
Tamayo’s third cause of action for products liability. But these allegations do
not reference Garfield Beach CVS and instead are alleged against Does 1-50. (Complaint,
e.p. 8, ¶ L-6.) Because these allegations are not made against Garfield Beach
CVS, the court finds Garfield Beach CVS lacks standing to bring the present
motion.
 
Accordingly, the court DENIES Garfield Beach CVS’s motion.
 
CONCLUSION

Based on the
foregoing, Garfield
Beach CVS’s motion to strike is DENIED.
