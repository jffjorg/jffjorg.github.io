Case Name: AMERICAN EXPRESS NATIONAL BANK v.
VERJINE YESAIAN
 
TENTATIVE RULING ON
MOTION TO 
Moving Party: Defendant, Verjine Yesaian 
Responding Party: No
Opposition by Plaintiff
Proof of Service
Timely Filed (CRC Rule 3.1300): Ok
16/21 Court Days Lapsed (CCP § 1005(b)): Ok

Proper Address: Uncertain – Defendant allegedly served this motion via U.S.
Mail. There are some discrepancies between the address that Defendant wrote
down on the proof of service for Plaintiff’s counsel, and the address that the
Court has on file on eCourt for Plaintiff’s counsel.
For example,
Defendant’s proof of service indicates that Plaintiff’s counsel was served by
U.S. Mail at 250 N Sunny Slope Rd 300, Brookfield WI 53005-4809.
However, on eCourt,
Plaintiff’s counsel’s address is listed as 250 N Sunnyslope Road, Suite 300,
Brookefield, Wisconsin, 53005.
As can be seen, Defendant’s
proof of service left out the first “e” in Brookefield according to eCourt.
Further, Defendant’s proof of service separated Sunnyslope into two words as
opposed to being one word as listed on eCourt.
TENTATIVE
RULING
It is unclear if Defendant is aware of what is
being heard on 7/19/2024. 
The motion to quash
service of summons being heard on 7/19/2024 pertains to the motion ending with
Res ID 4249. This motion was filed on 5/17/2024. It was initially scheduled to
be heard on 6/21/2024, but the Court reset the hearing for 7/5/2024. On
6/25/2024, the Court rescheduled the hearing set for 7/5/2024 to 7/19/2024. 
Defendant’s motion to
quash (Res ID 4249) does not explicitly state which proof of service Defendant
seeks to quash, but presumably it is the proof of service filed on eCourt on
5/1/2024.
The Court presumes
that the motion to quash (Res ID 4249) seeks to quash the proof of service
filed on eCourt on 5/1/2024 because the only other proof of service filed on
eCourt was filed on 7/9/2024. Since this motion (Res ID 4249) was filed on
5/17/2024, and the proof of service filed on 7/9/2024 has an alleged service
date of 7/5/2024, it seems like it wouldn’t make sense to be able to direct a
motion filed on 5/17/2024 at a proof of service that wasn’t served until
7/5/2024 and filed until 7/9/2024.
Defendant is likely
unaware of what is being heard on 7/19/2024 because the motion to quash (Res ID
1837) that was filed on 7/12/2024 indicates that “Hearing was not held for the
First Quash.” However, this is not true, the hearing for the first motion to
quash is scheduled for 7-19-2024 as indicated by the Notices Re: Continuance of
Hearing and Order filed on 6/10/2024 and 6/25/2024.
Therefore, to the
extent that Defendant is under the assumption that the motion to quash (Res ID)
1837) that was filed on 7/12/2024 is on calendar for 7-19-2024, Defendant is
mistaken. The motion to quash (Res ID 1837) is on calendar for 8/9/2024. 
The Court will hear
argument on whether the motion to quash (Res ID 4249) on calendar for 7-19-2024
should be denied as moot in light of the filing of the motion to quash (Res ID
1837) on calendar for 8-9-2024. 
The Court notes that to
the extent that it is hearing the motion to quash (Res ID 4249), the motion is
borderline indecipherable.
Defendant’s motion
stated:
COMES NOW
Verjine Yesaian, Defendant in the above-styled and numbered cause, and moves
the Court for an order quashing the process served in this action on Defendant
and vacating the return of service on the grounds that the process was not (e.g.,
issued or served) according to California code of Civil Procedure according
to the provisions of CCP 416.90- summons check box unclear if 416.90 or other.
This Motion is made and based on the declaration of Verjine Yesaian, and the
alleged proof of service.
(Mot. p. 1.)
“A party filing a motion, except for a motion listed in rule 3.1114,
must serve and file a supporting memorandum. The court may construe the absence
of a memorandum as an admission that the motion or special demurrer is not
meritorious and cause for its denial and, in the case of a demurrer, as a
waiver of all grounds not supported.” (CRC, Rule 3.1113(a).)
Further, under CRC 3.1114(a):
Civil
motions, applications, and petitions filed on Judicial Council forms that do
not require a memorandum include the following:
(1)
 Application for appointment of guardian ad litem in a civil case;
(2)
 Application for an order extending time to serve pleading;
(3)
 Motion to be relieved as counsel;
(4)
 Motion filed in small claims case;
(5)
 Petition for change of name or gender;
(6)
 Petition for declaration of emancipation of minor;
(7)
 Petition for injunction prohibiting harassment;
(8)
 Petition for protective order to prevent elder or dependent adult abuse;
(9)
 Petition for order to prevent postsecondary school violence;
(10)
 Petition of employer for injunction prohibiting workplace violence;
(11)
 Petition for order prohibiting abuse (transitional housing);
(12)
 Petition to approve compromise of claim of a minor or a person with a
disability; and
(13)
 Petition for withdrawal of funds from blocked account.
(CRC, rule 3.1114(a).)
Here, Defendant did not file and serve a supporting memorandum, and
Defendant’s motion was not exempt under 3.1114(a).
“The memorandum must contain a statement of facts, a concise statement
of the law, evidence and arguments relied on, and a discussion of the statutes,
cases, and textbooks cited in support of the position advanced.” (CRC, Rule
3.1113(b).)
By not having a memorandum, Defendant’s motion is borderline
incomprehensible. 
Defendant seeks to quash the process served on the grounds that the
process was not issued or served according to CCP § 416.90, summons check box
unclear if § 416.90 or other. 
“A summons may be served on a person not otherwise specified in this
article by delivering a copy of the summons and of the complaint to such person
or to a person authorized by him to receive service of process.” (CCP §
416.90.)
Defendant makes no explanation as to what its argument is with respect
to 416.90.
Defendant also submits a declaration that states:
1.) I am
named as the defendant in this matter and reside at 831 East Orange Grove ave ,
in Burbank Ca. 
2.) I have
never been personally served with a copy of the summons and complaint in this
case to my place of residents mentioned above. I am informed and believe that
on or about May 3d, 2024, someone affixed some legal documents along with a
note which have included as exhibit (B) to the outside wall by the front door
of my residents mentioned above. I have never received a copy of the summons
and complaint in this case through the mail to my place of residents mentioned
at the above address. 
3.) I have
included copies of the summons and complaint that was attached to the wall by
the door of my residents mentioned above as exhibit (A).
4.) Except
as described above, I have no knowledge of the delivery to me of the summons
and complaint in this case. 
5.) The
proof of service filed by the plaintiff, which is attached as exhibit (A), does
not indicate whether he mailed the summons and a copy of the complaint, and, in
fact, does not indicate that the summons and the copy of the complaint were
even served, and all that was seen was a date on the summons without any
clarity of the checked box to which proof of service CCP 416, with no name of
the person receiving the summons. Rather, the proof of service filed with the
complaint identifies the served papers with only a date. 
6.) I
declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the state of California that
the forgoing is true and correct.
(Yesaian Decl. ¶¶ 1-6.)
Confusingly, while the Yesaian Declaration at ¶ 5 refers to the
attached Exhibit A, the attached Exhibit A in Defendant’s moving papers isn’t
even a proof of service. It is simply a summons, but there is no proof of
service. 
Most importantly, Defendant does not state what the legal standard is
for a motion to quash service of process, and how it satisfied the legal
standard required for quashing service of process.
If this motion is not deemed moot, then the Court will likely deny
Defendant’s motion to quash. Defendant does not attempt to comply with CRC
3.1113(a) or (b), and Defendant makes no argument using legal authority as to
how it satisfied the standard required in order to quash service of process,
whatever that standard may be.
To the extent that Defendant thinks the motion to quash (Res ID 1837,
on calendar for 8-9-2024) is on calendar for 7-19-2024, Defendant is incorrect.
Further, the motion to quash (Res ID 1837) on calendar for 8-9-2024 would not
be timely for a hearing on 7-19-2024 because he motion to quash (Res ID 1837)
was not served by U.S. Mail until July 11, 2024. (See CCP § 1005(b).)
