ANALYSIS
Service
The
moving papers (motion and Lal Declaration) and the memorandum of costs on
appeal were served via email to mrupal@rupallaw.com. It is unclear if this was
the proper service address because eCourt does not list an email address for
Plaintiff’s counsel. eCourt lists a mailing address, but no email address is
listed for Plaintiff’s counsel. While the moving papers and the memorandum of
costs on appeal appear as if they would be timely under CCP § 1005(b) since
they were allegedly served on June 6, 2024, the Court cannot make the
determination if the papers were timely because it is unclear if Plaintiff’s
counsel received them in the first place.
The Court will hear argument.
Preliminary
The
Court notes that Defendants’ motion is written in a confusing manner that is
borderline incomprehensible at times. A significant amount of Defendants’
motion is entirely irrelevant and unhelpful, as Defendants set forth arguments
as if they are filing an anti-SLAPP motion, when in fact the instant motion is
a motion for attorney’s fees.
Background
Plaintiff
filed a Second Amended Complaint (SAC) on 7/14/2021. The SAC alleged ten causes
of action. Defendants filed a special motion to strike (anti-SLAPP motion)
against the ninth cause of action for Harassment/Retaliation and the tenth
cause of action for Conspiracy to Commit Abuse of Process and Actual Abuse of
Process.
In September 2021, this Court denied the anti-SLAPP
motion as to the ninth cause of action, but granted the motion as to the tenth
cause of action and struck the tenth cause of action.
Defendants filed an appeal to the Second Appellate
District of the Court of Appeal.
The court of appeal noted that this Court’s ruling on
the tenth cause of action was correct and that this Court’s ruling on the tenth
cause of action was not challenged on appeal. (Remittitur, p.6.) 
As to the ninth cause of action, the court of appeal
explained the two-step process involved in analyzing an anti-SLAPP motion. As
to the first step – whether the ninth cause of action was protected activity
under the anti-SLAPP statute – the court of appeal disagreed with this Court
and found that the ninth cause of action arose from protected activity.
The court of appeal explained that this Court should
have proceeded to the second step of the anti-SLAPP analysis and determined
whether Plaintiff established a probability of prevailing on the merits of the
ninth cause of action. (Remittitur, p. 11.) Therefore the court of appeal
remanded so that this Court may consider and resolve that question, which the
court of appeal explicitly stated, “[O]ne on which we now express no view.” (Remittitur,
p. 11.)
The court of appeal ruled:
The order granting in part and denying in
part defendant’s special motion to strike is vacated. The cause is remanded
with directions to enter a new and different order that maintains the court’s
ruling granting the special motion to strike the tenth cause of action and
that, consistent with the views expressed in this opinion, rules on whether the
ninth cause of action must also be stricken. Defendant is awarded costs on
appeal.
(Remittitur, p. 12.)
What This Motion Seeks
It is not entirely clear what this motion
seeks. It is clear that this motion seeks attorney’s fees. It appears, based on
reading the entire motion, that Defendants are seeking attorney’s fees for work
performed pertaining to the anti-SLAPP motion at the trial court level,
attorney’s fees for work performed pertaining to the anti-SLAPP at the court of
appeal level, and costs incurred from filing the appeal.
“A notice of motion
must state in the opening paragraph the nature of the order being sought and
the grounds for issuance of the order.” (CRC, rule 3.110(a).)
Here, the only thing Defendants state in the opening
paragraph of their notice of motion is, “PLEASE TAKE NOTICE THAT on July 5,
2024, 2024 at 8:30am or as soon thereafter as the Motion may be heard, in
Department E of the above-captioned Court located at 600 E. Broadway, Glendale,
California 91206. Defendants Govind Vaghashia and Sonal Vaghashia
(collectively, the “Govind Parties”) will and hereby do move the Court for an
Order re Motion for Attorney Fees.” (Mot. p. ii.)
This Court notes that the notice of motion does not
include how much in attorney’s fees the Defendants are seeking. Further, this
Court notes that the notice of motion does not indicate that Defendants are
seeking costs on appeal, as their separately filed memorandum of costs seems to
indicate. 
The only time the motion indicates how much Defendants
are seeking is located in the last paragraph of the motion: “Based on the above
foregoing reasons, it is respectfully requested that this court award the
Govind parties a prevailing party fee of $234,664.30 and increase the amount
based on the Loadstar Fee Adjustment.” (Mot. p. 19.)
Fees From Trial Court Work/Should This
Motion Be Continued
As
stated in CCP § 425.16(c)(1):
Except as provided in paragraph (2), in
any action subject to subdivision (b), a prevailing defendant on a special
motion to strike shall be entitled to recover that defendant’s attorney’s fees
and costs. If the court finds that a special motion to strike is frivolous or
is solely intended to cause unnecessary delay, the court shall award costs and
reasonable attorney’s fees to a plaintiff prevailing on the motion, pursuant to
Section 128.5.
(CCP § 425.16(c)(1).)
Defendants seem to be
arguing that they are entitled to attorney’s fees as the “prevailing party” on
the special motion to strike. While the Court agrees that 425.16(c)(1) allows
for the prevailing party to recover attorney’s fees and costs, Defendants’
moving papers fail to address several key issues, and at times misrepresent
facts of this case.
For example, Defendants
state, “The Govind parties are the prevailing parties on both Ninth Cause of
action for Harassment and filing false police report and the Tenth Cause of
Action for Abuse of Legal Process.” (Mot. p. 10.)
However, the Court fails
to understand how Defendants are the prevailing party as to the ninth cause of
action. 
Presumably, Defendants
are arguing that they are the prevailing party as to the tenth cause of action
because this Court granted Defendants’ motion to strike as to the tenth cause
of action.
However, as to the ninth
cause of action, the court of appeal directed this Court to proceed to the
second step of the anti-SLAPP analysis to determine whether Plaintiff
established a probability of prevailing on the merits of the ninth cause of
action.
Therefore, the Court is
not entirely clear how Defendants are arguing that they were the prevailing
party as to the ninth cause of action at the trial court level on the
anti-SLAPP motion. This Court has yet to rule on the ninth cause of action.
Defendants argue that the
term “prevailing party” in the anti-SLAPP statute must be interpreted broadly
to favor an award of attorney fees to a partially successful defendant such as
Defendants here. Defendants cite to City of Colton v. Singletary (2012)
142 Cal.App.4th 751 to support their argument, but Defendants don’t cite a page
number to support their argument.
Upon the Court’s perusal
of City of Colton, the Court found:
‘[A] party who partially prevails on
an anti-SLAPP motion must generally be considered a prevailing party unless the
results of the motion were so insignificant that the party did not achieve any
practical benefit from bringing the motion. The determination whether a party
prevailed on an anti-SLAPP motion lies within the broad discretion of [the]
trial court.’ [Citation.]” (Lin v. City of Pleasanton (2009)
176 Cal.App.4th 408, 425–426, 96 Cal.Rptr.3d 730.)
(City of Colton v.
Singletary (2012) 206 Cal.App.4th 751, 782.)
Despite Defendants
previously arguing that they were the prevailing party as to both the ninth and
tenth causes of action, Defendants then argue that even if they only partially
prevailed, they must be considered the prevailing party for purposes of an
attorney’s fee award based on City of Colton.
Defendants seem to be
confused, because they are citing City of Colton in context inapplicable
to the context here. City of Colton dealt with a partially prevailing
party in the sense that the party succeeded on some causes of action in the
anti-SLAPP motion and didn’t succeed on other causes of action on the
anti-SLAPP. 
However, that is not what
this Court is dealing with here. This Court has not yet ruled on the ninth
cause of action from when it was remanded back from the court of appeal. Therefore,
it has not yet been decided whether Defendants succeeded on their anti-SLAPP
motion with respect to the ninth cause of action.
Therefore, the Court will
hear argument as to if this motion should be continued, or if Defendants want
this motion heard, despite the fact that there has been no ruling on the ninth
cause of action.
Attorney’s Fees and Costs
on Appeal
It
is not entirely clear as to the legal authority in which Defendants believe
they can seek attorney’s fees on appeal. 
For example, Defendants
“Preliminary Statement” in their Notice states:
This motion is based on California Rules
of Court 8.278 (d)(2) which states as follows; Rules of Court 8.278 (c)(1)-
Within 40 days after issuance of the remittitur, a party claiming costs awarded
by a reviewing court must serve and file in the superior court a verified
memorandum of costs under rule 3.1700 and Rules of Court 8.278 (d)(2) (2)-
Unless the court orders otherwise, an award of costs neither includes
attorney's fees on appeal nor precludes a party from seeking them under rule
3.1702.
California Rules of Court 3.1702. Rule
3.1702 (c) Attorney's fees on appeal(1) - A notice of motion to claim
attorney's fees on appeal -other than the attorney's fees on appeal claimed
under (b) under a statute or contract requiring the court to determine
entitlement to the fees, the amount of the fees, or both, must be served and
filed within the time for serving and filing the memorandum of costs under rule
8.278(c)(1) in an unlimited civil case or under rule 8.891(c)(1) in a limited
civil case.
(Mot. p. iii-iv.)
Despite citing the
various California Rules of Court above, Defendants’ motion does not address
these rules, nor does it apply the facts to the rules and explain why they are
applicable or how certain requirements have been met. Also, when Defendants
state above that “…8.278(d)(2) which states as follows;..” the Court notes that
8.278(d)(2) did not state what Defendants alleged it to state.
Defendants should be
prepared to discuss the California Rules of Court that they cited on pages
iii-iv and why or how they are applicable. 
It is also unclear if
Defendants are seeking attorney’s fees for their appellate work based on the
court of appeal stating, “Defendant is awarded costs on appeal.” (Remittitur,
p. 12.) 
As noted in Mann v.
Quality Old Time Service, Inc.:
A “prevailing party” with respect to an
appellate cost award is not necessarily the same as a “prevailing party” under
the anti-SLAPP statute. (Compare § 425.16, subd. (c) with Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 27.) Moreover, although a prevailing party is generally
entitled to costs on appeal, appellate courts have the discretion to deviate
from the general “prevailing party” rule in “the interests of justice,” and
make any award or apportionment of costs that it determines is appropriate.
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 27(a)(4); see Eisenberg et al., Cal. Practice Guide:
Civil Appeals & Writs (The Rutter Group 2004) ¶ 14:61, p. 14–12; see Dobbins
v. Hardister (1966) 242 Cal.App.2d 787, 798, 51 Cal.Rptr. 866; Stuckey
v. Stuckey (1964) 231 Cal.App.2d 382, 387, 41 Cal.Rptr. 792.) Because
the Mann decision was silent on the reason for the cost award,
the trial court erred in inferring the award reflected a determination that
defendants were the prevailing parties for purposes of the anti-SLAPP
proceedings.
(Mann
v. Quality Old Time Service, Inc. (2006) 139 Cal.App.4th 328, 341.)
While it is unclear to
the Court as to what Defendants are arguing allows them to recover attorney’s
fees for the work on appeal, the Court notes the following:
The trial court's authority to award
fees and costs under section 425.16, subdivision (c), includes authority
to award fees incurred in responding to an appeal of an order granting or
denying a special motion to strike, or of an order awarding **845 attorney
fees in connection with such motion. (See Wilkerson v. Sullivan (2002)
99 Cal.App.4th 443, 448, 121 Cal.Rptr.2d 275.) “A statute authorizing an
attorney fee award at the trial court level includes appellate attorney fees
unless the statute specifically provides otherwise. [Citations.]” (Evans v.
Unkow (1995) 38 Cal.App.4th 1490, 1499, 45 Cal.Rptr.2d
624.) Section 425.16, subdivision (c), does not preclude recovery of
appellate attorney fees; hence attorney fees recoverable under the statute
include appellate fees. (Ibid.; see also Dove Audio,
Inc. v. Rosenfeld, Meyer & Susman (1996) 47 Cal.App.4th 777, 785,
54 Cal.Rptr.2d 830.)
(Carpenter v. Jack in
the Box Corp. (2007) 151 Cal.App.4th 454, 461.)
The Court will hear
argument as to if, or what, Defendants are seeking based on the appeal.
If The Court Hears This
Motion
As
explained in Mann v. Quality Time Service, Inc.:
The California Supreme Court has upheld
the lodestar method for determining the appropriate amount of attorney fees for
a prevailing defendant on an anti-SLAPP motion. (Ketchum, supra, 24
Cal.4th at p. 1136, 104 Cal.Rptr.2d 377, 17 P.3d 735.) Under this method, a
court assesses attorney fees by first determining the time spent and the
reasonable hourly compensation of each attorney. (Id. at pp.
1131–1132, 104 Cal.Rptr.2d 377, 17 P.3d 735.) The court next determines whether
that lodestar figure should be adjusted based on various relevant factors (id. at
p. 1132, 104 Cal.Rptr.2d 377, 17 P.3d 735), including a plaintiff's limited
success in the litigation (Sokolow v. County of San Mateo (1989)
213 Cal.App.3d 231, 249, 261 Cal.Rptr. 520; Californians for
Responsible Toxics Management v. Kizer (1989) 211 Cal.App.3d 961,
973–975, 259 Cal.Rptr. 599; see also Feminist Women's Health Center v.
Blythe (1995) 32 Cal.App.4th 1641, 1674, 39 Cal.Rptr.2d 189). In
determining the lodestar amount, a prevailing party generally may not recover
for work on causes of action on which the party was
unsuccessful. (See ComputerXpress, supra, 93 Cal.App.4th
at p. 1020, 113 Cal.Rptr.2d 625.)
 (Mann v. Quality Old Time Service, Inc.
(2006) 139 Cal.App.4th 328, 342.)
Further, as explained in City
of Colton v. Singletary:
“As the moving party, the prevailing
defendant seeking fees and costs ‘ “bear[s] the burden of establishing
entitlement to an award and documenting the appropriate hours expended and
hourly rates.” [Citation.] To that end, the court may require [a] defendant[ ]
to produce records sufficient to provide “ ‘a proper basis for determining how
much time was spent on particular claims.’ ” [Citation.] The court also may
properly reduce compensation on account of any failure to maintain appropriate
time records. [Citation.]' [Citation.] The evidence should allow the court to
consider whether the case was overstaffed, how much time the attorneys spent on
particular claims, and whether the hours were reasonably expended.
[Citation.]” (Christian Research, supra, 165 Cal.App.4th at p.
1320, 81 Cal.Rptr.3d 866.)
“Although a fee request ordinarily should
be documented in great detail, it cannot be said ... that the absence of time
records and billing statements deprive[s] [a] trial court of substantial
evidence to support an award....” (Weber v. Langholz (1995) 39
Cal.App.4th 1578, 1587, 46 Cal.Rptr.2d 677.) “[T]he verified time
statements of [an] attorney [ ], as [an] officer[ ] of the court, are entitled
to credence in the absence of a clear indication the records are
erroneous.” (Horsford v. Board of Trustees of California State
University (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 359, 396, 33 Cal.Rptr.3d 644 (Horsford ).)
(City of Colton v.
Singletary (2012) 206 Cal.App.4th 751, 784-785.)
 
Costs
The
motion and Lal declaration does not state how much in costs that Defendants are
seeking. The motion simply states that Defendants are seeking a fee of
$234,664.30.
Defendants’ motion does
not address their memorandum of costs or explain how much in costs Defendants
are seeking. 
 
The Court will hear
argument
