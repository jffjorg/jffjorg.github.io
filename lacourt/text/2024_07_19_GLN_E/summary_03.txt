And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The tentatively ruling judge notes that the motion to quash service of summons filed by the defendant, Verjine Yesaian, is unclear and lacks a supporting memorandum. The defendant's declaration also lacks clarity and fails to state the legal standard for quashing service of process. The judge is unsure if the defendant is aware of the motion that is being heard on July 19, 2024, which pertains to a different motion to quash service of summons. The court will hear argument on whether the motion to quash (Res ID 4249) should be denied as moot in light of the filing of a different motion to quash (Res ID 1837) on calendar for August 9, 2024. The judge tentatively rules that if the motion is not deemed moot, the court will likely deny the defendant's motion to quash.
