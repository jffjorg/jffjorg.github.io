And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by defendants Anthony Hsieh and LoanDepot.com, LLC to the complaint filed by plaintiff Amir Edwards. The court has sustained the demurrer with leave to amend for the following reasons:

* The complaint fails to allege any facts against defendant Hsieh, including any alter ego allegations, and therefore, the demurrer is sustained with leave to amend.
* The complaint is uncertain on its face because it remains unclear what role, if any, Hsieh played in the subject transaction and what the bases for the claims are.
* The breach of contract cause of action fails to state facts sufficient to support a claim against defendants because the complaint does not allege the terms of the agreement, what the breach of the agreement was, or that the plaintiff suffered any injury.
* The negligence cause of action fails to state facts sufficient to support a claim against defendants because the complaint does not allege a legal duty owed to the plaintiff by defendants and does not allege how defendants breached that duty and was injured as a result of that breach.
* The fraud cause of action fails to state facts sufficient to support a claim against defendants because the complaint does not allege the names of the persons who made the allegedly fraudulent representations, their authority to speak, to whom they spoke, what they said or wrote, and when it was said or written.
* The common counts cause of action fails to state facts sufficient to support a claim against defendants because the complaint does not present a copy of, or any details regarding, the purported agreement under which either of the defendants agreed to be indebted to the plaintiff and the plaintiff's prior allegations directly contradict the claim for account stated.

The court has granted defendant's request for judicial notice of a Deed of Trust recorded on February 22, 2022.
