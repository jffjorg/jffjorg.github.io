And here is the English-text summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Defendant, Barbara Medovoy, moves for $4,500 in attorney fees for prevailing on the special motion to strike the Plaintiff's complaint. The motion remains unopposed, and the court awards 8.5 hours at the $450 billable rate for a total fee of $3,825. The court also awards $120 in filing fees. The Defendant is entitled to attorney fees as a result of successfully prevailing on the special motion to strike, and the court finds the hourly fee reasonable given counsel's experience and nature of the claim. The court only deducts the one and one half hours added to the fee request in that the motion remains unopposed and no written reply is presented. Any argument for oral reply is subsumed within the appearance hours included in the award.
