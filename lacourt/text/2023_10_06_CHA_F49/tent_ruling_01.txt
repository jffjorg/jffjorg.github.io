Motion
for Attorney Fees
 
SUMMARY
OF ACTION
On
December 1, 2022, plaintiff Prince Marboubian filed a complaint against
defendant Barbara Medovoy for breach of contract alleging said breach as a
result of a “wrongful eviction.”
 
On
March 1, 2023, the court granted the unopposed special motion to strike the complaint.
On March 20, 2023, the court granted the ex parte motion to vacate the March 1,
2023, and reset the hearing for May 10, 2023. On April 19, 2023, the court
entered the stipulation of the parties confirming the ex parte order vacating
the March 1, 2023, order and resetting the hearing for May 10, 2023. On May 10,
2023, the court reset the hearing for July 12, 2023. 
 
On
July 12, 2023, the court granted the special motion to strike the complaint.
 
RULING: Granted.
Defendant
Barbara Medovoy moves for a $4,500 in attorney fees represented as 10 hours of
work at $450/hour. The motion remains unopposed at the time of the tentative
ruling publication cutoff. The court electronic filing system shows no reply at
the time of the tentative ruling publication cutoff.
 
Defendants
are entitled to attorney fees as a result of successfully prevailing on the
special motion to strike. (Code Civ. Proc., § 425.16, subd. (c)(1); Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1141-1142.)
“An award of attorney fees to a
prevailing defendant on an anti-SLAPP motion properly
includes attorney fees incurred to litigate the
special motion to strike (the merits fees) plus
the fees incurred in connection with litigating
the fee award itself (the fees on fees).” (569
East County Boulevard LLC v. Backcountry Against the Dump, Inc. (2016) 6 Cal.App.5th 426, 433; Wanland v. Law Offices of Mastagni, Holstedt
& Chiurazzi (2006) 141 Cal.App.4th 15, 21.)
 
The lodestar method for
determination of fees applies in special motions to strike. (Ketchum v. Moses,
supra, 24 Cal.4th at p. 1136.) 
 
“‘[T]he lodestar is the basic fee for comparable
legal services in the community; it may be adjusted by the court based on
factors including, as relevant herein, (1) the novelty and difficulty of the
questions involved, (2) the skill displayed in presenting them, (3) the extent
to which the nature of the litigation precluded other employment by the
attorneys, (4) the contingent nature of the fee award. [Citation.] The purpose
of such adjustment is to fix a fee at the fair market value for the particular
action. In effect, the court determines, retrospectively, whether the
litigation involved a contingent risk or required extraordinary legal skill
justifying augmentation of the unadorned lodestar in order to approximate the
fair market rate for such services.’” (Graciano v. Robinson
Ford Sales, Inc. (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 140, 154.)
 
The reasonableness of attorney fees
lies within the discretion of the trial court. (PLCM Group v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1096.) The court
makes it determination based on the consideration of a number of factors,
including, “the nature of the litigation, its difficulty, the amount involved,
the skill required in its handling, the skill employed, the attention given,
the success or failure, and other circumstances in the case.” (Ibid.) The court should apply an
objective standard of reasonableness. (Id.
at p. 1098.)
“A fee request that appears unreasonably inflated is a special circumstance
permitting the trial court to reduce the award or deny one altogether.” (Serrano v. Unruh (1982) 32 Cal.3d
621, 635.)
 
The attorneys fees and costs recoverable are
only those incurred as to the special motion to strike, and not as to other
litigation events. (Lafayette Morehouse,
Inc. v. Chronicle Pub. Co. (1995) 39 Cal.App.4th 1379, 1383.) “[W]e conclude a
defendant should not be entitled to obtain as a matter of right his
or her entire attorney fees incurred on successful and unsuccessful claims merely
because the attorney work on those claims was overlapping. Instead, the court
should first determine the lodestar amount for the hours expended on the
successful claims, and, if the work on the successful and unsuccessful causes
of action was overlapping, the court should then consider the defendant's
relative success on the motion in achieving his or her objective, and reduce
the amount if appropriate.” (Mann v.
Quality Old Time Service, Inc. (2006) 139 Cal.App.4th 328, 344–345.) 
 
Counsel
represents all hours apply to the motion: four hours in preparation of the
motion to strike, two and one half hours on the reply, one half hour for the
appearance, one and one half hours for the instant motion, plus an anticipated
one and one half hours on any reply, if applicable, and finally an additional
one half hour for an appearance on the instant motion.
 
The
court finds the hourly fee reasonable given counsel’s experience and nature of
the claim. The time spent on the special motion to strike including the reset
hearing also appears reasonable as well. 
 
The
court only deducts the one and one half hours added to the fee request in that
the motion remains unopposed at the time of the tentative ruling publication,
and no written reply is presented. Any argument for oral reply is subsumed
within the appearance hours included in the award.
 
The court therefore
awards 8.5 hours at the $450 billable rate for a total fee of $3,825. The court
also awards $120 in filing fees. Defendant to submit a judgment to the court.
 
Defendant
to give notice.
