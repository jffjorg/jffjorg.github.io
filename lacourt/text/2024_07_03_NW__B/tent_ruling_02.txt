BACKGROUND
 
This action arises from an automobile
accident which occurred on August 22, 2019. On March 4, 2021, Plaintiff Bahman
Khodayari (“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint against Defendants Noberto Martinez
Cruz (“Cruz”) and Javier Martinez Mendez (collectively, the “Defendants”), and
Does 1 to 10, inclusive, alleging causes of action for: (1) Motor Vehicle; and
(2) General Negligence. 
 
On March 11, 2022, Defendants filed and
served a joint Answer to the Complaint. 
 
On March 21, 2022, Defendants filed and
served a joint Answer to the Complaint, which appears to be a duplicate of the
joint Answer filed 3/11/2. 
 
On August 7, 2023, Defendant Cruz filed
and served a motion to compel Plaintiff’s responses to set one of Defendant
Cruz’s form interrogatories and request for monetary sanctions; a motion to
compel Plaintiff’s responses to set one of Defendant Cruz’s special
interrogatories and request for monetary sanctions; and a motion to compel
Plaintiff’s responses to set one of Defendant Cruz’s demand for production of
documents and request for monetary sanctions (collectively, the “Motions”). 
 
On March 13, 2024, the Court granted
the Motions and noted that the Motions were all unopposed. (03/13/24 Minute
Order at p. 2.) The Motions were granted without a hearing as there was no
appearance by Plaintiff and counsel for Defendant Cruz submitted on the Court’s
tentative ruling. (03/13/24 Minute Order at p. 1.) The Court ordered Plaintiff
to serve verified responses to Defendant Cruz’s (1) form interrogatories, set
one, (2) special interrogatories, set one, and (3) demand for inspection of
documents, set one, without objections, within 20 days. (03/13/24 Minute Order
at p. 2.) The Court also awarded Defendant Cruz sanctions in the sum of $184.95
and ordered such sanctions to be paid by Plaintiff to Defendant Cruz within 20
days. (03/13/24 Minute Order at p. 3.) Defendant Cruz was ordered to give
notice of the Court’s order. (03/13/24 Minute Order at p. 3.) 
 
On April 4, 2024, Defendant Cruz filed
and served notice of the Court’s March 13, 2024 order. The proof of service
attached thereto shows that Plaintiff was served with the Court’s March 13,
2024 order via mail on April 4, 2024. 
 
On April 29, 2024, Defendants filed and
served the instant Motion for Terminating Sanctions Against Plaintiff (the
“Motion”). The Motion is made on the grounds that Plaintiff failed to comply
with the Court’s March 13, 2024 order. Defendants move for an order entering a
judgment of dismissal in favor of Defendants for Plaintiff’s failure to comply
with the Court’s March 13, 2024 order. 
 
On April 30, 2024, after hearing, the
Court granted Defendants’ ex parte application to continue trial and the
Court continued non-jury trial from May 13, 2024 to September 13, 2024.
(04/30/24 Minute Order.) 
 
On May 24, 2024, Plaintiff filed and served
an opposition to the Motion. 
 
On May 31, 2024, Defendants filed and
served their reply brief. 
 
On June 5, 2024, this action was
reassigned from the Honorable Michelle C. Kim to the Honorable Karen Moskowitz
in Department B at Van Nuys Courthouse East for all purposes effective June 24,
2024.
 
On June 5, 2024, the Court, on its own
motion, continued the hearing on the Motion from June 5, 2024 to July 3, 2024
in Department B at Van Nuys Courthouse East. (06/05/24 Minute Order.) 
 
On June 24, 2024, Plaintiff filed a
response to Defendants’ reply brief. The Court did not authorize Plaintiff to
file a response to the reply brief. Plaintiff filed a sur-reply, which the
Court did not permit and is generally not permitted as it deprives Defendants
of the opportunity to respond. (Jay v. Mahaffey (2013) 218 Cal.App.4th
1522, 1537-38.) The Court therefore strikes Plaintiff’s response to the reply
and will not consider such improper filing pursuant to CCP § 436. 
 
[Tentative] Ruling
 
The Court DENIES
WITHOUT PREJUDICE Defendants’ Motion for Terminating Sanctions Against
Plaintiff (the “Motion”). 
 
DISCUSSION
A misuse of the discovery process is failing to respond or to submit to
an authorized method of discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subd.
(d).) A misuse of the discovery process also includes disobeying a court
order to provide discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (g).) A court
may impose terminating sanctions, issue sanctions, evidence sanctions, or
monetary sanctions against a party engaging in misuse of the discovery process.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030.) Where an issue sanction is imposed, “designated
facts shall be taken as established in the action in accordance with the claim
of the party adversely affected by the misuse of the discovery process.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (b).) An issue sanction may also involve “any
party engaging in misuse of the discovery process from supporting or opposing
designated claims or defenses.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (b).) An
evidence sanction involves “an order prohibiting any party engaging in the
misuse of the discovery process from introducing designated matters in
evidence.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (c).)  
A terminating sanction may be imposed by the court by one of the
following orders: (1) an order striking out the pleadings or parts of the
pleadings of any party engaging in the misuse of the discovery process; (2) an
order staying further proceedings by that party until an order for discovery is
obeyed; (3) an order dismissing the action, or any part of the action, of that
party; or (4) an order rending judgment by default against that party. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (d)(1)-(4).)  
“The discovery statutes evince an incremental approach to discovery
sanctions, starting with monetary sanctions and ending with the ultimate
sanction of termination.” (Doppes v. Bentley Motors, Inc. (2009) 174
Cal.App.4th 967, 992.)  “Discovery sanctions should be appropriate to the
dereliction, and should not exceed that which is required to protect the
interests of the party entitled to but denied discovery.” (Ibid.)
“[C]ontinuing misuses of the discovery process warrant incrementally harsher
sanctions until the sanction is reached that will curb the abuse.”  (Ibid.)
Where discovery violations are “willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and
the evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with
discovery rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate
sanction.” (Ibid.)  A trial court has broad discretion to impose
discovery sanctions, but two facts are generally a prerequisite to the
imposition of nonmonetary sanctions. (Biles v. Exxon Mobil Corp. (2004)
124 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1327.) When discovery sanctions are requested, there must
be a failure to comply with a court order and the failure must be willful. (Ibid.)   
“A decision to order terminating sanctions should not be made lightly.” (Creed-21
v. City of Wildomar (2017) 18 Cal.App.5th 690, 702.) A trial court’s order
to impose terminating sanctions will be reversed only if it “was arbitrary,
capricious, or whimsical.” (Ibid.) Trial courts have properly imposed
terminating sanctions when parties have willfully disobeyed one or more
discovery orders. (Los Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez (2014) 223
Cal.App.4th 377, 390.) Terminating sanctions are warranted when a party’s lack
of compliance with the discovery process has caused the opposing party
prejudice. (Doppes v. Bentley Motors, Inc., supra, 174
Cal.App.4th 967, 989.) 
 
 
Evidence in Support of
the Motion
In support of the
Motion, Defendants’ counsel, Sharon Pak, Esq. (“Pak”), provides a declaration.
Ms. Pak declares the following: on May 18, 2022, Defendants served Plaintiff
with Set One of Demand for Inspection of Documents, Form Interrogatories, and
Special Interrogatories. (Pak Decl., ¶ 4.) Numerous extensions were granted but
no responses were provided. (Id., ¶ 4.) On August 7, 2023, Defendants
filed a Notice of Motion to Compel Responses to Discovery. (Id., ¶ 5.)
The Court granted Defendants’ motions on March 13, 2024, and Plaintiff was
ordered to provide verified responses, without objections, to the discovery
requests within 20 days. (Id., ¶ 6.) Plaintiff was served with notice of
the Court’s March 13, 2024 ruling. (Id., ¶ 7; Ex. A.) As of the date of
the Motion, Defendants have yet to receive responses to the discovery as
ordered by the Court. (Id., ¶ 9.) 
In connection with the
reply brief, Ms. Pak declares that Plaintiff provided unverified and wholly
deficient responses on May 23, 2024. (Pak Reply Decl., ¶ 7; Ex. C.) Trial is
currently scheduled for September 13, 2024, and Plaintiff’s continuous failure
to provide verified discovery responses is prejudicing Defendants’ ability to
properly evaluate and defend the case. (Id., ¶ 8.) 
Evidence in Opposition
to the Motion 
Plaintiff declares that
he did not receive notice of the motions to compel discovery or the Court’s
March 13, 2024 order. (Khodayari Decl., ¶¶ 6-7.) Plaintiff states that upon
becoming aware of the Court’ s order, he took immediate steps to address the outstanding
discovery obligations and has hired a paralegal to expedite the preparation and
submission of the required documents and responses. (Id., ¶ 8.) Plaintiff
states that he has submitted the responses to Defendants on May 23, 2024, and
that his failure to comply was not due to willful disobedience or disregard for
the Court’s authority. (Id., ¶¶ 9-11; Exs. 1-2.) 
Appropriateness of
Imposing Terminating Sanctions 
Initially, the Court rejects Plaintiff’s contention in
the opposition that Plaintiff was not notified of the Court’s March 13, 2024
hearing date and minute order. (Khodayari Decl., ¶¶ 6-7.) Defendants filed a
proof of service showing that: (1) Plaintiff was served with the motions to
compel; and (2) Plaintiff was served with the Court’s March 13, 2024 minute
order. 
 The Court has reviewed Plaintiff’s purported
discovery responses and finds that they are all unverified. (Pak Reply Decl.,
Ex. C.) The Court reminds Plaintiff that “[u]nsworn responses are tantamount to
no responses at all.” (Appleton v. Superior Court (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d
632, 636.) While Plaintiff has chosen to represent himself in pro per,
Plaintiff is still held to the same standard as an attorney. (Kobayashi v.
Superior Court (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 536, 543.) As such, the Court deems
Plaintiff’s unverified responses to be no response at all, and the Court finds
that Plaintiff has failed to comply with the Court’s March 13, 2024 order. 
Plaintiff
has disobeyed one order of this Court pertaining to discovery. The Court,
however, must take an incremental approach to sanctions and therefore the Court
does not find that terminating sanctions are appropriate at this time. The
Court cannot impose sanctions beyond that which are required to protect Defendants’
interests. (Doppes, supra, 174 Cal.App.4th 967, 992.) While issue
or evidentiary sanctions may have been appropriate, Defendants did not request
such sanctions. 
The
Court therefore DENIES Defendants’ request for terminating sanctions. 
The
Court, however, ORDERS Plaintiff to comply with the Court’s March 13, 2024
order forthwith and in any event no later than 20 days from the date of notice
of this order. 
CONCLUSION
 
The Motion is DENIED WITHOUT
PREJUDICE. 
 
Plaintiff is ORDERED to comply with the Court’s March 13, 2024 order
forthwith and in any event no later than 20 days from the date of notice of
this order. 
 
Moving party is ordered to give
notice.
