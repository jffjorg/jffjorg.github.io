Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court denies the Motion for Terminating Sanctions filed by Defendant Cruz, without prejudice. The Court finds that Plaintiff has failed to comply with the Court's March 13, 2024 order to provide discovery responses, but does not find that terminating sanctions are appropriate at this time. The Court orders Plaintiff to comply with the Court's order forthwith and in any event no later than 20 days from the date of notice of this order.
