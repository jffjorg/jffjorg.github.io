And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the motion to set aside the default judgment filed by the defendant, The Hertz Corporation. The court finds that the defendant has shown mistake and excusable neglect in failing to timely file its demurrer, and that the plaintiff does not state any prejudice that she will incur if the default is set aside. The court also finds that the plaintiff failed to serve a statement of damages on the defendant, but that the defendant has not shown a basis to set aside the default on equitable grounds. The court grants the motion and orders the defendant to file and serve its proposed demurrer within 10 days of the order.
