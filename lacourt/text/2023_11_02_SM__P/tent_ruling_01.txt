WW Westwood v.
Westside Multispecialty Surgery Center, Case No. 22SMCV00171
Hearing Date
November 2, 2023 
Plaintiff W.W.
Westwood L.P.’s Motion to Strike Answer (UNOPPOSED) 
 
This case began as
an unlawful detainer by a commercial property owner WW Westwood against tenant
Westside Multispecialty. As possession is no longer at issue, the action
converted to breach of lease. On July 17, 2023 the court granted counsel for defendant
Westside’s motion to be relieved and ordered Westside to retain new counsel by
August 16, 2023. As defendant Westside has not retained new counsel, plaintiff
W.W. Westwood moves to strike the answer. 
 
A corporation can
only appear in an action through counsel; it cannot represent itself pro per. Merco
Construction Engineers, Inc. v. Municipal Court (1978) 21 Cal.3d 724. Westside
remains unrepresented, in violation of the court’s order of over three months
ago. See 7/17/2023 minute order; Villagomez declaration ¶¶7-8. As
Westside is a corporation, it cannot appear in pro per, and the action cannot
proceed while defendant Westside is unrepresented. Defendant’s failure to
comply with the court’s order means the litigation cannot proceed. The
terminating sanctions plaintiff seeks are appropriate, and defendant Westside
does not oppose this motion. 
 
The court will not
award monetary sanctions, as plaintiff has not provided evidence explaining the
basis of its request for $6,375, and the amount appears excessive. GRANTED. Defendant
Westside’s answer is stricken.
