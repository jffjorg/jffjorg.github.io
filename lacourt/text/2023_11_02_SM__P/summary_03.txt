And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling concerns a case where the defendant Cabo has filed a demurrer and motion to strike portions of the first amended complaint. The plaintiffs, Hannley, et al., allege that the defendants harassed and intimidated them, attempting to convince plaintiff Edalat to drop pending lawsuits. Specifically, plaintiff Saachi alleges elder abuse and intentional infliction of emotional distress, and claims that the defendants concealed their identities and sent her a package with a defamatory website printout. The defendant Cabo argues that the claims are time-barred due to the two-year statute of limitations, and that Saatchi has not adequately alleged facts showing his liability. The court has overruled the statute of limitations argument, finding that the discovery rule applies and that the statute of limitations was tolled due to the defendants' concealment of their identities. However, the court has sustained Cabo's demurrer to the claims of elder abuse and intentional infliction of emotional distress, finding that the FAC fails to adequately allege Cabo's liability based on conspiracy. The court has also sustained Cabo's demurrer to the claim of alter ego liability, finding that the FAC does not allege a unity of interest and ownership between Cabo and the other defendants. Finally, the court has found that the motion to strike the request for damages and fees is moot, since the demurrer to all causes of action against Cabo was sustained.
