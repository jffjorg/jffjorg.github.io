The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of WW Westwood v. Westside Multispecialty Surgery Center, case number 22SMCV00171.

Westside Multispecialty Surgery Center, the defendant, was ordered to retain new counsel, but it has failed to do so. As a corporation, Westside can only appear in an action through counsel, and it cannot represent itself pro per. The Judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to strike the defendant's answer and has imposed terminating sanctions, meaning the litigation cannot proceed. The Judge has not awarded monetary sanctions, as the plaintiff did not provide evidence to support its request for $6,375. The defendant does not oppose the motion, and the Judge has ordered that the defendant's answer be stricken.
