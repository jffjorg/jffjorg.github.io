Builders, Inc. v. Shafighi, Case No. 22SMCV01524
Hearing
Date November 2, 2023 
Attorney
Turner’s Motion to be Relieved as Counsel for Defendant Shafighi (UNOPPOSED) 
 
Attorney
Keith Turner moves to be relieved as counsel for defendant Shafighi. The motion
is on the judicial counsel forms – MC-051-MC-053 – required under CA Rule of
Court 3.1362. The proof of service indicates Shafighi and opposing counsel were
properly served.
 
Turner
states there has been an “irreparable break down in the attorney-client
relationship[.]” Turner decl., pg. 1. This is a valid basis for withdrawal.
Additionally, as no substantive hearings are scheduled in the near future,
Shafighi is unlikely to suffer undue prejudice if the motion is granted. Further,
Shafhighi does not oppose the motion. GRANTED.
