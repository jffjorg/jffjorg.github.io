And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling was issued by the court in the case of Jacqueline Rivera vs. City of Los Angeles, et al. The plaintiff alleges that she was fired as a police cadet due to her disability and pregnancy. The defendants have filed their joint answer and the case is set for jury trial on April 15, 2024.

The plaintiff has moved the court for an order to produce certain documents related to her termination and pregnancy discrimination. The defendants argue that the motion was not properly served and that the court should not consider it. The court has continued the motion to allow further discovery and has ordered counsel to meet and confer to reach a stipulation regarding what materials the plaintiff seeks that the defense would withhold based on Pitchess.

The court has also addressed the issue of the discovery cut-off in the case, stating that the deadlines are pegged to the current trial date and that the defense cannot suddenly claim that the time for discovery is over. The court has further stated that the motion is not a proper Pitchess motion and that counsel should discuss the categories of documents sought by the plaintiff and agree on what materials would be withheld based on Pitchess.
