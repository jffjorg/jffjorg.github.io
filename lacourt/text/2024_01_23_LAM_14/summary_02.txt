Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by Defendants County of Los Angeles, Noe Garcia, David Pantoja, Daisy Rosales, Michael McMorrow, Michael Lopez, Juan Bendezu, Adonay Molina, Leonel Mejia, Pedro Valencia, and Daniel Rodriguez. The demurrer was filed on the grounds that the Third Amended Complaint (TAC) is uncertain and fails to state facts sufficient to constitute causes of action.

The court has ruled that the demurrer is overruled, as the TAC is sufficient to state causes of action. The court also found that Government Code § 821.6 does not provide immunity to Defendants Valencia and Rodriguez, as the alleged conduct was not related to the institution or prosecution of an official proceeding.

The court also addressed the remaining issues raised by Defendants, finding that they represent factual questions that require evidence to resolve. The court noted that it remains open to persuasion on an evidentiary motion such as summary adjudication.

The case will proceed to a jury trial on May 20, 2024.
