And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the dispute between Walter Mitchell, a blind individual, and Covenant Living Communities and Services, a senior living facility. Mitchell alleges that the facility's website is not compatible with his screen-reading software, making it impossible for him to access the website. The facility has demurred to the complaint, arguing that Mitchell lacks standing to sue because he has not pled eligibility to use their services. The judge has denied the facility's request for judicial notice and granted Mitchell's request for judicial notice as to Exhibit 1. The judge has sustained the demurrer, giving Mitchell 10 days to amend his pleadings to include facts showing his interest in and eligibility for the facility's services. The case is governed by the Unruh Civil Rights Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act, and the judge has cited relevant statutes and case law in reaching his decision.
