And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a demurrer filed by the defendants, which challenges the sufficiency of the complaints filed by the plaintiffs. The judge finds that the plaintiffs have alleged sufficient facts to support their claims of civil rights violations, assault and battery, false imprisonment, and negligence. The judge also finds that the defendants' reliance on Government Code section 821.6, which provides immunity to public employees for injuries caused by their official duties, is misplaced. The judge notes that this code section is intended to protect government employees from claims of injury based on their official duties, but it does not apply to claims of negligence.

The judge also rejects the defendants' argument that the plaintiffs' claims must be dismissed because they do not allege physical injury. The judge finds that the plaintiffs' claims are based on the defendants' alleged negligence and failure to follow proper procedures, and that physical injury is not an element of these claims.

Finally, the judge notes that the remaining issues raised by the defendants, such as the question of whether Defendant Noe Garcia can be held liable for his actions, represent factual questions that require evidence to resolve. The judge therefore overrules the demurrer and allows the plaintiffs' claims to proceed.
