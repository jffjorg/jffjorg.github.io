 Case Number:  BC631751    Hearing Date:   January 23, 2024    Dept:  14 Case Background
 
Plaintiff Shahrokh
Mireskandari had a high-profile law practice in England, bringing race
discrimination claims against public entities. In 2008, Plaintiff was the
subject of a 12-article series in the Daily Mail. These articles discussed disciplinary
proceedings taken against Plaintiff, potential financial issues at his firm,
and his educational background, right down to his grades.
Plaintiff responded by filing lawsuits in England, in Virginia, and here in
California. The lawsuit which is relevant here was filed in the
Central District of California in 2012 and heard by Judge Margaret M. Morrow.
The complaint in that case alleged a series of invasion of privacy and
interference torts. It was ultimately dismissed under California’s anti-SLAPP
statute.
 
Plaintiff then filed a malpractice lawsuit
against the firm of Edwards Wildman Palmer (“EWP”) and Dominique Shelton (“Shelton”),
the attorneys who initially represented him before Judge Morrow. That action was
assigned to this department and bore Case No. BC 517 799. Plaintiff’s
complaints in that case followed two fundamental theories: (1) EWP and Ms.
Shelton had failed to even discuss anti-SLAPP law with him, and (2) EWP and Ms.
Shelton had improperly started acting against his interests (based on a fee dispute)
while still his counsel of record. 
 
That case resulted in two published
Court of Appeal opinions: Edwards Wildman Palmer LLP v. Superior Court
(2014) 231 Cal.App.4th 1214 and Mireskandari v. Edwards Wildman
Palmer LLP (2022) 77 Cal.App.5th 247. In the latter opinion, the
Court of Appeal upheld a defense verdict on breach of contract and breach of
fiduciary duty but reversed a grant of summary adjudication on a negligence
cause of action. On remand, after Plaintiff filed a peremptory challenge to Judge
Terry Green, the case was assigned to Judge Michael Stern. It has recently been
dismissed.
 
Plaintiff also filed a malpractice
action against three other firms: Marks & Sokolov, Novak Druce Connolly
Bove & Quigg, and Seyfarth Shaw, LLP. Those firms also represented
Plaintiff, at different times, in the litigation before Judge Morrow, as well
as in other litigation conducted in the same District before Judge Jesus G.
Bernal. The lawsuit against these three firms was assigned to Judge Gregory
Keosian and bore Case No. BC 531 449. It was ultimately dismissed, and the
dismissal was affirmed by the Court of Appeal.
 
All of which brings us to the
present litigation. To prosecute his malpractice actions, Plaintiff hired Parker
Mills LLP fka Parker Shumaker Mills LLP (“PM”) and David B. Parker (“Parker”).
But eventually that relationship soured as well. Plaintiff has now brought claims
against PM and Parker, alleging that they failed to competently conduct the
malpractice actions.
 
On April
29, 2019, Plaintiff filed his Third Amended Complaint (“TAC”) for (1) Breach of
Contract; (2) Legal Malpractice (I); (3) Legal Malpractice (II); (4) Breach of
Fiduciary Duty; and (5) Fraud against Defendants PM, Parker, and DOES 1-10. 
 
On May
29, 2019, Defendants PM and Parker filed their Answer.
 
On May 14, 2019, Defendants PM and
Parker filed their Cross-Complaint for (1)-(2) Breach of Contract, (3)-(4)
Account Stated, and (5) Quantum Meruit against Plaintiff and ROES 1-10. 
 
On July 12, 2019, Plaintiff Cross-Defendant
filed his Answer.
 
On November 14, 2019, this court
ordered the case stayed in its entirety.
 
On August 5, 2022, this court
lifted the stay.
 
Trial is currently set for February
5, 2024.
 
Instant Motion
 
Defendants PM and Parker now move
this court to reimpose the stay pending an appeal of the dismissal order issued
by Judge Stern in the underlying case, No. 517 799. 
 
Decision
 
            The motion
is GRANTED. The court sets a status conference for June 13, 2024, at 8:30 am.
 
The motion is unopposed. This
amounts to a concession by Plaintiff that the motion has merit. See California
Rules of Court Rule 3.1113(a); see also Rule 3.1320(f); Herzberg v. County
of Plumas (2005) 133 Cal.App.4th 1, 20.
