Decision
 
            The motion is CONTINUED to Wednesday, January 31, 2024,
at 8:30 am.
 
            Counsel are ORDERED to meet and confer in person or by
video conference and reach a stipulation regarding what materials Plaintiff
seeks that Defense would withhold based on Pitchess. That stipulation should be
filed with this court by noon on Friday, January 26, 2024.
 
Discussion
 
            Defense argues that this motion was not properly served
because it was not sent to the LAPD Pitchess Unit. While Evidence Code
§ 1043(a) requires notice to “the government agency” with custody of the
records, it does not require notice to a specific unit within any given agency.
The appropriate agency is the LAPD, which is an arm of the City. Defense
counsel represents the City and LAPD officers in this case. Notice was
sufficient.
 
            There is also an issue about the discovery cut-off in
this case. On August 9, 2023, Defendant City filed a motion to continue trial,
in part based on their need to conduct further discovery. On October 17, 2023,
this court granted that motion and set trial for April 15, 2024. The court also
granted a continuance of a motion for summary judgment for the express purpose
of allowing further discovery. Defendant City cannot now suddenly claim that
the time for discovery is over. Discovery deadlines are pegged to the current
trial date of April 15, 2024. This motion is timely.
 
            What it is not, is a Pitchess motion. The categories
of documents Plaintiff seeks read like ordinary Requests for Production. While
some of these categories may conceivably include materials covered by Pitchess,
the bulk of the responsive material would certainly not be covered. Counsel
need to discuss this between themselves. Documents over which Defense does not
assert a Pitchess objection need not go through a Pitchess
procedure. That appears to be most of these items.
 
            Rather than start the whole process over and go through
another motion, counsel should meet together and reach agreement about what
items responsive to the 33 categories in the motion would actually be withheld
based on Pitchess. The court can then focus its analysis only on those
items and make a final ruling.
 
Conclusion
 
            Service was proper and discovery is not yet closed. But
this is not yet a proper Pitchess motion. Therefore, the motion is
CONTINUED to Wednesday, January 31, 2024, at 8:30 am.
 
            Counsel are ORDERED to meet and confer in person or by
video conference and reach a stipulation regarding what materials Plaintiff
seeks that Defense would withhold based on Pitchess. That stipulation should be
filed with this court by noon on Friday, January 26, 2024.
