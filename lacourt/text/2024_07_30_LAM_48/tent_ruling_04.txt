[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFF’S MOTION
  TO COMPEL RESPONSES TO FORM INTERROGATORIES; GRANTING PLAINTIFF’S MOTION TO DEEM
  RFAs ADMITTED
 
Dept. 48

On December 5, 2023, Plaintiff
KPG Healthcare LLC filed this action against Defendant Mindful Values and others.
On
March 14, 2024, Plaintiff served Form Interrogatories, Set One and Requests for
Admission on Defendant.  After an extension
of time, the deadline for Defendant to respond was May 31, 2024, but to date, no
responses have been received.
On
June 25 and 26, 2024, Plaintiff filed motions to compel responses to the Form Interrogatories
and to deem the RFAs admitted.
Where
a party fails to serve timely responses to discovery requests, the court may make
an order compelling responses.  (Code Civ.
Proc., §§ 2030.290, 2031.300; Healthcare Consulting,
Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 403.)   A party that fails to serve timely responses
waives any objections to the request, including ones based on privilege or the protection
of attorney work product.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§§ 2030.290, subd. (a), 2031.300, subd. (a).)
When
a party fails to timely respond to a request for admission, the propounding party
may move for an order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any
matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).)  The party who failed to respond waives any objections
to the demand, unless the court grants them relief from the waiver, upon a showing
that the party (1) has subsequently served a substantially compliant response, and
(2) that the party’s failure to respond was the result of mistake, inadvertence,
or excusable neglect.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2033.280, subds. (a)(1)-(2).)  The court shall
grant a motion to deem admitted requests for admissions, “unless it finds that the
party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has served, before the
hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests for admission that is
in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)
Defendant
filed no opposition to these motions and did not serve timely responses.  It does not appear that Defendant served substantially
compliant responses prior to the hearing. 

Accordingly,
the motions are GRANTED.
Defendant
is ordered to provide verified responses, without objections, to Form Interrogatories,
Set One within 30 days.
The
Requests for Admission served on March 14, 2024 are deemed admitted.
The
request for sanctions is granted in part. 
Defendant’s counsel is ordered to pay total sanctions of $2,000.00 to Plaintiff
within 30 days.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
