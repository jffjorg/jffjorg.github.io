[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING MOTIONS TO COMPEL
  FURTHER RESPONSES
 
Dept. 48
July 30, 2024



 
Plaintiff
Clarence Harrell seeks to compel further responses to Deposition Notices and Requests
for Production of Documents (“RFPs”) from non-parties Francis Jose, Susana Castro,
and Suzanne Stone, who are employees of Defendant City of Pasadena.
Plaintiff
served a Second Amended Notice of Deposition of Francis Jose and RFPs for a November
2, 2023 deposition.  Defendant served objections
on November 2, 2023.  On January
25, 2024, Defendant served supplemental responses.
Plaintiff
served an Amended Notice of Deposition of Susana Castro and RFPs for a November
28, 2023 deposition.  Defendant served objections
on November 28, 2023.  January 25, 2024, Defendant
served supplemental responses.
Plaintiff
served an Amended Notice of Deposition of Suzanne Stone and RFPs for a December
20, 2023 deposition.  Defendant served objections
on December 20, 2023.
On
March 8, 2024, Plaintiff filed motions to compel further responses from Francis
Jose, Susana Castro, and Suzanne Stone. 
Defendant did not serve supplemental responses.
A.        Plaintiff Did Not Follow Proper
Procedures.
For
a motion to compel further, the moving party must meet and confer with the
opposing party and file a Separate Statement or follow the Court’s alternative
method of outlining the disputes.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (b); California Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(b).)  This Department requires the parties to
follow the procedures outlined in Exhibit A of Department 48’s Courtroom
Information (available on the Court’s website, www.lacourt.org) and file a
joint statement.
Plaintiff
did not attempt to comply with these requirements, as demonstrated by the
declarations and exhibits filed with the motions.
If
any party continues to disregard this Department’s procedures for filing motions
to compel further, the Court may strike the noncompliant filings or issue
sanctions.
B.        The Motions Are Granted.
Defendant’s
objections are waived because they were untimely served.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.410, subd. (a).)  Moreover, the objections are boilerplate and are
thus overruled.
The
unopposed motions to compel further responses are GRANTED.
Francis
Jose is ordered to produce the documents requested in RFP Nos. 1-11, 15, 38-41,
43, 45, 48-53, 60, 63-65, 70-71, 76-77, and 79-80 within 30 days.
Susana
Castro is ordered to produce the documents requested in RFP Nos. 22-25 within 30
days.
Suzanne
Stone is ordered to produce the documents requested in RFP Nos. 13, 14, 18, and
19 within 30 days.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
 
        
Dated this 30th day of July 2024
