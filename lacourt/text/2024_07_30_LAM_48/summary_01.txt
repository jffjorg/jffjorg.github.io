And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the plaintiff, Clarence Harrell, granting his motions to compel further responses from non-parties Francis Jose, Susana Castro, and Suzanne Stone, who are employees of the defendant, City of Pasadena. The plaintiff had served deposition notices and requests for production of documents (RFPs) to the non-parties, but the defendant failed to provide sufficient responses. The judge found that the plaintiff did not follow proper procedures in filing the motions, but granted the motions nonetheless because the defendant's objections were untimely served and were deemed waived. The judge ordered the non-parties to produce the requested documents within 30 days.
