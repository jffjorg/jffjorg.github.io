And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of WFG National Title Insurance Company v. Jonathan Grigsby, overruling Defendant's demurrer. The demurrer claimed that the Complaint did not state a cause of action, but Defendant failed to specify why the allegations were insufficient. The Judge ruled that the Complaint sufficiently alleges its causes of action and that Defendant's demurrer was waived because it did not provide authority to support its claims. The demurrer is therefore overruled, and Defendant is ordered to file an answer within 30 days.
