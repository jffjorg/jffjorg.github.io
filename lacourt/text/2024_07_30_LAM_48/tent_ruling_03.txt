  CASE NO.: 23STCV07005
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER OVERRULING DEMURRER
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
July 30, 2024



 
On March 30, 2023, Plaintiff
WFG National Title Insurance Company field this action Defendant Jonathan Grigsby,
individually and as Trustee of the John Wesley Grigsby, Jr. Revocable Living Trust
On
February 22, 2024, Defendant filed a demurrer.
A
demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the complaint states a cause of action.  (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740,
747.)  When considering demurrers, courts
read the allegations liberally and in context, accepting the alleged facts as true.  (Nolte v. Cedars-Sinai Medical Center (2015)
236 Cal.App.4th 1401, 1406.)
“A
demurrer shall distinctly specify the grounds upon which any of the objections to
the complaint, cross-complaint, or answer are taken.  Unless it does so, it may be disregarded.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.60.)
Defendant
demurs to the Complaint on the grounds that it “fails to allege facts sufficient
to maintain this action.”  (Demurrer at p.
3.)  Defendant only provides authority for
this being a proper ground for demurrer. 
Defendant does not specify why this Complaint’s allegations are insufficient.  “We need not consider an argument for which no
authority is furnished.”  (Dabney v. Dabney
(2002) 104 Cal.App.4th 379, 384.)  “[P]arties
are required to include argument and citation to authority in their briefs, and
the absence of these necessary elements allows this court to treat [an] issue as
waived.”  (Interinsurance Exchange v. Collins
(1994) 30 Cal.App.4th 1445, 1448 [37 Cal.Rptr.2d 126].)  Moreover, for the reasons stated in
Plaintiff’s Opposition, the Complaint sufficiently alleges its causes of
action.
The
demurrer is OVERRULED.  Defendant is ordered
to file an answer within 30 days.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
