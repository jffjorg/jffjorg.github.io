And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling denies the plaintiff's motion to compel further deposition testimony from Nadine Wishart and request a discovery referee. The Judge finds that the motion is timely, but the plaintiff failed to meet and confer with the defendant before filing the motion. The Judge also finds that the plaintiff has not shown conduct that is abusive enough to require the appointment of a discovery referee. The Judge notes that the defendant's counsel made speaking objections and instructed Nadine Wishart not to answer relevant questions, but the Judge finds that this conduct was not abusive. The Judge also finds that the plaintiff voluntarily ended the deposition and has refused the defendant's offer for three more hours of deposition. The Judge concludes that the motion is denied and the requests for sanctions are denied.
