            This
action arises from a breach of an Agreement for the Purchase and Sale of Future
Receipts. Plaintiff IMS Fund, LLC (Plaintiff) sued Defendant Doarian Okeel
Anthony Bennett (Defendant) asserting a cause of action for breach of contract

$67,050.00 from future receivables earned by delivering to Plaintiff weekly
thirty two percent (32%) of the proceeds of each future sale made by Defendant.

Discussion
 
            Plaintiff
seeks default judgment in the amount of $44,844.04, which includes $4,941.52 in
interest, $1,049.43 in costs, and $1,510.29 in attorney fees. 
 
            There
is no evidence in support of the default judgment. Plaintiff purports to submit
the declaration of Daniel Eaker, Manager of Plaintiff, to substantiate its default
judgment request; however, the declaration is signed, inexplicably, by Oleg
Rud. 
 
Moreover, while
this declaration addresses the request for damages, interest and attorney fees,
it does not address or substantiate the request for costs.
 
            The
request for default judgment is denied.  The
Court will set a hearing date and deadline for submission of necessary
evidence.
