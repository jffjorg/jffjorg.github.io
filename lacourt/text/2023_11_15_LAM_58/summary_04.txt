And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling is an update on a case where IMS Fund, LLC (Plaintiff) sued Doarian Okeel Anthony Bennett (Defendant) for breaching an Agreement for the Purchase and Sale of Future Receipts. The Plaintiff advanced $45,000.00 to the Defendant and was supposed to receive $67,050.00 from future receivables. The Plaintiff filed a Complaint, which was later amended, and a default was entered against the Defendant. The Plaintiff then moved for default judgment, which was initially granted but later denied. The Court found that the Plaintiff's declaration, which was supposed to substantiate the request for default judgment, was incomplete and did not address all the requested damages, interest, and costs. As a result, the Court will set a hearing date and deadline for the submission of necessary evidence.
