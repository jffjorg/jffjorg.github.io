And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the defendant's motion to quash service of summons. The plaintiff, Whitaker, served the defendant, Sun, Moon & Truth, Inc., by personal and substitute service, but the defendant challenges the service, alleging that the incorrect person was served. The plaintiff's registered process server, Kanpirom Pankum (aka "Gunn Pankum"), served the defendant on November 17, 2023, but the defendant claims that it was actually Tiffany West who was served. The Judge finds that the plaintiff has failed to prove proper service and that the burden is on the plaintiff to prove effective service. Since the plaintiff has not opposed the motion, the Judge grants the motion and quashes the service of summons.
