The child will receive a settlement amount of $800,000, while the adult plaintiffs, Rosalba Perez and Fionan "Mac Cann", will each receive $100,000. The total global settlement amount is $1,000,000. The court has approved the expenses of $106,932.43, despite noting that they are exceptionally high, as they are documented as expenses for experts, depositions, and discovery, as well as a $5,000 advance to the adult plaintiffs.
