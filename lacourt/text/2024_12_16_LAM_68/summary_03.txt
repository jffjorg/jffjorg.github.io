And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the motion for clarification of the April 27, 2009, Judgment and has denied it. The motion is improper because the Plaintiffs may not seek relief until March 28, 2025, as per the court's previous orders. The court also notes that the Plaintiffs have been deemed vexatious litigants and are subject to prefiling orders, which restrict their ability to file new actions in the superior court without obtaining pre-filing leave of court. The court cites California Code of Civil Procedure sections 391.7 and 391.8 in its ruling.
