SUMMARY
OF ACTION
Plaintiffs
Rosalba Perez and Fionan “Mac Cann: with minor child Calixta Cielo “Mc Cann”
resided in certain premises owned and/or managed by Defendants John W. Chapman,
II, Meredith M. Chapman, and Lotus Property Services, Inc. On April 6, 2022,
Plaintiffs filed a habitability complaint, including lead paint hazards for
harm caused to Calixta. Defendants answered the complaint on May 25, 2022. On
September 4, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a notice of settlement of the entire case.
 
RULING: Granted.
Plaintiff Rosalba Perez submits a petition for approval for
minors compromises on behalf of five year old Calixta Cielo “Mc Cann” for a $800,000
settlement amount entered into with Defendants John W. Chapman, II, Meredith M.
Chapman, and Lotus Property Services, Inc. Perez also represents a settlement
of $100,000 each to Perez and Fionan “Mac Cann.” (Global settlement of
$1,000,000.) [Attachment 18b(3).]
 
Petitioner presents a net payment to the minor of $453,057.57
following deduction of $240,000 in attorney fees (30%) [Attachment 17(a)] and
expenses of $106,932.43 (marked down from $138,665.54). [Declaration of Juan
Victoria, Attachment 14.] Counsel separately deducts $40,000/each in fees from
the Perez and Mac Cann settlements.
 
The expenses are exceptionally high, but documented as
expenses for experts, depositions and discovery, plus a $5,000 advance to the
adult Plaintiffs. The court assumes the necessity of the expenses reflects
challenges to causation. The court however notes a lack of address of the
adequacy of the damages recovery, though accepts long term care provisions for
the minor are reflected in the amount. The court presumes the $1,000,000 global
settlement reflects the insurance policy limit, and therefore the basis for the
agreed upon amount, though questions the necessity of said inordinate expenses
given the supposed insurance policy cap. The court approves the expenses
notwithstanding the disproportionate amount of costs relative to the recovery.
 
Although not indicated in the petition itself, the
settlement provides for the purchase of a structured settlement annuity with
MetLife Assignment Company, Inc. will provide a progressive larger series of
lump sum payments to Calixta from September 9, 2036, through September 9, 2048.
The court requires proof of the annuity purchase.
 
The court approves the petition. 
 
The court will set an OSC re: Verification of the Deposit of
Net Proceeds into the Annuity for the next 45-60 days.
 
Plaintiff to give notice.
