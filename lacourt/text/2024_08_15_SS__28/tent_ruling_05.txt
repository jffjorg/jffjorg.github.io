LEGAL STANDARD 
A.   Inspection demand 
          Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.300 provides: 
        “If a party to whom a demand for
inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is directed fails to serve a timely
response to it, the following rules shall apply: 
“(a) The party to whom the demand for inspection,
copying, testing, or sampling is directed waives any objection to the demand,
including one based on privilege or on the protection for work product under
Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve
that party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following
conditions are satisfied: 
“(1) The party has subsequently served a response that
is in substantial compliance with Sections 2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230,
2031.240, and 2031.280. 
“(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response
was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
“(b) The party making the demand may move for an order
compelling response to the demand. 
“(c) Except as provided in subdivision (d), the court
shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes a motion to compel a response to a demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction
acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the
imposition of the sanction unjust. If a party then fails to obey the order compelling
a response, the court may make those orders that are just, including the
imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in
addition to this sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). 
“(d) (1) Notwithstanding subdivision (c), absent
exceptional circumstances, the court shall not impose sanctions on a party or
any attorney of a party for failure to provide electronically stored
information that has been lost, damaged, altered, or overwritten as a result of
the routine, good faith operation of an electronic information system. 
“(2) This subdivision shall not be construed to alter
any obligation to preserve discoverable information.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300.) 
B.   Interrogatories 
          Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.290 provides:         
“If a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails
to serve a timely response, the following rules apply: 
“(a) The party to whom the interrogatories are
directed waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings under
Section 2030.230, as well as any objection to the interrogatories, including
one based on privilege or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4
(commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that
party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following
conditions are satisfied: 
“(1) The party has subsequently served a response that
is in substantial compliance with Sections 2030.210, 2030.220, 2030.230, and
2030.240. 
“(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response
was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
“(b) The party propounding the interrogatories may
move for an order compelling response to the interrogatories. 
“(c) The court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to
interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust. If a party then fails to obey an order compelling
answers, the court may make those orders that are just, including the imposition
of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in addition to that
sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing
with Section 2023.010).” 
(Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.290.) 
          C.  Requests for
admission 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2033.280 provides: 
“If a party to whom requests for admission are
directed fails to serve a timely response, the following rules apply: 
“(a) The party to whom the requests for admission are
directed waives any objection to the requests, including one based on privilege
or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section
2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that party from this waiver on its
determination that both of the following conditions are satisfied: 
“(1) The party has subsequently served a response that
is in substantial compliance with Sections 2033.210, 2033.220, and 2033.230. 
“(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response
was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
“(b) The requesting party
may move for an order that the genuineness of any
documents and the truth of any matters specified in the requests be deemed
admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). 
“(c) The court shall make this order, unless it finds
that the party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has
served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests
for admission that is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220. It is mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction
under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or
both, whose failure to serve a timely response to requests for admission
necessitated this motion.” 
(Code
Civ. Proc., § 2033.280.) 
DISCUSSION 
A.   Motion to compel responses to requests for production 
Vaismarder served requests for production, set one, on
May 13, 2024.  Plaintiff did not serve timely
responses and had not served responses by the time Vaismarder filed this motion
to compel. 
The Court grants the motion to compel
Plaintiff’s responses to request for production, set one, and orders Plaintiff to
provide verified, code-compliant responses to the requests for production without
objections and to produce the documents, electronically stored information,
and/or other things requested without objections by September 16, 2024. 
B.   Motion to compel responses to form interrogatories 
Vaismarder
served form interrogatories, set one, on May 13, 2024.  Plaintiff did not serve timely responses and
had not served responses by the time Vaismarder filed this motion to compel. 
The
Court grants the motion to compel Plaintiff’s responses to form
interrogatories, set one, and orders Plaintiff to provide verified,
code-compliant responses to the form interrogatories without objections by
September 16, 2024. 
C.   Motion to compel responses to requests for admission 
Vaismarder’s
motion asks the Court for an order compelling Plaintiff to serve responses
to requests for admission, set one, and for sanctions.  The motion does not ask the Court to deem
admitted matters specified in the requests for admission.  (See Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.280, subds. (b), (c).) 
The
Court denies the motion.  Code of Civil
Procedure section 2033.280 does not authorize the party propounding the
requests for admission to move for an order compelling responses to the
requests. 
D.   Sanctions 
Vaismarder
asks the Court to impose sanctions on Plaintiff based on Plaintiff’s failure to
respond to the requests for production and form interrogatories. Under Code of
Civil Procedure sections 2030.290 and 2031.300, sanctions are available against
parties, persons, and attorneys who unsuccessfully make or oppose a motion to
compel a response to interrogatories or a demand for inspection.  (See Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (c)
[interrogatories], 2031.300, subd. (c) [demand for inspection].)  Plaintiff did not make or oppose a motion to
compel responses to interrogatories or a demand for inspection. Therefore,
sanctions are not available under these statutes. 
Other
statutes addressing misuse of the discovery process do not, by themselves,
authorize a sanctions award for these motions. 
Code of Civil Procedure sections 2023.010 and 2023.030 are “ ‘definitional’
and monetary sanctions may not be imposed based solely on those sections.  Monetary sanctions may be imposed only if
authorized by some other provision of the Discovery Act.”  (L. Edmon & C. Karnow, Cal. Practice
Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (Rutter 2024) ¶ 8:1901, p. 8M-2; see Code
Civ. Proc., § 2023.030 [court may impose sanctions for misuse of the discovery
process “[t]o the extent authorized by the chapter governing any particular
discovery method or other provision of this title”]; City of Los Angeles v.
PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLC (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 466, 498-504, review
granted Jan. 23, 2023 with order permitting citation of opinion for its
persuasive value and to establish the existence of a conflict in authority that
would “allow trial courts to exercise discretion . . . to choose between sides
of any such conflict.”) 
California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1348(a), provides: “The court may award sanctions under
the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery,
even though no opposition to the motion was filed . . . .”  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 1348(a).)  Because rule 3.1348(a) authorizes sanctions
“under the Discovery Act,” the Court may not award sanctions under rule
3.1348(a) except as the Discovery Act authorizes.  As noted, the Discovery Act does not
authorize sanctions for Vaismarder’s unopposed motions to compel responses to
requests for production and interrogatories. 
Therefore, the Court denies Vaismarder’s request for sanctions on those motions. 
Vaismarder
also asks the Court to award sanctions based on Plaintiff’s failure to respond to
the requests for admission.  “It is
mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing
with Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to
serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)  However, the “motion” referenced in Code of
Civil Procedure section 2033.280, subdivision (c), is a motion “for an order
that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in
the requests be deemed admitted . . . .” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).) 
Vaismarder did not file such a motion. 
The
Court denies the sanctions request. 
CONCLUSION 
The Court GRANTS Defendant Dagan Vaismarder’s motion
to compel responses to requests for production, set one, and orders Plaintiff Pegah
Keshavarz to provide verified, code-compliant responses to the requests for
production without objections and to produce the documents, electronically
stored information, and/or other things requested without objections by
September 16, 2024. 
The Court GRANTS Defendant Dagan Vaismarder’s motion
