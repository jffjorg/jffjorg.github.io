On

Cross-Defendants City and Does 1-10 for apportionment of fault,
indemnification, and “Veh. Code Sec. 17001.”

On

opposition. 
The
trial is currently set for September 23, 2024. 
PARTY’S REQUEST 
The
City asks the Court to issue terminating sanctions against Alvarez. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
A.   Monetary, issue, evidentiary, and terminating
sanctions 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2023.030 provides in part: 
“To the extent authorized by the chapter governing any
particular discovery method or any other provision of this title, the court,
after notice to any affected party, person, or attorney, and after opportunity
for hearing, may impose the following sanctions against anyone engaging in
conduct that is a misuse of the discovery process: 
“(a) The court may impose a monetary sanction ordering
that one engaging in the misuse of the discovery process, or any attorney
advising that conduct, or both pay the reasonable expenses, including
attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct. The court may
also impose this sanction on one unsuccessfully asserting that another has
engaged in the misuse of the discovery process, or on any attorney who advised
that assertion, or on both. If a monetary sanction is authorized by any provision
of this title, the court shall impose that sanction unless it finds that the
one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust. 
“(b) The court may impose an
issue sanction ordering that designated facts shall be taken as established in
the action in accordance with the claim of the party adversely affected by the
misuse of the discovery process. The court may also impose an issue sanction by
an order prohibiting any party engaging in the misuse of the discovery process
from supporting or opposing designated claims or defenses. 
“(c) The
court may impose an evidence sanction by an order prohibiting any party
engaging in the misuse of the discovery process from introducing designated
matters in evidence. 
“(d) The court may impose a terminating sanction by
one of the following orders: 
“(1) An order striking out the pleadings or parts of
the pleadings of any party engaging in the misuse of the discovery process. 
“(2) An order staying further proceedings by that
party until an order for discovery is obeyed. 
“(3) An order dismissing the action, or any part of
the action, of that party. 
“(4) An order rendering a judgment by default against
that party. 
“(e) The court may impose a contempt sanction by an
order treating the misuse of the discovery process as a contempt of court. 
“(f) (1) Notwithstanding subdivision (a), or any other
section of this title, absent exceptional circumstances, the court shall not
impose sanctions on a party or any attorney of a party for failure to provide
electronically stored information that has been lost, damaged, altered, or
overwritten as the result of the routine, good faith operation of an electronic
information system. 
“(2) This subdivision shall not be construed to alter
any obligation to preserve discoverable information. 
(Code Civ.
Proc., § 2023.030.)         
B.       Sanctions
for failure to comply with Court order to respond to demand for inspection 
          Code of Civil Procedure section
2031.300, subdivision (c), provides in part: 
“If a party . . . fails to obey [an] order [under Code
of Civil Procedure section 2031.300, subdivision (b)] compelling a response [to
a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling], the court may make
those orders that are just, including the imposition of an issue sanction, an
evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in addition to this sanction, the court may
impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010).” 
(Code Civ.
Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (c).)               
C.      Sanctions
for failure to comply with Court order to respond to interrogatories 
Code of Civil
Procedure section 2030.290, subdivision (c), provides in part: 
“If a party then fails to obey an order [under Code of
Civil Procedure section 2030.290, subdivision (b)] compelling answers [to
interrogatories], the court may make those orders that are just, including the
imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in
addition to that sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010).” 
(Code Civ.
Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (c).)         

D.   Terminating sanctions for failure to comply with
discovery orders 
A
violation of a discovery order supports the imposition of terminating
sanctions. (Collison & Kaplan v. Hartunian (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th
1611, 1620.) Terminating sanctions are appropriate when a party persists in
disobeying the court's orders. (Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d
771, 795-796 (Deyo).) 
A
terminating sanction is a "drastic measure which should be employed with
caution." (Deyo, supra, 84 Cal.App.3d at p. 793.) "A
decision to order terminating sanctions should not be made lightly. But where a
violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows
that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery
rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction." (Mileikowsky v. Tenet Healthsystem (2005)
128 Cal.App.4th 262, 279-280 (Mileikowsky).)   
DISCUSSION 
On
May 7, 2024, the Court (1) granted the City’s motion to
compel responses to its request for production of documents (set one) and
ordered Alvarez to provide verified code-compliant responses without objections
and to produce the documents, electronically stored information, and/or other
things requested without objections by June 6, 2024, (2) granted the City’s
motion to compel responses to its special interrogatories (set one) and ordered
Alvarez to provide verified code-compliant responses to the special
interrogatories without objections by June 6, 2024, and (3) granted the City’s
motion to compel responses to its form interrogatories (set one) and ordered
Alvarez to provide verified code-compliant responses to the form
interrogatories without objections by June 6, 2024. 
Alvarez
has not complied with the Court’s May 7, 2024 order.  The City now
moves for terminating sanctions based on Alvarez’s failure to comply with the
May 7, 2024 order.  
The
Court denies the City’s request for terminating sanctions.  Alvarez has violated one discovery
order.  The City has not shown that less
severe sanctions would be ineffective in producing compliance with the
discovery rules. (See Mileikowsky, supra, 128 Cal.App.4th at pp.
279-280.)
Instead,
the Court orders Alvarez to comply with the Court’s May 7, 2024 order by
September 16, 2024. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court DENIES without prejudice Defendant and Cross-Defendant City of Los Angeles’s motion for
terminating sanctions. 
The
Court ORDERS Defendant and Cross-Complainant Alexis Alvarez (1) to provide
verified code-compliant responses without objections to Defendant and
Cross-Defendant City of Los Angeles’s request for production of documents (set
one) and to produce the documents, electronically stored information, and/or
other things requested without objections by September 16, 2024, (2) to provide verified code-compliant responses without
objections to Defendant and Cross-Defendant City of Los Angeles’s special
interrogatories (set one) by September 16, 2024, and (3) to provide verified
code-compliant responses without objections to Defendant and Cross-Defendant
City of Los Angeles’s form interrogatories (set one) by September 16, 2024.
