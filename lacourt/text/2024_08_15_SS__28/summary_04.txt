And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge rules that the plaintiff's motion to deem admitted matters specified in requests for admission, set one, served on the defendant, and to impose sanctions, is denied. The defendant, Gonzalo Munoz, did not serve timely responses to the requests for admission, but subsequently served unverified responses. The plaintiff's counsel agreed to accept these unverified responses and to take the motion off calendar, but ultimately refused to do so. The judge finds that the plaintiff's counsel promised to withdraw the motion in return for the defendant's unverified responses, but reneged on that promise. Therefore, the court will not grant the motion and impose sanctions.
