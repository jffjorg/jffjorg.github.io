  Case Number:  22STCV32963    Hearing Date:   October 26, 2023    Dept:  15 [TENTATIVE] ORDER RE MOTION TO DISMISS
            On
September 12, 2023, the court sustained the demurrer of Defendant State of
California to the fourth and sixth causes of action in Plaintiffs David
Rosenberg and Chaya Rosenberg’s complaint without leave to amend.  The court stained the demurrer to the fifth
cause of action for negligence with 15 days leave to amend.  On September 29, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a
first amended complaint.
            On
October 2, 2023, Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the complaint pursuant to
Code of Civil Procedure section 581, subdivision (f)(2) because Plaintiffs had
not filed a first amended complaint within 15 days.  In their opposition, Plaintiffs state they
mis-calendared the due date for the first amended complaint.  
            Under
section 581, subdivision (f)(2), the court may dismiss the complaint when the
plaintiff fails to amend it within the time allowed.  This section is discretionary, as indicated
by the use of “may.”  The court has the
discretion to accept a late-filed amended complaint without a noticed
motion.  (Harlan v. Department of
Transportation (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 868, 873.)  Plaintiffs showed they were two or three days
late filing the first amended complaint due to a calendaring error.  Defendant’s remedy – that Plaintiffs appeal
from a judgment of dismissal – is not efficient and is a waste of party and
court resources.  It is much more
efficient for the court to accept the first amended complaint, and for
Defendant to answer, demurrer, or otherwise respond to the first amended
complaint.
            The
motion to dismiss is DENIED. 
            The
moving party is to give notice.
