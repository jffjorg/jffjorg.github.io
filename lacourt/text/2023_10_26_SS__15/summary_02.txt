And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the motion to quash service of summons filed by Vanderbilt Minerals, LLC, Inc. will be continued to January 26, 2024, for jurisdictional discovery. The discovery will focus on whether the defendant's talc was in the specific products to which Jose Vega Enriquez was exposed. The plaintiff will be allowed to file a supplemental opposition and the defendant will be allowed to file a supplemental reply on regular notice. The judge has ordered the moving party to give notice. The ruling is based on the evidence presented by the parties, which shows that Vanderbilt Minerals, LLC, Inc. is not a resident of California and therefore not subject to its general jurisdiction. However, the judge has found that the plaintiff has not yet demonstrated that the defendant's talc was in the specific products used by Vega Enriquez, and therefore has not yet established the necessary jurisdiction over the defendant.
