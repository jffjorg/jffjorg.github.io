Significant Statements:
  - "This section is discretionary, as indicated by the use of 'may'."
  - "Defendant's remedy – that Plaintiffs appeal from a judgment of dismissal – is not efficient and is a waste of party and court resources."
  - "It is much more efficient for the court to accept the first amended complaint, and for Defendant to answer, demurrer, or otherwise respond to the first amended complaint."
```

And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling denies the defendant's motion to dismiss the complaint based on the plaintiff's failure to file a first amended complaint within the 15-day deadline. The defendant claims that the plaintiff's calendaring error resulted in a late filing, while the plaintiff argues that they were only 2-3 days late. The court notes that it has the discretion to accept a late-filed amended complaint and finds that accepting the first amended complaint and allowing the defendant to respond is a more efficient use of party and court resources.
