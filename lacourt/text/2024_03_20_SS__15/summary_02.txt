And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to amend its expert designation. The defendant had sought to add Gary Girard as an expert witness, but the judge found that the defendant had had ample time to identify and retain an expert on the topic before the expert designation date. The judge noted that the defendant had already designated experts on similar topics and did not explain why it needed another expert. The judge also found that the defendant had not shown that it would not have determined to call Gary Girard with reasonable diligence. As a result, the motion was denied.
