**Tentative Order**

This tentative order grants the motion to compel deposition of third-party witness Bobby Brown, filed by Bird, Inc. The defendant argues that the July 8, 2022 CMO allows it to commence its examination within five court days after the conclusion of the plaintiff's direct examination, and that the plaintiff's failure to allow a break in the deposition prevented the defendant from exercising this right.

The plaintiff argues that the five-day provision only applies to elderly and dying plaintiffs, but the court finds that this interpretation is not supported by the language of the CMO. The court also finds that the plaintiff's refusal to allow a break in the deposition was unfair and prevented the defendant from exercising its right to examine the witness.

The court orders that the defendant may subpoena the witness for a deposition and set a new date for the continuation of the deposition. If the witness cannot take time off of work, the deposition can take place in the evening or on a weekend or another non-work day for the witness.

The moving party is to give notice.
