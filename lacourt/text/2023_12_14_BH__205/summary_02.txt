And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Jason Waggoner, trustee of the Waggoner Family Trust, vs. Shelon Douglas, regarding an unlawful detainer action. The defendant, Shelon Douglas, has filed a demurrer to the complaint, arguing that the plaintiff, Jason Waggoner, cannot bring an unlawful detainer action because the property has been declared "substandard" by the Los Angeles Department of Building & Safety. However, the judge finds that the parties failed to meet and confer on the demurrer, as required by Code of Civil Procedure § 430.41. As a result, the judge has continued the hearing on the demurrer to January 31, 2024, and instructed the defendant's counsel to file a supplemental declaration that complies with the requirements of §430.41.
