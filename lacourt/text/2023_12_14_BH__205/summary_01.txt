And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the defendant, Southern California Edison (SCE), is entitled to summary adjudication of the plaintiff's sixth cause of action for inverse condemnation. The plaintiff, William Howell, alleges that SCE is liable for property damage caused by the defendant's outside contractor, Edison Power Constructors, Inc. (EPC). The damage was caused when EPC inadvertently drilled into an underground drainage culvert owned by Caltrans while replacing a utility pole. The plaintiff claims that SCE is liable because it failed to have policies or procedures in place to identify and locate underground facilities not located by DigAlert, a statutorily required service.

The defendant has satisfied its initial burden of proof by presenting facts that negate an essential element of the inverse condemnation claim. The plaintiff, however, has attempted to show that a triable issue of material fact exists by relying on a theory of inverse condemnation not found in the pleadings. The court has rejected this theory, stating that it cannot be a basis for denying the motion. As a result, the court has granted the defendant's motion for summary adjudication.
