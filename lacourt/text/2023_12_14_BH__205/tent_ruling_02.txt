 Case Number:  23SMCV04824    Hearing Date:   December 14, 2023    Dept:  205    Superior Court of California County of Los Angeles – West District  Beverly Hills Courthouse / Department 205   JASON WAGGONER, TRUSTEE OF THE WAGGONER FAMILY TRUST,   Plaintiff, v.  SHELON DOUGLAS,   Defendant.    Case No.:  23SMCV04824     Hearing Date:  December 14, 2023   ORDER RE:   DEFENDANT SHELON DOUGLAS’    DEMURRER TO UNLAWFUL DETAINER    COMPLAINT  This is an unlawful detainer action.  Plaintiff Jason Waggoner as trustee of the Waggoner Family Trust (“Landlord”) is the owner of a home located at 236 Waterview St. Playa Del Rey, CA 90293 (“Property”).  Defendant Shelon Douglas (“Tenant”) leases the Property and has failed to pay rent. This hearing is on Tenant’s demurrer to the complaint.  Tenant maintains that Landlord cannot bring an unlawful detainer action pursuant to Civ. Code §1942.4 because the Property has been declared “substandard” by the Los Angeles Department of Building & Safety.  The “Substandard Order” noted hazardous plumbing and electrical wiring, cracked retaining wall and illegal occupancy due to non-permitted garage conversion.   Code Civ. Proc. § 430.41 requires that before the filing of a demurrer the moving party shall meet and confer in person or by telephone with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve the objections to be raised in the demurrer.  (Code Civ. Proc. § 430.41(a).)  The parties are to meet and confer at least five days before the date the responsive pleading is due. (Code Civ. Proc. § 430.41(a)(2).)  Thereafter, the moving party shall file and serve a declaration detailing their meet and confer efforts. (Code Civ. Proc. § 430.41(a)(3).)  Defendant submits the Declaration of Steven Burt, which fails to show the parties met and conferred on the demurrer.  While there is reference to discussions relating to an earlier filed unlawful detainer complaint, there is no indication the parties actually discussed the grounds for the current demurrer or the prior discussions were in person or by telephone.  Accordingly, the Court will continue the hearing on the demurrer to January 31, 2024 at 9:00 a.m.  Defendant’s counsel is instructed to file a supplemental declaration that complies with the requirements of §430.41.  DATED:  December 14, 2023   ___________________________ Edward B.
