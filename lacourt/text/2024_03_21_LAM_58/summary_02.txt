Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the motion for leave to amend the pleadings, allowing the plaintiff to file a Second Amended Complaint. The plaintiff filed its original complaint against the Korean Shopping Center, Inc. on November 27, 2023, and later amended it to include INI Investment Corp. as a defendant. The plaintiff now seeks to amend the pleadings again to specifically address allegations made by INI Investment Corp. in its recent letters. The court finds that the motion should be granted, as the plaintiff has complied with the necessary requirements and has shown that the amendment is necessary and proper. The plaintiff is ordered to file the Second Amended Complaint within 7 days of the hearing.
