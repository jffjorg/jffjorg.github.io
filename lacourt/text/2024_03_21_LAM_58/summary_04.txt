And here is the English text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to strike the request for punitive damages in a employment discrimination case. The case, Harran v. DCH Torrance Imports Inc., involves allegations of sexual harassment, battery, retaliation, and wrongful termination. The defendant, DCH Torrance Imports Inc., moves to strike the request for punitive damages, arguing that the complaint does not plead the request with the required heightened particularity. The plaintiff, Ihab Harran, opposes the motion.

The judge denies the motion, finding that the allegations of sexual harassment and the response of the defendant's General Manager, Charlie Park, are sufficient to support a request for punitive damages. The judge notes that Park's role as General Manager and his failure to investigate or remediate the harassment allegations suggest that he has substantial discretionary authority over significant aspects of the corporation's business, making him a managing agent. The judge also finds that the allegations are sufficient to support a claim for punitive damages under California Civil Code section 3294.

The judge grants the defendant's request for judicial notice of Exhibit A-B. The motion to strike the complaint is denied, and the case will proceed to a hearing on March 21, 2024.
