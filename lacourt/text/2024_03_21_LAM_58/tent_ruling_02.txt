            This case arises out of a commercial
landlord-tenant dispute. 
 
Plaintiff H Mart Ktown Plaza, LLC filed its Complaint against Defendant Korean Shopping
Center, Inc. (KSC) on November 27, 2023. Upon learning that the Shopping Center
had been sold to INI Investment Corp. on September 9, 2022, Plaintiff filed its
First Amended Complaint on December 20, 2023 to add INI Investment Corp. as a
defendant. Defendant INI Investment Corp. filed its Answer to the First Amended
Complaint on February 6, 2024. 
 
On February 21,
2024, Defendant KSC filed a demurrer to the First Amended Complaint. The
demurrer is set to be heard on April 12, 2024.  
 
Plaintiff now moves
for leave to file a Second Amended Complaint. No opposition was filed. 
 
The Court will
grant the motion for leave to file a Second Amended Complaint. 
 
Legal
Standard
 
            The
court may, in furtherance of justice, allow a party to amend any pleading upon
any terms as may be proper.  (Code Civ.
Proc., §§ 473, subd. (a), 576.)  Courts
liberally grant leave to amend based on a strong policy favoring resolution of
all disputes between parties in the same case. 
(Nestle v. Santa Monica (1972)
6 Cal.3d 920, 939; Morgan v. Superior
Court (1959) 172 Cal.App.2d 527, 530.) 
Thus, requests for leave to amend generally will be granted unless the
party seeking to amend has been dilatory in bringing the proposed amendment,
and the delay will cause prejudice to the opposing party if leave to amend is
permitted.  (Hirsa v. Superior Court (1981) 118 Cal.App.3d 486, 490; see also Armenta
ex rel. City of Burbank (2006) 142 Cal.App.4th 636, 642 [“instances
justifying the court’s denial of leave to amend are rare.”].)  Absent prejudice, delay alone is insufficient
to deny leave to amend.  (Higgins v. Del Faro (1981) 123
Cal.App.3d 558, 564-565.)
A party
requesting leave to amend must state what allegations in the previous pleading
are proposed to be deleted and added, as well as specify where, by page,
paragraph, and line number, the changes are located.  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1324(a)(1)-(3).)
The moving party must also attach the proposed amended pleading with a
declaration by counsel, describing (1) the effect of the amendment; (2) why the
amendment is necessary and proper; (3) when the facts giving rise to the
amended allegations were discovered; and (4) why the request was not made
earlier.  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1324(b)(1)-(4).)  
Analysis 
            
Plaintiff
moves for leave to amend the pleadings pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section
473, subdivision (a). 
 
Plaintiff
is now seeking to amend the First Amended Complaint to specifically address the
allegations and demands made by Defendant INI Investment Corp. in its January
31, 2024 and February 13, 2024 letters. (Lee Decl., ¶¶ 4-6.) Plaintiff seeks
leave to amend the First Amended Complaint to add a cause of action for
declaratory relief against Defendant INI Investment Corp., and to plead
additional facts in support of this new claim. 
 
Further,
Plaintiff has complied with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1324 by attaching
the proposed amended pleading. (Lee Decl., ¶ 3, Ex. A.) 
 
In
the absence of any opposition demonstrating prejudice, the motion is granted. 
 
Conclusion
 
              Accordingly,
the Court grants leave for Plaintiff to file the Second Amended Complaint
attached to the Motion. Plaintiff is
ordered to file its Second Amended Complaint within 7 days of this hearing.
 
            The
Court takes off calendar the April 12, 2024 hearing on KSC’s demurrer to the
First Amended Complaint without prejudice to KSC filing a timely responsive
pleading to the Second Amended Complaint.
