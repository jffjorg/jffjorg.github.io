```

And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The court grants the plaintiff's motion to set aside the dismissal of the case and to enter judgment in the amount of $9,720.95. The parties had previously stipulated to a settlement, under which the defendant agreed to make payments of $10,281.41 over a period of three years. However, the defendant failed to make the required payments, and the plaintiff is entitled to judgment in the amount of $9,720.95, which represents the balance owed under the settlement agreement. The court retains jurisdiction to enforce the settlement agreement and will continue to monitor the defendant's compliance with its obligations.
