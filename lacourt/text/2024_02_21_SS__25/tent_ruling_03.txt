ANALYSIS
 
I.          Legal
Standard 
CCP section 664.6 provides that “[i]f
parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties
outside the presence of the court or orally before the court, for settlement of
the case, or part thereof, the court, upon motion, may enter judgment pursuant
to the terms of the settlement.  If
requested by the parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties to
enforce the settlement until performance in full of the terms of the
settlement.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6.)
“‘[V]oluntary dismissal of an action
or special proceeding terminates the court’s jurisdiction over the matter.’” (Mesa
RHF Partners, L.P. v. City of Los Angeles (2019) 33 Cal.App.5th 913, 917
[quoting In re Conservatorship of Martha P. (2004) 117 Cal.App.4th 857,
967) (alteration in original).) “‘If requested by the parties,’ however,
‘the [trial] court may retain jurisdiction over the parties to enforce [a]
settlement until performance in full of the terms of the settlement.’” (Id.
(quoting CCP section 664.6) (emphasis in original).) “‘Because of its summary
nature, strict compliance with the requirements of section 664.6 is
prerequisite to invoking the power of the court to impose a settlement
agreement.’” (Id. (quoting Sully-Miller Contracting Co. v.
Gledson/Cashman Construction, Inc. (2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 30, 37).)
“A request for the trial court to
retain jurisdiction under section 664.6 ‘must conform to the same three
requirements which the Legislature and the courts have deemed necessary for
section 664.6 enforcement of the settlement itself: the request must be made
(1) during the pendency of the case, not after the case has been dismissed in
its entirety, (2) by the parties themselves, and (3) either in a writing signed
by the parties or orally before the court.’” (Id. (quoting Wackeen v.
Malis (2002) 97 Cal.App.4th 429, 440).) “The ‘request must be express, not
implied from other language, and it must be clear and unambiguous.’” (Id.
(quoting Wackeen, supra, 97 Cal.App.4th at 440).)
II.        Discussion
 
On January 9, 2023, the Court
dismissed the action without prejudice pursuant to the parties’ stipulation
filed on January 6, 2023, 2020. The Court retained jurisdiction pursuant to CCP
§ 664.6. As the stipulation complies with Section 664.6 requirements, the Court
has retained jurisdiction to enter judgment pursuant to the parties’
stipulation in this action.
 
Based on the stipulation signed by both
parties, Defendant agreed to have Judgment entered in Plaintiff’s favor in the
sum of $16,530.36. That full obligation would have been discharged had
Defendant paid the sum of $10,281.41 in monthly payments of $75 for one year
beginning February 1, 2023, $100 for one year beginning February 1, 2024, and
then $125.00 beginning February 1, 2025 and continuing until the balance was
paid in full. (Benson Decl., ¶4, Exh. 1.) Defendant made payments in the total
sum of $600. Defendant's insurance carrier paid a total of $6,281.41 (the
Defendant's policy limits), leaving a balance due and owing in the sum of $3,400
with the last payment received on July 5, 2023. (Id. at ¶5.) A default
payment letter was sent to Defendant on October 5, 2023 advising Defendant of
the default and the balance then due in the sum of $3,400. (Id. at ¶6,
Exh. 2.) Defendant has failed to pay any money since the Notice of Default was
sent. (Id. at ¶7.) Based thereon, Plaintiff requests judgment in its favor
the sum of $16,530.36, less payments received of $6,881.41, for a total
principal of $9,648.95, plus filing costs of $72.00 for this Motion, for a
total judgment entered in the sum of $9,720.95. (Id. at ¶9.) This amount
is warranted under Paragraphs 1 and 6 of the stipulation.
 
Based on the foregoing, Defendant
has breached the agreement and failed to make the required installment
payments. Accordingly, the Motion is granted in the amount requested.
 
III.       Conclusion 
            
            For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff State Farm Mutual
Automobile Insurance Company’s Motion to Set Aside Dismissal (entered on
01/09/2023) and to Enter Judgment Pursuant to Stipulation is GRANTED.
 
Judgment is
entered in the amount of $9,720.95.
 
Moving Party
is ordered to give notice.
