MOVING PARTY: Plaintiff
 
RESPONDING PARTY: Defendant Bakemark
USA, LLC (“Defendant”)
 
            The
Court has considered the moving, opposition and reply papers.  
 
BACKGROUND
Plaintiff’s
complaint (the “Complaint”) alleges nine causes of action that arise out of an
employment relationship. 
 
On September 21,
2023, Plaintiff filed a motion to compel further responses to Special
Interrogatories (“SPROGs”), Set One, Requests for Production of Documents
(“RFPs”), Set One, and Form Interrogatories (Employment), Set One (“FROGs”)
(the “Motion”).  
 
DISCUSSION
Under California Code of Civil
Procedure (“CCP”) section 2017.010, unless otherwise limited by order of
the court in accordance with this title, any party may obtain discovery
regarding any matter, not privileged, that is relevant to the subject matter
involved in the pending action or to the determination of any motion made in
that action, if the matter either is itself admissible in evidence or appears
reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.  (CCP § 2017.010.)  For
discovery purposes, information is regarded as relevant “if it might reasonably
assist a party in evaluating the case, preparing for trial, or facilitating
settlement thereof.”  (City of Los Angeles v. Superior Court (2017)
9 Cal.App.5th 272, 288.)
 
A motion to compel further responses
to a demand for inspection or production of documents may be brought based on:
(1) incomplete statements of compliance; (2) inadequate, evasive or incomplete
claims of inability to comply; or (3) unmerited or overly generalized
objections.  (CCP § 2031.310, subd.
(c).)  A motion to compel further
production must set forth specific facts showing good cause justifying the
discovery sought by the inspection demand. 
(See CCP § 2031.310 subd. (b)(1); Calcor Space Facility, Inc.
v. Superior Court (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 216, 234-35.)  To establish good cause, a discovery
proponent must identify a disputed fact that is of consequence in the action
and explain how the discovery sought will tend in reason to prove or disprove
that fact or lead to other evidence that will tend to prove or disprove the
fact.  (Digital Music News LLC v. Superior Court (2014) 226
Cal.App.4th 216, 224.)  
 
 
Under CCP section 2030.300, on receipt
of a response to interrogatories, the propounding party may move for an order
compelling a further response if the propounding party deems that any of the
following apply: (1) an answer to a particular interrogatory is evasive or
incomplete; (2) an exercise of the option to produce documents under CCP
section 2030.230 is unwarranted or the required specification of those
documents is inadequate; or (3) an objection to an interrogatory is without
merit or too general.  (CCP § 2030.300,
subd. (a).)  If only a part of an
interrogatory is objectionable, the remainder of the interrogatory shall be
answered; and if an objection is made to an interrogatory or to a part of an
interrogatory, the specific ground for the objection shall be set forth clearly
in the response, and if an objection is based on a claim of privilege then the
particular privilege invoked shall be clearly stated.  (CCP § 2030.240, subds. (a)-(b).)  The burden is on the party responding to
discovery to justify his or her objections to such discovery.  (Coy v. Superior Court of Contra Costa
County (1962) 58 Cal.2d 210, 220-21.) 

 
Plaintiff served the discovery
requests at issue in the Motion on November 3, 2022.  (Declaration of Thomas Segal (“Segal Decl.”)
¶¶ 2-4, Exhibits 1-3.)  Defendant
provided responses on or around February 6, 2023.  (Segal Decl. ¶¶ 5-7, Exhibits 4-6.)  Defendant provided supplemental responses on
August 7, 2023.  (Segal Decl. ¶ 15,
Exhibit 12.)  
 
Defendant provides evidence that it
provided further supplemental responses to SPROG No. 5 and RFP No. 26.  (See Declaration of Phillip Di Tullio
(“Di Tullio Decl.”) ¶ 4, Exhibits A-C.) 

 
 
            Plaintiff’s
reply brief (the “Reply”) argues that Defendant’s responses to RFP No. 26 and
FROG No. 201.6 remain unsatisfactory. 
Upon review of Defendant’s responses, the Court agrees that further
supplemental responses to these requests are appropriate.  Defendant’s response to RFP No. 26 is evasive
because it limits the scope of the query to “complaints made in California
involving the discrimination claims alleged by Plaintiff in this action.”  (See Di Tullio Decl., Exhibit B.)  
 
            With
respect to FROG No. 201.6, Defendant fails to substantiate its objection that
the request for contact information of current employees impermissibly
encroaches upon the privacy rights of third parties.  (See Williams v.
Superior Court (2017) 3 Cal.5th 531, 552-55.)  The Court finds that notwithstanding
Defendant’s employees’ right to privacy, Plaintiff is entitled to discover the
information sought in FROG No. 201.6, although the Court deems it appropriate
for Defendant to redact its current employees’ addresses if they can be
contacted through counsel.   
 
            The
Court therefore GRANTS the Motion. 
Defendant is ordered to provide further supplemental responses within 20
days of the date of this order. 
 
Monetary Sanctions
Plaintiff seeks monetary sanctions in the amount of $2,000.  The Court declines to impose monetary
sanctions because the Motion does not specify whether the sanctions are sought
against Defendant, its counsel, or both. 

 
 
Moving party is ordered to give notice
of this ruling.
 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed
by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive an email
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off
calendar.
 
            Dated
this 26th day of January 2024
