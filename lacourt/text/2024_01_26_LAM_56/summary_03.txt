And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the Plaintiff's motion to compel further responses from the Defendant in a employment-related lawsuit. The Plaintiff had served discovery requests on the Defendant, who provided responses that were deemed evasive and incomplete by the Plaintiff. The Judge agrees that further supplemental responses are necessary to answer RFP No. 26 and FROG No. 201.6. The Judge also finds that the Defendant's objections to the discovery requests are without merit and that the Plaintiff is entitled to discover the information sought in FROG No. 201.6, although the Defendant may redact current employees' addresses. The Judge declines to impose monetary sanctions because the Motion does not specify who the sanctions are intended to apply to.
