PARTY: Specially Appearing Defendants Leonid Krupitski, Irina Krupitski Eduard
Reitshtein, and Pnina Reitshtein (collectively, “Moving Defendants”)
OPPOSING
PARTY: Plaintiff Carmen John Perri
 
            The Court has considered the moving and opposition
papers.  No reply papers were filed.  Any reply papers were required to have been
filed and served at least five court days before the hearing under California Code
of Civil Procedure (“CCP”) section 1005, subdivision (b).
 
BACKGROUND
            On July 26, 2023, Plaintiff filed the currently operative first amended
complaint (the “FAC”) alleging violations of the Unruh Civil Rights Act. 
 
On September 15, 2023, Moving Defendants filed a
motion to quash service of the FAC and dismiss the action (the “Motion”) on the
ground that there has not been proper service to establish jurisdiction over
them. 
 
DISCUSSION
Under CCP section 418.10, subdivision (a), a defendant may
serve and file a notice of motion to quash service of summons on the ground of
lack of jurisdiction of the court over him or her.  (CCP § 418.10, subd. (a).)  When a defendant challenges the court’s
personal jurisdiction on the ground of improper service of process, the burden
is on the plaintiff to prove the existence of jurisdiction by proving, inter
alia, the facts requisite to an effective service.  (Summers v. McClanahan (2006) 140
Cal.App.4th 403, 413.)  Compliance with
the statutory procedures for service of process is essential to establish
personal jurisdiction.  (Dill v.
Berquist Construction Co. (1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 1426, 1444.)  The
filing of a proof of service creates a rebuttable presumption that the service
was proper but only if it complies with the statutory requirements regarding
such proofs.  (Id. at 1441-42.) 
 
            The Motion argues that Plaintiff did not serve Moving
Defendants with the FAC and summons. 
Plaintiff’s opposition (the “Opposition”) notes that proofs of service
were filed on October 18, 2023.  The
proofs of service in the Court’s records indicate that Moving Defendants were
served with the FAC and summons by substitute service by a registered process
server.  The Motion is therefore DENIED.  Moving Defendants are ordered to file a
responsive pleading within 20 days of the date of this order. 
 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
