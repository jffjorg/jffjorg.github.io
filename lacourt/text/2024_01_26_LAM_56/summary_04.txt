And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling denies a motion to quash service of summons and dismiss the action filed by specially appearing defendants Leonid Krupitski, Irina Krupitski, Eduard Reitshtein, and Pnina Reitshtein. The defendants argue that there has been no proper service to establish jurisdiction over them. The Court has considered the moving and opposition papers, which show that proofs of service were filed on October 18, 2023, indicating substitute service by a registered process server. The Court finds that the service was proper and therefore denies the motion. The moving defendants are ordered to file a responsive pleading within 20 days of the date of this order.
