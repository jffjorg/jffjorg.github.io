  Case Number:  23VECV01030    Hearing Date:   July 26, 2024    Dept:  T HART v LASALLE 23VECV01030 (TENTATIVE) RULINGS ON MOTIONS FOR PROTECTIVE ORDER SET FOR  HEARING ON 7/26/2024 Please note:  The court  requested that defense counsel provide notebooks with all discovery served by  any party to any other party in advance of the hearing so that the court could  see what discovery has been served by each party, whether discovery has been  duplicated, the subject matter of the discovery, whether or not the discovery  seeks relevant, harassing, privileged, or burdensome information, and the  amount of discovery served.  These  notebooks were provided to the court and have been reviewed.  Ms. Hart was given the opportunity to obtain  a copy of these notebooks at her expense even though she already has a copy of  all of the documents.  Ms. Hart reviewed  these notebooks at court on 7/23/2024.   The court intends to file the copies of discovery served which are in  these notebooks and they will be a part of the court's record once filed. Pursuant to CCP section 2019.030, the court may limit the  number of requests, the frequency of requests, or the extent of such requests  if the discovery requests: (a) are “unreasonably cumulative or duplicative”;  (b) can be obtained from another more convenient, less burdensome or less  expensive source; or (c) the discovery requests are unduly burdensome or  expensive in light of the case, amount in controversy, and importance of the  issues. Here, plaintiff has served over 1000 RFAs and several hundred  each of RFPs and SROGS. While the total number is not controlling per se, it  does show a significant amount of discovery has already been served by Ms. Hart  in a case which has limited issues. It is plaintiff's responsibility to assure  she is not repeating the same questions or request for production or RFAs when  propounding discovery.  One of the  reasons the court requested the notebooks of propounded discovery from all  parties is so that the court can see clearly "the big picture" in the  discovery that has been served and see the nature of the discovery requests,  what they seek, and their relationship to this case. As noted below, as stated in the court's analysis and as  based also on the authority and arguments set forth in the moving papers, the  court grants a substantial number of the requests sought by the motions for  protective order and found (see below) that the discovery referenced in the  motions was (1) argumentative, (2) irrelevant, (3) seeks attorney client  privileged material, (4) duplicates previously served discovery, (5) seeks  privileged financial data, (6) seeks discovery as to the unrelated action between  the parties, and (7) which is burdensome, harassing, or oppressive to the  responding parties. The court finds that merely serving a declaration for  additional discovery is insufficient here as it has not prevented the service  of discovery which is improper.   Therefore, pursuant to CCP section 2019.030, the court orders that  plaintiff may serve an 10 additional RFAs, 10 additional SROGs, and 10  additional RFPs from plaintiff to each defendant Legacy, Sapp, Dupree, and  O'Brien (the moving parties in these seven motions).  Plaintiff should carefully consider whether  future discovery served meets the requirements for proper discovery (that is,  discovery which is not argumentative, which is relevant to this case, which  does not seek attorney client privileged material, which does not duplicate  previously served discovery, which doesn't seek privileged financial data,  which is not intended to obtain discovery applicable to the unrelated action  between the parties, which is not burdensome, harassing, or oppressive), as the  court has found were not complied with here in the discovery subject to the  motions.  Upon a showing of good cause by noticed motion, plaintiff can  seek additional discovery beyond the 10 additional RFAs, 10 additional SROGs,  and 10 additional RFPs from plaintiff to each defendant Legacy, Sapp, Dupree,  and O'Brien.  Good cause must be  established by declaration and the motion must attach the proposed discovery. __________________________________________________________________ 1.         MOTION  FOR PROTECTIVE ORDER BY LEGACY PARTNERS AS TO PLAINTIFF'S REQUEST FOR  ADMISSIONS SET 3 AND FORM INTERROGATORIES SET 4.  MOTION FILED ON 4/5/2024. Grant in Part.  The court, for good cause shown, may make any order that  justice requires to protect any party, deponent, or other natural person or  organization from unwarranted annoyance, embarrassment, or oppression, or undue  burden and expense. Here, the total number of Requests for Admission (RFAs)  served by plaintiff on this defendant is 290.   Some are argumentative.  Some seek  information that is irrelevant to plaintiff's claims.  Some duplicate the essence of others.  Some seek attorney client privileged  information. Plaintiff has served this defendant 224 Special  Interrogatories (SROGs), 290 RFAs, and 290 Requests for Production (RFPs) of  Documents,  She has served employees of  defendant 70 SROGs, 243 RFAs and 182 RFPs. It is clear from reviewing the  discovery served that there is cumulative discovery, repetitive discovery,  irrelevant discovery, privileged discovery mixed in with proper and relevant  discovery.   Having reviewed the matters, and in keeping with the  applicable law which allows the court to may make any order that justice  requires to protect any party, deponent, or other natural person or  organization from unwarranted annoyance, embarrassment, or oppression, or undue  burden and expense, and finding that justice requires the court to make a  protective order to protect responding party, from unwarranted annoyance,  embarrassment, or oppression, or undue burden and expense, the court agrees  with moving parties that there are a number of RFAs for which protection should  be granted. According to Code of Civil Procedure section 2017.020, the court  can limit the scope of discovery requests if it finds that the “burden,  expense, or intrusiveness . . . clearly outweighs the likelihood that the  information sought will lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.”  Defendant's brief accurately states the law which the court  incorporates here and which is applicable as well to Motions 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and  & 7 in this ruling.   It is well-established that a trial court has wide discretion  to control the procession of discovery in a matter. Code of Civil Procedure  §2033.080(b) authorizes the Court to issue protective orders restricting the  use of interrogatories and other discovery methods where the Court determines  that a selected method of discovery is unduly burdensome or expensive, taking  into account the needs of the case. A Court has the discretion to limit the  scope of discovery if it determines that the “burden, expense, or intrusiveness  of that discovery clearly outweighs the likelihood that the information sought  will lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.” Code of Civ. Proc.,  §2017.020(a); see also Code of Civ. Proc. §2033.080(b). With respect to  interrogatories, Code of Civil Procedure §2025.420(b) provides that “[t]he  court, for good cause shown, may make any order that justice requires to  protect any party or other natural person or organization from unwarranted  annoyance, embarrassment, or oppression, or undue burden and expense.” A  protective order may be granted on the Court’s determination that “justice so  requires.” Greyhound Corp. v. Superior Court (1961) 56 Cal.2d 355, 379-381.  Accordingly, the grant or denial of relief lies within the sound discretion of  the law and this Court and is reviewable only for abuse of discretion. Ibid.  The Court may order that answers to written discovery need not be provided, the  number of discovery requests is unwarranted, and that discovery be had in a  different manner. Code of Civil Procedure §§ 2030.090(b) and 2033.080(b). Code of Civil Procedure § 2017.010 permits discovery of any  unprivileged matter that is “relevant to the subject matter involved in the  pending action.” A court may limit inquiry into ostensibly relevant matters if  the party seeking discovery cannot show that the information sought will  provide some practical benefit to the party in preparing its case. Covell v.  Superior Ct. (1984) 159 Cal.App.3d 39, 42–43; see, e.g., Shaffer v. Superior  Ct. (1994) 33 Cal.App.4th 993, 1000–03 (limiting discovery, on relevance  grounds, of defendant law firm's profit margin in action alleging  unconscionability of attorney's fees charged). Code of Civil Procedure § 2019.030 requires the court to  limit the frequency or extent of a discovery method if the discovery is  “unreasonably cumulative or duplicative, or is obtainable from some other  source that is more convenient, less burdensome, or less expensive.” Code Civ.  Proc. § 2019.030(a)(1). Moreover, a litigant may not obtain through a second  discovery request what has been requested and lost by untimely prosecution of a  first request. Professional Career Colleges, Magna Institute, Inc. v. Superior  Court (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 490, 494. Trial courts are required to limit the scope of discovery if  it determines that the burden, expense, or intrusiveness of that discovery  clearly outweighs the likelihood that the information sought will lead to the  discovery of admissible evidence. Code Civ. Proc. §¿2017.020(a); see Calcor v.  Superior Ct. (1997) 53 Cal. App. 4th 216, 223. The court may make this  determination pursuant to a motion for protective order by a party or other  affected person. Code Civ. Proc. §¿2017.020(a); see Greyhound Corp. v. Superior  Ct. (1961) 56 Cal. 2d 355, 383–84. Additionally, Code of Civil Procedure §  2019.030 requires the court to limit the frequency or extent of a discovery  method if the discovery is “unduly burdensome or expensive, taking into account  the needs of the case, the amount in controversy, and the importance of the  issues at stake in the litigation.” Code Civ. Proc. § 2019.030(a)(2). The “primary purpose of requests for admissions is to set at  rest triable issues so that they will not have to be tried; they are aimed at  expediting trial.” American Federation of State, County & Municipal  Employees v. Metropolitan Water Dist. (2005) 126 Cal.App.4th 247, 267-266 The court finds that the discovery for which the protective  order is sought in this motion is unduly burdensome and expensive, taking into  account the needs of this particular case. The court also finds that the  “burden, expense, or intrusiveness of that discovery clearly outweighs the  likelihood that the information sought will lead to the discovery of admissible  evidence.” The court finds that the discovery is (a) “unreasonably cumulative  or duplicative”; (b) can be obtained from another more convenient, less  burdensome or less expensive source; or (c) the discovery requests are unduly  burdensome or expensive in light of the case, amount in controversy, and  importance of the issues. Finally, the court finds that the primary purpose of  the following requests are not to set at rest triable issues so that they will  not have to be tried. The court grants the protective order as to the following  RFAs and defendant is not required to answer them nor may plaintiff seek an  order compelling answers or further answers or responses including  corresponding FROG17.1: 205, 208, 209, 211, 215, 216, 218, 220, 226, 227, 228, 231,  232, 235, 236, 237, 238, 239, 241, 243, 244, 245, 246, 257, 259, 262, 263, 265,  267, 268, 270, 273, 278, 279, 282, 283. Concerning the Form Interrogatories, plaintiff may serve Form  Interrogatory (FROG) 17.1 in connection with any RFAs.  Defendant is in error when it states that  FROG 2.1, 2.9 and 2.10 are in FROG3.   They are not. The court does find that plaintiff has asked FROG 13.1 and  15.1 twice, once in FROG 1 and once in FROG2 and defendant is not required to  answer the second set, nor may plaintiff seek an order compelling further  responses to FROG2 13.1 and 15.1. At this time, it is apparent that there are many RFAs being  asked which no reasonable person would expect a defendant to answer and that  the motivation seems to be harassment as they are argumentative.  Plaintiff has deliberately asked RFAs which  are invasive of attorney client privilege.   Many are accusatory.  Many are  related to issues not a part of this case.   Some relate to another unrelated case. FROGs 13.1 and 15.1 were served  twice.  Sanctions have been waived by moving party in the reply. _________________________________________________________________ 2.         KYLE  DUPREE’S NOTICE OF MOTION AND MOTION FOR PROTECTIVE ORDER AS TO PLAINTIFF'S RFP  SET TWO, NOS. 52 - 55, 57, 59 – 65, 84, 85 - 90, 91- 94. MOTION FILED ON  4/8/2024. The requests on this motion fall into five general  categories: (1) Plaintiff’s own emails; (2) irrelevant confidential, financial  information; (3) irrelevant property issues; (4) vague requests for documents  drafted concerning conversations “about Plaintiff”; and (5) irrelevant  proprietary documents and communications. These requests are unduly burdensome  and Mr. Dupree should not have to respond to them. C.C.P. §2017.020(a). The court grants the motion for protective order that RFP Set  Two nos. 52 - 55, 57, 59 – 65, 84, 85 - 90, 91- 94 need not be answered, nor  may a motion to compel further response to these be filed or heard. No sanctions were requested by moving party. _________________________________________________________________ 3.         MOTION FOR  PROTECTIVE ORDER BY KYLE DUPREE AS TO PLAINTIFF'S SPECIAL INTERROGATORIES, SET  TWO.  MOTION FILED ON 4/8/2024. Ruling: The court grants the motion for protective  order.  Dupree is not required to answer  SROGs 75, 77-87.  If they have already  been responded to, no motion to compel may be filed or heard as a result of  those responses. The interrogatories are generally categorized by moving party  as (1) LPF Triana’s business tax certificate and dealings with the Franchise  Tax Board; and (2) hypotheticals related to triggering of the termination  provision of the property management agreement. The court agrees that these interrogatories are not  reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. C.C.P. §  2030.040(b). Second, the court agrees that the interrogatories constitute an  unwarranted annoyance and are oppressive. C.C.P. 2030.090. And third, the court  agrees the unwarranted annoyance and oppression of the interrogatories  outweighs the likelihood that they will lead to the discovery of admissible  evidence. C.C.P. 2017.020(a) Nos. 75, 77, 78: These interrogatories seek to invade LaSalle  Defendants financial privacy because they seek information about LPF Triana’s  business tax certificate and dealings with the franchise tax board. Dupree  asserts LPF Triana’s right to financial privacy as an employee of LPF Triana.  H&M Associates v. City of El Centro (1980) 109 Cal.App.3d 399, 410 (“In the  commercial world, businesses, regardless of their legal form, have zones of  privacy which may not be legitimately invaded.”) citing People v. Ramsey (1969)  272 Cal.App.2d 302, 309 and G. M. Leasing Corp. v. United States (1977) 429  U.S. 338.  No. 79: This interrogatory is an unwarranted annoyance and  oppressive because it seeks to create evidence from a separate case into this  case. It is oppressive because it is unnecessarily duplicative. If the  allegation existed in another, then that allegation alone would serve as  evidence. Here, the interrogatory asks for a confirmation of the allegation  which simply duplicates the same evidence. The interrogatory is oppressive  because it seeks cumulative evidence.  Nos. 80 – 87: These interrogatories are an unwarranted  annoyance and oppressive. They are argumentative and accuse Dupree of  misconduct. They do not seek information from Dupree’s personal view but  attempt to force him to accept Plaintiff’s conclusion – that the property  management agreement should have been terminated. They also attempt to force an  improper expert, legal opinion from a lay witness. These questions and line of  questioning would be improper at a deposition and are similarly improper as written  interrogatories. No sanctions were requested by moving party. _________________________________________________________________ 4.         NOTICE  OF MOTION AND MOTION FOR PROTECTIVE ORDER BY DEFENDANT LEGACY PARTNERS, INC. AS  TO PLAINTIFF’S FORM INTERROGATORIES - SET 4, AND REQUEST FOR MONETARY SANCTIONS  AGAINST PLAINTIFF. MOTION FILED ON 5/6/2024. The court grants this motion as FROG 15.1 was previously  asked.  The answer is identical in that  the affirmative defenses are exactly the same and there has been no change  except to add additional facts.

MOTION FILED ON 5/2/2024. These requests are not reasonably calculated to lead to the  discovery of admissible evidence because they seek evidence which falls outside  of the scope of the time period and the allegations of the Complaint. These  requests relate to leases signed by other tenants long after the Complaint was  filed. They necessarily cannot support the allegations in the Complaint.  Furthermore, they relate to the tenancies of other tenants. There are no  allegations in the Complaint related to other tenants or tenancies. Nor is  there any basis for Plaintiff recovering damages from these other tenancies.  Without any relevance to the Complaint, these requests are unwarranted, lack  probative value, and are an undue burden. C.C.P. § 2017.020. The court finds that the discovery for which the protective  order is sought is unduly burdensome and expensive, taking into account the  needs of the case. The court also finds that the “burden, expense, or  intrusiveness of that discovery clearly outweighs the likelihood that the  information sought will lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.” The  court finds that the discovery is (a)   “unreasonably cumulative or duplicative”; (b) can be obtained from  another more convenient, less burdensome or less expensive source; or (c) the  discovery requests are unduly burdensome or expensive in light of the case,  amount in controversy, and importance of the issues. Finally, the court finds  that the primary purpose of the following requests are not to set at rest  triable issues so that they will not have to be tried. The court grants the  protective order as to the following RFAs and defendant is not required to  answer them nor may plaintiff seek an order compelling answers or further  answers or responses including corresponding FROG17.1 First, these additional requests cannot be justified because  they are not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible  evidence. C.C.P. § 2030.040(b). Second, the requests constitute an unwarranted  annoyance and are oppressive. C.C.P. 2030.090. And third, the unwarranted  annoyance and oppression of the requests outweighs the likelihood that they  will lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. C.C.P. 2017.020(a) Moreover plaintiff has served 206 RFAs to Dupree 94 RFPs and  87 SROGs in a case which is generally not that complicated.  While the total number is not controlling per  se, it does should a significant amount of discovery has already been served. No sanctions were requested by moving party.
