And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to set aside the default judgment entered against it. The defendant claims that the default was void because the plaintiff failed to properly serve the defendant with the complaint and summons. The plaintiff filed a breach of contract complaint against the defendant, alleging that the defendant failed to pay rent in January 2022. The plaintiff then requested entry of default, which the court granted. However, the defendant claims that the service was improper because the plaintiff did not attempt to serve the defendant at its actual business address, but instead served the defendant's former president at his residence.

The judge found that the plaintiff's arguments raise many doubts as to the issue of proper service and that the defendant demonstrated that service was improper. Therefore, the judge granted the defendant's motion to set aside the default. The judge also denied the plaintiff's request to set an order to show cause re: sanctions, finding that the plaintiff failed to comply with its ethical and statutory obligations to warn the defendant's counsel of its intent to seek a default.

The judge notes that the defendant's counsel had emailed the plaintiff's counsel, offering to accept service, but the plaintiff's counsel did not respond to this email until after the default was entered. The judge also notes that the defendant's counsel had provided a valid means of service, namely through the California Secretary of State's website, but the plaintiff did not attempt to serve the defendant at this address.
