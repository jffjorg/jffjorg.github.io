And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in this case, which is a dispute between the California Fair Plan (CFP) and Leonard Zuniga over damages to CFP's insured property. Zuniga filed a cross-complaint against CFP, alleging causes of action for negligence and declaratory relief. CFP filed a demurrer to the cross-complaint, arguing that it does not state a cause of action. The judge has ruled in favor of CFP, sustaining the demurrer to both causes of action with leave to amend. In other words, Zuniga will have the opportunity to refile his cross-complaint with more specific allegations.
