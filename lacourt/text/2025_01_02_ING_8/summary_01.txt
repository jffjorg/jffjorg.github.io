And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of granting the defendants' motion for leave to file a first amended answer to add an affirmative defense of the statute of limitations. The judge has concluded that the motion should be granted because the general policy of liberality in amending pleadings should prevail where no substantial prejudice is shown. The judge has also noted that the late date of the motion does not preclude its granting. The defendants' proposed amended answer seeks to add a defense that some of the plaintiffs' claims may be time-barred, and the judge has determined that it is necessary to allow the defendants to amend their answer to address this issue. The judge has also noted that the interests of justice require that the plaintiffs explain the basis for any potential tolling or delayed accrual of the statute of limitations before they should be entitled to recover damages for an allegedly time-barred claim.
