Leo Ramsey, et al.MOVING PARTY: Plaintiff, Maurice StephensonRESPONDING PARTY: Defendant, Leo RamseyTRIAL DATE: February 24, 2025MOTION: (1) Motion for Sanctions for Defendant Leo Ramsey’s Failure to Comply with Discovery Order RE Maurice Stephenson’s Request for Production of Documents, Set TwoTentative Rulings: (1) DENIED, without prejudice.I. BACKGROUNDA. FactualOn November 3, 2022, Plaintiff, Maurice Stephenson (“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint against Defendants, Leo Ramsey, Federal and State Income Tax Services, LLC, and DOES 1 through 50. The Complaint alleges causes of action for: (1) Breach of Oral Contract; (2) Breach of Fiduciary Duty; (3) Breach of the Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing; (4) Intentional Misrepresentation; (5) Intentional Misrepresentation; (6) Unjust Enrichment; (7) Negligence; (8) Declaratory Relief; and (9) Unfair Business Practices in Violation of Business and Professions Code § 17200, et seq.Plaintiff notes that on August 28, 2023, he propounded the second set of Requests for Production of Documents on Defendant, Leo Ramsey (“Ramsey”). Plaintiff notes that responses were due on October 5, 2023. Plaintiff further asserts that on September 21, 2023, Defense Counsel emailed Plaintiff’s counsel to request an extension of time until October 30, 2023. Plaintiff’s counsel granted the request. The parties instead, agreed to a November 10, 2023 deadline. Nonetheless, Plaintiff contends that on November 10, 2023 and October 25, 2023, that Plaintiff’s counsel did not receive any communication from Defendant’s counsel requesting an extension to respond to Plaintiff’s Requests for Production of Documents, Set Two. After not receiving said responses, Plaintiff’s counsel contends he contacted Defense counsel via letter on December 29, 2023 to inquire about the missing responses. However, since then, Plaintiff informed this Court at the previous hearing that no communication shave been had from Defense Counsel regarding the failure to serve any responses or production to those outstanding discovery requests. As such, Plaintiff brought a motion to compel initial responses to discovery.On May 3, 2024, this court GRANTED Plaintiff’s motion to compel initial responses as well as Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions filed on February 16, 2024. This court ordered sanctions against Leo Ramsey in the sum of $2,500 payable to Edward Ho, counsel for Plaintiff by June 3, 2024. However, Plaintiff asserts that Defendant Ramsey failed to provided responses of any sort, has not produced any documents in response, and has not paid any of the $2,500 sanctions. Thus, Plaintiff has brought a motion for sanctions. Since then, the Court has granted Plaintiff’s motion to deem RFAs admitted but denied monetary sanctions given the impact of deeming RFAs to be admitted.B. ProceduralOn September 24, 2024, Plaintiff filed this motion for sanctions for Defendant, Leo Ramsey’s failure to comply with discovery order. To date, no opposition brief has been filed. On October 24, 2024, Plaintiff filed a notice of non-opposition.II. ANALYSISA. Legal StandardWhere a party willfully disobeys a discovery order, courts have discretion to impose terminating, issue, evidence, or monetary sanctions. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2023.010(d), (g), 2023.030; R.S. Creative, Inc. v. Creative Cotton, Ltd. (1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 486, 495.)Code of Civil Procedure § 2030.040 requires that “[a] request for a sanction shall, in the notice of motion, identify every person, party, and attorney against whom the sanction is sought, and specify the type of sanction sought.” Furthermore, the notice of motion shall be supported by a memorandum of points and authorities and accompanied by a declaration setting forth facts supporting the amount of any monetary sanction sought. (Code of Civ. Proc. § 2030.040.)Monetary sanctions may be imposed “ordering that one engaging in the misuse of the discovery process, or any attorney advising that conduct, or both pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney's fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct…unless [the Court] finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Code of Civ. Proc. § 2030.030(a).)Issue sanctions may be imposed “ordering that designated facts shall be taken as established in the action in accordance with the claim of the party adversely affected by the misuse of the discovery process. The court may also impose an issue sanction by an order prohibiting any party engaging in the misuse of the discovery process from supporting or opposing designated claims or defenses.” (Code of Civ. Proc. § 2030.030(b).)In more extreme cases, the Court may also impose terminating sanctions by “striking out the pleadings or parts of the pleadings,” “staying further proceedings,” “dismissing the action, or any part of the action,” or “rending a judgment by default” against the party misusing the discovery process. (Code of Civ. Proc. § 2030.030(d).) The court should look to the totality of the circumstances in determining whether terminating sanctions are appropriate. (Lang v. Hochman (2000) 77¿Cal.App.4th 1225, 1246.) Ultimate discovery sanctions are justified where there is a willful discovery order violation, a history of abuse, and evidence showing that lesssevere sanctions would not produce compliance with discovery rules. (Van Sickle v. Gilbert (2011) 196¿Cal.App.4th 1495, 1516.) “[A] penalty as severe as dismissal or default is not authorized where noncompliance with discovery is caused by an inability to comply rather than willfulness or bad faith.” (Brown v. Sup. Ct. (1986) 180 Cal.App.3d 701, 707.) “Although in extreme cases a court has the authority to order a terminating sanction as a first measure [citations], a terminating sanction should generally not be imposed until the court has attempted less severe alternatives and found them to be unsuccessful and/or the record clearly shows lesser sanctions would be ineffective.” (Lopez v. Watchtower Bible and Tract Society of New York, Inc. (2016) 246 Cal.App.4th 566, 604-605.)B. Discussioni. Terminating SanctionsPlaintiff argues that this court is authorized to impose a terminating sanction against Defendant Ramsey because he disobeyed a court order. If a party fails to comply with a court order compelling discovery responses or attendance at a deposition, the court may impose monetary, issue, evidence, or terminating sanctions. Code Civ. Proc. § 2025.450, subd. (h) (depositions); § 2030.290, subd. (c) (interrogatories); § 2031.300, subd. (c) (demands for production of documents); § 2033.290, subd. (e) (requests for admission). Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.030 provides that, “[t]o the extent authorized by the chapter governing any particular discovery method . . . , the court, after notice to any affected party, person, or attorney, and after opportunity for hearing, may impose . . . [monetary, issue, evidence, or terminating] sanctions against anyone engaging in conduct that is a misuse of the discovery process . . .” Section 2023.010 provides that “[m]isuses of the discovery process include, but are not limited to, the following: . . . (d) Failing to respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery. . . (g) Disobeying a court order to provide discovery. . .”“The trial court may order a terminating sanction for discovery abuse ‘after considering the totality of the circumstances: [the] conduct of the party to determine if the actions were willful; the detriment to the propounding party; and the number of formal and informal attempts to obtain the discovery.’” (Los Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 377, 390, quoting Lang v. Hochman (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 1225, 1246.) “Generally, ‘[a] decision to order terminating sanctions should not be made lightly. But where a violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction.’” (Los Defensores, supra, 223 Cal.App.4th at p. 390 [citation omitted].)Here, as noted in Plaintiff’s moving papers, this court ordered Defendant Ramsey to provide statutorily compliant responses to Plaintiff’s second set of Requests for Production of Documents, and to pay monetary sanctions to Plaintiff by June 2, 2024. Despite this order, Plaintiff informs this court that Defendant Ramsey has failed to do so, and is now almost five months past the due date. Plaintiff contends that Defendant Ramsey has also failed to contact Plaintiff regarding the lawsuit or the order.The court disagrees that the totality for the circumstances weigh in favor of granting a terminating sanction against Defendant Ramsey. Defendant Ramsey is currently unrepresentedand has failed to comply with one of this court’s orders, and apparently has disengaged completely form participating in the litigation. . This court is only inclined to grant terminating sanctions after a history of discovery abuse, and failure to comply with numerous court orders as it is an extreme and severe ruling. Presently, this court does not find that such extreme and severe abuses exist. Thus, terminating sanctions are DENIED without prejudice.ii. Other SanctionsDespite this court finding that the current circumstances do not warrant terminating sanctions as against Defendant Ramsey, this court would be inclined to order further evidence sanctions for Ramsey’s failure to comply with its previous discovery order, in the event Ramsay resurfaces and seeks to set aside the previous discovery order or to present evidence such as in opposition to a dispositive motion or trial, where the prior discovery order required Defendant to provide discovery as to the matters embraced in Plaintiff’s discovery requests that the Court ordered Defendant to provide.
