  Order RE:
 
plaintiff’s motion to continue trial
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                 Plaintiff Pacific Apex
Partnership, LLC        
 
RESPONDING PARTY:        Unopposed
Motion to Continue Trial
The court
considered the moving papers filed in connection with this motion.  No opposition papers were filed.
DISCUSSION
Plaintiff Pacific Apex Partnership, LLC (“Plaintiff”) moves the court
for an order continuing trial in this action, set for October 9, 2024, for at
least 90 days, on the ground that counsel for Plaintiff is moving to be
relieved as counsel. 
As a threshold matter, the court notes that, on September 6, 2023, the
court issued an order granting the motion to be relieved as counsel for defendants
CNN Logistics, LLC, Rebiga Co, and Julian Rebiga (“Defendants”), filed by Scott
C. Lee (“Defendants’ Counsel”).  The
court ordered that Defendants’ Counsel would be relieved as counsel for
Defendants “effective upon the filing of the proof of service of the signed
‘Order Granting Attorney’s Motion to be Relieved as Counsel – Civil’” on
Defendants.  (Id. at p. 2:22-24; Sep.
6, 2023 Order Granting Attorney’s Motion to be Relieved as Counsel – Civil, ¶
5, subd. (a).)  While Defendants’ Counsel
filed a proof of service of the signed Order Granting Attorney’s Motion to be
Relieved as Counsel – Civil on September 18, 2023, the proof of service states
that the order was served on Defendants at the address 2110 Artesia Boulevard,
Suite B, PO Box 451, Redondo Beach, California, 90278.  (Sep. 18, 2023 POS-040, p. 3 [Attachment to
Proof of Service – Civil (Persons Served)].) 
However, Defendants’ address of record is 1044 E. Del Amo Blvd., Carson,
California, 90746.  (Sep. 6, 2023 Order
Granting Attorney’s Motion to be Relieved as Counsel – Civil, ¶ 6.)  Moreover, while Defendants’ Counsel also filed
a proof of service showing that the Order Granting Attorney’s Motion to be
Relieved as Counsel – Civil was served on Defendants by email, the court cannot
confirm that those email addresses are current and valid.  (Sep. 18, 2023 Notice of Ruling, p. 3.) 
Thus, it appears to the court that Defendants’ Counsel has not filed a
valid proof of service of the Order Granting Attorney’s Motion to be Relieved
as Counsel – Civil on Defendants, and therefore has not been relieved as
counsel for Defendants.  (Sep. 6, 2023
Order, p. 2:22-24; Sep. 6, 2023 Order Granting Attorney’s Motion to be Relieved
as Counsel – Civil, ¶ 5, subd. (a).)  The
court will therefore require Plaintiff to serve a notice of this ruling on both   (1)
Defendants, directly, at their address of record, as set forth in the signed
“Order Granting Attorney’s Motion to be Relieved as Counsel – Civil,” filed by
the court on September 6, 2023, and (2) Defendants’ Counsel. 
The court finds that Plaintiff has not shown good cause justifying the
continuance of trial and therefore denies Plaintiff’s motion.  (Cal. Rules of Ct., rule 3.1332, subd. (c)
[“The court may grant a continuance only on an affirmative showing of good
cause requiring the continuance”].)  
The court recognizes that counsel for Plaintiff has filed a motion to
be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff, which, if granted, would require
Plaintiff to retain new counsel. 
However, Plaintiff has not submitted a declaration (1) to establish what
efforts, if any, it has made to retain new counsel, or (2) to justify its delay
in finding and retaining new counsel. 
Thus, the court finds that Plaintiff has not shown good cause to
continue the trial based on Plaintiff’s counsel’s motion to be relieved as
counsel.  (Cal. Rules of Ct., rule
3.1332, subd. (c)(4).) 
ORDER
            The court denies plaintiff Pacific
Apex Partnership, LLC’s motion to continue trial.
            The court orders plaintiff Pacific
Apex Partnership, LLC to give notice of this order (1) to defendants CNN
Logistics, LLC, Rebiga Co, and Julian Rebiga at their address of record, as set
forth in the signed “Order Granting Attorney’s Motion to be Relieved as Counsel
– Civil,” filed by the court on September 6, 2023, and (2) to attorney Scott C.
Lee.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
 
DATED:  September 17, 2024
