And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the proofs of service attached to the discovery requests and notes that there is a discrepancy. According to the proofs, the discovery requests were electronically served on plaintiffs' counsel at the email address "srand-lewis@randandrand-lewisplcs.com". However, the defendant has submitted a copy of an email showing that the discovery requests were also served on plaintiffs' counsel at the email address "eservice@randandrand-lewisplcs.com". The court will need to resolve this dispute before the upcoming court hearing.
