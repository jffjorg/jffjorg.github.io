Motion to Compel Further Responses to Discovery
The court
considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers filed in connection with
this motion. 
DISCUSSION
Defendant Rosa Y. Jou (“Defendant”) moves the court for an order (1)
compelling plaintiff Nicolitsa Pitsos (“N. Pitsos”) to serve further responses
to Defendant’s Requests for Production of Documents, numbers 1-111, (2)
compelling plaintiff Georgios Pitsos (“G. Pitsos”) to serve further responses
to Defendant’s Requests for Production of Documents, numbers 1-97, (3)
compelling N. Pitsos to serve further responses to Defendant’s Special
Interrogatories, numbers 1-47, (4) compelling G. Pitsos to serve further
responses to Defendant’s Special Interrogatories, numbers 1-45, and (5)
awarding monetary sanctions in favor of Defendant and against plaintiffs N.
Pitsos and G. Pitsos (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) in the amount of $8,385.
            First, the court finds that
Plaintiffs timely served their responses to Defendant’s discovery requests.
Defendant served Plaintiffs with the subject sets of discovery by
email on May 9, 2024.[1]  (Sargsyan Decl., Ex. 1, Request for
Production as to N. Pitsos, p. 24 [proof of service by mail and electronic
service on May 9, 2024]; Sargsyan Decl., Ex. 2, Request for Production as to G.
Pitsos, p. 22 [proof of service by mail and email on May 9, 2024]; Sargsyan
Decl., Ex. 3, Special Interrogatories as to N. Pitsos, p. 13 [proof of service
by mail and electronic service on May 9, 2024]; Sargsyan Decl., Ex. 4, Special
Interrogatories to G. Pitsos, p. 12 [proof of service by mail and electronic
service on May 9, 2024].)  Plaintiffs had
30 days from May 10, 2024, to serve responses. 
(Code Civ. Proc., §§ 12 [“The time in which any act provided by law is
to be done is computed by excluding the first day, and including the last,
unless the last day is a holiday, and then it is also excluded”], 2031.260,
subd. (a) [responding party shall serve responses “[w]ithin 30 days after
service of a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling”], 2030.260,
subd. (a) [responding party shall serve responses “[w]ithin 30 days after
service of interrogatories”].)  The court
has calculated 30 days from May 10, 2024 to be June 10, 2024.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 12.)  Because Defendant served this discovery on
Plaintiffs by email, Plaintiffs’ responses were due two court days thereafter,
i.e., on June 12, 2024.  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1010.6, subd. (a)(3)(B) [any duty to make any response “shall be
extended after service by electronic means by two court days”].)  
Thus, the court finds that Plaintiffs’ responses, served on June 12,
2024, were timely served, such that Plaintiffs have not waived their rights to
assert objections.  (Sargsyan Decl., Ex.
1, Pl. Responses to Requests for Production, p. 5 [proof of service of
responses on June 12, 2024]; Sargsyan Decl., Ex. 2, Pl. Responses to Requests
for Production, p. 5 [proof of service of responses on June 12, 2024]; Sargsyan
Decl., Ex. 3, Pl. Responses to Special Interrogatories, p. 15 [proof of service
of responses on June 12, 2024]; Sargsyan Decl., Ex. 4, Pl. Responses to Special
Interrogatories, p. 15 [proof of service of responses on June 12, 2024]; Rand-Lewis
Decl., ¶ 11 [Plaintiffs served responses on June 12, 2024].) 
Second, the court has reviewed the meet and confer correspondence and
the declaration of Gurgen Sargsyan, in which counsel detailed efforts to
schedule an informal discovery conference with Plaintiffs’ counsel, and finds
that Defendant made a reasonable and good faith attempt at an informal
resolution of each issue presented by this motion.  (Sargsyan Decl., ¶¶ 5-8; Code Civ. Proc., §§
2016.040, 2031.310, subd. (b)(2).)
The court therefore rules on the merits of Defendant’s motion.
The court grants Defendant’s motion to compel Plaintiffs’ further
responses to Defendant’s Requests for Production of Documents, numbers 1-7, 10-11,
15-17, 19, 22-23, 25-27, 32, 34, 36-67, 68 (first), 68 (second), 68 (third), 69-81,
84, 89-90, 92-93, and 96 because    (1)
the objections in the responses are without merit, and (2) Defendant has shown
good cause justifying the discovery sought by these demands.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subds. (a)(3),
(b)(1).)
The court denies Defendant’s motion to compel Plaintiffs’ further
responses to Defendant’s Requests for Production of Documents, numbers 8-9, 12-14,
18, 20-21, 24, 28-31, 33, and 35 because those demands are compound and do not (1)
specifically describe each individual item or (2) reasonably particularize each
category of item to be produced.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2031.030, subd. (c)(1).) 
The court denies Defendant’s motion to compel Plaintiffs’ further
responses to Defendant’s Requests for Production of Documents, numbers 82-83, 85-87,
94-95, and 97 because the demands are overbroad since (1) they request
information that is protected by the right of privacy, and (2) they call for
information that is neither relevant to the subject matter of the action nor
reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2017.010.)
The court denies Defendant’s motion to compel Plaintiffs’ further
responses to Defendant’s Requests for Production of Documents, number 88
because that demand calls for information that is neither relevant to the
subject matter of the action nor reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery
of admissible evidence.  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2017.010.)
The court denies Defendant’s motion to compel Plaintiffs’ further
responses to Defendant’s Requests for Production of Documents, number 91
because that demand is overbroad and calls for information that is neither
relevant to the subject matter of the action nor reasonably calculated to lead
to the discovery of admissible evidence. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2017.010.)
The court denies Defendant’s motion to compel plaintiff N. Pitsos’
further responses to Defendant’s Requests for Production of Documents, numbers 98-99,
101-102, and 104-106, because the demands are overbroad since (1) they request
information that is protected by the right of privacy, and (2) they call for
information that is neither relevant to the subject matter of the action nor
reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2017.010.)
The court grants Defendant’s motion to compel plaintiff N. Pitsos’
further responses to Defendant’s Requests for Production of Documents, numbers
103 and 108-111 because (1) the objections in the responses are without merit,
and (2) Defendant has shown good cause justifying the discovery sought by these
demands.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310,
subds. (a)(3), (b)(1).) 
The court denies Defendant’s motion to compel plaintiff N. Pitsos’
further responses to Defendant’s Requests for Production of Documents, numbers
100 and 107, because those demands call for information that is neither
relevant to the subject matter of the action nor reasonably calculated to lead
to the discovery of admissible evidence. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2017.010.)
The court grants Defendant’s motion to compel Plaintiffs’ further
responses to Defendant’s Special Interrogatories, numbers 1-3, 5-14, 16, 18-24,
26, and 28-45[2]
because the objections to those interrogatories are without merit.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (a)(1).)  The court notes that Plaintiffs have asserted
objections to these interrogatories on the ground that Defendant exceeded the limit
of 35 interrogatories.  But (1)
Plaintiffs did not file a motion for a protective order, and (2) Defendant
served a declaration pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.050 to
justify the additional discovery.  (Sargsyan
Decl., Ex. 3, Special Interrogatories to N. Pitsos, pp. 11-12; Sargsyan Decl.,
Ex. 4, Special Interrogatories to G. Pitsos, pp. 10-11.)
The court denies Defendant’s motion to compel Plaintiffs’ further
responses to Defendant’s Special Interrogatories, numbers 4, 15, 17, and 25 because
those interrogatories are compound. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.060, subd. (f) [“No specially prepared
interrogatory shall contain subparts, or a compound, conjunctive, or
disjunctive question”].)
The court denies Defendant’s motion to compel plaintiff N. Pitsos’
further responses to Defendant’s Special Interrogatories, numbers 46-47 because
those interrogatories are overbroad.
The court grants Defendant’s request for monetary sanctions.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2031.310, subd. (h),
2030.300, subd. (d).)  The court finds
that $4,875 (15 hours x $325 hourly rate) is a reasonable amount of monetary
sanctions to impose against Plaintiffs in connection with this motion.  (Sargsyan Decl., ¶ 12.)
            The court denies Plaintiffs’ request
for monetary sanctions against Defendant in the amount of $3,607.26, made in
their opposition papers.  (Code Civ.
Proc., §§ 2031.310, subd. (h), 2030.300, subd. (d).)  
ORDER
            The court grants in part defendant
Rosa Y. Jou’s motion to compel further responses to discovery as follows.
            Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 2031.310, the court orders (1) plaintiff Nicolitsa Pitsos (i) to serve
on defendant Rosa Y. Jou further written responses that comply with Code of
Civil Procedure sections 2031.210-2031.250 to defendant Rosa Y. Jou’s Requests
for Production of Documents, Set One, numbers 1-7, 10-11, 15-17, 19, 22-23,
25-27, 32, 34, 36-67, 68 (first), 68 (second), 68 (third), 69-81, 84, 89-90,
92-93, 96, 103, and 108-111, and (ii) to produce to defendant Rosa Y. Jou all
documents and things in plaintiff Nicolitsa Pitsos’s possession, custody, or
control which are responsive to those requests, within 20 days of the date of
this order, and (2) plaintiff Georgio Pitsos (i) to serve on defendant Rosa Y.
Jou further written responses that comply with Code of Civil Procedure sections
2031.210-2031.250 to defendant Rosa Y. Jou’s Requests for Production of
Documents, Set One, numbers 1-7, 10-11, 15-17, 19, 22-23, 25-27, 32, 34, 36-67,
68 (first), 68 (second), 68 (third), 69-81, 84, 89-90, 92-93, and 96, and (ii)
to produce to defendant Rosa Y. Jou all documents and things in plaintiff
Georgio Pitsos’s possession, custody, or control which are responsive to those
requests, within 20 days of the date of this order.
            Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 2030.300, the court orders plaintiffs Nicolitsa Pitsos and Georgio
Pitsos to serve further, full and complete answers to defendant Rosa Y. Jou’s
Special Interrogatories, Set One, numbers 1-3, 5-14, 16, 18-24, 26, and 28-45,
which comply with Code of Civil Procedure sections 2030.210-2030.250, within 20
days of the date of this order. 
The court orders plaintiffs Nicolitsa Pitsos and Georgio Pitsos to pay
monetary sanctions to defendant Rosa Y. Jou in the amount of $4,875 within 30
days of the date of this order.
            The court orders defendant Rosa Y.
Jou to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
