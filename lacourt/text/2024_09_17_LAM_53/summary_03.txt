And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to continue the trial, which was set for October 9, 2024. The plaintiff's counsel seeks to be relieved as counsel, but the court finds that the plaintiff has not shown good cause to continue the trial. The court also notes that the defendant's counsel has been granted relief but has not been served, and therefore the court requires the plaintiff to serve a notice of this ruling on both the defendants and the defendant's counsel. The court recognizes that the plaintiff's counsel has filed a motion to be relieved as counsel, but the plaintiff has not submitted a declaration to establish what efforts it has made to retain new counsel.
