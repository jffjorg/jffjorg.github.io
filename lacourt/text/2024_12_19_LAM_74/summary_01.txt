And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

This is a tentative ruling on a motion for summary judgment filed by Antelope Valley Healthcare District (AVHD) in a case alleging employment discrimination and retaliation. The court has reviewed the motion and the defendant's Separate Statement, which is required under California Rules of Court, rule 3.1350(d). The court finds that the defendant's Separate Statement fails to separately identify each cause of action and relevant facts, which is a requirement under the rule. As a result, the court declines to accept the burden imposed by the defendant's Separate Statement and denies the motion for summary judgment or adjudication. The court also denies summary judgment of the entire complaint, as the defendant does not advance an argument entitling it to summary judgment.
