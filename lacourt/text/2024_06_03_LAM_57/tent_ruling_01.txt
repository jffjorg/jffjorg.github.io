  Case Number:  18STCV07245    Hearing Date:   June 3, 2024    Dept:  57  Following up on the brief discussion last week of preemptory challenges, there are three parties participating at the trial in this case, but only two sides: Plaintiff Baklayan on one side,  and Uber and Hu on the other side.  Each side is entitled to eight preemptory challenges.  Uber and Hu shall share their side's eight challenges.  (CCP Section 231(c).)   Each side also is entitled to additional preemptory challenges to prospective alternate jurors up to the number of alternates.  While the local rules suggest four alternates for a trial of 20 days (which is the anticipated length of the trial), the Court is inclined to stick to the proposal of five alternates discussed last week.
