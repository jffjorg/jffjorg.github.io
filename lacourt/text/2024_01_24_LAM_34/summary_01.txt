And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling grants the Motion to be Relieved as Counsel filed by Defense Counsel Jeffrey D. Nadel. The motion was filed on December 18, 2023, and no opposition or response has been filed. The motion complies with the requirements of California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, and Defense Counsel has submitted the necessary forms and declarations. The declaration states that there has been a breakdown of trust, communication, and agreement on strategy between Defendant and Defense Counsel, and that elements of their retainer agreement have not been honored. The Judge notes that there is a risk of prejudice to Defendant by the proposed withdrawal, particularly since default has already been entered on Defendant. However, the Judge concludes that the risk of prejudice is outweighed by the fact that Defendant still has sufficient time to find new counsel and that it is not Defense Counsel's responsibility to ensure Defendant's compliance with its retainer agreement.
