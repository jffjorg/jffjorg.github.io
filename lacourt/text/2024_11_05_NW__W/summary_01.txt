And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling to continue the case. The default judgment filed by the plaintiff does not match the CIV-100 Form regarding the total amount sought, and the court is concerned about the lack of an interest calculation. The plaintiff has requested extraordinary attorney fees, but the court is inclined to grant only the fees approved by the Los Angeles Superior Court, which is $1105.50. The court also questions the high costs claimed by the plaintiff. The hearing is scheduled for November 5, 2024.
