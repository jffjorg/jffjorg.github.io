TENTATIVE
RULING: CONTINUE
 
The Default Judgment does not
match the CIV-100 Form regarding total amount sought.  Plaintiff says the difference is whether or
not the court will allow for extraordinary attorney fees (CCP §585 Decl ¶21).
However, the prejudgment interest does not match each other either.  Plaintiff also does not provide the interest
calculation. (CRC Rule 3.1800(1)(3).)  The court is inclined to grant only the fees
approved by the LASC, or $1105.50.  It is
also unclear why the costs are so high.
