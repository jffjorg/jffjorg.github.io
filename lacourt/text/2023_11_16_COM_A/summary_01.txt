And here is the summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied the defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings. The defendant argued that the revival of claims previously barred by the statute of limitations under AB 218 constitutes a gift of public funds, and that the plaintiff failed to present a claim under the Tort Claims Act. The court found that the revival of claims is a legitimate public purpose, and that the plaintiff has an enforceable claim. The court also distinguished previous cases cited by the defendant, finding that they are factually distinguishable from the present case. The court concluded that the defendant's motion was without merit and denied the motion.
