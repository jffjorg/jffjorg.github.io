And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling is an overruling of the demurrer filed by the defendant, House of Winston Funeral Service, Inc., to the complaint filed by the plaintiff, Ronnisha Potts, et al. The plaintiff alleges that the defendant negligently handled the remains of Richard Wright, Decedent, and embalmed him against his religious beliefs, causing emotional distress to the plaintiff and the decedent's estate. The defendant argued that the plaintiff lacked standing to bring the claim under the Unruh Civil Rights Act and that the complaint failed to state a claim for intentional discrimination.

The court found that the complaint meets the requirements for standing to sue under the Unruh Civil Rights Act, as the plaintiff has alleged violations of their spiritual beliefs and has suffered discriminatory conduct. The court also found that the complaint alleges intentional discrimination, as the defendant's conduct was allegedly motivated by anti-Muslim animus and/or lack of proper, equal respect for Muslim religious beliefs.

The court overruled the demurrer and ordered the defendant to file its answer within 10 days.
