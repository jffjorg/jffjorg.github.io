2019, LLC, et. al. vs. Feliciano, et. al., Case No. 20STCV40688  
Tentative Ruling
re”  Defendant’s Motion for Attorney’s
Fees and Costs 
 
Defendant Look at the Moon
Pictures, LLC (Defendant) moves for an award of attorney’s fees and costs
against Plaintiffs Tae Hoon Chung, Andrea Chung,
Ghalib Datta, and Christine Kim (collectively, Plaintiffs). The Court
awards fees and costs to Defendant against Plaintiff Tae Hoon Chung (TH Chung) in the amount of $39,254.30.
 
“Except as otherwise expressly
provided by statute, a prevailing party is entitled as a matter of right to
recover costs in any action or proceeding.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 1032, subd.
(b).) “Prevailing party” includes the party with a net monetary recovery. (Code
Civ. Proc. § 1032, subd. (a)(4).) “[A]s a general rule, attorney fees are not
recoverable as costs unless they are authorized by statute or agreement.” (People ex rel. Dept. of Corporations v.
Speedee Oil Change Systems, Inc. (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 424, 429.) “In any
action on a contract, where the contract specifically provides that attorney’s
fees and costs, which are incurred to enforce that contract, shall be awarded
either to one of the parties or to the prevailing party, then the party who is determined
to be the party prevailing on the contract, whether he or she is the party
specified in the contract or not, shall be entitled to reasonable attorney’s
fees in addition to other costs.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 1717, subd. (a).)
The
attorney bears the burden of proof as to “reasonableness” of any fee claim.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5(c)(5).) A plaintiff’s verified billing invoices are
prima facie evidence that the costs, expenses, and services listed were
necessarily incurred. (See Hadley v.
Krepel (1985) 167 Cal.App.3d 677, 682.) “In challenging attorney fees as
excessive because too many hours of work are claimed, it is the burden of the
challenging party to point to the specific items challenged, with a sufficient
argument and citations to the evidence. General arguments that fees claimed are
excessive, duplicative, or unrelated do not suffice.” (Lunada  Biomedical v. Nunez
(2014) 230 Cal.App.4th 459, 488.)
 
On June 13, 2023, the Court sustained Defendant’s demurrer to Plaintiffs’
First Amended Complaint and dismissed Defendant from this action. The FAC had alleged
two causes of action against Defendant, a cause of action for Breach of
Investment Agreement by TH Chung and a cause of action for Aiding and Abetting
Breach of Fiduciary Duty by Plaintiff Andrea Chung.
 
            Defendant
seeks to recover attorney’s fees and costs pursuant to the “Production
Investment Agreement” (the Agreement) between TH Chung and Defendant. (FAC ¶ 67,
Ex. 2.)  The Agreement provided for TH
Chung’s investment of $150,000 into the film Women is Losers, and stated in
part, “In any action between the parties to enforce the terms of this
agreement, the prevailing party shall, in addition to any other award of
damages or other remedy, be entitled to reasonable outside attorneys’ fees (and
costs) from the non-prevailing party or parties.” (FAC, Ex. 2, § 22(b).)
Plaintiffs do not dispute that Defendant is entitled to recover attorney’s fees
and costs against TH Chung pursuant to the Agreement.
 
            As an
initial matter, contrary to Plaintiffs’ argument, this motion is not untimely.
The motion was filed on August 21, 2023. The time for filing a motion for
attorney’s fees is 60 days from service of the Notice of Entry of Judgment.
(Rules of Court, rule 3.1702, subd. (b).) Here, the Notice was served on June
21, 2023, and so the 60-day deadline fell on August 20, 2023, a Sunday. Because
the last day of the deadline was a Sunday, the deadline is moved to August 21,
the Monday after. (Rules of Court, rule 1.10, subd. (a) [“The time in which any
act provided by these rules is to be performed is computed by excluding the
first day and including the last, unless the last day is a Saturday, Sunday, or
other legal holiday, and then it is also excluded.”)
 
Defendant requests an award of
$52,967.33 for fees and costs incurred up to Defendant’s dismissal, plus fees
of $10,695 for hours incurred in connection with the current motion, for a
total of $63,662.33. (Matz Decl. ¶ 16, Ex. E; Matz Reply Decl. ¶ 6.) 
 
Counsels’ hourly rates range from
$350 to $650. (Metz Decl. ¶¶ 20-26.) The
Court finds that the requested
rates are “within the range of reasonable rates charged by and
judicially awarded comparable attorneys for comparable work.” (Children’s
Hospital & Medical Center v. Bonta (2002) 97 Cal.App.4th 740, 783.) 
 
Plaintiffs contest the requested hours
billed in connection with Plaintiffs’ Motion for TRO/PI, Defendants’ Motion to
Compel Arbitration, discovery directed towards other defendants, and restoring
this action to the Court’s active docket.
 
First, Defendant seeks 50% of fees
for work related to Plaintiffs’ requests for a Temporary Restraining Order and
Preliminary Injunction against Defendant Lisette Feliciano (Feliciano). (Metz
Decl. ¶ 17; Ex. E-1.) Plaintiffs sought a TRO and PI enjoining Feliciano from
using money invested in WIL 2019 without authorization from Plaintiffs, from
soliciting financing for WIL 2019 or the film Women Is Losers, altering the
film or showing the film to any third-party, or taking any action with respect
to rights to sale or distribution of the film. Both the TRO and PI were granted
in part, and enjoined Feliciano from taking any action concerning the
encumbrance of, assignment of rights in, sale of and/or commercial distribution
of the film.
 
Defendant argues that it is
entitled to recover fees for work concerning Plaintiffs’ requests for
injunctive relief because those requests were premised upon Feliciano’s alleged
breach of the Investment Agreement with TH Chung. The Court disagrees. The
Minute Order granting the preliminary injunction shows that the Court’s
decision relied exclusively on evidence of Feliciano’s alleged breach of the
Operating Agreement between Andrea Chung and WIL 2019. (Minute Order 12/3/2020,
p. 10 [“Because Plaintiff Chung has shown a reasonable probability of
prevailing on her contract action, the court need not analyze the causes of
action for breach of fiduciary duty or breach of investment agreement.”].)
Defendant was not named in either of Plaintiffs’ proposed orders for the TRO
and PI. Though TH Chung submitted a short declaration in support of the motion
for PI, Plaintiffs’ accompanying Reply brief did not discuss TH Chung’s claim;
rather, Plaintiffs relied on evidence of Feliciano’s breach of the WIL 2019
Operating Agreement, and cited the provision for injunctive relief in the
Operating Agreement. (Metz Decl., Ex. K, Ex. J, p. 9 [242].) Accordingly, the
Court finds that work related to Plaintiffs’ PI/TRO requests did not fall under
the scope of the attorney’s fee provision in TH Chung’s Agreement. 
The Court also agrees with
Plaintiffs that hours billed for Feliciano’s Motion to Compel Arbitration are
not recoverable under the Agreement, which applies to “any action between the
parties to enforce the terms of this agreement.” (Metz Decl., Ex. K.) Feliciano
filed a Motion to Compel Arbitration on December 3, 2020, seeking arbitration
of Andrea Chung’s claims against her, and requesting a stay as to the remaining
defendants. The motion was premised upon an arbitration provision in the WIL
2019 Operating Agreement and was not directed at Defendant, and so plainly did
not seek to enforce Defendant’s Agreement with TH Chung. (See Khan v. Shim (2016) 7
Cal.App.5th 49, 60 [discussing interpretation of fee provisions applying to
actions to “enforce” agreement at issue].) 
 
Plaintiffs next challenge the
partial fees requested for hours incurred to respond to discovery directed at
Feliciano and other defendants. (Metz Decl., Ex. E-4.) The Court agrees that
Defendant may not recover attorney’s fees under the Agreement for time spent
responding to discovery that was not directed at Defendant. Accordingly, the
requested discovery fees are reduced by $1,400.
 
Plaintiffs last challenge the 50%
of fees requested for 22 hours spent to restore this action to the active
docket. (Metz Decl. ¶¶ 45-46, Ex. E-5.) Defendant explains that the other two
defendants, Cecilia Ramos, and Brooks Robertson,
were billed separately; consequently, the billing entries presented reflect
only half of the total fees to all defendants, such that the 50% attributed to
Defendant is 25% of the total amount. (Metz Decl. ¶¶ 11, 17(b).) Given this,
the Court finds that these requested fees are proper.
 
After excluding fees incurred in
connection with Plaintiffs’ TRO/PI ($19,140), the Motion to Compel Arbitration
($5,388.45), and discovery served on other defendants ($1,400), the recoverable
fees amount to $27,038.88. The Court declines to award a fee multiplier; there
is no indication that the litigation involving Defendant presented difficult or
novel questions, or that any other relevant factors warrant an enhancement. (Serrano v. Priest (1977) 20 Cal.3d 25,
49.)
 
Defendant also requests recovery
of costs in the amount of $2,319.13. (Metz
Decl. ¶ 16, Ex. E-7.) Plaintiff argues that Defendant may not recover costs
because it did not file a timely Memorandum of Costs as required under Rules of
Court, rule 3.1700. However, rule 3.1700 “is inapplicable to [a] request
for attorney fees under Civil Code 1717”; instead, “rule 3.1702 constitutes the
sole rule governing [a] request” pursuant to Section 1717. (Kaufman v.
Diskeeper Corp. (2014) 229 Cal.App.4th 1, 9.) Consequently, “a party
seeking fees incurred before judgment under Civil Code section 1717 need not
file a memorandum of costs regarding the fees, in addition to filing a fee
motion in compliance with rule 3.1702.” (Id. at 11.) Because Defendant’s
request is “for attorney's fees provided for in a contract,” pursuant to rule
3.1702, Defendant was not required to file a memorandum of costs. The requested
costs are not otherwise challenged by Plaintiff, and so are granted.
 
Finally, Defendant requests $10,695
for fees and $220.42 for costs incurred in connection with the current motion,
plus $1,300 for hours anticipated for the hearing on this motion ($12,215.42
total). (Matz Reply Decl. ¶¶ 6, 9.) The requested fees and costs are granted.
The Court awards attorney’s fees and costs to Defendant in the amount of $39,254.30.
