BACKGROUND  Plaintiffs Marina Ruiz and Jazmin Guzman (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) filed this action against defendants Fernando Cazares (“Cazares”), Fidel Calderon, Cazares Services LLC (Doe 1), Thomas Franklin Henry (Doe 2), and Orchids de Oro, Inc. (Doe 3) for damages arising from a motor vehicle incident.  On April 2, 2024, Cazares filed the instant motion for terminating sanctions to dismiss plaintiff Marina Ruiz’s (“Plaintiff Ruiz”) complaint against them for failure to abide by the Court’s January 26, 2024 Order that she serve verified responses to form interrogatories, set one, and to pay monetary sanctions in the amount of $560. Cazares also brings the motion in anticipation that Plaintiff Ruiz will likewise fail to provide verified responses to set one of special interrogatories and request for production of documents per the Court’s March 14, 2024 Order. Cazares further requests monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,185. Any opposition was due on or before April 22, 2024. Plaintiff Ruiz filed an untimely opposition on April 30, 2024. Considering the drastic consequences of terminating sanctions, although exceedingly late, the Court will consider the opposition. Plaintiff Ruiz argues verified and objection-free responses to all the outstanding discovery was served on April 30, 2024, and that the previously imposed discovery monetary sanctions have been paid in full at the time of this opposition. In reply, Cazares argues that no payments have been received to date by defense counsel. However, notably Cazares does not dispute that verified responses, without objections, had indeed been served.  II. TERMINATING SANCTIONS  Legal Standard Code of Civil Procedure § 2023.030 gives the court the discretion to impose sanctions against anyone engaging in a misuse of the discovery process.  A court may impose terminating sanctions by striking pleadings of the party engaged in misuse of discovery or entering default judgment.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030(d).)  A violation of a discovery order is sufficient for the imposition of terminating sanctions.  (Collison & Kaplan v. Hartunian (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 1611, 1620.)   A terminating sanction is a "drastic measure which should be employed with caution."  (Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 771, 793.)  "A decision to order terminating sanctions should not be made lightly. But where a violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction."  (Mileikowsky v. Tenet Healthsystem (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 262, 279-280.)  While the court has discretion to impose terminating sanctions, these sanctions "should be appropriate to the dereliction and should not exceed that which is required to protect the interests of the party entitled to but denied discovery."  (Deyo, 84 Cal.App.3d at 793.)  "[A] court is empowered to apply the ultimate sanction against a litigant who persists in the outright refusal to comply with his discovery obligations."  (Ibid.)  Discovery sanctions are not to be imposed for punishment, but instead are used to encourage fair disclosure of discovery to prevent unfairness resulting for the lack of information.  (See Midwife v. Bernal (1988) 203 Cal.App.3d 57, 64 [superseded on other grounds as stated in Kohan v. Cohan (1991) 229 Cal.App.3d 967, 971].)  Discussion & Conclusion The Court had granted Cazares’ motion to compel discovery responses to form interrogatories set one, and ordered Plaintiff Ruiz to serve verified responses, without objections, within fifteen days of that Order. (Min. Order, Jan. 26, 2024.) The Court also ordered Plaintiff Ruiz and/or her counsel to pay sanctions in the amount of $560. (Ibid.) On March 14, 2024, the Court granted Cazares’ motions to compel responses to special interrogatories, set one, and request for production of documents, set one. Plaintiff Ruiz was ordered to serve verified responses to these set of discovery within twenty days, and to pay sanctions in the amount of $620. (Min. Order, March 14, 2024.)  The Court notes that neither Plaintiff Ruiz nor her counsel of record has opposed any of Cazares’ prior motions against her. Plaintiff Ruiz failed to comply with the Court’s orders until on the eve of terminating sanctions by filing a late opposition. Nonetheless, the purpose of discovery sanctions is not for punishment, but instead are used to encourage fair disclosure of discovery to prevent unfairness resulting for the lack of information. (See Midwife v. Bernal (1988) 203 Cal.App.3d 57, 64 [superseded on other grounds as stated in Kohan v. Cohan (1991) 229 Cal.App.3d 967, 971].) Cazares, in his reply, does not dispute that the discovery has now been served. To impose terminating sanctions now does not serve a remedial purpose, and would be disproportionate to Plaintiff’s misconduct. (Williams v. Russ (2008) 167 Cal. App. 4th 1215, 1223.) Further, in terms of Cazares’ contention that Plaintiff has not actually paid the past owed monetary sanctions, terminating sanctions on the grounds of failure to pay is not the appropriate remedy. (See Newland v. Superior Court (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 608, 615 [holding, “a terminating sanction issued solely because of a failure to pay a monetary discovery sanction is never justified.”].)   III. CONCLUSION Accordingly, Cazares’ motion for terminating sanctions is DENIED. However, the Court GRANTS Defendant’s request for additional monetary sanctions, but not for the unjustified requested amount of $1,185.   Sanctions are imposed against Plaintiff Ruiz and her counsel, jointly and severally. Plaintiff Ruiz and/or her counsel are ordered to pay sanctions to Cazares, by and through counsel of record, in the total amount of $500, within twenty (20) days.  Moving party is ordered to give notice.  PLEASE TAKE NOTICE: Parties are encouraged to meet and confer after reading this tentative ruling to see if they can reach an agreement. If a party intends to submit on this tentative ruling,¿the party must send an email to the court at¿sscdept31@lacourt.org¿with the Subject line “SUBMIT” followed by the case number.¿ The body of the email must include the hearing date and time, counsel’s contact information, and the identity of the party submitting.¿¿ Unless¿all¿parties submit by email to this tentative ruling, the parties should arrange to appear remotely (encouraged) or in person for oral argument.¿ You should assume that others may appear at the hearing to argue.¿¿ If the parties neither submit nor appear at hearing, the Court may take the motion off calendar or adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the Court.¿ After the Court has issued a tentative ruling, the Court may prohibit the withdrawal of the subject motion without leave.¿  Dated this 2nd day of May 2024      Hon.
