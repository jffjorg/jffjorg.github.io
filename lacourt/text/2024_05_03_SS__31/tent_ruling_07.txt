 Case Number:  22STCV23872    Hearing Date:   May 3, 2024    Dept:  31 DEPT:   31 OSC DATE:  5/3/2024 CASE NAME/NUMBER:  22STCV23872 BREANA JENKINS vs POSH MANAGEMENT, INC. dba PARADISE LA UNCUT, et al. REQUEST FOR COURT JUDGMENT AGAINST [DEFAULTING PARTY]:  POSH MANAGEMENT, INC. dba PARADISE LA UNCUT RECOMMENDATION:  GRANT in the following amounts: Principal damages: $20,988.00 Costs: $863.32 TOTAL: $21,851.32   TENTATIVE  Plaintiff Breana Jenkins (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Posh Management, Inc. dba Paradise LA Uncut (“Defendant”) and Does 1 through 20 for damages arising from a slip and fall on liquid while Plaintiff was a customer on Defendant’s premises. Plaintiff alleges Defendant knew a dangerous condition existed on the premises and failed to correct the condition or warn of its existence. Plaintiff has properly dismissed all unnamed Doe defendants.  Plaintiff seeks $10,558 in special damages, $20,000 in general damages, and $863.52 in costs against Defendant in default judgment.   SPECIAL DAMAGES  Plaintiff declares that she incurred medical expenses of $10,558 for treatment arising from the incident. Here, the Statement of Damages served upon Defendant provides that Plaintiff seeks $5,988 in medical expenses, and acts as the cap for that particular damage sought. Section 425.11 requires special and general damages to be specified, including stating the amount sought to be recovered. (Plotitsa v. Superior Ct. (1983) 140 Cal. App. 3d 755, 761.)  The amount sought cannot exceed the amount pled in the operative complaint/cross-complaint or set forth in the statement of damages. (Code Civ. Proc., § 580(a); Airs Aromatics, LLC v. CBL Data Recovery Technologies, Inc. (2018) 23 Cal.App.5th 1013, 1018.) Consequently, even though Plaintiff has submitted medical bills evincing $10,558 in medical specials, Plaintiff is necessarily limited by the amount pled in the Statement of Damages for that particular expense on default. The Court therefore grants Plaintiff her medical specials in the amount of $5,988 only.    GENERAL DAMAGES   Plaintiff declares after slipping and falling, she was diagnosed with left shoulder muscle strain, left thigh contusion, left knee sprain, and lumbar muscle strain. Plaintiff received physical therapy and chiropractic treatment. Currently, Plaintiff is following a home exercise plan, and feels her pain slowly becoming less. Although Plaintiff has demonstrated she is entitled to general damages for pain and suffering, the evidence submitted is not sufficient to merit a $20,000 award. The amount has therefore reduced to $15,000.  COSTS  Plaintiff seeks $863.32 in costs for clerk’s filing fees, process server’s fees, and fees to retrieve her medical records. The amount requested is granted.    CONCLUSION  Therefore, the application for default judgment filed on April 30, 2024 is GRANTED in the principal amount of $20,988, and $863.32 in costs, against Posh Management, Inc. dba Paradise LA Uncut.  Plaintiff is ordered to give notice.
