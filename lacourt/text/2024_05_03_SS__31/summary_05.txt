```

And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling denies the motion to compel deposition without prejudice, as the plaintiff failed to submit a meet and confer declaration to inquire about the nonappearances of the defendants. The defendants, all representing themselves pro per, failed to appear for their scheduled depositions. The plaintiff's counsel unilaterally set the deposition dates, which is deemed improper. The court finds that the plaintiff failed to comply with the procedural requirements of CCP § 2025.450(b)(2). The plaintiff is ordered to re-file the motion with the required meet and confer declaration.
