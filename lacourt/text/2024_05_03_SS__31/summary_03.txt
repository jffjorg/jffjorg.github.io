**Tentative Ruling**

The Court has reviewed the Plaintiffs' request for court judgment against the Defendant, Ovita Alexis Hines, for damages arising from a motor vehicle collision. The Court finds that the Plaintiffs' declarations are defective and do not meet the requirements of California law. Specifically, the declarations do not include a penalty of perjury clause, which is required by statute. Additionally, the Plaintiffs have failed to authenticate their own medical records and bills, which are necessary to support their claims for damages. The Court has also noted that the Plaintiffs' proof of service of the summons and complaint is incomplete, as they have only submitted a copy of the Statement of Damages related to Sims, but not Sanaee. The Court has therefore denied the Plaintiffs' request for court judgment. The Plaintiffs are ordered to submit a new default judgment package correcting these defects by a certain date, or risk facing sanctions, including monetary sanctions and/or dismissal.
