And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has granted the defendants' motions to compel discovery responses. The plaintiff, Pedro Melgar-Cruz, failed to respond to discovery requests, which were properly served on October 25, 2023. The plaintiff's counsel contests the propriety of service, citing that only one member of the firm was carbon copied on the email, but the court finds that service was accomplished. The plaintiff's counsel's inability to contact the plaintiff is not an excuse for failing to provide timely responses. The court orders the plaintiff to serve verified responses to the defendants' discovery requests without objections within 20 days. Additionally, the court imposes sanctions on the plaintiff in the amount of $652, which includes $532 in attorney's fees and $120 in costs.
