And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling by Judge Michelle C. Kim addresses a motion for terminating sanctions filed by defendant Fernando Cazares against plaintiff Marina Ruiz. The motion seeks to terminate plaintiff's complaint for failure to comply with court orders, including failure to serve verified responses to discovery requests and failure to pay monetary sanctions. The court grants defendant's request for additional monetary sanctions, but denies the motion for terminating sanctions. The court finds that while plaintiff's misconduct is significant, terminating sanctions would be disproportionate and would not serve a remedial purpose. Instead, the court imposes sanctions on plaintiff and her counsel, jointly and severally, in the amount of $500.
