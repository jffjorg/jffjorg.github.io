And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is continuing the motion to deem defendant's requests for admission admitted due to plaintiff's failure to provide responses. The motion will be continued to a future date, and the moving party (defendant) is ordered to take the motion off-calendar if the issue is rendered moot. The judge encourages the parties to meet and confer to reach an agreement. If a party intends to submit on the tentative ruling, they must send an email to the court with specific information. If no party submits or appears at the hearing, the court may take the motion off calendar or adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the court.
