BACKGROUND
 
On March 8, 2024, Clearcover Insurance
filed a petition to open a Superior Court file for the purpose of establishing jurisdiction
over uninsured/underinsured motorist arbitration matter. 
 
[Tentative] Ruling
 
Plaintiff
Clearcover Insurance’s Motion to Deem the Truth of the Matters Specified in
Requests for Admission, Set One Admitted and Conclusively Established is
GRANTED. 
 
 
DISCUSSION
 
Plaintiff Clearcover Insurance move
this court for an order deeming the truth of all matters specified in Request
for Admission, Set One served on Mari Marashlyan on the grounds Defendant has
failed, without justification, to respond to the discovery requests. 
 
Where there has been no timely response to a request for admission
under Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.010, the propounding party may move
for an order that the truth of any matters specified in the requests and the
genuineness of any documents be deemed admitted, as well as a monetary
sanction. (CCP §2033.280(b).) The party who failed to respond waives any
objections to the demand, unless the court grants that party relief from the
waiver, upon a showing that the party (1) has subsequently served a substantially
compliant response, and (2) that the party’s failure to respond was the result
of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. (CCP §2033.280(a)(1)-(2).) The
court shall grant the motion “unless it finds that the party to whom the
requests for admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the
motion, a proposed response … in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220.”
(CCP §2033.280(c); St. Mary v. Sup. Ct. (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 762,
777-78.)
 
On December 8, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel propounded on Defendant
Marashlyan Plaintiff’s Request for Admissions, Set One. (Hernandez Decl. ¶2,
Exh. A.) On January 18, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel sent a meet and confer letter
advising Defendant of the overdue discovery requests. (Hernandez Decl. ¶5, Exh.
B.) As of this date, Defendant has not responded to the discovery demand.
(Hernandez Decl. ¶3.) 
 
The court finds Defendant Marashlyan has
failed to timely respond to Plaintiff’s properly served discovery request. The
court therefore GRANTS Plaintiff’s Motion
to Deem the Truth of the Matters Specified in Requests for Admission, Set One
Admitted and Conclusively Established.
