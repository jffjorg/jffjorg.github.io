Here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The court grants Plaintiff Clearcover Insurance's motion to deem the truth of the matters specified in Requests for Admission, Set One, admitted and conclusively established. The court finds that Defendant Mari Marashlyan has failed to timely respond to Plaintiff's properly served discovery requests, and therefore grants the motion. The court's decision is based on the Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.280, which allows the propounding party to move for an order deeming the truth of any matters specified in the requests and the genuineness of any documents when there has been no timely response to a request for admission.
