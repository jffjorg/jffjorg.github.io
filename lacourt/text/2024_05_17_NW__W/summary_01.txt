And here is a summary in English text:

This tentative ruling addresses two motions filed by the plaintiff, Ivana Medina, in a case involving a motor vehicle collision. The plaintiff seeks to compel the defendant, Francis Mendoza Pacia, to respond to requests for production of documents and form interrogatories. The defendant has objected to these requests, claiming they are vague or seek privileged information. The court finds that the defendant's objections are meritless and grants the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to both the request for production of documents and the form interrogatories. The court also denies the plaintiff's request for sanctions against the defendant.
