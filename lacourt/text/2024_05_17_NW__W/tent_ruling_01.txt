I.                   
PLAINTIFF’S MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER
RESPONSES TO REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS FROM DEFENDANT FRANCIS MENDOZA
PACIA, SET ONE 
 
Plaintiff seeks an order from the court ordering Defendant Francis
Mendoza Pacia respond to Request for Production, Set One, Nos. 1, 6, 7, 8, 9,
10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33,
34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, and 47, without objection,
within thirty (30) days of the notice of this Order. Plaintiff further requests
Defendant and/or his attorney of record be ordered to pay monetary sanctions to
Plaintiff in the amount of $5,260.00 by no later than thirty (30) days from
the notice of this Order. 
 
 
A motion to compel further responses to
a demand for inspection or production of documents may be brought based on: (1)
incomplete statements of compliance; (2) inadequate, evasive or incomplete
claims of inability to comply; or (3) unmerited or overly generalized
objections. (CCP § 2031.310(c).) “A motion under subdivision (a) [of CCP §
2031.310] shall comply with both of the following: (1) The motion shall set
forth specific facts showing good cause justifying the discovery sought by the
demand. (2) The motion shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration
under Section 2016.040.”¿(CCP § 2031.310(b).) In addition, a separate statement
is required.¿(CRC 3.1345(a)(3).)
 
Plaintiff argues Defendant replied with
boilerplate objections and did not provide a code compliant privilege log.
Plaintiff is clearly entitled to responses which are relevant to Plaintiff’s
ability to prove that Defendant was negligent and breached its duty of care to Plaintiff.
The Request for Production specifically seek information relating to the facts surrounding
the incident, witnesses at the time of the accident, its insurance information,
reports and photographs relating to the incident, video evidence, etc., all of
which is relevant and discoverable. 
 
In opposition, Defendants argue Plaintiff has outrightly refused
to meet and confer with Defendants and the motions to compel are clearly an
attempt to harass and burden Defendants. Moreover, Defendants have provided
substantive responses to all of Plaintiff’s discovery requests. There is no
necessary discovery that has been withheld from Plaintiff, and Plaintiff has
failed to identify any such necessary discovery. 
 
Plaintiff has provided a declaration of their meet and confer
efforts along with the correspondence between counsel. While the two dispute
whether this was sufficient, the correspondence makes clear that the parties
have reached an impasse as to this issue, the court will address the motion on
its merits.  (See Volkswagenwerk
Aktiengesellschaft v. Superior Court (1981) 122 Cal.App.3d 326, 332.)   
 
The court GRANTS the motion as to RFP
Nos. 1, 14, 28, 29, 30, 31, 35, 36, 38, 40, 42 (Defendant may redact private
information of third parties and content of messages), 43, 45, and 47.  The court finds the objections proper as to
RFP Nos. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 32, 33,
34, 37, 39, 40, 41, 44, and 46. 
 
Accordingly, Motion to Compel Further Responses to Request for
Production of Documents from Defendant
Francis Mendoza Pacia, Set One is
GRANTED, in part. 
 
Sanctions
 
Plaintiffs request monetary sanctions in the amount of $5,260.00
for Defendant’s refusal to provide the requested, relevant, and discoverable
information despite Plaintiff’s attempts to meet and confer regarding this
issue. Counsel’s hourly rate is $650.00. Counsel also seeks the $60 filing fee.

 
In opposition, Defendants also seek monetary sanctions from
Plaintiff in the amount of $923. 
 
The court DENIES Plaintiff’s request for sanctions. The court
finds the parties acted with substantial justification. 
 
II.                 
PLAINTIFF’S MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES TO FORM
INTERROGATORIES FROM DEFENDANT FRANCIS MENDOZA PACIA, SET ONE 
 
Plaintiff seeks an order from the court ordering Defendant Francis
Mendoza Pacia respond to Form Interrogatories, Set One Nos. 1.1, 2.6, 7.1, 7.2,
7.3, 15.1,16.1, 16.6, 16.7, 16.8, 16.9, 16.10, without objection, within thirty
(30) days of the notice of this Order. Plaintiff further requests Defendant
and/or his attorney of record be ordered to pay monetary sanctions to Plaintiff
in the amount of $5,260.00 by no later than thirty (30) days from
the notice of this Order. 
 
A motion to compel further responses to form or specially prepared
interrogatories may be brought if the responses contain: (1) answers that are
evasive or incomplete; (2) an unwarranted or insufficiently specific exercise
of an option to produce documents in lieu of a substantive response; or (3)
unmerited or overly generalized objections. (CCP § 2030.300(a).)   
 
Plaintiff argues Defendant replied with boilerplate objections and
did not provide a code compliant privilege log. Plaintiff is clearly entitled
to responses which are relevant to Plaintiff’s ability to prove that Defendant
was negligent and breached its duty of care to Plaintiff. 
 
In opposition, Defendants argue Plaintiff has outrightly refused
to meet and confer with Defendants and the motions to compel are clearly an
attempt to harass and burden Defendants. Moreover, Defendants have provided
substantive responses to all of Plaintiff’s discovery requests. There is no
necessary discovery that has been withheld from Plaintiff, and Plaintiff has
failed to identify any such necessary discovery. 
 
Plaintiff has provided a declaration of their meet and confer
efforts along with the correspondence between counsel. While the two dispute
whether this was sufficient, the correspondence makes clear that the parties
have reached an impasse as to this issue, the court will address the motion on
its merits.  (See Volkswagenwerk
Aktiengesellschaft v. Superior Court (1981) 122 Cal.App.3d 326, 332.)   
 
Accordingly, the court finds the responses to Form
Interrogatories, Set One Nos. 1.1, 2.6, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 15.1,16.1, 16.6, 16.7,
16.8, 16.9, 16.10 are not code compliant. Defendants make meritless objections.
For example, Defendants object to FROG No. 2.6, asking for employer
information. However, Defendants object on the grounds it is vague, seeks
irrelevant information, seeks privileged, information etc. Moreover, Defendants
do not provide complete responses. For example, Defendants respond to FROG 1.1
‘responding party’. Defendants must provide the name and information of the
individual who actually prepared the responses. Defendants must provide code
compliant responses and if Defendants do object on the grounds of privilege,
Defendants must provide a privilege log. 
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Further Responses to
Form Interrogatories from Defendant Francis Mendoza Pacia, Set One is GRANTED. 
 
Sanctions
 
Plaintiffs request monetary sanctions in the amount of $5,260.00
for Defendant’s refusal to provide the requested, relevant, and discoverable
information despite Plaintiff’s attempts to meet and confer regarding this
issue. Counsel’s hourly rate is $650.00. Counsel also seeks the $60 filing fee.

 
In opposition, Defendants also seek monetary sanctions from
Plaintiff in the amount of $923. 
 
The court GRANTS Plaintiffs’ request for monetary sanctions in the
reduced amount of $2,010.00. The court denies Defendants’ request for monetary
sanctions.
