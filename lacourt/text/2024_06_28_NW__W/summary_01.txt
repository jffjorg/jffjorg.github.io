And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer and motion to strike filed by the defendants. The court has overruled the demurrer to the first, fourth, and fifth causes of action, finding that Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged breach of fiduciary duty, violation of Business and Professions Code ยง17200, and breach of contract.

The court has denied the motion to strike the prayer for attorney fees, finding that Plaintiff has sufficiently alleged the basis for recovery of attorney fees.

The court has struck paragraph 71 of the complaint, which seeks punitive damages, as punitive damages are not allowed under Section 17200.

The court has also struck the phrase "in an amount to be proven at the time of trial, but" from paragraph 69, finding that while a Plaintiff cannot recover compensatory damages in a UCL claim, Plaintiff may allege the harm incurred by Defendants' acts.

The court has scheduled the matter for hearing on June 28, 2024.
