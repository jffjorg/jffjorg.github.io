And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is in response to a Motion to Compel Discovery filed by the Defendant, City of Los Angeles, in a trip and fall personal injury case against Plaintiff Tatiana Bahadori. The Defendant seeks to compel the Plaintiff to produce text messages related to the incident, which the Plaintiff claims she does not have because she has changed phones multiple times since the accident. The Judge finds that the Plaintiff's Opposition, which relies on the declaration of her counsel, is credible and that the Plaintiff does not owe the Defendant a response to the discovery request because she does not possess the requested text messages. The Judge grants alternative relief, ordering the Plaintiff to serve a code-compliant and verified amended or supplemental response within 20 days. The Defendant's request for sanctions is denied, and the Judge declines to reach the issue of alleged spoliation of evidence at this time.
