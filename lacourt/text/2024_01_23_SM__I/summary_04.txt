And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling notes that the motion for fees is continued until further review. The case involves a UD (unlawful detainer) action in which the plaintiff prevailed on summary judgment. The Judge questions the reasonableness of the fees, which total $145,696. The billing rates are high, with senior counsel billing at $995 per hour, and the Judge wants further evidence to support these rates. Additionally, the Judge notes that there is no evidence that the plaintiff actually paid the bills, which is typically an indication of the bill's reasonableness. The Judge gives the plaintiff 15 court days to provide a declaration establishing the amounts and dates of payment by the client. The Judge also notes that the defendant's allegation of racial animus, which was ultimately unsupported by evidence, may warrant a higher hourly rate for the plaintiff's counsel. The hearing will reconvene in 25 court days, and the plaintiff may file supplemental papers in 15 court days.
