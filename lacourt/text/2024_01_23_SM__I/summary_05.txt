And here is the English-text summary:

The judge is inclined to sustain the unopposed demurrer to the eighth and ninth causes of action, without giving the plaintiff leave to amend. The judge believes that the issue has already been litigated and the arbitrator has determined the amount of damages, which has been fully compensated to the plaintiff. The judge also notes that the plaintiff has not opposed the demurrer and that the motion to strike is moot. The judge is willing to give the plaintiff leave to amend if they make a facially reasonable request, but will deny the request otherwise.
