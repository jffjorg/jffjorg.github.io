Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case where the plaintiff is seeking to compel the defendant's attendance at a deposition. The plaintiff served the defendant with proper deposition notices, but the defendant did not appear. The defendant did serve objections and some documents shortly before the deposition was scheduled, but the plaintiff tried to meet and confer and the defendant did not respond.

The judge has reviewed the requests for documents and has granted the motion as to requests 26-27, 30-34, and 37-38, finding good cause for those requests and that the objections are unsubstantiated. The judge has denied the request for documents that is premature and invades the work product protection.

The judge has also set a new date for the deposition, allowing the defendant to provide up to three dates that they will be unavailable and giving the plaintiff the opportunity to notice the deposition on dates not less than one week from today and not more than three weeks from today.

Finally, the judge has imposed sanctions against Lincoln Chayes in the amount of $6790.93, payable to the plaintiff's counsel within 30 days, for failing to appear for deposition. The judge notes that this case appears to be being over-pled and over-litigated, and that fees must be reasonable and necessary.
