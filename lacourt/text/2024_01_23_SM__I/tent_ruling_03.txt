 Case Number:  23SMCV00723    Hearing Date:   January 23, 2024    Dept:  I The application is CONTINUED.  Plaintiff needs to address whether a
non-existent entity can be sued or served. 
Right now, there is no evidence that Precise Partners is even a real
entity.  It could be no more than a DBA
(in which case it need not be served). 
The court tends to agree that if it is a real entity, serving at Coti
Williams’ address is the best way to affect service. Plaintiff will file
supplemental papers within 10 court days addressing this point and any other
matter plaintiff wishes to address.  The
matter will be continued until 16 court days from today at 9:00 am.
