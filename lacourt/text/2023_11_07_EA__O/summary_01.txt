And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling denies the plaintiff's application for default judgment without prejudice due to usurious interest rates. The case arises from breaches of equipment finance agreements between the plaintiff, PAWNEE LEASING CORPORATION, and the defendants, LITTLE FAT TRUCKING and XING WANG. The plaintiff seeks interest rates exceeding 10% per annum, which is usurious under California law. The court cites California Constitution, article XV, section 1, and Civil Code ยง 1598 and ยง 1599, which prohibit exaction of usurious rates of interest. The court rules that the interest provisions of the agreements are void, and the plaintiff is only entitled to repayment of the principal sum. The application is denied without prejudice.
