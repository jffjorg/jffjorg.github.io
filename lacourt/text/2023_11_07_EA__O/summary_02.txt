And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrers filed by defendants EAN HOLDINGS, LLC and Enterprise Rent-A-Car Company. The demurrers were filed on October 3, 2023, and the plaintiff filed an opposition to the demurrer filed by Enterprise on October 25, 2023. The judge has sustained the demurrers with leave to amend, meaning the plaintiff must re-file the complaint with more specific and clear allegations. The judge found that the complaint is uncertain and improperly lumps multiple defendants together, including non-individual defendants who cannot "operate" a vehicle. The judge also noted that the complaint lacks clarity and that the court cannot reach legal issues such as the Graves Amendment absent sufficient pleadings. The judge will review the briefs before making a final ruling on November 7, 2023.
