And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge, Kerry Bensinger, has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for interlocutory judgment of partition brought by Plaintiff Steve K. Lopez against Defendant Mai Thai. The motion seeks to partition by sale the Subject Property located at 1114, 1114 ½, and 1116 S. Kern Ave., Los Angeles, CA 90022.

The Judge finds that the court may only enter an interlocutory judgment after trial, as required by Code of Civil Procedure, sections 872.710 and 872.720. The Judge notes that Plaintiff's motion does not fall into the categories of dispositive motions and that none of the elements for an interlocutory judgment of partition have been proven by way of a dispositive motion.

The Judge therefore denies the motion for interlocutory judgment of partition and will set a trial date with counsel. The court will discuss the matter further at the trial.
