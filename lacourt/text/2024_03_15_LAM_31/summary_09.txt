The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the motions filed in this case. The Court has granted the motion to compel arbitration, finding that the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) preempts California law, including Section 36, which provides for a preference motion. The Court has also denied the motion for trial preference, as it is referred to the neutral arbitrator.

The Court finds that the arbitration agreement is valid and enforceable, and that the Plaintiff's arguments for illegality, unconscionability, and rescission are unsuccessful. The Court has ordered the action to be stayed pending arbitration, and has set a status conference for August 15, 2024, at 9:00 a.m. to review the arbitration status.
