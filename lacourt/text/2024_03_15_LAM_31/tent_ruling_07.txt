MOTION
FOR INTERLOCUTORY JUDGMENT OF PARTITION AND APPOINTMENT OF REFEREE



 
MOVING PARTY:               Plaintiff
Steve K. Lopez
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     Defendant Mai
Thai
 
 
I.          BACKGROUND
 
On June 27, 2022, Plaintiff, Steve K. Lopez, filed a
verified complaint against Defendant, Mai Thai, for partition by sale of real
property located at 1114, 1114 ½, and 1116 S. Kern Ave., Los Angeles, CA 90022
(the “Subject Property”).
 
On September 6, 2023, default was entered against
Defendant.  
 
On November 8, 2023, Plaintiff filed this motion for
interlocutory judgment of partition and for appointment of a referee.  
 
This motion was heard on December 22, 2023.  Defendant did not file written
opposition.  The court issued a tentative
order granting Plaintiff’s motion.  At
the hearing, Defendant appeared and represented to the court that she would seek
counsel to appear in this action.  The
court continued the motion to allow Defendant time to obtain counsel and to
oppose the motion.
 
On January 17, 2024, while still in default, Defendant filed
an opposition to this motion as a self-represented litigant.  
 
On January 25, 2024, Plaintiff and Defendant appeared for
the hearing on this motion.  At the
hearing, Plaintiff agreed to set aside the default.  
 
On February 1, 2024, Defendant filed her Answer. 
 
The court, having considered Defendant’s opposition, now
rules as follows.
 
II.        LEGAL
STANDARD & DISCUSSION
 
            “Under California law, the term ‘partition’ signifies ‘the
procedure for segregating and terminating common interests in the same parcel
of property.’¿ [Citation.]”¿ (14859 Moorpark Homeowner’s Ass’n v. VRT Corp. (1998)
63 Cal.App.4th 1396, 1404-1405 (Moorpark).)¿ Code of Civil Procedure,
Part 2, Title 10.5 governs actions for partition of real property.¿ (Code Civ.
Proc., § 872.020.)¿¿¿ 
 
“A co-owner of real or personal property may bring an action
for partition.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 872.210.)¿ The primary purpose of a
partition suit is … to partition the property, that is, to sever the unity of
possession.¿ Partition is a remedy much favored by the law.¿ The original
purpose of partition was to permit co-tenants to avoid the inconvenience and
dissension arising from sharing joint possession of land.¿ An additional reason
to favor partition is the policy of facilitating transmission of title, thereby
avoiding unreasonable restraints on the use and enjoyment of property.¿
[A]lthough the action of partition is of statutory origin in this state, it is
nonetheless an equitable proceeding ….¿[Citations.]”¿(Cummings v. Dessel (2017)
13 Cal.App.5th 589, 596-597.)¿ 
 
Plaintiff now moves the court for an interlocutory judgment
for partition by sale of the Subject Property and appointment of a referee,
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure, sections 872.710 and 872.720, subdivision
(a). Plaintiff contends that he is entitled to an interlocutory judgment to
partition the Subject Property as a matter of law.¿ (Mot, 6-8.)  
 
Defendant argues the motion should be denied because the
court may only enter interlocutory judgment after trial.
 
Defendant’s argument has merit.  Section 872.710, subdivision (a) states: “At
the trial, the court shall determine whether the plaintiff has the
right to partition.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 872.710, subd. (a).)(emphasis added)¿
“If the court finds that the plaintiff is entitled to partition, it shall make
an interlocutory judgment that determines the interests of the parties in the
property and orders the partition of the property and, unless it is to be later
determined, the manner of partition.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 872.720, subd.
(a).)¿ Viewed together, sections 872.710, subdivision (a) and 872.720,
subdivision (a) indicate that a court’s determination regarding an
interlocutory judgment is to be made at trial, or by means of a properly filed
dispositive motion as allowed under the Code of Civil Procedure.¿¿¿ 
 
In reply, Plaintiff argues a trial is not always required.[1]
But Plaintiff’s cited authority tends to support the view that a party seeking
an interlocutory judgment directing partition must as least file a dispositive
motion, such as a motion for summary adjudication (see LEG Investments v.
Boxler (2010) 183 Cal.App.4th 484, 497-98 [summary adjudication on partiion
by sale cause of action]) or judgment on the pleadings (see White v. White (1936)
11 Cal.App.2d 570, 570 [interlocutory judgment on the pleadings]).  However, Plaintiff’s motion does not fall
into either category.  
 
Plaintiff further argues that an interlocutory judgment for
partition is proper because the elements for such a judgment have been met and have
not been disputed by Defendant.  Specifically, (1) Plaintiff and Defendant are
joint tenants with an equal interest in the Subject Property; (2) Plaintiff did
not waive his right to partition; and (3) partition by sale is required where,
as here, the property cannot be split into parcels of equivalent value.  Plaintiff may be correct, however, none of
the foregoing elements were proven by way of a dispositive motion.  
 
III.         CONCLUSION
 
            The motion
for interlocutory judgment by partition is DENIED.  The court will discuss setting a trial date
with counsel.  
 
            Clerk of
the Court to give notice.
