And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Sasan Najibi, M.D. v. Providence Health System-Southern California, et al. The case involves a dispute over the suspension of Dr. Najibi's medical staff privileges by the defendants.

The judge has ruled that the demurrer filed by the defendants to the first cause of action, alleging violation of Health & Safety Code ยง 1278.5, is overruled. The judge found that Dr. Najibi's allegations of reporting patient safety issues to the defendants and the subsequent suspension of his hospital privileges are sufficient to state a claim under this statute.

However, the judge has sustained the demurrer to the second, third, and fourth causes of action, alleging violations of Business and Professions Code sections 510 and 2056, tortious interference with economic relations, and tortious interference with contractual relations, respectively. The judge found that these claims are barred because Dr. Najibi failed to exhaust administrative remedies before filing suit.

The judge has also denied leave to amend the complaint and ordered the defendants to serve and file their answer within 10 days of this order.
