Paragraphs 41 and 51 allege: “No judicial or administrative remedies need to be
exhausted for this cause of action because the underlying wrongful conduct is
Defendant’s violation of Health and Safety Code § 1278.5 and California
Business and Professions Code §510 et seq. and 2056 et seq.”  As discussed herein, the court disagrees with
Plaintiff’s conclusion of law. “We treat the demurrer as admitting all material
facts properly pleaded, but not contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact
or law.” (Serrano v. Priest (1971) 5 Cal.3d 584, 591.)

California Rules of Court, rules 8.1105(e)(1)(B) and 8.1115(e)(2).
