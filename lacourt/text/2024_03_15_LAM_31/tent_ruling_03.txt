I.          INTRODUCTION
 
            On July 12, 2022, Plaintiff, German Pantoja Reyes, filed a
Complaint against Defendants, Johann Peeters (“Peeters”) and J.P. Money Tax
Group, Inc. (“J.P. Money”), alleging causes of action for (1) Violation of the
Tax Preparation Act (Bus. & Prof. Code §§ 22250 et seq.), (2) Fraud, (3) Violation of Penal Code § 496, and (4) Unfair Competition.  
 
            On December
5, 2023, Plaintiff filed these motions to compel Peeters’s and J.P. Money’s
further responses to Special Interrogatories, Set Two, and Request for
Production of Documents, Set Two.  Plaintiff
requests sanctions against Peeters, J.P. Money, and their counsel of record.
 
            Peeters and
J.P. Money each filed oppositions.  Plaintiff
filed replies.
                         
II.        LEGAL STANDARDS
 
Under Code of Civil Procedure
sections 2030.300 and 2031.310, parties may move for a further response to
interrogatories and requests for production of documents where an answer to the
requests are evasive or incomplete or where an objection is without merit or
too general.¿ A motion to compel further response to requests for production
“shall set forth specific facts showing good cause justifying the discovery
sought by the inspection demand.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd.
(b)(1).)¿¿¿ 
¿¿ 
Notice of the motions must be
given within 45 days of service of the verified response, otherwise, the
propounding party waives any right to compel a further response.¿ (Code Civ.
Proc., §§ 2030.300, subd. (c); 2031.310, subd. (c).)¿ The motions must also be
accompanied by a meet and confer declaration.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300,
subd. (b)(1); 2031.310, subd. (b)(2).)¿¿¿ 
¿¿ 
Finally, Cal. Rules of Court, Rule
3.1345 requires that all motions or responses involving further discovery
contain a separate statement with the text of each request, the response, and a
statement of factual and legal reasons for compelling further responses.¿ (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(a)(3).)¿¿ 
 
            Monetary
Sanctions¿ 
¿ 
            Code
of Civil Procedure section 2023.030 is a general statute authorizing the Court
to impose discovery sanctions for “misuse of the discovery process,” which
includes (without limitation) a variety of conduct such as: making, without
substantial justification, an unmeritorious objection to discovery; making an
evasive response to discovery; and unsuccessfully and without substantial
justification making or opposing a motion to compel or limit discovery.¿ (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2023.010.)¿¿ 
¿ 
            If
sanctions are sought, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.040 requires that
the notice specify the identity of the person against whom sanctions are sought
and the type of sanction requested, that the motion be supported in the points
and authorities, and the facts be set forth in a declaration supporting the
amount of any monetary sanction.¿¿¿¿ 
 
            “If
a motion under [Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.450] subdivision (a) is
granted, the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing
with Section 2023.010) in favor of the party who noticed the deposition and
against the deponent or the party with whom the deponent is affiliated, unless
the court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial
justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction
unjust.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (g)(1).)¿¿¿¿ 
 
Sanctions against counsel:¿ The court in Kwan
Software Engineering, Inc. v. Hennings (2020) 58 Cal.App.5th 57, 81 (Hennings)
noted that discovery sanctions against an attorney are governed by a different
standard than sanctions against a party:¿¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿ 
By the terms of the statute, a trial court under section
2023.030(a) may not impose monetary sanctions against a party’s attorney unless
the court finds that the attorney “advised” the party to engage in the conduct
resulting in sanctions. (§ 2023.030(a); Ghanooni v. Super Shuttle (1993)
20 Cal.App.4th 256, 261, 24 Cal.Rptr.2d 501.)¿ “Unlike monetary sanctions
against a party, which are based on the party's misuse of the discovery
process, monetary sanctions against the party's attorney require a finding the
‘attorney advis[ed] that conduct.’ ” (Ibid.) “It is not enough that the
attorney's actions were in some way improper.” (Corns v. Miller (1986)
181 Cal.App.3d 195, 200, 226 Cal.Rptr. 247 (Corns).) Because an
attorney's advice to a client is “peculiarly within [his or her] knowledge,”
the attorney has the burden of showing that he or she did not counsel discovery
abuse. (Ibid.) Accordingly, when a party seeking sanctions against an
attorney offers sufficient evidence of a misuse of the discovery process, the
burden shifts to the attorney to demonstrate that he or she did not recommend
that conduct. (Id. at pp. 200–201, 226 Cal.Rptr. 247; Ghanooni,
at p. 262, 24 Cal.Rptr.2d 501.)¿ 
 
III.      DISCUSSION
 
1.      Procedural
Requirements  
 
Unless notice of the motion is
given within 45 days of the service of the verified response, or any
supplemental verified response, or any specific later date to which the
requesting party and the responding party have agreed in writing, the
requesting party waives any right to compel further response to the
interrogatory, demand for inspection, or request for admission.¿ (Code Civ.
Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (c), 2031.290, subd. (c).)¿ Here, Peeters and J.P.
Money served objection-only responses to the at issue discovery requests.  There is no dispute over the timeliness of
these motions.  Accordingly, the court
finds the motions are timely.¿ The court further finds that the Informal
Discovery Conference (IDC) requirement and meet and confer requirement have
been satisfied.
 
2.     
Special Interrogatories
 
Plaintiff seeks a further response
from Peeters and J.P. Money (hereafter, “Defendants”) to Special Interrogatory (“SROG”),
Set Two, Nos. 4-14.  As Defendants
asserted the same objections to each interrogatory, the court addresses Defendants’
responses together.
 
SROG Nos. 4-14 each seek contact information
of Defendants’ customers from 2013 to 2023.
 
In response to SROG Nos. 4-14,
Defendants asserted the following objection: 
 
“Responding Party objects to this Interrogatory on
the grounds that it is vague and ambiguous. Responding Party further objects to
this Interrogatory on the grounds that it is overbroad as to time and scope.
Responding Party further objects to this Interrogatory on the grounds that it
seeks information that is neither relevant to the subject matter of this action
nor reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.
Responding Party further objects to this Request on the grounds that it seeks
confidential information without the specific consent of the clients. (See Cal.
Bus. & Prof. Code § 22252.1; See also AICPA Rule 301.)”
 
            Defendants’
principal point of contention is that Plaintiff does not have standing to bring
a representative action under Business and Professions Code section 22257.  Plaintiff argues to the contrary.  However, as alleged in the Complaint, Plaintiff
brings this action in his individual capacity. 
There is no indication this case (at this time) is a class action
lawsuit with Plaintiff serving as a representative of a class of
individuals.  Therefore, the court finds
Nos. 4-14 do not seek any information that is relevant to the prosecution of
Plaintiff’s individual claims.  Specifically,
the customers to whom Defendants provided services have no bearing on
Defendants’ alleged violations in providing tax services to Plaintiff.  The objections have merit.  A further response is not warranted.
 
3.     
Request for
Production of Documents
 
Plaintiff seeks a further response to Request for Production
of Documents (“RPD”), Set Two, Nos. 11-54. [1]  As
Defendants asserted the same objection to the same production requests, the
court addresses Defendants’ responses together.
 
Plaintiff classifies the productions requests into four
categories: Nos. 11-21; Nos. 22-32; Nos. 33-43; and Nos. 44-54.
 
            RPD Nos.
11-21
 
            Nos. 11-21 seek written contracts between Defendants and
their customers from 2013 to 2023.
 
In response to Nos. 11-21, Defendants asserted the following
objection:
 
Responding
Party objects to this Request on the grounds that the undefined term “customer”
is vague and ambiguous. Responding Party further objects to this Request on the
grounds that it seeks documents that are neither relevant nor reasonably
calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. Responding Party
further objects to this Request on the grounds that it seeks confidential
information without the specific consent of the clients. (See Cal. Bus. &
Prof. Code § 22252.1; See also AICPA Rule 301.)
 
            For the
same reasons stated above, Defendant’s objections have merit.  A further response is not warranted. 
 
RPD Nos. 22-32, 33-43 and Nos. 44-54
 
            Nos. 22-32
seek evidence of Defendants’ compliance with the bonding requirements of
Business & Professions Code section 22250.1, including the bond number provided
to each customer Defendants provided services to, from 2013 to 2023.
 
In response to Nos. 22-32, Defendants asserted the following
objection: 
 
Responding
Party objects to this Request on the grounds that it is overbroad and seeks
documents that are neither relevant nor reasonably calculated to lead to the
discovery of admissible evidence because this is not a representative action,
requests information during a time period where no services may have been
provided to Propounding Party, and improperly assumes the scope of the services
that Responding Party agreed to provide to Propounding Party.
 
Nos. 33-43 seek copies of the written notices of the California
Tax Education Council’s (CTEC) web address that Defendants provided to each of their
customers from 2013 to 2023.
 
Nos. 44-45 seeks copies of the completely redacted return
documents that Defendants prepared for their customers from 2013 to 2023.
 
In response to Nos. 33-43 and Nos.
44-54, Defendants asserted the following similar objection:
 
Responding
Party objects to this Request on the grounds that it is overbroad and seeks
documents that are neither relevant nor reasonably calculated to lead to the
discovery of admissible evidence because this is not a representative action,
requests information during a time period where no services may have been provided
to Propounding Party, and improperly assumes the scope of the services that
Responding Party agreed to provide to Propounding Party. Responding Party
further objects to this Request on the grounds that it seeks confidential
information without the specific consent of the clients. (See Cal. Bus. &
Prof. Code § 22252.1; See also AICPA Rule 301.)
 
As discussed above, Defendants’ compliance with bonding
requirements, written notices of the CTEC’s web address, and the tax return
documents as they pertain to other customers are not relevant to Plaintiff’s
individual claims.  Plaintiff’s only
ground for seeking this information is his insistence that he has standing to
bring a representative action under Business and Professions Code section
22257.  That may be true.  But Plaintiff’s theory has yet to be tested
because this case as pleaded involves a single defendant.  Defendants’ objections have merit. A further
response is not warranted.
 
            Monetary
Sanctions
 
            Plaintiff
requests sanctions against Peeters, J.P. Money, and their counsel of record.  Given that the court has found further
responses are not warranted to the at-issue discovery requests, there is no
basis to impose sanctions.  
 
IV.       CONCLUSION 
 
            Based on
the foregoing, the motions are DENIED.  The request for sanctions is DENIED.  
 
Defendants to give notice, unless waived.
