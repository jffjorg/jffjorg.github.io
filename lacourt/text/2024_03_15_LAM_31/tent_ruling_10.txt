[1]  Plaintiff’s
arguments rest primarily on the claim he is entitled to a trial preference pursuant
to CCP section 36.  Given the Court’s
ruling on the preference motion, Plaintiff’s opposition unravels. Nonetheless,
for the sake of completeness, the Court proceeds alternatively and addresses Plaintiff’s
arguments as if the preference motion were granted.  


[2] Plaintiff spends the first seven
pages of his opposition to the motion to compel repeating the arguments he made
in his trial preference motion.  The
Court need not address these arguments again.   


[3]  The
parties dispute the applicability of two cases. 
Defendant
cites Laswell v. AG Seal Beach, LLC (2010) 189 Cal.App.4th 1399, for the
proposition that even when a party has meritorious preference motion, the court
will order the parties into arbitration where there is an enforceable
arbitration agreement.  Plaintiff counters
with Vinokur v. Superior Court (1988)
198 Cal.App.3d 500, arguing that when a preference motion is granted it takes
preference over a conflicting judicial arbitration statute.  Neither case is on point.  Vinokur is inapposite because it did
not involve a contractual arbitration agreement.  While Laswell is closer to the mark, the
Appellate Court did not discuss issues of illegality, unconscionability, or preemption.       


[4]  Although
counsel raises illegality, unconscionability and recission because these are generally
applicable contractual defenses, these arguments lack merit for the reasons
discussed herein.  Because the
arbitration agreement is enforceable, the matter circles back to where we
began – preemption.  And for the reasons stated above, Defendant’s
preemption argument prevails.
