And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to compel responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One. The defendant, Alejandra Gomez, had propounded the interrogatories on July 29, 2024, and the responses were due on August 30, 2024. Despite two deadline extensions, the plaintiff, Marcy Linares, failed to serve responses. The judge has ordered the plaintiff to serve responses within 20 days of the date of this order.

Additionally, the judge has granted the defendant's request for sanctions in the reduced amount of $535.00. The defendant had requested $1,135.00 in sanctions, but the judge found that the time spent on the motion was unreasonable. The sanctions will be paid to the defendant's counsel within 20 days of the date of this order.
