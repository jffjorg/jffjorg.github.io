 [TENTATIVE] RULING RE:
Motion for
  Terminating Sanctions and Monetary Sanctions [RES ID # 9652]



 
I. Background
A. Pleadings
Plaintiff Jonathan Neil &
Associates, Inc. sues Defendants Healing Hands Care, Inc., a California corporation,
Ara Tovmassian aka Ara Mesrop Tovmassian, and Does 1 through 50 pursuant to an
August 28, 2023, Complaint alleging ten breach of contract claims stemming from
unpaid loan agreements. 
On October 27, 2023 Defendant
Tovmassian filed an Answer to the Complaint. 
B. Relevant Procedural History
On January 2, 2024, Plaintiff
served Form Interrogatories – General, Set One (FROGs, Set One), and Requests
for Admission (RFAs), Set One on Defendant Tovmassian. 
Responses to FROGS, Set One, and
RFAs, Set one, were due on February 6, 2024, 35 days after service by mail on
January 2, 2024. 
On March 20, 2024, based on
Defendant Tovmassian’s non-response to RFAs, Set One, Plaintiff filed a motion
to deem the truth of RFAs, Set One, admitted as against Defendant Tovmassian. 
On March 22, 2024, based on
Defendant Tovmassian’s non-response to FROGs, Set One, Plaintiff filed a motion
to compel initial responses to FROGs, Set One, from Defendant Tovmassian. 
Defendant Tovmassian failed to
oppose the motions despite service. 
The Court granted both motions and
granted monetary sanctions. (4/18/2024 Minute Order [granting the motion to
compel responses to FROGs and issuing monetary sanctions of $850.00]; 7/9/2024
Minute Order [granting the motion to deem RFAs admitted and issuing monetary
sanctions of $850.00].)
C. Motion Before the Court
On August 26, 2024, Plaintiff filed
the instant motion for terminating sanctions and monetary sanctions in the
amount of $4,525.00 against Defendant Tovmassian. Plaintiff argues that, as of
the date the motion was filed, Defendant Tovmassian has completely failed to
serve discovery responses or remit sanctions as ordered by this Court. 
The motion was served on Defendant
Tovmassian at his Studio City, California address. Defendant Tovmassian has not
filed an opposition. 
Plaintiff’s motion is now before
the Court. 
 
II. Motion
A. Legal Standard
Terminating sanctions are drastic sanctions that should be
imposed sparingly and only when it is clear that the party to be sanctioned has
left no viable alternatives. (See Dept. of Forestry
& Fire. Prot. v. Howell (2017) 18 Cal.App.5th 154, 191, disapproved
on other grounds in Presbyterian Camp & Conf. Ctrs, Inc. v. Superior
Court (2021) 12 Cal.5th 493; Lopez v. Watchtower Bible & Tract Soc’y
(2016) 246 Cal.App.4th 566, 604.) 
The court should consider the
totality of the circumstances before ordering terminating sanctions, including
(1) whether the conduct of the party was willful, (2) the detriment to the
party propounding discovery, and (3) the number of formal and informal attempts
to obtain the discovery. (Los Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez (2014) 223
Cal.App.4th 377, 390.) The Court is not required to find that a party acted in
bad faith before imposing terminating sanctions. (See Creed-21 v. City of
Wildomar (2017) 18 Cal.App.5th 690, 703.) 

If terminating sanctions are warranted, the Court may make: 
(1) An order striking all or parts of the pleadings (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (d)(1); Doppes v. Bentley Motors, Inc.
(2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 967, 992; Van Sickle v. Gilbert (2011) 196
Cal.App.4th 1495, 1519 [trial court struck defendant’s answer]); 
(2) An order staying proceedings until a party obeys a
discovery order (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (d)(2); Doppes v.
Bentley Motors, Inc., supra, 174 Cal.App.4th at p. 992); 
(3) An order dismissing all or part of a party’s action
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (d)(3); Doppes v. Bentley Motors, Inc.,
supra, 174 Cal.App.4th at p. 992; see, e.g., Crawford v. JPMorgan
Chase Bank (2015) 242 Cal.App.4th 1265, 1271 [dismissal proper when party
threatened to use pepper spray and taser on opposing counsel at deposition and
was openly contemptuous of trial court]); and 
(4) An order rendering a default judgment against a party
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (d)(4); Doppes v. Bentley Motors, Inc.,
supra, 174 Cal.App.4th at p. 992; see, e.g., Electronic Funds
Solutions, LLC v. Murphy (2005) 134 Cal.App.4th 1161, 1183-1184
[defendant’s pervasive and consistent misuse of discovery process supported
court’s dismissal of answer and entry of default judgment]; but see Nickell
v. Matlock (2012) 206 Cal.App.4th 934, 943-944 [Code Civ. Proc., § 764.010
prohibits court from rendering judgment by default as discovery sanction in
quiet title actions]). 
B. Terminating Sanctions
Plaintiff asserts that terminating
sanctions are warranted here because Defendant Tovmassian has failed to serve
responses to any discovery propounded, comply with court orders, or pay
court-ordered monetary sanctions. Plaintiff further argues that terminating
sanctions are justified because the monetary sanctions already awarded were
ignored and have not deterred Defendant Tovmassian’s conduct. Plaintiff argues that
Defendant Tovmassian’s conduct has brought the case to a standstill and impeded
Plaintiff’s ability to prepare for trial. Plaintiff requests that Defendant's
Answer be stricken, which Plaintiff argues will result in no prejudice since
all admissions are already deemed admitted and a default already exists as to the
corporate Co-Defendant, Healing Hands Care, Inc. 
Here, Defendant Tovmassian’s
failure to comply with either this Court’s April 18, 2024 or July 9, 2024 orders,
by failing to serve responses to FROGs or RFAs, Set One, is a clear detriment
to Plaintiff who is unable to otherwise move the litigation forward and pursue its
claims. Plaintiff has attempted to resolve Defendant Tovmassian non-compliance
with “courtesy prompts” without response. (Minassian Decl. ¶ 5; see 3/22/2024
FROGs motion, Minassian Decl., Ex. A [email correspondence from Plaintiff’s
counsel to Defendant Tovmassian inquiring whether he has sent discovery
requests and indicating Plaintiff’s counsel attempted to reach Tovmassian by
phone as well].)
The discovery at issue was served
on January 2, 2024, and at this time, ten months later, Defendant Tovmassian
has failed to respond, in contravention of this Court’s April 18 and July 9,
2024, orders, which ordered compliance within 14 days. Additionally, Defendant
Tovmassian has not opposed any of the motions to compel or this motion for
terminating sanctions. Nor has he appeared at a hearing since January 2024. Trial
is now set for December 6, 2024, which makes the date by which the parties must
complete all discovery November 6, 2024. T(Code Civ. Proc. § 2024.020.) The
prejudice to Plaintiff is clear.
Terminating sanctions are a severe
measure and should be imposed sparingly, only when the party to be sanctioned
has clearly left no viable alternatives. (See Dept. of Forestry & Fire.
Prot. v. Howell, supra, 18 Cal.App.5th at
191.) Given Defendant Tovmassian’s indifference to this litigation and
disregard for the Court’s prior orders and sanctions, and given the prejudice
to Plaintiff, it appears that further issue or monetary sanctions would be
futile. 
            Thus,
terminating sanctions are GRANTED. 
            C. Monetary
Sanctions
Based on the above reasoning, that
Defendant Tovmassian has disregarded this Court’s April 18, 2024 and July 9,
2024 orders, monetary sanctions against him are proper. 
Plaintiff requests sanctions
against Defendant Tovmassian, in the
total amount of $4,525.00 based upon counsel’s rate of $395.00/hour for (1) 7.0
total hours of work in the preparation of this motion, supporting declaration,
and related research, (2) filing fee of $60.00, and (3) the previously unpaid
$1,770.00 sanction order. (Minassian Decl. ¶ 9.) The Court will not make an additional order of $1,770, since
that amount has already been ordered. However, the Court will grant the
remainder of the request.
Monetary sanctions are thus GRANTED in the amount of $2,825.00.
III. Conclusion
Plaintiff Jonathan Neil &
Associates, Inc. Motion for Terminating and Monetary Sanctions Against
Defendant Ara Tovmassian is GRANTED as follows:
(1)  
GRANTED as to terminating sanctions,
(2)  
GRANTED as to monetary sanctions in the amount of $2,825.00, which does not include the
$1,770.00 in sanctions previously ordered against Defendant Tovmassian.
The Court STRIKES Defendant Ara
Tovmassian October 27, 2023 Answer and ENTERS DEFAULT on the August 28, 2023 Complaint
as against Defendant Ara Tovmassian.
