 [TENTATIVE] RULING RE:
Motion to Enforce
  Settlement [RES ID #6715]



 
I. Background
A. Pleadings
Plaintiff Jessica Castillo (Castillo)
sues Defendant FCA US LLC pursuant to three Song Beverly Consumer Warranty Act
(“lemon law”) claims—breach of express warranty, breach of implied warranty,
and failure to repair—on the grounds that the 2018 Dodge Durango (“Subject
Vehicle”) purchased by Castillo on November 11, 2018 and manufactured by
Defendant FCA US was delivered to Castillo with serious defects and
nonconformities to warranty and developed other serious defects and
nonconformities to warranty including, but not limited to, electrical,
suspension, transmission, engine and structural system defects, which
FCA-approved repair facilities were not able to rectify within the statutorily
prescribed or reasonable time.
B. Relevant Procedural History
On December 13, 2023, Castillo
signed the Code of Civil Procedure section 998 Offer to Compromise (998 Offer) in
the amount of $99,000.00 and emailed the executed copy to Defendant’s counsel. 
On April 29, 2024, the Court held
an Order to Show Cause Regarding Dismissal (Settlement) Conference. The Court
dismissed the matter without prejudice. The 998 Offer permits the Court to
retain jurisdiction to enforce the offer of compromise under Code of Civil
Procedure Section 664.6. (Kohanoff Decl., Ex. 1., 998 Offer, ¶ 7)
C. Motion Before the Court
On August 6, 2024, Castillo filed
this Motion to Enforce Settlement and Request for Sanctions, attaching a facially
valid proof of service by electronic mail.
On September 24, 2024 Castillo
filed a Notice of Non-Opposition.  
 
II. Motion
A. Legal Standard
“If parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a writing
signed by the parties outside of the presence of the court or orally before the
court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon motion, may
enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement. If requested by the
parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties to enforce the
settlement until performance in full of the terms of the settlement.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 664.6, subd. (a).) 
“Because of its summary nature, strict compliance with the
requirements of [Code of Civil Procedure] section 664.6 is prerequisite to
invoking the power of the court to impose a settlement agreement.” (J.B.B.
Inv. Partners, Ltd. v. Fair (2014) 232 Cal. App. 4th 974, 984, as modified
Dec. 30, 2014.) “Thus, the statute requires the signatures of the parties
seeking to enforce the agreement under Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6
and against whom the agreement is sought to be enforced.” (Ibid.,
internal quotations and brackets omitted; Kohn v. Jaymar-Ruby (1994) 23
Cal.App.4th 1530, 1533 [“In deciding motions made under Section 664.6, judges
“must determine whether the parties entered into a valid and binding
settlement”].) 
Code of Civil Procedure section 998 subdivision (b)(1) provides in
relevant part: “Not less than 10 days prior to commencement of trial or
arbitration (as provided in Section 1281 or 1295) of a dispute to be resolved
by arbitration, any party may serve an offer in writing upon any other party to
the action to allow judgment to be taken to an award to be entered in
accordance with the terms and conditions stated at the time. (1) If the offer
is accepted, the offer with proof of acceptance shall be filed and the clerk or
the judge shall enter judgment accordingly.” 
B. Analysis
Here, Castillo provides evidence of
the 998 Offer between the parties. (Kohanoff Decl., Ex. 1., 998 Offer.) The 998
Offer is signed by Castillo’s counsel and Defendant’s counsel. As Defendant did
not oppose the motion, there is no dispute that there was a valid and
enforceable settlement agreement between the parties made pursuant to section
998. 
Per the terms of the 998 Offer,
Defendant stated that it would perform its obligations within sixty days of
acceptance. (Kohanoff Decl., Ex. 1., 998 Offer, ¶ 2.) Castillo accepted the 998
Offer on December 13, 2023. Thus, Defendant was to perform its obligations by
February 11, 2024. It is undisputed that Defendant has failed to disburse any
portion of the settlement funds. (Kohanoff Decl. ¶ 7.) Additionally, it is
undisputed that, despite multiple requests from Castillo’s counsel, Defendant’s
counsel has failed to provide information regarding surrender of the subject
vehicle. (Kohanoff Decl. ¶ 5, Ex. 2.) 
As Castillo has satisfied the
requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6, entry of judgment is
proper. 
Castillo also requests attorney
fees and costs for bringing the motion under Code of Civil Procedure section
128.5. (Mot., p. 6, Kohanoff Decl. ¶ 11.) As noted by Castillo, the delay in
this matter, failure to respond to repeated communications, and the further failure
to file an opposition, support the request to find that sanctions in the minimal
amount of $2,588.00 are justified, under that code section.
Castillo’s request for attorney
fees and costs of $2,588.00 is therefore granted.
III. Conclusion
Plaintiff Jessica Castillo’s Motion
to Enforce Settlement is GRANTED. 
Plaintiff is ordered to submit a
proposed judgment within five court days. An OSC re: entry of judgment will be
scheduled on October 28, 2024 at 8:30 a.m.
