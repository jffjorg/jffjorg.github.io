Motion to
  Substitute Deceased Plaintiff [RES ID # 5993]



 
I. Background
Plaintiff Olivia Lindsey (Lindsey)
sues Defendants Uber Technologies, Rasier LLC, Rasier-CA, LLC, William Arthur
Newsom and Does 1 through 100, pursuant to a March 15, 2024 Complaint alleging
causes of action for (1) Motor Vehicle and (2) General Negligence. The claims
arise from a motor vehicle collision that occurred on July 24, 2023. 
On August 26, 2024, Lindsey filed a
motion to substitute in David J. Lindsey, as Olivia
Lindsey’s successor-in-interest, on grounds that Olivia passed away on June 2,
2024.
On September 25, 2024, Lindsay
filed an amended motion. 
No opposition has been filed. 
 
II. Motion
A. Legal Standard
“A cause of action that survives
the death of the person entitled to commence an action or proceeding passes to
the decedent’s successor in interest . . . and an action may be commenced by
the decedent’s personal representatives or, if none, by the decedent’s
successor in interest.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 377.30.)  After the
death of a plaintiff, the court, on motion, shall allow a pending action that
does not abate to be continued by the decedent’s personal representative or
successor-in-interest.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 377.31.) 
The person who seeks to commence or
continue a pending action as the decedent’s successor-in-interest shall execute
and file an affidavit or declaration stating: (1) the
decedent’s name, (2) the date and place of decedent’s death, (3) “No proceeding
is now pending in California for administration of the decedent’s estate,” (4)
a copy of the final order showing the distribution of the decedent’s cause of
action to the successor-in-interest, if the decedent’s estate was administered,
(5) either the affiant or declarant is the decedent’s successor in interest or
the affiant or declarant is authorized to act on behalf of the decedent’s
successor in interest, with facts in support thereof, (6) “No other person has
a superior right to commence the action or proceeding or to be substituted for
the decedent in the pending action or proceeding,” and (7) the statements are
true, under penalty of perjury.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
377.32(a)(1)-(7).) 
Additionally, a certified copy of
the decedent’s death certificate shall be attached to the affidavit or
declaration. (Code Civ. Proc., § 377.32(c).) 
B. Analysis
Here, David J. Lindsey, as Plaintiff
Olivia Lindsey’s successor-in-interest has filed a declaration that states (1)
the Decedent’s name, (2) the date and place of Decedent’s death, (3) “No
proceeding is now pending in California for administration of the Decedent’s
estate,” (4) decedent’s estate has not been administered, (5) the declarant is
the Decedent’s successor in interest, (6) “No other person has a superior right
to be substituted for the Decedent in the pending action or proceeding,” and
(7) the statements are true, under penalty of perjury. (Twomey Decl., Ex.
2, Lindsey Decl; Code Civ. Proc., § 377.32(a)(1)-(7).
Plaintiff has also attached a
certified copy of Olivia Lindsey’s death certificate. (Twomey Decl., Ex. 3,
Certificate of Death; Code Civ. Proc., § 377.32(c).) 
Accordingly, Plaintiff has
satisfied the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 377.32. 
III. Conclusion
            The Motion to Substitute Deceased Plaintiff is
GRANTED.
