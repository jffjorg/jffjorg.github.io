And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling is about a motion to enforce a settlement agreement between Jessica Castillo and FCA US LLC. The settlement agreement was made through a Code of Civil Procedure section 998 Offer, which was signed by both parties. The offer required FCA US LLC to perform its obligations within 60 days of acceptance, which was on December 13, 2023. However, FCA US LLC failed to disburse any portion of the settlement funds and also failed to provide information regarding surrender of the subject vehicle. As a result, the court grants the motion to enforce the settlement agreement and orders the plaintiff to submit a proposed judgment within five court days. The court also grants the plaintiff's request for attorney fees and costs in the amount of $2,588.00.
