Berman v. Sonic Automotive, Inc., et al., Case No. 23SMCV01240
Hearing date January 18, 2024
Plaintiff Berman’s Motion to File First Amended Complaint
Defendant Sonic Santa Monica’s Motion to Compel
Arbitration
 
Plaintiff Berman purchased an allegedly defective car from
defendant Sonic Automotive, which moves to compel arbitration. On December 6,
2023 the court continued the hearing to allow supplemental briefing regarding
whether the contract should be rescinded due to fraud/negligent
misrepresentation. Plaintiff seeks to file a FAC, adding new causes of action
for fraud, racketeering and declaratory relief, and removing Mercedez Benz as a
defendant.
 
Defendant Sonic’s Motion to Compel Arbitration
Evidentiary Objections
SUSTAIN: 1, 2, 3 (second sentence only), 4, 5 (third and
fourth sentences only) 
OVERRULE: 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 1281.2(b) provides an
exemption from an agreement to arbitrate if grounds exist for rescission of
that agreement. 
 
The vehicle sold was previously involved in a collision,
which was disclosed to defendant Sonic a month before Sonic sold it to Berman.
Berman argues this supports his request for recission, and section 1281.2(b) applies.
Berman cites William Little v. David Pullman (2013) 219 Cal.App.4th 558,
which allows a trial court to determine a party’s entitlement to recission in
the context of a motion to compel arbitration. Id. at 570. “A party that believes it has been fraudulently induced to
enter into a contract may rescind. Village Northridge Homeowners Ass’n. v.
State Farm Fire & Casualty Co. (2010) 50 Cal.4th 913, 921, 114
Cal.Rptr.3d 280, 237 P.3d 598. Rescission is accomplished by giving notice to
the other party to the agreement and restoring or offering to restore
everything of value received. (Civ.Code, § 1691; Larsen v. Johannes
(1970) 7 Cal.App.3d 491, 503, 86 Cal.Rptr. 744 [settlement agreement may be
rescinded if the rescinding party returns benefits received under the
agreement].)” Little, supra, 219 Cal.App.4th at 566. 
 
In Little, the
court found rescission of the agreement ineffective because defendant failed to
restore funds received. Id. at 567. The court identified three problems
with that tender: (1) “Pullman did not offer to pay or deliver the $42,500, but
merely made available for pickup a check for $42,500;” (2) “tender was
conditional on Little accepting that it constituted “payment in full to effect
the rescission of agreement”; and (3) “Little, in the end, rejected the check,
which he was entitled to do” such that “Pullman was then obligated to make a
conforming tender,” which he refused to do. Id. 566-567.
Here, Berman complies with all rescission requirements: (1) he
asserted his right to rescission via letter dated March 2, 2023 to W.I.
Simonson (Sonic), prior to filing the lawsuit; (2) he sought rescission in the
complaint and proposed FAC; and (3) he offered to restore all consideration
exchanged and demands return of the purchase price. See Plaintiff’s
Supp. Brief p. 4. 
 
The March 2, 2023 letter provides Sonic notice of recission.
Supp. Slott Decl., Exh. I, p. 2. Berman offered to return the vehicle, and the
rescission of the parties’ RISC agreement is effective. Berman provided
the location and address of where the vehicle could be picked up. Id. Berman
did not make the tender conditional; he did not state his offer to return the
vehicle constituted recission of the agreement; he demanded a refund of the
purchase along with an offer to return the vehicle to signify the parties’
rescission. Additionally, unlike in Little, where a settlement payment
was involved, here, the only conforming tender for the rescission was an offer
to return the vehicle itself. A conforming tender was made. 
 
Sonic fails to rebut this showing with any contradicting
evidence or authority. From the evidence presented, the finds plaintiff meets
the criteria for rescission. The motion to compel arbitration is DENIED. 
 
Plaintiff’s Motion for Leave to File FAC
There is great liberality in allowing for amendment of
pleadings, as acknowledged in defendant’s opposition. As the motion to compel
arbitration is denied, the motion is GRANTED.
