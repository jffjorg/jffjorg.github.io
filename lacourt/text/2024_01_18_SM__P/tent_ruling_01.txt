v. White, Case No. 20SMCV01545
Hearing date January
18, 2024
Receiver Byron Z.
Moldo’s Motion for Approval of Final Report and Account
 
Plaintiff City of
Calabasas sued for injunctive and equitable relief of a nuisance at defendant’s
property. The court appointed Byron Moldo as post-judgment receiver to sell the
property. Following close of escrow, Moldo seeks court approval and
confirmation of a final account and report, distribution of sales proceeds,
discharge of the receiver and exoneration of the bond. 
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 564 provides for appointment of a
receiver. California
Rules of Court, Rule 3.1184 provides a receiver must present: (1) a final
account and report, (2) a request for the discharge, and (3) a request for
exoneration of the receiver’s surety. Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1184(a). Rule
3.1184 further provides “[n]otice of the motion or of the stipulation must be
given to every person or entity known to the receiver to have a substantial,
unsatisfied claim that will be affected by the order or stipulation, whether or
not the person or entity is a party to the action or has appeared in it.” Id., rule 3.1184(c).  
 
Moldo submitted a
final account and report, request for discharge and request for exoneration, as
well as notice. Moldo complied with CRC Rule 3.1184.
 
The final report
and accounting demonstrates Moldo completed all the receiver’s duties. The
court approved and confirmed sale of the property for $900,000 on July 24,
2023. On August 8, 2023 escrow closed, and Moldo received funds of $446,280.62
and a final settlement statement. Given the sale, receipt of the funds, a final
settlement statement and lack of opposition to the final report and accounting,
the court approves the final report and accounting. The court approves Moldo’s
request for discharge.
 
Receiver seeks
reimbursement of $14,630.00 receivership fees and expenses. Receivers are
entitled to compensation. Venza v. Venza (1951) 101 Cal.App.2d 678, 680.
Generally, the costs of a receivership are paid from the property in the
receivership estate. Andrade v. Andrade (1932) 216 Cal. 108, 110. 
 
Moldo requested payment
of the outstanding portion of his approved compensation and costs. There are no
objections. Invoices attached to Moldo’s declaration re: final report and
accounting support the $14,630.00 sought. See Moldo Decl., Exhib. D. Moldo is $14,630.00
in fees and costs.
 
The final report
and accounting are APPROVED, as is payment for Moldo’s compensation and costs.
