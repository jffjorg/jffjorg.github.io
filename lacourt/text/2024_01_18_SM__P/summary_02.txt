And here is the summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses two motions: Defendant Sonic Automotive, Inc.'s Motion to Compel Arbitration and Plaintiff Berman's Motion to File First Amended Complaint. The judge finds that Berman has complied with all rescission requirements and is entitled to rescind the agreement due to fraud/negligent misrepresentation. Specifically, Berman provided Sonic with notice of rescission via letter dated March 2, 2023, and offered to return the vehicle and restore all consideration exchanged. The judge finds that Sonic fails to rebut this showing with any contradicting evidence or authority, and therefore denies the motion to compel arbitration. The judge also grants Berman's motion to file a first amended complaint, which adds new causes of action for fraud, racketeering, and declaratory relief, and removes Mercedez Benz as a defendant.
