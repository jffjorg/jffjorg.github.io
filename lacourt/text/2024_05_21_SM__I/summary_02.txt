And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the defendants' motion to set aside the default judgment. The defendants argue that the service of the summons was improper because it was made on a person they do not recognize. The judge ruled that the judgment is not void, but rather voidable. The judge also found that the defendants were aware of the problem in July 2022, but did not take action to file a motion to set aside the default judgment until 21 months later. The judge concluded that the motion is untimely and denied it.
