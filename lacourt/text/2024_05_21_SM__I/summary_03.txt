```

And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the plaintiffs' motion for leave to file a third amended complaint. The motion was filed in response to the court's order granting defendant Elliman's motion for summary judgment. The plaintiffs claim to be the victims of a fraudulent scheme known as the "Buy, Build, and Sell" program. They allege that defendant Moore convinced them to participate in the program, which was a joint venture between Moore and Elliman. However, the court finds that the amendment would be futile because there is no joint venture relationship between Elliman and Moore. The court also finds that the delay in seeking to amend is unjustified and that the amendment would be prejudicial to Elliman. Therefore, the court denies the motion for leave to amend.
