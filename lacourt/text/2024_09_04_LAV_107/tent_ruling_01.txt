LEGAL
STANDARD 
 
A demurrer is a
pleading used to test the legal sufficiency of other pleadings. It raises
issues of law, not fact, regarding the form or content of the opposing party's
pleading (complaint, answer or cross-complaint). (Code Civ. Proc., § 422.10;
see Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) It
is not the function of the demurrer to challenge the truthfulness of the
complaint; and for purposes of ruling on the demurrer, all facts pleaded in the
complaint are assumed to be true. (Id., at pp. 993-994.)
 
A demurrer can be used
only to challenge defects that appear on the face of the pleading under attack;
or from matters outside the pleading that are judicially noticeable. (Blank
v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318; Donabedian, supra, 116
Cal.App.4th at p. 994.) No other extrinsic evidence can be
considered. (Ion Equip. Corp. v. Nelson (1980) 110 Cal.App.3d 868,
881 [error for court to consider facts asserted in memorandum supporting
demurrer]; see also Afuso v. United States Fid. & Guar. Co. (1985)
169 Cal.App.3d 859, 862, disapproved on other grounds in Moradi-Shalal v.
Fireman’s Fund Ins. Cos. (1988) 46 Cal.3d 287 [error to consider contents
of release not part of court record].)
 
A demurrer can be utilized
where the “face of the complaint” itself is incomplete or discloses some
defense that would bar recovery. (Guardian North Bay, Inc. v. Superior Court
(2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 963, 971-972.) The “face of the complaint” includes
material contained in attached exhibits that are incorporated by reference into
the complaint, or in a superseded complaint in the same action. (Frantz v.
Blackwell (1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 91, 94; see also Barnett v. Fireman’s
Fund Ins. Co. (2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 500, 505 [“[W]e rely on and accept as
true the contents of the exhibits and treat as surplusage the pleader’s
allegations as to the legal effect of the exhibits.”])
 
A
demurrer can only be sustained when it disposes of an entire pleading, cause of
action, or affirmative defense. (See Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1320, subd.
(a); Poizner v. Fremont General Corp. (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97, 119; Kong
v. City of Hawaiian Gardens Redev. Agency (2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 1028,
1046-1047.)
 
Meet
and Confer
 
            Per
Code of Civil Procedure section 439, subdivision (a), the parties were required
to meet and confer telephonically or in person before bringing this motion for
judgment on the pleadings. (Code Civ. Proc., § 439, subd. (a).) The Court finds
the parties’ efforts to meet and confer sufficient. (O. Martin, Jr. Decl., ¶
3.)
 
ANALYSIS: 
 
Defendant
demurs to the Sixth Cause of Action for Intentional Infliction of Emotional
Distress on the grounds that the Complaint fails to allege facts sufficient to
constitute a cause of action.
 
Intentional
Infliction of Emotional Distress
 
To state a cause of action for
intentional infliction of emotional distress against a landlord, the plaintiff tenant
must allege facts demonstrating the defendant landlord engaged in, “’(1)
extreme and outrageous conduct by the defendant with the intention of causing,
or reckless disregard of the probability of causing, emotional distress; (2)
the plaintiff's suffering severe or extreme emotional distress; (3) and actual
and proximate causation of the emotional distress by the defendant's outrageous
conduct. [Citations.]’ [Citation.]” (Burnett v. Chimney Sweep
(2004) 123 Cal.App.4th 1057, 1068-1069 (Burnett).)
 
Extreme and Outrageous Conduct
“Whether a defendant's conduct can reasonably
be found to be outrageous is a question of law that must initially be
determined by the court; if reasonable persons may differ, it is for the jury
to determine whether the conduct was, in fact, outrageous. [Citation.]” (Berkley v. Dowds (2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 518, 534; but
see Berry v. Frazier (2023) 90 Cal.App.5th 1258, 1273 (Berry) [“’[W]hether
conduct is ‘outrageous’ is usually a question of fact.’ [Citation.]”)


Defendant contends the Complaint fails to
allege facts demonstrating extreme and outrageous conduct. Defendant argues the
allegations only set forth a negligence claim where Plaintiffs are alleging the
subject property was not properly maintained, and do not reference any specific
practices or maintenance by Defendant or allege any facts that Defendant
exceeded all bounds of human decency. In opposition, Plaintiffs contend whether
the conduct was extreme and outrageous is a question of fact not amenable to demurrer.
Plaintiffs then recite the allegations regarding Defendant’s alleged failures
to repair and properly maintain the subject property, despite Plaintiffs’
requests.
 
The Court agrees with Plaintiffs. While the Court agrees
Plaintiffs primarily allege a failure to maintain the premises in an
uninhabitable condition, whether Defendant’s alleged failures to repair and
properly maintain the subject property in a habitable condition constitutes
extreme and outrageous conduct is generally a question of fact. (Burnett,
supra, 123 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1068-1069.) The Complaint amply alleges
habitability issues that Defendant failed to correct despite multiple requests.
(Compl., ¶¶ 34, 47, 51, 59, 63, 68.) Accordingly, the Court declines to sustain
the demurrer for failure to allege extreme and outrageous conduct.
 
Intent
or Reckless Disregard
 
The allegedly outrageous conduct must
have been, “directed at the plaintiff, or occur in the presence of
the plaintiff of whom the defendant is aware. The requirement that
the defendant's conduct be directed primarily at the plaintiff is a factor
which distinguishes intentional infliction of emotional distress from the
negligent infliction of such injury.” (Berry, supra, 90 Cal.App.5th at p. 1273, italics in original, internal quotation
marks and citations omitted.)
 
Defendant contends the Complaint fails to allege facts
demonstrating that Defendant was aware of the alleged issues on the subject
property which harmed Plaintiffs such that some of the Plaintiffs had to seek
medical attention. Defendants contend the Complaint is otherwise conclusory and
devoid of factual support. In opposition, Plaintiffs contend Defendant ignores the
Plaintiffs’ multiple complaints about the conditions they faced and that
Defendant then began to harass the Plaintiffs and threaten them with evictions
or retaliation. Plaintiffs also note that they complained to the County of Los
Angeles Department of Health and the City of Los Angeles Department of Housing,
which resulted in Defendant being issued citations.
 
The Court finds the Complaint alleges sufficient facts
demonstrating Defendant acted intentionally or with reckless disregard toward
Plaintiffs. The Complaint alleges that Plaintiffs complained to Defendant on
multiple occasions regarding the conditions of the subject property, but
Defendant did not fix the problems. (Compl., ¶¶ 34, 47, 51, 59, 63, 68.) The
Court finds this sufficient to demonstrate that Defendant was allegedly aware
of the problems affecting Plaintiffs and failed to fix those problems. (See Stoiber
v. Honeychuck (1980) 101 Cal.App.3d 903, 921-922.) It can be inferred from
these allegations that Defendant knowingly refused to fix the problem, knowing
that it was adversely affecting Plaintiffs. Thus, the Court declines to sustain
the demurrer on this ground.
 
Damages
 
Defendant contends the Complaint fails to allege sufficient facts
demonstrating damages. Defendant contends Plaintiffs fail to allege sufficient
facts demonstrating their damages, and instead only allege in general terms the
harms they allegedly suffered. In opposition, Plaintiffs contend they have
provided sufficient details stating their damages, discussing the extent of the
conditions they were living in at the subject property and listing the
emotional harms suffered.
 
The Court finds the Complaint fails to allege sufficient facts
demonstrating Plaintiffs’ alleged damages. (See Pitman v. Oakland (1988)
197 Cal.App.3d 1037, 1047-1048 [complaint must allege facts demonstrating, “the
nature or extent of any mental suffering incurred as a result of the
defendant's alleged outrageous conduct,”; it is not enough to just allege having
suffered emotional distress].) The Complaint alleges in a conclusory fashion
that Plaintiffs suffered various forms of emotional distress, but otherwise
fail to allege facts demonstrating the extent of that distress. (Compl., ¶¶ 29,
35, 48-49, 59, 68, 83, 91, 101, 109, 116.)  
 
            Based on the foregoing, the Court
SUSTAINS the demurrer to the Sixth Cause of Action for Intentional Infliction
of Emotional Distress with leave to amend.
 
LEGAL
STANDARD – Motion to Strike
 
            “Any party, within the time allowed to
respond to a pleading may serve and file a notice of motion to strike the whole
or any part thereof, but this time limitation shall not apply to motions
specified in subdivision (e).” (Code Civ. Proc., § 435, subd. (b)(2).)
“The court may, upon a motion made pursuant to Section 435, or at any time in
its discretion, and upon terms it deems proper: (a) Strike out any
irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading. (b) Strike out all or any
part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of
this state, a court rule, or an order of the court.” (Id., § 436.)
 
DISCUSSION
 
Meet
and Confer
 
Per
Code of Civil Procedure section 435.5, subdivision (a), Defendant was required
to meet and confer in person, by telephone, or by video conference with
Plaintiffs before bringing this motion to strike. (Code Civ. Proc., § 435.5,
subd. (a).) The Court finds the
parties’ efforts to meet and confer sufficient. (O. Martin, Jr. Decl., ¶ 3.)
 
Analysis
 
In
light of the Court sustaining the Demurrer with leave to amend, the Court
DENIES the motion to strike as moot. 
 
Conclusion:

 
            For
the foregoing reasons, the Court decides the pending motion as follows: 
            
Defendant
Equity Residential Management, LLC’s Demurrer is SUSTAINED as to the Sixth
Cause of Action with 20 days’ leave to amend.
 
Defendant
Equity Residential Management, LLC’s Motion to Strike Portions of Plaintiffs’
Complaint is DENIED as moot.
 
Defendant
is to give notice.
