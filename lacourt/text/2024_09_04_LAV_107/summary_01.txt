Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled on several motions in this case. First, the defendant demurred to the sixth cause of action, alleging that the complaint fails to state a cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress. The judge disagreed, finding that the complaint alleges sufficient facts to demonstrate the defendant's alleged failures to repair and maintain the property, despite multiple requests from the plaintiffs.

The judge also denied the defendant's motion to strike portions of the complaint as moot, as the defendant's demurrer was sustained with leave to amend.

The judge noted that the parties had a meet and confer, as required by law, and found that the parties' efforts were sufficient.

The judge cited various case law to support their decision, including cases on demurrers, motions to strike, and intentional infliction of emotional distress.

The judge gave notice to the defendant to give notice of the ruling.
