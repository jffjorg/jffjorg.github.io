And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the plaintiff's request for entry of default judgment without prejudice. The plaintiff, Vanessa E. Garcia, is seeking damages of $107,559.30, including $6,902.00 in special damages, $100,000.00 in general damages, $0.00 in interest, $0.00 in attorney fees, and $657.30 in costs. However, the Judge finds several problems with the plaintiff's request. First, the plaintiff did not submit a copy of the statement of damages served on the defendant. Second, the plaintiff's request for $100,000.00 in general damages is excessive. Third, the plaintiff's evidence of future pain and suffering is insufficient. Fourth, the damages cannot be jointly and severally allocated between the defendants because one of the defendants is limited to $15,000.00 in damages. Finally, the plaintiff did not dismiss the Doe defendants. Based on these findings, the Judge is denying the plaintiff's request for entry of default judgment.
