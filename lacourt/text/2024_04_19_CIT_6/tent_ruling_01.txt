  Case Number:  23PSCV00876    Hearing Date:   April 19, 2024    Dept:  6 Plaintiff  Vanessa E. Garcia’s Request for Entry of Default Judgment  Defendants: Roman Aguilar, Marian Hardy  TENTATIVE RULING              Plaintiff’s  request for entry of default judgment is DENIED without prejudice.            BACKGROUND                        This  is a personal injury action. On March 24, 2023, plaintiff Vanessa E. Garcia (Plaintiff)  filed this action against defendants Roman Aguilar (Aguilar), Marian Hardy  (Hardy) (collectively, Defendants), and Does 1 through 20, alleging one cause  of action for negligence. On December 7, 2023, default was entered against  Defendants. On March 18, 2024, Plaintiff filed a request for entry of default  judgment against Defendants.            LEGAL  STANDARD  Code of  Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a party  has failed to timely respond or appear. (Code Civ. Proc., § 585.) A party  seeking judgment on the default by the court must file a Request for Court  Judgment, and: (1) a brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other  admissible evidence in support of the judgment requested; (3) interest  computations as necessary; (4) a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) a declaration of nonmilitary status; (6) a  proposed form of judgment; (7) a dismissal of all parties against whom judgment  is not sought or an application for separate judgment under Code of Civil  Procedure section 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment; (8)  exhibits as necessary; and (9) a request for attorneys’ fees if allowed by  statute or by the agreement of the parties. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1800.)  ANALYSIS  Plaintiff  seeks default judgment against Defendants in the total amount of $107,559.30,  including $6,902.00 in special damages, $100,000.00 in general damages, $0.00  in interest, $0.00 in attorney fees, and $657.30 in costs. The Court finds a  few problems with Plaintiff’s request for entry of default judgment. First, Plaintiff  did not submit a copy of the Statement of Damages served on Defendant. The  Court may not grant relief in a default judgment that exceeds the relief  demanded in the complaint or statement of damages. (Code Civ. Proc., §§  580(a)-(c); Paterra v. Hansen (2021) 64 Cal.App.5th 507, 536; Greenup  v. Rodman (1986) 42 Cal.3d 822, 826.) Second, Plaintiff’s request for  $100,000.00 in general damages is almost 14 ½ times Plaintiff’s special damages  request of $6,902.00. Thus, the Court finds Plaintiff’s general damage request excessive.  The Court also finds that Plaintiff’s proffered evidence of future pain and  suffering contains very little information to support the request for general  damages, instead only stating that Plaintiff has some anxiety. (Garcia Decl., p.  4.) Based on the evidence submitted, the Court finds $20,000.00 as fair and reasonable  general damages for Plaintiff’s pain and suffering. Third, the damages cannot  be jointly and severally allocated between the Defendants because Defendant  Aguilar, as the owner of the subject vehicle, is limited to $15,000.00 in damages.  (Vehicle Code, §§ 17150, 17151; Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1800, subd.  (a)(7).)  Fourth, the  declaration of Joshua Reyes provides little information for the Court to assess  whether he has personal knowledge to authenticate and lay the foundation for  the exhibits attached to his declaration. (Evid. Code, § 702; Johnson v.  Stanhiser (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 357, 361-362 [while a default admits the  material allegations of the complaint, the plaintiff must still present  evidence to establish prima facie case].) Fifth, Plaintiff did not dismiss the  Doe defendants. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1800, subd. (a)(7).)  CONCLUSION                        Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s request  for entry of default judgment is DENIED without prejudice.
