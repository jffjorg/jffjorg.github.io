   [1] Plaintiff’s  amended supplemental brief requests $3,315.00 in sanctions. (Plaintiff’s  Amended Suppl. Brief, 2:16-19.) The Court relies on the amount set forth in the  original notice of motion since that complies with Code of Civil Procedure  section 2023.040. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.040.)
