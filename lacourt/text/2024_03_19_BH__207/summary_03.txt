Here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The Court grants the Motion to be Relieved as Counsel, filed by Thomas D. Sands, counsel for Cross-Defendant Jafiel Drinkwater. The motion is substantively proper as it is filed due to a severe breakdown in the attorney-client relationship, substantial conflict between the attorney and client, and the client's decline to sign a substitution of attorney form. The motion is procedurally proper as the necessary forms and proofs of service have been filed. Counsel must serve the signed order on the client and all other parties who have appeared in the action, and file a proof of service within 10 days of the date of this order. Counsel will remain the attorney of record until the proof of service is filed.
