MOTION
 
Plaintiff De Park Avenue 1100, LLC (“Plaintiff”) brought suit against
Defendant Tavistock Restaurants, LLC (“Defendant”) for breach of lease.  Defendant now demurs to the complaint on the
grounds that it fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of
action, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 430.10, subdivision
(e).  
 
Plaintiff opposes the demurrer and Defendant replies.  
 
REQUESTS
FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE
 
            Defendant’s Request
 
            Defendant requests judicial notice
of (1) the January 26, 2023 Certificate of Cancellation from the Delaware
Secretary of State issued to Tavistock and (2) the laws of the State of
Delaware cited in Defendant’s demurrer to Plaintiff’s complaint.[1]
 
Official notices, statements, and certificates made by a Secretary of
State are properly the subject of judicial notice as documents reflecting
official acts of a state’s executive department, pursuant to Evidence Code
section 452, subdivision (c).  (See
generally Friends of Shingle Springs Interchange, Inc. v. County of El
Dorado (2011) 200 Cal.App.4th 1470, 1483–1484.)
However,
“materials prepared by private parties and merely on file with the state
agencies” may not be properly judicially noticed as an official act of a
legislative, executive, or judicial department of the United States or any
state of the United States.  (People
v. Thacker (1985) 175 Cal.App.3d 594, 598.)
 
            Here, the Certificate of
Cancellation represents an official act of Delaware’s executive department.  As such, the Court takes judicial notice of
it.
 
            Moreover, the Court may take
judicial notice of “The decisional, constitutional, and statutory law of any
state of the United States […]”  (Evid.,
§ 452, subd. (a).)  Therefore, the Court
similarly takes judicial notice of the Delaware laws cited in Defendant’s
demurrer.
 
            Plaintiff’s Request
 
            Plaintiff requests the Court to take
judicial notice of the following:
 
1. Tavistock Restaurants LLC’s Limited Liability
Company Application for Registration, filed with the California Secretary of
State on October 24, 2003, File No. 200330010210. 
 
2. Tavistock Restaurants LLC’s Certificate of
Cancellation – LLC Termination, filed with the California Secretary of State on
January 25, 2023, File No. BA20230139269. 
 
3. 6 Del. C. § 18-203 of Delaware’s LLC Act. 
 
4. 6 Del. C. § 18-804 of Delaware’s LLC Act. 
 
5. 6 Del. C. § 1-201 of Delaware’s Uniform
Commercial Code. 
 
6. In re Reinz Wis. Gasket, LLC, 2023 Del.
Ch. LEXIS 69 (Del. Mar. 20, 2023). 
 
7. Metro Commun. Corp. BVI v. Advanced
Mobilecomm Tech. Inc., 854 A.2d 121, 139 (Ch. 2004). 
 
8. Capone v. LDH Mgmt. Holdings LLC, 2018
Del. Ch. LEXIS 131 (Del. Apr. 25, 2018). 
 
9. 6 Del. C. § 18-803 of Delaware’s LLC Act. 
 
10. 6 Del. C. § 18-805 of Delaware’s LLC Act. 
 
11. In re Tex. Eastern Overseas, Inc.,
2009 Del. Ch. LEXIS 198 (Del. Nov. 30, 2009). 
 
            Regarding the first two requests,
“materials prepared by private parties and merely on file with the state
agencies” may not be properly judicially noticed as an official act of a
legislative, executive, or judicial department of the United States or any
state of the United States.  (People
v. Thacker (1985) 175 Cal.App.3d 594, 598.) 
However, public corporate filings may be judicially noticed as “[f]acts
and propositions that are not reasonably subject to dispute and are capable of
immediate and accurate determination by resort to sources of reasonably
indisputable accuracy” pursuant to Evidence Code section 452, subdivision
(h).  (See, e.g., Apple Inc. v.
Superior Court (2017) 18 Cal.App.5th 222, 242.)  Therefore, the Court takes judicial notice of
the first two documents.
 
As for the remaining requests,
judicial notice may be taken of “[t]he decisional, constitutional, and
statutory law of any state of the United States[;]” of “[o]fficial acts of the
legislative, executive, and judicial departments of the United States and of
any state of the United States[;]” and of “[r]ecords of […] any court of record
of the United States or of any state of the United States.” (Evid., § 452,
subd. (a), (c), and (d)(2).)  Therefore,
the Court similarly takes judicial notice of the statutory and decisional case
law.
 
The Court overrules
Defendant’s objections to Plaintiff’s Request for Judicial Notice.
 
ANALYSIS
 
1.      DEMURRER
 
“It is black letter law that a demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of
the allegations in a complaint.”  (Lewis v. Safeway, Inc. (2015)
235 Cal.App.4th 385, 388.)  In testing the sufficiency of a cause of
action, a court accepts “[a]s true all material facts properly pled and matters
which may be judicially noticed but disregard contentions, deductions or
conclusions of fact or law.  [A court
also gives] the complaint a reasonable interpretation, reading it as a whole
and its parts in their context.”  (290
Division (EAT), LLC v. City & County of San Francisco (2022) 86
Cal.App.5th 439, 450 [cleaned up]; Hacker v. Homeward Residential, Inc.
(2018) 26 Cal.App.5th 270, 280 [“in considering the merits of a demurrer,
however, “the facts alleged in the pleading are deemed to be true, however
improbable they may be”].)
 
Further, in ruling on a demurrer, a court must “liberally construe”
the allegations of the complaint “with a view to substantial justice between
the parties.”  (See Code Civ. Proc., §
452.)  “This rule of liberal construction
means that the reviewing court draws inferences favorable to the plaintiff, not
the defendant.”  (Perez v. Golden Empire Transit Dist. (2012) 209
Cal.App.4th 1228, 1238.)   
 
In summary, “[d]etermining whether the complaint is sufficient as
against the demurrer on the ground that it does not state facts sufficient to
constitute a cause of action, the rule is that if one consideration of all the
facts stated it appears the plaintiff is entitled to any relief at the hands of
the court against the defendants the complaint will be held good although the
facts may not be clearly stated, or may be intermingled with a statement of
other facts irrelevant to the cause of action shown, or although the plaintiff
may demand relief to which he is not entitled under the facts alleged.”  (Gressley v. Williams (1961) 193
Cal.App.2d 636, 639.)
 
Defendant, a Delaware Limited
Liability Company, argues that it lacks capacity to be sued because it
cancelled its LLC registration in late January 2023, a little over a month
before Plaintiff brought suit in March of 2023. 

 
Plaintiff argues in opposition
that (1) Defendant’s cancellation may have been improper under Delaware law,
which requires Defendant to set aside money to pay forthcoming claims; and (2) by
virtue of its California registration and the terms of the lease agreement at
issue, Defendant is subject to California law, which permits claims to be
brought after cancellation (see Corporations Code section 17707.06).
 
Defendant counters in reply
that (1) only Delaware courts have authority to determine whether the wind-up
was improper (Colaco v. Cavotec SA (2018) 25 Cal.App.5th 1172, 1189,
1194 [“The internal affairs doctrine is a conflict of laws principle which
recognizes that only one State should have the authority to regulate a
corporation’s internal affairs” &  dissolution
matters are “quintessential internal governance issues”]); (2) Defendant’s
wind-up was not improper in any event because Defendant did not have money to
set aside for Plaintiff’s claims; and (3) California’s survival statutes do not
apply to foreign entities, like Defendant (Greb v. Diamond Internat. Corp. (2013)
56 Cal.4th 243, 264-265).
 
Delaware law provides:
 
Upon
dissolution of a limited liability company and until the filing of a
certificate of cancellation as provided in § 18-203 of this title, the persons
winding up the limited liability company's affairs may, in the name of, and for
and on behalf of, the limited liability company, prosecute and defend suits,
whether civil, criminal or administrative, gradually settle and close the
limited liability company's business, dispose of and convey the limited
liability company's property, discharge or make reasonable provision for the
limited liability company's liabilities, and distribute to the members any
remaining assets of the limited liability company, all without affecting the
liability of members and managers and without imposing liability on a
liquidating trustee.
 
(Del. Code Ann. tit. 6, § 18-803.)
 
            Thus,
upon the filing of the Delaware cancellation, Defendant lost the ability to
defend against lawsuits.  While Plaintiff
has provided an argument that Defendant’s dissolution and wind-up may have been
improper, unless and until a Delaware court unwinds and reinstates Defendant’s
LLC status, Defendant lacks the capacity to be sued.  California’s survival statutes cannot revive
Defendant’s capacity to be sued once Defendant has been dissolved in Delaware.
 
Accordingly, the Court sustains
Defendant’s demurrer.
 
2.     
LEAVE TO AMEND
 
A plaintiff has the burden of showing in what
manner the complaint could be amended and how the amendment would change the
legal effect of the complaint, i.e., state a cause of action. (See The
Inland Oversight Committee v. City of San Bernardino (2018) 27 Cal.App.5th
771, 779; PGA West Residential Assn., Inc. v. Hulven Int'l, Inc. (2017)
14 Cal.App.5th 156, 189.) A plaintiff must not only state the legal basis for
the amendment, but also the factual allegations sufficient to state a cause of
action or claim. (See PGA West Residential Assn., Inc. v. Hulven Int'l, Inc.,
supra, 14 Cal.App.5th at p. 189.) Moreover, a plaintiff does not meet his
or her burden by merely stating in the opposition to a demurrer or motion to
strike that “if the Court finds the operative complaint deficient, plaintiff
respectfully requests leave to amend.” (See Major Clients Agency v. Diemer
(1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 1116, 1133; Graham v. Bank of America (2014) 226
Cal.App.4th 594, 618 [asserting an abstract right to amend does not satisfy the
burden].)
 
Here, Plaintiff argues that leave to amend should be granted to
permit Plaintiff to provide additional facts regarding Defendant’s failure to
abide by Delaware law in dissolving and winding up.  However, this Court lacks authority to
nullify Defendant’s Delaware cancellation by virtue of the Internal Affairs
Doctrine.  As such, Plaintiff has not
identified any additional facts it could add to cure the deficiencies
identified.  
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
For the reasons stated, the Court sustains Defendant’s Demurrer to the
Complaint without leave to amend.  
 
The Clerk of the Court shall provide notice of the Court’s ruling.
