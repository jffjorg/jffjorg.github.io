And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is regarding a motion to fix the amount of prejudgment interest in a case between Innerspin Marketing, LLC (Plaintiff) and Consequent Capital Management (Defendant). The Plaintiff seeks to fix the amount of prejudgment interest at 10% annual interest rate on the outstanding balances of 26 invoices, which were transmitted between July 2017 and March 2021. The Defendant opposes the motion, arguing that the issue of prejudgment interest was waived, and that the interest rate should be capped at 7%. The Judge agrees with the Defendant, finding that the 10% interest rate applicable to breach of contract does not apply, and that the default 7% interest rate applies. The Judge also disagrees with the Plaintiff's calculation of dates interest began, finding that each invoice indicates that the amount payable is "Due Upon Receipt", and therefore the Plaintiff appropriately calculated interest from the date of each invoice. The Judge denies the Plaintiff's request to fix the prejudgment interest without prejudice, and orders the Plaintiff to resubmit a request in conformance with this order.
