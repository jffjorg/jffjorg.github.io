And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion filed by Larry A. Rothstein, who seeks to be relieved as counsel for the defendant, Vision Construction Group, Inc. The motion is based on an irreconcilable breakdown in the attorney-client relationship. The judge finds that no prejudice will result from granting the motion and intends to grant it. However, the judge notes that the proposed order filed by Rothstein is incomplete due to missing phone number and affords him one more opportunity to file a completed proposed order. The hearing is continued to a later date, pending the filing of the completed proposed order or Rothstein's provision of the phone number in court.
