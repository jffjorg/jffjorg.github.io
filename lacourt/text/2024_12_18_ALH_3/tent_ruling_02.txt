I.           
INTRODUCTION  
On November 22, 2024, plaintiff Mario Garcia (“Plaintiff”) filed
an ex parte application for leave to file a Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”).
The application was denied but the Court ordered Plaintiff to file a noticed
motion and specially set the motion for hearing on December 18, 2024. Plaintiff
filed said motion on November 25, 2024. 
On December 3, 2024, defendants Joanna
Esquivel (“Esquivel”), Juan Molina (“Molina”), and Maria De Jesus Meza
Hernandez (“Hernandez”) filed an opposition brief. On December 5, 2024,
defendant Jennifer Soyohn Suh (“Suh”) filed an opposition brief. 
No reply brief is on file. 
II.         
LEGAL
STANDARD
The court may, in its discretion and
after notice to the adverse party, allow, upon any terms as may be just, an
amendment to any pleading, including adding or striking out the name of any
party, or correcting a mistake in the name of a party, or a mistake in any
other respect. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (a)(1).) “Public policy dictates
that leave to amend be liberally granted.” (Centex
Homes v. St. Paul Fire & Marine Ins. Co. (2015) 237 Cal.App.4th 23,
32.) “Although courts are bound to apply a policy of great liberality in
permitting amendments to the complaint at any stage of the proceedings, up to
and including trial . . . this policy should be applied only ‘where no
prejudice is shown to the adverse party.’ [Citation]. A different result is
indicated ‘where inexcusable delay and probable prejudice to the opposing
party’ is shown. [Citation.]” (Magpali v.
Farmers Group, Inc. (1996) 47 Cal.App.4th 471, 487.)
A motion to amend a pleading must
include a copy of the proposed amendment or amended pleading which must be
serially numbered to differentiate it from previous pleadings or amendments and
must state what allegations in the previous pleading are proposed to be deleted
or added, if any, and where, by page, paragraph, and line number, the
allegations are located.  (Cal. Rules of
Court, Rule 3.1324(a).) The motion shall also be accompanied by a declaration
attesting to the effect of the amendment, why the amendment is necessary and
proper, when the facts giving rise to the amended allegations were discovered,
and why the request for amendment was not made earlier. (Cal. Rules of Court,
Rule 1.324(b).)
III.       
DISCUSSION
Plaintiff’s proposed SAC includes
causes of action for: (1) breach of a settlement agreement entered into between
Plaintiff and Suh, (2) promissory estoppel, and (3) fraud. Plaintiff also seeks
to add United Financial Casualty Company, Progressive Commercial Casualty
Company, and Progressive Group of Insurance as defendants. Plaintiff argues
that the motion is timely because up through November 18, 2024, Plaintiff and
counsel “held a good faith, reasonable belief that a settlement agreement had
been reached between Defendants and [Plaintiff].” (Motion, p. 8; Shtofman
Decl., ¶¶ 9-10.) Plaintiff argues that the SAC is necessary to enforce his
settlement agreement with Suh. 
Esquivel, Molina, Hernandez, and Suh
(collectively, “Defendants”) oppose the motion for leave to amend on the same
substantive grounds, albeit in separate briefs. First, Defendants argue that the
new defendants and additional causes of action will cause significant delay to
trial, currently scheduled for January 13, 2025. The defendants also point out
that the proposed pleading is prejudicial because the scope of this case will
be expanded to include claims and parties that are completely unrelated to the
underlying motor vehicle accident. They further observe that the purported
conflict precipitating Plaintiff’s belated request for amendment appears to
stem from Plaintiff’s refusal to acknowledge the rights of statutory lienholders
and dismiss Suh from the action. These arguments are all well-taken. 
Plaintiff did not file a brief
responding to any of the arguments raised in the two opposition briefs and the
Court construes Plaintiff’s silence as conceding the merits of Defendants’
arguments. denies the motion for leave to file the SAC. 
IV.       
CONCLUSION
Plaintiff’s motion is DENIED. 
Moving party to give notice.

I.           
INTRODUCTION
On November 12, 2024, defendant
Jennifer S. Suh (“Defendant”) filed this unopposed motion to interplead
settlement funds of $100,000 after reaching a settlement agreement with
plaintiff Mario Garcia (“Plaintiff”). This motion also seeks to: (1) discharge
Defendant from further liability to plaintiff Mario Garcia (“Plaintiff”, Robert
S. Shtofman, Paratus Partners LLC (“Paratus”), and Department of Health Care
Services (“DHC”), and (2) dismiss her from this action. The motion is made
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 386 and 386.5. 
II.         
LEGAL
STANDARD
“A defendant, against whom an action is
pending upon a contract, or for specific personal property, may, at any time
before answer, upon affidavit that a person not a party to the action makes
against him, and without any collusion with him, a demand upon such contract,
or for such property, upon notice to such person and the adverse party, apply
to the court for an order to substitute such person in his place, and discharge
him from liability to either party, on his depositing in court the amount
claimed on the contract, or delivering the property or its value to such person
as the court may direct; and the court may, in its discretion, make the order.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 386, subd. (a).) “Where the only relief sought against one
of the defendants is the payment of a stated amount of money alleged to be
wrongfully withheld, such defendant may, upon affidavit that he is a mere
stakeholder with no interest in the amount or any portion thereof and that
conflicting demands have been made upon him for the amount by parties to the
action, upon notice to such parties, apply to the court for an order
discharging him from liability and dismissing him from the action on his
depositing with the clerk of the court the amount in dispute and the court may,
in its discretion, make such order. (Code Civ. Proc., § 386.5.) Alternatively,
a defendant may file a verified cross-complaint in interpleader or an action in
interpleader, whenever conflicting claims are or may be made upon him, to
compel those claimants to litigate their several claims. (Code Civ. Proc., §
386, subd. (a)-(b).) 
III.       
DISCUSSION
Defendant states, and no other party
disputes, that she and Plaintiff have entered into a written settlement
agreement in which Plaintiff released all claims against Defendant’s insurer, in
exchange for $100,000 minus any statutory liens. (Motion, p. 3.) The settlement
agreement specifies that the amount made payable will be “less the amount of
[any] liens” and that no drafts will be issued until the written amounts of
statutory liens have been received. (Hill Decl., Ex. A.) The settlement
agreement also required Plaintiff to dismiss Defendant with prejudice and sign
a request for dismissal of the complaint. (Ibid.) Defendant also settled
with co-plaintiff, Leonardo Garcia, who filed a request for dismissal on July
31, 2024. 
Defendant states that Plaintiff has not
provided written notice of statutory liens to Defendant and that it has become
aware that Plaintiff’s lienholders, Paratus and DHCS, are asserting liens for
$146,165.90 and $30,138, respectively, exceeding the settlement funds of
$100,000. Defendant also claims that Plaintiff’s counsel, Mr. Shtofman, has
demanded that $40,000 of the settlement be paid directly to him. As a result,
there are four competing claims to the settlement funds, namely, from
Plaintiff, Paratus, DHCS, and Mr. Shtofman. 
Interpleader would typically be appropriate
in these factual circumstances. However, Defendant’s motion is a procedural
oddity not authorized by sections 386 or 386.5 because the action pending
against Defendant is not one “upon a contract” for the settlement funds, but
for Plaintiff’s personal injuries; therefore, the potential claimants cannot be
“substituted in” for Defendant in this action. (Code Civ. Proc., § 386, subd.
(a).) The relief sought against Defendant in this action is not the payment of
a stated amount of money alleged to be wrongfully withheld. (See Code
Civ. Proc., § 386.5.) Additionally, even if Defendant’s motion were
procedurally allowed, Defendant did not give notice to Paratus of this motion and
its intent to interplead the settlement funds. If Defendant feels the need to continue
with an interpleader action, Defendant may file a verified cross-complaint in
this action against all the claimants, or an original complaint in interpleader
naming the claimants, and then move for an order depositing the settlement
funds and discharging it from liability.
IV.       
CONCLUSION
Defendant’s motion is DENIED.
