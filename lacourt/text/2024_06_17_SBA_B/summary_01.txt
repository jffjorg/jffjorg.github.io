And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to stay the proceedings pending the decisions of the First Appellate District and the Second Appellate District. The defendant had requested a stay to await the outcome of the appellate court decisions, arguing that the decisions could render the case unactionable. The plaintiff had argued that there was no ground for a stay, as there was no judgment or appealable order in the case. The judge found that the defendant had not shown that the appellate court decisions were binding, and therefore denied the motion to stay without prejudice. The judge noted that the defendant can seek further relief if the appellate court publishes its decision and is thus binding on the case.
