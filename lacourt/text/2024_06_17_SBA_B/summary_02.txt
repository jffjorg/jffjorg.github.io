And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has considered the ex parte application for an order appointing a receiver and requiring reimbursements. The plaintiff, the City of Rancho Palos Verdes, requests that a receiver be appointed to oversee the rehabilitation of a property that has a malfunctioning septic system, resulting in raw sewage being discharged onto the property and adjacent areas. The court finds that the property owner has not been afforded a reasonable opportunity to correct the conditions cited in the notice of violation. The court also finds that the proposed receiver, Mark Adams of California Receivership Group, Inc., has demonstrated the capacity and expertise to develop and supervise a viable financial and construction plan for the satisfactory rehabilitation of the property. The court orders the ex parte application to be either continued for a short period of time to allow the petitioner to provide evidence of compliance with the statute, or denied without prejudice if the petitioner cannot provide such evidence.
