 Case Number:  KC070042    Hearing Date:   April 25, 2024    Dept:  6 CASE  NAME:  Bharat  Patel, et al. v. Dr. Prakash Patel  Plaintiffs’  Motion for Attorneys’ Fees Award and Prejudgment Interest  TENTATIVE  RULING The Court  GRANTS in part and DENIES in part the motion for attorneys’ fees and  prejudgment interest. The Court GRANTS Plaintiffs’ motion for attorneys’ fees  in the reduced amount of $247,485.00.  The Court DENIES Plaintiffs’ motion for prejudgment interest.              Plaintiffs are ordered to submit an amended Judgment and to give notice of the Court's ruling within five calendar days of the Court's order. BACKGROUND  This is a real property dispute. On February 14, 2018, Plaintiffs Bharat  Patel (Bharat) and Dinesh Patel (Dinesh) (collectively, Plaintiffs) filed this  action (KC070042) against Dr. Prakash Patel and Does 1 through 10, alleging  causes of action for breach of settlement agreement and fraud. On March 16,  2020, Prakash Patel (Prakash) and Hardika Patel (Hardika) (collectively,  Defendants) filed a separate action (20STCV10801) against Bharat Patel, Dinesh  Patel, and Does 1 through 100, alleging causes of action for voiding and  rescission of first settlement agreement, voiding and rescission of second  settlement agreement, voiding and rescission of third settlement agreement,  fraud (misrepresentation), fraud (false promise), fraud (concealment),  negligent misrepresentation, voiding and rescission of first settlement  agreement (fraud), voiding and rescission of second settlement agreement  (fraud), and voiding and rescission of third settlement agreement (fraud). The  actions were later consolidated on June 23, 2020, with KC070042 being  designated as the lead case.  On July 27, 2020, Bharat and Dinesh filed a cross-complaint  against Prakash and Hardika. The current and only operative pleading is the  Second Amended Cross-Complaint, filed on March 13, 2023, which alleges causes  of action for breach of settlement agreement, fraud (misrepresentation), fraud  (concealment), conspiracy to commit fraud, and declaratory relief.  On October 10, 2022, the Court entered summary judgment in favor  of Bharat and Dinesh on Prakash and Hardika’s complaint.  On January 19, 2024, after a four-day non-jury trial, concurrent  with a jury trial, the Court issued a statement of decision in favor of Plaintiffs  on the operative Second Amended Cross-Complaint.  On March 20, 2024, Plaintiffs moved for an award of attorneys’  fees and prejudgment interest. On April 12, 2024, Defendants opposed the  motion. On April 18, 2024, Plaintiffs replied.  LEGAL STANDARD  In  any action on a contract, where the contract specifically provides that  attorney's fees and costs, which are incurred to enforce that contract, shall  be awarded either to one of the parties or to the prevailing party, then the  party who is determined to be the party prevailing on the contract, whether he  or she is the party specified in the contract or not, shall be entitled to  reasonable attorney's fees in addition to other costs.  (Civ. Code, §  1717, subd. (a).)  The  party seeking fees and costs bears the burden to show "the fees incurred  were allowable, were reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation, and  were reasonable in amount." (Nightingale v. Hyundai Motor America  (1994) 31 Cal.App.4th 99, 104.) To satisfy this burden, evidence and  descriptions of billable tasks must be presented in sufficient detail, enabling  the court to evaluate whether the case was overstaffed, the time attorneys  spent on specific claims, and the reasonableness of the hours expended. (Lunada  Biomedical v. Nunez (2014) 230 Cal.App.4th 459, 486-487.)  “A  trial court assessing attorney fees begins with a touchstone or lodestar  figure, based on the ‘careful compilation of the time spent and reasonable  hourly compensation of each attorney… involved in the presentation of the  case.” (Christian Research Institute v. Alnor (2008) 165 Cal.App.4th  1315, 1321.) “The reasonableness of attorney fees is within the discretion of  the trial court, to be determined from a consideration of such factors as the  nature of the litigation, the complexity of the issues, the experience and  expertise of counsel and the amount of time involved. [Citation.] The court may  also consider whether the amount requested is based upon unnecessary or  duplicative work. [Citation.]” (Wilkerson v. Sullivan (2002) 99  Cal.App.4th 443, 448.)  “The courts repeatedly have stated that the trial court  is in the best position to value the services rendered by the attorneys in his  or her courtroom [citation], and this includes the determination of the hourly  rate that will be used in the lodestar calculus. [Citation.]” (569 E. Cnty.  Boulevard LLC v. Backcountry Against the Dump, Inc. (2016) 6 Cal.App.5th  426, 436–437.)  REQUESTS FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE              The Court GRANTS  Defendants’ requests for judicial notice as to Exhibits A, B, D and E. (Evid. Code §  452, subd. (d).) However, the Court takes judicial  notice of the foregoing documents only as to “the existence, content and  authenticity of public records and other specified documents”; it does not take  judicial notice of the truth of the factual matters asserted in those  documents. (Dominguez v. Bonta (2022) 87 Cal. App. 5th 389, 400.)  The Court DENIES Defendants’ requests for judicial notice as to Exhibit C.  DISCUSSION  Summary of Arguments  Plaintiffs seek $402,175.00 in attorneys’ fees and  $655,994.88 in prejudgment interest. Plaintiffs contend they are the prevailing  party for purposes of Civil Code section 1717, subdivision (a), as they were  awarded specific performance under the Settlement Agreement (as defined in the  moving papers). Plaintiffs indicate that they seek attorneys’ fees at the rates  of $650.00 per hour for their prior attorney, Kevin Lacey, and $500.00 per hour  for their current attorney, Roy Manukyan. Plaintiffs note that although their  attorneys charged them only $350.00 per hour throughout this litigation, that  was a discounted rate due to their longstanding relationship with Mr. Lacey.  Plaintiffs contend their requested rates are reasonable due to their attorneys’  respective amount of experience, with Mr. Lacey having practiced for 30 years  before retiring and Mr. Manukyan having been out of law school for 7 years.  Plaintiffs also contend the amount of hours billed are reasonable due to this  having been a hard-fought case.  Plaintiffs further contend they are entitled to  prejudgment interest due to their having been deprived of $1,558,851.67 they  lent to Defendant Prakash, in which they were to be repaid through the  acquisition of real property, and which was to be transferred in February 2020.  Plaintiffs contend they are entitled to prejudgment interest at the rate of 10%  from February 10, 2020 to the present for that loan. Plaintiffs contend an  award of prejudgment interest is mandatory, the amount due is easily  calculable, and they are entitled to prejudgment interest from February 10,  2020. Plaintiffs also contend that if the Court concludes prejudgment interest  is not mandatory, it may still award such interest in its discretion.  In opposition, Defendants contend the fees should be  reduced to $350.00 per hour for a total of $240,965.00. Defendants contend  Plaintiffs fail to show that the $650.00 and $500.00 rates they request are  market rates. Defendants contend Plaintiffs were not awarded complete relief,  and that a party needs to obtain “excellent results” to obtain a fully  compensatory fee. Defendants then argue Plaintiffs should not be compensated  for time spent on unsuccessful claims, theories, or contentions. Defendants  contend two duplicative entries totaling $3,020.00 for work performed by Mr.  Lacey and Mr. Manukyan should be deleted. Defendants further contend Mr. Lacey  performed 17 hours’ worth of duplicative work equaling $5,950.00 that should be  subtracted from the total.  With respect to prejudgment interest, Defendants  contend Plaintiffs’ motion is too late, as requests for prejudgment interest  should be made before entry of judgment or by way of a motion for new trial on  the ground of inadequate damages. Defendants also contend the request for  prejudgment interest is substantively defective because Plaintiffs prevailed on  an equitable claim for specific performances, and were not awarded any damages.  Defendants also argue it is not clear what loan Plaintiffs are referring to in  connection with this issue since the Settlement Agreement does not mention that  particular loan. Defendants further contend Plaintiffs waived their claim to  damages at trial.              Analysis – Attorney’s Fees  The Settlement Agreement provides for the recovery of  attorneys’ fees here. (Judgment (2/20/24), Ex. A, ¶ 15.) If a plaintiff obtains  relief that the plaintiff has requested on the contract claims in an action,  the plaintiff is the prevailing party on the contract as a matter of law. (Texas  Commerce Bank v. Garamendi (1994) 28 Cal.App.4th 1234, 1247; Smith v.  Krueger (1983) 150 Cal.App.3d 752, 757.) In this case, Plaintiffs prevailed  on their claim for specific performance of the Settlement Agreement. (Statement  of Decision (1/19/24).) Judgment was entered in Plaintiffs’ favor as to Plaintiffs’  claim on the contract. Thus, Plaintiffs are the prevailing party on the  contract. As the prevailing party on the contract, Plaintiffs are entitled to  attorney’s fees. (Civ. Code, § 1717, subd. (a); see Code Civ. Proc., § 1032,  subd. (a)(4).)              The  Court also finds that the reasonable hourly rate is $350.00. While Plaintiffs  correctly contend that the reasonable market rate need not be the actual rate  billed, (Syers Properties III, Inc. v. Rankin (2014) 226 Cal.App.4th  691, 701), the Court agrees with Defendants that Plaintiffs did not submit sufficient  evidence to substantiate the reasonableness of the hourly rates requested. (See  Lacey Decl., ¶ 7; see generally Manukyan Decl.) Typically, the reasonable  hourly rate used “is that prevailing in the community for similar work.” (Center  for Biological Diversity v. County of San Bernardino (2010) 188 Cal.App.4th  603, 616.) The burden is on the party seeking attorney fees to prove  reasonableness of the fees. (Id. at 615.) Plaintiffs have not met their  burden to show that hourly billing rates of $650.00 for Mr. Lacey and $500.00  for Mr. Manukyan are reasonable. Plaintiffs’ reliance on the Laffey Matrix is  not sufficient to justify the hourly rates sought above the actual rate billed.  Plaintiffs did not present evidence to show the market rate for experienced  attorneys in the Los Angeles area or in this local community. Plaintiffs only  submitted a declaration with the Reply stating what Mr. Manukyan believes his  billing rate was in 2017 as a first year associate at a law firm in an  unspecified location. Thus, the Court finds there is insufficient evidence to  support an hourly rate above the rate actually billed. The Court is familiar  generally with the local prevailing rates and concludes the rate of $350.00 per  hour is in line for similar work in this community. Accordingly, the Court will  award Plaintiffs the hourly rate actually incurred, i.e., $350.00.  Plaintiffs indicate that this consolidated case was hard  fought and their counsel filed or opposed and argued several motions for  summary judgment and tried the case before a jury. (Motion at p. 5:6-10.) Plaintiffs  submitted invoices and a summary of the invoices from their counsel and  contend the hours spent were reasonable and non-duplicative. (Motion at p. 5:9-10;  Lacey Decl., Ex. A; Manukyan Decl., Ex. D.) A  verified fee bill is prima facie evidence that the costs, expenses, and  services listed were reasonable. (Hadley v. Krepel (1985) 167 Cal.App.3d  677, 682). After reviewing the invoices and billing  summaries provided by Plaintiffs and considering the nature and extent of the  litigation, the Court finds that the hours billed are reasonable. The fact that Plaintiffs could not also recover the same  damages on the tort claims or did not prevail on their post-trial motion for  additional damages does not justify any reduction in the hours spent on this case.  The Court also declines to deduct the two entries from  May 2, 2022 and June 1, 2022 on Mr. Manukyan’s invoices, totaling $3020.00.  While they are lacking in description, it appears to the Court that they are  simply balances from Mr. Lacey’s invoices from the prior month carried over.  (Manukyan Decl., Ex. D, pp. 83, 85.) Moreover, those two amounts from Mr. Lacey’s  invoices are not included in the summary of hours billed by Mr. Manukyan for  those respective invoices, e.g. Invoice Nos. 2017 and 2015. (Manukyan Decl.,  Ex. E.) Additionally, contrary to Defendants contention, the Court does not  find the 17 hours Mr. Lacey performed to be duplicative of work performed by Mr.  Manukyan. Further, it is not uncommon to have a senior attorney like Mr. Lacey  review the work of a junior attorney like Mr. Manukyan.  Based on the foregoing, the Court GRANTS Plaintiffs’  motion for attorneys’ fees in the reduced amount of $247,485.00, i.e., 707.10  hours times $350.00 per hour.  Analysis – Prejudgment Interest  Contrary to Defendants’ contention, the Court finds that  Plaintiffs’ motion is timely because the Judgment specifically provided  Plaintiffs with the right to file a post-trial brief to recover prejudgment  interest. (Judgment (2/20/24), Ex. 1, ¶ 12.) Therefore, it does not matter that  Plaintiffs filed this motion after entry of the judgment. (Cf. N. Oakland Med. Clinic v. Rogers (1998) 65 Cal.App.4th  824, 830 [prejudgment interest denied where following a favorable jury verdict,  plaintiffs did not move for an award of prejudgment interest before entry of  judgment or at any of the post judgment proceedings which followed.]  Plaintiffs contend that an award of prejudgment interest  is mandatory under Civil Code section 3287(a). (Motion, p. 6:6-18.) The Court disagrees  and finds that Plaintiffs are not entitled to prejudgment interest. Civil Code  section 3287, subdivision (a) provides: "Every person who is entitled to  recover damages certain, or capable of being made certain by calculation, and  the right to recover which is vested in him upon a particular day, is entitled  also to recover interest thereon from that day . . . ." (Code Civ.  Proc., § 3287(a).) Here, Plaintiffs did not recover damages. Plaintiffs  sought and were awarded specific performance to enforce the Settlement Agreement. (See Minute Order (1/16/24); Minute Order (1/17/24);  Statement of Decision (1/19/24); Judgment (2/20/24).) The Settlement Agreement  does not provide for prejudgment interest; nor does it provide that Defendants  were to pay money to Plaintiffs, except in the event of an additional lien  amount owed to the IRS, which is not relevant here. (See Judgment (2/20/24, Ex.  1 ¶¶ 2, 3, 4, 5(i).) Indeed, the Settlement Agreement does not provide  Plaintiffs with the right to recover the approximately $1.5 million in loans upon  which Plaintiffs base their prejudgment interest claim. (See Judgment  (2/20/24), Ex. 1, Recitals and ¶¶ 1-5.) Rather, it entailed an agreement for  Prakash to sell the Bentley Way property to Plaintiffs for $1.9 million, subject to the Wells  Fargo and Amalgamated Bank loans, and to pay off some of  Prakash’s debts to Best Western and the IRS. (See Id., Ex. 1, ¶¶ 1-5.) Thus,  Plaintiffs were certainly not awarded any loan amount which formed the basis  for the Settlement Agreement. In fact, Plaintiffs were not awarded or entitled  to recover any damages, for which prejudgment interest could be awarded. Accordingly,  Plaintiffs are not entitled to prejudgment interest.  Plaintiffs also ask the Court to exercise its discretion  to award prejudgment interest under Civil Code section 3287(b). Civil Code  section 3287, subdivision (b) provides: “(b) Every person who is entitled under  any judgment to receive damages based upon a cause of action in contract where  the claim was unliquidated, may also recover interest thereon from a date prior  to the entry of judgment as the court may, in its discretion, fix, but in no  event earlier than the date the action was filed.” (Code Civ. Proc., ¶ 3287(b).)  The Court denies the motion on this ground as  well. As discussed above under subsection (a), Plaintiffs were not awarded any  damages and was only awarded specific performance to enforce the Settlement  Agreement. As discussed above, the Settlement Agreement does not provide for  payments to be made from Defendants to Plaintiffs. Thus, there is no damage  amount to which prejudgment interest could be awarded. The Court declines to  exercise any discretion based on equitable grounds to award prejudgment  interest based on Defendants' delay in performing under the Settlement  Agreement.  For all of the foregoing reasons, the Court DENIES  Plaintiffs’ motion for prejudgment interest.   CONCLUSION  The Court GRANTS in part and DENIES in part the motion for  attorneys’ fees and prejudgment interest. The Court GRANTS Plaintiffs’ motion  for attorneys’ fees in the reduced amount of $247,485.00. The Court DENIES Plaintiffs’ motion for  prejudgment interest.               Plaintiffs are ordered to submit an amended Judgment and to give  notice of the Court’s ruling within five calendar days of the Court’s order.
