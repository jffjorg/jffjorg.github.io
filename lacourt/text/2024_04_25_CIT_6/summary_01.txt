And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the motion to be relieved as plaintiff's counsel, Jay S. Bloom of Law Offices of Jay S. Bloom. The court finds that Counsel's health problems, including a stroke and ongoing medical treatment, make it unreasonable for Counsel to continue representing the plaintiff. The court notes that trial is currently scheduled for June 3, 2024, but grants the motion to allow Counsel to withdraw. The court vacates the trial date and sets a new status conference for May 20, 2024, allowing the plaintiff time to find new counsel or proceed as a self-represented litigant.
