And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the defendants' motion to compel arbitration, finding that the arbitration agreement signed by the plaintiff, Susana Ochoa, on August 9, 2021, is valid and binding. The defendants, 90210 Surgical Medical Center LLC, Benita Tapia, and Andrew Ball, had moved to compel arbitration based on the agreement, which was entered into as part of Ochoa's employment contract. The agreement covers any dispute arising out of or relating to Ochoa's employment with TriNet, including claims of breach of contract, discrimination, or harassment.

The judge found that the defendants had met their burden of proving the existence of a valid arbitration agreement by presenting evidence that Ochoa had knowingly, voluntarily, and willingly signed the agreement. The plaintiff did not oppose the motion to compel arbitration, and therefore did not meet her burden to challenge the agreement.

Accordingly, the court has stayed the action pending resolution of arbitration in accordance with California Code of Civil Procedure section 1281.4.
