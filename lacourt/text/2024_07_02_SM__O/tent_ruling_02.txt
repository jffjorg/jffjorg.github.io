TENTATIVE
RULING
            Defendants
90210 Surgical Medical Center LLC, Benita Tapia and Andrew Balls’ Motion To
Compel Arbitration is GRANTED.  The action
is stated pending resolution of arbitration pursuant to CCP § 1281.4. Defendants
identified the existence of a valid arbitration agreement. Plaintiffs did not
file an opposition, and thus did not meet their burden to challenge the
arbitration provision in the employment contract. 
 
“The petitioner bears the burden of
proving the existence of a valid arbitration agreement by the preponderance of
the evidence, and a party opposing the petition bears the burden of proving by
a preponderance of the evidence any fact necessary to its defense. In these
summary proceedings, the trial court sits as a trier of fact, weighing all the
affidavits, declarations, and other documentary evidence, as well as oral
testimony received at the court's discretion, to reach a final determination.”
(Giuliano v. Inland Empire Personnel, Inc. (2007) 149 Cal.App.4th 1276,
1284.)   “The party opposing arbitration
has the burden of demonstrating that an arbitration clause cannot be
interpreted to require arbitration of the dispute.” (Rice v. Downs
(2016) 247 Cal.App.4th 1213, 1223, citing Coast Plaza Doctors Hospital v.
Blue Cross of California (2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 677, 686-87.)   “On petition of a party to an arbitration
agreement alleging the existence of a written agreement to arbitrate a
controversy and that a party to the agreement refuses to arbitrate that
controversy, the court shall order the petitioner and the respondent to
arbitrate the controversy if it determines that an agreement to arbitrate the
controversy exists, unless it determines that: (a) The right to compel
arbitration has been waived by the petitioner…” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1281.2.)
 
“A party opposing the petition
bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of evidence any fact necessary
to its defense.” (Olvera v. El Pollo Loco, Inc. (2009) 173 Cal.App.4th
447, 453.) CCP §1281.2 only allows the Court to deny enforcement of an applicable
arbitration agreement where the party resisting arbitration demonstrates (1)
waiver; (2) grounds for rescission of the agreement; or (3) subsection (c)
grounds involving third parties to the arbitration agreement and potential for
inconsistent rulings of fact or law. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 1281.2.)
 
            Defendants
90210 Surgical Medical Center LLC, Benita Tapia and Andrew Balls (“Defendants”)
move to compel arbitration based on the Arbitration Agreement, titled “Dispute
Resolution Protocol (‘DRP’) and Mandatory Arbitration of Claims” within the
employment contract entered into between Defendants and Plaintiff Susana Ochoa (“Ochoa”)
on 8-9-21. (Thompson Decl., ¶¶ 10, 14-17, Ex. A ¶ 8, B.) The arbitration
agreement states:
 
this
DRP covers any dispute arising out of or relating to your co-employment with
TriNet, including your TriNet co-employer, and/or arising out of or relating to
your employment with your company, as well as any dispute with an employee,
officer, or director of TriNet or of a TriNet customer (all of whom, in
addition to TriNet customers, are intended to be beneficiaries of this DRP)
(“covered dispute”), including, but not limited to, all claims whether arising
in tort or contract and whether arising under statute or common law including,
but not limited to, any claim of breach of contract, discrimination or
harassment of any kind. The Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) applies to this
DRP.
 
(Id. at ¶¶ 10,
14-17, Ex. A, ¶ 8.)
 
            Defendants
declare that Ochoa knowingly, voluntarily, and willingly signed the Arbitration
Agreement, which was presented to her in a clear and legible manner, during her
employment. (See id. at ¶¶ 9-10, 14-17, Ex. A.) Defendants provide
evidence that Ochoa electronically entered into the arbitration agreement on
8-9-21. (See id., ¶¶ 14-17, Ex. B.) The Defendants declare that based on
Chad Thompson’s “personal knowledge of the design and operation of the TriNet
Platform, the contents of Exhibit B show that Plaintiff clicked the “Accept”
button on August 9, 2021, agreeing to abide by the terms and conditions of the
TCA and its DRP.” (Thompson Decl., ¶ 15.)
 
            Ochoa
does not oppose the motion to compel arbitration and thus does not meet her
burden to challenge the entered into agreement. 
            Thus, the Court finds that the parties entered into a
valid and binding arbitration agreement on 8-9-21. Defendants Motion to Compel Arbitration
is GRANTED. The action is stayed pending resolution
of arbitration pursuant to CCP §1281.4. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 1281.4
[“If a court of competent jurisdiction, whether in this State or not, has
ordered arbitration of a controversy which is an issue involved in an action or
proceeding pending before a court of this State, the court in which such action
or proceeding is pending shall, upon motion of a party to such action or
proceeding, stay the action or proceeding until an arbitration is had in
accordance with the order to arbitrate or until such earlier time as the court
specifies.”].)
