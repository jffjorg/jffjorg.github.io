And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the plaintiff's motion to strike the defendant's answer. The defendant, Critical Climate Inc., failed to pay amounts owed to the plaintiff, Signify North America Corporation, in the amount of $78,069.48. The defendant initially filed an answer pro se, but later filed an amended answer through retained counsel. However, the court granted the motion of the defendant's counsel to withdraw from representation, leaving the defendant unrepresented. Despite this, the defendant has taken no steps to retain new counsel and has not filed opposition to the motion to strike. The judge finds that striking the defendant's answer is appropriate under California Code of Civil Procedure section 436, which allows the court to strike any "irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading" or any part of a pleading "not drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of this state, a court rule, or an order of the court."
