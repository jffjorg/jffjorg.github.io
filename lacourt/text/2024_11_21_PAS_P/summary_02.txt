And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the motion of Michael Kielsky, counsel for Plaintiffs Ning Zhou and Xiaoling Zuo, to be relieved as counsel of record. The motion was filed on October 22, 2024, and alleges that Kielsky is no longer associated with his prior firm and no longer handles personal injury matters, and is occupied with judicial assignments in Arizona. However, the Judge finds that the motion is procedurally defective and has failed to comply with California Rule of Court 3.1362, which requires the use of Judicial Council forms and proper service of notice to all parties and clients. Without compliance with these procedural requirements, the Court cannot grant the motion. As a result, the motion to be relieved as counsel is denied without prejudice.
