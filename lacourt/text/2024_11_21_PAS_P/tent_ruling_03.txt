 Case Number:  23AHCV02935    Hearing Date:   November 21, 2024    Dept:  P [TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING JWY’S MOTION TO QUASH
DEPOSITION SUBPOENAS FOR PRODUCTION OF BUISNESS RECORDS TO FIRST GENERAL BANK
AND BANK OF AMERICAI.         INTRODUCTION
This case involves a dispute between
Plaintiffs Yu Li and Yong Li, and Defendants Ji Li and HG Realty. Plaintiffs
allege that Ji Li defrauded them in connection with their family business,
Plaintiff JWY Group, Inc. ("JWY") (collectively,
"Plaintiffs").
On December 19, 2023, Plaintiffs
filed the instant action alleging seven causes of action: (1) Cancellation of
Written Instruments, (2) Fraud, (3) Intentional Concealment, (4) Breach of
Fiduciary Duty, (5) Conversion, (6) Breach of Contract, and (7) Injunction.
On February 27, 2024, Defendant HG
Realty Investment & Management Inc. ("HG") filed a First Amended
Cross-Complaint (FACC) against JWY, Ji Li and ROES 1 through 50 asserting ten
causes of action, including multiple claims for breach of promissory notes,
judicial foreclosure, fraud, and declaratory relief.
On October 30, 2024, JWY filed the
instant motion to quash subpoenas issued by HG on September 15, 2024, directed
to First General Bank and Bank of America for the production of business
records. HG filed its opposition on November 14, 2024, and JWY submitted its
reply on November 15, 2024.
 
II.        LEGAL STANDARD
            Code of
Civil Procedure section 1987.1 states, “When a subpoena requires…the production
of [documents], the court, upon motion reasonably made by the party, the
witness or any consumer described in Section 1985.3…may make an order quashing
the subpoena entirely, modifying it, or directing compliance with it upon such
terms or conditions as the court shall declare, including protective
orders.”  “The court may make any other order as may be appropriate to
protect the parties, the witness, or the consumer from unreasonable or
oppressive demands including unreasonable violations of a witness’s or
consumer’s right of privacy.”  (Id.) 
 
As a general rule, all unprivileged
information that is relevant to the subject matter of the action is
discoverable if it would itself be admissible evidence at trial or if it
appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.
(Code Civ. Proc. § 2017.010; Schnabel v. Superior Court. (1993) 5
Cal.4th 704, 711.) When the information sought to be discovered impacts a
person’s constitutional right to privacy, limited protections come into play
for that person. (Shaffer v. Superior Court (1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 993,
999.) The protections cover both a person’s personal and financial matters. (Id.)
The court must balance competing rights — the right of a litigant to discover
relevant facts and the right of an individual to maintain reasonable privacy —
in determining whether the information is discoverable. (Id.) 
            For
discovery purposes, information is relevant if it might reasonably assist a
party in evaluating the case, preparing for trial, or facilitating settlement.
(Gonzalez v. Superior Court (1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 1539, 1546.) 
 
III.      ANALYSIS
JWY seeks to quash HG’s subpoenas,
issued on September 15, 2024, directed to First General Bank and Bank of
America for the production of business records.  Alternatively, JWY
requests a protective order and monetary sanctions of $2,910 against HG. JWY
argues that the subpoenas are overly broad, procedurally defective, and violate
privacy rights. (Motion, p.2)
JWY contends that the subpoenas are
overly broad, vague, and ambiguous because they demand financial records from
2019 onward without any limitation. (Motion, pp. 7-8.) JWY argues that the
requested documents are irrelevant to the issues in this action and are not
reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. Specifically,
JWY asserts that the financial records sought by HG, including those from
before 2019 and after 2022, bear no direct connection to the allegations of
fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, or unauthorized actions involving Defendant Ji
Li. (Motion, p.9)
JWY further asserts that the subpoenas
infringe on the privacy rights of Plaintiff Yu Li, employees of JWY Group,
Inc., and other third parties. (Motion, p. 10.) JWY emphasizes that the
requested payroll and financial records are highly confidential and bear no
relevance to the core issues in the case. JWY contends that the disclosure of
these sensitive records would violate the constitutional and statutory privacy
rights of the individuals and entities involved. Moreover, JWY argues that the
Subpoenas fail to comply with the statutory notice requirements under Code of
Civil Procedure sections 1985.3(b) and (c) and 2020.410, as the Notice to
Consumer or Employee was not properly served or directed to all affected
individuals. (Motion, p. 12.)
In opposition, HG argues that the subpoenas
seek records directly related to JWY’s financial structure and its relationship
with Defendant Ji Li. (Opposition, p.4) HG maintains that these records are
necessary to support its defenses and the anticipated Second Amended
Cross-Complaint. (Id.) HG further asserts that it has proposed a
protective order to address JWY's confidentiality concerns by limiting access
to sensitive information. (Opposition, pp. 2-3)
HG also contends that the subpoenas
comply with discovery requirements and denies that they are overly broad or
defective. (Opposition, pp.4-5) According to HG, the requested records are
directly relevant to disputed transactions and rents collected after Ji Li’s
alleged removal as JWY’s secretary. (Id.)  HG concludes by
requesting sanctions of $4,950 against JWY for filing what it describes as a
frivolous motion to quash. (Opposition, pp.8-9)
The Court must balance the
relevance and necessity of the subpoenaed records against the privacy interests
of the parties and third parties. HG argues that the requested records are
essential to support its First Amended Cross-Complaint and adequately represent
Defendant Ji Li’s claims. Furthermore, HG’s proposed protective order may
sufficiently address privacy concerns by limiting the use and disclosure of
sensitive information, allowing discovery to proceed while safeguarding
confidentiality.
However, based on the allegations
in the motion that a Notice to Consumer was not attached to the Subpoenas, the
Court finds that the subpoenas violate Code of Civil Procedure section 1985.3.
As compliance with these procedural safeguards is mandatory, the Court
concludes that the subpoenas must be quashed. Should HG seek documents
implicating the privacy rights of employees or third parties, it must adhere to
all procedural requirements to ensure proper notice and compliance with
California law.
 Sanctions
The court may in its discretion
award the amount of reasonable expenses incurred in making or opposing this
motion. CCP § 1987.2(a). Here, there is no reason to award sanctions. The
deposition subpoena was neither served nor opposed in bad faith. Therefore,
sanctions are denied.
 
IV.       CONCLUSION
The Court GRANTS JWY’s Motion to
Quash Subpoenas issued on September 15, 2024, directed to First General Bank
and Bank of America for the production of business records.
