Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of JWY Group, Inc. and against HG Realty Investment & Management Inc. in a dispute over deposition subpoenas issued by HG to First General Bank and Bank of America. The subpoenas seek business records from 2019 onward and have been deemed overly broad and violative of privacy rights. The judge has granted JWY's motion to quash the subpoenas and denied HG's request for sanctions. The judge has also stated that HG must comply with all procedural requirements, including providing proper notice to affected individuals, if it seeks to obtain documents that implicate the privacy rights of employees or third parties.
