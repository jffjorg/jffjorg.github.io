LEGAL STANDARD
Judges are to apply an appropriate standard of review
of PAGA case settlements, by inquiring whether settlements are “‘fair,
adequate, and reasonable’” and “meaningful and consistent with the purposes of
PAGA….” Moniz v. Adecco USA, Inc. (2021) 72 Cal. App. 5th 56, 64. 
“If parties in a PAGA lawsuit agree to settle, the
‘proposed settlement shall be submitted to the [LWDA],’ and the ‘court shall
review and approve [the] settlement.’” ([Labor Code] § 2699, subd. (l)(2).)
Although our Supreme Court has stated that this provision ensures that ‘any
negotiated resolution is fair to those affected’…, California courts have not
determined the standards by which a trial court reviews and approves a proposed
settlement.” Starks v. Vortex Indus., Inc. (2020) 53 Cal.App.5th 1113,
1124. Accord Williams v. Superior Court (2017) 3 Cal.5th 531, 549 (“PAGA
settlements are subject to trial court review and approval, ensuring that any
negotiated resolution is fair to those affected.”).
“There is no willful failure to pay wages if the
employer and employee have a good faith dispute as to whether and when the
wages were due.” Nordstrom Com. Cases (2010) 186 Cal. App. 4th 576, 584.
ANALYSIS 
The parties based the motion upon extensive discovery,
wage and timekeeping records of approximately thirty-eight employees, personnel
records, and a full day of mediation. Further, the parties arrived at
statistically reliable estimates of the incidents involved. Motion, p. 4.
Additionally, the parties applied formulae to accurately estimate amounts owed
to the employees. Motion, pp. 7-8.  Also,
negotiations included the fact that risks of litigation existed based upon
numerous factual disputes. Motion, 8:14. Defendant also maintains that there is
no evidence of a common policy or practice going against meal and rest breaks,
which counters a showing of any willful failure to pay wages. Motion, 9:17-19. And
the amount of attorneys’ fees is based upon favorable settlement results and
attorney skill and experience. Motion, p. 13.
Thus, the Court finds that the subject settlement is
fair, adequate, reasonable, meaningful, and consistent with the purposes of the
PAGA statute, as to all subject, affected employees.
CONCLUSION 
Therefore, the Court grants the motion.
