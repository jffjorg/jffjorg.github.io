And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the joint motion of the plaintiff and defendant to approve a PAGA settlement and has found that the settlement is fair, adequate, reasonable, meaningful, and consistent with the purposes of the PAGA statute. The settlement was based on extensive discovery, wage and timekeeping records, and a full day of mediation. The parties applied formulae to estimate amounts owed to employees and negotiated the settlement despite the existence of factual disputes. The judge has granted the motion, finding that the settlement is a good faith attempt to resolve the dispute and that there is no evidence of a willful failure to pay wages.
