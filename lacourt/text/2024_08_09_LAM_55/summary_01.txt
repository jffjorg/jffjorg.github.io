And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling denies a motion for reconsideration filed by the plaintiff, seeking a higher amount of attorney's fees awarded in a default judgment entered on May 23, 2024. The Court finds that a motion for reconsideration under Code of Civil Procedure Section 1008 applies only to orders, not judgments, and that the plaintiff is seeking to deviate from the scheduled attorney's fees set forth in Local Rule 3.214. The Court concludes that it has no further power to rule on the motion for reconsideration and suggests that the plaintiff pursue an appeal to challenge the Judgment if they are dissatisfied with the awarded attorney's fees.
