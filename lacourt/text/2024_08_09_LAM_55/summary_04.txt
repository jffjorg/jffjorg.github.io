And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on the plaintiff's remaining outstanding motions in limine. The judge denied motions 5, 6, 9, 10, 11, 21, 24, and 28, which sought to exclude various types of evidence, witnesses, and contentions. These motions were denied because they failed to identify specific evidence to be excluded, lacked supporting evidence, or were improper uses of a motion in limine. The judge granted motion 13, which sought to exclude references to defendant's limited funds as an excuse for its negligence, as defendant failed to explain the relevance of its financial status to the case. The judge will issue a separate tentative ruling on defendant's remaining motions in limine at a later date.
