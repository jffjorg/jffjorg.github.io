  Case Number:  21STCV04008    Hearing Date:   August 9, 2024    Dept:  55 Tentative Ruling in 21STCV04008
Plaintiff’s Motion for Reconsideration of Amount of Fees in Judgment
Plaintiff has filed a motion seeking reconsideration of the
amount of fees awarded in the default Judgment entered in this case on 5/23/2024.
In that Judgment, the Court awarded Plaintiff attorney’s fees consistent with
the schedule of attorneys’ fees set forth in Local Rule 3.214. 
A motion for reconsideration under Code of Civil Procedure
Section 1008 applies to orders, not judgments. The plain language of Section
1008 does not include judgments and “after entry of judgment, a trial court has
no further power to rule on a motion for reconsideration.” Ramon v.
Aerospace Corp. (1996) 50 Cal. App. 4th 1233, 1236. While courts do retain
the ability to correct judgments due to errors, that is not what Plaintiff is
seeking. Rather, Plaintiff contends that the Court should award a higher amount
of fees than the fees in the Judgment, which are consistent with the Local Rule
governing such fees. Rather than the motion for reconsideration. Plaintiff may
pursue an appeal to challenge this Court’s Judgment. 
The motion for reconsideration therefore is denied.
