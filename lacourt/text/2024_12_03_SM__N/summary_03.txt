Judge's Tentative Ruling: Plaintiff's Motion to Consolidate and File Second Amended Complaint Denied

The Plaintiff, Xiaoli Lily Qiu, Parent and Guardian ad Litem of L.W., a Minor, has moved to consolidate the present action with Los Angeles Superior Court Case No. 24SMCV00529 (Qiu v. Geffen Academy at UCLA). The Plaintiff argues that the cases share common issues of law and fact, consolidation will promote efficiency, and consolidation will save time and costs and avoid unnecessary duplication of efforts. However, the Defendant, The Regents of the University of California, opposes consolidation, arguing that the claims in the two actions are unrelated and arise from completely different alleged incidents, and while they occurred at the same school, the incidents do not involve the same set of events.

The Court has discretion to consolidate actions involving common questions of law or fact. The Court considers factors such as timeliness, complexity, and prejudice in deciding whether to consolidate actions. In this case, the Court finds that consolidation is improper at this juncture because the claims as to G.W. are different and there is no overlap of law and fact as to those claims. Given the two claims pose entirely different facts, different witnesses and discovery will be required in the two actions. The actions will involve different legal issues, and the alleged harm was caused by different individuals in each action. Therefore, the Plaintiff's Motion to Consolidate and for Leave to File Second Amended Complaint in Consolidated Action is DENIED.
