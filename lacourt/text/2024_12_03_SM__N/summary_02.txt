And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted KM Partners' motion to set aside the default entered against them on February 29, 2024, and to quash the service of summons and complaint. The judge finds that the default is void for lack of personal jurisdiction over KM Partners, as there is no basis for the court to exercise jurisdiction over the defendant. KM Partners is a Missouri limited liability company with no substantial, continuous, and systematic contact with California, and was served by mail in Missouri, not in California. The judge notes that Plaintiff has failed to provide evidence to dispute KM Partners' evidence, and therefore, the motion is granted.
