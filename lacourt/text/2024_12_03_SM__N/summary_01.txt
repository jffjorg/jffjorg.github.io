And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Defendant Surveillance Security, Inc.'s motion to strike Plaintiff Sandeneta Robison's claims and prayer for punitive damages. The defendant filed its answer to the complaint on March 22, 2024, and then filed the motion to strike on April 4, 2024. However, the defendant's motion was filed after the deadline for responding to the complaint, which was extended until March 28, 2024. The court also noted that, according to case law, a defendant cannot move to strike a complaint after it has answered the complaint. Therefore, the motion to strike was denied.
