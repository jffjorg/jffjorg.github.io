```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion for determination of good faith settlement between the plaintiffs and 7055 Coldwater Canyon Avenue LLC. The plaintiffs allege racial discrimination and violations of the implied warranty of habitability in the provision of apartments with mold, plumbing issues, and intermittent hot water. The defendant Shind LLC has opposed the motion, arguing that the settlement amount of $100,000 is disproportionate to its liability. The judge has ruled that without providing a copy of the settlement agreement, the motion cannot be granted. The judge has also noted that determining the good faith of a settlement requires a trial court to find that the amount of the settlement is within the reasonable range of the settling tortfeasor's proportional share of comparative liability for the plaintiff's injuries.
