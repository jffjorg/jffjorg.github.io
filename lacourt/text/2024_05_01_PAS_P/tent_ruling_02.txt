 Case Number:  22GDCV01128    Hearing Date:   May 1, 2024    Dept:  P [TENTATIVE]
ORDER OVERRULING PLAINTIFFS’ DEMURRER TO THE CROSS-COMPLAINTI.        INTRODUCTION
          This case concerns
allegations of childhood sexual abuse and childhood sexual assault. The two
plaintiffs, Jane Doe AH and Jane Doe KC allege that they suffered childhood
sexual abuse at the hands of Defendants Gloria De Los Angeles Trevino Ruiz,
Sergio Gustavo Andrade Sanchez and Maria Raquenel Portillo Jimenez. The alleged
abuse took place in 1991-1992, when Jane Doe AH was 13 and Jane Doe KC was 15.
The abuse occurred in both Mexico and California, while the Doe plaintiffs were
backup singers and dancers for Defendant Trevi, a Mexican popstar.
          There are two cross-complaints in this
action. Defendant Trevi brought a cross-complaint against Sergio Andrade, Jane
Does KC 1 and AH 2, Jane Roe JP 1 and Conexiones Americanas. As to Jane Doe KC
1, Trevi alleges that KC 1 aided and abetted Andrade in battering, sexually
assaulting/battering Trevi and caused negligent or intentional emotional
distress to Trevi. As to Jane Doe AH 2, Trevi alleges that any harm she caused
should be indemnified by AH 2’s liability. The cross-complaint contains nine
causes of action: (1) sexual assault, (2) aiding and abetting sexual assault,
(3) sexual battery, (4) aiding and abetting sexual battery, (5) battery, (6)
aiding and abetting battery, (7) intentional infliction of emotional distress,
(8) negligent infliction of emotional distress and (9) indemnity.
Before
the Court is Plaintiffs’ demurrer to Trevi’s cross-complaint, filed January 30,
2024. Trevi filed an opposition on April 18, 2024. Plaintiffs filed a reply on
April 24, 2024.
The
demurrer to the cross-complaint is overruled.
II.      DEMURRER
A. Legal Standard
Code
Civ. Proc. Section 430.10(e) provides for a demurrer on the basis that a
complaint fails to state a cause of action. (CCP § 430.10(e).) A demurrer tests
the legal sufficiency of a complaint. (Donabedian
v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.)  A demurrer is treated as “admitting all
material facts properly pleaded,” but not the truth of “contentions, deductions
or conclusions of law.” (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital Dist. (1992) 2
Cal.4th 962, 966-967.) The general rule on demurrer is that the pleadings are
“deemed to be true, however improbable they may be.” (Del E. Webb Corp. v.
Structural Materials Co. (1981) 123 Cal.App.4th 593, 604.) 
Questions
of plaintiff’s ability to prove unlikely allegations are of no concern. (Committee
on Children’s Television, Inc. v. General Foods Corp. (1983) 35 Cal.3d 197,
213-214.)
Allegations
need not be accepted as true if they are contradicted by judicially noticeable
facts. (Cansino v. Bank of America (2014) 224 Cal.App.4th 1462,
1474.) 
“We
treat the demurrer as admitting all the properly pleaded material facts and
consider matters which may be judicially noticed, but we do not treat as
admitted contentions, deductions, or conclusions of fact or law. (Align
Technology, Inc. v. Tran (2009) 179 Cal.App.4th 949, 958 [102 Cal.Rptr.3d
343].) Further, ‘ “ ‘we give the complaint a reasonable interpretation, reading
it as a whole and its parts in their context.’ ”’ (Ibid.) Because a
demurrer tests only the legal sufficiency of the pleading, we accept as true
even the most improbable alleged facts, and we do not concern ourselves with
the plaintiff's ability to prove its factual allegations. (Ibid.)
‘“Facts appearing in exhibits attached to the first amended complaint also are
accepted as true and are given precedence, to the extent they contradict the
allegations.”’ (Paul v. Patton (2015) 235 Cal.App.4th 1088, 1091.)
Although a demurrer does not ordinarily reach affirmative defenses, it ‘“will
lie where the complaint ‘has included allegations that clearly disclose some
defense or bar to recovery.’ ”’ (Casterson v. Superior Court (2002) 101
Cal.App.4th 177, 183, Nolte v. Cedars-Sinai Medical Center (2015) 236
Cal.App.4th 1401, 1406. )
Code
Civ. Proc. Section 430.10(f) provides for a demurrer where a pleading is
uncertain. (CCP § 430.10(f).) Demurrers for uncertainty are disfavored and are
only sustained where a pleading is so incomprehensible a defendant cannot
reasonably respond. (A.J. Fistes v. GDL Best Contractors, Inc. (2019) 38
Cal.App.5th 677, 695; Khoury v.
Maly’s of California (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.)
          B. Meet and Confer Requirement Met
          The Declaration of Ari M. Wilkenfeld is offered in support
of counsel’s compliance with Code Civ. Proc. Section 430.41.Wilkenfeld declares
that he met and conferred with the other parties on January 25, 2024.  (Wilkenfeld Decl. ¶ 4.) Parties did not reach
a resolution. (Wilkenfeld Decl. ¶ 5.)[1] 
The
meet and confer requirement has been met. 
          C. Aiding and Abetting Sexual Assault, Sexual Battery,
Battery
          In their demurrer, Plaintiffs urge that Trevi’s causes of
action against Plaintiff and Cross-Defendant Jane Doe KC 1 fail to state dates
when the abuse occurred, where it occurred and what facts implicate KC 1. In
support, Plaintiffs cite Corum v. Hartford Acc. & Indem. Co. (1945)
67 Cal.App.2d 891, 894-895, internal citations omitted, for the proposition
that “the failure to allege a date, which appears to be material, such as the
date of an accident, known to plaintiff, and as to which it may be assumed
plaintiff's knowledge is superior to that of defendant, is subject to special
demurrer.” (Corum v. Hartford Acc. & Indem. Co. (1945) 67 Cal.App.2d
891, 894-895, internal citations omitted.) Plaintiffs urge that the dates of
the sexual assault, sexual battery and battery are material as AB 2777 only
revived older sexual abuse claims brought by individuals who were minors at the
time of abuse. (AB 2777, CCP § 340.16(e).) Plaintiffs also urge Trevi has
superior knowledge of the abuse and the locations where it took place. (See
Demurrer p. 8: 6-11.)
          The cross-complaint contains no specific timing allegations
as to when the alleged sexual assault, sexual battery and battery took place.
(See Cross-Complaint ¶¶ 23,27, 36, 58, 83.) However, demurrers for uncertainty
are disfavored and the Court holds that the Cross-Complaint is not incomprehensible
to the point where Cross-Defendant KC 1 cannot respond. (See Opposition p. 10:
17-21.) Indeed, Trevi cites case law in her opposition for the proposition that
certain ambiguities in a Complaint or Cross-Complaint can be resolved in
discovery. (See Khoury v. Maly’s of California, Inc. (1993) 14
Cal.App.4th 612, 616.)
          Additionally, Plaintiffs urge that the cross-complaint is
deficient for failure to allege specific acts by Plaintiffs in California. However,
the Cross-Complaint alleges that KC covered up and otherwise ensured that the
assaults took place. (Cross-Complaint (XC) ¶¶ 27, 43, 65, 88.) These
allegations are sufficient at the demurrer stage. (See CCP § 340.16(e)(4)(A);
see Opposition p. 9.)
          The Court overrules the demurrer to the second, fourth and
sixth causes of action.
          D. Intentional/Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress 
          Plaintiffs urge that “[t]he very few allegations in the
cross-complaint are conclusory and insufficient to draw a conclusion that
Plaintiff Jane Doe K.C. 1 was aware of any sexual assault or related tort, let
alone participated in or ‘gave substantial assistance or encouragement’ to
Andrade in committing a sexual assault, battery, or negligent/intentional
infliction of emotional distress in California, or anywhere else.” (Demurrer p.
10: 17-21.) 
The
necessary elements for NIED are: (1) the defendant’s legal duty to use due
care; (2) the defendant’s breach of such a legal duty; (3) causation; and (4)
damages in the form of serious emotional distress.¿ (Huggins v. Longs Drug
Stores California, Inc. (1993) 6 Cal.4th 124, 129; Bogard v. Emplrs
Casualty Co. (1985) 164 Cal.App.3d 602, 618.) “The elements of a prima
facie case for the tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress are:
(1) extreme and outrageous conduct by the defendant with the intention of
causing, or reckless disregard of the probability of causing, emotional
distress; (2) the plaintiff’s suffering severe or extreme emotional distress;
and (3) actual and proximate causation of the emotional distress by the
defendant’s outrageous conduct.” (Wilson v. Hynek (2012) 207 Cal.App.4th
999, 1009, citation and ellipses omitted.) 
Here,
the Cross-Complaint alleges that the Cross-Defendant KC helped Cross-Defendant
Andrade assault Trevi or otherwise covered up the assaults, intended to cause
Trevi emotional distress and that Trevi suffered extreme emotional distress caused
by Cross-Defendant KC’s conduct. (See XC ¶¶ 100-107.) The Cross-Complaint’s
allegations are sufficient to state a cause of action for intentional
infliction of emotional distress. (See So v. Shin
(2013) 212 Cal.App.4th 652, 671, internal citations omitted; CACI 1620; XC
¶¶ 103-106.)
          The Court overrules the demurrer to the seventh cause of
action. 
          E.
Indemnity
          There is no direct argument in Plaintiff’s motion as to
indemnity.
          The Court overrules the demurrer on the ninth cause of
action for indemnity.
III.     CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
Plaintiffs’
demurrers to the second, fourth, sixth, seventh and ninth causes of action are
overruled. 
          Defendant Gloria Trevi to give notice of this order.
