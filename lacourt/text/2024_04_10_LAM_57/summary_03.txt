The court has also sustained the Individual Defendants' demurrer to the third and fourth causes of action, and the sixth through twelfth causes of action. The court has rejected PopID's contention that the breach of contract claim fails because it cannot be ascertained from the pleading whether the 'employment contract' is written, oral, or implied by conduct. The court has also rejected PopID's contention that the breach of contract claim fails because Plaintiff neglected to attach a copy of the contract to the complaint or to set forth the terms verbatim in the complaint. The court has sustained the demurrer to the third and fourth causes of action, and the sixth through twelfth causes of action, with leave to amend.
