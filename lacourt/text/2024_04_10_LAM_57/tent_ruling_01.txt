  Case Number:  19STCV25081    Hearing Date:   April 10, 2024    Dept:  57  The Court is postponing the contempt proceeding so that Plaintiff can provide proper notice of the proceeding to the Defendant.  This may seem hyper-technical. But contempt proceedings are hyper-technical.  The Court is persuaded that Defendant is correct in arguing that notice of the proceeding was improper.  Better to ensure notice was proper than to conduct a proceeding based on a notice that the Court of Appeal later determines was improper.  The Court will, however, discuss with the parties at the hearing on April 10, 2024 a time estate for the proceeding and a date that is suitable to conduct it.
