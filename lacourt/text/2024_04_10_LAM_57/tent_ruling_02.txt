 Case Number:  22STCV01230    Hearing Date:   April 10, 2024    Dept:  57 Defendants' motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication is denied.  Plaintiff's opposition demonstrates that there are disputed issues of material fact that preclude the entry of summary judgment on Plaintiffs' action as a whole or summary adjudication on any of Plaintiff's particular causes of action.  The Court notes that Defendants failed to file a reply brief in support of their motion and thus Defendants did not avail themselves of the opportunity to try to negate the force of Plaintiff's arguments in opposition to the motion.
