Plaintiff’s Motion in Limine to Exclude
Evidence Not Disclosed During Discovery: The court defers until argument. 
The questions are whether there were any late discovered documents, and
if so, whether their exclusion would cause undue prejudice.   

 

Plaintiff’s Motion in Limine to
Exclude Evidence, Comments and to Direct Witnesses Not to Testify Regarding the
Defense of Harassment, Retaliatory and Trespass: Granted as to the defenses of harassment and trespass only.  The court defers until argument on the
defense of retaliation.  The question is
what viable retaliation defense exists in a failure to pay case, even though
the answer alleges a retaliation defense. 


 

Plaintiff’s Motion in Limine To
Exclude Evidence, Comments and to Direct Witnesses Not to Testify Regarding the
Defense of Habitability and the Condition of the Premises After the Notice was
Served: Granted as to this defense only.

 

Jury trial is set for October 21, 2024,
