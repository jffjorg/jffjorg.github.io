The judge has issued a tentative ruling on several motions in limine filed by the plaintiff, 1025 MCFARLAND LLC.

The second motion seeks to exclude evidence, comments, and direct witnesses not to testify regarding the defenses of harassment, retaliatory behavior, and trespass. The court has granted this motion as to the defenses of harassment and trespass, but deferred ruling on the defense of retaliatory behavior until argument.

The third motion seeks to exclude evidence, comments, and direct witnesses not to testify regarding the defense of habitability and the condition of the premises after the notice was served. The court has granted this motion as well.

The jury trial is set for October 21, 2024, at 10:00 a.m. in Department S13. The court will give notice of this ruling.
