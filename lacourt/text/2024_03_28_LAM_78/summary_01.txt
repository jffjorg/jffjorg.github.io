Here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion by Domus Design Group, LLC (Domus) to enter a stipulation to revise the dates listed in the May 30, 2023 joint status conference report. The report agreed to complete depositions, mediation, written discovery, and expert discovery by certain dates. Domus alleges that the Onni Defendants have refused to produce requested discovery documents and responded to discovery requests with boilerplate objections. The Onni Defendants responded to three sets of requests for written discovery from Domus and produced over 100,000 pages of documents. The Court finds that Domus had ample time to complete discovery and failed to do so in the allotted time. The Court also finds that the discovery deadlines from the joint status report it adopted in the June 6, 2023 minute order are firm. Therefore, the motion to enter the stipulation is denied.
