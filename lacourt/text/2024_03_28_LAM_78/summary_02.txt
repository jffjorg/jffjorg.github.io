And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge Hon. Jill Feeney on a motion filed by Commercial Loan Servicing, LLC (CLS) to compel responses to discovery requests and to deem requests for admissions admitted. The parties have been in dispute over the discovery requests, with CLS arguing that Cross-Defendants Feigen and Ahlholm failed to provide timely responses. The Court finds that CLS's motions are denied as moot because Cross-Defendants served late responses to the discovery requests before the hearing. However, the Court grants CLS's request for sanctions in the amount of $1,605 jointly and severally against Cross-Defendants. The Court also awards $1,125 in attorney time and $480 in filing fees to CLS.
