[1] This
fact is omitted in the second declaration of Chapjian.


[2] The
Master Plan does not appear to label the specific path at issue. Moreover,
Plaintiff’s evidence shows that the subject park has “pathways/trails”. (See
Pl. Exh. B, Master Plan, at p. 14.) In addition, Plaintiff’s own expert refers
to it as a path, or even a “walking path.” (Chapjian Decl. ¶ 12 [“The fact that
the Defendant, City of Monrovia is calling their walkways a trail rather than a
path does not change the fact that these are ‘developed’ walking paths inside
developed City parks for people of all ages and abilities to use.”].)


[3] Plaintiff
argues that the “pedestrian path/ walkway did not provide direct access to the
park’s amenities.” (Opposition at p. 9.) However, Plaintiff does not explain
why the grassy areas with trees surrounding the path are not part of the park’s
amenities.
