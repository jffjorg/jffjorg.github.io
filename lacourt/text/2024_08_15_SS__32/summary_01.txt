And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants the defendants' motion to continue the trial and all associated discovery deadlines. The defendants, Southern California Edison Company and Edison International, argue that they have not had sufficient time to conduct discovery since recently appearing in the case. The judge finds good cause to continue the trial and related deadlines based on the defendants' assertions and the lack of opposition from the plaintiff. The trial is continued to March 24, 2025, and the Final Status Conference is continued to March 10, 2025. The judge also orders that all discovery and motion deadlines shall be in accordance with the new trial date.
