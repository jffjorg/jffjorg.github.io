And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding the motion to contest the Application for Determination of Good Faith Settlement. The motion was filed by the defendants (Nandha Transport Inc. and Terry Lee Hunsicker) to contest the settlement between the plaintiff (James Burley) and the defendant (Steven Rangel) for $100,000. The defendants argue that the settlement was not made in good faith because there is no evidence of Rangel's proportionate liability and the settlement amount is not reasonable. The judge agrees with the defendants and grants the motion to contest the Application. The Application is denied without prejudice, meaning that Rangel can re-file the Application if he provides additional evidence to support the good faith of the settlement.
