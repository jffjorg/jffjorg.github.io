And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a petition for minors' compromise filed by Maria Tovar on behalf of her 16-year-old daughter, Yesenia Tovar. The petition seeks to compromise Yesenia's claim for injuries sustained in a slip and fall, including right shoulder pain, clavicle fracture, neck pain, headaches, and cognitive issues. The judge denies the petition without prejudice, citing several reasons. First, Maria Tovar must provide further medical reports or records showing that Yesenia is fully recovered from her injuries. Second, Maria Tovar must complete certain items in the petition, including describing the terms of the settlement and providing attachments. Third, the judge notes that the amounts in item 12a(3) may be incorrect and requests that Maria Tovar review and correct these calculations. Finally, the judge approves Maria Tovar's request for $106,666.67 in attorney fees, which represents 33.33% of the gross settlement. The parties are encouraged to meet and confer to resolve any disputes, and if a resolution is not reached, they must submit on the tentative ruling by emailing the court.
