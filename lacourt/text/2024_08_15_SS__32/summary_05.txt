Here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling is in regards to a motion for summary judgment filed by the City of Monrovia (Defendant) against Raquel Boyadjian (Plaintiff). The Plaintiff alleges that she tripped and fell on a path in Recreation Park, which is owned by the City of Monrovia, and that the path was in a dangerous condition. The Defendant argues that the path qualifies as a "trail" under Government Code section 831.4, which provides immunity to public entities for injuries caused by the condition of walkways if they constitute a "trail".

The Court finds that the path was designed and used for recreational purposes, and that the Defendant meets its burden to show that the injury took place on a trail at the subject park, which is a recreational area, and that the injury was caused by a condition of the trail. The Plaintiff's evidence does not establish a triable issue of fact, and therefore, the motion for summary judgment is granted.
