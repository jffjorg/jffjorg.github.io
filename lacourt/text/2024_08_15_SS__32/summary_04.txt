Solis Tello, but it is untimely because it was filed nearly a year after the date for production. The judge has denied the motion and ordered that the defendant give notice of the order and file a proof of service. The judge has also stated that the defendant failed to meet and confer with Philipos before filing the motion, as required by law.
