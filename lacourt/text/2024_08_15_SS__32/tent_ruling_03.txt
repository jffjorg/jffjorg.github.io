  15, 2024




CASE NUMBER:


22STCV15025




MOTIONS:  


Motion
  to Quash Service of Amended Summons and First Amended Complaint




MOVING PARTY:


Defendant PPF AMLI 4242 Via Marina, LLC




OPPOSING PARTY:


None



 
BACKGROUND
 
On
May 5, 2022, Plaintiff Jose Angel Manaiza, Jr. (“Plaintiff” in pro per) filed a
complaint against “AMLI” seemingly for terminating a tenancy.   
 
On May 20, 2024, Plaintiff filed a first amended complaint (“FAC”)
against PPF 4242 Via Marina LLC, AMLI Management Company, and Does 1 to 50. 
 
Defendant PPF AMLI 4242 Via Marina, LLC (“Defendant”) now moves to
quash service of the amended summons and complaint, arguing service was
defective and as such, the Court lacks personal jurisdiction over Defendant. No
opposition has been filed.
 
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
“A defendant . . . may serve and file a notice of motion for one or
more of the following purposes:¿ (1) To quash service of summons on the ground
of lack of jurisdiction of the court over him or her. . . .”¿(Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 418.10(a).)¿The motion must be filed on or before the last day on which the
defendant must plead or within any further time that the court may for good
cause allow. (Id.) 
 
“[C]ompliance with the statutory procedures for service of process is
essential to establish personal jurisdiction. [Citation.]”¿(Dill v. Berquist
Construction Co. (1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 1426, 1444.)¿“[T]he filing of a
proof of service creates a rebuttable presumption that the service was proper”
but only if it “complies with the statutory requirements regarding such
proofs.”¿(Id. at 1441-42.) ¿On a motion to quash service of summons, the
plaintiff has the burden of establishing by a preponderance of the evidence the
prima facie facts entitling the court to assume jurisdiction, including whether
service was in compliance with statutory requirements. (Lebel v Mai
(2012) 210 Cal.App.4th 1154, 1160.) A court may rely upon the verified
declarations of the parties and other competent witnesses. (Buchanan v. Soto
(2015) 241 Cal.App.4th 1353, 1362.) “A court lacks jurisdiction over a party if
there has not been proper service of process.”¿(Ruttenberg v. Ruttenberg
(1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 801, 808.)
 
            Effecting service on a limited liability
company requires delivery of the summons and complaint to some person on behalf
of the company.  (Code Civ. Proc. § 416.10; Corp. Code § 17701.13(a)(2).)
This means that service on a limited liability company is effectuated by
serving the person designated as its agent for service of process.  (See
Corp. Code § 17701.16.) 
 
DISCUSSION
 
Here, the proof of service filed on June 5, 2024, shows
that Plaintiff served the amended complaint and unsigned summons via substitute
service on June 3, 2024 at “CWL. 12011 San Vicente Blvd. Suite 600. Los
Angeles, CA 90049 c/o Neil S Lerner Esq and or Edward A Cosgrove.” 
 
However, based on the face of the proof of service, it
does not appear that Defendant’s designated agent for service of process was
served.  Additionally, there is no name
of the person who received the purported substitute service [item 5b of form POS-010]
or indication that the first amended complaint and amended summons were served.

 
Because Defendant is challenging the Court’s
jurisdiction, Plaintiff has the burden to show that service was proper. Since
Plaintiff has not opposed this motion, he fails to meet his burden. As a
result, the motion to quash is granted. 
 
CONCLUSION AND
ORDER
 
Therefore, the Court GRANTS Defendant PPF AMLI 4242 Via Marina,
LLC’s motion to quash service of amended
summons and first amended complaint.
 
The Order to Show Cause Re Monetary Sanctions for Failure to Enter
Default/ Alternatively Trial Setting Conference is advanced and vacated. An
Order to Show Cause Re Monetary Sanctions up to $1000/ Dismissal for Failure to
Serve is set for October 15, 2024 at 8:30 a.m. in Department 32 of the Spring
Street Courthouse. The Order to Show Cause Re Monetary Sanctions for Failure to
Appear scheduled for September 5, 2024 is continued to October 15, 2024 at
8:30.
 
Defendant to provide notice and file a proof of service of such.
