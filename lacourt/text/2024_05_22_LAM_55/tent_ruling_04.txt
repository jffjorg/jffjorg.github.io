 Case Number:  BC633176    Hearing Date:   May 22, 2024    Dept:  55 NATURE OF PROCEEDINGS:
Judgment Creditor, Steve Nguyen’s Motion for
Contempt, Or in The Alternative, For the Court to Set an Order to Show Cause
Why an Order for Contempt Should Not Issue.
BACKGROUND
In this case, the court
filed a stipulated Judgment for Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant/Judgment Debtor Kevin
Lamb (“Lamb”) to pay Defendants/Cross-Complainants/Judgment Creditors $274,000.
On 12/20/23, the Court entered an order granting in part and denying in part Defendant/Cross-Complainant/Judgment
Creditor Steve Nguyen’s (“Nguyen”) motion to compel further responses from Lamb.


Nguyen moves for an order of contempt or an order to
show cause regarding contempt pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure Sections 1209,
1211, and 1218, as well as an order for monetary sanctions pursuant to Code of
Civil Procedure Section 177.5. Nguyen also requests an order that Lamb appear
in person. Plaintiff’s counsel opposes the motion with respect to the request
for monetary sanctions against counsel but otherwise does not oppose the
motion. 
LEGAL STANDARD
The “requirements for a valid contempt citation apply
in discovery sanctions matters.” In re de la Parra  (1986) 184
Cal.App.3d 139, 144.
To support an order to show cause re an indirect
contempt (occurring outside the immediate presence of the court), a declaration
must evidence, as jurisdictional requirements “(1) the making of the order, (2)
knowledge of the order, (3) ability of the accused to render compliance, and
(4) willful disobedience of the order.” Application of  Ny (1962) 201 Cal.App.2d 728, 731.
“‘The power of the court to punish for contempt is
indeed broad, but it is not unlimited. It is a drastic remedy, to be employed
only when necessary to the proper and orderly conduct of judicial
proceedings.’” Chapman v. Superior Court (1968) 261 Cal.App.2d 194, 201.
A citee must be personally served with a charging
affidavit and an order to show cause setting a future hearing time, or a court
will lack jurisdiction to proceed. Cedars-Sinai Imaging Medical Group v. Superior
Court (2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 1281, 1286-1287.
ANALYSIS
According to Nguyen, Lamb and his attorney of record
willfully disobeyed the order filed 12/20/23, including by serving no
supplemental discovery responses. Lamb’s counsel reports that his client, Lamb,
is not communicating, and counsel produced all documents responsive to Nguyen’s
discovery requests within Lamb’s counsel’s possession, custody or control.
Further, counsel argues that the motion fails to show that counsel has the
ability to produce more discovery. Additionally, counsel contends that $14,625.00
in requested sanctions is unreasonable and should be reduced to $2000.
The Court exercises its discretion to set an order to
show cause as to Lamb, but not as to counsel having the explanation that the
client is not communicating or cooperating with discovery.
CONCLUSION
The motion is granted as to the request to set an
order to show cause, and otherwise denied.
The Court sets an order to show cause for hearing in
Department 55, on 7/12/24, at 8:30 a.m., where Lamb shall show cause, if any,
why monetary sanctions in a sum of up to $2000.00 should not be imposed upon
that party, for the reason of willful disobedience of the 12/20/23 discovery
order. Nguyen must file a proof of service showing Lamb was personally served
with a copy of this Court’s OSC. Lamb is ordered to appear personally in Department
55 at the OSC on 7/12/24.
