And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has granted the unopposed motion of Keller Williams Realty, Inc. for summary adjudication on three issues. The motion was made on the grounds that there exists no triable issue of material fact on the issues of Keller's liability for alleged negligence and fraudulent misrepresentation, the timeliness of the plaintiff's negligence claim, and Keller's alleged misrepresentation to the plaintiff. The judge found that Keller has shifted the burden of proof on all three issues and that the plaintiff has filed no opposition to raise any triable issues of material fact.
