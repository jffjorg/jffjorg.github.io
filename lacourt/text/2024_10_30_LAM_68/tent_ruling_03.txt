SUMMARY
OF ACTION
On
November 21, 2023, Guadencio Yap filed a complaint for Fraud, Breach of
Fiduciary Duty, and Quantum Meruit. On February 5, 2024, Plaintiff filed a
verified derivative first amended complaint for Breach of Fiduciary Duty, Abuse
of Control, and Unjust Enrichment. On April 15, 2024, Co answered the verified
first amended complaint, and filed a cross-complaint against Yap for
Conversion, Violation of Penal Code section 496, Breach of Contract, Breach of
Fiduciary Duty, Unjust Enrichment, and Unfair Business Practices. 
 
RULING: Granted.
Defendant/Cross-Complainant
Samuel Co moves to deem Request for Admissions (set one) served on Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant
Guadenico Yap, admitted.
 
Defendant represents service of requests for admissions on April
16, 2024. [Declaration of David Shinder, ¶ 2, Ex. A.] Plaintiff only provided
untimely unverified and improper responses. [Id., ¶ 6, Ex. C.]
 
The motion is unopposed. The court electronic filing system
shows no reply filed at the time of the tentative ruling publication cutoff. Unverified
responses constitute non-responses. The court otherwise declines to determine
any waiver of objections or propriety of the responses, as such a determination
requires actual verified responses and a motion to compel further responses. The
unopposed motion is granted. Request for Admissions (set one) is deemed
admitted. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).) Sanctions in the amount of
$250 imposed against defendant Guadencio Yap, joint and several with counsel,
and payable within 30 days. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)
 
Motion
to compel responses to request for production of documents and form
interrogatories set for November 4, 2024. Trial scheduled on February 24, 2025.

 
Defendant/Cross-Complainant to provide notice.
