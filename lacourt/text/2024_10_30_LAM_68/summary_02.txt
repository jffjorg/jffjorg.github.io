The judge is considering a motion filed by Limelight International, Ltd. to compel D. Masin Consulting, LLC to provide more complete responses to Limelight's requests for documents. Limelight claims that D. Masin has failed to produce all of the documents it is required to produce, and has not provided a complete privilege log.

The judge reserves the right to appoint a discovery referee if necessary, but notes that this is not necessary at this time. The judge also orders the parties to meet and confer to address any remaining issues.

In summary, the judge is requiring D. Masin to provide more complete responses to Limelight's requests for documents and imposing sanctions on D. Masin and its counsel for failing to do so.
