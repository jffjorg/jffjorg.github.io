And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied the Plaintiff's motion to augment the Assessment Appeals Board Administrative Record or alternatively issue a writ of administrative mandamus compelling augmentation. The Plaintiff, Rick Ladd, seeks to augment the record to allow review of the complete record regarding the assessment process. However, the Court has previously determined that the sole remaining issue for consideration is the calculation of the refund amount, and the Plaintiff is precluded from seeking de novo review of the entire underlying assessment process.

The Court has also held that the Plaintiff's claims are limited to a challenge to the calculation of the refund amount, and that the Plaintiff has no right to a trial de novo in the superior court to resolve conflicting issues of fact as to the taxable value of his property. The Plaintiff's claims are further limited by the substantial evidence standard, which requires that the Court only consider evidence presented at the administrative hearing, and not new or additional information.

The Court has also cited several legal precedents, including Norby Lumber Co. v. County of Madera and Little v. Los Angeles County Assessment Appeals Bds., to support its decision. The Judge has also noted that the Plaintiff's claims are properly filed in the superior court, and that the case will proceed on the issue of the tax refund.

The motion is denied, and the trial is set for January 13, 2025. The Plaintiff is to give notice.
