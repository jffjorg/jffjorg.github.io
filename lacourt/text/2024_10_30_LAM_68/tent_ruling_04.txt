On
August 22, 2024, the court denied the special motion to strike the first
amended complaint brought by City of Redondo Beach.
 
RULING: Denied.
Request
for Judicial Notice: Granted.
Defendant
City of Redondo Beach Police Department moves to quash service of the first
amended complaint. The “Police Department” moves to quash on grounds said
department works as a part of the City of Redondo Beach, rather than a separate
government entity subject to independent designation as a defendant. Plaintiff
in opposition maintains service was proper, and the status of the police
department is not properly considered in a motion to quash service. Defendant
in reply maintains the motion to quash constitutes the proper method for
challenge. 

The court takes judicial notice of the Secretary of State roster and concludes
the Redondo Police Department lacks a separate, independent legal entity status
apart from the City of Redondo Beach. While the “Police Department” appears as
part of the City of Redondo Beach without a separate charter, given the
opposition, the court declines to make a determination regarding a lack of
jurisdiction on the basis of the unchallenged service or typical jurisdictional
requirements under the minimum contact standard. (Code Civ. Proc., § 418.10,
subd. (a)(1).) Whether the subject opposition ultimately mounts to a resource wasteful
distinction without a difference or not, the propriety of the “Police
Department” as a separately named defendant appears more properly addressed in
a demurrer, rather than a jurisdictional issue in a motion to quash given the
general appearance of the City of Redondo Beach. (Vann v. City and County of
San Francisco (2023) 97 Cal.App.5th 1013, 1023-1026.) 
 
The motion to quash
service is DENIED.
 
Motion
to deem admissions admitted, and multiple demurrers and a motion to strike
between December 5, 2024, and January 27, 2025.
 
Defendants
to provide notice.
