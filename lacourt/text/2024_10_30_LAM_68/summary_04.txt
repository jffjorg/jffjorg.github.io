English-text summary:

The tentative ruling denies the motion to quash service of the first amended complaint filed by the City of Redondo Beach Police Department. The City argues that the Police Department is not a separate legal entity subject to independent designation as a defendant and that service of the complaint was improper. The court disagrees, concluding that the Police Department lacks a separate, independent legal entity status apart from the City of Redondo Beach. The court also notes that the propriety of the Police Department as a separately named defendant appears more properly addressed in a demurrer, rather than a jurisdictional issue in a motion to quash. The case will proceed, with the defendants to provide notice.
