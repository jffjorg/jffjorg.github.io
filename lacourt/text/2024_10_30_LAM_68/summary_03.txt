And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the defendant's motion to deem the requests for admissions served on the plaintiff admitted. The defendant served the requests for admissions on April 16, 2024, but the plaintiff only provided untimely and improper responses. The motion is unopposed, and the court has found that the unverified responses constitute non-responses. As a result, the court has deemed the requests for admissions admitted. Additionally, the court has imposed sanctions of $250 against the plaintiff, jointly and severally with counsel, payable within 30 days. The motion to compel responses to request for production of documents and form interrogatories is set for November 4, 2024, and the trial is scheduled for February 24, 2025.
