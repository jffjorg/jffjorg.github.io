Mammoital's owner learned of the action and default in May 2023 and promptly took action to have the default set aside. The plaintiff, Anthony Bouyer, filed a notice of non-opposition to the motion and indicated that he is still willing to stipulate to set aside the default. The judge has ordered Mammoital to file a responsive pleading by September 28, 2023.
