Case #22CHCV00662
 
MOTION TO SET
ASIDE & VACATE DEFAULT
 
Motion filed on 6/5/23.
 
MOVING PARTY: Defendant Mammoital Inc.
RESPONDING PARTY: Plaintiff Anthony Bouyer
 
RELIEF REQUESTED: An order setting aside the
default entered on 11/2/22 against Mammoital Inc. in this action.
 
RULING: The motion is granted.
 
On 8/18/22, Plaintiff Anthony Bouyer (Plaintiff) filed
this action against defendants, including Defendant Mammoital Inc. (Mammoital)
for violations of the Unruh Civil Rights Act. 
On 9/12/22, Plaintiff filed a proof of service indicating that Mammoital
was served by substitute service by leaving documents with “Claudia Rosales –
person in charge.”  
 
On 11/2/22, default was entered against Mammoital.  On 6/5/23, Mammoital filed the instant motion
seeking an order setting aside the default entered against it on 11/2/22 on the
ground that it was not properly served with the summons and complaint.  (Mammo Decl.); CCP 473(b); CCP 473.5  When Mammoital’s owner learned of the action
and default in May of 2023, he acted quickly to have the default set
aside.  (See Mammo Decl.). 
 
On 9/14/23, Plaintiff filed a Notice of Non-Opposition to
the motion.  The notice indicates that
Plaintiff’s counsel has attempted to contact Mammoital’s counsel since May 2023
to discuss settlement.  It also indicates
that on 7/28/23, Plaintiff’s counsel emailed defense counsel and offered to
stipulate to set aside the default and sent a follow-up email on 8/2/23.  However, no response was received.  The notice indicates that Plaintiff is still
willing to stipulate to set aside Mammoital’s default.  
 
Based on the foregoing, the default entered against
Mammoital on 11/2/22 is set aside. 
Mammoital is ordered to file a responsive pleading today, 9/28/23.
