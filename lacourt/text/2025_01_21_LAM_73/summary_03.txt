Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge, Rolf M. Treu, has issued a tentative ruling on Benjamin Kiss's motion to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff BMBG Investments, LLC. The motion is denied because the withdrawal of counsel would prejudice the client, given the upcoming final status conference and non-jury trial scheduled for March 10 and 26, 2025, respectively. The judge finds that the breakdown in the attorney-client relationship is a proper ground for withdrawal, but requires Plaintiff to find new counsel and formally file a Substitution of Attorney form in order to withdraw counsel.
