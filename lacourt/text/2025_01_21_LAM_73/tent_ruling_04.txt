Plaintiff/moving party: John B. Larson, Esq.
Counsel for
Defendant: N/A
 
REQUEST FOR ENTRY OF DEFAULT JUDGMENT (filed 12/19/2024) 
 
TENTATIVE RULING 
 
Plaintiff’s request for default judgment is GRANTED.
 
I. BACKGROUND
 
On February 7, 2024, Plaintiff Boa
Logistics, LLC filed the instant action against Defendant Lucky B Express, Inc.

 
Plaintiff alleges causes of action for
Breach of Contract and Negligence. 
 
The Complaint alleges the following.
Plaintiff is a licensed property broker by the Federal Motor Carrier
Administration. It arranges freight transportation for its customers. Defendant
Lucky B. Express, Inc. ("Lucky B") is a motor carrier operating
interstate to provide services required by Plaintiff. Plaintiff and Lucky B
entered into a contract which provided that, inter alia, Lucky B would provide
transportation services as directed by Plaintiff. Lucky B agreed to
transportation of temperature-controlled shipments and ensure that shipments
would arrive successfully. On January 27, 2022, Lucky B transported a load
directed by Plaintiff. The load was picked up in good condition in California,
but upon arrival at Trader Joe's in Pennsylvania, it was rejected due to
evidence of mouse infestation on the pallets. This breach required the
destruction of the contaminated goods, costing $74,858.08 in product loss and
$2,600 for disposal, for a total principal amount of $77,458.08. 
 
On November 21, 2024, default was
entered against Defendant. 
 
On December 4, 2024, Plaintiff filed a
request for Default Judgment which was subsequently heard on December 6, 2024,
whereby the Honorable Rolf M. Treu found the appropriate JC Form CIV-100 had
not been used to request court judgment. The Court further noted:
 
While Plaintiff filed a CIV-100 form
on November 21, 2024 requesting entry of default, Plaintiff must also file a
CIV-100 form to request default judgment with Section 2 of the form filled out.

 
On December 12, 2024[1],
in support of its request for default judgment, Plaintiff only filed form
JUD-100, a memorandum of costs, a summary of the case and a declaration in
support. The Court notes that Plaintiff does not indicate how it calculated its
attorneys’ fees. 
 
(See 12.6.24 Min. Order.)
 
Thus, Plaintiff’s prior request for
default judgment was denied for failure to file a CIV-100 and a failure to
indicate how attorneys’ fees were calculated.
 
On December 19, 2024, Plaintiff filed
an updated CIV-100 in support for its instant Request for Default Judgment
against Defendant Lucky B with a completed section 2, as well as a JUD-100; a
Memorandum of Costs; Summary of the Case; the Declaration of Vince Rivait, the
General Manager for Plaintiff Boa Logistics (“Rivait Decl.”); the Declaration
of Plaintiff’s Counsel, John B. Larson (“Larson Decl.”); and a POS-030. That
same day, the operative hearing was continued to the instant date of January
21, 2025.
 
Plaintiff is requesting a judgment
against Defendant in the principal amount of $77,458.08. In addition to the
principal amount, Plaintiff is entitled to: (1) Interest in the sum of
$17,867.24, calculated at the rate 10% per annum on the principal amount of
$77,458.08 ($21.22 per day times 842 days from the Loss and Damages Claims form
(BOL) dated 8/15/2022; (2) court costs of $1,055.30; and (3) attorney’s fees of
$3,305.00 for a total of $99,685.62. 
 
 
II.DISCUSSION
 
A.      Legal
Standard
 
CCP § 585 permits entry of a judgment after a Defendant has
failed to timely answer after being properly served.  A party seeking judgment
on the default by the Court must file a Request for Court Judgment, and: (1) a
brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other admissible evidence in
support of the judgment requested; (3) interest computations as necessary; (4)
a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) a proposed form of judgment; (6) a
dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought; (7) a dismissal
of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application for
separate judgment under CCP § 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each
judgment; (8) exhibits as necessary; and (9) a request for attorneys’ fees if
allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.  (CRC Rule 3.1800.)

The Court finds Plaintiff has now complied with
all the requirements for default judgment. The JC Form CIV-100 was
appropriately filed on December 19, 2024, in support of Plaintiff’s request for
Default Judgment and Plaintiff’s exhibits and declarations sufficiently
establish damages and attorneys’ fees. (See Larson Decl., Ex. 1.) The
Court finds Larson’s hourly rate of $350 per hour reasonable and that Plaintiff
has now adequately evidenced its calculation of the requested attorneys’ fees. 
 
Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s request for
default judgment is GRANTED.
 
III.
CONCLUSION 
 
Plaintiffs’ request for default judgment is GRANTED.
