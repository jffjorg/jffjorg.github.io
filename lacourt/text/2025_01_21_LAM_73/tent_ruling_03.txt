TENTATIVE RULING
 
Attorney
Benjamin Kiss’s motion to be relieved as counsel is DENIED
 
I. BACKGROUND
 
This case arises from an alleged breach of contract between
Plaintiff BMBG Investments, LLC (Plaintiff) and Defendant California Credit
Union (Defendant). Plaintiff alleges that it agreed to lease property to
Defendant in a shopping center, with Defendant agreeing to pay rent and abiding
by all laws related to the tenancy. Plaintiff claims that Defendant agreed to
obtain proper permits for any and all construction and/or remodeling work done
on the property, and to return the premises at the end of the lease in the same
condition in which Defendant received it. 
 
On July 25, 2023, Plaintiff filed a complaint against Defendant,
alleging one cause of action for Breach of Contract. 
 
On December 19, 2024, counsel for Plaintiff, Benjam Kiss (Mr. Kiss),
filed the instant motion to be relieved as counsel.
II. ANALYSIS
 
A.      Legal
Standard 
 
An
attorney in an action may be changed at any time before or after judgment or
final determination upon the order of the court, upon the application of either
client or attorney, after notice from one to the other. (Code Civ. Proc., §
284(2)). Rules of Court, rule 3.1362 requires:
1.
Notice of motion and motion to be directed to the client (made on the Notice of
Motion and Motion to be Relieved as Counsel Civil form (MC-051)); 
 
2. A
declaration stating in general terms, and without compromising the
confidentiality of the attorney client relationship, why a motion under Code of
Civil Procedure section 284(2), is brought instead of filing a consent under
CCP §284(1) (made on the Declaration in Support of Attorney's Motion to Be
Relieved as Counsel Civil form (MC-052)); 
 
3. Service
of the notice of motion and motion and declaration on all other parties who
have appeared in the case; and 
 
4. The
proposed order relieving counsel (prepared on the Order Granting Attorney's
Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel Civil form (MC-053)). 
 
The motion should be denied if withdrawal would prejudice the
client.  (Rules Prof. Conduct, Rule 3-700(A)(2); Weil & Brown, Cal.
Prac. Guide: Civ. Pro. Before Trial, 9:385.2 (2008); 1 Witkin Cal. Pro.,
Attorneys §72 (2008).) The motion should be denied if it will cause undue delay
in the proceeding or cause injustice.  (Mandell v. Superior Court,
(1977) 67 Cal.App.3d 1, 4.) The determination whether to grant or deny an
attorney’s motion to withdraw as counsel of record lies within the sound
discretion of the trial court, having in mind whether such withdrawal might
work an injustice in the handling of the case. (Lempert v. Superior Court
(2003) 112 Cal.App.4th 1161, 1173.)  A breakdown in the attorney-client
relationship (or personality clash) is grounds for withdrawal.  (Estate
of Falco (1987) 188 Cal.App.3d 1004, 1014.) An attorney is not limited to
withdrawing from a case for cause and may withdraw when withdrawal can be
accomplished without undue prejudice to the client. (Ramirez v. Sturdevant
(1994) 26 Cal.Rptr.2d 554, 559.)
 
B.     
Discussion
 
Here, Mr. Kiss has provided the Court with
all the required documents. Mr. Kiss has filed Judicial Council
Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion), MC-052 (Declaration), and MC-053
(Proposed Order). Counsel seeks to be relieved as counsel on the grounds that
the trust and confidence essential to the attorney-client relationship has
ceased to exist and irreconcilable difference have arisen between client and
attorney making it unreasonably difficult to carry out the employment
effectively. The Court finds this to be proper grounds for withdrawal. (See
Estate of Falco (1987) 188 Cal.App.3d 1004, 1014 (a breakdown in the
attorney-client relationship is grounds for allowing the attorney to
withdraw).)¿ 
 
However, the final
status conference and non-jury trial of this case is set for March 10, 2025 and
March 26, 2025 respectively. As of the date of the hearing on the instant
motion, these dates are only about two months away. Due to the potentially high
risk of prejudice to Plaintiff, the Court cannot grant the instant motion. If
the attorney-client relationship has deteriorated as Mr. Kiss claims,
Plaintiff, as a client, must find new counsel and formally file a Substitution
of Attorney form (MC-050), in order for current counsel to withdraw.
