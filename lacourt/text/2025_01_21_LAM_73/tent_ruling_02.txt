MOTION TO STRIKE DOE 1 AND 2 AS DEFENDANTS
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
The Motion to Strike Doe 1 and 2 as Defendants
is DENIED. 
 
I. BACKGROUND
 
On
August 23, 2023, Plaintiff Katherine Averilla filed the instant action against
Defendant ASN Long Beach Nephro Care LLC (“ASN”), and Does 1 to 50, inclusive,
asserting the following causes of action:
 
1.      Retaliation
in Violation of Labor Code §1102.5; 
2.      Wrongful
Termination In Violation Of Public Policy; 
3.      Violation
Of Labor Code Section 1198.5; 
4.      Unpaid
Wages (Labor Code § 202); 
5.      Failure
To Pay Overtime (Labor Code §§ 510, 1194); 
6.      Failure
To Provide Rest Periods (Labor Code §226.7); 
7.      Failure
To Provide Off-Duty Meal Period (Labor Code §§ 226.7, 512);
8.      Failure
To Furnish Accurate Wage Statements (Labor Code §§ 226, 226.3, 1174, 1174.5);
and 
9.      Waiting
Time Penalties (Labor Code §§ 226, 226.3)
 
The
Complaint alleges the following. In 2022, Plaintiff was hired by Defendant as
an acute dialysis coordinator. Plaintiff began asking for proper payment of
wages, mandatory breaks, and time off. However, instead of doing those things
and remedying violations of company policy as reported by Plaintiff, Defendant
fired Plaintiff. Defendants discriminated and retaliated against Plaintiff
solely because of her race, age, and attempt to obtain her proper pay.
 
On
September 25, 2023, ASN filed its Answer.  
 
On
December 6, 2023, Plaintiff amended the Complaint to substitute “Ngoc-Tram Gia
Tran” and “Sapna Patel, MD” for the defendants sued fictitiously as Does 1 and
2, respectively (collectively, the “Doe Defendants”).
 
On
December 31, 2024, ASN filed the instant motion to strike the Doe Defendants,
arguing that the amendment substituting
the defendants was improper for the following reasons:
 
·       Code of Civil Procedure section 474 required
Plaintiff to substitute the Doe Defendants upon learning about their
identities. 
·       Plaintiff knew about the Doe Defendants as early as
September 2023. 
·       Yet Plaintiff waited until December 6, 2023, to
substitute them. 
·       In addition, at the January 11, 2024 Case Management
Conference (“CMC”), the Court instructed Plaintiff to amend the Complaint to
name the Doe Defendants and personally serve them. 
·       However, Plaintiff did not serve the Doe Defendants
until December 19, 2024, over a year after she knew their identities. Moreover,
Plaintiff did not serve 
·       Plaintiff’s
delay not only violated Code of Civil Procedure section 474, but also
prejudiced the Doe Defendants because the defendants did not have adequate
notice to prepare their defense in time for the trial scheduled on January 21,
2025.
·       Plaintiff’s
delay was not due to ignorance but rather a calculated strategy to prejudice
the Doe Defendants’ ability to defend themselves. 
·       Therefore,
the Court should strike the untimely amendment. 
 
On January
13, 2025, Plaintiff filed her opposition to the motion, arguing the following. 
 
·       None
of the Doe Defendants have joined or yet appeared in this action or motion, yet
ASN asks the Court to strike the Doe Defendants. 
·       ASN’s
arguments are unpersuasive. 
·       First, Code of Civil Procedure section 474 only
required Plaintiff to have ignorance of the facts giving rise to the claim; the
statute did not require Plaintiff to have only the knowledge of the defendants’
identities to obtain leave to amend. 
o   Here, Plaintiff did not become aware that the Doe
Defendants were liable under Labor Code section 558 until ASN’s counsel
confirmed their liability. 
o   Once Plaintiff obtained the facts forming the basis
of liability, Plaintiff timely sought the doe amendment. 
·       Second, at the CMC on January 11, 2024, the Court
did not issue an order requiring Plaintiff to serve the Doe Defendants by a
certain date. 
·       Third, Plaintiff is not prohibited from serving the
Doe Defendants now and ASN has not offered any authority precluding Plaintiff from
seeking leave to amend at any time, even during trial. Moreover, the Doe
Defendants have been served.
·       Therefore, the Court should deny the motion. 
 
No
reply has been filed. 
 
II. ANALYSIS
 
A.      Legal
Standard for [Motion]
 
“The court may, upon a motion made pursuant to Section
435, or at any time in its discretion, and upon terms it deems proper: ¶ (a)
Strike out any irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading.
¶ (b) Strike out all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in
conformity with the laws of this state, a court rule, or an order of the court.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 436, subds. (a)-(b).) 
 
B.      Meet
and Confer
 
“Before filing a motion to strike …, the moving party
shall meet and confer in person or by telephone with the party who filed the
pleading that is subject to the motion to strike for the purpose of determining
if an agreement can be reached that resolves the objections to be raised in the
motion to strike.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 435.5, subd. (a).)
 
The Court finds the meet and confer requirement
satisfied. (See Declaration of Roxanne C. Bonar, ¶¶ 7-8 [testifying that the
parties met and conferred].)
 
C.     
Request to Strike Doe Defendants
 
“Code of Civil Procedure
section 474, the fictitious name statute, states in part: ‘When the plaintiff
is ignorant of the name of a defendant, he must state that fact in the
complaint ... and such defendant may be designated in any pleading or
proceeding by name, and when his true name is discovered, the pleading or
proceeding must be amended accordingly ....’” (Fuller v. Tucker (2000) 84
Cal.App.4th 1163, 1170 (“Fuller”).)
 
“The phrase ‘ignorant of the
name of a defendant’ is broadly interpreted to mean not only ignorant of the
defendant’s identity, but also ignorant of the facts giving rise to a cause of
action against that defendant.” (Fuller, supra, 84 Cal.App.4th at p. 1170.) “‘[S]ection 474 does
not impose upon the plaintiff a duty to go in search of facts she does not
actually have at the time she files her original pleading. [Citation.]’
[Citation.]” (Id. at p. 1172.)
 
Here, Plaintiff argues that
she did not substitute the Doe Defendants until December 6, 2023, because it
was not until that time that she became aware of the facts giving rise to her claims
against the Doe Defendants. (See Opposition, p. 2:15-21 [arguing that Plaintiff
is asserting wage and hour claims against the defendants. In or about December
2023, ASN’s counsel stated that the company was wholly owned by the Doe
Defendants. Since Labor Code section 558.1 holds owners liable for wage and
hour violations, Plaintiff substituted in the Doe Defendants].) 
 
“In order for [a party] to
successfully argue that [a] Doe amendment was untimely, [that party] ha[s] to
prove that even if [plaintiff] knew [the doe’s] identity, [the plaintiff] also
knew facts giving rise to a cause of action against [the doe defendant].” (Fuller,
supra,
84 Cal.App.4th at p. 1173.)
 
Here, ASN has not filed a
reply disputing Plaintiff’s claim that she learned of relevant facts in or
about December 2023. In addition, the Court has reviewed its Minute Order from
the CMC on January 11, 2024, and notes
that the Court did not give Plaintiff a deadline to serve the Doe Defendants. 
 
Therefore, there is no
evidence that Plaintiff unduly delayed in making the doe amendment. 
 
An “amendment relates back to
the filing of the original complaint unless the newly named defendant can show
actual prejudice resulting from unreasonable delay in filing the amendment.” (Hazel v. Hewlett (1988) 201 Cal.App.3d 1458, 1466.)
 
Here, the motion argues that
the Doe Defendants have been prejudiced because they were served too close to
the January 21, 2025 trial date. However, at the Final Status Conference on
January 6, 2025, the Court vacated the January 21, 2025, date and set a Trial
Setting Conference to take place on that date instead.
 
Therefore, the Court finds
that the amendment has not prejudiced the Doe Defendants.
 
For those reasons, the motion
is denied. 
 
III. DISPOSITION
 
The Motion to Strike Doe 1 and 2 as Defendants
is DENIED.
