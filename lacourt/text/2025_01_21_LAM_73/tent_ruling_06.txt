Motion for Leave to File First Amended
Complaint (filed 12/26/2024)
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
Plaintiffs’ Motion for Leave to File First Amended Complaint is GRANTED.
 
I. BACKGROUND
 
On February 26, 2024, plaintiff Jennifer Hernandez (Plaintiff)
filed her initial complaint against Stanley Fineman (Stanley), Allan Fineman
(Allan),[1] (collectively, Defendants) and Does 1 through 25. (Compl. p. 1.) She
claimed the following: (1) Failure to Pay Minimum Wages in Violation of Labor
Code §§ 1194 and 1197, (2) Failure to Pay Overtime Wages in Violation of the
Domestic Worker Bill of Rights (Labor Code §§ 1454 and 1194), (3) Violation of
Labor Code §§ 202 and 203, and (4) Violation of Business & Professions Code
§ 17200. (Compl. p. 1.)
 
These causes of action arise from events that occurred after
Defendants hired Plaintiff in March 2017 to provide daytime caregiving services
to Stanley. (Compl. ¶ 6.) Around June 2018, Defendants hired Plaintiff to work
as a live-in caregiver for 24 hours, 7 days a week. (Compl. ¶ 6.) That year, Allan
and his two teenagers moved into the home. (Compl. ¶ 8.) Allan made her clean
up after them, forcing her to take on additional responsibilities. (Compl. ¶ 9.)
Plaintiff claims Allan controlled her breaks and ability to leave the house,
because he had to be there to relieve her of her duties. (Compl. ¶ 10.) In
addition, Plaintiff claims she was given “$900 every 15 days,” or “$2.50 per
hour for the 360 hours [she] worked during the 15-day period.” (Compl. ¶ 11.)
 
During discovery and in Allan’s response to Form
Interrogatory-Employment No. 200.4, Allan claimed he was in a romantic
relationship with Plaintiff during her employment. (Haunt Decl. ¶ 3.) Allan
also produced recordings and texts showing evidence of abuse. (Haunt Decl. ¶
4.) Plaintiff’s counsel, Attorney Kelly M. Haunt (Haunt), states she was not
aware of the abusive behavior before filing the Complaint. (Haunt Decl. ¶ 5.) Defendants
sent over their discovery responses on July 1, 2024, August 6, 2024, and August
9, 2024. (Haunt Decl. ¶ 2.)
 
Haunt and another attorney asked Plaintiff about the relationship
and possible abuse. (Haunt Decl. ¶ 4.) After several months and coming to terms
with the abuse, Plaintiff opened up, explaining how the relationship turned
sexual in the later part of 2017 and later “toxic.” (Haunt Decl. ¶¶ 5-6.) From
the start of her employment, Allan would walk around the house, her place of
employment, naked. (Haunt Decl. ¶ 7.) Allan would later pressure Plaintiff into
sexual acts while working and would not stop until she gave in to his requests.
(Haunt Decl. ¶¶ 5-6.) If Plaintiff refused, Allan “would either start an
argument, ignore her or would make sure that her paycheck was [delayed].”
(Haunt Decl. ¶ 8.) Allan would also call Plaintiff degrading names. (Haunt
Decl. ¶ 9.) Haunt intends to include these facts and related causes of actions
in the First Amended Complaint. (Haunt Decl. ¶ 14.)
 
Defendants’ discovery responses also notified Haunt that Stanley
passed away on September 22, 2024. (Haunt Decl. ¶ 12.) Haunt intends to amend
the First Amended Complaint to include his passing. (Haunt Decl. ¶ 12.)
 
In addition, after filing the Complaint, Haunt discovered Los
Angeles Municipal Code sections 187.02 and 188.07 are applicable to the wage
theft facts. (Haunt Decl. ¶ 13.) Haunt intends to bring these as an additional
claim. (Haunt Decl. ¶ 13.)
 
On November 22, 2024, Haunt contacted Defendants’ counsel,
Attorney John Bussman (Bussman), about filing the First Amended Complaint.
(Haunt Decl. ¶ 14.)  Bussman said he
would need to speak with Allan first. (Haunt Decl. ¶ 14.) Haunt would follow up
on November 26, December 2, December 6, and December 18. (Haunt Decl. ¶ 14.) On
December 18, 2024, Bussman said “he know[s] [Allan] will not stipulate to amend
the complaint.” (Haunt Decl. ¶ 14.) Haunt filed this motion in response.
 
On December 26, 2024, Plaintiff filed this Motion for Leave to File First Amended
Complaint, arguing:
·               
Under the California Code of Civil
Procedure section 473, subdivision (a)(1), the Court should grant Plaintiff’s
leave to file the First Amended Complaint. (Motion p. 2.)
·               
Policy favors granting amendments. (Mesler
v. Bragg Mgmt. Co. (1985) 39 Cal. 3d 290, 296.)
·               
Leave to amend a complaint will be
denied when there was an unreasonable delay in seeking leave, and granting
leave would prejudice the defendant. (A.N. v. Cnty. of Los Angeles
(2009) 171 Cal.App.4th 1058, 1068.) 
·               
Here, Plaintiff did not unreasonably delay
in bringing this motion. (Motion p. 6.) Haunt communicated her intent to amend
the complaint shortly after her conversation with Plaintiff. (Motion p. 6.) Plaintiff
delayed in bringing this motion, because she was waiting for Defendants to
stipulate to the amendment. (Motion p. 6.)
·               
In addition, Defendants will not be
prejudiced by the amendment, because “[t]he type of unfair surprise or
additional costs that can occur when leave is sought immediately before, or
during, trial just do not exist here.” (Motion p. 7.) The new causes of action
and facts alleged are related to the facts found in the original Complaint.
(Motion p. 7.) Everything stems from Plaintiff’s employment under the
Defendants. (Motion p. 7.)
·               
According to Morgan v. Superior Court
(1959) 172 Cal.App.2d 527, 531, Plaintiff can expand the scope of a complaint
and add legal theories if discovery is still open. (Motion p. 6.)
 
In opposition, Defendants argue that:
·               
Defendants believe granting leave to
amend the Complaint will prejudice their rights. (Opp. p. 3.) For this reason,
the motion should be denied. (Opp. p. 3.)
·               
Plaintiffs proposed amended complaint “moves
the goalposts” after Defendants provided a potential defense in their discovery
responses. (Opp. p. 4.) Defendants claim Plaintiff should have “been aware of
any alleged sexual impropriety at the time she filed her initial complaint.”
(Opp. p. 4.) Plaintiff only files for leave and attempts to completely change
her complaint in response to Defendant’ possible defenses. (Opp. pp. 4-5.)
·               
The delay is unreasonable, because Plaintiff
asks for the amendment eleven months after filing. (Opp. p. 4.) Defendants
believe, according to A.N. v. City of Los Angeles, 171 Cal.App.4th 1058,
“[a]llowing Plaintiff to seek leave after an unreasonable delay of nearly a
year would prejudice defendant in the instant case.” (Opp. p. 4.)
In reply, Plaintiff argues:
·               
Defendants’ newly asserted “defense” was
not the deciding factor in the filing of this motion. (Reply p. 2.) Allan’s
discovery responses and abuse prompted the necessity for asserting additional
claims. (Reply p. 3.)
·               
Plaintiff did not have to be “aware of
any alleged sexual impropriety at the time that she filed her initial
complaint, but she strategically opted to omit those allegations.” (Reply p.
3.) Plaintiff was still processing her trauma. (Reply p. 3.) In addition, there
was no strategic benefit to bringing these claims now rather than in the
initial Complaint. (Reply p. 4.) 
·               
Defendants will not be prejudiced by the
amended Complaint. Plaintiff has not moved the goalpost but is exerting a claim
that arose from discovery. (Reply p. 4.) Additionally, this case will not
likely be ready for trial by September 2025 due to Stanley’s death. (Reply p.
4.) Defendants have not initiated probate or trust claim procedures. (Reply p.
4.)
·               
Defendants do not cite any statute or
case law that shows amending the complaint with nine months left before trial
is prejudicial.  (Reply p. 4.) Defendants
incorrectly interpret A.E v. City of Los Angeles, (2007) 171 Cal.App.4th
1154.
·               
Delay alone is not a basis to deny a
motion for leave to amend. (Higgins v. Del Faro (1981) 123 Cal.App.3d
558, 564-565.)
II. ANALYSIS
 
A.      Legal
Standard for Motion for Leave to Amend Complaint
 
The trial
court has discretion to allow amendments to pleadings in the furtherance of
justice. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (a)(1).) Any judge, at any time before
or after commencement of trial, in the furtherance of justice, and upon such
terms as may be proper, may allow the amendment of any pleading. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 576.) There is a policy of great liberality in permitting amendments
to the pleadings at any stage of the proceeding. (Berman v. Bromberg (1997)
56 Cal.App.4th 936, 945.) An application to amend a pleading is addressed to
the trial judge’s sound discretion. (Ibid.) A judge may deny a motion
for leave to amend where a moving party has been dilatory in seeking leave to
amend and such delay has prejudiced the opposing party. (Hirsa v. Superior
Court (1981) 118 Cal.App.3d 486, 490.) “It is difficult to understand how
[a named defendant] can be prejudiced by amendment to add an additional theory
of liability against it.” (Ibid.) 
 
If the party
seeking the amendment has been dilatory, and the delay has prejudiced the
opposing party, the Court has the discretion to deny leave to amend.  (Hirsa
v. Superior Court, supra, 118 Cal.App.3d at p. 490.)  Prejudice
exists where the amendment would require delaying the trial, resulting in loss
of critical evidence, or added costs of preparation due to the reopening of
discovery.  (Magpali v. Farmers Group, Inc.
(1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 471, 486-488 [“Where the trial date is set, the jury
is about to be impaneled, counsel, the parties, the trial court, and the
witnesses have blocked the time, and the only way to avoid prejudice to the
opposing party is to continue the trial date to allow further discovery,
refusal of leave to amend cannot be an abuse of discretion.”].) 
 
A motion for
leave to amend must include a separate declaration specifying: (1) the effect
of the amendment; (2) why the amendment is necessary and proper; (3) when the
facts giving rise to the amended allegations were discovered; and (4) the
reasons why the request for amendment was not made earlier. (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1324(b).) A motion for leave to amend must include a copy of the
proposed amendment or amended pleading. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1324(a)(1).) Moreover, a motion to amend must state what allegations in the
previous pleading are proposed to be deleted or added, if any, and must set
forth the page, paragraph, and line number of such allegations. (Cal. Rules of
Court, rules 3.1324(a)(2)-(3).)  
 
B.      Discussion
 
1.                 
Procedural
Compliance
 
Plaintiff’s
declaration in support of the motion satisfies the requirements under the
California Rules of Court (CRC), rule 3.1324(b).  Plaintiff identifies the
amendments, their effect, why they are necessary and proper, when the facts
giving rise to the amendments were discovered, and the reason why the request
for amendment was not made earlier. (Haunt Decl. ¶¶ 6-14.) 
 
Plaintiff
intends to add the following causes of action: “6) Violation of Los Angeles
Municipal Code §§ 187.02, 188.07; 7) Sexual Harassment – Hostile Work
Environment in Violation of FEHA; 8) Sexual Harassment – Quid Pro Quo in
Violation of FEHA; 9) Work Environment Harassment in Violation of FEHA; 10)
Discrimination on the Basis of Sex – Disparate Impact in Violation of FEHA; 11)
Retaliation in Violation of FEHA; 12) Wrongful Termination (Constructive
Discharge) in Violation of Public Policy; 13) Intentional Infliction of
Emotional Distress; 14) Battery; 15) Assault.” (Haunt Decl. ¶ 14.) Plaintiff
also intends to include the facts she learned after receiving Defendants’
discovery responses as discussed above. (Haunt Decl. ¶ 14.) The amendments’
effects are to add ten new causes of action and allege additional facts. (Haunt
Decl. ¶ 14.) 
 
Plaintiff’s
amendments are necessary and proper, because Steven’s death, Plaintiff coming
to terms with the abuse, and Haunt finding an additional cause of action all
occurred after Plaintiff filed her Complaint and/or received Defendants’
discovery responses. (Haunt Decl. ¶¶ 5, 13, 14.) Through Defendants’ discovery
responses, Haunt learned Steven passed away on September 22, 2024. (Haunt
Decl. ¶ 5.) Steven’s death came after Plaintiff filed her Complaint on
February 26, 2024. Regarding the abuse, “Plaintiff was coming to terms with the
fact that [Allan’s] treatment of her was abnormal, abusive and illegal, and it
took many conversations for her to open up and tell us her story.” (Haunt Decl.
¶ 5.) Allan’s discovery responses prompted Plaintiff to believe Allan had abused
her. (Haunt Decl. ¶¶ 3, 5.) Concerning the additional wage violation cause
of action, Haunt did not discover the local municipal code until after
Plaintiff had filed her Complaint. (Haunt Decl. ¶ 13.) For these reasons, Plaintiff
must now file to amend the complaint.
 
As discussed
above, Haunt did not learn of the facts giving rise to the amendments until after
she had filed the Complaint and/or received Defendants’ discovery responses on July
1, 2024, August 6, 2024, and August 9, 2024. (Haunt Decl. ¶¶ 2-5, 13, 14.)
 
Plaintiff did
not request the amendments earlier, because Haunt and Bussman were discussing a
stipulation to amend the Complaint. (Haunt Decl. ¶ 14.)  Bussman said he would need to speak with Allan
first. (Haunt Decl. ¶ 14.) Haunt followed up on November 26, December 2,
December 6, and December 18. (Haunt Decl. ¶ 14.) On December 18, 2024, Bussman
said that “he know[s] [Allan] will not stipulate to amend the complaint.”
(Haunt Decl. ¶ 14.) At that point, Haunt moved to amend the complaint.
 
Accordingly,
the Court finds that Plaintiff satisfies the procedural requirement under the California Rules of Court, rule 3.1324(b).
 
Plaintiff
also meets the procedural requirements under the California Rules of Court,
rules 3.1324(a)(1)-(3). Plaintiff’s motion for leave provides two copies of the
proposed First Amended Complaint. (Haunt Decl. ¶¶ 15, 16, Exhs. 1-2.) The first
copy in Exhibit 1 is the “red-lined” version, which shows what allegations in
the Complaint are to be deleted or added. (Haunt Decl. ¶¶ 15, 16, Exhs. 1-2.) Plaintiff
also provides an Appendix of Proposed Changes, setting forth the page,
paragraph, and line number of the amendments. (Motion pp. 9-10.) Thus,
Plaintiff satisfies the procedural requirements under the California Rules of
Court, rules 3.1324(a)(1)-(3).
 
Accordingly,
the Court finds that Plaintiff satisfies all procedural requirements.
 
2.                 
Prejudice
 
Defendants
contend that granting leave to amend the Complaint will prejudice their rights.
(Opp. p. 3.) Defendants allege that Plaintiff is moving goalposts by adding
additional causes of action eleven months after filing the Complaint. (Opp. p.
3-4.) Defendants do not explain how amending the Complaint will cause them
prejudice. 
 
Allowing
Plaintiff to file a First Amended Complaint at this stage would not result in
undue prejudice to Defendants. A court can find prejudice when granting leave
to amend would delay the trial, result in the loss of critical evidence, or increase
the costs of preparation due to the reopening of discovery. (Magpali v.
Farmers Group, Inc., supra, 48 Cal.App.4th at pp. 486-488.) None of
those situations apply here. Trial is set for September 22, 2023. (Motion p.
3.) Defendants have over seven months to conduct discovery so there is no need
to delay trial, risk critical evidence, or reopen discovery if the motion is
granted. In addition, Plaintiff has discussed why she waited to bring the
motion until this time and why she wishes to expand the scope of discovery. It
is not to move the goalpost. Thus, granting leave to
amend the Complaint will not cause prejudice. 
 
Based
on the foregoing, the Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s Motion for Leave to File First Amended
Complaint.

 
III. DISPOSITION
 
The Court GRANTS Plaintiff leave to file the First
Amended Complaint submitted in connection with the Motion, and the First
Amended Complaint is deemed filed and served as of January 21, 2025.
