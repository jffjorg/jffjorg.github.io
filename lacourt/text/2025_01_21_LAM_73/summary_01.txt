And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of The Machine Group, Inc. v. NC Dynamics, LLC. The ruling concerns a demurrer and motion to strike filed by Nidec OKK USA Corporation, a cross-defendant in the case. The demurrer and motion to strike were filed in response to NC Dynamics' second amended cross-complaint, which alleges breach of contract, fraud, and other claims.

The judge has denied the demurrer and motion to strike as moot, as NC Dynamics has filed a third amended cross-complaint in response. The judge notes that a party may amend its pleading once without leave of the court at any time before the answer, demurrer, or motion to strike is filed, or after a demurrer or motion to strike is filed but before the demurrer or motion to strike is heard.

The judge's ruling is based on the legal standard that a demurrer is an objection to a pleading, the grounds for which are apparent from either the face of the complaint or a matter of which the court may take judicial notice. The judge has also considered the relevant California Code of Civil Procedure and California Rules of Court.

The judge's tentative ruling will be taken under submission until the hearing date, January 21, 2025.
