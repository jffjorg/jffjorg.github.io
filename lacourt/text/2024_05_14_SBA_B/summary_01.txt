And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling is a continuation of the motion to be relieved as counsel by plaintiff's attorney Ryan Jackman, Esq. The court has granted the motion to be continued to allow counsel to make further efforts to confirm the client's address. The court finds that the attorney's declaration is insufficient as to efforts to confirm the client's address, as the attorney only called and emailed but received no response. The court orders that the motion be continued to allow counsel to show further efforts to confirm the client's address and to file a supplemental declaration.
