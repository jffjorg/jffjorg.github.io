And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion filed by Plaintiff Camila Morais' counsel, Hesam Yazdanpanah, to be relieved as counsel for the plaintiff. The motion was filed due to a loss of communication with the client, who has not responded to phone calls or communications and cannot be located with the contact information on file. The court finds this a valid reason for withdrawal, but notes that the proposed order contains errors and is incomplete. The court orders Counsel to file an amended form MC-053 within 5 calendar days of the hearing, which should include information about all future hearings and proceedings noticed by any party or ordered by the court. Counsel must also serve the signed order within 10 days of the date of the order and file a proof of service. The court conditionally grants the motion pending Counsel's filing and service of the updated form.
