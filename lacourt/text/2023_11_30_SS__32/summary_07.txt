And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling is regarding a motion to be relieved as counsel for the plaintiffs, Alejandra Guzman, Miguel Angel Moto, Jr., and Joanna Guzman, by their current counsel, Jason Shamtoob. The motion states that the counsel and the plaintiffs have irreconcilable differences regarding continuing the litigation. However, the counsel has not filed proof of service as to all plaintiffs, and the declaration does not specify which plaintiff or that the differences are as to all plaintiffs.

The court will deny the motion to be relieved as counsel because the counsel has not complied with the procedures set forth in California Rule of Professional Conduct (CRPC) 3.700. The court also finds that the counsel's withdrawal would work injustice upon a third party. The court orders the counsel to provide notice of this order and file a proof of service of such.
