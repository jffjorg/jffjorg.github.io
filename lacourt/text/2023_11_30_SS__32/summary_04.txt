Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the Defendant's motion to compel discovery responses from the Plaintiff. The Defendant, Super Garden Centers, Inc., moves for orders compelling a physical inspection of the Plaintiff's shoes, responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One, Supplemental Interrogatories, Set One, Requests for Production Set One and Two, and Supplemental Request for Production, Set One. The Plaintiff, Kym Whitley, has failed to serve timely responses to the discovery requests, and the Defendant has not provided any opposition to the motion.

The Court grants the motions to compel, ordering the Plaintiff to serve verified responses and produce the shoes for inspection within 30 days. The Court also awards monetary sanctions against the Plaintiff and her counsel in the amount of $255 (1 hour of attorney time plus the filing fee).

The Court notes that each motion to compel is a separate motion, for which a separate filing fee is required, and admonishes counsel to comply with the court rules in the future.
