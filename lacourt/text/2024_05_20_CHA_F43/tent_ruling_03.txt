SUMMARY OF
ACTION
Plaintiff Ally
Bank (Plaintiff) is the holder of a contract whereby Defendants purchased from
Plaintiff’s assignor a 2017 FRHT Cascadia 125 motor vehicle. The Contract is in
default and the balance due and owing on the contract is $43,826.59. 
 
Plaintiff seeks
possession of the vehicle, with Plaintiff having filed the application for writ
of possession on January 22, 2024. Plaintiff filed proofs of service on
February 5, 2024, indicating that Defendants were served notice of the hearing via
substituted service on January 30, 2024.
 
ANALYSIS
Upon a showing
of the probable validity of a plaintiff’s right to possession of the property
claimed, a writ of possession shall be issued, subject to any possible bond or
undertaking. (CCP § 512.060.) The claim has probable validity “where it is more
likely than not that the plaintiff will obtain a judgment against the defendant
on that claim.” (CCP § 511.090.) Once the requirements for issuance of the writ
are met, CCP § 512.070 authorizes an order directing the defendant to transfer
possession of the property to plaintiff. When necessary, the Court may take
additional oral and documentary evidence at the claim and delivery hearing.
(CCP § 512.050.)
 
Plaintiff has
met the requirements set forth in the CCP for an application for writ of
possession. Plaintiff has established that it would likely obtain a judgment
based on the declaration and evidence submitted by Plaintiff that Defendants
are in default on their payments under the contract. Plaintiff is entitled to
possession of the vehicle given Defendants’ failure to pay. However, Plaintiff
will need to obtain oral evidence from Defendants at the hearing regarding the
location of the vehicle. Good cause exists for a brief examination of Defendants.
 
 The Court issues the writ of possession and
directs transfer of the vehicle, pending Plaintiff obtaining the location of
the vehicle at the hearing.
