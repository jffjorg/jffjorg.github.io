MOVING PARTY: Cross-Defendant
Coldwell Banker Residential Brokerage Company
RESPONDING
PARTY: Plaintiff Sergey Vershinin
 
RELIEF
REQUESTED
An Order compelling
Plaintiff’s responses to special interrogatories, as well as sanctions.
 
RULING: Cross-Defendant’s
motion to compel responses to special interrogatories is granted.
 
SUMMARY OF
ACTION
On November 3,
2023, Cross-Defendant Coldwell Banker Residential Brokerage Company (Coldwell) served
Plaintiff Sergey Vershinin (Plaintiff) with Special Interrogatories, Set One. On
December 4, 2023, one day before Plaintiff’s responses were due, Plaintiff’s
attorney requested a three week extension. Coldwell’s counsel denied the
request because of the upcoming deadline for a motion for summary judgment. The
next day, Plaintiff served unverified responses to all of Coldwell’s discovery
requests, including the special interrogatories. Coldwell’s counsel attempted
to get the verified responses through the meet and confer process, but
Plaintiff’s counsel never sent them, despite her indicating that she would
provide the verified responses within two weeks. Coldwell’s counsel indicates
that Plaintiff’s counsel told her that there had been a breakdown in
communication between her and Plaintiff. 
 
Coldwell filed
this motion to compel responses to special interrogatories on April 18, 2024. Coldwell
seeks verified, code-compliant answers to the special interrogatories. Coldwell
has also requested sanctions in the amount of $3,250 against Plaintiff and/or
his counsel of record.
 
Plaintiff’s
opposition was filed on May 6, 2024. Plaintiff’s only argument against
Coldwell’s motion is that it was filed late and should have been filed within
45 days of service of Plaintiff’s responses.
 
Coldwell argues
in its reply that its motion was timely because it is not seeking to compel
further responses; rather, it is seeking to compel responses because
Plaintiff’s lack of verified responses amounted to no responses at all.
 
ANALYSIS
The propounding
party may move for an order compelling responses and monetary sanctions if a
party to whom the interrogatories are directed fails to respond. (CCP §§
2030.290, 2030.300; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific
Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 404.) Responses to
interrogatories are due within thirty days from the date of service of the
interrogatories. (CCP §§ 2030.260(a), 2016.050.) The responding party waives
any objections to the interrogatories by failing to serve responses in a timely
manner. (CCP § 2030.290(a).)
 
Answers to the
interrogatories should be as complete and straightforward as possible. (CCP § 2030.220(a).)
If an objection is made to all or part of an interrogatory, the specific ground
for objection should be set forth clearly in the response. (CCP § 2030.240.)
 
Discovery
responses that are provided but are not verified are tantamount to no responses
at all. (Appleton v. Superior Ct. (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 632, 636.)
 
First,
Plaintiff’s responses to the interrogatories were unverified, so they amount to
no responses at all. The 45-day deadline from CCP § 2030.300(c) only applies if
verified responses were served, so Coldwell’s motion to compel was timely.
Next, Plaintiff’s responses do not comply with the CCP § 2030.210(a)
requirement that he respond to each request separately because Plaintiff
answered all 19 special interrogatories with the exact same objection. Finally,
Plaintiff’s unverified responses were not as complete and straightforward as
possible, as required by CCP § 2033.220.
 
Coldwell’s
motion to compel Plaintiff’s responses to Coldwell’s special interrogatories is
granted. Plaintiff must provide verified, code-compliant responses within 30
days. Plaintiff has also waived objections by failing to provide timely,
verified responses.
 
Sanctions
CCP § 2023.030
authorizes the Court to issue sanctions against a party engaging in conduct
that is a misuse of the discovery process. Failure to respond to discovery,
evasive responses, and objections lacking substantial justification are
“misuses of the discovery process.” (CCP § 2023.010, subd. (d)-(f).)
 
Coldwell has
requested sanctions in the amount of $3,250 against Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s
counsel of record for having to bring this motion. The amount was based on Coldwell’s
counsel spending 10 hours on the motion at $325 an hour. (Salinas-Mendoza Decl.,
¶ 12.) However, this motion is substantially similar to the motion to compel
responses to requests for admissions filed by Coldwell. The Court granted
sanctions in the amount of $1,950 for that motion. Because of the similarity
between the motions, that would be an appropriate amount for this motion, as
well.
 
Coldwell’s
request for sanctions against Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s counsel of record is
granted in the amount of $1,950.
 
ORDER
1.      Coldwell’s
motion to compel responses to the special interrogatories is granted. Plaintiff
must submit code-complaint, verified responses within 30 days.
2.      Plaintiff
and Plaintiff’s counsel of record are ordered to pay sanctions in the total
amount of $1,950. Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s counsel of record are ordered to
pay these sanctions to Coldwell’s counsel within thirty (30) days.
