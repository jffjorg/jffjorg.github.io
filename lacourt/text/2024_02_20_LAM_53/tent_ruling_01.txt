plaintiff’s motion for order for possession



 
MOVING PARTY:                 Plaintiff The People of the
State of California, acting by and through the Department of Transportation          
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Unopposed
Motion for Order for Possession
The court
considered the moving papers filed in connection with this motion.  No opposition papers were filed.
DISCUSSION
Plaintiff The People of the State of California, acting by and through
the Department of Transportation (“Plaintiff”), moves the court for an order
for possession of the property described in its Complaint as Parcel 81647-1 and
Parcel 81647-2 (collectively, the “Property”). 
“At the time of filing the complaint or at any time after filing the
complaint and prior to entry of judgment, the plaintiff may move the court for
an order for possession under this article, demonstrating that the plaintiff is
entitled to take the property by eminent domain and has deposited . . . an
amount that satisfies the requirements of that article.  [¶] 
The motion shall describe the property of which the plaintiff is seeking
to take possession, which description may be by reference to the complaint, and
shall state the date after which the plaintiff is seeking to take possession of
the property.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 1255.410, subd. (a).)  The motion
shall also include a statement in substantially the form set forth by statute,
which informs the served party that it has the right to oppose the motion, that
such an opposition must be served on the plaintiff and filed with the court
within 30 days from the date of service of the motion, and that if the opposing
party asserts hardship, it must be supported by a declaration stating facts in
support of the asserted hardship.  (Ibid.)

As a threshold matter, the court finds that Plaintiff has served all
the parties to this action.  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1255.410, subd. (b).) 
Plaintiff has presented evidence showing that (1) Plaintiff personally
served, on September 28, 2023, the pending motion and supporting papers on
defendants Blue Wolverines, LLC, Nuckles Oil Company, Inc., Van Dyk Tank Lines,
Inc., Southern California Edison Company, Landmark Infrastructure Holding Company,
Inc., LD Acquisition Company 12 LLC, California Water Service Group, Regency
Outdoor Advertising, Inc., and Enterprise Bank & Trust;[1]
(2) after being served with the pending motion, defendant Enterprise Bank &
Trust filed a Disclaimer of Interest, disclaiming interest or title in the Property
and therefore asserting that it has no right to participate in further
proceedings; (3) after service of this motion and on December 13, 2023, defendants
Landmark Infrastructure Holding Company, LLC and LD Acquisition Company 12 LLC
were dismissed; (4) after service of this motion and on January 25, 2024,
defendant Regency Outdoor Advertising, Inc. was dismissed; and (5) the
remaining defendants did not file opposition papers with the court 30 days from
the September 28, 2023 date of service. 
(Enterprise Bank & Trust Disclaimer of Interest filed October 11,
2023; Code Civ. Proc., § 1255.410, subd. (c) [“Not later than 30 days
after service of the plaintiff’s motion seeking to take possession of the
property, any defendant or occupant of the property may oppose the motion in
writing by serving the plaintiff and filing with the court the opposition”].)  
Further, on December 1, 2023, Plaintiff filed an Amendment to
Complaint, substituting defendant KBS Holdco, LLC, d/b/a Regency Outdoor
Advertising, Inc. (“KBS”) for the fictitious name of Doe 2.  Plaintiff served the motion and supporting
papers on “Regency Outdoor Advertising, Inc. and KBS Holdco, LLC[,]” i.e., the
entities described as KBS, on January 16, 2024. 
(Proof of Service filed Jan. 18, 2024.) 
KBS did not file an opposition within 30 days after service of this
motion (by February 15, 2024).  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 1255.410, subd. (b).) 
Because no opposition papers were filed, the court “shall make an
order for possession” of the subject property upon a finding that Plaintiff (1)
is entitled to take the property by eminent domain and (2) has deposited an
amount that satisfies the requirement of Article 1 (commencing with Section
1255.010).  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1255.410, subd. (d)(1).) 
First, the court finds that Plaintiff has shown that it is entitled to
take the Property by eminent domain.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1255.410,
subd. (d)(1)(A).) 
“The power of eminent domain may be exercised to acquire property for
a proposed project only if all of the following are established: [¶] (a) The
public interest and necessity require the project[;] [¶] (b) The project is
planned or located in the manner that will be most compatible with the greatest
public good and the least private injury[;] [¶] (c) The property sought to be
acquired is necessary for the project.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 1240.030.)  Further, “[a] public entity may not commence an eminent
domain proceeding until its governing body has adopted a resolution of
necessity that meets the requirements of this article.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 1245.220.)  Plaintiff’s governing body is the California
Transportation Commission.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1245.210, subd. (e)
[as used in the statutes, a governing body means, “[i]n the case of a taking by
the Department of Transportation . . ., the California Transportation
Commission”].)  The California Transportation Commission passed and
adopted Resolution of Necessity number C-22255 on March 23, 2023, declaring
that the Property at issue in this action is necessary for state highway
purposes.  (Farr Decl., ¶ 5; Farr Decl., Ex. A, Transportation
Commission Resolution No. C-22255, pp. 1:10-12, 3 [describing Parcel 81647-1],
4 [describing Parcel 81647-2]; Compl., ¶ 3 [describing the Property].) 
The court finds that Plaintiff has shown that it is entitled to take
the Property by eminent domain because (1) a resolution of necessity adopted by
a public entity’s governing property “conclusively establishes” the
requirements for an exercise of the power to acquire property,    (2) Plaintiff has shown that its governing
body, the California Transportation Commission adopted a resolution of
necessity as to the project concerning the Property, and therefore            (3) Plaintiff has shown that it may
exercise the power of eminent domain to acquire the Property for its
project.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1245.250, subd. (a), 1240.030.) 
Second, the court finds that Plaintiff has shown that it has deposited
an amount that satisfies the requirement of Article 1.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 1255.410, subd. (d)(1)(B).) 
Plaintiff has submitted (1) evidence showing that it deposited, on
July 12, 2023, with the State of Treasurer, the amount of $35,500, and (2) the
declaration of Bryan Tao, the Senior Right of Way Agent employed by the
Department of Transportation, who states that the opinion of the amount of
probable just compensation that will be awarded in this action is
$35,500.  (Choi Decl., Ex. A, Notice of Deposit and Summary of the Basis
for Appraisal, pp. 2-3; Choi Decl., “Ex. A” to Ex. A, Notice of Deposit and
Summary of the Basis for Appraisal [Appraisal Summary Statement for the
Property].) 
Third, the court finds that Plaintiff’s motion satisfies the
requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 1255.410, subdivision
(a).  The motion (1) describes the property of which Plaintiff is seeking
to take possession by referencing the detailed description set forth in its
Complaint, (2) states the date after which Plaintiff is seeking to take
possession of the Property (February 29, 2024), and (3) includes the language
regarding the requirements of any opposition in substantially the form set
forth by statute.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1255.410, subd. (a); Notice of
Mot., p. 2:14-17, 2:22-28; Memo., pp. 2:17-19, 6:3-5.)
The court therefore grants Plaintiff’s motion. 
ORDER
            The court grants plaintiff People of
the State of California’s motion for order for possession. 
            The court orders, pursuant to Code
of Civil Procedure section 1255.460, that plaintiff People of the State of
California may take possession of the real property described in paragraph 3 of
the Complaint filed by plaintiff People of the State of California on June 15,
2023, after February 29, 2024. 
            The court orders plaintiff People of
the State of California to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
