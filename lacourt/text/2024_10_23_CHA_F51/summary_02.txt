And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a personal injury action between Plaintiff Shirley Davila Ruano and Defendants Daysi Geromi Moran and Elmi Moran. The Plaintiff has filed motions to compel further responses to discovery requests, including special interrogatories and requests for admission. The Defendants have filed oppositions to these motions.

The judge has determined that the meet and confer requirement was not satisfied, as the parties' counsel did not have a meaningful discussion to resolve the outstanding discovery issues. As a result, the judge orders the parties' counsel to meet and confer again within 60 days to resolve and/or narrow the outstanding discovery issues. The Plaintiff's counsel is also ordered to file a declaration with the Court confirming compliance with this order or explaining why no meaningful meet and confer occurred.

The motions are continued pending further meet and confer.
