ordered to meet and further confer either telephonically or in-person within 60

BACKGROUND
 
This is a personal injury action in which Plaintiff alleges
that on 9/30/22, she was a passenger in a vehicle involved in an automobile
collision with a vehicle operated by defendant Daysi Geromi Moran (“Daysi”).
(Compl. pp. 4–5.) Defendant Elmi Moran (“Elmi”) allegedly entrusted the vehicle
to Daysi. (Id. at p. 4.)
 
On 2/29/24, Plaintiff filed her complaint, alleging against
Defendants a sole cause of action for Motor Vehicle Negligence. On 4/8/24,
Defendants filed their answers.
 
On 4/15/24, Plaintiff served Defendants with the subject
discovery requests. (Decl. of Karin Gharabighi ¶ 3.) On 5/22/24, Defendants
served their responses thereto. (Id. at ¶ 4.)
 
On 7/10/24, Plaintiff filed the instant motions to compel further
responses to the subject discovery requests. On 10/10/24, Defendants filed their
oppositions thereto. On 10/15/24, Plaintiff filed her replies.
 
 
Meet and Confer
 
A motion to compel further
discovery responses must be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration stating “facts showing a reasonable and good faith attempt at an
informal resolution of each issue presented by the motion.” (Code Civ. Proc. §§
2030.300, subd. (b)(1); 2033.290, subd. (b)(1); 2016.040.) 
 
Here, Plaintiff’s
counsel declares that on 6/25/24, she sent Defendants’ counsel meet-and-confer
letters raising the issues discussed herein. (Gharabighi Decl. ¶ 5.) On 7/1/24,
Defendants’ counsel responded. (Id. at ¶ 6.)
 
In
opposition, Defendants argue that “other than one exchange of letters briefly
discussing the issues, Plaintiff never contacted Defendant to further discuss
the issues” (Def. Daysi’s SPROG Opp. 5:22–23.) Plaintiff maintains that the
meet and confer requirement was satisfied, and that “a meet and confer
attempt do [sic] not require a party to pick up the phone to discuss issues or
send a separate email than the one where the letter was attached to satisfy the
meet and confer letter.” (Pl.’s Reply to Def. Dayski’s SPROG Opp. 3:17–19.)
 
The Court finds that the meet and
confer requirement was not satisfied here, as Defendants’ counsel’s response
letter invites clarification and further discussion. (Ex. 4 to Gharabighi Decl.) Based on
the foregoing, the Court orders counsel for the parties to meet and
further confer either telephonically or in-person within 60 days, to resolve
and/or narrow all outstanding discovery issues. Plaintiff’s counsel is to file
a declaration with the Court which confirms compliance with this order or
explains why no meaningful meet and confer occurred. The motions are therefore
continued pending further meet and confer.
 
CONCLUSION
 
The motions are continued. The
parties’ counsel are ordered to meet and further confer either telephonically
or in-person within 60 days, to resolve and/or narrow all outstanding discovery
issues. Plaintiff’s counsel is to file a declaration with the Court which
confirms compliance with this order or explains why no meaningful meet and
confer occurred.
