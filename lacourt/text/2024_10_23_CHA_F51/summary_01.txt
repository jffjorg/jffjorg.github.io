And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's unopposed motion to vacate the default judgment entered against her on April 25, 2024. The defendant argues that she was never personally served with the complaint and summons, and that the alleged service on January 22, 2024 is false. While the judge denies the defendant's request to quash the service of the summons and complaint, which was filed late, the judge finds that the defendant is entitled to relief from the default judgment based on her own mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. The defendant discovered the default judgment only when she directed her son to ask her attorney to check the case status, and she diligently took action to have her attorney contact the plaintiff's counsel and file the instant motion. The judge notes that the plaintiff has failed to oppose the motion, and that the law strongly favors trial and disposition on the merits. Therefore, the judge grants the defendant's motion to vacate the default judgment and allows her to file a proposed answer within 10 days.
