And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel discovery requests filed by defendant Jonathan Lopez. The motion seeks to compel plaintiff Devin Taylor to respond to discovery requests, including form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and requests for production of documents.

The judge grants the motion to compel responses to the form interrogatories and special interrogatories, finding that the plaintiff failed to respond to these requests in a timely manner. The judge also grants the motion to compel responses to five of the requests for production of documents.

The judge notes that the plaintiff's counsel has lost contact with the plaintiff and has not been able to obtain a response from the plaintiff to the discovery requests. The judge finds that sanctions are mandatory against the plaintiff for failing to respond to the discovery requests, but notes that the defendant has not requested sanctions and has not provided a specific monetary amount regarding each motion.

The judge concludes that the defendant's motion to compel discovery requests is granted in part, and that the plaintiff must respond to the discovery requests within a certain timeframe.
