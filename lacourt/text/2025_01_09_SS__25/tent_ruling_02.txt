ANALYSIS:
 
I.                   
Background

 
On March 11, 2024, Petitioner Sima S.
Alam (“Petitioner”) filed the instant Petition for Rejection of Award and
Request for Trial After Attorney-Client Fee Arbitration (the “Petition”). 
 
On July 15, 2024, the Court continued
the hearing on the Petition from July 15, 2024 to September 17, 2024, at
Petitioner’s request, to allow Petitioner “to be able to obtain legal
representation and to properly effectuate service on the [R]espondent.”
(7/15/25 Order, p. 1.) 
 
 On September 17, 2024, the Court continued the
hearing on the Petition from September 17, 2024 to November 19, 2024, at
Petitioner’s request, to allow Petitioner “time to cure the deficiencies
addressed by the Court in Its Tentative Ruling, and to continue to seek legal
representation is heard and granted.” (9/17/24 Order, p. 1.) The Court further
noted that “[t]he Petitioner is advised this is the final continuance.”
(9/17/24 Order, p. 1.) 
 
On November 6, 2024, the Court
continued the hearing from November 19, 2024 to January 9, 2025 due to the
Court’s unavailability and calendar congestion. (11/6/24 Order.) 
 
To date, no Opposition has been filed,
and Petitioner has failed to file any additional papers with the Court.
 
II.                
Legal
Standard & Discussion 
 
Business and Professions Code sections
6200-6206 (the Mandatory Fee Arbitration Act (“MFAA”)) requires that an
attorney arbitrate any fee disputes at the option of the client. (See Giorgianni
v. Crowley (2011) 197 Cal.App.4th 1462, 1472.) Under the MFAA, it is
presumed that an arbitration award will be nonbinding, unless the attorney and
client agree that it will be binding after the dispute has arisen. (See id.;
Bus. & Prof. Code, § 6204, subd. (a).) If the arbitration is not binding,
either party may request a trial de novo within 30 days after the arbitration
has concluded. (See Giorgianni, supra, 197 Cal.App.4th at 1472; Bus.
& Prof. Code, § 6204, subd. (a).) “Absent the filing of a timely rejection
and request for trial, the arbitration award becomes final.” (Giorgianni,
supra, 197 Cal.App.4th at 1473; see also Bus. & Prof. Code, § 6203,
subd. (b).) A party to an attorney-client fee arbitration may petition to
confirm, vacate, or correct an arbitration award in the same manner as
arbitration awards may be confirmed under Code of Civil Procedure sections 128,
et seq. of the California Arbitration Act. (See Bus. & Prof. Code, § 6203,
subd. (b); Giorgianni, supra, 197 Cal.App.4th at 1470.) 
 
Until an arbitration award is
confirmed by court judgment, it has only the effect of a contract between the
parties. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1287.6.) If a petition or response requesting
confirmation is duly filed and served, the court must confirm the award as
made, unless it corrects or vacates the award or dismisses the proceeding.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1286; see Pacific Law Group: U.S.A. v. Gibson (1992)
6 Cal.App.4th 577, 580.) Statutes set forth specific grounds upon which an
arbitrator’s award may be vacated. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1286.2.) Except on these
grounds, arbitration awards are immune from judicial review in proceedings to
challenge or enforce the award. (Moncharsh v. Heily & Blase (1992) 3
Cal.4th 1, 12-13.) Thus, courts will not review the sufficiency of the evidence
to support the award. (Morris v. Zuckerman (1968) 69 Cal.2d 686, 691.)
Nor will courts pass upon the validity of the arbitrator’s reasoning. (Ibid.)
The court simply may not substitute its judgment for that of the arbitrator. (Ibid.)
Further, errors of fact or law committed by the arbitrator, no matter how
egregious, are not grounds for challenging the arbitrator’s award under
California law. (Moncharsh, supra, 3 Cal.4th at p. 11.)
 
A party to an attorney-client fee
arbitration may petition to confirm, vacate, or correct an arbitration award in
the same manner as arbitration awards may be confirmed under Code of Civil Procedure sections 1285, et seq.
of the California Arbitration Act. (Bus. & Prof. Code, § 6203, subd. (b); Giorgianni,
supra, 197 Cal.App.4th at 1470.)
 
Here, Petitioner has failed to file
supplemental papers or correct the errors discussed at the previous hearing.
Thus, the Petition is still procedurally deficient. Petitioner has still not
attached a copy of the arbitration award and has still failed to provide any
notice of award.
 
            The
Court cautioned Petitioner at the last hearing on September 17, 2024, that no
more continuances to rectify the errors discussed by the Court would be given. 
 
            Accordingly,
the Petition is now DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.

Petitioner Sima S. Alam’s Petition to
Reject Arbitration Award and Request for Trial After Attorney-Client Fee
Arbitration is DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE. 
 
Moving party to give notice.
