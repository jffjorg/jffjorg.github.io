And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

This is a tentative ruling on a motion for assignment order filed by Creditor's Adjustment Bureau, Inc. against Health First Hospice, Inc. The motion seeks to assign payments to be made to the defendant by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and Noridian Healthcare Solutions, LLC (NHS) related to the defendant's National Provider Identifier (NPI).

The court notes that the judgment amount listed in the plaintiff's counsel's declaration is $38,451.54, rather than the amount of $22,494.95 stated in the default judgment entered on May 30, 2024.

The court finds that the motion is supported only by a declaration from the plaintiff's counsel on information and belief with no other supporting documentation. Therefore, the court is continuing the motion to February 27, 2025, and ordering the plaintiff to electronically file and serve a supplemental declaration supported by further evidence of the defendant's right to payments from CMS and NHS by February 5, 2025. Failure to do so may result in the motion being denied.
