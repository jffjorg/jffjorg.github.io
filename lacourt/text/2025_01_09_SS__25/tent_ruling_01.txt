ANALYSIS:
 
I.                   
Background

 
On December 19, 2023, Plaintiff
Creditors Adjustment Bureau, Inc. (“Plaintiff”) initiated this action against
Defendant Health First Hospice, Inc. aka Health First Hospice Inc.
(“Defendant”) and Does 1-10, alleging causes of action for Breach of Contract,
Open Book Account, Account Stated, and Reasonable Value. (Compl., p. 1.) 
 
            On May
9, 2024, default was entered against Defendant.
 
            On May
21, 2024, Plaintiff dismissed Does 1-10 without prejudice.
 
            On May
30, 2024, default judgment was entered against Defendant in the amount of $22,494.95,
reflecting damages of $19,110.40, prejudgment interest of $2,808.64, and costs
of $575.91.
 
On October 23, 2024, Plaintiff filed a
Notice of Motion and Motion for Assignment Order of Medicare Benefits Pursuant
to CCP 680.130, 42 CFR 424.73(b)(2), 424.80(b)(4), and 424.90 (the “Motion”). No
Opposition was filed.
 
On October 28, 2024, the Court issued
a Notice of Rejection – Post Judgment regarding Plaintiff’s Writ of Execution,
noting Plaintiff needed to correct the judgment debtor’s name on #4. 
 
Also on October 28, 2024, Plaintiff
filed the instant Amended Notice of Motion and Motion for Assignment Order of
Medicare Benefits Pursuant to CCP 680.130, 42 CFR 424.73(b)(2), 424.80(b)(4),
and 424.90 (the “Amended Motion”). To date, no Opposition has been filed.
 
On November 4, 2024, Plaintiff filed a
Memorandum of Costs After Judgment, Acknowledgment of Credit, and Declaration
of Accrued Interest. Plaintiff also filed a Writ of Execution.
 
II.                
Procedural
Issues
 
The Court notes the judgment amount
listed in Plaintiff’s counsel’s declaration is $38,451.54, rather than the
amount of $22,494.95 stated in the default judgment entered on May 30, 2024. (Amended
Motion, Frischer
Decl., ¶ 4; 5/30/24 Entry
of Default Judgment.) 
 
III.             
Legal
Standard 
 
Under Code of Civil Procedure,
section 708.510, subdivision (a), the moving statute, the Court may order the
judgment debtor to assign to the judgment creditor or to an appointed receiver
all or part of a right to payment due or to become due. The types of payments
that can be assigned include wages due from the federal government if not
subject to a withholding order, rents, commissions, royalties, patent or
copyright payments, and insurance policy loan value. (Code Civ. Proc., §
708.510, subd. (a).) 
 
Relevant factors the Court may
take into consideration when making an assignment order include the reasonable
requirements of a judgment debtor who is a natural person and of persons
supported in whole or in part by the judgment debtor, payments the judgment
debtor is required to make or that are deducted in satisfaction of other
judgments an wage assignments, the amount remaining due on the judgment, and
the amount to be received in satisfaction of the right to payment that may be
assigned. (Code Civ. Proc., § 708.510, subd. (c).) Construing all the
applicable statutes together, the “assignment order” contemplated by Code of
Civil Procedure, section 708.510, et seq. must include a court order
that assigns a right to payment outright (not simply an order directing the
judgment debtor to do so).   
 
IV.             
Discussion
 
Plaintiff seeks an assignment order
for payments to be made purportedly to Defendant by the Centers for Medicare
and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) and Noridian Healthcare Solutions, LLC (“NHS”)
related to Defendant’s National Provider Identifier (“NPI”). (Amended Motion, pp.
3, 5; Frischer Decl., ¶¶ 2, 6-8, Exh. 2.) Currently, the judgment remains
wholly unsatisfied in the amount of $22,494.95. (Amended Motion, Frischer Decl.,
¶¶ 3-4; Exh. 1.) Based on Defendant’s NPI, Plaintiff has reason to believe
Defendant has “rights to payments of monies that are due or will become due to
it from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and Noridian Healthcare
Solutions, LLC, a regional Medicare payment intermediary, related to its NPI.”
(Amended Motion, Frischer Decl., ¶¶ 7-8.) 
 
However, the Motion is supported
only by a declaration from Plaintiff’s counsel on information and belief with
no other supporting documentation. This is not sufficient evidence to support
the request for an assignment order here. (See City of Santa Cruz v.
Municipal Court (1989) 49 Cal.3d 74, 87 [discussing that “affidavits on
information and belief may be sufficient in a variety of contexts where the
facts would otherwise be difficult or impossible to establish” or “the
Legislature may expressly authorize the use of affidavits on information and
belief to support a particular pleading or motion”].) Information regarding the
financial connection between Defendant and CMS and NHS and the projected
payments to be received have not been shown to be difficult or impossible to obtain,
or expressly authorized under the moving statute. While Plaintiff also submits
a purported copy of Defendant’s NPI on a NPI Registry search, this evidence similarly
does not suffice to support the request for assignment order as it does not reveal
information regarding Defendant’s financial connection to CMS and NHS or the
payments to be received by Defendant. (Amended Motion, Frischer Decl., ¶ 7,
Exh. 2.)
