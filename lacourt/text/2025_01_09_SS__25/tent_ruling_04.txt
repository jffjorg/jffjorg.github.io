ANALYSIS:
 
I.                   
Background

 
On July 10, 2024, Plaintiff Devin
Taylor (“Plaintiff”) filed an action against Defendants Flexdrive Services, LLC
(“Flexdrive Services”) and Jonathan Lopez (“Lopez”) (“Defendants”) and Does
1-10 alleging a Motor Vehicle cause of action. (Compl., pp. 1, 4.) Plaintiff
alleges Lopez operated a motor vehicle owned by Flexdrive Services, and Defendants’
negligent actions caused Plaintiff to suffer wage loss, loss of use of
property, hospital and medical expenses, general damage, property damage, and
loss of earning capacity. (Compl., ¶¶ 10, 11, MV-1, MV-2.) 
 
On August 22, 2024, Lopez,
proceeding as Yeyson Jonatan Lopez Reyes erroneously sued as Jonathan Lopez,
filed an Answer. 
 
On August 26, 2024,
Flexdrive Services filed an Answer.
 
On November 19, 2024, Lopez filed the
instant discovery motions against Plaintiff, all three of which are before the
Court: (1) Motion to Compel Responses to Form Interrogatories Set One (“ROGs
Motion”), (2) Motion to Compel Responses to Special Interrogatories Set One
(“SROGs Motion”), and (3) Motion to Compel Responses to Request for Production
Set One (“RFPs Motion”) (the “Motions”).
 
On December 26, 2024, the Court
continued the hearing on the ROGs Motion from January 7, 2025 to January 9,
2025 on the Court’s own motion. (12/26/24 Order.)
 
            On
January 3, 2025, Plaintiff’s counsel Kenneth C. Yeager filed a “Plaintiff’s
Opposition to OSC re: Motion to Compel,” wherein counsel stated he “lost
contact with the Plaintiff. Without his input and signed verifications,
responses can not be provided. No monetary sanctions are warranted as to me or
this office.” (Opp., Yeager Decl., ¶ 2.) 
 
II.                
Legal
Standard & Discussion 
 
A party must respond to
interrogatories and requests for production of documents within 30 days after
service. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.260, subd. (a), 2031.260, subd. (a).) If a
party to whom interrogatories or requests for production of documents are directed
does not provide timely responses, the requesting party may move for an order
compelling responses to the discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd.
(b), 2031.300, subd. (c).) The party also waives the right to make any
objections, including one based on privilege or work-product protection. (Code
Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (a), 2031.300, subd. (a).) There is no time
limit for a motion to compel responses to interrogatories or production of
documents other than the cut-off on hearing discovery motions 15 days before
trial. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2024.020, subd. (a), 2030.290, 2031.300.) No meet
and confer efforts are required before filing a motion to compel responses to
the discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, 2031.300; Sinaiko Healthcare
Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th
390, 411.)
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 94
limits discovery in limited jurisdiction actions to any combination of 35
interrogatories with no subparts, demands to produce documents, and requests
for admission with no subparts. (Code Civ. Proc., § 94, subd. (a).)
 
Here, Lopez propounded 26 Form
Interrogatories, four Special Interrogatories, and nine Requests for
Production, totaling 39 requests. (Motions, Exhs. A.) The Court finds the
discovery requests served on Plaintiff do not comply with Code of Civil
Procedure section 94, which limits the number of written discovery requests to
35 in limited jurisdiction actions. (Code Civ. Proc., § 94, subd. (a).) Lopez
has served more than 35 requests on Plaintiff. 

 
However, the Court finds the discovery
requests only marginally exceed the jurisdictional amount of 35 and Plaintiff
does not oppose the number of discovery requests in the Opposition. Thus, the Court
exercises its discretion to address the merits of the Motions up until the
requests total 35. The Court will not order additional discovery beyond 35 absent
the requisite showing. (Code Civ. Proc., § 95.) 
 
Interrogatories 
 
Lopez contends that Plaintiff failed
to timely respond to Lopez’s Form Interrogatories Set One and Special
Interrogatories Set One on or by the statutory deadline. 
 
Here, Lopez’s counsel caused Plaintiff
to be served by email with Form Interrogatories Set One and Special
Interrogatories Set One on August 22, 2024. (ROGs Motion, Goodwin Decl., ¶ 2, Exh.
A, Proof of Service; SROGs Motion, Goodwin Decl., ¶ 2, Exh. A, Proof of Service.)

 
            As of
the date these Motions were filed, November 19, 2024, Lopez had not received
any responses. (ROGs Motion, p. 4, Goodwin Decl., ¶ 3; SROGs Motion, p. 4,
Goodwin Decl., ¶ 3.) Lopez’s counsel also attempted to meet and confer with
Plaintiff’s counsel regarding the requests but received no response. (ROGs
Motion, p. 4, Goodwin Decl., ¶ 3, Exh. B.; SROGs Motion, p. 4, Goodwin Decl., ¶
3, Exh. B.)
 
            Thus,
Lopez is entitled to an order compelling Plaintiff to provide responses to Form
Interrogatories Set One and Special Interrogatories Set One. 
 
            Requests
for Production
 
            Lopez
contends Plaintiff failed to timely respond to Lopez’s Request for Production
of Documents Set One on or by the statutory deadline.
 
            Here,
Lopez’s counsel caused Plaintiff to be served by email with Request for
Production of Documents Set One on August 22, 2024. (RFPs Motion, Goodwin
Decl., ¶ 2, Exh. A, Proof of Service.)
 
            As of
the date this Motion was filed, November 19, 2024, Lopez had not received any
responses. (RFPs Motion, p. 4, Goodwin Decl., ¶ 3.) Lopez’s counsel also attempted
to meet and confer with Plaintiff’s counsel regarding the requests but received
no response. (RFPs Motion, p. 4, Goodwin Decl., ¶ 3, Exh. B.)
 
            Thus, Lopez
is entitled to an order compelling Plaintiff to provide responses to five (5)
of Lopez’s requests in Request for Production of Documents Set One. 
 
Sanctions
 
Sanctions are
mandatory against the party, the attorney, or both whose failure to serve a
timely response to the request necessitated the motion to compel responses.
(See Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290(c), 2031.300(c); see also Cal. Rules of
Court, Rule 3.1348(a) [the court can award sanctions under the Discovery Act in
favor of a party seeking to compel discovery even though no opposition was
filed, the opposition was withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided to
the moving party after the motion was filed].)
 
            Here, Plaintiff
failed to serve a timely response to Lopez’s Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories,
and Request for Production by the statutory deadline. Thus, sanctions are
mandatory against Plaintiff, “whose failure to serve a timely response
to the request necessitated the motion to deem request for admissions as
admitted. (See Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290(c), 2031.300(c); see also Cal.
Rules of Court, Rule 3.1348(a).) 
 
However, Lopez
neither requests sanctions against Plaintiff nor provides a specific monetary
amount regarding each Motion. The Court is unable to award sanctions without
this information. 
 
            Additionally,
the Court finds sanctions against Plaintiff’s counsel are not warranted in
light of Plaintiff’s counsel’s declaration stating, in part, that counsel has
lost contact with Plaintiff. (Opp., Yeager Decl., ¶ 2.) 
 
III.             
Conclusion & Order 
 
For the foregoing reasons, Defendant
Jonathan Lopez’s Motion to Compel Responses to Form Interrogatories Set One and
Motion to Compel Responses to Special Interrogatories Set One are GRANTED. 
 
Defendant’s Motion to Compel Answers
to Request for Production of Documents Set One is GRANTED IN PART as to five
(5) requests.
 
Moving party to give notice.
