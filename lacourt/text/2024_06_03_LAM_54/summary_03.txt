And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the motion to quash service of summons filed by Cosentino Group, S.A. The court has previously found that service on Cosentino's Vice President in Canada was proper. However, the plaintiff failed to meet the burden to establish jurisdiction over Cosentino Group, S.A. The court has continued the motion to allow for discovery into facts that could show specific personal jurisdiction over Cosentino Group, S.A. However, the plaintiff has failed to make new arguments related to specific personal jurisdiction. As a result, the court has granted the motion to quash service of summons.
