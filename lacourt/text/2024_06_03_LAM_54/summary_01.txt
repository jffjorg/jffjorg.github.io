And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's motion to compel the deposition of Defendant Lisa Langley. The plaintiff has attempted to depose Langley several times, but she has refused to appear. The Court finds that Langley is a named defendant in the action and is therefore entitled to be deposed. The Court declines to make orders on the deposition schedule for Defendant Emerge's PMK and employee-witnesses, given Emerge's status as an unrepresented entity. The plaintiff's request for sanctions is denied because the plaintiff has not provided an attorney declaration calculating or justifying sanctions.
