MANAGEMENT CONFERENCE SET FOR JUNE 3, 2024 - ARE CONTINUED TO JUNE 18, 2024 AT
9:00AM.
 
PLAINTIFF TO FILE AND SERVE
SUPPLEMENTAL OPPOSITIONS, NOT TO EXCEED 7 PAGES, NO LATER THAN JUNE 12, 2024.
 
DEFENDANTS TO NOTICE
 
If the parties wish to submit on the tentative, please
email the courtroom at SMCdept54@lacourt.org with
notice to opposing counsel (or self-represented party) before 8:00 am on the
day of the hearing.
The Court considers the moving papers,
opposition, and reply.
 
Defendants have filed two demurrers and
two motions to strike. Each demurrer’s memorandum of points and authorities
exceeds CRC Rule 3.1113(d)’s 15-page limit for memoranda by 7 pages. Plaintiff
objected to this in opposition and refused to address Defendants’ arguments made
after 15 pages (causes of action 10-16.). In reply, Defendants argue that the additional
pages were needed because of the length of Plaintiff’s complaint and the 16
causes of actions asserted. 
Given the large number of causes of
action asserted in the first amended complaint, the Court will consider
Defendants’ entire memoranda. The Court will allow Plaintiff the opportunity to
oppose the motions with supplemental briefing.
 
The demurrers and motions to strike are
CONTINUED.
