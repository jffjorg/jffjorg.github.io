And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Bank of New York (BONY) has filed an unopposed demurrer to the plaintiff's complaint, which alleges constructive fraud, negligence, slander of title, and violations of the Home Owner's Bill of Rights (HBOR) in connection with a non-judicial foreclosure and sale of a residential property. The court has reviewed the pleadings and finds that the plaintiff's claims are insufficiently pled and lack particularity. Specifically, the court cannot tell what BONY did specifically that constitutes fraud, and the plaintiff needs to allege what BONY did that violated the HBOR. The court also finds that the plaintiff's claims of negligence, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and slander of title fail because they do not specify what BONY did that was wrongful. The court grants the demurrer with leave to amend, giving the plaintiff 30 days to amend the complaint. The court warns that leave to amend may not be granted again if the plaintiff fails to adequately plead the claims.
