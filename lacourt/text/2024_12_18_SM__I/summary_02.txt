```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the cross complaint and has tentatively ruled that the demurrer filed by the cross defendants is OVERRULED. The cross complaint alleges sufficient specifics to support a claim of breach of a non-compete agreement, which can be further fleshed out in discovery. The judge also found that the allegations of fraud in the inducement are clear and specific, as they relate to promises made in the contract itself. The judge is not convinced that the cross complainant is alleging fraud in the conduct following the contract, but even if that were the case, the court could not demur to part of a cause of action. The judge has ruled that the 17200 cause of action stands or falls with the rest of the complaint. The cross defendants have 30 days to answer the cross complaint.
