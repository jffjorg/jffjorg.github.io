 Case Number:  24SMCV02013    Hearing Date:   December 18, 2024    Dept:  I The demurrer is OVERRULED. 
The cross complaint alleges sufficient specifics as to the nature of the
breach of the non-compete.  More detail
can be fleshed out in discovery.  As to
fraud, it would appear that what is being alleged is fraud in the inducement in
that cross-complainant alleges that cross defendants did not intend to keep the
promises made in the contract at the time of contracting, including the promise
to transfer all property to cross complainants and not to compete with cross
complainants.  Unlike other sorts of
fraud, the who, what, and when are essentially clear in a fraud in the
inducement claim in that the promises were made in the contract itself.  While the court has more trouble with any
allegations of fraud relating to post contract conduct, it is not clear that
cross complainant is really so alleging, and one cannot demur to part of a
cause of action in any event.  The 17200
cause of action stands or falls with the rest of the complaint.  And declaratory relief might or might not be
available, but it is too early to tell right now.  In short, the demurrer is OVERRULED.  Cross defendant has 30 days to answer.  As an aside, the court agrees that its prior
tentative is not binding, although the court did set forth its thinking at the
time.
