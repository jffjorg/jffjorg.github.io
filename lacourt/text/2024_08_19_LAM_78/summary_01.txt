And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Edgar Lopez and Eva Gutierrez v. General Motors, LLC. The plaintiffs filed a motion to compel General Motors to provide further responses to their form interrogatories, which General Motors opposes. The court notes that this is not the first time Plaintiffs have filed such a motion, and that the court has reviewed the briefs and finds good cause to conduct an Informal Discovery Conference (IDC) to try to resolve the discovery dispute informally before hearing the motions to compel further. The parties are ordered to meet and confer on a date to participate in the IDC, and the plaintiffs are ordered to continue the hearing on the motions to compel further discovery responses using the online reservation management system, with a new hearing date at least three weeks after the IDC.
