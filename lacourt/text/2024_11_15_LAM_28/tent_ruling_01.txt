BACKGROUND
 
On May 16, 2024, Plaintiff Dongguan Qiaoli
Clothing Co., LTD. (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Blum & Sonder
Corp., Feel In, Feel In Apparel, Jung Soo Kim, Jung Tae Kim, and Allen Kim
(collectively “Defendants”), as well as against Does 1 through 10. Plaintiff
alleged causes of action for (1) breach of written agreement, (2) goods sold
and delivered, (3) account stated, (4) open book account, and (5) false
promises. 
 
Plaintiff alleges that Plaintiff entered into
a series of transactions with Defendant Feel In whereby Plaintiff would
manufacture and ship clothing products to Feel In. Plaintiff claims Feel In would
either not pay for these shipments or pay late. Despite Feel In’s promise to
get current on its account, Feel In allegedly owes an outstanding balance of $208,647.90.
Plaintiff claims Feel In has not paid this amount through repeated requests for
payment. Plaintiff alleges that to ensure continued shipments of clothing
products, the other named Defendants guaranteed the remaining balance on the
loans, yet the outstanding balance remains.
 
Plaintiff substitute served all Defendants on
June 5, 2024. The Clerk entered default against all Defendants on July 18,
2024. This is Plaintiff’s second request for entry of default judgment.
 
ANALYSIS
 
Code of Civil Procedure (“CCP”) Section 585
permits entry of a judgment after a defendant’s default has been entered.  A party seeking judgment on the default by
the Court must file a Request for Court Judgment, and: (1) a brief summary of
the case; (2) declarations or other admissible evidence in support of the
judgment requested; (3) interest computations as necessary; (4) a memorandum of
costs and disbursements; (5) a proposed form of judgment; (6) a dismissal of
all parties against whom judgment is not sought; (7) a dismissal of all parties
against whom judgment is not sought or an application for separate judgment
under CCP Section 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment; (8)
exhibits as necessary; and (9) a request for attorneys’ fees if allowed by
statute or by the agreement of the parties. 
CRC 3.1800. 
 
JC Form CIV-100 must be used to request court
judgment.  Item number 2 must be
completed.  Item number 8 must be
completed if the Defendant is an individual. 
Plaintiff must submit a proposed form of judgment.  
 
Here, Plaintiff has submitted a proposed form
of judgment, filed CIV-100 Forms for each Defendant, completed item 2 on each
form, completed Item 8 for all individual Defendants, and dismissed all Doe
defendants. 
 
By defaulting, a defendant is deemed to admit
all material allegations of the complaint that are well pleaded.  Molen v. Friedman (1998) 64
Cal.App.4th 1149, 1156.  The complaint
need only alleged facts sufficient to apprise a defendant of the nature of the
plaintiff’s demand, and it is immaterial that the complaint might have been
subject to a demurrer for failure to make an allegation necessary to state a
cause of action.  Id. at
1157.  See also CCP
§ 431.20; Bristol Convalescent Hospital v. Stone (1968) 258
Cal.App.2d 848, 859 (stating that defaulting defendant admits absolute verity
of all allegations of complaint giving rise to liability). 
 
The plaintiff must prove the amount of
damages before an actual entry of default judgment.  See Ostling v. Loring (1994)
27 Cal.App.4th 1731, 1745.  In
determining whether the plaintiff is entitled to an award of damages after the
defendant has defaulted, the plaintiff is only required to present evidence
establishing a prima facie case for damages. 
Johnson v. Stanhiser (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 357,
361-362.  The trial court must hear the
evidence offered by the plaintiff and render judgment “‘in [its] favor for such
sum, not exceeding the amount stated in the complaint, or for such relief, not
exceeding that demanded in the complaint, as appears from the evidence to be
just.  [Citations.]’”  Id. at 362.
 
A.           General Damages
 
The demand of the Complaint is $208,647.90. Plaintiff
entered into a series of transactions with Defendants whereby Plaintiff was to
ship articles of clothing and Defendant was to pay for the clothes, but
Defendant did not pay for these shipments. This left Plaintiff with $208,647.90
in receivables due from Defendants. Jin Decl., Ex. A. Plaintiff made a demand
on Defendants for the outstanding amount, but Defendants never paid. Jin Decl.,
Ex. C; Jin Decl., ¶ 29. Plaintiff has attached multiple purchase orders,
invoices, packing lists, and PO lists that outline the specifics of each
individual order made by Defendants. Jin Decl., Ex. B. 
  
Thus, Plaintiff has sufficiently proven its
causes of action for the amount of $208,647.90. 
 
B.           Costs
 
Plaintiff requests recovery of costs in the
amount of $804.90.  The memorandum of
costs states that the request is based on (a) $435.00 in clerk’s filing fees,
(b) $269.90 in process server’s fees, and (c) $100.00 in filing service charges.  CIV-100, ln. 7.
  
Accordingly, Plaintiff is entitled to costs
in the amount of $804.90.
 
C.          Interest
 
Plaintiff seeks to recover interest in the
amount of $9,089.05. Plaintiff seeks at a rate of 10% per annum, beginning from
May 16, 2024, the day of the filing of the complaint through October 22, 2024,
the day Plaintiff refiled this default packet. 
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff is entitled to
interest in the amount of $9,089.05.


D.          Attorney
Fees
 
Plaintiff seeks to recover $3,976.48 in
attorney fees pursuant to Civil Code Section 1717.5. Lee Decl., ¶ 4. LASC local
rules 3.207 and 3.214 govern this case. This rule states that in cases where a
statute provides for attorney fees, if the Defendant is in default, and the
total damages sought are over
$100,000.00, the plaintiff can recover $2,890 plus 1% of the excess over
$100,000.00 in attorney fees. The applicable statute, Civil Code Section
1717.5, entitles Plaintiff to recover attorney fees because Plaintiff brings a
contract action based on a book account. Moreover, Plaintiff seeks to recover
$208,647.90, and Defendants have defaulted as to this amount. Therefore,
Plaintiff may recover $2,890.00 plus 1% of $108,647.90, which is the excess
over $100,000.00. This total amount is $3,976.48 ($2,890.00 + $1,086.48). Lee
Decl., ¶ 4.
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff is entitled to
attorney fees in the amount of $3,976.48.
