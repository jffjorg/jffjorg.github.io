And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants the motion of Attorney Barak Lurie, Attorney Brent A. Kramer, and their firm, Lurie & Kramer, to be relieved as counsel for Defendant 110 Sunshine Smoothies, Inc., Defendant Gholam Atighehchi, and Defendant Fariba Atighehchi. The judge finds that the attorney-client relationship has broken down, making it unreasonably difficult for the attorneys to continue representing the defendants. The judge also schedules an Order to Show Cause Re: Defendants 110 Sunshine Smoothies, Gholam Atighehchi, and Fariba Atighehchiâ€™s Retention of New Counsel and Order to Show Cause why the Answer of 110 Sunshine Smoothies should not be stricken for 9:00 AM on August 7, 2024.
