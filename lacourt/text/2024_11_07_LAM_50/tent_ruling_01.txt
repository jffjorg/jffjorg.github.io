[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER RE:  
 
MOTION BY
  DEFENDANTS STEPHEN J. RUSSELL AND SECURCAPITAL CORP. FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
  AND/OR SUMMARY ADJUDICATION




AND RELATED CROSS-ACTION


 



 
Background
Plaintiff Wave
Investment, LLC (“Wave”) filed this action on December 30, 2021 against
Defendants SecurCapital Corp. (“SecurCapital”) and Stephen J. Russell (“Russell”)
(jointly, “Defendants”).
Wave filed the operative Third Amended Complaint (“TAC”) on November
15, 2023, alleging causes of action for (1) breach of contract, (2) declaratory
relief, (3) breach of partnership or joint venture agreement, (4) breach of
fiduciary duty, (5) conversion, 
(6)
fraudulent concealment, (7) fraudulent misrepresentation, (8) negligent
misrepresentation, 
(9)
unjust enrichment, (10) accounting, and (11) constructive trust.
            On
February 20, 2024, SecurCapital filed a Cross-Complaint against Wave and Mark
Boyce, alleging causes of action for (1) fraudulent concealment, (2) fraudulent
misrepresentation, (3) fraudulent inducement, (4) breach of the covenant of
good faith and fair dealing, and (5) declaratory relief.  
Russell now moves for summary judgment or, in the alternative, summary
adjudication as to each cause of action asserted against Russell in TAC., i.e.,
Wave’s first, fourth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, and eleventh causes of action
against Russell. In addition, SecurCapital moves for summary adjudication as to
the second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, tenth, and eleventh
causes of action asserted against SecurCapital in Wave’s TAC. Wave opposes. 
Discussion 
As an initial matter, the Court notes that in
connection with the motion, Defendants filed a “Notice of Lodging of Pleadings Conditionally
Under Seal,” which provides that “on August 23, 2024, in Department 50 of the
above-captioned Court, Defendant Stephen J. Russell and Defendant and
Cross-Complainant SecurCapital Corp. will lodge the following pleadings
conditionally under seal: 
 
(1) MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES IN SUPPORT OF DEFENDANTS
STEPHEN J. RUSSELL’S AND SECURCAPITAL CORP.’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
AND/OR SUMMARY ADJUDICATION (CONDITIONALLY UNDER SEAL); 
 
(2) SEPARATE STATEMENT OF UNDISPUTED MATERIAL FACTS IN SUPPORT OF
DEFENDANTS STEPHEN J. RUSSELL’S AND SECURCAPITAL CORP.’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY
JUDGMENT AND/OR SUMMARY ADJUDICATION (CONDITIONALLY UNDER SEAL); and 
 
(3) COMPENDIUM OF EVIDENCE IN SUPPORT OF DEFENDANTS STEPHEN J.
RUSSELL’S AND SECURCAPITAL CORP.’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT AND/OR SUMMARY
ADJUDICATION (CONDITIONALLY UNDER SEAL).” (Defendants’ Notice of Lodging at p.
1:2-17.) 
The Court notes that Defendants’ memorandum of
points and authorities and separate statement in support of the instant motion,
both filed on August 22, 2024, contain redactions. Defendants’ compendium of
evidence filed on August 22, 2024 also contains redacted material. However, it
does not appear that Defendants filed any motion to seal the redacted portions
of their moving papers. The Court notes that pursuant to California
Rules of Court, rule 2.551, subdivision (a), “[a] record must not be filed
under seal without a court order. The court must not permit a record to be
filed under seal based solely on the agreement or stipulation of the parties.”
In addition, “[a] party requesting that a record be filed under seal must file
a motion or an application for an order sealing the record. The motion or
application must be accompanied by a memorandum and a declaration containing
facts sufficient to justify the sealing.” (Cal. Rules of
Court, Rule 2.551, subd. (b)(2).)¿Accordingly, the Court continues the
hearing on Defendants’ instant motion, as discussed below.  
Conclusion 
In light of the foregoing, the hearing on Defendants’ motion for
summary judgment and/or summary adjudication is continued to ____________,
2024, at 10:00 a.m. in Dept. 50. If Defendants seek to seal the redacted
portions of their moving papers, Defendants must immediately file a motion or
application to seal pursuant to California Rules of
Court, rule 2.550 et seq.¿If Defendants do not seek to seal the
redacted portions of the moving papers, Defendants must immediately file with
the Court unredacted versions of the moving papers. ¿
Defendants are ordered to give notice of this Order.
