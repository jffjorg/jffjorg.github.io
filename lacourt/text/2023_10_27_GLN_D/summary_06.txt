Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiffs' motion to compel further responses to their requests for production of documents without prejudice. The motion was filed by the plaintiffs, Alejandro Sanchez and Edgar Montenegro, against Ford Motor Company, alleging that the vehicle they purchased in February 2022, a 2021 Ford EcoSport, was delivered with serious defects and has not been repaired by the defendant despite numerous attempts. The plaintiffs are seeking further responses to their requests for production of documents, including information about the defendant's warranty process, customer complaints, and technical service bulletins.

The judge has ruled that the parties must meet and confer in good faith to resolve the outstanding discovery disputes in light of the court's Addendum to Case Management Conference Order (Song-Beverly Litigation). The judge has also noted that the parties must comply with the court's Standing Order and any further objections must be accompanied by a Code compliant privilege log. The judge has also directed the parties to engage in a reasonable and good faith attempt to resolve informally any disputes that may arise.
