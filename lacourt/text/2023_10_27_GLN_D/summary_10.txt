And here is the summary in English text:

The judge grants the plaintiff's motion to compel the defendant's responses to the request for identification and production of documents, set one. The defendant failed to respond to the document production demands despite being given ample time, and the plaintiff is entitled to an order compelling the defendant to respond. The court also awards monetary sanctions to the plaintiff in the amount of $897.50, which is reasonable and not challenged by the defendant. The defendant is ordered to serve verified responses to the plaintiff's request for production of documents and things, and to permit inspection and copying within thirty days.
