Finally, the judge found that plaintiff has failed to submit appropriate evidence from a witness qualified under Health and Safety Code section 1799.110 (c) as to defendant Alex Bradleigh Freling, M.D.

The judge's ruling is based on the court's application of the California Code of Civil Procedure section 425.13 and the California Civil Code section 3294.
