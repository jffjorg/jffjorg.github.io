English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by the defendant, Caruso Management Company, Ltd., to the second cause of action of the plaintiff, Leah Nazaryan's, complaint. The plaintiff alleges that the defendant was negligent in maintaining the property and that the defendant's failure to use due care resulted in the plaintiff's injury. The defendant argues that the second cause of action for general negligence is duplicative of the first cause of action for premises liability, but the Judge finds that the causes of action are not duplicative. The Judge also finds that the liberal rules of pleading permit parties to plead duplicative, alternative, or even inconsistent causes of action. Therefore, the Judge overrules the demurrer and gives the defendant 10 days to answer the complaint.
