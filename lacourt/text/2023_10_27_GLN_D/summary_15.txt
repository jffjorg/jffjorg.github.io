And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The discovery motions are stayed and will be continued one final time to a placeholder date of December 22, 2023, to permit the parties to file a motion to lift the stay or further briefing concerning the status of this action. The court will hear argument concerning the following: whether this action should continue to be stayed, what is the status of the Van Nuys action, and whether the pending discovery motions should be withdrawn or continued for new complete updated and superseding briefing in light of the new circumstances arising from entry of the Judgment in the Van Nuys action.
