The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by the defendant, The Americana at Brand, LLC, to the second cause of action of the plaintiff, Edna Martikian Boghossian's, complaint. The defendant argues that the second cause of action for general negligence is duplicative of the first cause of action for premises liability and should be demurred. However, the judge finds that the causes of action are not duplicative and that the defendant's demurrer is untimely, filed and served thirty-two days after the last date upon which the parties were authorized by statute to stipulate to an extension of time to plead without advance leave of Court. The judge overrules the demurrer and gives the parties ten days to answer.
