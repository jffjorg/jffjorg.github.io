And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the defendant's special motion to strike the second cause of action for fraud in the plaintiff's complaint. The ruling holds that the defendants' actions in filing a claim with the bonding company and seeking recovery on the contractor's license bond are protected activity under California Code of Civil Procedure Section 425.16. The plaintiff has failed to establish a probability of prevailing on the merits of the fraud cause of action, and the motion is granted. The second cause of action for fraud is stricken with prejudice from the complaint. The ruling also notes that the fraud cause of action is not properly alleged against the defendants, as they did not make any representations to the plaintiff, but rather to a third party, the bonding company.
