And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Quintero v. General Motors, LLC, addressing the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to the defendant's requests for production of documents. The court notes that the parties have failed to meet and confer regarding discovery disputes, and that the defendant has failed to provide adequate responses to the plaintiff's requests for production of documents.

The court has denied the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses without prejudice, citing the Addendum to Case Management Conference Order (Song-Beverly Litigation), which provides that any formal discovery propounded and currently pending or outstanding by a party in this matter prior to the date of this CMC Order is stayed pending further order of the Court.

The court has ordered the parties to meet and confer in good faith concerning compliance with the Order, and to serve any further discovery and engage in any further discovery proceedings or motions in compliance with the Order. The court has also stated that any further objections that responsive documents are being withheld based on attorney-client or work product privilege must be accompanied by a Code compliant privilege log.

The court has emphasized the importance of complying with the Order and has warned that any motions that do not comply with the Order will be denied. The court has also encouraged the parties to use LACourtConnect for remote appearances and has noted that advance registration is required.
