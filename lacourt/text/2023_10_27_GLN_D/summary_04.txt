Summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has denied plaintiff's motion for summary judgment as the plaintiff has failed to establish each element of their causes of action. The court has also rejected defendant's claims of an equitable easement as insufficient to prevent plaintiff from using their own property. The court has declared that the proper designation of the property line is as set forth in the Corner Record, and that the current fence is subject to removal. The court has also declined to foreclose defendant from pursuing arguments concerning an equitable easement in connection with any placement of a new border wall between the parties to be determined in connection with the remaining causes of action.
