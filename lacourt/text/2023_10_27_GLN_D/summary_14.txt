And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the demurrer brought by the defendant, Peter K. Robbins, is overruled. The demurrer was filed 14 days late, and the court has declined to grant an extension. Additionally, the court has found that the demurrer fails to establish that there is another action pending between the same parties on the same cause of action. The court has also taken judicial notice of the minute orders and pleadings filed in the related case, LASC Case No. 20STCV20770. The court has granted the defendant's request for judicial notice in part, but has declined to take judicial notice of the truth of hearsay statements included in the pleadings. The court has given the parties 10 days to answer the complaint.
