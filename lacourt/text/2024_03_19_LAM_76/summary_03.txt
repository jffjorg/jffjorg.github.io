Summary:
The judge's tentative ruling is that the demurrer to the Complaint should be overruled as to the first and fourth causes of action, sustained with leave to amend as to the second, third, and fifth causes of action, and moot as to the sixth cause of action. The judge found that the CRD Complaint was sufficient to exhaust administrative remedies and that Plaintiff's allegations of disability discrimination and retaliation were sufficient to plead the causes of action. However, the judge found that Plaintiff's allegations of failure to accommodate and failure to engage in an interactive process were not sufficient to plead the causes of action.
