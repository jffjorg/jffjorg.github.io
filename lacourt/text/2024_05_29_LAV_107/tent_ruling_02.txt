 
I. BACKGROUND
Plaintiffs Efrain Hernandez Gomez (“Gomez”) and Norma Letisia
Valencia (“Valencia” and, together with Gomez, “Plaintiffs”) are a married
couple who live at Park Reseda Condominiums (the “Property”) with their
children. On April 5, 2021, Plaintiffs were involved in a violent altercation
with defendant Raymundo Reducindo Oliva (“Reducindo Oliva”) on the Property, at
which Reducindo Oliva was a security guard employed by defendant GTO Security
Corp. (“GTO Security” and, together with Plaintiffs, “Parties”). The remaining
named defendants, Park Reseda Condominium Association Inc. (“Association”) and
LB Property Management Inc. d/b/a LBPM (“LBPM” and, together with Reducindo
Oliva, GTO Security, and Association, “Defendants”) are the owners, operators,
or managers of the Property. 
 
On April 4, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a
complaint (the “Complaint”) against Defendants alleging causes of action for
(1) battery, (2) assault, (3) negligence, (4) negligent hiring, supervision, or
retention of employee, and (5) loss of consortium. 
 
On December 18, 2023, this court granted
GTO Security’s motion to strike punitive damages from the Complaint as to
itself.
 
On January 12, 2024, Plaintiffs filed an
amended complaint (the “FAC”), with the same causes of action and again seeking
punitive damages against all Defendants. 
 
On February 28, 2024, this court granted
GTO Security’s motion to strike punitive damages from the FAC as to
itself.
 
On March 28, 2024, Plaintiffs served a
second amended complaint (the “SAC”) on Defendants, although the SAC was, by
accident, not filed with this court until May 15, 2024.
 
On April 9, 2024,
GTO Security filed a motion (“the Motion”) to strike punitive damages from the
SAC as to itself. 
 
On April 19, 2024,
pursuant to a stipulation between Plaintiffs, Association, and LBPM, this court
struck punitive damages from the SAC, without prejudice, as to Association and
LBPM.
 
On May 3, 2024,
Plaintiffs filed an opposition (“the Opposition”) to the Motion. GTO did not
timely reply to the Opposition.
 
II. PROCEDURAL MATTERS
 

The Meet and Confer Requirement

 
California
Code of Civil Procedure §¿435.5, subdivision (a) requires parties to “meet and
confer in person or by telephone” in good faith before the filing of a motion
to strike to attempt to informally resolve the objections raised in the motion
to strike.
 
GTO Security submits with the Motion a declaration by its counsel stating
that he sent an e-mail to Plaintiffs’ counsel describing GTO’s objections to
the SAC and asking Plaintiffs’ counsel to “[p]lease let [him] know
[Plaintiffs’] position in this regard.” (Snyder Decl. ¶ 1.) GTO Security’s
counsel additionally states that he and Plaintiff’s counsel did not reach a
resolution of the issues raised by the Motion before it was filed. (Id.
at ¶ 2.)
 
Because the statute mandating that parties meet and confer before the
filing of a motion to strike specifies that such meet and confer efforts be
made “in person or by telephone,” an e-mail exchange is insufficient to meet
this requirement. GTO’s counsel does not clarify in his declaration if any
subsequent meet and confer efforts between himself and Plaintiff’s counsel
occurred in person or by phone or if any subsequent efforts were made. We
remind Parties of their obligation to meet and confer with each other in good
faith.
 
III. LEGAL STANDARD
 
The court may, upon a motion, or at any time in its
discretion, and upon terms it deems proper, strike any irrelevant, false, or
improper matter inserted in any pleading. (Code Civ. Proc., § 436, subd. (a).)
The court may also strike all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in
conformity with the laws of this state, a court rule, or an order of the court.
(Id. at § 436, subd. (b).) The grounds for moving to strike must appear
on the face of the pleading or by way of judicial notice. (Id. at §¿437.) 
 
A motion to strike is appropriate to
attack a claim for punitive damages. (Grieves v. Superior Court (1984)
157 Cal.App.3d 159, 164.) “In order to survive a motion to strike an allegation
of punitive damages, the ultimate facts showing an entitlement to such relief
must be pled by a plaintiff.¿In passing on the correctness of a ruling on a
motion to strike, judges read allegations of a pleading subject to a motion to
strike as a whole, all parts in their context, and assume their truth.” (Clausen
v. Superior Court (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 1253, 1255 (internal citations
omitted).) “Further, even though certain language pleads ultimate facts or
conclusions of law, such language when read in context with the facts alleged
as to defendants' conduct may adequately plead the evil motive requisite to
recovery of¿punitive¿damages.” (Monge v. Superior Court (1986) 176
Cal.App.3d 503, 510.) 
 
“In order to state a prima facie claim
for¿punitive¿damages, a complaint must set forth the elements as stated in the
general¿punitive¿damage¿statute,¿Civil Code section 3294.” (Turman v.
Turning Point of Central California, Inc. (2010) 191 Cal.App.4th 53, 63.)
California Civil Code section 3294 authorizes the recovery of punitive damages
“[i]n an action for the breach of an obligation
not arising from contract, where it is proven by clear and convincing evidence
that the defendant has been guilty of oppression, fraud, or malice….” 
(Civ. Code § 3294, subd. (a).) “In order to justify an award of
punitive¿damages, the defendant must be guilty of oppression, fraud or malice.
He must act with the intent to vex, injure or annoy, or with a conscious
disregard of the plaintiff's rights.” (Silberg v. California Life Ins. Co.
(1974) 11 Cal.3d 452, 462 (internal citations omitted).) “[M]alice in fact is
required rather than implied malice.¿However, malice does not require actual
intent to harm.¿Conscious disregard for the safety of another may be sufficient
where the defendant is aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his or
her conduct and he or she willfully fails to avoid such consequences.” (Angie
M. v. Superior Court (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1217, 1228 (internal citations
omitted).) “In order to justify an award of punitive damages on this basis, the
plaintiff must establish that the defendant was aware of the probable dangerous
consequences of his¿conduct, and that he wilfully and deliberately failed to
avoid those consequences.” (Taylor v. Superior Court (1979) 24 Cal.3d
890, 895–96.)  
 
“Punitive¿damages¿may not
be¿pleaded¿generally.” (Today’s IV, Inc. v. Los Angeles County Metropolitan
Transportation Authority (2022) 83 Cal.App.5th 1137, 1193.) “The mere
allegation an intentional tort was committed is not sufficient to warrant an
award of¿punitive¿damages.” (Grieves v. Superior Court, supra,
157 Cal.App.3d 159 at 166.) And, “conclusory characterization of defendant's
conduct as intentional, wilful and fraudulent is a patently insufficient
statement of “oppression, fraud, or malice, express or implied,” within the
meaning of¿section 3294.” (Brousseau v. Jarrett (1977) 73 Cal.App.3d
864, 872.) “Not only must there be circumstances of oppression, fraud or
malice, but facts must be alleged in the pleading to support such a claim.” (Grieves,
supra at 166; Today’s IV, Inc. v. Los Angeles County Metropolitan
Transportation Authority, supra at 1193 [“In addition to the
requirement that the operative complaint set forth the elements as stated
in¿section 3294, it must include¿specific¿factual allegations showing that
defendant's conduct was oppressive, fraudulent, or malicious to support a claim
for¿punitive¿damages.”].) 
 
California Civil Code section 3294 provides that an employer
shall be liable for punitive damages only if it “had advance knowledge of the
unfitness of the employee and employed him or her with a conscious disregard of
the rights or safety of others or authorized or ratified the wrongful conduct
for which the damages are awarded or was personally guilty of oppression,
fraud, or malice,” and further, “[w]ith respect to a corporate employer, the
advance knowledge and conscious disregard, authorization, ratification or act
of oppression, fraud, or malice must be on the part of an officer, director, or
managing agent of the corporation.” (Cal. Civ. Code § 3294, subd. (b).) “In
order to demonstrate that an employee is a true managing agent under¿section
3294, subdivision (b), a plaintiff seeking punitive damages would have to show
that the employee exercised substantial discretionary authority over
significant aspects of a corporation's business.” (White v. Ultramar, Inc.
(1999) 21 Cal.4th 563, 577.) “The scope of a corporate employee's discretion
and authority under our managing agent test is therefore a question
of fact for decision on a case-by-case basis.” (Davis v. Kiewit
Pacific Co. (2013) 220 Cal.App.4th 358, 366, emphasis original.) Moreover,
“liability under¿Civil Code section 3294, subdivision (b)¿requires actual
knowledge by an¿employer.” (Weeks v. Baker & McKenzie (1998) 63
Cal.App.4th 1128, 1158.)
 
IV. DISCUSSION
 
GTO Security moves
to strike from the SAC paragraph 34 and paragraph 46, both of which relate to
GTO Security’s liability for punitive damages, the punitive damages aspects of
the SAC’s fourth cause of action in paragraphs 53 through 60, and the SAC’s
prayer for punitive damages. (Notice of Motion p. 2; Motion p. 7.)
 

Paragraph 34
     / First Cause of Action

 
Paragraph 34 is
the last paragraph of the SAC’s first cause of action for battery and reads, 
 
GTO [Security] is
also liable for punitive damages because it ratified Reducindo [Oliva]’s
misconduct by hiring him to be a security guard and giving him a gun knowing
that he was neither licensed to be a security guard or carry a gun, failing to
ensure that he became licensed, knowingly allowing him to drink on the job, and
accepting his violence toward the public without providing him with
anti-violence training or terminating him.
 
(SAC p. 6.)
 
The SAC’s first
cause of action does not allege any acts of GTO Security that independently
warrant punitive damages. Rather, Plaintiffs base GTO Security’s liability on a
respondeat superior theory, alleging that “GTO [Security] is liable for
Reducindo [Olivo]’s battery because it occurred within the course and scope of
his employment by GTO [Security].” (SAC p. 5.)
 
Paragraph 34 of
the SAC only alleges that GTO Security is liable for punitive damages because
it ratified Reducindo Olivo’s actions. (SAC p. 6.) “‘Ratification’ of its
[employee’s] acts by a corporation is the confirmation and acceptance of a
previous act.” (Cruz v. HomeBase (2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 160, 168.) The
SAC does not allege any acts of GTO Security that confirmed or accepted
Reducindo Oliva’s acts and that occurred after the violent incident
between Plaintiffs and Reducindo Oliva that underlies this action. For example,
GTO Security’s hiring of Reducindo Oliva and provision of a gun to Reducindo
Olivo are necessarily acts that would have occurred before Reducindo Olivo’s
violent incident with Plaintiffs and therefore cannot be said to indicate ratification
by GTO Security of Reducindo Olivo’s acts. Thus, the SAC’s first cause of
action fails to plead facts sufficient to show that Plaintiffs are entitled to
punitive damages from GTO Security.
 
Accordingly, this
court GRANTS the Motion as to the punitive damages allegations in paragraph 34
of the SAC.
 

Paragraph 46
     / Second Cause of Action

 
Paragraph 46 is
the last paragraph of the SAC’s second cause of action for assault and reads, 
 
GTO [Security] is
also liable for punitive damages because it ratified Reducindo [Olivo]’s
misconduct by hiring him to be a security guard and giving him a gun knowing
that he was neither licensed to be a security guard or carry a gun, failing to
ensure that he became licensed, knowingly allowing him to drink on the job, and
accepting his violence toward the public without providing him with
anti-violence training or terminating him.
 
(SAC p. 7.)
 
Like was the case
in the SAC’s first cause of action discussed immediately above, Plaintiffs base
GTO Security’s liability on a respondeat superior theory, alleging that “GTO
[Security] is liable for Reducindo Olivo’s assault because it occurred within the
course and scope of his employment by GTO [Security].” (SAC p. 6.) And, like
was the case in the SAC’s first cause of action, the SAC’s second cause of
action does not allege any acts of GTO Security that independently warrant
punitive damages.
 
Paragraph 46 of
the SAC only alleges that GTO Security is liable for punitive damages because
it ratified Reducindo Olivo’s actions. (SAC p. 7.) For the same reason we found
that punitive damages were not supported by paragraph 34’s allegations that GTO
Security had ratified Reducindo Olivo’s actions, we find here that Plaintiffs’
claim for punitive damages is not supported by the allegations, which do not
show any after-occurring acts by GTO Security that could be said to have
ratified Reducindo Olivo’s actions.
 
Accordingly, this
court GRANTS the Motion as to the punitive damages allegations in paragraph 46
of the SAC.
 

Punitive
     Damages Elements of the Fourth Cause of Action

 
The fourth cause
of action seeks punitive damages from GTO Security for the negligent hiring,
supervision, or retention of an employee. (SAC p. 8.) Under California Civil Code section 3294, this
cause of action “shall” be the basis of a claim for punitive damages if the
employer “had advance knowledge of the unfitness of the employee and employed
him or her with a conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” 
 
Plaintiffs allege in support of the fourth cause of action
four specific factual allegatins: (1) GTO Security “knew that Reducindo [Olivo]
was not a licensed security guard and not authorized to carry a gun” and
consequently, knew that “Reducindo [Olivo] was unfit to be a security guard
when he was hired as one”; (2) GTO Security did not “cause or ensure that
Reducindo [Olivo] became a licensed security guard” and consequently, “[GTO
Security] retained Reducindo [Olivo] as a security guard despite [its] awareness
that he was unfit be one”; (3) GTO Security “became aware that Reducindo
[Olivo] drank alcohol on the job yet failed to supervise him to prevent it,
failed to get him treatment, failed to train him to work without drinking
alcohol, and failed to terminate him”; and (4) GTO Security knew, before the
incident with Plaintiffs, “that Reducindo [Olivo] had committed violence upon
members of the public while in the course and scope of his duties as a security
guard, yet failed to supervise him to prevent it, failed to get him treatment,
failed to train him to work with the public non-violently, and failed to
terminate him.” (SAC p. 8.)
 
These factual allegations adequately plead that GTO Security
had advance actual knowledge of Reducindo Olivo’s unfitness as a security guard
(because he was not licensed, because he was not authorized to carry a gun,
because he drank alcohol while on duty at work, and because had committed
violence upon members of the public before while acting as a security guard)
but nonetheless retained Reducindo Olivo as its employee as a security guard.
With such knowledge of Reducindo Olivo’s unfitness for the job and past history
of violent altercations with members of the public, GTO Security’s retention of
Reducindo Olivo could be said to have been done with “a conscious disregard of
the rights or safety of others.”
 
Because GTO Security is a corporate employer, such “advance
knowledge and conscious disregard” it demonstrated through its retention of
Reducindo Olivo must have been “on the part of an officer, director, or
managing agent of the corporation” to support a claim for punitive damages.
(Cal. Civ. Code § 3294, subd. (b).) Although Plaintiffs do not name a
particular officer, director, or managing agent of GTO Security’s who allegedly
possessed such advance actual knowledge about Reducindo Olivo’s fitness as a security
guard, we do not believe they are required to at this early stage before
discovery as long as it is alleged of someone in such a position of authority
within GTO Security. The allegations raised in the SAC’s fourth cause of action
could only have been made by an agent of GTO Security with the authority to
investigate, supervise, hire, and fire security guards and therefore someone
with the discretionary authority to control employee retention and supervision,
which could be a “significant aspect of [GTO Security’s] business.” (White
v. Ultramar, Inc., supra, 21 Cal.4th 563 at 577.) We find that the
current allegations of the SAC’s fourth cause of action, which are all phrased
in terms of what the corporate entity GTO Security knew or did rather than what
individual agents of GTO Security knew or did, are sufficient to put GTO on
notice of the general nature of the claims being made against it. We also find
that the SAC’s fourth cause of action adequately pleads that such knowledge and
acts belonged to or were conducted by “an officer, director, or managing agent
of [GTO Security]” so as to support a claim for punitive damages.
 
Accordingly, this
court DENIES the Motion as to the punitive damages allegations in the fourth
cause of action of the SAC.
 

Prayer for Relief

 
GTO Security seeks to strike the third item of the SAC’s
prayer for relief, which reads, “[p]unitive damages as to Plaintiffs’ First,
Second, and Fourth causes of action.” (SAC p. 9.)
 
Because we agree with GTO Security that the first and second
causes of action, as pled by the SAC, do not plead allegations sufficient to
support claims of punitive damages, we agree that references to those causes of
action may be struck from the SAC’s prayer for relief. However, because we find
that the fourth cause of action pleads allegations sufficient to support a
claim of punitive damages, we decline to strike the reference to the fourth
cause of action or punitive damages entirely from the SAC’s prayer for relief.
 
Accordingly, this court GRANTS the Motion as to references to
the first and second causes of action in the SAC’s prayer for relief.
 

Leave to Amend

 
“Where the defect raised by a¿motion¿to¿strike¿or by demurrer
is reasonably capable of cure, leave¿to¿amend¿is routinely and¿liberally¿granted
to give the plaintiff a chance to cure the defect in question.” (CLD
Construction, Inc. v. City of San Ramon (2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 1141, 1146.)
“[An order granting a motion to strike] is analogous to an order sustaining a
demurrer.” (Vaccaro v. Kaiman (1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 761, 768.) “If the
plaintiff has not had an opportunity to amend the complaint in response to the
demurrer, leave to amend is liberally allowed as a matter of fairness, unless
the complaint shows on its face that it is incapable of amendment.” (City of
Stockton v. Superior Court (2007) 42 Cal.4th 730, 747.)
 
We see a possibility that the first and second causes of
action could be amended to include additional factual allegations that support
claims for punitive damages, if such factual allegations exist, such as
allegations about any after-occurring acts by GTO Security that show its
ratification of Reducindo Olivo’s actions. We also observe that although this
is the second amended complaint, only the FAC was previously subject to a
granted motion to strike as Plaintiffs amended the original Complaint voluntary.
 
Accordingly, this court GRANTS leave to amend the SAC.
