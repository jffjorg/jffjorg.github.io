Summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling issued by a judge in a case between Navid Bahrami (Plaintiff) and Farshid Yassian and Dr. Daryoushi Jadali (Defendants). The Plaintiff seeks to set aside a dismissal of the case based on the mandatory relief provisions of CCP section 473(b). The judge finds that the Plaintiff is entitled to mandatory relief because the dismissal was caused by the Plaintiff's counsel's mistake, inadvertence, surprise, and neglect. The counsel was diagnosed with cancer and underwent treatment, which affected his ability to attend a Case Management Conference and an OSC re: dismissal. The judge grants the motion and imposes sanctions on the Plaintiff's counsel of $100.00 each in favor of the Defendants.
