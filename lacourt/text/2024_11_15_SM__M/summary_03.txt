And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel compliance with responses to a request for production of documents. The plaintiff, Jeff Mohr, has failed to produce certain documents, including emails, in response to the request. The defendants, NuBu22 LLC, Christian Yelich, and Alecia Yelich, argue that Mohr has failed to comply with the request and seek to compel him to produce the documents.

The judge finds that Mohr has failed to produce certain documents, including emails, and has deleted potentially relevant emails after initiating the lawsuit. However, the judge is not convinced that Mohr has failed to produce documents in his possession, custody, or control. The judge grants the motion in part, requiring Mohr to amend his response to one of the requests, but denies the motion in all other respects.

The judge also notes that Mohr has conducted a search for documents, including electronic files and hardcopy documents, and has produced documents in response to the request. The judge finds that Mohr's production of documents is reasonable and that the defendants have not shown good cause to require Mohr to hire an independent e-discovery vendor.

Overall, the judge's tentative ruling is a mixed decision, granting some of the defendants' requests while denying others. The judge's ruling is subject to change after considering further briefing and oral argument.
