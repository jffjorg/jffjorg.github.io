Legal
Standard
 
Code of Civil Procedure (CCP)
section 1987.1 states that “[i]f a subpoena requires the attendance of a
witness or the production of books, documents, electronically stored
information, or other things before a court, or at the trial of an issue
therein, or at the taking of a deposition, the court, upon motion reasonably
made by any person described in subdivision (b), or upon the court’s own motion
after giving counsel notice and an opportunity to be heard, may make an order
quashing the subpoena entirely, modifying it, or directing compliance with it
upon those terms or conditions as the court shall declare, including protective
orders.”  (CCP § 1987.1(a).)  “In addition, the court may make any
other order as may be appropriate to protect the person from unreasonable or
oppressive demands, including unreasonable violations of the right of privacy
of the person.”  (Id.)  
   
As a general rule, all unprivileged
information that is relevant to the subject matter of the action is
discoverable if it would itself be admissible evidence at trial or if it
appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.
(CCP § 2017.010; Schnabel v. Superior Court (1993) 5 Cal.4th 704,
711.) Information is relevant if it might reasonably assist a party in
evaluating the case, preparing for trial, or facilitating settlement. (Gonzalez
v. Superior Court (1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 1539, 1546.)
 
Subpoenas which seek consumer
records, including personal financial information, must adhere to additional
procedural requirements laid out in CCP § 1985.3.  The subpoena must first
be served on the consumer at least five days before it is served on the
nonparty from whom records are sought (with a five-day extension if served by
mail, pursuant to CCP § 1013). (CCP, § 1985.3(b)(3).) A subpoena must
be served on the custodian of records at least fifteen days before the date
upon which records are to be produced, plus any statutory extensions. (Id.,
§§ 1985.3(d), 2020.410(c).)
 
CCP section¿2025.410(c) requires
that a motion to quash a deposition notice must be accompanied by a meet and
confer declaration. Additionally, a motion to quash production of
documents at a deposition must be accompanied by a separate statement setting
forth the particular documents or demands at issue and the factual and legal
reasons why production should not be compelled.  (CRC rule 3.1345(a)(5).) 
 
ANALYSIS
 
This is a post-judgment collections
matter. The Court issued a judgment in favor of Cross-Complainant Corey Large against
Cross-Defendant Pao for $752,547.15 on July 11, 2023. Pao’s appeal was remitted
on October 9, 2024. 
 
Pao moves to quash Large’s subpoena
directed to third-party Meloni Hribal Trantor LLP (“Witness”). Large seeks financial,
accounting, and tax records maintained by Witness on behalf of Pao. Pao asserts
that he was never served with a consumer notice or the subpoena as required by
CCP section 1985.3. (Pao Dec., ¶3.) A subpoena which seeks consumer records,
including personal financial information, must adhere to the procedural
requirements of section 1985.3. The subpoena must first be served on the
consumer at least five days before it is served on the nonparty from whom
records are sought (subject to extension by section 1013), on the consumer
personally, or at his or her last known address, or in accordance with Chapter
5 (commencing with Section 1010) of Title 14 of Part 3, or to their attorney of
record. (CCP § 1985.3(b)(1)-(3).) Since the subpoena must be served
on the custodian of records at least fifteen days before the date upon which
records are to be produced, the subpoena must be personally served on the
consumer at least twenty days before the date upon which records are to be
produced. (CCP §§ 1985.3(d), 2020.410(c).) 
 
Pao asserts Large has refused to
serve his counsel concerning the outstanding discovery, that Large “randomly”
mailed documents to “various address throughout Los Angeles, including mailing
certain documents to my place of business in Santa Monica.” (Pao Decl., ¶ 2.)
Pao claims that his friends or coworkers made him aware of the mailings. (Id.) Pao
contends that despite the proof of service stating that Large mailed notice at
an address in Los Angeles (Ex A), he “did not receive the consumer notice and
the subpoena.” (Id. ¶ 3.) Pao complains that he has received mailings from Large
at a Santa Monica address, but the subject consumer notice was not sent to that
address.
 
Large explains that as a part of
his post-judgment discovery efforts, he had the subpoena personally served upon
the Witness on April 30, 2024, at their office at 21600 Oxnard Street, Suite
500, Woodland Hills, California, 91367, calling for document production by May
20, 2024. (Fowler Decl., Ex C.) Prior to doing so, Large mailed the Notice to
Consumer to 1633 South Bentley Avenue, Apartment Number 305, Los Angeles,
California 90025 (“Bentley Avenue Condo”) on April 25, 2024. Large believes
this to be his last known home address. In February 2023, Pao wrote that this address
was a current address on a loan application. (Fowler Decl., Ex. E.) Notably, Pao
fails to deny that this address is, in fact, his address. Instead, he proffers a
limited assertion that he did not actually receive the notice, and that he has
received other notices at his work address. This does not foreclose the
probability that this address is valid. Thus, the totality of the record
suggests that the notice was properly and timely mailed to Pao’s address in
compliance with section 1985.3. 
 
Accordingly, the motion is DENIED.
