And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to quash a subpoena in a post-judgment collections matter. The plaintiff, Large, issued a subpoena to a third-party, Meloni Hribal Trantor LLP, seeking financial, accounting, and tax records maintained by the witness on behalf of the defendant, Pao. Pao asserts that he was not served with a consumer notice or the subpoena as required by CCP section 1985.3. However, the judge finds that the notice was properly and timely mailed to Pao's address, and therefore denies the motion to quash the subpoena.
