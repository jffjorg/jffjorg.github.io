And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting Plaintiff Mina Brugger's motion to compel further responses to her requests for admissions (RFAs) from Defendant Shoghig Dikijian. The RFAs asked the defendant to admit or deny liability for a car crash that occurred on June 19, 2022. The defendant responded by citing lack of sufficient information, but the judge finds this response evasive and contradictory. The judge orders the defendant to provide further responses within 10 days and imposes sanctions of $2,125.00, which must be paid within 30 days. The judge's ruling is based on California Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) sections 2017.010, 2017.020(a), 2019.030, 2033.220, and 2033.290(a)(2), which govern discovery and the scope of requests for admissions.
