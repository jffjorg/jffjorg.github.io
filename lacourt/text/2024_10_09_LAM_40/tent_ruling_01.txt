 [TENTATIVE] RULING RE:
Motion to Compel Responses to Interrogatories and Requests for
  Production of Documents and for Sanctions [RES ID # 7603]



 
I. Background
A. Pleadings
Plaintiff David Gastelo (Gastelo) sues
Defendants Automobile Club of Southern California, Interinsurance Exchange of
the Automobile Club (Auto Club), ACSC Management Services, Inc. (ACSC), HVACi,
HVAC Investigators, Garret Electric, P.W. Stephens, Environmental, Inc.
(Stephens Environmental), Excel Restoration, Inc. (Excel Restoration), Sydney
Klittivit (Klittivit), and Does 1-200 pursuant to a March 14, 2023, Complaint. 
The Complaint alleges claims of:
(1) Bad Faith/Breach of the Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing and
(2) Breach of Contract against AAA and Does 1-25; (3) Breach of Fiduciary Duty
against ACSC and Does 1 through 125; (4) Intentional and (5) Negligent
Interference with Contract against ACSC, HVACi, HVAC Investigators, Garrett
Electric, Stephens, Environmental, Excel Restoration and Does 1 through 125;
(6) Negligence against Stephens Environmental and Does 66 through 85; and (7)
Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress (IIED) against all Defendants. 
The claims arise from a dispute
following an investigation by Auto Club, Gastelo’s insurance company, into a
house fire claim at Gastelo’s property located at 15260 Binney Street, Hacienda
Heights, California 91745. HVAC Investigators was hired by the Auto Club to
inspect the HVAC system. Gastelo claims that HVAC Investigators intentionally
and negligently interfered with Gastelo’s insurance contract and caused severe
emotional distress by assisting the Auto Club in avoiding appropriate payments
to Gastelo.
B. Motion Before the Court
On August 28, 2024, HVAC
Investigators filed the instant motion to compel Gastelo to provide responses
to HVAC Investigators’ (1) Special Interrogatories, Set One, (2) Form
Interrogatories, Set One, and (3) Requests for Production of Documents, Set One.
HVAC Investigators also requests sanctions against Gastelo and his counsel,
jointly and severally, of $3,172.50. 
On September 25, 2024, Gastelo
filed a partial opposition to the motion. He does not dispute that that he
should be required to respond without objection to the sets of discovery, but objects
to the amount of sanctions requested. 
On October 1, 2024, HVAC
Investigators replied to the motion. 
HVAC Investigators’ motion is now
before the Court. 
 
II. Motion
A. Legal Standard
A motion to compel an initial
response can be made on the ground that a party did not serve a timely response
to interrogatories or a demand to produce. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd.
(a) [interrogatories], 2031.300, subd. (a) [demand to produce]; see Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 390, 404 (Sinaiko).) To establish this ground, a movant must
show:
(1) Proper service (see Code Civ.
Proc., §§ 2030.080, subd. (a) [interrogatories], 2031.040 [demand to produce]);
(2) Expiration of the deadline for
the initial response 30 days after service or on date agreed to by parties (see
Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.260, subds. (a), (b) [interrogatories], 2031.260,
subds. (a), (b) [demand to produce]); and
(3) No timely response (see Code
Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290 [interrogatories], 2031.300 [demand to produce]).
The Court retains jurisdiction to
rule on the merits of discovery motions even after requested discovery was
provided after the motion was filed. (Sinaiko, supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at
p. 409.) 
B. Analysis
            Here, HVAC
Investigators served: 1) Form Interrogatories, Set One, 2) Special
Interrogatories, Set One, and 3) Requests for Production of Documents, Set One
on Gastelo on January 18, 2024 (Muñoz Decl. ¶ 2, Ex. 1.)
Service was made electronically,
making the responsive due date February 20, 2024. Gastelo and HVAC
Investigators agreed to a 30-day extension for Gastelo to provide responses by
March 21, 2024, and then an additional 15-day extension to provide responses by
April 5, 2024. (Mot. p. 4:3:7.) HVAC Investigators asserts that as of the date
of the underlying motion, Gastelo has still not produced verified responses to
the discovery requests. (Muñoz Decl. ¶ 3.)
Gastelo does not dispute that he
should be required to respond. 
Accordingly, HVAC Investigators’ motion
to compel discovery responses to: 1)
Form Interrogatories, Set One, 2) Special Interrogatories, Set One, and 3)
Requests for Production of Documents, Set One is GRANTED. 
 
III. Request for Sanctions
The Court must impose monetary
sanctions against anyone—party, nonparty, or attorney—who unsuccessfully makes
or opposes the motion, unless it finds that the person to be sanctioned acted
with substantial justification or other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanctions unjust. (See Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (c)
[interrogatories], 2031.300, subd. (c) [demand to produce]; see Sinaiko Healthcare
Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants, supra, 148
Cal.App.4th at p. 404 [interrogatories and demand to produce].)
The court may award sanctions under
the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery,
even though no opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to the motion
was withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party
after the motion was filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1348, subd. (a).)
Even after a party provides
discovery responses, a party can keep its motion on calendar and the court has
authority to grant sanctions, even if it denies the motion to compel responses
“as essentially unnecessary, in whole or in part.” (Sinaiko, supra, at
p. 409.)
HVAC Investigators requests
sanctions against Gastelo and his counsel of record, Bay Cities Law Group, in
the total amount of $3,172.50 based upon: (1) Counsel Muñoz’s rate of
$265.00/hour for 2.0 hours of work preparing the motion, and (2) 1.5 hours for
Counsel Muñoz to review the opposition, prepare a reply, and appear at the
hearing, as well as (3) Counsel Silva’s rate of $230.00/hour for 7.5 hours of
work preparing the motion, (4) 2.0 hours for Counsel Silva to review the
opposition and prepare a reply, and (5) $60.00 in filing fees. (Mot., Muñoz
Decl. ¶¶ 14-16.)
Gastelo argues that the amount of
sanctions requested is excessive. Gastelo’s counsel asserts that the purported time
spent drafting the motion and reply is overstated. (Opp. p. 2.)  Gastelo requests 30 days to respond and asks
that any sanctions be imposed solely on Bay Cities Law Group because Gastelo
was not responsible for the delays in serving the responses. (Opp. p. 3.) 
Here, without more detailed explanation,
the work done by Mr. Muñoz and Ms. Silva appears duplicative. Accordingly, Mr. Muñoz’s
hours will be reduced by 1.0 hour and Ms. Silva hours will be reduced by 1.0
hour. 
The request for sanctions is GRANTED in the reduced amount of $2,677.50
as against Bay Cities Law Group.
IV. Conclusion
Defendant HVAC Investigators Motion to Compel Responses to Interrogatories
and Requests for Production of Documents and for Sanctions is GRANTED. Plaintiff
David Gastelo is ordered to serve fully compliant responses within 30 calendar
days. 
The request for sanctions is GRANTED in the reduced amount of $2,677.50
against Bay Cities Law Group only,
to be paid within 30 calendar days.
