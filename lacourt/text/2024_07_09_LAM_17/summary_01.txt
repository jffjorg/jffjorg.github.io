And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the plaintiff's motion to compel responses to her supplemental Requests for Production (RFPs) and Special Interrogatories. The court finds that the motion is now moot because the defendant has already served supplemental responses. The court also declines to award sanctions at this time, stating that the issue could have been avoided with adequate meet and confer between the parties. The court orders that the motion is denied, and that the parties who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the court by 4 p.m. the day prior to the hearing.
