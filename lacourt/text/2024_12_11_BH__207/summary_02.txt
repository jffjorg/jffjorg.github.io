And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge is considering the definition of "work product" in the context of a court case. The Judge notes that the language of section 2018.030 does not provide a clear definition of work product, and therefore, courts have developed different approaches to determine what constitutes work product. The Judge cites various cases, including Coito and People v. Superior Court (Jones), which have held that only derivative or interpretive material, such as diagrams, audit reports, and expert opinions, constitutes work product. On the other hand, nonderivative material, such as physical evidence or witness identities, does not constitute work product. The Judge also notes that work product includes materials compiled by investigators and other agents in preparation for trial. The Judge intends to clarify the definition of work product based on the information presented and the case law cited.
