And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has ruled that RSG Group USA Inc.'s motion to quash service of the summons and Second Amended Complaint is granted. The judge found that the summons served on RSG had a blank "To the person served" section, violating Code of Civil Procedure section 412.30, and that this makes the service of the summons insufficient to confer jurisdiction. The judge also noted that RSG did not cite any authority to support its proposition that Plaintiff's failure to obtain a stipulation or proper leave to add defendants deprives the Court of jurisdiction.
