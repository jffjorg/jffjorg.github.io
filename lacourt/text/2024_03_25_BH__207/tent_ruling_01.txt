MOTION
 
Robert Roetzel (“Counsel”) has filed a verified application to appear
as counsel pro hac vice for Plaintiff Michael Hart (“Plaintiff”).  The application is unopposed.
 
ANALYSIS
 
            California Rules of Court rule 9.40
provides that an attorney in good standing in another jurisdiction may apply to
appear as counsel pro hac vice in the State of California by filing a verified
application together with proof of service by mail of a copy of the application
and notice of hearing on all parties who have appeared in the case and on the
State Bar of California at its San Francisco office, with payment of a $50.00
fee, so long as that attorney is not a resident of the State of California, and
is not regularly engaged in substantial business, professional, or other
activities in the State of California. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 9.40.)
 
The application must state: (1) the applicant’s residence and office
addresses; (2) the courts to which the applicant has been admitted to practice
and the dates of admission; (3) that the applicant is a member of good standing
in those courts; (4) that the applicant is not currently suspended or disbarred
in any court; (5) the title of each court and cause in which the applicant has
filed an application to appear as counsel pro hac vice in this state in the
preceding two years, the date of each application, and whether or not it was
granted; and (6) the name, address, and telephone number of the active member
of the State Bar of California who is attorney of record in the local action. (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 9.40(d).)
 
            The Court finds that the application
provides all this information.  With
regard to notice on to the State Bar, Counsel has provided proofs of service
indicating that the State Bar was served with the application, notice of
hearing, and proposed order.
 
            However, the verified application
indicates, “I, Robert E. Snider, hereby submit this verified application to appear
as counsel pro hac vice […]” yet the application is signed by Robert E
Roetzel.  Moreover, the proposed order indicates
“Robert E. Roetzel Law PC may appear as counsel […]” yet the headers indicate
Robert Roetzel works on behalf of the law firm Furtado Law PC.  Therefore, the Court cannot grant the application
as submitted.
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER 
 
In light of the identified
discrepancies in Counsel’s application, the Court denies without prejudice Counsel’s
application to appear pro hac vice.  
 
Counsel for Plaintiff shall
give notice and file a proof of service of such.
