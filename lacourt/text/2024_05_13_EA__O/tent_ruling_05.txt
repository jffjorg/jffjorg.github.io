 Case Number:  24PSCV00329    Hearing Date:   May 13, 2024    Dept:  O Tentative Ruling   MOTION TO STRIKE PLAINTIFF’S COMPLAINT FOR CORPORATE  FRAUD AND CRIME AND MEMORANDUM OF POINTS is CONTINUED to 6/25/24; see  also briefing schedule re: deeming Plaintiff a vexatious litigant.    Background   This case arises from a car accident that happened on  1/31/2020.    On February 1, 2024, Plaintiff Bin Yang filed suit against  Mercury Insurance Company for Corporate Fraud and Crime based upon Mercury’s  alleged mishandling of an insurance claim.    On March 18, 2024, Defenant filed the instant motion to  strike (MTS) to strike Plaintiff’s complaint.    On April 26, 2024, Plaintiff filed her opposition.   On May 6, 2024, Defendant filed its reply.    Discussion   The court is inclined to continue the MTS to June 25, 2024  (the date of the CMC). The MTS is largely predicated upon the doctrine of res  judicata because a final judgment (dismissal without prejudice) was entered in  the case of 23PSCV00230, a case based upon identical facts and  allegations.[1]  Not only has there been a judgment in a related case, but this is the third action  filed against Defendant Mercury based upon the same allegations (24PSCV00329,  21STCV23749, and 23PSCV00230).    Plaintiff’s unmeritorious papers, however, have not only  been present in the foregoing cases but multiple other cases (see e.g., Bin  Yang v. Allstate (23PSCV00229), Bin Yang v. Interinsurance Exachange  [sic] of the Automobile Club (23PSCV01807), and Bin Yang v. Automobile  Club (23PSCV01160). In fact, in 23PSCV01807 case, Plaintiff, on 11/6/23,  filed a ‘Notice of Urgent Need to Stop Man-Made Heart Attack in California,’  which related to the same car accident.[2]    With  that, the court is inclined, on its own motion, to deem Plaintiff a vexatious  litigant. California Code of Civil Procedure (CCP section 391 provides  four ways in which a plaintiff may be deemed a vexatious litigant. Of  pertinence here is CCP section 391 section (3) which states the following:   In any litigation while acting in propria persona, repeatedly files unmeritorious motions, pleadings, or other papers, conducts unnecessary  discovery, or engages in other tactics that are frivolous  or solely intended to cause unnecessary delay. (emphasis added).    Here, a review of Plaintiff’s papers in these three related  cases illustrates that they are all unmeritorious because they fail to state a  cognizable claim as a matter of law and are predicted upon incoherent  allegations. Additionally, Plaintiff repeatedly dismisses actions but then  refiles cases, indicating that she is unnecessarily causing delay.    Should the parties desire to file briefs on the issue of  whether to deem Plaintiff a vexatious litigant, they are invited to do so. Should  the parties do so, briefs must be submitted by Monday, June 10, 2024.    Therefore, the  hearing on the MTS and motion to deem Plaintiff a vexatious litigant will be  held on Monday, June 25, 2024 at 10:00 AM.
