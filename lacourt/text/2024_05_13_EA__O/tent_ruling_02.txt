 Case Number:  23PSCV01804    Hearing Date:   May 13, 2024    Dept:  O Tentative Ruling
 
Plaintiffs’
Application for Default Judgment is GRANTED, but Plaintiffs are to submit a
NEW proposed order seeking $30,000 (not $33,000). 
 
Background
 
This case arises from an unpaid loan.
 
On June 16, 2023, Plaintiffs Jing Chen and Chunmei Liu filed
suit against Defendant Ching Chai Chung alleging that Defendant did not pay
Plaintiffs the $30,000 they lent him. 
 
On December 22, 2023, default was entered against defendant.

 
On March 6, 2024, Plaintiffs filed their default judgment
application material (and a few filed thereafter). 
 
Discussion
 
The
California Supreme Court has made clear that “in all default judgments the
demand sets a ceiling on recovery.” (Greenup v. Rodman (1986) 42 Cal.3d
822, 824.) 
 
Here, the
complaint seeks that the court “fully compensate $30,000.00 or pay $30,000.00
by installments.” (Complaint p. 2 of 24 of PDF.) And as the evidence submitted
is a check made from Plaintiff Jing Chen to Defendant in the amount of $30,000,
then recovery is limited to $30,000. The mere fact that Defendant promised to
pay Plaintiffs $33,000 is not the basis of the damages as alleged in the
complaint. 
 
Therefore,
Plaintiffs are to file a modified default judgment proposed order that seeks
$30,000. 
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the
foregoing, the default judgment is granted effective upon submission of a new
proposed judgment.
