And here is the English text summary of the tentative ruling:

The court has granted the motion of Plaintiff's Counsel, Edward M. Morgan, to be relieved as counsel in the premises liability case. The motion was filed on April 11, 2024, and a declaration regarding failure to file proof of service was filed on April 15, 2024. The court finds good cause to grant the motion due to the lack of communication between the Plaintiff and Counsel, which has prevented effective litigation of the matter. The court also notes that there are no substantive motions on calendar requiring urgent need of counsel. As a result, the motion is granted effective upon service of the motion and the court's order upon the Plaintiff.
