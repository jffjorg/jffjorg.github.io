And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants the plaintiffs' application for default judgment, but with a condition. The judge rules that the recovery is limited to $30,000, as stated in the complaint. The judge references the California Supreme Court's decision in Greenup v. Rodman (1986) to support this ruling. The judge orders the plaintiffs to submit a new proposed order seeking $30,000, not $33,000 as initially requested. This decision is based on the evidence presented, including a check made out to the defendant in the amount of $30,000. The judge's ruling is effective upon the submission of the new proposed order.
