Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is inclined to continue a motion to strike the Plaintiff's complaint, Bin Yang, to June 25, 2024. The motion is based on the doctrine of res judicata, as a final judgment was entered in a related case (23PSCV00230). Additionally, the Plaintiff has filed multiple lawsuits based on the same allegations, and has repeatedly filed unmeritorious papers in multiple cases. The court is also inclined to deem Plaintiff a vexatious litigant, as Plaintiff's papers fail to state a cognizable claim as a matter of law and are predicted upon incoherent allegations. The court invites the parties to file briefs on the issue of whether to deem Plaintiff a vexatious litigant, with briefs due by June 10, 2024. The hearing on the motion to strike and the motion to deem Plaintiff a vexatious litigant will be held on June 25, 2024 at 10:00 AM.
