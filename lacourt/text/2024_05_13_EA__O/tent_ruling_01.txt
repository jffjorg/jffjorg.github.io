  Case Number:  23PSCV01696    Hearing Date:   May 13, 2024    Dept:  O Tentative Ruling
 
Plaintiff’s
Counsel, Edward M. Morgan, Motion to be Relieved as Counsel is GRANTED, effective
upon [see below]. 
 
Background
 
This is a premises liability case. 
 
On June 6, 2023, Plaintiff Daniel Galusha filed suit against
Defendants City of San Dimas, COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES, a public entity; STATE OF
CALIFORNIA, a public entity; CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION, a public
entity; RAGING WATERS OF CALIFORNIA, LTD., a Utah Corporation; FESTIVAL FUN
PARKS, a Delaware Limited Liability company; and Does 1 to 50, inclusive
alleging that they were negligent because they failed to mark a concrete wall
and/or barrier such that Plaintiff collided into it. 
 
On April 11, 2024, Plaintiff’s Counsel filed the instant
motion. 
 
On April 15, 2024, Plaintiff’s Counsel filed a declaration
re: OSC re: Failure to file proof of service. 
 
Discussion
 
According to Counsel Morgan, he seeks to be relieved as
counsel because he has been unable to communicate with Plaintiff. Based on that
lack of communication, Plaintiff’s Counsel has also not effectuated service on
any Defendants as to “avoid the significant expenditure of funds and/or
resources in serving the named Defendants.” (See OSC Declaration.) 
 
Here, as Plaintiff is no longer communicating with Counsel
which precludes effective litigation of the matter, the court finds good cause
in granting the motion. As for prejudice, Plaintiff has not filed an opposition
to assert any concern nor are there any substantive motions on calendar
requiring urgent need of counsel. 
 
Therefore, as Counsel has complied with the California Rules
of Court, the motion is granted. 
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing, the motion is granted effective upon
service of motion and the court’s order upon Plaintiff.
