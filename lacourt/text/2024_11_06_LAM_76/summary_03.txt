  - "It is clear that the Legislature knew when it needed to refer to 'any person acting on behalf of the employer' (Lab. Code, § 1102.5) and its reference to only an 'employer' in Lab.

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendants' demurrer to the plaintiff's first amended complaint. The plaintiff alleges that he was terminated for complaining about and refusing to participate in his employer's fraudulent scheme of submitting inflated invoices to insurance companies. The defendants, Carl Tetiva, Craig Tom, and Frank Murphy, argue that the plaintiff's retaliation claim fails because individual defendants cannot be held liable under Labor Code § 1102.5. The judge agrees and sustains the demurrer to the first cause of action without leave to amend as to the defendants. The judge's analysis is based on statutory construction and the intention of the Legislature in enacting Labor Code § 1102.5. The judge concludes that the Legislature did not intend to hold individuals liable in a civil action for damages brought by an employee.
