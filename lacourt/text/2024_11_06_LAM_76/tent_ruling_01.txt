ANALYSIS
Defendant Westmoreland Los Angeles,
LLC’s Demurrer
Meet and Confer
            The form Declaration
of Jamie Kim reflects that Defendant’s counsel satisfied the meet and confer requirement
set forth in Civ. Proc. Code, § 430.41.
 Discussion
Defendant
Westmoreland Los Angeles, LLC demurs to the First Amended Complaint as follows:
1.         Second
Cause of Action (Breach of Implied Warranty of Habitability).
            Defendant
argues that, as to each Plaintiff, there are insufficient allegations that there
was notice to the landlord within a reasonable time after the tenant’s discovery
of the condition, and that the landlord failed to correct the deficiency after being
given a reasonable time. 
 The California Supreme
Court has held that because “under contemporary conditions, public policy compels
landlords to bear the primary responsibility for maintaining safe, clean and habitable
housing in our state,” there is a warranty of habitability implied in residential
leases in California. (Green, supra, 10 Cal.3d at p. 627.) In Green,
the court explained that “[t]his [*1297] 
implied warranty of habitability does not require that a landlord ensure
that leased premises are in  perfect, aesthetically
pleasing condition, but it does mean that ‘bare living requirements’ must be maintained.
In most cases substantial compliance with those applicable building and housing
code standards which materially affect health and safety will suffice to meet the
landlord’s obligations under the common law implied warranty of habitability we
now recognize.” (Id. at p. 637, fns. omitted.)  The court held that a tenant may assert the landlord’s
breach of the implied warranty of habitability as a defense to an unlawful detainer
proceeding. (Id. at pp. 631–637.) Moreover, a landlord’s obligation to maintain
premises in a habitable condition is one that continues throughout the term of the
lease. (Peterson v. Superior Court (1995) 10 Cal.4th 1185, 1204 [43 Cal.
Rptr. 2d 836, 899 P.2d 905].) In the event of a landlord’s breach of the implied
warranty of habitability, the tenant is not absolved of the obligation to pay rent;
rather the tenant remains liable for the reasonable rental value as determined by
the court for the period that the defective condition of the premises existed. (Stoiber
v. Honeychuck (1980) 101 Cal.App.3d 903, 914 [162 Cal. Rptr. 194]; Hinson
v. Delis (1972) 26 Cal.App.3d 62, 70 [102 Cal. Rptr. 661], disapproved on another
ground in Knight, supra, 29 Cal.3d 46, 55, fn. 7; see Code Civ. Proc., §
1174.2, subd. (a) [in unlawful detainer action after nonpayment of rent, where tenant
proves substantial breach of habitability warranty, court determines reasonable
rental value of premises in its untenantable condition].)
In addition to asserting a breach of the habitability warranty
as a defense to an unlawful detainer action, a tenant may bring suit against the
landlord for damages resulting from such breach. (Landeros v. Pankey (1995)
39 Cal.App.4th 1167, 1169 [46 Cal. Rptr. 2d 165]; Miller & Starr, Cal. Real
Estate (3d ed. 2004) § 19:121, p. 362; Friedman et al., Cal. Practice Guide: Landlord-Tenant
(The Rutter Group 2013) ¶¶ 3:97 to 3:100, pp. 3-40.4 to 3-40.5 (rev. # 1, 2009,
2013).) The elements of such an affirmative claim are the existence of a material
defective condition affecting the premises’ habitability, notice to the landlord
of the condition within a reasonable time after the tenant’s discovery of the condition,
the landlord was given a reasonable time to correct the deficiency, and resulting
damages. (Quevedo v. Braga (1977) 72 Cal.App.3d Supp. 1, 7–8 [140 Cal. Rptr.
143] (Quevedo), disapproved on other grounds in Knight, supra, 29
Cal.3d at p. 55, fn. 7; see Friedman et al., supra, ¶ 3:100, p. 3-40.5 (rev.
# 1, 2013).)
According to the Quevedo court, the measure of damages
is the amount of rent that the landlord should refund, calculated by the difference
between the [*1298]  rent paid while the premises
were uninhabitable and the rent that “would have been reasonable, taking into account
the extent to which the rental value of the property was reduced by virtue of the
existence of the defect.” (Quevedo, supra, 72 Cal.App.3d at p. Supp. 8.)
Other methods of calculating a tenant’s damages for breach of the habitability warranty
include (1) the difference between the fair rental value of the premises had they
been in the condition warranted and their fair rental value with the uninhabitable
condition (Green, supra, 10 Cal.3d at p. 638), and (2) the rent paid by the
tenant multiplied by the percentage of the premises rendered unusable due to the
uninhabitable condition (id. at p. 639, fn. 24; Cazares v. Ortiz (1980)
109 Cal.App.3d Supp. 23, 33 [168 Cal. Rptr. 108]).
. . .
In Stoiber v. Honeychuck, supra, 101 Cal.App.3d 903
(Stoiber), the court held that a tenant may maintain a tort action against
his landlord for damages suffered by way of annoyance or discomfort or for injury
to his personal property caused by the landlord’s failure to keep the premises in
a habitable condition under the expansive rationale of Rowland v. Christian
(1968) 69 Cal.2d 108 [70 Cal. Rptr. 97, 443 P.2d 561]. (Stoiber, supra, 101
[*1299]  Cal.App.3d at pp. 916–919.) The Stoiber
court concluded “that the availability of a remedy for breach of implied warranty
of habitability does not preclude a tenant from suing his landlord for intentional
infliction of mental distress if the landlord’s acts are extreme and outrageous
and result in severe mental distress.” (Id. at p. 922.) Whether this is so
under the present allegations presents a factual question; however, it cannot be
said as a matter of law that appellant has not stated such a claim.
Furthermore, “the negligent infliction of emotional
distress—anxiety, worry, discomfort—is compensable without physical injury in cases
involving the tortious interference with property rights [citations].” (Stoiber,
supra, 101 Cal.App.3d at p. 922.) Thus, if Sierra’s failure to repair the premises
constitutes a tort grounded on negligence, appellant is entitled to prove his damages
for emotional distress because the failure to repair must be deemed to constitute
an injury to his tenancy interest (right to habitable premises), which is a species
of property. (Id. at p. 923.)
(Erlach v. Sierra Asset Servicing, LLC (2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 1281, 1296-99.)
 
            Defendant Westmorland
Los Angeles, LLC allegedly has owned the property only since June 2022. (2AC, ¶
19.)
 
            The second cause
of actions set forth the general uninhabitable conditions at ¶¶ 125, 126.) At ¶¶
97 – 105, the 2AC alleges the injuries suffered by each Plaintiff. ¶ 50 alleges
in general terms that: 
 
Through their respective tenancies, including
in 2021 and 2022, each Plaintiff reported habitability problems including the pest
infestations and plumbing problems, such as unreliable hot water and low water pressure,
to Defendant Jeanie Lee. Each Plaintiff alleges on information and belief that Defendant
Jeanie Lee, who functioned as an agent of the Kim Defendants and the Westmoreland
Defendants, was fully aware of each of the deplorable conditions in the units and
the common areas of the Property, because tenants other than Plaintiffs also reported
problems such as pest infestations and defective plumbing to Defendant Jeanie Lee
in 2021 and 2022.
 
     (2AC, ¶ 50.)
 
            At ¶¶ 51 – 57
alleges with more facts when each Plaintiff notified any
of the Defendants of each defect, and Defendant’s failure to address each defect
within a reasonable period. The Court finds that, reading the 2AC as a whole[1],
this cause of action is sufficiently pled. 
 
            The
demurrer to the second cause of action is OVERRULED.
 
2.         Fifth
Cause of Action (Premises Liability).
 
            Defendant
argues that the allegations are vague as to which Plaintiff was in a specific landlord-tenant
relationship with which specific Defendants, in which period of time, as there are
8 different plaintiffs alleging to be in a landlord-tenant relationship with at
least 5 different Defendants. Defendants also argue that the allegations of harm
are vague and boilerplate.   
 
            First,
there is generally no privity of estate between a sublessee and the master landlord
and Plaintiffs do not allege any facts whereby they assumed the obligations of the
master lease.
 
The general rule
is that every sublease is subject to the terms and conditions of the master lease.
( Georgeous v. Lewis, 20 Cal.App. 255
[128 P. 768]; Pedro v. Potter, 197 Cal. 751
[242 P. 926, 42 A.L.R. 1165]; Agoure v. Plummer, 175 Cal. 543
[166 P. 311].) The addition
of the provision, “This lease subject to all terms & conditions of the Hancock
Master Lease,” merely states the rule of law. “The sublessee is not in privity of
contract with the head landlord, since there are no contractual relations between
them, and he is not in privity of estate with him, since there is no relation of
tenancy between them and he merely holds possession for the lessee.” (1 Tiffany,
Real Property [3d ed.], § 124.) 
 
(Johnson v. Couch (1961) 189 Cal.App.2d 687, 691.)
 
A subtenant who expressly assumes the obligations of the prime
lease, with the consent of the landlord, comes into privity of contract with the
landlord, and the latter can enforce the assumption agreement as a third party beneficiary.
( Hartman Ranch Co. v. Associated Oil Co., supra,
10 Cal. 2d at pp. 244-245; Marchese v. Standard Realty &
Dev. Co., supra, 74 Cal. App. 3d at p. 147.) So while we view
this as an assignment, BACC would not escape liability even as a sublessee. We turn
then to the impact of foreclosure on BACC.
 
     (Vallely Invs. v. Bancamerica Commercial Corp.
(2001) 88 Cal. App. 4th 816, 823.)
 
            However,
a premises liability theory is negligence based, and does not require privity of
estate or contract, but rather is a duty-based analysis. 
 
[T]he landlord’s responsibility to inspect
is limited. Like a residential landlord, the duty to inspect charges the lessor
“only with those matters which would have been disclosed by a reasonable inspection.”
(Citations omitted.) The burden of reducing or avoiding the risk and the likelihood
of injury will affect the determination of what constitutes a reasonable inspection.
The landlord’s obligation is only to do what is reasonable under the circumstances.
The landlord need not take extraordinary measures or make unreasonable expenditures
of time and money in trying to discover hazards unless the circumstances so warrant.
When there is a potential serious danger, which is foreseeable, a landlord should
anticipate the danger and conduct a reasonable inspection before passing possession
to the tenant. However, if no such inspection is warranted, the landlord has no
such obligation.

FOOTNOTES

n8 Lessors also have the duty to take reasonable steps to prevent injury when the
landowner knows of a dangerous situation, and the landowner has the right and ability
to reenter. (Citations omitted.)

(Mora v. Baker Commodities (1989) 210 Cal. App. 3d 771, 782.)
 
In California, it has long been the law
that a person may be liable for injuries resulting from his failure to use ordinary
care in the management of his property. (Citations omitted.)  It makes no difference whether the danger posed
by said lack of care manifests itself in the form of a natural as opposed to an
artificial condition on the property. (Citation omitted.) Further, a landowner may
face liability for injury to another, incurred outside of the former’s property
(on an adjacent street), if the injury is found to be caused by a traffic obstruction
in the form of shrubbery growing from the property. (Citation omitted.)


(Swanberg v. O’Mectin (1984)
157 Cal.App.3d 325, 330.)
 
The elements of a negligence claim and a premises liability claim are
the same: a legal duty of care, breach of that duty, and proximate cause resulting
in injury. (Castellon v. U.S. Bancorp (2013) 220 Cal.App.4th 994, 998 [163
Cal. Rptr. 3d 637]; see Ladd v. County of San Mateo (1996) 12 Cal.4th 913,
917 [50 Cal. Rptr. 2d 309, 911 P.2d 496] [negligence cause of action]; Ortega
v. Kmart Corp. (2001) 26 Cal.4th 1200, 1205 [114 Cal. Rptr. 2d 470, 36 P.3d
11] [cause of action for premises liability].) Premises liability “‘is grounded
in the possession of the premises and the attendant right to control and manage
the premises’”; accordingly, “‘mere possession with its attendant right to control
conditions on the premises is a sufficient basis for the imposition of an affirmative
duty to act.’” (Preston v. Goldman (1986) 42 Cal.3d 108, 118 [227 Cal. Rptr.
817, 720 P.2d 476], italics omitted, quoting Sprecher v. Adamson Companies
(1981) 30 Cal.3d 358, 368, 370 [178 Cal. Rptr. 783, 636 P.2d 1121].) But the duty
arising from possession and control of property is adherence to the same standard
of care that applies in negligence cases. (Rowland, supra, 69 Cal.2d
at p. 119 [“The proper test to be applied to the liability of the possessor of land
… is whether in the management of his property he has acted as a reasonable man
in view of the probability of injury to others … .”]; accord, Alcaraz v. Vece
(1997) 14 Cal.4th 1149, 1156 [60 Cal. Rptr. 2d 448, 929 P.2d 1239].) In determining
whether a premises owner owes a duty to persons on its property, we apply [* 1159]
the Rowland factors. (See, e.g., Thai v. Stang (1989) 214 Cal.App.3d
1264, 1271 [263 Cal. Rptr. 202] [Rowland analysis applies to premises liability
cases].) Indeed, Rowland itself involved premises liability. (Rowland,
at p. 110.)
 
     (Kesner v. Superior Court (2016) 1 Cal.5th 1132, 1158-59.)
 
            Here,
at ¶¶ 97 – 105, the 2AC alleges the injuries suffered by each Plaintiff to
their persons and their personal property, and the alleged dangerous condition which
caused such injuries. 
 
Where alleged negligence has caused personal [*588]  injury or property damage and economic loss, the
existence of a duty of care is the rule, not the exception. (Civ. Code, § 1714;
Elam v. College Park Hospital (1982) 132 Cal.App.3d 332, 339 [183 Cal. Rptr.
156] [“‘Duty’ is thus presumed …”].) 
 
(S. Cal. Gas Leak Cases (2017) 18 Cal.App.5th 581, 587-88.)
 
            The
Court finds that this cause of action is sufficiently pled. 
 
            The
demurrer to the fifth cause of action is OVERRULED. 
 
3.         Seventh
Cause of Action (Willful Interruption of Services, Civil Code, § 789.3).
 
Defendant
did not present any argument in support of this demurrer.
 
            As
such, the demurrer to the seventh cause of action is OVERRULED.
 
4.         Eighth
Cause of Action (Retaliation – Violation of Civil Code, § 1942.5 and common law).
 
Defendant
argues that Plaintiffs do not allege that the details of their attempts to exercise
their rights against demurring Defendant. 
 
Civil Code § 1942.5
provides in pertinent part:
 
(a) If the lessor retaliates against
the lessee because of the exercise by the lessee of the lessee’s rights under this
chapter or because of the lessee’s complaint to an appropriate agency as to tenantability
of a dwelling, and if the lessee of a dwelling is not in default as to the payment
of rent, the lessor may not recover possession of a dwelling in any action or proceeding,
cause the lessee to quit involuntarily, increase the rent, or decrease any services
within 180 days of any of the following:
 
(1) After the date upon which the lessee, in good
faith, has given notice pursuant to Section 1942, has provided notice of a suspected
bed bug infestation, or has made an oral complaint to the lessor regarding tenantability.
 
(2) After the date upon which the lessee, in good
faith, has filed a written complaint, or an oral complaint which is registered or
otherwise recorded in writing, with an appropriate agency, of which the lessor has
notice, for the purpose of obtaining correction of a condition relating to tenantability.
 
(3) After the date of an inspection or issuance of
a citation, resulting from a complaint described in paragraph (2) of which the lessor
did not have notice.
 
(4) After the filing of appropriate
documents commencing a judicial or arbitration proceeding involving the issue of
tenantability.
 
(5) After entry of judgment or the signing
of an arbitration award, if any, when in the judicial proceeding or arbitration
the issue of tenantability is determined adversely to the lessor.
 
In each instance, the 180-day period shall run
from the latest applicable date referred to in paragraphs (1) to (5), inclusive.
 
. . .
 
     (Civ Code § 1942.5(a)[bold
emphasis added].)
 
            As
for the common law cause of action for retaliatory eviction:
 
In Aweeka v. Bonds (1971) 20 Cal. App. 3d 278, 281 [97 Cal.
Rptr. 650] (Aweeka), the court held that not only may a tenant use retaliation
as a defense to an unlawful detainer action, a tenant may also allege an affirmative
cause of action for retaliatory eviction. In Aweeka the tenants gave
notice to the landlord that unless repairs to their apartment were made, they would
deduct the cost of the repairs from their rent. In response the landlord almost
doubled their rent. After they were unsuccessful in obtaining an injunction against
enforcement of the rent increase, the tenants voluntarily vacated the premises.
In finding that a common law cause of action for retaliatory eviction existed on these
facts, the court stated: “We can discern no rational basis for allowing such a substantive
defense while denying an affirmative cause of action. It would be unfair and unreasonable
to require a tenant, subjected to a retaliatory rent increase by the landlord, to
wait and raise the matter as a defense only, after he is confronted with an unlawful
detainer action and a possible lien on his personal property.” ( Id. at p. 281; see also Glaser v. Meyers (1982)
137 Cal. App. 3d 770, 776 [187 Cal. Rptr. 242] (Glaser).)

     (Rich
v. Schwab (1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 803, 810.)
 
            Here, Plaintiffs allege at
¶¶ 51 – 57 alleges with more facts when each Plaintiff
notified the Defendants of each defect. ¶¶ 188 – 195 allege how Defendant retaliated
against each Plaintiff following such complaints. This cause of action is sufficiently
pled.
 
The demurrer
to the eighth cause of action is OVERRULED.
 
5.         Night
Cause of Action (Harassment).
 
            Defendant
argues that the Complaint fails to allege any harassing conduct by demurring Defendant
with factual support. 
 
¶ 199 of the
21AC cites Civil Code, § 1940.2(a)(3), which provides:
 
(a) It is unlawful for a landlord to
do any of the following for the purpose of influencing a tenant to vacate a dwelling:
. . . 
 
(3) Use, or threaten to use, force, willful threats, or menacing conduct
constituting a course of conduct that interferes with the tenant’s quiet enjoyment of the premises in violation of
Section 1927 that would create an apprehension of harm in a reasonable person.
Nothing in this paragraph requires a tenant to be actually or constructively evicted
in order to obtain relief.
     (Civ Code § 1940.2(a)[bold emphasis added].)
 
            Here,
¶ 202 alleges that:
 
[E]ach Plaintiff
was in reasonable apprehension of harm because of the acts or failures to act by
each Defendant. Each Plaintiff reasonably apprehended physical harm, such as bug
bites and allergic reactions or symptoms, when the Owner-Manager Defendants refused
or failed to correct the substandard conditions at the Property, including rampant
pest infestations. Each Plaintiff reasonably apprehended harm in the prospect of
imminent homelessness when Defendants reduced utility services at the Property;
the Westmoreland Defendants, Jamie Kim, and Defendant Jeanie Lee colluded to evict
Plaintiffs from the Property; and the Westmoreland Defendants and Jamie Kim allowed
workers to tear down Plaintiffs’ units and discard their personal belongings while
shouting at and threatening Plaintiffs.
 
            The
alleged apprehension of harm is clearly not the type contemplated by reasonable
construction of Civil Code, § 1940.2(a)(3). The type of harm contemplated is that
of being assaulted and/or battered due to the person engaged in the menacing conduct,
not the attenuated annoyance or inconvenience which Plaintiffs allege. The Court
reads the statute as requiring a direct connection between apprehension of harm
attributed to the use, or threat to use, force, willful threats, or menacing conduct
by the landlord, not from bugs and homelessness. 
 
            However,
the allegation that the Westmoreland Defendants and Jamie Kim allowed workers to
tear down Plaintiffs’ units and discard their personal belongings while shouting
at and threatening Plaintiffs (¶ 202) is enough to satisfy the Civ. Code, § 1940.2(a) and survive demurrer.
 
As such, the
demurrer to the ninth cause of action is OVERRULED. 
 
6.         Tenth
Cause of Action (Business and Professions Code § 17200, et seq.)
 
            Defendant
argues that Plaintiffs have not identified the statute which was allegedly violated.
Nor do Plaintiffs alleged facts whereby Defendant engaged in unfair or fraudulent
business practices, nor injury in fact. 
 
            “[S]tatutory causes of action
must be pleaded with particularity.” (Covenant Care, Inc. v. Superior Court (2004) 32 Cal.4th 771, 790.)
 
Section 17200 “prohibits, and provides civil remedies for, unfair competition,
which it defines as ‘any unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business act or practice.’
[Citation.] Its purpose ‘is to protect both consumers and competitors by promoting
fair competition in commercial markets for goods  [*1554] 
and services.’ [Citations.]” (Citation omitted.) Although section 17200 contains
sweeping language as to what is considered a business practice, standing to sue
under the statute, as defined by Business and Professions Code section 17204, is
confined “ ‘to any “person who has suffered injury in fact and has lost money or
property” as a result of unfair competition [citations].’ “ (Citation omitted.)
In other words, to have standing to bring a section 17200 cause of action, a plaintiff
must “(1) establish a loss or deprivation of money or property sufficient to qualify
as injury in fact, i.e., economic injury, and (2) show that the economic injury
was the result of, i.e., caused by, the unfair business practice or false advertising
that is the gravamen of the claim.” (Citation omitted.) As to the injury in fact,
or economic injury, requirement, the injury must be “ ‘an invasion of a legally
protected interest which is (a) concrete and particularized, [citations]; and (b)
“actual or imminent, not ‘conjectural’ or ‘hypothetical,’ “ [citations].’ [Citation.]”
(Citations omitted.)
 
(Bower v. AT&T
Mobility, LLC (2011) 196 Cal. App. 4th 1545, 1553-54.)
 
            At
¶ 208 – 210, 214, the 2AC alleges:
 
208. The uninhabitable
conditions at the Property arise from Defendants’ failure to maintain and repair
the Property as required by numerous state and municipal health, safety, and housing
codes. Hence, the Owner-Manager Defendants’ conduct was unlawful because it violated
the health, safety, and housing codes as set forth herein, including but not limited
to Civil Code sections 1941-1941.1; Health and Safety Code section 17920.9; Civil
Code sections 1927, 1940.2(a)(3), 1940.2(a)(4); Civil Code sections 3479 et seq.;
Civil Code section 1714; Civil Code sections 789.3(a) and 789.3(b)(3); Civil Code
section 1942.5; Civil Code section 1940.2(a)(3); and LAMC section 45.33.
 
209. Further,
the Westmoreland Defendants refused to comply with LAHD’s Order to Pay Relocation
Benefits, and Jamie Kim, as counsel for and agent of the Westmoreland Defendants,
aided the Westmoreland Defendants in their attempt to avoid obligations imposed
by the Order and under LAMC sections 161.701.1, et seq. and 163.00, et seq. These
actions were unlawful business practices. 
 
210. Each Plaintiff
has suffered and/or continues to suffer irreparable harm due to Defendants’ continuing
violations of the aforementioned statutes. Each Plaintiff has been injured in fact
and has suffered a loss of money and/or property as a result of Defendants’ conduct,
including, but not limited to: loss of their housing; overpayment of rent due
to diminished value of the leasehold; payment of rent for an illegally rented dwelling;
and other damages in an amount to be determined at trial, but which amount is within
the jurisdictional requirements of this Court. Also, each Plaintiff suffered physical
harm, such as but not limited to bug bites and allergic symptoms or reactions, and
severe or extreme emotional distress, including fear of imminent homelessness.
 
. . .
 
214. Defendant
Westmoreland and Defendant Chang Lee violated statutes including Civil Code sections
1941-1941.1 and 3479 et seq. These violations caused each Plaintiff injury in fact
through a loss of property as set forth in paragraphs 98 to 105 herein, and in the
overpayment of rent for an illegal and uninhabitable dwelling.
 
            Plaintiffs
cannot recover damages under Bus. & Prof. Code, § 17200:
 
“‘The purpose of
the UCL [citation] “is to protect both consumers and competitors by promoting fair
competition in commercial markets for goods and services. [Citation.]”‘ (McKell v. Washington
Mutual, Inc. (2006) 142 Cal.App.4th 1457, 1470 [49 Cal. Rptr. 3d 227].) ‘A

1134, 1144 [131 Cal. Rptr. 2d 29, 63 P.3d 937].)” (Durell v. Sharp
Healthcare (2010) 183 Cal.App.4th 1350, 1359 [108 Cal. Rptr.
3d 682] (Durell).)
 
(Gray v. Dignity Health
(2021) 70 Cal.App.5th 225, 236.)
 
            Here, Plaintiff’s claim that the Westmoreland
Defendants illegally rented the dwellings and violated the enumerated statutes at
¶ 208, which caused Plaintiffs to pay rent that was more than the reasonable rental
value. This is sufficient to plead a claim for restitutionary disgorgement.
 
            The
demurrer to the tenth cause of action is OVERRULED. 
 
7.         Fourteenth
Cause of Action (Intentional Misrepresentation).
 
            Defendant
argues that actionable misrepresentations are not pled.
 
            “To establish
a claim for deceit based on intentional misrepresentation, the plaintiff must prove
seven essential elements: (1) the defendant represented to the plaintiff that an
important fact was true; (2) that representation was false; (3) the defendant knew
that the representation was false when the defendant made it, or the defendant made
the representation recklessly and without regard for its truth; (4) the defendant
intended that the plaintiff rely on the representation; (5) the plaintiff reasonably relied on the representation;
(6) the plaintiff was harmed; and (7) the plaintiff’s reliance on the defendant’s
representation was a substantial factor in causing that harm to the plaintiff. (Citations
omitted.)” (Manderville v. PCG&S Group, Inc. (2007) 146 Cal.App.4th 1486, 1498 [italics omitted].)
 
Fraud must be
pleaded with specificity rather than with “ ‘general and conclusory allegations.’
“ (Small v. Fritz Companies, Inc. (2003) 30 Cal.4th 167, 184 [132 Cal. Rptr. 2d
490, 65 P.3d 1255].)  The specificity requirement
means a plaintiff must allege facts showing how, when, where, to whom, and by what
means the representations were made, and, in the case of a corporate defendant,
the plaintiff must allege the names of the persons who made the representations,
their authority to speak on behalf of the corporation, to whom they spoke, what
they said or wrote, and when the representation was made. (Lazar v. Superior Court,
supra, 12 Cal.4th at p. 645.)
 
We enforce the
specificity requirement in consideration of its two purposes. The first purpose
is to give notice to the defendant with sufficiently definite charges that the defendant
can meet them. (Committee on Children’s Television, Inc. v. General Foods Corp.
(1983) 35 Cal.3d 197, 216 [197 Cal. Rptr. 783, 673 P.2d 660].) The second is to
permit a court to weed out meritless fraud claims on the basis of the pleadings;
thus, “the pleading should be sufficient ‘ “to enable the court to determine whether,
on the facts pleaded, there is any foundation, prima facie at least, for the charge
of fraud.” ‘ “ (Id. at pp. 216–217.)
 
(West v.
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (2013) 214 Cal.App.4th 780, 793.)
 
            Here, Plaintiffs
allege as follows:
 
238. Since at least 2011 and continuing
until 2023, the Owner-Manager Defendants placed advertisements in a local Korean
American newspaper called Kyocharo, stating that the units in the Property were
available for lease for approximately $500-$700 a month. Those advertisements misrepresented
that the Property is a legitimate “boarding house.” Induced by the fraudulent advertisements,
each Plaintiff paid rent for the illegally converted units at the Property for years.  
 
239. The Owner-Manager Defendants and their
agents knew that their misrepresentations were false at the time they were made.
The Owner-Manager Defendants intended to induce Plaintiffs’ reliance on the misrepresentations
in furtherance of the Owner-Manager Defendants’ scheme to collect illegal rents
on a property converted into a multi-unit residence without proper permits. The
Owner-Manager 
Defendants knew that they would not be able
to collect illegal rents on the Property if they told Plaintiffs that their rental
agreements violated the law.
 
240. In December 2022 the Westmoreland Defendants
and Jamie Kim intentionally misrepresented to Plaintiffs that Plaintiffs had been
ordered by a court (not LAHD, LADBS, or any other government agency) to vacate the
Property. The Westmoreland Defendants and Jamie Kim made this statement in an attempt
to intimidate Plaintiffs into leaving their homes at the Property, thereby allowing
the Westmoreland Defendants to circumvent using the legal unlawful detainer process
to attempt to evict Plaintiffs. By this action, the Westmoreland Defendants and
Jamie Kim intended to cause Plaintiffs to leave the Property. 
 
241. In December 2022, Defendant Jeanie
Lee intentionally misrepresented to Plaintiffs that they should continue to pay
rent to her because she intended to defend herself and Plaintiffs in the unlawful
detainer action. On information and belief, Defendant Jeanie Lee had no intent to
defend Plaintiffs’ tenancy rights.
 
(2AC, ¶¶ 238 – 241.)
            This is a broad
allegation spanning 12 years. There must be more specific allegations as to each
Plaintiffs’ actual reliance on the advertisements.
Plaintiff’s claims fail for an additional reason: she has not shown that
she actually relied on the alleged misrepresentations, which is an essential element
of both claims of deceit. (Citation omitted.) “Actual reliance occurs when a misrepresentation
is ‘“an immediate cause of [a plaintiff’s] conduct, which alters his legal relations,”‘
and when, absent such representation, ‘“he would not, in all reasonable probability,
have entered into the contract or other transaction.”‘ [Citations.] ‘It is not …
necessary that [a plaintiff’s] reliance upon the truth of the fraudulent misrepresentation
be the sole or even the predominant or decisive factor in influencing his conduct.
… It is enough that the representation has played a substantial part, and so has
been a substantial factor, in influencing his decision.’” (Citation omitted.)
(Conroy v. Regents
of University of California (2009)  45
Cal.4th 1244, 1256.)
            The allegation
at ¶ 240 that the Westmoreland Defendants and Defendant Jamie Kim intentionally
misrepresented to Plaintiffs that Plaintiffs had been ordered by a court to vacate
the property to intimidate Plaintiffs into leaving their homes does not pled out-of-pocket
loss in reliance upon such representation.
[A] defrauded
party may recoup his out-of-pocket losses and expenditures in reliance on the fraud,
but he may not recover benefit-of-the-bargain damages (i.e., damages placing him
in the economic position he would have occupied had the representation been true),
at least where the recovery is not premised on a specific property actually acquired
by the defrauded party. 
 
(Kenly v. Ukegawa (1993) 16 Cal.App.4th 49, 54.)
 
      Likewise, the allegation that in
December 2022, Defendant Jeanie Lee intentionally misrepresented to Plaintiffs that
they should continue to pay rent to her because she intended to defend herself and
Plaintiffs in the unlawful detainer action is not pled with the requisite factual
specificity as to each Plaintiff.
 
            This cause of action is insufficiently
pled and Plaintiffs have exhausted their opportunities to amend.
 
            The
demurrer to the fourteenth cause of action is SUSTAINED without leave to
amend. 
 
8.         Fifteenth
Cause of Action (Negligent Misrepresentation).
 
The elements of negligent misrepresentation are ‘(1) the misrepresentation
of a past or existing material fact, (2) without reasonable ground for believing
it to be true, (3) with intent to induce another’s reliance on the fact misrepresented,
(4) justifiable reliance on the misrepresentation, and (5) resulting damage.’ (Citation
omitted.)” (National Union Fire Ins. Co. of Pittsburgh, PA v. Cambridge Integrated Services
Group, Inc. (2009) 171 Cal.App.4th
35, 50.)
 
            The
same pleading specificity requirement applicable to fraud applies to pleading negligent
misrepresentation. (Cadlo v. Owens-Illinois, Inc., (2004) 125 Cal.App.4th
513, 519.)

 
            This
cause of action suffers from the same pleading deficiencies as the fourteenth cause
of action for intentional misrepresentation. 
 
            Moreover,
there is no cause of action for a negligent false promise.
(Tarmann v. State Farm
Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. (1991) 2 Cal.App.4th 153, 159: “Simply put, making a promise with an honest but unreasonable intent to perform
is wholly different from making one with no intent to perform and, therefore, does
not constitute a false promise.”)
 
            The
demurrer to the fifteenth cause of action is SUSTAINED without leave to amend.

 
Defendants Kap Pong Kim and Chung Suk Kim, individually, and
as a trustee of the Kim Kap Pon and Chung Suk Kim Trust’s Demurrer
Meet and Confer
The Declaration of Steven Y. Han reflects that Defendant’s
counsel satisfied the meet and confer requirement set forth in Civ. Proc. Code,
§ 430.41.
Discussion
Defendants
Kap Pong Kim and Chung Suk Kim, individually, and as a trustee of the Kim Kap Pon
and Chung Suk Kim Trust demur to the Second Amended Complaint as follows:
1.         Second Cause of Action
(Breach of Implied Warranty of Habitability).
            The Kim Defendants argue
that the 2AC still fails to allege when Plaintiff provided actual notice to the
Kim Defendants.
The 2AC identifies Defendants Kap Pong Kim and Chung Suk Kim as the Owner-Manager
Defendants. (2AC, Page 2, footnote 2.) The 2AC alleges at ¶¶ 20, 21 that the Kim
Defendants had an ownership interest in the property from July 2002 through June
2022. ¶ 22 alleges that Defendant Jeanie Lee was a master tenant of and on0site
manager of the property until February 9, 2023. The 2AC alleges on information and
belief that Lee was the actual and/or ostensible agent of the Kim Defendants. “An allegation of material
facts upon information or belief is a sufficient allegation.” (Buxton v. International Indem. Co. (1920) 47 Cal.App. 583, 591.) 
            “An agent
represents his principal for all purposes within the scope of his actual or ostensible
authority, and all the rights and liabilities which would accrue to the agent from
transactions within such limit, if they had been entered into on his own account,
accrue to the principal.”  Civil Code § 2330.
“Ostensible authority is such as a principal, intentionally or by want of ordinary
care, causes or allows a third person to believe the agent to possess.”  Civil Code § 2317.  “A principal is bound by acts of his agent, under
a merely ostensible authority, to those persons only who have in good faith, and
without want of ordinary care, incurred a liability or parted with value, upon the
faith thereof.”  Civil Code § 2334.

            If the Kim Defendants were allowing Lee
to carry herself out as the property manager and to collect rent on behalf of the
landlord, at the very least a jury could find that she was the ostensible agent
of the Kim Defendants. Here, ¶¶ 51 – 58, 60 of the 2AC specify the general time
frames in which Plaintiffs informed Lee as agent of the Kim Defendants about various
defects at the property, and Defendants’ failure to address the problems.
The Court incorporates by reference its discussion and ruling re: the Westmoreland
demurrer as to this cause of action. For the reasons
set forth therein, the Court finds that this cause of action is sufficiently pled.
The demurrer
to the second cause of action is OVERRULED.
2          Third Cause of Action
(Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment).
            Defendants argue that Plaintiffs
allege that they entered into leases with Jeannie Lee (the master tenant), not the
Kim Defendants. (2AC, ¶¶ 11 – 18, 22.) 
In the absence of language to the contrary, every lease contains
an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment, whereby the landlord impliedly covenants
that the tenant shall have quiet enjoyment and possession of the premises. (Citations omitted.) The covenant of quiet enjoyment “insulates the tenant against
any act or omission on the part of the landlord, or anyone claiming under him, which
interferes with a tenant’s right to use and enjoy the premises for the purposes
contemplated by the tenancy.  (Citations omitted)

The implied covenant of quiet enjoyment
is partially codified in Civil Code section 1927, enacted in 1872, which provides:
“An agreement to let [*589]  upon hire binds
the letter to secure to the hirer the quiet possession of the thing hired during
the term of the hiring, against all persons lawfully claiming the same.” The statutory
covenant “guarantees the tenant against rightful assertion of a paramount title.”
(Citation omitted.) Beyond the statutory covenant, the landlord is
bound to refrain from action which interrupts the tenant’s beneficial enjoyment.
(Ibid.)
(Andrews v. Mobile Aire Estates (2005) 125 Cal.App.4th 578, 588-89 [italics
in original].)
            The
Court incorporates by reference its discussion above re: the Westmoreland demurrer
as to why an alleged lease entered into with the master tenant, Lee, does not create
privity of estate between the sublessees and the landlord via the master lease,
absent express assumption by the sublessee of the master lease. (Johnson v. Couch (1961) 189 Cal.App.2d 687, 691; Vallely Invs. v. Bancamerica Commercial Corp. (2001) 88 Cal. App. 4th 816, 823.)
            As such because each Plaintiff failed
to allege a basis whereby these demurring Kim Defendants owed Plaintiffs a covenant
of quiet enjoyment by virtue of a lease between the parties, this cause of action
fails as against the Kim Defendants.
            The
demurrer to the third cause of action is SUSTAINED without leave to amend.
Plaintiffs have exhausted their amendment opportunities.
3.         Fifth Cause of Action
(Premises Liability).
            The Kim Defendants argue
that there are insufficient facts pled as against the Kim Defendants. 
As the Court
discussed in connection with the Westmoreland Defendants’ demurrer, a premises liability
theory is negligence based, and does not require privity of estate or contract,
but rather is a duty-based analysis. Here, at ¶¶ 97 – 105, the 2AC alleges
the injuries suffered by each Plaintiff to their persons and their personal property,
and the alleged dangerous condition which caused such injuries, for which the Kim
Defendants could be held liable as owners of the subject property. 
The Court
finds that this cause of action is sufficiently pled.
            The
demurrer to the fifth cause of action is OVERRULED.
4.         Sixth Cause of Action
(Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress).
            Defendants argue
that there are insufficient facts pled whereby the Kim Defendants acted with intent
to cause distress to Plaintiffs.
“The elements of the tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress
are: ‘ “(1) extreme and outrageous conduct by the defendant with the intention of
causing, or reckless disregard of the probability of causing, emotional distress;
(2) the plaintiff’s suffering severe or extreme emotional distress; and (3) actual
and proximate causation of the emotional distress by the defendant’s outrageous
conduct. …” Conduct to be outrageous must be so extreme as to exceed all bounds
of that usually tolerated in a civilized community.’ [Citation.]” (Citation omitted.)
“It is not enough that the conduct be intentional and outrageous. It must be conduct directed at the plaintiff,
or occur in the presence of a plaintiff of whom the defendant is aware.” (Ibid.)
(Catsouras v. Department of California Highway Patrol (2010) 181 Cal.App.4th
856, 874-75.) 
In Stoiber
v. Honeychuck (1980) 101 Cal.App.3d 903, 921 [162 Cal. Rptr. 194], the appellate
court concluded that the plaintiff tenant had stated a cause of action for intentional
infliction of emotional distress by alleging that she had suffered “ ‘extreme emotional
distress’ as a result of the [landlord’s and property manager’s] ‘knowing, intentional,
and willful’ failure to correct defective conditions of the premises.” The Stoiber
court observed that whether the failure to act was extreme and outrageous “under
the present allegations, presents a factual question—it cannot be said as a matter
of law that [plaintiff] has not stated a cause of action.” (Id., at p. 922.)


(Burnett v. Chimney Sweep (2004) 123 Cal.App.4th
1057, 1069.)
            Here, the sixth cause of
action alleges that the Owner-Manager Defendants intentionally failed to correct
defective conditions of the premises[2].
¶ 165 alleges that they were aware they had constructed 15 illegal units that were
not safe or habitable, and refused to maintain or repair the property, intending
to cause Plaintiffs extreme emotion distress. The Court finds that, because Plaintiffs
allege they entered into a lease directly with Defendant Lee, there is no factual
basis to infer that the Kim Defendants—who were not in contractual privity with
Plaintiffs—intended to cause Plaintiffs intentional distress by way of intentional
calculation.
Intentional
infliction of emotional
distress requires conduct which is especially calculated to cause and does cause the claimant mental distress
of a very serious nature. (Ibid.) Although
it was evident that defendants had caused plaintiffs untold distress, they had not
acted with the purpose of causing them emotional distress. (Ibid.) The misconduct had been directed primarily at the decedent minor
with plaintiffs looking on as helpless bystanders. ( Id., at pp. 172-173.) The fact that defendants’ conduct
had not been especially calculated to cause plaintiffs’ distress was fatal to their
claim.
 
(Coon v. Joseph (1987) 192 Cal.App.3d 1269, 1273.)
            The
demurrer to the sixth cause of action is SUSTAINED without leave to amend.  Plaintiffs have exhausted their amendment
opportunities.
5.         Eighth Cause of Action
(Retaliation—Violation of Civil Code § 1942.5).
            Defendants argue that the
2Ac does not factually allege retaliation by the Kim Defendants.
            The Court incorporates by
reference its discussion re: Civil Code, § 1942.5 and common law retaliatory eviction
as to the Westmoreland demurrer.
            Here, Plaintiffs allege at
¶¶ 51 – 57 alleges with more facts when each Plaintiff
notified the Defendants of each defect. ¶ 186 only alleges:
The Kim Defendants
retaliated against each Plaintiff by failing and refusing to repair the conditions
of the Property after each Plaintiff requested repairs through the Kim Defendants’
agents. Plaintiffs’ individual complaints are set forth in paragraphs 50 to 58 herein.
 
Here, the
language of Civil Code, § 1942.5 contemplates retaliation in the form of eviction,
as does the common law cause of action for retaliatory eviction. The mere failure
to repair the property, if it did not result in eviction of the tenant, does not
state a cause of action against the Kim Defendants. 
The demurrer to the eighth cause
of action is SUSTAINED without leave to amend. Plaintiffs have exhausted
their amendment opportunities. 
6.         Ninth Cause of Action
(Harassment).
            The Court incorporates by
reference its discussion of Civil Code, § 1940.2 as to the Westmoreland demurrer.
            As against the Kim Defendants,
¶ 202 alleges that
Each Plaintiff reasonably apprehended physical harm, such as bug bites and
allergic reactions or symptoms, when the Owner-Manager Defendants refused or failed
to correct the substandard conditions at the Property, including rampant pest infestations.
The alleged
apprehension of harm is clearly not the type contemplated by reasonable construction
of Civil Code, § 1940.2(a)(3). The type of harm contemplated is that of being assaulted
and/or battered due to the person engaged in the menacing conduct, not the attenuated
annoyance or inconvenience which Plaintiffs allege. The Court reads the statute
as requiring a direct connection between apprehension of harm attributed to the
use, or threat to use, force, willful threats, or menacing conduct by the landlord,
not from bugs and homelessness.
The demurrer
to the ninth cause of action is SUSTAINED without leave to amend. Plaintiffs
have exhausted their amendment opportunities.
7.         Tenth Cause of Action
(Violation of Unfair Competition Law—Bus. & Prof. Code, § 17200 et seq.)
            Defendants argue there are
insufficient facts pled to show a violation of statute and injury in the form of
rent received by the Kim Defendants.
            Here, Plaintiff’s claim that the Owner-Manager
Defendants illegally rented the dwellings and violated the enumerated statutes at
¶ 208, which caused Plaintiffs to pay rent that was more than the reasonable rental
value. This is sufficient to plead a claim for restitutionary disgorgement.
            The
demurrer to the tenth cause of action is OVERRULED.
8.         Eleventh Cause of Action
(Violation of Tenant Anti-Harassment Ordinance (Los Angeles Municipal Code, § 45.30,
et seq.)
            Defendants
argue that this cause of action does not allege a violation of the LAMC § 45.33(8). 
            The
2AC allege at ¶ 220 as follows:
220. The anti-harassment
provisions of LAMC section 45.33 prohibit a landlord from engaging in various acts
of harassment that serve no lawful purpose and cause tenant(s) detriment and harm.
These acts include, but are not limited to: 

 
. . .
 
d. Threatening
or engaging in acts that interfere with a tenant’s enjoyment and occupancy of the
tenant’s rental unit (45.33.8). 
 
The 2AC alleges as follows at ¶ 224 against the Kim Defendants:
 
224. The Kim Defendants violated LAMC section 45.33, subsection 8 by intentionally
concealing that the units they purported to rent to each Plaintiff were illegal
and unpermitted. Because the units were illegal and unpermitted, the City of Los
Angeles ordered Plaintiffs to leave their homes, which interfered with each Plaintiffs
enjoyment and occupancy of their rental unit.
 
This does not allege direct action of threat of engagement in
acts by the Kim Defendants which interfered with Plaintiffs’ enjoyment and occupancy
of the rental units. 
 
The demurrer to the eleventh cause of action
is SUSTAINED without leave to amend. Plaintiffs
have exhausted their amendment opportunities.
 
9.         Fourteenth Cause of Action
(Intentional Misrepresentation).
Defendants argue that this cause of action is not pled with the requisite
specificity for fraud. The Court incorporates by reference it discussion re: intentional
misrepresentation as to the Westmoreland demurrer.
            This cause of action is insufficiently pled as
against the Kim Defendants and Plaintiffs have exhausted their opportunities to
amend.
            The
demurrer to the fourteenth cause of action is SUSTAINED without leave to
amend.
10.       Fifteenth Cause of Action
(Negligent Misrepresentation).
Defendants argue that this cause of action is not pled with the requisite
specificity for fraud. The Court incorporates by reference it discussion re: negligent
misrepresentation as to the Westmoreland demurrer.
            This cause of action is insufficiently pled as
against the Kim Defendants and Plaintiffs have exhausted their opportunities to
amend.
            The
demurrer to the fifteenth cause of action is SUSTAINED without leave to amend.
Defendants Kap Pong Kim and Chung Suk Kim, individually, and
as a trustee of the Kim Kap Pon and Chung Suk Kim Trust’s Motion To Strike
 
Meet and Confer
 
The Declaration of Steven Y. Han reflects that Defendant’s
counsel satisfied the meet and confer requirement set forth in Civ. Proc. Code,
§ 435.5 .
 
Discussion
 
Defendants
Kap Pong Kim and Chung Suk Kim, individually, and as a trustee of the Kim Kap Pon
and Chung Suk Kim Trust move to strike the following portions of the Second Amended
Complaint:
 
1.
References to punitive or exemplary in ¶¶ 120, 140, 150, 159, 170, 197, 205, 245,
256, and 268 of the SAC; 
 
MOOT
as to ¶¶ 140, 170, 197, 205, 245, 246 by virtue of the ruling on the demurrer. 
 
GRANTED
without leave to amend as to ¶ 120. In connection with the negligence cause
of action, Plaintiffs have failed to plead facts to support malice, oppression or
fraud as against the Kim Defendants, for purposes of Civil Code, § 3294(c).
 
(1) ‘Malice’ means conduct
which is intended by the defendant to cause injury to the plaintiff or despicable
conduct which is carried on by the defendant with a willful and conscious disregard
of the rights or safety of others.
(2) ‘Oppression’ means despicable conduct that subjects a person
to cruel and unjust hardship in conscious disregard of that person’s rights.
(3) ‘Fraud’ means an intentional misrepresentation, deceit, or
concealment of a material fact known to the defendant with the intention on the
part of the defendant of thereby depriving a person of property or legal rights
or otherwise causing injury.
     (Civ. Code, § 3294(c).)
 
            To withstand
a motion to strike punitive damages allegations, the complaint must set forth facts
supporting a claim for punitive damages:
 
The mere allegation an intentional tort
was committed is not sufficient to warrant an award of punitive damages.  (Citation omitted.)  Not only must there be circumstances of oppression,
fraud or malice, but facts must be alleged in the pleading to support such
a claim.  
 
     (Grieves
v. Superior Court (Fox) (1984) 157 Cal.App.3d 159, 166 [emphasis added].)
 
(See also Clauson v. Superior Court (Pedus Services, Inc.) (1998) 67
Cal.App.4th 1253, 1255 [“[T]o survive a motion to strike an allegation
of punitive damages, the ultimate facts showing an entitlement to such relief must
be pled by a plaintiff.”])
 
            GRANTED without leave to amend
to ¶ 150. In connection with the nuisance cause of action, Plaintiffs have failed
to allege malice, oppression or fraud. 
 
            GRANTED without leave to amend
to ¶ 159. In connection with the premises liability cause of action, which is based
on negligence, Plaintiffs have failed to allege malice, oppression or fraud. 
 
            DENIED as to ¶ 268. The cause of action
for fraudulent concealment remains viable, and is based on concealment of the illegality
of the boarding house, which constitutes fraud as that term is defined in Civil
Code, § 3294(c)(3) to include “an intentional . . . concealment of a material
fact known to the defendant with the intention on the part of the defendant of thereby
depriving a person of property or legal rights or otherwise causing injury.” 
 
2.
Prayers for relief for punitive or exemplary damages as to the First, Third, Fourth,
Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, Ninth, Fourteenth, Fifteenth and Sixteenth Causes of Action;
 
MOOT
as to the third, sixth, eighth, ninth, fourteenth and fifteenth causes of action
based on the ruling on the demurrer.
 
GRANTED
without leave to amend as to the first and fifth causes of action. These
are negligence-based claims which do not support a claim for punitive damages.
 
DENIED
as to the sixteenth cause of action. The cause of action for fraudulent concealment
remains viable, and is based on concealment of the illegality of the boarding house,
which constitutes fraud as that term is defined in Civil Code, § 3294(c)(3) to include
“an intentional . . . concealment of a material fact known to the defendant
with the intention on the part of the defendant of thereby depriving a person of
property or legal rights or otherwise causing injury.”
 
3.
As to all causes of action – Treble Damages pursuant to Civ. Code § 3345.
 
DENIED.
Civil Code § 3345 pertains to acts against senior citizens, disabled persons or
veterans. Defendants did not present an argument as to why this sho9uld be stricken.
