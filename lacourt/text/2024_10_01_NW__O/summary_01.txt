And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Aykem LLC's motion to expunge the lis pendens recorded by Mikhail Siretskiy on May 31, 2024. Aykem LLC had previously recorded a notice of lis pendens on September 26, 2023, but it was expunged on April 26, 2024. Mikhail Siretskiy recorded another notice of lis pendens on May 31, 2024, without requesting leave of court, and the judge has ordered that this notice be expunged as well.

The judge has also awarded Aykem LLC $121,440 in attorney's fees and $5,158.11 in costs for its motion for attorney's fees. This award is against Mikhail Siretskiy only, as the other defendants are not signatories to the contract from which the fees arise.

The judge has ordered Aykem LLC to prepare and submit an Amended Judgment that reflects the additional fees and costs.
