ORDER
  GRANTING AYKEM LLC’S MOTION TO EXPUNGE LIS PENDENS
 
ORDER
  GRANTING IN PART AYKEM LLC’S MOTION FOR ATTORNEY’S FEES 



 


 
I.              
BACKGROUND 
This is an
action between Plaintiffs Mikhail Siretskiy (“Mikhail”) and Marina Siretskiy
(“Marina”) (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) and Defendants Aykem LLC (“Aykem”),
Mariya Ayzenberg (“Mariya”), Mike Kemel (“Mike”), Alex Kemel (“Alex”), Vadim
Bogdanov, and Vadim Gurman. 
On April 26, 2024, this Court granted
Aykem’s Motion to Expunge Lis Pendens against the property located at 5325
Cangas Drive, Agoura Hills, California 91301 (“Property”). On May 31, 2024, Mikhail
recorded another notice of lis pendens against the Property. On June 28, 2024, this Court dismissed Aykem,
Mariya, and Alex from this action with prejudice. 
Aykem now
seeks to expunge Mikhail’s second recorded lis pendens. Aykem, Mariya, and Alex also seek
attorney’s fees pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure § 1717(a).[1]
Plaintiffs have not filed an opposition to either.
II.           
PROCEDURAL
HISTORY
On September 21, 2023, Plaintiffs filed
their Complaint, alleging (1) Breach of Contract; (2) Fraud, Deceit,
Misrepresentation; (3) Negligent Misrepresentation; (4) Violation of Fin. Code
22000 et seq.; (5) Quiet Title; (6) Assault; (7) Battery; (8) Intentional
Infliction of Emotional Distress/Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress; (9)
Conversion; (10) Trespass to Land; and (11) Steering to Hard Money Loan (Self-Dealing).
          On February 20, 2024, this Court
sustained Aykem, Mariya, Mike, and Alex’s Demurrer to Plaintiffs’ Complaint. 
          On April 22, 2024, this Court granted Aykem,
Mariya, Mike, and Alex’s Ex Parte Application for Order Dismissing the Action
with Prejudice. 
          
          On April 23, 2024, Mike filed his
Answer. 
          On April 23, 2024, this Court denied
Mikhail’s Ex Parte Application for Leave to File a First Amended Complaint. 
On April 26, 2024, this Court granted
Aykem’s Motion to Expunge Lis Pendens.
          On May 30, 2024, this Court granted Plaintiffs’
Motion for Leave to File a First Amended Complaint. 
          On May 30, 2024, Plaintiffs filed
their First Amended Complaint (“FAC”), alleging (1) Steering to Hard Money Loan
(Self-Dealing); (2) Breach of Fiduciary Duty; (3) Breach of Implied Covenant of
Good Faith and Fair Dealing; (4) Wrongful Eviction; (5) Wrongful Foreclosure; (6)
Rescission/Specific Performance; (7) Assault; (8) Battery; and (9) Intentional

          On June 4, 2024, this Court denied
Aykem, Mariya, Mike, and Alex’s Ex Parte Application for Order Revoking or
Setting Aside Prior Order on a Renewed Motion for Leave to File a First Amended
Complaint.
          On June 28, 2024, after having held an
OSC Re: Striking the First Amended Complaint pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure 1008(c) and taking the issue under submission, this Court dismissed Aykem,
Mariya, Mike, and Alex with prejudice pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure §
581(f)(2). 
          On July 12, 2024, this Court set aside
its inadvertent dismissal of Mike and denied Mikhail’s Ex Parte Application for
Relief from Dismissal under Code of Civil Procedure 473(b).
          On August 26, 2024, Aykem filed the
instant Motion to Expunge Lis Pendens (“Motion to Expunge”). 
          On August 26, 2024, Aykem, Mariya, and
Alex filed the instant Motion for Attorney’s Fees (“Fees Motion”). 
          Plaintiffs did not file an opposition
to either the Motion to Expunge or the Fees Motion. 
III.        
LEGAL STANDARD
A.            
Expunge Lis Pendens
“[A] lis
pendens is a recorded document giving constructive notice that an action has
been filed affecting title or right to possession of the real property
described in the notice. Its effect is that anyone acquiring an interest in the
property after the action was filed will be bound by the judgment…Once a lis
pendens is filed, it clouds the title and effectively prevents the property's
transfer until the litigation is resolved or the lis pendens is expunged.” (BGJ
Associates, LLC v. Superior Court (1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 952, 967.) 
“At any
time after notice of pendency of action has been recorded, any party, or any
nonparty with an interest in the real property affected thereby, may apply to
the court in which the action is pending to expunge the notice…Evidence or
declarations may be filed with the motion to expunge the notice. The court may
permit evidence to be received in the form of oral testimony, and may make any
orders it deems just to provide for discovery by any party affected by a motion
to expunge the notice. The claimant shall have the burden of proof under
Sections 405.31 and 405.32.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 405.30.) 
The
court shall order the expungement if it finds the pleading on which the lis
pendens was based “does not contain a real property claim,” or if it finds the
party who filed the pleading “has not established by a preponderance of the
evidence the probable validity of the real property claim.” (Code Civ. Proc. §§
405.31 & 405.32.) “The party opposing a motion to expunge a lis pendens has
the burden to show that a real property claim has been alleged and has probable
validity based upon a preponderance of the evidence.” (Nunn v. JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A. (2021) 64 Cal.App.5th 346, 363.)
///
B.            
Attorney’s Fees
“A party
is entitled to an award of¿attorney¿fees¿if there
is a specific authorization therefor by statute or private agreement.” (Beverly Hills Properties v.
Marcolino (1990) 221 Cal.App.3d Supp. 7, 10.)  
 “With respect to attorney fees
incurred to litigate a contract claim, the recovery of such fees are governed
by¿Section 1717.”
(Intelligent Investments Corp. v. Gonzales (2016) 1 Cal.App.5th Supp. 1,
4.) Code of Civil Procedure § 1717(a)
provides in, pertinent part, “[i]n any action on a contract, where the contract
specifically provides that¿attorney's¿fees¿and costs, which are incurred to
enforce that contract, shall be awarded either to one of the parties or to the¿prevailing¿party, then the party who is determined
to be the¿party¿prevailing¿on the contract, whether he or she is
the party specified in the contract or not, shall be entitled to reasonable¿attorney's¿fees¿in addition to other costs.”
“California
courts liberally construe the term ‘on a contract’
as used within¿section
1717. As long as the action involves a contract it is ‘on
the contract’
within the meaning of¿Section
1717.”
(Dell Merk Inc. v. Franzia (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 443, 455, (internal
citations omitted).) 
“The court…shall determine who is the
party prevailing on the contract for purposes of this section, whether or not
the suit proceeds to final judgment…the party prevailing on the contract shall
be the party who recovered a greater relief in the action on the contract. The
court may also determine that there is no party prevailing on the contract for
purposes of this section.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 1717(b).)
Code of Civil Procedure § 1032(b)
provides that, “[e]xcept as otherwise expressly provided by statute, a
prevailing party is entitled … to recover costs in any action or proceeding.”
Attorneys’ fees awarded pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 1717 are
allowable as costs under Code of Civil Procedure § 1032 as they are attorneys’
fees authorized by contract. (See Code Civ. Proc. § 1033.5(c)(5)(B); Code
Civ. Proc. § 1033.5(a)(10)(A).) Attorneys’ fees are therefore recoverable as an
element of costs.
IV.         
ANALYSIS
A.            
Motion to Expunge Lis Pendens 
1.              
Request for Judicial Notice 
The Court GRANTS Aykem’s
Request for Judicial Notice (“RJN”) Exs. O-P, the “Notice of Pending Action
(Lis Pendens) recorded on September 26, 2023” and the Notice of Pending Action
(Lis Pendens) recorded on May 31, 2024.” 
The Court denies Aykem’s
other RJNs.
2.              
Motion to Expunge Lis Pendens  
“Once a notice of
pending action has been expunged, the claimant may not record another notice of
pending action as to the affected property without leave of the court in which
the action is pending.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 405.36.) If a claimant re-records a
notice of pending action without leave of court, the notice must be expunged. (See
De Martini v. Superior Court (2024) 98 Cal.App.5th 1269, 1275–1278.)
On April 26, 2024, the
Court granted Aykem’s Motion to
Expunge Lis Pendens (“Order”), thereby expunging the lis pendens Mikhail had
recorded against the Property on September 26, 2023. In its Order, the Court
specifically stated “…pursuant to CCP § 405.36, Plaintiffs…shall not record
another Notice of Pendency of Action (Lis Pendens) against the Property without
affirmative leave of Court.” (Order, pg. 2.) Despite this, Mikhail recorded
another notice of pending action against the Property on May 31, 2024. (See RJN
Ex. P.) Mikhail did not request leave of Court to record another notice of
pending action against the Property. As such, Mikhail’s May 31, 2024, notice
must be expunged and the Court GRANTS Aykem’s Motion to Expunge. 
Aykem requests attorney’s fees in
conjunction with its Motion to Expunge. (See Motion to Expunge, pp.
11-12.) Parties prevailing on
motions to expunge a lis pendens are entitled to recover reasonable attorney
fees associated with making or opposing the motion, unless courts find the
other parties acted with substantial justification, or other circumstances of
injustice. (See Code Civ. Proc. § 405.38; Castro v. Superior Court (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 1010, 1018.) The
fee award goes only against the losing party and not counsel. (See Doyle v. Superior Court (1991) 226
Cal.App.3d 1355, 1359.)
Aykem requests attorney’s
fees and costs in the amount of $7,588.91, which accounts for “5 hours and 24
minutes meeting and conferring, speaking with clients, researching the law, and
drafting the moving papers and declarations in support thereof. Further, I
estimate spending an additional two (2) hours reviewing, researching, and
replying to the Opposition, if any, and two (2) hours preparing and attending
the hearing in this matter for a total of 9 hours and 24 minutes (9.4) hours at
my regular rate of $800.00,” plus $68.91 in court costs. (Motion to Expunge
Declaration of Gina Lisitsa filed August 26, 2024, ¶ 49.) 
As the Court has previously noted, given
Aykem’s counsel, Gina Lisitsa’s (“Lisitsa”), experience, the prevailing rates
within the Greater Los Angeles Area, the level of complexity of the issues, and
the skill required, the Court finds counsel her requested rate of $800/hour to
be reasonable. However, the Court finds Aykem’s requested 9 hours and 24
minutes unreasonable, considering Lisitsa’s previous experience with this exact
same motion in this case and the lack of opposition. The Court thus finds it
appropriate to reduce Lisitsa’s fee award to $1,668.91, which accounts for (2)
hours to draft the Motion to Expunge, (1) hour to attend the hearing, and
$68.91 in court costs. Having addressed the fees Aykem incurred in connection
with its Motion to Expunge here, the Court will exclude them from its analysis
of Aykem’s concurrently pending Fees Motion below.
          Based on the
foregoing, the Court GRANTS Aykem’s Motion to Expunge and awards Aykem $1,668.91 in attorney’s fees and court
costs. 
          In connection with its Motion to
Expunge, Aykem shall serve and file a proposed order that is suitable for recording. (See
Code Civ. Proc. § 405.60.) 
          Plaintiffs shall pay Aykem $1,668.91
in attorney’s fees and court costs on or before October 31, 2024, with interest
accruing at the legal rate thereafter.
B.            
Motion for Attorney’s Fees
1.              
Aykem is Entitled to an Award of Reasonable Attorney’s Fees and
Costs Under Code of Civil Procedure § 1717(a).
Aykem, Mariya, and Alex
request a total of $176,560.00 in attorney’s fees and costs incurred in
connection with this action and instant Motion. 
As an initial matter,
the Court finds Aykem, Mariya, and Alex are the prevailing parties for the
purposes of their Motion. The Court also finds attorney’s fees are authorized pursuant
to Paragraph 23 of the Deed of Trust (the “Deed”), which is broad, as well as
Paragraph the Promissory Note dated May 26, 2021, and signed by Mikhail on
behalf of Cangas RE LLC as its Managing Member on June 14, 2021 (the “Note”). (See
Declaration of Gina Lisitsa dated August 26, 2024, ¶¶ 3-4, Exs. B & C.)
That is because although the Note’s Attorney’s Fees provision in Paragraph 9 is
limited to where suits are brought by Aykem “to compel payment of [the] Note or
any portion of the indebtedness… or to defend the priority of the Deed,” it
also incorporates the Deed’s broad fee provision by reference. 
The Court does not find,
however, that Alex or Mariya are entitled to fees as they are not signatories
to the contract from which the fees arise. The Court also finds Mikhail is the
only Plaintiff from which Aykem is entitled to receive attorney’s fees, as
Mikhail is the only Plaintiff that is a signatory to the contract from which
the fees arise. “A party is entitled to recover its attorney's fees pursuant to
a contractual provision only when the party would have been liable for the fees
of the opposing party if the opposing party had prevailed. Where a nonsignatory
plaintiff sues a signatory defendant in an action on a contract and the
signatory defendant prevails, the signatory defendant is entitled to attorney’s
fees only if the nonsignatory plaintiff would have been entitled to its fees if
the plaintiff had prevailed.” (Real Property Services Corporation v. The
City of Pasedena (1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 375, 382.) Here, as a nonsignatory, Marina
would not be responsible for the attorney’s fees of any of the defendants had
the Plaintiffs prevailed; likewise, Alex, and Mariya would not be responsible
for the Plaintiffs’ fees had the Plaintiffs prevailed. 
Accordingly, Aykem is entitled
to an award of reasonable attorney’s fees and costs under Code of Civil
Procedure § 1717(a) as the prevailing party in this action as against Mikhail
only. 
2.       Aykem’s Fees Are Granted in Part.
a.       Lisitsa’s Rates are Reasonable.
As the Court has previously addressed above, the
Court finds Lisitsa’s $800.00/hr billing rate reasonable.
b.       Not
All Lisitsa’s Hours Are Reasonable.
Lisitsa declares she will have spent a total of
225.70 hours on this matter after the hearing on the Motion. (See Motion
Declaration of Gina Lisitsa filed August 26, 2024 (“Lisitsa Decl.”), ¶ 18.) Lisitsa
declares generated $176,560.00 in fees for her services, plus $5,453.19 in
costs; Lisitsa requests this Court award $176,560.00 in attorney’s fees for
220.7 hours of work. (See Lisitsa Decl., ¶ 21, Ex. C.) 
First, the Court has already addressed fees and
costs Aykem incurred in connection with both of its Motions to Expunge Lis
Pendens. In its April 22, 2024, Minute Order addressing Aykem’s first Motion to
Expunge Lis Pendens, the Court accounted for 32 hours of Aykem’s counsel’s time
and $68.91 in costs. Then, earlier in this Order, the Court addressed the 9.4
hours and an additional $68.91 in costs Aykem sought for bringing the Motion to
Expunge. By including the time for both of those motions in their Fee Motion,
Aykem is impermissibly seeking double recovery of that time.
Next, the Court identified one entry on April 23,
2024, for researching and drafting an answer for 2.2 hours that should not be
included here because it relates to a party who has not yet prevailed and even
then, arguably is not entitled to fees because he is not a party to either the
Grant Deed or Note.
Third, Aykem seeks 12 hours in connection with time
anticipated to be spent on reviewing Mikhail’s opposition to the Fee Motion,
drafting a reply, and appearing at the hearing. Since no opposition has been
filed and the Court anticipates handling the matter quickly at the time of
hearing, the Court is reducing that time to 1.0 hour.
Finally, the Court has reviewed Aykem’s counsel’s
invoice attached as Exhibit C to the Lisitsa Decl. and finds that some time is
not reasonable because an attorney with such high skill as to warrant $800/hour
should take less time than requested. Other time is more appropriately
delegated to clerical workers, not licensed attorneys. For ease of use, the
Court has broken those two categories down accordingly:

Based on the foregoing analysis, the Court reduces
Ms. Lisitsa’s reasonable hours by 68.9 hours to 151.8 total hours, amounting to
$121,440 in reasonable attorney’s fees. 
c.       Aykem is Entitled to Costs.
Aykem seeks reimbursement of $5,453.19 in costs. On
July 12, 2024, Aykem filed a Memorandum of Costs as required by Rules of Court,
rule 3.1700, seeking $4,741.80 in costs. These requested costs do not match the
$5,453.19 listed in Lisitsa’s invoice. (See Lisitsa Decl., Ex. C)
However, the greater level of detail in Lisitsa’s invoice enables the Court to
conclude Aykem has met its burden of proof as to some of its costs listed
therein. The only costs the Court is excluding are those related to the Motions
to Expunge Lis Pendens which the Court already accounted for in its April 22,
2024, Minute Order and above ($68.91 x 2), the filing fee for the Answer filed
on April 23, 2024 ($7.26), and the Jury Fees because the case is still pending
as to Mike ($150.00). This reduces Aykem’s cost award to $5,158.11.
V.       CONCLUSION
          Based on
the foregoing, the Court GRANTS Aykem’s Motion to Expunge Lis Pendens and awards Aykem $1,668.91 in attorney’s fees and court
costs in connection with it. Aykem shall serve and file a proposed order suitable for recording. (See
Code Civ. Proc. § 405.60.) 
          Plaintiffs shall pay Aykem $1,668.91
in attorney’s fees and court costs on or before October 31, 2024.   
The
Court also GRANTS Aykem’s Motion for Attorney’s Fees in the amount of $121,440 and costs of $5,158.11 as against
Mikhail only.
Accordingly,
the Court orders Aykem to prepare and submit an Amended Judgment that reflects
these additional fees and costs. 
IT IS SO
ORDERED.
DATED:      October 1, 2024
