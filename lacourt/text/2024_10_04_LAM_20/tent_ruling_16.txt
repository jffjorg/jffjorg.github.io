 On June 20, 2024, Plaintiff Loomis Armored US, LLC (“Loomis”) filed the operative First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) against Defendant Rafael Castillo for (1) violation of Pen. Code § 496, (2) breach of fiduciary duty, and (3) conversion.  Plaintiff alleges that it has a cash delivery service and that its employee, Castillo, stole $36,000. On June 13, 2024, the Court consolidated this matter with Rafael Castillo v. Loomis Armored US, LLC, et al., Case No. 23STCV04436. Therein, Castillo brings claims for discrimination, harassment, failure to prevent misconduct, wrongful discharge, and defamation against Loomis and also five of its employees, Jessie Hernandez, Nolan Tate, Ryan Shake, Urias Jimenez, and John Toliano.   Castillo alleges that he had been an excellent employee for years, but when Shake was hired, he orchestrated a scheme in which he hired two younger employees, had Castillo completely train them, and then fired Castillo through a false assertion that he stole $36,000.  Castillo alleges that the LAPD and District Attorney found no probable cause for an arrest and that he has not been charged for any crime.   Castillo now demurs to the second and third causes of action in the FAC for uncertainty and failure to state sufficient facts.  When considering demurrers, courts read the allegations liberally and in context, and “treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded, but not contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law.” (Serrano v. Priest (1971) 5 Cal.3d 584, 591.)  “A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters. Therefore, it lies only where the defects appear on the face of the pleading or are judicially noticed. The only issue involved in a demurrer hearing is whether the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous matters, states a cause of action.”  (Hahn v. Mirda¿(2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.)  It is error “to sustain a demurrer without leave to amend if the plaintiff shows there is a reasonable possibility any defect identified by the defendant can be cured by amendment.”  (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital Dist.¿(1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 967.)Pen. Code § 496(c) allows for treble damages when there is a violation of subsection (a), which provides in relevant part, “Every person who buys or receives any property that has been stolen or that has been obtained in any manner constituting theft or extortion, knowing the property to be so stolen or obtained, or who conceals, sells, withholds, or aids in concealing, selling, or withholding any property from the owner, knowing the property to be so stolen or obtained, shall be punished by imprisonment in a county jail for not more than one year, or imprisonment pursuant to subdivision (h) of Section 1170.”Defendant argues that he cannot be liable under Penal Code § 496(a), (c) because it is alleged that he directly stole the property rather than receiving the stolen property.  This lacks merit because “A principal in the actual theft of the property may be convicted pursuant to this section.”  (Pen. Code § 496(a); see also Siry Inv., L.P. v. Farkhondehpour (2022) 13 Cal.5th 333, 354.)  Defendant then points to the next sentence: “no person may be convicted both pursuant to this section and of the theft of the same property.”  This, however, would not seem to bar Plaintiff’s claim because Defendant has never been convicted of theft.  Next, “[t]he elements of a cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty are: (1) the existence of a fiduciary duty; (2) the breach of that duty; and (3) damage proximately caused by that breach. [Citation.]” (Mosier v. Southern Cal. Physicians Ins. Exchange (1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 1022, 1044.)“A fiduciary or confidential relationship can arise when confidence is reposed by persons in the integrity of others, and if the latter voluntarily accept or assume to accept the confidence, they cannot act so as to take advantage of the others' interests without their knowledge or consent.”  (Tri-Growth Ctr. City, Ltd. v. Silldorf, Burdman, Duignan & Eisenberg (1989) 216 Cal.App.3d 1139, 1150.) “Employees who are not officers or directors are generally not considered to be fiduciaries and thus owe no fiduciary duty to their employers: ‘There is no confidential or fiduciary relationship in this [employment contract] context.’ [See Calvao v. Sup.Ct. (Klippert) (1988) 201 CA3d 921, 923, 247 CR 470, 471]”.  (Cal. Prac. Guide Employment Litigation Ch. 14-B.)The FAC states, “[s]ince approximately 2020, in his role as Operations Supervisor, Defendant performed maintenance and other general upkeep of the SafePoint safes. During this time, Defendant was not involved in the transportation or delivery of U.S. currency to customer locations to or from the Montebello facility, nor did he work with ATMs, or provide any services to ATMs. Defendant had no reason to enter Loomis’s vault, or to handle any cash or currency in his position with Loomis, including in his role servicing SafePoint safes.”Plaintiff has failed to plead or establish a fiduciary duty between an “operations supervisor” and his employer.  On the other hand, the FAC does mention, for the same claim, that the duty of loyalty was breached.  “The elements of a cause of action for breach of a duty of loyalty, by analogy to a claim for breach of fiduciary duty, are as follows: (1) the existence of a relationship giving rise to a duty of loyalty; (2) one or more breaches of that duty; and (3) damage proximately caused by that breach.”  (Huong Que, Inc. v. Luu (2007) 150 Cal.App.4th 400, 410.)“[A]n employer has the right to expect the undivided loyalty of its employees. The duty of loyalty is breached, and may give rise to a cause of action in the employer, when the employee takes action which is inimical to the best interests of the employer.”  (Stokes v. Dole Nut Co. (1995) 41 Cal.App.4th 285, 295.)Notably, “California law recognizes a claim for breach of an employee's duty of loyalty while still employed” and this does not require the existence of an underlying fiduciary duty. (Cardinal v. Lupo (N.D. Cal. Sept. 17, 2019) 2019 WL 4450859 at *11.)  The FAC does state a breach of the duty of loyalty as it is alleged that Defendant converted $36,000.In sum, the Demurrer is overruled.  An answer is to be filed within 20 days.Moving parties to give notice.If counsel do not submit on the tentative, they are strongly encouraged to appear by LACourtConnect rather than in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
