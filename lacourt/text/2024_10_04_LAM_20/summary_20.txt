And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling states that the Defendants, Marc S. Feldman, Boshra G. Khoder, and Brett G. Hampton, who failed to pay the Plaintiff, Latoya S. Redd, $35,489.51 in attorneys' fee lien with settlement funds from case YC072873, have filed a motion to set aside their defaults. The Court has reviewed the information presented and has determined that the Defendants have shown excusable neglect, including miscalculating the extended date to respond to the Complaint and filing an answer six days after being warned of a default. The Court has also found that the Defendants did not learn of the defaults until after receiving the Plaintiff's motion to strike and have acted with diligence in seeking relief. Therefore, the Court grants the motion and resurrects the answer, overruling the objections.
