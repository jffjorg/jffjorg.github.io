And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion to compel Adelanto Warehousing, LLC and SSZS Holdings, LLC to comply with deposition subpoenas. The plaintiff, Babak Zarabian, had sought to discover information about the connection between these entities, other dismissed entities, and Dan and Saeed. The judge found that the plaintiff had failed to establish a legitimate reason for the discovery and that it seemed like a "fishing expedition" at this point in the case. The judge also denied sanctions and dismissed the motion to compel.
