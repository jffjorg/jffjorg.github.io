And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled on the demurrer filed by the defendant, Rafael Castillo, against the plaintiff, Loomis Armored US, LLC. Castillo had argued that the plaintiff's claims for violation of Pen. Code § 496, breach of fiduciary duty, and conversion should be dismissed because the allegations do not state a cause of action. However, the judge has determined that the demurrer should be overruled. The judge found that the plaintiff has stated a claim for conversion, which alleges that Castillo stole $36,000. The judge also found that the plaintiff has stated a claim for breach of duty of loyalty, which alleges that Castillo converted the money. The judge denied Castillo's demurrer and ordered him to file an answer to the complaint within 20 days.
