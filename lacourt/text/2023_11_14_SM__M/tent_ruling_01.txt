Legal
Standard
 
If parties to pending litigation
stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties outside of the presence of the
court or orally before the court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof,
the court, upon motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the
settlement. If requested by the parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over
the parties to enforce the settlement until performance in full of the terms of
the settlement.
 
(CCP, § 664.6(a).)
 
“Because of its summary nature,
strict compliance with the requirements of section 664.6 is prerequisite to
invoking the power of the court to impose a settlement agreement.” (Sully-Miller
Contracting Co. v. Gledson/Cashman Construction, Inc. (2002) 103
Cal.App.4th 30, 37; Critzer v. Enos (2010) 187 Cal.App.4th 1242, 1262.)
In ruling on a motion under § 664.6, the trial judge may receive oral
testimony, or may determine the motion upon declarations alone. (Corkland v.
Boscoe (1984) 156 Cal.App.3d 989, 994.) Where the agreement was reached at
a court hearing, the court can resolve the dispute on the basis of its own
notes or recollection of what was agreed to (as well as any transcripts of the
proceedings). (Richardson v. Richardson (1986) 180 Cal.App.3d 91, 97.)
 
Analysis
 
Plaintiffs and Cross-Complainants
Chandra Fortier and Jason Laberge move for an order enforcing the terms of written
Settlement and Mutual Release Agreement (hereinafter, the “Agreement”). (CCP § 664.6.)
Specifically, they seek an order that Defendants/Cross-Complainant, Michael
Laberge and Janelle D. Shawver, as administrator of the estate of Pamela
McCarthy, comply with paragraph 3 of the Agreement. Further, they seek an award
of $1,442.50 for attorneys’ fees and costs in bringing this motion. No
opposition was submitted. Notably, on May 28, 2023, Pamela McCarthy died and
her daughter Janelle D. Shawver was appointed administrator of her estate. (See
Anaya Decl., Ex. B [Order for Probate in LASC case no. 23STPB06867].)
 
Moving parties demonstrate that parties entered into the
Agreement. (Anaya Decl., Ex. A.) On March 28, 2023, the parties stipulated for
the court to retain jurisdiction to enforce the settlement pursuant to Code of
Civil Procedure section 664.6. Thus, the court may enter judgment pursuant to
the terms of the settlement pursuant to section 664.6.  Plaintiffs seek to enforce the specific terms
of paragraph 3(a) of the Agreement that provides:  
 
Agreement to Sell Malibu Property.
The Parties agree to list the Malibu Property for sale. The parties further
agree to the following in preparation for the sale: a. The Parties agree to
cooperate in the entire sales transaction, including promptly executing all
necessary documents to facilitate the sale. 
 
Since July 13, 2023, Defendants failed
to sign the letter of intent with the potential buyer of the Malibu Property
and have refused to cooperate with the transfer of Mountain Parcels Nos. 1-4. In
addition, Paragraph 16(g) of the Agreement provides for Attorneys' Fees
 
Accordingly, the motion is GRANTED.
Moving parties are ordered to submit a proposed judgment incorporating the
terms of the Agreement.  The request for
attorneys’ fees is likewise GRANTED and shall be incorporated into the proposed
judgment.
