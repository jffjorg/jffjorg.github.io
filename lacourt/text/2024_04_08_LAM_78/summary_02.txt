Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving professional negligence by a law firm, Law Offices of Saul Reiss, and one of its attorneys, Firouzeh Pugh. The plaintiff, United Clinical Research, Inc., alleges that the defendants failed to provide competent representation and are liable for damages. The defendants have filed a demurrer, arguing that the plaintiff's claim is time-barred because it was filed more than one year after the plaintiff discovered the alleged negligence.

The judge has sustained the demurrer and dismissed the case with prejudice as to all defendants. The judge has determined that the plaintiff's claim is time-barred because it was filed more than one year after the plaintiff discovered the alleged negligence, which occurred on February 28, 2022, when the plaintiff filed a complaint in the Banooni action. The judge has also noted that the plaintiff's claim is based on the same facts and allegations as the Banooni action, and that the plaintiff incurred attorney fees to rectify the alleged negligence when it filed the complaint in the Banooni action.

The judge has denied the plaintiff's request to amend the complaint to cure the defects. The judge has also granted the defendants' request for judicial notice of certain court records and documents. The case is now closed.
