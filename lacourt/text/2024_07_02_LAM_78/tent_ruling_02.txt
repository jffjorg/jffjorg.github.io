 Case Number:  19STCV25230    Hearing Date:   July 2, 2024    Dept:  78 Superior Court of California County of Los Angeles Department 78  HYPE FACTOR, LLC,Plaintiff, vs. JOHN FITZPATRICK, et al., Defendants.  Case No.:  19STCV25230  Hearing Date:  July 2, 2024    [TENTATIVE] RULING RE:  MOTION FOR ENTRY OF STIPULATED JUDGMENTPlaintiff’s motion for stipulated judgment is DENIED. The Court granted Plaintiff’s motion to enforce settlement on May 9, 2024 pursuant to Code Civ. Proc., section 664.6. The section provides that a court may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement. Because the motion has already been granted, this latest motion is unnecessary. The parties need not relitigate arguments pertaining to whether the settlement agreement was enforceable. Therefore, the motion is denied.Plaintiff was required to file a proposed stipulated judgment mirroring the terms of the settlement agreement. Although Plaintiff provided a proposed stipulated judgment as Exhibit 2 to this motion, the proposed judgment is redacted and Plaintiff has not moved to seal the stipulated judgment. Additionally, the proposed judgment includes terms not reflected in the settlement, including admissions of liability. The proposed judgment must mirror the terms of the settlement.  Defendants argue in opposition that this motion should be stayed pending appeal. However, the Court has not entered a final judgment or made any appealable order under Code Civ. Proc., section 904.1. Therefore, an appeal would be premature at this time. In any case, Defendants have not filed a notice of appeal.Plaintiff is ordered to file a proposed stipulated judgment within five days after the date of this order.Moving party to provide notice.DATED: July 2, 2024 ________________________Hon.
