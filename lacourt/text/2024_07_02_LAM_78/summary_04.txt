And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to requests for production of documents. The plaintiff, Rogelio Valenzuela Sanchez, is seeking to compel General Motors, LLC to produce certain documents related to the sale and maintenance of a 2018 GMC Terrain SLE vehicle that he purchased in 2019.

The judge grants the motion in part, ordering General Motors, LLC to produce responsive documents and supplemental responses within 10 days after the date of the order. However, the judge denies the motion with respect to certain requests for documents that relate to General Motors, LLC's policies and procedures for issuing recalls and technical service bulletins.

The judge finds that the documents requested are not relevant to the plaintiff's claims under the Song Beverly Act, and that the information sought is already available through other means. The judge also notes that General Motors, LLC's failure to comply with the court's order to produce a privilege log is a violation of the court's order.

The judge orders General Motors, LLC to provide notice and proof of service of the notice within five court days after the date of the order. The judge also sets a deadline for General Motors, LLC to produce responsive documents and supplemental responses.

Overall, the judge's tentative ruling is a mixed decision, granting the plaintiff's motion in part and denying it in part. The judge's decision is based on the evidence presented and the applicable laws and regulations.
