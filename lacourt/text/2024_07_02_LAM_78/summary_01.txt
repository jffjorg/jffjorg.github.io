And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the Dodgers' motion to tax costs from the memorandum of costs filed by Plaintiff. The judge found that the costs for jury fees, deposition costs, rental of a meeting room, and trial assistant fees were necessary to the litigation. The judge cited various legal authorities to support the denial of the motion, including the California Code of Civil Procedure and previous court decisions. The judge also found that the Plaintiff's counsel had properly justified the costs and that the costs were reasonable and necessary. The judge's tentative ruling will be final unless either party files a written objection or request for reconsideration by the specified deadline.
