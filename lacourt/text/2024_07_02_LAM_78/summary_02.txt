And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for entry of stipulated judgment. The plaintiff had previously obtained an order enforcing the settlement agreement, and this latest motion is unnecessary. The plaintiff was required to file a proposed stipulated judgment mirroring the terms of the settlement agreement, but the proposed judgment is redacted and includes terms not reflected in the settlement. The judge orders the plaintiff to file a new proposed stipulated judgment within five days. The defendants had argued that the motion should be stayed pending appeal, but the judge finds that an appeal would be premature at this time.
