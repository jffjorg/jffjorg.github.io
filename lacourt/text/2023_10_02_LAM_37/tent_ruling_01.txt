Discussion
 
I.         Legal Standard
 
Leave
to amend is permitted under CCP § 473 and § 576. The policy favoring amendment and
resolving all matters in the same dispute is “so strong that it is a rare case
in which denial of leave to amend can be justified. [Citation.]” (Howard
v. County of San Diego (2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 1422.) Notwithstanding
the “policy of great liberality in permitting amendments to the complaint at
any stage of the proceedings, up to and including trial [citations], this
policy should be applied only ‘where no prejudice is shown to the adverse party
. . . .’ [citation].  A different result is indicated ‘where inexcusable
delay and probable prejudice to the opposing party’ is shown.
[Citation].” (Magpali v. Farmers Group (1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 471,
487.) 
¿¿¿¿ 
Under
CRC, rule 3.1324, a motion to amend a pleading before trial must (1) include a
copy of the proposed amendment or amended pleading, which must be serially
numbered to differentiate it from previous pleadings or amendments; (2) state
what allegations in the previous pleading are proposed to be deleted, if any,
and where, by page, paragraph and line number, the deleted allegations are
located; and (3) state what allegations are proposed to be added to the
previous pleading, if any, and where, by page, paragraph, and line number, the
additional allegations are located. (CRC, rule 3.1324(a).) A separate
supporting declaration specifying (1) the effect of the amendment; (2) why the
amendment is necessary and proper; (3) when the facts giving rise to the amended
allegations were discovered; and (4) the reason why the request for amendment
was not made earlier must accompany the motion. (Id., rule
3.1324(b).)¿¿¿ 
 
II.        Leave to File Third Amended complaint 
 
Plaintiff
seeks leave to amend and file a Third Amended Complaint to (1) add a seventh
cause of action for violation of Labor Code §§ 233 and 234 at Paragraphs 97
through 110 and (2) to adjust the numbers of causes of action and paragraphs
thereafter based on the addition of a seventh cause of action and paragraphs 97
through 110. A copy of the proposed amended pleading is attached as Exhibit 1
to the Declaration of Lauren A. Dean. 
 
Plaintiff’s
counsel asserts that during the meet and confer process regarding the
threatened demurrers to the First Amended Complaint, Plaintiff’s counsel
inadvertently failed to set forth a separate cause of action for violations of
Labor Code §§ 233 and 234. (Dean Decl. ¶ 6.) Defense counsel would not
stipulate to allow Plaintiff to amend to add those causes of action and
Plaintiff’s counsel stated she would seek leave to amend. (Id., Ex. 2.)
On July 12, 2023, the parties filed a stipulation to permit Plaintiff to file a
Second Amended Complaint addressing certain deficiencies raised by Defense
Counsel. (Id. ¶ 8.) 
 
Plaintiff’s
counsel admits she again failed to allege a separate claim for violation of Labor
Code § 233 and § 234 as a basis for the cause of action for wrongful
termination in violation of public policy but asserts Plaintiff diligently
moved for leave to amend to add the allegations. (Dean Decl. ¶¶ 9, 10.) The SAC
was filed on July 12, 2023, and Plaintiff filed this Motion on July 21, 2023.
Plaintiff further states that the effect of the proposed amendment is to add a
separate statutory cause of action for violations of Labor Code § 233 and §
234. (Mot. at p. 7:5-7.) Plaintiff further asserts that Defendants will not be
prejudiced by the Motion because they have been on notice of Plaintiff’s
allegation that Defendants violated Labor Code § 233 and § 234, and written
discovery has not yet commenced, and Plaintiff has not been deposed. (Dean
Decl. ¶ 11.)
 
The
court notes the seventh cause of action in the SAC already references Labor
Code § 233 and § 234 and further amendments would likely add clarity to the
SAC. (SAC ¶ 101.) The court is also unpersuaded that a few days' delay in
seeking leave to amend is evidence that Plaintiff was unreasonably dilatory in
seeking amendment. Moreover, Defendants fail to cite any case law requiring
Plaintiff to meet and confer prior to seeking leave to amend. More importantly,
the fact that Defendants may be forced to file a partial demurrer to the
seventh cause of action and request for punitive damages is not evidence of
undue prejudice sufficient to warrant denial of the motion. Leave to amend
may be granted at any stage of the proceeding, up to and including trial so
long as the adverse party is not prejudiced. (See¿Ventura v. ABM Industries
Inc.¿(2012) 212 Cal.App.4th 258, 268.) As discovery has not yet commenced,
any prejudice that the Defendants may experience is minimal and insufficient to
deny Plaintiff’s Motion. 
 
Lastly, whether
Plaintiff’s proposed amendment would be futile is a question that is best
addressed by demurrer. The proper course of conduct would be to
permit the amendments to the complaint and “‘allow the parties to test its
legal sufficiency by demurrer, motion for judgment on the pleadings or other
appropriate proceedings.’ [Citation.]” (Kittredge Sports Co. v. Superior
Court (1989) 213 Cal.App.3d 1045, 1048; see also Atkinson v. Elk Corp.
(2003) 109 Cal.App.4th 739, 760 [same].) Therefore, any objections to the legal
sufficiency of the proposed causes of action should be decided by a separate
motion.¿¿ 
 
As
no prejudice is shown, Plaintiff’s Motion is granted. 
 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiff’s motion for leave to
file a third amended complaint is granted.
