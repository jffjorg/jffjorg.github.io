## English Summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting Plaintiff Jacob Shaw's motion to file a third amended complaint in his case against Honda Performance Development, Inc., Experis US, Inc., Experis US, LLC, and Manpower Group US, Inc.  

The Plaintiff sought to add a seventh cause of action alleging violations of Labor Code §§ 233 and 234.  The Defendants opposed the motion, but the Judge found that no prejudice would be caused to the Defendants by allowing the amendment. This decision was based on the fact that discovery had not yet begun, and the Defendants were already aware of the Plaintiff's allegations regarding the Labor Code violations. 


The Judge also noted that the Seventh cause of action in the current Second Amended Complaint already mentions these Labor Code sections, so the amendment would simply clarify the complaint.  
 
The Judge ultimately ruled that the Plaintiff should be allowed to amend the complaint because the Defendants have not demonstrated any undue prejudice from the amendment.

```

And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge has tentatively ruled that Plaintiff Jacob Shaw's motion for leave to file a third amended complaint is granted. The Plaintiff seeks to add a seventh cause of action for violation of Labor Code §§ 233 and 234 to the Second Amended Complaint (SAC). The Judge has reviewed the proposed amended pleading and notes that the seventh cause of action in the SAC already references Labor Code § 233 and § 234, and further amendments would likely add clarity to the SAC.

The Judge has considered the opposition from the Defendants and finds that there is no prejudice shown as a result of the proposed amendment. The Judge notes that discovery has not yet commenced, and any prejudice that the Defendants may experience is minimal and insufficient to deny the motion. The Judge has also considered the argument that the proposed amendment would be futile, but finds that this is a question that is best addressed by demurrer.

Therefore, the Judge has granted the Plaintiff's motion for leave to file a third amended complaint. Any objections to the legal sufficiency of the proposed causes of action should be decided by a separate motion.

English summary:

On October 2, 2023, a hearing was held regarding Plaintiff Jacob Shaw's motion for leave to file a third amended complaint against Defendants Honda Performance Development, Inc., Experis US, Inc., Experis US, LLC, and Manpower Group US, Inc. The proposed amended pleading seeks to add a seventh cause of action for violation of Labor Code §§ 233 and 234 and adjust the numbers of causes of action and paragraphs thereafter. Plaintiff's counsel asserts that she inadvertently failed to set forth a separate cause of action for violations of Labor Code §§ 233 and 234 in the previous pleadings. The court notes that the seventh cause of action in the SAC already references Labor Code § 233 and § 234 and any further amendments would add clarity to the SAC. The court finds that Plaintiff has been diligent in seeking leave to amend and that Defendants will not be prejudiced by the motion. Therefore, Plaintiff's motion for leave to file a third amended complaint is granted.
