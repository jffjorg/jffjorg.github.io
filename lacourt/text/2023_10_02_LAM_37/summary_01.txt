And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge is granting the Plaintiff's motion for leave to file a third amended complaint. The Plaintiff seeks to add a seventh cause of action for violation of Labor Code §§ 233 and 234 to the Second Amended Complaint. The Judge finds that the addition of this cause of action will not cause prejudice to the Defendants, as they have been on notice of the allegations and written discovery has not yet commenced. The Judge also notes that any objections to the legal sufficiency of the proposed causes of action should be decided by a separate motion. The Judge concludes that the Plaintiff's motion is granted, and the Plaintiff may file a third amended complaint.
