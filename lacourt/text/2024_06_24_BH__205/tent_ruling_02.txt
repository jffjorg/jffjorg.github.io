   LLC, CHRISTOPHER KLEIN 
   ENTERPRISES,

  AND EXECUTIVE AUTO RENTALS, 
   LLC’S
  DEMURRER TO COMPLAINT
 
 
 



 
BACKGROUND
This action arises from a breach of
promissory notes.  Plaintiff A&M
Engineering Inc. made three short-term loans to two Defendants, Global
Automotive Solutions LLC (“GAS”) and GAS’s successor in interest, Stelaro LLC
(“Stelaro”).  The loans total $14
million, only $1 million of which Plaintiff claims has been repaid.  The loans were purportedly used to buy cars
in Mexico which were re-sold for a profit in other countries.  
Defendant Christopher Klein served as the CEO
of GAS and Stelaro.  Defendant Alondra
Group, LLC is the sole shareholder of Stelaro. 
Plaintiff has sued other corporate defendants who it claims are the
alter egos of Klein, including Klein Enterprises LLC (“CKE”), Executive Auto
Rentals, LLC (“EAR”), and Luxury Lift, LLC (“Luxury”).  Plaintiff has also sued Instant Infosystems,
Inc. (“Instant”), a company owned by Christopher Klein’s father (David Klein),
which Plaintiff claims received fraudulent transfers from Stelaro.      
Plaintiff filed the instant action alleging ten
causes of action for (1) breach of contract, (2) fraud-misrepresentation, (3)
fraud-concealment, (4) negligent misrepresentation, (5) receiving stolen
property – Penal Code §
496(a), (c); (6) fraudulent transfer – Civ. Code § 3439 et seq.; (7) breach of
fiduciary duty, (8) unfair competition – Bus. & Prof. Code § 17200; (9)
constructive trust, and (10) unjust enrichment. 

This hearing is on Defendants Klein, GAS,
Stelaro, Alondra, CKE, Luxury and EAR’s (“Moving Defendants’”) demurrer.  Moving Defendants argue that (1) the second,
third and fourth causes of action fail because Plaintiff has not plead fraud
with specificity; (2) the fourth cause of action fails because Plaintiff has
not alleged theft or receipt of stolen property with the requisite criminal
intent, and (3) the ninth and tenth causes of action fail because they are not
causes of action.      
MEET AND CONFER 
Code
Civ. Proc. §430.41 requires that “[b]efore filing a demurrer pursuant to this
chapter, the demurring party shall meet and confer in person or by telephone
with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the
purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve
the objections to be raised in the demurrer.” (Code Civ. Proc. §
430.41(a).)  The parties are to meet and confer at least five days before
the date the responsive pleading is due. (Code Civ. Proc. §
430.41(a)(2).)  Thereafter, the demurring party shall file and serve a
declaration detailing their meet and confer efforts. (Code Civ. Proc. §
430.41(a)(3).)  Moving Defendants submit the declaration of Johnny White attesting
that counsel met and conferred by phone on May 13, 2024, the same date Moving
Defendants filed their demurrer.  This
does not satisfy the meet and confer requirements.  However, the Court cannot sustain or overrule
a demurrer based on an insufficient meet and confer.  (Code Civ. Proc. § 430.41(a)(4).) 
LEGAL STANDARD
A demurrer to a complaint may be general
or special.  A general demurrer
challenges the legal sufficiency of the complaint on the ground it fails to
state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (e); Lewis v.
Safeway, Inc. (2015) 235 Cal.App.4th 385, 388.)  A demurrer can be used only to challenge
defects that appear on the face of the pleading under attack or from matters
outside the pleading that are judicially noticeable.  (See Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co.
(2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994 (in ruling on a demurrer, a court may not
consider declarations, matters not subject to judicial notice, or documents not
accepted for the truth of their contents).) 
For purposes of ruling on a demurrer, all facts pleaded in a complaint
are assumed to be true, but the reviewing court does not assume the truth of
conclusions of law. (Aubry v. Tri-City Hosp. Dist. (1992) 2 Cal.4th 962,
967.)         
A special demurrer challenges other
defects in the complaint, including whether a pleading is uncertain. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (f).)  The term uncertain includes the issue of
whether the pleading is “ambiguous and unintelligible.”  (Id.)  A demurrer for uncertainty should be
sustained if the complaint is drafted in such a manner that the defendant
cannot reasonably respond, i.e., the defendant cannot determine what
issues must be admitted or denied, or what counts are directed against the
defendant. (Khoury v. Maly's of California, Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.)
Leave to amend must
be allowed where there is a reasonable possibility of successful amendment. (See
Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 349 (court shall not “sustain a
demurrer without leave to amend if there is any reasonable possibility that the
defect can be cured by amendment”); Kong v. City of Hawaiian Gardens
Redevelopment Agency (2002) 108 Cal.App.4th 1028, 1037 (“A demurrer should
not be sustained without leave to amend if the complaint, liberally construed,
can state a cause of action under any theory or if there is a reasonable
possibility the defect can be cured by amendment.”).)  The burden is on the complainant to show the
Court that a pleading can be amended successfully. (Blank v. Kirwan
(1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.)
ANALYSIS
Fraud and Negligent Misrepresentation Claims
Defendants
argue that Plaintiff has not plead fraud or negligent misrepresentation with
sufficient particularity.  The Court
disagrees.
“The elements
of fraud are (a) a misrepresentation (false representation, concealment or
nondisclosure), (b) scienter or knowledge of its falsity, (c) intent to induce
reliance, (d) justifiable reliance, and (e) resulting damage.”  (Hinesley v. Oakshade Town Ctr. (2005)
135 Cal.App.4th 289, 294.)  The
facts constituting the fraud must be alleged factually and specifically as to
every element of fraud, as the policy of “liberal construction” of the
pleadings will not ordinarily be invoked. 
(Lazar v. Superior Court (1996) 12 Cal.4th 631, 645.)  The particularity
requirement demands that a plaintiff plead facts which “show how, when, where,
to whom, and by what means the representations were tendered.” (Id.)
The elements of a cause of
action for negligent misrepresentation include “[m]isrepresentation of a past
or existing material fact, without reasonable ground for believing it to be
true, and with intent to induce another’s reliance on the fact misrepresented,
ignorance of the truth, and justifiable reliance on the misrepresentation by
the party to whom it was directed and resulting damage.”  (Hydro-Mill Co. Inc. v. Hayward, Tilton
& Rolapp Ins. Associates, Inc. (2004) 115 Cal.App.4th 1145,
1154.)  Negligent misrepresentation, like fraud, must
be pled with specificity.  (Small v. Fritz
Companies, Inc.
(2003) 30 Cal.4th 167, 184.)  
Here, the Complaint alleges that
Defendants’ misrepresentations fall into two categories: (1) misrepresentations
about GAS’s and Stelaro’s financial status and outlook and (2)
misrepresentations about how Defendants would use the loan money received from
Plaintiff.  (First Amended Complaint
(“FAC”) ¶121.)
As to the
first category, Plaintiff alleges Klein provided him with false financial
statements in the beginning of 2020, 2021 and 2022.  (FAC ¶¶ 
123, 124, 125.)  The financial statements falsely inflated
the assets, revenues, and equity of Stelaro. 
(Id.)  Plaintiff also
alleges seven specific statements in other documents, primarily powerpoint and
Zoom presentations that purportedly touted the financial health of Stelaro,
including that it was “awarded exclusive rights by Mercedes Benz Direct Fleet
Sales for Export of all Mercedes Models to Middle East, Africa, and Asia,” that
it was a “profitable $60 million business with a path to double the company’s
revenue to $125 million over the next 18 months,” that it sold vehicles to “125
different customers in 12 countries,” that it maintained a “procurement network
of over 100 different dealerships in and across Mexico, and that in 2019, “GAS
sold 602 cars, resulting in $33,107,000 total sales and a net profit of
$2,689,000.”   (Id. ¶127.)
As to the
second category, Plaintiff alleges Klein misrepresented how he would use the
proceeds of loans received from Plaintiff. 
Smith “repeatedly told Beljak that GAS and STELARO would use the money [Plaintiff]
loaned and invested to buy cars for resale to customers in China and other
foreign countries which was the essence of GAS/STELARO business.”  (Id. ¶130.)  Plaintiff identifies four specific
misrepresentations made by Klein that Defendants intended to use Plaintiff’s
loans to buy cars for resale.  (Id.
¶¶132-135.)  For example, Klein sent Beljak
on January 17, 2020 a powerpoint presentation which represented that GAS’s “$10
Million Deb Offering” was “To Fund Monthly Mercedes Benz Direct Distribution of
300-500 Vehicles per month.”  (Id. ¶132.)
These
allegations are sufficient to meet the particularity requirement for pleading
fraud and negligent misrepresentation.  Moving
Defendants argue that the bulk of the alleged misstatements were not made by
Klein but were instead made by Scott Smith (a confessed embezzler and a CFO of
both Plaintiff and Stelaro).  This
argument may ultimately prevail, but it is not appropriate on a demurrer where
the Court must accept Plaintiff’s allegations as true.  In any event, the Complaint alleges that
Smith is an agent of the other Defendants (FAC ¶20), and on this basis, his
misrepresentations may be attributed to Klein. 

Moving Defendants also take issue with
particular misrepresentations, arguing they are opinions and not statements of
fact.  Even if that were so, false
financial statements can clearly be the basis of a fraud claim.  And to the extent other misstatements
identified by Plaintiff are mere puffery or “sales talk”, this still does not
support a demurrer as a demurrer cannot be made to only part of a claim.  (Venice Town Council, Inc. v. City of Los
Angeles (1996) 47 Cal.App.4th 1547, 1562; PH II, Inc. v. Superior Court (1995)
33 Cal.App.4th 1680, 1681; Grieves v. Superior Court (1984) 157 Cal.
App. 3d 159, 163-164.)
Moving Defendants further argue that the
second category of misrepresentations (relating to how Plaintiff’s loans would
be used) is controverted by the promissory notes which do not state how the
loans would be used.  While this argument
may ultimately prevail, it is a challenge to the merits of Plaintiff’s
allegations which the Court cannot consider on a demurrer.  The Court may not consider any other
extrinsic evidence or judge the credibility of the allegations plead or the
difficulty a plaintiff may have in proving his allegations.  (Ion Equip. Corp.
v. Nelson (1980)
110 Cal.App.3d 868, 881.)  
Moving Defendants also argue that Plaintiff
has made fundamentally inconsistent allegations regarding Klein.  The Complaint alleges that Klein revealed Mr.
Smith’s embezzlement to Plaintiff.  (FAC ¶¶ 74-75.)  If Klein was operating a Ponzi scheme, taking
investor money to pay himself and family members, then, according to
Defendants, it makes no sense that he would reveal Smith’s embezzlement and
transmit records of it to Plaintiff. 
Again, while this argument may ultimately win out, the Court cannot
weigh the evidence on a demurrer.  (Ion
Equip. Corp., 110 Cal.App.3d at 881.)
In sum, the Court concludes that Plaintiff
has sufficiently stated a claim for fraud and negligent misrepresentation, and
the Court overrules the demurrer to the second and fourth causes of
action.  
Fraudulent
Concealment
The elements of fraudulent concealment
are (1) concealment or suppression of a material fact; by a defendant with a
duty to disclose the fact to the plaintiff; (3) intent to defraud the plaintiff
by intentionally concealing or suppressing the fact; (4) the plaintiff
was unaware of the fact and would not have acted as he or she did if he or she
had known of the concealed or suppressed fact; and (5) the plaintiff sustained
damage as a result of the concealment or suppression of fact.  (Hambridge v.
Healthcare Partners Medical Group, Inc. (2015) 238 Cal.App.4th 124, 162.)
For a cause of action for fraudulent
concealment to be actionable, there generally must exist a fiduciary
relationship between the parties.  (Fink v. Weisman (1933), 132
Cal.App. 724, 730.) In addition,
courts have found other circumstances in which nondisclosure or concealment may
constitute actionable fraud: (1) possession of exclusive knowledge of material
facts not known to the plaintiff; (2) active concealment of a material fact from
the plaintiff; or (3) when partial representations are made but a material fact
is withheld.  (LiMandri v.
Judkins (1997)
52 Cal.App.4th 326, 336.)
“Concealment is a species of fraud, and ‘[f]raud
must be pleaded with specificity.’” (Blickman Turkus,
LP v. MF Downtown Sunnyvale, LLC (2008) 162 Cal.App.4th 858, 878 (bold emphasis added).)  However, the standard particularity
requirement is relaxed as to fraudulent concealment claim.  (See Alfaro v.
Community Housing Improvement System & Planning Assn., Inc. (2009) 171
Cal.App.4th 1356, 1384 (‘less
particularity is required when the facts lie more in the knowledge of the
opposing party”); see also Committee on
Children’s Television, Inc. v. General Foods Corp. (1983) 35 Cal.3d
197, 216- 217 (less particularity required where it
appears from the nature of allegations that defendant necessarily possesses
full information concerning facts in controversy).)   
Here, Plaintiff alleges Defendants failed
to disclose (1) they were using Plaintiff’s loans for expenses other than
vehicle purchases and they were instead using the loan proceeds to pay for
personal expenses (FAC ¶150), (2) Stelaro had not filed tax returns
for 2019, 2020 or 2021 (FAC ¶151), (3) Stelaro was losing money on sales in
Europe (FAC ¶152), (4) Stelaro was consistently falling short of its sales
goals (FAC ¶153), and (5) Stelaro had negative cash flow; it lost money each
year between 2019 and 2022 (FAC ¶154.) 
Plaintiff further alleges Defendants had a duty to disclose these facts
because they made partial representations regarding the financial health of
Stelaro, while omitting these material facts. 
(FAC ¶156.)  The Court concludes
these allegations are sufficient to meet the more relaxed particularity
requirement for a concealment claim. 
Accordingly, the Court overrules the demurrer to the third cause of
action.  
Receipt of Stolen Property
Moving Defendants argue that Plaintiff
has not properly stated a claim for receipt of stolen property under Penal Code
§ 496.  The Court agrees.
Section 496(a) provides, in relevant part, that:
Every
person who buys or receives any property that has been stolen or that has been            obtained in any manner constituting theft ...,
knowing the property to be so stolen or                obtained ... shall be punished by imprisonment in a county jail for not
more than one  year,
or imprisonment pursuant to subdivision (h) of
Section 1170.
Section
496(c) states that “[a]ny person who has been injured by a
violation of subdivision
(a)
... may bring an action for three times the amount of actual damages, if any,
sustained by the plaintiff, costs of suit, and reasonable attorney's fees.” Cal.
Penal Code § 496(c).
California courts have
held that “[s]ection
496(a) extends to property ‘that has been obtained in any
manner constituting theft.’”  (Bell
v. Feibush (2013) 212 Cal.App.4th 1041).  Penal Code § 484 defines theft and states that “[e]very
person ... who shall knowingly and designedly, by any false or fraudulent
representation or pretense, defraud any other person of money, labor or real or
personal property, ... is guilty of theft.” (Cal.
Penal Code § 484(a).)
Additionally, “[t]he elements required to
show a violation of section
496(a) are
simply that (i) property was stolen or obtained in a manner constituting theft,
(ii) the defendant knew the property was so stolen or obtained, and (iii) the
defendant received or had possession of the stolen property.”  (Switzer
v. Wood (2019) 35 Cal.App.5th 116).
The California Supreme Court has
emphasized that “not all commercial or consumer disputes alleging that a
defendant obtained money or property through fraud, misrepresentation, or
breach of a contractual promise will amount to a theft.”  (Siry Inv., L.P. v. Farkhondehpour (2022)
13 Cal. 5th 333, 361.)  
Here, Plaintiff alleges that it is owed $13,000,000
in loans, and Defendants have engaged in fraudulent transfers.  These allegations do not amount to theft.  Plaintiff voluntarily made loans to Stelaro
LLC for which it allegedly received some but not all repayments.  Defendants did not steal Plaintiff’s
money.    
Accordingly, the Court sustains the
demurrer to the fifth cause of action.  
Constructive Trust
Moving
Defendants argue that there is no cause of action for constructive trust.  The Court agrees.
In
California, constructive trust is a remedy, not a cause of action. (PCO,
Inc. v. Christensen, Miller, Fink, Jacobs, Glaser, Weil & Shapiro, LLP (2007)
150 Cal. App. 4th 384, 398 (“A constructive trust, however, is an equitable
remedy, not a substantive claim for relief.”).) Because California does not
recognize constructive trust as a cause of action, plaintiff does not, and can
never, state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action for constructive
trust.  Pleading constructive trust as a
cause of action instead of a remedy subjects the claim to demurrer. (Stanfield
v. Starkey (1990) 220 Cal. App. 3d 59, 76.) 
Moreover,
even if constructive trust was a cause of action, Plaintiff cannot satisfy the
conditions for the imposition of a constructive trust.  “[A] constructive trust may only be imposed
where the following three conditions are satisfied: (1) the existence of a res
(property or some interest in property); (2) the right of a complaining party
to that res; and (3) some wrongful acquisition or detention of the res by
another party who is not entitled to it.” 
(Communist Party v. 522 Valencia, Inc. (1995) 35 Cal. App. 4th
980, 990.)  
Here,
there is no res as to which Plaintiff has any colorable claim of right that can
be subject to a constructive trust.  Plaintiff
merely has a generalized claim for money allegedly owed.  (Kraus v. Willow Park Public Golf Course
(1977) 73 Cal. App. 3d 354, 373 (“[A] constructive trust is an equitable remedy
imposed where the defendant holds title or some interest in certain property
which it is inequitable for him to enjoy as against the plaintiff.”); Michaelian
v. State Comp. Ins. Fund (1996) 50 Cal. App. 4th 1093, 1114 (“specific
identifiable property to which defendant has title” is a “pleading
requirement”).)  A
constructive trust is not an appropriate remedy for a claim that “is
essentially one for money damages.”  (Evans v. Scribe One Ltd. LLC (D. Ariz.
Jan. 21, 2022) 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11600 *28.)
In sum,
California law holds that constructive trust is a remedy, and not a standalone
cause of action, and Plaintiff has not identified a specific identifiable
property that could be subject to a constructive trust.  Accordingly, the Court sustains the demurrer
to the ninth cause of action. 
Unjust Enrichment
Moving
Defendants argue there is no cause of action for unjust enrichment.  The Court agrees.  
“[T]here
is no cause of action in California for unjust enrichment.” (Melchior v. New
Line Prods. Inc. (2003) 106 Cal. App. 4th 779, 793.)  It is a general principle rather than a
remedy in its own right.  (Id.)  It describes the theory underlying a claim
that a defendant has been unjustly conferred a benefit by the plaintiff.  
Return
of that benefit is the remedy “typically sought in a quasi-contract cause of
action.” (55 Cal. Jur. 3d (2024) Restitution § 2; Munoz v. MacMillan (2011) 195
Cal. App. 4th 648, 661.)  However, “a
plaintiff may not plead the existence of an enforceable contract and
simultaneously maintain a quasi-contract claim unless the plaintiff also pleads
facts suggesting that the contract may be unenforceable or invalid.”  (Berlanga v. Univ. of San Francisco (2024)
100 Cal. App. 5th 75, 89.)
Here, Plaintiff
does not plead a quasi-contract cause of action. There are also express
contracts under which Plaintiff seeks to recover, and no allegations as to how
those contracts are or may become invalid or unenforceable.  Accordingly, the Court sustains the demurrer
as to the tenth cause of action.  
CONCLUSION
For
the foregoing reasons, the Court SUSTAINS IN PART and OVERRULES IN
PART Defendants’ demurrer.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
