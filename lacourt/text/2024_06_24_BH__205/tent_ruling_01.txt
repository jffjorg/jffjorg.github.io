  Case Number:  23SMCV03384    Hearing Date:   June 24, 2024    Dept:  205 HEARING DATE:  May 22, 2024 JUDGE/DEPT:  Moreton/Beverly Hills, 205 CASE NAME: Malibu Dream Team Inc. v. Sondors, Inc.  CASE NUMBER:  23SMCV03384  COMP. FILED:  July 26, 2023    PROCEEDINGS:  REQUEST FOR ENTRY OF DEFAULT JUDGMENT MOVING PARTY:  Malibu Dream Team Inc.  RESPONDING PARTY: Sondors, Inc.   This is a breach of contract case.  Plaintiff Malibu Dream Team Inc. provides marketing and sale services to manufacturers seeking access to major retailers in the United States.  Plaintiff entered into a Marketing Services Agreement (the “Agreement”) with Defendant Sondors, Inc. on January 6, 2021, for a term of two years.   The Agreement provides for Plaintiff’s services to develop marketing programs to sell Defendant’s electric bikes in the United States.  Plaintiff placed Defendant’s bikes in Costco Warehouse stores.  Costco sold approximately $20 million of Defendant’s bikes until about August 2023, when Defendant stopped operating. The Agreement provides for a performance fee of 1.5% of net sales.  Further, the Agreement provided that if terminated or not renewed by Defendant, Plaintiff will be entitled to a commission for a period of fourteen months from the date of termination, i.e., through May 5, 2024.   Defendant defaulted on the payments to Plaintiff.  Plaintiff claims unpaid commissions of $188,219.46.   On July 26, 2023, Plaintiff filed a Complaint against Defendant.  The Complaint alleges two claims for breach of contract and common count.  The Complaint seeks $357,000 in damages plus interest at the statutory rate of 10% per annum.    The Court ordered service of the Complaint on the Secretary of State.  Service was made on November 29, 2023.  Defendant was obligated to respond.  Defendant did not do so.  Plaintiff successfully requested the entry of Defendant’s default, which was entered by the Clerk’s Office on February 16, 2024.    Plaintiff now seeks default judgment.  However, the relief requested is different as between Plaintiff’s proposed judgment (JUD 100) and its request for default judgment (CIV 100).  The CIV 100 form seeks $197,699.41 consisting of $188,219 in damages, $8,624.00 in interest and $885.95 in costs.  The JUD 100 seeks $198,711.55 consisting of $188,219 in damages, $9,410 in prejudgment interest, and $1,082.55 in costs.  Given the discrepancy, the Court denies the request for entry of default judgment.
