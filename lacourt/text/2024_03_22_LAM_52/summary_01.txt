And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the plaintiff's application for default judgment against the defendants, Andrew Zuker dba Cazco Construction and Cazco Construction LLC. The plaintiff's application meets the requirements for default judgment, but the requested attorney fees are excessive. The plaintiff seeks attorney fees under Civil Code section 1717.5, which caps the amount at $1,200. The plaintiff's counsel, however, has requested $1,589.40 in attorney fees, which is above the allowed amount. Therefore, the court will reduce the judgment's amount of attorney fees to $1,200. The plaintiff's request for default judgment is granted in part, and the court will enter judgment after modifying the proposed judgment.
