  Case Number:  22STCV24239    Hearing Date:   March 22, 2024    Dept:  52 Order to Show Cause Re: Entry of
Default Judgment
Plaintiff
American Decking & Waterproofing Co requests court judgment by default
against defendants Andrew Zuker dba Cazco
Construction and Cazco Construction LLC. 
Plaintiff’s application meets all requirements for default judgment.  
The
application, however, seeks excessive attorney fees.  Plaintiff requests attorney fees for this
“action on a contract based on a book account” under Civil Code section 1717.5.  Subdivision (a) of that section provides, “Reasonable
attorney’s fees awarded pursuant to this section for the prevailing party
bringing the action on the book account shall be fixed by the court in an
amount that shall not exceed the lesser of: (1) nine hundred sixty dollars
($960) for book accounts based upon an obligation owing by a natural person for
goods, moneys, or services which were primarily for personal, family, or
household purposes; and one thousand two hundred dollars ($1,200) for all other
book accounts to which this section applies; or (2) 25 percent of the principal
obligation owing under the contract.” 
Plaintiff’s counsel, however, requests $1,589.40 in attorney fees.  (Bemis Decl., ¶ 4.)  Plaintiff may only recover $1,200 pursuant to
Civil Code section 1717.5.  The court
will therefore reduce the judgment’s amount of attorney fees to $1,200.
Plaintiff’s request for default
judgment is granted in part.  The
court will modify the proposed judgment plaintiff submitted on form JUD-100 and
will enter judgment.
