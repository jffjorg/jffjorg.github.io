 Case Number:  23STCV00076    Hearing Date:   March 22, 2024    Dept:  52 Order to Show Cause Re: Entry of Default Judgment 
            On
October 3, 2023, the court continued the hearing on this order to show cause
re: entry of default judgment.  On
January 17, 2024, plaintiff Salvador Lopez, Jr. filed a first amended
complaint.  Doing so vacated the defaults
of defendants Advance Pipe Bending, a business entity form unknown, and
Mitchell McCray.  (Greenup v. Rodman (1986) 42 Cal.3d 822, 830; accord Airs
Aromatics, LLC v. CBL Data Recovery Technologies, Inc. (2018) 23 Cal.App.5th 1013, 1025.) 
California Rules of
Court, rule 3.110(g) provides, “If a responsive pleading is not served within
the time limits specified in this rule and no extension of time has been
granted, the plaintiff must file a request for entry of default within 10 days
after the time for service has elapsed.  The
court may issue an order to show cause why sanctions should not be imposed if
the plaintiff fails to timely file the request for the entry of default.”  
Plaintiff filed proofs of
service of the first amended complaint on defendants.  Defendants have not filed responsive
pleadings within the time limit.  Plaintiff
did not timely file a request for entry of their defaults.  The court therefore will order plaintiff to
show cause why sanctions should not be imposed. 

Disposition
The court hereby continues the order to show cause
re: entry of default judgment to May 17, 2024, at 8:30 a.m.  
The court hereby sets an order to show
cause re: why plaintiff should not pay $100 in sanctions under rule 3.110(g)
for May 17, 2024, at 8:30 a.m.
