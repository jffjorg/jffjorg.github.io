And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the plaintiff, Salvador Lopez, Jr., failed to timely file a request for entry of default against the defendants, Advance Pipe Bending and Mitchell McCray, after they did not file responsive pleadings to the first amended complaint. As a result, the court will continue the order to show cause re: entry of default judgment to May 17, 2024, and will also set an order to show cause re: why the plaintiff should not pay $100 in sanctions under California Rules of Court, rule 3.110(g). The court cites prior case law, including Greenup v. Rodman and Airs Aromatics, LLC v. CBL Data Recovery Technologies, Inc., to support its decision.
