And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by Defendant Saenz LLC to the Complaint filed by Plaintiff Briana Jocelyn Garcia-Nava. The Court has found that the demurrer is OVERRULED.

The Court has determined that the Complaint states facts sufficient to support the causes of action for breach of implied warranty of habitability, tortious breach of implied warranty of habitability, and negligence. The Court has found that the defendant had notice of and sufficient time to cure the alleged defective conditions, including the failure to install a working heater and carbon monoxide alarms in the unit.

The Court has also found that the plaintiff's conduct in bringing a charcoal barbecue indoors was not unforeseeable, as the defendant was aware that people without heaters can mistakenly engage in dangerous conduct to heat their homes.

The Court has denied Defendant Saenz LLC's request to strike the plaintiff's demand for punitive damages, as the Complaint sets forth the required elements for a prima facie claim for punitive damages.

The Court's ruling is subject to change after further briefing and argument.
