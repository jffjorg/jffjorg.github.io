And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied Plaintiff Westlake Services' motion to compel Defendant Hitham Ahmed's responses to its Request for Production, Set Two. The Judge found that Plaintiff's motion was untimely and that Defendant had served a response to the request, albeit after the deadline for serving a response had passed. The Judge also found that the request for production was duplicative of a previous set of requests and that Plaintiff had failed to file a motion to compel further responses within the statutory deadline.

The Judge noted that Defendant's failure to serve a timely response waived all objections to the request for production, including privilege and work product. The Judge also found that Plaintiff was substantially justified in filing the motion and therefore denied sanctions against Defendant.

The Judge's ruling is based on the facts that Defendant failed to serve a timely response to the request for production, that the request for production was duplicative of a previous set of requests, and that Plaintiff failed to file a motion to compel further responses within the statutory deadline.
