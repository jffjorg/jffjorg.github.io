```

And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge is granting the defendant's motion to dismiss the case with prejudice. The plaintiffs failed to file an amended complaint after the court sustained a demurrer and granted a motion to strike, despite being given leave to amend. The failure to file a proper and timely opposition in trial court creates a waiver of the issues on any appeal. The court is not obligated to seek out unspoken theories or articulate what the plaintiffs may have left unspoken. Given the expiration of the time to amend the pleading and the applicable law, the court grants the motion to dismiss the case with prejudice.
