Villas Homeowners Assn. v. Haghverdian (2003) 111 Cal. App. 4th 683, 693. A
judge in a civil case is not "'obligated to seek out theories [a party]
might have advanced, or to articulate … that which … [a party] has left
unspoken.'" Mesecher v. County of San Diego (1992) 9 Cal. App. 4th 1677,
1686.
Code of Civil Procedure “Section 581, subdivision
(f)(2) ‘… gives the defendant the right to obtain a court order dismissing the
action with prejudice once the court sustains a demurrer with leave to amend
and the plaintiff has not amended within the time given.’ ” Cano v. Glover
(2006) 143 Cal.App. 4th 326, 330.
Given the expiration of the time in which to amend the
pleading, and the applicable law, the Court grants the motion to dismiss.
