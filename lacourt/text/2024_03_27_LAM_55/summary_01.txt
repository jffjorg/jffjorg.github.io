```

And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for summary judgment and alternative motion for summary adjudication filed by the Defendant, Broadway Exchange Building, LP. The Plaintiff, Vianey Elizabeth Sanderson, alleges that the Defendant took forcible possession of a leased commercial premises without legal process. The Defendant seeks summary judgment or summary adjudication of the affirmative defense of abandonment.

The judge finds that the Plaintiff raised triable issues of material fact as to whether the Plaintiff's obligation to pay rent was delayed until after the expiration of the COVID-19 pandemic-related moratorium on evictions. The judge also finds that the Defendant failed to meet its burden of proof to show that the Plaintiff abandoned the premises, and that the lease option to extend was exercised by the Plaintiff.

Therefore, the judge denies the motion for summary judgment and alternative motion for summary adjudication, finding that there are triable issues of material fact that preclude summary judgment or adjudication.
