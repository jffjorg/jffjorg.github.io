And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Plaintiff Danny Bakewell, Sr.'s motion for fees and costs in the sum of $45,905.00, which was filed in connection with the court's order granting Plaintiff's motion to compel the deposition of Robert Cooper. The judge found that the notice of motion failed to identify the party to be sanctioned, which is a violation of due process. The judge cited the case of Blumenthal v. Superior Court (1980) 103 Cal.App.3d 317, which held that an award of sanctions against counsel was improper where counsel had no reason to suspect that sanctions would be awarded against him individually. The judge denied Plaintiff's motion without prejudice, meaning that Plaintiff may re-file the motion if the deficiencies in the notice of motion are corrected.
