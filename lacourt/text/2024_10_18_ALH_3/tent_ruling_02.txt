Plaintiff Shanghai Tongsheng Investment
Co., Ltd. (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Zhou Xiaoguang (“Zhou”) and Yu
Yunxin (“Yu”) to domesticate three foreign judgments      obtained in a court-led mediation in China. Yu filed an answer
in November 2023 and is in involuntary Chapter 7 bankruptcy proceedings
instigated by Plaintiff. On March 28, 2024, the Court stayed this matter and
set a further status conference on October 7, 2024, which was then continued to
October 18, 2024. 
The entire matter remains stayed.
Should the Court lift that stay on October 18, 2024, and set a date for considering
the Plaintiff’s application for a default judgement as to Defendant Zhou,
Plaintiff will need to address the deficiencies discussed below.
Plaintiff’s Director and General
Manager, Haifei Pan, declares that three judgments obtained in China grant
Plaintiff a total of CNY 101,877,513 and that Yu and Zhou are jointly and
severally liable for this amount. (Pan Decl., ¶¶ 9-13.) Enforcement proceedings
in China resulted in CNY 316,838,05, leaving CNY 101,560,674.95 to be
recovered. Using the prevailing rate of exchange as of May 3, 2024, which was
around CNY 7.2405 per USD, this converts into $14,026,748.84. At this time,
Plaintiff seeks a default judgment against Zhou for $14,169,526.93, consisting
of $14,026,748.84 in damages, attorney fees of $142,157.49, and $620.60 in
costs.
There are several issues with Plaintiff’s
application. First, the Court notes that Plaintiff has not dismissed Yu from
the action. In an action
against several defendants, a judge may enter a default judgment against one or
more defendants and allow the action to proceed against the other defendants,
if more than one judgment is proper, such as where the defendants’ liability is
joint and several or exclusively several. (Code Civ. Proc. § 579; Mirabile
v. Smith (1953) 119 Cal.App.2d 685, 689.) California Rules of Cour rule 3.1800
requires that a party seeking a default judgment must include “[a] dismissal of
all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application for separate
judgment against specified parties under Code of Civil Procedure section 579,
supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment.” No such application was
included in Plaintiff’s default package. 
Second, Plaintiff has not shown that it
is entitled to $142,157.49 in attorneys’ fees. Plaintiff’s request for fees is
made under Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5(c) and Local Rule 3.124. However,
“[a]ttorney's fees incurred in enforcing a judgment are not included in costs
collectible under this title unless otherwise provided by law. Attorney's fees
incurred in enforcing a judgment are included as costs collectible under this
title if the underlying judgment includes an award of attorney's fees to the
judgment creditor pursuant to subparagraph (A) of paragraph (10) of subdivision
(a) of Section 1033.5.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 685.040.) Only one of the three
signed mediation statements includes an award of CNY 70,000 in “counsel fees”
and it is unclear whether fees were authorized by contract, statute, or law. Therefore,
Plaintiff does not demonstrate that it may recover its attorneys’ fees as
costs. Also, even if attorneys’ fees were authorized by the underlying
judgments, only one of the three judgments allowed for the recovery of
attorneys’ fees. Accordingly, the calculation of attorneys’ fees pursuant to
Local Rule 3.214 would have to be based on that portion of damages, not the
total amount. 
[Consistent with the foregoing, the
Court sets a Default Prove-Up Hearing for _______________ at 8:30 a.m. in
Department 3 of the Alhambra Courthouse.]

this 18th
day of October, 2024
