And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling denies the plaintiff's motion to compel the deposition of Philip Holguin-Caban, a former employee of Aldi Inc., citing health issues. The plaintiff argues that Holguin-Caban's deposition is critical because there is no video footage of the incident or the period before the incident, and that he has knowledge of the incident. The defendant opposes the deposition, citing Holguin-Caban's health issues and claiming that he is incapable of testifying. The court finds that the defendant has not shown that Holguin-Caban is incapable of testifying, and that the plaintiff has not proved that he is competent to testify. The court also finds that the defendant's opposition is not substantial justification for refusing to produce Holguin-Caban for deposition. The court denies the motion and does not impose sanctions.
