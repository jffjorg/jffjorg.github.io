```

Summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge grants in part and denies in part Plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to discovery requests. The Judge orders Defendant to provide supplemental responses within 30 days and requires Defendant to provide a privilege log for any objections based on privilege. The Judge also sets an Order to Show Cause regarding whether Defendant's affirmative defenses should be stricken for failure to plead facts as required by law. The Judge notes that Plaintiff timely filed the motion and that Defendant's objections are without merit. The Judge also warns that continued action of this type may result in monetary sanctions under Code of Civil Procedure section 177.5.
