And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion to consolidate cases 22SMCV01175 and 23SMCV03392 and vacate the dates. The motion was filed by Plaintiff/Cross-Defendants Carrington Mortgage Services, LLC and Wilmington Savings Fund Society, FSB, as Trustee of Upland Mortgage Loan Trust A, who argued that the two cases involve common issues of fact, law, and common witnesses, and that consolidation would save judicial resources by avoiding two separate cases adjudicated and would avoid potentially inconsistent results. However, the judge found that the cases are pending in different departments, and the Court previously deemed the cases not related. The judge also noted that the Los Angeles Superior Court, Local Rules, rule 3.3(g) prohibits the consolidation of cases that are not in the same department. Therefore, the motion was denied.
