```

And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for an order permitting pretrial discovery of the defendants' financial condition. The plaintiff had argued that there is a substantial probability that he will prevail on his claims for punitive damages against the defendants, but the judge has found that the plaintiff has not made a sufficient showing to establish this. The judge has noted that the plaintiff's claims of fraud could support an award for punitive damages, but the evidence presented does not show a strong likelihood of obtaining such an award. The judge has also pointed out that Civil Code section 3295, subdivision (c), provides that despite the general rule prohibiting pretrial discovery into a defendant's financial status, the plaintiff may subpoena documents or witnesses to be available at trial for the purpose of establishing the defendant's financial condition. Therefore, the plaintiff is not without recourse if he prevails on his punitive damages claims at trial.
