And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Defendant Sprout Mortgage, LLC's motion to enforce a confidential settlement agreement. The agreement states that Plaintiffs Shahram Jeff Javidzad and Monica Nourman Javidzad shall be responsible for all future property tax payments, including the payment due in November 2022. The judge has ordered Plaintiffs' escrow company to release $24,600.11 to Defendant, as Plaintiffs were obligated to pay this amount under the agreement. The judge has also denied Defendant's request for attorneys' fees and costs, as Defendant has not provided sufficient information to support its claim.

The judge has also denied Plaintiffs' motion to enforce the settlement agreement and for an award of fees and costs. The judge has found that the agreement is clear in its language, and Plaintiffs cannot claim that they did not intend to pay the property taxes due in November 2022. The judge has also granted Defendant's motion to file its motion to enforce the settlement agreement under seal, as the terms of the agreement are confidential and unauthorized disclosure could cause harm to the parties involved.
