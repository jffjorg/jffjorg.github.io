Significant Statements:
  - The purpose of a motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication is to provide courts with a mechanism to cut through the parties’ pleadings in order to determine whether, despite their allegations, trial is in fact necessary to resolve their dispute.
  - A defendant moving for summary judgment or summary adjudication has met his or her burden of showing that a cause of action has no merit if the party has shown that one or more elements of the cause of action . . . cannot be established, or that there is a complete defense to the cause of action.
  - Once the defendant . . . has met that burden, the burden shifts to the plaintiff . . . to show that a triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to the cause of action or a defense thereto.
```

And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion for summary adjudication as to the first and second causes of action. The first cause of action is for breach of lease, and the second cause of action is for breach of guaranty. The plaintiff presented undisputed evidence that it owns the property at 510 Wilshire Boulevard and that the defendant failed to pay rent. The defendant argued that there were triable issues as to whether the plaintiff performed its obligations under the contract, but the judge found that the defendant failed to create a triable issue of material fact. The judge also found that the defendant's claims of force majeure and hardship were not supported by evidence. The defendant owes a total of $243,176.83 in rent and attorney fees, and the plaintiff is entitled to recover that amount.
