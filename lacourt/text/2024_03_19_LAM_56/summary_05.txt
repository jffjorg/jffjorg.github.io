Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the moving papers and opposition to the demurrer to the First Amended Complaint (FAC) and the motion to strike the request for punitive damages. The FAC alleges that the defendants breached a written contract, breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and intentionally interfered with a contract. The court held that the FAC does not sufficiently plead facts to support a cause of action for breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and therefore sustained the demurrer to that cause of action. The court, however, held that the FAC does sufficiently plead facts to support a cause of action for intentional interference with contract, and therefore overruled the demurrer to that cause of action. The court also denied the motion to strike the request for punitive damages, finding that the FAC sufficiently pleads facts to support the request.
