And here is the summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for protective order filed by JSR Capital, LLC. The motion sought to extend the response time for responding to document demands and to award sanctions against Plaintiff, Yogi Securities Holdings, LLC, and its counsel.

The judge found that the motion for protective order is moot as to the request for a 60-day extension of time, as JSR has already had 164 days to respond to the document demands. However, the judge noted that the motion was meritorious at the time of filing, as JSR's counsel, Robert Hirsh, had informed Plaintiff's counsel of his health issues and the religious observance of JSR's managing member, Jona Rechnitz, which disrupted his ability to respond to the document demands.

The judge also found that Plaintiff's refusal to grant a 60-day extension and trial continuance was not sanctionable conduct, as Plaintiff had not demonstrated that it acted with substantial justification. The judge noted that JSR still has not provided the responses and responsive documents to the document demands despite receiving an extension by virtue of the filing of the present motion.

The judge denied the motion for protective order and the request for sanctions. The judge found that neither party had shown that imposition of sanctions was warranted against the other party concerning this motion.
