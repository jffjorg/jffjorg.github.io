            The Court has considered the moving,

BACKGROUND
             On September 8, 2020, Plaintiffs Hans H. Kim
and Aqua Wetclean, LLC (“Plaintiffs”) filed the operative Second Amended
Complaint (“SAC”) against Defendants Cuil Investments LLC; Jane’s Management
Systems, LLC; Magic Properties, Inc.; Xiang Hao Cui; John Ko; David Yoo; and
DOES 1 through 10 (“Defendants”), inclusive for (1) Breach of Contract; (2)
Breach of the Covenant of Repair; (3) Contractual Abatement of Rent; (4) Fraud
and Deceit; (5) Fraudulent Concealment; (6) Conspiracy to Defraud; (7)
Negligent Misrepresentation; (8) Breach of Fiduciary Duty; (9) Intentional
Interference with Prospective Economic Advantage; and (10) Unfair Business
Practices. 
 
            On November 17, 2023, Defendant Cuil
Investments, LLC (“Cuil LLC”) filed this instant Motion to Compel Further
Responses to Requests for Admission, Form Interrogatories, Specially Prepared
Interrogatories, and Requests for Production of Documents. On March 6, 2024,
Plaintiffs filed their opposition. On March 12, 2024, Cuil LLC filed its reply.

 
MEET AND CONFER 
             Motions to compel further responses to
interrogatories, requests for admissions, and requests for production of
documents must also be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (b); Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.290, subd. (b); Code Civ.
Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (b).)¿¿¿¿ The Court finds that this requirement
has been met. Therefore, the Court will review the moving, opposition, and
reply papers on the merits below.
 
DISCUSSION
            Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure Sections
2030.300, subdivision (a), 2033.290, and 2031.310 parties may move for a
further response to interrogatories, requests for admissions, or requests for
production of documents where an answer to the requests are evasive or
incomplete or where an objection is without merit or too general.¿¿ 
 
Notice
of the motions must be given within 45 days of service of the verified
response, otherwise, the propounding party waives any right to compel a further
response. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (c); Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.290,
subd. (c); Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (c).) 
 
Finally,
Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1345, subdivision (a)(3) requires that all motions
or responses involving further discovery contain a separate statement with the
text of each request, the response, and a statement of factual and legal
reasons for compelling further responses. (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1345,
subd. (a)(3)).¿ 
 
Timeliness
            As an initial matter, the Court
notes that Cuil LLC improperly filed multiple motions to compel further
responses into a single motion, which is contrary to court policy. Nonetheless,
the motion is timely made. Cuil LLC filed this motion on November 17, 2023 and
Plaintiff Aqua Wetclean, LLC’s initial responses to the discovery requests were
served on October 3, 2023, after having received an extension of time to
respond. (Sergenian Decl., ¶¶ 7-12, Ex. E-I.) Thus, the motion was filed within
45 days of Plaintiff Wetclean, LLC’s initial response and the Court is not
jurisdictionally prohibited from considering the instant motion. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (c); Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.290, subd. (c); Code Civ.
Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (c).)
 
Motion to Compel Further Responses 
            Cuil LLC moves for an
order compelling Aqua Wetclean to serve further responses to Cuil LLC’s set of
Requests for Admission, Form Interrogatories, Specially Prepared
Interrogatories, and Requests for Production of Documents served on Aqua
Wetclean on August 23, 2023. Cuil LLC argues that Aqua Wetclean has refused to
provide responses to numerous discovery requests that are directly relevant to
damages issues; contract formation and standing; communications regarding
alleged leak and request for abatement; Aqua Wetclean’s contentions in the SAC;
Natures Best Garment Care, Inc.; and documents relating to this action. Cuil
LLC further argues Aqua Wetclean provided evasive, incomplete, and missing
responses to RFA No. 38, Form Interrogatory No. 17.1 (RFA 37), RFA Nos. 41-42,
Form Interrogatory No. 17.1 (RFA 47). Moreover, Cuil LLC contends Aqua
Wetclean’s objections are without merit because the terms used were
self-explanatory and/or clear and unambiguous. Cuil LLC also contends Aqua
Wetclean’s privacy objections to Special Interrogatories Nos. 36-37, 43, 47,
and 50-53  should not be sustained
because corporations do not have a constitutional right to privacy and the
discovery’s relevance to the subject matter of the pending case and whether it
is reasonably calculated to lead to discovery of admissible evidence is
balanced against the corporate right of privacy. Similarly, Cuil LLC contends
third party privacy interests are also outweighed by the relevance of the
discovery requests. Likewise, Cuil LLC argues Aqua Wetclean’s confidential,
propriety, and trade secret objections to Special Interrogatories Nos. 38-41
and RFP Nos. 72, 76-78, and 80-85 are boilerplate objections without merit but
to the extent there are valid concerns, they can be ameliorated by a standard
protective order, which it has informed Aqua Wetclean it is willing to enter.
Additionally, Cuil LLC asserts Aqua Wetclean’s objections to Special
Interrogatories Nos. 54, 56-60 and RFP Nos. 69, 73-74, 76, 80, 82-83, and 88 as
duplicative/cumulative should be overruled because Aqua Wetclean made no
attempt to explain how they are duplicative or cumulative. Furthermore, Cuil
LLC argues Aqua Wetclean’s objections to RFP Nos. 66-78, 80-85, and 88 on the
grounds that they violate Code of Civil procedure Section 2033.060, subdivision
(d) should be overruled because that provision applies to RFAs not RFPs. Also,
Cuil LLC asserts Aqua Wetclean’s equally available objections are improper to a
document a request. Cuil LLC further asserts Aqua Wetclean’s objections to RFP
Nos. 67, 69-85, and 88 on the grounds that the requests fail to comply with
Code of Civil Procedure Section 2031.030, subdivision (c)(1) should be
overruled because it has complied with this provision. In addition, Cuil LLC
argues Aqua Wetclean has provided no information to supports its claim that
Special Interrogatories Nos. 38-41 and 43, and RFP Nos. 66-67, 69-85, 87-88 are
burdensome or oppressive. Finally, Cuil LLC argues Aqua Wetclean’s objections
to RFP Nos. 66, 70-72, and 85 on the basis of attorney work product doctrine
and RFP Nos. 70, 72, 85, and 87 on the basis of attorney-client privilege can
be addressed by Aqua Wetclean providing a privilege log. 
 
            In opposition,  Plaintiffs argue that they have supplemented
their responses as previously agreed and otherwise, in an effort to move this
process forward, thus the motion is moot and should be denied. Nevertheless,
Plaintiffs go on to argue that its responses to RFA Nos. 34-35, 38-39, 41,
44-46 were sufficient because the RFAs are entirely irrelevant or cleverly
worded seeking to craft admissions of disputed facts. Furthermore, Plaintiffs
contend no further response is required to Form Interrogatory 17.1 as it
corresponds to RFA Nos. 34-35, 37-39, 41-42, 44-47 is required. Moreover,
Plaintiffs assert Special Interrogatories Nos. 36-37, 39, 44-47, and 52-59 have
been substantially complied with and their objections are substantially
justified because Plaintiffs do not have to prove their damages to the penny
but in the event they are not supplemented by the date of this opposition,
supplemented responses will be provided before the hearing on the motion.
Additionally, Plaintiffs contend Cuil LLC lacks good cause to compel further
responses to the RFPs. Lastly, Plaintiffs argue Cuil LLC filed this motion
instead of awaiting their supplemental responses.  
 
            In reply, Cuil LLC
argues Aqua Wetclean’s assertion that this motion could have been avoided is
baseless because Aqua Wetclean refused to provide supplemental responses to the
majority of discovery requests at issue in this motion during the meet and
confer process. Cuil LLC further argues Aqua Wetclean served it supplemental
responses on March 6, 2024 and March 11, 2024, which is four months after Aqua
Wetclean originally stated it might provide supplemental responses to some of
the requests at issue. Cuil LLC also contends Aqua Wetclean’s only substantive
argument concerning RFA No. 35  is without
merit because Cuil LLC is entitled to admission or denial under oath and there
is no exception based on whether the other party knowns the answer to the
request for admission. Additionally, Cuil LLC argues Aqua Wetclean makes no
argument with respect to any other RFA that is raised in the motion or with
respect to any other specific discovery requests at issue, so this is a
concession that the motion is meritorious. Last, Cuil LLC asserts Aqua Wetclean
failed to provide supplemental responses to Form Interrogatory No. 17.1 (RFAs
37, 42, and 47) and Special Interrogatories 36-37, 39, 44-47, 52-59.
  
            The Court finds that
to the extent Aqua Wetclean has supplemented responses to certain discovery
responses, this motion is moot as to those responses only. To the extent that
Aqua Wetclean has not supplemented responses to Form Interrogatory No. 17.1
(RFAs 37, 42, and 47) and Special Interrogatories 36-37, 39, 44-47, 52-59,
supplemental responses to these discovery requests are warranted because Cuil
LLC has shown they are relevant, reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery
of admissible evidence, and can be protected by Aqua Wetclean providing a
privilege log or submitting a proposed protective order as discussed previously
by the parties. Furthermore, Aqua Wetclean did not make any arguments regarding
other RFAs and other discovery requests, suggesting Aqua Wetclean concedes to
their merits. Finally, Aqua Wetclean in its opposition agreed to provide
supplemental responses to the remaining discovery requests. 
 
            Therefore, the Motion
to Compel Further Responses to Requests for Admission, Form Interrogatories,
Specially Prepared Interrogatories, and Requests for Production of Documents is
GRANTED, with further responses due within thirty (30) days of the date of this
Order. For any privilege and privacy matters, Plaintiff Aqua Wetclean must
provide a privilege log and the parties are ordered to stipulate to and file a
protective order in the format approved by the Court for Confidential Documents
within ten (10) court days of the date of this order.
 
Request for Sanctions
Where
the court grants a motion to compel further responses, sanctions shall be
imposed against the party who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to
compel, unless the party acted with substantial justification or the sanction
would otherwise be unjust. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (d); Code Civ.
Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (c); Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.290, subd. (d).)
 
            Cuil LLC requests monetary sanctions
in the amount of $9,045.00 for (1) 20.1 hours meet and conferring with opposing
counsel and preparing the moving papers; and (2) anticipate 3.0 hours preparing
a reply and preparing for and participating in a hearing on the motion at an
hourly rate of $450.00 per hour. (Sergenian Decl., ¶ 24.) Although a portion of
the motion was rendered moot because Aqua Wetclean supplemented some responses
to the discovery at issue, the supplemental responses were provided months
after the filing of this instant motion. Furthermore, Aqua Wetclean did not
provide evidence that it acted with substantial justification is refusing to
supply the supplemental responses before the filing of this motion. Additionally,
no other circumstances have been raised to suggest imposing the requested
sanctions would be unjust.  
 
Thus,
the request for sanctions is GRANTED the Court will impose sanctions against Plaintiff
Aqua Wetclean and its counsel, jointly and severally, in favor of Defendant
Cuil Investments, LLC. for a total of 6 hours expended on preparing this motion
and supporting documents, reviewing the opposition and supporting documents,
preparing the reply brief, and attending the hearing this motion at an hourly
rate of $450.00 per hour for a total of $2,700.00, payable within twenty (20)
days of the date of this Order. 
 
            Moving Party is ordered to give
notice of this ruling.            
 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed
by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive an email
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off
calendar.
