BACKGROUND
             On May 18, 2023, Plaintiff Tohid Naeem
(“Plaintiff”) filed the operative Complaint against Defendant Nidal A. Barakat
(“Defendant”) for Violations of Tenant Anti-Harassment Ordinance. 
 
            On July 31, 2023, Defendant filed an
Answer. 
            On January 12, 2024, Plaintiff filed
a Motion for Leave to File Second Amended Complaint. No opposition was filed.
On January 31, 2024, this Court continued this matter to allow Plaintiff to
serve Defendant with the Motion and to give Defendant the opportunity to
respond.
 
            On February 7, 2024, Plaintiff filed this instant Motion for Leave to File
Second Amended Complaint. Plaintiff also filed proof of service by first-class
mail.
 
DISCUSSION
            Code of Civil Procedure Section 473
permits the trial court in its discretion to allow amendments to pleadings in
the furtherance of justice. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (a)(1).) Code of Civil
Procedure Section 576 provides that any judge, at any time before or after
commencement of trial, in the furtherance of justice, and upon such terms as
may be proper, may allow the amendment of any pleading or pretrial conference order. (Code Civ. Proc., § 576.) There is a policy of great
liberality in permitting
amendments to the pleadings at any stage of the proceeding. (Berman v. Bromberg (1997) 56 Cal.App.4th 936, 945.) An
application to amend a pleading is addressed to the trial judge’s sound discretion. (Id.) If the
motion to amend is timely made and the granting of the motion will not prejudice the opposing
party, it is error to refuse permission to amend and where the refusal also results in a party being
deprived of the right to assert a meritorious cause of action or a meritorious defense, it is not
only error but an abuse of discretion. (Morgan v. Superior Court of Cal. In and For Los Angeles County (1959) 172 Cal.App.2d 527, 530.) Where no
prejudice is shown to the adverse party, the liberal rule of allowance
prevails. (Higgins v. Del Faro (1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 558, 564.)
 
Under California Rules of Court (“CRC”), Rule
3.1324, a motion for leave to amend a pleading must be accompanied by a
declaration that sets forth: (1) the effect of the amendment; (2) why the
amendment is necessary and proper; (3) when the facts giving rise to the
amended allegations were discovered; and (4) the reasons why the request for
amendment was not made sooner. (CRC, Rule 3.1324, subd. (b).)
 
            The proof of service filed by
Plaintiff indicates that Defendant was served with the January 31, 2024
Tentative Order Re: Motion for Leave to File Second Amended Complaint; Notice
of Motion and Motion for Leave to File Second Amended Complaint; Memorandum of
Points and Authorities in Support of Motion for Leave to File Second Amended
Complaint; Declaration of Tohid Naeem in Support of Motion for Leave to File
Second Amended Complaint; and Proposed Order at 1440 N. Sepulveda Blvd #331,
Van Nuys, CA 91405. However, this is not the address on record for Defendant.
Thus, it appears that Defendant still has not been properly served with
Plaintiff’s Motion for Leave to File Second Amended Complaint and supporting documents.
Due process requires a party to be fully advised of the issues to be addressed
and be given adequate notice of what facts it must rebut in order to prevail.
(Fenn v. Sherriff (2003) 109 Cal.App.4th 1466, 1482.)
 
            Therefore, the Motion for Leave to
File Second Amended Complaint is CONTINUED to April 30, 2024 at 8:30 a.m. to
allow Plaintiff to serve Defendant at 7440 N. Sepulveda Blvd #331, Van Nuys, CA
91405 with the current Motion for Leave to File Second Amended Complaint
and supporting documents, and to give Defendant the opportunity to respond. Plaintiff
is ordered to serve said documents within five court days of the issuance of
this Order.
 
Moving
Party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.            
 
Parties who intend to submit on this tentative
must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed by the
instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive an email
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off
calendar.
 
Dated this 19th day of March 2024
