 Case Number:  22STCV32334    Hearing Date:   December 14, 2023    Dept:  52 Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant
Bosley Properties, LLC’s Motion to Compel Defendant Mertz-Del Amo to Comply
with Agreement to Comply and Produce Documents and to Comply with CCP § 2031.280(a)
Plaintiff/cross-defendant
Bosley Properties, LLC moves to compel defendant Mertz-Del Amo to comply with
its statement of compliance in response to requests for production, set one,
Nos. 1-18, 20-23, 25-27, 30-36, 40, 42-44, 46, 48-50.  “If a party filing a response to a demand for
inspection, copying, testing, or sampling … thereafter fails to permit the
inspection, copying, testing, or sampling in accordance with that party’s
statement of compliance, the demanding party may move for an order compelling
compliance.”  (CCP § 2031.320(a).)
Mertz-Del
Amo responded that it would produce documents but did not produce all
responsive documents in accordance with its statements of compliance.  In response to Bosley Properties, LLC’s
requests for production Nos. 1-18, 20-23, 25-27, 30-36, 40, 42-44, 46, 48-50,
Mertz-Del Amo stated it would comply or comply in part.  (Brown Decl., ¶ 5, Ex. 2.)  On October 31, 2023, Mertz-Del Amo’s counsel
produced some documents.  (Id., ¶
9, Ex. 6.)  He wrote, “I’ll be adding
documents to a Dropbox folder today.  The
first batch is in there now.  …  I’ll follow up with a letter to each of you
with identification with the specific request number to which the documents
respond, pursuant to C.C.P. § 2031.280. 
I will inform all parties when all of the documents are uploaded.”  (Ibid.)  On November 8, 2023, the parties met and
conferred about the production.  (Id.,
¶ 11.)  Mertz-Del Amo’s counsel stated he
had not yet produced all responsive documents and could not specify when he
would produce the remaining documents.  (Id.,
¶ 11, Ex. 8.)  
Mertz-Del
Amo therefore has not fully complied with its statements of compliance in
response to requests for production Nos. 1-18, 20-23, 25-27, 30-36, 40, 42-44,
46, 48-50.  Bosley Properties, LLC shows grounds
for an order compelling Mertz-Del Amo to comply with its responses.
Bosley
Properties, LLC further moves to compel Mertz-Del Amo to comply with Code of
Civil Procedure section 2031.280(a), which provides, “Any documents or category
of documents produced in response to a demand for inspection, copying, testing,
or sampling shall be identified with the specific request number to which the
documents respond.”  Mertz-Del Amo
produced documents but did not identify them by request number.  (Brown Decl., ¶ 9, Ex. 6; ¶¶ 10, 12.)  Bosley Properties, LLC shows good cause to
order Mertz-Del Amo to identify the documents produced with the specific
request numbers to which they respond.  
Sanctions
            Bosley Properties,
LLC moves for $3,084.15 in sanctions against Mertz-Del Amo.  “Failing to respond or to submit to an
authorized method of discovery” is a misuse of the discovery process subject to
monetary sanctions.  (CCP §
2023.010(d).)  Mertz-Del Amo failed to
submit to requests for production, an authorized method of discovery.  Sanctions are appropriate.  Bosley Properties, LLC reasonably incurred
$3,084.15 in expenses for 9.3 hours of attorney fees at $325 per hour plus the
$61.65 filing fee.  
Disposition
Plaintiff/cross-defendant
Bosley Properties, LLC’s motion to compel defendant Mertz-Del Amo to comply
with its statements of compliance in response to requests for production is granted.  
Defendant
Mertz-Del Amo is ordered to produce all documents responsive to requests
for production Nos. 1-18, 20-23, 25-27, 30-36, 40, 42-44, 46, 48-50 in
accordance with its statements of compliance within 30 days.  Defendant Mertz-Del Amo is ordered to
identify all documents produced, including those previously produced, with the
specific request numbers to which they respond within 30 days.  Defendant Mertz-Del Amo is ordered to
pay plaintiff/cross-defendant Bosley Properties, LLC $3,084.15 in sanctions within
30 days.
