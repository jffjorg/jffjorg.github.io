And here is the English text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling is that the plaintiffs' motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories Nos. 45-48 and requests for production Nos. 45 and 46 is denied. The judge finds that the defendant, FCA US LLC, made valid objections to these requests and that they are not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. The judge also finds that the requests are not proportional to the needs of the case and are unduly burdensome. The judge notes that the primary focus of the Song-Beverly Action is whether the plaintiffs' vehicle suffered from defects that substantially impaired its value, and that the requests seek documents about the entire line of vehicles, which is too far removed from the issues in the action. The judge also finds that the defendant's process in attempting to repair the subject vehicle and deciding not to repurchase it was reasonable and in good faith.
