And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Nextwave Enterprises LLC's application for an order to sell Youngran Cho's dwelling located at 14127 Avenida Espana, La Mirada, CA 90638. The judgment creditor has not shown proof of serving sufficient notice on the judgment debtor, Youngran Cho. The court has found that the proof of service filed by the judgment creditor states that the party served was a male, but the judgment debtor is actually a female, as evidenced by the title to the property. Additionally, the judgment creditor served the papers by mail on November 14, 2023, which was untimely, as the period of notice was extended by five days only if the place of address is within the State of California.
