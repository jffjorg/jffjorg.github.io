  Case Number:  19STCP02468    Hearing Date:   December 14, 2023    Dept:  52 Order to
Show Cause Re: Sale of Dwelling Located at 14127 Avenida Espana, La Mirada, CA
90638
Judgment creditor
Nextwave Enterprises LLC applies for an order for sale of judgment debtor
Youngran Cho’s dwelling under Code of Civil Procedure section 704.750.  
Judgment creditor has
not shown proof of serving sufficient notice on judgment debtor Youngran Cho.  Code of Civil Procedure section 704.770,
subdivision (b) provides: “Not later than 30 days before the time set for
hearing, the judgment creditor shall do both of the following: [¶] (1) Serve on
the judgment debtor a copy of the order to show cause, a copy of the
application of the judgment creditor, and a copy of the notice of the hearing
in the form prescribed by the Judicial Council.  Service shall be made personally or by mail.  [¶] (2) Personally serve a copy of each
document listed in paragraph (1) on an occupant of the dwelling or, if there is
no occupant present at the time service is attempted, post a copy of each
document in a conspicuous place at the dwelling.”  For service by mail, the “period of notice …
is extended: (1) Five days if the place of address is within the State of
California.”  (CCP § 684.120(b)(1).)
Judgment creditor
filed proof of purported personal service on judgment debtor Youngran Cho on
November 14, 2023.  (POS filed 11/29/23.)  November 14 was exactly 30 days before this
hearing on December 14, 2023.  The proof
of service states the party served was “Youngran Cho, an individual,” with
“physical description” including “Sex: Male.” 
(Ibid.)  Judgment
creditor’s application, however, provides evidence Youngran Cho is female.  Title to the property is vested in “Youngran
Cho, a single woman.”  (Bronstein Decl.,
¶ 8, Ex. 4.)  Delivery to a male occupant
at the subject address therefore does not establish valid personal service on
judgment debtor Youngran Cho.  This service
would only support substituted service—which would be “deemed complete on the
10th day after mailing” (CCP § 415.20(a)), and therefore was less than 30 days before
this hearing.  
Judgment creditor
also served the papers on Youngran Cho by mail on November 14, 2023.  But serving the papers by mail extended the
period of required notice by five days. 
(CCP § 684.120(b)(1).)  Service by
mail on November 14 was therefore untimely.
