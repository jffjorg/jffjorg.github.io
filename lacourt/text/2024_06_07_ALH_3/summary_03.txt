And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling is regarding an application for default judgment by Zee Management Corporation against Peisheng Tong aka Peusheng Tong. The plaintiff seeks a default judgment in the amount of $407,179.50, consisting of $308,602.10 demanded in the complaint, $93,087.92 in interest, $513.46 in costs, and $4,976.02 in attorneys' fees. However, the court finds that the plaintiff's application is deficient because it does not provide the basis for recovering the attorneys' fees. The court is willing to grant a judgment of $402,203.48, which does not include the plaintiff's calculated attorney fees. The court continues the hearing to August 6, 2024, and orders the plaintiff to submit a revised proposed judgment or an explanation justifying the award of attorney fees.
