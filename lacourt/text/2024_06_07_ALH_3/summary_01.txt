As a result, the court sets a default prove-up hearing for August 7, 2024 at 8:30 a.m. The court requires revised and additional forms to be submitted no later than 5 court days before the hearing. The judge also reminds parties who intend to submit on the tentative to send an email to the court indicating their intention to submit.
