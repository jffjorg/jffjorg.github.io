I.      INTRODUCTION

          On
October 24, 2023, plaintiff Francisco Teletor Sente filed this action against
Anthony Felix (“Felix”) as well as Diana Griego (“Griego”), individually and as
trustee for the Diana Griego Trust. 
          On
January 31, 2024, Plaintiff filed the operative First Amended Complaint (“FAC”).

          On
February 27, 2024, Felix and Griego (collectively, “Defendants”) filed this
demurrer. Defendants also filed a request for judicial notice. 
          Plaintiff
filed an opposition brief on May 24, 2042. 
          Defendants
filed a reply brief on May 31, 2024. 
II.     LEGAL
STANDARD
A demurrer tests the legal sufficiency
of the pleadings and will be sustained only where the pleading is defective on
its face. (City of Atascadero v.
Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc. (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 445,
459.) “We treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded
but not contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law. We accept the
factual allegations of the complaint as true and also consider matters which
may be judicially noticed. [Citation.]” (Mitchell
v. California Department of Public Health (2016) 1 Cal.App.5th 1000, 1007; Del E. Webb Corp. v. Structural Materials
Co. (1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 593, 604 [“the facts alleged in the pleading are
deemed to be true, however improbable they may be”].) Allegations are to be
liberally construed. (Code Civ. Proc., § 452.) In construing the allegations,
the court is to give effect to specific factual allegations that may modify or
limit inconsistent general or conclusory allegations. (Financial Corporation of America v. Wilburn (1987) 189 Cal.App.3rd
764, 769.) 
III.    REQUEST
FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE
         Defendants
request the Court take judicial notice of Plaintiff’s workers’ compensation
claim filed on March 30, 2022, which lists Defendants as his employers and
identifies an injury sustained on November 11, 2021. The Court takes judicial
notice of the existence of this claim but not for the truth of any matters
stated within it. 
          Defendants
also request the Court take judicial notice of a letter from Defendants’
insurance carrier which accepted Plaintiff’s workers’ compensation claim. The
request for judicial notice is DENIED with respect to the letter from a claims
administrator from The Travelers Indemnity Company because it does not fall
into any of the categories listed in Evidence Code section 452. 
IV.    DISCUSSION
A.  
Demurrer
Defendants demur to the FAC in its
entirety on the grounds that Plaintiff’s action is barred by the exclusive
remedy of workers compensation. The Court agrees. 
Compensation under the Workers
Compensation Act is an employee’s exclusive remedy against an employer for
injuries sustained out of and in the course of employment. (See Cal.
Const., art. XIV, section 4; Labor Code, §§ 3201, 3600, subd. (a), 3602, subd.
(a); Charles J. Vacanti, M.D., Inc. v. State Compensation Insurance Fund
(2001) 24 Cal.4th 800, 810.) Labor Code section¿3706 allows an injured employee to
bring an action for damages if the employer "fails to secure the payment
of compensation". (Lab. Code, § 3706.) “In a statutory action under section
3706, it is the 'plaintiff's obligation to plead and prove violation of section
3700 by [the defendant employer's] failure to carry workers' compensation
insurance.”' (Campos Food Fair v. Superior Court (1987) 193 Cal.App.3d
965, 968.) 
Here, Plaintiff alleges that he was hired by Defendants to perform
remodeling work on Defendants’ premises (“Premises”) and became injured while
using an electrical table saw to cut wood. (FAC, ¶¶ 12-14.) Plaintiff does not allege
that Defendants failed to secure workers compensation insurance. To the
contrary, Plaintiff only alleges in the FAC that Rene Cardona (“Cardona”), an
unlicensed contractor (who was not included as a defendant in the initial
complaint and has not been added as a Doe) did not have insurance. (Id.,
¶¶ 23, 26.) 
Although
Plaintiff argues that his claims against Defendants fall outside the scope of
the WCA because he was only employed by Cardona, this argument fails because
Plaintiff alleges that neither he nor Cardona held licenses and that Defendants
hired them to perform home improvement work which required a license.
Therefore, Defendants are Plaintiff’s statutory employers according to Labor
Code section 2750.5. (See Zellers v. Playa Pacifica, Ltd. (1998) 61
Cal.App.4th 129, 132.)
Accordingly,
Defendants’ demurrer to the entire FAC is SUSTAINED. 
B.  
Leave
to Amend
Leave to amend must be allowed where
there is a reasonable possibility of successful amendment. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335,
348.) The burden is on the complainant to show the Court that a pleading can be
amended successfully. (Ibid.) Plaintiff
seeks leave to amend but does not show how amendment is possible. The Court observes that Plaintiff previously
alleged in his initial complaint that Defendants did not carry workers’
compensation but omitted this allegation from the FAC. (See Compl., ¶ 15.) Also,
based on the judicially noticeable workers’ compensation claim that Plaintiff
filed, it is unclear how he can truthfully amend the complaint to state that
Defendants did not have workers’ compensation insurance.  
V.     CONCLUSION
Defendants’ demurrer is SUSTAINED
without leave to amend. 
 
Moving party to give notice.
