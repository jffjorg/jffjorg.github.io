Plaintiff Zee Management Corporation
seeks a default judgment against defendant Peisheng Tong aka Peusheng Tong
(“Defendant”) in the amount of $407,179.50, consisting of $308,602.10 as
demanded in the complaint, $93,087.92 in interest, $513.46 in costs, and
$4,976.02 in attorneys’ fees. 
Plaintiff’s application is deficient
because it does not provide the basis for recovering $4,976.02 in attorney fees.
Paragraph 36 of the lease allows for reasonable attorney fees and costs,
collectively not to exceed $1,000. Also, a party who does not attempt to
mediate a dispute before resorting to court action is not entitled to recovery
attorney fees. (Lease, ¶ 35A.) The Court is willing to grant a judgment of $402,203.48,
which does not include Plaintiff’s calculated attorney fees. If this is
acceptable, Plaintiff is ordered to submit a revised proposed judgment on Form
JUD-100. Otherwise, Plaintiff is ordered to submit an explanation justifying
the award of attorney fees. 
The Court CONTINUES the hearing to
August 6, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. 
All revised/additional papers must be
submitted no later than 5 court days before the hearing. 
 
Dated
this 7th
day of June, 2024
