And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The tentative ruling is related to an application for default judgment filed by Plaintiff Energy Sanrio Investment LLC against Defendants A1 Ent Inc. and K Music Entertainment Inc. The Plaintiff had previously been ordered to submit a computation of interest and a revised proposed judgment, which it did on May 23, 2024. However, the revised proposed judgment remains deficient because it does not specify the amount in costs that each defendant is responsible for. As a result, the hearing is continued to August 5, 2024, and the Plaintiff must submit a new proposed judgment no later than 5 court days before the hearing date.
