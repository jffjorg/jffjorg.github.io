And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling is a summary of the Judge's thinking based on the information presented before the Court. The case is a breach of contract case where the Plaintiff, Progressive Real Estate Partners L.P., alleges that the Defendants, Robert H Ko and Celda Inc., failed to pay them a commission of $85,647.27 for procuring tenants. The Plaintiff filed a suit for breach of contract, open book account, and account stated. The Defendants did not pay the commission, and default was entered against them. The Plaintiff then filed a default judgment application. The Judge finds that the only defect is that the Plaintiff seeks to hold the individual Defendant Ko personally liable. The Judge rules that directors, managers, and/or officers are not personally liable on contracts signed by them for and on behalf of the corporation unless they purport to bind themselves individually. The Judge finds that Ko signed the agreements in the scope of his employment for and on behalf of the corporation, and not as a contracting party. The Judge grants the request for entry of default judgment if the Plaintiff dismisses Ko from the request and files an amended/revised JUD-100 form. If the Plaintiff does not dismiss Ko, the application is denied without prejudice.
