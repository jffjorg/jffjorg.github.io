And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Premier Financial Services, LLC v. Steinberg. Steinberg, the defendant, has filed a motion to set aside the default judgment entered against him on September 16, 2024, and to quash the service of the summons due to lack of jurisdiction. Steinberg claims that he did not receive actual notice of the lawsuit and that the service of the summons was defective. The judge has granted Steinberg's motion to set aside the default judgment, finding that he did not receive actual notice and that the court should liberally grant relief to resolve disputes on the merits rather than through technical default. The judge has denied Steinberg's motion to quash the service of the summons, finding that there is no basis for the court to conclude that it lacks jurisdiction. Steinberg is ordered to file an answer to the complaint within five court days.
