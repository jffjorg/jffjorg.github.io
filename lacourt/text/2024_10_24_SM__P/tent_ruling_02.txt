Premier Financial Services, LLC v. Steinberg,
Case no. 24SMCV02775
Hearing date October 24, 2024
Defendant’s
Motion to Set Aside Default
Plaintiff
sues for breach of vehicle lease agreement, account stated and unjust
enrichment. Default was entered 9/16/2024. Defendant in pro per moves to
set aside and for an order quashing service for lack of jurisdiction. The
motion is unopposed. 
Under
Cal. Code of Civ. Proc. §473(b), the court may set aside a dismissal taken
against a party through “mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable
neglect.” Relief under §473 should be liberally granted because public policy
favors resolution of disputes on the merits, rather than through technical
default. E.g., Fasuvi v. Permatex, Inc. (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th
681, 685. When service of a summons has not resulted in actual notice to a
party in time to defend the action and a default or default judgment has been
entered against him or her in the action, the party may serve and file a notice
of motion to set aside the default or default judgment and for leave to defend
the action. Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §473.5(a).
Defendant
moves under Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §473.5 to set aside the 9/16/2024 default,
arguing he did not receive actual notice. Personal service allegedly occurred
8/11/2023 at 3:30 PM at 3455 Grand View Blvd, Los Angeles, CA 90066. MTSA 5:12,
ex. B. Defendant asserts he was not present at time of service and argues the
description could describe the property owner, gardener and other men in the
neighborhood. MTSA 5:12-17.
Defendant
further asserts he was unaware of the lawsuit until he received notice via mail
of the default entered against him. MTSA 6:12-14. Defendant seeks relief under
Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §473.5(a) and included a proposed responsive pleading (an answer).
MTSA ex. A. California has a public policy of resolving issues on their merits.
Further, given that plaintiff does not oppose the motion, setting aside the
9/16/2024 default is appropriate. 
Defendant
moves under Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §418.10(a)(1) to quash service of the summons
due to lack of jurisdiction but provides no facts or allegations supporting
this motion. Thus, there is no basis for the court to conclude that the court
lacks jurisdiction. 
The
motion to set aside the default is GRANTED. The motion for an order quashing
service of summons for lack of jurisdiction is DENIED. Defendant to separately
file the answer within 5 court days.
