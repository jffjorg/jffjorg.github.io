And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case between Slalom, Inc. (plaintiff) and Aspiration Partners, Inc. (dba Catona) (defendant). The case concerns a breach of written contract, work, labor, services, and materials, and account stated, with the defendant failing to pay for consulting services totaling $2,617,224.85 plus interest. The defendant has moved to compel arbitration based on the Master Services Agreement (MSA), which the plaintiff stipulated to but sought a writ of attachment. The judge granted the writ of attachment contingent on the plaintiff posting a $10,000 undertaking and granted the defendant's motion to compel arbitration.

After oral argument, the court ordered limited supplemental briefs regarding the defendant's decreasing solvency, and the parties submitted additional evidence. The defendant objects to the plaintiff's supplemental declaration and request for judicial notice, arguing it did not have an opportunity to respond to the new evidence. The judge has overruled the defendant's objections and will continue the matter to allow the defendant to briefly address the new evidence, limited to five pages.
