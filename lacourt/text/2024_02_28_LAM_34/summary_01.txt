And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of 21STCV37275, which concerns a motion to quash deposition subpoenas for production of business records, a motion for a protection order, and a request for monetary sanctions. The Plaintiff, Kristien Amer, has moved to quash the deposition subpoenas and protect her privacy, arguing that the subpoenas are overly broad and infringe on her privacy. The Defendant, LA Valley Management, LLC, opposes the motion, arguing that the subpoenas are necessary to discover relevant information and that Plaintiff has waived her right to privacy by placing her medical conditions and injuries at issue in the pleadings and discovery.

The Judge has granted in part the motion to quash deposition subpoenas, finding that the subpoenas are overly broad and do not meet the compelling interest standard. The Judge has also declined to award sanctions to either party, finding that the motion was not made or opposed in bad faith. The Court has quashed the deposition subpoenas and has declined to issue a protective order.
