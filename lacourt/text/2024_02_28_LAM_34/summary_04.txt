Summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the Demurrer is sustained, without leave to amend, and the Complaint is dismissed with prejudice. The Judge found that the notice to vacate is fatally defective, and therefore, the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over the matter. The Judge also found that the Complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action and that the Plaintiff lacks capacity to sue.
