ANALYSIS:
 
I.         
Legal
Standard
 
“If a subpoena
requires the attendance of a witness or the production of books, documents,
electronically stored information, or other things before a court, or at the
trial of an issue therein, or at the taking of a deposition, the court, upon
motion reasonably made by any person described in subdivision (b), or upon the
court’s own motion after giving counsel notice and an opportunity to be heard,
may make an order quashing the subpoena entirely, modifying it, or directing
compliance with it upon those terms or conditions as the court shall declare,
including protective orders. In addition, the court may make any other order as
may be appropriate to protect the person from unreasonable or oppressive
demands, including unreasonable violations of the right of privacy of the person.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1987.1, subd. (a).)
 
“Before, during, or after a deposition, any party, any deponent, or any
other affected natural person or organization may promptly move for a
protective order. The motion shall be accompanied by a meet and confer
declaration under Section 2016.040.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.420, subd. (a).)
 
“The court, for good cause shown, may make any order that justice
requires to protect any party, deponent, or other natural person or
organization from unwarranted annoyance, embarrassment, or oppression, or undue
burden and expense.” (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2025.420, subd. (b).)
 
Courts have considerable discretion in granting and crafting protective
orders. (Raymond Handling Concepts Corp.
v. Super. Ct. (1995) 39 Cal.App.4th 584, 588.)

(Motion, Exh. A.)
 
B. 
    The
Parties’ Arguments
 
Plaintiff moves the Court to quash each of these eleven deposition
subpoenas and to issue a protective order as to the documents requested.
(Motion, pp. 2–4.) Plaintiff argues that Plaintiff has always offered to
provide medical records related to treatment sought between December 2019 and 2023,
including test results and diagnoses, as well as other relevant medical
records, but that these are unreasonable and oppressive demands for documents
that are unrelated and irrelevant to Plaintiff’s claim. (Id. at pp.
2:25–3:15.) Plaintiff also argues that Plaintiff’s Counsel was not legally
served. (Id. at p. 3:8–9.)
 
Defendant opposes the Motion, arguing: (1) that Defendant made efforts
to meet and confer; (2) that the deposition subpoenas were properly served; (3)
that the deposition subpoenas seek information relevant to the subject matter
of this action and are reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of
admissible evidence; (4) that Plaintiff waived any right to privacy by placing
her medical conditions and injuries at issue in the pleadings and discovery;
and (5) that even if waiver did not apply, Plaintiff has not shown she has a
reasonable expectation of privacy in this litigation or that these deposition
subpoenas constituted a serious invasion of privacy. (Opposition, pp. 4:4,
4:18, 5:5–7, 6:21–23, 7:21–24, 8:17–18, 9:4–7.)
 
C. 
    Discussion
 
The California Constitution includes the
inalienable right to privacy. (Cal. Const., Art. I, § 1.)
 
“The party asserting
a privacy right must establish a legally protected privacy interest, an
objectively reasonable expectation of privacy in the given circumstances, and a
threatened intrusion that is serious. The party seeking information may raise
in response whatever legitimate and important countervailing interests disclosure serves, while the party seeking
protection may identify feasible alternative that serve the same interests or
protective measures that would diminish the loss of privacy. A court must then
balance these competing considerations.” (Williams v. Super. Ct. (2017)
3 Cal.5th 531, 552, citing Hill v. Nat’l Collegiate Athletic Ass’n (1994) 7 Cal.4th 1, 35.)
 
The balancing
test outlined in Hill applies whenever lesser privacy interests are at stake.
(Id. at 556.) The Court only applies the higher “compelling interest”
standard to justify “an obvious invasion of an interest fundamental to personal
autonomy.” (Id.)
 
A party must meet the compelling interest standard to discover an
opposing party’s medical information. (Davis v. Super. Ct. (1992) 7
Cal.App.4th 1008, 1015, 1020.) 
 
Here, the compelling interest standard applies because Plaintiff has a fundamental
interest to personal autonomy concerning her medical records. Further, these
deposition subpoenas are not narrowly tailored in any sense of that phrase.
Rather, the deposition subpoenas are overbroad, both in the materials requested
and the applicable period of time. Because these subpoenas appear to be
unlimited in scope, it would be hard for a medical provider to determine what
should (and, importantly, what should not) be provided in response to the
subpoenas. Finally, the phrase “relating to” tends to be overbroad and leads to
the possibility that irrelevant records (including the records of other individuals)
could be wrongfully disclosed. 
 
The Court finds that Defendant has not met the compelling interest
standard here. Defendant has not sufficiently explained to the Court why a
narrower invasion of privacy would be insufficient to meet Defendant’s
discovery needs. 
 
On the other hand, Plaintiff has not provided the Court with the language
of a proposed protective order. The Court declines to enter one, particularly
because a narrower set of deposition subpoenas might be appropriate here. 
 
        The Court GRANTS in part Plaintiff’s
Motion. 
 
        The Court QUASHES the deposition
subpoenas. 
 
D. 
    Sanctions
 
1. 
    Legal
Standard
 
“Except as specified in subdivision
(c), in making an order pursuant to motion made under subdivision (c) of
Section 1987 or under Section 1987.1, the court may in its discretion award the
amount of the reasonable expenses incurred in making or opposing the motion,
including reasonable attorney’s fees, if the court finds the motion was made or
opposed in bad faith or without substantial justification or that one or more
of the requirements of the subpoena was oppressive.” (Code Civ. Proc., §¿1987.2, subd. (a).)
 
2. 
    Discussion

 
Plaintiff and Defendant both request sanctions. 
 
Plaintiff appears to request $2,500.00 in monetary sanctions for the
Motion, although the request is not included in the body of the Motion and
Plaintiff’s Counsel’s declaration lacks any supporting details. (Motion, p.
1:19.)
 
Defendant requests $950.00 in monetary sanctions, which is based on an
estimated five hours of work at $190.00 per hour. (Opposition, p. 11:2–3 and
Decl. Hagle, ¶ 10.)
 
The Court declines to award sanctions.
 
 
III.     Conclusion
 
The Motion is GRANTED in part.  The deposition subpoenas are QUASHED.  The Court DECLINES to award sanctions.
