ANALYSIS
 
The Request for Judicial Notice is DENIED.  Counsel has been a licensed attorney since
2002 and should know that he can simply cite to a published opinion of the California
Court of Appeal; judicial notice of the opinion is not necessary.  Further, the Request for Judicial Notice states
that the jump cite is at p. 32.  (See Request
for Judicial Notice, p. 2:6.)  However,
there is no page 32 of the case, whose citation is 39 Cal.App.5th 634. 
 
        The Request for Default Judgment is
GRANTED. 
 
Default Judgment is AWARDED in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant
in the total amount of $9,074.00. 
 
        Defendant is ENJOINED to, within six
months of the issuance of this Order: (1) take steps necessary to make its
website “www.ohmycrab.com” conform to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
(WCAG) 2.0 success criteria AA, promulgated by the WorldWide Web Consortium;
and (2) change its corporate policies, practices, and procedures to provide for
regular maintenance of “www.ohmycrab.com” so that it remains in conformance
with WCAG 2.0 success criteria AA.
