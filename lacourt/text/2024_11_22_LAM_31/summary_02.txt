And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on three motions: Plaintiff's Motion to Vacate the grant of Derulo and Atlantic's Motion to Dismiss, Future History's Motion to Dismiss Pursuant to Code Civ. Proc. ยง 410.30, and Future History's Demurrer to the First Amended Complaint.

The court denies Plaintiff's Motion to Vacate, finding that the forum selection clause was properly enforced and that Plaintiff's counsel's ignorance of New York law does not constitute excusable neglect.

The court grants Future History's Motion to Dismiss, finding that the forum selection clause is mandatory and inclusive of Plaintiff's claims, and that the enforcement of the clause would not result in the diminution of Plaintiff's employment rights or a waiver of a claim.

The court finds that Plaintiff's claims of sexual harassment and retaliation are not viable, as Plaintiff has not established the existence of an employment relationship with Derulo and Future History.

The court also finds that Plaintiff's reliance on the Hoffman case is misplaced, as it involves claims under the NYCHRL and New York Human Rights Law, which Plaintiff did not assert.

The court's ruling is based on California Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) sections 473(b) and 410.30, as well as New York City and State human rights laws.
