The judge, Kerry Bensinger, has granted a motion filed by Jeffrey D. Nadel, Esq., to be relieved as counsel for plaintiff Jesus Islas Sanchez. The motion was unopposed by the defendant, Fidel Romano.

The judge noted that there has been a breakdown in the relationship between the attorney and client, resulting in a lack of trust, communication, and agreement on strategy. The court set a status conference for January 10, 2025, to discuss counsel for the plaintiff. The order is effective upon the filing of proof of service of the signed order upon the plaintiff.
