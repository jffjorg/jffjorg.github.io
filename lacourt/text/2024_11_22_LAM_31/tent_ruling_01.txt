MOTION
TO BE RELIEVED AS COUNSEL 



 
MOVING PARTY:               Jeffrey
D. Nadel, Esq.
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     No opposition 
 
 
I.          INTRODUCTION
 
            On September 25, 2024, Jeffrey D. Nadel, counsel for plaintiff
Jesus Islas Sanchez (Plaintiff), filed this Motion to be Relieved as Counsel.
 
            The motion
is unopposed.
                         
II.        LEGAL STANDARD
 
California Rules of Court, rule
3.1362 (Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel) requires (1) notice of motion and
motion to be directed to the client (made on the Notice of Motion and Motion to
be Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-051)); (2) a declaration stating in
general terms and without compromising the confidentiality of the
attorney-client relationship why a motion under Code of Civil Procedure section
284(2) is brought instead of filing a consent under Code of Civil Procedure
section 284(1) (made on the Declaration in Support of Attorney's Motion to Be
Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-052)); (3) service of the notice of motion
and motion and declaration on all other parties who have appeared in the case;
and (4) the proposed order relieving counsel (prepared on the Order Granting
Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-053)).¿ 
 
The court has discretion to allow
an attorney to withdraw, and such a motion should be granted provided that
there is no prejudice to the client, and it does not disrupt the orderly
process of justice.  (See Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21
Cal.App.4th 904, 915.)¿
            
III.      DISCUSSION
Jeffrey D. Nadel seeks to be relieved as counsel of record
for Plaintiff for the following reason: “There has been a breakdown of trust,
communication, agreement on strategy and elements of the written retainer
agreement has not been honored due to a series of actions and non-actions
between the attorney and client over the past couple months.  Efforts to resolve this situation by the use
of a Substitution of Attorney has not been forthcoming.”  (Form
MC-052.)    
 
Absent a showing of resulting prejudice, an attorney’s
request for withdrawal should be granted.  (People v. Prince (1968)
268 Cal.App.2d 398, 406.) 
 
Upon review, the court finds the Motion complies with
California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362.   
 
IV.       CONCLUSION 
 
            The
unopposed motion is granted and effective upon the filing of the proof of
service of this signed order upon Plaintiff.¿ 
 
            The court
sets a Status Conference re: Counsel for Plaintiff for January 10, 2025 at 9:00
AM.
 
Counsel to give notice to all parties. 
 
 
Dated:   November 22,
2024
