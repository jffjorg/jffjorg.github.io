And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving Gibson as the plaintiff and Moving Defendants as the defendants. The defendants have filed a motion to dismiss the action, which the plaintiff has opposed. The judge has found that the plaintiff's opposition is not relevant to the motion to dismiss, as it only addresses the demurrer and the consideration of extrinsic material. The judge has also found that the defendants' motion is timely, despite the plaintiff's argument that it should be denied because the defendants have made a general appearance in the action. The judge has cited California Code of Civil Procedure section 410.30 and a 2006 case, Morris v. AGFA Corp., in support of this ruling.
