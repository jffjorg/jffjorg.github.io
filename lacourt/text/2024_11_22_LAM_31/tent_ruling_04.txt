            This is a wrongful death action arising from alleged

Dickson worked in the construction industry. 
In that time, Mr. Dickson worked with a product called Hardie board in

Dickson was diagnosed with silicosis and died from this disease a month

spouse, Plaintiff April Dickson.  
 
Plaintiff April Dickson (hereafter, “Plaintiff”) commenced
this action on October 10, 2023 and filed the operative First Amended Complaint
(FAC) on March 15, 2024.  As alleged,
JHBP is incorporated in the state of Delaware and has its principal place of
business in Illinois.
 
On March 26, 2024, Plaintiff filed a Proof of Service of
