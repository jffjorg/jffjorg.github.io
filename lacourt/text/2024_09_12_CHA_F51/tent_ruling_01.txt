(Compl. ¶ 4.) Plaintiff alleges  that on 1/12/23, Defendants “breached the contract by failing to finish the  customization of the subject automobile, such that Plaintiff finally had to  have the motor vehicle towed from their SHOP and remove same from Defendants’  further possession and control.” (Id. at ¶ 7.)   On 8/24/23, Plaintiff filed the  instant action against Defendants, alleging the following causes of action: (1)  Breach of Written Contract; (2) Open Book Account; (3) Conversion; (4) Fraud;  and (5) Money Had and Received. On 1/25/24, the Court entered default against  Defendants. On 1/29/24, the Court entered a default judgment against Defendants  in the amount of $106,539.59.     On 3/4/24, Plaintiff served the subject discovery requests  on Defendant. (Decl. of Lawrence A. Strid ¶ 3.) On 5/16/24, Plaintiff filed the  instant motions to compel Defendant’s responses thereto. No oppositions have  been filed to date.   ANALYSIS   To aid in enforcement of a money  judgment, a judgment creditor may demand that the judgment debtor produce  documents for inspection and copying that are in the debtor’s possession,  custody, or control. (Code Civ. Proc. §  708.030.) The judgment creditor may move for an order compelling a response to  a request for production of documents if the judgment debtor fails to serve a  timely response within 30 days. (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 2031.300, subd. (b);  2031.260, subd. (a).) Furthermore, the judgment debtor who fails to serve a  timely response “waives any objection to the demand, including one based on  privilege or on the protection for work product” unless the Court grants it  relief upon motion. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.300, subd. (a).)   A judgment creditor may propound  written interrogatories to the judgment debtor in the manner provided by Code  of Civil Procedure sections 2030.010 through 2030.410, requesting information  to aid in enforcement of a money judgment. (Code Civ. Proc § 708.020.) A judgment  creditor may move for an order compelling a response to interrogatories if the judgment  debtor fails to serve a timely response within 30 days. (Code Civ. Proc. §§  2030.290, subd. (b); 2030.260, subd. (a).) Furthermore, the judgment debtor who  fails to serve a timely response “waives any right to exercise the option to  produce writings under Section 2030.230, as well as any objection to the  interrogatories, including one based on privilege or on the protection for work  product” unless the Court grants it relief upon motion. (Code Civ. Proc. §  2030.290, subd. (a).)   Here, as Plaintiff served the  subject discovery requests on Defendant by mail on 3/4/24, the last day for Defendant  to respond was 4/8/24. (Code Civ. Proc. §  1013, subd. (a).) Despite being granted an extension to respond, Defendant has  not provided responses to Plaintiff’s discovery requests to date. (Strid Decl. ¶¶ 3–9.) The Court notes that Defendant  has failed to oppose the instant motions. Accordingly, the Court grants the  instant unopposed motions to compel Defendant to provide responses to the  subject discovery requests.   Sanctions    “The court shall impose a monetary  sanction … against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or  opposes a motion to compel a response to a demand for inspection, copying,  testing, or sampling, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction  acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the  imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.300, subd. (c).)   “The court shall impose a monetary  sanction … against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or  opposes a motion to compel a response to interrogatories, unless it finds that  the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that  other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ.  Proc. § 2030.290, subd. (c).)   Here, Plaintiff requests $2,000.00  in monetary sanctions against Defendant. This amount includes (1) 1.5 hours of Plaintiff’s  attorney’s time spent preparing each motion; and (2) an anticipated 1 hour appearing  at each of the hearings, at counsel’s hourly rate of $400.00 per hour. (Strid  Decl. ¶ 10.) While  the Court grants the instant unopposed motions, it notes that discussions  regarding the subject discovery responses were directed to Defendant’s former  attorney, who recently withdrew from representing Defendant. Accordingly, the  Court finds it reasonable to impose $200.00 in monetary sanctions against  Defendant.   CONCLUSION    The unopposed motions are granted. Defendant  is ordered to provide objection-free responses to Plaintiff’s first set of  discovery requests within 30 days. The Court imposes sanctions against Defendant  in the amount of $200.00.
