**English-text Summary:**

The court has issued a tentative ruling in a contract action between Ivan Ho (Plaintiff/Judgment Creditor) and Krikor Barsoumian (Defendant/Judgment Debtor). The Plaintiff alleges that the Defendant breached a contract to customize a motor vehicle and seeks to compel the Defendant's responses to discovery requests, including Requests for Production of Documents and Special Interrogatories. The Plaintiff also requests monetary sanctions against the Defendant in the amount of $2,000.00.

The court has granted the Plaintiff's unopposed motions, ordering the Defendant to provide objection-free responses to the discovery requests within 30 days. The court has also imposed sanctions against the Defendant in the amount of $200.00, finding that the Defendant acted without substantial justification in failing to respond to the discovery requests. The sanctions are intended to encourage compliance with discovery requests and to deter similar behavior in the future.
