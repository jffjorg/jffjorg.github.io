And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has granted the unopposed motions to compel further discovery responses. The Defendant, Zoya Vladimirskaya, is ordered to provide further responses to the discovery requests within 30 days. The Court has also imposed $860.00 in monetary sanctions against the Defendant, payable within 45 days.

The dispute centers around the Defendant's inadequate responses to the discovery requests, including requests for production of documents and form interrogatories. The Plaintiff, Natalie Davidson, argues that the Defendant's responses are evasive and incomplete, and that she has failed to conduct a diligent search for the requested documents.

The Court finds that the Defendant's responses to the discovery requests are inadequate and that she has not opposed the motions to compel further discovery responses. The Court has therefore granted the Plaintiff's motions and ordered the Defendant to provide further responses to the discovery requests.

Additionally, the Court has imposed monetary sanctions against the Defendant, finding that she has engaged in the misuse of the discovery process and that her conduct is unjustified.
