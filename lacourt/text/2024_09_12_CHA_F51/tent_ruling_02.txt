BACKGROUND
 
This
action concerns a business dispute between Plaintiff and Defendant, who are
equal sole shareholders, directors, and officers of nominal defendant Cardea
Hospice & Palliative Care (“Cardea”). (Compl. ¶¶ 7–9.) Plaintiff alleges
that on 2/7/23, Defendant tendered her resignation as an officer of Cardea and
offered to sell her shares. (Id. at ¶ 10.) Plaintiff further alleges
that Defendant, inter alia, wrongfully converted corporate funds to herself and
others, attempted to evict Cardea from its rental unit, and demanded that the
business be shut down. (Id. at ¶ 12.)
 
On
5/31/23, Plaintiff filed her complaint, individually and on behalf of Cardea,
alleging against Defendants the following causes of action: (1) Breach of
Fiduciary Duty (against Defendant); (2) Conversion (against Defendant); (3)
Money Had and Received (against Defendant); (4) Declaratory Relief (against all
defendants); and (5) Removal Pursual to Corporations Code § 304 (against all
defendants). On 9/14/23, Defendants filed their answer. 
 
 
 
On
8/23/23, Plaintiff served the subject discovery requests on Defendant. On
2/5/24, Defendant served her responses thereto.
 
On 3/7/24, Defendant filed the
instant motions to compel Plaintiff’s further responses to the subject
discovery requests. No oppositions have been filed to date.
 
ANALYSIS
 
A.   
Meet and Confer 
 
A motion to compel further
discovery responses must be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration stating “facts showing a reasonable and good faith attempt at an
informal resolution of each issue presented by the motion.” (Code Civ. Proc. §§
2030.300, subd. (b)(1); 2031.310, subd. (b)(2); 2016.040.) 
 
Here, Plaintiff’s counsel declares
that on 2/5/24, he sent Defendant’s counsel a meet and confer letter discussing
the issues raised in the instant motions, but the parties were unable to informally
resolve the issues. (Decl. of Paul Tokar ¶¶ 8–9.) Therefore, the Court finds
that counsel has satisfied the preliminary meet and confer requirement under
Code of Civil Procedure sections 2030.300, subdivision (b)(1) and 2031.310,
subdivision (b)(2).
 
B.    
Defendant’s
Discovery Responses
 
1.     
RFP Nos. 5,
17, 18, 19, 20, and 21
 
California law requires a responding party to respond to
each request for production of documents with either a statement of compliance,
a representation that the party lacks the ability to comply, or an objection to
the demand. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.210, subd. (a).) “A representation
of inability to comply with the particular demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling shall affirm that a diligent search and a reasonable
inquiry has been made in an effort to comply with that demand. This statement
shall also specify whether the inability to comply is because the particular
item or category has never existed, has been destroyed, has been lost,
misplaced, or stolen, or has never been, or is no longer, in the possession,
custody, or control of the responding party. The statement shall set forth the
name and address of any natural person or organization known or believed by
that party to have possession, custody, or control of that item or category of
item.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.230.)
 
A propounding party may move for an order compelling
further response to a request for production if it decides that “a
representation of inability to comply is inadequate, incomplete, or evasive.”
(Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.310, subd. (a).) 
 
Here, Plaintiff seeks further responses to RFP Nos. 5,
17, 18, 19, 20, and 21, which seek documents relating to payments Defendant
received from Cardea, and her communications with certain individuals, current
and former Cardea employees, and Cardea’s Certified Public Accountants. (Ex. A
to Tokar Decl.) Defendant’s responses thereto state the following: “After
conducting a diligent search and making reasonable inquiry, responding party is
unaware of the existence of any documents responsive to this request as
Plaintiff has taken all reports and records from the corporate office and has
denied me access.” (Ex. C to Tokar Decl.)
 
Plaintiff
argues that Defendant’s statement of inability to comply is evasive because she
maintains access to her business email account, where such responsive documents
may be located. (Pl.’s RFP1 Sep. Stmt.; Tokar Decl. ¶ 10.) Therefore, Plaintiff
argues that “many of the requests ask for documents and communications that are
readily in Vladimirskaya’s possession, custody, and control. Vladimirskaya has
no reason for not being able to provide said documents.” (Pl.’s RFP1 Mot. 4:18–20.)
 
The Court
notes that Defendant has failed to oppose the instant motions, therefore the
Court is not persuaded that Defendant lacks the ability to comply with the
subject RFPs by making a diligent search of her business and personal email
accounts for the requested documents. “The object of discovery is to prevent
surprise at trial,” therefore a responding party may not delay “producing what
was clearly in his possession and failed to make a diligent search for records
he could easily have obtained.” (Manlin v. Milner (2022) 82 Cal.App.5th
1004, 1025.) Based on the foregoing, the Court finds that Defendant’s responses
to the subject RFPs are evasive. Accordingly, the Court grants Plaintiff’s
motion to compel Defendant’s further responses to Plaintiff’s RFPs, Set One,
Nos. 5, 17, 18, 19, 20, and 21.
 
2.     
Form Interrogatory Nos. 14.1 and 15.1
 
“The party to whom interrogatories have been propounded
shall respond in writing under oath separately to each interrogatory by any of
the following: (1) An answer containing the information sought to be
discovered; (2) An exercise of the party’s option to produce writings; or (3)
An objection to the particular interrogatory.” (Code Civ Proc. § 2030.210,
subd. (a).) “Each answer in a response to interrogatories shall be as complete
and straightforward as the information reasonably available to the responding
party permits.” (Code Civ Proc. § 2030.220.)
 
A
propounding party may move for an order compelling further responses to
interrogatories if any of the following apply: “(1) An answer to a particular
interrogatory is evasive or incomplete; (2) An exercise of the option to
produce documents under Section 2030.230 is unwarranted or the required
specification of those documents is inadequate; or (3) An objection to an
interrogatory is without merit or too general.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.300,
subd. (a).)
 
Here, Plaintiff seeks to compel Defendant’s further
responses to Form Interrogatory Nos. 14.1 and 15.1. Form Interrogatory No. 14.1
seeks the identities of any persons Defendant contends violated any laws, which
thereby caused the subject incident. Form Interrogatory No. 15.1 seeks facts
and documents supporting each of Defendant’s affirmative defenses.
 
In response to Form Interrogatory No. 14.1, Defendant
stated: “Yes. CA Health & Safety Code § 1746 Section 1601(a)(1),
(b), and C(3) of the California Corporations Code Corp. Code § 213 Corp. Code §
1600(c).” (Pl.’s FROG1 Sep. Stmt. 2:9–13.) As Plaintiff observes, this response
is incomplete as it fails to identify the name, address, and telephone number
of each person involved in the subject incident that Defendant contends
violated any laws thereby causing the incident.
 
In response to Form Interrogatory No. 15.1, Defendant
provided a list of factual allegations, identities of persons with purported
knowledge of those facts, and stated that she is unable to locate or produce
any responsive documents because of her inability to access corporate records.
(Id. at 3:5–6:16.) Plaintiff argues that “none of the responses
above cite or relate to any of the affirmative defenses alleged. Accordingly,
Davidson does not know of [sic] the items recited relate to the third, sixth,
or tenth affirmative defense.” (Id. at 6:21–23.) The Court again notes
that Defendant has failed to oppose the instant motions and justify her
discovery responses in any way, and further reiterates the above discussion
regarding Defendant’s ability to conduct a diligent search of her email
accounts.
 
Based on
the foregoing, the Court finds that Defendant’s responses to the subject
interrogatories are incomplete and evasive. Accordingly, the Court grants
Plaintiff’s motion to compel Defendant’s further responses to Plaintiff’s Form
Interrogatories, Nos. 14.1 and 15.1.
 
C.   
Sanctions 
 
“The court shall impose a
monetary sanction … against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully
makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to interrogatories [or RFPs],
unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial
justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction
unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.290, subd. (c); Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.310,
subd. (h).) Additionally, “the court may impose a monetary sanction ordering
that one engaging in the misuse of the discovery process, or any attorney
advising that conduct, or both pay the reasonable expenses, including
attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct.” (Code Civ.
Proc. § 2023.030, subd. (a).)
 
Here, Plaintiff
requests $1,860.00 in monetary sanctions against Defendant per motion, accounting
for (1) one hour of Plaintiff’s attorney’s time spent drafting each motion; and
(2) an additional anticipated 3 hours preparing each reply and appearing for
the hearing, at counsel’s hourly rate of $450.00. (Tokar Decl. ¶
10.) Plaintiff also seeks to recover $60.00 in filing fees per motion. (Ibid.)
 
In
granting the instant unopposed motions, the Court finds it reasonable to impose
$860.00 in monetary sanctions against Defendant.
 
CONCLUSION
 
The
unopposed motions are granted. Defendant is ordered to provide further
responses to the
subject discovery requests within 30 days. The Court imposes $860.00 in
monetary sanctions against Defendant, payable within 45 days.
