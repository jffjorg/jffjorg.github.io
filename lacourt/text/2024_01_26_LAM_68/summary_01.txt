Summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling is a summary judgment on a demurrer filed by General Motors, LLC (GM) to the first amended complaint filed by Garrett Matsunaga. The demurrer was based on the grounds that the first and second causes of action for fraud-concealment and violations of Business and Professions Code section 17200 were barred by the statute of limitations and lacked sufficient factual particularity.

The court ruled that the statute of limitations was not applicable, as the plaintiff did not discover the defects until November 13, 2020, and the complaint was filed less than three years later. The court also found that the complaint sufficiently alleged the fraud-concealment claim, even without explicit allegations of an agency relationship between GM and its dealership.

The court declined to strike the prayer for punitive damages, as the allegations of fraud were sufficient to support the claim. The court also denied GM's motion to strike the claim for punitive damages, as the allegations of fraud were sufficient to support the claim.

The judge's tentative ruling is a summary judgment on the demurrer, and GM is ordered to answer the first amended complaint within 10 days.
