And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling denies the plaintiff's motion to amend his complaint without prejudice. The plaintiff alleges discrimination and harassment by his former employer, The Claremont Colleges, Inc., and its employees, Stan Skipworth and Cindy Cahill. The plaintiff claims that he requested a religious accommodation but was denied, and that he was subjected to unwarranted and disproportionate discipline, extended meetings with verbal berating and yelling, questioning of his character and integrity, and preclusion of his promotion. The plaintiff also claims that he was alienated due to his Korean ethnicity.

The plaintiff's motion to amend his complaint is denied because he has not provided a red-lined amendment or explained when he discovered the new information. The court finds that the plaintiff has failed to meet his burden in requesting an amendment and that the defendants will not be prejudiced by the denial of the motion. The court notes that leave to amend is not automatic and is only granted if there is a sufficient reason for the amendment.
