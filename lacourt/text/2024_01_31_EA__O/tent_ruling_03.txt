 Case Number:  23PSCV02597    Hearing Date:   January 31, 2024    Dept:  O Tentative Ruling
 
Plaintiff’s
Application for Entry of Default Judgment is CONTINUED to allow for
the filing of a proposed judgment. 
 
Background
 
This is a contracts case. 
 
On August 24, 2023, Plaintiff BANKERS HEALTHCARE GROUP, LLC
filed suit against Defendant PEDRO HERNANDEZ alleging breach of contract for
the unpaid amount of $40,848.49 (plus interest). 
 
On December 4, 2023, default was entered against Defendant.
That same day, Plaintiff filed a ‘Declaration in Support of Request for Entry
of Default Judgment Pursuant to CCP § 585(d) & CCP § 1033.’ 
 
Discussion
 
As Plaintiff seeks the demand as stated in the complaint and
has provided the declaration of its custodian of records to authenticate the
Promissory Note Defendant signed, the court finds no significant defects with
the application.[1] The only
defect is that Plaintiff has not provided a proposed judgment. (See CRC Rule 3.1800(a)(6) [list of
documents that must be included when seeking court judgment based on
declarations].) 
 
Conclusion

 
Based on the
foregoing, the default judgment application is CONTINUED to allow for the
filing of a proposed judgment.
