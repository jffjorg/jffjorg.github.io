Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the motion to compel the deposition of defendant's person most knowledgeable (PMK) and the production of documents. The plaintiffs, Alejandro Sanchez and Edgar Montenegro, are seeking to take the deposition of the PMK and compel the production of documents related to their claims against Ford Motor Company.

Ford Motor Company has objected to the deposition and production of documents, citing a lack of good cause and a failure to meet and confer. The court has found that the exchange of letters between the parties was not sufficient to satisfy the meet and confer requirement, and has ordered the parties to meet and confer in person or by video conference.

The court has also denied the motion to compel the deposition of the PMK and the production of documents. The court has found that the plaintiffs' separate statement was deficient and did not address the requests for production of documents in their second amended notice of PMK deposition.

The case will proceed with the parties meeting and conferencing to resolve their disputes.
