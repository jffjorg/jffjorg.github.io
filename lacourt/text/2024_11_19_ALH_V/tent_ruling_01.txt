alleging the following causes of action: (1) violation of Song-Beverly Act –

implied warranty; and (3) violation of the Song-Beverly Act section 1793.2.
Plaintiffs allege that on February 24, 2022, they purchased a 2021 Ford
EcoSport (subject vehicle). Plaintiffs allege the subject vehicle was delivered
with defects and nonconformities to warranty and developed further defects and
nonconformities to warranty, including, electrical, transmission, structural,
and suspension system defects.

filed the instant motion on October 18, 2024. Defendant filed its opposition on
November 5, 2024. Plaintiffs filed their reply on November 12, 2024.
 
LEGAL STANDARD
A party may obtain
discovery by taking the oral deposition of any person, including any party to
the action. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.010.) 
Code of Civil
Procedure section¿2025.450(a) provides:¿“If, after service of a deposition
notice, a party to the action . . . , without having served a valid objection
under Section 2025.410, fails to appear for examination, or to proceed with it,
or to produce for¿inspection any document . . . described in the deposition
notice, the party giving the notice may move for an order compelling the
deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the production for inspection of any
document . . . described in the deposition notice.”  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2025.450(a).) 
Code of Civil
Procedure section¿2025.450(b) provides:¿“A motion under subdivision (a) shall
comply with both of the following:¿ 
1.      The
motion shall set forth specific facts showing good cause justifying the
production for inspection of any document, electronically stored information,
or tangible thing described in the deposition notice.¿ 
 
2.      The
motion shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section
2016.040, or, when the deponent fails to attend the deposition and produce the
documents, electronically stored information, or things described in the
deposition notice, by a declaration stating that the petitioner has contacted
the deponent to inquire about the nonappearance.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc., §
2025.450(b).) 
 DISCUSSION
            Plaintiffs move for an order
striking defendant’s objections as to the Matters for Examination and to compel
the testimony of defendant’s Person Most Knowledgeable (PMK) for all Matters
for Examination requested in plaintiffs’ second amended notice of PMK
deposition; and striking all of defendant’s request for production objections,
and compelling defendant to produce all responsive documents requested in
plaintiffs’ second amended notice of PMK deposition.
            On April 13, 2023, plaintiffs served
a notice of deposition of defendant’s PMK detailing 34 matters for examination
and including 16 requests for production of documents, noticed for May 5, 2023,
to which plaintiffs received no objection. (Decl. of Gregory Sogoyan, ¶ 20;
Exh. 3.) On May 1, 2023, plaintiffs served an amended notice of deposition
noticed for May 29, 2023. (Decl. of Gregory Sogoyan, ¶ 21; Exh. 4.) On May 24,
2023, defendant served its objections to each matter for examination and
request for production of documents. (Decl. of Gregory Sogoyan, ¶ 22; Exh. 5.)
On August 13, 2024, plaintiffs served a second amended notice of deposition
detailing 84 matters for examination and 86 requests for production of
documents, noticed for August 29, 2024, to which plaintiffs did not receive
objections. (Decl. of Gregory Sogoyan, ¶ 23; Exh. 6.)
A.   
Meet and Confer
On August 13, 2023, plaintiffs’ counsel sent
a meet and confer letter to defendant’s counsel regarding the amended notice of
deposition, seeking alternative dates for the PMK deposition. (Decl. of Gregory
Sogoyan, ¶ 24; Exh. 7.) On October 9, 2024, plaintiffs’ counsel sent
defendant’s counsel an email requesting alterative dates for the deposition by
October 18, 2024. (Decl. of Gregory Sogoyan, ¶ 25; Exh. 8.) Defendant’s counsel
states that on October 16, 2024, counsel replied to plaintiffs’ meet and confer
letters of September 23 and October 9, however, defendant’s counsel’s email was
about its responses to plaintiffs’ requests for production of documents, set
two, stating that defendant had complied with Judge Hofer’s case management
conference order. (Decl. of Cindy L. Mijangos, ¶ 10; Exh. 6.) On October 17,
2024, defendant’s counsel stated their PMK would be available on February 4,
2025, which is a date past the discovery deadline. (Decl. of Gregory Sogoyan, ¶
25; Exh. 8.) The court finds that an exchange of letters is not sufficient to
satisfy the meet and confer requirement. Accordingly, the court orders the
parties to meet and confer.
B.    
Separate Statements
Defendant argues that plaintiffs only provided
a separate statement for the requests for production of documents, but not for
the matters for examination. Under California Rules of Court rule 3.1345
subdivision (a), a motion to compel a PMK to appear for deposition to address
the matters for examination is not a motion that requires a separate statement.
Accordingly, plaintiffs did not need to provide a separate statement for the
matters for examination.
Plaintiffs’ separate statement, however, does
not address the requests for production of documents in plaintiffs’ second
amended notice of PMK deposition, but rather they appear to correspond to
plaintiffs’ amended notice of PMK deposition. Accordingly, the separate
statement is deficient.

Based on the
foregoing, the court DENIES the motion to compel the deposition of defendant’s
person most knowledgeable and production of documents. The court orders the
parties to meet and confer in person or by video conference.
