And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied the plaintiff's request for entry of default judgment in his favor and against defendants Ben Zakarya and Philip Dave Clyde. The plaintiff had filed a complaint alleging breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty, and had served defendant Zakarya personally. However, the plaintiff failed to complete the required documents for default judgment, including proof of service for Philip Dave Clyde and entry of default against him. Additionally, the exhibits attached to the proposed form of judgment were illegible, and the proposed form of judgment showed damages of $0.00 despite the plaintiff's declaration seeking $611,000.00. As a result, the court has denied the plaintiff's application for default judgment and ordered him to resubmit the entire default packet and proposed judgment.
