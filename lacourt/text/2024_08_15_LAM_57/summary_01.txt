And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied MAD Construction & Turnarounds' motion to set aside a default entered against it. MAD claimed that its failure to pay its former counsel's bills and subsequent self-representation in the case was the result of inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect, as allowed by Code of Civil Procedure Section 473(b). However, the judge disagrees, finding that MAD's failure to pay its bills was intentional and not excusable neglect. The judge also notes that MAD was given an opportunity to find new counsel and could have appeared at an order to show cause hearing to ask for more time, but instead chose not to appear and allowed its answer to be struck and a default to be entered. The judge will discuss with counsel for MAD whether the case can proceed to trial on the plaintiff's claims against Guillermo Madrigal, a defendant in the case, individually as scheduled.
