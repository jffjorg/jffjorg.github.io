And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company v. Willie Ellis, in which the plaintiff filed a complaint for Unlawful Detainer alleging that the defendant failed to pay rent on a property located at 9400 Corbin Ave., Unit 302. The defendant filed a demurrer, arguing that the complaint is invalid because the 3-Day Notice to Pay Rent or Quit lacks an option to "cure the breach" and because the lease agreement does not include a basis for termination of the lease term. The judge has overruled the demurrer, finding that the 3-Day Notice properly states the deficiency and basis for termination based on past nonpayment of rent following expiration of the lease term. The judge has also declined to consider any arguments regarding an alleged claim of nuisance not referenced in the 3-Day Notice. The defendant is required to answer the complaint within five days.
