RELIEF
REQUESTED
Motion
for Substitution/Appointment of a Successor
 
SUMMARY
OF ACTION
Plaintiff
Alain Belisle, a majority shareholder, and on behalf of Intelitek, Inc.,
alleges third party minority shareholder Hamid Baheri and ousted third party
shareholder, defendant Mark Shier engaged in certain activities against the
interests of the corporate entity and for personal interest.
On
April 26, 2019, Plaintiff filed a verified derivative complaint for Breach of
Fiduciary Duty, Abuse of Authority, and Accounting. On July 15, 2019, Shier
answered the complaint. On September 24, 2019, Shier filed a cross-complaint
against Belisle and Intellitek for Breach of Fiduciary Duty, Breach of Written
Contract, Wrongful Termination, Breach of Authority and Breach of the Implied
Duty of Good Faith and Fair Dealing, Tortious Interference with Contractual
Relationship, Tortious Interference with Prospective Economic Advantage, Breach
of Buy-Sell Agreement, and Accounting. Plaintiffs answered the cross-complaint
on October 11, 2019. 
 
On
July 10, 2023, counsel for Shier filed a notice of the death of Shier on the
same day. On August 21, 2023, the court granted the motion to stay the action
for 90 days. 
 
RULING: Granted.
Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant, Alain Belisle, on behalf of
Intelitek moves for substitution of a personal representative on behalf of
defendant/cross-complainant, decedent, Mark Shier. Plaintiff moves to
substitute Susan Langan, successor of interest to Estate of Shier. Susan Langan
submitted notice of non-opposition. 
 
A decedent’s appointed personal representative may
substitute into an action for causes of action that survive a plaintiff’s
death. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 377.11, 377.30, 377.31, 377.34.) A
successor-in-interest must file a declaration with specified elements and a
death certificate (Code Civ. Proc., § 377.32). The declaration of Lester
presents the basis of the application. A death certificate was never presented
to the court, notwithstanding the intention to present said certificate in the
July 10, 2023, filed Notice of Death. The court accepts Susan Langan as the
rightful successor, and grants the motion, given the December 4, 2023. 
 
The unopposed motion for substitution of personal
representatives is therefore granted. The court orders the parties to file a
copy of the death certificate within 10 days of this order.
 
Trial date to stand.
 
Belisle to give notice.
