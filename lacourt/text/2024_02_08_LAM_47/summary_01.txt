And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendants' motions in limine. The motions concern the admissibility of certain evidence and the exclusion of others.

The judge has denied the defendants' motions to exclude evidence of their alleged creation of a duplicate lease on the Browning property, as well as their motions to exclude evidence of their alleged use of fraudulent gift letters in connection with seeking a loan from Logix Credit Union.

The judge has also denied the defendants' motion to exclude any evidence of or reference to the 2007 oral agreement regarding the Leucadia property, as well as their motion to exclude any evidence of or reference to a "purported partially oral, partially written agreement to sell" the defendants' interests in Leucadia and Browning to the plaintiffs.

The judge has bifurcated the trial, scheduling a bench trial to begin on February 20, 2024, to address the sufficiency of the writings reflecting the parties' sales contract under the statute of frauds, with the jury trial to follow immediately thereafter.

The judge has also ordered the parties to meet and confer about appropriate jury instructions on the issues of the statute of frauds and the transfer of partnership assets.

The judge has expressed concern about the potential prejudice that will be inflicted on the defendants if the plaintiffs can explore and emphasize the allegedly fraudulent nature of the gift letters and consume trial time in developing this collateral issue.
