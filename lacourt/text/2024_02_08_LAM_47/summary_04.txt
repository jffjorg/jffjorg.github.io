And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled in favor of the plaintiffs and against the defendant's demurrer to the complaint. The complaint alleges that the defendant's products caused the plaintiff to develop silicosis and consequential injuries. The defendant argued that the complaint was insufficiently specific and failed to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. However, the judge found that the complaint adequately alleged the necessary facts, including exposure to silica dust, identification of the products, and the consequences of the exposure. The judge also found that the defendant failed to demonstrate that the complaint was defective with respect to the first three causes of action. With respect to the fourth cause of action, fraudulent concealment, the judge found that the complaint adequately alleged the necessary elements, including concealment of the toxic properties of the products, duty to disclose, intent to defraud, and damage sustained as a result. The judge overruled the defendant's demurrer and ordered the defendant to give notice.
