STATEMENT
OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
            This is an action for fraud that was filed on October 30, 2020. Plaintiff
alleges that he was the victim of a fraud scheme based in Nigeria.
 
The Court issued an order to show
cause re: proof of service on Defendants Kenneth and Paul Corkum in compliance
with the Hague Service Convention. Plaintiff moves for an order for issuance of
letters rogatory. 
            
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
            On December 18, 2023, the Court issued an Order to Show Cause regarding
proof that service was accomplished on Defendants Kenneth and Paul Corkum in
compliance with the Hague Service Convention.
 
            Under subdivision (c) of Code of Civil Procedure section
413.10, service on a person outside the United States is subject to the Hague
Service Convention. (Code Civ. Proc § 413.10(c).) The Hague Service Convention
“is ‘a multilateral treaty that was formulated in 1964 by the Tenth Session of
the Hague Conference of Private International Law … [and] was intended to provide
a simpler way to serve process abroad, to assure that defendants sued in
foreign jurisdictions would receive actual and timely notice of suit, and to
facilitate proof of service abroad.’” (Rockefeller Technology Investments
(Asia) VII v. Changzhou SinoType Technology Co., Ltd. (2020) 9 Cal.5th 125,
135.) The United States was an original signatory to the Convention, which was
also adopted by Spain and Canada in 1987 and 1988, respectively. (Id.;
see https://www.hcch.net/en/instruments/conventions/status-table/?cid=17 [as of
February 5, 2024].) The Hague Service Convention provides in Articles 2 through
7 for the establishment of a central authority within each signatory to receive
and execute requests for service of documents from other countries. (Water
Splash Inc. v. Menon (2017) 518 U.S. 271, 275.) A signatory may also
consent to methods of service within its boundaries other than a request to its
central authority under Articles 8 through 11. (Volkswagenwerk
Aktiengesellschaft v. Schlunk (1988) 486 U.S. 694, 699.) 
 
            Plaintiff argues that the relevant provision governing
service of the Corkum Defendants in British Columbia is Article 10. This
section provides in relevant part that “[p]rovided the State of destination
does not object,” the Convention “shall not interfere with . . . the freedom of
judicial officers, officials or other competent persons of the State of origin
to effect service of judicial documents directly through the judicial officers,
officials or other competent persons of the State of destination[.]” (Hague
Service Convention, art. 10(b).) Canada has not objected to this subdivision.
(See https://www.hcch.net/en/states/auth-orities/details3/?aid=248 [as of February
5, 2024].) 
 
            Plaintiff’s proofs of service, filed on December 27, 2022,
with respect to Kenneth Corkum and on November 28, 2023, with respect to Paul
Corkum, state that these Defendants were personally served in British Columbia
and Ontario, respectively. (December 27, 2022 Proof of Service; November 28,
2023 Proof of Service.) Neither proof of service is accompanied by a
declaration of the process server stating that they are competent to serve
process in Canada and describing how personal service was accomplished.
Moreover, Plaintiff’s brief in response to this Order to Show Cause, amidst a
stream of irrelevant assertions and supporting declarations attacking the
Defendants’ character and credibility, does not even address whether service
was properly made under the laws of Canada. Plaintiff’s argument that the Corkum
Defendants had actual notice of this action is irrelevant, as proper service,
not merely notice, is a prerequisite for establishing this Court’s jurisdiction
over a defendant. (See Code Civ. Proc. § 410.50.) Notably, Plaintiff does not
provide declarations from either process server demonstrating that the
Defendants were actually served. 
 
            In sum, Plaintiff has failed to carry his burden to
demonstrate that service was properly made on the Corkum Defendants in
compliance with the Hague Service Convention. The Court therefore strikes the
proofs of service on these Defendants as invalid. 
 
            Consequently, as Plaintiff has not established
jurisdiction over the parties about whom he seeks to issue letters rogatory,
Plaintiff’s Motion for Order Issuing Letters Rogatory is DENIED without
prejudice. 
 
            Moving
Party to give notice.

            Any party may submit on the
tentative ruling by contacting the courtroom via email at Smcdept47@lacourt.org by no later than 4:00 p.m. the day
before the hearing. All interested parties must be copied on the email. It
should be noted that if you submit on a tentative ruling the court will still
conduct a hearing if any party appears. By submitting on the tentative you
have, in essence, waived your right to be present at the hearing, and you
should be aware that the court may not adopt the tentative, and may issue an
order which modifies the tentative ruling in whole or in part.
