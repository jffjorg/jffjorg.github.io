English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling discusses the parties' dispute over whether the Defendants owed a duty of care to the Plaintiff to prevent the accident, and whether the Plaintiff's intoxication was a superseding cause of the accident. The court notes that there is evidence that tenants and guests regularly used the fire escape for recreational activities, such as smoking and socializing, and that the apartment manager, Olga Avalos, testified that there was a rule against using the fire escapes, but it was not in writing and was not consistently enforced. The court questions whether the recreational use of the fire escape was a dangerous condition, and whether the Defendants had a duty to prevent the accident. The court also notes that the Plaintiff's intoxication may be a factor to consider in determining liability, but it does not necessarily make it a superseding cause. The court's tentative ruling is subject to revision and is not a final ruling.
