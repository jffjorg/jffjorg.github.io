This tentative ruling denies without prejudice a motion filed by the Plaintiff's counsel to be relieved as counsel. The counsel has filed the requisite forms and confirmed that the attorney-client relationship between the Plaintiffs and counsel has broken down. However, the counsel failed to include the hearing date for the OSC re Dismissal in the motion. As a result, the motion is denied without prejudice, and the moving party is required to give notice. The hearing is scheduled for December 7, 2023, and the OSC re Dismissal is scheduled for March 17, 2025.
