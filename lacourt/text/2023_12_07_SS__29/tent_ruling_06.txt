 Case Number:  21STCV45035    Hearing Date:   December 7, 2023    Dept:  29 Tentative
The
motion to advance hearing for summary judgment is DENIED. 
The
motion to continue trial is GRANTED.
Background
This arises from a slip and fall that
occurred on May 30, 2020. 
On December 9, 2021, Plaintiff Kelly Ray Skinner
(“Plaintiff”) filed her complaint against Defendant Trader Joe’s East Inc. (“Defendant”),
asserting causes of action for (1) Premise Liability and (2) General Negligence.

On October 13, 2023, Defendant filed a motion for summary
judgment, with hearing date set for November 7, 2024, after the current trial
date of February 7, 2024. (Declaration of Kristin A Mathis, ¶ 2.)
 
On October 16, 2023, Defendant filed this motion to
advance the date for summary judgment or in the alternative, continue the
trial.
 
Legal
Standard
Code Civ. Proc. § 128(a)(8) provides that the
court has the power to amend and control its process and orders so as to make
them conform to law and justice. “The power to determine when a continuance
should be granted is within the discretion of the trial court.” (Color-Vue,
Inc. v. Abrams (1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 1599, 1603.) “A trial court has wide
latitude in the matter of calendar control including the granting or denying of
continuances.” (Park Motors, Inc. v. Cozens (1975) 49 Cal.App.3d 12,
18.) 
Each request for a continuance must be
considered on its own merits according to California Rules of Court,
Rule 3.1332(c). The court may grant a continuance only on an affirmative
showing of good cause requiring the continuance.  (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1332(c).)
California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1332 sets forth a list of
non-exhaustive factors to be analyzed when determining whether good cause for a
trial continuance is present. A court considers factors such as: (1) the
proximity of the trial date; (2) whether there was any previous continuance,
extension of time, or delay of trial due to any party; (3) the prejudice that
parties or witnesses will suffer as a result of the continuance; and (4) any
other fact or circumstance relevant to the fair determination of the motion or
application. (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1332(d).)
“The motion shall be heard no later than 30
days before the date of trial, unless the court for good cause orders
otherwise. The filing of the motion shall not extend the time within which a
party must otherwise file a responsive pleading.” (CCP § 437c(a)(3).)
Discussion
Defendant
contends good cause exists to advance the hearing date for the motion for
summary judgment, as it would not be head before the trial date. (Declaration
of Kristin A. Mathis, ¶ 2.)  With the
trial date currently set for February 7, 2024, thirty days before would be
January 8, 2024. Due to the Court impacted calendar and to give time to
Plaintiff to possibly respond to the summary judgment motion, the Court cannot
advance the motion for summary judgment.
 
Therefore,
the Court DENIES Defendant’s motion to advance the hearing for summary
judgment.
 
Defendant
contends there is good cause to continue the trial date so the motion for
summary judgment may be heard thirty (30) days before trial. (Id.) Defendant
contends there has only been one continuance in this matter by stipulation.
(Motion, 7:16-17.) Plaintiff has filed no opposition, and so there is nothing
in the record to indicate that the requested continuance would unduly prejudice
Plaintiff.
 
The Court finds that Defendant has established
good cause for continuing trial, as Defendant timely filed its motion for
summary judgment, but the motion cannot be heard until after the current trial
date. 
Therefore, the Court GRANTS the motion to
continue trial.
Conclusion
The Court DENIES
the motion to advance the hearing for Defendant’s motion for summary judgment. The
Court GRANTS the motion to continue trial to at least 30 days after the hearing
for the motion for summary judgment set for November 7, 2024. Trial is
continued to late December 2024.  The
Final Status Conference and all deadlines are reset based on the new trial
date. 
Defendant is
ORDERED to give notice.
