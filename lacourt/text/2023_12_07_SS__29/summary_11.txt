And here is a summary in English text:

This tentative ruling grants the defendant's motion to quash service of summons. The plaintiff, Andrew J. Maduk, filed a complaint against Starbucks Corporation, alleging that the defendant humiliated and intimidated him on November 16, 2021. The defendant is a Washington corporation and was served by FedEx with a copy of the summons, complaint, and other court filings. However, the defendant argues that service was improper because FedEx is not a means listed in the California Code of Civil Procedure. The court finds that the plaintiff has the burden of proving effective service, but has filed no opposition to the motion. Therefore, the court grants the defendant's motion to quash service of summons.
