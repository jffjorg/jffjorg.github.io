Background
This case arises out of an alleged vehicle accident on
February 19, 2018, near the intersection of Colorado Avenue and 26th Street in
Santa Monica, California.  On January 3,
2020, Plaintiff Debbie Thomas ("Plaintiff") filed the complaint in
this action asserting one cause of action for motor vehicle negligence against
Defendants American Medical Response, Inc., Global Medical
Response, Inc, Envision Healthcare, Inc, Zane Steven Petterson, and Does
1 through 50. 
 
On June
27, 2023, Plaintiff served Defendant American Medical Response, Inc.
(“Defendant”) with Requests for Admission (Set One) and Form Interrogatories (Set Two).  (Ryan Decls., ¶ 2 & Exh. 1.)  Plaintiff, after conferring with Defendant,
granted Defendant a 30-day extension of time to respond to the discovery and
withdrew Request For Admission No. 2.  (Id.,
¶ 3 & Exh. 2.)  Even with the
extension, however, Defendant did not respond to the discovery prior to the
filing of these motions.  (Id., ¶
8.) 
 
On October 9, 2023, Plaintiff filed a motion to deem
admitted the truth of the matters specified in Requests for Admission (Set One)
and a motion to compel initial responses to Form Interrogatories (Set
Two).  Plaintiff also seeks monetary
sanctions in both motions.
 
Defendant served responses to the discovery on November
13, 2023.  (Miretsky Decls., ¶¶ 4-5
& Exhs. A-B.)  Defendant filed its
oppositions to the motions on November 21 and 22.  Plaintiff filed her replies on November 29
and 30.
 
Legal Standard
A party must
respond to requests for admission within 30 days after service. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.250, subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests for admission are directed
does not provide a timely response, the propounding party may move for an order
that the truth of the matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted. (Id.,
§ 2033.280, subd. (b).) There is no time limit for such a motion, and no meet
and confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2033.280; Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition,
a party who fails to provide a timely response generally waives all
objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2033.280, subd. (a).) 
The court “shall”
make the order that the truth of the matters specified in the request be deemed
admitted unless the court “finds that the party to whom the requests for
admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a
proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial
compliance with Section 2033.220.”  (Id.,
§ 2033.280, subd. (c); see St. Mary v. Super. Ct. (2014) 223
Cal.App.4th 762, 778-780.)
“It is mandatory
that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a
timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion [to deem
admitted the matters contained in the requests for admission].”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd.
(c).)
A party
must respond to interrogatories within 30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2030.260, subd.(a).) If a party to whom interrogatories are directed
does not provide a timely response, the propounding party may move for an order
compelling response to the interrogatories. (Id., § 2030.290, subd.
(b).) There is no time limit for a motion to compel initial responses, and no
meet and confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2030.290; Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at p. 411.) Nor must a
separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who fails to provide a
timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).) 
When a
party moves to compel initial responses to interrogatories, “the court shall
impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010)
against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the
motion], unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2030.290, subd. (c).)
In Chapter 7 of the Civil Discovery
Act, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010, subdivision (d), defines
“[m]isuses of the discovery process” to include “[f]ailing to respond to or to
submit to an authorized method of discovery.” 
Where a party or attorney has engaged in misuse of the discovery
process, the court may impose a monetary sanction in the amount of “the
reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result
of that conduct.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2023.020, subd. (a).)
 
“[P]roviding
untimely responses does not divest the trial court of its authority [to hear a
motion to compel responses].”  (Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc., supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at p. 407.)  Even if the untimely response “does not
contain objections [and] substantially resolve[s] the issues raised by a motion
to compel responses … the trial court retains the authority to hear the
motion.”  (Id. at pp. 408-409.)  This rule gives “an important
incentive for parties to respond to discovery in a timely fashion.”  (Id.
at p. 408.)  If “the propounding party [does not] take the motion off
calendar or narrow its scope to the issue of sanctions,” the trial court may
“deny the motion to compel responses as essentially unnecessary, in whole or in
part, and just impose sanctions.”  (Id. at p. 409.) “The court may
award sanctions under the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion
to compel discovery, even though no opposition to the motion was filed, or
opposition to the motion was withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided
to the moving party after the motion was filed.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1348(a).)  
Discussion
Requests for Admission
 
On June
27, 2023, Plaintiff served Defendant with Requests for Admission (Set One) (the
“RFAs”).  (Ryan Decl., ¶ 2 & Exh.
1.)  Plaintiff subsequently withdrew RFA
No. 2.  (Id., ¶ 3 & Exh.
2.)  Defendant did not timely respond,
and so Plaintiff filed this motion for a “deemed admitted” order.  (Id., ¶ 8.) 
 
On
November 13, Defendant served late responses. 
(Miretsky Decl., ¶¶ 4-5 & Exh. A.)  Although these responses impermissibly
include objections, which have been waived by the failure to respond in a
timely manner, the responses substantially comply with Code of Civil Procedure
section 2033.220.  Accordingly, Plaintiff’s motion for a deemed
admitted order is DENIED.  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c); St. Mary v. Super. Ct. (2014) 223
Cal.App.4th 762, 778-780.)
 
The
denial is without prejudice as to any motion to compel a further response.
 
To the
extent Defendant seeks an order relieving it from waiving its objections, that
request is denied without prejudice.  A
request for relief from waiver of objections must be sought through a noticed
motion.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280,
subd. (a).)
 
Form Interrogatories
 
On June
27, 2023, Plaintiff served Defendant with Form Interrogatories (Set Two).  (Ryan Decl., ¶ 2 & Exh. 1.)  Defendant did not timely respond, and so
Plaintiff filed this motion for an order to compel initial responses.  (Id., ¶ 8.) 
 
On
November 13, Defendant served late responses. 
(Miretsky Decl., ¶¶ 4-5 & Exh. B.)  Although there are some issues with these
responses, Defendant has now provided an initial response to the
interrogatories.  Accordingly, Plaintiff’s motion for a order compelling initial
responses is DENIED as MOOT.
 
The
denial is without prejudice as to any motion to compel a further response.
 
To the
extent Defendant seeks an order relieving it from waiving its objections, that
request is denied without prejudice.  A
request for relief from waiver of objections must be sought through a noticed
motion.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290,
subd. (a).)
 
Sanctions
 
Providing
late responses after a discovery motion has been filed does not preclude an
award of monetary sanctions.  Sanctions
are mandatory absent a determination that the failure to provide a timely
response was substantially justified or that the imposition of sanctions would
be unjust.
 
Defendant
argues that the failure to serve timely responses was the result of an
inadvertent calendaring mistake and also the result of attempting to ascertain
the correct entity for the defense of this action.  (Miretsky Decls., ¶¶ 6-12.)  
 
The
Court has reviewed the argument and evidence submitted by both sides and finds
that Defendant has not acted with substantial justification and that the
imposition of sanctions would not be unjust. 
Defendant has been defending this case since 2020, and current counsel
has been in place since March 2023; it is not substantially justified to delay
discovery responses, after receiving one extension, based upon some reported
uncertainty regarding the correct entity, when that issue could have been and
should have been resolved years ago.  As
to the scheduling error, it is undisputed that these motions were filed and
served on October 9, and even so Defendant did not serve discovery responses
until more than 30 days later (and more than four months after the discovery
was propounded).  It is not unjust under
these circumstances to impose monetary sanctions under the Civil Discovery Act.
 
The
Court sets sanctions in the amount of $1,006.41 per motion, calculated based
upon 1.5 hours of attorney time per motion, multiplied by counsel’s billing
rate of $625 per hour, plus costs of $68.91 per motion.
 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiff’s Motion to Deem the Truth of the Matters
Specified in Requests for Admissions is DENIED.
Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Initial Responses to Form Interrogatories
(Set Two) is DENIED as moot.
Plaintiff’s requests for sanctions are granted in part.
The Court ORDERS Defendant and counsel of record Liebl,
Miretsky & Mosely, LLP, jointly and severally, to pay monetary sanctions under
the Civil Discovery Act to Plaintiff in the total amount of $2,012.82
($1,006.41 per motion, multiplied by two motions) within 30 days of notice of
this ruling.
Moving party is
ORDERED to give notice.
