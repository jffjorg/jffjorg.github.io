TENTATIVE
The Court will hear argument from counsel.
The tentative below is partial and incomplete.
It is subject to revision. It is not a ruling of the Court. It should not be
considered, treated, or cited as a ruling of the Court.
Background
On January 4, 2022, Plaintiff Lester Jimenez
(“Plaintiff”) filed the Complaint in this action against Defendants 25 Art,
L.P., Frederick Leeds, David Oved, and Does 1 through 50, asserting causes of
action for negligence and premises liability. Plaintiff alleges that he was
seriously injured when he fell down a flight of stairs on a fire escape
attached to a building on South Hobart Boulevard in Los Angeles, California,
that is owned, operated, managed, or controlled by defendants. The Complaint
alleges that the injury occurred on April 22, 2021, but the parties agree that
accident occurred on April 18, 2020. 
On March 25, 2022, Defendants 25 Art, L.P.,
Frederick Leeds, David Oved filed an Answer to the Complaint. On the same day, they
filed a Cross-Complaint for indemnity, apportionment, and declaratory relief
against Roes 1 through 25. 
On April 5, 2023, Plaintiff amended the Complaint
to named Fred Leeds Properties, an unknown entity, as Doe 1, and Fred Leeds
Investment Properties, LP as Doe 2. 
On May 3, 2023, Fred Leeds Investment Properties,
LP, filed an Answer to the Complaint, on its own behalf and as an entity
erroneously named as Fred Leeds Properties. 
On July 18, 2023, Plaintiff named Olga Avalos as
Doe 3. Defendant Avalos filed an Answer on August 30. 
On August 14, 2023, Defendants 25 Art, L.P.,
Frederick Leeds, David Oved amended their Cross-Complaint to name Sharol Batres
as Roe 1. On September 1, they filed a First Amended Cross-Complaint (the
“FACC”). The FACC includes, as the Fourth Cause of Action, a claim against
Batres and Roes 2 through 10 for breach of lease agreement/contract.
On September 20, 2023, Defendants 25 Art, L.P.,
Frederick Leeds, David Oved, Fred Leeds Investment Properties, L.P., and Olga
Avalos (“Defendants”) filed this motion for summary judgment, or in the
alternative, summary adjudication, and their supporting evidence. 
On November 22, Plaintiff filed his opposition
to the motion, supporting evidence, objections, and request for judicial
notice.
On December 1, Defendants filed their reply, objections,
and additional evidence.
Legal Standard
“The purpose of
the law of summary judgment is to provide courts with a mechanism to cut
through the parties’ pleadings in order to determine whether, despite their
allegations, trial is in fact necessary to resolve their dispute.” (Aguilar
v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.) Code of Civil
Procedure section 437c, subdivision (c), “requires the trial judge to grant
summary judgment if all the evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably
deducible from the evidence’ and uncontradicted by other inferences or
evidence, show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that
the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” (Adler v.
Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.) “The function of
the pleadings in a motion for summary judgment is to delimit the scope of the
issues; the function of the affidavits or declarations is to disclose whether
there is any triable issue of fact within the issues delimited by the
pleadings.” (Juge v. County of Sacramento (1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 59, 67,
citing FPI Development, Inc. v. Nakashima (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 367,
381-382.)
As to each cause
of action as framed by the complaint, a defendant moving for summary judgment
or summary adjudication must satisfy the initial burden of proof by presenting
facts to show “that one or more elements of the cause of action ... cannot be
established, or that there is a complete defense to the cause of action.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2); see also Aguilar, supra, 25
Cal.4th at pp. 850-851; Scalf v. D. B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128
Cal.App.4th 1510, 1520.) Once the defendant has met that burden, the burden
shifts to the plaintiff to show that a “triable issue of one or more material
facts exists as to the cause of action or a defense thereto.” (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 437c, subd. (p)(2); see also Aguilar, supra, 25 Cal.4th at pp.
850-851.)
A plaintiff or
cross-complainant moving for summary judgment or summary adjudication must
satisfy the initial burden of proof by presenting facts to show “that there is
no defense to a cause of action if that party has proved each element of the
cause of action entitling the party to judgment on the cause of action.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(1).) Once the plaintiff or cross-complainant has
met that burden, the burden shift to the defendant or cross-defendant to show
that a “triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to the cause of
action or a defense thereto.” (Ibid.)
The party opposing
a motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication may not simply “rely upon
the allegations or denials of its pleadings” but must instead “set forth the
specific facts showing that a triable issue of material fact exists.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 437c, subds. (p)(1) & (p)(2). To establish a triable issue of
material fact, the party opposing the motion must produce substantial
responsive evidence. (Sangster v. Paetkau (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 151,
166.)
Courts “liberally
construe the evidence in support of the party opposing summary judgment and
resolve doubts concerning the evidence in favor of that party.” (Dore v.
Arnold Worldwide, Inc. (2006) 39 Cal.4th 384, 389.)
Evidentiary
Objections/Request for Judicial Notice
Each party objects
to some of the evidence presented by the other. Evidence presented in support
of, or in opposition to, a motion for summary judgment must be admissible.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (d); Perry v. Bakewell Hawthorne LLC (2017) 2
Cal.5th 536, 541-43.) The court must “consider all of the evidence set forth in
the papers, except the evidence to which objections have been made and
sustained.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (c).)
Plaintiff’s
objections are OVERRULED. Defendants’ objections are OVERRULED. 
With regard
to the expert opinion testimony offered by each side, the experts have
appropriate credentials and their testimony relates to a subject that is sufficiently beyond common
experience that the opinion of an expert witness would assist the trier of act;
is based on information of the type on which an expert may reasonably rely; is
based on reasons supported by the information on which the expert relies; and
is not speculative. (Evid. Code, §§ 801-02; Sargon Enterprises v. USC
(2012) 55 Cal.4th 747, 771-21.)
As to the challenge to expert opinion testimony
on the issue of whether a significant risk or dangerous condition exists, the
Court agrees that such testimony is not binding on the Court. “The fact that a
witness can be found to opine that … a condition constitutes a significant risk
and a dangerous condition does not eliminate this court’s statutory task
pursuant to Government Code section 830.2, of independently evaluating the
circumstances.” (Thimon v. City of Newark (2020) 44 Cal.App.5th 745,
755; accord Sun v. City of Oakland (2008) 166 Cal.App.4th 1177, 1189; Davis
v. City of Pasadena (1996) 42 Cal.App.4th 701, 705.) But expert opinion may
be admissible, relevant, and helpful to the Court, even if it is not
determinative. The
Court will consider all of the admissible evidence (including expert opinion
evidence) in conducting its independent obligation (in which expert opinion
evidence is not determinative) to evaluate whether the existence of a dangerous
condition may be resolved on this record as a matter of law.
Plaintiff’s unopposed
request to take judicial notice of four Google map images of the subject
property is GRANTED.
Discussion
Plaintiff asserts causes of
action for negligence and premises liability. The elements of a cause of action
for premises liability are the same as those for negligence: duty, breach,
causation, and damages.¿(Castellon v. U.S. Bancorp¿(2013) 220
Cal.App.4th 994, 998.) The existence and
scope of duty are legal questions for the court.¿¿(Brown v. U.S. Taekwondo (2021)
11 Cal.5th 204, 213; Annocki¿v. Peterson Enterprises, LLC¿(2014) 232
Cal.App.4th 32, 36.)¿
The general rule governing duty
is set forth in Civil Code section 1714: “Everyone is responsible, not only for
the result of his or her willful acts, but also for an injury occasioned to
another by his or her want of ordinary care or skill in the management of his
or her property or person, except so far as the latter has, willfully or by
want of ordinary care, brought the injury upon himself or herself.” (Civ. Code,
§ 1714, subd. (a).) This establishes what the California Supreme Court has
described as the “default rule” that every person has a legal duty “to
exercise, in his or her activities, reasonable care for the safety of others.” (Brown,
supra, 11 Cal.5th at p. 214.)
As applied to businesses and
other property owners, the general rule is that those who own, possess, or
control property have a duty to exercise ordinary care in managing the
property¿to¿avoid exposing others to an unreasonable risk of harm and to keep
the premises reasonably safe.¿(Ortega v. Kmart Corp. (2001) 26
Cal. 4th 1200, 1205, 1209; Annocki, supra, 232 Cal.App.4th at p. 37.)¿If a dangerous
condition exists, the property owner is “under a duty to exercise ordinary care
either to make the condition¿reasonably safe …. or to give a warning adequate
to enable them to avoid the harm.”¿¿(Bridgman v. Safeway Stores, Inc.¿(1960)
53 Cal.2d 443, 446; see also, e.g., Kinsman v. Unocal Corp. (2005) 37 Cal.4th 659, 672-73.)¿
In some cases, a dangerous
condition may be so obvious that the condition itself serves as a warning, and
the landowner may have no further duty to remedy or warn of the condition.  (See Kinsman, supra, 37 Cal.4th at p. 673; Montes v. YMCA of Glendale (2022) 81 Cal.App.5th 1134,
1142; Christoff
v. Union Pacific Railroad Co. (2005) 134 Cal.App.4th 118, 126; Krongos v.
Pacific Gas Electric Co. (1992) 7
Cal.App.4th 387, 393.) This no-duty principle is, however, subject to certain
limitations. (Kinsman, supra, 37 Cal.4th at p. 673; Krongos, supra, 7
Cal.App.4th at p. 393.)
The general
rule is that those who own or control property have a duty to exercise reasonable
care, and any exception to or departure from this rule must be analyzed under
the principles set forth in Rowland v. Christian (1968) 69 Cal.2d 108
and its progeny. (See Cabral v. Ralphs Grocery Co. (2011) 51 Cal.4th
764, 771-72; Kesner v. Superior Court (2016) 1 Cal.5th 1132, 1142-44.)
In Rowland v. Christian,
the California Supreme Court recognized that there can be exceptions to the “fundamental
principle” that those who own or control land have a duty to use reasonable
care, and stated that any such exception must be “clearly supported by public
policy.” (Rowland, supra, 69 Cal.2d at p. 112.) The California Supreme
Court then explained:
A
departure from this fundamental principle [of duty] involves
the  balancing of a number of considerations; the major ones are the
foreseeability of harm to the plaintiff, the degree of certainty that the
plaintiff suffered injury, the closeness of the connection between the
defendant's conduct and the injury suffered, the moral blame attached to the
defendant's conduct, the policy of preventing future harm, the extent of the
burden to the defendant and consequences to the community of imposing a duty to
exercise care with resulting liability for breach, and the availability, cost,
and prevalence of insurance for the risk involved.
(Id. at p. 113.) Foreseeability
of harm, as well as the other factors, must be evaluated on a general basis, to
determine whether to carve out an entire category of cases from the general
rule of duty, rather than by examining the particular facts of the case before
the court and considering, for example, whether the particular plaintiff’s
injury was foreseeable in light of the particular defendant’s conduct. (Kesner,
supra, 1 Cal.5th at pp. 1143-44; Cabral, supra, 51 Cal.4th at p. 772.)
Defendants own and/or manage the subject
apartment building located at 2500 South Hobart Boulevard in Los Angeles.
(Plaintiff’s Statement of Additional Material Facts [“PSAMF”] Nos. 8-10.)
Defendant Olga Avalos was the on-site resident manager at the time of the
incident. (PSAMF No. 11.)
On the evening of April 17, 2020, Plaintiff was
visiting his girlfriend, Sharol Batres, at her unit on the fourth floor of the apartment
building. (Jiminez Decl., ¶ 2.) At approximately 1 am, Plaintiff went on to the
fire escape to smoke a cigarette. (PSAMF No. 49.) While Plaintiff was on the
fourth floor fire escape platform, he fell down the stairwell to the third
floor landing. (PSAMF No. 50; Defendant’s Statement of Undisputed Material
Facts [“DSUMF”] No. 1.) Plaintiff sustained serious injuries, including multiple
spine fractures, and will need to use a wheelchair for the rest of his life. (PSAMF
Nos. 51-54.)
Plaintiff had consumed a significant amount of
alcohol before the incident. (Cole Decl., Exh. M [Resp. to Form Interrogatory
No. 2.13].) Plaintiff’s blood alcohol level was approximately 0.221 g/dL at the
time of the incident. (Cole Decl., Exh. B [Spaeth Decl.], ¶ 5.) That is almost
three times the measurement that is considered impaired for purposes of driving
(0.08). (Ibid.) 
Plaintiff presented the testimony of Ms.
Batres, who testified that there was “open access” to the fire escape and that
tenants and guests “hang out there,” “drink there,” “go out there and smoke.”
(Mullen Decl., Exh. B [Batres Depo.], at 106:1-10.) “There’s a view of
downtown,” she testified, and “it seems like part of the building.” (Id.,
at 106:10-11.) Ms. Batres also testified that sometimes she would go on to the
fire escape at night to see fireworks. (Id., at 133:20-134:8.) When she
was on the fire escape, Ms. Batres testified that she sometimes saw other people
on the fire escape as well. (Id., at 130:23-131:1.) She also stated that
there were approximately times when she saw beer bottles and cigarettes and
other trash on the fire escape and she would clean up the trash. (Id.,
at 145:20-146:10, 308:2-309:5.) 
Ms. Batres estimated that she had been with
Plaintiff on the fire escape approximately ten times, often enjoying the view
of downtown. (Id., at 129:9-23, 130:10-18.)
Plaintiff stated in discovery that he had gone
out on to the fire escape “more than a hundred times between 2018 and 2020.”
(Cole Decl., Exh. M [Resp. to Special Interrogatory No. 62].) In a declaration
filed with the opposition, Plaintiff stated that the fire escapes in the building
“were regularly and routinely used by the residents and their guests as
exterior balconies. … The residents and their guests would the fire escapes to
smoke, drink, hang out, socialize, and take in the views from the upper floors.”
(Jimenez Decl., ¶ 4.)
Prior to approximately 2015, when Ms. Avalos
became the building manager, Ms. Batres had observed people smoking marijuana
on the fire escape and complained to the manager. (Id., at 154:6-155:3.)
The apartment manager, Ms. Avalos, testified
that there was a rule that no one was allowed on the fire escapes (except in
case of emergency use). (Mullen Decl., Exh. C [Avalos Depo.], at 95:7-16.) The
rule was not in writing, but Ms. Avalos would communicate the rule to tenants
when “every now and then … one of the kids were up there I would say, you’re
not supposed to be up, and, okay, sorry, and they’d get off.” (Id., at
95:12-20.) She confirmed that she did “sometimes” see tenants or guests on the
fire escape. (Id., at 96:5-22.) The doors to the fire escapes did not
have alarms and there were “usually” open. (Id., at 100:5-10.) 
There were signs posted outside the door of the
fire escape that read, “Emergency Exit” and “No Smoking.” (DSUMF No. 7; Cole
Decl., Exh. M [Resp. to Special Interrogatory No. 65].)
 
The Court has questions/comments for the
parties:
1.     
Is there
any dispute about Plaintiff’s BAC at the time of the accident?
 
2.     
Defendants’
reliance on the Montes case seems misplaced. In Montes, the Court
of Appeal stated that there were no “circumstances in this case that might
explain why it was reasonably foreseeable Mr. Montes might choose to venture
onto a steep sloping roof that was obviously dangerous.” (81 Cal.App.5th 1134, 1142.)
Here, in contrast, there is significant evidence that tenants and guests
regularly used the fire escape for recreational activities, essentially as balconies.
On this record, there seems to be at least some evidence that the recreational
use of the fire escape was therefore entirely foreseeable. And that it was known
to Defendants.
 
3.     
It seems
that both sides agree that the recreational use of a fire escape as essentially
a balcony is dangerous. Does that make it a dangerous condition?
 
4.     
Is the
dangerous condition truly “open and obvious” when there is evidence that tenants
and guests had regularly used the fire escapes for recreation for years, apparently
without any incident or injury?
 
5.     
Is Plaintiff’s
intoxicated state simply for the jury to consider a matter of comparative
negligence, as opposed to a superseding cause?
Conclusion
