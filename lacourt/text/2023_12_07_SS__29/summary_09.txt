And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the petition to approve the minor's compromise and is inclined to grant it, pending certain corrections. The petition contains math errors that need to be corrected, as well as an incorrect name on Form MC-355. The court also requires corrections in the proposed orders approving the compromise and depositing the funds. The petitioner's petition is therefore continued to 2024 to give them the opportunity to address these issues.
