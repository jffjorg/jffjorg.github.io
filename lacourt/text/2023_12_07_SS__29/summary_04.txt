And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to set aside and vacate the order of dismissal dated February 16, 2023. The motion was filed six months later, supported by an attorney declaration stating that the attorney became ill and overslept past the hearing time on the day of trial. The judge finds that the dismissal was entered based on the attorney's mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect, and that the motion is timely. The judge orders the attorney to pay $250 to the State Bar Client Security Fund within 30 days of the ruling and to file proof of payment with the court within 60 days. The judge also sets a trial setting conference and an OSC regarding submission of proof of payment.
