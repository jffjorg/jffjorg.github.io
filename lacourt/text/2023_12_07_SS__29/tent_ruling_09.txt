 Case Number:  22STCV03234    Hearing Date:   December 7, 2023    Dept:  29  
TENTATIVE
 
The
Court excuses the personal appearance of the claimant and the guardian ad
litem. Counsel may appear by telephone or video conference call. 
 
The
Court is inclined to GRANT Petitioner’s Petition to Approve Minor’s Compromise
(Arthur
Ekmekjian, Age 11), as the
settlement and the requested attorney’s fees appear reasonable.  
 
There
are certain issues, however, that Petitioner must address before the Court can
grant approval.
 
First,
there are math errors in the petition.  
 



Total Settlement


$15,238.90




Less costs
-         
  $3,285.96 Medical
-         
  $3,773.89 Attorney’s
  Fees
-         
  $487.93 Costs


 
 
 
 
$7,547.78
 




Net settlement


$7,691.12



 
If the
total gross settlement amount is $15,238.90 (Petition, ¶ 12(a)), and the total
deductions are $7,547.78 ($3,285.96 in medical costs + $3,773.89 in attorney’s
fees + $487.93 in other costs) (Petition, ¶¶ 14(f), 15(a), 15(b)), then the net
balance of proceeds for the claimant is $7,691.12.  
 
Appropriate
corrections must be made in the petition, including in paragraphs 17, 18, and
20(b)(2). 
 
Second,
similar corrections must be made in the proposed order approving compromise
(MC-351), paragraph 7(c)(2) and 7(c)(2)(a).
 
Third, similar
corrections must be made in the proposed order to deposit money (MC-355), paragraph
4.
 
Fourth,
the name of the claimant is incorrect on Form MC-355.
 
Accordingly,
Petitioner’s Petition to Approve Minor’s Compromise (Arthur Ekmekjian, Age 11) is CONTINUED to _____________ _____, 2024, to give
Petitioner the opportunity to address these issues. 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice.
