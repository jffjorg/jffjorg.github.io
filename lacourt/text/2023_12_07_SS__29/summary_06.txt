And here is the summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motions filed by the defendant, Trader Joe's East Inc. The defendant had filed two motions: one to advance the hearing for summary judgment, and another to continue the trial date. The judge denied the first motion, stating that the court cannot advance the hearing for summary judgment due to the impacted calendar and the need to give time for the plaintiff to respond to the motion. The judge granted the second motion, finding that the defendant has established good cause to continue the trial date, as the motion for summary judgment cannot be heard until after the current trial date. The trial date is continued to late December 2024.
