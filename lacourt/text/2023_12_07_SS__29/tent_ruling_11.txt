 Case Number:  22STCV34796    Hearing Date:   December 7, 2023    Dept:  29 Tentative
The motion to quash is GRANTED.
Background
Andrew J. Maduk ("Plaintiff")
filed suit against Starbucks Corporation (“Defendant”),
alleging that Defendant humiliated and intimidated him on November 16, 2021.  
 
Plaintiff filed a Complaint, pro per,
on November 1, 2022, alleging the cause of action for an intentional tort as Plaintiff
had suffered emotional distress. Plaintiff further alleges Defendant’s actions
were based on his race. Plaintiff filed his First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) on
January 19, 2023.
 
On May 22, 2023, the Court granted
Defendant’s motion to quash service of the summons and complaint based upon
improper service.
 
On October 18, 2023, Plaintiff
apparently attempted to serve Defendant by sending a copy of the FAC and
Complaint to Defendant’s agent for service of process by FedEx.  (Villamor Decl., ¶ 5.)
 
On October
26, 2023, Defendant filed this motion to quash service of summons. Plaintiff has not filed an opposition. 
 
Legal Standard
A
defendant may move to quash service on the ground that the court lacks
jurisdiction by filing a noticed motion to quash the service of summons at any
time before the expiration of its time to plead. (Code Civ. Proc., § 418.10,
subd. (a)(1).) “‘Service of process, under longstanding tradition in our system
of justice, is fundamental to any procedural imposition on a named defendant.’
[Citation.]”  (AO Alfa-Bank v.
Yakovlev (2018) 21 Cal.App.5th 189, 202.)  “To establish personal jurisdiction,
compliance with statutory procedures for service of process is essential.”  (Kremerman v. White (2021) 71
Cal.App.5th 358, 370.)  Defendant’s
knowledge of the action does not dispense with statutory requirements for
service of summons.  (Kappel v.
Bartlett (1988) 200 Cal.App.3d 1457, 1466.) 
“When a
defendant challenges the court’s personal jurisdiction on the ground of
improper service of process ‘the burden is on the plaintiff to prove the
existence of jurisdiction by proving, inter alia, the facts requisite to an
effective service.’” (Summers v. McClanahan (2006) 140 Cal.App.4th
403, 413.)
Discussion
Plaintiff
apparently attempted to serve Defendant by sending a copy of the Summons,
Complaint, FAC, and other court filings to its registered Agent for Service of
Process using FedEx. (Villamor, ¶ 5.) Defendant argues service was improper as
FedEx is not a means listed in the California Code of Civil Procedure. (Motion,
3-4:27, 1-2.) 
 
Defendant
is a Washington corporation.  There are
various ways in which an out-of-state corporation may be served, including, but
not limited to, delivery of the summons and complaint to the corporation’s designated
agent for service of process.  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 416.10, subds. (a), (b), (d); Corps. Code, § 2110.)  Where, as here, the agent is located within
the State of California, personal service is generally required (subject to
certain exceptions).  (Corps. Code, § 2110.)
 
Plaintiff
has the burden of proving effective service but has filed no opposition to the
motion.
 
Accordingly,
the Court GRANTS Defendant’s motion to
quash service of summons.
 
Conclusion
Defendant’s
motions to quash service of summons is GRANTED.
Moving party is
ORDERED to give notice.
