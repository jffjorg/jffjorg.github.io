[1] The EDD’s Notice
of Determination states that Petitioner did not meet the legal requirements for
filing a claim beginning June 5, 2022. 
(AR 2.)  As the ALJ and Respondent
have noted, Petitioner is seeking to backdate his claim to June 10, 2021, the
week of his termination.  (AR 21;
Opposition 7:17-19.)


[2] Unless otherwise
stated, all further citations are to title 22 of the California Code of
Regulations. 


[3] Section
11425.50(b) provides in relevant part: “If the factual basis for the decision includes a
determination based substantially on the credibility of a witness, the
statement shall identify any specific evidence of the observed demeanor,
manner, or attitude of the witness that supports the determination, and on
judicial review the court shall give great weight to the determination to the
extent the determination identifies the observed demeanor, manner, or attitude
of the witness that supports it.” 
 


[4] For instance,
there is no evidence that the experiences of the other claimants at physical
EDD offices, as observed by the ALJ at other administrative hearings, would
necessarily be the same at the EDD offices near Petitioner.   
 


[5] Petitioner also
argues that the ALJ asked him “adversarial questions” and “act[ed] more like a
prosecutor than an unbiased factfinder,” depriving Petitioner of due process.
(OB 7:24-25, 12:1-9.)  “Absent a
financial interest, adjudicators are presumed impartial.”  (Today’s Fresh Start, Inc. v. Los Angeles
County Office of Education (2013) 57 Cal.4th 197, 219.)  “Bias and prejudice are never implied and
must be established by clear averments.” 
(Burrell v. City of Los Angeles (1989) 209 Cal.App.3d 568, 581-582.)  Petitioner must show “an unacceptable
probability of actual bias on the part of those who have actual decisionmaking
power over their claims.”  (Nasha LLC
v. City of Los Angeles (2004) 125 Cal.App.4th 470, 483, citation omitted.)  Petitioner has not discussed the relevant
case authorities involving biased adjudicators or applied them to the facts of
this case.  Given the high standard that
applies, Petitioner has not proven that the ALJ was biased simply because she
asked him some probing questions at the hearing.
