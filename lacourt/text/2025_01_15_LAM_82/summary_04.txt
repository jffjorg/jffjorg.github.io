As for the summary in English text, here it is:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving a Petitioner who is seeking to backdate his claim to June 10, 2021, the week of his termination. The EDD had denied Petitioner's claim, stating that he did not meet the legal requirements for filing a claim beginning June 5, 2022. Petitioner argues that the ALJ was biased in her decision and that she asked "adversarial questions" and "acted more like a prosecutor than an unbiased factfinder." However, the judge finds that Petitioner has not proven that the ALJ was biased and that the high standard for proving bias has not been met. The judge notes that the ALJ is presumed impartial unless a financial interest is shown, and that Petitioner has not discussed relevant case authorities involving biased adjudicators or applied them to the facts of the case. The judge intends to give great weight to the ALJ's decision, which identifies the observed demeanor, manner, or attitude of the witness that supports it.
