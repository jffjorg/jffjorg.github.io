And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge's tentative ruling is that the demurrer filed by Fernan Marticio Balicoco is overruled. The ruling is based on the court's determination that the demurrer is not a challenge to the subject matter jurisdiction of the court, but rather a challenge to the court's personal jurisdiction over the defendant. The court finds that the defendant has waived his challenge to the court's personal jurisdiction by failing to file a motion to quash service of the summons based on his personal jurisdiction/diplomatic immunity argument. The court also finds that the demurrer is not properly brought under Code of Civil Procedure section 430.10, subdivision (a), which is a general demurrer that must be decided based only on the face of the pleading and judicially noticeable facts. Therefore, the court exercises its discretion to excuse the defendant's failure to meet and confer with the plaintiff's counsel and moves forward to consider the merits of the demurrer.
