The Plaintiffs failed to respond to these requests, and the Defendant has not shown any opposition. The Judge granted the motions to compel, ordering the Plaintiffs to serve code-compliant, written, verified responses to the discovery requests within 20 days of notice. The Judge also denied the Defendant's requests for monetary sanctions, as the Plaintiffs did not oppose the motions.
