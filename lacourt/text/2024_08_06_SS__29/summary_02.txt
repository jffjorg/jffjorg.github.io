And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant has filed a motion for terminating, issue, and monetary sanctions against the plaintiff due to the plaintiff's failure to comply with discovery requests. The court has reviewed the motion and has decided to grant it in part.

The court denies the defendant's request for a terminating sanction, as there is no evidence of a history or pattern of willful abuse or repeated violations that have not been cured by lesser sanctions. However, the court finds that the plaintiff's failure to comply with discovery requests has been unfairly prejudicial to the defendant and has denied the defendant the opportunity to prepare for trial.

As a result, the court grants the defendant's request for lesser non-monetary sanctions, which include the exclusion of certain evidence and the inability to present certain testimony at trial. The court also grants the defendant's request for monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,200.

The court's order is intended to obtain compliance with the discovery rules and to protect the interests of the parties involved. The court's primary purpose is to obtain compliance with the discovery rules, not to punish the parties.
