on November 6, 2019.
 
On June 7, 2023, Defendant

Legal Standard
When a plaintiff fails to obey an order compelling answers to
interrogatories, “the court may make those orders that
are just, including the imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction,
or a terminating sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010).  In lieu of or in addition to,
that sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (c).)
When a plaintiff fails to obey an order compelling responses to
requests for production, “the court may
make those orders that are just, including the imposition of an issue sanction,
an evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing
with Section 2023.010).  In lieu of or in
addition to, that sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7.”  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.300, subd. (c).)
In Chapter 7 of the Civil Discovery Act, section 2023.030 provides
for monetary, evidence, issue, and terminating sanctions for any “misuse of the
discovery process,” “[t]o the extent authorized by the chapter governing any
particular discovery method or any other provision of this title.”  A “misuse of
the discovery process” is defined to include (among other things) failing to
respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery; making, without
substantial justification, an unmeritorious objection to discovery; making an
evasive response to a discovery request; disobeying a court order to provide
discovery; and making or opposing, unsuccessfully, a motion to compel without
substantial justification. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subds. (d)-(h).)
The Civil Discovery Act provides for an escalating and
“incremental approach to discovery sanctions, starting with monetary sanctions
and ending with the ultimate sanction of termination.” (Lopez v. Watchtower
Bible & Tract Society of New York, Inc. (2016) 246 Cal.App.4th
566, 604.) Discovery sanctions should be appropriate to and commensurate
with the misconduct, and they “should not exceed that which is required to
protect the interests of the party entitled to but denied discovery.” (Doppes
v. Bentley Motors, Inc. (2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 967, 992.) “If a lesser
sanction fails to curb misuse, a greater sanction is warranted: continuing
misuses of the discovery process warrant incrementally harsher sanctions until
the sanction is reached that will curb the abuse.” (Ibid.; see also,
e.g., Mileikowsky v. Tenet Healthsystem (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th
262, 279-280.) 
Terminating sanctions should be used sparingly. (Doppes, supra, 174
Cal.App.4th at p. 992; R.S. Creative, Inc. v. Creative Cotton, Ltd. (1999)
75 Cal. App. 4th 486, 496.) “Although in extreme cases a court has the
authority to order a terminating sanction as a first measure, a terminating
sanction should generally not be imposed until the court has attempted less
severe alternatives and found them to be unsuccessful and/or the record clearly
shows lesser sanctions would be ineffective.” (Lopez, supra, 246
Cal.App.4th at p. 604.)  But where discovery violations are
“willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less
severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the
trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction.” (Doppes, supra, 174
Cal.App.4th at p. 992.) Repeated and willful violations of discovery orders
that prejudice the opposing party may warrant a terminating sanction. (Creed-21
v. City of Wildomar (2017) 18 Cal.App.5th 690, 702; Los
Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 377, 390; Biles
v. Exxon Mobil Corp. (2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1327; Lang v.
Hachman (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 1225, 1246; Collisson X Kaplan
v. Hartunian (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 1611, 1617-1622.)
The
primary purpose of discovery sanctions is to obtain compliance with the Civil
Discovery Act and the Court’s orders. It is not to punish. (Newland v.
Super. Ct. (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 608, 613; Ghanooni v. Super
Shuttle of Los Angeles (1993) 20 Cal.App.4th 256, 262.) A discovery
sanction should not create a “windfall” for a party or place a party in a
better position than it would have been if the opposing party had simply
complied with its obligations under the Court’s orders and the Civil Discovery
Act. (Rutledge v. Hewlett-Packard Co. (2015) 238 Cal.App.4th 1164,
1194; see also 2 Weil & Brown, California Practice Guide: Civil Procedure
Before Trial (The Rutter Group 2023), ¶¶ 8:2214-2220.)
Discussion
Defendant and CHWC filed this motion for terminating
sanctions, or in the alternative, issue sanctions and monetary sanctions.
As a threshold matter, the Court denies the request of CHWC
for any relief.  CHWC has not filed an
answer to the complaint or otherwise appeared in this matter.  Nor did CHWC propound the discovery at issue.
Turning now to Defendant’s requests, the Court denies the
request for terminating sanctions.  For
terminating sanctions, a party must present evidence of repeated and willful
misuse of the discovery process, as well as evidence that less
severe sanctions have not (or likely will not) lead to compliance with the
discovery rules.  Defendant has not, on
this record at this time, made such a showing. 
There has not been a showing of a history or pattern of
willful abuse or repeated violations that have not been (or cannot be) cured by
lesser sanctions. 
Moreover, a discovery sanction should not
create a “windfall” for a party or place a party in a better position than it
would have been if the opposing party had simply complied with its obligations
under the Court’s orders and the Civil Discovery Act. (Rutledge, supra, 238
Cal.App.4th at p. 1194.)  
Here, at this time, a terminating sanction
would create such a windfall for Defendants.
Therefore, Defendant’s request for
terminating sanctions is DENIED.
Alternatively, Defendant requests lesser
non-monetary sanctions.  Plaintiff has
failed to comply with his obligations under the Civil Discovery Act and has
failed to comply with this Court’s order regarding discovery.  This is serious discovery abuse that merits
serious sanctions.
The Court has reviewed the form
interrogatories, special interrogatories, and requests for production at issue.  These discovery requests relate to a variety
of topics, including (but not limited to) medical bills, other out-of-pocket expenses,
lost income (past or present), and lost earning capacity (past or
present).  Plaintiff’s refusal to respond
to this discovery, the Court finds, has been unfairly prejudicial to Defendant
and his ability to prepare for trial. 
(See Trobough Decl., ¶¶ 4-5.)  
To remedy this unfair prejudice, the Court
orders as follows as sanctions against Plaintiff under the Civil Discovery Act:
(1) Plaintiff is not permitted to present, before or at trial, any testimony or
other evidence of medical billings, past or future lost income, or past or
future lost earnings; and (2) Plaintiff is not permitted to present, before or
at trial, any documents or other tangible evidence that was requested in Defendant’s
Demand for Production of Documents and Things (Set One), Nos. 1-48, served on
or about June 7, 2023, unless such documents or other tangible evidence were produced
in discovery in this matter on or before August 6, 2024.
The Defendant’s request for lesser
non-monetary sanctions is GRANTED IN PART.
Defendant also requests monetary
sanctions.  Such sanctions are warranted
here for Plaintiff’s failure to comply with the Court’s order.  The Court sets sanctions in the amount of
$1,200, based on four hours of attorney time in connection with this motion,
multiplied by counsel’s reasonable billing rate of $300 per hour.  (See Trobough Decl., ¶ 6.)
The Defendant’s request for lesser
non-monetary sanctions is GRANTED IN PART.
Conclusion
The Court GRANTS IN PART and DENIES IN PART Defendants’
motion for sanctions.
The Court DENIES Defendant’s request for a
terminating sanction.
The Court GRANTS IN PART Defendant’s request
for lesser non-monetary sanctions.  
The Court ORDERS that (1) Plaintiff
is not permitted to present, before or at trial, any testimony or other evidence
of medical billings, past or future lost income, or past or future lost
earnings; and (2) Plaintiff is not permitted to present, before or at trial, any
documents or other tangible evidence that was requested in Defendant’s Demand
for Production of Documents and Things (Set One), Nos. 1-48, served on or about
June 7, 2023, unless such documents or other tangible evidence were produced in
discovery in this matter on or before August 6, 2024.

The
Court ORDERS Plaintiff to pay monetary sanctions under the Civil Discovery Act
to Defendant in the amount of $1,200, within 30 days of notice.
Moving
