And here is the English summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the motions to compel Plaintiff Leilani LaCaille's responses to Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, and Demand for Production of Documents. The Plaintiff has failed to respond to these discovery requests, and the Defendant has moved to compel responses. The Judge finds that the Plaintiff's failure to respond constitutes a misuse of the discovery process, but notes that the Legislature has not authorized sanctions for such conduct. Therefore, the requests for sanctions are denied. The Judge orders the Plaintiff to serve code-compliant, written, verified responses to the discovery requests within 15 days of notice of this order.
