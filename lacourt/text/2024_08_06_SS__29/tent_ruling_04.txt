 Case Number:  21STCV32851    Hearing Date:   August 6, 2024    Dept:  29 Demurrer to Complaint filed by Fernan Marticio Balicoco.
 
Tentative
The demurrer is overruled.
Background
On September 7, 2021, Eduardo Gomez and Jennifer Cruz
(collectively “Plaintiffs”) filed a complaint against Adelio Anglito Cruz and
Does 1 through 50, asserting causes of action for general negligence and motor
vehicle negligence arising out of an alleged accident on June 18, 2020, at or
near the intersection of Wilton Place and San Marino Street in Los Angeles.
On November 2, 2021, Plaintiffs amended the complaint to name
Fernan Marticio Balicoco (“Defendant”) as Doe 1.
On January 11, 2022, the Court, at the request of Plaintiffs,
dismissed with prejudice all causes of action in the complaint against
Defendant Adelio Anglito Cruz (only).
On August 19, 2022, the Court granted Defendant’s first motion to
quash service of summons and complaint, based on evidence that Defendant was
not in fact validly served by personal service or substitute service (as
asserted in proofs of service filed with the Court).
On August 11, 2023, this Court granted the application of
Plaintiffs to serve Defendant by publication in The Manila Times (published in
Manila, Philippines) and in the Beverly Hills Courier (published in Beverly
Hills, California).  Proof of publication in the Beverly Hills Courier was
filed with the Court on September 13, 2023, and proof of publication in The
Manila Times was filed with the Court on April 2, 2024. 
On April 22, 2024, Defendant filed a second motion to quash
service of summons. Defendant argued that service by publication was not valid
and did not comply with the Hague Service Convention and governing statutes.  On May 17, 2024, the Court denied that
motion.
 
 
 
 
 
On July 8, 2024, Defendant filed this
demurrer to Plaintiffs’ complaint. Plaintiffs filed an opposition on July 24. Defendant
filed a reply on July 30.
 
Legal Standard
Code of Civil Procedure section 430.10 provides:
“The party against whom a complaint or cross-complaint has been
filed may object, by demurrer or answer as provided in Section 430.30, to the
pleading on any one or more of the following grounds:
(a) The court has no jurisdiction of the subject of the
cause of action alleged in the pleading.
(b) The person who filed the pleading does not have the
legal capacity to sue.
(c) There is another action pending between the same
parties on the same cause of action.
(d) There is a defect or misjoinder of parties.
(e) The pleading does not state facts sufficient to
constitute a cause of action.
(f) The pleading is uncertain. As used in this subdivision,
“uncertain” includes ambiguous and unintelligible.
(g) In an action founded upon a contract, it cannot be
ascertained from the pleading whether the contract is written, is oral, or is
implied by conduct.
(h) No certificate was filed as required by Section 411.35.”
A
general demurrer for sufficiency under Code of Civil Procedure section 430.10,
subdivision (e), tests whether the complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn
v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.)
“We treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts
properly pleaded, but not contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or
law.  We also consider matters which may
be judicially noticed.”  (Centinela Freeman
Emergency Medical Associates v. Health Net of California (2016) 1 Cal.5th
994, 1010; Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318; accord Yvanova
v. New Century Mortgage Corp. (2016) 62 Cal.4th 919, 924; Marina Pacific
Hotel and Suites v. Fireman’s Fund Insurance Company (2022) 81 Cal.App.5th 96,
104.)
Courts must “liberally construe the pleading” and “give the
complaint a reasonable interpretation, reading it as a whole and its parts in
context.”  (Marina Pacific Hotel and
Suites, supra, 81 Cal.App.5th at p. 105.)
A demurrer can be sustained only when it
disposes of an entire cause of action. (Poizner v. Fremont General Corp.
(2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97, 119; Kong v. City of Hawaiian Gardens Redev.
Agency (2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 1028, 1046.)
Leave to amend should be granted when “there is a reasonable
possibility that the defect can be cured by amendment.”  (Centinela Freeman, supra, 1 Cal.5th at
p. 1010; Blank, supra, 39 Cal.3d at p. 318; Shaeffer v. Califia Farms
(2020) 44 Cal.App.4th 1125, 1145.)
Meet and Confer Requirement
"Before filing a demurrer pursuant to this chapter,
the demurring party shall meet and confer in person or by telephone with the
party who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the purpose of
determining whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve the
objections to be raised in the demurrer.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a).)
Defendant presents no evidence that it complied with the
statutory meet and confer requirement before filing this demurrer.  The Legislature has provided, however, that
the failure to meet and confer is “not grounds to overrule or sustain a
demurrer.”  (Id., subd. (a)(4).)  
In light of the nature of each side’s arguments, and the
absence of any reasonable likelihood that Defendant’s objections could be resolved
through a conference of counsel, the Court exercises its discretion to excuse
the failure of Defendant to meet and confer and moves forward to consider the
merits of his demurrer.
Objections
to Evidence
Plaintiffs assert
four objections to the evidence that Defendant submits with his demurrer.
The Court
SUSTAINS all four objections.
As to Objections
Nos. 1-3, no request for judicial notice has been made, and counsel does not
establish in her declaration any basis in personal knowledge for her attempt to
authenticate Exhibits A-C.  In addition,
as to Objection Nos. 1-2, the information contained within Exhibits A & B
is inadmissible hearsay offered for the truth of the matters asserted therein.
As to Objection
No. 4, counsel does not establish in her declaration any basis in personal
knowledge for her factual assertions.
Discussion
Defendant demurs to the complaint under Code
of Civil Procedure section 430.10, subdivision (a), which states: “The court has no jurisdiction of the subject of the cause of action
alleged in the pleading.”  As explained
in a leading treatise, a demurrer brought under the provision of subdivision
(a) is a challenge to the subject matter jurisdiction of the court.  (1 Weil & Brown, California Practice
Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (2024), ¶¶ 7:64-65; see also Holiday
Matinee, Inc. v. Rambus, Inc. (2004) 118 Cal.App.4tha 1413, 1421; Buss
v. J.O. Martin Co. (1966) 241 Cal.App.2d 123, 133.)  Subdivision (a) does not provide a basis for
a challenge based on lack of personal jurisdiction.  (1 Weil & Brown, supra, ¶ 7:65.)
Here, however, Defendant’s challenge is based
on personal jurisdiction.  He does not
claim that the Los Angeles County Superior Court (a court of general
jurisdiction) lacks subject matter jurisdiction over causes of action arising
out of a vehicle accident in the City of Los Angeles.  He does not claim, for example, that the case
is subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal courts, or is within
the exclusive jurisdiction of an agency or some other tribunal.  Rather, Defendant claims that he is not
subject to the jurisdiction of the Court because of his diplomatic status; this
is a challenge to the Court’s personal jurisdiction over a particular party,
not a challenge to the Court’s subject matter jurisdiction.
Challenges to personal jurisdiction must be raised
by a motion to quash service of the summons under Code of Civil Procedure section
418.10.  (See Code Civ. Proc., § 418,
subd. (a)(1) [stating that a party may move to quash service of the summons “on
the ground of lack of jurisdiction of the court over him or her”].)  “If defendant instead demurs, the demurrer
constitutes a general appearance, waiving any defect in personal jurisdiction.”  (1 Weil & Brown, supra, ¶ 7:65;
see also Code Civ. Proc., § 1014.)
Defendant is, of course, quite familiar with
motions to quash, as he has filed two such motions in this case.  The first, asserting invalid service, was
granted.  The second, also asserting
invalid service (although for a different reason), was denied.  At no time, however, has Defendant move to quash
service of the summons based on his personal jurisdiction/diplomatic immunity
argument that appears in the demurrer.
This difference is significant.  A demurrer under section 430.10, subdivision
(a), is a general demurrer and must be decided based only on the face of the
pleading and judicially noticeable facts. 
A motion to quash, however, is an evidence-based motion: the court may
consider declarations and other evidence beyond the face of the pleadings, may
order discovery, and may (if needed) resolve disputed issues of fact in making
its ruling.
Defendant’s challenge to the personal jurisdiction
cannot be adjudicated under Code of Civil Procedure section 430.10, subdivision
(a).  Defendant has now generally appeared
and so has waived his challenge to this Court’s exercise of personal jurisdiction
over him.
Accordingly, Defendant’s
demurrer is OVERRULED.
Conclusion
The Court OVERULES Defendant’s demurrer
Moving Party is to give notice.
