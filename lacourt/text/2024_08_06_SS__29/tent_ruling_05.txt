Background
On December
3, 2021, Leilani LaCaille (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Lourdes
Rodriguez (“Defendant”) for negligence, negligence per se, and vicarious
liability causes of action arising out of an automobile accident occurring on
June 28, 2019.
On March 22, 2024, Defendant filed an
answer.
On June 26, 2024, Defendant filed motions
to compel Plaintiff’s responses to form interrogatories, special
interrogatories, and demand for production. No opposition has been filed.
 
Legal Standard
A party must respond to interrogatories within 30 days
after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subd.(a).) If a party to whom
interrogatories are directed does not provide a timely response, the
propounding party may move for an order compelling response to the
interrogatories. (Id., § 2030.290, subd. (b).) There is no time limit
for a motion to compel initial responses, and no meet and confer efforts are
required. (See id., § 2030.290; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc.
v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor
must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who fails to provide a
timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).) 
When a party moves to compel initial responses to
interrogatories, “the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the motion], unless it finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd.
(c).)
A party must respond to requests for production of
documents within 30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260,
subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests for production of documents are directed
does not provide timely responses, the requesting party may move for an order
compelling response to the demand. (Id., § 2031.300, subd. (b).) There
is no time limit for a motion to compel initial responses, and no meet and
confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2031.300; Sinaiko Healthcare
Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th
390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who
fails to provide a timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a).) 
When
a party moves to compel initial responses to requests for production, “the
court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes [the motion], unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction
acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the
imposition of the sanction unjust.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (c).) 
In Chapter 7 of the Civil Discovery
Act, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010, subdivision (d), defines
“[m]isuses of the discovery process” to include “[f]ailing to respond to or to
submit to an authorized method of discovery.” 
Where a party or attorney has engaged in misuse of the discovery
process, the court may impose a monetary sanction in the amount of “the reasonable
expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that
conduct.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2023.020, subd. (a).)
"Except as otherwise provided in this
chapter, any party shall be entitled as a matter of right to complete discovery
proceedings on or before the 30th day, and to have motions concerning discovery
heard on or before the 15th day, before the date initially set for the trial of
the action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2024.020, subd. (a).) 
Discussion
On March 22, 2024, Defendant served Plaintiff
with form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and demand for production.  (Norling Decls., ¶ 2 & Exhs. A.)  Plaintiff has not responded to these
discovery requests.  (Id., ¶ 5.)
Defendant need not show anything more.  The motions to compel Plaintiff to respond to
the form interrogatories, the special interrogatories, and the demand for
production are GRANTED.  
The requests for sanctions in connection with the
motions to compel responses to the interrogatories and requests for production
are DENIED.  
Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010,
subdivision (d), defines “[m]isuses of the discovery process” to include
“[f]ailing to respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery” but
does not independently authorize sanctions for such conduct.
Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.030 provides
for the imposition of sanctions against any party or attorney who engages in
conduct that is a misuse of the discovery process “[t]o the extent authorized
by the chapter governing any particular discovery method or any other provision
of this title [the Civil Discovery Act].” 
This section, itself, does not independently authorize sanctions.
In the chapters of the Civil Discovery Act governing
interrogatories and requests for production, the Legislature has authorized
sanctions in the context of a motion to compel initial responses “against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes” the motion to compel.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (c) &
2031.300, subd. (c).)  Here, however,
Plaintiff has not opposed the motion. 
Accordingly, no sanctions are authorized.
