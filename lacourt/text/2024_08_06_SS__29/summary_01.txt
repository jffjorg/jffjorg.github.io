And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Plaintiff's motion for issue, evidence, and terminating sanctions against Defendant Costco Wholesale Corporation. The motion was based on Defendant's failure to produce training videos responsive to Request No. 6, which was ordered by the court on May 1, 2024. The judge found that Defendant's delay in producing the documents was not prejudicial and that Plaintiff has a full and complete remedy by filing a motion to reopen discovery. Additionally, the judge rejected Defendant's argument that the motion was untimely, finding that it was related to Defendant's previous violations of the May 1 Minute Order. The judge also denied Plaintiff's request for daily trebling of monetary sanctions and for a hearing on terminating sanctions.
