  Case Number:  21STCV05805    Hearing Date:   August 6, 2024    Dept:  29 Plaintiff’s Motion
for Issue, Evidence, and Terminating Sanctions 
 
Tentative
 
The motion is denied.
 
Background
On February 16, 2021, Plaintiff Peter Valdes
(“Plaintiff”) filed the complaint in this action against Defendants Costco
Wholesale Corporation (“Defendant”) and Does 1 through 50, asserting causes of
action for negligence and premises liability arising out of an alleged slip and
fall on February 17, 2019, at a gas pump at a Costco on Hoxie Avenue in
Norwalk.
On March 26, 2021, Defendant filed an answer.
On November 22, 2023, Plaintiff moved to compel the production
of documents responsive to Document Request No. 6.  Plaintiff’s
Request No. 6 request the production of: “Any and all DOCUMENTS relating to
safety training of new Costco Wholesale Corporation gas station attendants, in
effect at the time of the SUBJECT INCIDENT, including any training videos,
particularly the training video(s) related to handling gas spills.”
On May 1, 2024, Plaintiff’s motion to compel the production of
documents came before the Court.  The Court
granted the motion.  (See Minute Order
dated May 1, 2024 [the 
“May 1 Minute Order”].)
At the hearing, one of the issues that arose was that
Defendant contended that because of certain technical issues, the training
module video itself could not be produced. 
The Court ordered that “if a direct copy of the video cannot be
produced, Defendant may produce a captured video recording of the training
video.”  (May 1 Minute Order, at p. 5.)  The Court further ordered that Defendant
produce the video within 7 days.  (Ibid.)
Plaintiff contends that Defendant has not complied with the May
1 Minute Order.  
On May 13, 2024, Plaintiff’s ex parte application to enforce
the May 1 Minute Order, to sanction Defendant, and continue trial came before
the Court.  The Court (1) denied the
motion for a new order compelling Defendant to comply with the Minute Order, on
the ground that the Court had already made its order a new order was
unnecessary; (2) denied the requests for sanctions, without prejudice, as
sanctions can be imposed only after notice and an opportunity to respond; (3)
continued the trial date to June 24; and (4) ordered that no discovery
deadlines were extended, except that either party could pursue further relief
relating to the matters addressed in the Minute Order.
On May 20, 2024, Plaintiff filed a motion contending that
Defendant has not complied with the May 1 Minute Order and requesting the
following relief: (1) monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,500; (2) daily
trebling of the monetary sanctions until Defendant complies; (3) that the
Court set a further hearing for issue and/or evidentiary sanctions if Defendant
does not comply with the Minute Order by June 24; and (4) that the Court set a
hearing for terminating sanctions.  
That motion was heard on June 18.  After reviewing the briefing and hearing
argument, the Court issued a minute order ruling (among other things) as
follows: (1) that Defendant was in violation of the May 1 Minute Order in that
Defendant had produced only low quality videos (which Plaintiff described as “horrendous”);
(2) that Defendant would remain in violation of the May 1 Minute Order until it
produced “videos of reasonable quality.” 
(Minute Order dated June 18, 2024 [the “June 18 Minute Order”], at p. 5.)  The Court granted Plaintiff’s request for
monetary sanctions, denied the request for daily trebling, and denied without
prejudice the request for the Court to set a hearing on sanctions.  (Id., at pp. 5-6.)
At the time, trial was set for June 24, 2024.  On June 24, the Court heard Plaintiff’s ex
parte application to continue trial so that Plaintiff could pursue further
motion practice regarding Defendant’s compliance (or lack thereof) with the May
1 Minute Order.  After hearing argument,
the Court granted the application and continued the trial date to November
7.  The Court further ordered “discovery
remains closed.”
On July 3, 2024, Plaintiff filed this motion for issue, evidence,
and terminating sanctions. Defendant filed an opposition on July 24.  No reply has been filed.
Legal Standard
“Every court shall have the power to … compel obedience to its
judgments, orders, and process, and to the orders of a judge out of court, in
an action or proceeding pending therein.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 128, subd. (a)(4).) 
“[I]f a party fails
to obey an order compelling further response [to a request for production], the
court may make those orders that are just, including the imposition of an issue
sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction under Chapter 7
….  In lieu of, or in addition to, that
sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 ….”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (i).)
In Chapter 7 of the
Civil Discovery Act, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.030, provides, in
pertinent part, “[t]o the extent authorized
by the chapter governing any particular discovery method or any other provision
of this title, the court, after notice to any affected party, person, or
attorney, and after opportunity for hearing, may impose … sanctions against
anyone engaging in conduct that is a misuse of the discovery process.”  Sanctions may include a monetary sanction, an issue sanction, an
evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction.
Section 2023.010
defines a “misuse of the discovery process” to include (among other things) failing
to respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery; making, without
substantial justification, an unmeritorious objection to discovery; making an
evasive response to a discovery request; disobeying a court order to provide
discovery; and making or opposing, unsuccessfully, a motion to compel without
substantial justification.
The Civil Discovery Act provides for an escalating and
“incremental approach to discovery sanctions, starting with monetary sanctions
and ending with the ultimate sanction of termination.” (Lopez v. Watchtower
Bible & Tract Society of New York, Inc. (2016) 246 Cal.App.4th
566, 604.) Discovery sanctions should be appropriate to and commensurate
with the misconduct, and they “should not exceed that which is required to
protect the interests of the party entitled to but denied discovery.” (Doppes
v. Bentley Motors, Inc. (2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 967, 992.) “If a lesser
sanction fails to curb misuse, a greater sanction is warranted: continuing
misuses of the discovery process warrant incrementally harsher sanctions until
the sanction is reached that will curb the abuse.” (Ibid.; see also,
e.g., Mileikowsky v. Tenet Healthsystem (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th
262, 279-280.) 
Terminating sanctions should be used sparingly. (Doppes, supra, 174
Cal.App.4th at p. 992; R.S. Creative, Inc. v. Creative Cotton, Ltd. (1999)
75 Cal. App. 4th 486, 496.) “Although in extreme cases a court has the
authority to order a terminating sanction as a first measure, a terminating
sanction should generally not be imposed until the court has attempted less
severe alternatives and found them to be unsuccessful and/or the record clearly
shows lesser sanctions would be ineffective.” (Lopez, supra, 246
Cal.App.4th at p. 604.)  But where discovery violations are
“willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less
severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the
trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction.” (Doppes, supra, 174
Cal.App.4th at p. 992.) Repeated and willful violations of discovery orders
that prejudice the opposing party may warrant a terminating sanction. (Creed-21
v. City of Wildomar (2017) 18 Cal.App.5th 690, 702; Los
Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 377, 390; Biles
v. Exxon Mobil Corp. (2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1327; Lang v.
Hachman (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 1225, 1246; Collisson X Kaplan
v. Hartunian (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 1611, 1617-1622.)
The primary purpose of discovery sanctions is to obtain compliance
with the Civil Discovery Act and the Court’s orders. It is not to punish. (Newland
v. Super. Ct. (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 608, 613; Ghanooni v.
Super Shuttle of Los Angeles (1993) 20 Cal.App.4th 256, 262.) A
discovery sanction should not create a “windfall” for a party or place a party
in a better position than it would have been if the opposing party had simply
complied with its obligations under the Court’s orders and the Civil Discovery
Act. (Rutledge v. Hewlett-Packard Co. (2015) 238 Cal.App.4th 1164,
1194; see also 2 Weil & Brown, California Practice Guide: Civil Procedure
Before Trial (The Rutter Group 2023), ¶¶ 8:2214-2220.) 
Discussion
On May
1, 2024, the Court granted Plaintiff’s motion to compel Defendant to produce documents
responding to Request No. 6.  Request No.
6 requests production of:
 
“Any and all DOCUMENTS relating to safety
training of new Costco Wholesale Corporation gas station attendants, in effect
at the time of the SUBJECT INCIDENT, including any training videos,
particularly the training video(s) related to handling gas spills.”
 
The
parties previously had a dispute regarding the quality of the videos that
Defendant produced.  That dispute has
been resolved.  The videos that Defendant
produced on June 20 and 21 are of reasonable quality.  (See Araj Decl., ¶¶ 9-10 & Exhs. G-H.)
 
Plaintiff
now brings this motion for evidence, issue, and terminating sanctions.  Plaintiff argues (among other things): (1)
that Defendant’s delay in producing the documents was prejudicial, particularly
given that discovery remains closed; and (2) that Defendant still has not
produced all training videos responsive to Request No. 6.
 
As to
the first issue, the request for evidence, issue, and terminating sanctions is
denied.  Now that Plaintiff has reviewed
the training videos that Defendant has produced, if Plaintiff contends that he
is prejudiced by not being able to pursue further discovery, Plaintiff has a full
and complete remedy: Plaintiff may file a motion to reopen discovery.  The requested sanctions, in contrast, would result
in a windfall to Plaintiff.
 
As to
the second issue, the Court is puzzled by Defendant’s position.  The Court granted the motion to compel on May
1, 2024.  All documents responsive to
Request No. 6 must be produced. 
Defendant may believe that certain documents are not relevant or
discoverable, but the Court has ruled. 
The documents must be produced, and if they have not been, then
Defendant is in violation of the May 1 Minute Order.
 
Having said
that, Plaintiff’s motion for evidence, issue, and terminating sanctions as to
these additional documents is denied without prejudice.  Plaintiff has not, on this record, made a
sufficient showing of prejudice from the failure to produce these documents as
to support the imposition of non-monetary sanctions.  On this record, it appears that such
sanctions would result in a windfall to Plaintiff.
 
Finally,
the Court rejects Defendant’s argument that this motion is untimely.  The ex parte application to continue trial,
which the Court granted, was based (at least in part) on Plaintiff’s contention
that he needed additional time to bring a motion for sanctions for Defendant’s
violations of the May 1 Minute Order. 
That is precisely what this motion seeks.
 
Conclusion
 
The Court DENIES Plaintiff’s request for evidence, issue,
or terminating sanctions.
 
The motion is denied without prejudice as it relates to
Defendant’s violation of the May 1 Minute Order by failing to produce training
videos response to Request No. 6.
 
Moving
Party is ordered to give notice.
