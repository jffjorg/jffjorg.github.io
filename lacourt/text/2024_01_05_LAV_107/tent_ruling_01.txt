COURT’S
  [TENTATIVE] ORDER RE: 
 
MOTION TO BE RELIEVED AS COUNSEL



 
[THE FOLLOWING IS A TENTATIVE RULING IN THE ABOVE CASE]: 
 
[Tentative] Ruling
 
The Court GRANTS the
motion to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff NRG Builders, Inc. (“NRG”) filed
by Daniel Krishel (“Krishel”).
 
Given that
Plaintiff NRG is a corporation, on its own motion, the Court sets an OSC re:
Plaintiff NRG retaining new counsel for Friday, February 9, 2024 at 8:30 AM in
this department. 
 
BACKGROUND
 
This action arises from alleged wrongful
actions concerning a business agreement. On October 15, 2021, Plaintiffs Udi
Gannot and NRG Builders, Inc. (“NRG”) (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) filed a
Complaint against Defendants Lior Edri, Hila Edri, Keystone Remodeling, Inc.,
TLV Marketing, Inc., Isabelle Maadi, Ofir Attal, Yaniv Lanczet, Mos Property
Preservation, Inc. dba LMX Builders, Oren Kirshenboim, KLK Marketing LLC,
Rozalin Zafarty, and Does 1 to 20, alleging causes of action for: (1)
Intentional Inference with Contractual Relations, (2) Intentional Interference
with Prospective Economic Advantage, (3) Negligent Interference with
Prospective Economic Advantage, (4) Fraud, (5) Negligence, (6) Breach of Oral
Contract, (7) Breach of Fiduciary Duty, (8) Conversion, (9) Accounting, (10)
Usurpation of Corporate Opportunity, (11) Unfair Competition, (12) Conspiracy
to Breach Fiduciary Duty, and (13) Aiding and Abetting.  
 
On November 29, 2023, counsel for Plaintiff
NRG, Daniel Krishel (“Krishel”) filed a motion to be relieved as counsel for
Plaintiff NRG. The motion is unopposed. 
 
 
LEGAL STANDARD
 
The court may order that an attorney be changed or
substituted at any time before or after judgment or final determination upon
request by either client or attorney and after notice from one to the other.
(Code of Civ. Proc., § 284(2).) “The determination whether to grant or deny a
motion to withdraw as counsel lies within the sound discretion of the trial
court.” (Manfredi & Levine v. Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th
1128, 1133.)   
 
An application to
be relieved as counsel must be made on Judicial Counsel Form MC-051 (Notice of
Motion and Motion) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(a)), MC-052 (Declaration)
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(c)), and MC-053 (Proposed Order) (Cal. Rules
of Court, rule 3.1362(e)).   The proposed order must specify all
hearing dates scheduled in the action or proceeding, including the date of
trial, if known. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(e).) 
 
Further, the
requisite forms must be served on the client and all other parties who have
appeared in the case. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(d).) The
court may delay the effective date of the order relieving counsel until proof
of service of a copy of the signed order on the client has been filed with the
court. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(e).) The Court has
discretion on whether to allow an attorney to withdraw, and a motion to
withdraw will not be granted where withdrawal would prejudice the client.  (Ramirez
v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915.)  
 
 
DISCUSSION 
 
Counsel has filed
the requisite forms pursuant to CRC Rule 3.1362. Krishel declares that
Plaintiff NRG is “unable to comply with the terms of the [retainer] agreement
and additional atty-client conflict of interest exists.” (Form MC-052.) Krishel
further declares that Plaintiff NRG’s “principal, Plaintiff Udi Gannot has not
signed [a] substitution of attorney form and now represents himself in pro per;
[and] [the] motion is filed because [the] corporation is not able to represent
itself in pro per.” (Form MC-052.)  
 
In light of the
facts above, the Court GRANTS Krishel’s motion to be relieved as counsel for
Plaintiff NRG. 
 
As a corporation,
however, Plaintiff NRG cannot appear in this case without an attorney because
“a corporation, unlike a natural person, cannot represent itself before courts
of record in propria persona, nor can it represent itself through a corporate
officer, director or other employee who is not an attorney. It must be
represented by licensed counsel in proceedings before courts of record.” (CLD
Construction, Inc. v. City of San Ramon (2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 1141, 1146
[citation omitted].) 
 
For that reason, Krishel is to notify Plaintiff NRG
of this fact, and of the setting on the Court’s own motion of an OSC re:
Plaintiff NRG retaining new counsel for Friday, February 9, 2024 at 8:30 AM in
this department. 
 
CONCLUSION
 
The motion to be
relieved as counsel filed by Krishel is GRANTED.
 
Krishel is ordered
to give notice.
