And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion to correct the administrative record and to reopen the administrative hearing. The petition was filed by Luther Hung-Ming Yang, who was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol and had his driver's license suspended. Yang's treating psychiatrist and therapist submitted declarations stating that Yang was diagnosed with Bipolar I Disorder and was likely in a manic state during the arrest, which would have rendered him unable to understand the implications of refusing a chemical breath or blood test.

The judge found that Yang's diagnosis was relevant to the issue of whether he had capacity to refuse the test and that Yang could not have presented this evidence during the initial administrative hearing. The judge also found that Yang's treating professionals could opine on the effect of Yang's condition on his ability to consent to the test, despite not being present during the arrest.

The judge noted that Yang's request to reopen the hearing was filed before the deadline, but the date of the request was incorrect in the petition. The judge allowed the request to reopen the hearing and admitted the supporting evidence for the purposes of adjudicating the writ petition during the upcoming hearing.
