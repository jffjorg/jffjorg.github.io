And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling in the case Sean Renaud v. County of Los Angeles (22STCP01143) is to continue the petition for writ of mandate to April 9, 2024, at 1:30 PM. The petition was filed on February 29, 2024. The Judge notes that both parties failed to satisfy the requirement of Local Rule 3.231(i)(1) by not stating their positions on whether they are seeking traditional or administrative mandamus. As a result, the Judge orders simultaneous supplemental briefing on the issue. The briefing should address whether the Court should review the writ petition under CCP § 1085 (traditional mandamus), CCP § 1094.5 (administrative mandamus), or both, as well as how the standard of review under the applicable statute(s) affects the Court's ruling. Additionally, the briefing should address whether Sean Renaud was carrying out his official duties and responsibilities with respect to the incident that is the subject of the petition.
