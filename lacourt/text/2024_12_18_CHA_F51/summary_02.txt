And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling is that the demurrer filed by Moving Defendants, PHH Mortgage Corporation, Deutsche Bank National Trust Company, and Morgan Stanley ABS Capital I Inc. Trust 2006-HE8 Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2006-HE8, is sustained without leave to amend. The demurrer is against the sixth cause of action in the First Amended Complaint (FAC) filed by Mark Gomez and Juanita Gomez, which seeks injunctive relief against the Trustee's Sale of the Subject Property.

The Court finds that Plaintiffs have failed to allege facts sufficient to state a cause of action for injunctive relief against Moving Defendants. The Court agrees with Moving Defendants that Plaintiffs have alleged no wrongdoing by Moving Defendants in this action. The Court notes that Plaintiffs have failed to file any opposition to the instant demurrer.

The Court also finds that there is no reasonable possibility that Plaintiffs can successfully remedy the underlying deficiencies in their sixth cause of action against Moving Defendants. Therefore, the demurrer is sustained without leave to amend.
