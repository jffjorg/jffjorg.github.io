And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the motion filed by Counsel, Michael Burgis, to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff, Amparo Rujeles, is continued pending Counsel providing proof of service of the motion and accompanying papers on Plaintiff. The motion was filed on August 1, 2024, and Counsel declares that the motion and papers were mailed to Plaintiff's last known address. However, the Court notes that Counsel has not filed any proof of service with the Court. The judge also notes that the next hearing date is a case management conference and order to show cause regarding Plaintiff's failure to appear, and no trial date has been set, so Counsel's withdrawal does not raise the risk of unduly prejudicing his client. The judge finds that Counsel has not satisfied the statutory requirements for the instant motion and continues the motion pending Counsel providing the required proof of service. The motion is continued to April 29, 2025.
