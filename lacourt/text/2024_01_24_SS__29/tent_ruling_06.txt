Background 
 
On December
23, 2021, Plaintiff Janice Cannon (“Plaintiff”) filed the Complaint in this
action asserting one cause of action for premises liability against Defendant QIC US Management, Inc. dba
Victoria Gardens Mall (“Defendant”)
and Does 1 through 20. The alleged trip and fall
incident described in the Complaint occurred on January 9, 2020.  Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint
(the “FAC”) on June 2, 2022, asserting the same cause of action against the
same defendants.
 
On March 8,
2023, Defendant filed this motion for summary judgment.
 
Plaintiff
did not file any opposition to the motion.
 
Legal Standard

“The purpose of the law of summary judgment is to provide courts with a
mechanism to cut through the parties’ pleadings in order to determine whether,
despite their allegations, trial is in fact necessary to resolve their
dispute.” (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826,
843.) Code of Civil Procedure section 437c, subdivision (c), “requires the
trial judge to grant summary judgment if all the evidence submitted, and ‘all
inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence’ and uncontradicted by other
inferences or evidence, show that there is no triable issue as to any material
fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” (Adler
v. Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.) “The function
of the pleadings in a motion for summary judgment is to delimit the scope of
the issues; the function of the affidavits or declarations is to disclose
whether there is any triable issue of fact within the issues delimited by the
pleadings.” (Juge v. County of Sacramento (1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 59, 67,
citing FPI Development, Inc. v. Nakashima (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 367,
381-382.)
As to each cause
of action as framed by the complaint, a defendant moving for summary judgment
or summary adjudication must satisfy the initial burden of proof by presenting
facts to show “that one or more elements of the cause of action ... cannot be
established, or that there is a complete defense to the cause of action.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2); see also Aguilar, supra, 25
Cal.4th at pp. 850-851; Scalf v. D. B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128
Cal.App.4th 1510, 1520.) Once the defendant has met that burden, the burden
shifts to the plaintiff to show that a “triable issue of one or more material
facts exists as to the cause of action or a defense thereto.” (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 437c, subd. (p)(2); see also Aguilar, supra, 25 Cal.4th at pp.
850-851.)
A plaintiff or
cross-complainant moving for summary judgment or summary adjudication must
satisfy the initial burden of proof by presenting facts to show “that there is
no defense to a cause of action if that party has proved each element of the
cause of action entitling the party to judgment on the cause of action.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(1).) Once the plaintiff or cross-complainant has
met that burden, the burden shift to the defendant or cross-defendant to show
that a “triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to the cause of
action or a defense thereto.” (Ibid.)
The party opposing
a motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication may not simply “rely upon
the allegations or denials of its pleadings” but must instead “set forth the
specific facts showing that a triable issue of material fact exists.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 437c, subds. (p)(1) & (p)(2).) To establish a triable issue of
material fact, the party opposing the motion must produce substantial
responsive evidence. (Sangster v. Paetkau (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 151,
166.)
Courts “liberally construe the evidence in support of the
party opposing summary judgment and resolve doubts concerning the evidence in
favor of that party.” (Dore v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc. (2006) 39 Cal.4th
384, 389.)
Discussion
Plaintiff trip and fell on January
9, 2020, outside Brio Tuscan Grille Restaurant at Victoria Gardens Mall in
Rancho Cucamonga. (Statement of Undisputed Facts (“UMF”), No. 1.) Plaintiff
claims her trip and fall was due to a raised brick transition. (UMF, No. 4.) 
The area where Plaintiff fell
is a transition area where concrete meets a red brick walkway. (UMF, No. 8.)
The weather was sunny and dry on the day of Plaintiff’s fall. (UMF, No. 9.) The
area of the fall was not wet. (UMF, No. 10.) There was no debris on the ground
where she fell. (UMF, No. 11.) Plaintiff has traversed this walkway before
without difficulty. (UMF, No. 14.) 
On August 10, 2022, Defense
Expert Herbet Summers took measurements of the height differential in front of
Brio Tuscan Grille restaurant; the height differential measured three-eighths
to one-half inch. (UMF, No. 17 & 18.) 
On, December 8, 2022, Mr.
Summers returned to the area after Plaintiff’s deposition to measure the spot
she testified to falling; the height differential was less than one-fourth
inch. (UMF, No. 19 & 21.) There were no jagged edges located at the area in
question where Plaintiff fell. (UMF, No. 24.) There are no light concerns at
the area where Plaintiff fell. (UMF, No. 25.) There are no visual obstructions.
(UMF, No. 27.) Defendant states there were no incident reports as to a trip and
fall at the area where Plaintiff fell. (UMF, No. 31.) Defendant is unaware of
any falls from 2006 through the date of the incident in front of Brio Tuscan
Grille Restaurant. (UMF, No. 32.) 
The
elements of a cause of action for premises liability are the same as those for
negligence: duty, breach, causation, and damages.¿¿(Castellon v. U.S.
Bancorp¿(2013) 220 Cal.App.4th 994, 998.)¿¿Those who own, possess, or
control property generally have a duty to exercise ordinary care in managing
the property¿to¿avoid exposing others to an unreasonable risk of harm.¿¿(Annocki¿v.
Peterson Enterprises, LLC¿(2014) 232 Cal.App.4th 32, 37.)¿¿The existence
and scope of duty are legal questions for the court.¿¿(Id.¿at¿36.)¿¿    
Defendant moves for summary
judgment on the following grounds:
(1) 
There is no evidence Defendant breached its
duty of care;
(2) 
There is no evidence that any dangerous
condition existed in the walkway of the subject property as alleged by
Plaintiff (outside the Brio Tuscan Grille Restaurant at the Victoria Gardens
Mall located at 12370 S. Main Street, Rancho Cucamonga, CA 91739);
(3) 
The condition alleged by Plaintiff measures
between ½ inch to 3/8 inch at the location initially thought to be the area of
Plaintiff’s fall, and measured less than ¼ inch height differential at the
location identified by Plaintiff during deposition; both measurements are
trivial;
(4) 
Defendant QIC was not on actual or
constructive notice of the condition.
(Motion, 1:9-18.)
“It is well established that
a property owner is not liable for damages caused by a minor, trivial or
insignificant defect in property.”  (Caloroso
v. Hathaway (2004) 122 Cal.App.4th 922, 927.)  In determining whether a defect is trivial,
“[w]here reasonable minds can reach only one conclusion—that there was no
substantial risk of injury—the issue is a question of law, properly resolved by
way of summary judgment.”  (Id. at
p. 929.)  
Where
a plaintiff alleges a cause of action based upon a defect in a sidewalk or
other walkway, courts generally begin their analysis by considering the size of
the defect.  The size of the height differential,
rise, or other defect is often the “most important” factor.  (Stack v. City of Lemoore (2023) 91
Cal.App.5th 102, 111; see also Huckey v. City of Temecula (2019)
37 Cal.App.5th 1092, 1105 [stating that size of defect “may be one of the most
relevant factors”].)  As the Court of
Appeal has explained, however, “[i]n determining whether a given walkway defect
is trivial as a matter of law, the court should not rely
solely upon the size of the defect.”  (Huckey,
supra, 37 Cal.App.5th at p. 1105 [emphasis in original].)  “[A] tape measure alone cannot be used to
determine whether the defect was trivial.” 
(Caloroso, supra, 122 Cal.App.4th at p. 927.)  Rather, a “court should consider other circumstances
which might have rendered the defect a dangerous condition at the time of the
accident.”  (Huckey, supra, 37 Cal.App.5th at p. 1105.) 
“These other circumstances or factors include whether there were any broken
pieces or jagged edges in the area of the defect, whether any dirt, debris or
other material obscured a pedestrian’s view of the defect, the plaintiff’s
knowledge of the area, whether the accident occurred at night or in an
unlighted area, the weather at the time of the accident, and whether the defect
has caused any other accidents.”  (Ibid.) 
Here, the undisputed evidence
in the record establishes that the size of the defect was no greater than
one-half inch.  “Several decisions have
found height differentials of up to one and one-half inches trivial as a matter
of law.” (Stathoulis v. City of Montebello (2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 559, 568,
citing Barrett v. City of Claremont (1953) 41 Cal.2d 70, 74 [in
the absence of aggravating conditions, differential of less than half an inch
deemed trivial]; see also Caloroso, supra, 122 Cal.App.4th at p. 927
[elevation difference of under half an inch]; Fielder v. City of Glendale (1977)
71 Cal.App.3d 719, 724, fn. 4 [same]; Whiting v. City of National City
(1937) 9 Cal.2d 163, 165–166 [elevation difference of a maximum of
three-fourths of an inch]; Nicholson v. City of Los Angeles (1936) 5
Cal.2d 361, 367 [one and one-half inch elevation difference].)
Moreover, there were no aggravating
circumstances or other factors that made the defect more dangerous than its
size alone would indicate.  (UMF, Nos. 9-11,
14, 24-25, 27.) 
Under these circumstances,
and considering all of the evidence in the record, the Court concludes Defendant
has met its burden of establishing that the defect in the walkway was trivial
as a matter of law, and that therefore Defendant did not breach any duty of
care to Plaintiff.
This shifts the burden to
Plaintiff to show that
a triable issue of material fact exists as to whether the defect was
trivial.  As Plaintiff has not filed
any opposition, she has not met that burden.
Accordingly, the Court GRANTS
Defendant’s motion for summary judgment.
Conclusion
Defendant’s
motion for summary judgment is GRANTED.
 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice.
