Summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge has granted the Defendant's motion for summary judgment, finding that the Defendant did not breach any duty of care to the Plaintiff. The Judge determined that the defect in the walkway was trivial as a matter of law, and that there were no aggravating circumstances or other factors that made the defect more dangerous than its size alone would indicate. The Plaintiff did not file any opposition to the motion, so the Judge did not consider any triable issues of material fact. Therefore, the Court grants the Defendant's motion for summary judgment.
