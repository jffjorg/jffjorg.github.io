And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendants' motion to continue the trial, which was scheduled for March 20, 2024. The defendants had previously filed a motion for summary judgment, which is set for hearing on September 20, 2024, six months after the current trial date. The judge found that the defendants have shown good cause for a continuance, citing the need for additional time to prepare for trial. The judge has continued the trial to a date on or after October 20, 2024, and has reset the final status conference and all deadlines based on the new trial date.
