 Case Number:  20STCV38778    Hearing Date:   January 24, 2024    Dept:  29 Motion to Dismiss (Terminating Sanctions) filed by Defendant
Smart & Final Stores, LLC.
 
Tentative
 
Defendant’s motion to dismiss is DENIED.
 
Background
This case arises out of an alleged incident on October 9,
2018, in which Plaintiff Martha Huezo (“Plaintiff”) fell on an unsafe floor at
a Smart & Final store.  Plaintiff
filed the Complaint in this action on October 8, 2020, asserting one cause of
action for negligence against Defendants Smart & Final Stores LLC
(“Defendant”), Smart & Final LLC, and Does 1 through 50.  
 
Defendant filed its Answer on April 20, 2022.
 
On July 3, 2023, Defendant served Plaintiff
with Supplemental Interrogatories (Set One) and Supplemental Requests for
Production of Documents (Set One).  (Blozan
Decl., ¶ 2.)  Plaintiff did not
respond.  On October 6, 2023, the Court
granted Defendant’s motions to compel, ordered Plaintiff to respond within 30
days, and sanctioned Plaintiff $925. 
Plaintiff still has not responded to this discovery, and the sanctions
have not been paid.  (Id., ¶ 4.)
On December 6, 2023, Defendant filed this
motion to dismiss (terminating sanctions). 
No opposition has been filed.
Trial is scheduled for June 10, 2024.
Legal Standard
“To the extent authorized by the chapter governing any particular
discovery method or any other provision of this title, the court, after notice
to any affected party, person, or attorney, and after opportunity for hearing,
may impose the following sanctions against anyone engaging in conduct that is a
misuse of the discovery process: ... (d) The court may impose a terminating
sanction …."  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030.) “Misuses of the
discovery process include, but are not limited to, the following: ... (d)
Failing to respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery. ... (g)
Disobeying a court order to provide discovery."  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2023.010.)
The Civil Discovery Act provides for an escalating and
“incremental approach to discovery sanctions, starting with monetary sanctions
and ending with the ultimate sanction of termination.” (Lopez v. Watchtower
Bible & Tract Society of New York, Inc. (2016) 246 Cal.App.4th
566, 604.) Discovery sanctions should be appropriate to and commensurate
with the misconduct, and they “should not exceed that which is required to
protect the interests of the party entitled to but denied discovery.” (Doppes
v. Bentley Motors, Inc. (2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 967, 992.) “If a lesser
sanction fails to curb misuse, a greater sanction is warranted: continuing
misuses of the discovery process warrant incrementally harsher sanctions until
the sanction is reached that will curb the abuse.” (Ibid.; see also,
e.g., Mileikowsky v. Tenet Healthsystem (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th
262, 279-280.) 
Terminating sanctions should be used sparingly. (Doppes, supra, 174
Cal.App.4th at p. 992; R.S. Creative, Inc. v. Creative Cotton, Ltd. (1999)
75 Cal. App. 4th 486, 496.) “Although in extreme cases a court has the
authority to order a terminating sanction as a first measure, a terminating
sanction should generally not be imposed until the court has attempted less
severe alternatives and found them to be unsuccessful and/or the record clearly
shows lesser sanctions would be ineffective.” (Lopez, supra, 246 Cal.App.4th
at p. 604.)  But where discovery violations are “willful,
preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe
sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial
court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction.” (Doppes, supra, 174
Cal.App.4th at p. 992.) Repeated and willful violations of discovery orders
that prejudice the opposing party may warrant a terminating sanction. (Creed-21
v. City of Wildomar (2017) 18 Cal.App.5th 690, 702; Los
Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 377, 390; Biles
v. Exxon Mobil Corp. (2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1327; Lang v.
Hachman (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 1225, 1246; Collisson X Kaplan
v. Hartunian (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 1611, 1617-1622.)
The
primary purpose of discovery sanctions is to obtain compliance with the Civil
Discovery Act and the Court’s orders. It is not to punish. (Newland v.
Super. Ct. (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 608, 613; Ghanooni v. Super
Shuttle of Los Angeles (1993) 20 Cal.App.4th 256, 262.) A discovery
sanction should not create a “windfall” for a party or place a party in a
better position than it would have been if the opposing party had simply
complied with its obligations under the Court’s orders and the Civil Discovery
Act. (Rutledge v. Hewlett-Packard Co. (2015) 238 Cal.App.4th 1164,
1194; see also 2 Weil & Brown, California Practice Guide: Civil Procedure
Before Trial (The Rutter Group 2023), ¶¶ 8:2214-2220.)
A ”terminating
sanction issued solely because of a failure to pay a monetary discovery
sanction is never justified.”  (Newland,
supra, 40 Cal.App.4th at p. 615.) 
Discussion
Defendant
moves for terminating sanctions against Plaintiff for failing to respond to
discovery requests as well as failing to comply with this Court’s order to
respond to discovery requests.  Defendant
does not seek monetary sanctions or any other form of non-monetary sanctions.
Defendant
initially served Plaintiff with the discovery at issue in July 2023.  (Blozan Decl., ¶ 2.)  After six months and one order granting a
motion to compel, Plaintiff still has not responded.  
This is substantial discovery abuse.  Plaintiff has failed to comply with her obligations
to respond to discovery under the Civil Discovery Act.  Compounding this failure, Plaintiff has also
now failed to comply with this Court’s Order of October 6, 2023.  Serious sanctions are warranted for this
conduct.  
For terminating sanctions, however, a party must
present evidence of repeated and willful misuse of the discovery process, as
well as evidence that less severe sanctions have
not (or likely will not) lead to compliance with the discovery rules.  Defendant has not, on this record at this
time, made such a showing.  There has not been a showing of a history or pattern of
willful abuse or repeated violations that have not been (or cannot be) cured by
lesser sanctions.  
Moreover, a discovery sanction should not
create a “windfall” for a party or place a party in a better position than it
would have been if the opposing party had simply complied with its obligations
under the Court’s orders and the Civil Discovery Act. (Rutledge, supra, 238
Cal.App.4th at p. 1194.)  Here, at this
time, a terminating sanction would create such a windfall for Defendant. 
Defendant
does not seek any lesser sanction.  
Accordingly,
the motion is DENIED.
The
denial is without prejudice to Defendant seeking other sanctions, or seeking a
terminating sanction at a later stage of the proceedings, based on a further
showing of misuse of the discovery process.
Conclusion
Defendant’s
motion is DENIED.
Defendant
is ordered to give notice.
