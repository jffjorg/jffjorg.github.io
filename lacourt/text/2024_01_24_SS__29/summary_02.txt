Here is the summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the defendant's motion to dismiss the case and impose terminating sanctions against the plaintiff. The case involves an alleged incident on October 9, 2018, where the plaintiff, Martha Huezo, fell on an unsafe floor at a Smart & Final store. The plaintiff filed a complaint on October 8, 2020, and the defendant filed its answer on April 20, 2022.

The defendant served the plaintiff with discovery requests in July 2023, but the plaintiff failed to respond. The court granted the defendant's motion to compel and ordered the plaintiff to respond within 30 days. The plaintiff still did not respond, and the court sanctioned the plaintiff $925. The defendant filed a motion to dismiss the case, alleging that the plaintiff's failure to respond to discovery requests and comply with the court's order is a misuse of the discovery process.

The judge found that the plaintiff's failure to respond to discovery requests is a serious discovery abuse, but denied the defendant's motion to dismiss because the defendant did not provide evidence of repeated and willful misuse of the discovery process, as well as evidence that less severe sanctions would not lead to compliance with the discovery rules. The judge also noted that a terminating sanction would create a windfall for the defendant and would not serve the purpose of obtaining compliance with the discovery rules.
