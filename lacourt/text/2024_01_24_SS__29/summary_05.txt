And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied as moot Defendant Ocampo's request for an order compelling additional physical examinations of Plaintiff. However, the judge has granted Defendant Ocampo's request for an order compelling Plaintiff to submit to a mental examination by Dr. J. Vincent Filoteo, subject to certain conditions.

The conditions of the mental examination include allowing Plaintiff to record the examination by audio technology, and requiring Defendant Ocampo to provide Plaintiff with a copy of the detailed written report setting out the history, examinations, findings, including the results of all tests made, diagnoses, prognoses, and conclusions of the examination. The judge has also ordered that the raw data and testing materials be disclosed to Plaintiff's counsel, subject to a protective order, to ensure that Plaintiff has access to the material she needs to cross-examine Defendant's expert and prepare for trial.

The judge has also ordered that the examination take place within 30 days of notice, and that the parties must maintain the security of the raw data, test materials, and other medically private information obtained during the examination.
