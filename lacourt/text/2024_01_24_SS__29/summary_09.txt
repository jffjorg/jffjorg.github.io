And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies as moot Austin Forsyth's motions to compel Janet Dorine Hart to respond to special interrogatories, form interrogatories, and requests for production of documents. Hart has now served initial responses to the discovery requests, making the motions unnecessary. The judge also denies Forsyth's motion for an order deeming admitted as true the matters specified in the requests for admission, as Hart served responses to the requests for admission prior to the hearing that are in substantial compliance with the law.

The judge grants in part Forsyth's requests for sanctions, ordering Hart and her counsel to pay monetary sanctions to Forsyth in the total amount of $952.50. The judge notes that Hart's failure to serve responses to the discovery requests within the time permitted was not substantially justified and would not be unjust to impose a monetary sanction.
