And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has taken the motion to vacate default filed by defendant Magdalena Olivia Garcia, et al. off the calendar. The motion was due to be heard on March 5, 2024, but defendant has failed to file the required moving papers in support of the motion. As a result, the court will proceed with the default judgment prove-up hearing as scheduled. The court's decision is based on California Code of Civil Procedure section 1005, which requires moving papers to be filed on or before a certain date. Defendant's lack of compliance with this requirement has led to the motion being taken off the calendar.
