The court notes that there can only be one prevailing party for purposes of an attorneys' fees award, and that Palo Woods obtained the majority of the relief it sought in the action. The court also finds that Fitness's arguments are inconsistent with the court's previous ruling on Palo Woods's motion for attorneys' fees. Therefore, the court denies the motion and orders Fitness to give notice.
