Summary:

The tentative ruling is regarding a motion for summary judgment filed by Hafele America Co. (the "Plaintiff") against Alcom Intermodal, Inc. (the "Defendant") in an unlawful detainer action. The Plaintiff is seeking summary judgment for past due rent in the amount of $159,000. The Defendant opposes the motion, arguing that the proof of service of the moving papers was at the wrong address, the amount of rent due is a disputed question of fact, and there are questions of fact concerning whether the Plaintiff has status to sue. The Court finds that the Plaintiff failed to meet its burden of proof regarding service of the moving papers and that the Defendant's arguments regarding the calculation of late fees and its standing to sue raise triable issues of material fact. The Court will hear argument on these issues at the hearing and will grant summary judgment if the Plaintiff is able to resolve these issues.
