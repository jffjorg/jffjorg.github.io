      CASE NO: 23LBCV01016
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING
  DEFENDANT’S UNOPPOSED MOTIONS TO COMPEL 
 
Dept. S27
8:30 a.m.
March 5, 2024



 
Moving Party:               Defendant, Sally Larson
Opposing Party:           No
opposition
Notice:                         OK
 
Defendant propounded form
interrogatories and special interrogatories on Plaintiff on 10/26/23.  To date, despite an attempt to meet and
confer, Plaintiff has not served responses. 
Defendant therefore seeks an order compelling Plaintiff to respond,
without objections, to the outstanding discovery and to pay sanctions.
 
Defendant’s motions are
granted.  Plaintiff is ordered to serve
verified responses to form interrogatories and special interrogatories, without
objections, within fourteen days.  CCP
§§2030.290(a),(b).  
 
Sanctions are mandatory.  §2030.290(c). 
Defendant seeks sanctions in the amount of $1330/motion against
Plaintiff and her attorney of record, jointly and severally.  Defense Counsel bills at the rate of $250/hour.  The Court awards the requested one hour to
prepare each motion.  No opposition was
filed and therefore no time to review the opposition or file a reply is
awarded.  Counsel requests two hours to
travel to and attend the hearing.  The Court
strongly encourages remote appearance, and therefore awards one hour for the
remote appearance in connection with both motions; if Counsel chooses to appear
in person, this is Defendant’s choice, and it would not be reasonable to pass
on that additional cost to Plaintiff.  No
parking fee is awarded as, again, the Court strongly encourages remote
appearance.  The Court awards a total of three
hours of attorney time at the rate of $250/hour, or $750, in attorneys’ fees.  The Court also awards two filing fees of $60
each, or $120 in costs.  
 
Sanctions are sought and imposed against
Plaintiff and her attorney of record, jointly and severally; they are ordered
to pay sanctions to Defendant, by and through her attorney of record, in the
total amount of $870, within twenty days. 
   
 
As a final note, the Court sees that
Defendant has another motion to compel responses to special interrogatories on
calendar on 4/02/24.  This motion appears
to be duplicative of the motion being heard today.  It is brought by the same defendant (Sally
Larson) against the same plaintiff (Eman Mahmoud).  Both motions seek to compel initial responses
to SROGs, set one.  Both motions seek
$1330 in sanctions.  Assuming the Court
is correct, and the 4/02/24 motion is duplicative of today’s motion, the Court
asks Defendant to take the motion off calendar forthwith.  
 
Defendant is ordered to give
notice.
 
Parties who intend to submit
on this tentative must send an email to the court at sscdept31@lacourt.org indicating intention to submit on the
tentative as directed by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department
does not receive an email indicating the parties are submitting on the
tentative and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion may be placed
off calendar.  If a party submits on
the tentative, the party’s email must include the case number and must identify
the party submitting on the tentative.
