Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer and motion to strike directed at a First Amended Complaint filed by Plaintiff Anthony SIlletti against Defendants Stretch's Speed Shop, Inc. and William Farnham. The demurrer is brought by the defendants and challenges the sufficiency of the plaintiff's complaint. The Judge finds that the plaintiff has properly pled a cause of action for fraud by concealment and overrules the demurrer to that cause of action. However, the Judge sustains the demurrer to the fourth cause of action for conversion, which alleges that the defendants converted the plaintiff's money by not performing the work contracted for. The Judge grants leave to amend the complaint to plead the exact amount paid to the defendants. The Judge also denies the defendants' motion to strike the plaintiff's prayer for punitive damages. Finally, the Judge orders the parties to meet and confer before filing any responsive pleadings.
