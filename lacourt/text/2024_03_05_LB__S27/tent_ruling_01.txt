      CASE NO: 21LBCV00083
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER RE: MOTION
  FOR ATTORNEYS’ FEES
 
Dept. S27
8:30 a.m.
March 5, 2024




 

a.    
Parties’ Positions 

Fitness seeks to recover attorneys’
fees expended defending against Palo Woods’s claims for fraud, negligent
misrepresentation, and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair
dealing, contending it prevailed on these claims (Palo Woods dismissed them in
the face of a pending summary adjudication motion), and the parties’ contract
entitles it to recover the fees incurred defending the claims.

 

Palo Woods opposes the motion.  It argues there can be but one prevailing
party in an action, and the Court has already adjudicated it to be the prevailing
party.  It contends the fees incurred
cannot, in any event, be apportioned.

 

In reply, Fitness contends the Court
has expressly reserved the determination of whether Fitness prevailed on the subject
claims.  It contends it clearly did.  Finally, it contends there is a bright line
for awarding the fees, which is when Palo Woods added the tort-based claims to
the litigation.  It contends Palo Woods
has not challenged the amount of the fees, and therefore they should be awarded
in full.

 

b.    
Costs

As an initial note, Fitness seeks to recover costs by way of the motion.  As Palo Woods correctly notes in opposition
to the motion, costs are recoverable by way of a memorandum of costs.  CRC 3.1700. 
Fitness does not address this argument in reply.  The Court will not award costs in connection
with this motion.    

 

c.    
Analysis

Palo Woods correctly notes, in opposition
to the motion, that there can only be one prevailing party for purposes of an
attorneys’ fees award, and the Court already found the prevailing party for
such purposes was Palo Woods.  See 1/25/24
order.  

 

Civil Code §1717(a) expressly contemplates
an award of fees to “the” prevailing party. 
There is nothing in the statute suggesting one party could prevail for
purposes of part of the action and another party for purposes of another part
of the action.  Notably, there are myriad
cases discussing the Court’s role in awarding attorneys’ fees when one party
obtains less than a compete victory in the action.  The Rutter Guide, Civil Trials and Evidence,
§§17:837, et seq., explains the following in this regard:

If neither party achieves a complete
victory on all the contract claims, it is within the trial court's discretion
to determine which party “prevailed” on the contract. [ Scott Co. of Calif. v.
Blount, Inc. (1999) 20 C4th 1103, 1109, 86 CR2d 614, 618;  De La Cuesta v. Benham (2011) 193 CA4th 1287,
1294, 123 CR3d 453, 457;  Jackson v.
Homeowners Ass'n Monte Vista Estates-East (2001) 93 CA4th 773, 786-789, 113
CR2d 363, 372-375]

In deciding that issue, the court
must “compare the relief awarded on the contract claim or claims with the parties'
demands on those same claims and their litigation objectives as disclosed by
the pleadings, trial briefs, opening statements, and similar sources” [ Hsu v.
Abbara (1995) 9 C4th 863, 876, 39 CR2d 824, 833; see  Marina Pacifica Homeowners Ass'n v. Southern
Calif. Fin'l Corp. (2018) 20 CA5th 191, 204, 228 CR3d 799, 808—settlement
communications between parties do not constitute “pleadings, trial briefs,
opening statements, and similar sources” for purposes of this comparison
(internal quotes omitted); trial court did not abuse its discretion by finding
no prevailing party for purposes of awarding attorney fees under  Civ.C. § 1717; Harris v. Rojas (2021) 66
CA5th 817, 820, 281 CR3d 452, 454—“[w]hen the demand is $200,000 and the
verdict is $6,450 or less, the trial judge has discretion to decide the
‘victory’ is pyrrhic and nobody won” (denial of fee request on ground there was
no prevailing party affirmed)]

1) [17:838] Effect of lopsided
result: When there is a clear winner (i.e., a lopsided result where one party
obtains “greater relief” than the other in comparative terms), it may be an
abuse of discretion for the trial court to find that the party is not the
“prevailing party.” [ De La Cuesta v. Benham, supra, 193 CA4th at 1295-1296,
123 CR3d at 458-459—but no fixed line exists in determining how “lopsided” the
result must be to make one party clear winner (even so, line was crossed in
this case)]

 


Fitness argues the Court expressly
reserved judgment on this issue when it ruled on 1/245/24 on Palo Woods’s
motion for attorneys’ fees.  The Court
did reserve judgment on the issue.  A ruling
granting Fitness’s motion, however, would be in express violation of the Court’s
1/25/24 finding that Palo Woods was the prevailing party on the action.  Additionally, the Court, even with the benefit
of the briefs before it in connection with this motion, would continue to find that
Palo Woods, not Fitness, meets the above definition of prevailing party.  Palo Woods obtained the majority of the
relief it sought in the action, and was therefore properly classified as the
prevailing party on the action for purposes of an attorneys’ fees award.    

 

The motion for attorneys’ fees is denied.  Fitness cannot be the prevailing party in
this action when Palo Woods has already been determined to have been the
prevailing party in this action.

Fitness is ordered to give notice.
