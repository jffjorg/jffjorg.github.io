And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for summary judgment in this medical malpractice case. The plaintiff, Claudia Lankford, is seeking damages for the wrongful death of her mother, Valentina Timascu, who received care and treatment from the defendants, Long Beach Memorial Medical Center, Steven J. Appleby, M.D., and Maurice A. Bell, M.D.

The judge has found that the defendants met their burden to show that they are entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and that the plaintiff's expert declaration is objectionable and not admissible. The judge has sustained the defendant's objections to the expert declaration, finding that the expert, Dr. Brown, is not qualified to testify concerning standard of care or causation, and that his opinions are vague and do not meet the requirements of California law.

As a result, the judge has granted the summary judgment motion, finding that the plaintiff has failed to raise a triable issue of material fact. The judge has ordered the moving defendant to give notice of the ruling.
