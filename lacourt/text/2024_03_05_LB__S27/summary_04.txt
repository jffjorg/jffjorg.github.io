And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants Defendant Sally Larson's unopposed motions to compel Plaintiff Eman Mahmoud to respond to form interrogatories and special interrogatories. The Defendant had propounded these discovery requests on October 26, 2023, and the Plaintiff has failed to serve responses despite an attempt to meet and confer. The judge orders the Plaintiff to serve verified responses without objections within 14 days. Additionally, the judge awards the Defendant $750 in attorney's fees and $120 in costs. The judge also imposes sanctions on the Plaintiff and her attorney in the amount of $870, which must be paid within 20 days. The judge notes that the Defendant has another motion to compel on calendar for April 2, 2024, which appears to be duplicative of this motion, and asks the Defendant to remove it from the calendar.
