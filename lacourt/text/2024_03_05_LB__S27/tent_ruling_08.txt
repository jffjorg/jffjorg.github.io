  APPLICATION FOR EARLY EVALUATION CONFERENCE 
 
Dept. S27
8:30 a.m.
March 5, 2024



 
Moving Party:               Defendant, GREAT T103, LLC
Opposing Party:           No
opposition
Notice:                         OK
 
Plaintiff, Patrice Duren filed this
action against Defendant, GREAT T103, LLC for violations of UNRUH.  Specifically, Plaintiff alleges Defendant’s
restaurant lacks an accessible route leading to and from the business.  Plaintiff seeks declaratory relief,
injunctive relief, and damages.  
 
On 2/09/24, Defendant filed an
application for an early evaluation conference. 
The conference is scheduled for 3/05/24. 

 
The Court orders the following:
The action is stayed for ninety
days.  Civil Code §55.54(d)(1).
 
The conference has to be within 70
days after issuance of the order but not earlier than 50 days after filing of
the request.  The conference will be held
on 3/05/24, as scheduled by Defendant.  §55.54(d)(2).  
 
Per §55.54(d)(3), the parties or
persons whose authority is required to negotiate and enter into the settlement must
appear at the time for the conference.  
 
§55.54(d)(4) requires the Court to
order the defendant to file and serve a copy of any relevant CASP inspection
report at least fifteen days before the conference; Defendant must do so.
 
§55.54(d)(5) requires the order to
clarify that the inspection report may be disclosed only to the court, parties,
attorney, and individuals employed by or retained by the attorneys to assist in
the litigation, or insurance representatives or others involved in evaluation
and settlement of the case; it is so ordered.
 
§55.54(d)(6) requires the Court, if
Defendant requests, to order the parties to meet and confer within thirty days
at the subject premises.  Defendant’s
application and notice of stay do not so request, and therefore no meet and
confer is ordered.
 
§55.54(d)(7) requires the court to
order the plaintiff to file and serve at least fifteen days prior to the
conference a statement including various pieces of information pertinent to the
case.  It is so ordered.
