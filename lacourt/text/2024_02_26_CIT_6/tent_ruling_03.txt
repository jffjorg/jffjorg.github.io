   [1] The Court  was unable to find the definitions of these terms in the code provision  Plaintiff cited. California Health and Safety Code section 1418.81(d) mentions  “responsible party,” but does not actually define it, while sections  1599.60-1599.84 do not mention the term “resident representative.” Nevertheless,  MJB did not dispute these definitions in its opposition, so the Court will  proceed with the understanding based on Plaintiff’s purported meanings of these  terms.
