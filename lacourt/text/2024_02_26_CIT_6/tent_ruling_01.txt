  Case Number:  22PSCV01039    Hearing Date:   February 26, 2024    Dept:  6 CASE NAME:  Gentle Carman Auto v. Euro M Tech Transmissions, et al. Motions to be Relieved as Counsel (x 2) TENTATIVE RULINGThe Court DENIES the motions to be relieved as counsel without prejudice. Counsel is ordered to give notice of this ruling and file proof of service of same within five calendar days. BACKGROUNDThis is a breach of contract action. On September 13, 2022, plaintiff Gentle Carman Auto (Plaintiff) filed this action against defendants Euro M Tech Transmissions (Euro), Surong Jiang (collectively, Defendants), and Does 1 through 10. On January 26, 2023, Plaintiff filed the operative First Amended Complaint, alleging causes of action for breach of contract and conversion. On December 7, 2023, default judgment was entered against Defendants. On February 7, 2024, Stephen J. Thomas of Thomas Business Law Group (Counsel) filed motions to be relieved as counsel for Defendants. The motions are unopposed. LEGAL STANDARDThe Court has discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw, and such a motion should be granted, provided that there is no prejudice to the client, and it does not disrupt the orderly process of justice. (See Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915; People v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398, 403-407.)A motion to be relieved as counsel must be made on Judicial Council Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion), MC-052 (Declaration), and MC-053 (Proposed Order). (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, subds. (a), (c), (e).) The requisite forms must be served “on the client and on all parties that have appeared in the case.” (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1362, subd. (d).) DISCUSSIONCounsel seeks to be relieved as counsel for Defendants on the grounds that there has been a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship. (Thomas Decls., ¶ 2.) The Court finds this to be sufficient grounds for withdrawal. A breakdown in the attorney-client relationship is grounds for allowing the attorney to withdraw. (Estate of Falco (1987) 188 Cal.App.3d 1004, 1014.) Counsel has also provided the necessary Judicial Council forms per Rule 3.1362, subdivisions (a), (c), and (e) of the California Rules of Court. (Cal Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, subds. (a), (c), (e).) However, the Court notes that Counsel did not file a proof of service as to the other parties in this action, i.e., Plaintiff. “The notice of motion and motion, the declaration, and the proposed order must be served on the client and on all other parties who have appeared in the case.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, subd. (d), italics added.) It is therefore unclear to the Court if Counsel gave Plaintiff proper notice of these motions. The Court also notes that the motion to be relieved as counsel for Defendant Euro misspells its name as “Euro M Tach Transmissions” on all of the forms submitted. (See Motion; Thomas Decl., ¶ 1; Proposed Order, ¶ 1.) The Court further notes that paragraph 5.a. of the proposed orders are incomplete, and that paragraph 6 of the proposed orders do not provide Defendants’ current phone numbers. (See Proposed Orders, ¶¶ 5-6.)Based on the foregoing, the Court DENIES the motions without prejudice. The Court further notes that Defendants’ default was previously entered and the motion to set aside the default denied. A Court default judgment was entered against defendants Surong Jiang and Euro M Transmissions on December 17, 2023 and the matter was concluded. There are no further hearings or proceedings scheduled in this matter. CONCLUSIONThe Court DENIES the motions to be relieved as counsel without prejudice. Counsel is ordered to give notice of this ruling and file proof of service of same within five calendar days.
