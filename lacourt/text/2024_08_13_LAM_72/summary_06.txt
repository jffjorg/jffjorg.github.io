Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the Cross-Complaint filed by Defendant Luis Chavez and has sustained the demurrer (a legal challenge to the complaint) with leave to amend (allowing the defendant to revise the complaint) with respect to the second, third, fourth, seventh, and thirteenth claims. The judge has sustained the demurrer without leave to amend with respect to the sixth, eighth, ninth, tenth, eleventh, and twelfth claims.

The judge has found that the defendant's fraud claim is deficient because it does not specifically allege who made the representations or how, when, and where they were made. The judge has also found that the defendant's negligent infliction of emotional distress claim is deficient because it does not allege a proximate and foreseeable result of the alleged breach of contract.

The judge has found that the defendant's malicious prosecution claim is deficient because it does not allege that the lawsuit was brought without probable cause or that the lawsuit was initiated with malice. The judge has also found that the defendant's abuse of process claim is deficient because it does not allege that the defendant misused the tools of litigation.

The judge has found that the defendant's claims for unpaid rent, property damage, legal fees and court costs, and eviction costs are duplicative of the breach of contract claim and have sustained the demurrer without leave to amend.

The judge has also found that the defendant's false allegations and complaints claim is unclear and has sustained the demurrer with leave to amend. The judge has noted that the litigation privilege applies to any communication made in judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings and that the defendant must clarify that it has asserted a defamation claim and plead it in a legally sufficient manner.
