And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Linda Everhardt v. Los Angeles Unified School District. The defendant seeks to have the plaintiff's requests for admission deemed admitted, while the plaintiff seeks monetary sanctions in the amount of $5,122. The judge denies the defendant's motion, finding that the situation is moot since the plaintiff has died, and that the defendant failed to take action on the lack of verification for 8 months. The judge also denies the plaintiff's request for sanctions, finding that the defendant was legally entitled to take a shot at obtaining a procedural advantage from the plaintiff's death, even if it is an unusual circumstance. The judge notes that the defendant's failure to meet and confer or participate in an informal discovery conference to find a practical solution to the problem is not a basis for imposing sanctions.
