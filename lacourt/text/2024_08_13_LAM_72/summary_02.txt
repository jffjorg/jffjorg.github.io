  - "A transaction is rebuttably presumed not to be usurious."
  - "The Court has already granted Plaintiff an opportunity to amend this claim. Amendment did not succeed in producing a more coherent complaint.

As for the summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling sustains the demurrer to the plaintiff's First Amended Complaint without leave to amend. The plaintiff, Fallon Seaborn, alleges that the defendant, Wilshire Consumer Credit of Los Angeles, made small, secured cash loans to consumers at very high interest rates in violation of usury laws. The plaintiff's complaint lacks sufficient allegations to state a claim for usury, and the judge finds that further amendment would be futile. As a result, the court's order sustaining the demurrer has the practical effect of dismissing the entire complaint with prejudice.
