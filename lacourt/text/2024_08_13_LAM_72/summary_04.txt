The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for summary judgment filed by Real Time Staffing Services, LLC. The Court has denied Real Time's motion for summary judgment on several claims, including gender-based discrimination, sexual harassment, failure to prevent discrimination and harassment, and retaliation.

The Court has granted summary adjudication on several claims, including the claim for failure to permit inspection of personnel and payroll records, as the statute of limitations has expired. The Court has also denied summary adjudication on several claims, including intentional infliction of emotional distress and negligent infliction of emotional distress.

The Court has denied Real Time's motion for summary judgment on the claims for lost wages and punitive damages, as there are disputes of fact regarding these claims. The Court has also denied Real Time's motion for summary judgment on the claim for mitigation of damages, as there is a dispute of fact regarding whether the Plaintiff made a reasonable effort to find comparable employment after her employment with Real Time ended.

The Court has scheduled a hearing on August 13, 2024, to hear arguments on the tentative ruling.
