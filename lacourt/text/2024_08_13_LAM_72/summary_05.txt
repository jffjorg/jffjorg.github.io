And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge's Tentative Ruling grants Defendant's motion for an award of attorney's fees and costs against Plaintiff George Rahme and his counsel in the amount of $3,218.00. The Court finds that Plaintiff's counsel failed to file a written statement as required by Rule 3.1306(b) and that Plaintiff's decision to demand an evidentiary hearing but refuse to disclose the basis for such a hearing was unreasonable. The Court also finds that Plaintiff did not deny at the evidentiary hearing that the signature on the documents was his. The Court imposes sanctions on Plaintiff, rather than Plaintiff's counsel, because it is unclear whether the failure to abide by the rules was due to counsel or Plaintiff's decision. The Court requests that Defendant provide evidence that it expended $2,265.50 for its expert witness before approving it.
