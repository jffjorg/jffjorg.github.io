Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the defendants' motion for an order to show cause regarding contempt against the plaintiff for violating the court's August 6, 2024 order. The court finds that the defendants have satisfied the procedural requirements for the issuance of an order to show cause. The elements of contempt are established, including a valid order, knowledge of the order, ability to comply with the order, and willful failure to comply with the order. The court orders an order to show cause hearing to be held on January 30, 2025, to determine why the plaintiff should not be held in contempt for violating the court's order.
