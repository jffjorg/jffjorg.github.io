And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the defendant's demurrer to the plaintiff's complaint is overruled. The plaintiff, Vendel Borsca, alleges that the defendant, O'Gara Coach Company, LLC, engaged in unfair business practices, violated the California Consumers Legal Remedies Act, and made negligent and intentional misrepresentations. The plaintiff purchased a vehicle from the defendant and formed a limited liability company in Montana to avoid paying sales tax and license fees. The defendant demurred to the complaint, arguing that the plaintiff lacked standing and failed to plead reliance.

The judge found that the plaintiff's allegations were sufficient to state a claim and that the defendant's demurrer was without merit. The judge also found that the plaintiff was a consumer within the meaning of the California Consumers Legal Remedies Act, despite the fact that the vehicle was purchased by a limited liability company.

The judge overruled the defendant's demurrer to the entire complaint, including the plaintiff's causes of action for unfair business practices, violation of the California Consumers Legal Remedies Act, and negligent and intentional misrepresentation. The case will proceed to trial unless the parties settle or the defendant files an amended complaint.
