II.
ANALYSIS
 
A.      Motion to
Dismiss PAGA Claims
 
Plaintiff moves to dismiss his PAGA Claims. 
 
The Labor Code Private Attorneys General Act (“PAGA”)
authorizes aggrieved employees to file lawsuits to recover civil penalties on
behalf of themselves, other employees, and the State of California for Labor
Code violations. (Lab. Code, section 2698, et seq.)
 
Plaintiff states he no longer wishes to pursue his PAGA cause of action. Plaintiff
contends he is unable to conduct any discovery to identify other aggrieved
employees or notified other aggrieved employees as to this lawsuit. Plaintiff has
not sought the express consent of other aggrieved employees to pursue this
lawsuit on their behalf and has not given other aggrieved employees the
opportunity to opt-out of Plaintiff’s representation in this matter. (Delos
Santos Decl., ¶ 4.)
 
There
is no opposition. Plaintiff’s motion is granted.
The dismissal is without prejudice.    
 
B.      Request for
Default Judgment
 
a.      Legal

The Court

provisions in failing and refusing to pay Plaintiff his wages. The Court finds
that Plaintiff’s submitted declaration supports his request for $98,206.65 in
damages. Plaintiff does not appear to be seeking emotional distress or punitive
damages. Plaintiff calculated his total amount of my damages and penalties as
follows: 
·       Unpaid
Minimum Wage Compensation Labor Code §§1182.12, 1194, 1194.2, 1197 = $19,381.20

·       Liquidate
Damages Labor Code §1194.2 = $19,381.20 
·       Unpaid
Overtime Compensation Labor Code §§201, 510, 1194 = $19,686.45 
·       Reimbursement

·       Labor Code
§226.3 = $1,250.00 
·       Labor Code
§226(f) = $750.00 
 
(Nwogu
Decl., ¶ 28.) Plaintiff has demonstrated his
entitlement to damages in the amount of $98,206.65. Well pleaded allegations of the complaint are admitted by
Defendant in default. (Rose v. Lawton¿(1963) 215 Cal.App.2d 18, 20 [“the
defendant who fails to answer admits only facts which are well pleaded . . .”]) 
 
Plaintiff requests prejudgment interest on each of his wage
and hour claims at the rate of 10% per annum pursuant to Civil Code section
3287 and 3289.  Pursuant to Civil Code section 3287, subdivision (b) “[e]very
person who is entitled under any judgment to receive damages based upon a cause
of action in contract where the claim was unliquidated, may also recover
interest thereon from a date prior to the entry of judgment as the court may,
in its discretion, fix, but in no event earlier than the date the action was
filed.” Additionally, “[i]f a contract entered into after January 1, 1986, does
not stipulate a legal rate of interest, the obligation shall bear interest at a
rate of 10 percent per annum after a breach.” (Civil Code § 3289, subd. (b);
see also Bell v. Farmers Ins. Exchange (2006) 135 Cal.App.4th 1138 [10
percent prejudgment interest rate properly applied to claim for unpaid wages
under Labor Code 218.6.]) Plaintiff has demonstrated entitlement to interest in the
amount of $10,667.54.
 
Plaintiff requests attorney’s fees in the amount of $6,600
pursuant to Labor Code sections 218, 226(e) and 1194. Labor Code
section 218.5 provides that, “[i]n any action brought for the nonpayment of
wages…the court shall award reasonable attorney’s fees and cost to the
prevailing party if any party to the action requests attorney’s fees and costs
upon the initiation of this action.” Pursuant to Labor Code section 226, subdivision (e)(1),
“[a]n employee suffering injury as a result of a knowing and intentional
failure by an employer to comply with subdivision (a) …is entitled to an award
of costs and reasonable attorney’s fees.” Additionally, pursuant to Labor Code
section 1194 “[n]otwithstanding any agreement to work for a lesser wage, any
employee receiving less than the legal minimum wage or the legal overtime
compensation applicable to the employee is entitled to recover in a civil
action the unpaid balance of the full amount of this minimum wage or overtime
compensation, including interest thereon, reasonable attorney’s fees, and costs
of suit.”  
 
Plaintiff
submits the declaration of his counsel, Mae-Elaine Delos Santos, in support of
this request. Ms. Delos Santos attests that she spent a total of 10 hours on
this case and her current hourly rate is $600 per hour. (Delos Santos Decl., ¶¶ 6-7.) Ms. Delos Santos states she
expects to spend an additional hour preparing for and appearing at the default
hearing. (Delos Santos Decl., ¶ 11.) The Court finds that the time
spent and the requested hourly rate for Ms. Delos Santos is reasonable. Ms.
Delos Santos also attests to the requested costs. (Delos Santos
Decl., ¶ 4.)
 
For the reasons set forth above, the court finds that
Plaintiff’s submitted evidence supports a default judgment for Plaintiff
against Defendants in the total amount of $117,924.27, consisting of $98,206.65
in damages, $10,667.54 in interest, $2,450.08 in costs and $6,600 in attorney
fees.
 
Accordingly,
Plaintiff’s request for entry of default judgment is GRANTED. 
 
III.
CONCLUSION 
 
Plaintiff’s
Motion to Dismiss PAGA Claims is GRANTED.
 
Plaintiff’s request for entry of default judgment
is GRANTED.
