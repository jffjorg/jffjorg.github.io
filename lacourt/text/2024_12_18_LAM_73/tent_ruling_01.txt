DEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR ORDER TO SHOW
CAUSE REGARDING CONTEMPT (filed 11/15/24)
 
TENTATIVE RULING
Defendants’ Motion for an Order to Show Cause regarding Contempt
is GRANTED.
The court sets an Order to Show Cause Hearing Re: Contempt as
to why Plaintiff should not be held in contempt for violating the Court’s August
6, 2024 Order for January 30, 2025.   
 
BACKGROUND
 
On October 23, 2019, Plaintiff Shahnaz
Amirtalesh (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Defendants Rochelle H.
Sterling (“Sterling”), Beverly Hills Properties (“BHP”), The Sterling Family
Trust, Susan Robman and Does 1-50 (collectively, “Defendants”).
 
This
action arises out of Plaintiff’s tenancy at 240 N. Crescent Drive, Apt. 107,
Beverly Hills, CA 90210 (the “Apartment”).  In her complaint, Plaintiff
alleges that the Apartment landlord, BHP, failed to maintain sewage pipes in
the building which caused a leak in her shower drain in October 24, 2018; that
BHP delayed in granting her request to replace flood-damaged carpeting in her
Apartment with laminate floors as a reasonable accommodation for her disability
stemming from lung cancer; that BHP did not properly enforce COVID-19
restrictions regarding the use of the Apartment swimming pool; and further,
that Apartment manager, Susan Robman, harassed and discriminated against
Plaintiff because of Plaintiff’s religious beliefs.   
 
In
the summer of 2019, Plaintiff filed complaints with the County of Los Angeles
Department of Public Health (“DPH”) and the City of Beverly Hills regarding her
apartment.  On September 5, 2019, the City of Beverly Hills issued a
notice of violations to BHP.  On September 10, 2019, DPH issued an
Official Inspection Report for violations regarding wall/ceiling floor and
faucet fixtures. 
  
On
October 23, 2019, Plaintiff filed her complaint against Defendants. Sterling is
the owner of BHP and the Apartment and the trustee of the Sterling Family
Trust.  On August 7, 2020, Plaintiff filed a Second Amended Complaint
(“SAC”) alleging eight causes of action.  On or about October 20, 2021,
the court sustained Defendants’ demurrer to the fifth cause of action in the
SAC without leave to amend.  The remaining causes of action are as
follows: 
C/A 1: Breach of Warranty of Habitability 
C/A 2: Negligence  
C/A 3: Nuisance  
C/A 4: Violation of Civil Code § 1942.4 
C/A 6: Violation of the California Fair Employment
and Housing Act  
C/A 7: Violation of the California Unruh Civil Rights
Act 
C/A 8: Breach of Implied Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment 
 
On March 17, 2023,
Plaintiff dismissed Defendant Susan Robman from the case.
 
On January 24, 2023,
the Court granted Defendants’ motion for summary adjudication as to the fourth,
sixth and eighth causes of action. At
the same hearing, plaintiff dismissed, with prejudice, the fifth and seventh causes
of action.
 
On November
15, 2024, Defendants filed the instant Motion for Order to Show Cause regarding
Contempt, arguing:
·      
On August 6, 2024, this Court granted Defendants' motion to compel
Plaintiff to pay Defendants’ experts’ deposition fees and ordered Plaintiff to
pay $3,990 to Defendants on or before September 5, 2024. 
·      
To date, Plaintiff has not satisfied the Court's order, even
partially. (Decl. Dawkins ¶ 13.)
·      
Defendants have satisfied the procedural requirements for an OSC
o  
Plaintiff had knowledge of the Court’s order
§ 
Plaintiff was present in court when the Court issued its ruling
granting Defendants motion to compel Plaintiff to pay Defendants’ experts’
deposition fees. (Decl. Dawkins ¶ 10.)
§ 
Plaintiff was also served with the Court’s ruling.
§ 
Defendants' counsel reminded Plaintiff of the upcoming deadline on
August 28, 2024 and September 5, 2024. (See emails attached as Ex. E and Ex. G
to Decl. Dawkins.)
§ 
On August 29, 2024, Plaintiff sent a letter acknowledging receipt
of defendants’ counsel’s email of August 28 but provided no response about the
experts’ deposition fees. (See email and letter attached as Ex. F to Decl.
Dawkins.)
o  
Defense counsel is not aware of any reason why Plaintiff would be
unable to comply with the Court's order. (Decl. Dawkins ¶ 14.)
o  
Defendants have met their burden to establish that Plaintiff has
willfully disobeyed the Court's order.
 
Plaintiff
filed an opposition, arguing:
·      
Defendants’ motion is defective and does not establish the
required elements. 
·      
The
Court order was imposed unlawfully on Plaintiff.
·      
Plaintiff
has sustained an injury from a trip and fall incident making it difficult for
Plaintiff to appear at hearings and prepare legal writings.
 
Defendants
filed a reply, stating:
·      
In
Plaintiff’s Opposition, Plaintiff fails to rebut any of the required elements
and appears to concede to most of them.
·      
Plaintiff
concedes her knowledge of the Court order. Thus, she has conceded to the making
of the order and her willful disobedience. 
·      
Plaintiff
does not establish any facts suggesting an inability to comply with the Court’s
August 6, 2024 order.
 
DISCUSSION
 
A.      Legal
Standard
 
Contempt is any act, in or out of
court, “which tends to impede, embarrass or obstruct the court in the discharge
of its duties.” (In re Shortridge (1893) 99 Cal. 526, 532.) Particular
acts constituting contempt are enumerated by statute, and include
“[d]isobedience¿of any lawful judgment, order, or process of the court.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 1209.)¿“The power of the court to punish for contempt is indeed
broad, but it is not unlimited. It is a drastic remedy, to be employed only when
necessary to the proper and orderly conduct of judicial proceedings. A charge
of contempt of court must be considered judicially as the question of guilt of
any criminal offense must be, and a judge may not punish for contempt merely
because he has suffered annoyance through the failure of some order he has made
to receive instant observance.” (Chapman v. Superior Court of Los Angeles
County (1968) 261 Cal.App.2d 194, 201.)¿¿ 
 
“A contempt proceeding is commenced by
the filing of an affidavit and a request for an order to show cause.
[Citation.] After notice to the opposing party's lawyer, the court (if
satisfied with the sufficiency of the affidavit) must sign an order to show
cause re contempt in which the date and time for a hearing are set forth.
[Citations.] The order to show cause acts as a summons to appear in court on a
certain day and, as its name suggests, to show cause why a certain thing should
not be done. [Citation.] Unless the¿citee¿has concealed himself from the court,
he must be personally served with the affidavit and the order to show cause; otherwise,
the court lacks jurisdiction to proceed.” (Cedars-Sinai Imaging Med.
Grp. v. Superior Court¿(2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 1281, 1286-1287 (emphasis in
original).)¿¿¿ 
 
“As a general rule, the elements of
contempt include (1) a valid order, (2) knowledge of the order, (3) ability to
comply with the order, and (4) willful failure to comply with the order.” (In
re Ivey (2000) 85 Cal.App.4th 793, 798.)¿¿ 
 
B.      Discussion
 
Defendants
move for an order setting an OSC hearing regarding contempt against Plaintiff
for violating the Court’s August 6, 2024 order. 
 
On August
6, 2024, this Court granted Defendants' motion
to compel Plaintiff to pay Defendants’ experts’ deposition fees and ordered Plaintiff
to pay $3,990 to Defendants on or before September 5, 2024. (Court’s 08/06/24
Minute Order.) Defendants contend that to date, Plaintiff has not satisfied the
Court’s order. (Dawkins Decl., ¶ 14.)
 
The
Court finds that Defendants have satisfied the procedural requirements for the
issuance of an OSC. As discussed above, the elements
of contempt include (1) a valid order, (2) knowledge of the order, (3) ability
to comply with the order, and (4) willful failure to comply with the order.” (In
re Ivey (2000) 85 Cal.App.4th 793, 798.)
 
First, Defendants have established the
Court issued a valid order. The Court’s August 6, 2024 order was in
writing and entered in the minutes as required under Jablon v. Henneberger
(1949) 33 Cal.2d 773, 775 (“It is the general rule that an order is ineffective
unless filed with the clerk or entered in the minutes”). Second, Defendants contend that Plaintiff had knowledge of
the order because: (1) she was present in court at the August 6, 2024 hearing when
the Court issued its ruling; (2) the notice of the ruling was served on
Plaintiff; (3) defense counsel sent Plaintiff emails reminding her of the
Court’s order to pay Defendants’ experts’ fees by September 5, 2024. (Dawkins
Decl., ¶ 5, 10, 11, Exs. A, B, E, G.) In Plaintiff’s opposition, she does not appear
to dispute her knowledge of the Court’s order. (Oppos., p. 8.) Third, Defendants
assert they are not aware of any reason that Plaintiff would be unable to
comply with the Court’s order. (Dawkins Decl., ¶ 14.) Plaintiff fails to
establish her inability to comply with the order. While Plaintiff argues in her
opposition that she suffered an injury that makes it difficult to attend court
hearings and to prepare legal writings, Plaintiff fails to show how this would
impact her ability to comply with the Court’s order to pay for Defendant’s
experts’ fees. Fourth, Defendants have sufficiently established willful
disobedience since Plaintiff has not complied with the Court’s order despite
being aware of the order. (Dawkins Decl., ¶ 14.)
Based on the
foregoing, Defendants’ Motion for an
Order to Show Cause regarding Contempt is GRANTED.
CONCLUSION 
Defendants’
Motion for an Order to Show Cause regarding Contempt is GRANTED.
The
court sets an Order to Show Cause Hearing Re: Contempt as to why Plaintiff
should not be held in contempt for violating the Court’s August 6, 2024 Order
for January 30, 2025.
