STATEMENT
OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
            This is an action for unlawful detainer for nonpayment of rent that was
filed on November 14, 2023. 
 
Defendant demurs to the Complaint
and moves to strike the Complaint. 
            
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Defendant’s Demurrer to the
Complaint is SUSTAINED without leave to amend. 
 
Defendant’s Motion to Strike is
MOOT. 
 
Dismissal is entered this date with
prejudice. 
 
DISCUSSION:
 
Demurrer to Complaint
 
            Defendant
demurs to the Complaint in its entirety. 
 
Request for Judicial Notice
 
            Defendant
requests that the Court take judicial notice of various documents. As none of
these exhibits are material to the Court’s ruling, which turns solely on the
defective 3-Day Notice, Defendant’s request is DENIED. (Gbur v. Cohen (1979) 93 Cal.App.3d 296, 301 [“[J]udicial notice .
. . is always confined to those matters which are relevant to the issue at
hand.”].) 
 
Defective Notice
 
            Defendant demurs
to the Complaint for failure to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of
action because Plaintiff did not comply with the notice requirements for
unlawful detainer. 
 
“The established rule is that,
where the right to a forfeiture is created by contract or by law, ‘it has
always been considered that it was necessary to restrain it to the most
technical limits of the terms and conditions upon which the right is to be exercised.’”
(Downing v. Cutting Packing Co. (1920) 183 Cal. 91, 95.) Put
differently, unlawful detainer statutes are strictly construed, and “every
intendment and presumption is against the person seeking to enforce the
forfeiture.” (Horton-Howard v. Payton (1919) 44 Cal.App. 108, 112.)
“Because of the summary nature of an unlawful detainer action, a notice is
valid only if the lessor strictly complies with the statutorily mandated notice
requirements.” (Bevill v. Zoura (1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 694, 697 [internal
citations omitted].) Valid notice is a prerequisite to an unlawful detainer
action. (See Kwok v. Bergren (1982) 130 Cal. App. 3d 596, 599-600
[citing Lawrence Barker, Inc. v. Briggs (1952) 39 Cal.2d 654, 661].) 
 
            Here, the
Complaint alleges that the 3-Day Notice to Pay Rent or Quit was served exclusively
by posting. Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1162, a notice must be
served by either personal service (Code Civ. Proc. § 1162(a)(1); (b)(1)), by
substituted service upon a person of suitable age and discretion and thereafter
mailing a copy, (Id. subd. (a)(2); (b)(2)), or by “affixing a copy in a
conspicuous place on the property, and also sending a copy through the
mail addressed to the tenant at the place where the property is situated.”
(Code Civ. Proc. § 1162 (a)(3), (b)(3) [emphasis added].) No proof of service
is attached to the Complaint, and the Complaint does not allege service by
mail. This defect is fatal to the Complaint. 
 
            As the
Complaint contains a fatal defect in service of the underlying 3-Day Notice,
the Court does not reach Defendant’s arguments regarding the proper owner of
the premises or uncertainty in the pleadings. 
 
Leave to Amend
 
            When a
demurrer is sustained, the Court determines whether there is a reasonable
possibility that the defect can be cured by amendment. (Blank v. Kirwan
(1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318).  When a plaintiff “has pleaded the
general set of facts upon which his cause of action is based,” the court should
give the plaintiff an opportunity to amend his complaint, since plaintiff
should not “be deprived of his right to maintain his action on the ground that
his pleadings were defective for lack of particulars.” (Reed v. Norman
(1957) 152 Cal.App.2d 892, 900.) Accordingly, California law imposes the
burden on the plaintiffs to demonstrate the manner in which they can amend
their pleadings to state their claims against a defendant.  (Goodman
v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 349.) “Denial of leave to amend
constitutes an abuse of discretion unless the complaint shows on its face it is
incapable of amendment.  [Citation.]  Liberality in permitting
amendment is the rule, if a fair opportunity to correct any defect has not been
given." (Angie M. v. Superior Court (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1217,
1227.)
 
            Here, the
deficiency in the Complaint arises from an express allegation that admits to
improper service of the 3-Day Notice to Pay Rent or Quit. Amending the
Complaint to allege a different form of service would implicate the sham
pleading doctrine because “[a] plaintiff may not avoid a demurrer by pleading
facts or positions in an amended complaint that contradicts facts pleaded in
the original complaint, or by suppressing facts which prove the pleaded facts
false.” (Cantu v. Resolution Trust Corporation (1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 857,
877-878.) Leave to amend is therefore not proper in this instance. 
 
Conclusion
 
            Accordingly,
Defendant’s Demurrer to the Complaint is SUSTAINED without leave
to amend. 
 
Motion to Strike Complaint
 
            Defendant’s
Motion to Strike is MOOT for the reasons stated above. 
            
CONCLUSION:

 
Accordingly, Defendant’s Demurrer to the
Complaint is SUSTAINED without leave to amend. 
 
Defendant’s Motion to Strike is
MOOT. 
 
Dismissal is entered this date with
prejudice. 
 
Moving Party to give notice.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
