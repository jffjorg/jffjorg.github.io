And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling is a summary of the court's thinking on the case, written by Judge Theresa M. Traber. The case is a civil action for unlawful detainer, involving a dispute over non-payment of rent. The plaintiff, 1200 Management LLC, alleges that the defendant, Liron Shvartz, failed to pay rent and has filed a complaint seeking to eject him from the premises. The defendant has filed a demurrer to the complaint, arguing that the complaint is defective and that the notice of the 3-Day Notice to Pay Rent or Quit was not properly served. The court finds that the notice was not properly served, as it was only posted and not served by mail, as required by California Code of Civil Procedure section 1162. Therefore, the court sustains the demurrer to the complaint without leave to amend and dismisses the complaint with prejudice.
