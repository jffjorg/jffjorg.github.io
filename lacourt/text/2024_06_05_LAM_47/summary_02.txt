And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants the defendant's motion for summary judgment. The defendant argues that the subject premises is subject to the Los Angeles Rent Stabilization Ordinance (LARSO) and that the plaintiff has failed to comply with the Ordinance. The plaintiff alleges that the defendant's unit is "exempt from LARSO as an Artist – in – Residence unit", but the judge finds that this exemption does not exist in the Ordinance. The judge also finds that the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate a triable issue of fact regarding its compliance with the Ordinance. Therefore, the defendant is entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law.
