And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer to the complaint filed by Puente Hills Business Center II, L.P. against Golden Gate Finance, Inc. and Daqing Wang. The demurrer challenges the sufficiency of the complaint, specifically the second and third causes of action.

The judge has sustained the demurrer to the third cause of action, which alleges a common count, with leave to amend. The judge has overruled the demurrer to the second cause of action, which alleges breach of written guaranty.

The judge's ruling is based on the legal standards governing demurrers, including the requirement that a complaint must state a cause of action and that a demurrer tests whether the complaint meets this standard. The judge has accepted all well-pleaded facts as true and has considered the defects in the pleading.

The judge has also analyzed the specific arguments made by the defendants, including their contention that the complaint fails to provide a complete and executed copy of the guaranty agreement and that the agreement was not signed by Puente Hills. The judge has rejected these arguments, finding that the complaint does include a copy of the guaranty agreement and that the agreement remains enforceable even if it was not signed.

The judge's ruling is subject to change after the hearing on July 1, 2024.
