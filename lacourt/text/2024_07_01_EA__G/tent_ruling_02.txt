RULING

Defendants
Golden Gate Finance, Inc. and Daqing Wang’s Demurrer to Complaint is SUSTAINED
IN PART with twenty (20) days leave to amend as to the third cause of action
and OVERRULED IN PART as to the second cause of action.
 
BACKGROUND
 
This is an action for breach of lease agreement. In January
2022, Plaintiff Puente Hills Business Center II, L.P. (Puente Hills) entered
into a lease agreement with Defendant Golden Gate Finance, Inc. (Golden Gate)
in which Golden Gate agreed to rent a property in the City of Industry from
Puente Hills for a five-year term. In support of the lease, Defendant Daqing
Wang executed a written guaranty. Subsequently in October 2023, Puente Hills
alleges Golden Gate breached the lease agreement by vacating the City of Industry
property and failing to pay further rent.
 
On December 4, 2023, Puente Hills filed a complaint against
Golden Gate, Wang, and Does 1-10, alleging the following causes of action: (1)
breach of lease, (2) breach of written guaranty, and (3) common counts.
 
On April 22, 2024, Golden Gate and Wang filed the present
demurrer. On May 28, 2024, the Court continued the
hearing on Golden Gate and Wang’s demurrer for parties to further meet and
confer. On June 17, 2024, Golden
Gate and Wang’s counsel met and conferred telephonically with Puente Hills’s
counsel and was unable to reach a resolution. (Carlson Decl.)
 
A hearing on the demurrer and case management
conference is set for July 1, 2024.
 
ANALYSIS

Golden Gate and Wang demur to Puente Hills’
second cause of action (breach of written guaranty) and third cause of action
(common counts). For the following reasons, the Court SUSTAINS Golden Gate and Wang’s demurrer to the third cause of action with leave
to amend and OVERRULES their demurrer to the second cause of action.
 
Legal Standard

A party may demur to a complaint on the
grounds that it “does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of
action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (e).) A demurrer tests whether the
complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147
Cal.App.4th 740, 747 (Hahn).) When considering demurrers, courts accept
all well pleaded facts as true. (Fox v. JAMDAT Mobile, Inc. (2010) 185
Cal.App.4th 1068, 1078.) In a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent
on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial notice. (Donabedian v.
Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) “A demurrer tests the
pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters. Therefore, it
lies only where the defects appear on the face of the pleading or are
judicially noticed.” (SKF Farms v. Superior Court (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d
902, 905.) “The only issue involved in a demurrer hearing is whether the
complaint, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous matters, states a cause of
action.” (Hahn, supra, at p. 747.)
 
Breach of Written Guaranty (Second Cause
of Action)
 
Wang argues Puente Hills’ second cause of
action for breach of written guaranty fails because Puente Hills did not
provide a complete and executed copy of the guaranty agreement. The court disagrees.
 
Legal Standard
 
To state a cause of action for breach of
contract, a plaintiff must be able to establish “(1) the existence of the
contract, (2) plaintiff’s performance or excuse for nonperformance, (3)
defendant’s breach, and (4) the resulting damages to the plaintiff.” (Oasis
West Realty, LLC v. Goldman (2011) 51 Cal.4th 811, 821.) If a breach of
contract claim “is based on alleged breach of a written contract, the terms
must be set out verbatim in the body of the complaint or a copy of the written
agreement must be attached and incorporated by reference.” (Harris v. Rudin,
Richman & Appel (1999) 74 Cal.App.4th 299, 307.) In some circumstances,
a plaintiff may also “plead the legal effect of the contract rather than its
precise language.” (Construction Protective Services, Inc. v. TIG Specialty
Ins. Co. (2002) 29 Cal.4th 189, 198-199.)
 
Discussion
 
In this case, Wang argues Puente Hills failed
to include a complete copy of the guaranty agreement in the Complaint.
(Demurrer, p. 3:6-7.) The Complaint does, however, include a copy of the
written guaranty as Exhibit B. Wang also argues the written guaranty fails
because it was not signed by Puente Hills. (Demurrer, p. 3:6-9.) The court
notes that even if Puente Hills’s initialing of the personal guaranty is
insufficient to constitute a signature, the agreement remains enforceable if
Puente Hills accepted the guaranty and tendered performance. (See Dallman
Supply Co. v. Smith-Blair, Inc. (1951) 103 Cal.App.2d 129, 132; see also
Nelkin v. Marvin Hime & Co. (1964) 228 Cal.App.2d 744, 748-749.) Here,
the Complaint establishes Puente Hills accepted the guaranty and tendered
performance by alleging Puente Hills leased the City of Industry property to
Golden Gate. (Complaint, ¶ 6-10.)
 
Accordingly, Wang’s demurrer to this cause of
action is OVERRULED.
 
Common Count (Third Cause of Action)
 
Golden Gate and Wang contend Puente Hills’ third
cause of action for common count fails because it is not permitted when an action
is based on contract and is uncertain. The court agrees the cause of action is uncertain.
 
“A common count is not a specific cause of
action . . . ; rather, it is a simplified form of pleading normally used to
aver the existence of various forms of monetary indebtedness, including that
arising from an alleged duty to make restitution under an assumpsit theory.” (McBride
v. Boughton (2004) 123 Cal.App.4th 379, 394 (McBride).) Here, it is
unclear which form of monetary indebtedness the Complaint is alleging as it
does not specify which type of common count is being pled. (Complaint, ¶ 16.)
 
Accordingly, Golden Gate and Wang’s demurrer
to this cause of action is SUSTAINED
with leave to amend.
 
CONCLUSION

Based on the
foregoing, Golden Gate and Wang’s
demurrer to Puente Hills’ Complaint is SUSTAINED with twenty (20) days
leave to amend as to the third cause of action and OVERRULED as to the second
cause of action.
