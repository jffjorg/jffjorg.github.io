  Case Number:  23PSCV03086    Hearing Date:   July 1, 2024    Dept:  G Plaintiff Petit Eight, LLC’s Application for Default
Judgment
Respondent: NO OPPOSITION
TENTATIVE RULING
Plaintiff Petit Eight,
LLC’s Application for Default Judgment is GRANTED in the reduced amount of $575,026.83.
BACKGROUND
This
is a breach of contract action. In November 2021, Defendant Ludlow Holdings LLC
(Ludlow Holdings) entered into an agreement with Plaintiff Petit Eight, LLC
(Petit Eight) in which Petit Eight agreed to loan $277,423 to Ludlow Holdings
in exchange for $55,484.60 in interest. The loan was secured by a deed of trust
on a property in South Pasadena. Subsequently, Petit Eight alleges Ludlow
Holdings breached the agreement and defaulted on Ludlow Holdings’ obligations
after losing the South Pasadena property to foreclosure and failing to repay
the loan. In July 2022, Ludlow Holdings entered into a second agreement with
Petit Eight in which Petit Eight agreed to loan $200,000 to Ludlow Holdings in
exchange for $40,000 in interest. The loan was secured by a deed of trust on a
property in Sierra Madre. Subsequently, Petit Eight alleges Ludlow Holdings
breached the agreement after failing to repay the loan by its maturity date of January
7, 2023.
On October
6, 2023, Petit Eight filed a complaint against Ludlow Holdings, Kurt Ludlow,
and Does 1-100, alleging the following causes of action: (1) breach of
contract, (2) money had and received, (3) book account, (4) account stated, (5)
breach of contract, (6) money had and received, (7) book account, and (8)
account stated.
On October
23, 2023, Petit Eight’s process server served Ludlow with substitute service in
Rancho Cucamonga. On December 11, 2023, the Court entered default against Ludlow
after Ludlow failed to file a timely answer.
On March
12, 2024, Petit Eight’s process server personally served Ludlow Holdings in Los
Angeles. On May 1, 2024, the Court entered default against Ludlow Holdings
after they failed to file a timely answer. On May 17, 2024, Petit Eight
submitted the present application for default judgment.
An
OSC Re: Default Judgment is set for July 1, 2024.
LEGAL STANDARD
Code
of Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a
party has filed to timely respond or appear.  A party seeking judgment on
the default by the court must file a Request for Court Judgment, and: (1) a
brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other admissible evidence in
support of the judgment requested; (3) interest computations as necessary; (4)
a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) a proposed form of judgment; (6) a
dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application
for separate judgment under CCP § 579, supported by a showing of grounds for
each judgment; (7) exhibits as necessary; and (8) a request for attorneys’ fees
if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.  (Cal. Rules of
Court 3.1800.)
ANALYSIS
Petit
Eight seeks default judgment against Ludlow and Ludlow Holdings in the total amount
of $578,426.83, including $477,423.00 in damages, $95,484.60 in interest, $4,664.23
in attorney fees, and $855 in costs. Because the court finds Petit Eight submitted
sufficient evidence, the court GRANTS their application for default
judgment with the following modification.
While
Petit Eight’s application for default judgment requests interest of $95,484.60,
their supporting declaration requests reduced interest of $92,084.60 to account
for a payment of $3,400 that was made by Ludlow or Ludlow Holdings. (Larkin
Decl., ¶ 36.) Accordingly, the Court reduces the awarded interest to this
amount for a total judgment of $575,026.83.
CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, Petit
Eight’s application for default judgment is GRANTED in the reduced
amount of $575,026.83.  Plaintiff is ordered to submit a judgment
consistent with this ruling forthwith.
