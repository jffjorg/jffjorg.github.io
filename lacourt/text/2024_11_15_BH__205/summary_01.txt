And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the defendants' motion for reconsideration of the order granting the plaintiffs' motion to add a claim for punitive damages. The defendants argue that Dr. Funk's declaration, which states that she agreed to the procedure, is new evidence that was not previously known. The judge finds that this is not the case, and that the defendants had the opportunity to obtain Dr. Funk's declaration earlier but failed to do so. The judge also finds that the motion for reconsideration is untimely, as it was filed after the deadline.

The judge also denies the plaintiffs' motion for leave to conduct financial discovery, finding that the plaintiffs have not shown that they are "very likely" to prevail on their claim for punitive damages at trial. The judge notes that the motion relies exclusively on the alleged fraud related to Dr. Fischer's claim that Dr. Funk agreed to the procedure, and that Dr. Fischer has now presented the declaration of Dr. Funk which confirms her agreement to the procedure. The judge finds that the plaintiffs have not shown that they are likely to prevail on their claim for punitive damages, and therefore denies the motion for financial discovery.

The judge's ruling is based on the factual allegations presented by the parties, including the dispute over whether Dr. Funk agreed to the procedure, and the alleged fraud related to Dr. Fischer's claim that Dr. Funk agreed to the procedure. The judge finds that the defendants' motion for reconsideration is untimely and that the plaintiffs' motion for leave to conduct financial discovery is not supported by the evidence.
