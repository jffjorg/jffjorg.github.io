Tentative
Ruling:      The Court grants the
motion for final approval of the class action settlement and PAGA settlement.
 

 
Background
 
Plaintiff Evi Herrera Orantes
(Plaintiff) filed a complaint on behalf of himself, other aggrieved employees,
and the State of California, against Defendant International School of Los
Angeles – Lycee International De Los Angeles (Defendant) for Private Attorneys
General Act (PAGA) penalties for that various wage and hour claims.


On December 5, 2023, the Court
granted preliminary approval of the class and PAGA settlement. The Gross
Settlement Amount was $358,000.00, and after fees, costs, and service awards,
the Net Settlement Amount was projected to be $192,666.67.
 
Plaintiff now moves for final
approval. The figures largely remain the same, with Plaintiff now providing a
reduced actual litigation costs figure of $6,845.16 (down from the originally
expected amount of $15,000) and a reduced settlement administration costs of
$5,350 (down from the originally expected amount of $6,000. As a result, the
Net Settlement Amount has increased to $199,328.24. As discussed below, there
appears to be a slight discrepancy regarding litigations costs, which will not
preclude Court approval, but may require some interlineation. 
 
Discussion
 
Settlement Approval
 
The Court has previously considered
the fairness of the settlement through evaluating whether the agreement was the
result of arm’s length bargaining, sufficient investigation and discovery, and
the experience of counsel. The only remaining factor is the number of
objectors.
 
Since the preliminary approval, the
Settlement Administrator, ILYM Group Inc. mailed out the Notice of Class Action
Settlement in English and Spanish on December 26, 2023 to 280 class members, of
which only 12 were returned from the Post Office. (Rubalcava Decl., ¶¶ 3-8;
Exh. A.) After performing additional skip traces to locate update addresses, a
total of 4 were re-mailed and 8 were undeliverable. (Id. at ¶¶ 7-10.)
Thereafter, ILYM Group Inc. was contacted by four individuals who believed that
they should be included in the class, and after Defense Counsel inquired within
Defendant’s records, it was determined that adding these four individuals was
appropriate. (Id. at ¶ 11.) No objections were received and a total of
only 20 members submitted valid opt-out requests. (Id. at ¶¶ 12-14.)
Thus, there are 284 participating class members, which is 100% of the entire
settlement class. (Id. at ¶ 15.) The average net individual settlement class
payment is $684.25, with the maximum being $3,170. (Id. at ¶ 17.) Also,
the average net individual PAGA payment is approximated to be $25, with the
highest being $76.52. (Id. at ¶ 18.)
 
Based upon its prior finding that
the Settlement was fair, adequate, and reasonable, and given the lack of
objections, the Court grants final approval of the settlement.
 
Attorney Fees and Costs
 
            The
Court preliminarily approved one-third of the Gross Settlement Amount and costs
not to exceed $15,000.00. The final request is for $119,333.33 in fees and a
total of $8,988.43 in costs. 
 
Plaintiff provides declarations
detailing the lodestar amounts for each of Plaintiff’s firms: $73,775.00 for Mehrdad
Bokhour of the Bokhour Law Group, P.C., and $40,625.00 for Jake Finkel of the
Finkle Firm. The combined amount is $114,400, which amounts to a positive
multiplier of 1.05. (Motion at pp. 12-13; Bokhour Decl. ¶¶ 18-19; Finkel Decl.,
¶ 23.)
 
“[W]hen class action litigation
establishes a monetary fund for the benefit of the class members, and the trial
court in its equitable powers awards class counsel a fee out of that fund, the
court may determine the amount of a reasonable fee by choosing an appropriate
percentage of the fund created. The recognized advantages of the percentage
method—including relative ease of calculation, alignment of incentives between
counsel and the class, a better approximation of market conditions in a
contingency case, and the encouragement it provides counsel to seek an early
settlement and avoid unnecessarily prolonging the litigation
[citations]—convince us the percentage method is a valuable tool that should
not be denied our trial courts.” (Laffitte v. Robert Half Internat. Inc.
(2016) 1 Cal.5th 480, 503.) “[T]rial courts . . . retain the discretion to
forgo a lodestar cross-check and use other means to evaluate the reasonableness
of a requested percentage fee.” (Id. at p. 506.) However, courts have
adopted a practice of cross-checking the lodestar against the value of the
class recovery because the award is then “anchored” in the time spent by
counsel. (Lealao v. Beneficial California, Inc. (2000) 82 Cal.App.4th
19, 45.)
 
Here, both of Plaintiffs’ counsel
have set forth their extensive experience and actions taken in litigating this
case. (Bokhour Decl. ¶¶ 2-12; Finkel Decl. ¶¶ 3-9, 18.) The work conducted
includes pre-litigation investigation, interviews, extensive legal research and
analysis in Defendant’s defenses as well as the merits of Plaintiff’s claims.
(Bokhour Decl. ¶ 29.) While counsels have not included a detailed time record,
an “attorney’s
testimony as to the number of hours worked is sufficient evidence to support an
award of attorney fees, even in the absence of detailed time records.” (Steiny
& Co. v. California Electric Supply Co. (2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 285,
293.) Also, counsel obtained a significant monetary recovery for the class, no
objections were received, and the average individual settlement is reasonable
based under the circumstances. (Bokhour Decl. ¶ 30; Rubalcava Decl. ¶¶ 13-14.)
 
The Court finds that the one-third
fee award is consistent with fee awards in class action cases, and the itemized
billing entries are reasonable.¿ (See Chavez v. Netflix, Inc.¿(2008) 162
Cal.App.4th 43, 66, fn. 11; see also Consumer Privacy Cases (2009) 175
Cal.App.4th 545, 557, n.13 [“ ‘ “Empirical studies show that . . . fee awards
in class actions average around one-third of the recovery” ’ ” with 25% being
the benchmark]; Alson v. NCAA (In re NCAA Athletic Grantin-Aid Cap
Antitrust Litigation) (9th Cir. 2019) 768 F.App’x 651, 653 [“We have
permitted awards of attorney’s fees ranging from 20 to 30 percent of settlement
funds, with 25 percent as the benchmark award”].) Moreover, the cross-reference
of the fees reveals that the one-third recovery approximates the lodestar
amount, and results in a positive multiplier of approximately 1.05.
Accordingly, the fees are reasonable, and the request is granted.
 
The motion for final approval seeks
$8,988.43 in litigation costs, comprised of $7,858.70 from the Bokhour Law
Group, P.C.., and $1,129.73 from The Finkel Firm. (Motion, chart at p. 16, line
2.) The preliminary request was for $15,000.00. 
 
However, costs listed for the Bokhour
Law Group reflected in the Bokhour declaration paragraph 22 are that litigation
costs actually incurred were $5,715.43. If this is the correct amount, total litigation
costs should be $6,845.16. In either case, the costs are reasonable and are
approved. But if the litigation reimbursement should actually be the lesser
number, the net settlement increases by $2,143.27.  The Court requests that Bokhour Law Group
counsel check the calculation and inform the Court at the hearing. There may be
some interlineation needed regarding the net settlement total.  
 
Settlement Administrator Fees
 
The Court preliminarily approved $6,000.00
for settlement administration costs based on the prior itemization provided by
ILYM Group Inc. Plaintiffs now submit a declaration from Laura Singh, a case
manager for ILYM Group Inc., who attests to the work and incurred costs. (Rubalcava
Decl., ¶¶ 3-7, 19.) Based on Ms. Rubalcava’s representation, the costs
associated with ILYM Group Inc.’s work amounts to $5,350. (Id. at ¶ 19.)
Thus, the Court grants the reduced amount of $5,350.00.
 
Conclusion
 
The Court approves the motion for
final approval of class action settlement.
