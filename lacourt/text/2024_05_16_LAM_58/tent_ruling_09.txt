 
            This is an
action for breach of contract. On March 12, 2024, Plaintiff Mike Speer filed
the operative First Amended Complaint (FAC) against defendants Jim Bunch, Todd
Murphy (together Defendants), and Does 1-30 alleging four causes of action for
(1) breach of contract, (2) materials furnished, (3) account stated, and (4)
unjust enrichment. 
 
            The
FAC alleges the following: On or about April 11, 2022, the parties entered into
a written contract for the renovation of the residential house located at 1009
Crestview, Glendale, CA 91202 (the Property). (FAC ¶ 9, Exh. 1.) Plaintiff
completed work on the Property as set out in the contract and requested
payment. (FAC ¶¶ 11-12.) Defendants have refused to pay the amounts due under
the contract. (FAC ¶ 13.)
 
Defendants now demur to the second, third,
and fourth causes of action in the FAC. Plaintiffs filed an opposition. As of
May 14, no reply has been filed.  
 
            The Court overrules
the demurrer as to the second and third causes of action. The Court sustains
the demurrer as to the fourth cause of action, with leave to amend. 
 
Legal Standard for
Demurrers
 
A demurrer is an objection to a
pleading, the grounds for which are apparent from either the face of the
complaint or a matter of which the court may take judicial notice. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 430.30, subd. (a); see also Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39
Cal.3d 311, 318.) The purpose of a demurrer is to challenge the
sufficiency of a pleading “by raising questions of law.” (Postley v.
Harvey (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 280, 286.) “In the construction of a
pleading, for the purpose of determining its effect, its allegations must be
liberally construed, with a view to substantial justice between the parties.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 452.) The court “ ‘ “treat[s] the demurrer as
admitting all material facts properly pleaded, but not contentions, deductions
or conclusions of fact or law . . . .” ’ ”  (Berkley v. Dowds
(2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 518, 525.) In applying these standards, the court
liberally construes the complaint to determine whether a cause of action has
been stated. (Picton v. Anderson Union High School Dist. (1996) 50
Cal.App.4th 726, 733.)
 
Second
Cause of Action – Value of Materials Furnished
 
A cause of action for reasonable
value of material furnished is a type of common count. (See Utility Audit
Co. v. City of L. A. (2003) 112 Cal.App.4th 950, 958.) A common count is
proper whenever plaintiff claims a sum of money due, either as an indebtedness
in a sum certain, or for the reasonable value of services or goods furnished.
It makes no difference that the proof shows the original transaction to be an
express contract, a contract implied in fact, or a quasi-contract. (Id.)
The only essential allegations of a common count, such as a claim for
reasonable value of materials furnished, are: (1) defendant is indebted to
plaintiff in a certain sum amount; (2) for goods sold and delivered to
defendant or services rendered; and (3) nonpayment. (See Farmers Ins.
Exchange v. Zerin (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 445, 460; see also Allen v.
Powell (1967) 248 Cal.App.2d 502, 510; Johnson v. Dixon Farms Co.
(1915) 29 Cal. App. 52, 53-55; see CACI 371.) 
 
Plaintiff’s second cause of action
is based on the following allegations: (1) Defendants became indebted to
Plaintiff for the reasonable value of equipment and materials furnished by Plaintiff
at Defendants’ request, and (2) no portion of the amount due has been paid to
Plaintiff. The FAC contains all the elements of a common count.
 
Defendants demur to this cause of
action on the ground that it simply restyles the first cause of action for
breach of contract by pleading a similar theory of recovery, but under an
implied contract rather than an express contract. It is true that common counts
cannot be maintained where there is an express contract. (4 Witkin, Cal. Proc.
5th (2008) Plead, §555, p. 683.) However, at the pleading stage, a Plaintiff
may set forth different – and even inconsistent – legal theories. “It is well
established that “a party may plead in the alternative and may make
inconsistent allegations.”” (Third Eye Blind, Inc. v. Near N. Ent. Ins.
Servs., LLC (2005) 127 Cal. App. 4th 1311, 1323, citing Adams v. Paul
(1995) 11 Cal.4th 583, 593 and Crowley v. Katleman (1994) 8 Cal.4th 666,
690–691.) Accordingly, Defendants’ demurrer to the second cause of action is overruled.

 
Third
Cause of Action – Account Stated
 
“An account stated is an agreement,
based on the prior transactions between the parties, that the items of the
account are true and that the balance struck is due and owing from one party to
another. [Citation.] When the account is assented to, ‘“it becomes a new
contract. An action on it is not founded upon the original items, but upon the
balance agreed to by the parties. …”’” (Gleason v. Klamer (1980) 103
Cal.App.3d 782, 786-787; Truestone, Inc. v. Simi West Industrial Park II
(1984) 163 Cal.App.3d 715, 725 [“‘it must appear that at the time of the
statement an indebtedness from one party to the other existed, that a balance
was then struck and agreed to be the correct sum owing from the debtor to the
creditor, and that the debtor expressly or impliedly promised to pay to the
creditor the amount thus determined to be owing.’”]; see CACI 373.)
 
Plaintiff’s second
cause of action is based on the following allegations: (1) an account was stated between the parties, wherein
and whereby it was agreed that Defendants were indebted to Plaintiff in the sum
of $20,000.00, (2) no portion of the sum has been paid to Plaintiff, and (3)
there is now due, owing and unpaid the sum of $20,000.00 plus interest.
 
Defendants demur to the third cause
of action on the ground that Plaintiff failed to allege that he formed a new
agreement with Defendants independent of the express contract. However, the FAC
expressly alleges that “an account was stated between the parties.” (FAC ¶ 22.)
Accordingly, Defendants’ demurrer to the third cause of action is overruled. 
 
Fourth
Cause of Action – Unjust enrichment 
 
The theory
of unjust enrichment requires one who acquires a benefit which may not justly
be retained, to return either the thing or its equivalent to the aggrieved
party so as not to be unjustly enriched.” 
(Lyles v. Sangadeo-Patel (2014) 225 Cal.App.4th 759, 769.)
Notably, “[u]njust enrichment is not a cause of action, however, or even a
remedy, but rather a general principle, underlying various legal doctrines and
remedies.” (Rutherford Holdings LLC v. Plaza Del Rey (2014) 223
Cal.App.4th 221, 231.)  
 
            Defendants demur to the fourth cause
of action on the ground that there is no cause of action for unjust enrichment.
The Court
notes that while Plaintiff cited cases recognizing an unjust enrichment claim
under California law, the more recent case of Rutherford Holdings, supra,
confirms that unjust enrichment is not a cause of action in California.
 
Accordingly,
Defendants’ demurrer to the fourth cause of action is sustained with leave to
amend.
 
Conclusion
 
The demurrer is overruled in part
and sustained in part. The demurrer is overruled as to the second and third
causes of action. The demurrer is sustained as to the fourth cause of action. Plaintiff
shall have leave to amend. The amended complaint shall be served and filed on
or before June 17, 2024.
