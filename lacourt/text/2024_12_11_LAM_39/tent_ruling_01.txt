CASE NUMBER:


22STCV38758




MOTION:  


Motions to Compel Discovery Responses




MOVING PARTIES:


Cross-Defendant 6th St Loft LLC




OPPOSING PARTY:


Plaintiff Lisa Berghagen as to Request for Admission Only



 
MOTIONS
            Cross-Defendant
6th St Loft, LLC (“Cross-Defendant”) moves to compel responses from Plaintiff
Lisa Kristina Berghagen (“Plaintiff”) to (1) Request for Production of
Documents, set one (“RPD”), (2) Form Interrogatories, set one (“FROG”), and (3)
Special Interrogatories, set one (“SROG”). 
Cross-Defendant also moves to deem admitted matters specified in Requests
for Admissions, set one (“RFA”) that Cross-Defendant propounded on Plaintiff.
ANALYSIS
Cross-Defendant
served the written discovery on Plaintiff on April 25, 2024 by email.  Plaintiff, therefore, had until May 29, 2024
to respond.  As of the filing date of this
motion, Cross-Defendant has not received responses from Plaintiff.  Accordingly, the motion to compel responses
to the RPD, FROG, and SROG is granted pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
sections 2030.290 and 2031.300.  Plaintiff
is ordered to serve responses to Cross-Defendant’s RPD, FROG, and SROG, without
objections, within 30 days of service of this order.
Cross-Defendant also
moves to deem admitted the matters specified in the RFA.  Where a party fails to respond to requests
for admissions, the propounding party
may move for an order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of
any matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a
monetary sanction.  (Code of Civ. Proc.,
§ 2033.280, subd. (b).)  The Court
“shall” grant a motion to deem admitted the matters specified in the requests
for admissions, “unless it finds that the party to whom the requests for
admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a
proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial
compliance with Section 2033.220.”  (Code
of Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).) 
On December 10,
2024, albeit late but before the hearing of the motion, Plaintiff served
Cross-Defendant with her responses to the RFA, which were straight denials of
each of them without objections.  As
such, the motion regarding the RFA is moot, and the Court will not grant
Cross-Defendant’s request to deem admitted matters specified in the RFA.  If Cross-Defendant is dissatisfied with
Plaintiff’s responses, it must move to compel further responses.  
Cross-Defendant requests
sanctions in connection with the motions. 
The Court finds that Plaintiff’s failure to respond to the discovery is
an abuse of the discovery process, and awards sanctions.  The Court imposes sanctions against Plaintiff
and her counsel in the amount of $900, which represents four hours of attorney
time to prepare the motions and attend the hearing at $195 per hour and $120
for filing fees.
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
Cross-Defendant’s motion to compel responses
to the RPD, FROG, and SROG is granted pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections
2030.290 and 2031.300.  Plaintiff is
ordered to serve responses to Cross-Defendant’s RPD, FROG, and SROG, without objections,
within 30 days of service of this order.
Plaintiff is to
pay sanctions in the amount of $900 to Cross-Defendant, by and through counsel, within 30 days of notice of this order.
Cross-Defendant is ordered to provide notice
of this order and to file proof of service of same.
