And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the County of Los Angeles' demurrer to the second amended complaint by Federico Carlo. Carlo alleges that the County discriminated against him based on his lack of affiliation with deputy gangs and that he was terminated by a deputy gang member. The judge sustains the demurrer to the third cause of action, which alleges discrimination based on Carlo's lack of gang affiliation, as this is not a protected category under the Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA). The judge also sustains the demurrer to the first and fifth causes of action, which allege harassment and retaliation, as these allegations do not amount to actionable conduct under FEHA.

However, the judge overrules the demurrer to the second, fourth, sixth, and seventh causes of action, which allege harassment and retaliation based on sexual harassment, as these allegations suffice to state a cause of action for a hostile work environment and retaliation. The judge permits Carlo to file an amended complaint within 20 days to address the deficiencies in his claims.
