And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the papers filed by the plaintiff and the applicable authorities concerning the Declaration of COVID-19-Related Financial Distress. The Declaration is a document that must be served on the landlord in response to a Notice to Pay Rent or Quit demanding rent that came due between March 1, 2020 and September 30, 2021. However, in this case, the Notice to Pay Rent does not demand rent that came due within this time period, so the Declaration has no impact on this action. The judge will issue a finding based on the information presented, but the specific details of the ruling are not specified in this document.
