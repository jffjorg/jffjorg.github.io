 Case Number:  23STCV29985    Hearing Date:   April 5, 2024    Dept:  47 On March 5, 2024, the Court set an Order to Show Cause Re:
the Significance of Defendant’s filing of a Declaration of COVID-19-Related
Financial Distress. The Court has reviewed the papers filed by the Plaintiff
pursuant to the Court’s order as well as the applicable authorities concerning
this Declaration and now issues its finding. 
 
A Declaration of COVID-19-Related Financial Distress is a
document that ordinarily must be served on the landlord in response to a Notice
to Pay Rent or Quit demanding rent that came due between March 1, 2020 and
September 30, 2021. (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 1179.03(g) [Declaration of Financial
Distress]; 1179.02(a); (c) [definition of COVID-19 Rental Debt].) If a tenant
fails to present a signed Declaration of Financial Distress to the landlord
within 15 days pursuant to section 1179.03(g) and an unlawful detainer action
is commenced, the tenant may file a signed Declaration of Financial Distress in
the unlawful detainer action with the Court. (Code Civ. Proc. § 1179.03(h).) If
that declaration is filed, the Court shall dismiss the case if it finds that
the failure to return a declaration of COVID-19-related financial distress
within the time required was the result of mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or
excusable neglect, as interpreted under section 473(b). (Id.) Here,
however, the Notice to Pay Rent that is the basis of the action does not demand
rent which came due within the covered time period. (See Complaint Exh. 2.
p.1.) Defendant’s Declaration of Financial Distress therefore has no impact on
this action.
