CASE:                         Lauren Redmond v. Charles Schwab &
Co., Inc.
 
CASE NO.:                 23STCV15028            
 
MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES TO
REQUESTS FOR PRODUCTION AND SPECIAL INTERROGATORIES; REQUEST FOR SANCTIONS

 
MOVING PARTY:               (1)(2) Defendant Charles Schwab & Co., Inc.
 
RESPONDING PARTY(S): Plaintiff Lauren
Redmond
 
STATEMENT
OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
            This is an employment discrimination action that was filed on June 28,
2023. Plaintiff alleges that she was harassed and terminated based on her
gender and a perceived disability. 
 
Defendant moves to compel further
responses to Requests for Production and Special Interrogatories propounded to
Plaintiff. 
            
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Defendant’s Motion to Compel
Further Responses to Requests for Production is GRANTED.
 
            Defendant’s
Motion to Compel Further Responses to Special Interrogatories is GRANTED.
 
            Plaintiff
is ordered to produce verified, code-compliant responses without objections,
excluding those revealing medical information or records, within 30 days of
this order. 
 
            Defendant’s
request for sanctions is DENIED. 
 
            This
order is conditioned on Defendant paying $60 in filing fees within 5 days of
this ruling. 
 
DISCUSSION:
 
Multiple Motions
 
            Multiple
motions should not be combined into a single filing.¿(See¿Govt. Code,¿§
70617(a)(4) [setting forth the required filing fee for each motion,
application, or any other paper or request requiring a hearing];¿see¿also¿Weil
& Brown, Civil Procedure Before Trial, [8:1140.1] at 8F-60 (The Rutter
Group 2011)¿[“Motions to compel compliance with separate discovery requests
ordinarily should be filed separately.”].) 
 
Here, Defendant seeks in one motion
to compel further responses to requests for production and special
interrogatories. Combining multiple motions under the guise of one motion with
one hearing reservation manipulates the Court Reservation System and unfairly
jumps ahead of other litigants. Moreover, combining motions to avoid payment of
separate filing fees deprives the Court of filing fees it is otherwise entitled
to collect.
 
            The Court
therefore conditions its ruling on this motion on the payment of an additional
$60 in filing fees within 10 days of this order.
 
Legal Standard
 
Under Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.310, subdivision (a), a court
may order a party to serve a further response to a demand for inspection when
the court finds that: “(1) A statement of compliance with the demand is
incomplete[;] (2) A representation of inability to comply is inadequate,
incomplete, or evasive[; or] (3) An objection in the response is without merit
or too general.”
 
The burden is on the moving party to “set forth specific facts showing
good cause justifying the discovery sought by the demand.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.310, subd. (b)(1).) These facts must also be set forth in a separate
statement filed by the moving party. (Cal. Rules of Court Rule 3.1345(c).) This
burden “is met simply by a fact-specific showing of relevance.” (TBG Ins.
Servs. Corp. v. Superior Court (2002) 96 Cal.App.4th 443, 448.)
 
Under Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.300, subdivision (a), a court
may order a party to serve a further response to an interrogatory when the
court finds that: “(1) An answer to a particular interrogatory is evasive or
incomplete[;] (2) An exercise of the option to produce documents under Section
2030.230 is unwarranted or the required specification of those documents is
inadequate[; or] (3) An objection to an interrogatory is without merit or too
general.”
 
The burden is on the responding party to justify any objection or failure
to fully answer the interrogatories. Fairmont Ins. Co. v. Superior Court
(2000) 22 Cal.4th 245, 255.
 
Timeliness
 
A motion to compel further
responses to requests for production or interrogatories must be served “within
45 days of the service of the verified response, or any supplemental verified
response, or on or before any specific later date to which the propounding
party and the responding party have agreed in writing.” (Code Civ. Proc. §§
2030.300(c); 2031.310(c).) The 45-day requirement is mandatory and
jurisdictional. (Sexton v. Superior Court¿(1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1403,
1410.)
 
Defendant served Requests for
Production (Set One) on Plaintiff on July 13, 2023, and Special Interrogatories
on August 14, 2023. (Declaration of Eric May ISO Mot. ¶¶ 3-5, Exhs. 1-2.)
Plaintiff served objection-only responses on September 18, 2023. (Id. ¶¶
8-9, Exhs. 5-6.) Following an Informal Discovery Conference and multiple email
exchanges, Plaintiff’s counsel categorically stated in writing that Defendant’s
time to bring this motion has been extended indefinitely. (May Decl. Exh. 10
p.5.) Although this statement does not contain a “specific later date,”
Plaintiff does not challenge the timeliness of the motion and expressly states
an intention to supplement her responses. (See Declaration of Michael Freiman
ISO Opp. ¶ 11.) The Court therefore finds that the motion is timely. 
 
Meet and Confer
 
A party making a motion to compel further responses must also include a
declaration stating facts showing a “reasonable and good faith attempt” to
resolve informally the issues presented by the motion before filing the motion.
(Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2016.040, 2030.300(b)(2); 2031.310(b)(2).)
 
The Declaration of Defendant’s
counsel in support of the motion sets forth the extensive history of Defendant’s
attempts to informally resolve the dispute concerning Plaintiff’s responses to
these discovery requests. (See generally May Decl.) The Court therefore finds
that Defendant has satisfied its statutory meet and confer obligations. 
 
Analysis
 
            Defendant
moves to compel further responses to requests for production and to special interrogatories
propounded to Plaintiff. 
 
Defendant served requests for
Production on July 13, 2023 and Special Interrogatories on August 14, 2023.
(May Decl. ¶¶ 3-5, Exhs. 1-2.) Plaintiff served objection-only responses on
September 18, 2023. (Id. ¶¶ 8-9, Exhs. 5-6.) The parties came before the
Court for an Informal Discovery Conference on November 22, 2023 and thereupon
stipulated to Plaintiff providing substantive responses by December 18, 2023 to
all discovery other than those revealing medical information or records. (May
Decl. Exh. 8.) Plaintiff’s counsel concedes that no supplemental responses have
been provided, and states Plaintiff suffered a medical emergency in December
2023. (Freiman Decl. ¶ 5.) Plaintiff’s counsel unequivocally states that
Plaintiff intends to respond in compliance with the Court’s November 22 order.
(Id. ¶ 11.) Thus, Plaintiff has conceded the merits of the motion, and
Defendants are entitled to an order compelling further responses. 
 
Sanctions
 
            Defendant
also requests monetary or terminating sanctions. 
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.030 authorizes the Court to impose
monetary sanctions on any attorney engaging in the misuse of the discovery
process by requiring that attorney to pay the reasonable expenses incurred by
anyone as a result of that conduct. Code of Civil Procedure sections
2030.300(d) and 2030.310(h) require the Court to impose sanctions against any
party who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel further response,
unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial
justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction
unjust.
 
A party engaging
in this conduct may be subject to nonmonetary sanctions including terminating
sanctions. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2023.030(d).)  “[T]rial courts
should select sanctions tailored to the harm caused by the misuse of the
discovery process and should not exceed what is required to protect the party
harmed by the misuse of the discovery process.” (Dept. of Forestry &
Fire Protection v. Howell (2017) 18 Cal.App.5th 154, 191, disapproved of on
other grounds in Presbyterian Camp & Conference Centers, Inc. v.
Superior Court (2021) 12 Cal.5th 493.) Sanctions are generally imposed using
an incremental approach. (Id.) Generally, the appropriate sanctions when
a party repeatedly and willfully fails to provide evidence to the opposing
party as required by the discovery rules is preclusion of that evidence from
the trial. (Juarez v. Boy Scouts of America, Inc. (2000) 81 Cal.App.4th
377, 390, disapproved of on other grounds by Brown v. USA Taekwondo (2021)
11 Cal.5th 204.)
 
In considering a motion for terminating
sanctions, the Court is to attempt to “tailor the sanction to the harm caused
by the withheld discovery.” (Collisson
& Kaplan v. Hartunian (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 1611, 1618-1619.)  
 
[T]he question before this court is not
whether the trial court should have imposed a lesser sanction; rather, the
question is whether the trial court abused its discretion by imposing the
sanction it chose. [Citation.] Moreover, imposition of a lesser sanction would
have permitted [defendants] to benefit from their stalling tactics. [Citation.]
The trial court did not abuse its discretion by tailoring the sanction to the
particular abuse.
 
(Id. at 1620.)  Moreover, in deciding whether to impose a
terminating sanction, the trial court is to consider the totality of the
circumstances: the “conduct of the party to determine if the actions were
willful; the detriment to the propounding party; and the number of formal and
informal attempts to obtain the discovery.” (Lang v. Hochman (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 1225, 1246.)
 
            Here, the
record does not suggest that Plaintiff’s failure to comply with Court orders
was willful, and, moreover, there is nothing to suggest that the drastic remedy
of terminating sanctions is appropriate to the injury Defendant has suffered
from the delay in production of responsive documents at this time. Further
still, the Court is not inclined to award sanctions, monetary or otherwise,
where the moving party has improperly sought to compel responses to multiple
sets of discovery in a single motion.  In
addition, given Plaintiff’s explanation that her medical emergency interfered
with her ability to provide supplemental responses, it would be unjust to
impose monetary sanctions on her.
 
CONCLUSION:

 
            Accordingly,
Defendant’s Motion to Compel Further Responses to Requests for Production is
GRANTED.
 
            Defendant’s
Motion to Compel Further Responses to Special Interrogatories is GRANTED.
 
            Plaintiff
is ordered to produce verified, code-compliant responses without objections,
excluding those revealing medical information or records, within 30 days of
this order. 
 
            Defendant’s
request for sanctions is DENIED. 
 
            This
order is conditioned on Defendant paying $60 in filing fees within 5 days of
this ruling. 
 
            Moving
Party to give notice.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
