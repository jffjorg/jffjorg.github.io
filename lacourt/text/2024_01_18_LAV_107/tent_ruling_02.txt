COURT’S
  [TENTATIVE] ORDER RE: ORDER GRANTING THE RIGHT TO ORDER AND APPLICATION FOR WRIT OF
  ATTACHMENT
 



 
[THE FOLLOWING IS A TENTATIVE RULING IN THE ABOVE CASE]: 
 
[Tentative]
Ruling:   The court GRANTS the right to
attach order and a writ of attachment. 
 
Plaintiff,
A & E Construction & Painting,
Inc., seeks right to attach order and a writ of attachment against
Defendant Santos Vasquez in the amount of $88,484.70. 
 
Allegations in the Complaint
 
Plaintiff
A&E Construction & Painting, Inc. (“Plaintiff”) filed the First Amended
Complaint (“FAC”) on December 8, 2023, against Santos Vasquez (“Vasquez”), SMC
Pools & General Construction, Inc. (“SMC”), and Does 1-10 (collectively,
“Defendants”). Plaintiff claims that it entered into an oral agreement with
Defendants for the sale of a 2010 Bobcat skip loader, model # S570, serial
number ALM429632 (“Tractor 1”) which Defendants have failed to pay for. (FAC ¶¶
13-19.) Moreover, Plaintiff claims that Defendants failed to return a 2021
Bobcat skip loader, Model S7 40, serial number B3BT16446 (“Tractor 2”) which
they were storing. (FAC ¶¶ 24-25.) Lastly, Plaintiff alleges that by
withholding Tractor 1 and Tractor 2, Defendants received a benefit from both
items and were unjustly enriched. (FAC ¶¶ 31-32.)
 
The First
Amended Complaint alleges causes of action for (1) breach of an oral contract,
(2) conversion, and (3) common count- restitution for unjust enrichment. (FAC
p.1.)
 
On December
21, 2023, Plaintiff applied for a right to attach order and a writ of
attachment in the total amount of $88,484.70. 
 
STANDARD OF REVIEW
 
“Upon the
filing of the complaint or at any time thereafter, the plaintiff may apply
pursuant to this article for a right to attach order and a writ of attachment
by filing an application for the order and writ with the court in which the
action is brought.”  (CCP § 484.010.)
 
The
application shall be executed under oath and must include:
 
(1)  a statement showing that the
attachment is sought to secure the recovery on a claim upon which an attachment
may be issued;
(2)  a statement of the amount to be
secured by the attachment;
(3)  a statement that the attachment is
not sought for a purpose other than the recovery on the claim upon which the
attachment is based;
(4)  a statement that the applicant has
no information or belief that the claim is discharged or that the prosecution
of the action is stayed in a proceeding under the Bankruptcy Act (11 U.S.C.
section 101 et seq.); and 
(5)  a description of the property to be
attached under the writ of attachment and a statement that the plaintiff is
informed and believes that such property is subject to attachment.
 
(CCP §
484.020.)
 
“The
application [for a writ of attachment] shall be supported by an affidavit
showing that the plaintiff on the facts presented would be entitled to a
judgment on the claim upon which the attachment is based.”  (CCP § 484.030.)  Statutory attachment procedures are purely creations of the legislature and
as such “are subject to ‘strict construction.’” 
(Hobbs v. Weiss (1999) 73 Cal.App.4th 76, 79 [citing Vershbow
v. Reiner (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 879, 882]; see also Nakasone v. Randall
(1982) 129 Cal.App.3d 757, 761.)  A judge
does not have authority to order any attachment that is not provided for by the
attachment statutes.  (Jordan-Lyon Productions, Ltd. v. Cineplex
Odeon Corp. (1994) 29 Cal.App.4th 1459, 1466.) “The declarations in the
moving papers must contain evidentiary facts, stated ‘with particularity,’ and based on actual
personal knowledge with all documentary evidence properly identified and
authenticated.” (Hobbs, supra, 73 Cal.App.4th at p. 79–80
[citing CCP § 482.040].)  “In contested applications, the court
must consider the relative merits of the positions of the respective parties
and make a determination of the probable outcome of the litigation.”  (Hobbs, supra, 73 Cal.App.4th at p. 80 [ellipses and quotation marks
omitted].)
 
The Court
shall issue a right to attach order if the Court finds all of the following:
(1)   The claim upon which the attachment
is based is one upon which an attachment may be issued.
(2)   The plaintiff has established the
probable validity of the claim upon which the attachment is based.
(3)   The attachment is not sought for a
purpose other than the recovery on the claim upon which the attachment is
based.
(4)   The amount to be secured by the
attachment is greater than zero.
 
(Code Civ.
Proc. § 484.090.) 
 
ANALYSIS
 
Probable
Validity of Plaintiff’s Claims:
 
“A claim
has ‘probable validity’ where it is more likely than not that the plaintiff
will obtain a judgment against the defendant on that claim.” (CCP §
481.190.)  
 
Breach of Contract 


Plaintiff claims it is entitled to a writ of attachment and
right to attach order against Defendant in connection with its cause of action
for breach of the contract. (Dec. Alas ¶ 3.) “The elements of a breach
of oral contract claim are the same as those for a breach of written contract:
a contract; its performance or excuse for nonperformance; breach; and damages.”
(Stockton Mortg., Inc. v. Tope (2014) 233 Cal.App.4th 437, 453.)
 
Here, Plaintiff
claims it has sufficiently alleged a
claim for breach of contract. For instance, Plaintiff states that (1) an oral
contract existed between the parties for the sale of Tractor 1 because the
invoice provided shows that Plaintiff owned Tractor 1 which is now in
Defendant’s possession. (FAC p.4-5, Dec. Alas ¶ 3; Ex. A.) Further, Plaintiff
provides that (2) it performed its part of the contract because it gave
Defendant possession of Tractor 1. (Id. at ¶ 4.) Plaintiff argues that
Defendant (3) breached the agreement because Mr. Vazquez failed to make the
payments and failed to return Tractor 1. (Id. at ¶¶ 4-7.) Therefore,
Plaintiff suffered damages (4) because Defendant still owes $44,484.70. (Id.
at ¶ 9.) Defendant did not file an opposition.
Thus, Plaintiff satisfies the requirements
for issuance of an attachment order by proving probable validity in its breach
of contract claim. 
Common Count-Conversion 
Conversion is “the wrongful
exercise of dominion over the property of another.” Lee v. Hanley,
(2015) 61 Cal. 4th 1225 (quotations omitted). To establish a claim for
conversion, a plaintiff must plead: “(1) the plaintiff's ownership or right to
possession of the property; (2) the defendant's conversion by a wrongful act or
disposition of property rights; and (3) damages.” Id. (quotations
omitted). 
Here, the Plaintiff shows
that he meets the conversion claim because he (1) provides an invoice for
Tractor 2 showing that he owns it; (2) that Defendant kept Tractor 2 and used
it without permission; and (3) Plaintiff suffered damages in the amount of at
least $39,000. (FAC ¶¶ 23-27.) Defendant did not file an opposition. 
Thus, Plaintiff satisfies the requirements
for issuance of an attachment order by proving probable validity in its
conversion claim. 
Unjust Enrichment 
“The
elements of an unjust enrichment claim are the receipt of a benefit and the
unjust retention of the benefit at the expense of another.” (Peterson v.
Cellco P’ship (2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 1583, 1593 [internal brackets and
quotations omitted].)
 
Here,
Plaintiff states that Defendant is unlawfully withholding Tractor 1 and Tractor
2 and is therefore benefitting from the property. (FAC ¶¶ 31-32.) 
Thus, Plaintiff satisfies the requirements
for issuance of an attachment order by proving probable validity in its unjust
enrichment claim. 
Basis
of Attachment:
 
The Court
shall issue a right to attach order if the claim upon which the attachment is
based is one upon which an attachment may be issued. (CCP § 484.090.) “[A]n
attachment may be issued only in an action on a claim or claims for money, each
of which is based upon a contract, express or implied, where the total amount
of the claim or claims is a fixed or readily ascertainable amount not less than
five hundred dollars ($500) exclusive of costs, interest, and attorney’s fees.”
(CCP § 483.010, subd. (a).) “If the action is against a defendant who is a
natural person, an attachment may be issued only on a claim which arises out of
the conduct by the defendant of a trade, business, or profession.” (CCP §
483.010, subd. (c).)
 
Here,
there is a claim for money based on an express oral contract because the
parties entered into an oral contract on March 18, 2021. (Dec. Alas ¶ 3.)
Moreover, Plaintiff provides evidence that Tractor 1 and Tractor 2 have a
readily ascertainable amount above $500 exclusive of costs, interest, and
attorney’s fees. (Id. at ¶¶ 17-18; Ex. A-Bobcat Invoice- Tractor 1;
Ex.B- Bobcat Invoice Tractor 2.) Although the action is against Santos Vasquez
who is a natural person, the claim arises out of his conduct in the
construction trade. (Id. at ¶ 2.) 
 
Additionally,
based on the unopposed application, Plaintiff has established its entitlement
to the requested right to attach order and writ of attachment.  (See CCP
484.090(a) & (b).)
 
Therefore,
there is a basis for attachment. 
 
Purpose
and Amount of Attachment:
 
Code of
Civil Procedure section 484.090 states that the Court shall issue a right to
attach order if “the attachment is not sought for a purpose other than the
recovery on the claim upon which the attachment is based . . . [and] the amount
to be secured by the attachment is greater than zero.”
 
Here, Plaintiff attests on Form AT-105 that its
application for attachment is not sought for a purpose other than the recovery
on a claim upon which the attachments are based. (AT-105 ¶ 4.)  There is no indication that the application
is sought for any other purpose. Accordingly, the Court finds that Plaintiff
has complied with Code of Civil Procedure sections 484.020 and 484.090.
 
Subject
Property:
 
Code Civil
Procedure section 487.010(a) provides that “[w]here the defendant is a
corporation, all corporate property for which a method of levy is provided” is
subject to attachment. “Where the defendant is a natural person, the
description of the property shall be reasonably adequate to permit the
defendant to identify the specific property sought to be attached.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 484.020, subd. (e).)  
 
Here, Plaintiff seeks attachment of “One-2010 Bobcat skip
loader, model # S570, serial number ALM429632” ("Tractor 1”) and “One-2021
Bobcat skip loader, Model S7 40, serial number B3BT16446” (“Tractor 2”).
(AT-105 p.2.) Thus, Plaintiff has properly identified the property to attach
against this Defendant.
 
CONCLUSION
 
For the foregoing reasons, the Court GRANTS the right to attach order and
application for writ of attachment.  
 
Code Civil Procedure
Section 489.210 requires the plaintiff to file an undertaking before issuance
of a writ of attachment. Code Civil Procedure Section 489.220 provides that,
unless an objection has been made, “the amount of an undertaking filed pursuant
to this article shall be ten thousand dollars ($10,000).” Here, no undertaking
has been submitted by the Plaintiff. Therefore, the granting of the applications is conditioned
upon plaintiff posting an undertaking in the amount of $10,000.00 and
submission of a proposed right to attach order and order for issuance of writ
of attachment after hearing (Form AT-120).



                                                                                                                 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
