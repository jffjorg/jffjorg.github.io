Background
            This is a
commercial unlawful detainer case. On October 14, 2022, Plaintiff ROIC
California LLC filed this the First Amended Complaint against Defendants Chunil
Park d/b/a Kyoto Sushi, Soo Sung Nam d/b/a Kyoto Sushi and Does 1 through 20 (collectively
“Defendants”) for injuries arising from (1) breach of written lease, (2) for
account stated, and (3) money had and received. (Complaint p.3-4.) 
 
On May 17, 2023, Plaintiff served Requests for
Admission, Set Two on both Defendants by email and U.S. mail. (Yebri Decl. ¶ 2;
Ex. A.) Defendants’ responses were due on June 18, 2023. (Id. at ¶ 3.)
However, Plaintiff did not receive any responses or objections by the due date.
(Id.) On June 22, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel sent a meet and confer
letter to Defendants, by email and U.S. mail, requesting responses no later
than June 29, 2023. (Id. at ¶ 4.) 
 
Defendants’ counsel failed to respond to the meet
and confer letter. (Id.) To date, no responses to the Requests for
Admission have been provided by Defendant Soo Sung Nam. (Id. at ¶ 5.)
However, on December 29, 2023, Defendant Chunil Park served his responses with
his opposition. (Smith Decl. ¶ 2; Ex. 1.) Plaintiff filed
the instant motion on June 29, 2023, compelling Defendant to have the requests
for admission deemed admitted.  Plaintiff
also requests monetary sanctions from each Defendant. 
 
Defendant
Chunil Park filed his opposition on December 29, 2023. Plaintiff filed its
reply on January 10, 2024. However, Defendant Sung Nam d/b/a Kyoto Sushi did not file an opposition.
Plaintiff filed a notice of non-opposition on January 10, 2024.
Analysis
 
Deem Admitted 
Where a party fails to timely
respond to a request for admission, the propounding party may move for an order
that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in
the requests be deemed admitted. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd.
(b).)  The party who failed to respond waives any objections to the
demand, unless the court grants them relief from the waiver, upon a showing
that the party (1) has subsequently served a substantially compliant response,
and (2) that the party’s failure to respond was the result of mistake,
inadvertence, or excusable neglect.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subds.
(a)(1)-(2).)  The court shall grant a motion to deem admitted requests for
admissions, “unless it finds that the party to whom the requests for admission
have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed
response to the requests for admission that is in substantial compliance with
Section 2033.220.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).) 
 
Defendant
Chunil Park d/b/a Kyoto Sushi
 
Here, on May 17, 2023, Plaintiff’s
counsel served Requests for Admission, Set Two, on
Defendant Chunil Park. (Yebri Decl. ¶ 2; Ex. A.) On December 29, 2023, Defendant
Chunil Park served his responses with his opposition to this motion. (Id.
at ¶6.)  
            In his opposition, Defendant argues
that Plaintiff’s motion must be denied as Mr. Park provided full verified
responses. (Opp. p.3.) Moreover, Defendant Chunil Park argues that the failure
to provide timely responses to the Requests for Admissions was the product of
mistake, inadvertence, and excusable neglect. (Opp. p.5.)
            However, Plaintiff argues that the
responses were not substantially compliant with  Section 2033.220 because they did not provide
complete, substantive responses to each Request for Admission. (Reply p.1.)
Plaintiff argues that the responses failed to comply with each element of Form
Interrogatory 17.1 for each Request for Admission. (Id.) 
Significantly, Defendant filed verified responses, not unverified
responses, that satisfied C.C.P §2033.220 because they are complete and
straightforward. (St. Mary v. Superior Ct., 223 Cal. App. 4th 762, 780,
167 Cal. Rptr. 3d 517, 531–32 (2014).) For example, the response to Form
Interrogatory 17.1 states “Responding Party executed the lease agreement dated
May 2005 attached as Exhibit A to Plaintiff’s Complaint. Responding Party did
not execute any further leases or extensions. Parties with knowledge of these
facts are Responding Party, Soo Sung Nam, and Propounding Party.”  
Thus, Plaintiff is not entitled to an order deeming Requests for
Admissions, Set Two, admitted in regard to Defendant Chunil Park. 
 
Defendant
Soo Sung Nam d/b/a Kyoto Sushi
 
Here, on May 17, 2023, Plaintiff’s
counsel served Requests for Admission, Set Two, on
Defendant Soo Sung Nam. (Yebri Decl. ¶ 2; Ex. A.) To date, Defendant Soo
Sung Nam or his counsel have responded to the discovery requests. Therefore,
Plaintiff is entitled to an order deeming Requests for Admissions, Set Two,
admitted in regard to Defendant Soo Sung Nam. 
 
Monetary Sanctions 
 
Where a party fails to provide a
timely response to requests for admission, “[i]t is
mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing
with Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to
serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated this
motion.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).) 
 
Defendant
Chunil Park d/b/a Kyoto Sushi
 
Here,
Plaintiff’s attorney seeks $2,685.00 in monetary sanctions for five hours in preparing
this motion and also hearing time, billed at $525.00 per hour plus a $60.00
court filing fee. (Yebri Decl.  ¶ 9.) Defendant argues that awarding the
sanctions would not be in the interest of justice because the untimely response
was due to his former counsel’s inadvertence, mistake, and excusable neglect.
(Opp. p.6.) Moreover, he argues that he was not involved during the term of the
Second Amendment to the original Lease which was when there was a potential
breach. (Id.) Nevertheless, Defendant’s untimely response led to
the filing of this motion and therefore, sanctions are mandatory. 
 
¿However,
the amount sought is greatly excessive given the simplicity of this Motion,
even with the opposition and reply. Moreover, this motion is nearly identical
to that of Defendant Soo Sung Nam’s motion. Thus, the Court finds $847.50,
based on one and half hours of attorney time and the filing fee, to be
reasonable.¿ 
 
Defendant Soo
Sung Nam d/b/a Kyoto Sushi
 
Here,
Plaintiff’s attorney seeks $2,685.00 in monetary sanctions for five hours in preparing
this motion and also hearing time, billed at $525.00 per hour plus a $60.00
court filing fee. (Yebri Decl.  ¶ 9.) 
The
Court finds Defendant’s failure to respond to Plaintiff’s discovery requests a
misuse of the discovery process. The Court is also required to impose a
monetary sanction on Defendant for his failure to respond to the Requests for
Admission under Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.280, subdivision (c).¿However,
the amount sought is greatly excessive given the simplicity of this Motion and
the lack of opposition and reply. Moreover, this motion is nearly identical to
that of Defendant Chunil Park’s motion. Thus, the Court finds $585.00, based on
one hour of attorney time and the filing fee, to be reasonable.¿ 
 
Conclusion
 
For
the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff’s Motion to Deem the Truth of Matters in
Requests for Admission Set Two Admitted as to Defendant Chunil Park is DENIED. 
However,
Plaintiff’s Motion to Deem the Truth of Matters in Requests for Admission Set
Two Admitted as to Defendant Soo Sung Nam is GRANTED. 
Plaintiff’s
request for sanctions as to Defendant Chunil Park is also GRANTED in the amount
of $847.50 to be paid by Defendant Chunil Park to Plaintiff’s counsel within
thirty (30) days of notice of this order.¿
Plaintiff’s
request for sanctions as to Defendant Soo Sung Nam is also GRANTED in the
amount of $585.00 to be paid by Defendant Soo Sung Nam to Plaintiff’s counsel
within thirty (30) days of notice of this order.
¿Moving party to give notice.     
 
Dated this 18th day of January 2024
