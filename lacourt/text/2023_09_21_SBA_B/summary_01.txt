```

Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denied Defendant's Motion for Terminating Sanctions and Monetary Sanctions. The motion was based on the allegation that Plaintiff and Plaintiff's counsel disobeyed a court order to serve verified responses to Defendant's Form Interrogatories, Set One, based on attorney Jerry Udeochu's alleged forgery of documents. However, the judge found that Plaintiff did serve responses to the discovery requests on August 8, 2023, and therefore did not comply with the court order. The judge did not grant the motion because Plaintiff's conduct did not amount to a misuse of the discovery process and there was no evidence of willful non-compliance with the court order.

The Judge found that the Plaintiff did serve responses to the discovery requests, but the Defendant believes that the verification attached to the responses is not genuine. The Judge declined to exercise its discretion to impose a terminating sanction against the Plaintiff, as there is no evidence to support the Defendant's claim that the Plaintiff engaged in a misuse of the discovery process.
