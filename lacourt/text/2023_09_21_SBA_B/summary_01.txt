Significant Statements:
  - "The trial court may order a terminating sanction for discovery abuse 'after considering the totality of the circumstances: [the] conduct of the party to determine if the actions were willful; the detriment to the propounding party; and the number of formal and informal attempts to obtain the discovery.'"
  - "Doomsday" sanctions are reserved for parties who commit willful, repeated, violations of court orders.
  - "Generally, [a] decision to order terminating sanctions should not be made lightly. But where a violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction."

Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denied Defendant's Motion for Terminating Sanctions and Monetary Sanctions. The motion was based on the allegation that Plaintiff and Plaintiff's counsel disobeyed a court order to serve verified responses to Defendant's Form Interrogatories, Set One, based on attorney Jerry Udeochu's alleged forgery of documents. However, the judge found that Plaintiff did serve responses to the discovery requests on August 8, 2023, and therefore did not comply with the court order. The judge did not grant the motion because Plaintiff's conduct did not amount to a misuse of the discovery process and there was no evidence of willful non-compliance with the court order.
