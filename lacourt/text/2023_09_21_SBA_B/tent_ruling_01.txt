            Background
 
            Plaintiff filed the Complaint on March 25, 2020. Plaintiff
alleges the following facts. Plaintiff was a tenant and rented a room from
Defendant. Defendant sexually harassed Plaintiff on numerous occasions.
Defendant then evicted Plaintiff when she refused Defendant’s advances and assaulted
and battered her when she warned other potential tenants.  Plaintiff alleges causes of action for: 1. Retaliatory
Eviction; 2. Breach of the Implied Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment; 3. Constructive
Eviction; 4. Battery; 5. Assault; 6. IIED; 7. NIED; 8. Violation of Gov. Code
12955(a); 9. Violation of Gov. Code 12955(f); 10. Violation of Civ. Code 51.9;
11. Violation of California Code of Regulations 12120. 
 
            Motion for
Terminating Sanctions 
 
            If a party fails to comply with a court order compelling
discovery responses or attendance at a deposition, the court may impose
monetary, issue, evidence, or terminating sanctions.  CCP § 2025.450(h) (depositions); §
2030.290(c) (interrogatories); § 2031.300(c) (demands for production of
documents).  CCP § 2023.030 provides
that, “[t]o the extent authorized by the chapter governing any particular
discovery method . . . , the court, after notice to any affected party, person,
or attorney, and after opportunity for hearing, may impose . . .  [monetary, issue, evidence, or terminating]
sanctions against anyone engaging in conduct that is a misuse of the discovery
process . . . .”  Code of Civil Procedure
§ 2023.010 provides that “[m]isuses of the discovery process include, but are
not limited to, the following:  . .
.  (d) Failing to respond or to submit to
an authorized method of discovery. . . . (g) Disobeying a court order to
provide discovery. . . . .”  
 
            “The trial court may order a terminating sanction for
discovery abuse ‘after considering the totality of the circumstances:  [the] conduct of the party to determine if
the actions were willful; the detriment to the propounding party; and the
number of formal and informal attempts to obtain the discovery.’”  Los
Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez (2014) 223 Cal. App. 4th 377, 390
(quoting Lang v. Hochman (2000) 77
Cal. App. 4th 1225, 1246).  “Generally,
‘[a] decision to order terminating sanctions should not be made lightly.  But where a violation is willful, preceded by
a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not
produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial court is justified in
imposing the ultimate sanction.’”  Los Defensores, 223 Cal. App. 4th
at 390 (citation omitted).   
   
            “Under this standard, trial courts have properly imposed
terminating sanctions when parties have willfully disobeyed one or more
discovery orders.”  Los Defensores, 223 Cal. App. 4th at 390 (citing Lang, 77 Cal. App. 4th at 1244-1246
(discussing cases)); see, e.g., Collisson & Kaplan v. Hartunian
(1994) 21 Cal. App. 4th 1611, 1617-1622 (terminating sanctions imposed after
defendants failed to comply with one court order to produce discovery); Laguna Auto Body v. Farmers Ins. Exchange
(1991) 231 Cal. App. 3d 481, 491, disapproved on other grounds in Garcia v. McCutchen (1997) 16 Cal. 4th
469, 478, n. 4 (terminating sanctions imposed against plaintiff for failing to
comply with a discovery order and for violating various discovery statutes).
 
            The type of severe sanctions sought by plaintiff such as
issue, evidentiary, and terminating sanctions for failure to comply with a
court order are allowed only where the failure was willful.  See
R.S. Creative, Inc. v. Creative Cotton, Ltd. (1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 486,
495; See also Vallbona v. Springer (1996) 43 Cal.App.4th 1525, 1545; See also Biles v. Exxon Mobil Corp. (2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 1315,
1327.  
 
            “Doomsday” sanctions are reserved for parties who commit
willful, repeated, violations of court orders.  Los Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez
(2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 377, 390. 
“Generally, [a] decision to order terminating sanctions should not be
made lightly. But where a violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse,
and the evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance
with the discovery rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate
sanction.”  Id.  
 
            Defendant moves, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure §
2023.030, for terminating sanctions against Plaintiff, as well as monetary
sanctions. The motion is made on the grounds that Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s
counsel disobeyed with the Court order to serve verified responses within 10
days to Defendant’s Form Interrogatories, Set One, based on attorney Jerry
Udeochu’s alleged forgery of documents. 
 
            Upon a review of the grounds for the motion, it is
apparent that Plaintiff did serve responses to the discovery requests, at
issue, on August 8, 2023. Thus, this is not a situation in which Plaintiff did
not comply with the Court order. However, Defendant apparently believes that
the verification attached to the responses is not genuine. The Court cannot
grant a motion for terminating sanctions simply based on Defendant’s own
self-serving belief that a verification was not genuine.
 
            Thus, the Court finds that Plaintiff has not engaged in
conduct that is a misuse of the discovery process by disobeying the Court’s
order of July 28, 2023. The Court thus finds that it is not appropriate, and
declines to exercise its discretion, to impose a terminating sanction against Plaintiff
pursuant to CCP § 2023.030(d).  
 
            For the foregoing reasons, Defendant’s Motion for
Terminating Sanctions and Monetary Sanctions is denied. 
 
            Plaintiff is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
