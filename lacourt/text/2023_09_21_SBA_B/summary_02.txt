The judge has ruled on the demurrer and motion to strike portions of the complaint. The demurrer was filed by the defendants, Laibco, LLC, et al., and argued that the complaint fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. The judge has overruled the demurrer with respect to the first and second causes of action, which allege elder abuse and violations of the Patient's Bill of Rights. The judge found that the complaint states sufficient facts to meet the standard for punitive damages and enhanced remedies under the Elder Abuse Act.

The judge also denied the motion to strike portions of the complaint, finding that the prayer for relief was adequately stated and that the complaint did not contain irrelevant, false, or improper matter.

The judge ordered the defendants to file and serve an answer to the complaint within 10 days and ordered the plaintiffs to give notice of this ruling.
