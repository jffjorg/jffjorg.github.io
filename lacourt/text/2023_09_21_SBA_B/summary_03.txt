And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Tesla, Inc.'s motion to compel arbitration without prejudice. The motion was made because the plaintiff, Skei McGrath Saulnier, has alleged that the subject 2020 Tesla Model X suffered from widespread defects and that Tesla Motors, Inc. (the defendant) is responsible for those defects. The judge found that there is no entity named "Tesla Inc." that has been named in the complaint or served with the complaint, and therefore, the judge cannot order arbitration at this time. The judge suggested that the defendant may need to properly name and identify itself in the complaint before a motion to compel arbitration can be made.

## Case Summary: Skei McGrath Saulnier v. Tesla Motors Inc., et al. (22TRCV01443)

**Case Number:** 22TRCV01443
**Plaintiffs:** Skei McGrath Saulnier
**Defendant:** Tesla Motors, Inc.

**Judge:** Honorable Gary Y. Tanaka
**Hearing Date:** September 21, 2023
**Department:** B, Los Angeles Superior Court - Southwest District

**Background:**

* Plaintiffs filed a Complaint on December 9, 2022 alleging defects in their 2020 Tesla Model X manufactured and distributed by Defendant Tesla Motors, Inc.
* Plaintiffs claim breach of warranty under the Song-Beverly Act.

**Legal Issues:**

* **Motion to Compel Arbitration:** Tesla, Inc. moved to compel arbitration, arguing that a valid arbitration agreement exists between the parties that requires arbitration of the claims. 

**Judge's Ruling:**

* **Denied without prejudice.** 
* The motion is denied because "Tesla, Inc." is not named in the Complaint nor served. The only named Defendant is "Tesla Motors, Inc."

**Reasoning:**

* The Court cites California law favoring arbitration and the requirements for compelling arbitration under Code of Civil Procedure ยง 1281 et seq.
*  The Court emphasizes that the party seeking to compel arbitration bears the burden of proving the existence of a valid agreement.
*  The Court notes that an arbitration agreement must be in writing and can be binding even if not explicitly read by all parties.
*  The Court acknowledges the "doctrine of equitable estoppel" which can allow non-signatories to enforce arbitration agreements in certain circumstances.

**Significant Statements:**

*  "California law reflects a strong public policy in favor of arbitration as a relatively quick and inexpensive method for resolving disputes."
*  "The party opposing arbitration has the burden of demonstrating that an arbitration clause cannot be interpreted to require arbitration of the dispute."
*  "An arbitration agreement must be memorialized in writing. A party's acceptance of an agreement to arbitrate may be express, as where a party signs the agreement. A signed agreement is not necessary, however, and a party's acceptance may be implied in fact or be effectuated by delegated consent."

**Next Steps:**

* Plaintiff is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
* Tesla Motors, Inc. can properly file a motion to compel arbitration if they intend to pursue that avenue.



**English Summary:**

The judge denied Tesla, Inc.'s motion to compel arbitration in this case without prejudice. The reason for the denial is that Tesla, Inc. was not named as a defendant in the lawsuit. While the judge acknowledged California's strong support for arbitration, they emphasized that the party seeking to enforce an arbitration agreement must prove its existence. 


The judge's ruling leaves the door open for Tesla Motors, Inc. to file a motion to compel arbitration if they believe they are properly named in the lawsuit and a valid arbitration agreement exists.
