And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Tesla, Inc.'s motion to compel arbitration without prejudice. The motion was made because the plaintiff, Skei McGrath Saulnier, has alleged that the subject 2020 Tesla Model X suffered from widespread defects and that Tesla Motors, Inc. (the defendant) is responsible for those defects. The judge found that there is no entity named "Tesla Inc." that has been named in the complaint or served with the complaint, and therefore, the judge cannot order arbitration at this time. The judge suggested that the defendant may need to properly name and identify itself in the complaint before a motion to compel arbitration can be made.
