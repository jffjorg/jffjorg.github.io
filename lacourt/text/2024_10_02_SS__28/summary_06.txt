And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the motion filed by 7-Eleven to compel the responses of Plaintiffs Laviyon Myers and Sheryl Myers to form interrogatories, set one, and for sanctions. The motion was set for hearing on October 2, 2024. 7-Eleven argues that the Plaintiffs did not serve timely responses, while the Plaintiffs argue that they served timely responses and that Sheryl Myers passed away on or about August 2024, which affected their ability to respond. The judge finds that the Plaintiffs served timely responses, specifically Laviyon Myers served verified responses on August 8, 2024. Therefore, the judge denies 7-Eleven's motion to compel as moot.
