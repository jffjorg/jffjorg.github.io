And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge regarding a hearing scheduled for October 2, 2024, in the case of Marie Benson (Plaintiff) v. Two Eleven Spalding Condominium Association (Defendant). The Plaintiff's counsel has filed a motion to be relieved as counsel, citing the Plaintiff's passing earlier this year and the family's decision not to pursue the action. The judge notes that the Plaintiff's counsel failed to list the "name of withdrawing attorney" on the Notice of Motion and Motion to be Relieved as Counsel form, and did not serve the motion, declaration, and proposed order on the Plaintiff's family members who might serve as successors-in-interest. As a result, the judge denies the motion without prejudice, ordering the counsel to give notice of the ruling and to file proof of service with the Court within five days.
