considered the documents submitted in support of the request for default
judgment, the Court rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On August
5, 2022, Plaintiff United Financial Casualty Company (“Plaintiff”) filed this
action against Defendants Adan A. Moreno (“Moreno”), Daniel Lopez Hernandez (“Hernandez”),
and Does 1-20 for motor vehicle tort and subrogation under Insurance Code section 11580.2, subdivision
(g).  The complaint demanded $137,200.02.  Plaintiff also filed a statement of damages
listing $8,296.02 in property damages and $128,904.00 in uninsured motorist bodily
injury payments, for a total amount of $137,200.02. 
On September
7, 2022, Plaintiff filed a proof of substituted service of the summons,
complaint, statement of damages, and other documents on Moreno on August 21,
2022. 
On
January 11, 2024, the clerk entered Moreno’s default. 
On
August 2, 2024, Plaintiff filed an application for default judgment against
Moreno. 
On
August 6, 2024, the Court dismissed Hernandez without prejudice at Plaintiff’s
request.  On August 9, 2024, the Court
dismissed the Doe defendants without prejudice at Plaintiff’s request. 
PLAINTIFF’S REQUEST 
Plaintiff
asks the Court to enter a default judgment against Moreno and to award Plaintiff
$137,719.02, consisting of $137,200.02 as the demand of the complaint and $519.00
in costs. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
A.      Default judgment 
          California Rules of Court, rule
3.1800(a), provides: 
“[With exceptions that do not apply here,] [a] party
seeking a default judgment on declarations must use mandatory Request for Entry
of Default (Application to Enter Default) (form CIV-100) . . . The following
must be included in the documents filed with the clerk: 
“(1)  Except in
unlawful detainer cases, a brief summary of the case identifying the parties
and the nature of plaintiff's claim; 
“(2) 
Declarations or other admissible evidence in support of the judgment
requested; 
“(3)  Interest
computations as necessary; 
“(4)  A
memorandum of costs and disbursements; 
“(5)  A
declaration of nonmilitary status for each defendant against whom judgment is
sought; 
“(6)  A proposed
form of judgment; 
“(7)  A dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not
sought or an application for separate judgment against specified parties under
Code of Civil Procedure section 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each
judgment; 
“(8)  Exhibits
as necessary; and 
“(9)  A request
for attorney fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.” 
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1800(a).) 
B.       Damages 
 The relief granted to a plaintiff upon entry
of a defendant's default cannot exceed the amount demanded in the complaint or,
for personal injury cases where damages may not be stated in the complaint, the
amount listed in the statement of damages. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 580, subd. (a),
585, subd. (b).) “The notice requirement of section 580 was designed to insure
fundamental fairness.” (Becker v. S.P.V. Construction Co. (1980) 27
Cal.3d 489, 494.) The statute insures that “defendants in cases which involve a
default judgment have adequate notice of the judgments that may be taken
against them. [Citation.] ‘If a judgment other than that which is demanded is
taken against him, [the defendant] has been deprived of his day in court—a
right to a hearing on the matter adjudicated.’ ’’ (Id. at p. 493.) A
trial court exceeds its jurisdiction if it awards damages in excess of the
amount specified in the complaint or statement of damages. (Id. at p.
494.) 
DISCUSSION 
          Plaintiff has submitted a complete default judgment
application with all required information. 
The Court grants the application. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court GRANTS Plaintiff United Financial Casualty Company’s request for default
judgment against Defendant Adan A. Moreno filed on August 2, 2024 and awards
Plaintiff $137,719.02. 
Plaintiff
is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
