And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied the Defendants' motion in limine, which sought to exclude evidence related to the existence of a duty to accept the cash payment. The Judge found that the motion was procedurally deficient because it did not specifically identify the evidence to be excluded and did not describe the specific prejudice the Defendants would suffer if the motion was not granted. Additionally, the Judge determined that the motion was an improper use of a motion in limine, as it was essentially a motion for summary adjudication. The Judge noted that the denial of the Plaintiff's motion for summary adjudication did not conclusively establish that the Defendants did not have a duty to accept the cash payment, and that the issue of duty was still open for consideration.
