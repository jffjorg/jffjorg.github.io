significant statements:
  - "The court is not required to hold an evidentiary hearing on a motion to amend a judgment, but may rule on the motion based solely on declarations and other written evidence."
  - "To prevail on the motion, the judgment creditor must show, by a preponderance of the evidence, that: 'the parties to be added as judgment debtors had control of the underlying litigation and were virtually represented in that proceeding; (2) there is such a unity of interest and ownership that the separate personalities of the entity and the owners no longer exist; and (3) an inequitable result will follow if the acts are treated as those of the entity alone.'"
```

Summary:

The judge granted Petitioner's motion to amend the judgment to include Albert Bernal as a judgment debtor. The court found that Albert Bernal is an alter ego of BCG and that BCG is an alter ego of Seller. The Arbitrator's findings in the arbitration award are final and binding, and collateral estoppel precludes relitigating the issue of whether Albert Bernal is an alter ego of BCG. The court granted the motion based on the Arbitrator's findings and the parties' pleadings.
