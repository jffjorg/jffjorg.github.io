  ORDER RE:
 
DEMURRER OF
  DEFENDANT TERESA KRAUSE TO FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT



 
Background
Plaintiff
Il Chul Ahn (“Plaintiff”) filed this action on Plaintiff June 11, 2024 against
Defendant Teresa Krause (“Defendant”). On July 1, 2024, filed the operative
First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) alleging causes of action for (1) breach of
oral contract, (2) breach of implied in fact contract, and (3) quasi contract. 
Defendant
now demurs to each of the causes of action of the FAC. Plaintiff opposes.  
Discussion 
A.    Legal Standard 
A demurrer can be used
only to challenge defects that appear on the face of the pleading under attack
or from matters outside the pleading that are judicially noticeable. (Blank
v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311,
318.) “To survive a demurrer, the
complaint need only allege facts sufficient to state a cause of action; each
evidentiary fact that might eventually form part of the plaintiff’s proof need
not be alleged.” (C.A. v. William S. Hart
Union High School Dist. (2012) 53
Cal.4th 861, 872.) For the purpose of testing the
sufficiency of the cause of action, the demurrer admits the truth of all material facts properly pleaded. (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital Dist. (1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 966-967.) A demurrer “does not admit contentions, deductions or conclusions
of fact or law.” (Daar v. Yellow Cab Co. (1967) 67 Cal.2d 695, 713.) 
A
pleading is uncertain if it is ambiguous or unintelligible. (¿Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (f)¿.) A demurrer
for uncertainty may lie if the failure to label the parties and claims renders
the complaint so confusing defendant cannot tell what he or she is supposed to
respond to.¿ (Williams v. Beechnut Nutrition
Corp. (1986) 185 Cal.App.3d 135,
139, fn. 2¿.) However, “¿[a] demurrer for
uncertainty is strictly construed, even where a complaint is in some respects
uncertain, because ambiguities can be clarified under modern discovery
procedures.¿” (¿Khoury v. Maly’s of California, Inc.
(1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616¿.)¿¿
B.    Allegations of the
FAC 
In the FAC, Plaintiff alleges that he is a Real Estate Broker. (FAC, ¶
1.) Plaintiff alleges that “[o]n or about 10/25/2023, defendant prospective
buyer Teresa Krause (BUYER) orally promised to pay the compensation and/or
commissions to IL CHUL AHN (AHN), if he helped her (BUYER) to purchase
commercial-use building.” (FAC, ¶ 6.) 
Plaintiff alleges that for “[m]ore than FOUR (4) months, AHN and his
associate continuously and consistently had been working with even ‘undue
hardship’ [sic] to the following commercial-use properties located at: 1) 12444
Victory Blvd., North Hollywood, CA 91606; 2) 3171 Los Feliz, Los Angeles, CA
90039; 3) 4055 Wilshire Blvd, Los Angeles, CA 90010; and 4) S. Grand Ave.,
Glendale, CA 90014.” (FAC, ¶ 9.) Plaintiff alleges that “in the property of
12444 Victory Blvd., North Hollywood, CA 91606, BUYER provided AHN and his
associates with her handwritten memo, promising to desperately and immediately
pay $200,000.00 commissions and/or compensation, if AHN helped to purchase the
building in amount between 7.75 and 8 million UD Sollars [sic].” (FAC, ¶ 10.) Plaintiff
further alleges that “on 02/01/2024 (2:00 PM) in BUYER’s office at 3440
Wilshire Blvd., Los Angeles, CA 90010, BUYER orally and personally re-confirmed
to AHN and his associate that she would and must keep going desperately and
willing to purchase the commercial-use property through AHN.” (FAC, ¶ 13.) Plaintiff
alleges that “BUYER confirmed and promised that she would pay commissions at
least $300,000.00 regardless of closing amount.” (FAC, ¶ 14.) 
Plaintiff alleges that “[f]inally, BUYER has determined to purchase a
building located at ‘710 S. Central Ave., Glendale, CA 90014’ AHN and his
associate found for BUYER and strongly recommended for BUYER to purchase
it…Thereafter, it is reasonably informed and believes [sic] that escrow…was
opened through another realtor…The BUYER silenced and ignored [sic] to pay
anything, though.” (FAC, ¶¶ 16-17.) 
C.    Statute of Frauds 
In the demurrer, Defendant first asserts that “all three causes of
action in the FAC are invalid, as per the statute of frauds, and are subject to
demurrer.” (Demurrer at p. 5:27-28.) 
Defendant notes that “[w]henever it
appears upon the face of the…complaint…that the agreement sued upon is within
the statute of frauds, and fails to comply with the requirements thereof, the
appropriate mode of taking advantage of the defect is by demurrer.” 
(Harper
v. Goldschmidt (1909) 156 Cal.
245, 252-253.) Defendant cites to Civil Code
section  1624, subdivision (a)(4), which provides that “[t]he following contracts are invalid, unless they, or some
note or memorandum thereof, are in writing and subscribed by the party to be
charged or by the party’s agent:…(4) An agreement authorizing or employing an
agent, broker, or any other person to purchase or sell real estate, or to lease
real estate for a longer period than one year, or to procure, introduce, or
find a purchaser or seller of real estate or a lessee or lessor of real estate
where the lease is for a longer period than one year, for compensation or a
commission.” 
            Defendant asserts that “[i]n this case,
Plaintiff is alleging that Defendant made an oral promise to pay him
compensation if he helped her buy a commercial building…All three causes of
action in Plaintiff’s FAC are based on this alleged oral promise. Assuming
arguendo that the Court were to determine that there was such an oral agreement
between the parties (which there wasn’t), that oral agreements would be
invalid, as per the California Statute of Frauds, because there is no writing
memorializing that alleged agreement. Therefore, none of the causes of action
in Plaintiff’s FAC state sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action for
which relief could be sought.”  (Demurrer
at p. 6:8-14.) 
            As set
forth above, Plaintiff alleges that “[o]n or about 10/25/2023, defendant
prospective buyer Teresa Krause (BUYER) orally promised to pay the
compensation and/or commissions to IL CHUL AHN (AHN), if he helped her (BUYER)
to purchase commercial-use building.” (FAC, ¶ 6, emphasis added.) Plaintiff
alleges that he is a “Real Estate Broker.” (FAC, ¶ 1.) Although it is not
entirely clear, the basis for Plaintiff’s FAC appears to be that Plaintiff
found a property located at 710 S. Central Ave., Glendale, CA 90014 which he
recommended that Defendant purchase, but Defendant ultimately opened escrow
through another realtor and didn’t pay Plaintiff anything in connection with
the Glendale property. (FAC, ¶¶ 16-17.) Plaintiff may be alleging that
Defendant breached the parties’ purported oral agreement in doing so.[1]
Plaintiff alleges that “BUYER has finally determined to purchase the premise
[sic] located at 710 S. Central Ave., Glendale, CA 91204-46509…However, under
the circumstances, BUYER did not perform her contractual duty where she
deliberately changed to other [sic] sales agent…AHN was acting pursuant to
either an express (oral) or implied request for such services from the
defendant BUYER and that the services rendered were intended to and did benefit
the defendant BUYER.” (FAC, ¶¶ 53-55.)
            As discussed, “the following contracts are invalid, unless they, or some
note or memorandum thereof, are in writing and subscribed by the party to be
charged or by the party’s agent:…(4) An agreement authorizing or employing an
agent, broker, or any other person to purchase or sell real estate, or to lease
real estate for a longer period than one year, or to procure, introduce, or
find a purchaser or seller of real estate or a lessee or lessor of real estate
where the lease is for a longer period than one year, for compensation or a
commission.” (Civ. Code, § 1624, subd. (a)(4).) However, here, Plaintiff
alleges that “[o]n or about 10/25/2023, defendant
prospective buyer Teresa Krause (BUYER) orally promised to pay the
compensation and/or commissions to IL CHUL AHN (AHN), if he helped
her (BUYER) to purchase commercial-use building.” (FAC, ¶ 6, emphasis
added.) As noted by Defendant, each of Plaintiff’s causes of action appear to
be premised on this alleged oral promise. (See, e.g., FAC, ¶¶ 22, 37,
50, 55.) 
In
the opposition, Plaintiff does not appear to address or dispute Defendant’s point
that the foregoing alleged oral promise is invalid under Civil
Code section 1624, subdivision
(a)(4).
            In light of the foregoing, the Court
sustains Defendant’s demurrer to each of the causes of action of the FAC.  
Conclusion
Based on the foregoing, the Court sustains Defendant’s
demurrer to each of the causes of action of the FAC. 
The Court orders
Plaintiff to file and serve an amended complaint, if any, within 20 days of the
date of this order. If no amended complaint is filed within 20 days, the Court
orders Defendant to file and serve a
proposed judgment of dismissal within 30 days of the date of this order.
Defendant is
ordered to give notice of this order.
