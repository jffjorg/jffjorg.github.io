And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge Teresa A. Beaudet in a case between Il Chul Ahn (plaintiff) and Teresa Krause (defendant). The case arises from an alleged oral promise made by Krause to pay Ahn compensation if he helped her buy a commercial building. Ahn alleges that Krause failed to pay him the promised compensation and instead opened escrow through another realtor. Krause demurred to each of Ahn's causes of action, arguing that the alleged oral agreement is invalid under the California Statute of Frauds. The judge agrees with Krause and sustains her demurrer, ordering Ahn to file an amended complaint within 20 days. If no amended complaint is filed, the court will order Krause to file a proposed judgment of dismissal within 30 days.
