  ORDER RE:
 
DEFENDANT CITY
  OF LOS ANGELES’ DEMURRER TO PLAINTIFF JONATHAN THOMAS ELIE’S COMPLAINT



 
On May 16, 2024, Plaintiff Jonathan Thomas Elie (“Plaintiff”) filed
this action against Defendants City of Los Angeles, Barbara Romero, and Mark
Fernandez. 
On May 29, 2024, Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint (“FAC”). The
City of Los Angeles (the “City”) demurred to each of the causes of action of
the FAC. Plaintiff opposed. 
On October 11, 2024, the Court issued an Order continuing the hearing
on the City’s demurrer from October 11, 2024 to December 9, 2024. The Court
noted that “it does not appear
that the City filed any declaration in connection with the demurrer
demonstrating that the parties ever met and conferred in person, by telephone,
or by video conference, or that the City’s counsel attempted to do so.” (October 11, 2024
Order at p. 2:3-6.) The Court ordered the City to meet and confer with
Plaintiff. (See October 11, 2024 Order at p. 2:21-25.) 
Thereafter, the parties
submitted a “Joint Stipulation of Parties Regarding Filing of Plaintiff
Jonathan Thomas Elie’s Second Amended Complaint.” On October 23, 2024, the
Court issued an Order providing, inter alia, that “[h]aving
considered the foregoing Stipulation of the Parities, the Court hereby grants
plaintiff Jonathan Thomas Elie leave to file his Second Amended Complaint
within 14-days of the date of this Order.” On November 5, 2024, Plaintiff filed
a Second Amended Complaint. 
In light of the foregoing, the City’s demurrer to the FAC is moot. The Court notes
that “[a]n amendatory pleading supersedes the original one, which ceases to perform
any function as a pleading. The amended complaint furnishes the sole basis for
the cause of action, and the original complaint ceases to have any effect
either as a pleading or as a basis for judgment…Because there is but one
complaint in a civil action…the filing of an amended complaint moots a motion
directed to a prior complaint…Thus, the filing of an amended complaint renders
moot a demurrer to the original complaint.” (JKC3H8
v. Colton (2013) 221 Cal.App.4th
468, 477 [internal quotations and citations omitted].)
The
City is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
