[TENTATIVE] ORDER
  RE:
 
PLAINTIFF’S REQUEST FOR DEFAULT JUDGMENT  




            
Plaintiff
Nargis Rashid (“Plaintiff”) appears to request entry of default judgment
against Defendants Burgerim Group USA, Inc. and Oren Loni. Plaintiff’s proposed
judgment indicates that Plaintiff seeks judgment in the total amount of $26,614,817.45,
comprising $17,765,250.00 in damages, $8,756,078.01 in interest, $90,356.30 in
attorney’s fees, and $3,133.14 in costs. 
The
Court notes a number of defects with the submitted default judgment package.
First, Plaintiff did not
file any request for court judgment (Form CIV-100). Pursuant to California Rules of Court, rule 3.1800,
subdivision (a), “[a] party seeking a default
judgment on declarations must use mandatory Request for Entry of Default (Application to Enter Default) (form
CIV-100)…” 
Second, as discussed,
Plaintiff did not file any request for court judgment on Form CIV-100. Thus,
Plaintiff also did not file any declaration of nonmilitary status. Pursuant to California Rules of Court, rule 3.1800,
subdivision (a)(5), the request for court judgment must include “[a]
declaration of nonmilitary status for each defendant against whom judgment is
sought.”
Third, it does not appear
that all of the documents in Plaintiff’s default judgment package were served.
The Court notes that pursuant to Code
of Civil Procedure section 587, “[a]n application by a plaintiff for entry
of default under subdivision (a), (b), or (c) of¿Section
585¿or¿Section 586¿shall include an affidavit
stating that a copy of the application has been mailed to the defendant’s
attorney of record or, if none, to the defendant at his or her last known
address and the date on which the copy was mailed. If no such address of the defendant
is known to the plaintiff or plaintiff’s attorney, the affidavit shall state
that fact. No default under subdivision (a), (b), or (c) of¿Section 585¿or¿Section 586¿shall
be entered, unless the affidavit is filed. The nonreceipt of the notice shall
not invalidate or constitute ground for setting aside any judgment.”
Fourth, Plaintiff filed a
memorandum of points and authorities with the default judgment package that
references a “Declaration
of Nargis Rashid.” However, it does not appear that any such declaration was
filed. The Court does not find that Plaintiff has sufficiently
proven up the substantial amount of damages requested. Plaintiff filed a
number of declarations with the default judgment package, but these
declarations are from attorneys, paralegals, and employees at Plaintiff’s
counsel’s law firm. It appears that these declarations primarily
support Plaintiff’s request for attorney’s fees. 
Fifth, Plaintiff’s
Memorandum of Costs indicates that Plaintiff seeks $553.00 in “Other” costs for
“Trial Supplies” and “Document Download.” (See Attachment 16a.) Such
costs do not appear to be allowable under Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5, and Plaintiff
does not appear to provide any authority demonstrating that such costs are
recoverable.  
Sixth, Plaintiff’s SAC
also names Saffron Mediterranean Kitchen, Burgerim Group, Inc. Food Chain
Investments USA, LLC, and Does 3 through 20 as defendants. On July 12, 2024,
Plaintiff filed a request for dismissal of Burgerim Group, Inc., Food Chain
Investments, LLC, and “Doe Defendants.” Dismissal was entered as requested on
July 15, 2024. However, it does not appear that any request for dismissal or application for separate judgment was filed as to
Saffron Mediterranean Kitchen. The Court notes that a
party seeking a default judgment must file “[a] dismissal of all parties
against whom judgment is not sought or an application for separate judgment
against specified parties under ¿Code of Civil
Procedure section 579¿, supported by a showing of grounds for each
judgment…”¿ (¿Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1800, subd.
(a)(7)¿.)¿
Seventh, Plaintiff’s
memorandum of points and authorities asserts that “Defendants conduct was
beyond malicious when Mr. Loni continuously engaged in sexual harassment. The
despicable conduct that Plaintiff was subjected to eventually led to her
constructive termination. As a result, Plaintiff requests, at minimum,
$17,500,000.00 in punitive damages.” (Memorandum of Points and Authorities at
p. 13:21-23.) The Court notes that pursuant to Code of
Civil Procedure section 425.115, subdivision (b), “[t]he plaintiff preserves the right to
seek punitive damages pursuant to Section 3294 of the
Civil Code on a default judgment by serving upon the defendant the
following statement, or its substantial equivalent…” (See Id., § 425.115,
subd. (b).) Pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 425.115, subdivision (f), “[t]he plaintiff shall serve the
statement upon the defendant pursuant to this section before a default may be
taken, if the motion for default judgment includes a request for punitive
damages.” It does not
appear that Plaintiff filed or served any such statement. 
In
addition, Plaintiff has not provided any meaningful evidence
of Defendants’ financial condition to support an award for punitive damages. (Adams v. Murakami (1991) 54 Cal.3d 105, 114 (evidence of defendant’s financial condition
required to support punitive damages)¿¿; ¿¿Lara v. Cadag
(1993) 13 Cal.App.4th 1061, 1064-1065 [meaningful evidence required and
evidence of earnings is not by itself sufficient]¿¿.)¿
Based
on the foregoing, the Court denies Plaintiff’s apparent request for default
judgment without prejudice. The Court will discuss with Plaintiff a schedule
for resubmission of the default judgment package.
