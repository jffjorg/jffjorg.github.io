And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's apparent request for default judgment without prejudice. The plaintiff had requested judgment in the amount of $26,614,817.45, but the judge noted several defects with the submitted default judgment package. These defects included the lack of a request for court judgment (Form CIV-100), failure to file a declaration of nonmilitary status, and failure to serve the documents in the default judgment package. Additionally, the judge noted that the plaintiff had not provided sufficient evidence to support the requested amount of damages and had not filed a statement required for punitive damages. The judge ordered the plaintiff to resubmit the default judgment package and set a schedule for discussion.
