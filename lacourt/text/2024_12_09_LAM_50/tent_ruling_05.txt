The parties provided the Court with a copy of the Stipulated Facts in connection with the April 7,
2023 Final Status Conference; however, the docket in this case does not reflect
that the Stipulated Facts were ever filed. The Court will provide a copy of the
Stipulated Facts to the Judicial Assistant for filing so the record is
complete.

Regarding Exhibit 11, Asherian
testified that he did overhear Omrani place the order because Raymond was on
speakerphone. He also testified that Omrani signed Exhibit 11 when the masks
were delivered, but this was not credible because it was inconsistent with his
earlier testimony that the masks were delivered by another company.

No packing slips were admitted to support Exhibits 7, 8 and 11. This contrasted
with Exhibits 12 and 13. Exhibit 13 reflected the large shipment of masks to
Mason Brand that was delivered by two of Asherian’s own employees. Exhibit 13
is the packing slip that Omrani signed for the masks described in Exhibit 12.
Omrani did not testify as to whether he signed the packing slip for the masks
that he described as being “dumped” at his warehouse; he did dispute that he
ever ordered the160,596 masks in the first place and he contends that they were
defective and as a result, nonconforming.
