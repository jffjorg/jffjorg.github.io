And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The City of Los Angeles demurred to each cause of action in Plaintiff Jonathan Thomas Elie's First Amended Complaint. However, since the City did not file a declaration demonstrating that they met and conferred with the Plaintiff, the Court ordered them to do so. The parties subsequently submitted a joint stipulation, and the Court granted the Plaintiff leave to file a Second Amended Complaint. The Plaintiff has since filed the Second Amended Complaint, which renders the City's demurrer to the First Amended Complaint moot. Therefore, the Court grants the City's demurrer, but only to the extent that it is now moot. The City is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
