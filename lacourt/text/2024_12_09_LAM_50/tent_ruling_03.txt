[TENTATIVE] ORDER
  RE:  
 
MOTION FOR ASSIGNMENT ORDER RE: RIGHTS TO PAYMENT OF MONEY DUE OR TO
  BECOME DUE [PROCEEDS GENERATED BY CSLB LICENSE NO. 380415]



 
Background
On May 11, 2020, Plaintiff Wesco Insurance
Company (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Defendant Native Creations Inc.
and dba Creative Innovations (“Defendant”). The Complaint alleges six causes of
action for breach of contract. 
On May 5, 2023, a “Judgment After Hearing on Motion for Judgment in
Accordance with Written Settlement Agreement” was entered in this action. The
Judgment provides, inter alia, as follows: 
 
“IT IS HEREBY
ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED that Plaintiff Wesco Insurance Company have judgment
against Defendant Native Creations Inc. and dba Creative Innovations in the
principal sum of $12,657.00, together with prejudgment interest of $3.46 per
day from December 8, 2017 using the legal rate of 10% per annum; plus the
principal sum of $17,733.00, together with prejudgment interest of $4.85 per
day from October 30, 2017 using the legal rate of 10% per annum; plus the
principal sum of $16,215.00, together with prejudgment interest of $4.44 per
day from October 23, 2017 using the legal rate of 10% per annum; plus the
principal sum of $13,824.00, together with prejudgment interest of $3.78 per
day from November 1, 2018 using the legal rate of 10% per annum; plus the
principal sum of $3,168.00, together with prejudgment interest of $0.86 per day
from September 9, 2019 using the legal rate of 10% per annum; plus the
principal sum of $1,710.00, together with prejudgment interest of $0.46 per day
from August 16, 2019 using the legal rate of 10% per annum, plus costs of suit
of $535.00, and $1,500.00 in attorney’s fees incurred in seeking judgment, for
a total judgment of $76,140.59.” 
Plaintiff moves for an order
assigning to Plaintiff the interest, if any, of Defendant in its rights to payment
of money due or to become due from its activities as a contractor or generated
through the use of California Contractors State License Board License No.
380415, to the extent necessary to satisfy the judgment entered in this action. The motion is unopposed. 
On October 17, 2024, the Court issued an Order continuing the hearing
on the instant motion to November 8, 2024. The Court’s October 17, 2024 Order
noted that “a further explanation appears to be necessary regarding Plaintiff’s
calculation of $82,271.81 as the total sum due.” (October 17, 2024 Order at p.
5:2-3.) The Court noted that “Plaintiff is to file and serve a declaration
addressing the foregoing request for additional information by 11/1, 2024, with
a courtesy copy delivered to Dept. 50.” (Id. at p. 5:7-9.)  
On November 8, 2024, the Court issued a
minute order providing, inter alia, that “[p]ursuant to the
request of plaintiff, the Hearing on Motion for Order Assignment Order Re:
Rights to Payment of Money Due or to Become Due [Proceeds Generated by CSLB
License No. 380415] scheduled for 11/08/2024 is continued to 12/09/24 at 10:00
AM in Department 50 at Stanley Mosk Courthouse. Plaintiff can separately file
and serve the declaration ordered previously by the Court.” On November 8,
2024, Plaintiff filed a “First Supplemental Declaration of Timothy Carl Aires
in Support of Motion for Assignment Order Re: Rights to Payment of Money Due or
to Become Due [Proceeds Generated by CSLB License No. 380415].” 
Request for Judicial Notice 
The Court grants Plaintiff’s request for
judicial notice. 
Discussion 
Plaintiff states that it seeks an order “assigning
to Plaintiff/Judgment Creditor Wesco Insurance Company the interest, if any, of
Defendant/Judgment Debtor Native Creations Inc. and dba Creative Innovations in
their rights to payment of money due or to become due, whether styled accounts
receivable, general intangibles, payment intangibles, accounts, deposit
accounts, royalties, fees, commissions, and other rights to money, from its
activities as a contractor or generated through the use of California Contractors
State License Board License No. 380415, to the extent necessary to satisfy the
judgment entered in this action in full which, as of October 17, 2024, is
$82,271.81…” (Mot. at pp. 1:27-2:5.) 
Plaintiff cites to Code
of Civil Procedure section 708.510, subdivision (a), which
provides that “[e]xcept as otherwise provided
by law, upon application of the judgment creditor on noticed motion, the court
may order the judgment debtor to assign to the judgment creditor or to a
receiver appointed pursuant to Article 7 (commencing with Section
708.610) all or part of a right to payment due or to become due, whether or
not the right is conditioned on future developments, including but not limited
to the following types of payments: (1) Wages due from the federal government that are not subject
to withholding under an earnings withholding order. (2) Rents. (3) Commissions. (4) Royalties. (5) Payments due from a patent or copyright. (6) Insurance policy loan value.” Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 708.510, subdivision (d), “[a] right to payment may be assigned pursuant to this
article only to the extent necessary to satisfy the money judgment.” 
In addition, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 708.510, subdivision (c), “[s]ubject to subdivisions (d),
(e), and (f), in determining whether to order an assignment or the amount of an
assignment pursuant to subdivision (a), the court may take into consideration
all relevant factors, including the following: (1) The reasonable requirements of a
judgment debtor who is a natural person and of persons supported in whole or in
part by the judgment debtor. (2) Payments the judgment debtor is required
to make or that are deducted in satisfaction of other judgments and wage
assignments, including earnings assignment orders for support. (3) The
amount remaining due on the money judgment. (4) The amount being or
to be received in satisfaction of the right to payment that may be assigned.”
Pursuant to Code of
Civil Procedure section 708.510, subdivision (b)(1), “[t]he notice of the motion shall be served on the judgment
debtor. Service shall be made personally or by mail.” Here, the proof of
service attached to Plaintiff’s instant motion states that the moving papers
were served on Defendant by mail on September 16, 2024. In addition, the proof
of service attached to Plaintiff’s counsel’s first supplemental declaration
indicates that the declaration was served by mail and electronic service on
November 8, 2024.  
As discussed, Plaintiff moved for an order
assigning to Plaintiff the interest, if any, of Defendant
in its rights to payment of money due or to become
due “from its activities as a contractor or generated through the use of California
Contractors State License Board License No. 380415, to the extent necessary to
satisfy the judgment entered in this action in full which, as of October 17,
2024, is $82,271.81…” (Mot. at p. 2:3-5.) As set forth above, the May 5, 2023
Judgment in this action provides for a “total judgment of $76,140.59.” (May 5,
2023 Judgment at p. 2:16.) 
In his original declaration in support of the
motion, Plaintiff’s counsel stated that “[o]n July 11, 2023, a bank levy
recovered $4,958.09 [credit against principal: $3,144.14; credit against
interest: $1,813.95]. The daily rate at 10% per annum on $72,996.45 is $19.99
per day. 464 days have passed from July 11, 2023 through October 17, 2024.
Post-judgment interest, as of October 17, 2024, is $9,275.36. The total sum now
due and owing under the Judgment, as of October 17, 2024, is $82,271.81.”
(Aires Decl., ¶ 3.) 
In the October 17, 2024 Order on the instant
motion, the Court noted that $76,140.59 (the total amount of the May 5, 2023
Judgment) minus $4,958.09 (the amount credited) equals $71,182.50. The Court
noted that Plaintiff’s calculations of post-judgment interest were based on an
amount $72,996.45. (Aires Decl., ¶ 3.) In addition, the Court noted that it was
unclear if Plaintiff also added interest to the $71,182.50 figure for the
period of May 5, 2023 to July 11, 2023, as calculations were not provided as to
any such interest. The Court noted that “[i]t appears that a further
explanation from Plaintiff is necessary on this point.” (October 17, 2024 Order
at p. 4:7-8.) 
In his November 8, 2024 supplemental declaration,
Plaintiff’s counsel asserts that total amount necessary to satisfy the
judgment, as of December 9, 2024 is $82,872.11. (First Suppl. Aires Decl., ¶
6.) Plaintiff’s counsel’s supplemental declaration provides, inter alia,
calculations explaining the interest sought from May 5, 2023 through July 11,
2023. 
Plaintiff’s counsel’s calculations in the supplemental declaration
appear to be correct, except for the interest sought on the $72,579.45 amount.
(See First Suppl. Aires Decl., ¶ 6.) Plaintiff seeks interest on this
amount for the period of July 11, 2023 through December 9, 2024. (Ibid.) Although Plaintiff’s counsel states that
there are 487 days between July 11, 2023 and December 9, 2024, there appears to
be 517 days between these dates. (Ibid.) Interest
on $72,579.45 at $19.87 per day for 517 days totals $10,272.79. However,
Plaintiff seeks $10,292.66 in interest on the $72,579.45 amount. (First Suppl.
Aires Decl., ¶ 6.)
Based on Plaintiff’s calculations and the correction identified above,
the Court finds that the total amount necessary to satisfy the judgment as of
December 9, 2024 is $82,852.24 ($76,140.59 + $1,396.95 - $4,958.09 +
$10,272.79.) (See First Suppl. Aires Decl., ¶ 6.)
In his supporting declaration, Plaintiff’s
counsel also states that “Defendant/Judgment Debtor Native Creations Inc. and
dba Creative Innovations is using CSLB License No. 380415, as evidenced by the
abstract of the records of the CSLB pertaining to CSLB License No. 380415, a
true and correct copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit ‘B’.” (Aires
Decl., ¶ 5, Ex. B.) Plaintiff’s counsel states that “[b]ased on my
investigation, rights to payment of money due or to become due, whether styled
accounts receivable, general intangibles, payment intangibles, accounts,
deposit accounts, royalties, fees, commissions, and other rights to money, from
its activities as a contractor or generated through the use of CSLB License No.
380415, exist in favor of Defendant/Judgment Debtor Native Creations Inc. and
dba Creative Innovations.” (Aires Decl., ¶ 6.) 
As set forth above, Code of Civil Procedure
section 708.510, subdivision (a) provides in part that “upon application of
the judgment creditor on noticed motion, the court may order the judgment
debtor to assign to the judgment creditor…all or part of a right to payment due
or to become due, whether or not the right is conditioned on future
developments…” (Emphasis added.) “All or part of a right to
payment due, or to become due, may be ordered assigned whether or
not such right is conditioned upon future developments. [CCP §
708.510(a)].” (Ahart, Cal. Practice Guide: Enforcing
Judgments and Debts (The Rutter Group 2023) ¶ 6:1423 [emphasis in original].) 
Here,
the Court finds that Plaintiff has provided adequate evidence of purported
payments due or to become due to Defendant. 
Conclusion 
Based on the foregoing, the Court grants Plaintiff’s motion
for an order assigning to Plaintiff the interest, if any, of Defendant
in its rights to payment of money due or to become due from its activities as a
contractor or generated through the use of California Contractors State License
Board License No. 380415, to the extent necessary to satisfy the judgment
entered in this action. Based on the foregoing, the
Court finds that total amount necessary to satisfy the Judgment entered
in this action, as of December 9, 2024, is $82,852.24. 
Plaintiff is ordered to provide
notice of this ruling.
