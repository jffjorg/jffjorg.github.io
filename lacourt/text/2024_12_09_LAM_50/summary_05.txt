And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling is based on the information presented in the Stipulated Facts and testimony from the parties. The judge notes that the Stipulated Facts were not filed with the court and will be provided to the Judicial Assistant for filing. The judge also reviews the testimony of Asherian and Omrani, noting inconsistencies in Omrani's testimony. The judge expresses skepticism about the evidence supporting Exhibits 7, 8, and 11, which were not accompanied by packing slips. In contrast, Exhibit 13, a packing slip signed by Omrani, was admitted as evidence. The judge's ruling suggests that Omrani's claims about receiving and ordering masks are disputed and that further evidence is needed to support the claims.
