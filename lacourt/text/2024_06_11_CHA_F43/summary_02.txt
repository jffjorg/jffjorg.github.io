And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied the Defendant's motion to set aside/vacate the judgment. The Defendant argued that the County's Zoning and Building Codes are preempted by the California Integrated Waste Management Act (CIWMA) and the California Building Standards Code (CBSC), and that the judgment is void due to lack of subject matter jurisdiction. However, the Judge found that there are no conflicts between the Zoning Code and CIWMA, and that the Defendant has not demonstrated any preemption. The Judge also found that the judgment is not void on its face, and that the abstract of judgment was properly filed with the Court. The Judge granted Plaintiffs' request for judicial notice and took judicial notice of prior documents filed in the case.
