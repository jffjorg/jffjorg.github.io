Summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge Theresa M. Traber on a motion to quash a subpoena for business records propounded to non-party Orkin – United Agent Group, Inc. The motion was filed by Defendants Essex Warner Center, L.P. and Essex Management Corporation in a habitability defect action brought by 21 Plaintiffs alleging extensive deficiencies in the apartment building owned and operated by the Defendants. The Plaintiffs served a subpoena on Orkin – United Agent Group, Inc. seeking documents related to Orkin Services of California, Inc.'s services at the subject property. The Defendants objected to the subpoena, arguing that it is vague and ambiguous, not reasonably particularized, overbroad, and seeks irrelevant information. The Court denied the motion to quash the subpoena, finding that the Defendants failed to demonstrate the validity of their objections. The Court held that the subpoena is proper and that the Defendants must comply with it.
