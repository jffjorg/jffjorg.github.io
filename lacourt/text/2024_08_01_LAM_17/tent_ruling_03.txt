The Govind
Parties’ motion to quash is CONTINUED.
 
On 7/3/2018,
Plaintiffs Govind Vaghashia (Govind) as an individual and on behalf of Graphic
Research, Inc. dba Gtek/Bycan Systems filed a second amended complaint (SAC)
against Prashant Vaghashia (Prashant), Graphic Research, Inc. dba Gtek/Bycan
Systems (GRI), alleging: (1) involuntary dissolution; (2) breach of fiduciary
duty; (3) accounting; and (4) violation of Corporations Code sections 1601 and
1602. 
 
            On
5/28/2024, the Govind Parties filed a motion to quash deposition subpoena on
non-party Wells Fargo Bank for production of business records.
 
            On
7/19/2024, the Los Angeles Court System’s network was the victim of a
cyberattack which disrupted eCourt’s filing and document system. At this time,
eCourt is unable to retrieve the motion filed by the Govind Parties, and a
hardcopy courtesy copy was not filed with the Court. Moreover, given the
disruption to the filing system, it is unclear whether an opposition or reply were
ever filed.
 
            The
motion is continued to allow the motion to be refiled. Opposition and reply due
according to Code. 
 
            Based
on the foregoing, the Govind Parties’ motion to quash is continued. 
 
It is so ordered.
