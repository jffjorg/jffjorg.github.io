And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Govind Vaghashia vs. Prashant Vaghashia, et al. (Case No. BC696133). The ruling states that the Govind Parties' motion to quash a deposition subpoena on non-party Wells Fargo Bank for production of business records is continued. The motion was filed on May 28, 2024, but due to a cyberattack on the Los Angeles Court System's network on July 19, 2024, the court was unable to retrieve the motion and a hardcopy courtesy copy was not filed with the court. The court has ordered the Govind Parties to refile the motion and opposition and reply are due according to Code. The court will adopt this tentative as the final order if all parties submit and there are no appearances at the hearing.
