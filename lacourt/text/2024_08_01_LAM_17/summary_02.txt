And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment, dismissing the plaintiff's claims for whistleblower retaliation, civil rights violations, and defamation. The judge found that the plaintiff failed to establish a claim for whistleblower retaliation because she did not engage in protected activity and there was no causal connection between her alleged protected activity and the retaliatory conduct. The judge also found that the plaintiff's claims for civil rights violations and defamation were without merit because the statements made by the defendant were not defamatory and were protected by a conditional privilege.
