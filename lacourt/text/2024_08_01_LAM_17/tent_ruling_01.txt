 Hearing Date:  August 1, 2024




 
Specially-appearing
Defendant Cosentino Group, S.A. n/k/a Cosentino, S.A.’s motion to quash service
of summons for lack of personal jurisdiction is GRANTED.  
 
On February
2, 2024, Plaintiffs Jose Guadalupe-Soto Rodriguez and Sara
Sanchez (collectively, Plaintiffs)
filed the operative first amended complaint against
39 Defendants, alleging: (1)
negligence; (2) strict liability—warning defect; (3)
strict liability—design defect; (4)
fraudulent concealment; (5) breach of implied
warranties; and (6) loss of consortium.
 
            On
4/26/2024, the Court continued Cosentino’s motion to quash based on lack of
jurisdiction to allow jurisdictional discovery to take place. 
 
            Now,
with discovery having taken place, the Court takes up the motion.  
 
Legal Standard
 
Cal Code of
Civil Procedure § 418.10(a)(1) states:
 
(a) A
defendant, on or before the last day of his or her time to plead or
within any
further time that the court may for good cause allow, may serve
and file a
notice of motion for one or more of the following purposes:
 
(1) To
quash service of summons on the ground of lack of jurisdiction of the court
over him or her.
(2)
To stay or dismiss the action on the ground of inconvenient forum.
(3) To
dismiss the action pursuant to the applicable provisions of Chapter 1.5 (commencing
with Section 583.110) of Title 8.”
 
A California
court can exercise personal jurisdiction over a nonresident
defendant who has “minimum contacts”
with the state. (Pavlovich v. Superior Court
(2002) 29 Cal.4th 262, 268; Virtualmagic
Asia, Inc. v. Fil-Cartoons, Inc. (2002) 99
Cal.App.4th 228, 238.) A defendant has
minimum contacts if the quality and nature
of its activity in the forum state
(referred to as “contacts”) is such that it is
reasonable and fair to require the
defendant to conduct a defense in that state.
(Paviovich, supra, 29 Cal.App.4th
at 268; Strasner v. Touchstone Wireless Repair & Logistics, LP (2016)
5 Cal.App.5th 215, 221.)
 
Discussion 
 
            Defendant
Cosentino argues that it lacks the requisite contacts with California to
establish personal jurisdiction over it.
 
            After
review, the Court agrees. 
 
The focus of
the minimum contacts analysis is the defendant's contacts
with the forum. (Bristol-Myers
Squibb Co. v. Superior Court (2017) 582 U.S. 255,
260.) Depending on the extent of a
defendant's contacts with California, it may be
subject to either general or specific
jurisdiction. (Elkman v. National States Ins.
(2009) 14 Cal.4th 434, 445-446.)
 
A court can
exercise specific jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant if (1)
the defendant has purposefully availed
itself of the forum's benefits and protections
and (2) the cause of action relates to
or arises out of the defendant's contacts with
the forum, and (3) the exercise of personal
jurisdiction would comport with fair play
and substantial justice. (Pavlovich,
supra, 29 Cal.4th at 269.) The contacts for
specific jurisdiction are those that
existed when the plaintiff's cause of action arose.
(Strasner, supra, 5
Cal.App.5th at 226.)
 
To establish
minimum contacts for specific jurisdiction, the plaintiff must
show that the defendant has
purposefully availed itself of the privilege of
conducting activities in California to
involve its benefits and protections. (See
Axiom Foods, Inc. v. Acerchem Int'l
(9th Cir. 2017} 874 F.3d 1064, 1068; Bristol-
Myers Squibb Co. v. Superior Court
(2016) 1 Cal.5th 783, 799-800.) In this
analysis, (1) only the defendant's
contacts with California are considered, not the
defendant's contacts with persons who
reside there, (2) the defendant's contacts
must have been purposeful rather than
random, fortuitous, or attenuated, and (3)
the defendant must have sought some
benefit by availing itself of the jurisdiction.
(See Walden v. Fiore (2014) 571
U.S. 277, 285-286; Burger King Corp. v.
Rudzewicz (1985) 471 U.S. 462, 474-475;
Vons v. Seabest Foods (1996), 14 Cal.4th 434, 446.)
 
            As
part of jurisdictional discovery, Plaintiff submitted evidence that:
 
Jorge Cuervo
Vela, the Global Director of the Legal Department at Cosentino Group, testified
in his deposition on May 6, 2024 that Cosentino SA is the registered trademark
owner for Silestone, and he authenticated the trademark registrations. He
further testified that Cosentino SA licensed the use of the trademark to
C&C North America, creating a market for the product in the US, especially
in California (see Declaration of Raphael Metzger.
 
            (Supp.
2: 6-7.) 
 
            Plaintiff
argues that the Cosentino trademarks are: 
 
…critical
evidence because they show that Cosentino S.A. owns the trademark for Silestone
and registered it with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, whereby the
product was distributed in the United States and even appears on a building in
Los Angeles which Cosentino calls a “Cosentino City.” Pursuant to
well-established California law, Cosentino Group is therefore in the chain of
distribution of the Cosentino products and, through its ownership, use and
licensing of the trademarks, caused the epidemic including plaintiff’s
silicosis. Cosentino is therefore liable to Plaintiffs on their products
liability claims for causing the silicosis, Kasel v. Remington Arms Company
(1972) 24 Cal.App.3d 711, 721-728, whether or not is the manufacturer or the distributor
of the products or claims to be a mere “holding company.
 
            (Supp.
2, 14-22.) 
 
            However,
in opposition, Cosentino Group explained that Cosentino Group, S.A. changed its
name to Cosentino, S.A. on July 23, 2023. References to “Cosentino, S.A.” in records,
filings, reports, and other documents prior to July 23, 2023 are not references
to specially-appearing defendant Cosentino Group, S.A. n/k/a Cosentino, S.A.;
such references are references to an entirely different and separate legal
entity that is now known as Cosentino Industrial, S.A.U.
 
            Cosentino
Group submitted evidence that Jorge Cuervo Vela repeatedly explained at his
deposition that Cosentino Group is not the registrant or owner of the
Silestone trademark. For example, Mr. Guervo testified:
 
[W]hat I can
tell you with all certainty is that that Cosentino, SA, that the record shows
is not the Cosentino, SA, that we are here to discuss today.
 
As I said
earlier, back in -- on that date of that registration date, Cosentino, SA, name
was Grupo Cosentino, SL. …
 
And you can
ask me however many times you like and I can continue to answer here for hours
or days, but doesn’t matter how many times you ask me the question, that
society that is shown on that document next to where it says in English “Owner”
that Cosentino, SA, is not the Cosentino, SA that we’re here to discuss today.
That is not the Cosentino, SA that I am here representing in this deposition.
 
…
 
When we
discussed the registration of this Silestone trademark earlier, I have been 100
percent clear, and I have gone out of my way to clarify that the Cosentino, SA,
that that registry or that document showed it is not the same Cosentino, SA,
that I’m here representing today
 
            (Metzger
Decl, Exh. A, Cuervo Dep. at 60:12–61:9, 79:5–10.) 
 
Mr. Cuervo
also made clear Cosentino Group, S.A. n/k/a Cosentino, S.A. did not license the
trademark to defendant C & C North America, Inc.:
 
Q.
What is licensing contract that you worked on for C & C North America?
 
A. I don’t
remember the details. What I can tell you 100 percent, is that it did not
involve Cosentino, SA. …
 
…
 
Q. Sir, I was
asking you in order for this trade name to be on this building, the trade name
had to be licensed to C & C North America, true? [Objections omitted.]
 
THE WITNESS:
I cannot speculate. I don’t know. I don’t know the details of the agreement
between Cosentino Global and Cosentino North America. And respectfully I would
invite you to ask these questions to their representative for Cosentino North
America.
 
            (Cuervo
Dep. at 44:18–22, 82:5–15.)
 
            Moreover,
even assuming Cosentino Group did own the trademark, Plaintiffs do not cite any
authority for the proposition that registering or owning a trademark
constitutes a purposeful contact with any one state for purposes of
establishing personal jurisdiction. While Plaintiffs cite Kasel, supra,
24 Cal.App.3d 711, this case deals with choice of law and enterprise liability
in a situation where the defendant “made a general appearance in the case and
raised no objection to the ‘forum’ jurisdiction of the court” (Id. at p.
721). As such, it is factually distinguishable and does not support the
exercise of jurisdiction here.
 
A nonresident
defendant’s contacts with the forum state “must be the defendant’s own choice
and not ‘random, isolated, or fortuitous.’” (Ford Motor Co. v. Montana
Eighth Judicial Dist. Court (2021) 141 S.Ct. 1017, 1024–1025, quoting Keeton
v. Hustler Magazine, Inc. (1984) 465 U.S. 770, 774.) “They must show that
the defendant deliberately ‘reached out beyond’ its home—by, for example,
‘exploi[ting] a market’ in the forum State or entering a contractual
relationship centered there.” (Ford Motor, at p. 1025, original brackets,
quoting Walden v. Fiore (2014) 571 U.S. 277, 285.) 
 
Here,
Plaintiff’s evidence fails to show that Cosentino Group is the registrant or
owner or the Silestone trademark, and even if it was, Plaintiff has not set
forth persuasive California authority which could show that this would
constitute meaningful contact for purposes of personal jurisdiction under California
law. 
 
Based on the
foregoing, specially-appearing Defendant Cosentino Group, S.A. n/k/a Cosentino,
S.A.’s motion to quash service of summons for lack of personal jurisdiction is
granted.  
 
 
It is so ordered.
