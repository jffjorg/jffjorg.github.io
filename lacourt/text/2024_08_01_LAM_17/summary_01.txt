Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court grants the motion to quash service of summons filed by specially-appearing defendant Cosentino Group, S.A. n/k/a Cosentino, S.A. due to lack of personal jurisdiction. The court finds that Cosentino Group, S.A. does not have the requisite contacts with California to establish personal jurisdiction. The court cites various California and federal cases to support its decision, including Pavlovich v. Superior Court (2002) 29 Cal.4th 262, Elkman v. National States Ins. (2009) 14 Cal.4th 434, and Ford Motor Co. v. Montana Eighth Judicial Dist. Court (2021) 141 S.Ct. 1017. The court also notes that the plaintiff's evidence fails to show that Cosentino Group, S.A. is the registrant or owner of the Silestone trademark, and even if it was, there is no persuasive California authority to support the exercise of personal jurisdiction.
