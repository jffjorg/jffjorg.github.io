I.      
MOTIONS
TO COMPEL FURTHER
“Any party may obtain discovery . . . by propounding to any other party to
the action written interrogatories to be answered under oath.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.010(a).) If a
propounding party is not satisfied with the response served by a responding
party, the former may move the court to compel further interrogatory
responses.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300;
Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v.
Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 403.)  The propounding party must demonstrate that
the responses were incomplete, inadequate or evasive, or that the responding
party asserted objections that are either without merit or too general.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300(a)(1)–(3); Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc., supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at 403.)
“A propounding party may demand a responding
party to produce documents that are in their possession, custody or control.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.010.) A party may likewise conduct discovery by
propounding interrogatories to another party to be answered under oath. (Code
Civ. Proc. § 2030.010, subd. (a).) The responding party must respond to the
production demand either by complying, by representing that the party lacks the
ability to comply, or by objecting to the demand. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.210.) The responding party must respond to the interrogatories by
answering or objecting. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.210, subd. (a).) If the
responding party fails to serve timely responses, the propounding party may
move for an order compelling responses to the production demand and
interrogatories. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, 2031.300.)
 
Plaintiff Chelsea Flowers (Plaintiff) seeks
further responses from Defendants LA Organic Pharmacy Inc. and Mecca Mid City
(Defendants) to Special Interrogatories, Set One, Nos. 10, 11, 14–18, and
20–24, and Requests for Production, Set One, Nos. 24–26, 28, 49, 61–71, 73, and
75–77. These discovery requests and others were the subject of previous motions
to compel further, which this court granted on August 30, 2023.
 
Interrogatories No. 10 and 11 sought the
identities of Defendants’ persons most qualified for certain subjects, to which
they responded by referring to an individual identified as “Payroll at
Paychex,” apparently a third party payroll vender. (Separate Statement at pp.
2–9.) Interrogatories No. 16–18, 20, and 21 sought information concerning the
total number of current and former aggrieved employees during the covered
period, total aggrieved employees per pay period during that time, and their
dates of employment. Defendant responded that it did “not have sufficient
knowledge and information to respond to this interrogatory” and stated that
they called for a legal conclusion. (Separate Statement at pp. 21–41.)[1]
Despite being unable to identify numbers or dates of employment for aggrieved
employees, Defendant responded to Interrogatories No. 22 and 23 (which sought
the current rates of pay and highest rates of pay for all current and former
aggrieved employees) by offering $17 and $19 per hour, respectively. (Separate
Statement at pp. 42–50.) And asked in Interrogatory No. 24 to identify the job
titles of aggrieved employees, Defendant responded “Budtender.” (51–54.)
 
Further responses are required. The term
“aggrieved employees” was defined in the interrogatories to refer to “all
current and former hourly employees employed by Defendant within the State of
California” during the “covered period,” this latter term encompassing January
28, 2021, to the present. (Motion Exh. A.) Defendant contends that it provided
records identifying 47 employees with the responsive information. (Opposition
at p. 5.) But at Plaintiff notes in the motion, these documents provide no
contact information responsive to Interrogatories No. 14 or 15. (Motion Exh.
J.) Moreover, Defendants do not explain why, if the documents provide the
requested information, their responses to the interrogatories at issue provide different
information, or in some cases state outright that Defendants have no
information at all. Although Defendant contends that identifying this
information for 47 employees is “burdensome task,” they present no evidence to
show that this is the case. ““[T]he party opposing discovery has an
obligation to supply the basis for this determination,” and to provide evidence
“showing the quantum of work required.” (Williams v. Superior Court
(2017) 3 Cal.5th 531, 549.) There is no basis to find that providing complete
responses poses a burden.
 
A
further response is also required as to those interrogatories seeking
Defendant’s person most knowledgeable, to which Defendants responded by
identifying a representative of a third-party vender. Although Defendants argue
that a person most knowledgeable under Code of Civil Procedure § 2025.230 may
be an “agent,” and that a “third-party vendor that is a professional company
engaged to oversee Defendants’ payroll is a sufficient ‘agent’” under this
meaning, this argument is unpersuasive. (Opposition at p. 6.) Definitionally, a
witness that an entity deponent “produce[s]” under Code of Civil Procedure §
2025.230 must be someone whom the entity is capable of producing, i.e. capable
of directing their appearance as part of the employment or agency relationship.
Defendants do not contend that they can direct the third-party vender’s
appearance at deposition without resort to procedures for third-party
discovery. 
 
The
motion is therefore GRANTED as to the special interrogatories.
 
The
parties’ dispute over the requests for production is as follows. Requests No.
61–68  and 75–77 sought documents related
to employee payments and schedules, to which Defendants responded with
objections and cursory directions to “[s]ee documents bates labeled” with
certain page ranges. (Separate Statement at pp.22–59, 76–89.) Requests No.
24–26, 28, and 49 sought documents related to Defendant’s internal assessments,
audits, meetings related to Defendants’ compliance with California labor laws,
as well as copies of relevant insurance policies. (Separate Statement at pp.
2–21.) Defendant responded with statements of inability to comply, stating in
one iteration of the responses that it is “of the belief that these documents
never existed, or have otherwise been destroyed, lost or misplaced,” and in the
final iteration of responses that “these documents have never been or are no
longer in the possession, custody, or control of the responding party.” (Ibid.)
Defendants provided the same responses to Requests No. 69–71, which sought
documents related to termination of aggrieved employees, payment of final
wages, and employee payments for business items. (Separate Statement at pp.
61–71.) Request No. 73 sought all documents related to any investigation
concerning Plaintiff’s claims, to which Defendant responded only with
objections. (Separate Statement at pp. 71–75.)
 
Defendants’
responses are insufficient. Defendants do not provide statements of compliance
in keeping with Code of Civil Procedure § 2031.220, indicating whether and to
what extent they are complying with the request, instead offering terse
directions to the propounding party to “see” cited page numbers.[2] 
 
Nor do Defendants comply with Code of Civil Procedure § 2031.230,
addressing statements of inability to comply. That statute requires the
responding party to state “whether the inability to
comply is because the particular item or category has never existed, has been
destroyed, has been lost, misplaced, or stolen, or has never been, or is no
longer, in the possession, custody, or control of the responding party.” (Code
Civ. Proc. § 2031.230.) Defendants do not state “whether” any of those
conditions apply, but essentially restate the statutory terms without stating
which of them accurately describes the disposition of the documents, or whether
they may be found with “any natural person or organization known or
believed by that party to have possession, custody, or control of that item or
category of item.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.230.) Even if Defendants’
investigation is unable to turn up the precise disposition of the documents
requested, this does not obviate the necessity of a response: “If only partial
answers can be supplied, the answers should reveal all information then
available to the party. If a person cannot furnish details, he should set forth
the efforts made to secure the information.” (Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978)
84 Cal.App.3d 771, 782.)
 
It is unclear from these responses whether Defendants
withhold any documents pursuant to objections — save the objections offered
against Request No. 73, which sought documents related to its investigation of
claims, to which it offered objections only. (Separate Statement at pp. 72–75.)
To the extent that Defendants withhold any documents pursuant to objections
they must:
 
(1)
Identify with particularity any document, tangible thing, land, or
electronically stored information falling within any category of item in the
demand to which an objection is being made.
 
(2)
Set forth clearly the extent of, and the specific ground for, the objection. If
an objection is based on a claim of privilege, the particular privilege invoked
shall be stated. If an objection is based on a claim that the information
sought is protected work product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section
2018.010), that claim shall be expressly asserted. 
 
(Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.240, subd. (b)(1), (2).) Defendants
must accordingly identify and justify the withholding of responsive documents
pursuant to the above statute.
 
All motions to compel further are therefore GRANTED in their
entirety.
 
II.    SANCTIONS
Statute provides that the court shall impose sanctions upon
a party who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel further response
to interrogatories, requests for production of documents, or requests for
admission, absent substantial justification otherwise. (Code Civ. Proc. §§
2030.300, subd. (d); 2031.310, subd. (h); 2033.290, subd. (d).)
 
Plaintiff seeks $3,396.60 in
sanctions against Defendants and their counsel, representing six hours of work
on the motions in total, plus $246.60 in filing fees. (Nguyen Decl. ¶¶ 15–17.)
Sanctions are awarded against
Defendants and their counsel in the amount of $3,396.60 plus fees of $246.60.
