And here is the English text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants the Plaintiff's motion to compel Defendant's responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One. The Defendant failed to serve timely responses, and the Plaintiff is ordered to provide responses without objections within 30 days. The judge also awards sanctions against the Defendant and its counsel in the amount of $937.50, comprising 2.5 hours of work at $375.00 per hour, to be paid within 30 days. This is because the Defendant failed to serve timely responses, waiving any objections to the request. The judge cites California Code of Civil Procedure sections 2030.290 and 2031.300, as well as Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants, in support of this ruling.
