Here is the English summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted Defendant VCI's Motion to Strike Punitive Damages with leave to amend. The judge found that the plaintiffs failed to plead sufficient facts showing malice, fraud, or oppression to warrant the imposition of punitive damages. The judge also found that the plaintiffs' allegations were too conclusory and did not meet the legal standard for punitive damages. The judge reminded the parties of the need to comply with the requirements of the Code of Civil Procedure, including the meet and confer requirement, which was not met in this case.
