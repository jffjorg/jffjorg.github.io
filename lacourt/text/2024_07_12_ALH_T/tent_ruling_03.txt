 Case Number:  22STCV10473    Hearing Date:   July 12, 2024    Dept:  T Motion: Motion to Compel Initial Responses to Form Interrogatories, Set  One and Request for SanctionsMoving Party: Plaintiff Gregory Wilson Responding Party: NoneTentative Ruling: GrantBACKGROUND This action arises from a motor vehicle accident that occurred on June 22, 2021. On March 25, 2022, Plaintiffs Gregory Wilson and Olena Tymoshenko (collectively “Plaintiffs”) filed a complaint against Darreasha Dukes (“Defendant”) and DOES 1 through 20, inclusive, alleging a cause of action for negligence.  On June 17, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant motion.  As of July 10, 2024, no oppositions have been filed. MOVING PARTY POSITION  Plaintiff requests an order from the Court compelling Defendant Darreasha Dukes, to provide responses, without objections, to Plaintiff’s first set of Form Interrogatories for receipt by Plaintiff’s counsel within seven (7) days of the date of the Court’s Order. Plaintiff also requests an order from the Court awarding monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,825.00 against Defendant and its counsel.  No opposition was filed.  ANALYSIS Where a party fails to serve timely responses to discovery requests, the court may make an order compelling responses.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, 2031.300; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 403.)¿ A party that fails to serve timely responses waives any objections to the request, including ones based on privilege or the protection of attorney work product.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (a), 2031.300, subd. (a).)¿ Unlike a motion to compel further responses, a motion to compel responses is not subject to a 45-day time limit and the propounding party has no meet and confer obligations.¿ (Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc., supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at p. 404.) Here, on March 20, 2024, Plaintiff propounded Form Interrogatories, Set One to Defendant via email. (Yadegari Decl. at ¶ 2; Ex. 1.) Responses were due by April 24, 2024. (Id. at ¶ 3.) To date, Defendant has not provided discovery responses. Therefore, Plaintiff’s motions to compel Defendant’s responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One is GRANTED.¿ Plaintiff is ordered to provide responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One without objections within 30 days of this order.  Where the court grants a motion to compel responses, sanctions shall be imposed against the party who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel, unless the party acted with substantial¿justification,¿or the sanction would otherwise be unjust.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (c), 2031.300, subd. (c).)¿¿Under California Rules of Court, rule 3.1348, subdivision (a), “[t]he court may award sanctions under the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery, even though no opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to the motion was withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party after the motion was filed.”  Here, Plaintiff requests sanctions in the amount of $1,875.00 based on 5 hours incurred at Defendant’s counsel’s hourly rate of $375.00.¿ Defendant’s requests for sanctions are GRANTED in a reduced amount because the motion is straightforward, and unopposed.¿ Sanctions are imposed against Defendant and Defendant’s counsel of record, jointly and severally, in the total amount of $937.50, comprised of 2.5 hours of work at $375.00 per hour to be paid within 30 days of the date of this order. RULING Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s motions to compel Defendant’s responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One is GRANTED.¿ Plaintiff is ordered to provide responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One without objections within 20 days of this order. Sanctions are imposed against Defendant and Defendant’s counsel of record, jointly and severally, in the total amount of $937.50, comprising 2.5 hours of work at $375.00 per hour to be paid within 30 days of the date of this order.
