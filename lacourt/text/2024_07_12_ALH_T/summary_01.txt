And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding several motions in limine filed by both parties. The judge denied the defendant's motion to exclude references to the "golden rule" and other potential jurors' biases, as the court cannot rule on anticipated conduct by the plaintiff's counsel unless and until that conduct occurs.

The judge granted the defendant's motion to limit the introduction of police reports, including the traffic collision report, except for certain portions that may be used to refresh recollections. The judge also granted the defendant's motion to exclude body cam footage containing hearsay statements or inadmissible opinions relating to fault, except for portions that may contain statements that are not hearsay or are subject to hearsay exceptions.

The judge denied the plaintiff's motion to exclude the defendant's experts from testifying, as the defendants have a right to present their side of the case. The judge also denied the plaintiff's motion to limit the introduction of medical billing amounts, as the court cannot restrict the introduction of evidence without a showing of prejudice.

The judge granted the defendant's motion to cross-examine physicians who treat on a lien basis regarding their negotiation of liens and acceptance of less than the amount billed at the conclusion of the case. The judge also allowed the defendant to attack the credibility of physicians who have a direct interest in the success of the case.
