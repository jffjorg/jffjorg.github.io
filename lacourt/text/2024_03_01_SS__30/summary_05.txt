And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling denying Defendant Maria Desio's motions to compel responses to form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and requests for production, as well as a request for sanctions. The motions are denied without prejudice, and the moving party is ordered to give notice. The Court's decision is based on procedural grounds, specifically the failure of the Plaintiff to serve responses to the discovery requests within the original due date and the lack of evidence of consent for electronic service. The Court notes that there is no notice of consent on record and that the email address used for service is different from the email address provided on the complaint. As a result, the Court finds that the discovery and motions have not been properly served.
