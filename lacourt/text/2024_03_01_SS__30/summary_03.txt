```

Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the plaintiff's motion to deem admissions admitted as moot because the defendant has since provided verified responses to the requests for admissions. The judge also denies the plaintiff's request for sanctions because the notice of motion failed to identify the person or party against whom the sanction is sought, as required by law. The judge notes that the defendant's failure to serve a timely response to the requests for admissions was not justified and that the court has broad discretion to overlook late-served papers and resolve the matter on the merits.
