And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the defendant's motion for an order compelling the Superior Court Judge to execute subpoenas as to Veterans Affairs. The defendant has attempted to obtain the specific authorization used by the VA from the plaintiff, but was unsuccessful. The VA will accept a judge-signed subpoena to obtain records. The defendant cites to Code of Civil Procedure section 1985(c), but this section appears to apply to sealed subpoenas, which is not the case here. The Judge notes that the trial court does not have the power to create additional methods of discovery, and that the court may only compel a non-party's compliance with a proper deposition subpoena for records. The motion is denied, and the defendant may bring a motion to compel compliance after personally serving the deposition subpoena on the VA Hospital and personally serving any motion on the VA Hospital.
