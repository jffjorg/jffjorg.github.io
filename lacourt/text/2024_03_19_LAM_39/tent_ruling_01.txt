  Case Number:  20STCV30224    Hearing Date:   March 19, 2024    Dept:  39 The Labor
Commissioner v. 5121 Ascot Avenue, LLC
Case Number
20STCV30224
[Proposed] Amended
Statement of Decision
 
            The Labor
Commissioner of the State of California (the “Labor Commissioner” or
“Plaintiff”) filed this action against 5121 Ascot Ave LLC (“Ascot” or
“Defendant”), among others, seeking to foreclose on mechanic’s liens.  Plaintiff alleges that Ascot’s contractor,
P&A Remodeling Consulting, Inc. (“P&A”), failed to pay regular and
overtime wages, and failed to provide meal periods and rest breaks, to several workers.  Plaintiff obtained a default against P&A
and proceeded to trial against Defendant. 
The Court conducted the trial against Defendant and the default prove-up
hearing against P&A on December 14, 2023, and February 7, 2024.  The trial lasted less than eight hours, and
neither party requested a statement of decision “before the matter [was]
submitted for decision,” as required by California Rules of Court, rule
3.1590.  Nevertheless, the Court issued a
written order to make the basis of its verdict clear, which the Court elected
to treat as a proposed statement of decision. 
(See Court’s Minute Order, dated February 22, 2024.)  The Court has considered the Labor
Commissioner’s objections and now issues this proposed amended statement of
decision. 
 
            Previously,
the Court ruled that the Labor Commissioner may recover overtime wages, as well
as payments for missed meal periods and rest breaks, through mechanic’s liens.  (See Court’s Minute Order, dated June 13,
2022.)  The Court ruled that the action
is timely, and the reasonable value of the liens is based upon “the reasonable
value of the work, which in this case would be the reasonable wages for the
unpaid work.”  (See Court’s Minute Order,
dated March 13, 2023.)  The Court
incorporates those orders by reference.  
 
            The Court
finds that Robert Morales, Wuilmar Bautista, and Carlos Ajcot (the “workers”) worked
for P&A and performed work on Defendant’s property.  The Court finds that the workers were paid as
follows, and that these rates are the reasonable value for the liens:
 
            Robert
Morales           $200 per day/$1,200 per
week           $30 per hour 
            Wuilmar
Bautista        $250 per day/$1,500 per
week           $37.50 per hour 
            Carlos
Ajcot                $190 per day/$1,140
per week           $28.50 per hour 
 
The Court finds that the workers worked from 8 a.m. to 4
p.m. every day and received one hour of breaks, which they took from 12 Noon to
1 p.m.  The Court finds that the workers
worked seven hours per day and six days per week, meaning that they worked 42
hours per week.  
 
The Court finds that the workers
began working on Wednesday, January 8, 2020, based upon the testimony of Brian
Rabbani, which was corroborated by Trial Exhibit #31.  The Court finds that the workers were paid on
Saturdays, but they did not receive a paycheck on Saturday, February 1, 2020,
which was their last day of work.  The
Court discredits the workers’ testimony that they worked for longer periods on
Defendant’s property.  
 
            The Court
finds that the three workers were not paid for nine (9) days of work based upon
their testimony, which the Court credits on this issue.  The Court also relies on the testimony of
Brian Rabbani, who testified that the workers complained to him about not
receiving wages shortly after the missed payments.  Therefore, the workers are entitled to the
following amounts for unpaid wages:
 
            Robert
Morales                       $1,800
            Wuilmar
Bautista                    $2,250
            Carlos
Ajcot                            $1,710
 
The Court also finds that the workers did not receive
premium pay for two hours of overtime on the following days: (1) Saturday,
January 18, 2020; (2) Saturday, January 25, 2020; and (3) Saturday, February 1,
2020.  The Court finds that the workers
did not work any overtime beyond these hours on these days and discredits their
testimony to the contrary.  Therefore,
the workers are entitled to the following additional amounts:
 
            Robert
Morales                       $270
            Wuilmar
Bautista                    $337.50
            Carlos
Ajcot                            $256.50
 
            The Court
finds that Plaintiff did not prove the workers were deprived of rest breaks.  Plaintiff’s evidence was insufficient, and
the Court discredits the workers’ testimony on this issue.  However, the Court finds that Plaintiff
proved that one worker—Wuilmar Bautista—did not receive meal breaks on two days
per week, which is a total of eight days, which means he is entitled to an
additional $300.  To the extent Bautista
testified that he missed more meal periods, the Court discredits his testimony
on that issue.
 
            The Labor
Commissioner is entitled to prejudgment interest from the date of the recording
of the amended liens (May 11, 2020) to the date of the verdict (February 9,
2024).  This is 1,369 days.  Therefore, the prejudgment interest is as
follows:
 
            Robert
Morales                       $543.38
            Wuilmar
Bautista                    $757.97
            Carlos
Ajcot                            $516.21
 
The Court finds in favor of
Defendant, and against the Labor Commissioner, on the remaining liens because
the Labor Commissioner presented insufficient evidence to support the claims,
e.g., the Labor Commissioner did not call the workers at issue as witnesses at
trial.  The Court finds that the Labor
Commissioner did not willfully inflate the value of any of the liens.  The Court has considered and rejected the
parties’ remaining arguments that are inconsistent with this verdict.  
 
            Based upon
the foregoing, the Court orders as follows:
 
            1.         The Court finds in favor of Plaintiff,
and against Defendant, in the total amount of $8,741.56.
 
2.         The
Court finds that Plaintiff has proved damages against P&A Remodeling
Consulting, Inc. in the amount of $8,741.56. 

 
            3.         The Court orders no attorneys’ fees
because the Labor Commissioner withdrew the request for attorneys’ fees in the operative
complaint.  
 
            4.         The Court orders that each party shall
bear their own costs.  The Court finds
that neither party is the prevailing party because neither party achieved a
complete victory on all claims/defenses. 
In the alternative, to the extent the Labor Commissioner would be
considered the prevailing party, the Court denies costs under Code of Civil
Procedure section 1033.  Although
Defendant made an offer of $7,000 under Code of Civil Procedure section 998,
dated December 2, 2022, based upon the prejudgment interest between May 11,
2020, and December 22, 2022, the Labor Commissioner achieved a better outcome
at trial.    
 
            5.         The Court issues this [proposed]
amended tentative statement of decision. 
Any objections shall be filed within 15 days, per California Rules of
Court, rule 3.1590(g).  If no objections
are received, this proposed amended tentative statement of decision shall
become final without a further hearing.  
 
            6.         The Court sets a non-appearance case
review for April 12, 2024, at 1:30 p.m.
 
            7.         The Court’s clerk shall provide
notice.
