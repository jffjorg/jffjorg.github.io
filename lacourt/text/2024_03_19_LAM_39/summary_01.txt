And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Labor Commissioner has brought an action against 5121 Ascot Avenue, LLC (Defendant) to foreclose on mechanic's liens. The action is based on the Defendant's contractor, P&A Remodeling Consulting, Inc.'s (P&A), failure to pay regular and overtime wages, and failure to provide meal periods and rest breaks, to several workers. The Court has conducted a trial against the Defendant and the default prove-up hearing against P&A.

The Court finds that the workers, Robert Morales, Wuilmar Bautista, and Carlos Ajcot, worked for P&A and performed work on the Defendant's property. The Court finds that the workers were paid as follows: Robert Morales $200 per day/$1,200 per week $30 per hour, Wuilmar Bautista $250 per day/$1,500 per week $37.50 per hour, Carlos Ajcot $190 per day/$1,140 per week $28.50 per hour.

The Court finds that the workers were entitled to the following amounts for unpaid wages: Robert Morales $1,800, Wuilmar Bautista $2,250, Carlos Ajcot $1,710. The Court also finds that the workers did not receive premium pay for two hours of overtime on several days and are entitled to the following additional amounts: Robert Morales $270, Wuilmar Bautista $337.50, Carlos Ajcot $256.50.

The Court finds that the workers did not receive rest breaks, but finds that one worker, Wuilmar Bautista, did not receive meal breaks on two days per week, which is a total of eight days, and is entitled to an additional $300.

The Court orders that the Labor Commissioner is entitled to prejudgment interest from the date of the recording of the amended liens (May 11, 2020) to the date of the verdict (February 9, 2024).

The Court finds in favor of the Labor Commissioner and against the Defendant on the remaining liens because the Labor Commissioner presented insufficient evidence to support the claims. The Court orders that the Labor Commissioner is entitled to damages in the amount of $8,741.56. The Court also orders that each party shall bear their own costs.
