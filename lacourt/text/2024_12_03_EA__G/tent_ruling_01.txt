  Case Number:  24PSCV02427    Hearing Date:   December 3, 2024    Dept:  G Plaintiff Orlando Garcia’s Application for Default
Judgment
Respondent: NO OPPOSITION
TENTATIVE RULING
Plaintiff Orlando Garcia’s Application for Default
Judgment is GRANTED in the reduced amount of $5,817.49.
BACKGROUND
This
is a disability rights action. Plaintiff Orlando Garcia is physically disabled
and relies on mobility devices such as wheelchairs to ambulate. Defendant Blue
Wave Partners LLC (Blue Wave), allegedly owns a property in La Puente upon
which Defendant Laundroline LLC (Laundroline) operates a laundromat. In September
2023, Garcia visited the laundromat for the purpose of utilizing its services
and conducting disability access testing. Garcia alleges the following barriers
to access existed, including noncompliant door hardware, work surfaces that
were too high, coin and soap dispensers that were too high, and a sink that was
too high.
On
July 23, 2024, Garcia filed a complaint against Blue Wave, Laundroline, and
Does 1-50, alleging (1) violation of the Unruh Civil Rights Act (UCRA) and (2)
violation of the California Disabled Persons Act (DPA). On August 6, 2024,
Garica’s process server personally served Laundroline in Glendale and served
Blue Wave with substitute service in Chino Hills.
On
September 24, 2024, the court entered default against Blue Wave and Laundroline
after they failed to file a timely answer.
On November
27, 2024, Garica filed the present application for default judgment. A case
management conference is set for December 3, 2024.
LEGAL STANDARD
Code
of Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a
party has filed to timely respond or appear.  A party seeking judgment on
the default by the court must file a Request for Court Judgment, and: (1) a
brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other admissible evidence in
support of the judgment requested; (3) interest computations as necessary; (4)
a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) a proposed form of judgment; (6) a
dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application
for separate judgment under CCP § 579, supported by a showing of grounds for
each judgment; (7) exhibits as necessary; and (8) a request for attorneys’ fees
if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.  (Cal. Rules of
Court 3.1800.)
ANALYSIS
Garcia
seeks default judgment against Blue Wave and Laundroline in the total amount of
$8,012.49, including $4,000.00 in damages, $2,325.00 in attorney fees, and $1,687.49
in costs. Because the court finds Garcia has submitted sufficient evidence, the
court GRANTS Garcia’s application for default judgment with the
following modifications.
First,
while Garcia requests the court award $2,325.00 in attorney fees, the court
finds this amount excessive and unreasonable considering the default nature of
the present action. Instead, the court awards reasonable attorney fees pursuant
to Local Rule 3.214 in the amount of $330.
Second,
Garcia requests $1,687.49 in costs for $462.27 in clerk filing fees, $1,025.22
in process server fees, and $200 in unspecified costs. Because $200 in
requested costs are unspecified, the court declines to award this amount and
reduces the awarded costs to $1,487.49.
Accordingly,
the total judgment award is reduced to $5,817.49.
CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, Garcia’s
application for default judgment is GRANTED in the reduced amount of $5,817.49.
