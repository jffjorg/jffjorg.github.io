Furst
 
TENTATIVE
RULING
            Defendants
Linda Mayne and Stephen Mayne’s Motion for Leave to file a compulsory cross-complaint
against Plaintiff only is GRANTED pursuant to CCP § 426.50. Defendants acted in
good faith, the claims to be asserted arise out of the same transaction or
occurrence as the initial Complaint, and Plaintiff will not be prejudiced.  
 
            Defendant’s
request for leave to add Beth Goodman Furst as a cross-defendant is DENIED.  Defendants have failed to show it is in the
interest of justice to Beth Goodman or any new parties as cross-defendants
under CCP§ 425.50. At minimum, adding new parties could unreasonably burden and
complicate this lawsuit, lead to more delay, and potentially interfere with the
current trial date 
 
            Defendants
are ordered to file and serve the Cross-Complaint separately within 10 days.
