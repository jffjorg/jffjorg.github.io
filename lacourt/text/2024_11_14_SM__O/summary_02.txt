And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge regarding a motion for a protective order filed by plaintiff Grace Kang in a civil lawsuit against defendant Jason Varughese. The motion seeks to limit the scope of discovery and prevent the misuse of the discovery process by the defendant. The judge grants the motion and orders the defendant to exclude certain topics from the discovery process, including plaintiff's alleged sexual history, taxes, driver's license number, residential property, and law firm information. The judge also orders the defendant to pay sanctions in the amount of $4,020.00 for engaging in abusive discovery practices. The ruling is based on the court's discretion and the California Code of Civil Procedure and Evidence Code. The judge finds that the defendant's discovery requests were not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence and were intended to harass and embarrass the plaintiff.
