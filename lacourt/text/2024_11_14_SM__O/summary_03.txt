And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled on the motion for leave to file a cross-complaint. The defendants, Linda Mayne and Stephen S. Mayne, are granted permission to file a compulsory cross-complaint against the plaintiff, Robert G. Furst, as the claims arise from the same transaction or occurrence as the initial complaint and the plaintiff will not be prejudiced. However, the request to add Beth Goodman Furst as a cross-defendant is denied, as the defendants have failed to show that it is in the interest of justice to do so. The defendants are ordered to file and serve the cross-complaint separately within 10 days.
