TENTATIVE
RULING
            Defendant J&W Westgate, LLC’s Motion to Strike
Punitive Damages from Plaintiff Todd Naeem’s First Amended Complaint (titled
Second Amended Complaint) is GRANTED. Plaintiff’s FAC does not include any
allegations of malice, fraud or oppression against Defendant to support an
award of punitive damages. (See Civ. Code, § 3294.)
 
            The Prayer for Punitive Damages contained in Page 3,
Paragraph 14 of Plaintiff’s First Amended Complaint is stricken.
  
REASONING
A
plaintiff may recover punitive damages in an action for the breach of an
obligation not arising out of contract where the defendant has been guilty of
oppression, fraud, or malice. (Cal. Civ. Code §3294 (a).) 
 
“(a)
In an action for breach of an obligation not arising from contract, where it is
proven by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant had been guilty of
oppression, fraud, or malice, the plaintiff, in addition to the actual damages,
may recover damages for the sake of example and by way of punishing the
defendant.” (Civ. Code, § 3294, subd. (a.)
 
“Malice
is ‘conduct which is intended by the defendant to cause injury to the plaintiff
or despicable conduct which is carried on by the defendant with a willful and
conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.’ (Civ. Code, §
3294, subd. (c)(1).) Oppression is ‘despicable conduct that subjects a person
to cruel and unjust hardship in conscious disregard of that person's rights.’
(Civ. Code, § 3294, subd. (c)(2).) Despicable conduct is conduct that is so
vile, base, contemptible, miserable, wretched or loathsome that it would be
looked down upon and despised by ordinary decent people. Such conduct has been
described as having the character of outrage frequently associated with crime.”
(Scott v. Phoenix Schools, Inc. (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 702, 715.)
 
“In
addition to the requirement that the operative complaint set forth the elements
as stated in section 3294, it must include specific factual allegations showing
that defendant's conduct was oppressive, fraudulent, or malicious to support a
claim for punitive damages. [citation]. Punitive damages may not be pleaded
generally.” Today's IV, Inc. v. Los Angeles County Metropolitan
Transportation Authority (2022) 83 Cal.App.5th 1137, 1193 [300 Cal.Rptr.3d
61, 105], reh'g denied (Oct. 25, 2022), review denied (Jan. 18,
2023), citing Brousseau v. Jarrett (1977) 73 Cal.App.3d 864, 872.)
 
Plaintiff’s
FAC, incorrectly titled the Second Amended Complaint, alleges only negligence,
or possibly premises liability, against Defendant. It does not allege that
Defendant acted with malice, fraud, or oppression, nor does the FAC allege any
specific facts which would support a finding of malice, oppression, or fraud as
to Defendant. Punitive damages cannot be plead generally, and a complaint
alleging punitive damages must include specific factual allegations showing
that Defendant’s conduct was oppressive, fraudulent, or malicious. 
 
Plaintiff
argues that enough facts are alleged to show Defendant’s reckless conduct, but
reckless conduct alone, without specific allegations in the FAC, to show
malice, oppression, or fraud are not sufficient to support a claim for punitive
damages pursuant to Civ. Code § 3294. 
 
Thus,
Defendant’s Motion to Strike Punitives is GRANTED.
