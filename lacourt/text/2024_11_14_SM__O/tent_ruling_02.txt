PARTY:         Defendant Jason
Varughese
 
TENTATIVE
RULING
            Plaintiff Grace Kang’s Motion for Protective Order is
GRANTED. The scope of discovery in this action is limited to exclude the
following topics (the “Excluded Topics”): 
a.
Plaintiff’s alleged sexual history; 
b.
Plaintiff’s alleged taxes; 
c.
Plaintiff’s driver’s license number; 
d.
Plaintiff’s residential property; 
e.
Plaintiff’s law firm, law firm clients, and counsel of record, Ekwan E. Rhow
and Dorothy Wolpert; 
f.
The Family Law Matter, Case No. 21STPT02902.
 
The
Court orders Defendant prohibited from seeking discovery on the Excluded Topics
in this action. Defendant is ordered to pay sanctions in the amount of $4,020.00
(4 hrs. @ $990/hr. + $60 in filing fees) within 30 days of the Order entry
pursuant to CCP §§ 2017.020(b), 2023.010, 2023.030
 
            Defendant’s RJN is GRANTED as to
the existence of the First Amended Complaint but not the truth of its
allegations.
 
            The Court need not rule on Defendants Objections as they
are not material to the disposition the motion. 
REASONING
(a) The
court shall limit the scope of discovery if it determines that the burden,
expense, or intrusiveness of that discovery clearly outweighs the likelihood
that the information sought will lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.
The court may make this determination pursuant to a motion for protective order
by a party or other affected person. This motion shall be accompanied by a meet
and confer declaration under Section 2016.040.

(b) The court shall impose a monetary sanction . . . against any party, person,
or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion for a protective
order, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust.
 
(Code
Civ. Proc., § 2017.020, subd. (a), (b).)
 
            “[T]he issuance and formulation of protective orders are
to a large extent discretionary.” (Raymond Handling Concepts Corp. v.
Superior Court (1995) 39 Cal.App.4th 584, 588.)
 
            The Discovery Act prohibits “the misuse of the discovery
process,” including the following:
 
(a) Persisting,
over objection and without substantial justification, in an attempt to obtain
information or materials that are outside the scope of permissible discovery.
. . . .
(c) Employing a
discovery method in a manner or to an extent that causes unwarranted annoyance,
embarrassment, or oppression, or undue burden and expense.
 
            (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (a), (c).)
 
            “The court may impose a monetary sanction ordering that
one engaging in the misuse of the discovery process, or any attorney advising
that conduct, or both pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney's fees,
incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030,
subd. (a).)
 
            “[E]vidence of a person's character or a trait of his or
her character (whether in the form of an opinion, evidence of reputation, or
evidence of specific instances of his or her conduct) is inadmissible when
offered to prove his or her conduct on a specified occasion.” (Evid. Code, §
1101, subd. (a).)
            Plaintiff Grace Kang (“Plaintiff”)
argues that a protective order is necessary to prevent Defendant Jason
Varughese (“Defendant”) misuse of the discovery process. Plaintiff argues that
Defendant’s RFP No. 21–22 and RFA Nos 26–27 seeking documents related to
Plaintiffs sexual history are disallowed character evidence pursuant to
Evidence Code § 1101(a), and constitute a misuse of discovery since they are
not reasonable calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. (Wolpert
Decl., ¶¶ 3, 4; Ex.. 1, 2.)
            Plaintiff argues that Defendant’s
RFAs Nos 19–22 are requesting irrelevant law firm-related discovery that Defendant
argues will reveal knowledge of Plaintiff’s “causal approach to client secrecy,”
and thus “Plaintiff’s character.” (Wolpert Decl., ¶ 4; Ex. 2.) Plaintiff agues
these law firm related discovery requests are disallowed character evidence
pursuant to Evidence Code § 1101(a), and constitute a misuse of discovery since
they are not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible
evidence. (Motion, p. 11:2–21.) 
            Plaintiff argues that Defendants RFA
No. 20 improperly requests information related to Defendant’s “false
allegations” about Plaintiff’s alleged tax evasion, which have no relevance to
the claims and defenses in this action. (Wolpert Decl., ¶ 4; Ex. 2.)
            Plaintiff argues that Defendants RFA
No. 15 and Form Interrogatory 2.3 are improper requests related to Plaintiff’s
residential properly and Plaintiff’s Drivers License respectively. (Wolpert
Decl., ¶¶ 4, 5; Ex. 2, 3.) Plaintiff argues that neither request are relevant
to the claims and defenses in the action, and that Plaintiff has a privacy
right to protect her drivers license number pursuant to Article I of the
California Constitution. (Cal. Const., Art. I, § 1; see Copley Press, Inc.
v. Superior Court (1991) 228 Cal.App.3d 77, 79 [“certain information that
is included and essential for the determination of juror qualification and
management of the jury system is not properly part of voir dire and public
access to it is not warranted . . . . [including] . . . driver's license
numbers”].)
            Finally, Plaintiff argues that
discovery related to the Family Law Matter, Case No. 21STPT02902 within
Defendant’s RFP Nos 11, 12, 14 and RFA No. 18, should be excluded because
Defendant should not be able to relitigate the Family Law Matter in civil
court, and the matter includes privileged information between Plaintiff’s
counsel and Plaintiff. Plaintiff argues she has produced discovery relating to
custody and child support in this action, and any discovery related
specifically to the Family Law Matter is beyond the scope of discovery in this
case. (Motion, pp. 5:16–6:26.)
            The Court agrees with the Plaintiff.
Additionally, Defendant does not provide any supporting authority, persuasive
arguments, or a more limited protective order for the Court to find for
Defendant.
 
Thus,
Plaintiff’s Motion for a Protective Order is GRANTED. Defendant is ordered to
pay sanctions in the amount of $4,020.00 (4 hrs. @ $990/hr. + $60 in filing
fees) within 30 days of the Order entry pursuant to CCP §§ 2017.020(b),
2023.010, 2023.030.
