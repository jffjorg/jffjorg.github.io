And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on the petition to vacate the arbitration award filed by Petitioner Ava Naeini against Respondents TD Ameritrade Inc, et al. The petition to vacate the arbitration award is denied because Petitioner Naeini failed to provide any evidence or meet their burden to vacate the arbitration award under California Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) § 1286.2(a)(1)-(6). The arbitrators did not exceed their powers, and there was no evidence of arbitrator corruption or bias. The petition to confirm the arbitration award filed by Respondents TD Ameritrade Inc, et al is granted, and the arbitration award is confirmed. The court finds that the arbitrators acted fairly and within their powers, and that the petition to vacate the arbitration award is without merit.
