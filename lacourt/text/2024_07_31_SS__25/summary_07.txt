```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the defendants' motion to compel arbitration and stay the proceedings. The court orders the instant proceedings stayed pending completion of arbitration. The court also awards the defendants attorneys' fees and court costs in the amount of $3,980, to be paid by the plaintiff and the plaintiff's attorney, jointly and severally.

The court finds that the defendants have established that the parties have agreed to arbitrate their disputes in the Service Agreement, and that the Class Action Waiver in the agreement does not bar the plaintiff from arbitrating on an individual basis. The court also finds that the plaintiff's arguments on opposition are uncertain and unintelligible and fail to demonstrate any applicability to the instant case.

The court sets a post-arbitration status conference for January 27, 2025, at 9:30 a.m. in Department 25 of the Spring Street Courthouse, and orders counsel to electronically file a joint report on the status of arbitration at least 5-court days prior to the conference.
