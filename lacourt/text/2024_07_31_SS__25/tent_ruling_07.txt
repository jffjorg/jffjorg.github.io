BACKGROUND
            
On April 17, 2024, Plaintiff
Cravon Gillespie (“Gillespie”) filed the operative Complaint against Defendants
Dillon M. Stanger (“Stanger”); Sachet M. Gagwani (“Gagwani”); DMS Internet
Holdings, LLC; (“DMS”); and G Venture Group, LLC (“Venture”) for the following
four causes of action related to a dispute arising out of an agreement to do
business: (1) Business and Professions Code (§ 17200 use of Deceptive
Practices); (2) Business and Professions Code (§ 17500—Inducing Business via
False and Misleading statements); (3) Breach of Contract; and (4) Breach of
Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing. Plaintiff alleges that on June
6, 2022[1],
Plaintiff entered into a Service Agreement (“Agreement”) with Defendants
whereby Plaintiff paid Defendants $30,000 in exchange for Defendants’ agreement
to construct an Ecommerce Webstore to sell curated good Defendants would
purchase with Plaintiff’s banking information. Defendants were to set up,
operate, manage, support, and grow Plaintiff’s Ecommerce Webstore using
Defendants’ alleged proprietary and confidential methods, strategies,
procedures, and processes which included marketing, customer support, and
promotion. According to Plaintiff, both of Defendants’ attempts to operate
Plaintiff’s e-commerce store failed. 
 
On June 14, 2024, Defendants
filed the instant Motion to Compel Arbitration (“Mot.”) which also requests the
Court order the proceedings dismissed or stayed pending resolution of
arbitration, as well as an award of attorney’s fees and costs. Defendants filed
this motion along with the Declaration of Dillon Stanger (“Stanger Decl.”) and
an attached exhibit of the Service Agreement containing the arbitration
provisions therein.[2]
 
On July 18, 2024, Plaintiff filed his Opposition which Defendants
filed a Reply to on July 24, 2024, but failed to attach their proof of service.
On July 25, 2024, Defendants filed a second Reply with the relevant proof of
service attached. 
 
ANALYSIS
 
Under
CCP §1281.2, “[o]n petition of a party to an arbitration agreement alleging the
existence of a written agreement to arbitrate a controversy and that a party
thereto refuses to arbitrate such controversy, the court shall order the
petitioner and the respondent to arbitrate the controversy if it determines
that an agreement to arbitrate the controversy exists, unless it determines
that: (a) The right to compel arbitration has been waived by the petitioner; or
(b) Grounds exist for the revocation of the agreement.” In determining whether
the arbitration agreement applies to the particular dispute in this case, the
court should attempt to give effect to the parties' intentions, in light of the
usual and ordinary meaning of contractual language and circumstances under
which the agreement was made. (Weeks v. Crow (1980) 113 Cal.App.3d 350.)

In
deciding whether to compel arbitration, judges identify the controversy and
then decide whether it is within the scope of the arbitration provisions. (Titolo
v. Cano (2007) 157 Cal.App.4th 310, 316.) “‘Doubts as to whether an
arbitration clause applies to a particular dispute are to be resolved in favor
of sending the parties to arbitration. The court should order arbitration
unless it is clear that the arbitration clause cannot be interpreted to cover
the dispute.’” (California Correctional Peace Officers Ass'n v. State (2006)
142 Cal.App.4th 198, 205.)
Defendants
provide that on June 3, 2022, Defendants G Venture Group, LLC, and DMS Internet
Holdings, LLC entered into a Service Agreement whereby certain Ecommerce
services were to be provided to Plaintiff. Defendants assert that each
Defendant in this case is entitled to an order compelling arbitration of all of
Plaintiff’s asserted individual claims consistent with the Federal Arbitration
Act (“FAA”) (9 U.S.C., §§ 1-16) and the California Arbitration Act (“CAA”) (CCP
§§ 1280 et. seq.) because Plaintiff is a party to a written Service
Agreement (“Agreement) containing an enforceable provision to arbitrate the disputes
encompassed within the action in New Jersey. (Mot., pg. 2.) Moreover,
arbitration is in the interests of judicial economy. (Id.)
 
Defendants provide the following
relevant excerpt from the June 3 Service Agreement:
 
“9. GOVERNING LAW, DISPUTES AND ARBITRATION 
 
9.1 The Service Agreement is made
under the exclusive jurisdiction of the laws of the State of New Jersey, as
applied to agreements performed wholly within the State of New Jersey.
Notwithstanding the preceding sentence with respect to applicable substantive
law, any arbitration conducted pursuant to the terms of this Service Agreement
shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C., Secs. 1-16). 
 
9.2 Any dispute, claim or controversy
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the breach, termination,
enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof, including the determination of
the scope or applicability of this agreement to arbitrate, shall be determined
by arbitration in Wayne, New Jersey before one arbitrator. The arbitrator
shall be an attorney or retired judge with no less than ten (10) years of
experience resolving disputes between merchants and service providers offering
digital marketplace sales, marketing and distribution services. The arbitration
shall be administered by JAMS pursuant to its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules
and Procedures and in accordance with the Expedited Procedures in those Rules;
provided, however, that the parties shall confirm with JAMS whether their
dispute qualifies for JAMS EndisputeTM Online Dispute Resolution services
(referenced hereafter as “Endispute” and found on
“https://www.jamsadr.com/endispute/”), and if it does, the parties agree to
resolve the dispute through Endispute services. The parties shall bear their
own costs other than for the costs of the arbitrator and JAMS services, which
shall be split evenly. The arbitrator shall issue a written opinion with
findings of fact and conclusions of law which shall not exceed ten (10) pages.
The arbitrator may award reimbursement for the costs of the arbitration,
including reasonable attorneys’ fees, to the prevailing party, in addition to
any other award issued by the arbitrator. However, the monetary value of the
award shall not exceed the amount the Client paid the Contractor minus the
Profit Split paid to the Client. This clause shall not preclude parties from
seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate
jurisdiction. Judgment on the award may be entered in any court having
jurisdiction. 
(Stanger Decl., Ex. A.)
 
On Opposition, Plaintiff argues that
Defendants’ instant Motion should be denied for two reasons: (1) it violates
relevant California case law and (2) Defendants should be permitted to engage
in limit discovery pending the resolution of the instant motion. 
 
Defendants
first argument contends that the Service Agreement is in direct violation of Jack
v. Ring LLC, 91 Cal.App.5th 1186, 1205 because the Agreement contains a
Class Action Waiver in Section 12. Specifically, Plaintiff states that
Defendants “have mandated Plaintiff to arbitrate on an ‘individual basis,’
prohibited private attorney general actions, and limited awards in arbitration
to ‘relief on behalf of the named parties.’” (Opp., pg. 2.) Plaintiff cites excerpts
from Jack containing parentheticals to other cases, including
“[arbitration provision that permits ‘relief only on an individual basis’ means
the ‘the arbitrator [is precluded] from awarding public injunctive relief which
is relief intended to benefit those other than the individual bringing the
claim’]; Rogers v. Lyft, Inc. (N.D. Cal. 2020) 452 F.Supp.3d 904,
917-918, affd. (9th Cir., Feb. 16, 2022, No. 20-15689) 2022 WL 474166 (Rogers)
. . .” (Opp., pg. 2.) Plaintiff provides the following section for Class Action
Waiver from the Service Agreement:
 
“12. CLASS ACTION WAIVER
Any legal action or arbitration arising in connection with the use of the
Ecommerce Webstore, Contractor’s Service, or any of the terms and conditions in
this Agreement must be on an individual basis. Neither Party agrees to join or
consolidate claims by or against other clients, or litigate in court or
arbitrate any claims as a representative or member of a class or in a private
Attorney General capacity.” (Opp., pg. 2.)
 
Second, Plaintiff argues that he has a
limited right to engage in discovery to determine if the Defendants engaged in
intentional fraud to induce unsuspecting clients like Plaintiff to enter into
agreement with Defendants in violation of California Business and Professions
Code § 17200—Deceptive Practices. (Opp., pgs. 4-5.) Plaintiff’s argument points
to the tenth term of the Service Agreement: 
 
“10. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY - UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES
WILL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER UNDER ANY CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY,
NEGLIGENCE OR OTHER THEORY IN LAW OR EQUITY, FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT,
SPECIAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, REVENUE OR DATA
IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, EVEN IF THE OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF
THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND EVEN IF SUCH DAMAGES ARE FORESEEABLE.
EXCEPT IN THE CASE OF INTENTIONAL FRAUD.” 
(Stanger Decl., Ex. A, pg. 15.)
 
 
Plaintiff
argues that in Arguelles-Romero v. Superior Court, 184 Cal.App.4th
825, 831-832 the Arguelles court provided that the trial court in
that case permitted plaintiffs certain limited written discovery and indicated
that if plaintiffs had any doubts regarding the veracity of [defendant’s]
responses, they could apply ex parte for follow-up discovery, which
might include a deposition. (Opp., pgs. 3-4.)
 
In
Reply, Defendants argue that Plaintiff’s argument is unintelligible, and the
cited cases are inapposite because Plaintiff has cited to two California cases
which are preempted by the FAA. (Reply, pg. 2.) Pursuant to the Supremacy Clause
of the U.S. Constitution, Defendants argue that federal law supersedes state
law on the instant matter. (Id.) Moreover, Plaintiff’s opposition does
not directly address Defendants’ motion and the foregoing cases do not apply to
the case at bar. (Id.) Jack v. Ring is distinguished from the
instant case because Jack involved a class action whereby defendant Ring
attempted to compel arbitration pursuant to their terms of service which arose
from a contract of adhesion. (Reply, pg. 3.) On the other hand, the instant
action is a private dispute between the parties which is governed by the
Service Agreement which was signed and entered into bilaterally between the
parties. Moreover, the instant action is entirely unrelated to consumer
protection laws and makes no mention of an express carve-out provision
permitting either party to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in Los
Angeles’ state or federal court. (Id.) 
 
In this case, the Court agrees that
Plaintiff’s arguments on opposition are uncertain and unintelligible and,
moreover, fail to demonstrate any applicability to the instant case. The
current case does not concern a consumer protection dispute, nor does Plaintiff
attempt to argue so. Similarly, the instant case does not concern a claim under
Private Attorney General Act (“PAGA”) and nor does Plaintiff argue so.
Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate how the Class Action Waiver contained in
section 12 applies to bar Plaintiff from arbitrating on an individual basis.
Plaintiff does not explicate an argument as to how the instant motion or
relevant arbitration provisions directly violate the public policy provisions
encouraging public injunctive relief as articulated in Jack. 
 
As
to Arguelles, Defendants argue in Reply that Arguelles has no
applicability to the instant action because it involved a consumer protection
dispute, not a private business dispute. (Reply, pg. 3.) Moreover, Arguelles
does not support Plaintiff’s contention that there is a right to limited
discovery prior to arbitration. Defendants argue the Court has no authority to
circumvent the express terms of the Service Agreement and the FAC, by allowing
the Plaintiff to conduct any such discovery outside of arbitration in New
Jersey. (Id.)
 
Again,
the Court finds the instant argument unintelligible and inapplicable. Plaintiff
quotes an excerpt from Arguelles whereby the Arguelles court
summarizes the actions of the trial court in permitting certain limited
discovery. Though the trial court in Arguelles did permit Plaintiff to
engage in limited discovery, such discovery was directed as to the issue of
enforceability of the arbitration clause and class action waiver. This was
because the Arguelles arbitration provision concerned a contract of adhesion
on a “take it or leave it basis” wherein Plaintiff had no meaningful ability to
negotiate the terms. Here, Plaintiff fails fatally to demonstrate how the facts
of the instant case relate at all to Arguelles. Plaintiff’s relevant
arbitration provisions concern what appears to be a bilateral business
agreement and Plaintiff does not attempt to argue otherwise. Moreover,
Plaintiff does not allege facts for intentional fraud as a basis for seeking
limited discovery. Thus, Arguelles is similarly inapposite. 
 
Lastly,
Defendants request the Court award Defendants attorneys’ fees for the five (5)
hours of work billed by Defendants attorney in filing the instant motion at the
rate of $500 per hour, along with $1,480 in filing fees. In total, Defendants
request $3,980 in attorneys’ fees and filing fees.
 
Thus, the Motion to Compel
Arbitration is GRANTED, and the Court orders the instant proceedings STAYED
pending completion of arbitration. The Court awards attorneys’ fees and court
costs for Defendants in the amount of $3,980, to be paid by Plaintiff and
Plaintiff’s attorney, jointly and severally. 
 
Post Arbitration Status

Spring Street Courthouse.
 
Counsel are ordered to
electronically file a JOINT Report Re: 
Status of Arbitration at least 5-court days prior to 01/27/2025.
