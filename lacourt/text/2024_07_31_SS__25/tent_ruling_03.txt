 
BACKGROUND
 
On October
5, 2020, Plaintiff State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company (“Plaintiff”)
filed a Complaint for Subrogation against Defendants Maria Reyes, Fernando X
Estrada (collectively, “Defendants”), and DOES 1 through 30, inclusive. The complaint
arises from Defendants colliding with the vehicle of Plaintiff’s insured. 
 
On
November 18, 2020, Defendants filed an Answer to the Complaint. Defendant
Fernando Estrada (“Estrada”) indicates that he was erroneously sued and served
as Fernando X Estrada. 
 
On October
20, 2021, Defendant Maria Reyes was dismissed from this action without
prejudice pursuant to a request for dismissal filed by Plaintiff. 
 
On October
22, 2021, Plaintiff filed a Stipulation for Settlement and Order (the
“Stipulation”). The Stipulation provides that Plaintiff has paid its insured
and is seeking recovery of the monies paid to its insured in the amount of
$20,454.96. (Stipulation, ¶ 1.) The parties agreed to settle this matter in the
amount of $14,481.49. (Stipulation, ¶ 3.) Defendant Estrada’s insurance
carrier, Infinity Insurance Company, was to pay its policy limit available to
Defendant Estrada under the policy of insurance issued by Infinity Insurance
Company in the amount of $6,981.59. (Stipulation, ¶ 3(a).) 
 
Defendant
Estrada was obligated to pay the remaining balance of $7,500.00 in the
following manner: “$0.00 upon signing; $100.00 shall be paid no later than
February 15, 2021 . . . [Defendant] Estrada shall thereafter make 73 payments
of $100.00, with each payment being due, consecutively, on the 15th of each
month thereafter . . .  [Defendant]
Estrada shall make on final payment on May 16, 2027 in the amount of $100.00.”
(Stipulation, ¶ 3(b)-(e).) 
 
The
Stipulation provides that if Defendant Estrada “fail[s] to make the payments,
as agreed, on the 15th of each month, he will be deemed in default of this
agreement.” (Stipulation, ¶ 5.) If Defendant Estrada is in default, the
attorney for Plaintiff “will provide [Defendant] Estrada with written notice of
the default and [Defendant] Estrada will have 10 days within which to remedy
the default.” (Stipulation, ¶ 6.) “If [Defendant] Estrada does not remedy the
attorney for [Plaintiff] may, by ex parte application, submit an order to the
court for entry of judgment against [Defendant] Estrada without further notice.
Judgment shall be entered in the amount of $20,454.96 plus interest on that
amount, at the legal rate, from 01/23/20, plus costs and attorney’s fees
incurred by the plaintiff in enforcing the Stipulation, less any payments that
have bene made by or on behalf of the defendant to the plaintiff, as of that
date.” (Stipulation, ¶ 6.) 
 
The Stipulation
indicates that if the Court dismisses this matter, then the Court shall retain
jurisdiction to enforce the Stipulation pursuant to California Code of Civil
Procedure section 664.6. (Stipulation, ¶ 8.) Each party shall bear their own
attorneys’ fees and costs except as otherwise stipulated. (Stipulation, ¶ 10.) 
 
On October
22, 2021, the Court entered an Order (the “Order”), pursuant to the
Stipulation, which dismissed this action with prejudice in its entirety but
allowed the Court to retain jurisdiction to enforce the Stipulation pursuant to
CCP § 664.6. (10/22/21 Order.) 
 
On
October 26, 2021, Plaintiff filed and served a Notice of Entry of Order which
gave Defendant Estrada notice of the Court’s October 22, 2021 Order. 
 
On June
20, 2024, Plaintiff filed a Proposed Judgment on Stipulation; however, such
filing was rejected as it was not accompanied by a declaration setting forth
the facts supporting the entry of judgment. 
 
On June
27, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant Motion to Set Aside Dismissal and for
Entry of Judgment in the Amount of $16,919.86 (the “Motion”). The Motion was
served on Defendant Estrada on June 26, 2024 via U.S. Mail. 
 
            The Court
notes that Plaintiff did not file the Motion with a proposed order.  The Court also notes that the Notice of Motion
does not set forth the courthouse address. As of July 30, 2024, the Motion is
unopposed. Any opposition to the Motion was required to have been filed and
served at least nine court days prior to the hearing. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1005,
subd. (b).)

ANALYSIS
 
I.          Setting
Aside the Dismissal and Entering Judgment    
A.               
Legal Standard 
“Code of Civil Procedure
section 664.6 provides a summary procedure to enforce a settlement agreement by
entering judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement.” Hines v. Lukes (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 1174, 1182.
“[I]f the parties to pending litigation enter into a settlement either in
writing signed by the parties or orally before the court, the court, upon a
motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement.” Ibid.
“The court retains jurisdiction to enforce a settlement under the statute even
after a dismissal, but only if the parties requested such a retention of
jurisdiction before the dismissal.” Ibid. “Such a request must be made
either in writing signed by the parties or orally before the court.” Ibid.

“A court ruling on a
motion under Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6 must determine whether the
parties entered into a valid and binding settlement.” Ibid. “A
settlement is enforceable under section 664.6 only if the parties agreed to all
material settlement terms.” Ibid. “The court ruling on the motion may
consider the parties’ declarations and other evidence in deciding what terms
the parties agreed to.” Ibid. “If the court determines that the parties
entered into an enforceable settlement, it should grant the motion and enter a
formal judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement.” Ibid. Code
Civ. Proc. § 664.6 “expressly provides for the court to enter judgment pursuant
to the terms of the settlement.” Id. at p. 1183. “It is widely recognized that the courts are
not at liberty to revise an agreement under the guise of construing it.” Series AGI Est Linn of Appian Group Investors
DE, LLC v. Eves (2013) 217 Cal.App.4th 156, 164. A prevailing party is entitled to its costs in
any action or proceeding. (CCP § 1032(b).) A prevailing party is a party with a
net monetary recovery. (CCP § 1032(a)(4).) “Except as attorney’s fees are
specifically provided for by statute, the measure and mode of compensation of
attorneys and counselors at law is left to the agreement, express or implied,
of the parties.” (CCP § 1021.) 
B.        Discussion  
In support of the motion, Plaintiff’s
counsel, David B. Pillemer (“Pillemer”), provides a declaration. Mr. Pillemer
states the following: on or about December 23, 2020, the parties entered into
the Stipulation. (Pillemer Decl., ¶ 3; Ex. 1.) Pursuant to the Stipulation and
Order, the Court retained jurisdiction to enforce the terms of the Stipulation.
(Pillemer Decl., ¶ 4.) Defendant Estrada has ceased to make payments pursuant
to the Stipulation and has failed and refused, and continues to fail and
refuse, to make any additional payments pursuant to the Stipulation. (Pillemer
Decl., ¶ 5.)  
Plaintiff’s counsel sent
correspondence to Defendant Estrada on April 24, 2024, warning him that payment
pursuant to Stipulation had not been received, and that if payment was not made
within 10 days, Plaintiff would seek to enforce the judgment provision of the
Stipulation. (Pillemer Decl., ¶ 6; Ex. 2.) 
Defendant Estrada has made payments in
the amount of $10,251.59. (Pillemer Decl., ¶ 7(d).) Interest is in the amount
of $6,279.84, which is calculated at 7 percent per annum from January 23, 2020
to June 12, 2024. (Pillemer Decl., ¶ 7(b).) The principal amount is $20,454.96.
(Pillemer Decl., ¶ 7(a).) Plaintiff has incurred $375.00 in attorneys’ fees to
enforce the Stipulation and has incurred a filing fee for the Motion of $61.65.
(Pillemer Decl., ¶ 7(c).) Thus, Plaintiff requests entry of judgment against Defendant
Estrada in the total amount of $16,619.86. (Pillemer Decl., ¶ 7.) 
The Court
finds that it has authority to enforce the Stipulation pursuant to Hines v.
Lukes, supra, 167 Cal.App.4th 1174, 1182. Plaintiff and
Defendant Estrada signed the Stipulation. The Court also has jurisdiction to
enforce the Stipulation as the parties explicitly requested—and furthermore
agreed—that the Court would retain jurisdiction to enforce such agreement. The
Court furthermore determines that the parties entered into a valid and binding
agreement. The declaration of Plaintiff’s counsel sets forth the terms of the Stipulation
and indicates that Defendant Estrada has breached the Stipulation. 
 
The Court finds that Plaintiff
is entitled to interest as well as costs and attorneys’ fees incurred in
enforcing the stipulation. (Stipulation, ¶ 7.) 
 
However,
the Court cannot grant the Motion at this time due to the defective notice of the
motion. A notice of motion must set forth “[t]he date, time, and location, if
ascertainable, of any scheduled hearing and the name of the hearing judge.”
(Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1110(b)(1).) Here, the notice of motion does not
set forth the courthouse address and merely states that this matter will be
heard in Department 25. Based on the notice of motion, Defendant Estrada would
not be able to ascertain whether the hearing on the Motion was at the Spring
Street Courthouse or the Stanley Mosk Courthouse. 
 
II.        Conclusion 
            
            Based on the foregoing, the Court CONTINUES the hearing
on Plaintiff’s Motion to Set Aside Dismissal and for Entry of Judgment to
Wednesday, September 11, 2024 at 10:00 AM in this department so that Plaintiff
can provide proper notice to Defendant Estrada.   
 
            Moving party is ordered to give
notice.
