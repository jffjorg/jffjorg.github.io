BACKGROUND
 
Plaintiff Jose Carmen Aldape (“Plaintiff” or “Aldape”) filed
this Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act lawsuit over alleged defects in his 2020
Chevrolet Silverado, VIN 3GCUYGED3LG321531 (the “Subject Vehicle”), which was
manufactured by Defendant General Motors, LLC (“Defendant” or “GM”). Plaintiff leased
the Subject Vehicle on or about May 29, 2020, entering into an express written warranty
contract with GM. (Compl. ¶¶ 6, 10.)
 
On August 15, 2022, Plaintiff filed a Complaint against GM and Does 1 through 50, alleging the following causes of
action: (1) Violation of Subdivision (d) of Civil Code Section 1793.2; (2)
Violation of Subdivision (b) of Civil Code Section 1793.2; (3) Violation of
Subdivision (a)(3) of Civil Code Section 1793.2; (4) Breach of Express Written
Warranty (Civil Code Section 17941.2 Subdivision (a), and Section 1794); and (5)
Breach of the Implied Warranty of Merchantability (Civil Code Section 1791.1,
and Section 1794). Subsequently, on September 19, 2022, GM filed its Answer to
the Complaint.
 
On March 27, 2024, Plaintiff filed a Notice of Settlement.
 
On August 7, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant Motion for
Attorney Fees. Subsequently, on November 27, 2024, GM filed an Opposition to
the Motion, and Plaintiff filed a Reply on December 5, 2024.
 
ANALYSIS
 
Attorney fees are allowed as
costs when authorized by contract, statute, or law. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5,
subd. (a)(10)(B).)¿ In a lemon law action, costs and expenses, including
attorney’s fees, may be recovered by a prevailing buyer under the Song-Beverly
Act. (See Civ. Code, § 1794, subd. (d).)¿
 
“If the buyer prevails in an action under this section, the
buyer shall be allowed by the court to recover as part of the judgment a sum
equal to the aggregate amount of costs and expenses, including attorney’s fees
based on actual time expended, determined by the court to have been reasonably
incurred by the buyer in connection with the commencement and prosecution of
such action.” (Civ. Code, § 1794.)¿
 
Thus, the statute includes a “reasonable attorney’s fees”
standard.¿ The attorney bears the burden of proof as to “reasonableness” of any
fee claim. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5 subd. (c)(5).) This burden requires
competent evidence as to the nature and value of the services rendered. (Martino
v. Denevi (1986) 182 Cal.App.3d 553, 559.) “Testimony of an attorney as to
the number of hours worked on a particular case is sufficient evidence to
support an award of attorney fees, even in the absence of detailed time
records.” (Ibid.)¿
 
A plaintiff’s verified billing invoices are prima facie
evidence that the costs, expenses, and services listed were necessarily
incurred. (See Hadley v. Krepel (1985) 167 Cal.App.3d 677, 682.) “In
challenging attorney fees as excessive because too many hours of work are
claimed, it is the burden of the challenging party to point to the specific
items challenged, with a sufficient argument and citations to the evidence.
General arguments that fees claimed are excessive, duplicative, or unrelated do
not suffice.” (Lunada Biomedical v. Nunez (2014) 230 Cal.App.4th 459,
488, quoting Premier Med. Mgmt. Sys., Inc. v. California Ins. Guarantee
Ass’n (2008) 163 Cal.App.4th 550, 564.) The Court has discretion to reduce
fees that result from inefficient or duplicative use of time. (Horsford v.
Bd. of Trustees of California State Univ. (2005) 132 Cal. App. 4th 359,
395.)¿
 
In determining a reasonable attorney fees, the trial court
begins with the lodestar, i.e., the number of hours reasonably expended
multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate. (Warren v. Kia Motors America, Inc.
(2018) 30 Cal.App.5th 24, 36.) The lodestar may then be adjusted based on
factors specific to the case in order to fix the fee at the fair market value
of the legal services provided. (Ibid.) These facts include (1) the
novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, (2) the skill displayed in
presenting them, (3) the extent to which the nature of the litigation precluded
other employment by the attorneys, (4) the contingent nature of the fee award.
(Ibid.)¿ 
 
A.   
Motion for
Attorney Fees
 
 
(1)  
Prevailing
Party
 
Plaintiff seeks an award of attorney’s fees pursuant to
settlement agreement reached by the parties. (Wood Decl. ¶ 40.) It is
undisputed that Plaintiff is the prevailing party in this action and entitled
to a reasonable amount in attorney fees.
 
(2)  
Reasonableness
of Hourly Rates
 
“The reasonable hourly rate is that
prevailing in the community for similar work.” (PLCM Group v. Drexler
(2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095.) “The experienced trial judge is the best judge
of the value of professional services rendered in [her] court.” (Ibid.) 
 
Plaintiff seeks to recover attorney fees
for five attorneys who worked on the case: (1) Carey Wood at $450 per hour
through August 2022, $500 per hour from August 2022, and $520 per hour from
January 4, 2024; (2) Lara Rogers at $350 per hour; (3) Crystle Caigoy at $380
per hour; (4) Jason Roberge at $400 per hour; and (5) Jessica Anvar at $515 per
hour. Additionally, Plaintiff seeks to recover fees for paralegals that worked
on the case, at a rate between $175-$200 per hour. (Mot. at p. 8.)
 
Plaintiff’s counsel demonstrates that the
attorney’s rates are commonly accepted within their community of practice in
the relevant area of law. (Wood Decl. ¶¶ 43-55.) Notably, GM does not dispute the
reasonableness of these rates.
 
Accordingly, the Court finds the hourly
rates for Plaintiff’s attorneys and paralegals to be reasonable.
 
(3)   Reasonableness of Hours
Incurred
 
“A trial court assessing attorney fees
begins with a touchstone or lodestar figure, based on the ‘careful compilation
of the time spent and reasonable hourly compensation of each attorney ...
involved in the presentation of the case.” (Christian Research Institute v.
Alnor (2008) 165 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1321.) “The reasonableness of attorney
fees is within the discretion of the trial court, to be determined from a
consideration of such factors as the nature of the litigation, the complexity
of the issues, the experience and expertise of counsel and the amount of time
involved. The court may also consider whether the amount requested is based
upon unnecessary or duplicative work.” (Wilkerson v. Sullivan (2002) 99
Cal.App.4th 443, 448.) 
 
Plaintiff seeks to recover attorney fees
for 79.5 hours litigating this matter. Plaintiff has submitted billing records.
(Mot. at pp. 8-9, Wood Decl. ¶
56, Exs. 5, 6.)
 
GM
objects to several of Plaintiff’s requested hours on the grounds that they are
excessive and unreasonable based on Plaintiff’s counsel’s use of templates to
create documents. (Opp’n. at p. 8.) GM further objects to several requested
hours on the basis that these tasks are not compensable because they are
routine business expenses or clerical work. (Id. at p. 9.)
First,
GM objects to 2.7 hours ($945.00) billed on September 26 and December 5, 2022,
to prepare discovery requests on the grounds that these requests and notice are
templated. (Opp’n. at p. 8.)
 
Second,
GM objects to 2.4 hours ($840.00) billed on November 14 and 18, 2022, to
prepare Plaintiff’s discovery responses on the grounds that the responses are
largely templated. (Opp’n. at p. 8.)
 
Third,
GM objects to 9.6 hours ($3,360.00) billed on January 24, July 18 and 24, 2023,
to draft the motion to compel further responses, prepare reply, and attend the
hearings. GM argues that the motion and reply papers are essentially templated.
(Opp’n. at p. 8.)
 
Fourth,
GM objects to 2.6 hours ($1,047.50) billed on December 13, 2023, and January 4,
2024, to draft non-party deposition subpoena on the grounds that time spent is
excessive as the subpoenas were 2-page, fill-in-blank forms, and that changing
names and titles in a subpoena are purely clerical tasks thus not recoverable
as attorney fees. (Opp’n. at p. 9.)
 
            Fifth,
GM objects to 8.3 hours ($4,357.50) billed on July 24 and August 5, 2024, spent
on the fee motion and memorandum of costs, on the grounds that they are
excessive. (Opp’n. at p. 9.)
 
Sixth,
GM objects to $5,000.00 anticipated fees to review GM’s Opposition and prepare
a Reply brief in the instant Motion. GM contends that the fees are excessive
and unreasonable. (Opp’n, at p. 9.)
 
Seventh,
GM objects to 6 hours ($2,624.50) billed throughout the records in 0.1
increments for continual attorney status meetings and calendar reviews on the
grounds that they are redundant and excessive. (Opp’n, at p. 9.) 
 
Eighth,
GM objects to 9.8 hours ($1,960.00) billed by paralegal David Gomez on the
grounds that clerical work is not recoverable as attorney fees.
 
GM
contends that Plaintiff’s demand should be reduced for a maximum award of
$16,440.45. (Opp’n. at p. 4.)
 
Here, most of the hours spent on this
matter are reasonable. However, the Court adjusts Plaintiff’s anticipated fees
to review the Opposition and prepare Reply papers to 4 hours reasonably spent,
at Mr. Wood’s current rate of $520.00 per hour.
 
Therefore, Plaintiff’s billing should be
reduced to a total of $30,760. ($28,680 + ($520/hr. x 4 hrs.))
 
(4)   Multiplier
 
While the lodestar reflects the basic fee for comparable
legal services in the community, it may be adjusted based on various factors,
including “(1) the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, and the
skill displayed in presenting them; (2) the extent to which the nature of the
litigation precluded other employment by the attorneys; (3) the contingent
nature of the fee award” and (4) the success achieved. (Serrano v. Priest
(1977) 20 Cal.3d 25, 49.) 
 
Plaintiff requests a lodestar multiplier enhancement of 0.
5, arguing that the multiplier is reasonable due to the quality of
representation and results obtained, complexity of the issues involved, and the
risks of non-recovery posed due to the contingency nature of the
representation. (Mot. at pp. 10-11.) 
 
The Court finds that this case does not
present any extraordinary circumstances warranting the application of a
multiplier.
 
            Based on the foregoing, the Court
GRANTS IN PART the Motion and awards Plaintiff $30, 760.00 in reasonable
attorney fees. 
 
CONCLUSION
 
The
Motion for Attorney Fees is GRANTED IN PART. The Court awards $30,760.00 in reasonable
attorney fees in favor of Plaintiff.
