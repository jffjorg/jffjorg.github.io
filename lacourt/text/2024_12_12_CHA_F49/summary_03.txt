Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion filed by Siteone Landscape Supply LLC to compel Defendant Calvin Alexander Kim to respond to Form Interrogatories, Set One. The judge finds that Defendant Kim failed to serve a timely response to the discovery requests, thereby waiving any objection to the interrogatories. The judge also finds that relief under Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.290, subdivision (a), is unavailable in this circumstance.

As a result, the judge orders Defendant Kim to serve verified responses, without objection, to the Form Interrogatories, Set One, within 20 days. Additionally, the judge grants in part the plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions, ordering Defendant Kim to pay $860.00 to the plaintiff's attorney of record within 20 days.
