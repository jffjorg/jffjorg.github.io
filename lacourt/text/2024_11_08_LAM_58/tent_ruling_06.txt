[1] The statute of
frauds argument in the demurrer to the TAC is only slightly more developed than
it has been in the past. However, Defendants’ reply omits any discussion of
this defense in response to Plaintiffs’ opposition argument that this defense
has already been rejected by the Court at the demurrer stage. In any event,
contrary to the demurrer argument, Plaintiffs are not seeking to enforce an
oral agreement for the “sale of real property.” (Civ. Code, §
1624.)
