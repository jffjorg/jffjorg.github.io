And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion to set aside the entry of default and default judgment filed by the defendants. The defendants had alleged that the plaintiffs had committed fraud and that they were denied a fair hearing. However, the judge found that there was no evidence of fraud and that the defendants' own actions, including failing to pay court-ordered monetary sanctions and responding late to discovery requests, contributed to the entry of default judgment. The judge also denied the defendants' request for relief under the mandatory provision of Code of Civil Procedure section 473, citing inadequate evidence and lack of clear responsibility for the defects that resulted in the entry of default judgment. Additionally, the judge denied the plaintiffs' request for sanctions under Code of Civil Procedure section 128.5, finding that the defendants' motion to set aside was not made in bad faith.
