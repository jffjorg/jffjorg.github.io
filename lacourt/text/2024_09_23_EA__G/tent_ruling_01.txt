TENTATIVE RULING
Plaintiffs Tamara Weaver and Christopher Martinez’s
Motion to Enforce Compliance with the Court’s July 10, 2024 Order is GRANTED and Defendant Hyundai Motor America is
ordered to serve code-complaint responses on Plaintiffs Tamara Weaver
and Christopher Martinez within ten (10)
days of the issuance of this order.
Furthermore, Plaintiffs
Tamara Weaver and Christopher Martinez’s
Request for Sanctions is GRANTED against Defendant Hyundai Motor America and Defendant
Hyundai Motor America’s Counsel in the amount of $510.00, payable within thirty
(30) days of the issuance of this order.
BACKGROUND
This is a Song-Beverly
action. In August 2018, Plaintiffs Tamara Weaver and Christopher Martinez
allegedly entered into a warranty contract with Defendant Hyundai Motor America
(Hyundai) by purchasing a 2018 Hyundai Elantra. Subsequently, Weaver and
Martinez allege the vehicle presented with serious defects including engine,
suspension, electrical, steering, emission, and transmission system defects. 
On January 23, 2024, Weaver
and Martinez filed a complaint against Hyundai; Romero Motors, LLC, doing
business as Ontario Hyundai; and Does 1-10, alleging the following causes of
action: (1) breach of express warranty, (2) breach of implied warranty, (3)
violation of Song-Beverly Act section 1793.2, subdivision (b), and (4)
negligent repair.
On August 16, 2024, Weaver
and Martinez filed the present motion. A hearing on their motion is set for September
23, 2024, along with a post-mediation status conference/trial setting
conference on February 11, 2025.
ANALYSIS
Weaver and Martinez move to
compel Hyundai’s compliance with the court’s ruling at an informal discovery
conference on July 10, 2024. At the informal discovery conference, the court
ordered Hyundai to provide verified responses to Weaver and Martinez’s initial
discovery requests by July 26, 2024. (07/10/2024 Minute Order.) Weaver and
Martinez’s counsel states Hyundai has failed to provide the required responses
by the court-mandated deadline and by the time the present motion was filed. (Schmitt
Decl., ¶ 10, 14.) In opposition, Hyundai’s counsel does not deny failing to
provide the ordered discovery responses and states they will be provided by the
time this motion is heard. (Hassantash Decl., ¶ 9.) But a promise to comply in
the future is insufficient when discovery responses are now overdue.
Accordingly, the court GRANTS Weaver and Martinez’s motion.
Weaver and Martinez also
request the award of $2,957.50 in sanctions against Hyundai and Hyundai’s
counsel. Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010, subdivision (g),
conduct subject to sanctions includes “[d]isobeying a court order to provide
discovery.” And “California discovery law authorizes a range of penalties for a
party’s refusal to obey a discovery order, including monetary sanctions,
evidentiary sanctions, issue sanctions, and terminating sanctions.” (Lopez
v. Watchtower Bible & Tract Society of New York, Inc. (2016) 246
Cal.App.4th 566, 604.)
Because Hyundai’s failure to
comply with the court’s previous order necessitated the filing of this motion,
the court GRANTS their request for sanctions.
Utilizing a lodestar approach,
and in view of the totality of the circumstances, the court awards sanctions
and finds reasonable attorney fees and costs in the total of amount of $510.00
($450.00 for 1.5 hours drafting the moving/reply papers and 0.5 hours attending
the hearing at an hourly rate of $225.00 plus $60.00 in filing
fees).
