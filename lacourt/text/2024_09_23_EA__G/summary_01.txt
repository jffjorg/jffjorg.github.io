As for the English-text summary:

The court's tentative ruling grants the motion of plaintiffs Tamara Weaver and Christopher Martinez to enforce compliance with the court's July 10, 2024 order. The order requires defendant Hyundai Motor America to serve code-complaint responses on the plaintiffs within 10 days of the issuance of this order. Additionally, the court awards sanctions against Hyundai Motor America and its counsel in the amount of $510.00, payable within 30 days. This ruling follows a dispute over discovery responses, which were due on July 26, 2024, but were not provided by Hyundai Motor America. The court finds that Hyundai's failure to comply with the court's order necessitated the filing of this motion and awards sanctions accordingly.
