SUMMARY OF ACTION
Plaintiff Carla Rice commenced employment with County of
Los Angeles Department of Health Services on December 2, 20219, as a Staff
Analyst, and was terminated on May 28, 2020. Plaintiff alleges requests for
accommodation for “disabilities,” which required “time off for doctors
appointments, leave, teleworking, and a flexible schedule,” but was instead met
with a “hostile work environment” arising from alleged sexual, gender and
disability discriminatory motivation. County employee, defendant Joshua Legere,
allegedly made a number of disparaging remarks, referring to women as “useless”
“bitches,” or “nasty bitches,” and accusing Plaintiff of faking her disability
and forging her doctors’ note, which Plaintiff interprets as the basis of the
wrongful motives. 
 
On July 30, 2021, Plaintiff filed a complaint for 1.
Discrimination in Violation of Gov’t Code §§12940 et seq.; 2. Harassment in
Violation of Gov’t Code §§12940 et seq.; 3. Retaliation in Violation of Gov’t
Code §§12940 et seq.; 4. Failure Provide Reasonable Accommodation in Violation
of Gov’t Code §§12940 et seq.; 5. Failure to Engage in a Good Faith Interactive
Process In Violation of Gov’t Code §§12940 et seq.; 6. Failure to Prevent
Discrimination, Harassment, and Retaliation in Violation of Gov’t Code §12940(K);
and 7. Declaratory Judgment. County of Los Angeles answered the complaint on
November 29, 2021. Legere answered the complaint on August 5, 2022.

Defendant County of Los Angeles (County) moves for
summary judgment/summary adjudication on the entire complaint for 1.
Discrimination in Violation of Gov’t Code §§12940 et seq.; 2. Harassment in
Violation of Gov’t Code §§12940 et seq.; 3. Retaliation in Violation of Gov’t
Code §§12940 et seq.; 4. Failure Provide Reasonable Accommodation in Violation
of Gov’t Code §§12940 et seq.; 5. Failure to Engage in a Good Faith Interactive
Process In Violation of Gov’t Code §§12940 et seq.; 6. Failure to Prevent Discrimination,
Harassment, and Retaliation in Violation of Gov’t Code §12940(K); and 7.
Declaratory Judgment. County moves for summary judgment/summary adjudication on
grounds of a lack of evidence supporting any and all causes of action.
 
The subject motion falls inside the 30-day period
preceding the trial date, due to the court entered stipulation of the parties.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (a)(3).) The court therefore considers the
motion based on the special setting stipulation.
 
The pleadings
frame the issues for motions, “since it is those allegations to which
the motion must respond. (Citation.)” 
(Scolinos v. Kolts (1995) 37
Cal. App. 4th 635, 640-641; FPI Development, Inc. v. Nakashima (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 367, 382-383; Jordan-Lyon Prods., LTD. v. Cineplex Odeon Corp. (1994) 29
Cal.App.4th 1459, 1472.) The purpose of a motion for summary
judgment or summary adjudication “is to provide courts with a mechanism to cut
through the parties’ pleadings in order to determine whether, despite their
allegations, trial is in fact necessary to resolve their dispute.” (Aguilar v. Atl. Richfield Co. (2001) 25
Cal.4th 826, 843.)  “Code of
Civil Procedure section 437c, subdivision ©, requires the trial judge to grant
summary judgment if all the evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably
deducible from the evidence’ and uncontradicted by other inferences or
evidence, show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that
the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.”  (Adler
v. Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.)  
 
“On a motion for summary judgment, the initial burden is
always on the moving party to make a prima facie showing that there are no
triable issues of material fact.” (Scalf
v. D.B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1519.) A
defendant moving for summary judgment “has met his or her burden of showing
that a cause of action has no merit if the party has shown that one or more
elements of the cause of action . . . cannot be established.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2).)
“Once the defendant . . . has met that burden, the burden shifts to the
plaintiff . . . to show that a triable issue of one or more material facts
exists as to the cause of action or a defense thereto.” (Ibid.) 
 
“When deciding whether to grant summary judgment, the court
must consider all of the evidence set forth in the papers (except evidence to
which the court has sustained an objection), as well as all reasonable
inference that may be drawn form that evidence, in the light most favorable to
the party opposing summary judgment.” (Avivi v. Centro Medico Urgente Medical Center (2008) 159
Cal.App.4th 463, 467; see also Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd.
©.) “An issue of fact can only be created by a conflict in the evidence.  It is not created by speculation, conjecture,
imagination or guesswork.”  (Lyons v. Security Pacific National Bank
(1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 1001, 1041 (citation omitted).)
 
County contends that the complaint only consists of Plaintiff
Rice describing allegedly harassing conduct, and otherwise lacks factual
support. The cause of termination was Plaintiff’s own violation of the telework
policy and agreement. Plaintiff in a one-day late opposition challenges the
evidentiary support to the motion, and challenges the sufficiency of the
evidence to the extent any such evidence remains considered in the instant
motion. (While the court accepts the late opposition under the circumstances,
the court will not generally accept stipulations shortening statutory
deadlines.) County in reply challenges the late filed opposition. County next
contends that Plaintiff fails to submit any evidence in support of
discrimination, harassment, or pretextual termination. County maintains the
“inability” to accommodate was the result of the failure to submit sufficient
medical documentation rather than any wrongful conduct. 
 
The court addresses the material impact of the
evidentiary objections as to the sufficiency of the declarations. “Whenever,
under any law of this state or under any rule, regulation, order or requirement
made pursuant to the law of this state, any matter is required or permitted to
be supported, evidenced, established, or proved by the sworn statement,
declaration, verification, certificate, oath, or affidavit, in writing of the
person making the same (other than a deposition, or an oath of office, or an oath
required to be taken before a specified official other than a notary public),
such matter may with like force and effect be supported, evidenced, established
or proved by the unsworn statement, declaration, verification, or certificate,
in writing of such person which recites that it is certified or declared by him
or her to be true under penalty of perjury, is subscribed by him or her, and
(1), if executed within this state, states the date and place of execution, or
(2), if executed at any place, within or without this state, states the date of
execution and that it is so certified or declared under the laws of the State
of California.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2015.5.)
 
The declarations of Joshua Legere, Leepi Shimkhada, and
Jessica Neighbors, lack any indication of the execution within the state of
California, or a location outside of California, yet in compliance with
California law. The declarations are therefore in violation of Code of Civil
Procedure section 2015.5, and cannot be presented as evidence in support of the
motion for summary adjudication. (Kulshrestha v. First Union
Commercial Corp. (2004) 33 Cal.4th
601, 618.) The court otherwise finds the witnesses and counsel qualified to
testify. (Roy Brothers Drilling Co. v.
Jones (1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 175, 182.)
 
The separate statement in support of the motion provides
limited citation to certain sources of the purported undisputed statements,
with only three identified sources—the declaration of Joshua Legere, “County
Production Bate Numbers...” and “Supplemental County Production Bate Numbers
...” (Cal. Rules Ct., rule 3.1350(d)(3).) The purpose of the separate statement
is to apprize all parties of the issues and to permit the trial court to
determine the existence of disputed facts. (Parkview Villas Assn., Inc. v. State Farm Fire
& Casualty Co. (2005) 133 Cal.App.4th 1197, 1210.) The motion itself contains
declarations from Joshua Legere, Leepi Shimkhada, and attorney Jessica
Neighbors, though the separate statement only references Legere and
incorporates by reference the Neighbors declaration by Bates numbers. The Bates
stamped documents are not presented in order, and the court cannot locate
certain items listed in the separate statement. The court declines to search
through the voluminous exhibits for documents that may or may not be
incorporated simply by number alone on behalf of County. 
 
County made no attempt to correct the declarations following the
submission of the objections. The court therefore need not consider any
prejudice to Plaintiff in responding to any subsequently corrected
declarations. (Wall
Street Network, Ltd. v. New York Times Co. (2008)
164 Cal.App.4th 1171, 1182-1183; Plenger
v. Alza Corp. (1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 349,
362 (footnote 8); Weiss v. Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. (1988) 204 Cal.App.3d 1094, 1098.)..
 
The court finds the defective
separate statement and inadmissible declarations precludes the consideration of
any and all relied upon evidence, and therefore a finding of a failure to shift
the burden as part of a motion for summary judgment/summary adjudication. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (d), (p)(2).)  The motion for summary judgment and summary
adjudication is therefore denied on this basis. 
 
Even if the court considered the declarations, the court
alternatively finds triable issues of material fact. The court addresses the
individual claims. 
 
1st Cause of Action: Discrimination in
Violation of Government Code 12940, et seq.
2nd Cause of Action: Harassment in Violation
of Government Code 12940, et seq.
3rd Cause of Action: Retaliation in Violation
of Government Code 12940, et seq.
6th Cause of Action: Failure to Prevent
Discrimination, Harassment and Retaliation in Violation of Government Code
12940, et seq.
Assuming the court considers the actual presented
declarations and certain content, the court is presented with a challenge to
the claims for harassment on grounds of sex/gender and disabilities/perceived
disabilities, to prevent discrimination on the basis of sex/gender and
disabilities/perceived disabilities, and retaliation for engagement in
protected activities. [Comp., ¶¶ 27, 38, 48, 52, 59.] Legere presents a very
factually descriptive challenge.
 
Legere
represents Plaintiff was terminated as a result of poor work performance during
the probationary period for the first six months of employment. Legere
documents the following course of action. On December 5, 2019, three days after
commencing employment, Plaintiff failed to appear for work. Plaintiff insisted
on working from home via telecommuting on a non-assigned telework day, and
without approval of any supervisor. On December 13, 2019, Plaintiff again
failed to appear for work without notice, and again expressed intention to
telework without approval. On December 16, 2019, the telework policy was
cancelled for all staff members of the unit. Plaintiff left work early on
December 18, 2019, and proceeded to telework notwithstanding the cancellation
of the policy. On February 7, 10, 11, and 12, 2020, Plaintiff was absent
without excuse, and proceeded to telework four of the six days. On February 13,
2020, Legere and supervisor Shimkhada met with Plaintiff regarding unexcused
absences and the cancellation of the telecommuting policy. Plaintiff left work
early on February 18, 2020, and failed to appear at all on February 20, 2020,
again only telecommuting. For the time period of February 1 through February
20, 2020, Plaintiff submitted a falsified timecard maintaining full workdays.
Plaintiff then represented sending e-mails requesting approval, none of which
were located by any e-mail server. [Declaration of Joshua Legere.]
 
At the
time of the six-month review period at the end of the probationary period,
Legere gave Plaintiff an “Unsatisfactory” performance evaluation. In addition
to the absences, the evaluation further noted that Plaintiff failed to complete
substantive number of requirements for a certain assigned work project. [Leger
Decl., Ex. N.] Program Implementation Manager of the Housing for Health
Program Leepi Shimkhada confirms the lack of permission for telecommuting work
on the operative dates identified by Legere. [Declaration of Leepi Shimkhada.] Plaintiff was purportedly
offered noise cancelling headphones and/or a voluntarily transfer to another
position, both of which were rejected. Plaintiff then requested a service
animal. County again requested medical documentation, which was never provided.
[Declaration of Jessica Neighbors, Ex. A & Ex. B: Deposition of Carla
Rice.]
 
On the
failure to accommodate claim, the County of Los Angeles maintains work
coordinator, Alicia Maravilla, requested a medical note supporting the
requested accommodation. On February 24, 2020, Plaintiff provided a note from
Lindsay O’Shea, PhD, a psychotherapist, describing symptoms and attendance for treatment,
but also lacking any specific requested accommodations or restrictions. [Neighbors
Decl., Ex. A.] 
 
A
subsequent investigation of the probationary period by Civil Service
Representative Sonia Gutierrez recommended termination of Plaintiff for
violation of numerous county policies. The recommendation was approved, and
Plaintiff was terminated from employment on May 28, 2020 for all documented
reasons: 1) Plaintiff failed to notify her supervisors regarding her
absences and had unscheduled absences on February 18 and 19, 2020, for which
Plaintiff falsified an email from Mr. Legere; 2) Plaintiff did not attend work
at her assigned work location and teleworked without prior authorization on
December 5, 2019; 3) Plaintiff did not attend work at her assigned work
location and teleworked without prior authorization on December 13, 2019; 4)
Plaintiff refused to follow supervisor instructions and teleworked on December
18, 2019 without prior authorization; 5) Plaintiff refused to follow supervisor
instructions and had unscheduled absences between February 6-10, 2019; and 6)
Plaintiff had an unscheduled absence, refused to follow supervisor instruction,
and teleworked without authorization on February 11 and 12, 2020; and, 7)
Plaintiff falsified timecards. [Neighbors Decl., Ex. F: Deposition of Sonia
Gutierrez.]
 
Legere
challenges the purported statements both alleged in the operative complaint and
in discovery, whereby Legere purported referred to female employees as “1)
bitches; 2.) hacks; 3.) cunts; and 4.) useless.” Plaintiff additionally
maintains the following statements regarding other women in in the office, but
not necessarily directed at Plaintiff: “She is a grifter and her husband is a
worthless cuck. She is dependent on DHS’ money because he [her husband] has one
foot in the grave. He was a big shot in radio now she’s the breadwinner haha.
Have you been to her office? She is a total hack, a grifter. We should not have
a contract with that crazy bitch, I’ve been telling the higher ups for years.”
“I hope you’re here to work because if I have to sit next to one more worthless
woman yapping on the phone and shopping all day I am going to lose my shit.”
“She is only here because we are stuck with her over a bullshit workman’s comp.
claim. She leaves for hours everyday and shops. She’s worthless.” “How can you
stand walking in their office? It’s mindboggling. Vicki has food piled to the
ceiling and all they do is complain all day. Eat and complain. Eat and complain.
The hen house haha.” “Those women sit around and look for reasons to throw
parties and here you are with a cupcake. What’s today’s celebration? Are you
going to eat that?” Finally, direct comments made to Plaintiff, include: “Why
are you wearing high heels to work? Are you not aware of your surroundings? We
work on skid row and literally walk in shit every day. Ridiculous.” Plaintiff
also maintains that Legere accused Plaintiff of “faking” any and all claimed
disability and forged the doctor’s(’s) note(s). Finally described Plaintiff as
“unfit, crazy and useless.” The comments were repeated every week. Even
conceding to the potential veracity of the statements, Legere still maintains a
lack of evidence establishing a direct nexus between the purported statements
and the employment termination at the end of the probationary period. [Legere
Decl.]
 
“The
specific elements of a prima facie case [for discrimination] may vary depending
on the particular facts. (Citation) Generally,
the plaintiff must provide evidence that (1) [s]he was a member of a protected
class, (2) [s]he was qualified for the position he sought or was performing
competently in the position he held, (3) [s]he suffered an adverse employment
action, such as termination, demotion, or denial of an available job, and (4)
some other circumstance suggests discriminatory motive.” (Guz v. Bechtel Nat. Inc. (2000) 24
Cal.4th 317, 355.) “Harassment claims are based on a type of conduct that is
avoidable and unnecessary to job performance. No supervisory employee needs to
use slurs or derogatory drawings, to physically interfere with freedom of
movement, to engage in unwanted sexual advances, etc., in order to carry out
the legitimate objectives of personnel management.” (Reno v. Baird (1998) 18
Cal.4th 640, 646.) “‘Workplace harassment between opposite genders, including
words with sexual content or connotations, does not automatically establish
sexual discrimination. 
 
“‘[W]orkplace
harassment, even harassment between men and women, is [not] automatically
discrimination because of sex merely because the words used have sexual content
or connotations.’ (Citation.) Rather, ‘”[t]he critical issue ... is whether members of
one sex are exposed to disadvantageous terms or conditions of employment to
which members of the other sex are not exposed.”’ (Citations).) This means a
plaintiff in a sexual harassment suit must show ‘the conduct at issue was not
merely tinged with offensive sexual connotations, but actually constituted “discrimina [tion ] ... because of ...
sex.”’” (Lyle v. Warner Brothers
Television Productions (2006) 38 Cal.4th 264, 279–280.)
 
Disability
discrimination requires a plaintiff show she “(1) suffered from a disability, (2)
could perform the essential duties of a job with or without reasonable
accommodation, and (3) was subjected to an adverse employment action because of the disability or
perceived disability.
(Citation.)
To establish a prima
facie case, the employee
must show ‘actions taken by the employer from which one can infer, if such
actions remain unexplained, that it is more likely than not that such actions
were “based on a [prohibited] discriminatory criterion ....”’ (Citation.) The
employee's burden of proving a prima facie case is not onerous, and very
little evidence is required at this step.” (Zamora
v. Security Industry Specialists, Inc.
(2021) 71 Cal.App.5th 1, 37 [internal quotation marks omitted].)
 
“To
establish a prima facie case of retaliation, a plaintiff must show that she
engaged in a protected activity, that she was thereafter subjected to adverse
employment action by her employer, and there was a causal link between the two.”
(Fisher v. San Pedro Peninsula Hospital (1989) 214 Cal.App.3d 590, 614.) “[C]ourts considering the
question of what constitutes
an adverse employment action for purposes of a statutory
retaliation claim have uniformly held an intermediate retaliatory employment
action may suffice: ‘The legislative purpose underlying FEHA's prohibition
against retaliation is to prevent employers from deterring employees from
asserting good faith discrimination complaints, and the use of intermediate
retaliatory actions may certainly have this effect.’ (Citations.) However, courts
also have been united in the view that an employer's intermediate decision or
action ‘constitutes actionable retaliation only if it had a substantial and
material adverse effect on the terms and conditions of the plaintiff's
employment.’ (Citations.)” (Pinero v.
Specialty Restaurants Corp. (2005) 130 Cal.App.4th 635, 641.) A
pattern of conduct, rather than a single incident can support a finding of
adverse employment. (Yanowitz v. L'Oreal
USA, Inc. (2005) 36 Cal.4th 1028, 1056.)
 
The declaration of Legere and deposition of Rice directly
contradict each other in terms of alleged comments marginalizing emotional,
functional state of female employees. The court as a matter of law cannot weigh
the credibility of the evidence. The court finds the evidence supports the
existence of triable issues of material fact on the existence of harassment,
retaliation, and discrimination on the basis of gender in this context. 
 
4th Cause of Action: Failure to Provide
Reasonable Accommodation in Violation of Government Code 12940, et seq.
5th Cause of Action: Failure to Engage in a
Good Faith Interactive Process in Violation of Government Code 12940, et seq.
The court also finds the deposition of Rice specifically
represents both notifying and engaging the interactive process regarding
certain psychological trauma and the requirement for accommodation. Plaintiff
in fact provided medical records. Plaintiff maintains the only option presented
was a transfer from the unit possibly following the rejection of use/further
use of the noise cancelling headphones. Plaintiff maintains the ability to
perform all job duties otherwise, and requested a telecommuting accommodation
in order to avoid the environment created at the office and resulting stress.
Plaintiff also denies any reasonable consideration of the service animal
request. The court therefore finds triable issues of material fact on the
failure to accommodate claims as well. 
 
The court declines to find as a matter of law that the
interactive process was sufficient and Plaintiff reasonably accommodated for
purposes of the summary judgment, and Plaintiff was only terminated as a result
of workplace rule violations. (Zamora v. Security Industry Specialists, Inc. (2021) 71 Cal.App.5th at pp. 54-55.) 
 
7th Cause of Action: Declaratory Judgment
To the extent the motion relies on undermining the claims
in the preceding causes of action, the court also finds triable issues of
material fact in the instant cause of action. 
 
The court therefore denies the motion for summary
judgment/summary adjudication in its entirety.

Sustained.    Defendant Joshua Legere moves for summary
judgment/summary adjudication on the second cause of action for Harassment in
Violation of Gov’t Code §§12940 et seq. Leger is only named in the subject
cause of action. Legere moves for summary judgment/summary adjudication on
grounds of a lack of evidence supporting any harassment on the basis of gender
or disability. The subject motion falls inside the 30-day period
preceding the trial date, due to the court entered stipulation of the parties.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (a)(3).) The court therefore considers the
motion based on the special setting stipulation. The pleadings
frame the issues for motions, “since it is those allegations to which
the motion must respond. (Citation.)” 
(Scolinos v. Kolts (1995) 37
Cal. App. 4th 635, 640-641; FPI Development, Inc. v. Nakashima (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 367, 382-383; Jordan-Lyon Prods., LTD. v. Cineplex Odeon Corp. (1994) 29
Cal.App.4th 1459, 1472.) The purpose of a motion for summary judgment or
summary adjudication “is to provide courts with a mechanism to cut through the
parties’ pleadings in order to determine whether, despite their allegations,
trial is in fact necessary to resolve their dispute.” (Aguilar v. Atl. Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.)  “Code of Civil Procedure section 437c,
subdivision (c), requires the trial judge to grant summary judgment if all the
evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence’
and uncontradicted by other inferences or evidence, show that there is no
triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to

Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.)   “On a motion for summary judgment, the initial burden is
always on the moving party to make a prima facie showing that there are no
triable issues of material fact.” (Scalf
v. D.B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1519.) A defendant
moving for summary judgment “has met his or her burden of showing that a cause

(Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2).) “Once the defendant . . . has

imagination or guesswork.”  (Lyons v. Security Pacific National Bank
(1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 1001, 1041 (citation omitted).) Legere contends that the instant cause of action only
consists of Plaintiff Rice describing allegedly harassing conduct, and
otherwise lacks factual support. The cause of termination was Plaintiff’s own
violation of the telework policy and agreement. Plaintiff in a one-day late
opposition challenges the evidentiary support to the motion, and challenges the
sufficiency of the evidence to the extent any such evidence remains considered
in the instant motion. (While the court accepts the late opposition under the
circumstances, the court will not generally accept stipulations shortening
statutory deadlines.) County in reply challenges the late filed opposition.
County next contends that Plaintiff fails to submit any evidence in support of
discrimination, harassment, or pretextual termination. County maintains the
“inability” to accommodate was the result of the failure to submit sufficient medical
documentation rather than any wrongful conduct.  The court addresses the material impact of the
evidentiary objections. “Whenever, under any law of this state or under any rule,
regulation, order or requirement made pursuant to the law of this state, any
matter is required or permitted to be supported, evidenced, established, or
proved by the sworn statement, declaration, verification, certificate, oath, or
affidavit, in writing of the person making the same (other than a deposition,
or an oath of office, or an oath required to be taken before a specified
official other than a notary public), such matter may with like force and
effect be supported, evidenced, established or proved by the unsworn statement,
declaration, verification, or certificate, in writing of such person which
recites that it is certified or declared by him or her to be true under penalty
of perjury, is subscribed by him or her, and (1), if executed within this
state, states the date and place of execution, or (2), if executed at any
place, within or without this state, states the date of execution and that it
is so certified or declared under the laws of the State of California.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
2015.5.) The declarations of Joshua Legere, Leepi Shimkhada, and
Jessica Neighbors, lack any indication of the execution within the state of
California, or a location outside of California, yet in compliance with
California law. The declarations are therefore in violation of Code of Civil
Procedure section 2015.5, and cannot be presented as evidence in support of the
motion for summary adjudication. (Kulshrestha v. First Union
Commercial Corp. (2004) 33 Cal.4th
601, 618.) The court otherwise finds the witnesses and counsel qualified to
testify. (Roy Brothers Drilling Co. v.
Jones (1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 175, 182.) The separate statement in support of the motion also
lacks any citation to the source of the purported undisputed statements. (Cal.
Rules Ct., rule 3.1350(d)(3).) The purpose of the separate statement is to
apprize all parties of the issues and to permit the trial court to determine
the existence of disputed facts. (Parkview Villas Assn., Inc. v. State Farm Fire & Casualty Co. (2005) 133
Cal.App.4th 1197, 1210.)  County made no attempt to correct the declarations following the
submission of the objections. The court therefore need not consider any
prejudice to Plaintiff in responding to any subsequently corrected
declarations. (Wall
Street Network, Ltd. v. New York Times Co. (2008)
164 Cal.App.4th 1171, 1182-1183; Plenger
v. Alza Corp. (1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 349,
362 (footnote 8); Weiss v. Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. (1988) 204 Cal.App.3d 1094, 1098.)  The court finds the defective
separate statement and inadmissible declarations precludes the consideration of
any and all relied upon evidence, and therefore a finding of a failure to shift
the burden as part of a motion for summary judgment/summary adjudication. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (d), (p)(2).)  The motion for summary judgment and summary
adjudication is therefore denied on this basis.  Even if the court considered the declarations, however, the court
alternatively finds triable issues of material fact. The court addresses the
individual claim.  2nd Cause of Action: Harassment in Violation
of Government Code 12940, et seq.Assuming the court considers the actual presented
declarations and certain content, the court is presented with a challenge to
the claims for harassment on grounds of “sex/gender, disability/perceived
disability, and engagement in protected activities.” [Comp., ¶ 38.] Legere
presents a very factually descriptive challenge. Legere
represents Plaintiff was terminated as a result of poor work performance during
the probationary period for the first six months of employment. Legere
documents the following course of action. On December 5, 2019, three days after
commencing employment, Plaintiff failed to appear for work. Plaintiff insisted
on working from home via telecommuting on a non-assigned telework day, and
without approval of any supervisor. On December 13, 2019, Plaintiff again
failed to appear for work without notice, and again expressed intention to
telework without approval. On December 16, 2019, the telework policy was
cancelled for all staff members of the unit. Plaintiff left work early on
December 18, 2019, and proceeded to telework notwithstanding the cancellation
of the policy. On February 7, 10, 11, and 12, 2020, Plaintiff was absent
without excuse, and proceeded to telework four of the six days. On February 13,
2020, Legere and supervisor Shimkhada met with Plaintiff regarding unexcused
absences and the cancellation of the telecommuting policy. Plaintiff left work
early on February 18, 2020, and failed to appear at all on February 20, 2020,
again only telecommuting. For the time period of February 1 through February
20, 2020, Plaintiff submitted a falsified timecard maintaining full workdays.
Plaintiff then represented sending e-mails requesting approval, none of which
were located by any e-mail server. [Declaration of Joshua Legere.] At the
time of the six-month review period at the end of the probationary period,
Legere gave Plaintiff an “Unsatisfactory” performance evaluation. In addition
to the absences, the evaluation further noted that Plaintiff failed to complete
substantive number of requirements for a certain assigned work project. [Leger
Decl., Ex. N.] In subsequent deposition, Plaintiff admitted to no work
restrictions and only requested teleworking possibly due to office noise
levels. Plaintiff was in fact offered noise cancelling headphones and/or a
voluntarily transfer to another position, both of which were rejected.
Plaintiff then requested a service animal. County again requested medical
documentation, which was never provided. [Declaration of Jessica Neighbors, Ex.
B: Deposition of Carla Rice.] On the
failure to accommodate claim, the County of Los Angeles maintains work
coordinator, Alicia Maravilla, requested a medical note supporting the
requested accommodation. Plaintiff sent e-mails regarding purported visits to a
medical provider on December 23, 2019, and January 9, 2020, without any further
address of required accommodation. On February 24, 2020, Plaintiff provided a
note from Lindsay O’Shea, PhD, a psychotherapist, describing the basis of
treatment, but again lacking any requested accommodations or restrictions. Nothing
in the separate statement presents the location of this evidence. Even
considering the reference in the opposing separate statement which identifies
the deposition of Maravilla as the source of the representation, no declaration
from Defendant apparently incorporates any such deposition.  A
subsequent investigation of the probationary period by Civil Service
Representative Sonia Gutierrez recommended termination of Plaintiff for
violation of numerous county policies. The recommendation was approved, and
Plaintiff was terminated from employment on May 28, 2020 for all documented
reasons: 1) Plaintiff failed to notify her supervisors regarding her
absences and had unscheduled absences on February 18 and 19, 2020, for which
Plaintiff falsified an email from Mr. Legere; 2) Plaintiff did not attend work
at her assigned work location and teleworked without prior authorization on
December 5, 2019; 3) Plaintiff did not attend work at her assigned work
location and teleworked without prior authorization on December 13, 2019; 4)
Plaintiff refused to follow supervisor instructions and teleworked on December
18, 2019 without prior authorization; 5) Plaintiff refused to follow supervisor
instructions and had unscheduled absences between February 6-10, 2019; and 6)
Plaintiff had an unscheduled absence, refused to follow supervisor instruction,
and teleworked without authorization on February 11 and 12, 2020; and, 7)
Plaintiff falsified timecards. [Neighbors Decl., Ex. F: Deposition of Sonia
Gutierrez.] Legere
challenges the purported statements both alleged in the operative complaint and
in discovery, whereby Legere purported referred to female employees as “1)
bitches; 2.) hacks; 3.) cunts; and 4.) useless.” Plaintiff additionally
maintains the following statements regarding other women in in the office, but
not necessarily directed at Plaintiff: “She is a grifter and her husband is a
worthless cuck. She is dependent on DHS’ money because he [her husband] has one
foot in the grave. He was a big shot in radio now she’s the breadwinner haha.
Have you been to her office? She is a total hack, a grifter. We should not have
a contract with that crazy bitch, I’ve been telling the higher ups for years.”
“I hope you’re here to work because if I have to sit next to one more worthless
woman yapping on the phone and shopping all day I am going to lose my shit.”
“She is only here because we are stuck with her over a bullshit workman’s comp.
claim. She leaves for hours everyday and shops. She’s worthless.” “How can you stand
walking in their office? It’s mindboggling. Vicki has food piled to the ceiling
and all they do is complain all day. Eat and complain. Eat and complain. The
hen house haha.” “Those women sit around and look for reasons to throw parties
and here you are with a cupcake. What’s today’s celebration? Are you going to
eat that?” Finally, direct comments made to Plaintiff, include: “Why are you
wearing high heels to work? Are you not aware of your surroundings? We work on
skid row and literally walk in shit every day. Ridiculous.” Plaintiff also
maintains that Legere accused Plaintiff of “faking” any and all claimed
disability and forged the doctor’s(’s) note(s). Finally described Plaintiff as
“unfit, crazy and useless.” The comments were repeated every week. Even
conceding to the potential veracity of the statements, Legere still maintains a
lack of evidence establishing a direct nexus between the purported statements
and the employment termination at the end of the probationary period. [Legere
Decl.] “The
specific elements of a prima facie case [for discrimination] may vary depending
on the particular facts. (Citation) Generally,
the plaintiff must provide evidence that (1) [s]he was a member of a protected
class, (2) [s]he was qualified for the position he sought or was performing
competently in the position he held, (3) [s]he suffered an adverse employment
action, such as termination, demotion, or denial of an available job, and (4)
some other circumstance suggests discriminatory motive.” (Guz v. Bechtel Nat. Inc. (2000) 24
Cal.4th 317, 355.) “‘Workplace harassment between opposite genders, including
words with sexual content or connotations, does not automatically establish
sexual discrimination. “‘[W]orkplace harassment, even harassment between men
and women, is [not] automatically discrimination because of sex merely because
the words used have sexual content or connotations.’ (Citatino.) Rather, ‘”[t]he critical
issue ... is whether members of one sex are exposed to disadvantageous terms or
conditions of employment to which members of the other sex are not exposed.”’ (Citations).) This means a
plaintiff in a sexual harassment suit must show ‘the conduct at issue was not
merely tinged with offensive sexual connotations, but actually constituted “discrimina [tion ] ... because of ...
sex.”’” (Lyle v. Warner Brothers
Television Productions (2006) 38 Cal.4th 264, 279–280.) Disability
discrimination requires a plaintiff show she “(1) suffered from a disability, (2)
could perform the essential duties of a job with or without reasonable
accommodation, and (3) was subjected to an adverse employment action because of the disability or
perceived disability.
(Citation.)
To establish a prima
facie case, the
employee must show ‘actions taken by the employer from which one can infer, if
such actions remain unexplained, that it is more likely than not that such
actions were “based on a [prohibited] discriminatory criterion ....”’ (Citation.)
The employee's burden of proving a prima facie case is not onerous, and very
little evidence is required at this step.” (Zamora
v. Security Industry Specialists, Inc.
(2021) 71 Cal.App.5th 1, 37 [internal quotation marks omitted].) The deposition of Rice specifically represents both
notifying and engaging the interactive process regarding certain psychological
trauma and the requirement for accommodation. Plaintiff in fact provided
medical records. Plaintiff maintains the only option presented was a transfer
from the unit. Plaintiff maintains the ability to perform all job duties
otherwise, and requested a telecommuting accommodation in order to avoid the
environment created at the office and resulting stress. Plaintiff also denies
any reasonable consideration of the service animal request. The court declines to find as a matter of law that the
interactive process was sufficient and Plaintiff reasonably accommodated for
purposes of the summary judgment, and Plaintiff was only terminated as a result
of workplace rule violations. (Zamora v. Security Industry Specialists, Inc. (2021) 71 Cal.App.5th at pp. 54-55.) The tangled claims and lack
of clarity in the motion also renders triable issues of material fact on the
gender discrimination claim. The court therefore denies the motion for
summary judgment/summary adjudication on the disability and gender
discrimination claims, though given both claims are pled within the same cause
of action, the court only need address one of the two claims to deny the
motion.  Legere to give notice.
