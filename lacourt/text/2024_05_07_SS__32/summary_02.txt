And here is a brief summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the motion to contest the good faith settlement between the plaintiff and the cross-defendants is denied. The plaintiff, Mazen Khalil, alleged that the defendants, including Jack Schneider and Ever Morales, were negligent in a motor vehicle accident. The cross-defendants entered into a settlement agreement with the plaintiff for $15,000, but the defendant, Jack Schneider, objected that the settlement was not made in good faith. The Judge found that the settlement amount was roughly only 4% of the plaintiff's total damages and that the cross-defendants had offered the policy limits of their only insurance and had no other assets, which is consistent with the court's previous ruling in Schmid v. Superior Court. The Judge also noted that the plaintiff had not provided a value for general damages and that discovery was still pending.
