**Significant Statements**

* "The attorney's possession of confidential information will be presumed only when 'a substantial relationship has been shown to exist between the former representation and the current representation, and when it appears by virtue of the nature of the former representation or the relationship of the attorney to his former client confidential information material to the current dispute would normally have been imparted to the attorney . . . .'" (H.F. Ahmanson & Co., supra, 229 Cal.App.3d at 1454)
* "Whether disqualification of the entire firm is automatic is an open question." (California Self-Insurers' Security Fund, supra, 19 Cal.App.5th at 1077)
* "The Court finds that a substantial relationship exists between this matter and Graham's prior cases representing Defendant. Graham previously represented Defendant in automobile/personal injury cases similar to this case, obtaining knowledge about Lyft's application. Additionally, Plaintiff does not dispute that Graham had communications with Defendant's in-house counsel regarding defense strategies and information specific to car accident cases such as this one."
