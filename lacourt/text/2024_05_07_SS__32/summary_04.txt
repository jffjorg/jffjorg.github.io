And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's motion to set aside the dismissal of the complaint. The plaintiff, Ashorina Youhanna, filed a complaint against Charlotte LaBarre and Does 1 to 10 for negligence related to a motor vehicle accident. The complaint was dismissed due to the plaintiff's failure to appear for trial on October 26, 2023. The plaintiff filed a motion to set aside the dismissal on February 21, 2024, citing an attorney's mistake and excusable neglect. The court finds that the plaintiff's counsel's calendaring error caused the failure to appear for trial, making the failure excusable. Therefore, the motion to set aside the dismissal is granted. The matter is set for an Order to Show Cause Re Monetary Sanctions or Dismissal for Failure to Serve on June 24, 2024.
