22STCV14201




MOTIONS:  


Motion
  to Set Aside Dismissal 




MOVING PARTY:


Plaintiff Ashorina Youhanna




OPPOSING PARTY:


None



 
BACKGROUND
 
On April 28, 2022, Plaintiff Ashorina Youhanna (Plaintiff) filed a
complaint against Defendants Charlotte LaBarre and Does 1 to 10 for negligence
related to a motor vehicle accident.  
 
On October 26, 2023, the case was called for trial and there were no
appearances. As a result, the Court dismissed the complaint filed by Plaintiff
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 581(b)(3). (Min. Order, 10/26/23.) 
 
On February 21, 2024, Plaintiff filed this motion to set aside the
dismissal pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 473(b). 
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
Under Code
of Civil Procedure section 473(b), the Court may relieve a party from a
dismissal taken against him through his mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or
excusable neglect.  This application must
be filed no more than six months after entry of the order from which relief is
sought, and must contain an affidavit of fault demonstrating the moving party’s
mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. 
 
A mistake
is a basis for relief under section 473 when by reason of the mistake a party
failed to make a timely response.  Surprise occurs when a party is
unexpectedly placed in a position to his injury without any negligence of his
own. Excusable neglect is a basis for relief when the party has shown some
reasonable excuse for the default.  (Credit Managers Association of
California v. National Independent Business Alliance (1984) 162 Cal.App.3d
1166, 1173; Davis v. Thayer (1980) 113 Cal.App.3d 892, 905.)  Under
Code of Civil Procedure section 473, the moving party bears the burden of
demonstrating an excusable ground, such as fraud or mistake, justifying a
court’s vacating a judgment.  (Basinger v. Roger & Wells (1990)
220 Cal.App.3d 16, 23–24.)   
 
Relief under
this section is mandatory when based on an attorney affidavit of fault;
otherwise, it is discretionary. (Id.) However mandatory relief is only
available when a party fails to oppose a dismissal motion (“which are
procedurally equivalent to a default”). (Leader v. Health Industries of America, Inc. (2001) 89
Cal.App.4th 603, 620.) The mandatory relief provision
does not apply to dismissals for “failure to prosecute [citations omitted], dismissals
for failure to serve a complaint within three years [citations omitted],
dismissals based on running of the statute of limitations [citations omitted],
and voluntary dismissals entered pursuant to settlement [citations omitted].”
(Id.) 
 
DISCUSSION
 
            As
an initial matter, this motion is timely since it was brought within six months
after the complaint was dismissed. The Declaration of Brian L. Larsen,
Plaintiff’s counsel, states that he failed to calendar the October 26, 2023
trial date, and as a result did not appear. (Larsen Decl. ¶ 5.) Counsel declares:
“I assume full responsibility for my mistake and apologize to the court for not
timely serving said complaint and failing to properly calendar and appear at
trial on October 26, 2023. Plaintiff is not in any way responsible for my
failure to calendar and appear at trial on October 26, 2022, and thus should
not be prejudiced with the dismissal of the entire action.” (Id. ¶ 6.) A calendaring
error constitutes excusable neglect. (Nilsson v. City of Los Angeles
(1967) 249 Cal.App.2d 976, 980.)  
 
Therefore, because a calendaring error
caused Plaintiff’s counsel to not appear for trial, the motion to set aside the
dismissal entered on October 26, 2023, is granted. 
             
CONCLUSION AND
ORDER
 
Accordingly, the Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion to set aside the dismissal.
The matter is set for an Order to Show Cause Re Monetary Sanctions or Dismissal
for Failure to Serve for June 24, 2024 at 8:30 a.m. in Department 32 of the
Spring Street Courthouse.
 
Plaintiff to provide notice and file a proof of service of such.
