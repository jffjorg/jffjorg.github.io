And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

**Tentative Ruling**

The court has ruled in favor of the plaintiff, Jane Doe K.B., dismissing the defendant's demurrer to the complaint. The defendant argued that the plaintiff's claims were barred due to failure to present a claim within the required timeframe, and that Section 340.1 of the California Code of Civil Procedure, which revived previously barred causes of action, was an unlawful gift. The court rejected these arguments, finding that the statute was intended to revive causes of action previously barred by government claims presentation requirements, and that it did not create a new basis for liability. The court also rejected the defendant's argument that the plaintiff's third, fifth, and sixth causes of action were duplicative. The defendant is ordered to file an answer within 10 days of the ruling.
