The judge denies the plaintiff's request for default judgment against Nix Global, Inc. and Cathy Cho. The reasons for the denial include:

* The name of the defendant (Cathy vs. Kathy) must be corrected
* The plaintiff must provide a declaration as to the military status of the defendants
* The interest computations must be corrected
* The plaintiff must provide evidence of the date of breach
* The plaintiff must provide a declaration as to the military status of the defendants

The judge orders the plaintiff to file additional papers that resolve these issues and sets a new date for the hearing.
