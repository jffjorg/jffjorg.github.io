And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is issuing a tentative ruling in a motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories in a case involving a plaintiff who purchased a defective 2021 Chevrolet Silverado 1500. The defendant has served unverified responses to the special interrogatories, and the plaintiff argues that they are filled with improper boilerplate objections and are deficient. The parties have met and conferred, but it appears that they were not aware of the Court's Lemon Law discovery order at the time. The judge orders the parties to meet and confer again based on the discovery order and to file a joint statement of remaining issues. The joint statement should describe the matters in dispute, followed by the plaintiff's arguments and then the defendant's arguments. The judge also orders the parties to review the Court's discovery order and to refer to it prior to meeting and conferring.
