And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted a motion for relief from dismissal filed by plaintiffs Yolanda Isabel Alejos and Jesus Velez. The plaintiffs had filed a personal injury action on November 16, 2022, and the defendant was served on October 26, 2023. However, the plaintiffs failed to appear at two scheduled Case Management Conferences, resulting in the action being dismissed on February 9, 2024. The plaintiffs' counsel claimed that the failure to appear was due to calendaring errors. The judge found that the blame for not appearing lies with the plaintiffs' counsel and that the motion for relief from dismissal was properly filed and timely. Therefore, the judge granted the motion and set a new date for the Case Management Conference at the hearing on this motion.
