Here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling denies the plaintiff's motion to amend the complaint. The plaintiff seeks to add a new defendant, Kathy Attai, a cause of action for negligence, and a new prayer for relief. The plaintiff claims that the homeowners' association failed to timely investigate and repair water damage to his condominium unit. The judge finds that the plaintiff's declaration in support of the motion does not satisfy the requirements of California Rules of Court Rule 3.1324, and therefore denies the motion.
