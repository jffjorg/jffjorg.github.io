And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the claimant's motion to compel responses to discovery requests, including form interrogatories, demand for production of documents, and special interrogatories. The respondent, Mitch Kalcheim, failed to respond to the discovery requests despite being served on January 23, 2023, and the deadline for response passed on February 24, 2023. As a result, the judge concludes that Kalcheim waived all objections to the discovery requests and orders him to serve responses without objections by December 1, 2023.

The judge also awarded monetary sanctions in the amount of $2,400 in favor of the claimant and against Kalcheim. The sanctions were awarded because Kalcheim failed to respond within the time required under the law. The judge determined the reasonable hourly rate for the claimant's counsel to be $400, but reduced the number of hours spent on preparing the motions to compel from 15 hours to 6 hours.
