 Case Number:  21SMCV02005    Hearing Date:   November 9, 2023    Dept:  205    Superior Court of California County of Los Angeles – West District  Beverly Hills Courthouse / Department 205   SM 10000 PROPERTY, LLC,    Plaintiff, v.  JUSTIN LIGERI, CHEYENNE BRANDS, LLC and CRISTINA PECCI,   Defendants.    Case No.:  21SMCV02005     Hearing Date:  November 9, 2023   [TENTATIVE] ORDER RE:   PLAINTIFF’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY    JUDGMENT AGAINST DEFENDANTS    JUSTIN LIGERI AND CRISTINA PECCI    This case arises from a landlord tenant dispute.  Plaintiff SM 10000 owns property located at 10000 Santa Monica Boulevard, Unit 3403, Los Angeles, California (the “Property”).  Plaintiff entered into a one-year lease agreement (“Lease”) with Defendants Justin Ligeri, Christina Pecci and Cheyenne Brands LLC to rent the Property.  The parties then entered into a second six month Lease to rent the Property.  Following the termination of the six month lease, the Lease would continue on a month-to-month basis.  Defendants have not paid a full month’s rent since August 2, 2020.  Defendants finally vacated the Property on February 9, 2023.   This hearing is on Plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment on its sole claim for breach of contract.   Plaintiff’s separate statement is defective.  In motions for summary judgment or adjudication, “all material facts must be set forth in the separate statement. This is the Golden Rule of Summary Adjudication: if it is not set forth in the separate statement, it does not exist. [Citation.]  Thus, when the ‘fact’ is not mentioned in the separate statement, it is irrelevant that such fact might be buried in the mound of paperwork filed with the court, because the statutory purposes are not furthered by unhighlighted facts.”  (North Coast Business Park v. Nielsen Construction Co. (1993) 17 Cal.App.4th 22, 30–31.)   Plaintiff’s separate statement fails to address one of the key elements of a breach of contract claim – that Plaintiff has fully performed its obligations under the Lease.  Additionally, the separate statement does not specify the amount of damages, pre-judgment interest or attorneys’ fees it is seeking or how those amounts are calculated.  Accordingly, the Court denies the motion for summary judgment without prejudice.        DATED:  November 9, 2023    ___________________________ Edward B.
