And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling is about a landlord-tenant dispute between SM 10000 PROPERTY, LLC (the plaintiff) and Justin Ligeri, Cheyenne Brands, LLC, and Cristina Pecci (the defendants). The dispute arose from a breach of contract claim, as the defendants failed to pay rent since August 2, 2020, and vacated the property on February 9, 2023. The plaintiff filed a motion for summary judgment, but the separate statement submitted by the plaintiff is defective, failing to address key elements of the breach of contract claim and specifying the amount of damages, pre-judgment interest, or attorneys' fees. The court denies the motion for summary judgment without prejudice.
