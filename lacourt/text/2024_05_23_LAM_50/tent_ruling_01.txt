  CENTER STREET LENDING CORPORATION AND CENTER STREET LENDING FUND IV SPE,
  LLC’S DEMURRER TO PLAINTIFF’S FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT; 
 
DEFENDANTS
  CENTER STREET LENDING CORPORATION AND CENTER STREET LENDING FUND IV SPE,
  LLC’S MOTION TO STRIKE PORTIONS OF PLAINTIFF’S FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT
 



 
Background
Plaintiff Denise Wheeler (“Plaintiff”) filed this action on September
21, 2023 against Defendant Center Street Lending Corporation. 
Plaintiff filed the operative First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) on
January 8, 2024 against Defendants Center Street Lending Corporation and Center
Street Lending Fund IV SPE, LLC (jointly, “Defendants”). The FAC alleges causes
of action for (1) violation of Civil Code section
2923.55 and (2) violation of Business and
Professions Code section 17200, et seq. 
Defendants now demur to both of the causes of action of the FAC.
Defendants also move to strike portions of the FAC. Plaintiff filed oppositions
to the demurrer and motion to strike.  
Requests for Judicial Notice 
The Court grants Defendants’ request for judicial notice. The Court
also grants Plaintiff’s request for judicial notice. 
Demurrer 
A.    Legal Standard  
A demurrer can be used
only to challenge defects that appear on the face of the pleading under attack
or from matters outside the pleading that are judicially noticeable. ((Blank
v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311,
318.) “To survive a demurrer, the
complaint need only allege facts sufficient to state a cause of action; each
evidentiary fact that might eventually form part of the plaintiff’s proof need
not be alleged.” ((C.A. v. William S. Hart
Union High School Dist. (2012) 53
Cal.4th 861, 872.) For the purpose of testing the
sufficiency of the cause of action, the demurrer admits the truth of all material facts properly pleaded. ((Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital Dist. (1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 966-967.) A demurrer “does not admit contentions, deductions or conclusions
of fact or law.” ((Daar v. Yellow Cab Co. (1967) 67 Cal.2d 695, 713.) 
B.    Allegations of the
FAC  
In the FAC, Plaintiff alleges that at all relevant times, she owned
the property located at 637 E 29th Street, Los Angeles California 90011 (the
“Property”). (FAC, ¶ 8.) Plaintiff alleges that “[t]he Property has been in
Plaintiff’s family since 1993, but she was not on title until August 2015. The [P]roperty
has served as her personal and principal residence for all times referenced herein.”
(FAC, ¶ 9.) “In mid-2015, a fire virtually destroyed most of the Property and
left it in severe disrepair. As a result, Plaintiff received insurance proceeds
to fix the Property. This is also when Plaintiff was put on title to the
Property.” (FAC, ¶ 10.)
            “On August 20, 2015, Plaintiff
received a ‘refinance’ from Defendant CENTER STREET in the amount of
$350,000.00.” (FAC, ¶ 11.) “In the loan origination process, Plaintiff was told
by CENTER STREET to use a different address for her personal residence.” (FAC,
¶ 12, emphasis omitted.) Plaintiff alleges that “CENTER STREET knew Plaintiff’s
only residence was the property but was told to use a different address to fund
the loan.” (FAC, ¶ 12.) “In February 2016, the loan came due, and Plaintiff was
unable to pay the balloon amount.” (FAC, ¶ 14.)
            “In September 2017, CENTER STREET
filed a Notice of Default. On December 26, 2017, CENTER STREET filed a Notice
of Trustee’s Sale.” (FAC, ¶ 15.) “On January 18, 2018, Plaintiff filed for
Chapter 11 Bankruptcy. Plaintiff made payments throughout the bankruptcy until
early 2023 when CENTER STREET filed a Motion for Relief from stay.” (FAC, ¶
16.) “The Bankruptcy court granted the Motion for Relief from stay and CENTER
STREET recorded a new Notice of Default on May 31, 2023.” (FAC, ¶ 17.) 
            Plaintiff alleges that “[o]n
September 5, 2023, Defendant recorded a Notice of Trustee’s Sale and set the
property for auction on October 3, 2023. Despite the fact that Defendant failed
to contact Plaintiff to ‘assess her financial situation and explore options to
avoid foreclosure’ as required by Civil Code 2923.55,
Defendant intends to proceed the sale [sic]…” (FAC, ¶ 19.)
C.    First and Second Causes of Action 
In the FAC, Plaintiff
alleges that “CENTER STREET LENDING FUND IV SPE, LLC…is a business
entity primarily in residential mortgage banking and/or related business and
was the beneficiary or servicer of Plaintiff’s loan during the operative time
period herein.” (FAC, ¶ 5.) Plaintiff also alleges that “CENTER STREET LENDING
CORPORATION…is a California stock corporation engaged primarily in residential
mortgage banking and/or related business and was the beneficiary or servicer of
Plaintiff’s loan during the operative time period herein.” (FAC, ¶ 6.)
In the demurrer, Defendants
first assert that “Plaintiff’s allegations fail as alleged against Defendants
because Defendants are not the current beneficiary of the loan.” (Demurrer at
p. 5:2-3.)[1] Defendants
cite to Exhibit “B” to their request for judicial notice, which is an
“Assignment of Beneficial Interest Under Deed of Trust” recorded on recorded on
August 31, 2015. (Defendants’ RJN, ¶ 2, Ex. B.) This Assignment provides, inter
alia, that “BY THIS ASSIGNMENT OF BENEFICIAL INTEREST UNDER DEED OF
TRUST…dated to be effective as of August 11, 2015, CENTER STREET LENDING
CORPORATION, a California Corporation (‘Assignor’)…does by these presents
grant, bargain, sell, assign, transfer and set over unto CENTER STREET LENDING
FUND IV SPE, LLC…all of Assignor’s right, title and interest as Beneficiary
under that certain Deed of Trust dated August 10, 2015 executed by Denise L.
Wheeler…” (Ibid.) 
Defendants also cite to Exhibit “G” to their request for judicial
notice, which is another “Assignment of Beneficial Interest Under Deed of
Trust” recorded on recorded on September 4, 2019. (Defendants’ RJN, ¶ 7, Ex.
G.) This Assignment provides, inter alia, that “BY THIS ASSIGNMENT OF
BENEFICIAL INTEREST UNDER DEED OF TRUST…dated to be effective as of August 1, Center
Street Lending Fund IV SPE, LLC, a Delaware Limited Liability Company
(‘Assignor’)…does by these presents grant, bargain, sell, assign, transfer and
set over unto Center Street Lending VIII SPE, LLC…all of Assignor’s right,
title and interest as Beneficiary under that certain Deed of Trust dated August
10, 2015 executed by Denise L. Wheeler…” (Ibid.)
In the opposition, Plaintiff counters that “Defendants do not dispute
that either is the servicer of the loan. Since liability under Civil Code § 292.55 [sic] also applies to mortgage
servicers, Plaintiff’s allegations do not fail despite the beneficial interest
in the Deed of Trust having been transferred in September 2019 to Center Street
VIII.” (Opp’n at p. 4:6-9.) Indeed, Civil Code section
2923.55,
subdivision (a) provides that “[a] mortgage servicer, mortgagee, trustee, beneficiary, or
authorized agent shall not record a notice of default pursuant to Section 2924 until all of the following: (1) The mortgage servicer has satisfied the requirements of paragraph
(1) of subdivision (b).
(2) Either 30 days after initial contact is made as required by
paragraph (2) of subdivision (b) or 30 days after satisfying the due diligence
requirements as described in subdivision (f). (3) The mortgage servicer complies with
subdivision (c) of Section 2923.6, if the borrower
has provided a complete application as defined in subdivision (h) of Section 2923.6.” (Emphasis added.) 
Based on the foregoing,
the Court does not find that Defendants have demonstrated that Plaintiff’s
allegations fail “because Defendants are not the current beneficiary of the
loan.” (Demurrer at p. 5:3-4.) 
D.    First Cause of Action for Violation of Civil
Code Section 2923.55
In the first cause of
action, Plaintiff alleges, inter alia, that “Defendant recorded
the NOD without sending the NOD to Plaintiff or contacting Plaintiff ‘in person
or by telephone’ to assess her financial situations and explore options to
avoid foreclosure. Additionally, the Notice of Trustee’s Sale…also fails to
include the above required declaration and is not appropriately executed, thus
Defendants violated Cal. Civ. Code§ 2923.55.”
(FAC, ¶ 23.) Plaintiff alleges that “[s]ince Defendant also failed to notify or
correspond with Plaintiff in writing concerning her options regarding the NOD
and alleged default, Defendants recorded the NOD in violation of Cal. Civ. Code § 2923.55.” (FAC, ¶ 24.) 
In the demurrer, Defendants argue that “Plaintiff does not allege
facts showing that Defendants are subject to Section
2923.55.” (Demurrer at p. 5:24-25.) Defendants note that Civil Code section 2923.55, subdivision (g) provides that “[t]his section shall not apply to entities described in
subdivision (b) of Section 2924.18.” 
Civil Code section 2924.18,
subdivision (b) provides that “[t]his
section shall apply only to a depository institution chartered under state or
federal law, a person licensed pursuant to Division 9 (commencing with Section 22000) or Division 20 (commencing with Section 50000) of the Financial Code, or a person
licensed pursuant to Part 1 (commencing with Section
10000) of Division 4 of the Business and Professions Code, that, during its
immediately preceding annual reporting period, as established with its primary
regulator, foreclosed on 175 or fewer residential real properties, containing
no more than four dwelling units, that are located in California.” In Billesbach v. Specialized Loan Servicing LLC (2021) 63 Cal.App.5th 830, 844, footnote 7, the Court of Appeal noted
that “Section
2923.55 generally applies only to larger
mortgage servicers. (See §§ 2923.55, subd. (g) [‘This
section shall not apply to entities described in subdivision (b) of Section
2924.18’], 2924.18, subd. (b) [describing certain entities who foreclosed on
175 or fewer residential properties in preceding year].).” 
 Defendants assert that “Plaintiff does
not allege any facts that indicate that Defendants are ‘larger mortgage
servicers’ subject to section 2923.55 or even make
a reference to publicly available information via the California Department of
Financial Protection and Innovation’s annually published report of entities
that have foreclosed on more than 175 homes in California during the prior
years. It follows that Plaintiff cannot pursue a claim against the Defendants
for an alleged violation of section 2923.55 and
this claim fails.” (Demurrer at p. 6:2-6.) 
In the opposition, Plaintiff asserts that “Defendant suggests that
each of Plaintiff’s claims fail because she has not alleged that Civil Code § 2924.18(b) does not apply. This is not
Plaintiff’s burden.” (Opp’n at p. 3, fn. 1.) Plaintiff cites to Casterson v.
Superior Court (2002) 101 Cal.App.4th 177, 183, where the Court of Appeal noted that “[a] general demurrer will lie
where the complaint has included allegations that clearly disclose some defense or bar to recovery. Thus, a demurrer based on an
affirmative defense will be sustained only where the face of the complaint
discloses that the action is necessarily barred by the defense.” (Internal
quotations, citation, and emphasis omitted.) Here, Defendants do not point to
allegations of the FAC demonstrating that Plaintiff’s first cause of action is
barred by Civil Code section 2923.55, subdivision (g). 
Next, Defendants assert that “the subject
business purpose loan is not covered by HBOR.” (Demurrer at p. 6:8.) Defendants
cite to Civil Code section 2923.55, subdivision (h), which provides that “[t]his section shall apply only to
mortgages or deeds of trust described in Section
2924.15.” 
Pursuant to Civil Code section 2924.15, subdivision (a)(1), “[u]nless otherwise provided, paragraph (5) of
subdivision (a) of Section 2924 and Sections
2923.5, 2923.55, 2923.6, 2923.7, 2924.9, 2924.10, 2924.11,
and 2924.18 shall apply only to a first lien mortgage or deed of
trust that meets either of the following conditions: (1) (A) The first lien mortgage
or deed of trust is secured by owner-occupied residential real property
containing no more than four dwelling units. (B) For purposes of this
paragraph, ‘owner-occupied’ means that the property is the principal residence
of the borrower and is security for a loan made for personal, family, or
household purposes.” (Emphasis added.) 
Defendants assert that “on its face,
the DOT secures a business purpose loan.” (Demurrer at p. 6:25.) Defendants
cite to Exhibit “A” to Defendants’ request for judicial notice, which is a
“Deed of Trust, Security Agreement and Fixture Filing (With Assignment of Rents
and Leases)” recorded on August 20, 2015. (Defendants’ RJN, ¶ 1, Ex. A.) This
Deed of Trust provides, inter alia, that “This Deed of Trust, Security
Agreement and Fixture Filing (with Assignment of Rents and Leases) (‘Deed of
Trust’ or ‘Deed’) is made August 10, 2015, between Denise L. Wheeler, an unmarried
woman, herein called Trustor, whose address is 5750 Centinela Avenue #424, Los
Angeles, CA 90045, and Center Street Lending Corporation, a California
Corporation, herein called Beneficiary…” (Defendants’ RJN, ¶ 1, Ex. A, p. 1 [emphasis
omitted].) Defendants note that the Deed of Trust states that “[e]ach of the
following shall be considered an event of default of this Deed: a. Any Borrower
or Guarantor occupying 637 East 29th Street, Los Angeles, CA 90011 as their
residence…” (Defendants’ RJN, Ex. A, p. 3.) 
Defendants also assert that “in Plaintiff’s Bankruptcy filed in 2018,
Plaintiff certifies under penalty of perjury that she rents out the Subject
Property for profit.” (Demurrer at p. 6:27-28.) Defendants cite to, inter
alia, Exhibit I to their Request for Judicial Notice, which is a “Debtor’s
Post Confirmation Status Conference Report No. 1; Declaration of Denise Wheeler
in Support Thereof” filed in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Central District
of California in the matter In re: Denise Latrice Wheeler, Case No.
2:18-bk-10597, on April 30, 2020. (Defendants’ RJN, ¶ 9, Ex. I.) Exhibit I
provides, inter alia, that “Debtor also generates rental income from
rental property in the amount of $4,500 per month. The major assets of the
estate are: Debtor’s rental property located at 637 E. 29th Street, Los
Angeles, CA 90011 (the ‘Rental Property/Real Property’), two vehicles and other
personal assets.” (Defendants’ RJN, ¶ 9, Ex. I, p. 2.) 
In the opposition, Plaintiff counters that “the loan at issue was
clearly a loan for personal, family, or household purposes.” (Opp’n at p.
5:15-16.) Plaintiff argues that “the purpose of the debt was straightforward.
Plaintiff’s family has owned the home 1993, and Plaintiff has lived in the home
for decades. In mid-2015, a fire virtually destroyed most of the Property and
left it in severe disrepair. Thereafter, title to the Property was put in
Plaintiff’s name, and Plaintiff received insurance proceeds to fix the Property
that she has lived in so that she could continuing [sic] living there.” (Opp’n
at p. 5:16-21, emphasis omitted.) As discussed above, the FAC alleges that
“[i]n mid-2015, a fire virtually destroyed most of the Property and left it in
severe disrepair. As a result, Plaintiff received insurance proceeds to fix the
Property.” (FAC, ¶ 10.) Plaintiff points to paragraph 9
of the FAC, which alleges that “[t]he Property has been in Plaintiff’s
family since 1993, but she was not on title until August 2015. The property has
served as her personal and principal residence for all times referenced
herein.” (FAC, ¶ 9.) However, the FAC does not appear to expressly allege that
the subject property “is security for a loan made for
personal, family, or household purposes…” (Civ. Code § 2924.15, subd. (a)(1)(B).) 
Defendants also assert that “the subject property was not
owner-occupied at the time of the alleged violation.” (Demurrer at p. 7:10-11.)
As set forth above, Civil Code section 2924.15,
subdivision (a)(1) provides that “[u]nless otherwise
provided, paragraph (5) of subdivision (a) of Section
2924 and Sections 2923.5, 2923.55, 2923.6, 2923.7,
2924.9, 2924.10, 2924.11, and 2924.18 shall apply only to a first lien
mortgage or deed of trust that meets either of the following conditions: (1)(A) The first lien mortgage or deed of trust is secured by owner-occupied
residential real property containing no more than four dwelling units. (B) For purposes
of this paragraph, ‘owner-occupied’ means that the property is the
principal residence of the borrower and is security for a loan made for
personal, family, or household purposes.” (Emphasis added.) 
Defendants assert that “Plaintiff
cannot substantiate that the Property is her ‘principal residence’ as required
by Civil Code section 2924.15 (a)(1) and as she
now claims in her FAC.” (Demurrer at p. 8:5-6.) Defendants cite to Exhibit E to their request for judicial notice,
which is a “Voluntary Petition for Individuals Filing for
Bankruptcy” filed in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Central District of
California in the matter In re: Denise Latrice Wheeler, Case No.
2:18-bk-10597 on January 18, 2018. (Defendants’ RJN, ¶ 5, Ex. E.) Defendants
note that page 2 of the Petition states, inter alia, “1191 1/2 West 38th
Street Los Angeles, CA 90037” after “Where you live.” (Defendants’ RJN, ¶ 5,
Ex. E, p. 2.) Defendants also cite to Exhibit U to their request for judicial
notice, which is a “Declaration of Lionel E. Giron in Support of Application
for Compensation for Law Offices of Lionel E. Giron Period January 2, 2019
through April 18, 2023” filed in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Central
District of California, in the matter In re: Denise Latrice Wheeler,
Case No. 2:18-bk-10597 on May 23, 2023. (Defendants’ RJN, ¶ 21, Ex. U.) Defendants
note that Exhibit U states, inter alia, “[o]n April 19, 2023 my office
served a copy of the Application for Compensation to Mrs. Wheeler at 1191 ½
West 38th Street, Los Angeles, CA 90037.” (Defendants’ RJN, ¶ 21, Ex. U, ¶ 5.) 
Defendants cite to Cantu v. Resolution Trust Corp. (1992) 4 Cal.App.4th
857, 877-878, where the Court of Appeal noted that “[b]oth trial and appellate
courts may properly take judicial notice of a party’s earlier pleadings and
positions as well as established facts from both the same case and other cases. The complaint should be
read as containing the judicially noticeable facts, even when the
pleading contains an express allegation to the contrary. A plaintiff may not avoid a
demurrer by pleading facts or positions in an amended complaint that contradict
the facts pleaded in the original complaint or by suppressing facts which prove
the pleaded facts false. Likewise, the plaintiff may not plead facts that contradict the facts or positions that
the plaintiff pleaded in earlier actions or suppress facts that prove the
pleaded facts false. The principle is that of truthful pleading. When the plaintiff pleads inconsistently in separate actions, the plaintiff’s complaint is nothing more than a sham that seeks
to avoid the effect of a demurrer. Under such circumstances,
the court will disregard the falsely pleaded facts and affirm the demurrer.”
(Internal quotations, citations, and emphasis omitted.) 
In the opposition, Plaintiff asserts that “the property was owner
occupied when the notice of default was recorded.” (Opp’n at p. 6:1-2.) But in
support of this assertion, Plaintiff appears to solely cite to exhibits
attached to her request for judicial notice. Plaintiff does not appear to cite
any allegations of the FAC stating that the subject property was “owner
occupied” when the notice of default was allegedly recorded. (See Opp’n
at pp. 6:1-7:7.) As set forth above, “[u]nless otherwise provided, paragraph (5) of subdivision (a) of Section 2924 and Sections
2923.5, 2923.55, 2923.6, 2923.7, 2924.9, 2924.10, 2924.11, and 2924.18
shall apply only to a first lien mortgage or deed of trust that meets either of
the following conditions: (1) (A) The first lien mortgage or deed of trust is secured by
owner-occupied residential real property containing no more than four dwelling
units.” (Civ. Code § 2924.15, subd. (a)(1)(A).) 
Based on the foregoing, the
Court sustains Defendants’ demurrer to the first cause of action of the FAC,
with leave to amend.[2] 
 
E.    
Second Cause of Action for Violation of Business and Professions Code Section 17200 et seq.
 
“The
UCL does not proscribe specific activities, but broadly prohibits any unlawful,
unfair or fraudulent business act or practice and unfair, deceptive, untrue or
misleading advertising. The UCL governs anti-competitive business practices as
well as injuries to consumers, and has as a major purpose the preservation of
fair business competition. By proscribing any unlawful business practice, section 17200 borrows violations of other laws and
treats them as unlawful practices that the unfair competition law makes
independently actionable. Because…section 17200 is written in the disjunctive, it establishes
three varieties of unfair competition—acts or practices which are unlawful, or
unfair, or fraudulent.” ((Puentes v. Wells Fargo Home Mortgage, Inc. (2008) 160 Cal.App.4th 638, 643-644
[internal quotations and citations omitted].) 
Defendants assert that “Plaintiff’s UCL cause of action relies on the
allegations in her first cause of action for violation of Civil Code section 2923.55. As shown above, this
cause of action fails.” (Demurrer at p. 10:5-7.) Indeed, in the second cause of
action, Plaintiff alleges that “Defendants’ conduct, as alleged above,
constitutes unlawful, unfair, and/or fraudulent business practices, as defined
in the California Business and Professions Code §
17200 et seq. California Business and Professions
Code § 17200 et seq. incorporates and provides a basis for enforcement of
violations of other statutes and laws and those violations as a business
practice…Specifically, Defendant’s violation of California
Civil Code § 2923.55 constitute unfair business practices in violation of California Business and Professions Code § 17200 et seq.”
(FAC, ¶¶ 30-31.)
In the opposition, Plaintiff asserts that “[s]ince Plaintiff has
sufficiently alleged their underlying claims, his [sic] claim for violation of Civil Code § 17200 [sic] is also sufficiently
alleged.” (Opp’n at p. 10:9-10.) As set forth above, the Court sustains
Defendants’ demurrer to the first cause of action of the FAC. 
Based on the foregoing, the Court sustains Defendants’ demurrer to the
second cause of action of the FAC, with leave to amend.[3] 
Motion to Strike 
A court may strike any “irrelevant,
false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading” or any part of
a pleading “not drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of this state, a
court rule, or an order of the court.” ((Code Civ.
Proc., § 436.) “The grounds for a motion to strike shall appear on the face
of the challenged pleading or from any matter of which the court is required to
take judicial notice.” ((Id., § 437.) 
Defendants move to strike paragraph 5 of Plaintiff’s “Prayer for
Damages,” which alleges, “[f]or exemplary damages in an amount sufficient to
punish Defendant’s wrongful conduct and deter future misconduct.” Defendants
assert that “nothing in the FAC warrants an award of exemplary damages.” (Mot.
at p. 4:2-3.) 
As an initial matter, as set forth above, the Court sustains
Defendants’ demurrer to the first and second causes of action of the FAC. In
addition, Plaintiff’s opposition to the motion to strike provides, inter
alia, that “Plaintiff submits this response to get into the record the true
facts of the case at hand and dispute Defendant’s incorrect recitation of
facts. However, Plaintiff does not oppose the request to strike exemplary
damages, found at Paragraph 5 of the Prayer for Damages on page 7, line 5.” (Opp’n
at p. 2:7-9.)
Based on the foregoing, the Court grants Defendants’ motion to strike,
without leave to amend. 
Conclusion 
Based on the
foregoing, the Court sustains Defendants’ demurrer to the first and second
causes of action of the FAC, with leave to amend. 
The Court grants
Defendants’ motion to strike, without leave to amend. 
The Court orders
Plaintiff to file and serve an amended complaint, if any, within 20 days of the
date of this order. If no amended complaint is filed within 20 days, the Court
orders Defendants to file and serve a proposed judgment of dismissal within 30
days of the date of this Order.¿¿¿ 
Defendants are ordered to give notice of this Order.
