[1]Defendants first
assert that “the Notice of Default attached to the FAC lists ‘Center Street
Lending VIII SPE, LLC’ as the beneficiary of the Loan.” (Demurrer at p. 5:7-9,
citing FAC, Ex. A.) The Court notes that the FAC alleges that “CENTER STREET recorded a new Notice of Default on May
31, 2023. (‘Exhibit A.’)…” (FAC, ¶ 17.) However, no exhibits are attached to
the FAC. 


[2]Accordingly, the
Court need not and does not address Defendants’ remaining arguments pertaining
to the first cause of action. 


[3]Plaintiff also
asserts that “Defendants completely fail to demur to Plaintiff’s claim for
violation of Business and Professions Code § 17200.”
(Opp’n at p. 10:11-12.) It is unclear why Plaintiff makes this argument.
Defendants’ demurrer concerns both the first and second causes of action of the
FAC. (See Notice of Demurrer at p. 3.) In addition, as discussed above,
the memorandum of points and authorities in support of the demurrer discusses
the second cause of action.
