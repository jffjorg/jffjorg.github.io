And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling from the judge states that the defendants' demurrer, which challenges the plaintiff's claims, does not address the first cause of action. The judge notes that the plaintiff's complaint (FAC) does not have any exhibits attached, including the notice of default mentioned in the complaint. The judge also questions why the plaintiff is making an argument about the defendants failing to demur to the claim for violation of Business and Professions Code ยง 17200, as the demurrer actually addresses both the first and second causes of action.
