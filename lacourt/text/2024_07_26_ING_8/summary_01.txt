And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment and has tentatively denied the Defendant's ex parte application to Continue the August 5, 2024 Trial. The judge found that there are triable issues of fact regarding the reasonableness of fees and the defense of quality of the representation. The judge noted that the Plaintiff failed to provide its work product until the eve of trial and that the Defendant did not seek alternative remedies, such as a motion to compel further production or a motion in limine, before filing the ex parte application. The judge also found that the Plaintiff's standing to sue is disputed and that there are issues regarding the assignment of rights from BM LLP to the Plaintiff. The judge concluded that a trial is necessary to resolve the disputed issues and that the Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment is denied.
