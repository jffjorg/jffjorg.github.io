And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by Defendant Carelon Behavioral Health of California, Inc. to the Plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint. The Plaintiff, Karin Friedman, alleges that the Defendant negligently selected and recommended Anthony Cavuoti as a therapist, who then engaged in inappropriate behavior during their initial meeting, including discussing his own personal history of childhood abuse and making veiled romantic overtures.

The Judge has sustained the demurrer with leave to amend, finding that the Plaintiff's Third Cause of Action for Negligent Selection of an Independent Contractor is defective because it lacks specific factual allegations that the Defendant knew or should have known about Cavuoti's alleged misconduct prior to hiring him. The Judge has ordered the Plaintiff to file a new amended complaint with twenty (20) days leave to amend.
