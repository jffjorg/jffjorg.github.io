Legal
Standard
California Code of
Civil Procedure §664.6(a) provides that, "If parties to pending litigation
stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties outside of the presence of the
court or orally before the court, for settlement of the case, . . . the court,
upon motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement."
Discussion
Plaintiff explains the
following:
In KC067825: On 01/12/2017, a Conditional
Stipulated Settlement Agreement (“Agreement”) was filed and signed by the
court. Defendant made payments towards the balance due, totaling $21,450.00.
The last payment Defendant made was on 12/15/2022. Since then, Defendant has
defaulted on the terms of the Agreement. As the terms of the Agreement allows
for entry of judgment in the principal amount of $60,619.89 (Boone Decl., p. 6
of 10 of PDF) by the court upon a showing Defendant’s failure to comply with
the terms of payment, the court enters judgment in the total amount of
$39,799.89 (damages of $60,619.89, less $21,450.00 (credits), and $630.00 in
costs. 
In KC068484: On 01/19/2017, a Conditional
Stipulated Settlement Agreement was entered. Defendant made payments towards
the balance due, totaling $14,020.00. The last payment Defendant made was on
11/15/2022. According to the default terms, Defendant agreed to judgment in the
full amount claimed in the complaint, less any amounts already paid under the
agreement. (See Boone Decl., p. 6 of 10 of PDF.) Therefore, Plaintiff is
requesting the pre-judgment amount of $39,802.53 plus court costs of $630.00,
minus credits of $14,020.00 totaling $26,412.53. 
Conclusion
Based on the
foregoing, both motions are granted.[1]
