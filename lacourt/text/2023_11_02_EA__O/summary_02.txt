And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion for leave to amend and relation back in a consolidated case (Case No. 21STCV02124). The motion was filed by Hi-Way, who claims that improper service upon a corporation and untimely Doe amendment justify the request. However, the judge is skeptical of Hi-Way's arguments and finds that the motion fails to provide a legal standard for the crux of the motion. The judge will focus on CCP sections 418.10 and Chapter 1.5 in determining the validity of the motion. The judge notes that Hi-Way's reply does not address the argument regarding untimely service and that the motion does not provide an affirmative factual showing of irreparable harm. The judge also finds that the plaintiffs have made a showing of prejudice and that the motion is therefore denied. Finally, the judge determines that service on August 10, 2023 was untimely for Soller and that a negligence claim against Hi-Way is time-barred.
