Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion to quash filed by Hi-Way Safety Rentals, Inc. The motion argues that the plaintiffs were not truly ignorant of Hi-Way's identity and failed to exercise reasonable diligence to discover it. The judge agrees with this argument and finds that the plaintiffs' amendments to the complaint do not relate back to the original complaint. The judge also finds that the plaintiffs' claims against Hi-Way are barred by the statute of limitations. The ruling is based on California Code of Civil Procedure sections 335.1, 418.10, 474, 583.210, and 583.250.
