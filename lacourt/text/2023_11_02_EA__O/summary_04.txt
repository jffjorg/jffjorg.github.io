And here is a summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses a motion to continue trial and grants the motion absent opposition. The judge will focus on COAs 1 through 7, as Defendant did not discuss the 8th COA. The ruling also addresses the merits of the FEHA claims and the PAGA claims, which will require further discovery. The judge notes that while harassment cases are rarely appropriate for disposition on summary judgment, it does not mean that all harassment cases are always inappropriate for disposition on a motion for summary judgment. The judge will consider the merits of the motion and address the PAGA claims, which concern a class of 1,300 employees.
