And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to vacate dismissal and enter judgment in two separate cases, KC067825 and KC068484. Both cases involve breach of contract and collection claims. In each case, the plaintiff entered into a conditional stipulated settlement agreement with the defendant, which allowed for entry of judgment if the defendant failed to comply with the terms of the agreement. The defendant made payments towards the balance due, but later defaulted on the terms of the agreement. The judge has entered judgment in the amount of $39,799.89 in KC067825 and $26,412.53 in KC068484, minus credits and costs.
