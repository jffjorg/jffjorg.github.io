[1] There is a
consolidated case (Case No. 21STCV02124). Additionally, much of the procedural
history has been omitted due to the numerous filings in this case. 


[2] According to the
motion, Hi-Way placed concrete barriers under the control and directions of the
property developer. 
 


[3] Hi-Way does not
provide a legal standard, thus it is unclear what statutes form the crux of the
motion. Considering the basis of the motion is improper service upon a
corporation and untimely Doe amendment, the court will focus on CCP sections
418.10 and Chapter 1.5. 


[4] Both Plaintiff and
Soller (collectively, “Plaintiffs” for purpose of this motion) advance the
argument regarding untimeliness. As noted by Hi-Way in Reply, California Rules
of Court, Rule 3.1202 requires that an ex-parte application provide an
“affirmative factual showing . . . of irreparable harm” such that immediate
attention is required. That a motion cannot be heard in 30 days would likely
not qualify for ex-parte relief. (Reply p. 3:16-26.) 


[5] See also General Motors Corp. v. Superior Court (1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 580, 588 [“[T]he relevant
inquiry when the plaintiff seeks to substitute a real defendant for one sued
fictitiously is what facts the plaintiff
actually knew at the time the original complaint
was filed.”]; see Hazel v. Hewlett (1988) 201 Cal.App.3d 1458,
1464-1465 [“A plaintiff must actually be ignorant of the facts giving
him a cause of action against a defendant. “Ignorance of the facts is
the critical issue....” [Citations.]’ [Citation.] ‘The pivotal question in this
regard is “did plaintiff know facts?” not “did plaintiff know or believe
that [he] had a cause of action based on those facts?” [Citation.]’
[Citation.], emphasis added.) 
 


[6] Both the original
complaint and FAC make seven references to “concrete barriers” and are found
within the same paragraphs.
 


[7] Further, Plaintiffs
have copies of the police report that mentions the K-rails. (Motion p. 10:8-9.)

 


[8] The Reply does not
address this argument, though the Motion inexplicitly discusses the matter.
(Motion p. 13:6-18.)   


[9] An unreasonably delay, with a showing
of prejudice, is also grounds for denying leave to amend and relation back
effect. (Motion p. 14, citing A.N. v. County of Los Angeles (2009) 171
Cal.App.4th 1058, 1067-1068.) (Both Plaintiffs address A.N.) As noted by
Plaintiffs, Hi-Way has not made a showing of prejudice. To the extent it
elaborates in Reply (Reply p. 10), not only is that a belated argument, but
merely states prejudice on the grounds of added litigation costs. 
 


[10] With a two-year statute of
limitations for negligence, two years from Pano. Jr’s original complaint April
22, 2020 is April 22, 2022, but Hi-Way was not personally served until August
10, 2023, a negligence COA against Hi-Way is time-barred. As for Soller, her
complaint was filed on January 19, 2021; two years from January 19, 2021 is
January 19, 2023, making service on August 10, 2023 untimely by about eight
months.
