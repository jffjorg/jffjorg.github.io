And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the moving papers and has made a tentative ruling. John Yu, one of the defendants, has filed a demurrer, which the court will continue to a later date to allow the plaintiff, Abby Ademe, to file an opposition. The court previously granted Uber's motion to compel arbitration, which stayed the entire action pending the outcome of arbitration. However, the court will issue an order modifying this stay to clarify that it only applies to the plaintiff's claims against Uber, and not to the claims against John Yu. The court will provide a date for the continued hearing on the demurrer at tomorrow's hearing.
