## English Summary:

The judge is considering a demurrer filed by Defendant John Yu.  The judge previously granted Uber Technologies, Inc.'s motion to compel arbitration, staying the case against Uber. However, the judge recognized that the original tentative ruling only stayed the case against Uber, while the subsequent minute order stayed the entire case.  

Therefore, the judge will modify the minute order to clarify that the stay applies only to Plaintiff Abby Ademe's claims against Uber, not against Yu. The hearing on Yu's demurrer will be continued to give Plaintiff an opportunity to file an opposition.
