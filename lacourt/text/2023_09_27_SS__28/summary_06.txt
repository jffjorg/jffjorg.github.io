And here is the English-text summary:

The Court's tentative ruling is as follows:

The Court has considered the documents submitted in support of default judgments and rules as follows. The plaintiffs, Mauricio Medina and Andrea Medina, have filed this action against the defendant, David Angel Card, for motor vehicle tort and general negligence. The defendant was served with summons and complaint, and the plaintiffs have filed proofs of service showing personal service on the defendant. The defendant's default was entered, and the plaintiffs have submitted a request for default judgment.

The Court finds that the plaintiffs must dismiss the Doe defendants or apply for separate judgment against them before the Court can grant default judgment. The Court also finds that the plaintiffs have not provided sufficient evidence to support their claims for general damages and that they must provide additional evidence to support their claims.

Finally, the Court finds that the amounts requested for costs are not allowable as costs under the applicable law and that the plaintiffs must revise the amounts requested for costs or explain why the cost amounts sought are recoverable.

The Court denies the applications for default judgment without prejudice and orders the plaintiffs to give notice of this ruling.
