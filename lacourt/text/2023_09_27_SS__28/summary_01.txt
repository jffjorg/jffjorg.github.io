**English Summary:**

This tentative ruling regards a petition by Chihling Wu to expedite approval of a minor's compromise on behalf of his daughter, Jiaxin Nien. The case stems from a motor vehicle accident where Helen Wang was the Plaintiff and Wu and Nien were Defendants.

The Court outlines requirements for expedited approval under California Rules of Court, rule 7.950.5, including ensuring all medical expenses are reimbursed.

The Court identifies discrepancies in the petition concerning the amount of medical expenses paid, reimbursed, and owed to lienholders. It also notes inconsistencies in the stated attorney's fees.

Therefore, the Court denies the petition without prejudice, requiring the petitioner to revise it to accurately reflect these figures and resolve outstanding liens before seeking approval.
