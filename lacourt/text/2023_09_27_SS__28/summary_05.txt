**English Text Summary:**

This tentative ruling by Judge [Name] addresses a motion by Defendant James Antonucci to contest a good faith settlement agreement between Plaintiff Maurice Adams and Defendant Sabine Obagi.  

The judge finds that Obagi's application for good faith settlement determination is insufficient because it lacks crucial information. Specifically, Obagi did not provide enough details about Plaintiff's total medical expenses, the potential liability of other parties involved in the accidents, or her own financial situation. 

The judge states that these omissions prevent a proper evaluation of the settlement amount under the "Tech-Bilt" factors, which require consideration of the settlor's proportionate liability and a comparison of the settlement amount to the potential total recovery. Since Antonucci has successfully demonstrated the insufficiency of Obagi's application, the judge denies the good faith settlement determination and grants Antonucci's motion to contest the settlement.

The judge has denied Sabine Obagi's application for good faith settlement determination and granted James Antonucci's motion to contest the good faith settlement. The court found that Obagi provided insufficient information to establish that the settlement with Maurice Adams was "in the ballpark" under the Tech-Bilt factors. Specifically, Obagi failed to provide evidence of the amount of medical specials, the potential liability of Antonucci, and her own financial situation or available insurance. The court concluded that Antonucci had carried his burden of proving that Obagi's application contained insufficient evidence to establish that the settlement was in good faith. The case is set for trial on October 4, 2023.

(Tech-Bilt, 38 Cal.3d at p. 499.)

Summary:
This tentative ruling is for a hearing on September 27, 2023 in Department 28 for case number 21STCV33264. The case involves Plaintiff Maurice Adams suing Defendants Sabine Obaji, James Antonucci, and Does 1-40 for negligence. Sadine Obaji filed an answer and cross-complaint against Antonucci and Does 1-50, and Antonucci filed a cross-complaint against Cross-Defendants Sabine Obaji and Moes 1-25. Obagi filed an application for determination of good faith settlement and Antonucci filed a motion to contest good faith settlement. The Court has considered the moving, opposition and reply papers and rules as follows.

The Court denies Obagi's application for determination of good faith settlement and grants Antonucci's motion to contest good faith settlement. The Court finds that Obagi's application for determination of good faith settlement contains insufficient evidence to establish that the settlement is "in the ballpark" for several reasons. First, Obagi did not provide sufficient information about Plaintiff's total recovery or her proportionate liability, which are required factors under Tech-Bilt. Second, Obagi did not discuss or provide evidence showing the potential liability of Antonucci or the driver in the April 2020 accident, which prevents the Court from considering the settlor's proportionate liability.

The Court also finds that Antonucci has carried his burden of proving that Obagi's application for determination of good faith settlement contains insufficient evidence for the reasons stated above. Therefore, the Court denies the application for good faith settlement and grants the motion to contest good faith settlement. The moving party is ordered to give notice of this ruling and file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court within five days.
