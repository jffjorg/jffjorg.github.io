And here is a summary in English text:

This tentative ruling is about a court hearing scheduled for September 27, 2023, regarding an application for determination of good faith settlement between Plaintiff Maurice Adams and Defendant Sabine Obagi. The court has considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers and ruled that Obagi's application for good faith settlement determination is denied. The court finds that Obagi has not provided sufficient evidence to establish that the settlement is "in the ballpark" as required by Tech-Bilt, Inc. v. Woodward-Clyde & Associates (1985). The court grants Antonucci's motion to contest good faith settlement and orders Obagi to give notice of this ruling and file proof of service with the court within five days.
