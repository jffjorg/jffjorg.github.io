And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the motion filed by the defendants, Southern California Gas Company and Jesus Garcia, to compel Maria Delsocorro Tello to attend a deposition. The defendants argue that the deponent failed to appear at a previously scheduled deposition and request that the court order her to comply with the deposition subpoena. The judge notes that the defendants cite California Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.480 as authority for their motion, which provides that a party seeking discovery from a non-party deponent may obtain discovery by oral deposition, written deposition, or deposition subpoena. The judge also notes that the defendants were required to serve notice of the motion in writing on the deponent, but the proof of service attached to the motion does not show service of any kind on the deponent. Therefore, the judge denies the motion.
