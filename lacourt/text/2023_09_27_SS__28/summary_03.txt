And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the moving, opposing, and reply papers and rules as follows. The case involves a motorcycle accident on the US-101 freeway in which the plaintiff, John Loy, was injured. The defendant, Elite Construction Equipment, LLC, argues that the plaintiff's own errors in riding his motorcycle caused his injuries. The plaintiff contends that Elite's negligence caused the accident.

The judge finds that the evidence presented by both parties creates triable issues of material fact that prevent the court from granting summary judgment. The plaintiff's expert, Lew Grill, opined that Elite's driver failed to exercise caution, failed to properly signal the lane change, and failed to leave adequate spacing between the Elite vehicle and nearby vehicles when making the lane change. The court denies the motion for summary judgment and sets the case for trial on August 1, 2024.
