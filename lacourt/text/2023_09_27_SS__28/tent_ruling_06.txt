LEGAL STANDARD 
A.      Default judgment 
“[With exceptions that do not apply here,] [a] party
seeking a default judgment on declarations must use mandatory Request for Entry
of Default (Application to Enter Default) (form CIV-100) . . . The following
must be included in the documents filed with the clerk: 
“(1)  Except in
unlawful detainer cases, a brief summary of the case identifying the parties
and the nature of plaintiff's claim; 
“(2) 
Declarations or other admissible evidence in support of the judgment
requested; 
“(3)  Interest
computations as necessary; 
“(4)  A
memorandum of costs and disbursements; 
“(5)  A
declaration of nonmilitary status for each defendant against whom judgment is
sought; 
“(6)  A proposed
form of judgment; 
“(7)  A
dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application
for separate judgment against specified parties under Code of Civil Procedure
section 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment; 
“(8)  Exhibits
as necessary; and 
“(9)  A request
for attorney fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.” 
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1800(a).) 
B.       Damages 
          On a request for default judgment, “[w]here a cause of
action is stated in the complaint, plaintiff merely needs to introduce evidence
establishing a prima facie case for damages.” 
(L. Edmon & C. Karnow, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before
Trial (Rutter 2023) ¶ 5:213.1, p. 5-56 (Cal. Practice Guide: Procedure), citing
Johnson v. Stanhiser (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 357, 361 [trial court erred
in applying preponderance of the evidence standard].) 
          The relief granted to a plaintiff upon entry of a
defendant's default cannot exceed the amount demanded in the complaint or, for
personal injury cases where damages may not be stated in the complaint, the
amount listed in the statement of damages. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 580, subd. (a),
585, subd. (b).) “The notice requirement of section 580 was designed to insure
fundamental fairness.” (Becker v. S.P.V. Construction Co. (1980) 27
Cal.3d 489, 494 (Becker).) The statute ensures that “defendants in cases
which involve a default judgment have adequate notice of the judgments that may
be taken against them. [Citation.] ‘If a judgment other than that which is
demanded is taken against him, [the defendant] has been deprived of his day in
court—a right to a hearing on the matter adjudicated.’ ’’ (Id. at p.
493.) A trial court exceeds its jurisdiction if it awards damages in excess of
the amount specified in the complaint or statement of damages. (Id. at
p. 494; see Cal. Practice Guide: Procedure, supra, ¶ 5:258, p. 5-70.) 
The
court “shall hear the evidence offered by the plaintiff, and shall render
judgment in the plaintiff’s favor for that relief, not exceeding the amount
stated in the complaint, in the statement required by Section 425.11, or in the
statement provided for by Section 425.115, as appears by the evidence to be
just. If the taking of an account, or the proof of any fact, is necessary to
enable the court to give judgment or to carry the judgment into effect, the
court may take the account or hear the proof . . . .”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 585, subd. (b).) 
“[T]he
court in its discretion may permit the use of affidavits, in lieu of personal
testimony, as to all or any part of the evidence or proof required or permitted
to be offered, received, or heard . . . . The facts stated in the affidavit or
affidavits shall be within the personal knowledge of the affiant and shall be
set forth with particularity, and each affidavit shall show affirmatively that
the affiant, if sworn as a witness, can testify competently thereto.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 585, subd. (d).) 
DISCUSSION Plaintiffs must dismiss the Doe defendants or apply for separate judgment against them under Code of Civil Procedure section 579 before the Court can grant Plaintiffs' request for default judgment.  (See Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1800(a)(7).) 
Andrea
Medina requests $52,730.00 in special damages, but she has provided an
explanation for only $2,730.00 of that amount. 
(See Andea Medina Declaration ¶ 7 & exh. B.)
Andrea Medina should explain the basis
for her claim for the remaining $50,000.00 in special damages and provide
supporting evidence. 
Maurice
Medina requests $53,470.00 in special damages, but he has provided an explanation
for only $3,470.00 of that amount. (See Mauricio Medina Declaration ¶ 7 & exh.
B.)  Mauricio
Medina should explain the basis for his claim for the remaining $50,000.00 in
special damages and provide supporting evidence. 
Andrea Medina and Mauricio Medina each request $100,000 in general damages.  However, they have provided insufficient
evidence to support general damage awards in that amount.   Andrea Medina and Mauricio Medina should
provide additional information about the basis for their claims for general
damages. 
Andrea
Medina and Mauricio Medina each request $88.27 in costs for “mailing,
investigative, etc.”  An invoice attached
to counsel’s declaration shows a charge of $160 from Glucroft Investigations
for a “policy information search.”  Under
Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5, subdivision (b)(2), “[i]nvestigation
expenses in preparing the case for trial” are not allowable as costs.  Under Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5,
subdivision (b)(3), “[p]ostage, telephone, and photocopying charges” are not
allowable as costs except for exhibits. 
Counsel should revise the amounts requested for costs or explain why the
cost amounts sought are recoverable. 
For
the reasons stated above, the Court denies the applications. 
CONCLUSION 
The Court
DENIES Plaintiff Andrea Medina’s application for default judgment filed on July
14, 2023, without prejudice. 
The
Court DENIES Plaintiff Mauricio Medina’s application for default judgment filed
on July 14, 2023, without prejudice. 
 Plaintiff is ordered to give
notice of this ruling.
