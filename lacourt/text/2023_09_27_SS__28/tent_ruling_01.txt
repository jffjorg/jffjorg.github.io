  Case Number:  21STCV15410    Hearing Date:   September 27, 2023    Dept:  28 On
April 23, 2021, Plaintiff Helen Wang filed this action against Defendants
Chihling Wu, Sung Hao Nien, and Does 1-15 for motor vehicle and general
negligence. 
On
May 27, 2021, Defendants Chihling Wu and Sung Hao Nien filed an answer.  The same day, Defendant and Cross-Complainant
Chihling Wu and Jiaxin Nien, a minor by and through her guardian ad litem Chihling
Wu, filed a cross-complaint against Cross-Defendants Helen Wang and Does 1-50
for apportionment of fault, indemnification, motor vehicle, and general
negligence.  On June 25, 2021, Plaintiff
and Cross-Defendant Helen Wang filed an answer. 
On
July 23, 2021, the Court dismissed the cross-complaint’s first cause of action
for indemnification without prejudice based on the parties’ stipulation. 
On
March 7, 2023, the Court dismissed Plaintiff Helen Wang’s complaint without
prejudice at her request. 
On April
26, 2023, Cross-Complainant Chihling Wu and Jiaxin Nien filed a notice of conditional settlement. 
On April
27, 2023, the Court dismissed the “complaint of Chihling Wu against all
defendants” “as to only Cross-complaint of Chihling Wu” with prejudice. 
On
July 17, 2023, Petitioner Chihling Wu (“Petitioner”) filed a petition for
expedited approval of a minor’s compromise. 
An expedited petition without a hearing is permitted under California
Rules of Court, rule 7.950.5, as long as Petitioner uses the required Judicial
Council forms and meets the following conditions: 
1. Petitioner is represented
by an attorney.
2. The claim is not for
wrongful death.
3. Settlement proceeds will
not be placed in a trust.
4. There are no unresolved
liens.
5. Petitioner’s attorney did
not become involved at the request of Defendant or the insurance carrier.
6. Petitioner’s attorney is not
employed by or associated with a Defendant or insurance carrier in connection
with the petition.
7. If an action is filed, all
Defendants have appeared and are participating in the compromise OR the court
has determined that the settlement is in good faith.
8. The settlement, exclusive
of interests and costs, is $50,000 or less OR if greater than $50,000, the
amount payable is the insurance policy limits AND all proposed contributing
parties would be substantially unable to use assets other than the insurance
policy limits AND the court does not otherwise order. 
SETTLEMENT: $6,000 
INJURIES: pain to neck, back,
shoulders, right arms and knees 
MEDICAL EXPENSES: $6,630 
COSTS: $0.00 
ATTORNEY’S FEES: $1,597.50 (Section 14a) or $1,500 (Section 17c) 
BALANCE OF PROCEEDS:
$1,597.50 
DISCUSSION: 
Section
13 of the petition states that Claimant’s total medical expenses before
reductions were $6,630.00.  Of that
amount, $2,353.20 was subject to reduction. 
This would leave $4,276.80 to be paid or reimbursed from the settlement
proceeds.  However, the petition states
that only $2,500.00 is to be paid or reimbursed from the settlement proceeds.  This means that, according to Section 13 of
the petition, $1,776.80 is not being paid or reimbursed from the settlement
proceeds. 
Section
13 of the petition states that $1,776.80 is the amount of medical expenses paid.  The petition should be revised to show that the persons or
entities that paid this amount are being reimbursed from the settlement proceeds
or have waived their right to reimbursement. 
The petition
also states that lienholders have requested $2,500.00 and Claimant’s health
plan requests $402.50. These figures suggest that the amount to be paid or
reimbursed from the settlement proceeds should be at least $2,902.50, not $2,500 as the petition states in Section
13a(4).  (Section 17b contains the $2,902.50
figure.) 
The
Court cannot approve a minor’s compromise unless it reimburses all medical
expenses that have not been reduced or waived. 
Petitioner should revise the petition to address the discrepancies noted
above and to make sure that all liens are resolved prior to seeking Court
approval. 
The
petition lists different amounts for attorney’s fees in Section 14a and Section
17c.  Petitioner should revise the
petition to address this inconsistency. 
The
Court denies the petition without prejudice.
