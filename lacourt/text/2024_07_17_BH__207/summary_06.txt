And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling in a case between Plaintiff Elham Patavani and Defendant Discover Bank. The Plaintiff filed a verified complaint alleging one cause of action for violation of statutory duties. The Defendant filed a demurrer, arguing that the complaint fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action and is uncertain. The demurrer is unopposed. The Court finds that the Defendant has not provided the Plaintiff with adequate notice of the hearing date, despite conflicting information about the hearing date in the notice of demurrer and the corrected demurrer. The Court therefore overrules the Defendant's demurrer and orders the Defendant to file and serve an Answer to the Complaint on or before July 31, 2024.
