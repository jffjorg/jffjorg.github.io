MOTION
 
On February 22, 2024, Plaintiff Elham Patavani filed a verified
complaint against Defendants Discover, Synchorny Bank, and AmEx, alleging one
cause of action for violation of statutory duties.  
 
Defendant Discover Bank (“Defendant”) now demurs to the complaint on
the grounds that it fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of
action and is uncertain, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 430.10,
subdivisions (e) and (f), respectively. 
The demurrer is unopposed.  
 
ANALYSIS
 
            As a threshold matter, Code of Civil
Procedure section 1005 requires that written notice of the motion and
supporting papers be filed and served at least 16 court days prior to the
hearing.  Here, although the body of the
notice indicates the hearing is scheduled for July 17, the caption page of the
notice of demurrer indicates to the contrary that the hearing is scheduled for July
27, which is a court holiday (Saturday). 
(See Code Civ. Proc., §§ 10, 135.) 
  
 
            On May 2, 2024, Defendant filed a
notice of errata, the caption page of which also indicates the hearing is
scheduled for July 27.  Attached as
Exhibit A to the notice of errata is a corrected demurrer, to which a table of
contents and table of authorities were added. 
The caption page of the corrected demurrer also indicates the hearing is
scheduled for July 27.
 
            This
conflicting information about when the hearing date is scheduled is objectively
unclear and confusing, and especially in light of the fact that Plaintiff is
proceeding as a self-represented litigant, the Court finds that Defendant has
not provided Plaintiff adequate notice of the hearing date.  
 
            “[W]hen a litigant is self-represented, a judge has the
discretion to take reasonable steps, appropriate under the circumstances and
consistent with the law and the canons, to enable the litigant to be heard.”  (Holloway v. Quetel (2015) 242
Cal.App.4th 1425, 1434.)  “The judge
cannot rely on the pro per litigants to know each of the procedural steps, to
raise objections, to ask all the relevant questions of witnesses, and to
otherwise protect their due process rights.” 
(Ross v. Figueroa (2006) 139
Cal.App.4th 856, 861.)  “Providing access
to justice for self-represented litigants is a priority for California
courts.”  (California Rules of Court,
rule 10.960(b).)

 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
Therefore, the Court overrules Defendant’s demurrer for failure to
provide Plaintiff adequate notice of the hearing.  Further, the Court orders Defendant to file
and serve an Answer to the Complaint on or before July 31, 2024.  
 
Defendant shall provide notice of the Court’s ruling and file the
notice with a proof of service forthwith.
