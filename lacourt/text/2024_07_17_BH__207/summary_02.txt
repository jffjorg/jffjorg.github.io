And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling denies the plaintiff's motion to strike the answer of the defendant, Skylark Capital Management, LLC. The plaintiff, HD Supply Construction Supply, Ltd., moved to strike the answer on the grounds that Skylark was unrepresented by a licensed attorney at the time of the hearing. The court ruled that despite Skylark's counsel being relieved, the answer was properly drawn and filed in conformity with California laws when it was filed, and therefore, the motion to strike was denied. The court also found that Skylark's failure to retain new counsel or appear in the matter since the relief of counsel did not satisfy the requirements for a corporation to be represented by a licensed attorney.
