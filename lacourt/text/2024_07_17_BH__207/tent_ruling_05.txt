MOTION
 
On October 5, 2023, Plaintiff Erin Naymark (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint
in this action against Defendant Tutored By Teachers, Inc., alleging nine
causes of action for (1) misclassification of employment status; (2) failure to
pay minimum wages; (3) failure to pay overtime wages; (4) failure to provide
meal periods; (5) failure to provide rest periods; (6) failure to provide
adequate paystubs; (7) failure to maintain accurate records; (8) failure to
indemnify for all employment related losses/expenditures; and (9) unfair
competition.
 
On November 27, 2023, after the Labor and Workforce Development Agency
(“LWDA”) review period had expired, Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint
(“FAC”) adding a cause of action for civil penalties under the Private Attorney
General Act (“PAGA”).
 
Plaintiff now moves for approval of the PAGA settlement and judgment
thereon.  Plaintiff’s motion is
unopposed.  
 
ANALYSIS
 
“Under
PAGA, an aggrieved employee may bring a civil action personally and on behalf
of other current or former employees to recover civil penalties for Labor Code
violations. Of the civil penalties recovered, 75 percent goes to the Labor and
Workforce Development Agency, leaving the remaining 25 percent for the
‘aggrieved employees.”  (Townley v.
BJ's Restaurants, Inc. (2019) 37 Cal.App.5th 179, 181 [cleaned up.])  An individual employee is not entitled to
recover the entire 25 percent amount of civil penalties allocated to aggrieved
employees.  (Moorer v. Noble L.A.
Events, Inc. (2019) 32 Cal.App.5th 736, 742.)
 
            “The superior court shall review and
approve any settlement of any civil action filed pursuant to this part.”  (Lab. Code, § 2699, subd. (s)(2).)  “[A] trial court should evaluate a
PAGA settlement to determine whether it is fair, reasonable, and adequate in
view of PAGA's purposes to remediate present labor law violations, deter future
ones, and to maximize enforcement of state labor laws.”  (Moniz v. Adecco USA, Inc. (2021) 72
Cal.App.5th 56, 77.) 
 
            The parties seek to settle the
matter for $550,000.00, of which $187,365.00 will be paid as attorneys’ fees to
counsel, representing approximately 34% of the total settlement amount; $8,277.99
will be paid to reimburse costs; $5,135.00 will be allocated to prior counsel,
as a lien holder, for attorneys’ fees; $795.90 will be allocated to prior
counsel, as a lien holder, for costs; $3,750.00 will go to the administrator;
$20,000 will be allocated to Plaintiff, as the PAGA representative; and the
remaining $324,676.11 will be allocated as follows - 75% ($243,507.08) for the
LWDA PAGA Payment and 25% ($81,169.03) for the 235 aggrieved individuals, as
required by law.  (Ex. D to Wong Decl.)
 
            Concerning the $550,000 settlement amount, Plaintiff’s
counsel performed an in-depth analysis of the likely recovery for each claim,
taking into account the relative strengths, weaknesses, and risks of each
claim, to determine a settlement amount that represented a reasonable
compromise, pursuant to Kullar v. Foot Locker Retail, Inc. (2008) 168
Cal.App.4th 116 (hereafter Kullar.) 
In Kullar, the appellate court analyzed whether a wage and hour
class action settlement represented a reasonable compromise.  Although PAGA actions are not required to
satisfy the requirements for class action settlements (see Arias v.
Superior Court (2009) 46 Cal.4th 969, 975), the Court finds Plaintiff’s Kullar analysis
instructive and compelling.  
 
            Specifically, Plaintiff provided an
attorney declaration of Gregory P. Wong (“Wong”), outlining counsel’s
calculations and indicating:
 
38. As detailed in the table below, the overall
result of my Kullar risk analysis determined that the range of
risk-adjusted recovery was $226,245.69 to $630,856.31. This
places the proposed gross settlement amount of $550,000.00 squarely in
the high range of potential outcomes. 
 
Violation                    Max
Exposure           Low Recovery           High Recovery 
Misclassification        $2,350,000.00             $146,875.00
               $440,625.00

Minimum Wage          $191,232.00
               $23,904.00                  $35,856.00 
Reimbursement           $99,600.00
                 $6,225.00                    $18,675.00 
Rest Break                  $59,234.11
                 $3,702.13                    $7,404.26 
Meal Period                $17,276.62
                 $1,079.79                    $2,159.58 
Wage Statement          $187,450.00
               $11,715.63                  $35,146.88 
Recordkeeping            $176,250.00
               $11,015.63                  $33,046.88 
Waiting Time              $347,656.32
               $21,728.52                  $57,942.72 
Total                           $3,428,699.05
            $226,245.69                $630,856.31
 
(Wong
Decl. ¶ 38.)  
 
In support of the requested $20,000 representative payment to
Plaintiff, the Wong declaration provides as follows:
 
39. Plaintiff Naymark alleges individual claims
that go beyond the scope of the representative PAGA claims at issue in this
Action. To begin with, Plaintiff Naymark began work for Defendant in March of
2022. The PAGA Period for purposes of this action begins on September 14, 2022.
Thus, Plaintiff has approximately six months of additional damages that have
been pled on an individual basis beyond the PAGA penalties sought.
Additionally, Plaintiff possesses “Individual PAGA” claims that are distinct
from the representative PAGA claims. See Adolph v. Uber Technologies, Inc., 14
Cal.5th 1104 (2023). By agreeing to a general release and judgment as to all
claims alleged in this Action, Plaintiff is compromising claims that go beyond
the representative PAGA claims. Based on my experience as an employment
litigator and my knowledge of Plaintiff’s individual claims, I estimate that a
reasonable range of settlement for Plaintiff’s individual claims would have met
or exceeded $20,000.00.
 
(Wong
Decl. ¶ 39.)
 
The Wong Declaration also provides an accounting of the requested
$183,152.50 in attorneys’ fees it is requesting.  (Wong Decl. ¶ 49.)
 
In support of the requested administrator fees, Plaintiff provides the
curriculum vitae and an estimate from Phoenix, a class action administrator
company, providing that the estimated costs to administer the PAGA settlement
for 235 aggrieved members will not exceed $3,750.  (Wong Decl. ¶ 55, Ex. E.)
 
            Therefore, the Court finds that the proposed
settlement amount is fair, reasonable, and adequate in all respects and has
been submitted to the LWDA per Labor Code section 2699, subdivision (s)(2).  (Wong Decl. 
¶ 58, Ex. G.)  
 
            Plaintiff also seeks approval of the
proposed notice of settlement and release of claims, which the parties propose
sending with the settlement checks.  (Wong
Decl.  ¶ 57, Ex. F.)  The Court finds the notice adequately instructs
the aggrieved members of the settlement and their release of claims.  
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
For the reasons stated, the Court grants Plaintiff’s Motion for
Approval of PAGA Settlement and Judgment in its entirety.  As such, the Court will enter the Order as
proposed, except the Court will schedule a Status Conference regarding
compliance with the distribution of the settlement proceeds on October 7, 2024
at 8:30 A.M. in Department 207.  A Status
Report shall be filed with the Court no later than 5 court days before the
conference.
 
Plaintiff shall provide notice of the Court’s ruling and file the
notice with a proof of service forthwith.
