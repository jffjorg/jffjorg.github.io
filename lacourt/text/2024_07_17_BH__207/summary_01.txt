Here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion by the defendants, Label27, LLC and Brooks Ellis, to require the plaintiff, Derek Underwood, to post an undertaking of $18,810.25. The defendants argue that the plaintiff resides out of state and has failed to appear for a physical examination, and therefore, they have a reasonable possibility of prevailing at trial. The plaintiff argues that the defendants have failed to conduct their own discovery and have no basis to seek relief by way of excluding any evidence. The judge finds that the defendants have not met their burden to demonstrate a reasonable possibility of prevailing at trial and therefore denies the motion. The judge also finds that the plaintiff's failure to appear for a physical examination is not sufficient grounds for the defendants to obtain issue, evidentiary, or terminating sanctions against the plaintiff.
