MOTION
 
Plaintiff HD Supply Construction Supply, Ltd. (“Plaintiff”) moves to
strike the answer of Defendant Skylark Capital Management, LLC (“Skylark”).  The motion is unopposed.
 
ANALYSIS
 
On a motion to strike, the Court may: (1) strike out any irrelevant,
false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading; or (2) strike out all or
any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of
California, a court rule, or an order of the court.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 436, subds. (a)-(b); Stafford v. Shultz (1954) 42 Cal.2d 767,
782.)
 
            On March 19, 2021, while represented
by counsel, Skylark filed its Answer to Plaintiff’s Complaint.  Subsequently, on September 12, 2023, the
Court granted Skylark’s counsel’s motion to be relieved as counsel, indicating
that counsel would remain counsel of record for Skylark until counsel filed a
proof of service of the signed order on Skylark and all other parties who have
appeared in the action.  Counsel filed
the notice of ruling with proof of service on September 25, 2023.  Thus, Skylark’s original counsel was relieved
as of September 25, 2023.
 
            Skylark does not appear to have ever
retained new counsel and has not filed any documents or otherwise appeared in
this matter since counsel was relieved.  
 
            “A corporation has the capacity to
bring a lawsuit because it has all the powers of a natural person in carrying
out its business.  However, under a
long-standing common law rule of procedure, a corporation, unlike a natural
person, cannot represent itself before courts of record in propria persona, nor
can it represent itself through a corporate officer, director or other employee
who is not an attorney. It must be represented by licensed counsel in
proceedings before courts of record.”  (CLD
Construction, Inc. v. City of San Ramon (2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 1141, 1145
[cleaned up].)  As such, entities, like
Skylark, must be represented by a licensed attorney.  (See, e.g., Caressa Camille, Inc. v.
Alcoholic Beverage Control Appeals Board (2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 1094, 1101.)   
 
            Thus, in light of the fact that
Skylark appears unrepresented by a licensed attorney, Plaintiff moves to strike
Skylark’s answer as not drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of
California, and pursue a default judgment against Skylark.
 
            However, Skylark was represented by
counsel at the time the Answer was filed. 
Thus, the Answer was both drawn and filed in conformity with the laws of
California, notwithstanding that Skylark’s counsel was subsequently relieved.  As such, Plaintiff has not articulated a
valid legal basis to strike Skylark’s otherwise properly drawn and filed
Answer.  
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
Therefore, having found Skylark’s Answer was drawn and filed in
conformity with the laws of the State of California at the time it was filed,
the Court denies Plaintiff’s motion to strike. 
 
Plaintiff shall provide notice of the Court’s ruling and file the
notice with a proof of service forthwith.
