I.                   
INTRODUCTION
This action arises from the alleged breach of a
lease agreement concerning real property including the land, improvements, and
fixtures therein located at 11934-11940 Willowbrook Avenue, Los Angeles,
California 90059, which consists of four units (the “Premises”).
On April 21, 2023, Plaintiff Willowbrook Home
LLC (“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint against Defendants David Wohlman (“Wohlman),
Felicia Edelman (“Edelman”) (collectively “Defendants”), and DOES 1 to 25,
inclusive, alleging causes of action for: (1) Past Due Rent Owed; (2) Breach of
Lease for Failure to Pay Rent When Due; (3) Breach of Lease for Failure to
Allow Inspection of and Repair to Premises; (4) Breach of Lease for Failure to
Repair and Maintain Premises; (5) Breach of Lease for Pest Infestation; (6) Conversion;
(7) Trespass; (8) Waste; and (9) Negligence. 
On July 31, 2023, Defendants filed a
Cross-Complaint against Plaintiff, Susan Carpenter (“Carpenter”), Craig
Caldwell (“Caldwell”), and ROES 1 to 10, inclusive, alleging the following
causes of action: (1) Constructive Eviction; (2) Failure to Comply with Civ.
Code § 1950.5; (3) Breach of Contract; (4) Breach of Good Faith and Fair
Dealing; (5) Tortious Interference with Contractual Relationship; and (6)
Harassment/Intentional Retaliation. 
On August 4, 2023, Defendants filed a joint
Answer to the Complaint.
On August 28, 2023, Plaintiff and
Cross-Defendant Caldwell filed respective Answers to the Cross-Complaint.
On August 29, 2023, Cross-Defendant Carpenter
filed an Answer to the Cross-Complaint. 
On January 30, 2024, the court held an Informal
Discovery Conference (“IDC”) and the court noted that the issues had not been
resolved and ordered counsel to meet and confer. (01/30/24 Minute Order.) If
the objections remained, the parties could request another IDC or file a motion
to compel. (01/30/24 Minute Order.) 
On February 6, 2024, Plaintiff filed and served
a Notice of Ruling indicating that, at the IDC, the court and parties agreed
that Defendants would respond to Set One of Plaintiff’s Requests for Production
of Documents by February 20, 2024. (02/06/24 Notice of Ruling.) 
On February 29, 2024, Plaintiff filed and
served these Motions to Compel Defendants Wohlman and Edelman’s Responses to
Plaintiff’s Requests for Production of Documents, Set One, and for monetary
sanctions against Wohlman and Edelman, and their counsel of record, Marc Lafer.[1] 
Plaintiff’s motions are unopposed. Any
opposition was required to have been filed and served at least nine court days
prior to the hearing. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1005, subd. (b).) 
 
II.                
LEGAL STANDARD
In California, discovery statutes “must be
construed liberally in favor of disclosure unless the request is clearly
improper.” (Williams v. Superior Court (2017) 3 Cal.5th 531, 541.)
Consequently, “[a]ny party may obtain discovery regarding any matter, not
privileged, that is relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending
action.” (Ibid.) 
“Any party may obtain discovery . . . by
inspecting, copying, testing, or sampling documents, tangible things, land or
other property, and electronically stored information in the possession,
custody, or control of any other party to the action.” (Code Civ. Proc. §
2031.010(a).) Where a party fails to timely respond to demand for inspection,
copying, testing or sampling “[t]he party to whom the demand for inspection,
copying, testing, or sampling is directed waives any objection to the demand,
including one based on privilege or on the protection for work product.” (Code
Civ. Proc. § 2031.300(a).) Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.300(b) provides that “[t]he
party making the demand may move for an order compelling response to the
demand.”
          “[T]he court shall impose a monetary sanction .
. . against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes
a motion to compel a response to a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or
sampling, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.290(c).) A court has discretion to
fix the amount of reasonable monetary sanctions. (Cornerstone Realty Advisors,
LLC v. Summit Healthcare Reit, Inc. (2020) 56 Cal.App.5th 771, 791.)
III.             
DISCUSSION
Plaintiff served counsel for Defendants Wohlman
and Edelman with Set One of Plaintiff’s Requests for Production of Documents,
Set One, on August 28, 2023. (Howard Decl., ¶ 4; Exh. A.) After defense counsel
stated it had no record of being served with discovery, Plaintiff’s counsel
re-sent the discovery to defense counsel. (Howard Decl., ¶ 12; Exh. G.) Defendant
Wohlman has failed to provide any responses to Set One of Plaintiff’s Requests
for Production of Documents. (Howard Decl., ¶ 17(b).) Defendants Wohlman and
Edelman have not complied with the Notice of Ruling as to the IDC, which
requires Defendant Wohlman and Edelman to provide responses to Set One of
Plaintiff’s Requests for Production of Documents by February 20, 2024. (Howard
Decl., ¶ 17(a)-(b).) 
Ms. Howard declares that her hourly rate is
$300.00 per hour and that she anticipates spending seven (7) hours total
preparing the motion and appearing at the hearing thereon. (Howard Decl., ¶
19(b).) A $60.00 filing fee was incurred for the motion. (Howard Decl., ¶
19(a).) Ms. Howard states that she estimates spending an additional four (4)
hours preparing a reply brief and preparing for oral argument and attending the
hearing. (Howard Decl., ¶ 19(c).) Thus, she estimates additional fees of
$1,200.00 will be incurred. (Howard Decl., ¶ 19(c).) Plaintiff requests total
monetary sanctions in the amount of $3,360.00. (Howard Decl., ¶ 19.) 
The Court finds that Defendants Wohlman and
Edelman have failed to respond to discovery and compelling their responses are
appropriate. 
As to monetary sanctions, the Court finds that
the total hours should be reduced given the relative brevity of the motion, its
straightforward nature, and the lack of an opposition brief. 
The Court therefore GRANTS IN PART Plaintiff’s
request for monetary sanctions and AWARDS Plaintiff reasonable monetary
sanctions against each defendant in the amount of $660.00 (which represents 2.0
hours of work on the motion at the rate of $300.00 per hour plus the $60.00
filing fee) for a total award of $1,320.  Monetary sanctions are to be paid to Plaintiff
by Defendants and their counsel of record, Marc Lafer, jointly and severally,
within 30 days of the date of notice of this order. 
 
IV.            
CONCLUSION
The Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion to compel.
The Court ORDERS Defendants Wohlman and Edelman to provide verified, complete,
and code-compliant responses, without objections, to Set One of Plaintiff’s
Requests for Production of Documents within 30 days of the date of notice of
this order. 
Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions is
GRANTED IN PART. Monetary sanctions in the amount of $660.00 are to be paid to
Plaintiff by Defendant Wohlman and his counsel of record, Marc Lafer, jointly
and severally, within 30 days of the date of notice of this order.  Monetary sanctions in the amount of $660.00
are to be paid to Plaintiff by Defendant Edelman and her counsel of record,
Marc Lafer, jointly and severally, within 30 days of the date of notice of this
order.
Plaintiff is ordered to give notice.
