[1] The Court
notes that the notice of motion contains a typographical error indicating that
the motion is set for hearing in Department 37, which is incorrect. Plaintiff’s
Notice of Non-Opposition to the Motion, which was filed on May 28, 2024, also
contains the same error. This action was never assigned to Department 37. While
the notice of motion contains an error, given that the motion is unopposed,
Defendant Wohlman has conceded to all arguments raised therein. (Moulton
Niguel Water Dist. v. Colombo (2003) 111 Cal.App.4th 1210, 1215.) The Court
does not find the typographical error to be prejudicial.
