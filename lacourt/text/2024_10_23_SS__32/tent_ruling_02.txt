Corina Hernandez (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Defendants Bird Rides,
Inc., Bank of Hope, and Does 1 to 60 for injuries after tripping and falling

Defendant Bank of Hope, Inc. (“Defendant”) now moves to dismiss for failure to prosecute pursuant to
Code of Civil Procedure section 583.210 et seq. Plaintiff opposes and Defendant
replies. 
 
BACKGROUND
 
The proof of service
filed January 3, 2023 shows that Defendant was served the summons and complaint
via personal service to its registered agent of process on December 9, 2022. 
 
On January 17, 2023,
Defendant filed a demurrer. The demurrer was sustained with leave to amend.
(Min. Order, 3/15/23.) 
 
On January 24, 2023,
Defendant’s ex parte application was granted continuing trial and all related
dates to February 16, 2024. 
 
On April 12, 2023,

Defendant filed an answer to the FAC. 
 
On November 21, 2023,
Plaintiff filed three amendments to the complaint substituting Frank S. Lee,
Eunice P. Lee, and The 2011 Lee Family Trust Dated March 21, 2011, for Does 1,

LEGAL
STANDARD
 
Motion
to Dismiss
 
“A
defendant, on or before the last day of his or her time to plead or within any
further time that the court may for good cause allow, may serve and file a
notice of motion for one or more of the following purposes: . . . To dismiss
the action pursuant to the applicable provisions of Chapter 1.5 (commencing
with Section 583.110) of Title 8.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 418.10(a)(3).) 
 
“Notwithstanding
Section 1014, no act by a party who makes a motion under this section,
including filing an answer, demurrer, or motion to strike constitutes an
appearance, unless the court denies the motion made under this section. If the
court denies the motion made under this section, the defendant or
cross-defendant is not deemed to have generally appeared until entry of the
order denying the motion.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 418.10(e)(1).) “Failure to make a
motion under this section at the time of filing a demurrer or motion to strike
constitutes a waiver of the issues of lack of personal jurisdiction, inadequacy
of process, inadequacy of service of process, inconvenient forum, and delay in
prosecution.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 418.10(e)(3).) 
 
Three-Year
Deadline to Serve 
 
Code of Civil
Procedure section 583.210(a) states: “[t]he summons and complaint shall
be served upon a defendant within three years after the action is commenced
against the defendant. For the purpose of this subdivision, an action is
commenced at the time the complaint is filed.” “Dismissal is mandatory where a plaintiff fails to serve a
defendant within the statutory time limits. (§ 583.250, subd. (b).) The
three-year rule applies where the defendant seeking dismissal was served as a
Doe defendant named in the original complaint, later amended to show his or her
true name. [Citations.] In short, a plaintiff has three years from the date of
filing the complaint to identify and serve a Doe defendant.” (Inversiones
Papaluchi S.A.S. v. Superior Court (2018) 20 Cal.App.5th 1055, 1061.) 
 
“The time within which service must be
made pursuant to this article does not apply if the defendant enters into a
stipulation in writing or does another act that constitutes a general
appearance in the action.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 583.220.) “To prevent dismissal,
any claimed general appearance must have occurred within the mandatory
three-year period. An appearance made thereafter does not deprive a defendant
of his right to dismissal.” (Brookview Condominium Owners' Assn. v. Heltzer
Enterprises-Brookview (1990) 218 Cal.App.3d 502, 509 [defendant did not
make a general appearance to preclude dismissal under 583.220 where defendant
filed answer and engaged in discovery after the three-year period].) 
 
In computing the
time for service, the following condition is excluded: “[s]ervice, for any
other reason, was impossible, impracticable, or futile due to causes beyond the
plaintiff's control. Failure to discover relevant facts or evidence is not a
cause beyond the plaintiff's control for the purpose of this subdivision.”
(Code Civ. Proc. § 583.240(d).) 
“The nature and
purpose of the three-year service of process statute (section 583.210) and the
statute of limitations are virtually identical. [Citation.] A statute of
limitations serves to promote the public policy of furthering justice by
precluding the assertion of stale claims. [Citation.] (Hennessey's Tavern, Inc. v. American Air Filter Co. (1988) 204 Cal.App.3d 1351, 1359.)  “The three-year service requirement is ‘mandatory’
and is ‘not subject to extension, excuse, or exception except as expressly provided
by statute.’ (Code of Civ. Proc., § 583.250, subd. (b); [citation].) Further,
we are strictly to construe ‘[t]he excuse of impossibility, impracticability,
or futility ... in light of the need to give a defendant adequate notice of the
action so that the defendant can take necessary steps to preserve evidence.’
[Citation.] (State ex rel. Edelweiss Fund,
LLC v. JP Morgan Chase & Co. (2020) 58 Cal.App.5th 1113, 1120.)
“The question of
impossibility, impracticability, or futility is best resolved by the trial
court, which ‘is in the most advantageous position to evaluate these diverse
factual matters in the first instance.’ ” [Citation.] The burden of proof is on
the plaintiff, and we will not disturb the trial court's determination unless
the plaintiff also proves the trial court abused its discretion. [Citation.] ‘Under
that standard, [t]he trial court's findings of fact are reviewed for
substantial evidence, its conclusions of law are reviewed de novo, and its
application of the law to the facts is reversible only if arbitrary and
capricious.’ [Citation.] (Id. at 1120–21.) 
Failure to discover the identity of a Doe
defendant does not toll the statutory period. (Code of Civ. Proc. § 583.240(d);
Republic Corp. v. Superior Court (1984) 160 Cal.App.3d 1253, 1255 [dismissal
mandatory under previous statute where investigation and development of a
previously unknown witness uncovered the party who manufactured the subject
water heater]; see also Nelson v. State of California (1982) 139 Cal.App.3d 72, 77
[finding plaintiff failed to demonstrate an “adequate showing of diligence or
excuse for delay” because he had ample time to propound discovery to discover
the name of a Doe defendant.].)
If service is not
made within three years, then “[t]he action shall be dismissed by the court on
its own motion or on motion of any person interested in the action, whether
named as a party or not, after notice to the parties.” (Code Civ. Proc. §
583.250(a)(2).) “The requirements of this article are mandatory and are not
subject to extension, excuse, or exception except as expressly provided by
statute.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 583.250(b).) 
DISCUSSION
Here, as outlined
by the procedural history above, it appears that Defendant was served with the
summons and complaint within the first three years: the complaint was filed
August 20, 2021, and Defendant was served on December 9, 2022.  
Defendant appears
to assert this motion on the basis that the Doe defendants that were
substituted on November 21, 2023
have not been served; Defendant contends these defendants are its landlords.
(Motion, 3.) Defendant also argues that as of September 9, 2024, no proof of
service has been filed as to these defendants. 
Defendant appears
to argue that Code of Civil Procedure section 583.250 requires that the entire
action be dismissed if some defendants have not been served. However, the
statute does not expressly state as such. Section 583.250 states that the
action shall be dismissed if “service is not made in an action within the time
prescribed in this article.” Here, service has been made on moving Defendant.
Furthermore, it appears Defendant waived its right to move to dismiss since it
already filed an answer and appeared in this case. (Code Civ. Proc. §
418.10(e)(3).) The Court does not address at this time whether the action
against Doe defendants must be dismissed, as counsel for Defendant does not
purport to represent these defendants. To the extent Defendant argues it owed
no duty to Plaintiff, the Court will not address that argument in this motion,
but reserves that determination for Defendant’s summary judgment motion. 
As a result, the
motion to dismiss is denied. 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
Therefore, the Court DENIES Defendant Bank of Hope, Inc.’s motion
to dismiss.
 
Defendant shall provide notice of the Court’s ruling and file a
proof of service of such.
