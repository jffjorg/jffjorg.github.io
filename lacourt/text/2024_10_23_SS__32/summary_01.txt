And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the petition filed by Petitioner Narine Bosnuyan on behalf of Claimant Rafael Nico Godzhoyan, a 9-year-old minor. The court denies the petition without prejudice due to several defects. The court finds that the petition was filed on the wrong form (MC-350EX instead of MC-350) and that the settlement amount exceeds $50,000. The court also notes that the medical records provided do not show that the Claimant is fully recovered and that additional documentation is required. The court requires the Petitioner to complete several items on the petition form and to provide additional information, including an attorney declaration and proof of service. The court gives the Petitioner an opportunity to correct the defects and refile the petition.
