TENTATIVE
RULING
 



DEPT:


32




HEARING DATE:


October
  23, 2024




CASE NUMBER:


22STCV25044




MOTIONS:  


Motion
  for Terminating and Monetary Sanctions   




MOVING PARTY:


Plaintiff Ciara M. 




OPPOSING PARTY:


Defendant
  Jeremy Ellis



 
 
BACKGROUND
 
Plaintiff Ciara M. (“Plaintiff”) moves for terminating and monetary
sanctions against Defendant Jeremy Ellis (“Defendant”) for failure to comply
with the Court’s April 26, 2024 and August 16, 2024 discovery orders. Defendant
opposes and Plaintiff replies.  
 
LEGAL
STANDARD 
 
“To
the extent authorized by the chapter governing any particular discovery method
or any other provision of this title, the court, after notice to any affected
party, person, or attorney, and after opportunity for hearing, may
impose…sanctions against anyone engaging in conduct that is a misuse of the
discovery process.” (Code Civ. Proc. section 2023.030.) The court may impose a
terminating sanction for misuse of the discovery process by any of the
following: “(1) An order striking out the pleadings or parts of the pleadings
of any party engaging in the misuse of the discovery process; (2) An order
staying further proceedings by that party until an order for discovery is
obeyed; (3) An order dismissing the action, or any part of the action, of that
party; (4) An order rendering a judgment by default against that party.” (Code
Civ. Proc. § 2023.030(d).)  Failing to
respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery, or
disobeying
a court order to provide discovery, constitutes a
misuse of the discovery process. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (d), (g).)

 
“The trial court may order a terminating sanction for discovery abuse
‘after considering the totality of the circumstances: [the] conduct of the
party to determine if the actions were willful; the detriment to the
propounding party; and the number of formal and informal attempts to obtain the
discovery.’” (Los Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez (2014) 223 Cal. App. 4th
377, 390, quoting Lang v. Hochman (2000) 77 Cal. App. 4th 1225,
1246.)   
 
“Generally, ‘[a] decision to order terminating sanctions should not be
made lightly.  But where a violation is
willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less
severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the
trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction.’” (Los
Defensores, supra, 223 Cal. App. 4th at p. 390 [citation omitted].)    
 
“Under this standard, trial courts have properly imposed terminating
sanctions when parties have willfully disobeyed one or more discovery orders.”
(Los Defensores, supra, 223 Cal.App.4th at p. 390 citing Lang, supra,
77 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1244-1246 [discussing cases]; see, e.g., Collisson
& Kaplan v. Hartunian (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 1611, 1617-1622
[terminating sanctions imposed (by striking the defendant’s Answer and
subsequently granting default judgment) after defendants failed to comply with
one court order to produce discovery]; Laguna Auto Body v. Farmers Ins.
Exchange (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 481, 491, disapproved on other grounds in Garcia
v. McCutchen (1997) 16 Cal.4th 469, 478, n. 4 [terminating sanctions
imposed against the plaintiff for failing to comply with a discovery order and
for violating various discovery statutes].) 

 
“If that party or party-affiliated deponent then fails to obey an
order compelling attendance, testimony, and production, the court may make
those orders that are just, including the imposition of an issue sanction, an
evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
Section 2023.010) against that party deponent or against the party with whom
the deponent is affiliated. In lieu of, or in addition to, this sanction, the
court may impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) against that deponent or against the party with whom that party
deponent is affiliated, and in favor of any party who, in person or by
attorney, attended in the expectation that the deponent's testimony would be
taken pursuant to that order.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2025.450(h).) 
 
“If a party is required to submit to a physical or mental examination
under Articles 2 (commencing with Section 2032.210) or 3 (commencing with
Section 2032.310), or under Section 2016.030, but fails to do so, the court, on
motion of the party entitled to the examination, may make those orders that are
just, including the imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a
terminating sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In
lieu of or in addition to that sanction, the court may, on motion of the party,
impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010).”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2032.410.) 
 
 
DISCUSSION
 
In this case, default was entered against Defendant on October 10,
2022. On January 26, 2023, the Court granted Defendant’s motion to set aside
the default. On January 27, 2023, Defendant filed his answer. 
 
On April 26, 2024, the Court granted Plaintiff’s motion to compel
Defendant’s deposition. Defendant was ordered to appear within 30 days’ notice
of the order for a deposition. Furthermore, the Court imposed $585 in monetary
sanctions against Defendant. On April 29, 2024, Plaintiff filed notice of the
ruling and served it on Defendant’s counsel. 
 
Then, on August 16, 2024, the Court granted Plaintiff’s motion to
compel a physical examination of Defendant. Defendant was ordered to appear at
Quest Diagnostics in Miami, Florida on August 27, 2024 at 9:00 a.m. EDT for an
intravenous blood draw by a licensed phlebotomist. Prior to the blood draw,
Defendant was ordered to provide a government issued photo identification card
to an authorized representative of Plaintiff’s counsel, for identification.
(Min. Order, 8/16/24.) On August 16, 2024, Plaintiff filed notice of the ruling
and served it on Defendant’s counsel.
 
Plaintiff contends that Defendant has not complied with either of
these orders. 
 
After the Court granted the motion to compel the deposition, on May 2,
2024, Plaintiff noticed Defendant’s deposition for May 21, 2024. (Ho Decl. ¶ 5,
Exh. C.) Defendant objected on May 10, 2024. (Id. ¶ 6, Exh. D.) Defendant
did not respond to Plaintiff’s attempts to meet and confer. (Id. ¶ 7.)
 
Regarding the order for the physical examination, Plaintiff asserts
that on August 23, 2024, Defendant informed Plaintiff he was unavailable on
August 27, 2024, but available any day after September 18, 2024. (Ho Decl. ¶ 2,
Exh. A.) Accordingly, Defendant did not appear for the examination. Plaintiff
then offered the following dates to reschedule: September 18, 20, 21, 23-27.
Plaintiff informed Defendant that if he did not respond by September 6, 2024,
Plaintiff would file a motion for sanctions. As of the filing of this motion,
Defendant had not responded to Plaintiff. (Id. ¶ 4.) 
 
In opposition, Defendant points to previous times when he submitted to
blood samples, and argues he provided dates for the examination in the first
week of June 2024, and most recently, on October 8, 2024, offered the following
dates: October 15-17, 2024. (Ellis Decl. ¶ 6.)  Defendant argues this shows a willingness to
cooperate. Defendant also declares he was out of the country during the time of
his scheduled examination, but also apologizes to the Court for missing the
examination. (Ellis Decl. ¶ 4, 8.) As for the deposition, Defendant argues that
he frequently travels for work which makes scheduling depositions difficult.
However, the Court notes that Defendant’s deposition scheduled for May 21, 2024
was a remote deposition conducted on zoom. (See Ho Decl., Exh. C.) Defendant
fails to show how the remote deposition was burdensome. Nevertheless, Defendant
asserts he has confirmed his availability for the following dates: October
21-23, 2024. 
 
In reply, Plaintiff confirms that on October 15, 2024, the parties
agreed to conduct the examination on October 21, 2024, and take Defendant’s
deposition on October 22, 2024. (Supp. Ho Decl. ¶ 2.)
 
Despite Defendant’s previous noncompliance with the Court’s orders,
the Court concludes that at this time, Defendant’s conduct is not sufficiently
willful and that lesser sanctions can induce compliance. Nevertheless, further
conduct showing noncompliance or resisting the discovery sought in the orders,
or other discovery in general, may be construed as a pattern of willful misconduct
in a future motion for terminating sanctions. Therefore, at this time, the
Court finds monetary sanctions are warranted for the noncompliance. 
 
Plaintiff has requested $3,113.94 in monetary sanctions against
Defendant, which reflects Plaintiff’s counsel’s costs to attend the medical
examination on August 27, 2024 ($953.94), an hourly rate of $350, and the $60
filing fee. Though Defendant told Plaintiff he would not appear, the Court
notes this directly violated the August 16, 2024 order; furthermore, not responding
to Plaintiff or selecting an alternative date discredits Defendant’s excuse, if
any, for not attending the examination. Accordingly, the Court finds sanctions
are warranted and awards $3,113.94
 
CONCLUSION
 
Therefore, Plaintiff’s motion for terminating sanctions is GRANTED in
part. The request for terminating sanctions is denied. 
 
The Court grants Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions in the amount
of $3,113.94 against Defendant.[1]
Said monetary sanctions shall be paid to counsel for Plaintiff within 30 days. 
 
Plaintiff shall provide notice of the Court’s ruling and file a proof
of service of such.
