RELIEF
REQUESTED:

Petition
to Confirm Arbitration Award
 
SUMMARY
OF ACTION
On
November 5, 2021, Arthur Israyelyan filed a lemon law complaint against BMW
North America, LLC. BMW North America, LLC answered the complaint on January
28, 2022. On April 30, 2022, the court entered the parties stipulation to
submit the claims to arbitration. 
 
RULING: Granted.
Defendant/Respondent
BMW North America, LLC (BMW) moves to confirm the arbitration award. The court
electronic filing system shows the motion/petition remains unopposed. The court
system also shows no reply at the time of the tentative ruling publication
cutoff.
 
On
December 28, 2023, the arbitrator found in favor of BMW: "1. All claims by
Claimant Artur Israyelyan are denied and Claimant shall take nothing as a
result of this arbitration. 2. Each party shall bear their own attorney’s fees
and costs. 3. The administrative fees of the American Arbitration Association
(AAA) totaling $2,880.00 (Two Thousand Eight Hundred Eighty Dollars and No
Cents) shall be borne as incurred, and the compensation of the arbitrator
totaling $5,000.00 (Five Thousand Dollars and No Cents) shall be borne as
incurred.” [Declaration of Susan Hartounian, ¶ 5, Ex. 2: Award of Arbitrator, ¶
95.]
 
The
court must confirm the award as made, unless it corrects or vacates the award,
or dismisses the proceeding. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1286; Valsan Partners Limited Partnership v. Calcor Space Facility, Inc.
(1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 809, 818.) Service of the petition to confirm the award
was completed via electronic service on March 5, 2024. Respondent provided no
objection to the service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1290.4, subd. (a).) Service is
therefore presumed valid. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1290.4, subd. (b).) The petition
contains all required items. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1285.4.) [Hartounian Decl.] Respondent
submits no challenge to the petition within the 100-day challenge period
following the December 28, 2023, issued final award. (Eternity Investments,
Inc. v. Brown (2007) 151 Cal.App.4th 739, 745.)
 
All arbitration awards, including those
that already have been satisfied or performed, are subject to confirmation, and
not moot. (Pacific Law Group: USA v.
Gibson (1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 577, 580.)
 
The
unopposed petition is therefore granted.
 
Petitioner
to submit a proposed judgment.
 
Petitioner
to provide notice.
