Here is a summary of the tentative ruling:

**Case Number:** 22STCV21275

**Hearing Date:** May 9, 2024

**Department:** 68

**Case Summary:**

The case involves a plaintiff, Ava Naieini, who alleges gender, ethnic, and religious discrimination in a workplace in the computer software industry. The plaintiff filed a series of amended complaints, which the defendant, Confluent, Inc., has demurred to. The court has reviewed the pleadings and finds that the plaintiff's allegations of harassment, discrimination, and retaliation are insufficient to state a cause of action.

**6th Cause of Action: Harassment in Violation of Gov’t Code 12940, et seq.**

The court finds that the plaintiff has not presented sufficient evidence of sexual harassment. The allegations presented in the complaint are mostly verbal and do not rise to the level of sexual harassment. The plaintiff has not shown that the alleged harassment was "sufficiently pervasive to create a hostile or offensive work environment."

**Legal Analysis:**

The court quotes relevant case law, including Fisher v. San Pedro Peninsula Hospital (1989) 214 Cal.App.3d 590, 609-610, which states that a hostile work environment must be shown to exist through a "concerted pattern of harassment." The court finds that the plaintiff has not presented sufficient evidence to demonstrate a hostile work environment.

**Conclusion:**

The court sustains the demurrer to the 6th cause of action for Harassment in Violation of Gov’t Code 12940, et seq. The plaintiff has not presented sufficient evidence to state a cause of action for sexual harassment. The court will consider the other causes of action in the amended complaint.
