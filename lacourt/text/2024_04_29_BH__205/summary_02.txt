And here is the English text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the defendant's motion to vacate the entry of default. The defendant, Simon Nicholson-Pile, claims he was not personally served with the summons and complaint or the statement of damages. The plaintiff, Cassandra Jimenez, argues that even if the defendant was not personally served, he received actual notice on February 13, 2024. However, the judge concludes that the defendant has presented evidence to contradict the rebuttable presumption of proper service. The judge also finds that the plaintiff has failed to show it will be prejudiced by a trial on the merits. Therefore, the judge grants the defendant's motion to vacate the entry of default and the defendant's proposed answer is deemed filed.
