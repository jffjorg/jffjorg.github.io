```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has considered the motion to compel responses to discovery requests and the late opposition filed by the defendant. The court finds that the defendant's failure to serve timely responses was due to the inadvertence of its counsel, but that the defendant has now provided responses without objections. As a result, the court finds that the motion to compel responses is moot. However, the court still has the authority to hear the motion and impose sanctions. The court finds that the plaintiff is entitled to monetary sanctions in the amount of $600 for each of the four discovery motions, representing 2 hours of attorney time at a rate of $300 per hour. The court orders the defendant's counsel to pay the total amount of $2,400 in monetary sanctions to the plaintiff and her counsel within 30 days.
