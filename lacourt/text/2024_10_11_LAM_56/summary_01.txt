Summary of the tentative ruling:

The Court has considered the moving party's Motion for Summary Adjudication, which pertains to the fourth cause of action for disgorgement of payments. The Court has found that the evidence presented by the parties shows that during the relevant time period, the Defendant was unlicensed, and therefore, the Defendant's contention that he was actively licensed during that time period is not supported. The Court has granted summary adjudication as to the fourth cause of action for disgorgement of payments, ruling that the Defendant is not entitled to judgment as a matter of law.
