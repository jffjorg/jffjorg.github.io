Significant Statements:
  - "Malice" is defined as conduct intended to cause injury to a person or despicable conduct carried on with a willful and conscious disregard for the rights or safety of others.
  - "Oppression" means despicable conduct subjecting a person to cruel and unjust hardship, in conscious disregard of the person's rights.
  - "Fraud" is an intentional misrepresentation, deceit, or concealment of a material fact known by the defendant, with intent to deprive a person of property, rights, or otherwise cause injury.
  - Punitive damages are not available for mere breaches of contract, no matter how gross or willful.
  - To the extent plaintiff asserts his claims against defendant on the basis of a tortious act, it is clear that a demand for punitive damages for the commission of any tort requires more than the mere allegation of the "wrongfully and intentionally," "oppression, fraud, and malice" sort of language found in Civil Code ยง 3294.
  - The allegations of fact must, in their totality, describe a state of mind and a motive that would sustain an award of punitive damages.
