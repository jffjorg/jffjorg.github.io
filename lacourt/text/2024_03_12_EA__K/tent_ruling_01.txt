1.         Minor’s Compromise (i.e., as to Uriel Gallegos)
Legal Standard
Court approval is required for all settlements of a minor’s
claim.  (Prob. Code §§ 3500, 3600, et seq.; Code Civ. Proc., §
372.)  California Rules of Court Rule 7.950 provides that a petition “must be
verified by the petitioner and must contain a full disclosure of all
information that has any bearing upon the reasonableness of the
compromise.”  (See Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 7.950.)  Rule 7.950 states that the Petition must be
filed on a completed Petition for Approval of Compromise of Claim or Action
or Disposition of Proceeds of Judgment for Minor or Person With a Disability (form
MC-350).
Discussion
Petitioner Ana Gallegos (“Petitioner”) seeks court approval
of a settlement between minor claimant Uriel Gallegos (“Claimant”) (DOB:
11/3/06), Avatech and Jin in the total amount of $40,000.00. (Petition, ¶ 10)[1]. Note:
Although Petitioner represents that Avatech and Jin “have offered to pay”
Claimant $40,000.00 (Id., ¶ 10(a)), a review of the petition in full reflects
that Claimant is not receiving $40,000.00 in settlement, but only
$2,000.00 and that the $40,000.00 settlement amount is being apportioned as
follows: $34,000.00 to Petitioner and $2,000.00 each to Claimant and Claimant’s
two brothers, before a $13,333.33[2]
reduction for a workers’ compensation lien. (Id., ¶ 11b.(5) and Attachment
11b(6).) Petitioner is Claimant’s parent and guardian ad litem. (Id.,
¶ 1).
The petition is executed by Petitioner. The petition
explains that on February 12, 2019, Petitioner’s husband and Claimant’s father,
Rogelio, was driving an International 4700 box-truck on the I-605 freeway in
Irwindale, California, and was cut off by a Dodge Dart driven by Jin as he was
exiting the freeway. (Id., ¶¶ 4-5). Jin was in the course and scope of
his employment with Avatech at the time. (Id., ¶ 5). The box-truck
struck Jin’s vehicle and rolled over. (Id.) Rogelio was ejected from the
box-truck and pronounced deceased at the scene. (Id.)
As a result of Rogelio’s death, Claimant suffered loss of
comfort, care, society, emotional support, advice, solace, financial support,
gifts and other related special and general damages. (Id., ¶ 6). These
injuries and damages are permanent but have not physically manifested. (Id.,
¶ 8(c), Attachment 8.) Claimant was not physically harmed as a result of the
incident from which the cause of action arises, nor was he present at the scene
of the accident. (Id.) Claimant has not received any medical, psychological
or other professional treatment as a result of the loss of his father. (Id.,
¶ 7).
The total amount offered by all defendants to others is
$38,000.00, which will be paid as follows: $34,000.00 to Petitioner, $2,000.00
to Claimant’s brother Christian and $2,000.00 to Claimant’s brother Alejandro. (Id., ¶ 11(b).)[3] Petitioner askes that the court
award equal amounts to Rogelio’s issue and award her a greater amount since
Petitioner is now charged with the responsibility of providing support to
Claimant, Co-Claimant, and their brother, Alejandro, who still lives at home. (Id.)
Claimant did not incur any medical expenses. (Id., ¶
12). Claimant’s counsel waives any attorney’s fees in connection with this
Petition, but expects to be compensated for any further compensation that is
awarded or received that arises from the death of Claimant’s father, which
includes a claim against the Uninsured Motorist (“UIM”) coverage held by
Claimant’s father’s employer, RPSS, Inc., in the amount of $1 million. (Id.,
¶ 17(f), Attachment 17f). Claimant explains that that claim has not yet been
perfected because a precursor to UIM coverage is the payment of funds under an
insufficient policy, which is the policy here at issue. (Id.)
The net balance of proceeds for Claimant after payment of
all requested fees and expenses is $2,000.00, which will be deposited in an
insured account at Bank of America in Hesperia. (Id., ¶ 18, Attachment 18a(3)(a).)
The court finds the settlement is fair and reasonable. The
petition is granted.
2.         Minor’s Compromise (i.e., as to Christian Gallegos)
Legal Standard
See
Petition #1, above.
Discussion
Petitioner Ana Gallegos (“Petitioner”) seeks court approval
of a settlement between minor claimant Christian Gallegos (“Claimant”) (DOB:
4/3/08), Avatech and Jin in the total amount of $40,000.00. (Petition, ¶ 10)[4]. Note:
Again, although Petitioner represents that Avatech and Jin “have offered to
pay” Claimant $40,000.00 (Id., ¶ 10(a)), a review of the petition in full
reflects that Claimant is not receiving $40,000.00 in settlement, but
only $2,000.00 and that the $40,000.00 settlement amount is being apportioned
as follows: $34,000.00 to Petitioner and $2,000.00 each to Claimant and
Claimant’s two brothers, before a $13,333.33[5]
reduction for a workers’ compensation lien. (Id., ¶ 11b.(5) and Attachment
11b(6).) Petitioner is Claimant’s parent and guardian ad litem. (Id.,
¶ 1).
The petition is executed by Petitioner. See synopsis of
nature of accident in Petition #1.
As a result of Rogelio’s death, Claimant suffered loss of
comfort, care, society, emotional support, advice, solace, financial support,
gifts and other related special and general damages. (Id., ¶ 6). These
injuries and damages are permanent but have not physically manifested. (Id.,
¶ 8(c), Attachment 8.) Claimant was not physically harmed as a result of the
incident from which the cause of action arises, nor was he present at the scene
of the accident. (Id.) Claimant has not received any medical, psychological
or other professional treatment as a result of the loss of his father. (Id.,
¶ 7).
The total amount offered by all defendants to others is
$38,000.00, which will be paid as follows: $34,000.00 to Petitioner, $2,000.00
to Claimant’s brother Uriel and $2,000.00 to Claimant’s brother Alejandro. (Id.,
¶ 11(b).)[6]
Petitioner askes that the court award equal amounts to Rogelio’s issue and
award her a greater amount since Petitioner is now charged with the
responsibility of providing support to Claimant, Co-Claimant, and their
brother, Alejandro, who still lives at home. (Id.)
Claimant did not incur any medical expenses. (Id., ¶
12). Claimant’s counsel waives any attorney’s fees in connection with this
Petition, but expects to be compensated for any further compensation that is
awarded or received that arises from the death of Claimant’s father, which
includes a claim against the Uninsured Motorist (“UIM”) coverage held by
Claimant’s father’s employer, RPSS, Inc., in the amount of $1 million. (Id.,

The court finds the settlement is fair and reasonable. The
petition is granted.
