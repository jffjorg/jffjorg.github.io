from Avatech and the remaining $25,000.00 is from Geico Insurance Company for
Jin. (Petition, ¶ 10). The settlement agreement is attached as Attachment 10. (Id.)



[2]           The
petition filed November 29, 2023 identifies the workers’ compensation lien as
$25,000.00. Attachment 11b(6) explained that in an arbitration that was out of
the civil litigation, and which did not involve or include Petitioner, Claimant
and Claimant’s brothers, the arbitrator awarded the worker’s compensation
carrier for Rogelio’s employer $25,000.00, the amount of Jin’s policy. (Petition.,
¶ 11(b), Attachment 11b(6).) The worker’s compensation payments were for death
benefits to Petitioner. As part of the settlement agreement, Petitioner
reserved her right to negotiate, reduce, and/or litigate the lien for
reimbursement of workers’ compensation benefits, which was, at the time the
petition was filed, $25,000.00 under the arbitration. (Id.) The worker’s
compensation carrier paid a total of approximately $280,000.00 in benefits. (Id.)

 
Petitioner
advised that she “continue[d to attempt to negotiate the workers’ compensation
lien, but the carrier [was] unresponsive, to date.” (Id.) Petitioner represented
that she would file an additional declaration prior to the hearing regarding
the status of the workers’ compensation lien, as well as any negotiations,
stipulations, or status changes in that regard. (Id.) 
 
On
February 13, 2024, Petitioner’s counsel Patrick B. Embrey (“Embrey”) filed a
declaration, advising therein that following the filing of the Petition,
Petitioner’s counsel was able to negotiate a reduction of the workers’
compensation lien from $25,000.00 to $13,333.33. (Embrey Decl., ¶ 5). Embrey
further advised that the lien reduction would not affect the amount going to
Claimant on the Petition, since the entire lien was to be paid through the
settlement amount attributable to Petitioner. (Id., ¶ 6).
 
 
 


[3]           Again,
the $13,333.33 workers’ compensation lien is to be paid out from Petitioner’s
paid through the settlement amount attributable to Petitioner. (Petition, ¶
13(b); Embrey Decl., ¶ 6).
