```

And here is the English summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has reviewed the petition and settlement agreement filed by Jin, which details a dispute over a workers' compensation lien in the amount of $25,000.00. The lien was awarded to the workers' compensation carrier in an arbitration that did not involve Jin or her brothers. Jin's counsel, Patrick B. Embrey, was able to negotiate a reduction of the lien from $25,000.00 to $13,333.33. The judge notes that the lien reduction will not affect the amount going to Claimant on the petition, as the entire lien will be paid through the settlement amount attributable to Jin. The judge intends to resolve the workers' compensation lien dispute fairly and distribute the settlement amount accordingly.
