```

And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the motion to consolidate the case with related cases. The court finds that the cases do not involve common questions of law and fact, and therefore, consolidation would not be appropriate. The court notes that the plaintiffs in both cases are tenants of the same property and have similar legal claims against the defendant, but the facts and events giving rise to the claims are different. The court concludes that it would not be more efficient to consolidate the cases than to have them tried separately.
