And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling on a motion for leave to file a cross-complaint. The defendants, Eleanna Laba and Elias Laba, filed a motion to file a cross-complaint against Taylor Alexandria Williams for equitable indemnity, contribution, and declaratory relief. The motion is based on the fact that defense counsel failed to file a cross-complaint at the time the answer was filed because they did not realize the involvement of Williams in the motor vehicle accident. The court finds that the motion should be granted because the defense counsel acted in good faith and the proposed cross-complaint is attached to the supporting declaration. The defendants are granted permission to file and serve the cross-complaint within 20 days of this order.
