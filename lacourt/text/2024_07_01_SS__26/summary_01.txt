Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge is continuing the Motion for Assignment Order filed by Creditors Adjudgment Bureau, Inc. (Judgment Creditor) until September 9, 2024. By August 12, 2024, Judgment Creditor must file and serve a supplemental declaration correcting the defects noted in the document. The Court is requiring this additional declaration because Judgment Creditor has not demonstrated that the assignment of unique National Provider Identifiers (NPIs) to Judgment Debtors means they have rights to payments that are or will become due from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and Noridian Healthcare Solutions, LLC. The Court is concerned that Judgment Creditor's supporting declaration is based on information and belief rather than positive averment.
