ANALYSIS:  
 
On March 9, 2023,
Plaintiff Creditors Adjudgment Bureau, Inc. (“Judgment Creditor”)
filed this action against Defendants Olympus ADHC, Inc. Dba National Adult Day
Care adba Olympus Adult Day Health Center adba National Adult Day Health
Center; and RJR Care, Inc. dba National Adult Day Care adba Olympus Adult Day
Health Center (“Judgment Debtor). On July 21, 2023, this Court entered default
judgment against Judgment Debtors for the total amount of $17,269.40.

 
Judgment Creditor filed the instant Motion for an Assignment
Order on March 27, 2024. No opposition has been filed to date. 
 
Discussion
 
Under Code of Civil Procedure, section 708.510, subdivision
(a), the moving statute, the Court may order the judgment debtor to assign to
the judgment creditor or to an appointed receiver all or part of a right to
payment due or to become due. The types of payments that can be assigned
include wages due from the federal government if not subject to a withholding
order, rents, commissions, royalties, patent or copyright payments, and
insurance policy loan value. (Code Civ. Proc., § 708.510, subd. (a).)
 
Relevant factors the Court may take into consideration when
making an assignment order include the judgment debtor’s reasonable
requirements if they are a natural person, payments the judgment debtor is
required to make to satisfy other judgments and wage assignments, the amount
remaining due on the judgment, and the amount to be received in satisfaction of
the right to payment that may be assigned. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 708.510, subd. (c).) Construing all the
applicable statutes together, the “assignment order” contemplated by Code of
Civil Procedure, section 708.510, et seq.
must include a court order that assigns a right to payment outright (not simply
an order directing the judgment debtor to do so).  
 
Here, Judgment Creditor seeks an order instructing
the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and Noridian
Healthcare Solutions, LLC, a regional Medicare payment intermediary, to pay all
Medicare reimbursements and payments on claims submitted by Judgment Debtors to
Judgment Creditor. (Motion, p. 2:1-8.) 
 
On July 21, 2023, judgment was entered in Judgment
Creditor’s favor and against Judgment Debtors in the amount of $17,269.40. (Motion, Frischer
Decl., ¶2 and Exh. 1.) Judgment Debtors have made no payment towards the
judgment; meanwhile, interest on the judgment is accruing at $4.73 per day. (Id.
at ¶4.) The total amount owed to Judgment Creditor as of the filing of this
Motion is $18,905.98. (Ibid.) The Motion contends that Judgment Debtors
have rights to payments that are or will become due from the Centers for
Medicare and Medicaid Services and Noridian Healthcare Solutions, LLC. (Id.
at ¶6.) In support of this contention, the Motion demonstrates that Judgment
Debtors have been assigned unique National Provider Identifiers (“NPIs”) by the
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for their administrative and
financial transactions. (Id. at ¶7 and Exhs. 2-3.) Judgment Creditor,
however, has not shown that the assignment of unique NPIs to Judgment Debtors means
they have rights to payments that are or will become due from the Centers for
Medicare and Medicaid Services and Noridian Healthcare Solutions, LLC. Indeed,
the supporting declaration of Judgment Creditor’s counsel only asserts such a
right to payment based on information and belief. (Id. at ¶¶7-8.) While
“there are numerous exceptions to the general rule prohibiting affidavits on
information and belief, either where the facts to be established are incapable
of positive averment, or where expressly permitted by statute,” Judgment
Creditor has not demonstrated that those exceptions apply in this case. (See City
of Santa Cruz v. Municipal Court (1989) 49 Cal.3d 74, 87.) 
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing, Judgment Creditor’s Motion for
Assignment Order is CONTINUED TO SEPTEMBER 9, 2024 AT 10:00 AM IN DEPARTMENT 26
IN THE SPRING STREET COURTHOUSE. BY AUGUST 12, 2024, JUDGMENT CREDITOR IS TO
FILE AND SERVE A SUPPLEMENTAL DECLARATION CORRECTING THE DEFECTS NOTED HEREIN.
FAILURE TO DO SO MAY RESULT IN THE MOTION BEING DENIED.
