And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling requires the plaintiffs to provide additional evidence to prove their damages in support of their request for a court judgment. The plaintiffs are seeking a judgment against Paul A. Monney, individually and as One Real Estate Inspectors, for his alleged failure to disclose known material defects in a residential property. The plaintiffs claim that Monney's inspection report contained material misrepresentations and that they incurred $65,000 in repair costs as a result. However, the plaintiffs have not provided evidence to support this claim, and the judge has ordered them to submit a supplemental declaration and documentary evidence of their damages at least 10 days prior to the hearing. The hearing is continued to June 4, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. in Department A of the Compton Courthouse.
