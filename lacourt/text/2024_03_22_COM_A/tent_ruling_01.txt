[TENTATIVE] ORDER REQUIRING
ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE TO PROVE DAMAGES IN SUPPORT OF PLAINTIFFS’ REQUEST FOR
COURT JUDGMENT 
 
      This action arises from Plaintiffs’
purchase of residential real property from Redwood Holdings. Plaintiffs sue all
Defendants for their alleged failure to disclose known material defects.  
      In the main action, all parties have been
dismissed except Paul A. Monney, individually, and dba One Real Estate
Inspectors (“Defendant”), whose default was entered on May 5, 2022, and against
whom Plaintiffs request a court judgment.
      Plaintiffs allege they hired Defendant
Monney to conduct a home inspection prior to close of escrow. Plaintiffs allege
that Defendant breached the applicable duty of care by failing to discover significant
 defects and conditions in the home. 
      Plaintiffs allege that Defendant’s
inspection report contained material misrepresentations of fact – namely that
the home was in good or fair condition when the true facts were that the home
had significant defects. Plaintiffs allege claims for violation of Bus. and
Prof. Code § 7196 (inspector’s standard of care), negligent misrepresentation,
and professional negligence against Defendant Monney.     
      While a defaulting defendant confesses the
material terms of the complaint that are well pleaded, a plaintiff must submit
evidence of facts “concerning the damages alleged in the complaint.” (Petty v. Manpower, Inc. (1979) 94 Cal.App.3d 794, 798; HSBC Bank Nevada, N.A. v. Aguilar (2012) 205 Cal.App.4th Supp. 6, 12 Carlsen v. Koivumaki (2014) 227 Cal.App.4th 879, 899–900; Carlsen v. Koivumaki (2014) 227 Cal.App.4th 879, 899–900.) Damages not fixed
by contract must be proved. (Petty v. Manpower, Inc. (1979) 94 Cal.App.3d 794, 798.)
      Plaintiffs contend they spent a total of
$65,000 making repairs that should have been identified by Defendant. (Luis
Garcia decl., ¶ 8.) Plaintiffs offset their principal damages by the amount obtained
in settlement with other parties, leaving a principal balance of $24,000.[1]
Plaintiffs submit an estimate of repairs totaling $165,000 but no evidence that
they incurred repair expenses totaling $65,000. (Mot. Ex. 4.) Plaintiffs have
not provided evidence of other settlements applied to offset Plaintiffs’
recovery. 
      Accordingly, the Court continues the
hearing on the Order to Show Cause re: Default to June 4,
 2024 , at 8:30 a.m. in Department A of the Compton Courthouse.
Plaintiffs are ordered to submit at least 10 days prior to the hearing (or
earlier) a supplemental declaration and documentary evidence proving their
damages incurred as a result of Defendant’s conduct, and evidence of the
amounts obtained in settlement.
