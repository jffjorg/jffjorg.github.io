Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the defendant's motion to quash service of summons. The defendant, Stylenquaza LLC, a Texas-based company, argued that the court lacks personal jurisdiction over it. The court found that the defendant had no systematic contacts with California and did not advertise or market its products in the state. Although the defendant distributed some quartz slabs to California from 2018 to 2022, this was not enough to establish personal jurisdiction. The plaintiff, Rodolfo Garcia-Rosas and Alma Delia Llamas, failed to establish that their claims arose from or related to the defendant's contacts with California. The court therefore lacks personal jurisdiction over the defendant.
