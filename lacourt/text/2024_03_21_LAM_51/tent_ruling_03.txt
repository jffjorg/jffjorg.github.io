to be Relieved as Counsel is GRANTED.
STATEMENT OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS: 
 
On April 14, 2023, Plaintiff Quetzal Salcido, as
Administrator of Patricia Salcido-Alvonistis’s Estate (Plaintiff) filed a
Complaint against Defendants Eric Maritrosyan and E&E Ristorante Group,
Inc. (Defendant) for breach of contract. According to the Complaint, the
parties entered into a written lease on July 12, 2013.1 Defendants failed to pay rent since October 2020 and
failed to pay any property taxes as required by the lease. Plaintiff attached a
copy of the lease. 
 
Cross-Complainants filed a First Amended Cross-Complaint
(FACC) on August 8, 2023, with two causes of action for: (1) Breach of Lease;
and (2) Fraud in the Inducement.  
 
Cross-Complainants allege that they entered a lease with
Patricia Salcido Alvonitis (Patricia) on July 15, 2013, to operate a restaurant
at 2861 W. Sunset Boulevard, Los Angeles, CA 90026 (Premises).
Cross-Complainant alleges that due to a confidentiality term they did not
attach the lease to their Cross-Complaint. The Premises needed serious and
substantial capital improvements and repairs. Cross-Complainants allege that
prior to entering into the lease, they and Patricia discussed the Premises’
condition in person and by phone. During these conversations, Patricia told
Cross-Complainants that if they were willing to finance full remodeling of the
Premises, then (a) they would be given the right to extend the lease a
five-year option term, (b) if any repair (not maintenance) was necessary during
the tenancy it would be split 50/50, and (c) any repair or replacement of any
part of the Premises apart from the building would solely be Lessor’s
responsibility (collectively, the Representations).  
 
On September 26, 2023, Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant filed a
Demurrer to the First Amended Cross-Complaint.
 
On February 1, 2024, the court continued the hearing on the
Demurrer to the First Amended Cross-Complaint to February 29, 2024 as a motion
setting date. The court also set a Case Management Conference and Status
Conference re: Status of Counsel for Plaintiff on that same date.
 
On February 2, 2024, Attorney Frazee filed a Declaration in
Support of Attorney’s Motion to be Relieved as Counsel.
 
On February 5, 2024, Attorney Frazee filed the instant
Motion to be Relieved as Counsel.
 
On February 29, 2024, the court continued the hearing on
Attorney Frazee’s Motion to be Relieved as Counsel to March 21, 2024 to ensure
compliance with California Rules of Court.
 
On March 1, 2024, Attorney Frazee filed proof of service
indicating service of the Motion to be Relieved as Counsel on February 2, 2024,
as well as Notice of the Court’s February 29, 2024 Ruling.
 
LEGAL STANDARD: 
 
The court may order that an attorney be changed or
substituted at any time before or after judgment or final determination upon
request by either client or attorney and after notice from one to the other.¿¿
(Code of Civ. Proc., § 284,¿subd. (b).)¿ An attorney is permitted to withdraw
where conflicts between the attorney and client make it unreasonable to
continue the representation.¿ (See Cal. Rules of Prof. Conduct 3-700(C)(1).)¿
“The determination whether to grant or deny a motion to withdraw as counsel
lies within the sound discretion of the trial court.” (Manfredi & Levine v. Superior Court¿(1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128,
1133.)¿¿¿ 
¿ 
An application to be relieved as counsel must be made on
Judicial Counsel Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion) (Cal. Rules of Court
3.1362(a)), MC-052 (Declaration) (Cal. Rules of Court 3.1362(c)), and MC-053
(Proposed Order) (Cal. Rules of Court 3.1362(e)).¿¿¿ 
¿ 
Further, the requisite forms must be served on the client
and all other parties who have appeared in the case.¿ (Cal. Rules of Court
3.1362(d).)¿ The court may delay effective date of the order relieving counsel
until proof of service of a copy of the signed order on the client has been
filed with the court.¿ (Cal. Rules of Court 3.1362(e).)¿ 
 
ANALYSIS: 
 
Attorney RoseAnn Frazee moves to be relieved as counsel for
Plaintiff Quetzal Salcido, as Administrator of
Patricia Salcido-Alvonistis’s Estate. Attorney Frazee indicates that the
client fired her and she has been unable to secure a Substitution of Attorney
for the new counsel, that Client would not respond to communications from
attorney, and would not confirm his address. Attorney Frazee indicates they
mailed the instant motion and supporting documents to Client’s last known
address on February 2, 2024.
 
Accordingly, the court GRANTS Attorney Frazee’s motion to
be relieved as counsel.
 
CONCLUSION:
 
            For
the foregoing reasons, the Court decides the pending motion as follows: 
 
1.Motion to be Relieved as Counsel
is GRANTED.
Moving party is to give notice. 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
