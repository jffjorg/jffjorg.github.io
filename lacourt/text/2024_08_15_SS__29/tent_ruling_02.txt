Background
On December 18, 2020, Pedro Gaona (“Plaintiff”)
filed a complaint against Ayush Pandey, Enterprise Rent-A-Car Company, EAN
Holding, and Does 1 to 25 for motor vehicle negligence and general negligence
causes of action arising from an automobile accident occurring on December 29,
2018.
On April 13, 2023, Enterprise Rent-A-Car Company
of Los Angeles, LLC (erroneously sued as Enterprise Rent-A-Car Company) (“Enterprise”)
and EAN Holdings, LLC (erroneously sued as EAN Holding) (“EAN”) filed answers
to the complaint.
On April 11 and 12, 2024, Enterprise and EAN
(collectively, “Defendants”) filed four motions to compel initial responses to
discovery.  One motion, relating to EAN’s
Special Interrogatories (Set One), was heard and granted on June 3.  The remaining three motions were initially
set for hearing on July 8, and the hearing was continued to August 15.
No opposition has been filed. 
Legal
Standard
 A party
must respond to interrogatories within 30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2030.260, subd.(a).) If a party to whom interrogatories are directed
does not provide a timely response, the propounding party may move for an order
compelling response to the interrogatories. (Id., § 2030.290, subd.
(b).) There is no time limit for a motion to compel initial responses, and no
meet and confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2030.290; Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007)
148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules
of Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who fails to
provide a timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).)
When a party moves to compel initial responses
to interrogatories, “the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the motion], unless it finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (c).)
A party must respond to requests for production of
documents within 30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260,
subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests for production of documents are directed
does not provide timely written responses, the requesting party may move for an
order compelling response to the demand. (Id., § 2031.300, subd. (b).)
There is no time limit for a motion to compel initial responses, and no meet
and confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2031.300; Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a
party who fails to provide a timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a).) 
When a party moves to compel initial responses to
requests for production, “the court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the motion], unless it finds that
the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that
other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd.
(c).)
In Chapter 7 of the Civil Discovery Act, Code of
Civil Procedure section 2023.010, subdivision (d), defines “[m]isuses of the
discovery process” to include “[f]ailing to respond to or to submit to an
authorized method of discovery.”  Where a party or attorney has engaged
in misuse of the discovery process, the court may impose a monetary sanction in
the amount of “the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by
anyone as a result of that conduct.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2023.020, subd. (a).)
Discussion
On February 11, 2024, Enterprise propounded Form
Interrogatories (Set One), Special Interrogatories (Set One), and Requests for
Production (Set One) on Plaintiff. (Boyd Decls., ¶ 4 & Exh. A.)  Plaintiff
did not respond.
Defendants need not show anything more.
The Court GRANTS Defendants’ motions to compel.
Defendants’ request for sanctions are
DENIED. The applicable statutes authorize the imposition of sanctions
against a party or counsel who “unsuccessfully makes or opposes” a motion to
compel initial responses.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (c)
& § 2031.300, subd. (c).)  Plaintiff has not opposed the motion.
Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.030,
subdivision (a), does not provide an independent basis to award sanctions; the
sanctions award must be “authorized by the chapter governing any particular
discovery method or any other provision of this title.”  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2023.030.)
