Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Walmart's motion for terminating sanctions against Stephanie E. Wantuch. The motion was filed after Wantuch failed to respond to Walmart's discovery requests, despite a court order to do so. The judge found that Wantuch's conduct constitutes serious discovery abuse, but has not shown a history or pattern of willful abuse or repeated violations that would warrant a terminating sanction. The judge also noted that a terminating sanction would create a "windfall" for Walmart, as Wantuch would not be able to prosecute her claims on the merits if the case were dismissed. The judge ordered that the motion be denied and that Wantuch be given notice.
