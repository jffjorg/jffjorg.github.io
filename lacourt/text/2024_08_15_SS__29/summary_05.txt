And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiffs' motion to set aside the dismissal of their action. The plaintiffs had filed a complaint against the defendants in 2021, and the defendants had filed an answer in 2022. However, the plaintiffs failed to appear at a hearing on January 22, 2024, and the action was dismissed without prejudice. The plaintiffs then filed a motion to set aside the dismissal, citing the mistake and inadvertence of their counsel in failing to calendar the hearing. The judge has found that the plaintiffs have shown sufficient cause for relief under Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b), and has granted the motion. The judge has also ordered the plaintiffs' counsel to pay $100 to the State Bar Client Security Fund and to file proof of payment with the court by October 14, 2024. The court has set an Order to Show Cause re Dismissal for October __, 2024, at 8:30 a.m., in Department 29 of the Spring Street Courthouse.
