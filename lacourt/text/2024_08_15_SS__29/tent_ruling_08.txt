Background
On
September 27, 2022, Angel Contreras (“Plaintiff”) filed the complaint in this
action against Mario Lua (“Lua”), Numark Transportation, Inc. (“Numark”), and
Does 1 through 25, asserting causes of action for motor vehicle negligence and
general negligence arising out of an accident occurring on February 17, 2022,
on the 710 Freeway near Washington Boulevard in Commerce.  
Lua and
Numark filed their answers on July 21, 2023, and January 16, 2024.
On
February 17, 2024, Numark served Plaintiff with discovery, including Form
Interrogatories (Set Two), Requests for Production (Set Three), and Requests
for Admission (Set One).  Plaintiff served
response on March 27.  Numark contended
that the responses were not code compliant and met and conferred.  The parties were not able to resolve their
disagreements.
On June
11 and 13, 2024, Numark filed these three motions, seeking further responses to
the discovery and sanctions.  Plaintiff
filed a combined opposition on August 2, and Numark filed a combined reply on
August 8.
The
parties participated in an Informal Discovery Conference (“IDC”) on August 1,
2024.  At the IDC, counsel reported that
all issues other than sanctions have been resolved.  
Legal Standard
“On receipt of a response to interrogatories, the propounding
party may move for an order compelling a further response if the propounding
party deems that any of the following apply: (1) An answer to a particular
interrogatory is evasive or incomplete. (2) An exercise of the option to
produce documents under Section 2030.230 is unwarranted or the required
specification of those documents is inadequate. (3) An objection to an
interrogatory is without merit or too general.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (a).)
Notice of a motion to compel further responses must be given
“within 45 days of the service of the verified response, or any supplemental
verified response, or on or before any specific later date to which the
propounding party and the responding party have agreed in writing.” (Id.,
subd. (c).)
A motion to compel further responses must be accompanied by a meet-and-confer
declaration and a separate statement or, in the discretion of the Court, a
“concise outline of the discovery request and each response in dispute.” (Id.,
subd. (b)(1) & (b)(2); Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345.)
“The court shall
impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010)
against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion
to compel a further response to interrogatories, unless it finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (d).)
“On receipt of a response to a demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling, the demanding party may move for an order compelling
further response to the demand if the demanding party deems that any of the
following apply: (1) A statement of compliance with the demand is
incomplete.  (2) A representation of
inability to comply is inadequate, incomplete, or evasive.  (3) An objection in the response is without
merit or too general.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2031.310, subd. (a).)
Notice of a motion to compel further responses must be given
“within 45 days of the service of the verified response, or any supplemental
verified response, or on or before any specific later date to which the
propounding party and the responding party have agreed in writing.” (Id.,
subd. (c).)
A motion to compel further responses must set forth specific
facts showing good cause for the discovery and must be accompanied by a meet-and-confer
declaration and a separate statement or, in the discretion of the Court, a
“concise outline of the discovery request and each response in dispute.” (Id.,
subd. (b)(1)-(3); Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345.)
“[T]he court shall
impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010)
against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a
motion to compel further response to a demand, unless it finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (h).)
“On receipt of a response to requests for admissions, the
party requesting admissions may move for an order compelling a further response
if that party deems that either or both of the following apply: (1) An answer
to a particular request is evasive or incomplete. (2) An objection to a
particular request is without merit or too general.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.290, subd.
(a).)
Notice of a motion to compel further responses must be given
“within 45 days of the service of the verified response, or any supplemental
verified response, or any specific later date to which the requesting party and
the responding party have agreed in writing.” (Id., subd. (c).)
A motion to compel further responses must be accompanied by a meet-and-confer
declaration and a separate statement or, in the discretion of the Court, a
“concise outline of the discovery request and each response in dispute.” (Id.,
subd. (b)(1) & (b)(2); Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345.)
“The court shall
impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010)
against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a
motion to compel further response, unless it finds that the one subject to the
sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make
the imposition of the sanction unjust.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.290, subd. (d).)
In Chapter 7 of the
Civil Discovery Act, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.030, subdivision (a)
provides, in pertinent part, that the court may impose a monetary sanction ordering
that any person “engaging in the misuse of the discovery process, or any
attorney advising that conduct, or both pay the reasonable expenses, including
attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct.” A “misuse of
the discovery process” includes (among other things) failing to respond or to
submit to an authorized method of discovery; making, without substantial
justification, an unmeritorious objection to discovery; making an evasive
response to a discovery request; disobeying a court order to provide discovery;
and making or opposing, unsuccessfully, a motion to compel without substantial
justification. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subds. (d)-(h).)
Discussion
The parties reported at the IDC that all issues other than
sanctions have been resolved. 
Accordingly, the motions to compel further responses are denied as moot.
The Court denies Numark’s requests for sanctions.
According to Numark’s notices of motions and motions, Numark
seeks sanctions under Code of Civil Procedure sections 2023.010; 2023.020;
2023.030; 2023.040; 2023.050; 2030.290, subdivision (c); 2031.010; 2031.310; and
2033.290, subdivision (d).
Section 2023.010 defines the term “Misuses of the discovery
process” but does not itself authorize sanctions.
Section 2023.020 authorizes sanctions against a party or
attorney “who fails to confer as required.” 
The Court has reviewed the factual record submitted by the parties and
finds that although the parties were not able to resolve the dispute, there was
no failure by Plaintiff to meet and confer.
Section 2023.030 provides for sanctions “[T]o the extent
authorized by the chapter governing any particular discovery method or any
other provision of this title [the Civil Discovery Act].”  It does not itself authorize sanctions.
Section 2023.040 sets forth the procedural requirements for a
request for sanctions.  It does not
itself authorize sanctions.
Section 2023.050 authorizes a sanction of $1,000 against a
party, person, or attorney who (1) does not respond in good faith to a request
for production of documents or an inspection demand; or (2) produces requested
documents within seven days of a scheduled hearing on a motion to compel; or
(3) fails to meet and confer in good faith with a party requesting documents,
unless the court finds in writing that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust.  The Court has
reviewed the factual record submitted by the parties and finds that although
the parties were not able to resolve the dispute, there was no failure by
Plaintiff to respond in good faith or to meet and confer.  Numark does not present any evidence that
Plaintiff produced requested documents within seven days of a scheduled
hearing.
Section 2031.010 does not authorize sanctions.
Sections 2030.290, subdivision (c), relates to failure to
provide an initial response to interrogatories. 
To the extent that this is a typographical error, and Numark intended to
reference section 2030.300, subdivision (d) sanctions are authorized only
against a party, person, or attorney “who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a
motion to compel a further response.”  Here,
the parties resolved their dispute, and as a result the Court is denying the
motion as moot.  Plaintiff did not unsuccessfully
make or oppose a motion to compel.
Similarly, section 2031.310, subdivision (h), and section 2033.290,
subdivision (d), authorize sanctions only against a party, person, or attorney “who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a further response.”  Here, Plaintiff did not unsuccessfully make or
oppose a motion to compel.
Finally, the Court recognizes that other provisions of the Civil
Discovery Act authorize sanctions even when a party has not unsuccessfully made
or opposed a motion to compel.  (E.g.,
Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2033.280, subd. (c) & 2025.450, subd. (g)(1).)  Where, as here, a party seeks sanctions under
sections 2030.300, 2031.310, and 2033.290, however, the Court must apply the
statutes as the Legislature has drafted them.
Conclusion
The Court DENIES as moot the motions to compel further
responses.
The Court DENIES the requests for sanctions.
Moving party to give notice.
