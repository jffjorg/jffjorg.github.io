And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled on two motions filed by the City of Los Angeles in this lawsuit. The first motion was to deem admitted certain requests for admission made by the City, which were not responded to by the plaintiff, Paul Tvedt, in a timely manner. The judge denied this motion because the plaintiff did serve a response to the requests for admission after the motion was filed, which was in substantial compliance with the relevant statute. However, the judge did grant the City's request for sanctions in the amount of $600 against the plaintiff and their counsel for failing to serve timely responses.

The second motion was to continue the trial date, which is currently set for September 18, 2024. The judge granted this motion because the City has a pending motion for summary judgment that was filed on June 3, 2024, and the court wants to hear this motion before the trial. The judge also found that good cause has been shown to continue the trial date to a date on or after June 16, 2025.
