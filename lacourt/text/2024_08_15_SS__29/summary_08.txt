```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motions to compel further responses as moot, as the parties have resolved their disputes through an informal discovery conference. The judge has also denied the requests for sanctions, finding that there was no failure by the plaintiff to respond in good faith or to meet and confer. The plaintiff filed responses to the discovery requests, and the defendant seeks sanctions for alleged failures by the plaintiff. The judge has reviewed the factual record and finds that there was no misuse of the discovery process by the plaintiff. The judge has applied the statutes as drafted by the Legislature and has not found any evidence of substantial justification or other circumstances that would make the imposition of sanctions unjust.
