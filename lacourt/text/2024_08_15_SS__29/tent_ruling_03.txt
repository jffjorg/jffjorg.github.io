Background
On January 11, 2021, Plaintiff Paul Tvedt (“Plaintiff”) filed the
complaint in this action, and on April 28, 2021, Plaintiff filed a First Amended
Complaint (“FAC”).  In the FAC, Plaintiff
asserts various causes of action against City of Los Angeles (“City”);
Department of Animal Services; East Valley Animal Shelter; Kathryn Shaughnessy
(“Shaughnessy”); and Does 1 through 100, arising out of an incident on May 16,
2020, in which, Plaintiff alleges, he was bitten by a dog.  Plaintiff alleges that the dog was owned by
the City’s Department of Animal Services and the dog was, at the time of the
incident, being walked by Defendant Shaughnessy.
On June 4, 2021, City filed an answer to the FAC and a
cross-complaint against Shaughnessy and Roes 1 through 10.
On July 8, 2021, Shaughnessy filed an answer to the FAC and to
City’s cross-complaint.  Shaughnessy also
filed a cross-complaint against City and Zoes 1 through 10.
On August 26, 2021, City filed an answer to Shaughnessy’s
cross-complaint.
On filing, the case was assigned a trial date of July 11,
2022.  On a series of stipulations, the
Court continued the trial to October 2023, December 2023, February 2024, and to
the current trial date of September 18, 2024.
There are currently two motions before the Court and set for
hearing on August 15.
First, on June 7, 2024, City filed a motion for an order
deeming Plaintiff to have admitted the truth of the matters specified in Requests
for Admission.  Plaintiff filed an
untimely opposition on July 11, and City filed a reply on the same day.  The hearing was initially set for July 17 and
was continued to August 15.
Second, on June 11, 2024, City filed a motion to continue
trial.  This motion is unopposed.  The hearing was initially set for July 19 and
was continued to August 15.
Legal Standards
Motion for Deemed Admitted Order
A party must
respond to requests for admission within 30 days after service. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.250, subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests for admission are directed
does not provide a timely response, the propounding party “may move for an
order that … the truth of [the] matters specified in the requests be deemed
admitted.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).) There is no time
limit for such a motion, and no meet and confer efforts are required. (See id.,
§ 2033.280; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement
be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who fails to provide a
timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (a).) 
The court “shall”
make the order that the truth of the matters specified in the request be deemed
admitted unless the court “finds that the party to whom the requests for
admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a
proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial
compliance with Section 2033.220.”  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c); see St. Mary v. Super. Ct. (2014)
223 Cal.App.4th 762, 778-780.)
“It is mandatory
that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a
timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion [to deem
admitted the truth of the matters specified in the requests for admission].”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd.
(c).)
In Chapter 7 of the Civil Discovery Act, Code of Civil
Procedure section 2023.010, subdivision (d), defines “[m]isuses of the
discovery process” to include “[f]ailing to respond to or to submit to an
authorized method of discovery.”  Where a
party or attorney has engaged in misuse of the discovery process, the court may
impose a monetary sanction in the amount of “the reasonable expenses, including
attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd.
(a).)
“[P]roviding untimely responses does not divest the trial court of
its authority [to hear a motion to compel responses].”  (Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc.,
supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at p. 407.) 
Even if the untimely response “does not contain objections [and]
substantially resolve[s] the issues raised by a motion to compel responses …
the trial court retains the authority to hear the motion.”¿ (Id. at pp. 408-409.)¿ This rule gives “an important
incentive for parties to respond to discovery in a timely fashion.”¿ (Id. at p. 408.)¿ If “the propounding
party [does not] take the motion off calendar or narrow its scope to the issue
of sanctions,” the trial court may “deny the motion to
compel responses as essentially unnecessary, in whole or in part, and just
impose sanctions.”¿ (Id. at p. 409.) “The court may award sanctions under the
Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery, even
though no opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to the motion was
withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party after
the motion was filed.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1348(a).) 
Motion to Continue Trial 
Code of Civil Procedure section 128,
subdivision (a)(8), provides that the court has the power to amend and control
its process and orders so as to make them conform to law and justice. “The
power to determine when a continuance should be granted is within the
discretion of the trial court.” (Color-Vue, Inc. v. Abrams (1996) 44
Cal.App.4th 1599, 1603.) “A trial court has wide latitude in the matter of
calendar control including the granting or denying of continuances.” (Park
Motors, Inc. v. Cozens (1975) 49 Cal.App.3d 12, 18.)  
“To ensure the prompt disposition of civil
cases, the dates assigned for trial are firm. 
All parties and their counsel must regard the date set for trial as
certain.”  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1332(a).)
“Although continuances of trials are
disfavored, each request for a continuance must be considered on its own
merits.”  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1332(c).)  “The court may grant a
continuance only on an affirmative showing of good cause requiring the
continuance.”  (Ibid.)  Circumstances that may support a finding of
good cause include:  
“(1) The
unavailability of an essential lay or expert witness because of death, illness,
or other excusable circumstances;  
(2) The
unavailability of a party because of death, illness, or other excusable
circumstances;  
(3) The
unavailability of trial counsel because of death, illness, or other excusable
circumstances;  
(4) The
substitution of trial counsel, but only where there is an affirmative showing
that the substitution is required in the interests of justice;  
(5) The addition
of a new party if: (A) The new party has not had a reasonable opportunity to
conduct discovery and prepare for trial; or (B) The other parties have not had
a reasonable opportunity to conduct discovery and prepare for trial in regard
to the new party's involvement in the case; 

(6) A party's
excused inability to obtain essential testimony, documents, or other material
evidence despite diligent efforts; or  
(7) A
significant, unanticipated change in the status of the case as a result of
which the case is not ready for trial.”  
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(c).)  
“In ruling on a motion or application for
continuance, the court must consider all the facts and circumstances that are
relevant to the determination.”  (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(d).)  California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(d) sets forth a non-exhaustive list of factors that
the court may consider:  
“(1) The
proximity of the trial date;  
(2) Whether
there was any previous continuance, extension of time, or delay of trial due to
any party;  
(3) The length
of the continuance requested;  
(4) The
availability of alternative means to address the problem that gave rise to the
motion or application for a continuance; 

(5) The
prejudice that parties or witnesses will suffer as a result of the continuance;

(6) If the case
is entitled to a preferential trial setting, the reasons for that status and
whether the need for a continuance outweighs the need to avoid delay; 
(7) The court's
calendar and the impact of granting a continuance on other pending trials; 
(8) Whether
trial counsel is engaged in another trial; 

(9) Whether all
parties have stipulated to a continuance; 

(10) Whether the
interests of justice are best served by a continuance, by the trial of the
matter, or by imposing conditions on the continuance; and  
(11) Any other
fact or circumstance relevant to the fair determination of the motion or
application.”  
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(d).)
Discussion
Motion for Deemed Admitted Order
City propounded Requests for Admission (Set One) to Plaintiff
on May 1, 2024.  (Sun Decl., ¶ 2 &
Exh. A.)  Plaintiff did not serve a
timely response.  (Id., ¶¶ 2-3.)
After the motion was filed, on June 26, 2024, Plaintiff served
verified responses to the Requests for Admission.  (Sogoyan Decl., ¶ 2 & Exh. 1.)
The motion for a deemed admitted order is denied.  Prior to the hearing, Plaintiff served responses
that are in substantial
compliance with Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.220.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)
The request for
sanctions is granted.  The failure of
Plaintiff and counsel to serve timely responses “necessitated this motion.”  (Ibid.) 
Their conduct was not substantially justified, and the imposition of
sanctions against them would not be unjust. 
Given the relatively straightforward nature of this motion, the Court
sets sanctions in the amount of $600, calculated based on two hours of attorney
time multiplied by a reasonable billing rate of $300 per hour for work of this nature.
Motion to Continue Trial
On June 3, 2024, City filed a motion for summary judgment and
reserved the earliest available hearing date, May 14, 2025, for the
motion.  Trial is currently set for
September 18, 2024.
City is entitled to have its timely filed motion for summary
judgment heard before trial.  (Cole v.
Superior Court (2022) 87 Cal.App.5th 84, 88; Sentry Ins. Co. v. Superior
Court (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 526, 529.) 
Accordingly, good cause has been shown, and City’s motion to continue
trial is granted.
Conclusion
The Court DENIES City’s motion for a deemed admitted order.
The Court GRANTS in part City’s request for sanctions.
The Court ORDERS Plaintiff and counsel of record Zwirn, Gevorkyan
& Sogoyan LLP to pay monetary sanctions under the Civil Discovery Act to
City in the amount of $600 within 30 days of notice.
The Court GRANTS City’s motion to continue trial.
The Court ORDERS that the trial date is continued to a date on
or after June 16, 2025.  The Final Status
Conference and all deadlines are reset based on the new trial date.
Moving party to give notice.
