And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Uber's motion to quash service of summons with prejudice. The motion was filed in response to a complaint filed by Morgan Rose alleging negligence against Uber and others in connection with a motor vehicle accident on June 1, 2022. The complaint was amended to name Uber as the true name of Doe 1 on October 18, 2024. Uber argued that the statute of limitations bars the plaintiff's cause of action and that the amendment of the complaint does not relate back to the initial complaint because the plaintiff knew Uber's identity when the complaint was filed. The judge found that the plaintiff did not meet the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 474 and that the motion to quash should be granted.
