And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the defendant's motion to strike the plaintiff's prayer for punitive and treble damages. The plaintiff, Cecillia Hailey, had entered into a retainer agreement with Neighborhood Legal Services Los Angeles to help her with a three-day pay-or-quit notice from her landlord. However, the defendant failed to reply timely to the notice, and Cecillia Hailey was "locked out" of her home and lost her landlord's unlawful detainer suit. The plaintiff alleged causes of action for breach of fiduciary duty, professional negligence, and breach of contract and sought damages, including punitive and treble damages. The judge found that the plaintiff failed to plead any facts that show oppression, fraud, or malice by the defendant, and therefore, the prayer for punitive damages was struck. Additionally, the judge found that there is no statute authorizing treble damages for breach of fiduciary duty, professional negligence, or breach of contract, and therefore, the prayer for treble damages was also struck. The plaintiff may amend her complaint.
