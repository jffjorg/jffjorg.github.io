The trial is currently set for January 28, 2025. On November 25, 2024, the parties stipulated to continue the trial and all discovery-related dates. The stipulation was based on the need to conduct Plaintiff's IME, PMK depositions, and expert depositions, to avoid unnecessary motion practice, and to participate in mediation scheduled with Judge Bruce Minto (Ret.) on February 25, 2025. On the same day, the Court rejected the stipulation, citing insufficient good cause. The Court stated: "Parties are responsible for scheduling mediation prior to trial date. Parties are also responsible for completing discovery timely given trial date. See also CRC 3.714 (all unlimited civil actions to be completed in 2 years). Case is more than 2 years old already -- parties should be ready to go to trial." Defendant now moves the Court to continue the trial based on the same rationale to complete discovery and to attend mediation. The parties failed to provide any additional rationale for the Court to deviate from its prior ruling. Thus, the Court is inclined to deny the Motion.  However, based on an ex parte application brought today, the Court is aware that Costco is seeking leave to amend a cross-complaint.  To determine how that motion impacts case scheduling, the Court will hear from the parties.     Hon. Lee S. Arian Judge of the Superior Court
