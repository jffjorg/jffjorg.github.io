And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to continue the trial in a premises liability case. The trial is currently set for January 28, 2025, and the parties previously stipulated to continue the trial and all discovery-related dates. However, the court rejected that stipulation, citing insufficient good cause. The defendant is now moving to continue the trial again, citing the need to complete discovery and attend mediation. The court is inclined to deny the motion, as the parties failed to provide any additional rationale for the continuance. However, the court is aware that the defendant is seeking leave to amend a cross-complaint and will hear from the parties to determine how that motion impacts case scheduling.
