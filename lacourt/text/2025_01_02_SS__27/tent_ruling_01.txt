  Sanctions¿is Taken Off Calendar
 
Dept. 27
1:30 p.m.
January 2, 2024






 
On November 25, 2024, Defendant Hertz
Corporation filed a motion for terminating sanctions against Plaintiff. On
December 10, 2024, the court granted Plaintiff's request to dismiss Defendant
Hertz from this action. Therefore, the motion for terminating sanctions is moot
and is taken off calendar. 
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at
SSCDEPT27@lacourt.org indicating intention
to submit on the tentative as directed by
the instructions provided on the court’s website at www.lacourt.org.  Please be advised that if you submit on the
tentative and elect not to appear at the hearing, the opposing party may
nevertheless appear at the hearing and argue the matter.  Unless you receive a submission from all other
parties in the matter, you should assume that others might appear at the
hearing to argue.  If the Court does not
receive emails from the parties indicating submission on this tentative ruling
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the Court may, at its discretion,
adopt the tentative as the final order or place the motion off calendar.
