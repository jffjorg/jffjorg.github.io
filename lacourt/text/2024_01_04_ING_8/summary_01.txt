```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the Motion to Bifurcate Liability from Damages filed by Defendant/Cross-Defendant Ziglift. The motion sought to separate the trial into two phases: liability and damages. Ziglift argued that bifurcation would promote judicial efficiency by avoiding the presentation of damages evidence if it prevails on its liability arguments. However, the court found that Ziglift failed to present evidence to support its claims of time savings or judicial efficiency. Additionally, the court noted that bifurcation would likely increase the total trial time and create additional complexity. The court is empathetic to the plight of the defendants in a serious bodily injury case but exercises its discretion in declining the invitation to bifurcate the trial.
