And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Risingstar AR, Inc. v. Samuel Salisbury, et al. The case involves a dispute over a default judgment entered against the Defendant, Samuel Salisbury. The Defendant argues that the default judgment should be set aside because he was surprised by the Plaintiff's counsel's decision to pursue a default judgment despite promises made during settlement discussions. The Judge has granted the Defendant's motion to set aside the default judgment and orders the Defendant to file a responsive pleading within 20 days of the hearing. The Judge has based its decision on the California Code of Civil Procedure, Section 473(b), which allows for relief from a judgment, dismissal, or other proceeding taken against a party through their mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. The Judge notes that the Defendant's counsel has complied with most of the requirements of the statute and that the public policy is in favor of granting relief and allowing the requesting party their day in court.
