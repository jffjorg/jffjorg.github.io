And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling granting the motion of Erik Harper, Plaintiff's counsel, to be relieved as attorney of record. Harper has complied with all procedural requirements in filing the motion, and the court finds that withdrawal would not cause an injustice or undue delay in proceedings. However, the court would like Harper to ensure that the address in which mail was sent to Plaintiff is current. The court orders Harper to serve a copy of the signed order on the client and all parties that have appeared in the case, and to provide notice and include Plaintiff's contact information so the court and defendant can communicate directly with the soon-to-be self-represented plaintiff.
