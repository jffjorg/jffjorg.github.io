And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the plaintiff's motion for leave to file a second amended complaint. The plaintiff, Scholer, is suing the defendants for breach of contract, fraud, and conversion. The defendants had demurred in part to the original complaint, and the plaintiff seeks to file a second amended complaint to address the demurrer. The defendants argue that the motion was filed one day late, but the judge finds that a one-day delay is not prejudicial and that the court should liberally grant leave to amend. Therefore, the judge grants the motion and allows the plaintiff to file the second amended complaint within five court days.
