And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendant's motion to conduct a neuropsychological examination of plaintiff Crowe. The motion is unopposed and supported by the declaration of defense counsel Lyon. The defendant argues that Crowe has placed their neurological status in controversy by alleging neurological injuries, such as ongoing headaches and brain fog, as a result of the motor vehicle incident. The judge finds that the defendant has demonstrated good cause for the additional examination and that Crowe does not oppose the motion. Therefore, the judge grants the motion.
