Youell v. Fink, Case no. 23SMCV04847
Hearing date January 21, 2025
Defendant’s Motion for Mental Examination of Plaintiff Crowe
Paintiffs Youell and Crowe sue for injuries arising out of a
motor vehicle incident. Defendant previously served demands for independent
orthopedic and neurological exams of both plaintiffs. Defendant now moves to be
allowed to have a neuropsychological examination of plaintiff Crowe. The motion
is unopposed and supported by the declaration of defense counsel Lyon.
Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §2032.020(a) permits parties to conduct
discovery “by means of a physical or mental examination . . . in any action in
which the mental or physical condition . . . of that party or other person is
in controversy in the action.” In an action where a plaintiff is seeking
recovery for personal injuries, any defendant may demand one physical
examination of the plaintiff. The court shall grant a motion for additional
physical examinations where good cause is shown. Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §2032.320(a).
Defendant argues Crowe has placed their neurological status
in controversy by alleging neurological injuries, such as ongoing headaches and
brain fog as a result of the incident. Decl. Lyon para. 6, exh. C. Defendant
argues further medical exams would be non-invasive and set within Los Angeles
county. Defendant asserts Crowe has consented to further testing. Decl. Lyon
para. 7. Defendant demonstrated good cause and plaintiff Crowe does not oppose.
