 Case Number:  24SMCV00862    Hearing Date:   January 21, 2025    Dept:  P Tentative Ruling
Bagdasaryan v. General Motors Company, Case no. 24SMCV00862
Hearing date January 17, 2025
Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Further Discovery
Plaintiff Bagdasaryan sues defendants General Motors LLC and
Cadillac of Beverly Hills for breach of warranties under Song-Beverly and
Magnuson-Moss arising from nonconformities and defects in a new vehicle
purchased by plaintiff. Plaintiff served initial discovery requests 6/19/24;
plaintiff moves to compel further responses to requests for production of
documents, set one. Plaintiff offers a separate statement per CRC 3.1345 and
the declaration of counsel Markarian. Defendant General Motors opposes and offers
a separate statement and the declaration of counsel Dobson.
Plaintiff’s Objection to Defendant General Motors’s Separate
Statement
Plaintiff objects to defendant’s separate statement as
unauthorized. Neither CRC 3.1110 et seq. nor CRC 3.1345 et seq. nor any statute
in the CCP authorizes the party opposing a motion to compel further responses
to discovery to file a separate statement. The court did not grant leave for
defendant to file a separate statement. SUSTAINED.
Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Further Discovery
To compel the production of documents, moving party must
show good cause. Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §2031.310(b)(1). Good cause exists where
the requested documents are relevant and the discovery is needed for effective
trial preparation or to prevent surprise at trial. Assoc. Brewers Dist. Co. v.
Superior Court of Los Angeles County (1967) 65 Cal.2d 583; Kirkland v. Superior
Court (2002) 95 Cal.App.4th 92, 98. Litigants do not, however, have unfettered
access to whatever information they want. Covell v. Superior Court (1984) 159
Cal.App.3d 39, 42-43. Under §2019.030 of the Cal. Code Civ. Proc. discovery
must be tailored to each case.
Plaintiff served 62 requests for production of documents.
Decl. Markarian exh. A. Defendant furnished objections and substantive
responses to all requests. Decl. Markarian exh. B. Plaintiff moves to compel
supplemental responses to requests for production nos. 1-28, 33-36, 41-45,
47-52, and 54-59. Plaintiff argues defendant’s responses violate Cal. Code Civ.
Proc. §2031.220 by failing to represent that “all documents or things in the
demanded category that are in defendant’s possession, custody, or control were
included in the production.” Mtn. Comp. Further Disc. 6:20-21. Plaintiff argues
there is no way to know if all documents requested were provided. The court
notes defendant asserts it produced any requested documents in its possession,
custody or control, subject to defendant actually possessing said documents.
Decl. Markarian exh. B. This is not, as plaintiff argues, a modification of the
language of §2031.220; defendant represents it will produce all non-privileged
documents to which it has access. Defendant’s responses are compliant under
§2031.220.
Plaintiff argues defendant’s responses to requests nos. 2,
10, 11, 12, 16, 17, 21, 22, 23, 33, and 42 violate §2031.230 by “(1) failing to
confirm that a diligent search and a reasonable inquiry has been made; (2) not
specifying whether the inability to comply is because the particular item or
category has never existed, has been destroyed, has been lost, misplaced, or
stolen, or has never been, or is no longer, in the possession, custody, or
control of defendant; and (3) not including a statement of the name or address
of any natural person or organization known or believed by defendant to have
possession, custody, or control of the responsive document.” Mtn. Comp. Further
Disc. 8:19-23. Plaintiff asserts defendant’s responses omit the third
requirement of
§2031.230; the court notes §2031.230 only requires a party
to disclose such information if it is known or believed by the disclosing
party. Defendant represents it was “not aware” of responsive documents
following reasonable inquiry. Decl. Markarian exh. B. Defendant’s responses are
compliant under §2031.230.
Plaintiff argues defendant’s objections fail to comply with
the specificity requirements of Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §2031.240. This is
incorrect; defendant’s objections identify the request being objected to and
the basis thereof, i.e., attorney-client privilege, trade secret, etc. See
Decl. Markarian exh. B. Defendant’s objections comply with §2031.240.
Plaintiff asserts defendant raises “vague & ambiguous,”
“overbroad” and “burdensome & oppressive” objections to plaintiff’s
requests nos. 7-41, 43-59. Decl. Markarian exh. B. Plaintiff argues these
objections are boilerplate and without merit. “Courts generally do not sustain
this kind of objection unless the question is totally unintelligible.” Deyo v.
Kilbourne (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 771, 782. An objection that a particular item of
discovery is “overbroad” is typically used in responding to interrogatories,
and even then, the objection is looked upon with disfavor and is rarely
sustained. Id.
Defendant’s boilerplate objections are without merit, but as
defendant has produced compliant documents notwithstanding the objections,
plaintiff’s argument is irrelevant. Plaintiff argues defendant’s
attorney-client privilege, work product and trade secret objections are without
merit because plaintiff excludes such documents from its requests for
production. Decl. Markarian exh. A. Defendant is entitled to raise such
objections; that plaintiff provided a disclaimer does not abrogate that right.
Defendant argues plaintiff failed to comply with Cal. Code
Civ. Proc. §2025.450 by failing to meet-and-confer in good faith. Decl. Dobson
paras. 4-8. Plaintiff argues defendant failed to comply with the court’s order
that the parties should meet and confer 10/8/24. Min. Order 9/18/24; decl.
Markarian paras. 11-17. Defendant does not address its failure to comply with
the court’s 9/18/24 order. Defendant cannot assert plaintiff failed in its
meet-and-confer obligations when it also failed its obligations.
Plaintiff argues defendant should be sanctioned $7,210 for
compelling plaintiff to bring the instant motion. This is unavailing; defendant
furnished substantive, code-compliant responses. Defendant’s objections and
failure to attend the 10/8/24 meet and confer discovery conference do not
nullify its production of responsive documents. The motion was unnecessary;
sanctions will not be awarded.
Defendant stated it produced all non-privileged documents in
its possession or control as requested. DENIED.
