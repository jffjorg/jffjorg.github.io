ANALYSIS:
 
On June 22, 2023, Defendants Noa Estrada and Jose Vargas
Guzman (“Defendants”) served Form Interrogatories, Set One and Request for
Production of Documents, Set One, on Plaintiff Leonard R. Tyler (“Plaintiff”) (Motions, Flowers Decl., Exh. A.) Despite a meet
and confer effort extending the deadline to serve verified responses without
objections, Plaintiff has not done so. (Id. at Exh. D.) Defendants filed
the instant (1) Motion to Compel Responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One,
and Request for Sanctions; and (1) Motion to Compel Responses to Request for
Production of Documents, Set One, and Request for Sanctions, on September 19,
2023. No oppositions have been filed to date.
 
Discussion
 
There is no requirement for a prior meet and confer effort
before a motion to compel initial responses can be filed. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.300.) Further, the motion can be brought at any time after the responding
party fails to provide the responses. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300.) Based on Plaintiff’s failure to timely
respond to the propounded discovery, Defendants are entitled to an order
compelling service of verified responses to the discovery requests without
objections. 
 
Plaintiff’s failure to timely respond constitutes a misuse
of the discovery process. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (d).) Sanctions
are appropriate under Code of Civil Procedure sections 2023.010 and 2023.030
and have been properly noticed. However, the amount sought is excessive for
straightforward and unopposed discovery motions. Under a lodestar calculation,
sanctions are awarded in the amount of $470.00 based on two hours of attorney
time billed at $175.00 per hour and filing fees of $60.00 per motion. (Motions,
Flowers Decl., ¶6.)

 
Conclusion
 
Defendants Noa Estrada and Jose Vargas Guzman’s (1) Motion
to Compel Responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One, and Request for
Sanctions; and (2) Motion to Compel Responses to Request for Production of
Documents, Set One, and Request for Sanctions, are GRANTED. PLAINTIFF LEONARD R. TYLER IS TO SERVE VERIFIED RESPONSES TO THE
DISCOVERY REQUESTS WITHOUT OBJECTIONS WITHIN 20 DAYS’ SERVICE OF THIS ORDER.
PLAINTIFF AND COUNSEL OF RECORD ARE JOINTLY AND SEVERALLY ORDERED TO PAY
SANCTIONS OF $470.00 TO PLAINTIFF’S COUNSEL WITHIN 20 DAYS’ SERVICE OF THIS
ORDER.
