PLAINTIFFS ARE AWARDED MONETARY SANCTIONS OF $2,327.00 JOINTLY AND  SEVERALLY AGAINST DEFENDANT LIAM HAMBEL AND COUNSEL OF RECORD, TO BE PAID  WITHIN 20 DAYS.      ANALYSIS:   Plaintiffs Pedro Aparicio and  Martha Prado (“Plaintiffs”) filed the instant action for motor vehicle  negligence against Defendants Liam Hambel and Sabrina Rodin (“Defendants”) on  May 23, 2022. Defendants filed an answer on October 7, 2022. On May 4, 2023, Plaintiff Aparicio filed a Motion  to Compel Further Responses to Request for Production of Documents against  Defendant Hambel, which the Court granted on June 6, 2023. (Minute Order,  06/06/23.) Another Motion to Compel Defendant Hambel’s Production of Documents  was granted in Plaintiff Aparicio’s favor on August 8, 2023. (Minute Order,  08/08/23.) Finally, on November 22, 2023, the Court granted Plaintiffs’ Motion  to Compel Further Responses to Form Interrogatories. (Minute Order, 11/22/23.)   Plaintiffs filed the instant Motion for Terminating, Issue, Evidentiary,  and Monetary Sanctions against Defendant on September 20, 2023. Defendant filed  an opposition on November 17, 2023 and Plaintiffs replied on November 27, 2023.     Legal Standard   Where a party  willfully disobeys a discovery order, courts have the discretion to impose  terminating, issue, evidence or monetary sanctions. (Code Civ. Proc., §§  2023.010, subds. (d), (g); R.S. Creative, Inc. v. Creative Cotton, Ltd.  (1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 486, 495.) Contrary to the opposition argument,  Plaintiffs’ motion is supported by authority under Code of Civil Procedure  section 2023.030, which states in relevant part: “The court may impose a  terminating sanction by one of the following orders:    (1)    An order striking out the pleadings or parts of the  pleadings of any party engaging in the misuse of the discovery process.   (2)    An order staying further proceedings by that party  until an order for discovery is obeyed.   (3)    An order dismissing the action, or any part of the  action, of that party.   (4)    An order rendering a judgment by default against that  party.”   (Code Civ. Proc., §  2023.030, subd. (d).) The court should look to the totality of the  circumstances in determining whether terminating sanctions are appropriate. (Lang  v. Hochman (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 1225, 1246.) Ultimate discovery sanctions  are justified where there is a willful discovery order violation, a history of  abuse, and evidence showing that less severe sanctions would not produce  compliance with discovery rules. (Van Sickle v. Gilbert (2011) 196  Cal.App.4th 1495, 1516.) “[A] penalty as severe as dismissal or default is not  authorized where noncompliance with discovery is caused by an inability to  comply rather than willfulness or bad faith.” (Brown v. Sup. Ct. (1986)  180 Cal.App.3d 701, 707.)    Discussion   As noted above, the Court granted two of Plaintiff  Aparicio’s motions to compel production of documents. At the time the instant  Motion for sanctions was filed on September 20, 2023, Defendant had not  complied with either order. (Motion, Hakim Decl., ¶¶3-5 and Exhs. 4-6.) In  opposition, Defendant admits that compliance with the second order was not  effectuated until November 17, 2023, the same day the opposition was filed.  (Opp., Oakes Decl., ¶4.) Defendant contends that compliance with the first  production order was made within the 20-day deadline. (Id. at ¶3.) In  light of this production, Defendant argues that no evidentiary, issue, or  terminating sanctions are warranted and that the monetary sanctions be greatly  reduced. Plaintiffs seek an issue sanction that the subject accident was caused  by Defendant, an evidentiary sanction prohibiting Defendant from introducing  facts of the subject accident, or a terminating sanction striking Defendant’s  answer and entering default judgment. (Notice of Motion, pp. 1-2.) The Court  finds that these sanctions are too broadly sought with respect to the specific  late-produced documents and, in light of their admittedly late production,  would amount to punishment instead of inducing compliance with its order.    The Court does find that monetary sanctions are warranted  for Defendant’s non-compliance with the orders to serve responses and the  necessity of filing the instant Motion to compel compliance. The amount sought,  however, is excessive and under a lodestar calculation, and reduced to  $2,327.00 based on nine hours of attorney time billed at $250.00 and $77.00 in  costs.    Conclusion   Plaintiffs Pedro Aparicio and Martha Prado’s Motion for  Terminating, Evidentiary, Issue, and Monetary Sanctions is GRANTED IN PART AND  DENIED IN PART. THE REQUEST FOR EVIDENTIARY, ISSUE, OR TERMINATING SANCTIONS IS  DENIED. PLAINTIFFS ARE AWARDED MONETARY SANCTIONS OF $2,327.00 JOINTLY AND  SEVERALLY AGAINST DEFENDANT LIAM HAMBEL AND COUNSEL OF RECORD, TO BE PAID  WITHIN 20 DAYS.     Moving party to give notice.
