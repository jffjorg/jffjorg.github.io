Harris v. Carillo, et al.MOTION TO
VACATE DISMISSAL
(CCP § 473(b))
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Plaintiff Kemory D. Harris’ Motion
to Vacate Dismissal is DENIED.
 
 
ANALYSIS:
 
On August 25, 2021, Plaintiff
Kemory D. Harris (“Plaintiff”) filed the instant action for breach of loan
agreement against Defendant Robert Carillo (“Defendant”). Defendant filed an
answer to the Complaint on September 23, 2021. The case came for trial on
February 22, 2023, at which time Plaintiff did not appear. (Minute Order,
02/22/23.) The Court dismissed the case without prejudice. (Ibid.)
 
Plaintiff filed the instant Motion to Vacate Dismissal on
July 14, 2023. At the hearing on October 2, 2023, the Court continued the
matter to allow Plaintiff to file a code-compliant declaration and demonstrate
service of all the moving papers on Defendant. Plaintiff filed a supplemental
declaration on November 3, 2023. No opposition to the Motion has been filed to
date.
 
Discussion
 
The motion is brought
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure, section 473, subdivision (b). Under this
statute, an application for relief must be made no more than six months after
entry of the order from which relief is sought and must be accompanied by an
affidavit of fault attesting to the moving party’s mistake, inadvertence,
surprise or neglect. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b); English v. IKON
Business Solutions (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 130, 143.) When based on attorney
fault with respect to entry of default, default judgment, or involuntary
dismissal, a timely request for relief must be granted. (Code Civ. Proc., §
473, subd. (b).) When brought pursuant to the provision for discretionary
relief based on party fault, the request must have been filed within a
reasonable amount of time. 
 
The motion was timely filed
within six months of dismissal of the action and explains that Plaintiff went
to the wrong courthouse by mistake. (Motion, pp. 1-2.) However, it remains that
Plaintiff has not set forth these facts in an affidavit that complies with the
requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 2015.5. Plaintiff’s
supplemental declaration does not address the basis to vacate the dismissal.
(Motion, Supp. Harris Decl., filed 11/03/23.) Instead, it discusses the merits
of the action against Defendant, which is not relevant to the dismissal 
 
Also, no proof of service of the
original motion papers has been filed, as ordered. The proof of service filed
by Plaintiff on November 3, 2023 is only for the supplemental declaration.
(Proof of Service by Mail, 11/03/23.) As the Court previously noted, failure to
give notice of a motion is not only a violation of the statutory requirements
but of due process. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1005; Jones v. Otero (1984) 156
Cal.App.3d 754, 757.) 
 
Therefore, Plaintiff has not met the requirements for relief
under Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b). 
 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiff Kemory D.
Harris’ Motion to Vacate Dismissal is DENIED.
 
 
Court clerk to give notice.
