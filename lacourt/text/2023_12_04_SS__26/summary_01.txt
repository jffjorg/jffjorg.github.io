And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion filed by plaintiffs Joel Bander and Felicia Bander to strike defendants' answers and cross-complaint, and to impose issue and/or evidence sanctions, as well as monetary sanctions. The plaintiffs had alleged that the defendants had failed to comply with discovery orders, including the production of Electronically Stored Information (ESI). However, the judge found that the defendants had fully complied with the discovery referee's recommendations regarding the production of ESI, and that any deficiencies in the production were not willful or in bad faith. The judge also found that the motion was not barred by statute, and that the plaintiffs had not shown that the defendants' actions were willful or in bad faith. As a result, the judge denied the motion and ordered the case to proceed as scheduled.
