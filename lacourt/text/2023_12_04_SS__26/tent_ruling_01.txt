ANALYSIS:  
 
Plaintiffs Joel Bander and Felicia Bander (“Plaintiffs”)
filed the instant action for failure to return their security deposit and
related claims against Defendants Ronald Bills (“Defendant Bills”), Howard
Management Group (“Defendant HMG”), Daniel Sloan (“Defendant Sloan”), Gonzalo
Olmedo dba Olmedo’s Construction (“Defendant Olmedo”) and Business Alliance
Insurance Company (“Defendant BAIC”) on September 24, 2018. The First Amended
Complaint was filed on October 22, 2019. 
 
Defendant WIR Holdings, LLC (“Defendant WIR”), added as a
doe defendant, filed a Cross-Complaint against Plaintiffs on October 14, 2020.
The Cross-Complaint alleges that Plaintiffs breached their lease agreement by
damaging the concrete driveway of the premises (“the Premises”) in an amount
greater than covered by their security deposit. 
 
On December 21, 2022, the Court found that exceptional
circumstances exist in this action, which warrant the appointment of a
discovery referee. (Minute Order, 12/21/22.) The discovery referee was
appointed on January 17, 2023. (Minute Order, 01/17/23.) On August 29, 2023,
the Court adopted the discovery referee’s recommendations, which were as
follows:
 
2. Defendants shall select, at its
expense, a qualified expert to extract all Electronically Stored Information
(ESI) that pertains to:
a. An estimate from Defendant Olmedo
Construction, dated July 1, 2018,
b. Email from Ron Bills dated July 3,
2018,
c. Email from Defendant Olmedo to
Defendant Sloan dated July 5, 2018, and
d. Email from Defendant Sloan to
Plaintiff Bander dated July 5, 2018.
All ESI shall be produced and provided
to Plaintiffs on a flash drive, disc, or other medium that will preserve its
“native form.”
 
3. Pursuant to stipulation,
alternatively, Defendants shall allow a qualified expert selected by
Plaintiffs, at Plaintiff’s expense, to access the computer system for
the relevant ESI. Any Defense expert
may be present, at Defendant’s expense, to
monitor and to provide adequate
safeguards to protect the proprietary integrity and privacy rights of all
parties and third parties whose information may be stored on such computers
during the inspection. 
 
(Notice of Referee’s Recommendations, filed 05/30/23; Minute
Order, 08/29/23.) On September 27, 2023, Plaintiffs filed the instant Motion to
Strike Defendants’ Answers, and the Cross-Complaint Of W.I.R. Holdings, LLC, or
in the alternative, for Issue and/or Evidence Sanctions; and for Monetary
Sanctions. Defendants filed an opposition on November 17, 2023 and Plaintiffs
replied with evidentiary objections on November 27, 2023.
 
Legal Standard
 
Where a party willfully disobeys a discovery order, courts
have the discretion to impose terminating, issue, evidence or monetary
sanctions. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2023.010, subds. (d), (g); R.S. Creative,
Inc. v. Creative Cotton, Ltd. (1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 486, 495.) Contrary to
the opposition argument, Plaintiffs’ motion is supported by authority under
Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.030, which states in relevant part: “The
court may impose a terminating sanction by one of the following orders: 
 
(1)   An
order striking out the pleadings or parts of the pleadings of any party
engaging in the misuse of the discovery process.
 
(2)   An
order staying further proceedings by that party until an order for discovery is
obeyed.
 
(3)   An
order dismissing the action, or any part of the action, of that party.
 
(4)   An
order rendering a judgment by default against that party.”
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (d).) The court should
look to the totality of the circumstances in determining whether terminating
sanctions are appropriate. (Lang v. Hochman (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 1225,
1246.) Ultimate discovery sanctions are justified where there is a willful
discovery order violation, a history of abuse, and evidence showing that less
severe sanctions would not produce compliance with discovery rules. (Van
Sickle v. Gilbert (2011) 196 Cal.App.4th 1495, 1516.) “[A] penalty as
severe as dismissal or default is not authorized where noncompliance with
discovery is caused by an inability to comply rather than willfulness or bad
faith.” (Brown v. Sup. Ct. (1986) 180 Cal.App.3d 701, 707.)
 
Discussion
 
Plaintiffs’ evidentiary objection to the declaration of
David Bower at paragraph 37 and Exh. D is sustained. Additionally, the Court
finds that the instant Motion is not barred by the provisions of Code of Civil
Procedure sections 2024.020 and 2024.050, as Defendants argue, which pertain to
the right to complete discovery and to have discovery motions heard, a certain
amount of time before trial. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2024.020.) Sanctions motions
are not subject to these deadlines. (Department of Forestry & Fire
Protection v. Howell (2017) 18 Cal.App.5th 154, 197.) 
 
Plaintiffs have not shown that Defendants did not comply
with the recommendations of the discovery referee to hire a qualified expert to
extract all the ESI that pertains to the aforementioned documents. Rather, it
is Plaintiffs’ contention that the ESI extracted was incomplete because it did
not include all the creation dates and was not initially verified. The lack of
initial verifications by Defendants of Defendants’ expert’s ESI report,
however, was later corrected. (Motion, Exhs. K-M.) Regarding Plaintiffs’
contention that the ESI was incomplete, the Court finds that Defendants fully
complied with the discovery referee’s recommendations regarding the use of a
qualified expert for this extraction, a process to which the parties agreed.
(Opp., Bower Decl., ¶¶26-31 and Exhs. A-C.) A report was sent to Plaintiffs and
the discovery referee on June 6, 2023. (Id. at ¶31 and Exh. C.) There
was no order, nor other agreement between the parties, that should Plaintiffs
be unsatisfied with the production of Defendants’ ESI expert that Plaintiffs’
own ESI expert would then conduct their own examination. Plaintiffs’ contention
that Defendants violated the discovery orders by failing to allow access by
Plaintiffs’ expert, therefore, is without merit. In fact, following a meet and
confer regarding the June 6, 2023 report from Defendants’ ESI expert,
Defendants asked their expert to again provide a report regarding the ESI for
the delineated documents, at additional cost. (Id. at ¶¶32-36.) 
 
Therefore, the Court finds no violation of the discovery
orders to produce ESI pertaining to the estimate from Defendant Olmedo
Construction and emails from Defendants Bills, Olmedo, and Sloan.
 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiffs Joel Bander and Felicia Bander’s Motion to Strike
Defendants’ Answers, and the Cross-Complaint Of W.I.R. Holdings, LLC, or in the
alternative, for Issue and/or
Evidence Sanctions; and for Monetary Sanctions is DENIED.
