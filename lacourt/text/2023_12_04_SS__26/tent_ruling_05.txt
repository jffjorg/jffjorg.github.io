ANALYSIS:
 
On March 21, 2022, Plaintiff
Progressive West Insurance Company (“Plaintiff”) filed the instant action for
automobile subrogation against Defendants Jorge Rosas and Ivon Vargas
(“Defendants”). Defendants filed answers on May 3, 2022. The case came for trial
on September 18, 2023. (Minute Order, 09/18/23.) When Plaintiff failed to
appear, the Court dismissed the action without prejudice. (Minute Order,
09/18/23.)
 
Plaintiff filed the instant Motion to Vacate Dismissal on
October 5, 2023. No opposition to the Motion has been filed to date.
 
Discussion
 
The motion is brought
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure, section 473, subdivision (b). Under this statute, an application for relief must be made
no more than six months after entry of the order from which relief is sought
and must be accompanied by an affidavit of fault attesting to the moving
party’s mistake, inadvertence, surprise or neglect. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473,
subd. (b); English v. IKON Business Solutions (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 130,
143.) When based on attorney fault with respect to entry of default, default
judgment, or involuntary dismissal, a timely request for relief must be
granted. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b).) When brought pursuant to the
provision for discretionary relief based on party fault, the request must have
been filed within a reasonable amount of time. 
 
The motion was timely filed within
six months of dismissal of the action and is supported by an affidavit of
attorney fault. Plaintiff’s counsel declares that they mis-calendared the trial
date. (Motion, Tapper Decl., ¶¶2-3.) Therefore, the case must be reinstated
under Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b).
