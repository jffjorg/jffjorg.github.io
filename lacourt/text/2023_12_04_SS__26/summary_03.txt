And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the Plaintiff's Motion to Vacate Dismissal. The Plaintiff, Kemory D. Harris, seeks to vacate the dismissal of the case against the Defendant, Robert Carillo, alleging that the dismissal was the result of attorney fault. The Judge has denied the motion, finding that the Plaintiff has not met the requirements for relief under Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b). The Plaintiff's motion was timely filed, but it lacks an affidavit complying with the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 2015.5, and the Plaintiff has not provided proof of service of the original motion papers. The Judge has also noted that the Plaintiff's supplemental declaration does not address the basis for vacating the dismissal and instead discusses the merits of the action against the Defendant.
