And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendants' motion to compel responses to their discovery requests and has ordered the plaintiff to serve verified responses to the discovery requests without objections within 20 days. The judge has also ordered the plaintiff and their counsel to pay sanctions of $470.00 to the defendant's counsel. The defendants had served the discovery requests on the plaintiff in June 2023, but the plaintiff failed to respond in a timely manner. The judge found that the plaintiff's failure to respond constituted a misuse of the discovery process and that the defendants were entitled to an order compelling service of verified responses without objections.
