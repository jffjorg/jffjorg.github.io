And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to compel the concurrent depositions of defendant John Sofio and Built, Inc.'s personal most knowledgeable person (PMK). The motion was brought under Code of Civil Procedure Section 2025.450(a), which allows a party to move for an order compelling a deponent's attendance and testimony if the deponent fails to appear for examination or to proceed with it. However, the judge found that the requirements of Section 2025.450(a) have not been met in this case. The parties had agreed to schedule the depositions of Sofio individually and as PMK for Built concurrently on April 12, 2024, but DWG served two deposition notices with conflicting dates. Sofio appeared for deposition on April 12, 2024, but the deposition was halted when DWG's counsel stated that they would file a motion to compel. The judge found that Sofio did not fail to attend or proceed with the deposition, and that DWG's failure to proceed with the deposition was the reason for the halt.

The judge has also granted the motion for a protective order to the extent that it asks the court to enforce the parties' agreement regarding the order and scheduling of depositions. The parties are ordered to meet and confer to arrange new dates for the depositions in question, in the agreed-upon order. The motion for a protective order is denied to the extent that it asks the court to impose sanctions against Sofio, Built, and their attorneys.
