Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to compel further responses to Special Interrogatories, Set One, and the request for monetary sanctions. The Judge notes that the motion requires a separate statement, which has not been provided. The Judge is inclined to deny the motion to compel further responses and the request for monetary sanctions without prejudice. The Judge finds that the Defendant has not shown that the Plaintiff has failed to provide sufficient responses to the Special Interrogatories, and that the Defendant's argument that the Plaintiff has breached a promise to provide further responses is without merit. The Judge notes that the parties have agreed to meet and confer regarding further responses, and that the Plaintiff has promised to provide further responses, but has failed to do so for months. The Judge is willing to continue the hearing to allow the moving party to prepare and file the mandated separate statement, unless the Plaintiff has provided verified further responses before the hearing. The Judge suggests that parties should not be required to file a discovery motion to obtain compliance with discovery obligations, and that even the service of a verified further response does not moot the monetary sanctions aspect of a motion to compel further responses.
