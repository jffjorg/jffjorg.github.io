And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to strike certain portions of the plaintiff's complaint. The defendant, Robin Lynn Thompson, filed the motion to strike, but the judge has denied it without prejudice. The judge's decision is based on the fact that default was entered against Thompson on February 9, 2024, and she has not moved to set aside the default. As a result, Thompson is "out of court" and is not entitled to take any further steps in the litigation until the default is set aside. The judge notes that Thompson may re-file the motion to strike if and when she moves to set aside the default.
