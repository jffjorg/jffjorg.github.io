Summary:
The judge's tentative ruling is to grant Defendant's motion to set aside the default judgment, as Defendant has moved in accordance with Code of Civil Procedure section 473.5. However, the judge will allow oral argument as to whether the motion to set aside should be continued until after Plaintiff receives information from the subpoenas. The case involves a dispute over whether Plaintiff served the correct entity and whether Defendant received actual notice of the lawsuit. The judge notes that the two-year period to seek to vacate a default judgment may be more applicable in this case based on the disputed factual issue as to whether Plaintiff was serving the wrong entity the entire time.
