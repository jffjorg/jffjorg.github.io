English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer and motion to strike in a legal malpractice case. The plaintiff filed a fourth amended complaint (4AC) against defendants Majid Safaie and Arya Law Center PC, alleging professional negligence, breach of fiduciary duty, and fraud and deceit. The defendants demurred to the 4AC, arguing that it fails to state facts sufficient to support any cause of action. The judge overruled the demurrer to the first and second causes of action, but sustained the demurrer to the third cause of action without leave to amend. The plaintiff remedied the deficiencies in the 4AC and repled fraud claims. The judge found that the plaintiff has properly pled a claim for fraud against both Safaie and Arya. The motion to strike punitive damages and attorney's fees allegations from the 4AC was also denied.
