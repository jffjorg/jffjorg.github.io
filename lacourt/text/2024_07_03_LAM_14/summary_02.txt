And here is the summary in English text:

The Honorable Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the instant motion for issue, evidentiary, and/or terminating sanctions against defendants David and Julian. The motion is granted, and defendants are ordered to pay $760.00 in sanctions to plaintiff's counsel within 30 days. Additionally, defendants' Answers are stricken, and plaintiffs may apply for default judgment against defendants. The lack of opposition to the motion operates as a concession that the motion has merit. The Court granted plaintiffs' motions to compel discovery and ordered defendants to pay sanctions, but defendants failed to comply with the order. As a result, the Court awarded sanctions to plaintiff's counsel.
