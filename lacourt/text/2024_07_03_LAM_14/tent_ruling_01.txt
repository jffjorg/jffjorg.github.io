  Case Number:  22STCV20357    Hearing Date:   July 3, 2024    Dept:  14 #11Case Background
 
This is a legal malpractice case.
 
On April 15, 2024, Plaintiff filed their
Fourth Amended Complaint (“4AC”) for (1) Professional Negligence, (2) Breach of
Fiduciary Duty, and (3) Fraud and Deceit against Defendants Majid Safaie (“Safaie”),
Arya Law Center PC (“Arya”) (collectively “Defendants”), and DOES 1-40. 
 
            A jury
trial is set for June 30, 2025.
 
(1)       Demurrer
 
            Defendants now
demur to the 4AC on the grounds that it fails to state facts sufficient to
support any cause of action.
 
Decision
 
            The
demurrer to the first and second causes of action is OVERRULED, as it is
unsupported in the memorandum. California Rules of Court Rule 3.1113(a).
 
            The
demurrer to the third cause of action is OVERRULED.
 
Third Cause of Action: Fraud
 
On April 3, 2024, the Court
sustained Defendant’s demurrer to Plaintiff’s fraud claim as stated in their
Third Amended Complaint (“TAC”) because Plaintiff failed to plead a connection
between Safaie and Arya which would render Arya responsible for Safaie’s
actions. (4/3/24 Minute Order.) Specifically, Plaintiff did not plead what
authority Safaie had to make the alleged representations on behalf of Arya. (Id.)
The Court deemed the boilerplate agency allegations contained in Paragraph 7 of
the TAC insufficient. (Id.)
 
Plaintiff remedied these
deficiencies in the 4AC. The new allegations in the 4AC include that Safaie
“owned and operated” Arya (4AC, ¶ 2). This allegation provides sufficient
support for the agency language in Paragraph 7 of the 4AC.
 
The elements of fraud are
sufficiently pled. The elements of a cause of action for fraud are: (1) a false
representation, actual or implied, or concealment of a matter of fact material
to the transaction which defendant had a duty to disclose or defendant’s
promise made without the intention to perform; (2) defendant’s knowledge of the
falsity; (3) defendant’s intent to deceive; (4) plaintiff’s justifiable
reliance thereon; and (5) resulting damage to plaintiff. Mosier v. Southern Calif. Physicians Ins. Exchange (1998) 63 Cal.App.4th
1022, 1045. Here, the 4AC pleads fraud at paragraphs 29-41.
Paragraph 29 lists a series of representations which were
made by Safaie, orally and in the retainer agreement, when Plaintiff hired
Defendants as counsel. Paragraphs 30-33 allege
that these representations were false. Paragraphs 34-41 allege
intent, reliance, and damages.
 
Fraud must be specifically pled,
and the particularity requirement necessitates the pleading of facts that “show
how, when, where, to whom, and by what means the representations were
tendered.” Stansfield v. Starkey (1990) 220 Cal.App.3d 59, 73. “The
requirement of specificity in a fraud action against a corporation requires the
plaintiff to allege the names of the persons who made the allegedly fraudulent
representations, their authority to speak, to whom they spoke, what they said
or wrote, and when it was said or written.” Tarmann v. State Farm Mut. Auto.
Ins. Co. (1991) 2 Cal.App.4th 153, 157. Here, Safaie made the
allegedly fraudulent representations to Plaintiff on behalf of Arya in his
capacity as owner of the firm. (4AC ¶ 2.) Some of the representations were made
orally at the time of the signing of the retainer agreement. (4AC ¶¶ 10,
20.) The representations were also made in writing in the retainer agreement.
(4AC, Exh. 1 at p. 4.)
 
Conclusion
 
            The
demurrer to the first and second causes of action is OVERRULED, as it is
unsupported in the memorandum. California Rules of Court Rule 3.1113(a).
 
            The
demurrer to the third cause of action is OVERRULED because Plaintiff has
properly pled a claim for fraud against both Safaie and Arya.
 
(2)       Motion to
Strike
 
            Defendant
now moves this court for an order striking the punitive damages and attorney’s
fees allegations from the 4AC. 
 
Decision
 
The motion is DENIED.
 
            As
discussed above, Plaintiff properly stated claims for breach of fiduciary duty
and conversion, both of which are intentional torts which may give rise to a
punitive damages award. See Civil Code § 3294(c)(1).
