And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to file a First Amended Complaint, adding two new defendants, William Elliott and Dr. Rajendra Prasad, and two new causes of action for wrongful death. The plaintiff seeks to add these defendants and causes of action because they were not included in the original complaint. The judge finds that good cause exists to allow the amendment, and that the defendants have not shown undue prejudice.

The amendment is necessary because Elliott, an admission coordinator at Crenshaw, escorted Greystoke out of the nursing home to acquire a knife, and Prasad, Greystoke's treating physician, had a conflict of interest due to his dual role as medical director for Crenshaw. The defendants oppose the motion, arguing that it would prejudice them in the form of additional discovery, but the judge finds that the plaintiff's delay in seeking to bring Elliott and Prasad into the action is not unwarranted.

The judge orders the plaintiff to file the First Amended Complaint, which will be deemed the operative complaint in this action.
