now moves this court, per Code of Civil Procedure § 2023.030 for an order
for issue, evidentiary, and/or terminating sanctions against defendants David
and Julian (“Defendants”) for failure to comply with the Court’s February 28,

responses thereto, without objections and (b) pay to Plaintiffs $1,520 in
sanctions, within 30 days. (Amritraj Decl., ¶ 5.) Plaintiffs served a notice of
ruling upon Defendants on March 4, 2024. (Id., ¶ 6.) Plaintiffs received no
response or payment from Defendants. (Ibid.)
 
The motion is unopposed. The lack
of an opposition operates as a
concession that the motion has merit. See California Rules of Court Rule

133 Cal.App.4th 1, 20.

Plaintiff’s counsel to spend on each motion is two hours. $350 per hour is a
reasonable rate. (Amritraj Decl., ¶ 7.) Assuming a $60 filing fee, the total is
$760.
