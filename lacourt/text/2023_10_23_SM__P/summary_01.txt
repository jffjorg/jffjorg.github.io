And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court will hold a hearing on October 23, 2023, to consider the enforcement of a settlement agreement regarding the painting "that lists Mrs. Reinis as the owner and loss payee." The agreement required the plaintiff, Singer, to obtain an insurance policy that names Reinis as the owner and payee. However, Singer has been unable to do so because insurance companies require the owner of the policy to apply for it. The court will inquire about whether all reasonable avenues to obtain a compliant policy have been exhausted. As an alternative, Reinis may apply for an insurance policy covering the painting that names Reinis as both owner and payee, with Singer paying for that policy.
