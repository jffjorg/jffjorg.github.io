Singer v. Reinis
et al., Case No. 22SMCV00268 
Hearing Date October
23, 2023  
Hearing Re:
Enforcement of Settlement Agreement
 
On September 5, 2023
the court held a hearing regarding the status of the settlement agreement. Pursuant
to the settlement, the court ordered plaintiff Singer obtain an insurance
policy covering the painting “that lists Mrs. Reinis as the owner and loss
payee.” See 9/5/2023 minute order.
 
Singer has been
unable to obtain a policy listing Reinis as the owner. According to Singer,
each insurance company requires the owner of the policy to be the one who applies
for the policy. See Rocha declaration ¶15, Reinis Declaration ¶¶11-3. Singer
argues the settlement agreement cannot be enforced in its current form, and the
court should sever the provision requiring Singer to obtain a policy that names
Reinis as the owner as well as the payee. 
 
The court will
inquire as to whether all reasonable avenues to obtain a compliant policy have
been exhausted. As the court discussed with the parties at the prior hearing, Reinis
may apply for an insurance policy covering the painting that names Reinis as
both owner and payee, with Singer to pay for that policy.
