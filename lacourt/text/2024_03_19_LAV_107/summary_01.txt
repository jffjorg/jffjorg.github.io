Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on four motions filed by the plaintiff, Mid-Century Insurance Company, against the defendant, Jainson's International, Inc. The motions seek to compel the defendant to respond to discovery requests, including form interrogatories, special interrogatories, requests for production of documents, and requests for admission. The judge has granted all four motions, finding that the defendant failed to respond to the discovery requests and has waived any objections to the requests.

The judge has also imposed sanctions on the defendant in the amount of $1,760.00, which includes attorney's fees and filing expenses. The sanctions are payable within 30 days of service of the order.

The judge's ruling is based on California law and court rules, including the Code of Civil Procedure and the California Rules of Court. The judge has carefully reviewed the evidence and arguments presented by the parties and has made a thorough analysis of the discovery requests and the defendant's failure to respond. The judge's tentative ruling is final unless the parties request a rehearing.
