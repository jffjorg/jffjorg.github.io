[THE FOLLOWING IS A TENTATIVE RULING IN THE ABOVE CASE]:
 
 
BACKGROUND
 
In 2017 and 2018, plaintiff Mid-Century Insurance Company (“Plaintiff”) provided defendant Jainson’s
International, Inc. (“Defendant”) with workers’ compensation insurance
policies, for which Defendant promised to pay Plaintiff premiums. (Motion p.
3.) Defendant defaulted on its premiums payments and an outstanding balance
remains. (Ibid.)
 
On September 15,
2022, Plaintiff initiated this lawsuit by filing a complaint (the “Complaint”).
 
On August 28, 2023, Plaintiff propounded discovery requests on Defendant.
(Motion p. 4.) Defendant has not provided responses to any of these discovery
requests. (Ibid.)
 
On February 7, 2024, Plaintiff filed four discovery motions: (1) a motion
to compel responses to form interrogatories (“Motion #1”), (2) a motion to
compel responses to special interrogatories (“Motion #2”), (3) a motion to
compel responses to requests for production of documents (“Motion #3”), and (4)
a motion to deem requests for admission admitted (“Motion #4” and, together
with Motion #1, Motion #2, and Motion #3, the “Motions”). Defendant has not
filed any oppositions to the Motions.
 
ANALYSIS
 
I.          Motions
to Compel (Motion #1, Motion #2, and Motion #3)
 
“If a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to serve a timely
response,…[t]he party propounding the interrogatories may move for an order
compelling response to the interrogatories.” (Cal. C. Civ. Proc.
§ 2030.290.) And, “a party's failure to object to interrogatories within
30 days, or such additional time as extended by the court, constitutes a waiver
of any right to object.” (Leach v. Superior Court (1980) 111 Cal.App.3d
902, 905.) Similarly, “[i]f a party to
whom a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or
sampling is directed fails to serve a timely response to it,… [t]he party
to whom the demand for inspection, copying, testing, or
sampling is directed waives any objection to the demand [and]…[t]he party
making the demand may move for an order compelling response to
the demand.” (Cal. C. Civ. Proc. § 2031.300.) In the absence
of any response to the discovery request, all that a motion to compel need show
is that a set of interrogatories was properly served on the opposing
party, that the time to respond has expired, and that no response of any kind
has been served. (See id., 905–06.)
 
Plaintiff attaches to each of the Motions evidence that each discovery
request was properly served on Defendant’s attorneys by mail at their correct business
address on August 29, 2023. (Motion Exh. “A.”) Defendant’s responses thereto
were therefore due 35 days later, on October 3, 2023. (Cal. C. Civ. Proc. §§ 1013(a),
2016.050, 2030.260(a), 2031.260(a).) Plaintiff attaches to the Motions evidence
that no response of any kind to any of the three discovery requests was
received by that response due date or thereafter. (Hettena Decl. ¶ 5.)
Thus, Plaintiff has met its burden of showing that the Motions are necessary.
 
Accordingly, Motion #1 is GRANTED, Motion #2 is GRANTED, and Motion #3 is
GRANTED.
 
II.        Motion
to Deem Requests for Admission Admitted (Motion #4)
 
“Any party may obtain discovery . . . by a written request that any other
party to the action admit the genuineness of specified documents, or the truth
of specified matters of fact, opinion relating to fact, or application of law
to fact. A request for admission may relate to a matter that is in controversy
between the parties.” (Cal. C. Civ. Proc.
§ 2033.010.) “Within 30 days after service of requests for admission, the party
to whom the requests are directed shall serve the original of the response to
them on the requesting party, and a copy of the response on all other parties
who have appeared.” (Cal. C. Civ. Proc. § 2033.250(a).)
 
If a party to whom request for admissions are served fails to provide a
timely response, the party to whom the request was directed waives any
objections, including based on privilege or the work product doctrine. (Cal. C. Civ. Proc. § 2033.280(a).) The requesting
party can move for an order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth
of any matters specified in the request be deemed admitted, as well as for
monetary sanctions. (Cal. C. Civ. Proc §
2033.280(b).) The court shall issue this order unless the party to whom the
request was made serves a response in substantial compliance prior to the
hearing on the motion. (Cal. C. Civ. Proc. §
2033.280(c).)
 
Plaintiff attaches to Motion #4 evidence that the requests for admission
were properly served on Defendant’s attorneys by mail at their correct business
address on August 29, 2023. (Motion Exh. “A.”) Defendant’s responses thereto
were therefore due 35 days later, on October 3, 2023. (Cal. C. Civ. Proc.
§§ 1013(a), 2016.050, 2033.250(a).) Plaintiff attaches to Motion #4
evidence that no response of any kind was received by that response due date or
thereafter. (Hettena Decl. ¶ 5.) Thus, Plaintiff has met its burden of
showing that Motion #4 is necessary.
 
Accordingly,
Motion #4 is GRANTED.
 
III.       Sanctions
 
Sanctions are mandatory against the
party, the attorney, or both whose failure to serve a timely response to the
request necessitated the motion to compel response to interrogatories, the
motion to compel response to a demand for inspection, or the motion to deem a request
for admissions as admitted. (Cal. C.
Civ. Proc. §§ 2030.290(c), 2031.300(c), and 2033.280(c); see also Cal.
Rules of Court R. 3.1348(a) (the court can award sanctions under the Discovery
Act in favor of a party seeking to compel discovery even though no opposition
was filed, the opposition was withdrawn, or the requested discovery was
provided to the moving party after the motion was filed). “As to the amount
of sanctions, Cal. C. Civ. Proc. § 2023.030(a) authorizes
the trial court to impose an amount representing ‘the reasonable expenses,
including attorney's fees, incurred by anyone as a result’ of a party's misuse
of the discovery process.” (Parker v. Wolters Kluwer United States, Inc.
(2007) 149 Cal.App.4th 285, 294.)
 
Motion #1, Motion #2, and Motion #3
each request sanctions in the amount of $660.00 and Motion #4 requests
sanctions in the amount of $680.00 for a total of $2,660.00. (Motion p. 2.) For
each Motion, this is based upon one hour of attorney time spent preparing the
Motion at a rate of $300.00 per hour, one hour of attorney time attending the
hearing on the Motion at the same rate, the filing fee, and, in the case of
Motion #4, the order fee. (Hettena Decl. p. 7.) 
 
These calculations reveal some duplication
in time. The Motions are now being heard together, so Plaintiff’s attorney only
needs to appear at one hearing. We therefore believe Plaintiff’s attorney
should only be permitted to bill 1.0 hours once for all four Motions. Thus, we
believe that the reasonable amount of attorney time spent on the Motions is the
sum of one hour for each of the four Motions and one hour attending the hearing
for a total of five hours. Five hours billed at a rate of $300.00 per hour is
$1,500.00. We believe that the $60.00 expense to file each of the four Motions
and the $20.00 expense for the order fee are reasonable. Filing expenses are
therefore the sum of the product of $60.00 by four motions and $20.00, or
$260.00. The sum of reasonable attorney’s fees and reasonable filing expenses
is therefore $1,760.00.
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s request
for sanctions against Defendant is GRANTED in the reduced amount of $1,760.00. Sanctions
are payable within 30 days of service of this order.
