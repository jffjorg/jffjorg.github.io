And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling addresses the motion of the defendants, Ezequial D. Gherscovici, individually and as Trustee, and Ivy A. Brooks-Gherscovici, individually and as Trustee, to strike the plaintiff's request for attorney fees based on the CC&Rs. The court grants the motion, finding that the plaintiff is not entitled to attorney fees under the CC&Rs. The court also notes that the plaintiff may have an alternative basis for attorney fees under statute (Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5), but this issue is left for further fact-finding. The court gives the plaintiff 30 days' leave to amend its complaint to seek attorney fees under statute.
