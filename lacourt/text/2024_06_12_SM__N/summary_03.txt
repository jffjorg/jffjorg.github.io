And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling sustains Defendant Barry Smolin's demurrer to the complaint filed by Plaintiff Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD). The court finds that the claims alleged by LAUSD against Smolin are only available among tortfeasors who are jointly and severally liable for the indivisible injury sustained by Jane Doe. The court concludes that Smolin is not a joint tortfeasor with LAUSD and therefore is not responsible for the alleged deficiencies in LAUSD's supervision and reporting of suspected child abuse. The court grants leave to amend the complaint, but only as authorized by the court's order, and prohibits LAUSD from adding new parties or causes of action without permission.
