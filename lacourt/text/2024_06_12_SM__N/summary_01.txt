And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The plaintiff, SM 10000 Property, LLC, has requested a default judgment against the defendant, Jakob Andersen. The court has reviewed the plaintiff's request and has identified several deficiencies that need to be addressed before the request can be granted. Specifically, the court has found that the plaintiff's proposed judgment in the JUD-100 form does not match the amount sought in the CIV-100 form, and that the plaintiff's request for costs includes costs that are not allowable under the Code of Civil Procedure. The court has also found that the plaintiff's calculation of attorney fees exceeds the schedule set forth in the Superior Court of Los Angeles County's local rules, and that the plaintiff's interest calculations fail to clearly describe the basis of interest. Therefore, the court is continuing the hearing to allow the plaintiff to revise the default package to seek the same amounts, revise the complaint, revise the memorandum of costs, reduce attorney fees, and clearly describe the basis of interest.
