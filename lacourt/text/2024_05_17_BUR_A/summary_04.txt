And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling denies Plaintiffs' motion to compel further responses to their Request for Production of Documents (RFPD) without prejudice. The judge finds that Plaintiffs' filing of the motion while discovery matters ought to have been stayed has resulted in a motion which is moot. The judge is unable to determine the merits of Plaintiffs' motion as filed because the judge is without the information needed to evaluate what documents remain to be produced and to which RFPD those documents are responsive. The judge sets a case management conference for September 4, 2024 at 9:00 am.
