And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Court has granted the Motions to Quash Service of Summons brought by each of the three Defendants. The Court finds that the Plaintiff has not upheld her burden of proof on a motion to quash service. The Court notes that the Plaintiff has not attempted to cure the defective service, and the additional evidence of the May 12, 2023 mailing does not constitute effective personal or substitute service. The Court finds that the Plaintiff's Proofs of Service only evidence the attempts at service in September and November 2022, which were already found to be insufficient and ordered stricken. The Court grants the Motions to Quash and finds that the Plaintiff has not established personal jurisdiction over the Defendants.
