And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion to strike Plaintiffs' claims for punitive damages. The Plaintiffs alleged that the Defendants, DGK Plumbing, Yaya Glenoaks LLC, Gary Kleinman, and Michael Engelman, were negligent in the digging of a trench that collapsed, resulting in the death of the Decedent. The judge found that the Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged despicable conduct by the Defendants, including their intentional failure to ensure the safety of their employees in order to save costs. The judge also found that the Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged facts supporting punitive damages with sufficient specificity. The judge rejected the Defendants' arguments that the Plaintiffs' allegations were conclusory and insufficiently specific.
