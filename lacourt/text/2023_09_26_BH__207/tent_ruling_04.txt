MOTION
 
Defendant James Dostal, administrator of the Estate of Joseph Dostal,
demurs to all three causes of action alleged in Plaintiff Gina Teresa Sanchez’s
(“Plaintiff”) Complaint.  
 
This case stems from a dispute over the money allegedly owed to
Plaintiff by the decedent’s estate, based on two agreements – one between
Plaintiff and the decedent while he was alive, and the other between Plaintiff
and Defendant following decedent’s death. 
Plaintiff filed a verified complaint, alleging two causes of action for
breach of contract and a third cause of action for common counts.  
 
Defendant demurs to all three causes of action on the bases that (1) the
claims were brought in the wrong forum, as they pertain to a decedent’s estate
and belong instead in probate court and (2) the complaint fails to allege the
causes of action with requisite specificity, and is therefore uncertain and
fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.
 
Plaintiff opposes the demurrer on the grounds that (1) Defendant
failed to meet and confer prior to filing the demurrer; (2) the claims are
properly (and commonly) litigated in civil litigation actions; and (3) the
allegations do provide sufficient specificity to apprise Defendant of the
factual basis for the causes of action alleged against him.
 
Defendant did not file a reply.
 
MEET
AND CONFER REQUIREMENT
 
            Under Code of Civil Procedure
section 430.41, before filing a demurrer, the moving party must meet and confer
in person or by telephone with the party who filed the subject pleading at
least five days before the responsive pleading is due. (Code Civ. Proc., §
430.41, subd. (a).) If the parties are not able to meet and confer at least
five days prior to the date demurrer or motion to strike must be filed, the
demurring/moving party shall be granted an automatic 30-day extension of time
within which to file a demurrer or motion to strike, by filing and serving, on
or before the date on which a demurrer or motion to strike would be due, “a
declaration stating under penalty of perjury that a good faith attempt to meet
and confer was made and explaining the reasons why the parties could not meet
and confer.” (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 430.41, subd. (a)(2), 435.5, subd. (a)(2).)
 
            Here, the Court finds that Defendant
failed to establish compliance with the meet and confer requirement of Section
430.41.  In support of the demurrer,
Defendant submitted the Declaration of Carla D. Allen (“Allen”), counsel for
Defendant, who stated that she was personally served with the complaint on June
26, 2023, making Defendant’s responsive pleading due July 26, 2023.  On July 26, 2023, Allen called Plaintiff to
meet and confer, but Plaintiff was not available.  Allen left a message advising that she would
be filing a demurer on the basis that the claims should have been filed in
probate court.  (Allen Decl. ¶¶
4-5.)  
 
            Based on Allen’s declaration, the
Court finds that the meet and confer requirement of Section 430.41 has not been
satisfied.  First, Defendant did not
reach out to Plaintiff until the day the responsive pleading was due, and second,
Defendant did not actually speak to Plaintiff to substantively discuss the
merits of the demurrer prior to filing.  
 
But the failure to sufficiently meet and confer is not grounds to
either overrule or sustain a demurrer. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd.
(a)(4); Dumas v. Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors (2020) 45
Cal.App.5th 348, 355.)
 
As such, the Court continues the hearing on the Demurrer to October
26, 2023 at 8:30 A.M. in Department 207, and orders a conference of the
parties under Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41 on or before October 13,
2023 to permit the parties an opportunity to resolve the issues informally
and/or for Plaintiff to file and serve an amended complaint in advance of the
continued hearing on October 26, 2023.  Following the meet and confer process, if Defendant
intends to proceed with the demurrer, Defendant shall file a supplemental declaration
of counsel demonstrating compliance with Section 430.41 on or before October
20, 2023.  
 
Defendant shall provide notice of the Court’s orders and file a proof
of service regarding the same.
