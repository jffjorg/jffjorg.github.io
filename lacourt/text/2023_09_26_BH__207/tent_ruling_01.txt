Defendant Pamela Estelle Rumph



 
BACKGROUND
 
            Plaintiff Villa
Erripa, LLC (“Plaintiff”, filed an unlawful detainer complaint against
Defendants Walter Adrian (Defendant Adrian), Pamela Estelle Rumph (Defendant
Rumph), and DOES 1 through 10, on October 21, 2019.  Defendants Adrian and Rumph were married
until Defendant Adrian’s death on August 16, 2022.  (See Rumph Decl. attached to March 22, 2023
Opposition to Motion for Judgment, ¶ 8.)
 
            At the
unlawful detainer trial on January 21, 2020, the Court was apprised that
Defendants had vacated the property as of January 20, 2020, so the Court
converted the action to an ordinary civil action, pursuant to Civil Code
section 1952.3, to recover the back-owed rent, and set an initial case
management conference.  (See January 22,
2020 Notice of Ruling.)
 
On August 21, 2020, the Court
consolidated this case with Case No. 20SMCV00015, also filed by Plaintiff Villa
Erripa, LLC against Defendants Adrian and Rumph, pertaining to a promissory
note that preceded the unlawful detainer.
 
            On November
8, 2021, the parties filed a Notice of Conditional Settlement and Joint Request
for an Order Dismissing the Action with a Reservation of Jurisdiction to Vacate
the Dismissal as Needed to Enforce the Settlement, which the Court granted.
 
            On February
16, 2023, Plaintiff moved to vacate the dismissal and to enter judgment against
Defendants on the basis that Defendants had breached the settlement agreement,
and had stipulated to a judgment in the event of their breach.  The settlement agreement, attached as Exhibit
A to the Declaration of Victoire Poumadere, provided that Defendants were to
pay a total of $30,200 by paying $2,000 up front, and thereafter making monthly
payments of $600 over the following 47 months. 
Upon paying the initial $30,200, Defendants would submit themselves to an
examination to determine their financial condition, and potentially pay
additional sums, depending on the status of Defendants’ financial condition.
 
            The
settlement agreement further provided that in the event any of the payments
were not timely made, Plaintiff was to provide notice and 10 days to cure.  In the event Defendants did not cure the
untimely payment within 10 days, of in the event Defendants were late on three
payments in any twelve month period (regardless of whether those late payments
were ultimately cured), Defendants would be in breach of the agreement, and stipulate
to a joint and several judgment against them in the amount of $181,928.60,
representing a principal sum of $150,000 for both consolidated actions,
$1,534.85 in costs, and $30,393.75 in attorneys’ fees, “plus interest thereon
at the rate of 10% per annum from November 1, 2021, pursuant to California Code
of Civil Procedure section 685.010(a).” 
(Ex. A to Poumadere Decl.)  
 
            Plaintiff
argued that Defendants had breached the agreement by failing to timely cure the
delinquent October 2022 payment and utterly failing to make the November 2022,
December 2022, January 2023, and February 2023 payments.  (See Motion to Vacate Dismissal at pp. 18-28
and Poumadore Decl. ¶¶ 14-15 and Ex. D thereto.)  As such, Plaintiff sought a judgment in the
amount of $204,140.75, representing the $181,928.60 enumerated in the
stipulated judgment, plus 10% interest from November 1, 2021 through February
16, 2023, in the amount of $24,257.15; plus $4,555 in costs and attorneys’ fees
incurred in bringing the motion to vacate dismissal and enter judgment; minus
$6,600 in payments Defendants had already made. 
(See Motion to Vacate at p. 9:16-28; Poumadere Decl. ¶¶ 18-19; Eccles
Decl. ¶¶ 4-7 and Ex. F thereto.)
 
            In
Opposition, Defendant Rumph produced a death certificate, demonstrating that
Defendant Adrian died on August 16, 2022. 
She also argued that she did not receive notice of the delinquent
October payment and timely cured the delinquent November payment.  The Court found that either way, Defendant
Rumph breached the settlement agreement as to one payment for the
October-November time period.  Defendant
Rumph also made various other arguments as to why Plaintiff’s motion should be
denied, including that the stipulated judgment amount represented an
unenforceable penalty, which the Court ultimately rejected.
 
            On April
26, 2023, the Court granted Plaintiff’s motion, finding that Defendants had
breached the terms of the agreement, and Plaintiff was entitled to a stipulated
judgment, pursuant to the terms of the agreement.  The Court deferred entering an order, setting
a court date for July 25, 2023, and ordering the parties to file a joint report
at least 5 court days prior to the hearing, regarding what the orders the Court
should issue regarding the judgment .
 
            On July 18,
2023, the parties filed a joint report wherein Plaintiff requested a several
judgment against Defendant Rumph only, while the case remained open until
Defendant Adrian’s estate could be probated, and an estate representative could
be appointed, and then added to this lawsuit. 
Defendant sought $207,166.11, representing the $181,928.60 stipulated
principal amount, plus $31,837.51, representing 10% interest for the 21 months
between November 1, 2021 and July 31, 2023, minus the $6,600 in payments already
received, and sought an additional amount to be determined for costs and fees
incurred in bringing the motion to set aside dismissal.
 
            In the
joint report, Defendant objected “to the imposition of interest prior to entry
of judgment in this case, as an unenforceable penalty and in violation of the
new amendments to C.C.P. 685.010 capping interest on principal amounts up to
$50,000 at 5% for personal debts.” 
(Joint Report at p. 4:6-8.) 
Defendant also objected to the several judgment against Defendant Rumph
only and requested a judgment against “all defendants on this matter relating
to a debt owed by both defendants[.]”  (Id.
at p. 4:9-11.)
 
            At the July
25, 2023 hearing, the Court continued the OSC re: What Orders Should Issue and
permitted the parties to file and serve supplemental points and authorities, no
more than five (5) pages, regarding interest calculation as to Defendant Rumph.  (July 25, 2023 Minute Order.)  The Court also noted that Plaintiff
represented to the Court at that hearing that Plaintiff may open a creditor’s
claim within a probate matter within a year of Defendant Adrian’s death, or
prior to August 16, 2023.  (Ibid.)
 
            Plaintiff
and Defendant Rumph both filed supplemental briefs on September 18, 2023.  Plaintiff’s brief does not address the
interest calculation as to Defendant Rumph, but rather reiterates Plaintiff’s
position that judgment should be entered severally against Defendant Rumph
only, and argues the case should remain open as to Defendant Adrian, “until a
determination is made as to whether Plaintiff’s claim against Adrian can or
cannot be made or pursued as a matter of fact or law.”  (Plaintiff’s Supplemental Brief at p. 4:5-7.)  Plaintiff also concedes that it has not yet opened
a creditor’s claim within a probate matter as to Defendant Adrian.  (Id. at p. 4:21-23.)
 
            Defendant
Rumph’s supplemental brief acknowledges it is within the Court’s discretion to
render judgment severally against Defendant Rumph only, but urges the Court to
decline to render a severable judgment, on the basis that it “would be a
wasteful duplicaion [sic] of judicial assets and could lead to inconsistent
rulings on the same set of facts and circumstances which involve the same debt
and allegations against co-debtors.” 
(Defendant Rumph’s Supplemental Brief at p. 2:17-19.)  Defendant Rumph also urges the court not “to
rush to issue separate judgments” before Plaintiff decides whether to open a
probate creditor’s claim against Defendant Adrian. (Id. at p. 2:25-27.)
 
            Defendant
Rumph also argues that the pre-judgment interest is overstated because (1) the
amount is not “certain” pursuant to Civil Code section 3287 in light of the
fact that the parties did not know if or when the breach would occur; (2)
Plaintiff is not entitled to prejudgment interest from November 21, 2021
through October 2022, during which time Plaintiff was “receiving the full
benefit of the bargain under the Settlement Agreement installment payments” (Id.
at p. 3:25-26); (3) to the extent the date for computing damages was
contracted, regardless of the uncertainty of the future date of breach, such
clause is an unenforceable penalty; and (4) the maximum amount recoverable
under the settlement agreement was $80,200, which cannot justify the $181,000
judgment requested.
 
            Defendant
Rumph calculates the interest owed as $16,677, which apparently represents 10%
annual interest on the $181,928.60 judgment amount for the 11 months between
October 15, 2022 and September 26, 2023, plus any post-judgment interest,
subject to the 5% limitations for personal debt under Code of Civil Procedure
section 585.010, subdivision (a)(2)(A)(ii).
 
ANALYSIS
 
            Several
Judgment
 
            The parties
concede it is within the Court’s discretion to issue a several judgment against
Defendant Rumph only.  (See Code Civ.
Proc., § 579 [In an action against several defendants, the Court may, in its
discretion, render judgment against one or more of them, leaving the action to
proceed against the others, whenever a several judgment is proper.])  Here, the settlement agreement provides (1)
the Premises was leased to the Defendants, jointly and severally; and (2)
following payment of the initial $30,200, Defendants were to each appear for an
examination of “the Defendants [sic] financial position, jointly and severally[.]”  (See Ex. A to Poumadere Decl. in support of
Motion to Vacate Dismissal, ¶¶ 2.a., 4.) 

 
            The stipulated
judgment attached to the settlement agreement, which Defendants also both
signed, and which was to be held by Plaintiff and filed only in the event of a
breach of the settlement agreement, also provides “that judgment herein shall
be entered in favor of Plaintiff and against each of the Defendants, jointly
and severally [….]”  (Stipulation for
Entry of Judgment, ¶ 1.)
 
            Defendant
Rumph’s arguments that entering judgment against her severally will lead to a
duplication of judicial resources and risk inconsistent judgments is
unavailing.  
 
First, the Court notes that
Defendant Adrian died on August 16, 2022, but the settlement agreement was not
breached until October or November 2022. 
Thus, because the breach occurred after Defendant Adrian’s death, Defendant
Adrian is differently situated from Defendant Rumph, and there may be no viable
claim against Defendant Adrian at all.  
 
Second, the Court finds that
Plaintiff has been dilatory in opening a probate matter to assert a claim
against Defendant Adrian’s estate.  At
this juncture, it is unclear whether Plaintiff is willing and able to timely
bring any such claim against Defendant Adrian’s estate.  
 
As such, the Court finds that a
several judgment against surviving Defendant Rumph alone is appropriate e, and
exercises its discretion to enter a several judgment against Defendant Rumph.
 
Amount of Judgment
 
The stipulated judgment provides
for entry of a judgment in the amount of $181,928.60, representing a principal
sum of $150,000 for both consolidated actions, plus $1,534.85 in costs, and
$30,393.75 in attorneys’ fees, “plus interest thereon at the rate of 10% per
annum from November 1, 2021, pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure
section 685.010(a).”  (Ex. A to Poumadere
Decl.)  
 
With respect to the argument
Defendant Rumph raised in the joint report, that a rate of 10% is improper
because Code of Civil Procedure section 685.010, subdivision (a)(2) caps
interest on principal amounts up to $50,000 at 5% for personal debts, the Court
finds this provision inapplicable, because the principal on the personal debt
owed in this case is $150,000, which is far greater than $50,000.  Thus, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 685.010, interest accrues at the rate of 10 percent per annum, which is
also what the stipulated judgment calls for.
 
            Defendant
Rumph arguments that (i) the stipulated judgment is uncertain as to the amount
of interest because of the vagueness regarding whether and when the settlement
agreement would be breached, and (ii) the interest should not start to accrue
until October 2022 when the breach occurred, are faulty.  
 
These arguments conflate the breaches
of the original agreements (the promissory note and residential lease agreement,
damages pursuant to which total $150,000), with breach of the settlement
agreement (pursuant to which Plaintiff agreed to accept $30,200, depending on
Defendants’ financial condition, in exchange for timely payments.)  As the Court already explained in the April 26,
2023 Minute Order, Plaintiff agreed to accept a large discount on the total
amount owed, in exchange for timely payments from Defendants.  If Defendants breached the settlement
agreement by failing to timely make or cure payments owed, the remedy is
Plaintiff may enter the stipulated judgment for the full amount owed under the
promissory note and lease agreement, plus costs, attorneys’ fees, and 10%
annual interest accruing from November 1, 2021 (roughly the date the settlement
agreement was reached).  The Court also notes
that this already represents a discount on the prejudgment interest, which
would otherwise accrue from 2019 when Defendants became delinquent on the
outstanding debts owed in connection with the promissory note and the residential
lease agreement.  
 
            Thus, the Court
finds the 10% interest properly accrues from November 1, 2021 under the terms
of the settlement agreement and is easily “capable of being made certain by
calculation” under Civil Code section 3287.
 
            However,
Defendant Rumph is partially correct that adjustments should be made with
respect to interest accruing between November 1, 2021 and October 2022.  Code of Civil Procedure section 685.020,
subdivision (a) provides “interest accrues at the rate of 10 percent per annum on
the principal amount of a money judgment remaining unsatisfied.”  (Emphasis  added.)  First, the principal amount is $150,000, not
$181,928.60.  Second, no interest should
accrue with respect to the $6,600 Defendants have already paid.  Thus, the proper amount of interest is ($150,000
- $6,600) * 10% per year for 23 months[1],
or $27,485.00, not the $31,837.51 Plaintiff previously requested (representing
10% annual interest on the full $181,928.60 for 21 months).
 
            Defendant
Rumph’s third and fourth arguments, that the interest clause in the stipulated
judgment is an unenforceable penalty, and the maximum amount recoverable
pursuant to the settlement agreement of $80,200 cannot justify the $181,000
judgment requested were already considered and rejected by the Court in
connection with its April 26, 2023 decision.
 
            Attorneys’
Fees and Costs
 
            Although
not addressed by Defendant Rumph, the Court notes that the agreement and
stipulated judgment allow only for “the principal sum of $150,000, together
with costs of the suit involved herein totaling $1,534.85, including Attorney’s
Fees in the amount of $30,393.75 (for a total judgment of $181,928.60) plus
interest thereon at the rate of 10% per annum from November 1, 2021.  Thus, Plaintiff may not recover attorneys’
fees in excess of $30,393.75, pursuant to the stipulated judgment.  
 
            With
respect to costs, Code of Civil Procedure section 1032, subdivision (b)
provides, “Except as otherwise expressly provided by statute, a prevailing
party is entitled as a matter of right to recover costs in any action or
proceeding.”  The parties may stipulate
to “alternative procedures” with respect to awarding costs, but must follow the
rules adopted by the judicial counsel pursuant to Section 1034, which includes
what costs are allowable.  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1032, subd. (c).)  Thus, although
Plaintiff may have been entitled to recoup other allowable costs as a prevailing
party per Section 1032, Plaintiff’s claim for costs as part of the judgment to
be entered  is limited to what the
parties agreed to under the stipulated judgment which is  $1,534.85.
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
            The Court
finds it appropriate to enter an order severally against Defendant Rumph.    
 
Pursuant to the terms of the
settlement agreement and stipulated judgment, Plaintiff is entitled to several
judgment against Defendant Rumph in the amount of $202,813.60, representing $181,928.60
in damages provided for in the stipulated judgment (encompassing a principal
sum of $150,000, costs in the amount of $1,534.85, and attorneys’ fees in the
amount of $30,393.75), plus prejudgment interest in the amount of $27,485.00,
minus the $6,600.00 Defendants have already paid.  
 
Plaintiff must submit a proposed
several judgment as to Defendant Rumph only, with terms in conformance with
this order, on or before October 10, 2023. 

 
The case remains open and pending
as to Defendant Adrian.
 
            The Court
sets a Status Conference on ______________ at 8:30 A.M. in Department 207
regarding the status of Plaintiff’s claim against Defendant Adrian’s estate.  
 
            Plaintiff
to provide notice of the Court’s ruling and file a proof of service regarding
the same.
