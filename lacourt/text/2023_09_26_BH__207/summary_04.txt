And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by Defendant James Dostal, administrator of the Estate of Joseph Dostal, to all three causes of action alleged in Plaintiff Gina Teresa Sanchez's complaint. The demurrer argues that the claims belong in probate court, not in civil litigation, and that the complaint fails to allege the causes of action with requisite specificity.

The judge has found that the Defendant failed to meet and confer with the Plaintiff prior to filing the demurrer, as required by Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41. However, the judge notes that this failure does not automatically require the demurrer to be overruled.

The judge has continued the hearing on the demurrer to October 26, 2023, and has ordered a conference of the parties under Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41 to permit the parties to resolve the issues informally and/or for the Plaintiff to file and serve an amended complaint in advance of the continued hearing. The Defendant is required to file a supplemental declaration of counsel demonstrating compliance with Section 430.41 on or before October 20, 2023, if they intend to proceed with the demurrer.
