## English Summary

This tentative ruling concerns a demurrer filed by Defendant James Dostal, the administrator of the Estate of Joseph Dostal, against Plaintiff Gina Teresa Sanchez.  

The dispute revolves around money allegedly owed to Plaintiff by the decedent's estate based on two agreements: one between Plaintiff and Joseph Dostal while he was alive, and another between Plaintiff and Defendant after Joseph Dostal's death.

Defendant argues that the claims should be handled in probate court, not civil litigation, and that the Complaint lacks sufficient specificity.

The judge finds that Defendant failed to properly meet and confer with Plaintiff before filing the demurrer. However, this procedural error does not automatically dismiss the demurrer.

The hearing on the demurrer is continued to October 26, 2023. The parties are ordered to meet and confer by October 13, 2023, to attempt to resolve the issues. Plaintiff may also file an amended Complaint before the continued hearing.

summary:
The Judge's tentative ruling is about a dispute over money allegedly owed to Plaintiff by the decedent's estate, based on two agreements. Plaintiff filed a complaint with three causes of action for breach of contract and common counts. Defendant, the administrator of the Estate of Joseph Dostal, demurred on the grounds that the claims were brought in the wrong forum (probate court) and the complaint fails to allege the causes of action with requisite specificity. Plaintiff opposes the demurrer. The Judge finds that Defendant failed to meet and confer prior to filing the demurrer, but the failure to sufficiently meet and confer is not grounds to overrule or sustain a demurrer. The hearing on the Demurrer is continued to October 26, 2023, and orders a conference of the parties to permit the parties an opportunity to resolve the issues informally or for Plaintiff to file and serve an amended complaint in advance of the continued hearing on October 26, 2023.
