And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Court has considered the motion for judgment on the pleadings and the alternative motion in limine filed by Defendants Garfield Beach CVS LLC and Deborah Padilla. The motion for judgment on the pleadings was filed on the ground that the cause of action for defamation per se is barred by the statute of limitations. The Court has denied the motion for judgment on the pleadings.

The Court has granted the alternative motion in limine with the exception noted above. The exception is that Plaintiffs may present evidence regarding the Pineda statement for the stated purpose, which is to show the original discriminatory intent of Mr. Pineda when he precluded Plaintiff Martinez from using the restroom on false pretenses. The Court has ruled that Plaintiffs may not assert or imply in the opening statement, during questioning or in closing argument that the statement itself is a separate basis for liability as to CVS.

The Court has also noted that the relation-back doctrine does not apply to the new allegations in the Third Amended Complaint, and that the delayed discovery rule is not applicable in this case. The Court has denied Plaintiffs’ request to revive a stale claim by repeating the allegedly defamatory statement in a litigation context.

The Court has ordered Defendants to provide notice of this ruling.
