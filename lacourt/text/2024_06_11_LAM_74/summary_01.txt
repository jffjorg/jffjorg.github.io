And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Elicia Johnson vs 800 Mariposa, L.P., et al. The Plaintiffs have failed to allege grounds for punitive damages against the Defendant Calvo Group, as they have not alleged any intentional conduct by the Defendant. The Plaintiffs have only alleged unintentional conduct, including the Defendant's disregard of complaints relating to Young. Without more information, the Plaintiffs have failed to establish malice, fraud, or oppression. The Plaintiffs did not file an opposition to the motion to strike, and therefore have failed to establish that the defect can be cured with leave to amend. As a result, the Defendant Calvo Group's motion to strike portions of the Complaint and Prayer for Punitive Damages is granted without leave to amend.
