  Case Number:  22STCV02666    Hearing Date:   June 11, 2024    Dept:  74 ELICIA JOHNSON vs 800 MARIPOSA, L.P., et al. 22STCV02666Motions to StrikeBased
on the complaint allegations, Plaintiffs fail to allege grounds for punitive
damages against Calvo Group.  Plaintiffs
do not allege any intentional conduct by Defendant Calvo Group.  At best, Plaintiffs have alleged
unintentional conduct, including Defendants’ alleged disregard of two years of unspecified
complaints relating to Young.  Without
more information, including the types of complaints received by Defendants
relating to Young, Plaintiffs fail to allege malice, fraud or oppression.  
            Plaintiffs did not file an
opposition to the motion to strike.  
Plaintiffs therefore fail to establish that the defect can be cured with
leave to amend.  (Hendy v. Losse
(1991) 54 Cal.3d 723, 742.)  
            Defendant Calvo Group’s Motion to
Strike Portions of Jaqueline Campbell and Suzanne McKenzie’s Complaint and
Prayer for Punitive Damages is granted without leave to amend.
            Defendant Calvo Group’s Motion to
Strike Portions of Elicia Johnson’s Complaint and Prayer for Punitive Damages
is granted without leave to amend.  
Defendant Calvo Group is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
