Background
 
On October 9, 2024, Silvia Garcia, Jose Jesus Licea and Miguel
Esparza (“Plaintiffs”) filed a Complaint against Lehmans Hardware, Inc.
(“Defendant”) for violating the California Invasion of Privacy Act (“CIPA”). After the Court sustained Defendant’s demurrer,
Plaintiffs filed the operative First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) alleging
violations of CIPA. 
 
Defendant now demurs to
the FAC. Plaintiffs oppose the demurrer. The matter is now before the court. 
 
Demurrer[1]
 
I.         Legal Standard
 
Where pleadings are defective, a party may raise the defect
by way of a demurrer. (Coyne v. Krempels (1950) 36 Cal.2d 257, 262.) A
demurrer tests the sufficiency of a pleading, and the grounds for a demurrer
must appear on the face of the pleading or from judicially noticeable matters.¿
(CCP, § 430.30(a); Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) In
evaluating a demurrer, the court accepts the complainant’s properly pled facts
as true and ignores contentions, deductions, and conclusory statements. (Daar
v. Yellow Cab Co. (1976) 67 Cal.2d 695, 713; Serrano v. Priest (1971)
5 Cal.3d 584, 591.) Moreover, the court does not consider whether a plaintiff
will be able to prove the allegations or the possible difficulty in making such
proof. (Fisher v. San Pedro Peninsula Hospital (1989) 214 Cal.App.3d
590, 604.) 
Leave to amend must be allowed
where there is a reasonable possibility of successful amendment. (Goodman v.
Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.)¿ The burden is on the complainant to
show the Court that a pleading can be amended successfully. (Ibid.)
 
II.        Request for Judicial Notice
 
The court may
take judicial notice of “official acts of the legislative, executive, and
judicial departments of the United States and of any state of the United
States,” “[r]ecords of (1) any court of this state or (2) any court of record
of the United States or of any state of the United States,” and “[f]acts and
propositions that are not reasonably subject to dispute and are capable of
immediate and accurate determination by resort to sources of reasonably
indisputable accuracy.” (Evid. Code § 452, subds. (c), (d), and (h).) “Taking
judicial notice of a document is not the same as accepting the truth of its
contents or accepting a particular interpretation of its meaning.” (Joslin v. H.A.S. Ins. Brokerage (1986) 184 Cal.App.3d 369, 374.)
 
Plaintiffs’ requests
judicial notice of the following: 
 
Exhibit 1: First Amended Class
Action Complaint filed on November 2, 2023 in Balletto, et al. v. American
Honda Motor Co., Inc., No. 4:23-cv-01017-JSWC (N.D. Cal. Nov. 2, 2023) (RJN Ex.
1).
 
Plaintiffs fails to
explain the relevance of Exhibit 1 or that it is the proper subject of judicial
notice because it requires formal proof and is not capable of immediate and
accurate determination. “ ‘Judicial notice is the recognition and acceptance by
the court, for use by the trier of fact or by the court, of the existence of a
matter of law or fact that is relevant to an issue in the action without
requiring formal proof of the matter.’ ” (Lockley v. Law
Office of Cantrell, Green, Pekich, Cruz & McCort (2001) 91
Cal.App.4th 875, 882.) 
court may take judicial notice of something that cannot reasonably be
controverted, even if it negates an express allegation of the pleading. (Columbia
Casualty Co. v. Northwestern Nat. Ins. Co. (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 457,
468–469.)
 
The
request for judicial notice is denied. 
 
III.      Discussion
 
Penal
Code § 631(a) is part of the California Invasion of Privacy Act (“CIPA”). “CIPA
prohibits any person from using electronic means to ‘learn the contents or
meaning’ of any ‘communication’ ‘without consent’ or in an ‘unauthorized
manner.’” (In re Facebook, Inc. Internet Tracking Litigation (9th Cir.
2020) 956 F.3d 589, 607 citing Pen. Code, § 631(a).) Liability only applies to
third parties, not parties to the communication. (Ibid; see Warden v.
Kahn (1979) 99 Cal.App.3d 805 [“[S]ection 631 ... has been held to apply
only to eavesdropping by a third party and not to recording by a participant to
a conversation.”]) 
 
“The
California Supreme Court has interpreted § 631(a) to contain three operative
clauses, which cover three distinct and mutually independent patterns of
conduct: (1) ‘intentional wiretapping,’ (2) ‘willfully attempting to learn the
contents or meaning of a communication in transit over a wire,’ and (3)
‘attempting to use or communicate information obtained as a result of engaging
in either of the two previous activities.’ (Martin v. Sephora USA, Inc.
(E.D. Cal., Mar. 30, 2023, No. 1:22-CV-01355-JLT-SAB) 2023 WL 2717636, at p. *6
(Martin) citing Tavernetti v. Superior Court (1978) 22 Cal.3d
187, 192.) “Section 631(a) also provides for liability for third party
violations of the statute by containing an aiding and abetting provision, which
imposes liability on a defendant who ‘aids, agrees with, employs, or conspires
with any person or persons to unlawfully do, or permit, or cause to be done any
of the acts or things mentioned [in Section 631(a)].’ [Citation.]” (Heiting
v. Taro Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. (C.D. Cal., Apr. 2, 2024, No.
2:23-CV-08002-SPG-E) 2024 WL 1626114, at p. *4.) 
 
The FAC alleges
violations of the second clause of the CIPA and the aiding and abetting
provision: 
 
Defendant’s chat provider, The Third Party, violates the
second clause of section 631(a) of the Penal Code, and Defendant violates the
fourth clause or prong because it “aids, agrees with, employs, or conspires
with” The Third Party to allow The Third Party to intercept, eavesdrop upon,
learn, share, and monetize the contents of Defendant’s chat conversations. 
 
(FAC, ¶ 29.)
 
Penal
Code § 631(a), states in the relevant part: 
 
Any person . . . [2]
who willfully and without the consent of all parties to the communication, or
in any unauthorized manner, reads, or attempts to read, or to learn the
contents or meaning of any message, report, or communication while the same is
in transit or passing over any wire, line, or cable, or is being sent from, or
received at any place within this state...or [4] who aids, agrees with,
employs, or conspires with any person or persons to unlawfully do, or permit,
or cause to be done any of the acts or things mentioned above in this
section...[is liable]. 
 
“First, if a third party
listens in on a conversation between the participants (even if one participant
consents to the presence of that third party), then the third party is liable
under the second prong (and the participant is often liable under the fourth
prong).” (Javier v. Assurance IQ, LLC (N.D. Cal. 2023) 649 F.Supp.3d
891, 897–898 (Javier).) “Second, a party to a conversation can record it
without the other party's knowledge without incurring Section 631 liability.” (Id.)

 
The Complaint alleges
that “[t]o enable the eavesdropping, Defendant secretly pays a third party
doing business as ‘Comm100’ (“The Third Party”) to embed its chat technology
code into the chat feature offered on Defendant’s Website.” (FAC, ¶ 10.) As
Defendant is a party to the chat conversation, only the Third Party, can be
held liable under the second prong of section 631(a). “It is never a secret to
one party to a conversation that the other party is listening to the
conversation; only a third party can listen secretly to a private
conversation.” (Rogers v. Ulrich (1975) 52 Cal.App.3d 894, 899 (Rogers).)
Accordingly, Defendant’s liability stems from aiding and abetting that Third
Party in violating the second prong of section 631(a). 
 
First, Defendant argues
that the Comm100 is not a third party but an extension of Defendant, precluding
liability under the second and fourth prongs of section 631(a). 
 
“The first set of cases
holds that software providers like ActiveProspect are third parties within the
meaning of Section 631 and [Ribas v. Clark (1985) 38 Cal.3d 355] . . .The second set of cases, led by Judge Beeler in [Graham v. Noom, Inc. (N.D. Cal. 2021) 533
F.Supp.3d 823],View Options

holds that software vendors like
ActiveProspect are ‘extension[s]’ of the websites that employ them, and thus
not third parties within the meaning of the statute.” (Javier,  supra,  649
F.Supp.3d at p. 899.) 
 
Whether Comm100 is a third party or an extension of Defendant
hinges on whether there is an allegation that the third party “used the data
for their own benefit and not for the sole benefit of the party to the
communication.” (Javier,  supra,  649
F.Supp.3d at p. 899.) 
 
Here, the FAC alleges that “Defendant enables and allows a third
party that has no corporate affiliation with Defendant to eavesdrop on all such
conversations.” (FAC, ¶ 8.) “The Third Party is capable of using the
intercepted chat communications for its own purposes beyond simply supplying
such communications back to Defendant.” 
(Id. ¶ 18.) “[T]he third party provided data from such
transcripts to Meta through “integration” with Meta software.” (Id. ¶
25.) “The Third Party acquires Website visitors’ chat communications by first
having its software route them to The Third Party’s own computer servers that
it owns, controls, and maintains.” (Id. ¶ 11.) “[W]hen the software
provider could put that information to other uses on its own accord, it
functions more like a person, listening in on a conversation, as in Rogers.”
(Heiting v. Taro Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. (C.D. Cal. 2023) 709
F.Supp.3d 1007, 1016.) 
 
The court finds the FAC sufficiently alleges that Comm100 is a
third-party eavesdropper and not an extension of Defendant. 
 
Next, Defendant argues that the FAC fails to allege that Defendant
knowingly intended to aid and abet in the CIPA violations. Defendant urges the
court to adopt the strict common law definition to aiding an and abetting for
purposes of CIPA violations. “[I]n  the
absence of a statutory definition for aiding and abetting, prior courts have
applied the common law definition of aiding and abetting.” (Rodriguez v.
Ford Motor Company (S.D. Cal. 2024) 722 F.Supp.3d 1104, 1123 see Fiol v.
Doellstedt (1996) 50 Cal.App.4th 1318, 1325–1326 [“ ‘ Liability may ... be
imposed on one who aids and abets the commission of an intentional tort if the
person (a) knows the other's conduct constitutes a breach of duty and gives
substantial assistance or encouragement to the other to so act or (b) gives
substantial assistance to the other in accomplishing a tortious result and the
person's own conduct, separately considered, constitutes a breach of duty to
the third person.’ ”]; see also Cal. Jury Instr.--Crim. 3.01.)
 
The court finds that section 631(a) imposes a broader liability
that is not limited specifically to the narrow common law definitions of
“aiding and abetting.” Section 631(a) extends liability to any person who “who
aids, agrees with, employs, or conspires with any person or persons to
unlawfully do, or permit, or cause to be done any of the acts or things
mentioned above in this section” not just to persons who aid and abet in CIPA
violations. “Section 631, subdivision (a), broadly prohibits the interception
of wire communications and disclosure of the contents of such intercepted
communications.” (Tavernetti v. Superior Court (1978) 22 Cal.3d 187,
190.) 
 
Consequently, Defendant is liable if it
aids, agrees with, employs, or conspires with the third party to violate CIPA.
(See Cousin v. Sharp Healthcare (S.D. Cal. 2023) 681 F.Supp.3d 1117,
1130 [“Defendant's contention that “aids” means “aiding and abetting” ignores
the “agrees with, employs, or conspires with” language of the clause. Defendant
provides no case law requiring the Court to analyze “aids, agrees with,
employs, or conspires with” as solely “aiding and abetting.”].) Furthermore, “[a]iding
and abetting may be shown by circumstantial evidence.”
People v. Glukhoy (2022)
77 Cal.App.5th 576, 599.) 
 
The FAC alleges that Defendant allows a third party to eavesdrop
on its conversation and such conduct is not due to the ordinary course of
business. (FAC, ¶¶ 8, 9.) “Defendant secretly pays a third party doing business
as ‘Comm100’ (‘The Third Party’) to embed its chat technology code into the
chat feature offered on Defendant’s Website.” (Id. ¶ 10.) “[A]ll of the
schemers – Defendant, The Third Party, and Meta – profit from secretly
exploiting the chat data through targeted social media advertising because
“Targeted advertising allows brands to send different messaging to different
consumers based on what the brand knows about the customer.” (Id. at p.
17.) The Third Party’s eavesdropping is “known to and enabled by Defendant
under CIPA.” (Id. at p. 19.) “Defendant intentionally caused the
internet communication between Plaintiffs and Defendant’s website to be
recorded. Defendant also aided, agreed with, employed, or conspired with a
third party to eavesdrop upon such conversations during transmission and in
real time.” (Id. ¶ 32.) 
 
The court finds that the above allegations support the allegations
that Defendant aided or employed, or conspired with, or permitted, or caused
the Third Party to violate CIPA. 
 
Based on the above, the
demurrer is overruled. 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant’s demurrer is overruled.
Defendant must file an Answer within 10 days, by January 
21, 2025.
