And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling on a demurrer with motion to strike in a lemon law action. The plaintiff, Juan Hernandez-Marquez, filed a First Amended Complaint on October 26, 2023, and the defendant, General Motors LLC, filed a demurrer and motion to strike on November 27, 2023. The plaintiff then filed a request for dismissal on March 19, 2024, but the dismissal was not entered because the attorney's address on the form did not match the address on record with the court. The defendant withdrew its demurrer and motion to strike on March 29, 2024. As the parties have agreed that the Fourth Cause of Action is no longer at issue, the court cannot process the dismissal of this cause of action until the plaintiff files another request for dismissal or does so on the record during the hearing. The court will consider this tentative ruling at the hearing on April 5, 2024, and may adopt it as the final order or place the motion off calendar if the parties fail to submit their intentions to the court.
