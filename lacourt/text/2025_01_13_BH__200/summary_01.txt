And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion in limine filed by the Executor of the Estate of Ricardo Holguin, seeking to exclude expert testimony from Michelle van de Pol, a real estate appraiser. The expert report in question estimates the market rent for a subject property. The Executor argues that the report should be excluded because it assumes the property was properly managed, the expert did not inspect the property, and the report is based on assumptions. However, the Objectors, including Martin Holguin, Marco Holguin, Alysha Fax, Vanessa McGowan, and Richard Holguin, argue that the motion seeks a ruling on legal issues concerning the Executor's duties, which is outside the scope of the expert testimony. The court agrees with the Objectors and concludes that the motion is an improper attempt to summarily adjudicate legal issues. The court also finds that the bases for the motion go to the weight to be given to the expert report, not its admissibility. Therefore, the court denies the motions.
