The judge has also noted that the Defendant's production of partial responses to the Plaintiffs' requests for production is deficient and has ordered the Defendant to provide a sworn statement stating that he has produced all existing documents which are responsive to each request for production or to specify the basis for withholding any documents or information within documents.

The judge has also noted that the Defendant's attorney, Jacquelene A. Robinson (Marcott), did not describe any method to ensure that the Defendant had produced all responsive documents, and has ordered the Defendant to provide a declaration describing his efforts to produce all responsive documents.

## Case Summary:  Zaldivar v. Lee

**Case Number:** 19STCV20803

**Hearing Date:** September 26, 2023

**Court:** Superior Court of the State of California, Los Angeles County, Northeast District

**Plaintiffs:** Elva Zaldivar, Stephanie Zaldivar, Marina Zaldivar (individually and as successors in interest to Jose Zaldivar)

**Defendant:** Sean Lee

**Other Involved Parties:** 

* **Steve Lee and Tracy Lee:** Defendants in the original lawsuit, granted summary adjudication on negligence claim under Labor Code section 3706, but their renewed motion for summary judgment is scheduled for December 5, 2023.
* **Sweety Novelty, Inc. ("Sweety"):** Non-party, frozen desserts factory owned by Steve Lee and Tracy Lee, leased to Sweety.
* **John Woods:** Independent contractor who worked for Sweety, hired by Defendant to perform general maintenance and was involved in the project where Zaldivar was injured.
* **Stacey Lee:** Head of legal department at Jessie Lord’s Bakery in March 2018.
* **Patty Lee:** Sales manager at Sweety since 2005, had no discussions with Defendant regarding Woods' work at Sweety.
* **Gloria Knowles:** Testified that Defendant was her boss and instructed her to assist in the investigation of Zaldivar's death.

**Background:**

* Jose Zaldivar died while working on improvements at Sweety's factory on March 4, 2018.
* Plaintiffs allege that Defendant, as Sweety's General Manager, retained Woods, an unlicensed contractor, who hired Zaldivar.
* Zaldivar was allegedly working on a defective cage/basket while being hoisted by a forklift when he fell and died. Plaintiffs argue this was due to negligence.

**Discovery Dispute:**

* Plaintiffs seek text messages between Defendant and the aforementioned individuals from January 1, 2017, to December 31, 2018.
* Defendant initially objected and produced limited text messages, claiming others do not exist.
* Plaintiffs argue Defendant's production is incomplete and untimely, particularly regarding gaps in communication between Defendant and Woods and Knowles.
* Plaintiffs request a forensic examination of Defendant's cell phone to ensure completeness of production.

**Judge's Ruling (Tentative):**

* Grants Plaintiffs' motion in part, ordering Defendant to provide further verified, Code-compliant supplemental responses to Requests for Production Nos. 8, 12, and 13 within 10 days.
* Denies the request for a forensic examination at this time, stating Plaintiffs must first serve a formal inspection demand for Defendant's cell phone.
* Notes Defendant's supplemental responses are deficient and lack a statement specifying whether compliance is "in whole or in part."

 **Significance:**

* The judge is questioning the completeness of Defendant's production of documents, particularly text messages, which are relevant to the negligence claims against him.
* The ruling sets a course for further investigation and potential discovery disputes related to the content and completeness of Defendant's communications.
