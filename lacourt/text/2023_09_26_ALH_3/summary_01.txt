And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel further discovery responses and documents filed by the Plaintiffs in a wrongful death action against the Defendant. The Plaintiffs are seeking to compel the Defendant to produce additional text messages and other documents related to the project that led to the death of Zaldivar, who was working at a frozen desserts factory owned by Sweety Novelty, Inc.

The judge has granted the motion in part, ordering the Defendant to provide further verified, Code-compliant supplemental responses to certain requests for production within 10 days of the date of the order. The judge has also noted that the Defendant's production of partial responses to the Plaintiffs' requests for production is deficient and has ordered the Defendant to provide a sworn statement stating that he has produced all existing documents which are responsive to each request for production or to specify the basis for withholding any documents or information within documents.

The judge has also noted that the Defendant's attorney, Jacquelene A. Robinson (Marcott), did not describe any method to ensure that the Defendant had produced all responsive documents, and has ordered the Defendant to provide a declaration describing his efforts to produce all responsive documents.
