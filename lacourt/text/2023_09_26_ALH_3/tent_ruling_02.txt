     CASE NO.:  20BBCV00430
 
[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER RE: DEFAULT PROVE-UP HEARING 
 
Dept.

8:30
  a.m.

On August 29, 2023, plaintiff Gisele
Rosen (“Plaintiff”) filed a request for court judgment on Form CIV-100
requesting a default judgment of $162,168.84 against defendants Paramount
Headquarters, Inc. and Paramount Headquarters, Inc. dba Paramount Pavers &
Construction, consisting of $100,000 in damages, $525 in costs, and $61,643.84
in prejudgment interest. 
Plaintiff’s application for default
judgment remains deficient because there is showing of how interest was
calculated. (CRC 3.1800, subd. (a)(3).) Also, although the request is for a
judgment against two defendants, only one defendant is named in the proposed
judgment because Attachment 5a is blank. 
The hearing on the application for
default judgment is CONTINUED to October 30, 2023 at 8:30 a.m. in Department 3
of the Alhambra Courthouse.  Plaintiff
must file a revised Form CIV-100, any document showing interest computations as
necessary,  and a revised proposed
judgment on Form JUD-100 10 days before the next hearing.  
 
Dated
this 25th
day of September, 2023
