Summary:

The judge's tentative ruling denies the defendant's motion to strike references to punitive damages from the plaintiff's complaint. The court finds that the complaint sufficiently pleads a basis for punitive damages against the defendant based on malice or oppression. The plaintiff alleges that the defendant wrongfully withheld funds and delayed the resolution of the matter, causing the plaintiff and his family to suffer financial hardship. The court finds that the defendant's alleged conduct, as pled, may be considered malicious and oppressive, and denies the motion to strike. The defendant is ordered to file and serve its answer to the complaint within 30 days.
