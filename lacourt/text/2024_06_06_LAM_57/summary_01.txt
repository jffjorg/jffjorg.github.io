And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling is that State Farm's motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication is denied. The court finds that there are disputed issues of material fact that prevent the entry of summary judgment or summary adjudication. The plaintiffs, Hicham Zerhouni and Wafae Bencherkoun, have presented evidence that raises triable issues of fact on whether the car crash occurred as reported and whether the plaintiffs breached their obligations under the insurance policy. The court concludes that it is for a jury at trial to resolve the plaintiffs' claims for breach of contract and bad faith, rather than for the court to decide on summary judgment or summary adjudication.
