 Case Number:  23STCV11271    Hearing Date:   June 6, 2024    Dept:  57 Pending before the Court is Plaintiff Arminda Gomez Barrera's ("Plaintiff") Motion to Compel Defendant Nissan North America, Inc. ("Nissan:) to Provide Further Responses to Plaintiff's Request for Production of Documents, Set One,("RFPs").  The RFP numbers in question are 16, 19, 20, 21, 32, and 42.  The Court is granting Plaintiff's Motion.  Plaintiff has demonstrated good cause for the Court to require Nissan to provide further responses (but not attorney-client privileged material) to each of the RFPs.  The Court is limiting the scope of RFP Number 19 to cover only vehicles of the same make, year, and model as the vehicle that is the subject of Plaintiff's lawsuit against Nissan.  In the Court's view, Nissan's objections to the RFPs are without merit.  Nissan must provide Plaintiff with the further responses to the RFPs by July 18, 2024.
