English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Black v. Premium. Plaintiff Black alleges that she was sexually harassed and assaulted while working for Defendants Pretium Packaging, LLC, Pretium Holding, LLC, Pretium PKG Holdings, Inc., and Richard Davis. The Defendants argue that the case should be transferred to Orange County, as Plaintiff did not work in Los Angeles County. The judge disagrees, finding that the FEHA venue statute requires that the case be tried in the county where the plaintiff would have worked, which is Los Angeles County. The judge also denies the Defendants' request for attorney's fees and costs, finding that their reading of the statute is reasonable but not supported by case law. The judge sets a deadline of 10 days for the Defendants to file their responsive pleading.
