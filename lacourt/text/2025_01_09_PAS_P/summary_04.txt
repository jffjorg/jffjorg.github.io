```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies HG's motion for leave to file a Second Amended Cross-Complaint (SACC) without prejudice. HG sought to add new causes of action and parties to the cross-complaint, arguing that new facts discovered by its counsel required the amendments. However, the judge finds that HG's motion does not comply with the procedural requirements of California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1324(a) and (b). Specifically, HG failed to identify the specific allegations being added or removed, along with their precise location in the amended pleading, and did not fully address the requirements of Rule 3.1324(b). The judge concludes that the proposed amendments are not properly presented and denies the motion without prejudice, allowing HG to refile if it addresses the procedural deficiencies.
