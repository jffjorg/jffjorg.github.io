 Case Number:  23AHCV01272    Hearing Date:   January 9, 2025    Dept:  P [TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING
DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO WITHDRAW STIPULATION FOR REFEREE and DENYING NON-PARTY
STEPHEN J. DONELL’S REQUEST FOR ORDER I.         INTRODUCTION
Plaintiffs, Scott Marshall-Kimball,
and Julie Kimball, as Co-Trustees of the Gail Diann Fromm Family Trust dated
November 11, 1980 (“Plaintiffs”), filed this action on June 5, 2023, against
Defendants Cheryl L. Cuccia and Layne M. Cosloff, as Trustees of their
respective trusts (“Defendants”). On November 22, 2023, Plaintiffs filed their
First Amended Complaint, asserting causes of action for partition, accounting,
breach of fiduciary duty, and declaratory relief. The dispute arises from the
co-ownership of a multi-unit commercial property located at 9331 East Valley
Blvd., Rosemead, California (“Subject Property”), where Plaintiffs seek a
partition by sale due to irreconcilable differences regarding the management
and disposition of the property.
On November 12, 2024, the parties
entered into a stipulation to appoint Stephen J. Donell as the partition
referee to oversee the sale and accounting of the Subject Property. However, on
December 11, 2024, Defendants filed a motion to withdraw the stipulation,
citing unforeseen financial burdens and mistake. On December 23, 2024,
Plaintiffs filed an opposition, arguing that Defendants had not demonstrated
good cause to withdraw from the stipulation and that Mr. Donell had diligently
fulfilled his duties.
On December 3, 2024, Mr. Donell
filed an application with the Court seeking an order authorizing the referee to
retain legal counsel, a real estate broker, and a certified public
accountant. 
The Court now considers both the
application and Defendants’ motion to withdraw the stipulation for
determination.
II.        LEGAL STANDARD
Rule 3.906(a) provides:  
 
A motion to withdraw a stipulation
for the appointment of a referee must be supported by a declaration of facts
establishing good cause for permitting the party to withdraw the
stipulation. 
 
(Cal. Rule of Court 3.906(a).) 
III.      ANALYSIS
Defendants argue that good cause
exists under California Rules of Court, rule 3.906(a), to withdraw the
stipulation appointing Stephen J. Donell (“Mr. Donell”) as the partition
referee due to the unforeseen financial burden imposed by Mr. Donell’s retention
of outside counsel and other professionals. Specifically, Defendants contend
that the anticipated costs, exceeding $80,000, are disproportionately higher
than the estimated costs of hiring an alternative referee such as Matthew
Taylor who estimates $15,000-$20,000 costs in fees. (Motion, p. 3; Niman Decl.,
¶¶ 3, 5) Defendants assert that this substantial and unanticipated financial
burden constitutes reasonable ground for the relief sought. (Motion, p.4)
Alternatively, Defendants argue
that the stipulation should be set aside due to mistake, inadvertence, or
excusable neglect under Code of Civil Procedure section 473(b). Defendants
assert that their counsel mistakenly believed Mr. Donell would handle all legal
services in-house and were unaware of his intention to retain outside counsel
at a significant additional cost. They contend that this misunderstanding
constitutes a valid basis for relief under section 473(b), as the stipulation
would not have been agreed to had the true financial implications been known
(Motion, p. 5; Niman Decl., ¶¶ 3, 7, 14).
In Opposition, Plaintiffs argue
that Defendants have failed to establish good cause for withdrawing from the
stipulation appointing Mr. Donell as the partition referee. Plaintiffs contend
that the stipulation explicitly contemplated the retention of professionals,
including legal counsel, and that Defendants had ample opportunity to
investigate and understand the potential costs before agreeing to the
stipulation (Opposition, pp. 3-4). Plaintiffs emphasize that Mr. Donell’s fees
and the anticipated costs of hiring professionals were foreseeable and
disclosed in the stipulation and related documents, including Mr. Donell’s
declaration stating his hourly rate (Opposition, p. 3; Luc Decl., ¶ 5).
Plaintiffs further argue that
Defendants’ claim of mistake is unfounded, as Defendants’ counsel failed to
exercise reasonable diligence in reviewing the terms of the stipulation and
understanding the role of the referee. (Opposition, p.4). Plaintiffs argue that
Mr. Donell has diligently fulfilled his duties as the partition referee by
addressing property maintenance issues, coordinating with tenants, and
organizing the sale process. Plaintiffs assert that replacing Mr. Donell would
disrupt the progress thus far and unnecessarily complicate the proceedings.
(Opposition, p. 5). They contend that Defendants’ proposal to appoint Mathew
Taylor is not a viable alternative, as Mr. Taylor would rely on a property
management company, which violates the terms of the stipulation (Opposition, p.
6).
While good cause is not bound by
rigid legal formalism, it must be reasonably related to legitimate needs and
supported by a concrete factual exposition (Estate of Kerkorian (2018)
19 Cal.App.5th 709, 713; People v. Accredited Surety & Cas. Co.
(2014) 230 Cal.App.4th 548, 558). Here, Defendants highlight that Mr. Donell’s
fees, coupled with those of his outside counsel, far exceed the anticipated
costs, arguing this constitutes good cause to revisit the stipulation (Niman
Decl., ¶¶ 3-4).
The Court finds that Defendants
have sufficiently demonstrated that the unanticipated financial burden
associated with Mr. Donell’s retention of outside professionals constitutes
good cause under rule 3.906(a). Professionals in the field, such as Mr. Taylor,
estimate costs significantly lower—between $15,000 and $20,000—which starkly
contrasts with the upwards of $80,000 projected for Mr. Donell’s services
(Niman Decl., ¶ 5). While the stipulation permitted Mr. Donell to retain
professionals, the possibility of such high costs was not clearly indicated,
making the financial burden beyond the parties’ reasonable expectations.
Given that Defendants did not
foresee the substantial costs associated with Mr. Donell’s services, and good
cause is a discretionary determination based on the circumstances of the case,
the Court finds that Defendants have shown good cause to withdraw the
stipulation. The Court orders a conference to appoint a new referee and ensure
that Mr. Donell is compensated for his services rendered thus far.
Motion for issuance of an order authorizing Mr. Donell
to retain professionals
Mr. Donell filed a motion seeking
authorization to retain (1) legal counsel, (2) a real estate broker, and (3) a
certified public accountant. However, given that the Court grants Defendants’
motion to be relieved from the stipulation appointing Mr. Donell as the
partition referee, the Court DENIES Mr. Donell’s motion to retain these
professionals.
            IV.       CONCLUSION
The Court GRANTS Defendants’ motion
to be relieved from the stipulation appointing Mr. Donell as the partition
referee.
The Court DENIES Mr. Donell’s
motion to retain legal counsel, real estate broker and certified public
accountant. 
The Court orders a status
conference to address the appointment of a new referee or an alternative method
for appraisal.
The Court further orders that Mr.
Donell be compensated for his services rendered to date.
Defendants to give notice.
