  Case Number:  23AHCV00952    Hearing Date:   January 9, 2025    Dept:  P [TENTATIVE] ORDER DENYING
DEFENDANT’S MOTIONS TO COMPEL FURTHER INTERROGATORIES AND REQUEST FOR
PRODUCTION – SET ONE and DENYING REQUEST FOR MONETARY SANCTIONS. I.         INTRODUCTION
On April 28, 2023, Plaintiff Perla Mageno (“Plaintiff”) filed this action
against Defendant Prapatsorn Group, Inc. (“Defendant”) for violations of the
Unruh Civil Rights Act, California Civil Code § 51.
 
On August 18, 2024, Defendant filed motions to compel further responses
to Special and Form Interrogatories- Set One and Request for Production - Set
One.
On December 26, 2024, Plaintiff filed opposition to both motions. No
reply has been filed.
Meet and confer
A motion to compel further discovery responses must be accompanied by a
meet and confer declaration stating, “facts showing a reasonable and good faith
attempt at an informal resolution of each issue presented by the motion.” (Code
Civ. Proc. §§ 2031.310, subd. (b)(2); 2016.040.)
Here, Defendant’s counsel initiated the meet-and-confer process by
sending a letter to Plaintiff’s counsel on May 16, 2024, outlining specific
concerns regarding Plaintiff’s initial responses to the Requests for
Production. Defendant allowed Plaintiff additional time to address these
concerns, setting a deadline of June 28, 2024. Plaintiff submitted supplemental
responses on June 28, 2024. However, Defendant reviewed the supplemental
responses and found them insufficient. Defendant emailed Plaintiff’s counsel on
July 11, 2024, to raise further concerns but did not engage in any additional
follow-up before filing the motions to compel on August 14, 2024. (Sahelian
Decl., ¶¶ 5-15.)
The Court finds that while Defendant made an initial attempt to meet and
confer, these efforts lacked sufficient follow-up to fully resolve the disputes
before filing the motions. 
II.        LEGAL STANDARD
A motion to compel a further
response to interrogatories or production of documents must be noticed within
45 days of the service of the verified response, or any supplemental verified
response, or on or before any specific later date to which the propounding
party and the responding party have agreed in writing.  (Cal. Code of Civ.
Proc. §§ 2030.300(c), 2031.310(c); see also Sexton v. Superior Court
(1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1409; Vidal Sassoon, Inc. v. Superior Court
(1983) 147 Cal.App.3d 681, 685).) Otherwise, the propounding party waives any
right to compel further responses. (Id.) The 45-day time limit is
mandatory and jurisdictional.  (Sexton, supra,58 Cal. App. 4th at
1410.)   
            An
unverified response is tantamount to no response at all. (See Appleton v.
Superior Court (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 632, 636.)  However, objections
to interrogatories and requests for production are not required to be verified
because “objections are legal conclusions interposed by counsel, not factual
assertions by a party.” (Blue Ridge Insurance Co. v. Superior Court
(1988) 202 Cal.App.3d 339, 345.)
III.      ANALYSIS
            Defendant
moves the Court to compel Plaintiff to provide further responses to Form and
Special Interrogatories - Set One and Request for Production - Set One, and for
monetary sanctions in the amounts of $2, 551.02 and $2,166.02.
Defendant served the discovery
requests on May 15, 2024. While Plaintiff provided initial responses, Defendant
argues that they were incomplete and evasive. Defendant filed the motions on
August 14, 2024, asserting that Plaintiff failed to provide substantive
responses to several interrogatories and document requests and raised meritless
objections. Motion, p. 3; Sahelian Decl., ¶¶ 4-15).
In opposition, Plaintiff argues
that Plaintiff had already served further supplemental responses to Defendant’s
discovery requests before the hearing. Plaintiff contended that the
supplemental responses fully addressed the alleged deficiencies and rendered
the motions moot. Additionally, Plaintiff argued that Defendant failed to
properly meet and confer before filing the motions, as required by California
Code of Civil Procedure section 2016.040. 
The Court finds that given that
Plaintiff has provided further responses prior to the hearing, the motion is
rendered MOOT.
Therefore, the Court DENIES
Defendants motions to compel further.
Sanctions
Code of Civil Procedure §2023.030
grants the court discretion to impose sanctions against any party engaging in a
misuse of the discovery process. Misuse includes the failure to respond to
authorized discovery methods or disobeying a court order to provide discovery.
(Code Civ. Proc., §2023.010, subds. (d), (g).) Further, CCP §2030.300(d)
mandates that the court impose monetary sanctions against any party who
unsuccessfully opposes a motion to compel further responses to interrogatories,
unless that party acted with substantial justification or if imposing sanctions
would be unjust. 
Here, Defendant seeks monetary
sanctions for both motions totaling $4,717.04 (Sahelian Decl., ¶¶ 16-17).
Plaintiff opposes the imposition of
sanctions, arguing that the motions are moot because Plaintiff has provided
supplemental responses both in the past and prior to the hearing. Plaintiff
supplemented its discovery responses on June 28, 2024, following Defendant’s
initial meet-and-confer efforts, and again submitted further responses shortly
before the hearing to address any remaining concerns. (Opposition, pp. 2-3)
The Court finds that Plaintiff’s
ongoing efforts to respond demonstrate substantial justification. Additionally,
Plaintiff provided further responses prior to this hearing. Furthermore, the
Court finds that Defendant’s meet-and-confer efforts lacked sufficient
follow-up to efficiently resolve disputes before the filing of the motions to
compel further. 
Based on the foregoing, the Court
DENIES Defendant's request for monetary sanctions.
IV.       CONCLUSION AND ORDER
            The Court DENIES
Defendant’s motions to compel further as moot and DENIES request for monetary
sanctions.
            Defendant is
to give notice.
