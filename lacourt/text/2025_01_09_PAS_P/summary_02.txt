And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to withdraw the stipulation appointing Stephen J. Donell as the partition referee and the request for an order authorizing Mr. Donell to retain legal counsel, a real estate broker, and a certified public accountant. The court has granted the motion to withdraw the stipulation, finding that the unforeseen financial burden associated with Mr. Donell's retention of outside professionals constitutes good cause under California Rules of Court, rule 3.906(a). The court has denied Mr. Donell's motion to retain the professionals, citing the court's order to appoint a new referee. The court has also ordered a status conference to address the appointment of a new referee or an alternative method for appraisal, and has ordered Mr. Donell to be compensated for his services rendered to date.
