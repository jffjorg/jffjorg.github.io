 Case Number:  23AHCV01996    Hearing Date:   January 9, 2025    Dept:  P [TENTATIVE] ORDER DENYING
DEFENDANT BARRY NUA’S MOTION TO COMPEL RESPONSES TO FORM INTERROGATORIES - SET
ONE, SPECIAL INTERROGATORIES - SET ONE AND REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION - SET ONE and
GRANTING MONETARY SANCTIONSI.               
INTRODUCTION
This is a premises liability case. On January 5, 2024, Plaintiff Salvador
Carrillo ("Plaintiff") filed a First Amended Complaint (FAC) against
Defendants Barry Nua, PGK Partners, and Greystar Properties
("Defendants"), alleging causes of action for (1) Battery, (2)
Negligent Hiring, Supervision, and Retention, and (3) Negligent Premises
Liability.
On December 10, 2024, Defendant Barry Nua (“Defendant”) filed motions to
compel Plaintiff’s initial responses to Form Interrogatories, Special
Interrogatories, and Requests for Production, Set One. On December 27, 2024,
Plaintiff opposed the motions and served responses to the discovery. On January
2, 2025, Defendant filed a reply, arguing that Plaintiff’s responses were
untimely and inadequate.
The Court combines both discovery motions—motions to compel initial
responses to Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, and Requests for
Production, Set One—into this tentative ruling.
II.  LEGAL
STANDARD
A propounding party may move to compel responses to requests for
production of documents where the responding party fails to provide responses.
(CCP § 2031.300.) The responding party must provide responses within thirty
days after the demand is served. (CCP § 2031.030(c)(2) & (3).) The
responding party waives all objections, including privilege and work product,
by failing to timely respond to requests for production of documents. (CCP §
2031.300.)¿
Under Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.290(a), if a party fails to
respond to interrogatories, they waive any objections, including those based on
privilege or work product protection. When a party does not provide timely
responses, the propounding party is entitled to move for an order compelling
responses. Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.290(b), the Court
must order the responding party to provide responses without objections.
III.  ANALYSIS
Here, Defendant moves for an order compelling Plaintiff to respond to
Request for Production, Set One, and Form and Special Interrogatories, Set One.
Defendant propounded these discovery requests on August 26, 2024. Defendant
asserts that Plaintiff failed to serve timely responses by the statutory
deadline of September 27, 2024. (Lee decl., ¶¶ 3–8) Defendant further argues
that Plaintiff served responses only after the motions were filed and that the
responses provided are untimely and inadequate.
In opposition, Plaintiff argues that the motions should be denied as moot
because responses were served on December 12, 2024, prior to the hearing.
Plaintiff contends that the delays were caused by administrative oversight and
asserts that Defendant has not suffered any prejudice. (Opposition, pp. 1–3;
Declaration of Ralph Rios, ¶¶ 2–5¿)
In reply, Defendant argues that the untimely responses fail to comply
with the Code of Civil Procedure and that significant deficiencies remain.
Defendant highlights that Plaintiff’s responses contain improper objections,
fail to include promised documents, and inadequately address specific
interrogatories and requests for production. (Reply, pp. 2–4)
Here, while Plaintiff’s responses were served late, they were provided
before the hearing. The Court acknowledges Defendant’s frustration with the
untimely responses and notes the long list of alleged deficiencies. However,
the proper remedy to address these issues is a motion to compel further
responses, not a motion to compel initial responses.
The Court finds that Defendant’s motions to compel initial responses to
Form Interrogatories and Requests for Production are moot, as Plaintiff served
responses prior to the hearing. Under California law, once discovery responses
are served, the appropriate remedy to address the adequacy of those responses
is a motion to compel further responses pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
sections 2030.300 (interrogatories) and 2031.310 (requests for production).
Such motions must be filed within 45 days of service of the responses and only
after good faith meet-and-confer efforts to resolve the matter informally.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (c)). 
 The Court orders counsel to meet
and confer to attempt to resolve these outstanding discovery matters without the Court’s involvement.  The
Court reminds the parties that civil discovery is intended to be a
self-executing system with minimal judicial intervention.  (See Volkswagenwerk Aktiengesellschaft v.
Superior Ct. (1981) 122 Cal.App.3d 326, 331; Clement v. Alegre
(2009) 177 Cal.App.4th 1277, 1291-1292.)
 
Accordingly, the motions to compel initial responses are MOOT.
V.        SANCTIONS
CCP § 2023.030 authorizes the Court to issue sanctions against a party
engaging in conduct that is a misuse of the discovery process. Failure to
respond to discovery, evasive responses, and objections lacking substantial
justification are “misuses of the discovery process.” (CCP § 2023.010, subd.
(d)-(f).)¿
Here, Defendant seeks monetary sanctions for Plaintiff’s failure to
timely respond to Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, and Requests
for Production, arguing that Plaintiff’s delay necessitated the filing of these
motions. Defendant initially requested $888.00 in sanctions for the motion to
compel responses to Form and Special Interrogatories, based on an hourly rate
of $185.00 and an estimated 4.8 hours of work. (Lee Decl., ¶ 11.) For the
motion to compel responses to Requests for Production, Defendant requested
$499.50 in sanctions, based on an hourly rate of $185.00 and an estimated 2.7
hours of work, including 0.5 hours on legal research, 0.8 hours drafting the
motion, 0.3 hours preparing exhibits, 0.5 hours reviewing Plaintiff’s
opposition, and 0.6 hours drafting the reply. (Lee Decl., ¶ 10.)
Plaintiff opposes sanctions, contending that the failure to respond was
due to administrative oversight which was corrected upon notice from Defendant.
(Opposition, p. 3.) However, the Court finds that Plaintiff’s explanation is
insufficient to constitute substantial justification. 
Given this, the Court reduces Defendant’s monetary sanctions request to
reflect reasonable time spent on these motions.  The Court finds that 2
hours of preparation and drafting, 1 hour for replying to the opposition, and 1
hour for attending the hearing for both motions, at an hourly rate of $185.00.
This amounts to a total of $740.00 for both motions.
The Court awards $740 in sanctions to be paid within 20 days of this
order. 
 
VI.       CONCLUSION AND ORDER
The Court DENIES Defendants’
motions to compel as MOOT.
The Court GRANTS Defendants’
request for monetary sanctions in the amount of $740.00 to be paid within 20
days of this order.
Defendants to give notice.
