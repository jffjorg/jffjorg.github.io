## Tentative Ruling Summary:

**Case:** Michelle and Anthony Bernardino v. American Honda Motor Co.

**Judge:** Theresa M. Traber, Department 47

**Hearing Date:** September 27, 2023

**Summary:**

The court sustained Defendant American Honda Motor Co.'s demurrer to the fifth cause of action (fraudulent concealment) in Plaintiff's lemon law case.  

**Reasons for Sustaining Demurrer:**

* **Insufficient Specifics:** The complaint lacked specific details regarding the representations allegedly made by Defendant that were concealed, making it difficult to assess the claim for fraudulent concealment.
* **No Clear Duty to Disclose:** While Plaintiffs alleged Defendant knew about defects in their infotainment systems, they didn't clearly establish a  direct relationship or duty to disclose this information to subsequent purchasers like Plaintiffs.

**The Court's Decision:**

* **Sustained Demurrer:** The demurrer was sustained with leave to amend, meaning Plaintiffs have 30 days to revise their complaint.
* **Moot Motion to Strike:** The motion to strike portions of the complaint became moot due to the sustained demurrer.

**Key Points:**

* Plaintiffs are alleging a lemon law violation due to defects in their 2019 Honda Pilot, specifically in the infotainment, electrical, transmission, and engine systems.
* The central issue is whether Defendant had a duty to disclose known defects to Plaintiffs, who bought the vehicle after the potential defects were allegedly already public knowledge.
* Plaintiffs need to provide more specific details about the representations made by Defendant and the concealment of information to strengthen their fraudulent concealment claim.



Let me know if you need further clarification on any of these points.
