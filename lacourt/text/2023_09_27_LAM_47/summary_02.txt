## Tentative Ruling Summary: Shenghua Entertainment v. CineLou Films, LLC

**Case Number:** 22STCV34604

**Hearing Date:** September 27, 2023

**Judge:** Theresa M. Traber

**Plaintiffs:** Shenghua Entertainment and Shenghua Entertainment Communication Co., Ltd. (foreign corporations organized in Taiwan)

**Defendants:** After Dark Films, LLC, CSS Entertainment, LLC, California Maple Holdings, LLC, and Courtney Solomon

**Core Issue:** Defendants' motion to require Plaintiffs to provide security for attorney's fees and costs.

**Judge's Ruling:** **GRANTED**.  Plaintiffs must provide a security undertaking of $360,000 within 30 days.

**Reasoning:**

* **Plaintiffs are foreign corporations:** This satisfies the first requirement for a motion to require security under California Code of Civil Procedure section 1030(a).
* **Defendants have a reasonable possibility of prevailing:**  
    * Defendants argue they are unlikely to be found liable as alter egos of other defendants involved in the case.
    * Defendants presented evidence refuting Plaintiffs' claims of alter ego, including:
        * Declarations stating no commingling of funds, no personal liability assumption, and separate operations for each company.
    * Plaintiffs' evidence relied heavily on a declaration in English from a witness who claimed not to speak English, making it unreliable. 
    * Defendants' estimate of $960,085 in costs and fees was deemed excessive by the court, which settled on $360,000.

**Key Points:**

* **Alter Ego Doctrine:** This case hinges on the "alter ego" doctrine, which holds a corporation's owner personally liable when the corporation is merely an extension of the owner.
* **Security for Costs:**  California law allows defendants to require foreign plaintiffs to provide a financial guarantee (security) to cover potential costs if they win the case.
* **Credibility of Evidence:** The judge highlighted the importance of credible evidence, dismissing a declaration due to a language discrepancy.

**Next Steps:**

* Plaintiffs must file a $360,000 undertaking within 30 days.
* The case will proceed on its merits, with the alter ego dispute as the central issue.
