And here is the English-text summary:

In this tentative ruling, Judge T Walker grants Defendant Hyundai Motor America's Motion to Tax Costs, striking the entirety of the Memorandum of Costs filed by Plaintiff Richard Walker. The court finds that the parties' Settlement Agreement requires Plaintiff to seek fees, costs, and expenses in a single motion, which was already heard on April 7, 2023. Plaintiff failed to comply with this stipulation by not including costs in the prior motion for attorneys' fees. The court concludes that there is good cause to strike the entire Memorandum of Costs and grants the motion.
