 Case Number:  22VECV02146    Hearing Date:   November 1, 2023    Dept:  T 22VECV02146 FLORES V LIEB
[TENTATIVE] ORDER: 
Defendants Ortal and Itay Leib’s Motion for Release of Property from
Lien and Request for Fees in the amount of $2,375.00 and Costs in the amount of
$61.65 is GRANTED against Plaintiff Elian Flores.
Introduction 
Defendants Ortal and Itay Leib (collectively, Defendants)
moved to release their property from a March 23, 2022 mechanic’s lien recorded
by Plaintiff Elian Flores (Plaintiff). 
Defendants further requested attorneys’ fees of $2,375.00 and costs of
$61.65.  Plaintiff’s Opposition was due
October 19, 2023 but none was filed.
Discussion  
Defendants argued that Plaintiff failed to file an action to
foreclose on the lien within 90 days. 
(Civ. Code, sec. 8460.)  The
mechanic’s lien was recorded on March 23, 2022 and the instant action was filed
on November 28, 2022 (which also did not include a claim to foreclose).  The action was filed past the 90-day deadline
and the untimeliness of the action is grounds to release the lien.  Further, the instant action was effectively
dismissed by the September 14, 2023 sustaining of Defendants’ demurrer without
leave to amend.  These facts present good
cause for the requested relief.
The motion to release the property from the mechanic’s lien
is GRANTED.
Defendants further requested $2,375.00 in fees and $61.65 in
costs.  (Civ. Code, sec. 8448(c).)  In that Defendants are the prevailing party
on the action and the fees/costs are seen to be reasonable in amount,
Defendants’ request for fees and costs is GRANTED 
IT IS SO ORDERED, CLERK TO GIVE NOTICE.
