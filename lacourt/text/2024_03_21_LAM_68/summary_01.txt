Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion to compel further responses to form interrogatories filed by the plaintiff, Marc Bensemhoun. The defendants, ROHCS Property Management Co., opposed the motion, arguing that it is moot since the parties settled the unlawful detainer action. The plaintiff denied any settlement agreement and argued that the agreement only applies to the separate unlawful detainer action.

The judge declines to deny the motion based on the settlement agreement and instead finds that the reliance on the settlement agreement as a bar to responding to the current, remaining active case constitutes a facially invalid response. The judge also finds that the relevance objection and incomplete responses to the form interrogatories are insufficient.

The judge orders the defendant to serve revised responses within 30 days of this order. The judge also encourages the parties to meaningfully meet and confer and sets a case management conference for April 12, 2024.
