And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a lemon law action brought by Alfredo Tomas Chavez Garcia against American Honda Motor Co., Inc. The plaintiff seeks to compel the deposition of the defendant's person most qualified and custodian of records, as well as request production of documents. The defendant opposes the request, arguing that the plaintiff did not notice the deposition in August 2023 and only applied for relief three days prior to the discovery cut-off date. The court finds that the plaintiff was not diligent in requesting the hearing prior to the cut-off of discovery. As a result, the court grants the plaintiff's ex parte application in part, advancing the motion to compel from November 6, 2024 to May 1, 2024, and continuing the briefing schedule accordingly.
