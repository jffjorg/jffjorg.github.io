And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge Natalie Tenaud regarding a wrongful death action brought by Natalie Tenaud, Breanne Rose Aguilar, Stevie Brynn Aguilar, and the Estate of Byrant Aguilar against the State of California. The plaintiffs have filed an ex parte application to advance the hearing date on their motion to compel the defendant to comply with their demand for inspection of tangible things, land, or other property. The defendant argues that the expert discovery cutoff is March 28, 2024, and it would be impractical to hear the motion and allow inspection before that date. However, the court notes that the inspection took place on December 13, 2022, and the plaintiffs filed their motion on February 8, 2024. The court finds that the plaintiffs would be irreparably harmed if they are not allowed to have their motion heard prior to the discovery cut-off dates. Therefore, the court grants the plaintiffs' ex parte application and advances the hearing date for their motion to compel from September 24, 2024, to March 19, 2024, at 9:30 a.m. in Department SE-C.
