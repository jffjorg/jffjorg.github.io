 Case Number:  22NWCV00588    Hearing Date:   March 1, 2024    Dept:  C Alfredo
Tomas Chavez Garcia vs American Honda Motor Co., Inc., Case No. 22NWCV00588
This is a lemon
law action. 
Plaintiff
Alfredo Tomas Chavez Garcia brings this ex parte application Shortening Time
for Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel the Deposition of Defendant American Honda
Motor Co., Inc.’s Person Most Qualified and Custodian of Records and Request
for Production of Documents.
A party may
seek ex parte relief upon an affirmative factual showing "irreparable
harm, immediate danger, or any other statutory basis for granting relief ex
parte." (Cal. R. Ct. 3.1202(c).)
Trial in this
matter is scheduled for April 5, 2024. Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel is not set
to be heard until November 6, 2024, which would leave no time for Defendant to
provide further responses prior to the discovery cut-off for the current trial
date in the event Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel is granted. 
The Court notes
that Defendant opposes the ex parte on the grounds that Plaintiff did not
notice the Deposition in August 2023 when provided available dates. Defendant
further argues that Plaintiff applies for the relief only three days prior to
the discovery cut-off date. The Court notes that Plaintiff did offer dates in
January 2024 and February 2024, which were not responded to. 
The Court
determines that Plaintiff was not diligent in requesting the hearing prior to
the cut-off of discovery.  Therefore, Plaintiff’s ex parte application is
GRANTED in part.  Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel the Deposition of Defendant
American Honda Motor Co., Inc.’s Person Most Qualified and Custodian of Records
and Request for Production of Documents is ADVANCED from November 6, 2024 and
CONTINUED to May 1, 2024 at 9:30 a.m. in Dept. SE-C.  Briefing
schedule is in accordance with the new hearing date.  Plaintiff is not
foreclosed from requesting a trial continuance in Dept. SE-F. 
Plaintiff to
give notice.
