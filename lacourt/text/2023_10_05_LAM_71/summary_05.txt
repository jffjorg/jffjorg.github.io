```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the demurrer filed by Defendant Florentino Apeles to Plaintiff National Robertson Car Wash Care Inc.'s second amended complaint. The court finds that the plaintiff's complaint fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action against the defendant. Specifically, the complaint fails to allege the alleged assignment or plead its terms verbatim, and the plaintiff's argument that it sufficiently alleged the lease transferred by the acts of the parties is unavailing. Additionally, the court finds that Car Care Consultant, Inc., a former Nevada corporation, lacked the ability to assign the Lease Agreement to the plaintiff due to its permanent revocation. Based on these findings, the court sustains the defendant's demurrer to the plaintiff's second amended complaint without leave to amend.
