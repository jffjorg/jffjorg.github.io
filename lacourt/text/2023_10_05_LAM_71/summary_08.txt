And here is the summary in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Victor Ceban v. Wink Labs, Inc. et al. The Court denies the Plaintiff's default judgment packet and sets a hearing on an order to show cause why the complaint should not be dismissed and/or the Plaintiff's counsel should be sanctioned $250. The reasons for this decision include:

1. The request for Court Judgment (CIV-100) was not completed correctly.
2. The judgment amount exceeds the amount stated in the Prayer for Relief in the Complaint, which is against the law.
3. Exhibit A, which supports the breach of contract cause of action, has not been authenticated.
4. The interest calculation is incorrect.

The Court also sanctions the Plaintiff's counsel $250 for failing to enter the default judgment. The hearing will be held on November 6, 2023, at 8:30 AM in Department 71 at the Stanley Mosk Courthouse.
