  vs.
 
WINK LABS, INC., et al.


 Case
  No.:  23STCV08375
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  October 5, 2023



 
The Court denies Plaintiff’s default judgment packet.  
The Court sets a hearing on an order to show cause why the
complaint should not be dismissed and/or Plaintiff’s counsel sanctioned $250
for failing to enter default judgment (California Rule of Court, rule 3.110(h))
on November 6, 2023, at 8:30 AM in Department 71 at Stanley Mosk Courthouse for
the following reasons:

1.    
No request for Court Judgment (CIV-100)
a.     
Memorandum of Costs submitted on incorrect form (MC-010). Needs to be
submitted on the second page of the CIV-100. However, memorandum of costs are
competed on requests for entry of default.
b.    
No declaration of nonmilitary status on Court Judgment. However,
declaration is included on the requests for default.
2.    
Judgment does not seek an amount that is equal to or less than the amount
stated in the Prayer for Relief in the Complaint.  (See, e.g., Falahati v. Kondo (2005) 127 Cal.App.4th 823, 830-831 [finding
court acts in excess of its jurisdiction and the resulting default judgment is
void if the court awards default judgment in an amount greater than that
demanded in the complaint, including if the complaint does not specify the
amount demanded].
3.    
Plaintiff has not authenticated Exhibit A in support of the breach of
contract cause of action.
4.    
Incorrect interest calculation. Plaintiff needs to provide calculations
of annual interest rate for 10% of a specified principal for a number of days
the interest accrued.
