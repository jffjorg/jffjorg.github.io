And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled on the case between Mohill Holdings LP (Plaintiff) and LA-Fig Parking Lot Lessee, LLC (Defendant). The case involves an unlawful detainer action by Plaintiff against Defendant, who demurred under Code of Civil Procedure section 430.10(c) based on a pending arbitration. The judge is concerned that Plaintiff is trying to circumvent the arbitration agreement and may be engaging in "gamesmanship." The judge has ordered that the case be continued to January 4, 2024, at 1:30 p.m. for a hearing on Defendant's demurrer and to allow Defendant's counsel to file a declaration and any necessary exhibits concerning Defendant's corporate status. The judge has also ordered that Plaintiff's motion to strike the demurrer be advanced to January 4, 2024, and that an Order to Show Cause be issued why the case should not be stayed pending completion of the parties' arbitration. Additionally, the judge has noticed its own motion for reclassification of the case, which may result in the case being transferred to the Unlawful Detainer Hub for trial solely on the issue of possession.
