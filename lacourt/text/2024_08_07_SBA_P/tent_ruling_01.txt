Plaintiff alleges the vehicle suffered from various defects and nonconformities that revealed themselves within the applicable express warranty period. Plaintiff alleges Defendant was obligated under the Song Beverly Act to promptly offer to repurchase or replace the vehicle after a reasonable number of unsuccessful repair attempts. Plaintiff alleges Defendant failed to do so.On September 28, 2023, Plaintiff Jazmin Gray (“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint against Defendant American Honda Motor Co., Inc., (“Defendant”) and DOES 1 through 10, inclusive, alleging three causes of action for: 1) Violation of the Song-Beverly Act – Breach of Express Warranty, 2) Violation of the Song-Beverly Act – Breach of the Implied Warranty, and (3) Violation of the Song-Beverly Act § 1793.2.alleging three causes of action for: 1) Violation of the Song-Beverly Act – Breach of Express Warranty, 2) Violation of the Song-Beverly Act – Breach of the Implied Warranty, and (3) Violation of the Song-Beverly Act § 1793.2.On July 17, 2024, Plaintiff filed an opposition concurrently with the Declaration of Chris Grigoryan. (“Grigoryan Decl.”)On July 31, 2024, Defendant filed a reply.REQUEST FOR JUDICIAL NOTICETaking judicial notice of a document is not the same as accepting the truth of its contents or accepting a particular interpretation of its meaning. (Fremont Indem. Co. v. Fremont General Corp. (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97, 113-14.) That means that “when judicial notice is taken of a document…the truthfulness and proper interpretation of the document are disputable.” (Aquila, Inc. v. Sup. Ct. (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 556, 569.)Defendant requests judicial notice of Plaintiff Jazmin Gray’s Complaint, filed on or about September 28, 2023, as attached as Exhibit 1 to the Ameripour Decl. (Request for Judicial Notice, p. 1; Ameripour Decl., ¶ 2, Exh. 1; Evidence Code §452(d).)Defendant’s request is GRANTED.LEGAL AUTHORITYUnder California and federal law, public policy favors arbitration as an efficient and less expensive means of resolving private disputes. (Moncharsh v. Heily & Blasé (1992) 3 Cal.4th 1, 8-9; AT&T Mobility LLC v. Concepcion (2011) 563 U.S. 333, 339.) Accordingly, whether an agreement is governed by the California Arbitration Act or the Federal Arbitration Act, courts resolve doubt about an arbitration agreement’s scope in favor of arbitration. (Moncharsh, supra, 3 Cal.4th at p. 9; Comedy Club, Inc. v. Improv West Associates (9th Cir. 2009) 553 F.3d 1277, 1284; see also Engalla v. Permanente Med. Grp., Inc. (1997) 15 Cal.4th 951, 971-72 (“California law incorporates many of the basic policy objectives contained in the Federal Arbitration Act, including a presumption in favor of arbitrability [citation] and a requirement that an arbitration agreement must be enforced on the basis of state law standards that apply to contracts in general.”).) “[U]nder both the FAA and California law, ‘arbitration agreements are valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.’” (Higgins v. Superior Court (2006) 140 Cal.App.4th 1238, 1247.)The party seeking to compel arbitration bears the burden of proving the existence of a valid arbitration agreement by the preponderance of the evidence. (Engalla, supra, 15 Cal.4th 951, 972.) A petition to compel arbitration must allege both a “written agreement to arbitrate” the controversy, and that a party to that agreement “refuses to arbitrate” the controversy. (Code Civ. Proc. § 1281.2.) It then becomes plaintiff’s burden, in opposing the motion, to prove by a preponderance of the evidence any fact necessary to her opposition. (Id..)“Code of Civil Procedure section 1281.2 requires a trial court to grant a petition to compel arbitration ‘if the court determines that an agreement to arbitrate the controversy exists.’” (Avery v. Integrated Healthcare Holdings, Inc. (2013) 218 Cal.App.4th 50, 59 (Avery), quoting Code Civ. Proc. § 1281.2).) Accordingly, “when presented with a petition to compel arbitration, the court’s first task is to determine whether the parties have in fact agreed to arbitrate the dispute.” (Id., at p. 59.)Generally, on a petition to compel arbitration, the court must grant the petition unless it finds either (1) no written agreement to arbitrate exists; (2) the right to compel arbitration has been waived; (3) grounds exist for revocation of the agreement; or (4) litigation is pending that may render the arbitration unnecessary or create conflicting rulings on common issues. (Id.; see also Condee v. Longwood Management Corp. (2001) 88 Cal.App.4th 215, 218-219.) “In these summary proceedings the trial court sits as a trier of fact, weighing all the affidavits, declarations, and other documentary evidence, as well as oral testimony received at the court’s discretion, to reach a final determination.” (Avery, supra, 218 Cal.App.4th at p. 59; accord Rosenthal v. Great Western Financial Securities Corp. (1996) 14 Cal.4th 394, 413.)DISCUSSION1. Applicable Arbitration Agreement ExistsDefendant Honda relies on the arbitration agreement contained in the Lease Agreement entered into between Plaintiff and non-party Carson Honda. (Ameripour Dec., Ex. 2, Closed End Lease (the “Lease Agreement”).) The Lease Agreement contains an arbitration provision, which states as follows: “YOU and HONDA agree and acknowledge that this Lease affects interstate commerce and the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) applies. By signing the Arbitration Consent, YOU [plaintiff] elect to have disputes resolved by arbitration. YOU, HONDA, or any involved third party may pursue a Claim. “Claim” means any dispute between YOU, HONDA, or any involved third party relating to your account, this Lease or our relationship, including any application, the Vehicle, its performance and any representations, omissions or warranties.” (Id. at p. 6, ¶52.)Based on its express language, the arbitration agreement applies to Plaintiff’s claims against Honda. Honda is an expressly named as a beneficiary of the arbitration agreement. “HONDA” is defined under the Lease Agreement to include “American Honda Motor Co., Inc. (Ameripour Dec., Ex. 2, p. 6, ¶52.)The arbitration agreement applies to any dispute between Plaintiff and Honda “relating to” “the Vehicle, its Performance and any…warranties.” (Id.) Plaintiff’s complaint is based on alleged defects in the Vehicle and its performance and breach of express and implied warranties. (Complaint, ¶¶10-14.)2. Honda is a Third Party Beneficiary to the Arbitration AgreementDefendant is not a signatory to the Lease Agreement. However, Defendant establishes that it is a third-party beneficiary thereof.“A contract, made expressly for the benefit of a third person, may be enforced by him at any time before the parties thereto rescind it.” (Civil Code §1559.) “In some cases, a nonsignatory was required to arbitrate a claim because a benefit was conferred on the nonsignatory as a result of the contract, making the nonsignatory a third party beneficiary of the arbitration agreement.” (County of Contra Costa v. Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, Inc. (1996) 47 Cal.App.4th 237, 242.)Third parties do not become “third party beneficiaries” just because a contract benefits them. A contract must be “made expressly” for the third party's benefit. The test is “whether an intent to benefit a third person appears from the terms of the contract.” (Jensen v. U-Haul Co. of California (2017) 18 Cal.App.5th 295, 301-302; Pillar Project AG v. Payward Ventures, Inc. (2021) 64 Cal.App.5th 671, 279 Cal.Rptr.3d 117, 120, 123 (plaintiff was not third-party beneficiary to arbitration agreement between “cryptocurrency exchange” platform and intermediary plaintiff hired to convert his cryptocurrency into conventional currency).A person “only incidentally or remotely benefitted” from a contract is not a third-party beneficiary. (Lucas v. Hamm (1961) 56 Cal.2d 583, 590.) Nor does knowledge that the third party may benefit from the contract suffice. (Goonewardene v. ADP, LLC (2019) 6 Cal.5th 817, 830.) To show the contracting parties intended to benefit it, a third party must show that, under the express terms of the contract at issue and any other relevant circumstances under which the contract was made, (1) “the third party would in fact benefit from the contract”; (2) “a motivating purpose of the contracting parties was to provide a benefit to the third party”; and (3) permitting the third party to enforce the contract “is consistent with the objectives of the contract and the reasonable expectations of the contracting parties.” (Goonewardene, supra, 6 Cal.5th at p. 830.)Plaintiff urges the court to follow the recent case of Martha Ochoa v. Ford Motor Company (2023) 89 Cal.App.5th 1324 ( “Ochoa”), which held that a manufacturer could not compel a purchaser of a vehicle to arbitrate claims against the manufacturer through the doctrine of equitable estoppel or as a third-party beneficiary. (Id.) In so doing, Plaintiff argues that Honda is not a named party within the agreement. This assertion is factually incorrect. Defendant is expressly named in the arbitration agreement as a beneficiary of its provisions and the provisions of the warranty agreement under which Plaintiff brings suit. Defendant clearly would benefit from the arbitration agreement as an expressly named party. The fact that Carson Honda and Plaintiff included Defendant as named beneficiary is evidence that they intended to benefit Defendant. Allowing Defendant to enforce the arbitration agreement is consistent with the parties’ reasonable expectations given that they expressly named it as a party.CONCLUSIONHaving concluded that Defendant may compel arbitration as a named third party beneficiary of the contract, the court declines to address whether arbitration may be compelled under the doctrine of collateral estoppel.Defendant’s motion to compel Arbitration is GRANTED this action is STAYED.
