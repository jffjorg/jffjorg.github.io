BACKGROUND
 
Plaintiffs filed this Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act
(“SBA”) lawsuit over alleged defects in their 2022 Alfa Romeo, VIN:
ZASPAKBN2N7D29028 (the “Subject Vehicle”), which was manufactured by Defendant FCA.
Plaintiffs allege that they purchased the Subject Vehicle on December 21, 2021,
entering into a warranty contract with FCA. (Compl. ¶¶ 5, 12, 15.)
 
On April 11, 2023, Plaintiffs filed their Complaint against
Defendants FCA, Glendale Dodge, LLC (“Glendale Dodge”), and Does 1 – 10,
alleging the following causes of action: (1) Violation of SBA – Breach of Express
Warranty, (2) Violation of SBA – Breach of Implied Warranty, and (3) Negligent Repair.
Subsequently, FCA and Glendale Dodge filed their respective Answers to the
Complaint on May 18, 2023, and April 22, 2024, respectively.
 
On April 8, 2024, Plaintiffs filed the instant Motion to
Compel Further Responses from FCA to Plaintiffs’ Special Interrogatories (“SROG”),
Nos. 45-48, Set One (the “Motion”).
 
On June 11, 2024, FCA filed its Opposition. Subsequently,
Plaintiffs replied on June 21, 2024.
 
ANALYSIS
 
“On receipt of a response to
interrogatories, the propounding party may move for an order compelling a
further response if the propounding party deems that any of the following
apply:(1) An answer to a particular interrogatory is evasive or incomplete. (2)
An exercise of the option to produce documents under Section 2030.230 is
unwarranted or the required specification of those documents is inadequate. (3)
An objection to an interrogatory is without merit or too general.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (a).)
 
A.   
Procedural
Requirements 
 
1.     
Timeliness
 
Pursuant to
Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.300, subdivision (c), notice of this
motion must be given within 45 days following the service of the verified
response, or any supplemental verified response, or by a later date agreed-upon
in writing, failing which the propounding party waives any right to compel a
further response to the interrogatories. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd.
(c); but see Golf & Tennis Pro Shop, Inc. v. Superior Court
(2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 127, 134-136 [suggesting that the 45-day deadline does
not apply to (i.e., it does not begin to run with service of) objections-only
responses; it only applies to responses that are required to be verified].)
 
The 45-day deadline “is ‘jurisdictional’
in the sense that it renders the court without authority to rule on motions to
compel other than to deny them.” (Sexton v. Superior Court (1997) 58
Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410.)
            
Here, FCA served unverified responses
to Plaintiffs' first set of SROG on January 9, 2024, with FCA’s electronic verifications
following on February 21, 2024. (Mot. at p. 2, Lopez Decl. ¶ 4.) The service of
verification establishes the deadline for Plaintiffs to file a motion to compel
further as April 10, 2024, calculated based on a 45-day period with an
extension of two court days per Code of Civil Procedure section 1010.6,
subdivision (a)(3), accounting for the method of electronic service.
 
Therefore, the Court finds the Motion is filed timely as it
was filed prior to the established deadline.
 
2.      Meet
and Confer 
 
“A motion
under subdivision (a) shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration
under Section 2016.040.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (b)(1).) “A meet and confer declaration in
support of a motion shall state facts showing a reasonable and good faith
attempt at an informal resolution of each issue presented by the motion.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2016.040.)
 
Here, the Court finds Plaintiffs’ meet and confer efforts
were sufficient. (Lopez Decl. ¶¶ 5-7, Ex. “C.”) 
 
3.      Separate
Statement
 
The California Rules of Court rule
3.1345 (a)(2) explicitly states that “Any motion involving the content of a
discovery request or the responses to such a request must be accompanied by a
separate statement. The motions that require a separate statement include a
motion: ... (2) To compel further responses to interrogatories.” “A separate statement is a separate document filed and
served with the discovery motion that provides all the information necessary to
understand each discovery request and all the responses to it that are at
issue.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(c).)
 
Here, Plaintiffs have fulfilled the
requirement by concurrently filing a separate statement with the Motion.
 
B.    
Motion to
Compel Further Responses to SROG Nos. 45-48
 
Plaintiffs move to compel FCA to
provide supplemental responses to SROG, Nos. 45-48.
 
SROG
No. 45 seeks, “At the time of release for the 2022 Alfa Romeo Stelvio Ti AWD
vehicles, state your anticipated range for repairs per thousand vehicles sold
(R/1000)..”
 
SROG
No. 46 requests, “State the repairs per thousand vehicles sold (R/1000) for
2022 Alfa Romeo Stelvio Ti AWD vehicles.”
 
SROG
No. 47 asks, “Identify in order the five symptoms with the highest repairs per
thousand (R/1000) for 2022 Alfa Romeo Stelvio Ti AWD vehicles, and the
corresponding repairs per thousand.”
 
SORG
No. 48 request, “Identify in order the five components with the highest repairs
per thousand (R/1000) for 2022 Alfa Romeo Stelvio Ti AWD vehicles, and the
corresponding repairs per thousand.” 
“As a general matter, the
statutory scheme imposes no obligation on a party propounding interrogatories
to establish good cause or prove up the merits of any underlying claims.” (Williams
v. Superior Court (2017) 3 Cal.5th 531, 550.) Indeed, a litigant “is
entitled to demand answers to its interrogatories, as a matter of right, and
without a prior showing, unless the party on whom those interrogatories are
served objects and shows cause why the questions are not within the purview of
the code section.” (Id. at p. 541, citing West Pico Furniture Co. v.
Superior Court (1961) 56 Cal.2d 407, 422.)
Accordingly, the Court
will proceed to examine whether FCA’s objections have satisfied its burden to
show cause, when considered in light of the arguments presented by Plaintiffs.
1)     
FAC’s
Objections to SROG Nos. 45 - 48
 
FCA objects to the above-listed
SROG Nos. 45 - 48 on the basis of irrelevance, stating that “this interrogatory
seeks information that is not relevant to the subject matter of this litigation
and is therefore not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of
admissible evidence.” (See generally Tudzin Decl. Ex. “A.”) FCA further objects
on the grounds of overbreadth, arguing that the interrogatories at issue are
“not limited to any claim of defect or nonconformity in this case.” (Ibid.)
 
Plaintiffs argue that the
interrogatories at issue are relevant because they could demonstrate that “FCA had knowledge about a widespread
defect or nonconformity and failed to act despite this knowledge.” (Mot. at p.
5.) Plaintiffs maintain that these
interrogatories are reasonably calculated to lead to discovery of admissible
evidence. (Mot. at p. 5.) To support their argument, Plaintiffs assert that
“the use of ‘other vehicle’ evidence at trial ‘certainly was probative and not
prejudicial,’” citing Donlen v. Ford Motor Co. (2013) 217 Cal.App.4th
138, 154 (Donlen). 
 
Established case law supports that
the relevance of a manufacturer’s knowledge
and inaction should be directly connected to the defects as specifically
alleged in the case. In
Jensen v. BMW of North America, LLC (S.D. Cal. 2019) 328 F.R.D. 557 (Jensen),
the federal district judge in San Diego ordered a defendant to search specific
databases for other customers’ complaints, but limited the scope to “vehicles
of the same year, make, and model as Plaintiff's subject vehicle and limited to
only those records reporting problems with the same defect codes listed in
any repair records pertaining to Plaintiff's vehicle and part numbers under
warranty in Plaintiff's vehicle, and to produce those documents.” (Jensen,
supra, at p. 564.) The Jensen court reasoned that “information regarding whether the same defects were
reported to BMW in other cars of the same make, model, and year as Plaintiff’s
subject vehicle could conceivably be relevant to whether BMW acted reasonably
in denying Plaintiff’s warranty claim. A fact finder may find BMW’s knowledge
or lack of knowledge about the same defects to be a consideration in deciding
whether BMW acted in good faith as to Plaintiff’s specific case.” (Id.
at pp. 562-563.) (Underlines added.)
 
Additionally, upon careful
review of the Donlen ruling, the Court finds that Plaintiffs’ SROG Nos.
45 - 48 exceed the scope of the evidence upheld by the Donlen court. Donlen held that the trial court had
not erred in denying Ford’s motion in limine to exclude evidence of other
customers’ complaints about the same transmission model Ford installed in
plaintiff's truck and other vehicles. (Donlen, supra, 217
Cal.App.4th at p. 154.) (Underlines added.) However, this is not what SROG Nos.
45-48 actually seek. These interrogatories ask
to “identify in order the five symptoms,” and “identify in order the five
components,” “with the highest repairs per thousand for 2022 Alfa Romeo Stelvio
Ti AWD vehicles.” (SROG Nos. 46 - 48.) These interrogatories broadly seek data
without narrowing the scope to the same or similar nature of reported defects
by Plaintiff. 
 
Similarly,
the SROG No. 45 requests information of “[FCA’s] anticipated range for repairs
per thousand vehicle sold,” which involves the
constellation of any possible repairs. Those repairs are also not limited to
California, but in any other states.
 
Accordingly,
in alignment with established precedents, including those set in Dolen
and Jensen, the Court concludes that information sought by Plaintiffs’
SROG, Nos. 45-48, is irrelevant and overbroad, thereby sustaining FCA’s
objection on these grounds.
 
Furthermore, FCA’s counsel attests that on June 7,
2024, FCA caused to be served supplemental responses to the interrogatories addressed
in the Motion. (Tudzin Decl. ¶ 3.) These supplemental responses state, “FCA
states that it does not track R/1000 data. To the extent Plaintiffs seeks
failure rate data, FCA US will conduct a
diligent search and reasonably inquiry and produce, subject to protective
order, all responsive documents found related to warranty claims and failure
rates data (c/1000 and MOP/MIS), for the same make, year, and model of the
Subject Vehicle.” 
 
Given the Court has
previously sustained FCA’s objection on the grounds of relevance and
overbreadth – as the interrogatories at issue are not limited to any claim of defect or nonconformity in this
case – the Court determines that FCA’s
supplemental responses are sufficient.
 
Based on the above, the Court DENIES the Motion.
 
C.   
Monetary
Sanctions
 
As the Court has denied the Motion, the request for
monetary sanctions, reserved for a prevailing party under Code of Civil
Procedure section 2030.300, subdivision (d), is also DENIED. 
 
CONCLUSION
 
Plaintiffs’
Motion to Compel Further Responses to Special Interrogatories, Nos. 45-48, Set
One, is DENIED.
 
Plaintiffs’
Request for Monetary Sanctions is DENIED.

party to give notice.
