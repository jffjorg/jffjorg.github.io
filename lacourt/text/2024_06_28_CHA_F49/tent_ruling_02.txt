BACKGROUND
 
On October 9, 2023, Plaintiff Lucine Martirosian
(“Plaintiff”) initiated this action against Defendant Karine Smbatian
(“Defendant”), and Does 1 to 20, alleging (1) Personal Injury, and (2) Premise
Liability. Subsequently, Defendant filed her Answer to the Complaint on December
12, 2023. 
 
On March 6, 2024, Defendant’s Counsel filed the instant
Motion to be Relieved as Counsel (the “Motion”).
 
            No Opposition papers have been
received by the Court.
 
ANALYSIS
The court may
order that an attorney be changed or substituted at any time before or after
judgment or final determination upon request by either client or attorney and
after notice from one to the other. (Code Civ. Proc. § 284, subd. (2).) “The
determination whether to grant or deny a motion to withdraw as counsel lies
within the sound discretion of the trial court.” (Manfredi & Levine v. Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128,
1133.) An application to be relieved as counsel must be made on Judicial Council
Forms MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion), MC-052 (Declaration), and MC-053
(Proposed Order). (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, subds. (a), (c), (e).)
            In
addition, California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, subsection (d) requires that
the notice of motion and motion, declaration, and proposed order be served on
the client and all other parties who have appeared in the case by personal
service, electronic service, or mail. If the notice is served by mail, it must
be accompanied by a declaration stating facts showing that either:
            (A) The service address is the current residence or
business address of the client; or
(B)
The service address is the last known residence or business address of the
client and the attorney has been unable to locate a more current address after
making reasonable efforts to do so within 30 days before the filing of the
motion to be relieved.
 
            (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1362, subd. (1)(A) & (2).)
 
Here, Counsel has filed Judicial Council Forms MC-051 and
MC-052. However, Counsel has not lodged Judicial Council Form MC-053 with the
Court, failing to meet the requirement under California Rules of Court, rule
3.1362, subdivision (e).
 
Counsel has provided a declaration stating that the Motion
is necessitated by “a complete breakdown in communication rendering it
impossible for counsel to carry our representation.” (MC-052, ¶ 2.)
Additionally, Counsel claims that “withdrawal of counsel can be accomplished
without material adverse effects on the interest of the client.” (Ibid.)

 
The Court finds Counsel’s reasons for seeking relief to be satisfactory.
Counsel states in his declaration that the Motion was served by USPS First
Class mail at Defendant’s last known address. (MC-052, ¶ 3(a)(2).) Moreover,
Counsel has confirmed within the past 30 days that this address is current by
mail, return receipt requested and by other means including contacting
Defendant’s personal email. (Id., ¶ 3(b)(2)(c).)
 
The next hearing scheduled for this action is a Case
Management Conference set for July 16, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. in Department F49 at
9425 Penfield Ave., Chatsworth, CA 91311. A trial is not yet set. (MC-052, ¶¶
5-6.)
 
Based on the foregoing, the Court CONTINUES the Motion to
be Relieved as Counsel to allow additional time for Counsel to properly file
the mandatory Judicial Council Form MC-053 and Proof of Service.
 
CONCLUSION
 
Defendant Karine
Smbatian’s Counsel Lisa N. Shyer’s Motion
to be Relieved as Counsel is CONTINUED.
 
Moving counsel to give notice.
