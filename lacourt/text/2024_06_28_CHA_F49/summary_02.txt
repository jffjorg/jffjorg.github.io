And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled to continue the motion filed by Counsel for Defendant Karine Smbatian to be relieved as counsel. The motion was filed on March 6, 2024, and Counsel has provided a declaration stating that the breakdown in communication between Counsel and Defendant renders it impossible for Counsel to continue representing Defendant. However, Counsel failed to lodge the mandatory Judicial Council Form MC-053 with the Court, which is required by California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, subdivision (e). The judge has given Counsel additional time to properly file the form and proof of service. The motion is continued to a future hearing.
