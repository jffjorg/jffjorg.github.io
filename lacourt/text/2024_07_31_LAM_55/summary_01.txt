Summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer hearing for a lawsuit filed by LEO GONZALEZ and others (Plaintiffs) against INGENIOUS ASSET GROUP, INC. (Ingenious). The Plaintiffs demurred to Ingenious' Second Amended Cross-Complaint (SAXC), which alleges causes of action for negligence, equitable indemnity, apportionment and contribution, and declaratory relief. The judge sustained the demurrer in its entirety, without leave to amend, finding that Ingenious failed to state a claim. The judge also found that Ingenious has no relationship with the Plaintiffs and therefore there is no current or probable future controversy to be resolved by declaratory relief.
