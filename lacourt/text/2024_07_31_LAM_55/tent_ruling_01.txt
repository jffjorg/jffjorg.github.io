  Case Number:  22STCV23653    Hearing Date:   July 31, 2024    Dept:  55 NATURE OF PROCEEDINGS:
Hearing on Demurrer – without Motion to Strike
BACKGROUND
LEO GONZALEZ et al. (“Plaintiffs”) brought this
lawsuit based on allegations that Plaintiffs are tenants at 625 S. Burlington
Ave., Los Angeles, which has uninhabitable conditions, including cockroach
infestations, widespread mold contamination, open exposure to raw sewage,
plumbing issues, faulty and insufficient utilities, structural defects, and
deficient security.  
The FAC asserts twelve (12) causes of action arising
from Plaintiffs’ residential tenancies in the property located at 625 S.
Burlington Ave., Los Angeles (“the Property”). Plaintiffs allege Defendants,
owners and/or managers of the Property, permitted grossly uninhabitable
conditions to persist at the Property throughout their tenancies.
Cross-Defendant/Cross-Complainant INGENIOUS ASSET
GROUP, INC. (“Ingenious”), the property management company that formerly
managed the Property at issue, filed a Second Amended Cross-Complaint (“SAXC”),
alleging causes of action for (1) negligence, (2) express indemnity,
(3) equitable/implied indemnity, (4) apportionment and contribution, and
(5) declaratory relief.
On May 14, 2024, all the plaintiffs/cross-defendants
except Gloria Escobar demurred to Ingenious’s SAXC. (The Court refers to the
demurring parties as “Plaintiffs” collectively, notwithstanding Escobar’s
absence from the demurrer.)
Ingenious opposes the demurrer.
LEGAL STANDARD
Where pleadings are defective, a party may raise the
defect by way of a demurrer. (Coyne v. Krempels (1950) 36 Cal.2d 257,
262.) Code of Civil Procedure section 430.10 enumerates eight (8) statutory
grounds for demurrer, among them a pleading’s failure to state facts sufficient
to constitute a cause of action. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10(d); Young v.
Gannon (2002) 97 Cal.App.4th 209, 220.) 
When considering a demurrer, a court reads the
allegations stated in the challenged pleading liberally and in context, and
“treat[s] the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded, but
not contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law.” (Serrano v.
Priest (1971) 5 Cal.3d 584, 591.) “The only issue involved in a demurrer hearing is
whether the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous matters,
states a cause of action.” (Hahn v. Mirda (2007)
147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) 
Put differently: for purposes of demurrer, the court
treats all facts alleged – but only the facts alleged – in the complaint
as true. (Picton v. Anderson Union High School District (1996) 50
Cal.App.4th 726, 732.)
MEETING AND CONFERENCE
“Before filing a demurrer
... , the demurring party shall meet and confer in person or by telephone with
the party who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the purpose of
determining whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve the
objections to be raised in the demurrer.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41(a).)
Counsel attests that
section 430.41 is satisfied. (Barajas Decl., ¶ 2.) Counsel is not strictly
correct; he states the parties met and conferred “by letter”, rather than by
telephone or in person. (Ibid.) Nonetheless, the Code is satisfied in
spirit, and the Court turns to the merits of the demurrer.
ANALYSIS
Plaintiffs demur to Ingenious’s first cause of action
for negligence, its third cause of action for equitable/implied indemnity, its
fourth cause of action for apportionment and contribution, and its fifth cause
of action for declaratory relief, all for failure to state a claim as described
in Code of Civil Procedure section 430.10(e).
            1.
First Cause of Action for Negligence
“To succeed in a negligence action, the plaintiff must
show that (1) the defendant owed the plaintiff a legal duty, (2) the defendant
breached the duty, and (3) the breach proximately or legally caused (4) the
plaintiff's damages or injuries. (Thomas v. Stenberg (2012) 206
Cal.App.4th 654, 662.) Plaintiffs argue Ingenious has not pled that Plaintiffs
owe it any duty. The Court agrees. 
Ingenious argues Plaintiffs owe their landlords a duty
not to damage their rental property, and Ingenious, as their landlord’s agent,
is owed the same duty. Ingenious relies on the definition of “landlord” that
appears in section 151.02 of the Los Angeles Municipal Code. Ingenious cites no
other precedent for its proposition that a “landlord”, as defined in a local
ordinance, should be equated with the term owner/lessor, as defined at common
law. The Court fails to see how Plaintiffs owe Ingenious a duty not to damage
property Ingenious does not own. And a definition of “landlord” lifted from a
municipal rent stabilization ordinance does not explain why Plaintiffs would
owe a management company such a duty. 
Ingenious contends “agents of lessors are included
with the definition of ‘lessor’ by the jurisdiction in which the subject
property and tenants are located.” (Opp., 6:4-5.) Not so. An agent of the
lessor is included in the definition of the term landlord, not the term lessor.
The LARSO sets out many rights and obligations as between landlords and tenants.
It does not adjust the common-law duties a lessee owes to a lessor – or at
least, Ingenious has not shown that it does simply by quoting the LARSO.
The demurrer to Ingenious’s first cause of action is
sustained. Ingenious concedes it is only the agent for the owner of the
Property. It has not alleged Plaintiffs owe it the duty it claims. This is the
second time Plaintiffs have demurred to this claim asserted by Ingenious, and
the second time Ingenious has failed to establish any legal basis for asserting
a negligence claim against Plaintiffs. The demurrer therefore is sustained without
leave to amend.
2. Third and Fourth Causes
of Action for Equitable/Implied Indemnity and Apportionment/Contribution
“ ‘The right to indemnity flows from payment of a
joint legal obligation on another's behalf. [Citations.] The elements of a
cause of action for indemnity are (1) a showing of fault on the part of the
indemnitor and (2) resulting damages to the indemnitee for which the indemnitor
is contractually or equitably responsible.’ (Expressions at Rancho Niguel
Ass'n v. Ahmanson Developments, Inc. (2001) 86 Cal.App.4th 1135, 1139 … .)
Particularly given that Ingenious has not stated a
claim for negligence, it also has not alleged facts showing Plaintiffs, its
purported indemnitors, are jointly at fault for any damages to Ingenious.
As for contribution: the
proper mechanism to allocate liability between alleged joint tortfeasors in an
underlying suit is through a claim for equitable indemnity. Contribution
contemplates liability as between multiple tortfeasors liable on the same judgment.
Matters of fault as between plaintiffs and defendant presumptively will be
settled through findings of comparative negligence and/or indemnity in the main
suit. (See generally American Motorcycle Assn. v. Superior Court (1978)
20 Cal.3d 578 [discussing the purpose and distinctions between contribution and
indemnity theories].)
Because the facts underlying Ingenious’s indemnity
claim are unclear, it is also unclear what distinguishes its claims for
indemnity and contribution. Both fail.
The Court sustains Plaintiffs’ demurrer to IAG’s third
and fourth causes of action without leave to amend.
            3.
Fifth Cause of Action for Declaratory Relief
“To qualify for declaratory relief under section 1060,
[a party must show] their action … present[s] two essential elements: ‘(1) a
proper subject of declaratory relief, and (2) an actual controversy involving
justiciable questions relating to the rights or obligations of a party.’
[Citation.] ‘The “actual controversy” language in ... section 1060 encompasses
a probable future controversy relating to the legal rights and duties of the
parties.’ [Citation.] It does not embrace controversies that are ‘conjectural,
anticipated to occur in the future, or an attempt to obtain an advisory opinion
from the court.’ [Citation.]” (Lee v. Silveira (2016) 6 Cal.App.5th 527, 546.) 
Ingenious concedes it no longer manages the Property;
it has no relationship with Plaintiffs, contractual or otherwise. There is no current
or probable future controversy. Ingenious contends there is a “need for a
determination as to the rights and duties of the parties ... during the time
that Ingenious was acting as the lessor’s agent”. (Opp., 7:1-2.) The other
causes of action will dispose of those questions. There are no ongoing rights
and duties to clarify by declaration.
The demurrer to the fifth cause of action for
declaratory relief is sustained without leave to amend.
CONCLUSION
The demurrer is sustained in its entirety, without
leave to amend.
