And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants Juan and Samantha's motion for leave to file a First Amended Cross-Complaint (FACC) to add a cause of action against Firestone for violating the Resolution. Firestone had opposed the motion, arguing that it would be prejudiced and that Juan and Samantha unreasonably delayed in seeking leave to amend. The judge disagrees, finding that Juan and Samantha filed the motion promptly after completing Martinez's deposition, which shed light on the viability of a claim by Juan against Firestone for violating the Resolution. The judge notes that the Resolution's protections for tenants were put in place as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and that it is unclear whether and to what extent the Resolution's protections apply in Juan's favor. Given this uncertainty, the judge grants Juan and Samantha leave to pursue the claim.
