  Case Number:  24PSCV00398    Hearing Date:   August 13, 2024    Dept:  H Plaintiff Wright Walnut Owner,  LLC’s Motion to Strike Defendant Blackseries Campers, Inc.’s Answer and to  Enter Default and Default Judgment is GRANTED in part, in that the Court orders Blackseries Campers, Inc.’s answer stricken and its default entered. The Court sets an Order  to Show Cause Re: Default Judgment for October 14, 2024.Background    Plaintiff Wright Walnut Owner,  LLC (“Plaintiff”) alleges as follows: Plaintiff owns the building  located at 19501 East Walnut Drive South in the City of Industry (the  “premises”). On May 24, 2018, Plaintiff’s predecessor-in-interest, Jeunique  Industrial Park, LLC, as landlord, and Blackseries Campers, Inc.  (“Blackseries”), as tenant, entered into a written commercial lease agreement  (the “Lease”) for the premises for a term of 87 months (i.e., from November 1,  2018 to February 28, 2026). Hongwei Qiu (“Qiu”) executed and delivered a  written Guaranty of Lease on that date. The Lease was subsequently amended on  December 15, 2019 and June 2, 2020. Blackseries and Qiu have failed (1) to  maintain and repair the concrete on the premises, (2) to keep fire hydrants on  the premises clear from trailers and trash, and (3) to make the required rental  payments.  On February 7, 2024, Plaintiff filed a complaint, asserting causes of action  against Blackseries, Qui and Does 1-10 for (1) breach of written lease; (2)  temporary restraining order, preliminary and permanent injunction; (3)  declaratory relief; and (4) breach of written lease guaranty.Plaintiff has filed a motion for  an order striking Blackseries’ answer and entering default and default judgment  against Blackseries because Blackseries is not represented by counsel. The  hearing on Plaintiff’s motion is scheduled for August 13, 2023—the same date as  the Case Management Conference. Legal Standard “[A] corporation . . . cannot  represent itself before courts of record in propria persona, nor can it  represent itself through a corporate officer, director or other employee who is  not an attorney. It must be represented by licensed counsel in proceedings  before courts of record.” (CLD Construction, Inc. v. City of San Ramon (2004)  120 Cal.App.4th 1141, 1145; Paradise v. Nowlin (1948) 86 Cal.App.2d 897,  898 [“A corporation . . . is an artificial entity created by law and as such it  can neither practice law nor appear or act in person. . . A corporation cannot  appear in court by an officer who is not an attorney and it cannot appear in  propria persona”].) “The court may, upon a motion  made pursuant to Section 435, or at any time in its discretion, and upon terms  it deems proper . . . [s]trike out all or any part of any pleading not drawn or  filed in conformity with the laws of this state, a court rule, or an order of  the court.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 436). Discussion Plaintiff contends that  Blackseries’ answer should be stricken and that default should be entered  because Blackseries is not represented by counsel.  In support of Plaintiff’s motion, Plaintiff  has attached two exhibits—(1) a Certificate of Status from the California  Secretary of State dated June 13, 2024 that confirms Blackseries’ active  corporate status in California and (2) the Court’s June 5, 2024 order granting  Blackseries’ prior counsel’s motion to be relieved as counsel in this  case.  (Brown Decl., ¶¶ 2-3, Exhs. A-B.)  The Court takes judicial notice of both exhibits. Following the Court’s order  granting Blackseries’ attorney’s motion to be relieved as counsel, on June 7,  2024, Blackseries’ former counsel filed a “Proof of Service Re Order Granting  Motions to be Relieved s Counsel,” reflecting that Blackseries was served, via  mail and e-mail, with the Order on that date.As a corporation, Blackseries  cannot appear in court absent counsel.   (Brown Decl., ¶ 2, Exh. A; Paradise v. Nowlin (1948) 86 Cal.App.2d 897,  898.)  While Blackseries has had ample  time to procure substitute counsel, court records do not reflect that any  substitution of attorney for Blackseries has been filed as of this date.  Accordingly, Plaintiff’s motion is granted in  part, in that the Court orders that Blackseries’ answer be stricken and that  default be entered against Blackseries. The Court sets an Order to Show  Cause Re: Default Judgment for October 14, 2024, at 8:30 a.m., in Department H.  Plaintiff is directed to file a default judgment packet for the Court’s review  on or before that date.
