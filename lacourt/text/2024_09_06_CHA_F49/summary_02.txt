And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled on a demurrer filed by the defendant, Morrison Studios Ltd., L.P., to the complaint filed by the plaintiff, Young & Chris, Inc. dba Dragon Street. The plaintiff had alleged a breach of contract, breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and breach of quiet enjoyment - private nuisance.

The judge found that the defendant's demurrer was sustained with leave to amend. The judge ruled that the plaintiff's allegations failed to state a cause of action for breach of contract because the responsibility to repair the holes in the ceiling fell on the lessee, as stated in the lease agreement.

The judge also ruled that the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing was not implicated in this case, as there was no actionable act or omission by the defendant that substantially interfered with the plaintiff's right to use and enjoy the premises.

The plaintiff is granted leave to amend the complaint and must serve and file a first amended complaint within 30 days of the order.
