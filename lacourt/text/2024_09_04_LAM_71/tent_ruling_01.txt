Douglas “Geordie” Schuurman’s, Robert Clark’s, and Left Field IP Holdings, LLC’s
motion to exclude all reports and testimony by Defendants Mehran Agazaryan aka

Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant Right Brothers
Management, LLC (“Right Brothers”) (“Plaintiff”), and Cross-Defendants Angus
Schuurman (“Angus”), Douglas “Geordie” Schuurman (“Geordie”), Robert Clark
(“Clark”), and Left Field IP Holdings, LLC (“Left Field IP”) (collectively, “Cross-Defendants”)
move to exclude all reports and testimony by Defendants Mehran Agazaryan aka
Mike Agazaryan’s (“Mike”), Ara Baljian aka Eric Baljian’s (“Eric”), and Davo
Agazaryan aka David Agazaryan’s (“David”) (collectively, “Defendants”), and
Defendant/Cross-Complainant BMI Group, Inc.’s (“BMI Group”)
(“Cross-Complainant”) expert, David Perkins (“Perkins”).  (Notice Motion, pg. 1; Evid. Code §§801, 802,
803, 352, 402; K.C. Multimedia, Inc. v. Bank of America Technology &
Operations, Inc. (2009) 171 Cal.App.4th 939.)
 
Request for Judicial Notice
Cross-Complainant and Defendants’ 8/19/24
request for judicial notice of (1) Declaration of Saul Reiss in Support of
Defendants’ Opposition to Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Adjudication; and (2)
Declaration of Ara Baljian in Support of Opposition by Defendants to
Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Adjudication is denied because this Court does
not need to take judicial notice of filings on the instant docket.
 
Background
Defendants retained Perkins to offer an expert
opinion on: (1) the total potential yield, total potential value, and the total
potential ratio of dry cannabis flower, dry small cannabis flowers, and dry
trim of cannabis crops grown outdoors and in hoop houses at 3333 Avena St.,
Lompoc, California (“Premises”); and (2) the amount of cannabis that the joint
venture actually transferred and or sold. (Decl. of Young ¶4, Exh. 1 at pg. 2.)
Cross-Defendants filed the instant motion on
June 14, 2024.  Defendants and
Cross-Complainant filed their opposition on August 19, 2024.  Cross-Defendants filed their reply on August
27, 2024.
 
Legal Standard
A motion in limine may be granted where a
witness’ opinion is based on assumptions unsupported by any evidence.  (Evid. Code §803 [“The court may, and upon
objection shall, exclude testimony in the form of an opinion that is based in
whole or in significant part on matter that is not a proper basis for such an
opinion.”].)  
“An expert’s opinion that something could be
true if certain assumed facts are true, without any foundation for concluding
those assumed facts exist in the case before the jury, does not provide
assistance to the jury because the jury is charged with determining what
occurred in the case before it, not hypothetical possibilities.”  (Jennings v. Palomar Pomerado Health Systems,
Inc. (2003) 114 Cal.App.4th 1108, 1117-1121 [upholding trial court’s
exclusion of expert testimony under Evidence Code §801 where the expert’s
conclusion was not supported by a reasoned explanation].)  
An expert can rely on representations made by
others.  (People v. Veamatahau
(2020) 9 Cal.5th 16, 33.)  Indeed, an
expert’s reliance on representations by others “does not mean the
trustworthiness of that information cannot be explored through examination.”  (Id.)
Under Evidence Code §802, “a court may inquire
into, not only the type of material on which an expert relies, but also whether
that material actually supports the expert’s reasoning” and conclude that the
expert’s opinion should be excluded.  (Sargon
Enterprises, Inc. v. University of Southern California (2012) 55 Cal.4th
747, 770-771; San Francisco Print Media Co. v. The Hearst Corp. (2020)
44 Cal.App.5th 952, 963 [stating trial court is authorized to exclude expert
opinions it determines lack a foundational basis].)
 
Discussion
Cross-Defendants’ motion does not challenge
Perkins’ qualifications, specialized knowledge, skill, experience, training, or
education as a cannabis expert. It is thus undisputed that Perkins is qualified
to testify as a cannabis expert, pursuant to Evidence Code §§801(b) and 802.
Evidence
Code §803 deals with exclusion of expert testimony that is based in whole or in
part on improper matter. Section 803 states:
The court may, and upon
objection shall, exclude testimony in the form of an opinion that is based in
whole or in part on matter that is not a proper basis for such an opinion. In
such case, the witness may, if there remains a proper basis for his opinion,
then state his opinion after excluding from consideration the matter determined
to be improper.
 
(Evid.
Code §803.)
Cross-Defendants
contend that Perkins has relied on improper matter consisting of unsupported
assumed facts lacking foundation, and that his opinions are based on mere
speculation and conjecture.  However, Perkins
relied on Plaintiff’s own evidence produced in support of their claims in this
matter.  (Decl. of Reiss ¶10, Exh. D at
pgs. 127:3-129:8.)
Based on Perkins’ deposition testimony, he
relied on Plaintiff’s information, specifically the information on page 3 of
their brochure, in rendering his opinions in this matter.  It is also clear from Bates Numbers
(RBM002179-RBM-002185) that Plaintiff produced that brochure.  Plaintiff thus represents the information as
being truthful and competent evidence.  “The
proper role of an expert is to help the jury understand the significance of
case-specific facts proven by competent evidence, not to place before the jury
otherwise unsubstantiated assertions of fact.”  (People v. Valencia (2021) 11 Cal.5th
818, 837.)
Here, Perkins was given matter containing
Plaintiff’s written representations on the cannabis production at the Property
during the period at issue before his deposition.  Because the information pertains to what the
cannabis expert is testifying to, it is of the type of matter that a cannabis
expert may reasonably rely upon in rendering his opinions on the cannabis at
the Property, including production, during that period at issue.  (Evid. Code §§801(b), 802.)
Further, Cross-Defendants’ motion does not
state that Plaintiff’s marketing brochure contains improper matter.  Given the existence of foundational
reliability, “the strength of an expert’s assumptions affects the weight rather
than the admissibility of the opinion.”  (Howard Entertainment, Inc. v. Kudrow
(2012) 208 Cal.App.4th 1102, 1121.)  For those reasons, Evidence Code §803 does
not apply. 
Cross-Defendants also have not shown that
Perkins’ opinion on actual production, which he is expected to opine on and is
based on Defendants’ cannabis sales spreadsheet Defendants gave him, would be
more prejudicial than probative.  (Decl.
of Reiss ¶10, Exh. D at pgs. 122:21-123:9, 130:19-131:1.)
Accordingly, Cross-Defendants’ motion is
denied.
 
Conclusion
Cross-Defendants’ motion to disqualify
Defendants’ and Cross-Complainants’ expert witness, Perkins, is denied. 
Moving Party to give notice.
