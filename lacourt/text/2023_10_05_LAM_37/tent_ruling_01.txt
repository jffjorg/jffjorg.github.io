Background
 
Shanah
Richardson (“Plaintiff”) entered into a written lease agreement with Roya
Gheytanchi (“Defendant Roya”) for 1610 S. Crest Drive (Guest House), Los
Angeles, CA 90035 (the “Property”).  She
moved into the Property, which Defendant Roya and Yousef Gheytanchi
(collectively “Defendants”) owned, on March 1, 2010.
 
On
June 5, 2023, Plaintiff filed a complaint against Defendants and Does 1 to 20,
alleging the following ten causes of action: (1) tenant harassment in violation
of Los Angeles Municipal Code §§ 45.33, 45.35; (2) negligent maintenance of
premises; (3) breach of covenant of quiet enjoyment (contract); (4) breach of
covenant of quiet enjoyment (tort); (5) tortious breach of warranty of
habitability (intentional tort); (6) breach of warranty of habitability (Civ.
Code §§ 1941.1); (7) unlawful entry in violation of Civ. Code § 1954; (8)
intentional infliction of emotional distress; (9) negligent infliction of
emotional distress; and (10) unlawful business practices in violation of Bus.
& Prof. Code, § 17200.
 
On
August 18, 2023, Defendants filed a motion to strike. Plaintiff filed opposing
papers on September 25, 2023. Defendants filed a reply on September 28, 2023. 
 
Discussion
 
I.         Legal Standard 
 
¿Any party, within the time allowed to respond to a pleading
may serve and file a notice of motion to strike the whole or any part thereof.
(CCP, § 435(b)(1); CRC, rule 3.1322(b).) The court may, upon a motion or at any
time in its discretion and upon terms it deems proper: (1) strike out any
irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading; or (2) strike
out all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the
laws of California, a court rule, or an order of the court. (CCP, § 436(a)-(b);
Stafford v. Shultz (1954) 42 Cal.2d 767, 782 [“Matter in a pleading
which is not essential to the claim is surplusage; probative facts are
surplusage and may be stricken out or disregarded”].)¿¿¿¿ 
 
“Where the defect raised by a motion to strike or by demurrer
is reasonably capable of cure, leave to amend is routinely and liberally
granted to give the plaintiff a chance to cure the defect in question.” (CLD
Construction, Inc. v. City of San Ramon (2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 1141, 1146.)
The burden is on the complainant to show the Court that a pleading can be
amended successfully. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.)¿¿¿ 
 
II.        Motion to Strike[1]
 
A.        Plaintiff’s
Untimely Opposition 
 
CCP
§ 1005(b) requires that opposing papers be served and filed at least nine court
days before the hearing. Plaintiff’s opposing papers were due on Thursday,
September 21, 2023, but Plaintiff did not serve her opposition until September
22, 2023, and did not file it until September 25, 2023. 
 
Although
Plaintiff’s motion is untimely, Defendants fail to state that they have been
prejudiced by the delay.  The court has
the discretion to consider Plaintiff’s untimely opposition. (CRC, rule 3.1300
[the court may entertain untimely opposition “in its discretion”]; see Tate
v. Superior Court (1975) 45 Cal.App.3d 925, 930 [The court may treat the
appearance of Defense counsel at the hearing and her opposition to the motion
on its merits as a waiver of defective notice of the motion.].) Therefore, the
court considers the Plaintiff’s untimely opposition. 
 
            B.        Defendants’
Motion to Strike 
 
Defendant
moves to strike the following from Plaintiff’s Complaint: 
 
1)     Paragraph
1, line 14 relating to punitive damages;
2)     Paragraph
45 in its entirety and as to any cause of action that incorporates this
paragraph by reference;
3)     Paragraph
52 in its entirety and as to any cause of action that incorporates this
paragraph by reference;
4)     Paragraph
61 in its entirety and as to any cause of action that incorporates this
paragraph by reference;
5)     Paragraph
78 in its entirety and as to any cause of action that incorporates this
paragraph by reference;
6)     Paragraph
98 in its entirety and as to any cause of action that incorporates this
paragraph by reference;
7)     The
prayer for exemplary and punitive damages at paragraph 1(b);
8)     The
prayer for exemplary and punitive damages at paragraph 2(b); and
9)     The
prayer for exemplary and punitive damages at paragraphs 4(b)-8(b).
 
Upon
motion, the court shall strike an allegation of punitive damages unless the
ultimate facts showing an entitlement of such relief have been pled by a
plaintiff. (Clauson v. Superior Court (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 1253, 1255.)
To survive a motion to strike, claims for punitive damages must provide facts
showing the defendant acted maliciously, with the intention or willful and
conscious disregard of her likelihood to cause harm. (Hillard v. A.H. Robins
Co. (1983) 148 Cal.App.3d 374, 391-392.)     To
state a claim for punitive damages under Civil Code section 3294, a plaintiff
must allege specific facts showing that the defendant has been guilty of
malice, oppression, or fraud. (Smith v. Superior Court (1992) 10 Cal.
App. 4th 1033, 1042.)¿ The basis for punitive damages must be pled with
specificity; conclusory allegations devoid of any factual assertions are
insufficient. (Id.)
 
Although
at the pleading stage a plaintiff is not required to prove their allegations,
the plaintiff must nevertheless state facts that show that the “defendant has
been guilty of oppression, fraud, or malice[.]” (Civ. Code, § 3294.) Civ. Code
§ 3294(c) provides the following definitions: 
 
(1)¿“Malice” means
conduct which is intended by the defendant to cause injury to the plaintiff or
despicable conduct which is carried on by the defendant with a willful and
conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.¿¿ 
¿ 
(2)¿“Oppression”
means despicable conduct that subjects a person to cruel and unjust hardship in
conscious disregard of that person’s rights.¿¿ 
¿ 
(3)¿“Fraud” means an
intentional misrepresentation, deceit, or concealment of a material fact known
to the defendant with the intention on the part of the defendant of thereby
depriving a person of property or legal rights or otherwise causing injury.¿¿ 
 
The
Complaint contains a section titled “ALLEGATIONS COMMON TO ALL CAUSES OF
ACTION” stating facts that led to the filing of this action without
specifying which facts show that Defendants acted with malice, oppression, or
fraud. Paragraphs 45, 61, and 98 are conclusory because they are devoid of
facts and state that Defendants acted with recklessness and conscious disregard
of Plaintiff’s rights, entitling Plaintiff to punitive damages. 
 
Paragraph
52 states that Defendants acted with oppression and malice when they refused to
maintain the property in a safe and habitable condition because they intended
to force Plaintiff to vacate the property without complying with their legal
obligations and with willful disregard for Plaintiff’s rights as a tenant.
(Compl. 52.) Paragraph 78 similarly alleges that Defendants acted with malice
in refusing to maintain the property in a safe and habitable condition with the
intent to force Plaintiff to “voluntarily” give up possession. (Compl. ¶ 78.) 
 
The
inhabitable conditions noted in the Complaint include leaks under the sink and
skylight that “were never properly remediated and caused mold to proliferate
throughout the home, causing Plaintiff to become ill.” (Compl. ¶ 15.)
Defendants' efforts to repair the mold were superficial, in that they cleaned
off the mold and painted over it without fixing the underlying water intrusion,
meaning that mold recurred. (Compl. ¶ 17.) Plaintiff fails to state that the
Defendants’ efforts to properly fix the mold issue was intentional rather than
merely negligent. The Plaintiff fails to show how negligent repairs are
evidence of malice, fraud, or oppression. “Mere negligence, even gross
negligence, is not sufficient to justify such an award” for punitive damages. (Kendall
Yacht Corp. v. United California Bank (1975) 50 Cal.App.3d 949, 958.)
 
The
Complaint also alleges that Defendants fixed a door that was falling off its
hinges by screwing it “back into its rotting frame” (¶¶ 16.) According to the
Complaint, this was a recurring issue and caused Plaintiff to suffer injury
when she tried to lift and close the front door. (Compl. ¶¶ 18, 21, 28.) On
January 2, 2022, the door fell again due to its rotten frame, jammed the
deadbolt, and locked Plaintiff inside her apartment overnight. (Compl. ¶ 34.)
Plaintiff injured her back trying to get out of her home. (Compl. ¶ 34.)
Consequently, Plaintiff was left without a functional door for over two months
until March 8, 2022. (Compl. ¶ 35.) Plaintiff fails to allege facts that show
that Defendants’ failure to properly fix the door and its frame was
intentional. Plaintiff does not allege that she requested that the door and
door frame be fixed, that Defendants refused to fix the door frame, and that
their refusal led to Plaintiff’s injury. 
 
On
October 13, 2021, Defendants ignored Plaintiff's notice that neighbors had been
stacking boxes against the bathroom window of Plaintiff’s unit, which were
rotting or unstable.  The security gate
in front of the window had been pulled off. (Compl. ¶ 29.) Plaintiff fails to
state that she specifically requested that security gate in the window be
repaired, that she was willfully ignored by Defendants, and that the Defendants
inaction, deprived her of property, legal rights, or caused her injury
sufficient to support a claim for punitive damages.   
 
The
Complaint alleges that Plaintiff had difficulty paying rent due to
COVID-19-related job loss and had been borrowing money from family members in
order to pay rent. (Compl. ¶ 23.) Plaintiff alleges that Defendants refused to
cooperate in applying for rent relief via a state-funded program because they
asked Plaintiff to lie and state that she had not been paying rent. (Compl.
¶23.) In September 2021, Plaintiff could no longer pay rent and informed
Defendant Roya that she would be applying for rent relief, but Defendant Roya
suggested that Plaintiff lie to the State by saying she had not paid rent,
while also borrowing money to pay rent and simultaneously applying for rent
relief. (Compl. ¶ 27.) Plaintiff asked that the Defendants also apply for
relief in order to expedite the process, but Defendants refused and instead
threatened the Plaintiff with eviction. (Compl. ¶ 27.)
 
If
Plaintiff borrowed money to pay rent, then Plaintiff was ineligible for rent
relief when it was first offered, as stated in Paragraph 27 of the Complaint.
Therefore, it is unclear how Defendants initially obstructed Plaintiff from
applying for state-funded rent relief. Plaintiff also fails to explain how
Defendants acted with malice, oppression, or fraud in refusing to apply for
rent relief when Defendants did not have a legal obligation to apply for such
relief. 
 
Defendants
communicated that they wanted Plaintiff to leave the property (Compl. ¶¶ 19,
24.) In November 2021, Defendants went as far as to call Plaintiff’s parents,
who were not on the Lease, to inform them that Plaintiff needed to move out,
and they needed to pay rent on behalf of Plaintiff. (Compl. ¶ 30.) When
Plaintiff retained an attorney who wrote a letter on her behalf about her
rights as a tenant, Defendant Roya kicked Plaintiff’s small fence and tossed it
across the yard.  She also threw
Plaintiff’s table into her parking area. (Compl. ¶ 32.) Plaintiff fails to
state how this is evidence of malice, oppression, or fraud and what property or
rights Plaintiff was deprived of or how it caused her injury. 
 
Lastly,
Plaintiff states that on July 14, 2022, the City of Los Angeles issued a
substandard order and notice of fee on the basis that the unit Plaintiff
occupied was substandard and Defendants were ordered to discontinue the use and
occupancy of the unit. (Compl. ¶ 36.) Plaintiff fails to state how the order
and notice are evidence of Defendants, malice, oppression, or fraud. 
 
For
the reasons stated above, the court finds that Plaintiff's claim for punitive
damages is not supported by the facts alleged in the Complaint. 
 
Although
the court agrees that Paragraph 1, line 14; Paragraphs 45, 52, 61, 78, and 98
as well as the request for punitive damages in the Prayer for Relief as to
Paragraphs 1(b), 2(b), and 4(b) to 8(b) should be stricken, the court denies
the request to strike the causes of action that incorporate said Paragraphs by
reference as Defendants fail to show that the causes of action are deficient.
Where a motion to strike is so broad as to include relevant matters, the motion
should be denied as the proper pleading challenge by an opponent in such a case
is a special demurrer to the cause of action. (Triodyne, Inc. v. Superior
Court (1966) 240 Cal.App.2d 536, 542.)
 
Accordingly,
only Paragraphs 45, 52, 61, 78, and 98 as well as Paragraphs 1(b), 2(b), and
4(b) to 8(b) in the prayer for relief will be stricken with leave to amend. 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendants’
motion to strike is granted in part. Paragraphs 45, 52, 61, 78, and 98 as well
as Paragraphs 1(b), 2(b), and 4(b) to 8(b) in the prayer for relief will be
stricken with leave to amend.
