And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the defendants' motion to strike the plaintiff's claim for punitive damages is granted in part. Specifically, paragraphs 45, 52, 61, 78, and 98, as well as paragraphs 1(b), 2(b), and 4(b) to 8(b) in the prayer for relief, will be stricken with leave to amend. The court finds that the plaintiff has failed to state facts that show the defendants acted with malice, oppression, or fraud, which is required to support a claim for punitive damages. The court has also denied the request to strike the causes of action that incorporate the stricken paragraphs by reference, as the defendants failed to show that the causes of action are deficient. The court has given the plaintiff leave to amend, but the plaintiff will need to replead the stricken paragraphs with specific facts that show the defendants' alleged wrongdoing.
