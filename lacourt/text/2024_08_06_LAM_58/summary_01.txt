And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has granted the motion to quash service of summons filed by the specially appearing defendants, Franco Vago SpA and Nippon Express Italia SpA. The judge found that the court lacks personal jurisdiction over the Italian defendants, as they are based entirely in Italy and have no minimum contacts with California. The judge also rejected the plaintiff's arguments that general or specific jurisdiction can be established through the representative services doctrine, alter ego doctrine, or single enterprise doctrine. The judge noted that the plaintiff failed to provide any evidence to support these theories, and that the Italian defendants have not purposefully availed themselves to California. The judge concluded that the court lacks jurisdiction over the Italian defendants and dismissed them from the case.
