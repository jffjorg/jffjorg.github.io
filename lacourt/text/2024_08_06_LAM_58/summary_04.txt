And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to continue the trial date and related dates due to the plaintiff's health condition. The plaintiff, John McCarty, has a history of cancer and other medical issues that require his focused attention. He has also been diagnosed with four confirmed melanomas and has undergone surgeries and other treatments. The plaintiff's doctor has advised him that he needs to prioritize his health and take time off to address his medical issues.

The judge considered the factors for granting a continuance, including the proximity of the trial date, whether there were any previous continuances, the length of the continuance requested, and the availability of alternative means to address the problem. The judge also considered the plaintiff's excused inability to obtain essential testimony, documents, or other material evidence despite diligent efforts.

The defendants did not dispute the good cause for continuing the trial date, but asked that the court only continue the discovery cut-off date for some forms of discovery. The judge denied this request and instead continued all trial-related dates. The judge also set a status conference in early September to review the plaintiff's progress in finding an attorney to replace him in this matter.

The trial date is now advanced and continued to a new date in 2025. The final status conference is also advanced and continued to a new date. The hearing on the defendants' motion for summary judgment remains unchanged.
