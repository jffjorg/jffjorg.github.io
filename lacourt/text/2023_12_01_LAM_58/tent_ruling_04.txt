            This
action arises from a breach of an Agreement for the Purchase and Sale of Future
Receipts. Plaintiff IMS Fund, LLC (Plaintiff) sued Defendant Doarian Okeel
Anthony Bennett (Defendant), asserting a cause of action for breach of contract
and common counts. Plaintiff alleges it advanced the sum of $45,000.00 to
Defendant and in exchange Defendant agreed to pay Plaintiff the sum of
$67,050.00 from future receivables earned by delivering to Plaintiff weekly
thirty two percent (32%) of the proceeds of each future sale made by Defendant.
According to the First Amended Complaint, Defendant breached this Agreement.
            
            The
Complaint was filed on January 5, 2023. An Amended Complaint was filed on March
3, 2023. Default was entered against September 20, 2023. 
 
            Plaintiff
now moves for default judgment against Defendant. Does 1-20 have been dismissed.
This is Plaintiff’s second attempt at entry of default judgment. The request
for entry of default judgment is granted conditionally upon the filing of a
declaration that complies with Code of Civil Procedure section 2015.5,
subdivision (b).  
 
Discussion
 
            Plaintiff
seeks default judgment in the amount of $45,426.62, which includes $5,524 in
interest, $1,049.43 in costs, and $1,510.29 in attorney fees. 
 
            Plaintiff
submits the declaration of Oleg Rud, Managing Manager of Plaintiff, to substantiate
its default judgment request. The evidence supports the request for damages in
the amount requested of $37,342.80. (Rud Decl., ¶ 5.) The declaration also
provides an interest calculation at the rate of 10% per annum (the daily rate
of $10.23) from May 24, 2022 (the date Defendant became indebted to Plaintiff)
to November 16, 2023 in the amount of $5,524. (Rud Decl., ¶ 5.) Further, the
declaration substantiates the request for attorney fees and costs, as well.
(Rud Decl., ¶ 6.) 
 
However, the declaration
again suffers from defects. Importantly, the declaration does not comply with
Code of Civil Procedure section 2015.5, subdivision (b). Specifically, the
declaration is signed: “I declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
the State of New York that the foregoing is true and correct. Executed on
11/15/2023, New York, New York.” (Rud Decl.) Thus, the declaration is not
properly signed under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
California. 
 
            The
request for default judgment is granted conditionally upon the filing of an
identical declaration that complies with Code of Civil Procedure section
2015.5, subdivision (b).
