And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has placed the motion to compel off calendar due to a defect in notice. The motion was filed by D&M Home Inspections, seeking an order compelling Plaintiff Monica Gonzalez to serve complete verified responses to their special interrogatories, Set 1, within 7 days after the hearing on the motion. The judge notes that there is no evidence before the court that any of the plaintiffs have consented to receive electronic service, and the motion was served on the plaintiffs by email. The judge finds that the proof of service indicates that the motion was served on all plaintiffs by email, but there is no evidence of consent to receive electronic service. As a result, the motion is placed off calendar.
