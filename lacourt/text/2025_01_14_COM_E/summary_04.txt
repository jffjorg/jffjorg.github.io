And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying a motion to consolidate two lawsuits filed by Jasmine Baldwin and Ciara Pannell against Uber Technologies and Arthur Randolph McDonald. The lawsuits arise from the same automobile accident that occurred on February 13, 2022, and the plaintiffs are seeking damages for personal injury and property damage. The defendant argued that consolidating the cases would avoid unnecessary costs and delays, but the Judge denied the motion because the cases have not yet been deemed related and the defendant failed to file a motion to consolidate in one of the cases, as required by the California Rules of Court. The motion is denied without prejudice, meaning that the defendant can refile the motion if the cases are later deemed related.
