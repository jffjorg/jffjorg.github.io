And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The Tentative Ruling denies Plaintiff Daniel Bejines' Motion for Leave to Amend First Amended Complaint. The Plaintiff's motion does not comply with the mandatory requirements of California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1324, which requires a supporting declaration to set forth explicitly what allegations are to be added and where, and explicitly stating what new evidence was discovered warranting the amendment and why the amendment was not made earlier. The motion does not explain the nature of the proposed amendment, simply stating that the allegations in the Second Amended Complaint are being focused.
