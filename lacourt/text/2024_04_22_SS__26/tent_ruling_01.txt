Bejines v. MDT Properties, Inc., et al.LEAVE
TO AMEND PLEADING(CCP §§ 473(a), 576; CRC Rule 3.1324)
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Plaintiff Daniel Bejines’ Motion
for Leave to Amend First Amended Complaint is DENIED.
 
 
ANALYSIS:
 
This case is a landlord-tenant
dispute by Tenant-Plaintiff Daniel Bejines (“Plaintiff), initially in propria
persona, against Landlord-Defendant MDT Properties, Inc. (“Defendant”). On July
7, 2021, Plaintiff filed the initial Complaint, alleging fraud and demanding,
inter alia, that he be returned the security deposit he paid to lease an
apartment from Defendant from January to March of 2021. On November 30, 2021,
the Court sustained Defendant’s demurrer to each cause of action in the initial
Complaint. On January 19, 2022, Plaintiff filed the First Amended Complaint,
alleging: (1) deceit; (2) bad faith penalty withholding of security deposit;
(3) nuisance; and (4) constructive eviction. On May 10, 2022 the Court
overruled Defendant’s demurrer to the First Amended Complaint as to the first
and second causes of action, and sustained the demurrer as to the third and
fourth causes of action with only 20 days’ leave to amend from notice of the
order. (Minute Order, 05/10/22, pp. 11-12.) Plaintiff did not appear at that
hearing and no proof of service of the order was filed demonstrating that
Plaintiff was given notice as ordered. (See id. at p. 12.) 
 
At the case management conference
on July 14, 2022, corrected by nunc pro tunc, the Court ordered Defendant to
file an answer to the second cause of action of the First Amended Complaint.
(Minute Orders, 07/14/22 and 10/17/22.) Defendant filed an answer on October
25, 2022. At the case management conference on January 5, 2023, Plaintiff
appeared and the Court ordered that a Second Amended Complaint could not be
filed without a motion for leave. (Minute Order, 01/05/23.) The parties
attended a mandatory settlement conference but the case did not resolve. At the
next case management conference on August 1, 2023, the parties stipulated to
transfer the action to the limited jurisdiction court. (Minute Order,
08/01/23.) 
 
On February 20, 2024, Plaintiff
filed the instant Motion for Leave to Amend First Amended Complaint. No
opposition has been filed to date. 
 
Discussion
 
Plaintiff moves for leave to
amend the First Amended Complaint pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section
473, subdivision (a) and section 576. A motion for leave to amend a pleading
must also comply with the procedural requirements of California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1324, which
requires a supporting declaration to set forth explicitly what allegations are
to be added and where, and explicitly stating what new evidence was discovered
warranting the amendment and why the amendment was not made earlier. The motion
must also include (1) a copy of the proposed and numbered amendment, (2)
specifications by reference to pages and lines the allegations that would be
deleted and added, and (3) a declaration specifying the effect, necessity and
propriety of the amendments, date of discovery and reasons for delay. (Cal.
Rules of Court, Rule 3.1324, subds. (a), (b).)
 
Plaintiff’s Motion does not explain the nature of the
proposed amendment. He simply declares he is “focusing the allegations in the
Second Amended Complaint.” (Motion, Bejines Decl., p. 5:2-3.) Simply attaching
a copy of the proposed Second Amended Complaint, as Plaintiff has done, is not
sufficient to meet the mandatory requirements set forth above.
 
Conclusion
 
Therefore, Plaintiff Daniel
Bejines’ Motion for Leave to Amend First Amended Complaint is DENIED.
 
 
Moving party to give notice.
