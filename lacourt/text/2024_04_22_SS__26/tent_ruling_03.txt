ANALYSIS:
 
On November 27, 2023, Petitioners Daniel Garza and Angela
Dejesus (“Petitioners”) filed the instant Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award
against Respondents Lisa Holder, Esq. and Law Offices of Lisa Holder
(“Respondents”). No response to the Petition has been filed to date.
 
 
Discussion
 
This Petition relates to attorney-client fee arbitration under Code of
Civil Procedure section 6203. The “arbitration award shall become binding upon
the passage of 30 days after service of notice of the award, unless a party
has, within the 30 days, sought a trial after arbitration pursuant to Section
6204.” (Cal. Bus. & Profs. Code, § 6203, subd. (b).) The Award was served
on the parties by the arbitrator on July 14, 2022. (Pet., Exh. A, p. 30.) No
trial after arbitration was sought by August 15, 2022. 
 
As there is no pending action regarding the arbitration
award, its confirmation may be sought in the same manner as provided in Code of
Civil Procedure section 1285, et seq. “Any party to an arbitration in which an
award has been made may petition the court to confirm, correct or vacate the
award.  The petition shall name as
respondent all parties to the arbitration and may name as respondents any other
persons bound by the arbitration award.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1285.) “If a petition or response under this
chapter is duly served and filed, the court shall confirm the award as made,
whether rendered in this state or another state, unless in accordance with this
chapter it corrects the award and confirms it as corrected, vacates the award
or dismisses the proceeding.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 1286.)
 
A response to a
Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award that seeks to vacate or correct the award
must be served and filed no later than 100 days after the date of the service
of a signed copy of the award on the respondent. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1288.2.)
 
Discussion
 
Service of the Petition and Notice of Hearing
 
Code of Civil
Procedure, section 1290.4 requires that the Petition and Notice of Hearing be
served on Respondent “in the manner provided in the arbitration agreement for
the service of such petition and notice” or “[i]f the arbitration agreement
does not provide the manner in which such service shall be made . . . [s]ervice
within this State shall be made in the manner provided by law for the service
of summons in an action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1290.4, subds. (a), (b).) 
 
Petitioners have not
shown that the parties’ arbitration agreement provides for the manner of
service of the Petition and Notice of Hearing. It follows that the Petition and
Notice of Hearing must be served in the manner provided by law for service of a
summons, which is set forth at Code of Civil Procedure sections 415.10 to
415.95. Petitioners filed personal proof of service of the Petition, Notice of
Hearing and Notice Re: Continuance of Hearing and Order solely with respect to
Respondent Holder. (Proof of Service, filed 01/29/24.) No proof of service has
been filed with respect to Respondent Law Office. Therefore, the Court cannot find
that service of the Petition conforms to Code of Civil Procedure section 1290.4
for Respondent Law Office.  
 
Service of the Arbitration Award and Timing of Service
of Petition (CCP §§ 1283.6, 1288, 1288.4)
 
Code of Civil
Procedure section 1283.6 requires that “[t]he neutral arbitrator shall serve a
signed copy of the award on each party to the arbitration personally or by
registered or certified mail or as provided in the agreement.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1283.6.) This requirement may be satisfied by service by the
arbitrator, or upon proper service of the Award with the Petition. (See Murry v. Civil Service Employees Ins. Co. (1967) 254 Cal.App.2d 796, 799-800.) The
arbitration award is not accompanied by a proof of service but Petitioners have
demonstrated that the award was served on Respondent Holder with the instant
Petition. (Pet., Attachment 6(c).)
 
Also, a party seeking a court judgment confirming an
arbitration award must file and serve the petition no more than four years, but
not less than 10 days, after the award is served.
(Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1288, 1288.4.) With respect to Respondent Holder, Petitioner
has demonstrated compliance with Code
of Civil Procedure sections 1288 and 1288.4 by serving the instant
Petition two-and-a-half months after the award was issued on July 11, 2022.
 
However, there is no showing of service of the
arbitration award upon Respondent Law Office. 
 
Confirmation of the Arbitration Award
 
An arbitration award
is not directly enforceable until it is confirmed by a court and judgment is
entered.  (Code Civ. Proc. § 1287.6; Jones
v. Kvistad (1971) 19 Cal.App.3d 836, 840.) The court must confirm the award
as made, unless it corrects or vacates the award, or dismisses the
proceeding.  (CCP § 1286; Valsan
Partners Limited Partnership v. Calcor Space Facility, Inc. (1994) 25
Cal.App.4th 809, 818.) Code of Civil Procedure, section 1285.4 states a
petition under this chapter shall:
 
a)     
Set forth the substance of or have attached a copy of
the agreement to arbitrate unless the petitioner denies the existence of such
an agreement.
 
b)     
Set forth the names of the arbitrators.
 
c)     
Set forth or have attached a copy of the award and the
written opinion of the arbitrators, if any.
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1285.4.) The Petition complies with the above
requirements. It sets forth the nature of the arbitration agreement and the
name of the arbitrator. (Pet., ¶4.) A copy of the arbitration agreement is also
attached. (Id. at Attachment 6(c).) Substantively, the Petition
demonstrates that Petitioners are entitled to an award of $11,497.50 from
Respondents. (Id. at Attachment 6(c), p. 28.) 
 
Attorney’s Fees,
Costs and Interest
 
To the extent Petitioners request costs of $370.00 (Pet., ¶10e),
those are permitted on a petition to confirm arbitration award. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1293.2; MBNA America Bank, N.A. v. Gorman (2006) 147
Cal.App.4th.Supp. 1, 7.) The interest sought by Petitioners, ten percent per
annum from 30 days after the award was issued, is also appropriate pursuant to
Civil Code section 3289, subdivision (b).
 
Conclusion
 
Petitioners Daniel Garza and Angela Dejesus’ Petition to Confirm
Arbitration Award is CONTINUED TO JUNE 24, 2024 AT 10:00 AM IN DEPARTMENT 26 IN
THE SPRING STREET COURTHOUSE. BY JUNE 3, 2024, PETITIONERS ARE TO FILE PROOF OF
SERVICE OF THE PETITION AND NOTICE OF HEARING DATE ON RESPONDENT LAW OFFICES OF
LISA HOLDER. FAILURE TO DO SO MAY RESULT IN THE PETITION BEING DISMISSED.
