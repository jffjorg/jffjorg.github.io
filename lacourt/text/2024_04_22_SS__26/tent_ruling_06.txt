 Hurtado v. Counts, et al.VACATE DEFAULT AND DEFAULT JUDGMENT
(CCP §§ 473(b))
 
TENTATIVE RULING: 
 
Defendant Catarina Counts’ Motion
to Vacate Entry of Default is DENIED.
 
                                                                                                                                
ANALYSIS:
 
On April 18, 2023, Plaintiff Valerie Hurtado (“Plaintiff”)
filed the instant action for motor vehicle negligence against Defendants Catarina
Counts (“Defendant Counts”) and Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation
Authority (“Defendant Metro”) (erroneously sued as “Los Angeles County
Metropolitan Transit Authority”). Following Defendant Count’s failure to file a
responsive pleading, the Court entered their default on September 25, 2023. Defendants
then filed answers to the Complaint on November 17, 2023.
 
Defendant Counts filed the instant Motion to Vacate Default
on March 22, 2024. No opposition has been filed to date. 
 
Discussion
 
Initially, the Court strikes Defendant Counts’ answer filed
on November 17, 2023 pursuant to its inherent authority under Code of Civil
Procedure section 436, subdivision (b). The answer was filed while Defendant
Counts was in default and not permitted to file a responsive pleading. (Sporn
v. Home Depot USA, Inc. (2005) 126 Cal.App.4th 1294, 1301 [holding that entry
of default cuts off the defendant's right to take further affirmative steps
such as filing a pleading or motion].) 
 
The Motion to Vacate is brought pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 473, subdivision (b), which states that an application for
relief must be made within a reasonable time, no more than six  months after entry of the order from which
relief is sought and must be accompanied by an affidavit of fault attesting to
the mistake, inadvertence, surprise or neglect of the moving party or its
attorney. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b); English v. IKON Business
Solutions (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 130, 143.) The motion must also be
accompanied by a copy of the moving defendant’s proposed pleading. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 473, subd. (b).) This can be corrected if the defendant submits a
proposed responsive pleading by the hearing date. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473,
subd. (b); Carmel, Ltd. v. Tavoussi (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 393, 403.) 
 
Defendant Counts does not demonstrate that the instant
Motion was timely filed within a reasonable amount of time. Where the statute requires that “ ‘ “the application
must be made within a ‘reasonable time’ … what is a reasonable time in any case
depends upon the circumstances of that particular case.” While in “the
determination of that question, a large discretion is necessarily confided to
[the trial] court” ... there must be some showing—some evidence—as the basis
for the exercise of such discretion.’ ” (Caldwell v. Methodist Hospital
(1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 1521, 1524 [citing Carrasco v. Craft (1985) 164
Cal.App.3d 796, 805].)
 
Defendant Counts does not address the reasonable time
requirement and only declares that they learned of the entry of default on
March 21, 2024. The request for entry of default, however, was mailed to
Defendant Counts on September 25, 2023 at the same address where the Summons
and Complaint were served. (Request for Entry of Default, filed 09/25/23, ¶6b.)
Furthermore, Defendant Counts obtained counsel who filed an answer on November
17, 2023. The instant Motion to Vacate Default, however, was not filed until
almost six months after the entry of default. 
 
Defendant Counts also contends
that they did not respond because they assumed Defendant Metro was already
aware of the action and would respond on their behalf. (Motion, Counts Decl.,
¶2.) The Motion, however, does not analyze whether such an assumption, without
taking any other action, was an honest and reasonable mistake or excusable neglect.
The Court of Appeals has explained the statutory language as follows: “There
is, to be sure, a policy in favor of trying cases on their merits. And it is an
important one. But there are other policies reflected in the requirement of
section 473(b) that relief be granted only where a party has made an honest and
reasonable mistake, policies implicating judicial efficiency, a fair legal
process and timely access to the courts.” (McClain v. Kissler (2019) 39
Cal.App.5th 399, 405.) 
 
Therefore, Defendant Counts has
not demonstrated they are entitled to relief from the entry of default pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b).
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant Catarina Counts’ Motion to Vacate Entry of Default
is DENIED.
 
 
Court clerk to give notice.
