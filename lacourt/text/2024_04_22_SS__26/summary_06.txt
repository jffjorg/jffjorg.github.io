Here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied Defendant Catarina Counts' motion to vacate the entry of default. The defendant failed to file a responsive pleading, and the court entered a default judgment against them. The defendant then filed an answer to the complaint, and subsequently filed a motion to vacate the default. The judge ruled that the motion was not timely filed, and that the defendant did not demonstrate that they made an honest and reasonable mistake. The judge also noted that the defendant did not address the requirement that the motion be filed within a reasonable time.
