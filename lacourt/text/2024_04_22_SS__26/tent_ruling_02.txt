ANALYSIS:
 
On July 22, 2022, Plaintiff
Mercury Insurance Company filed the instant action for automobile subrogation
against Defendants Adrian Bernique Scipio and Kamerin Scipio-Smith (“Defendants”).
Proofs of substitute service of the Summons and Complaint were filed on August
11, 2022 and October 11, 2022. The action came for trial on January 19, 2024,
at which time Plaintiff failed to appear and the Court dismissed the action
without prejudice. (Minute Order, 01/19/24.). (Ibid.) 
 
Plaintiff filed the instant Motion to Vacate Dismissal on
March 7, 2024. No opposition to the Motion has been filed to date.
 
Discussion
 
The motion is brought
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure, section 473, subdivision (b). Under this statute, an application for relief must be made
no more than six months after entry of the order from which relief is sought
and must be accompanied by an affidavit of fault attesting to the moving
party’s mistake, inadvertence, surprise or neglect. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473,
subd. (b); English v. IKON Business Solutions (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 130,
143.) When based on attorney fault with respect to entry of default, default
judgment, or involuntary dismissal, a timely request for relief must be
granted. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b).) When brought pursuant to the
provision for discretionary relief based on party fault, the request must have
been filed within a reasonable amount of time. 
 
The motion was timely filed less
than two months after dismissal of the action and is supported by an attorney
affidavit of fault. Plaintiff’s counsel declares that they mis-calendared the
date of the trial. (Motion, Tapper Decl., ¶2.) Therefore, the case must be
reinstated under Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b).
