And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge's tentative ruling is that the Plaintiff's Motion to Vacate Dismissal is granted. The dismissal entered on January 19, 2024 is hereby vacated. An Order to Show Cause re Failure to Enter Default and Default Judgment is set for May 28, 2024 at 9:30 AM in Department 26 in the Spring Street Courthouse. The judge's ruling is based on the fact that the Plaintiff's counsel mis-calendared the date of the trial, and the Motion to Vacate Dismissal was timely filed less than two months after dismissal of the action. The judge is reinstating the action under Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b).
