Here is a summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for terminating and monetary sanctions against Plaintiff Garcia. The motion was brought by Defendants Virgie and Exekiel, who are seeking to impose terminating sanctions on Plaintiff Garcia for failing to comply with the Court's March 26, 2024 order. The Court found that Plaintiff Garcia's conduct is in clear violation of the order and that he has willfully misused the discovery process. However, the Court denied the motion for terminating sanctions, finding that it was not appropriate at this time. Instead, the Court granted the motion for monetary sanctions against Plaintiff Garcia and his counsel, jointly and severally, in the amount of $455.34. The Court also ordered Plaintiff Garcia to serve verified responses to Defendant Virgie's discovery requests within 20 days of receipt of the order.
