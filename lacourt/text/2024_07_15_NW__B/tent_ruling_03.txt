BACKGROUND
 
On May 6, 2022, Plaintiffs Mario Fernando Velasquez
(“Velasquez”) and Reynaldo Garcia (“Garcia”) (collectively, “Plaintiffs”),
filed this action against Defendants Virgie Robrigado Binasahan (“Virgie”), Exekiel
R. Binasahan (“Exekiel”), and Jayvee R. Binasahan for damages arising from a
motor vehicle accident that occurred on November 25, 2021.
 
On March 25, 2024, the Court granted Defendant Virgie’s
motions to compel discovery directed at Plaintiff Velasquez, and ordered
Plaintiff Velasquez “to serve verified responses to
Defendant Virgie’s (1) form interrogatories, set one, (2) special
interrogatories, set one, and (3) demand for inspection and production of documents,
set one, without objections, within twenty (20) days.” (See March 25, 2024
Minute Order at pg. 2.) Additionally, the Court ordered “Plaintiff Velasquez
and/or his counsel are ordered to pay sanctions to Defendant Virgie, by and
through counsel of record, in the total amount of $565.17, within twenty (20)
days.” (Id. at pg. 3.)
 
On March 26, 2024, the Court granted Defendant Virgie’s
motions to compel discovery directed at Plaintiff Garcia and ordered Plaintiff
Garcia “to serve verified responses to Defendant Virgie’s (1) form
interrogatories, set one, (2) special interrogatories, set one, and (3) demand
for inspection and production of documents, set one, without objections, within
twenty (20) days.” (See March 26, 2024 Minute Order at pg. 2.) Additionally,
the Court ordered “Garcia and/or his counsel are ordered to pay sanctions to
Defendant Virgie, by and through counsel of record, in the total amount of
$565.17, within twenty (20) days.” (Id. at pg. 3.) 
 
Defendants Virgie and Exekiel (collectively, “Defendants”) now
move for the Court to impose terminating sanctions against Plaintiff Garcia on
the grounds that Plaintiff Garcia has failed to comply with the Court’s March
26, 2024 order. Alternatively, Defendants request the Court to impose $455.34
in monetary sanctions against Plaintiff Garcia. 
 
No opposition has been received.
 
[Tentative] Ruling
 
Legal
Standard
 
“The discovery statutes evince an incremental approach to discovery
sanctions, starting with monetary sanctions and ending with the ultimate
sanction of termination.” (Doppes v. Bentley Motors, Inc. (2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 967, 992.)
“Discovery sanctions should be appropriate to the dereliction, and should not
exceed that which is required to protect the interests of the party entitled to
but denied discovery.” (Ibid.)
“[C]ontinuing misuses of the discovery process warrant incrementally harsher
sanctions until the sanction is reached that will curb the abuse.” (Ibid.) Where discovery violations are
“willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less
severe sanctions would not produce compliance with discovery rules, the trial
court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction.” (Ibid.) A trial court has broad discretion to impose discovery
sanctions, but two facts are generally a prerequisite to the imposition of
nonmonetary sanctions. (Biles v. Exxon
Mobil Corp. (2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1327.) Where discovery sanctions
are requested against a party, there must be a failure to comply with a court
order and the failure must be willful. (Ibid.)  
 
“A decision to order terminating sanctions should not be
made lightly.” (Creed-21 v. City of
Wildomar (2017) 18 Cal.App.5th 690, 702.) A trial court’s order to impose
terminating sanctions will be reversed only if it “was arbitrary, capricious,
or whimsical.” (Id. at 702.)  “[W]here a violation is willful, preceded by
a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not
produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial court is justified in imposing
the ultimate sanction.” (Id. at p.
702.) Trial courts have properly imposed terminating sanctions when parties
have willfully disobeyed one or more
discovery orders. (Los Defensores,
Inc. v. Gomez (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 377, 390.) Terminating sanctions are
warranted when a party’s lack of compliance with the discovery process has
caused the opposing party prejudice. (Doppes
v. Bentley Motors, Inc., supra, 174 Cal.App.4th 967, 989.)
 
Discussion
 
            Terminating
Sanctions
 
As advanced in Defendants’ motion, Plaintiff Garcia has
failed to comply with the Court’s March 26, 2024 Order. The Court ordered
Plaintiff Garcia to provide verified responses and without objections to Defendants’
discovery requests within 20 days of service of the order on October 24, 2023.
(See March 26, 2024 Minute Order at pg. 2.) Furthermore, the Court ordered
Plaintiff Garcia and/or his counsel to pay $565.17 in monetary sanctions. (Id.
at pg. 3.) Defendants gave notice of the Court’s order on March 28, 2024.
(Motion at pg. 4; Babadjanian Decl. ¶ 6, Exh. A.) To date, Plaintiff Garcia has
neither provided responses to the subject discovery nor paid the awarded
monetary sanctions. (Id. at ¶¶ 7-10.)
 
 
The Court finds that Plaintiff Garcia’s conduct is in clear
violation of the Court’s March 26, 2024 Order. Because Plaintiff Garcia has
chosen not to file an opposition, he
has failed to explain why he has been unable to comply with the Court’s order,
and as a result, the Court finds that Plaintiff Garcia has willfully misused
the discovery process by this lack of diligence. (Deyo v. Kilbourne
(1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 771, 787 [“Lack of diligence may be deemed willful in the
sense that the party understood his obligation, had the ability to comply, and
failed to comply.”])
 
Nevertheless, the Court is mindful that an order for
terminating sanctions must not be made lightly and any sanctions must be
tailored to the discovery violation. (Creed-21,
supra, 18 Cal.App.5th at 702; Doppes,
supra, 174 Cal.App.4th at 992.) Thus, the Court must take an incremental
approach to discovery sanctions. The Court therefore finds that terminating
sanctions are not appropriate at this time.
 
Accordingly, the Court denies Defendants’ request for
terminating sanctions. 
 
            Monetary
Sanctions
 
Alternatively, Defendants argues that the Court should
impose further monetary sanctions against Plaintiff Garcia in the amount of
$455.34. (Motion at pg. 7.) 
 
California
Code of Civil Procedure, § 2023.030 provides that “[t]he court may
impose a monetary sanction ordering that one engaging in the misuse of the
discovery process, or any attorney advising that conduct, or both pay the
reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result
of that conduct.”  A misuse of the
discovery process “include[s] . . . [d]isobeying a court order to provide
discovery.”  (Doppes, supra, 174
Cal.App.4th at 991.)  
 
Based
on Plaintiff Garcia’s violation, the Court does find that monetary sanctions
are appropriate against Plaintiff Garcia and his counsel of record for their
failure to comply with the Court’s March 26, 2024 Order. In this instance,
Defendants seek monetary sanctions in the amount of $455.34, consisting of two
hours preparing the instant motion at a rate of $160.17 per hour. (Babadjanian
Decl. ¶ 11.) This amount is reasonable and shall be awarded in full. 
 
Conclusion
 
The Court denies Defendants’ motion for terminating
sanctions. Alternatively, the Court grants Defendant’s request for monetary
sanction against Plaintiff Garcia and his counsel of record, jointly and
severally, in the amount of $455.34. Payment shall be tendered to Defendants’
counsel within 30 days of notice of this order. 
 
The Court shall provide Plaintiff Garcia a second
opportunity to comply with the Court’s March 26, 2024. Plaintiff Garcia is ordered
to serve verified responses to Defendant Virgie’s (1) form interrogatories, set
one, (2) special interrogatories, set one, and (3) demand for inspection and
production of documents, set one, without objections, within twenty (20) days
of receipt of this order. (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 2030.290(a),(b),
2031.300(a),(b).)
