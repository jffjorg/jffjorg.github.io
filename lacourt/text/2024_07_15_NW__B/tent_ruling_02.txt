[TENTATIVE] ORDER RE: MOTION
  TO BE RELIEVED AS COUNSEL
 
Dept. B
1:30 p.m. 
July 15, 2024



 
 
1. Background
            On
December 3, 2021, Plaintiff Joesph Parraga (“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint
against Defendant Ramon Ochart, Joann Ochart, and DOES 1 to 10, alleging causes
of action for: (1) General Negligence; (2) Intentional Tort – Violently Struck
in Chest; and (3) Intentional Tort – Trespass.
            On
May 2, 2024, K. Kevin Levian, Esq. of Levian Law filed a motion to be relieved
as counsel. ON June 4, 2024, this Court denied the motion without prejudice. 
K. Kevin Levian,
Esq. of Levian Law (“Counsel”), at this time, moves to be relieved as counsel
for Defendant Ramon Ochart. The motion is unopposed. 
 
2. Motion to be Relieved as
Counsel 
Counsel contends
there has been attorney-client communication issues on several occasions and as
result has only been able to contact family members. Counsel further contends
that it is to the benefit of Defendant Ochart to have counsel with the same beliefs.
Moreover, Counsel declares the moving papers have been served on Defendant
Ochart via mail at his last known address and email. Counsel also declares he
was unable to confirm that the address is current after reviewing public
records However, Counsel filed proof of service and a certified return receipt
that Defendant Ochart received the moving papers. Likewise, Counsel has a proof
of service attached to the declaration, which indicates that the Attorney for
Plaintiffs was also served the moving papers. 
Therefore, the
motion is GRANTED. The ruling is effective upon filing proof of service of the
final order. The Court notes the next scheduled matter is final status
conference set for October 8, 2024 and the trial is not scheduled until October
22, 2024. As such, there will be no prejudice as a result of granting the
motion. 
 
Counsel is ordered
to give notice.
 
Dated this 15th day of July,
