[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING MOTION TO COMPEL
  ARBITRATION
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
December 19, 2023



 
On November 21, 2023, Plaintiff
Amelia Carmen Pineda filed this action against Defendant L.A. Desserts Inc.
On
July 19, 2023, Defendant filed a motion to compel arbitration.
When
seeking to compel arbitration of a plaintiff’s claims, the defendant must allege
the existence of an agreement to arbitrate. 
(Condee v. Longwood Management Corp. (2001) 88 Cal.App.4th 215, 219.)  The burden then shifts to the plaintiff to prove
the falsity of the agreement.  (Ibid.)  After the Court determines that an agreement to
arbitrate exists, it then considers objections to its enforceability.  (Ibid.)  The Court must grant a petition to compel arbitration
unless the defendant has waived the right to compel arbitration or if there are
grounds to revoke the arbitration agreement. 
(Ibid.; Code Civ. Proc., § 1281.2.)
Defendant’s
employee handbook provides for arbitration of “any dispute, claim, or controversy
that they may have against each other, including their current and former agents,
owners, officers, directors, or employees, which arise from the employment relationship
between the Restaurant and Employee and/or the termination of that employment relationship.”  (Motion, Ex. A at pp. 72-73.)  Plaintiff signed an acknowledgement and agreement
to the arbitration agreement.  (Motion, Exs.
A-C.)
On
December 6, 2023, Plaintiff filed a notice of non-opposition to Defendant’s motion,
and “Plaintiff will be stipulating to arbitration.”
Accordingly,
the motion to compel arbitration is GRANTED. 
The entire action is STAYED pending the conclusion of the arbitration.
A
Status Conference re: Arbitration is scheduled for 12/19/2024 at 8:30 AM in Department
48 at Stanley Mosk Courthouse.  Five court
days before, the parties are to file a joint report stating the name of their retained
arbitrator and the status of arbitration.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
 
        
Dated this 19th day of December 2023
