  PLAINTIFF’S MOTION TO COMPEL RESPONSES TO REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS,
  SET FIVE
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
December 19, 2023



 
On July 9, 2020, Plaintiff Hilda
Rodriguez-Guzman filed this action against Defendants The Accelerated Schools and
Johnathan Williams.
On
October 25, 2023, Defendants filed a motion for summary judgment, noticing a hearing
date of January 9, 2023.
On
November 20, 2023, Plaintiff filed motions to compel Defendants’ responses to Requests
for Production of Documents, Sets Four and Five.
Trial
is set for March 11, 2024.
A
party may move to compel a further response to a demand for production of documents
if the demanding party deems that the statement of compliance with the demand is
incomplete; the representation of inability to comply is inadequate, incomplete,
or evasive; or an objection in the response is without merit or too general.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (a).)  The motion must set forth specific facts showing
good cause justifying the discovery sought by the demand.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (b)(1).)
MEET AND CONFER
Although
captioned as motions to compel, Plaintiff’s motions are actually motions to compel
further responses.  Because Plaintiff is seeking
to compel further responses to the RFPs, she was required to meet and confer with
Defendants and file a Separate Statement or follow the Court’s alternative method
of outlining the disputes.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2031.310, subd. (b); California Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(b).)  This Department requires the parties to follow
the procedures outlined in Exhibit A of Department 48’s Courtroom Information (available
on the Court’s website) and file a joint statement.
Plaintiff
did not do so.
Plaintiff
provides a long compilation of emails between counsel from July 5, 2022 through
October 20, 2023.  (Gallagher Decl. [Set Four],
Ex. 4; Gallagher Decl. [Set Five] ¶ 15, Ex. 7.) 
In these exchanges, the parties granted each other multiple extension requests
for responses and motions to compel.  In November
2022, they also began discussing mediation. 
On August 17, 2023, one of Plaintiff’s attorneys proposed “withholding on
the motions until we select a mediator/have a mediation,” and defense counsel agreed.  On September 6, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel again
suggested extending the deadline for motions to compel while the parties decided
on a mediator.  On October 6 and 20, 2023,
the parties agreed on further extensions while they scheduled mediation.  The final email in Plaintiff’s exhibits is defense
counsel’s October 20 agreement to extensions of motion to compel deadlines, with
the name of a proposed mediator.
Defendants’
counsel confirms that “the parties did not discuss (verbally or in writing) any
of the specific requests/responses put at issue in this motion.”  (Pizarro Decl. ¶ 13.)
Accordingly,
the Court finds that Defendants’ request for sanctions against Plaintiff’s counsel
is appropriate under Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.020.  Those sanctions will be addressed below.
REQUEST
FOR PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS, SET FOUR
Plaintiff
seeks further responses to RFP Nos. 153-170.
A.        Plaintiff Has Not Shown Good Cause For
Production of Entire Personnel Files (RFP Nos. 153, 156, and 158).
RFP
Nos. 153, 156, and 158 seek the entire personnel files of Jonathan Williams, Patricia
Rodriguez, and Asha Marshall.  Defendants
objected based, in part, on privacy and overbreadth.  They also stated, “Plaintiff is invited to meet
and confer about the scope of this request.”
For
RFP No. 153 (Jonathan Williams), Plaintiff argues only that this information is
relevant because “Defendants have filed a MSJ/MSA challenging the negligent supervision
and retention and sexual harassment claims regarding Mr. Williams.”  This does not set forth specific facts showing
good cause justifying the production of Jonathan Williams’s entire personnel file.  (See Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (b)(1).)
For
RFP Nos. 156 and 158 (Patricia Rodriguez and Asha Marshall), Plaintiff states that
“Defendants have failed to produce the documents,” quotes Code of Civil Procedure
section 2031.280, and cites case law about the broad scope of discovery.  In Plaintiff’s 80-page, 403-paragraph Complaint,
Patricia Rodriguez is mentioned one time. 
(Complaint ¶ 388 [“Plaintiff met with Patricia Rodriguez and Principal Frances.  However, they refused to provide her the accommodations
she needed.”].)  Asha Marshall is not mentioned
at all.  There is no showing of good cause
for the discovery sought about Patricia Rodriguez and Asha Marshall.
The
motion is denied for RFP Nos. 153, 156, and 158.
B.        Defendants Provided Some Full and Compliant
Responses (RFP Nos. 165, 167, 169).
For
RFP Nos. 165, 167, and 169, Defendant responded that “after a diligent search and
reasonable inquiry, Defendant is not in possession, custody or control of responsive
documents, and none exists as Plaintiff was not ‘suspended.’”  This is code-compliant.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2031.210, subd. (a)(2), 2031.230.)
The
motion is denied for RFP Nos. 165, 167, and 169.
C.        Defendants Must Identify Their Documents
(RFP Nos. 154, 155, 157, 159-161, 163).
RFP
Nos. 154, 155, 157, 159-161, and 163, Defendants responded that they will comply
by producing all responsive documents in their possession, custody, and/or control.  This is code-compliant.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.210, subd. (a)(1) [responding
party may respond with “[a] statement that the party will comply with the particular
demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling . . .”]
In
their responsive separate statement, Defendants offer to provide Plaintiff with
a production log that identifies the documents responsive to each request, to comply
with Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.280, subdivision (a).  The motion is granted only to that extent.
Defendants
are ordered to identify the specific request number to which the documents respond
within 10 days.
D.        Plaintiff Has Not Shown Good Cause For
Other RFPs and Did Not Meet and Confer to Narrow the Scope (RFP Nos. 162, 164, 166,
168, 170).
For
RFP Nos. 162 and 164, Defendants objected and stated, “Plaintiff is invited to meet
and confer about the scope of this request.” 
For RFP Nos. 166, 168, and 170, Defendants provided only objections.
For
all of these RFPs, Plaintiff again states that “Defendants have failed to produce
the documents,” quotes Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.280, and cites case
law about the broad scope of discovery.  This
does not set forth specific facts showing good cause justifying the discovery sought.  (See Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (b)(1).)
In
their responsive separate statement, Defendants state that they “would agree to
supplement the requests relating to Asha Marshall and Francis Reading (RFP 166,
170), but would ask for Plaintiff to otherwise specify custodians for RFP no. 168.  There should also be a reasonable substantive
limitation on Plaintiff’s requests for any notes Robert French or Francis Reading
took during any discussions with Plaintiff (RFP 162, 164.).”  As Defendants note, they “were willing to meet
and confer about these issues, but Plaintiff nevertheless chose to file this motion
without engaging in any reasonable efforts.” 
The Court will not attempt to narrow the scope of Plaintiff’s requests without
the parties having first met and conferred about the issue.
The
motion is denied for RFP Nos. 162, 164, 166, 168, and 170.
E.        Conclusion
The
motion is GRANTED IN PART for RFP Nos. 154, 155, 157, 159-161, and 163, as set forth
above.  The motion is otherwise denied.
Plaintiff’s
request for sanctions is denied.
Defendants’
request for sanctions is granted.  (See Code
Civ. Proc., § 2023.020.)  Plaintiff’s counsel
is ordered to pay sanctions of $1,980.00 to Defendants within 30 days.
REQUEST
FOR PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS, SET FIVE
Plaintiff
seeks further responses to RFP Nos. 172-179.
Defendants
did not file an opposition.  Instead, Defendants
filed their opposition to Set Four twice. 
Because of Plaintiff’s complete failure to meet and confer, the Court will
not grant the motion just because it is unopposed.
Also
because of the failure to meet and confer, the parties have not narrowed the issues
and the Court cannot determine the validity of Defendants’ objections and what further
production would be appropriate.
The
motion is DENIED.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
