Tentative
The motion is denied without prejudice.
Background
On June 21, 2021
Plaintiffs Severino Martinez, Luisa Martinez, Jesus
Martinez, by and through his Guardian Ad Litem Severino Martinez, Luisa
Martinez, by and through her Guardian Ad Litem, Severino Martinez, and David
Martinez, by and through his Guardian Ad Liem, Severino Martinez
(collectively “Plaintiffs”) filed a complaint against Jemahlton Thomas and
Lawanda Broussard (collectively “Defendants”) for negligence, negligence per
se, negligence-vicarious liability, and negligence causes of action arising out
of an automobile accident occurring on July 13, 2019.
 
Defendants filed
an answer on December 9, 2022. 
 
Plaintiffs filed
a notice of settlement on June 20, 2023. 
The Court set an OSC re dismissal for October 3, 2023, which was then
continued to December 18, 2023, and then to January 22, 2024.
 
On January
22, 2024, Plaintiffs did not appear.  Plaintiffs’
complaint was dismissed.
 
On May 13, 2024,
Plaintiffs filed this motion to set aside the dismissal. No opposition has been
filed. 
 
Legal Standard
“The court may, upon any terms as may be
just, relieve a party or his or her legal representative from a judgment,
dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken against him or her through his or
her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. Application for this
relief shall be accompanied by a copy of the answer or other pleading proposed
to be filed therein, otherwise the application shall not be granted, and shall
be made within a reasonable time, in no case exceeding six months, after the judgment,
dismissal, order, or proceeding was taken…” (Code Civ. Pro., §473, subd. (b).) 
To qualify for relief under section 473,
the moving party must act diligently in seeking relief and must submit
affidavits or testimony demonstrating a reasonable cause for the
default. (Elston v. City of Turlock (1985) 38 Cal.3d 227, 234.) 
“In a motion under section 473 the initial
burden is on the moving party to prove excusable neglect by a “preponderance of
the evidence. [Citations]”” (Kendall v. Barker (1988) 197 Cal.App.3d
619, 624.) “The moving party has a double burden: He must show a satisfactory
excuse for his default, and he must show diligence in making the motion after
discovery of the default.” (Id. at 625.)
Discussion
Plaintiffs fail
to include proof of service of this motion showing service on Defendants. 
 
For that reason,
the motion is denied without prejudice. 
 
Conclusion
 
The Court DENIES Plaintiffs’ motion to set aside the dismissal
without prejudice for failure to serve Defendants.
 
Moving party to give notice.
