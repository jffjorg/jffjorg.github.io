And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling is related to a motion filed by BP Transportation, Inc. to specially set the hearing for the motion for summary judgment or in the alternative, to continue trial. The court denied the request for a special setting of the hearing due to the impacted calendar of the PI Hub. However, the court granted the motion to continue trial so that BP's timely filed motion for summary judgment can be heard prior to trial. The trial date is advanced and continued to on or after May 30, 2025.
