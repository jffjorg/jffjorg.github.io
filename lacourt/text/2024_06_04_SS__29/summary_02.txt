```
And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling denies the Plaintiffs' motion to set aside the dismissal without prejudice due to their failure to serve the Defendants with the motion. The Plaintiffs had previously failed to appear in court on January 22, 2024, resulting in the dismissal of their complaint. In order to set aside the dismissal, the Plaintiffs must demonstrate a reasonable cause for the default and must act diligently in seeking relief. However, the Plaintiffs failed to include proof of service of the motion, showing that they did not serve the Defendants with the motion. Therefore, the Court denies the Plaintiffs' motion without prejudice.
