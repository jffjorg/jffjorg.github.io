  Case Number:  22LBUD00619    Hearing Date:   September 25, 2023    Dept:  S27 On 8/24/23, the Court heard and overruled Defendant’s demurrer to Plaintiff’s
Second Amended Complaint.  The Court incorporates
its 8/24/23 ruling by reference into this order.  
 
On 9/18/23, Defendant
filed this motion for summary judgment, setting it for hearing on
10/12/23.  On 9/21/23, at the Final Status
Conference, the Court rescheduled the hearing on the summary judgment motion to
9/25/23, to be heard immediately before the scheduled trial.  
 
Defendant’s summary
judgment motion is a mere reiteration of all arguments made in her demurrer,
which was overruled on 8/24/23.  Nothing
is added to the moving papers by way of facts, evidence, or law that would
result in a different outcome from the outcome of the demurrer.  The motion for summary judgment is denied for
the reasons set forth in the 8/24/23 order on the demurrer.  
The parties are reminded that trial
is scheduled to go forward immediately after the hearing on this motion, and
that they were previously ordered, on 9/21/23, to meet and confer regarding
joint trial documents.
