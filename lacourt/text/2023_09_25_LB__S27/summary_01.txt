The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a future court hearing. On August 24, 2023, the court overruled the defendant's demurrer to the plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint. The defendant then filed a motion for summary judgment, which was set for hearing on October 12, 2023. However, the court rescheduled the hearing to September 25, 2023, immediately before the scheduled trial. The judge has denied the defendant's motion for summary judgment, ruling that it is a mere reiteration of the same arguments made in the demurrer and does not add any new facts, evidence, or law to support a different outcome. The parties are reminded that trial is still scheduled to go forward and that they must meet and confer on joint trial documents.

## English Summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling

The Judge has denied the Defendant's motion for summary judgment. The Judge explains that the motion is essentially repeating the arguments made in the Defendant's previous demurrer, which was already overruled.  Since the Defendant did not provide any new facts, evidence, or legal arguments, the Judge denies the motion for summary judgment based on the previous ruling on the demurrer. 

The Judge also reminds the parties that the trial is scheduled to begin immediately after the hearing on the motion and that they were previously ordered to meet and confer regarding joint trial documents.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the defendant's motion for summary judgment and has denied the motion. The defendant's motion is simply a reiteration of the arguments made in her demurrer, which was previously overruled by the court. The defendant has not added any new facts, evidence, or law to support her motion, and therefore the outcome would be the same as the outcome of the demurrer. The parties are reminded that trial is scheduled to begin immediately after the hearing on this motion, and they are still required to meet and confer regarding joint trial documents.
