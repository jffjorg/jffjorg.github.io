And here is the English-language summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a future court hearing. On August 24, 2023, the court overruled the defendant's demurrer to the plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint. The defendant then filed a motion for summary judgment, which was set for hearing on October 12, 2023. However, the court rescheduled the hearing to September 25, 2023, immediately before the scheduled trial. The judge has denied the defendant's motion for summary judgment, ruling that it is a mere reiteration of the same arguments made in the demurrer and does not add any new facts, evidence, or law to support a different outcome. The parties are reminded that trial is still scheduled to go forward and that they must meet and confer on joint trial documents.
