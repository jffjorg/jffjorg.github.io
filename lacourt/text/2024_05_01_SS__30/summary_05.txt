The plaintiffs, Joseph Lupo and Jessie Garcia, failed to provide timely responses to the discovery requests served on them. The court has ordered the plaintiffs to provide responses without objections to the defendants' requests within 20 days of the order. The defendants' request for sanctions is denied, as the court finds that the plaintiffs' counsel has provided substantial justification for the failure to provide timely responses.
