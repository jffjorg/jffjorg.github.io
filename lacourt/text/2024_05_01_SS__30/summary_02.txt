And here is the English summary:

The judge grants the defendant's motion to compel an independent medical examination (IME) with Dr. Akira Ishiyama, an otolaryngologist, to evaluate the plaintiff's tinnitus. The IME will be held on May 17, 2024. The motion was granted due to good cause, as the defendant showed that the medical professionals identified by the defendant are likely to have different, yet probative, input about the nature and causes of the plaintiff's injuries. The court also noted that the plaintiff has retained her own experts in different medical specialties, and that the doctor planned to use non-painful or intrusive procedures. The court exercised its discretion to overlook the plaintiff's untimely opposition and considered the opposition as filed.
