The court has granted the motion and terminated plaintiff's complaint against defendants with prejudice. The court finds that plaintiff has engaged in discovery abuse and has willfully misused the discovery process. Despite numerous attempts to obtain discovery, plaintiff has failed to comply with discovery orders and pay monetary sanctions. The court has imposed monetary sanctions, but plaintiff has still failed to comply. As a result, the court finds that terminating sanctions are warranted in this instance.
