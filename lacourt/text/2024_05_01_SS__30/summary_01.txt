```

And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to strike punitive damages against it, with 30 days leave to amend. The judge found that the plaintiff's allegations in the SAC fail to rise to malice, oppression, or fraud. The plaintiff's allegations of negligence and failure to provide care and supervision are not sufficient to support a claim for punitive damages. The judge also granted the plaintiff's request for judicial notice of certain documents, but not to the truth of the matters asserted within the documents. Finally, the judge granted the plaintiff's request for leave to amend.
