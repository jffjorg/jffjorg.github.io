The plaintiff's counsel has submitted all mandatory judicial council forms and the trial date has not yet been set, so the granting of this motion will not prejudice the plaintiff. The plaintiff is ordered to serve the signed order on the client and file the proof of service within 10 days of the date of the order. The moving party is also ordered to give notice.
