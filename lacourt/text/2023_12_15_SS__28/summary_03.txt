And here is a summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving a dispute between Terminix International Company Limited and Cross-Complainants Caliber Holdings, Caliber, Castro, and RCB. The dispute centers on Terminix's obligation to defend and indemnify Cross-Complainants under a Master Services Agreement (MSA) between Terminix and EMCOR. The MSA requires Terminix to defend and indemnify EMCOR clients, including Cross-Complainants, for any liabilities arising out of their performance under the agreement. The judge finds that Terminix has raised a triable issue of fact regarding Cross-Complainants' right to indemnification, but has not carried its burden of raising a triable issue on the issue of its obligation to provide a defense. The judge grants summary adjudication of the cross-complaint's first cause of action for express contractual indemnification, and grants summary adjudication only with respect to Terminix's contractual obligation to provide a defense to Cross-Complainants. The judge also grants summary adjudication of the cross-complaint's fifth cause of action for declaratory relief (duty to defend).
