And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the motions and oppositions submitted by the parties and has ruled as follows. The defendants have requested a continuance of the trial and reopening of discovery due to the deficiencies in the representation of their previous counsel. The plaintiff and Barmaki, however, argue that the defendants have failed to establish good cause for a continuance and that the defendants are violating their agreement to keep discovery closed.

The judge finds that the defendants have established good cause for a continuance. The defendants have presented evidence that it was only after they retained new counsel and stipulated that discovery would remain closed that they learned of the extent of prior counsel's failure to prepare the case for trial. The deficiencies may deprive the defendants of the ability to present a defense, and therefore, the court grants the motion to continue the trial and reopen discovery.

The trial will be continued from January 22, 2024, to May 22, 2024, and the final status conference will be continued from January 8, 2024, to May 8, 2024. The court will not grant any further continuances without a compelling showing of good cause.
