 Case Number:  20STCV27050    Hearing Date:   December 15, 2023    Dept:  28 Having
considered the moving papers, the Court rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On
July 20, 2020, Plaintiff Bridgette Stoval (“Plaintiff”) filed this action
against Defendants Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority,
City of Los Angeles (“City”), County of Los Angeles (“County”), and Does 1-50
for motor vehicle negligence and general negligence. 
On
December 24, 2020, the County filed an answer. 
On
January 21, 2021, Defendant Los Angeles County
Metropolitan Transportation Authority dba Metro (erroneously sued and
served as Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority) (“Metro”)
filed an answer. 
On
January 29, 2021, the Court dismissed the City without prejudice at Plaintiff’s
request. 
On
March 17, 2021, the Court dismissed the County without prejudice at Plaintiff’s
request. 
On
October 9, 2023, the Court granted Metro’s motion to reopen discovery for the limited
purpose of allowing Metro to conduct Plaintiff’s independent medical
examination.  The Court ordered that discovery
for this purpose would trail the then-current trial date of January 29, 2024. 
On
November 17, 2023, Metro filed a motion to continue the trial and final status
conference.  No opposition has been filed. 
Trial
is currently scheduled for January 29, 2024. 
PARTY’S REQUEST 
Metro
requests that the Court continue the trial and final status conference. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(b), provides that “a party seeking a continuance of
the date set for trial, whether contested or uncontested or stipulated to by
the parties, must make the request for a continuance by a noticed motion or an
ex parte application under the rules in chapter 4 of this division, with
supporting declarations. The party must make the motion or application as soon
as reasonably practical once the necessity for the continuance is discovered.” 
          Under
California Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(c), the Court may grant a continuance
only on an affirmative showing of good cause requiring the continuance.
Circumstances that may indicate good cause include “a party's excused inability
to obtain essential testimony, documents, or other material evidence despite
diligent efforts,” or the unavailability of a party, counsel, or expert due to
death, illness or other excusable circumstance. The Court should consider all
facts and circumstances relevant to the determination, such as proximity of the
trial date, prior continuances, prejudice suffered, whether all parties have
stipulated to a continuance, and whether the interests of justice are served.
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(d).) 

DISCUSSION 
Metro
requests that the Court continue the trial and final status conference because
Metro’s trial counsel cannot attend the trial scheduled for January 29, 2024 due
to ongoing treatment and recovery from serious injuries.  Metro has provided a supporting declaration.  Metro does not request that the Court
continue or reopen discovery to trail the new trial date. 
The
Court finds good cause and grants the motion. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court GRANTS Defendant Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority
dba Metro’s motion to continue the trial and final status conference.  The Court continues the trial from January 29,
2024, to August 1, 2024 at 8:30 a.m. in Department 28 of the Spring Street
Courthouse.   The Court continues the Final Status
Conference from January 17, 2024 to July 25, 2024, at 10:00 a.m. in Department
28 of the Spring Street Courthouse.
