The court notes that CCP § 473 does not apply to the instant dispute because
there is no judgment or order that the court need set aside due to mistake or
neglect. Instead, the dispute is whether the court may consider the FAC on its
merits or if it should dismiss the FAC because Plaintiffs filed it eight days
late.

In reply, Defendant argues that they were never served with the opposition for
either the demurrer or motion to strike. However, the proof of service attached
to the end of the memorandum in opposition states that on September 20, 2023,
Plaintiffs’ counsel served the documents to Defendant’s counsel via overnight
mail. The address on the proof of service matches the address Defendant’s
counsel uses on its caption. Also, Defendant’s timely reply brief and direct
argument against points Plaintiffs made in their opposition weigh against
finding prejudice, as Defendant asks the court to do. Accordingly, the court
disregards this argument.

The court notes that the other allegations of calling Plaintiff Stafford a “bad
guy” is unchanged from the original Complaint.


[4]In their Reply,
as to attorney fees, counsel indicates that it is based upon their Demurrer to
the fifth cause of action: violation of Penal Code § 496. This is puzzling, to say
the least, since the fifth cause of action alleges Slander/Defamation and not a
violation of Penal Code § 496.  Moreover,
 the Court previously denied the motion pointing
out that attorney fees are statutorily available for a successful prosecution
of the third cause of action, alleging a violation of Civil Code § 789.3.
