And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on the demurrer and motion to strike filed by Defendant Christine Fadley. The court has overruled the demurrer to the First Amended Complaint (FAC) in its entirety, finding that the FAC sufficiently states a cause of action for each of the nine causes of action alleged. The court has also denied the motion to strike, finding that the FAC is not untimely and that the court has already addressed the issues raised by the motion. The court has further denied the motion to strike on the grounds that the FAC was improperly added and insufficiently pled, finding that the FAC is not barred by the prior demurrer.
