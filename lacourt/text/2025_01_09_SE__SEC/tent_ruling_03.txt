 Case Number:  23NWCV01384    Hearing Date:   January 9, 2025    Dept:  SEC CONTRERAS v. ORTEGACASE NO.: 23NWCV01384HEARING: 01/09/25#3Plaintiff FRANK CONTRERAS’ Motion to Set Aside Dismissal is GRANTED.Moving Party to give notice.No Opposition(s) filed as of January 6, 2025.This personal injury action was filed by Plaintiff FRANK CONTRERAS (“Plaintiff”) against Defendants IRENE ORTEGA; VICTOR ORTEGA; and MARTHA VASQUEZ (collectively “Defendants”) on May 4, 2023.On November 15, 2023, Plaintiff’s Complaint was dismissed without prejudice because as of that date, Defendants had not been served with process of the Complaint. (See 11/15/23 M.O.)Plaintiff now moves to set aside the dismissal under CCP §473(b).“The court may, upon any terms as may be just, relieve a party or his or her legal representative from a judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken against him or her through his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.The policy of hearing cases on their merits is well-established. (See, e.g., Berman v. Klassman (1971) 17 Cal.App.3d 900.) Given the liberality associated with Motions to Set Aside under CCP §473(b), the Court finds the Declaration of Igor Fradkin sufficient to warrant to relief. The law favors trials on the merits. (Rappleyea v. Campbell (1994) 8 Cal.4th 975, 980.)Plaintiff to serve Defendants with the complaint within 30 days.
