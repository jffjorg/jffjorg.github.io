And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling granting Plaintiff Frank Contreras' motion to set aside the dismissal of his complaint. The complaint was originally dismissed without prejudice because the defendants had not been served with process. However, the court has found that the Declaration of Igor Fradkin is sufficient to warrant relief under CCP ยง473(b), which allows the court to relieve a party from a judgment or dismissal due to mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. The court finds that the law favors trials on the merits, and therefore grants the motion. The plaintiff is ordered to serve the defendants with the complaint within 30 days.
