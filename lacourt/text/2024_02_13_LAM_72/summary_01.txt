And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling granting summary judgment to the defendants, Richard Paulson, M.D., University of Southern California, and Keck School of Medicine of USC, in a medical malpractice action brought by plaintiffs Tamara Khachatryan and Edik Marcarian. The court finds that the statute of limitations has run, and that the defendants have met their burden of showing that there are no triable issues of material fact. The court notes that the plaintiffs had inquiry notice of a potential claim much sooner than the date of the alleged injury, and that the repeated requests for CAH tests demonstrate a knowledge that there was some necessity for one. The court concludes that the statute of limitations began running substantially sooner than the date that Dr. Paulson actually informed Khachatryan of her CAH diagnosis, and that the plaintiffs failed to file their action within the applicable time period.
