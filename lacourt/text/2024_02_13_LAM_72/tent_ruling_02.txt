Plaintiff Maya Khakhanashvili (“Plaintiff”) moves for an
award of attorney’s fees against Defendant 
 
The Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion as follows.
 
Defendant shall pay $36,895.26, comprised of $29,330.50 in
attorney’s fees and $7,564.76 in costs. 
Defendant shall make this payment to Plaintiff’s counsel within 30 days
of this order.
 
Background
 
This is a Song-Beverly Action. On July 27, 2023, the parties
agreed to settle this case when Plaintiff accepted Defendant’s July 27, 2023
offer to compromise under Code of Civil Procedure, section 998. The parties
settled for the amount of $162,420.00 in exchange for the surrender of the
subject vehicle. The settlement did not include attorney’s fees, costs or
expenses.
 
Evidentiary Objections
 
The Court overrules Plaintiff’s evidentiary objections.
 
Legal Standard
 
In General
 
A buyer who prevails in an action under the Song-Beverly Act
may recover their reasonable costs and expenses, attorney’s fees based on
actual time expended. (Civ. Code, § 1794.)
 
The lodestar method for calculating attorney fees applies to
any statutory attorney fees award, unless the statute authorizing the award
provides for another method of calculation. (Glaviano v. Sacramento City
Unified School Dist. (2018) 22 Cal.App.5th 744, 750-751.) “Under the
lodestar method, the trial court must first determine the lodestar figure—the
reasonable hours spent multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate—based on a
careful compilation of the time spent and reasonable hourly compensation of
each attorney involved in the presentation of the case.” (Id. at p.
751.) The lodestar figure may then be adjusted based on factors specific
to the case, which may include, without limitation, “(1) the novelty and
difficulty of the questions involved, (2) the skill displayed in presenting
them, (3) the extent to which the nature of the litigation precluded other
employment by the attorneys, (4) the contingent nature of the fee award.” (Warren,
supra, at p. 36 [internal quotations and citations omitted].)
 
The trial court has broad authority to determine the amount
of a reasonable fee. (PLCM Group, Inc. v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th
1084, 1095.)
 
The moving party bears the burden of proof as to
“reasonableness” of any fee claim. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (c)(5).)
The party seeking fees has the burden of documenting the appropriate hours
expended and hourly rates. (City of Colton v. Singletary (2012) 206
Cal.App.4th 751, 784.) This burden requires competent evidence as to the nature
and value of the services rendered. (Martino v. Denevi (1986) 182
Cal.App.3d 553, 559.) A plaintiff’s verified billing invoices are prima
facie evidence that the costs, expenses, and services listed were necessarily
incurred. (Hadley v. Krepel (1985) 167 Cal.App.3d 677, 682.) 
 
“In challenging attorney fees as excessive because too many
hours of work are claimed, it is the burden of the challenging party to point
to the specific items challenged, with a sufficient argument and citations to
the evidence. General arguments that fees claimed are excessive, duplicative,
or unrelated do not suffice.” (Lunada Biomedical v. Nunez (2014) 230
Cal.App.4th 459, 488, quoting Premier Med. Mgmt. Sys., Inc. v. California
Ins. Guarantee Ass’n (2008) 163 Cal.App.4th 550, 564.) When items are
properly objected to, the burden of proof is on the party claiming them as
costs. (Melnyk v. Robledo (1976) 64 Cal.App.3d 618, 623-624.)
 
 
Discussion
 
Attorney’s Fees
 
As an initial issue, Defendant argues that its section 998
offer cut off subsequently accrued attorney’s fees for Plaintiff. However,
because the final settlement far exceeded the offer, Plaintiff may obtain fees
for the intervening period.
 
Hourly Rate
 
Plaintiff requests a number of hourly rates ranging from
$225.00 to $550.00 for her attorneys at Knight Law Group, LLC. The Court finds
that these rates are reasonable in light of each attorney’s experience.
 
Hours
 
Plaintiff requests a lodestar amount of $43,147.50.  This amount is excessive.  Here, Plaintiff staffed a total of fourteen
attorneys on the case at various times.
 
“[J]ust as there can be too many cooks in a kitchen, there
can be too many lawyers on a case.” (Donahue v. Donahue (2010) 182
Cal.App.4th 259, 272 [internal quotation marks and citation omitted].) “Plainly,
it is appropriate for a trial court to reduce a fee award based on its
reasonable determination that a routine, noncomplex case was overstaffed to a
degree that significant inefficiencies and inflated fees resulted.” (Morris
v. Hyundai Motor America (2019) 41 Cal.App.5th 24, 39.) As noted by the
trial judge in Morris, “every time that somebody new to the file picks
the file up in order to do whatever the task is, there's a certain amount of
built-in startup [time].”
 
Although a majority of the hours were billed by just four
attorneys, with this level of staffing, it is inevitable that inefficiencies
will result. Lemon law cases can involve  complex technical issues, but there is nothing
anomalous about this case indicating that it is substantially more complex than
the average lemon law case. 
 
In such a case, a court may appropriately make an
across-the-board percentage cut in the hours claimed or the final lodestar
figure. (Morris v. Hyundai Motor America, supra, 41 Cal.App.5th
at p. 40.)  The Court here, however, has reviewed
the billing entries and made substantive determinations about which of the fees
are reasonable.
 
The Court awards all the hours expended by the four members
of the team  (Caitlin Rice, Elvira
Kamosko, Jacob Cutler, and Maxwell Kreymer) who Plaintiff identifies as
expending more than half of the hours on the matter.  Their fees total $21,063.50.  These fees appear generally reasonable,
particularly when the rest of the fees by the expanded team are appropriately
reduced.  
 
For the non-core team members, the Court awards a total of
$8,267.  The Court has awarded the time
entries where these non-core team members performed a clearly necessary task
and did so in a reasonable amount of time. 
However, there are many entries that do not provide sufficient
information as to whether the tasks were reasonable or provided value.  For example, many of these non-core team
members billed for “reviewing” certain documents without further explanation.  Their billing entries also include various
meetings.  The Court does not award such
fees for the non-core team members.
 
Thus, the Court awards a total of $29,330.50 in fees.
 
Lodestar Enhancement
 
There is nothing unusually complex or novel about this case
warranting a lodestar enhancement. The Court therefore does not grant one.
 
Costs
 
Plaintiffs provides a memorandum of costs, which the Court
deems reasonable, for the most part. The Court reduces $600.00 for a court
reporter for this hearing, as it does not know whether the parties will require
a court reporter at the upcoming hearing. 
If the parties disagree, the Court is willing to reconsider.
 
The Court awards $7,564.76 in costs.
