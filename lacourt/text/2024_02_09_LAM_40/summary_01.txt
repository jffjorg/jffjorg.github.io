```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied BMW's renewed motion for summary judgment or adjudication regarding the plaintiffs' first cause of action for breach of express warranty under the Song-Beverly Act. The court finds that the complaint's first cause of action does not limit itself to express warranty relief pursuant to Civil Code section 1793.2, and therefore, BMW's renewed motion, which challenges the complaint's first cause of action only insofar as it alleges a breach of express warranty for a new vehicle under the SBA, is fatally limited. The court also notes that even if evidence to the above effect had been attached to BMW's February 16, 2023 motion, the court would have still denied that motion for the reason discussed in the preceding paragraph. Additionally, the court determines that BMW's renewed motion is mooted by the plaintiffs' filing of a First Amended Complaint on January 10, 2024.
