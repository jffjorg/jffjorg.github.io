 [TENTATIVE] RULING RE:
Defendant The People
  of the State of California, acting by and through the Department of
  Transportation’s Demurrer to Complaint.



 
Background
Pleadings
Plaintiff Apex Development, Inc. (Apex) sues Defendant The People of the
State of California (the State), acting by and through the Department of
Transportation (erroneously sued as “California Department of Transportation, a
department of the State of California”)
and Does 1 through 20 pursuant to a December 1, 2023 Complaint alleging claims
of (1) Unjust Enrichment and (2) Intentional Interference with Contractual
Relations.
The claims arise from the following allegations. Apex rents multiple
airspace leases from the California Department of Transportation (CalTrans),
which are typically adjacent to freeway on-ramps or under elevated portions of
freeways, including a CalTrans lot located under the Interstate 10 freeway in
Los Angeles, California at the intersection of 14th Street and Lawrence, Los
Angeles 90021, subject an airspace lease [No. 07-LAX010-0012] (the Property). Apex
alleged that it invested $139,899 to improve the Property, including by
cleaning debris and other refuse from the Property, making repairs to the
Property due to CalTrans freeway retrofitting, making safety repairs to paving
and crack filler on the Property, and making repairs to the fence on the
Property. Apex reported these issues to CalTrans prior to making repairs, but
CalTrans failed to act and offered no contribution toward possible expenses,
forcing Apex to incur the above costs. Apex later requested restitution for its
expenses maintaining the Property, which CalTrans rejected. As a result, in May
2023, Apex filed a government claim. Shortly prior to this, in April 2023, as
alleged in the complaint, a CalTrans employee named “Daryll” entered the
Property without Apex’s permission and directed Apex’s tenants not to pay rent
to Apex. Apex complained of Darryll’s actions with CalTrans, which dismissed
Apex’s claims and continued to send Darryll and other employees to enter the
Property without notifying Apex and instructing Apex’s tenants to not pay rent
to Apex.
Motion Before the Court
On December 1, 2023, the State
filed a demurrer to the first and second causes of action based on sufficiency
of pleading.
On February 1, 2023, the State
filed a notice of no opposition by Plaintiff Apex.
The State’s demurrer is now before
the Court.
 
Request
for Judicial Notice
The Court declines to take judicial
notice of the lease between the parties as it is not material to the
disposition of the Court. (See Demurrer, RJN.)
 
Demurrer
Legal
Standard
A
demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the complaint states a cause of action.
(Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747; see Code Civ. Proc., §
430.10, subd. (e).) This device can be used only to challenge defects that
appear on the face of the pleading under attack or from matters outside the
pleading that are judicially noticeable. (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39
Cal.3d 311, 318.) To sufficiently allege a cause of action,
a complaint must allege all the ultimate
facts—that is, the facts needed to establish each element of the cause of
action pleaded. (Committee on Children’s Television, Inc. v. General Foods
Corp. (1983) 35 Cal.3d 197, 212, superseded by statute as stated in Branick
v. Downey Savings & Loan Assn. (2006) 39 Cal.4th 235, 242.)
Thus, “[t]o survive a [general] demurrer, the complaint need only allege facts
sufficient to state a cause of action; each evidentiary fact that might
eventually form part of the plaintiff’s proof need not be alleged.” (C.A. v.
William S. Hart Union High School Dist. (2012) 53 Cal.4th 861, 872.) In
testing the sufficiency of the cause of action, the demurrer admits the truth
of all material facts properly pleaded. (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital Dist.
(1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 966-67.) A demurrer, however, “does not admit
contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law.” (Daar v. Yellow Cab
Co. (1967) 67 Cal.2d 695, 713.) When considering demurrers, courts read the
allegations liberally and in context. (Taylor v. City of Los Angeles Dept.
of Water and Power (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1228, disapproved on other
grounds, Jones v. Lodge at Torrey Pines Partnership (2008) 42 Cal.4th
1158, 1162.) The face of the complaint includes exhibits attached to the
complaint. (Frantz v. Blackwell (1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 91, 94.) If facts
appearing in the exhibits contradict those alleged, the facts in the exhibits
take precedence. (Holland v. Morse Diesel Intern., Inc. (2001) 86
Cal.App.4th 1443, 1447, superseded by statute on other grounds as stated in White
v. Cridlebaugh (2009) 178 Cal.App.4th 506, 521.)
Demurrer,
Complaint, First and Second Causes of Action, Unjust Enrichment and Intentional
Interference with Contractual Relations: SUSTAINED, with leave to amend.
After
review, the Court SUSTAINS the State’s demurrer.
The
Court initially notes that the demurrer was served on Plaintiff Apex’s counsel
via email to the same email address appearing in the Complaint. (Demurrer,
Proof of Service [service by email to mdattaray@dattaraylaw.com]; cf.
Complaint, p. 1 [caption page containing same email address for Plaintiff’s
counsel].)
Despite
service, no opposition has been filed.
Moving
to the merits, the Court finds that as to both causes of action, the Complaint
fails to cite a statute permitting Apex to sue a public entity for unjust
enrichment or intentional interference with contractual relations. (See Demurrer,
pp. 4-5, 7-8.) “Except as otherwise provided by statute,” “[a] public entity is
not liable for an injury, whether such injury arises out of an act or omission
of the public entity or a public employee or any other person.” (Gov. Code, §
815, subd. (a).) A review of the Complaint shows that no statute is referenced.
Rather, the two counts stated in the Complaint are tort claims—and unjust
enrichment is not a claim at all, as discussed below. It therefore follows that
the Complaint’s claims are not sufficiently stated. This is particularly the
case where “to state a cause of action against a public entity, every fact
material to the existence of its statutory liability must be pleaded with
particularity” (Lopez v. Southern Cal. Rapid Transit Dist. (1985) 40
Cal.3d 780, 795, citations omitted), including the existence of a statutory
duty, where “[d]uty cannot be alleged simply by stating ‘defendant had a duty
under the law’; that is a conclusion of law, not an allegation of fact” (Searcey
v. Hemet Unified School Dist. (1986) 177 Cal.App.3d 792, 902, citations
omitted).
The
State’s demurrer is thus SUSTAINED.
The
Court gives Plaintiff Apex leave to amend to provide Plaintiff an opportunity
to plead the statutory bases, such as they exist, for the claims stated against
the State.
Last, the Court notes that insofar as an
amended pleading is filed, “[t]here is no cause of action in California labeled
‘unjust enrichment.’” (City of Oakland v. Oakland Raiders (2022) 83
Cal.App.5th 458, 477-478, citations omitted.) “‘Unjust enrichment is [simply] synonymous
with restitution. [Citation.]’” (Levine v. Blue Shield of California
(2010) 189 Cal.App.4th 1117, 1138, citation omitted.) Therefore, to the extent
there is an amended pleading, a restitution claim may be stated in place of the
unjust enrichment claim, but only if such claim can plead a statutory basis in
order to avoid the State’s section 815 argument, above. 

Conclusion
Defendant The People of the State
of California, acting by and through the Department of Transportation’s
Demurrer to Complaint is SUSTAINED, with leave to amend.
Plaintiff Apex Development, Inc.
SHALL file an amended pleading within 10 days of this order.
Failure to file an amended pleading
within 10 days may result in dismissal of the cause by way of ex parte
application. (Code Civ. Proc. § 581(f)(2); Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1320(h).)
