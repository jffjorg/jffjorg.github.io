And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has considered the demurrer filed by the State of California, acting by and through the Department of Transportation, to the first and second causes of action in the complaint filed by Apex Development, Inc. The demurrer alleges that the complaint fails to state a cause of action because it does not cite a statute permitting Apex to sue a public entity for unjust enrichment or intentional interference with contractual relations.

The Court sustains the demurrer and gives Apex leave to amend the complaint to provide the statutory basis for the claims stated against the State. The Court notes that unjust enrichment is not a claim in California and that any amended pleading must plead a statutory basis for the claim to avoid the State's section 815 argument.

The Court also notes that if an amended pleading is filed, the claim may be recharacterized as a restitution claim, but only if it can plead a statutory basis for the claim. The Court gives Apex 10 days to file an amended pleading and warns that failure to do so may result in dismissal of the cause by way of ex parte application.
