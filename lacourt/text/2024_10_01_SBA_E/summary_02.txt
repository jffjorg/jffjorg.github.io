And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the plaintiff's motion for judgment on the pleadings with leave to amend. The plaintiff, Ventura V. Ramos, Jr., has filed a complaint seeking to partition a single-family home located at 27840 Palos Verdes Drive East, Rancho Palos Verdes, California. The defendant, Myrna M. Ramos, has filed a verified answer admitting the ownership percentages of the property and acknowledging that the property cannot be physically divided.

The court has found that the plaintiff is entitled to partition as a matter of law. The defendant's admissions and failure to plead affirmative defenses, such as a waiver, waive her right to contest partition. The court has also granted the plaintiff's request for an interlocutory judgment, which will determine the interests of the parties.

The court has given the plaintiff 30 days to amend its pleading to conform to the facts as found by the court. The court has also appointed a referee, Darin DeRenzis, to market and sell the property, and has instructed the referee to issue a report to the court.

The court's decision is based on the following: the plaintiff has the right to partition as a matter of law, as the defendant has admitted joint tenancy ownership of the property and has failed to plead affirmative defenses; the plaintiff has shown that the property cannot be physically partitioned; and the defendant's admissions and failure to plead affirmative defenses waive her right to contest partition.
