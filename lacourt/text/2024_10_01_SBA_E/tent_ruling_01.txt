Plaintiff Shawn Choi filed a complaint against Defendants R&LS Investment
Inc., Richard Schulman, Michael Lease, Andrew Rowe, ADR Investment Group, LLC,
Dream Realty Asset Mgt., Kenneth Chung, and Ah Janice Jeong Lee, alleging (1)
Breach of Contract; (2) Breach of Fiduciary Duty; (3) Negligence; and (4)
Fraud.
 
            On March 13, 2024,
Cross-Complainants Andrew Rowe and ADR Investment Group, LLC, filed a
cross-complaint against Cross-Defendants R&LS Investment Inc. dba Keller
Williams Santa Monica, Richard Schulman, and Michael Lease, alleging (1)
indemnity; (2) contribution; and (3) negligence. 
 
            On March 20, 2024,

Lease, Andrew Rowe, and ADR Investment Group, LLC, alleging (1) equitable indemnity;
(2) contribution; and (3) declaratory relief. 
 
            On April 22, 2024,
Richard Schulman and Michael Lease filed the demurrer to the cross-complaint
filed by Andrew Rowe and ADR Investment Group, LLC.
 
 On
September 17, 2024, Cross-Complainants opposed. 
 
On September 23, 2024, Cross-Defendants

            On May 7, 2024, 2024,
Richard Schulman and Michael Lease (Cross-Defendants) filed the instant demurrer
to the cross-complaint filed by Dream Realty Asset Management, Kenneth Chung,
and Janice Jeong Ah Lee (Cross-Complainants.)
 
On September 17, 2024, Cross-Complainants
opposed.
 
On September 23, 2024, Cross-Defendants Dream
Realty Asset Management, Kenneth Chung, and Janice Jeong Ah Lee replied.
 
            The two demurrers are
set to be heard on October 1, 2024.
 
LEGAL STANDARD
 
A demurrer can be used only to challenge
defects that appear on the face of the pleading under attack or from matters
outside the pleading that are judicially noticeable. (Blank v. Kirwan
(1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) “To survive a demurrer, the complaint need only
allege facts sufficient to state a cause of action; each evidentiary fact that
might eventually form part of the plaintiff’s proof need not be alleged.” (C.A.
v. William S. Hart Union High School Dist. (2012)
53 Cal.4th 861, 872.) For the purpose of testing the sufficiency of
the cause of action, the demurrer admits the truth of all material facts
properly pleaded. (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital Dist. (1992) 2 Cal.4th
962, 966-967.) A demurrer “does not admit contentions, deductions or
conclusions of fact or law.” (Daar v. Yellow Cab Co. (1967) 67 Cal.2d
695, 713.)
 
A pleading is uncertain if it is ambiguous or
unintelligible. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (f).) A demurrer for
uncertainty may lie if the failure to label the parties and claims renders the
complaint so confusing defendant cannot tell what he or she is supposed to
respond to. (Williams v. Beechnut Nutrition Corp. (1986) 185 Cal.App.3d
135, 139, fn. 2.) However, “[a] demurrer for uncertainty is strictly construed,
even where a complaint is in some respects uncertain, because ambiguities can
be clarified under modern discovery procedures.” (Khoury v. Maly’s of
California, Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.)
 
DISCUSSION 
 
A.    Meet and Confer
 
Before filing a demurrer, “the demurring
party shall meet and confer in person or by telephone with the party who filed
the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the purpose of determining whether
an agreement can be reached that would resolve the objections to be raised in
the demurrer.” (Code
Civ. Proc., §
430.41 subd. (a).)
 
Cross-Defendants’ counsel provides a
declaration showing the parties’ meet and confer efforts and that they were
unable to informally resolve the dispute. (Hernandez Decl. ¶ 3-8.) The Court finds
this sufficient to satisfy the meet and confer requirement. 
 
B.    Indemnity
 
A cause of action for equitable
indemnity requires the following elements: (1) a showing of fault on the part
of the indemnitor and (2) resulting damages to the indemnitee for which the
indemnitor is contractually or equitably responsible. (CW Howe Partners v.
Mooradian (2019) 43 Cal.App.5th 688, 700.) 
 
“Although the body of law
defining and applying principles of equitable indemnity has not fully gelled
but is still evolving, one thing is clear: The doctrine applies only among
defendants who are jointly and severally liable to the plaintiff. As plaintiff
maintains, joint and several liability in the context of equitable indemnity is
fairly expansive. We agree it is not limited to ‘the old common term ‘joint
tortfeasor’ … .’ It can apply to acts that are concurrent or successive, joint
or several, as long as they create a detriment caused by several actors. One
factor is necessary, however. With limited exception, there must be some basis
for tort liability against the proposed indemnitor. Generally, it is based on a
duty owed to the underlying plaintiff, although vicarious liability and strict
liability also may sustain application of equitable indemnity. In addition,
implied contractual indemnity between the indemnitor and the indemnitee can
provide a basis for equitable indemnity.” (BFGC Architects Planners, Inc. v.
Forcum/Mackey Construction, Inc. (2004) 119 Cal. App. 4th 848, 852
(citations omitted).) 
 
Cross-Defendants
argue that Cross-Complainants have not established that the parties are joint
tortfeasors or jointly and severally liable for an indivisible injury.
(Demurrer p. 6.) Additionally, Cross-Defendants allege that the Cross-Complaint
fails to show any causal connection between Cross-Defendants' alleged actions
and the damages suffered by Plaintiff. (Demurrer p. 6.)
 
Furthermore,
Cross-Defendants argue that the original complaint against Cross-Defendants was
dismissed without prejudice, meaning no current claims exist against them,
removing the grounds for Cross-Complainants to seek indemnity. (Demurrer p. 7.)
Moreover, any potential negligence claim is barred by the statute of
limitations, which has already expired. (Demurrer p. 7; Code. Civ. Proc. § 335.1; Thomas v. Gilliland (2002) 95
Cal. App. 4th 427, 524.) Since the negligence claim was not refiled within the
prescribed timeframe, Cross-Complainants cannot pursue indemnity from
Cross-Defendants. As a result, Cross-Complainants have not sufficiently pled
facts to establish a valid cause of action for indemnity, and the court should
sustain the demurrer. (Opposition p. 7.)
 
In opposition,
Cross-Complainants argue that they have sufficiently pled facts supporting
their claim. (Opposition p. 2.) They allege that Cross-Defendants, as real
estate agents for the sellers of the property in question, failed to disclose a
death on the property, contributing to the plaintiff's damages.
Cross-Complaints state that parties do not need to be joint tortfeasors to
succeed on a claim of indemnity. (Time for Living v. Guy Hatfield Homes/All
Am. Dev. Co. (1991) 230 Cal.App.3d 30, 40.) The Cross-Complaint asserts
that Cross-Defendants’ failure to disclose relevant information about the
property contributed to the harm suffered by the plaintiff. (Opposition p. 3.)
Further, California law allows Cross-Complainants to seek indemnity from
Cross-Defendants, even if there is no pending claim against them, and the
statute of limitations for indemnity only begins after a settlement or
judgment, which has not occurred. (Opposition p. 3; Code
Civ. Proc., §
428.10 subd. (b).)
 
In reply, Cross
Defendants reiterate that Cross-Complainants have not shown that the parties
are joint tortfeasors because, in the complaint, Cross-Complainants make no
mention of themselves. (Reply p. 4.) Furthermore, Cross-defendants argue that
the parties are not joint tortfeasors because they had separate duties to
Plaintiff and, therefore, did not create the same harm. (Reply p. 3.)
 
A
cause of action for equitable indemnity requires the following elements: (1) a
showing of fault on the part of the indemnitor and (2) resulting damages to the
indemnitee for which the indemnitor is contractually or equitably responsible. (CW
Howe Partners, 43 Cal.App.5th 688, 700.) Paragraph 19 of the Cross
Complaint states, “Plaintiff has alleged certain injuries and damages because ROWE
and ADR, as well as R&LS and its real estate agents, LEASE and SCHULMAN,
failed to make certain disclosures (e.g., death which occurred at the Subject
Property), when the Subject Property was up for sale.” (Cross-Complaint ¶ 19.)
This allegation includes fault by both parties, failing to make certain
disclosure, which led to damages to Cross-Complainants, the lawsuit. Therefore,
Cross-Complaints
have pleaded sufficient facts to state a cause of action for indemnity. (See, CW
Howe Partners, 43 Cal.App.5th 688, 700.) 
 
Cross-defendants
argue that the parties are not joint tortfeasors, and thus, there is no claim
for indemnity. However, the Court has found that for indemnity cases, the term
joint tortfeasors is interpreted broadly to apply to “acts that are concurrent
or successive, joint or several, as long as they create a detriment caused by
several actors.” (BFGC Architects Planners, Inc, 119 Cal. App. 4th 848,
852.) Thus, Cross-Defendants argument fails because Cross-Complainants have
pleaded that both parties' acts, either concurrently or subsequently, have led
to Plaintiffs' damages. (See, BFGC Architects Planners, Inc, 119 Cal.
App. 4th 848, 852; Cross-Complaint ¶ 19.)
 
            Therefore, the court overrules the Demurrer as to the
claim of indemnity.
 
C.    Contribution
 
A cause of action for
contribution requires the following elements: (1) money judgment; (2) rendered
jointly against defendants; (3) in tort action; (4) application of equity
principles; (5) payment by tortfeasor of more than pro rata share; and (5) no intentional
injury by the tortfeasor. Code of Civ. Proc. Section §875.
(See also General Elec. Co. v. State of Cal. ex rel. Dept. Pub. Wks.¿(1973)
32 Cal.App.3d 918, 925.) 
 
            The Cross-Complainants have agreed to dismiss, without
prejudice, the cause of action for contribution.
 
            Therefore, the court sustains the demurrer as to the
claim of contribution with leave to amend.

A.    Meet and Confer
 
Before filing a demurrer, “the demurring
party shall meet and confer in person or by telephone with the party who filed
the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the purpose of determining whether
an agreement can be reached that would resolve the objections to be raised in

Cross-Defendants’ counsel provides a
declaration showing the parties’ meet and confers efforts and that they were
unable to informally resolve the dispute. (Hernandez Decl. ¶ 3-8.) The Court finds
this sufficient to satisfy the meet and confer requirement. 
 
B.    Indemnity
 
A cause of action for equitable
indemnity requires the following elements: (1) a showing of fault on the part
of the indemnitor and (2) resulting damages to the indemnitee for which the
indemnitor is contractually or equitably responsible. (CW Howe Partners v.
Mooradian (2019) 43 Cal.App.5th 688, 700.) 
 
“Although the body of law
defining and applying principles of equitable indemnity has not fully gelled
but is still evolving, one thing is clear: The doctrine applies only among
defendants who are jointly and severally liable to the plaintiff. As plaintiff
maintains, joint and several liability in the context of equitable indemnity is
fairly expansive. We agree it is not limited to ‘the old common term ‘joint

duty owed to the underlying plaintiff, although vicarious liability and strict
liability also may sustain application of equitable indemnity. In addition,
implied contractual indemnity between the indemnitor and the indemnitee can
provide a basis for equitable indemnity.” (BFGC Architects Planners, Inc. v.
Forcum/Mackey Construction, Inc. (2004) 119 Cal. App. 4th 848, 852
(citations omitted).) 
 
Cross-Defendants
argue that Cross-Complainants have failed to state a valid cause of action for
indemnity due to several key deficiencies. First, they assert that the
Cross-Complaint lacks any specific facts demonstrating fault on their part or
indicating that they caused any damages to Cross-Complainants. Instead, the
Cross-Complaint merely includes a vague, hypothetical statement that if
Cross-Complainants are held liable for damages, those damages were primarily
caused by Cross-Defendants. This conclusory assertion, according to
Cross-Defendants, is insufficient to establish fault or any actual damages at
this stage. (Demurrer p. 10.)
 
Second,
Cross-Defendants argue that Cross-Complainants have failed to establish that
both parties are joint tortfeasors, which is necessary for a claim of equitable
indemnity. For indemnity to apply, the parties must be jointly and severally
liable for an indivisible injury. (The Travelers Indemnity Co. of
Connecticut v. Navigators Specialty Ins. Co. (2021) 70 Cal.App.5th
341, 362.)  However, the Cross-Complaint
does not demonstrate how Cross-Defendants' actions are causally linked to the
same injury for which Cross-Complainants are being sued. Instead, it merely
asserts that if Plaintiff recovers damages, Cross-Complainants would be
entitled to indemnity, without detailing how Cross-Defendants' actions
contributed to the damages. (Demurrer p. 10-11.)
 
Third,
Cross-Defendants note that there are no pending claims against them, as
Plaintiff dismissed the underlying complaint against Cross-Defendants without
prejudice on January 11, 2024. Since no claims are currently pending,
Cross-Complainants lack grounds to seek indemnity. Furthermore, even if
Plaintiff were to refile the underlying complaint, the statute of limitations
for a negligence claim would have already expired—either two years after the
sale of the property on December 26, 2019, or two years after March 10, 2022,
when Plaintiff allegedly learned of the non-disclosure of deaths at the
property. Cross-Defendants argue that the statute of limitations continues to
run even after a claim is dismissed without prejudice, and therefore,
Cross-Complainants cannot rely on the possibility of a future refiling to seek
indemnity. (Demurrer p. 11-12; Thomas v. Gilliland (2002) 95 Cal.
App. 4th 427, 524.) 
 
In opposition,
Cross-Complainants argue that their indemnity claim is valid and timely under
California law, even though Cross-Defendants were dismissed from the original
lawsuit. They assert that a defendant can file a cross-complaint for indemnity
“against a concurrent tortfeasor for partial indemnity…even when such
concurrent tortfeasor has not been named as a defendant in the original
complaint.” (American Motorcycle Ass’n v. Superior Court of Los Angeles
County (1978) 20 Cal. 3d 578, 607; Opposition p. 7.) 
 
Cross-Complainants
argue that the dismissal of Cross-Defendants does not preclude their indemnity
claim, as there has been no court determination of a good faith settlement,
which would have otherwise cut off their right to seek indemnity. (Opposition
p. 7.) They maintain that the cross-complaint incorporates all relevant facts
from Plaintiff’s original complaint, including specific allegations against
Cross-Defendants. (Opposition p. 7.) Cross-Complainants also argue that they
acted on the advice of Cross-Defendants, disclosing what they were advised to
disclose during the real estate transaction. (Opposition p. 7.) Therefore, if
they are found liable for any errors or omissions, Cross-Defendants should be
responsible for indemnifying them since their advice allegedly contributed to
the situation. (Opposition p. 7.)
 
            In reply, Cross-Defendants argue that Cross-Complainants'
claim for indemnity fails because the Cross-Complaint lacks sufficient factual
allegations and fails to allege that Cross-Complainants and Cross-Defendants
are joint tortfeasors. (Reply p. 2.) 
 
Cross-Defendants
assert that the Cross-Complaint does not establish that Cross-Complainants and
Cross-Defendants are joint tortfeasors, a requirement for both indemnity and
contribution claims. While Cross-Complainants incorporate Plaintiff's original
complaint into their Cross-Complaint, this is insufficient because the duties
owed by Cross-Complainants (as sellers of the property) and Cross-Defendants
(as listing agents) are distinct and independent. (Reply p. 2.) They assert
that Cross-Complainants had a duty to disclose the deaths of the previous
owners, while Cross-Defendants, under California law, had a duty to conduct a
competent inspection and disclose any material facts revealed by that
inspection. Since these duties are separate, Cross-Complainants have not
adequately pled that both parties are joint and severally liable, as required
for indemnity. (Reply p. 2.)
 
Second,
Cross-Defendants contend that the Cross-Complaint fails to allege an
indivisible injury. Although the Cross-Complaint claims that damages were
caused by Cross-Defendants’ actions, it does not specify how both
Cross-Complainants and Cross-Defendants are liable for the same indivisible
injury to Plaintiff. The duties each owed to Plaintiff are different, and the
Cross-Complaint does not clarify how both parties’ conduct contributed to a
single, indivisible harm. (Reply p. 3.)
 
            The Court finds that Cross-Complainants have pleaded
specific facts that demonstrate fault on the part of Cross-Defendants. Cross-Complainants
incorporate the Complaint, which pleads that Cross-Defendants failed to notify
Plaintiffs of the violent death that occurred in the house and that the
Cross-Defendants were aware of the deaths and their duty to disclose such
facts. (Cross Complaint ¶ 10; Complaint ¶ 19, 28, 29.) Cross-Defendants argue
that these facts do not prove that Cross-Defendants are joint tortfeasors
because Cross-Complainants, as sellers of the house, and Cross-Defendants, as
listing agents, do not have the same duties. However, even if this argument is
correct, it is immaterial. A claim of indemnity may succeed as long as both
parties created the detriment, whether they are joint tortfeasors is inconsequential.
(BFGC Architects Planners, Inc., 119 Cal.App.4th 848, 852.) Defendants
also argue, without citing any authority, that Cross-Complainants and
Cross-Defendants are not liable for an indivisible injury as they have separate
duties to Plaintiff. However, all that is required for a finding of indemnity
is concurrent actions that cause harm to a third party. (BFGC Architects
Planners, Inc., 119 Cal.App.4th 848, 852.) Here, Cross-Complainant has
pleaded that both Cross-Complainant and Cross-Defendant concurrently failed to
disclose the previous deaths in the house, leading to harm to Plaintiff in the
form of negligence and fraud. (See, BFGC Architects Planners, Inc., 119
Cal.App.4th 848, 852; Cross Complaint ¶ 10; Complaint ¶ 19, 28, 29,48-58.)
 
            Therefore, the Court overrules the Demurrer as to the
claim of indemnity.
 
C.    Contribution
 
A cause of action for
contribution requires the following elements: (1) money judgment; (2) rendered
jointly against defendants; (3) in tort action; (4) application of equity
principles; (5) payment by tortfeasor of more than pro rata share; and (5) no intentional
injury by the tortfeasor. Code of Civ. Proc. Section §875.
(See also General Elec. Co. v. State of Cal. ex rel. Dept. Pub. Wks.¿(1973)
32 Cal.App.3d 918, 925.) 
 
Cross-Defendants
argue that Cross-Complainants have failed to state a valid cause of action for
contribution. They assert that equitable contribution involves recovering from
a co-obligor who shares liability, but the Cross-Complaint only makes a broad, conclusory
allegation that Cross-Defendants were partially responsible for Plaintiff’s
injuries without providing any specific facts demonstrating shared liability.
Cross-Defendants state that this lack of detail is detrimental as it fails to
establish that they are co-obligors with Cross-Complainants. (Demurrer p. 12.)
 
Furthermore,
Cross-Defendants contend that the claim for contribution is premature. Under
California law, a right to contribution arises only after a judgment has been
rendered that declares more than one party jointly liable. (Code of Civ. Proc.
Section § 875.) Since there has been no such judgment in this case,
Cross-Complainants cannot assert a valid claim for contribution at this stage. (Demurrer
p. 12.) Cross-Defendants also point out that Cross-Complainants have not
alleged that they paid more than their pro-rata share of any judgment, which is
required for a contribution claim. (Demurrer p. 12.)
 
            In opposition, Cross-Complainants argue that their
contribution claim is valid and authorized under California Civil Procedure
Code section 875. A contribution claim arises when one defendant has paid more
than their pro rata share of a judgment that is jointly rendered against
multiple defendants. Cross-Complainants contend that, even though
Cross-Defendants were dismissed, this does not bar the contribution claim, as
no court has found a good faith settlement that would eliminate their liability
for contribution. Civ. Pro. Code §877; (L.C. Rudd & Son, Inc. v.
Super. Ct., (1997) 60 Cal. Rptr. 2d 703.)
 
They argue that a
contribution claim can be filed against concurrent tortfeasors who were not
originally named in the plaintiff’s complaint. (American Motorcycle Ass’n,
20 Cal. 3d 578, 607) Under sections 428.10 and 428.20 of the Code of Civil
Procedure, additional parties may be joined in a cross-complaint, and
Cross-Complainants assert that all relevant facts were included in their
cross-complaint by incorporating Plaintiff’s original complaint, which was
attached as an exhibit. 
 
Furthermore,
Cross-Complainants argue that they relied on the advice of their agents and
brokers during the transaction and disclosed what they were advised to
disclose. As such, if they are found liable for any errors or omissions, they
believe that Cross-Defendants should share in the liability since it was the
advice of Cross-Defendants that led to the current situation. Therefore,
Cross-Complainants maintain that their contribution claim is valid and that
Cross-Defendants should be held jointly responsible if liability is imposed.
However, these statements are not pleaded in the Cross-Complaint. (Opposition
p. 8.)
 
            In reply, Cross-Defendants argue that Cross-Complainants'
claim for contribution fails because the Cross-Complaint lacks sufficient
factual allegations and fails to allege that Cross-Complainants and
Cross-Defendants are joint tortfeasors. (Reply p. 2.) 
 
Cross-Defendants
assert that the Cross-Complaint does not establish that Cross-Complainants and
Cross-Defendants are joint tortfeasors, a requirement for both indemnity and
contribution claims. While Cross-Complainants incorporate Plaintiff's original
complaint into their Cross-Complaint, this is insufficient because the duties
owed by Cross-Complainants, as sellers of the property, and Cross-Defendants, as
listing agents, are distinct and independent. (Reply p. 2.) Cross-Complainants
had a duty to disclose the deaths of the previous owners, while
Cross-Defendants, under California law, had a duty to conduct a competent
inspection and disclose any material facts revealed by that inspection. Since
these duties are separate, Cross-Complainants have not adequately pled that
both parties are joint and severally liable, as required for indemnity and
contribution. (Reply p. 2.)
 
            The Court finds that Cross-Complainants’ claim for
contribution is untimely. A right to contribution can exist only after the
rendition of a judgment declaring more than one defendant jointly liable to the
plaintiff. (Coca-Cola Bottling Co. v. Lucky Stores, Inc. (1992) 11
Cal.App.4th 1372, 1378; Code Civ. Proc., § 875, subd. (c).) In the
Cross-Complaint, Cross-Complainants state that if Cross-Complainants are held
liable, then Cross-Dependents are obligated to contribute to the extent the
Court finds them at fault. (Cross-Complaint ¶ 17.) Since a judgment has not
been rendered in this matter, no contribution can be sought. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 875, subd. (c).) Therefore, Cross-Complainants have not pleaded facts
sufficient to sustain a cause of action for contribution.
            
The Demurrer is sustained
with leave to amend as to the cause of action of contribution.
 
D.    Negligence
 
“The elements of a negligence cause of action are
duty, breach, causation, and damages.” (County of
Santa Clara v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2006) 137 Cal.App.4th 292, 318.)¿ “Ordinarily, negligence may be
alleged in general terms, without specific facts showing how the injury
occurred, but there are limits to the generality with which a plaintiff is
permitted to state his cause of action, and the plaintiff must indicate the acts
or omissions which are said to have been negligently performed. He may not
recover upon the bare statement that the defendant’s negligence has caused him
injury.” (Berkley v. Dowds (2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 518, 527 [Internal
quotations and ellipses omitted].) “However, there is no requirement that
plaintiff identify and allege the precise moment of the injury or the exact
nature of the wrongful act.” (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740,
747 [internal brackets omitted].) 
 
Cross-Defendants
argue that Cross-Complainants have failed to properly state a cause of action
for negligence. They outline that a valid negligence claim requires showing
duty, breach, causation, and damages, but Cross-Complainants have not
sufficiently established these elements. While negligence can often be pleaded
in general terms, Cross-Defendants emphasize that Cross-Complainants have not
identified any specific "common law duties" that Cross-Defendants
owed them, nor have they detailed how these duties were breached. (Demurrer p.
14) The allegations are described as vague and conclusory, lacking the
necessary specifics to support a claim for negligence. (Demurrer p.14.)
 
Additionally,
Cross-Defendants argue that the statute of limitations for bringing a
negligence claim has expired. Under California law, negligence claims must be
filed within two years of the incident. (Cal. Code. Civ. Proc. § 335.1.)  Cross-Defendants assert that the
relevant "incident" occurred either on December 2, 2018, when
Cross-Complainants purchased the property with knowledge of the previous
owners' deaths, or on December 26, 2019, when Cross-Complainants sold the
property to the Plaintiff. (Demurrer p. 14.) Since the Cross-Complaint was not
filed until March 12, 2024, Cross-Defendants contend that the two-year statute
of limitations had already expired by December 26, 2021, making the negligence
claim untimely. (Demurrer p. 14.)
 
In opposition, Cross-Complainants
argue that the negligence claim should not be dismissed based on the statute of
limitations, as the Demurrer does not clearly establish when the statute began
to accrue. (Opposition p. 8.) They assert that this lack of clarity is
problematic because the defense must be apparent from the face of the
complaint. Even if the negligence claim is barred by the two-year statute of
limitations under Civil Code Section 2079.4, Cross-Complainants propose an
alternative solution: amending the claim to assert a breach of fiduciary duty.
(Opposition p. 8.)
 
A breach of
fiduciary duty claim is not subject to the two-year statute of limitations
under Civil Code Section 2079.4 and is governed by the delayed discovery rule.
(Opposition p. 9.) This rule delays the claim's accrual until the plaintiff
becomes aware of the injury and its negligent cause. Cross-Complainants argue
that they had no reason to suspect a disclosure problem until they were sued by
Plaintiff on April 3, 2023. (Opposition p. 9.) They assert that any failure to
disclose the deaths at the property resulted from the advice given by
Cross-Defendants, and a breach of fiduciary duty would cover this type of error
or omission. (Opposition p. 9.)
 
            Here, the Court finds that the negligence claim is
untimely. Cross-Complainants argue that Cross-Defendants fail to show that
there is a defect on the face of the pleading regarding the statute of
limitations as they do not state when it began to run. However, Cross-Defendants
show that whether the statute of limitations began to run on Dec 2, 2018, when
the house was sold, or on December 26, 2019, is immaterial as the instant cross-complaint
was not filed until March 12, 2024, long after the statute has expired for both
dates.
(Cal. Code. Civ. Proc. § 335.1.) Cross-complaints acknowledge the issue and
ask for leave to amend. (Opposition p. 8.)
 
            Therefore, the Demurrer is sustained as to the cause of
action of negligence with leave to amend.
