To date, no reply has been filed.
 
Trial is set for May 6, 2025.
 
LEGAL STANDARD
 
Judgment on the Pleadings 
 
A defendant may move for judgment on the
pleadings where the court has no jurisdiction over the subject of the cause of
action alleged in the complaint or the complaint does not state facts
sufficient to constitute a cause of action against that defendant. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 438 subd. (c)(1)(B).) A motion for judgment on the pleadings is
analogous to a general demurrer. (Lance Camper Mfg. Corp. v. Republic
Indemnity Co. of Am. (1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 194, 198.) Like demurrers,
motions for judgment on the pleadings challenge the legal sufficiency of the
allegations, not their veracity. (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004)
116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.)¿¿“The motion provided for in this section may be
made as to either of the following: (A) The entire complaint or cross-complaint
or as to any of the causes of action stated therein. (B) The entire answer or
one or more of the affirmative defenses outlined in the answer.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 438 subd. (c)(2).) “The motion provided for in this section may be
granted with or without leave to file an amended complaint or answer, as the
case may be.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 438 subd. (h)(1).) All facts alleged in the
complaint are deemed admitted, and the complaint is given a reasonable
interpretation as a whole and all parts in their context. (Lance, 44
Cal.App.4th at p. 198.) The court does not, however, do so for “conclusions of
law or fact, opinions, speculation, or allegations contrary to law or
[judicially noticed] facts.” (Stevenson Real Estate Servs., Inc. v. CB
Richard Ellis Real Estate Servs., Inc. (2006) 138 Cal.App.4th 1215,
1219-20.)¿ Any defects must either appear on the face of the pleading, or else
be taken by judicial notice. (Bezirdjian v. O'Reilly (2010) 183
Cal.App.4th 316, 321-22.) A motion for judgment on the pleadings may be granted
when, “under the state of the pleadings, together with matters that may be
judicially noticed, it appears that a party is entitled to judgment as a matter
of law.” (Southern California Edison Co. v. City of Victorville (2013)
217 Cal.App.4th 218, 227.) If a motion for judgment on the pleadings is
granted, leave to amend “should be granted if there is any reasonable
possibility that the plaintiff can state a good cause of action.” (Virginia
G. v. ABC Unified School Dist.¿(1993) 15 Cal.App.4th 1848, 1852.)¿ 
 
Right to Partition
 
Under Code of Civil Procedure section 872.710,
for purposes of determining the right of partition, the court must first
determine whether the plaintiff has the right to partition the property. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 872.710.)  Partition of
concurrent interests is generally a right unless there is a valid waiver. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 872.710.)  For successive
estates, partition is allowed if it benefits all parties involved. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 872.710.)  The court will
consider factors such as the financial burdens of taxes or repairs, changes in
the property’s character or circumstances, and the original intent behind
creating the successive estates, weighing these factors in light of equity and
the interests of the current owners. (Code Civ. Proc., § 872.710.) 
 
REQUEST FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE
 
The Court may take judicial notice of records
of (1) any court of this state or (2) any court of record of the United States
or of any state of the United States. (Evid. Code § 452 subd. (d).) The Court
may also take judicial notice of “[f]acts and propositions that are not
reasonably subject to dispute and are capable of immediate and accurate
determination by resort to sources of reasonably indisputable accuracy.” (Evid.
Code § 452 subd. (h).) 
 
            Here, Plaintiff
requests that the court take judicial notice of the Complaint, Verified Answer,
Requests for Admission, and the Response to the Request for Admissions. Defendant
raised no opposition to the request.
 
            The Court takes
judicial notice of the Complaint, Verified Answer, Requests for Admission, and
the Response to the Request for Admissions. 
 
DISCUSSION 
 
A.    Meet and Confer
 
Before
filing a motion for judgment on the pleadings, the moving party must meet and
confer, in person or by telephone, with the party who filed the pleading
subject to the motion, to determine if an agreement can be reached that
resolves the claims to be raised in the motion. (Code Civ. Proc., § 439 subd. (a).)
The moving party must file a declaration stating either the means by which the
moving party met and conferred with the party who filed the pleading, and that
the parties did not reach an agreement resolving the claims, or that the party
who filed the pleading failed to respond to the meet and confer request or
failed to meet and confer in good faith. (Code Civ. Proc., § 439 subd. (a)(3).)¿ 
 
Plaintiff’s counsel’ declares that on May 31, 2024, she met and
conferred with Defendant’s counsel over the phone, where she identified all the
specific allegations that she believed were subject to judgment and identified
with legal support the basis of the claim. (Sikavi Decl. ¶ 10.) The parties
were unable to informally resolve the disputes. (Id. ¶ 11.) The Court finds this sufficient to
satisfy the meet and confer requirement. 
 
B.    Judgment on the Pleadings
 
This lawsuit
involves a partition action for a single-family home located at 27840 Palos
Verdes Drive East, Rancho Palos Verdes, California. Plaintiff seeks an
interlocutory order to confirm the ownership interests of the parties, appoint
a referee, Darin DeRenzis, to market and sell the property, and issue
instructions to the referee. An interlocutory order must address three key
issues: (1) the plaintiff’s right to partition, (2) the parties’ interests in
the property, and (3) the manner of partition. (Code Civ. Proc., § 872.720.) 
 
After Plaintiff
filed a verified Complaint, Defendant filed the verified Answer, admitting the
ownership percentages of the property and acknowledging that the property
cannot be physically divided. (Answer ¶ 3-4.) In response to Requests for
Admissions, Defendant confirmed the joint tenancy and the parties’ ownership
interests. (Plaintiff Request for Judicial Notice, Exhibit 4 p. 2.) Plaintiff
asserts that this establishes that (1) Plaintiff is an owner with the right to
partition, (2) Defendant’s admissions conclusively determine the parties’
interests, and (3) the property cannot be physically partitioned. Therefore, each
element of section 872.720 is satisfied, and an interlocutory judgment is
appropriate. Plaintiff previously filed a motion for interlocutory judgment in
March 2024, which was denied without prejudice for procedural reasons. After
further meet-and-confer efforts with Defendant’s counsel, the parties could not
reach an agreement, leading to this renewed motion. (Sikavi Decl. ¶ 10.) Plaintiff
now requests that the Court approve the sale of the property, with final
approval subject to a noticed motion under Code of Civil Procedure section
873.720.
 
On the onset, Plaintiff
argues the instant motion is procedurally proper because the prior motion was
denied without prejudice, allowing him to refile. “Denial of motion without
prejudice impliedly invites the moving party to renew the motion at a later
date, when he can correct the deficiency that led to the denial, so Code of
Civil Procedure section 1008 is inapplicable.” (Farber v. Bay View Terrace
Homeowners Assn’ (2006) 141 Cal.App.4th 1007, 1015.) 
 
As to the merits, Plaintiff
argues that Defendant has made several admissions that are conclusive under
Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.410(a). Specifically, in the verified
answer, Defendant stated that both Plaintiff and Defendant each own a 50%
undivided joint tenant interest in the property and that Defendant does not
oppose the sale. (Answer ¶ 3, 4.) Additionally, Defendant admitted through
Requests for Admissions that Plaintiff is a rightful owner (RFA No. 2), that
the parties are joint tenants (RFA No. 3), and that Plaintiff owns 50% of the
property. (RFA No. 4.) Based on these admissions, Plaintiff claims he has the
right to judgment on the pleadings as the parties are co-owners, Plaintiff has
the right to partition the property, and the property is not subject to
physical partition. Moreover, Plaintiff points out that Defendant failed to
plead any affirmative defenses, specifically the waiver defense, which is the
only defense against a partition action under Code of Civil Procedure section
872.710. As a result, Plaintiff asserts that Defendant has waived the right to
raise any defenses. Plaintiff states he is entitled to an interlocutory
judgment as a matter of law. (Code Civ. Proc, § 872.720 (“If the court finds
that the plaintiff is entitled to partition, it shall make an interlocutory
judgment that determines the interests of the parties…”).). 
 
In opposition, Defendant
argues that a motion for judgment on the pleadings is not the appropriate
mechanism to obtain an interlocutory judgment in a partition action. Section
872.710(a) provides: “At the trial, the court shall determine whether the
plaintiff has the right to partition.” No partition can be had until the
interests of all the parties have been ascertained and settled by trial. (Bacon
v. Wahrhaftig (1950) 97 Cal.App.2d 599, 603.) It is only after the Court
determines a party’s right to partition, that an interlocutory judgment may
enter. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 872.720(a).) However, the instant case is
distinguishable from Bacon. Unlike in Bacon, where one
of the main issues was the misjoinder of parties and whether all parties who
had an interest in the property had been ascertained, leading to procedural
complications, here there is no question about the right to partition, as both
Plaintiff and Defendant have admitted joint tenancy ownership of the property.
(Bacon 97 Cal.App.2d, at p. 604; Answer ¶ 3, 4.; RFA No. 2-3.) 
Furthermore, Defendant
contends that extrinsic evidence is necessary to show that the intent behind
the property’s title was not to create a true joint tenancy, as Plaintiff
contributed nothing to the purchase price, and Defendant paid for all taxes,
insurance, and maintenance. (Opposition p. 4.) Defendant further argues that
despite the property being held in joint tenancy, this does not automatically
reflect the parties’ actual interests, particularly given the financial
contributions made solely by Defendant. 
Defendant emphasizes that joint tenancy does not prevent courts from
considering differing contributions in determining the true ownership
interests. (Milian v. De Leon (1986) 181 Cal.App.3d 1185.) Defendant asserts
that her intention was for Plaintiff to inherit the property upon her death,
not for them to share ownership or responsibilities during her lifetime.
(Opposition p. 5.) Lastly, Defendant requests that if the Court grants the
motion for judgment on the pleadings, she should be given leave to amend her
answer, as it may have been imperfectly pleaded. (Opposition p. 6.) 
 
In reply,
Plaintiffs argue that although a joint tenancy deed is not conclusive of the
nature of ownership, it does create a rebuttable presumption that the property
is held in joint tenancy. (Clark v Carter (1968) 265 Cal.App.2d 291,
294-295.) And that, the presumption created by a deed can only be overcome by
showing a common understanding or an agreement that the property was not meant
to be held in joint tenancy. (Donovan v. Donovan (1963) 223 Cal.App.2d
691, 698.) Furthermore, the presumption cannot be rebutted merely by showing
the source of the funds used to acquire the property. (Beck v. Beck (1966)
242 Cal.App.2d 396, 408.)
 
 The Court finds that Defendant’s Answer and
responses to Defendant's request for admissions, and Defendant’s failure to
plead any affirmative defenses, such as a waiver, waives her right to contest
partition, as Code of Civil Procedure section 872.710 grants an absolute right
to partition absent a valid defense. (Code Civ. Proc., § 872.710.) Defendant
has shown that extrinsic evidence may be used to show that a joint tenancy has
not been created or that the joint tenancy does not reflect the true interests
in the property. (Milian, 181 Cal.App.3d at p. 1191-1195; Cosier v. Norwood, 97
Cal.App.2d 665, 666.) However, here, unlike in Milian, where there was a
dispute over whether a joint tenancy had been created, Defendant has admitted
that Plaintiff owns 50% of the property as a joint tenant and, therefore,
cannot now argue that a joint tenancy was not created. (See, Milian, 181
Cal.App.3d at p. 1195; Barsegian v. Kessler & Kessler (2013) 215
Cal.App.4th 446, 451; RFP’s No. 2-3) Nor can Defendant argue that the joint
tenancy does not reflect the true ownership of the parties. (See, Milian,
181 Cal.App.3d at 1195; Barsegian, 215 Cal.App.4th at p. 451; RFP’s No.
2-3) Therefore, based on Defendant’s admissions and the absence of a waiver
defense, Plaintiff is entitled to partition as a matter of law. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 872.710. Priddel v. Shankie (1945) 69 Cal.App.2d 319, 325.) (finding
that once a party seeking partition is shown to be an owner of the property,
the right of partition is absolute.)
 
C.    Leave to Amend
 
            CCP §473(a) permits the Court to grant leave to a party
to amend a pleading. The Court’s discretion regarding granting leave to amend
is usually exercised liberally to permit amendment of pleadings. (Nestle v.
Santa Monica (1972) 6 Cal.3d 920, 939.) If a party “has a good cause of
action, which by accident or mistake he has failed to set out in his complaint,
the court, on motion for judgment on the pleadings, should, on his application
so to do, permit him to amend.” (MacIsaac v. Pozzo (1945) 26 Cal.2d 809,
815.)
 
Therefore, the
Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion for judgment on the pleadings WITH LEAVE TO AMEND
within 30 days.
