And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge William A. Crowfoot regarding a motion filed by Paul Krantz, Esq. to be relieved as counsel of record for defendant Everson Bozeman. The motion is based on a breakdown in communication between the attorney and the defendant. The court has reviewed the motion and notes that trial is set for September 30, 2024, and no prejudice will result from granting the motion. However, the proposed order fails to include Bozeman's telephone number, so the hearing is continued to allow counsel to file a revised proposed order.
