Here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to strike paragraphs 26, 37, and the prayer for punitive damages from the complaint filed by the plaintiffs. The motion was filed by the defendant, Beador Construction Company, Inc., arguing that the plaintiffs fail to plead a factual basis for punitive damages. The judge has granted the motion, finding that the plaintiffs' allegations of gross negligence and malice are conclusory and vague, and do not provide a sufficient factual basis for a prima facie claim for punitive damages. The judge has also noted that the plaintiffs failed to identify any conduct by an officer, director, or managing agent of the defendant, which is required for a corporate defendant to be liable for punitive damages. The judge has denied the plaintiffs' request to amend the complaint, but has given them permission to file a motion for leave to file an amended complaint if they discover evidence that supports a prayer for punitive damages during the discovery process.
