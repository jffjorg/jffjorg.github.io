[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER RE: MOTION TO BE RELIEVED 
 
Dept.
  3
8:30
  a.m.
March 6,

Paul
 Krantz, Esq. seeks to be relieved as counsel of record for defendant/cross-defendant
 Everson Bozeman (“Bozeman”) on grounds that there has
 been a breakdown in communication. Absent a showing of resulting
prejudice, an attorney’s request for withdrawal should be granted. (People
v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398, 406.) 
Counsel’s Motion complies with California
Rules of Court, Rule 3.1362. The Court notes that trial in this matter is set
for September 30, 2024 and no prejudice will result from granting this motion. However,
the proposed order fails to include Bozeman’s telephone number in Item 6. Accordingly,
the hearing on this unopposed motion to be relieved is continued to _____ so
that counsel may file a revised proposed order. The revised proposed order
should be submitted no later than 5 days before the date of the hearing. 
Moving party to give notice.
 
Dated
this 6th
day of March 2024
