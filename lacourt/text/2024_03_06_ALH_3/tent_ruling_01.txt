          On December
18, 2023, plaintiffs Eric A. Ferraco and Andrea V. Ferraco, as Co-Trustees of
the Ferraco Family Trust dated 4/19/2000 (“Ferraco Trust”), filed this motion
for attorneys’ fees. Ferraco Trust seeks an award of attorneys’ fees in the
amount of $715,849.50 and total expenses in the amount of $53,380.84 (including
some that were also claimed in the Memorandum of Costs filed on November 2,
2023) against Defendant Human Designs Prosthetic and Orthotic Laboratory, Inc.
(“Human Designs”). The motion is unopposed. 
Unless they are specifically provided
for by statute (e.g., Code Civ. Proc. §§ 1032, et seq.), an award of attorneys’
fees is left to the agreement of the parties. (Code Civ. Proc. § 1021.) The
prevailing party on a contract, which specifically provides for attorney fees
and costs incurred to enforce the agreement, is entitled to reasonable attorney
fees in addition to other costs.  (Civ.
Code § 1717(a); CCP §§ 1032, 1033.5(a)(10)(A).) The court, upon notice and motion
by a party, shall determine the prevailing party and shall fix, as an element
of the costs of suit, the reasonable attorney fees.  (Civ. Code § 1717(a), (b).) 
“It is well established that the
determination of what constitutes reasonable attorney fees is committed to the
discretion of the trial court, whose decision cannot be reversed in the absence
of an abuse of discretion.” (Melnyk v. Robledo (1976) 64 Cal.App.3d 618,
623-624.)  The fee setting inquiry in
California ordinarily “begins with the ‘lodestar’ [method], i.e., the number of
hours reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate.”  (Graciano v. Robinson Ford Sales, Inc. (2006)
144 Cal.App.4th 140, 154.) The lodestar figure may then be adjusted, based on
consideration of factors specific to the case, in order to fix the fee at the
fair market value for the legal services provided. (See Serrano v. Priest
(1977) 20 Cal.3d 25, 49 (discussing factors relevant to proper attorneys’ fees
award).) The factors considered in determining the modification of the lodestar
include “(1) the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, (2) the
skill displayed in presenting them, (3) the extent to which the nature of the
litigation precluded other employment by the attorneys, and (4) the contingent
nature of the fee award.” (Mountjoy v. Bank of Am. (2016) 245
Cal.App.4th 266, 271.) In challenging attorneys’ fees as excessive because too
many hours of work are claimed, it is the burden of the challenging party to
point to the specific items challenged, with a sufficient argument and
citations to the evidence. (Premier Medical Management Systems, Inc. v.
California Ins. Guaranty Assoc. (2008) 163 Cal.App.4th 550, 564.) General
arguments that fees claimed are excessive, duplicative, or unrelated do not
suffice. (Ibid.) 
The prevailing party who seeks fees and
costs bears the burden of establishing entitlement to an award and documenting
the appropriate hours expended and hourly rates. (Cristian Research v. Alnor
(2008) 165 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1320.) To that end the Court may require a party
to produce records sufficient to provide a proper basis for determining how
much time was spent on particular claims. (Ibid.) The evidence should
allow the Court to consider whether the case was overstaffed, how much time
attorneys spent on particular claims, and whether the hours were reasonably
expended. (Id.) The Court has discretion to award fees based on the
attorney’s declaration describing the work they have done and based on the
judge’s own view of the number of hours reasonably spent. (Syers Props. III,
Inc. v. Rankin (2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 691, 698.)
Ferraco Trust’s entitlement to
attorneys’ fees is based on Paragraph 31 of the leases underlying the action, which
entitle the prevailing party to be “fully reimburse[d] [for] all attorneys’
fees reasonably incurred.” (Exhibits 1 & 2) Paragraph 31 provides in
pertinent part: “If any Party brings an action or proceeding involving the
Premises whether founded in tort, contract or equity, or to declare rights
hereunder, the Prevailing Party (as hereafter defined) in any such proceeding,
action, or appeal thereon, shall be entitled to reasonable attorneys’ fees. * *
* The attorneys’ fees award shall not be computed in accordance with any court
fee schedule, but shall be such as to fully reimburse all attorneys’ fees
reasonably incurred.” 
Ferraco Trust argues that its request
for fees is reasonable and submits the declaration Eric S. Engel to describe
the work performed by the attorneys, paralegals and professional staff of
Conkle, Kremer & Engel, PLC (“CK&E”). Mr. Engel authenticates two
spreadsheets which contain time entries and states that nearly all the fees were
incurred through work by himself, Chelsea Bernard, Alex Engel, and Bill Ye. Mr.
Engel states that his hourly rate during this litigation began at $525 and increased
to $550 in 2022. (Engels Decl., ¶ 19.) Although Mr. Engel’s standard rate in
2023 was increased to $575, this increase was not applied to this matter. Mr. Engel
has been licensed to practice law since 1982 and his practice focuses on
complex business litigation matters. (Engels Decl., ¶ 19.) Chelsea Bernard performed
a considerable amount of work as a law clerk beginning in June 2020 at an
hourly rate of $200 and her rate increased to $325 after she was admitted to
the California bar in May 2022. (Engel Decl. ¶ 20.) Alex Engel and Bill Ye are
paralegals who billed at a rate of $150, which is CK&E’s standard paralegal
rate, and provided paralegal support by assisting with document production,
exhibits, damages analyses, deposition support, and information organization. (Engel
Decl. ¶¶ 21-22.) Based on the cases cited by counsel as well as the Court’s
experience, the Court finds that these rates are commensurate with (if not
lower than) the prevailing rates in California and the Los Angeles area. (Motion,
p. 17.) The Court has also reviewed Exhibit A attached to Mr. Engel’s
declaration, which is a spreadsheet which sorts CK&E’s billing records into
different categories, from pre-trial investigation through post-trial activity.
Exhibit B is a chronological account of the billing entries sent by CK&E to
Ferraco Trust. Based on these spreadsheets, which the Court will not summarize
in this minute order for purposes of judicial efficiency, as well as the lack
of any opposition from Human Designs, the Court finds that the amount of time
spent on spent on the matter was reasonable. Accordingly, the request for fees
is GRANTED in its entirety. 
As for Ferraco Trust’s request for costs
as the prevailing party pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1032, Ferraco
Trust filed a memorandum of costs and included additional items in this motion
in Exhibit C. “‘If the items appearing in a cost bill appear to be proper
charges, the burden is on the party seeking to tax costs to show that they were
not reasonable or necessary.’” (Nelson v. Anderson (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th
111, 131.) The Court notes that no motion to tax costs is on file and the
charges on the memorandum of costs appear appropriate. However, Ferraco Trust lists
additional items in Exhibit C which were not included in the memorandum of
costs, some of which are impermissible. For example, Ferraco Trust is not
entitled to costs for photocopying and postage; therefore, the request for fees
incurred for document reproduction, postage, and accessing documents online are
not allowed. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5(b)(3); Ripley v.
Pappadopoulos (1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 1616, 1627-28.) Additionally, the only
travel expenses authorized by Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5 are those
to attend depositions. (Code Civ. Proc. § 1033.5 (a)(3); Ladas v. California
State Auto. Assn. (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 761, 775-776.) Routine expenses for
local travel not related to depositions, including parking fees, mileage, and
cab fare, by attorneys or other firm employees are not reasonably necessary to
the conduct of litigation. (Id.) Therefore, Ferraco Trust cannot recover
$80.37 for local travel and parking charges to attend a final status
conference. A charge of $11.31 for TollFreeConferenceCall.com will also not be
allowed because it does not appear to be reasonably necessary to the conduct of
litigation.  
Accordingly, the Court awards
$50,787.64 in costs as claimed on Ferraco Trust’s memorandum of costs. Pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5(c)(4) the Court exercises its
discretion to award $2,000 for mediation fees, $15.00 for a LACourtConnect fee
to appear at a case management conference telephonically, and $14.63 for the
filing fee associated with the proposed statement of decision, as listed in
Exhibit C to the Engels Declaration, for a total cost award of $52,817.27.
In conclusion, Ferraco Trust’s motion
for attorneys’ fees and costs is GRANTED. Ferraco Trust is awarded its
reasonable attorneys’ fees in the amount of $715,849.50 and its costs in the
amount of $52,817.27.
