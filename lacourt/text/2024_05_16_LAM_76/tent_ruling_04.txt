ANALYSIS
Motion For Leave To File Amended Complaint
Discussion
“Leave to amend is in general required to be
liberally granted (citation omitted), provided there is no statute of
limitations concern. Leave to amend may be denied if there is prejudice to the
opposing party, such as delay in trial, loss of critical evidence, or added
costs of preparation. (Citation omitted.)” 
(Kolani v. Gluska (1998) 64
Cal.App.4th 402.)  Where an additional theory of liability is proposed against an existing
defendant, this is not prejudice which would justify the denial of leave to
amend. (See Hirsa v. Superior
Court (1981) 118 Cal.App.3d 486, 490. See
also Atkinson v. Elk Corp.
(2003) 109 Cal.App.4th 739, 761: “[I]t is irrelevant
that new legal theories are introduced as long as the proposed amendments
'relate to the same general set of facts.' [Citation.]" (Citation
omitted.))
The motion indicates that the proposed
addition is a ninth cause of action for violation of the Los Angeles Tenant
Anti-Harassment Ordinance (Mun. Code Section 45.33).
Cal. Rules of Court Rule 3.1324(b)
states:
A separate declaration must accompany
the motion and must specify:
 
(1)  The effect of the
amendment;
 
(2)  Why the amendment is
necessary and proper;
 
(3)  When the facts giving
rise to the amended allegations were discovered; and
 
(4)  The reasons why the
request for amendment was not made earlier. 

   (Cal. Rules of Court, 3.1324(b).)
            The
Declaration of Victoria L. Ersoff does not comply with Rule 2.1324(b).
Significantly, there is no indication of when the facts giving rise to the
amended allegations were discovered and why the request for amendment was not
made earlier. The Ersoff Declaration vaguely states at ¶ 3:
3. The proposed amended Complaint is
necessary and proper because as the parties engaged in discovery and
investigation, additional facts and evidence have been uncovered warranting the
new proposed cause of action.  The nature
of the case remains unchanged and this amendment will have no effect on
discovery and trial preparation for the case. 
            This is
insufficient to satisfy Rule 3.1324(b).
            The hearing
on the motion for leave to file a first amended complaint is CONTINUED to June 7,
2024 at 8:30 a.m.  Plaintiffs are to file
a supplemental declaration addressing the factors set forth in Rule 3.1324(b)
by June 1, 2024.
