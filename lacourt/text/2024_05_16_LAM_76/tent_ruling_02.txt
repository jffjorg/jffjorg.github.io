and the cause of the fire.
Specially-appearing Defendant

the ground that this Court lacks personal jurisdiction.
TENTATIVE RULING
Defendant/Cross-Complainant Air
Vent, Inc. lodged the following documents under seal without providing the
notice required by Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 2.551(b)(3)(A)(iii)—if Air Vent
does not intend to have the documents sealed—or alternatively, a motion to
seal, pursuant to Rule 2.551(b)(1): (1) The Declaration of Courtney Jakofsky in
support of AVI's Opposition to Powermax's Motion; and (2) the Declaration of
Brad Holland in support of AVI's Opposition to Powermax's Motion.
            Because
this is not a discovery motion, the California Rules of Court governing sealing
procedures applies. (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 2.550(a)(3).) See also
Protective Order, ¶ 17, which indicates that the Confidential Materials
designation obviates a sealing motion only as to discovery motions.

quash the service of summons is CONTINUED to July 10, 2024 at 8:30 a.m. Defendant/Cross-Complainant

alternatively, file a motion to seal to also be heard on July 10, 2024,
