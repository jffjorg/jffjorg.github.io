ANALYSIS
Motion To Compel Deposition of Person Most Knowledgeable 
Discussion          
            Plaintiff moves to compel the
deposition of Defendant Hyundai Motor America’s person most knowledgeable. Both
Plaintiff and Defendant cite, Civ Proc. Code § 2025.480, which  provides in pertinent part:
(a) If a deponent fails to answer
any question or to produce any document, electronically stored information, or
tangible thing under the deponent's control that is specified in the deposition
notice or a deposition subpoena, the party seeking discovery may move the court
for an order compelling that answer or production.

(b) This motion shall be made no later than 60 days after the completion
of the record of the deposition, and shall be accompanied by a meet and confer
declaration under Section 2016.040.

(Civ.,
Proc. Code., § 2025.480(a) & (b).)
            Here, the date set
for production specified in the notice of deposition served on April 17 2023
was May 26, 2023. (Declaration of Michael Saeedian, Exh. 1) On May 19, 2023,
Defendant served objections to the notice of deposition. (Saeedian Decl., Exh.
3.) Plaintiff did not commence meet and confer efforts until March 15, 2024
(Saeedian Decl., Exh. 4), and did not file and serve this motion until April 4,
2024—382 days later.
            This
motion is untimely and must be denied on that basis.  
In sum, the objections served in
response to Unzipped's business records subpoenas constituted a record of a
deposition. The record was complete as of the date set for the production,
December 7, 2005, when Unzipped received the objections. Unzipped had
60 days thereafter, until February 6, 2006, to file a motion to compel. It waited
until March 1, 2006, which rendered the motion untimely. The deadline was
mandatory. (Citation omitted.) The order granting the motion must
therefore be reversed.
(Unzipped Apparel, LLC v. Bader
(2007) 156 Cal.App.4th 123, 130-36 [bold emphasis and underlining added].)
            Further,
even under Civ. Proc. Code, § 2025.450, Plaintiff was required to demonstrate
good cause for production of each of the 41 categories of documents specified
in the deposition notice. Civ. Proc. Code § 2025.450
provides in pertinent part as follows:
 
(a) If, after service of a
deposition notice, a party to the action or an officer, director, managing
agent, or employee of a party, or a person designated by an organization that
is a party under Section 2025.230, without having served a valid objection
under Section 2025.410, fails . . . to proceed with it, . . . the party
giving the notice may move for an order compelling the deponent’s attendance
and testimony, . . .
 
(b) A motion under subdivision (a)
shall comply with both of the following:
 
(1) The motion shall set forth
specific facts showing good cause justifying the production for inspection
of any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described
in the deposition notice.
 
(2) The motion shall be accompanied
by a meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040, or, when the
deponent fails to attend the deposition and produce the documents,
electronically stored information, or things described in the deposition
notice, by a declaration stating that the petitioner has contacted the deponent
to inquire about the nonappearance.
 
. . .
 
(g)
 
(1) If a motion under subdivision
(a) is granted, the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010) in favor of the party who noticed the
deposition and against the deponent or the party with whom the deponent is
affiliated, unless the court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust.
. . .
 
(h) If that party or
party-affiliated deponent then fails to obey an order compelling attendance,
testimony, and production, the court may make those orders that are just,
including the imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a
terminating sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010)
against that party deponent or against the party with whom the deponent is
affiliated. In lieu of, or in addition to, this sanction, the court may impose
a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010)
against that deponent or against the party with whom that party deponent is
affiliated, and in favor of any party who, in person or by attorney, attended
in the expectation that the deponent’s testimony would be taken pursuant to
that order.
 
. . .

     (Civ.
Proc. Code, § 2025.450 [bold emphasis added].)          
For the foregoing reasons, the motion to compel deposition is
DENIED. 
Defendant’s counter-request for sanctions against Plaintiff
and Plaintiff’s counsel, The Lemon Pros, LLP, is GRANTED in the reduced amount
of $1,000. (Decl. of Elham Hassantash, ¶ 15.) Sanctions are to be paid to
Defendant’s counsel within 20 days.
The Court notes that the parties have agreed to set the PMK
deposition for September 12, 2024.
