And here is a text summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The court has issued a tentative ruling regarding the motion for leave to file a first amended complaint. The motion is continued to June 7, 2024, and the parties are required to file a supplemental declaration addressing the factors set forth in Rule 3.1324(b) by June 1, 2024. The court finds that the Ersoff Declaration does not comply with Rule 3.1324(b) because it does not specify when the facts giving rise to the amended allegations were discovered and why the request for amendment was not made earlier. The court is requiring a supplemental declaration to address these issues.
