And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants Plaintiff's Motion to Strike Attachment No. 5 from Defendants' Answer. The judge finds that Attachment No. 5 is an inadmissible exhibit because it is an offer to compromise, which is not admissible as evidence. The judge cites California Evidence Code section 1152, which states that evidence of an offer to compromise is not admissible to prove liability. The judge also cites cases such as Simandle v. Vista de Santa Barbara Associates, LP and Armstrong v. Kline, which hold that statements made during settlement negotiations are not admissible to show liability. The judge concludes that the Motion to Strike is granted, and Plaintiff is ordered to give notice.
