DISCUSSION:
 
            Defendant moves to tax the
memorandum of costs filed by Plaintiff.  
            
Legal Standard 
 
In general, the “prevailing party” is entitled as a matter
of right to recover costs for suit in any action or proceeding. (Code Civ.
Proc. §1032(b); Santisas v. Goodin (1998) 17 Cal.4th 599, 606; Scott Co.
Of Calif. v. Blount, Inc. (1999) 20 Cal.4th 1103, 1108.)  Assuming the
“prevailing party” requirements are met, the trial court has no discretion to
order each party to bear his or her own costs of suit.  (Michell v.
Olick (1996) 49 Cal.App.4th 1194, 1198; Nelson v. Anderson (1999) 72
Cal.App.4th 111, 129.) A defendant who is dismissed from the action is the
“prevailing party.”  (Code Civ. Proc. §1032(a)(4).) This is so whether the
dismissal is voluntary or involuntary.  (Santisas, 17 Cal.4th at 606.)  
 
Allowable costs under Section 1033.5 must be reasonably
necessary to the conduct of the litigation, rather than merely convenient or
beneficial to its preparation, and must be reasonable in amount.  An item
not specifically allowable under Section 1033.5(a) nor prohibited under
subdivision (b) may nevertheless be recoverable in the discretion of the court
if the item meets the above requirements (i.e., reasonably necessary and
reasonable in amount).  If the items appearing in a cost bill appear to be
proper charges, the burden is on the party seeking to tax costs to show that
they were not reasonable or necessary. (Ladas v. California State Automotive
Assoc. (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 761, 773-774.)  On the other hand, if the
items are properly objected to, they are put in issue and the burden of proof
is on the party claiming them as costs.  (Ibid.) Whether a cost
item was reasonably necessary to the litigation presents a question of fact for
the trial court and its decision is reviewed for abuse of discretion.  (Ibid.) 
Because the right to costs is governed strictly by statute, however, a court
has no discretion to award costs not statutorily authorized.  (Id.) 
Discretion is abused only when, in its exercise, the court “exceeds the bounds
of reason, all of the circumstances being considered.”  (Ibid.)   
 
Timeliness of Motion
 
“Any notice of motion to strike or to tax costs must be
served and filed 15 days after service of the cost memorandum. If the cost
memorandum was served by mail or email, the period is extended as provided in
Code of Civil Procedure section 1013.”  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1700(b)(1).) Here,
Plaintiff served the memorandum of costs by electronic service on January 26,
2024. (Memorandum of Costs POS.) This motion was filed and served on February 16,
2024, outside the 15-day period. However, the parties signed a joint
stipulation filed with the Court on February 13 extending the deadline for
Defendant’s motion to February 16, 2024. (Joint Stipulation.) The motion is
therefore timely. 
 
Specificity of
Challenged Costs
 
            Defendant does not specifically
identify in the Notice of Motion which costs it seeks to challenge, as required
by California Rule of Court 3.1700(b). The Court would therefore be within its
discretion to deny the motion in its entirety. However, the Court observes that
Defendant’s memorandum of points and authorities refers to (1) witness fees;
(2) court reporter fees; (3) “other” costs; (4) service of process; and (5)
models, blowups, and photocopies of exhibits, which mirror Items 8, 12, 16, 5,
and 11, respectively, in the Memorandum of Costs. (See Memorandum of Costs
filed January 26, 2024.) As Plaintiff has not objected to the notice of motion
on this basis, the Court will overlook Defendant’s error and consider the
motion on its merits. 
 
Challenged
Costs
 
            Defendant
challenges five sets of claimed costs in Plaintiff’s January 26, 2024
Memorandum of Costs: (1) witness
fees; (2) court reporter fees; (3) “other” costs; (4) service of process; and
(5) models, blowups, and photocopies of exhibits.
 
1.     
Witness Fees (Item 8)
 
            Defendant seeks
to tax Plaintiff’s request for expert witness fees in the amount of $116,114.50,
including $103,894.50 in expert witnesses under Item 8b and $10,250 in costs
pertaining to Dr. Gregory Marusak, the Psychiatrist Qualified Medical Examiner
in Plaintiff’s worker’s compensation action. Plaintiff agrees to withdraw this
cost request. Item 8 should therefore be taxed in the amount of $116,144.50. 
 
2.     
Court Reporter Fees (Item 11)
 
            Defendant
next challenges Plaintiff’s request for “Court Reporter Fees” totaling
$96,006.40 as actually seeking transcript costs not ordered by the Court.
Transcripts not ordered by the Court are not recoverable costs. (Code Civ.
Proc. § 1033(b)(5).) As Defendant states, court reporter fees are a separate
expense from transcript costs because “[t]he parties have to pay the court
reporter regardless of whether anyone orders transcripts.” (Chaaban v. Wet
Seal, Inc. (2012) 203 Cal.App.4th 49, 58-59.) Here, Attachment 12c of the
Memorandum of Costs plainly discloses that the bulk of the costs claimed under
this item, accounting for $88,043.20, are costs for transcripts, which are
improper, while the remaining fees are described as Court Reporter fees. (See
Memo of Costs Attach. 12c.) Plaintiff concedes that the transcript costs are
not recoverable and agrees to withdraw those costs. In reply, Defendant
contends that Plaintiff has not justified the remaining $7,963.20 as properly
pertaining to court reporter fees. Defendant offered no basis in either its
moving papers or its reply for disputing costs under this item beyond the
facial impropriety of transcript costs. The Court therefore finds that
Defendant has not put the remaining costs under this item at issue. Item 12
should therefore be taxed in the amount of $88,043.20. 
 
3.     
Other Costs (Item 16) 
 
            Defendant
seeks to tax for categories of costs claimed under this cost item: $7,768.40 in
IT Video Services from Trial Electronics Direct (Memo of Costs p. 11); $4,164.89
in travel and meal expenses (pp. 11-12); $40 for legal research costs; and $700
for focus group costs.
 
            Defendant
first claims that Plaintiff’s counsel has fabricated an invoice to manufacture
fictitious costs for renting equipment which Plaintiff’s counsel already owns. In
2017, Plaintiff claimed the same costs after the original trial verdict in this
action (later reversed in part on appeal), presenting an invoice from Trial
Electronics Direct for rental equipment in that amount. (Declaration of Joshua
Waldman ISO Mot. Exh. 2 p.104.) Plaintiff presents the same invoice here.
(Declaration of Mahru Madjidi Exh. 4.) In 2017, Defendant’s counsel, Daniel J.
Kessler, presented public records showing that Trial Electronics Direct was a
fictitious business name owned by a non-existent LLC, that its physical address
was actually the address for a hotel in downtown Los Angeles, and the P.O. Box
given on the invoice is actually owned by Plaintiff’s counsel, Shegerian &
Associates. (Declaration of Daniel J. Kessler ISO 2017 Reply ¶¶ 4-5, Exhs. C-F;
attached as Waldman Decl. Exh. 3.) Plaintiff merely states that these
accusations are “baseless and absurd,” and presents no further evidence
establishing the genuineness of these costs beyond a check for the same amount
made out to Trial Electronics Direct. (See Madjidi Decl. Exh. 4.) This meager
showing is not sufficient to carry Plaintiff’s burden in the face of
Defendant’s showing that these costs are improper. The Court therefore finds
that this cost item should be taxed. 
 
            Defendant
also challenges $4,164.89 in travel and meal expenses as travel costs unrelated
to depositions. Travel expenses to attend depositions are expressly permitted.
(Code Civ. Proc. § 1033.5(a)(3).) However, contrary to Plaintiff’s assertion, Ladas
v. California State Auto Association expressly and categorically states
that “Routine expenses for local travel by attorneys or other firm employees
are not reasonably necessary to the conduct of litigation.” (Ladas v.
California State Auto. Assn. (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 761, 775–76.) The Court
therefore concurs that this cost item should be taxed.
 
            As to the
$700 in focus group costs, Defendant asserts without explanation or citation to
authority that focus groups are not “reasonably necessary to the conduct of
litigation.” Conclusory assertions do not suffice to place these costs at
issue, and the Court declines to tax this cost item. 
 
            Finally, with
respect to the request for legal research costs, Plaintiff concedes that this
cost item is improper. 
 
            The Court
therefore taxes Item 16 in the amount of $11,973.29.
 
4.     
Service of Process (Item 5)
 
            The parties
agree that this item should be taxed in the amount of $976.30 in costs
withdrawn by Plaintiff. 
 
5.     
Models, Blow-Ups, and Photocopies (Item 12)
 
            Defendant
challenges the entirety of Plaintiff’s request under this cost item totaling
$61,650.25 in costs for exhibits. As Defendant states, Plaintiff sought
reimbursement of $55,362.50 in identical costs in 2017, and the Court
previously taxed $34,828.36 in costs as not reasonably necessary to the
litigation. (See Waldman Decl. Exh. 9.) Neither party offers any basis for the
Court to depart from that previous ruling. Item 12 should therefore be taxed in
the amount of $34,828.36.
 
CONCLUSION:

 
            Accordingly,
Defendant’s Motion to Tax Costs is GRANTED IN PART. Plaintiff’s Memorandum of
Costs is taxed in the following amounts:
 
·        
Item 5 in the amount of $976.30
 
·        
Item 8 in the amount of $116,144.50. 
 
·        
Item 11 in the amount of $88,043.20.
 
·        
Item 12 in the amount of $34,828.36, 
 
·        
Item 16 in the amount of $11,973.29.
 
Based on these rulings, Plaintiff
is awarded a total of $96,981.41 in litigation costs.
 
            Moving
Party to give notice.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
