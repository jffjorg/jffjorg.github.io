And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the demurrer and motion to strike filed by the plaintiff. The judge believes that the answer filed by the defendant was done in bad faith and therefore grants the motion to strike. As a result, the demurrer is deemed moot. The judge finds that the answer is not credible and that the defendant lacks information sufficient to admit or deny many of the allegations in the complaint. The judge also finds that the affirmative defenses filed by the defendant are ill-pled or not affirmative defenses. The judge warns the defendant that if they fail to file a verified answer that conforms with the law, they will be held in default or an order sustaining parts of the demurrer without leave to amend will be issued. The judge gives the defendant two court days to file a new answer.
