 Case Number:  23PSCV02286    Hearing Date:   November 8, 2023    Dept:  K Petitioner Chong
Yang’s Petition to Approve Compromise of Pending Action is GRANTED, with a
reduction of attorney’s fees from 33.3% to 25% [see below].
Background   
On July 27, 2023, Plaintiff Tiffany
Caridad Herrera-Yang (“Tiffany”), a minor, by and through her Guardian Ad
Litem, Chong Yang (“Yang”) filed a “Complaint (Petition to Open a Civil Case
and Assign a Case Number by Plaintiff/Petitioner Tiffany Caridad
Herrera-Yang).”
A Case Management Conference and an Order to Show Cause Re:
Failure to File Proof of Service are set for January 18, 2024.
Legal Standard
Court approval is required for all settlements of a minor’s
claim.  (Prob. Code §§ 3500, 3600, et seq.; Code Civ. Proc., §
372.)  California Rules of Court Rule 7.950 provides that a petition “must be
verified by the petitioner and must contain a full disclosure of all
information that has any bearing upon the reasonableness of the
compromise.”  (See Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 7.950.)  Rule 7.950 states that the Petition must be
filed on a completed Petition for Approval of Compromise of Claim or Action
or Disposition of Proceeds of Judgment for Minor or Person With a Disability (form
MC-350).
Discussion
At the outset, the court notes that Petitioner has submitted the instant
petition on an outdated Judicial Council Form MC-350, “Rev. January 1, 2011.”
The latest version of MC-350 was made effective January 1, 2021. Counsel for
Petitioner is admonished in this regard. The court nevertheless elects to
review the petition, as follows:
Petitioner Chong Yang seeks court approval of a settlement
between minor claimant Tiffany and Progressive Insurance Company (i.e.,
Tiffany’s mother’s [i.e., Karla Margarita Herrera (“Mother”)]  uninsured policy coverage insurer) in the
total amount of $8,000.00. (Petition, ¶ 11).
The petition is executed by Petitioner. The petition
explains that on December 29, 2020, Tiffany sustained injuries in a motor
vehicle collision on the I-605 southbound. The driver that rear-ended the
vehicle Tiffany was in fled the scene before providing any information. (Id.,
¶¶ 5 and 6). Tiffany sustained neck and upper back pain as a result of the
accident, for which she received chiropractic care from January 18, 2021
through June 2021 and 2 visits with a pain management specialist. (Id.,
¶¶ 7 and 8). Tiffany has recovered completely from the effects of the
aforementioned injuries and there are no permanent injuries. (Id., ¶ 9).
Progressive Insurance Company has also offered to pay
$58,000.00 to Mother to settle claims arising out of the same incident that
resulted in Tiffany’s injury. (Id., ¶ 12.) The apportionment of the
settlement payments is based on negotiation taking into consideration the
relative injuries and medical treatment of each claimant. (Id.,
Attachment 12).
Tiffany’s total medical expenses are $3,660.00 and there are
contractual liens for this amount. (Id., ¶ 13a.(1) and 13b.(5)(a)). In
full satisfaction of their lien claims, the lienholders have agreed to accept
the total sum of $1,850.00, $1,200.00 of which will be paid to Forrest Hannan
DC and $650.00 of which will be paid to Kevin Hayavi MD. (Id., ¶
13b.(5)(b) and Attachments 13a and 13g). This $1,850.00 will be paid from the
settlement proceeds. (Id., ¶ 13a.(2)).
The total amount of attorney’s fees for which court approval
is requested is $2,666.40. (Id., ¶ 14a.). This equates to 33.33% of the
total recovery. The retainer agreement is attached as Attachment 18a. The court
has reviewed the declaration of attorney Sara Rodriguez (“Rodriguez”) (Attachment
14a) and believes that 25% (or $2,000.00) is an appropriate percentage for
attorney’s fees here. Rodriguez only specifically addresses the factors found
in Rules of Court rule 7.955 subdivisions (b)(1), (2), (11) and (13)[1] and
acknowledges that the case was resolved in a “relatively straight-forward
manner.” (Rodriguez Decl., ¶ 3). Further, counsel expects to receive fees in
the additional amount of $26,100.00 from Mother. (Petition, ¶ 18f.).
The net balance of proceeds for Tiffany after payment of all
requested fees and expenses is $3,483.60 (or $4,150.00 based on the reduction
of attorney’s fees to 25%), which will be deposited in an insured account at
Wells Fargo Bank. (Id., ¶ 19b.(2); Attachment 19b(2).)
The court finds the settlement is fair and reasonable,
with the reduction of attorney’s fees from 33.3% to 25%. The petition is
granted. The order will be interlineated to reflect the $4,150.00 amount to be
deposited at Wells Fargo.
