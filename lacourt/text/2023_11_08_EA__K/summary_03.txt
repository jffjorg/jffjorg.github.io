And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to strike portions of the defendant's answer and a demurrer to the defendant's affirmative defenses. The motion to strike is denied, as the defendant's answer does not contain any irrelevant or improper matter. The demurrer is partially overruled and partially sustained. The judge finds that the defendant's affirmative defenses of failure to state a claim, lack of standing, and no damages do not raise any new matter and are merely responsive to the allegations pleaded by the plaintiff. On the other hand, the judge sustains the demurrer as to the defendant's affirmative defenses of effective access, alternative methods, performance of duties, no barriers, reasonableness, good faith, and non-discrimination, as these defenses raise new matter. The judge also sustains the demurrer as to the defendant's eleventh affirmative defense, which is an improper attempt to reserve the right to amend the answer rather than a defense. The court will hear from counsel for the plaintiff as to whether leave to amend is requested and as to which affirmative defenses, and will require an offer of proof if so.
