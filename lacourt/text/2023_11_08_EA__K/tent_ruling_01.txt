Discussion
Sheppard, Mullin,
Richter & Hampton LLP (“Firm”) seeks to be relieved as counsel of
record for Huang, Golden J Group, Yu and J&J Freight (together, “Clients”).
Notice Issues
At the outset, the court notes that there is no indication
that Clients were given notice of the rescheduled November 8, 2023 hearing date
[see footnote #1]. Accordingly, the following analysis is contingent
upon Firm providing the court with proof, at or before the time of the
hearing, that such notice was provided.
Merits
The court has discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw,
and such a motion should be granted provided that there is no prejudice to the
client and it does not disrupt the orderly process of justice. (See
Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21
Cal.App.4th 904, 915; People v. Prince
(1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398.)
California
Rule of Court (“CRC”) Rule 3.1362 requires (1) a notice of motion and motion
directed to the client (made on the Notice
of Motion and Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-051)); (2) a
declaration stating in general terms and without compromising the
confidentiality of the attorney-client relationship why a motion under Code of
Civil Procedure § 284(2) is brought instead of filing a consent under section
284(1) (made on the Declaration in
Support of Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil form
(MC-052)); (3) service of the notice of motion and motion, the declaration, and
the proposed order on the client and on all other parties who have appeared in
the case; and (4) a proposed order relieving counsel (prepared on the Order Granting Attorney's Motion to Be
Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-053)). The court may delay the effective
date of the order relieving counsel until proof of service of a copy of the
signed order on the client has been filed with the court.
Attorney Greg S. Labate (“Labate”) represents that “irreconcilable
differences have arisen between Defendant and counsel. Such difference[s] have
resulted in the breakdown of the attorney-client relationship. [Clients] w[ere]
advised to seek new representation, but substitute counsel has not yet been
engaged.” Labate requests that, in the event the court desires further
information, the court conduct an in camera hearing outside of the
presence of all other parties. (Manfredi & Levine v. Superior Court
(1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128, 1136-1137).
Labate represents that he has served Clients by mail at Clients’ last
known address with copies of the motion papers served with his declaration and
that he has confirmed, within the past 30 days, that the address is current,
via email correspondence.
Clients, in turn, oppose the motion, dispute that there is any conflict
and requests an in camera hearing.
Under the foregoing circumstances, the court will conduct an in camera
hearing between Clients and counsel for Firm.
The Firm and Clients are ordered to be present in the event that Clients
seek an in camera hearing.
