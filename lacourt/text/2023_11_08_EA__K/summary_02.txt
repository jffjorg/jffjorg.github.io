And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge is addressing the rescheduling of hearing dates for Motions #1-#4. The motions were originally set for hearing on October 12, 2023 and October 25, 2023, but were rescheduled to October 30, 2023 and then again to November 8, 2023. However, the Judge notes that there is no indication that the Clients were given notice of the rescheduled November 8, 2023 hearing date, aside from the fact that it was listed on counsel's reply filed October 23, 2023. The Judge will likely consider whether the Clients received proper notice of the rescheduling of the hearing dates.
