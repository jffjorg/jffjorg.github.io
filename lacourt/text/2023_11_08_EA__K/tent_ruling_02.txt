[1]              Motions #1-#4 were filed (and
served via mail and email) on September 18, 2023; Motions #1 and #3 were
originally set for hearing on October 25, 2023 and Motions #2 and #4 were
originally set for hearing on October 12, 2023. On September 19, 2023, moving
counsel filed (and served via mail and email) a “Notice of Rescheduled Hearing
on Sheppard, Mullin, Richter & Hampton’s Motion to be Relieved as
Counsel—Defendant Golden J Group” and a 
“Notice of Rescheduled Hearing on Sheppard, Mullin, Richter &
Hampton’s Motion to be Relieved as Counsel—Defendant J&J Freight Solutions,
LLC,” advising therein that the hearing on Motions #2 and #4 had been
rescheduled to October 30, 2023; the proof of service accompanying same
reflected notice to the Clients.
 
On September 20, 2023, a “Notice Re: Continuance of
Hearing and Order” was filed, wherein the October 25, 2023 scheduled hearing
date on Motions #1 and #3 were rescheduled to October 30, 2023; notice was
given to counsel (but not to the Clients). On October 4, 2023, another “Notice
Re: Continuance of Hearing and Order” was filed, wherein the October 30, 2023
scheduled hearing date on Motions #1-#4 was rescheduled to November 8, 2023;
notice was given to counsel (but again, not to the Clients). Based on the
foregoing, there is no indication that the Clients were given notice of
the rescheduled November 8, 2023 hearing date, aside from the fact that
November 8, 2023 was listed as the hearing date on counsel’s reply filed
October 23, 2023 (i.e., which was served on Clients).
