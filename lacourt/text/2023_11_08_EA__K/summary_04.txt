And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendants' motion to strike the "punitive" attachment from the plaintiffs' complaint. The plaintiffs alleged that the defendants were negligent and reckless in driving under the influence of alcohol and/or drugs, which caused the plaintiffs' injuries and property damage. However, the judge found that the plaintiffs failed to allege specific facts showing malice and/or any other aggravating circumstances in the instant case. The judge will hear from counsel for the plaintiffs as to whether they wish to amend their complaint to include additional allegations and will require an offer of proof if so. The judge's ruling is based on California Code of Civil Procedure section 436 and California Civil Code section 3294, which govern the award of punitive damages.
