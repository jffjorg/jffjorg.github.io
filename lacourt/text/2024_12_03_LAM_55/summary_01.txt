And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the Defendant's motion to quash a subpoena to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The Defendant seeks to quash the subpoena because the FAA regulations prohibit the agency from complying with such a subpoena. The Court has granted the motion, citing the Touhy doctrine, which holds that a federal agency cannot be compelled to comply with a subpoena if its regulations prohibit it. Additionally, the Court notes that the Plaintiffs failed to file an opposition to the motion, which may be deemed a consent to the granting of the motion.
