Significant Statements:

  - "The amount fairly in controversy, not an adjudication of the merits of the claim..."
  - "This standard involves an evaluation of the amount fairly in controversy, not an adjudication of the merits of the claim..."
  - "Even more appropriately, ‘… the test [is] … whether “lack of jurisdiction is clear”…’ [or] virtually unattainable….”'
  - "The court may believe it highly unlikely that plaintiff will recover the amount demanded, but this is not enough to defeat jurisdiction, unless it appears to a legal certainty that plaintiff cannot recover the amount which he has demanded."
```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendants' motion to reclassify the case as a limited civil action. The defendants argued that the amount in controversy does not exceed $35,000, but the judge found that the plaintiff's non-economic damages, such as emotional distress and pain, are difficult to quantify and may be sufficient to meet the amount in controversy threshold. The judge also found that the defendants' arguments regarding punitive damages and civil penalties are not relevant to the motion to reclassify. The case will remain in the unlimited civil court.
