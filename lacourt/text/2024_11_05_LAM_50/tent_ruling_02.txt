[1]As an initial
matter, the Court notes that MAI’s
motion includes a memorandum of points and authorities, but does not appear to
include any notice of motion. Pursuant to California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1112,
subdivision (a), “[u]nless otherwise provided by the rules in this
division, the papers filed in support of a motion must consist of at least the
following: (1) A notice of hearing on the motion; (2) The motion
itself; and (3) A memorandum in support of the motion or demurrer.” In
addition, pursuant to California Rules of Court, rule 3.1110,
subdivision (a), “[a] notice of motion must state in the opening paragraph
the nature of the order being sought and the grounds for issuance of the
order.” MAI’s motion does not comply with all of these requirements. 


[2]In the motion, MAI
incorrectly states that the Complaint was filed on March 6, 2019. (Mot. at p.
2:19.) It thus appears that Plaintiff’s calculations may be off by one day. In
the reply, MAI acknowledges that “[t]his case was filed on March 7, 2019…MAI
mistakenly stated in its Motion that it was filed on March 6, 2019…” (Reply at
p. 2:9-10). 


[3]In the reply, MAI
does not appear to dispute that the period of leave took place between
approximately September 2023 to the end of 2023. (See Reply at p.
6:5-21.)
