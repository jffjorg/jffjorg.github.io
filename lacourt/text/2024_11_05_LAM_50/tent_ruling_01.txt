  ORDER RE:
 
DEFENDANT
  MCLAREN AUTOMOTIVE, INC.’S MOTION TO DISMISS PURSUANT TO 5-YEAR RULE




            Background
Plaintiff Alexander Weinberger
(“Plaintiff”) filed this action on March 7, 2019 against Defendants McLaren Automotive, Inc. (“MAI”) and
O’Gara Coach Company, LLC dba McLaren Beverly Hills. On January 30, 2020, Plaintiff
filed the operative First Amended Complaint (“FAC”). The FAC alleges causes of
action for (1) breach of implied warranty of merchantability and (2) breach of
express warranty. 
MAI now moves to
dismiss the action.[1]
Plaintiff opposes. 
Discussion
Code of Civil Procedure section 583.310 provides, “[a]n action shall be
brought to trial within five years after the action is commenced against the
defendant.” Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 583.360, “(a) An action shall be dismissed by
the court on its own motion or on motion of the defendant, after notice to the
parties, if the action is not brought to trial within the time prescribed in
this article. (b) The requirements of this
article are mandatory and are not subject to extension, excuse, or exception
except as expressly provided by statute.” 
“In computing the time within
which an action must be brought to trial pursuant to this article, there shall
be excluded the time during which any of the following conditions existed: (a) The jurisdiction of the court to try the action was suspended. (b) Prosecution or trial of the
action was stayed or enjoined. (c) Bringing the action to trial,
for any other reason, was impossible, impracticable, or futile.” ((Code
Civ. Proc., § 583.340.) Pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure section 583.330,
“[t]he parties may extend the time within which an action must be brought to
trial pursuant to this article by…written stipulation” and “[b]y oral agreement made in
open court, if entered in the minutes of the court or a transcript is made.” 
In addition, pursuant to Emergency Rule 10(a),
“[n]otwithstanding
any other law, including Code of Civil
Procedure section 583.310, for all civil actions filed on or before April
6, 2020, the time in which to bring the action to trial is extended by six
months for a total time of five years and six months.” (Cal. Rules of Court, Appen.
1, Emergency Rule 10(a).) 
As set forth above, the instant
action was filed on March 7, 2019. MAI asserts that the application of Emergency Rule
10(a) to this case “provided Plaintiff with an additional six-month period
during which he could have brought this case to trial, extending his deadline
to bring the case to September 6, 2024.” (Mot. at p. 2:24-26.)[2] 
MAI
asserts that Plaintiff’s five-year period to bring its claims against MAI has
accordingly expired, and that “there is no applicable exception to the
mandatory dismissal statute.” (Mot. at p. 3:2-3.) MAI’s counsel also indicates
in her supporting declaration that “[o]n January 12, 2024, I appeared before
this Court for a status conference on behalf of MAI. Attached hereto as ‘Exhibit
A’ is a true and correct copy of the transcript of the status conference on
January 12, 2024.” (Gibson Decl., ¶ 2.) MAI points to the following portion of
the January 12, 2024 transcript: “MS. GIBSON:…THE ONLY THING I WANT TO MENTION
BUT WE HAVEN’T DISCUSSED HERE, EMERGENCY RULE 10,
IS THE FIVE-YEAR RULE PASSES ON MARCH 7TH. THE COURT: OKAY. IS THAT WITH OR
WITHOUT – THAT’S WITHOUT THE RULE 10? MS. GIBSON: THAT’S
CORRECT, YOUR HONOR. THE COURT: OKAY. WELL, WHAT’S THE POSITION OF THE PARTIES
ON THAT? I THINK THE CASE JUST CAME DOWN SAYING THAT IT APPLIES. MS. GIBSON: I
DON’T DISAGREE THAT IT WOULD PROBABLY APPLY. IT WOULD MEAN THAT WE WOULD NEED,
I THINK, A DATE SOMETIME BEFORE SEPTEMBER 3RD. THE COURT: OKAY. ANYTHING FROM
THE PLAINTIFF ON THAT? MR. BARRY:  I
WOULD AGREE, YOUR HONOR.” (Gibson Decl., ¶ 2, Ex. A, p. 5:6-19.) MAI asserts
that accordingly, “Plaintiff was aware that the five-year period was
approaching…” (Mot. at p. 2:11, citing Transcript of January 12, 2024 Status
Conference.) 
In
the opposition, Plaintiff asserts that “mandatory dismissal under Code of Civil Procedure section 583.360 is not
warranted and should be denied.” (Opp’n at p. 2:16-17.) Plaintiff asserts that the
exception set forth in Code of Civil Procedure
section 583.340, subdivision (c) is applicable here. This provision
provides that “[i]n computing the time within which an action must be brought
to trial pursuant to this article, there shall be excluded the time during
which any of the following conditions existed:…(c) Bringing the action to
trial, for any other reason, was impossible, impracticable, or futile.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 583.340, subd. (c).)
Plaintiff
argues that “[t]he error in Defendant’s calculation is that it has not
accounted for Judge Beaudet’s September through December, 2023 period of
unavailability which…made it impossible if not impracticable for Plaintiff to
bring this matter to trial. The result of this is that the five-year statute
was tolled at least for the same amount of time - four months - and it is time
added later to Plaintiff’s five-year statute…Applying this provides Plaintiff
with an extension until at least January, 2025 to bring this matter to trial.” (Opp’n
at pp. 6:27-7:7.) 
Plaintiff’s
counsel attaches to his supporting declaration certain minute orders in this
matter. The Court’s August 10, 2023 minute order provides, inter alia,
that “[t]he parties will retrieve the latest trial document binders by August
18, 2023 and by October 2, 2023, they will update it to include the final set
of stipulated facts, the applicable witness list, the joint set of agreed upon
or ruled upon jury instructions, the remaining contested CACI and special
instructions, the special verdict form, the updated joint exhibit list, and the
parties designations of deposition excerpts and any objections thereto. Final
Status Conference is continued to 10/09/23…Trial Setting Conference is
scheduled for 10/09/23...” (Barry Decl., ¶ 3, Ex. A.) Plaintiff asserts that
after this August 10, 2023 Final Status Conference, “Judge Rolf Treu held court
for Department 50, holding hearings on October 9, 2023, November 17, 2023 and
December 5, 2023. Nothing happened…during this time.” (Opp’n at p. 5:4-6.)  
The
Court’s October 9, 2023 minute order provides, inter alia, “[t]he
Honorable Judge Rolf Treu for Honorable Teresa A. Beaudet…[o]n the Court’s own
motion, the Final Status Conference scheduled for 10/09/2023, and Trial Setting
Conference scheduled for 10/09/2023 are continued to 11/17/23…” (Barry Decl., ¶
3, Ex. A.) On November 17, 2023, the Court issued a minute order providing, inter
alia, that “[t]he Honorable Judge Rolf Treu for Honorable Teresa A. Beaudet…On
the Court’s own motion, the Final Status Conference scheduled for 11/17/2023,
and Trial Setting Conference scheduled for 11/17/2023 are continued to 12/05/23…”
(Ibid.) On December 5, 2023, the Court
issued a minute order providing, inter alia, that “[t]he Honorable Judge
Rolf Treu for Honorable Teresa A. Beaudet…On the Court’s own motion, the Final
Status Conference scheduled for 12/05/2023, and Trial Setting Conference
scheduled for 12/05/2023 are continued to 01/12/24…” (Ibid.)[3] 
In
the reply, MAI argues that “Plaintiff contends that Judge Beaudet’s leave from
September 3 or 4, 2023 to the end of 2023 must be extracted from the
calculation of his statutory deadline yet fails to provide case law supporting
that this 120-day period constitutes a ‘substantial portion’ of his overall
deadline. For context, from March 7, 2019 (the date Plaintiff filed his
Complaint) to September 9, 2024 (the date of the expiration of the five- and
one-half-year period) is 2,013 days, meaning that Judge Beaudet’s approximately
120-day leave would have constituted less than 6% of the totality of the
case—far from what could be considered to be a ‘substantial portion.’” (Reply
at p. 6:6-13.) In support of this argument, MAI cites to Tamburina v. Combined Ins. Co. of America (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 323, 333-334 (Tamburina), where the Court of Appeal noted as
follows: 
 
“And Sierra Nevada concerned
illness as the circumstance of impracticability. As we explained there: “The
text of section 583.340[(c)] impels the view that
there must be a causal connection between the circumstance upon which plaintiff
relies and the failure to satisfy the five-year requirement. Bringing the
action to trial must be impossible, impracticable, or futile for the reason
proffered. … [¶] A bare showing that a counsel was ill does not warrant the
attribution of such causation. Two kinds of circumstance occur to us in which
it may be appropriate to say that the illness o[f] counsel has caused the
plaintiff to fail to bring the case to trial in compliance with the five-year
requirement. The first is when an illness of counsel occurs at the end of
the five-year period in circumstances in which it is likely that counsel, but
for the illness, would have become aware of the impending deadline and taken
the appropriate action to avert the transgression. The second is an unusually
lengthy illness of sole counsel which deprives the plaintiff of a substantial
portion of the five-year period for prosecution of the lawsuit, i.e., trial
preparation and moving the case to trial.” (Emphasis omitted.) 
            In Tamburina, the period of
impracticability was 424 days. (Tamburina, supra, 147 Cal.App.4th
at p. 336.) In DeSantiago v. D & G Plumbing, Inc. (2007) 155 Cal.App.4th
365, 374, cited by MAI, the period of impracticability considered was 318 days
(impracticability not found for other reasons); and in Sanchez v. City of
Los Angles, 109 Cal.App.4th 1262, 1272, also cited by MAI, the
periods considered were 4 months and 69 days (impracticability not found for
other reasons).
In Chin v. Meier (1991) 235 Cal.App.3d 1473, 1478, cited by Plaintiff, the Second
District Court of Appeal noted that “[i]t is clear that so long as the court
may conclude that there was a period of impossibility, impracticability or
futility, over which plaintiff had no control…the court is required to toll
that period even if there is ample time after said period of impracticability
within which to go to trial.” The Court finds that Plaintiff has shown that
here, there was a period over which Plaintiff had no control (i.e.,
Judge Beaudet’s four-month leave) during which it was impracticable to bring
the action to trial. Thus, the Court does not find that MAI has shown that the
instant action must be dismissed because it was “not brought to trial within
the time prescribed in [Code of Civil Procedure
sections 583.310-583.360].” (Code Civ. Proc., §
583.360, subd. (a).)  
Conclusion
Based on the foregoing,
the Court denies MAI’s motion to dismiss. 
The Court orders Plaintiff
to give notice of this ruling.
