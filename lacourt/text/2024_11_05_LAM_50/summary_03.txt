```

And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied the Plaintiff's request for a default judgment without prejudice. The Court notes several defects in the submitted default judgment package, including unclear mailing information, miscalculations of damages and costs, and a lack of legal authority for certain requested costs. Additionally, the Court finds that the Plaintiff has not provided a declaration of nonmilitary status for the defendant, as required by California Rules of Court and federal law. The Court will discuss with the Plaintiff a schedule for resubmitting the default judgment package. If the Plaintiff's future request for a default judgment is granted and the Court is unable to determine whether the defendant is in military service, the Court may require the Plaintiff to file a bond in an amount approved by the Court.
