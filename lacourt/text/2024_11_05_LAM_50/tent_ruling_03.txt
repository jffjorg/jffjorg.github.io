[TENTATIVE] ORDER
  RE:
 
PLAINTIFF’S REQUEST FOR DEFAULT JUDGMENT  




            
Plaintiff
Danielle Hines (“Plaintiff”) requests entry of default judgment against
Defendant Cameron Moore, an individual, dba Beyond Vegan Eats, dba Juice Bae. Plaintiff
seeks judgment in the total amount of $193,704.80, comprising $128,955.00 in
damages, $12,895.50 in interest, $3,104.28 in costs, and $48,750.00 in
attorney’s fees.  
The
Court notes a number of defects with the submitted default judgment package.
First, Item 6(b)(2) of
the Request for Court Judgment (Form CIV-100) does not list any name(s). Thus,
it is unclear who the request was mailed to. 

Second, the amounts
requested for damages, interest, costs, and attorney’s fees do not appear to
add up to the total requested amount of $193,704.80. Rather, it appears the
amounts add up to $193,704.78. 
Third, Plaintiff seeks $12,895.50 in
interest. Plaintiff does not appear to provide calculations demonstrating how
Plaintiff arrived at this amount. Pursuant to California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1800, subdivision (a)(3), a party seeking a default
judgment must file “[i]nterest computations as necessary.”
Fourth, Plaintiff has not set forth any
legal authority for certain requested costs that are not allowable under Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5 (i.e., $138.03 in
costs for “mailing service.”) (See Request for Court Judgment, Item 7(c).)  
Fifth,
Plaintiff seeks overtime wages in the amount of $6,120.00 for the period of
January 2020 through April 2020, and overtime wages in the amount of $16,875.00
for the period of April 2020 through November 2020. (Hines Decl., ¶¶ 18-19.) It
is still unclear if Plaintiff included the overtime wages for April 2020 twice
in her calculations. (See Hines Decl., ¶¶ 18-19.) Plaintiff’s
calculations for the periods January 2020-April 2020 and April 2020-November
2020 do not identify specific starting and ending dates for such periods. (Ibid.) Similarly, it is still
unclear if Plaintiff requested damages for missed meal and rest breaks twice
for April 2020. (See Hines Decl., ¶¶ 20-21.)
Sixth, Plaintiff’s proposed judgment (Form
JUD-100) should check the box for “By Court” under “JUDGMENT.” In addition, Item
5(a) of the proposed judgment appears to contain a typo: “Cameron Moore, dba
Beyond Vegan Eats, dba Juice Bea.” (Underline added.) This typo also
appears on Item 1(d) of the Request for Court Judgment (Form CIV-100).  
Seventh, Plaintiff’s request for
$48,750.00 in attorney’s fees exceeds the permissible amount under Los Angeles
Superior Court Local ¿¿Rule 3.214¿¿.
Eighth, Item 8(f) of Plaintiff’s Request
for Court Judgment (Declaration of nonmilitary status) provides that “[d]espite
Plaintiff’s best efforts to confirm Defendant’s military status, Plaintiff has
been unable to do so because Defendant has been nonresponsive. See Declaration
of Camron Dowlatshahi, ¶ 5.” The Court notes that pursuant to California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1800, subdivision (a)(5), a party seeking a default
judgment must file “[a] declaration of nonmilitary status for each defendant
against whom judgment is sought.” Weil & Brown, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil
Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter Group 2024) ¶ 5:198 provides, inter alia,
that “federal law prohibits entry of a default judgment against any individual
defendant without a declaration showing that the defendant is not in
military service. [50 USC § 3931(b)(1)]…If unable to
determine whether defendant is in military service, the court may require
plaintiff to post a bond to indemnify defendant against any loss if the
judgment is later set aside. [See 50 USC § 3931(b)(3)].”
(Emphasis in original.)   
Specifically, pursuant to 50 U.S.C.
section 3931, subdivision (b)(1), “[i]n any action or proceeding covered by
this section, the court, before entering judgment for the plaintiff, shall
require the plaintiff to file with the court an affidavit—(A)¿stating whether
or not the defendant is in military service and showing necessary facts to
support the affidavit; or (B)¿if the plaintiff is unable to determine whether
or not the defendant is in military service, stating that the plaintiff is
unable to determine whether or not the defendant is in military service.” In
addition, 50 U.S.C. section 3931, subdivision (b)(3)
provides as follows:  
            
“If based upon the affidavits filed in such an
action, the court is unable to determine whether the defendant is in military
service, the court, before entering judgment, may require the plaintiff to file
a bond in an amount approved by the court. If the defendant is later found to
be in military service, the bond shall be available to indemnify the defendant
against any loss or damage the defendant may suffer by reason of any judgment
for the plaintiff against the defendant, should the judgment be set aside in
whole or in part. The bond shall remain in effect until expiration of the time
for appeal and setting aside of a judgment under applicable Federal or State
law or regulation or under any applicable ordinance of a political subdivision
of a State. The court may issue such orders or enter such judgments as the
court determines necessary to protect the rights of the defendant under this
Act [50 USCS §§ 3901 et seq.].”  
As set forth herein, Plaintiff’s request for default judgment
is denied without prejudice. However, if any future request for default
judgment by Plaintiff is granted, and “based upon the affidavits filed in
[this] action, the court is unable to determine whether the defendant is in
military service, the court, before entering judgment, may require [Plaintiff]
to file a bond in an amount approved by the court.” (50
U.S.C. § 3931, subd. (b)(3).)  
Based
on the foregoing, the Court denies Plaintiff’s request for default judgment
without prejudice. The Court will discuss with Plaintiff a schedule for
resubmission of the default judgment package.
