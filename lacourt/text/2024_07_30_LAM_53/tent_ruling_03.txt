  Order RE:
 
plaintiff’s motion to compel further

MOVING PARTY:                 Plaintiff Angela Brown
 
RESPONDING PARTY:        Unopposed
Motion to Compel Further Responses to Special Interrogatories
The court
considered the moving papers filed in connection with this motion.  No opposition papers were filed.
DISCUSSION
Plaintiff Angela Brown (“Plaintiff”) moves the court for an order (1)
compelling defendant Smart Resources Nursing Registry (“Defendant”) to serve
further supplemental responses to Plaintiff’s Special Interrogatories, Set One,
numbers 2, 5, 6, 10, 11, and 13, and     
 (2) awarding monetary sanctions
in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant in the amount of $2,160.
As a threshold matter, the court notes that, on December 5, 2023, the
court issued an order granting the motion to be relieved as Defendant’s counsel
filed by attorney W. Dan Lee.  The court
ordered that W. Dan Lee will be relieved as counsel of record for Defendant
effective upon the filing of the proof of service of the signed “Order Granting
Attorney’s Motion to be Relieved as Counsel – Civil” on Defendant.  (Dec. 5, 2023 Order, MC-053, ¶ 5, subd.
(a).)  On December 13, 2023, Defendant’s
counsel filed a proof of service purporting to establish service of the signed
order on Defendant.  However, the proof
of service does not state that the signed “Order Granting Attorney’s Motion to
be Relieved as Counsel – Civil” was served on Defendant; instead, it describes
the document that was served to be the “Proof of Service re Order
Granting Attorney’s Motion to be Relieved as Counsel of Defendant Smart
Resources Nursing Registry.”  (Dec. 13,
2023 Proof of Service, p. 2:5-7 [emphasis added].)  Thus, the proof of service establishes only
that the proof of service itself was served on Defendant, and not the “Order
Granting Attorney’s Motion to be Relieved as Counsel – Civil.”  Moreover, the “Order Granting Attorney’s
Motion to be Relieved as Counsel – Civil” was not attached to the proof of
service, such that service of the proof of service established service of the
court’s order on Defendant.  (Dec. 13,
2023 Proof of Service.) 
Thus, because Defendant’s counsel has not filed a valid proof of
service of the signed “Order Granting Attorney’s Motion to be Relieved as
Counsel – Civil” on Defendant, the court finds that counsel (i.e., attorney W.
Dan Lee) has not been relieved as counsel for Defendant.  The court will therefore order Plaintiff to
serve a notice of this ruling on both (1) Defendant directly, at its address of
record, and (2) attorney W. Dan Lee. 
The court grants Plaintiff’s motion to compel Defendant’s
further responses to Special Interrogatories, numbers 2 and 5-6 because (1) Defendant’s
answers (made by exercising the option to produce documents under section
2030.230) to those interrogatories are evasive and incomplete; (2) the exercise
of the option to produce documents under section 2030.230 is unwarranted and
the required specification of those documents is inadequate, and (3) the
objections to those interrogatories are without merit.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subds. (a)(1),
(a)(2), and (a)(3); Shakouri Decl., ¶ 6 and Ex. 2.) 
The court denies Plaintiff’s motion to compel Defendant’s
further response to Special Interrogatories, number 10 because Defendant’s
answer to that interrogatory is not evasive or incomplete.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (a)(1).) 
The court grants Plaintiff’s motion to compel Defendant’s
further responses to Special Interrogatories, numbers 11 and 13 because
Defendant’s answers to those interrogatories are evasive and incomplete.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (a)(1).) 
The court grants Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd.
(d).)  The court finds that $1,810 ((2.5
hours x $700 hourly rate) + $60 filing fee) is a reasonable amount of sanctions
to impose against Defendant in connection with this motion.  (Shakouri Decl., ¶¶ 9-10.)
ORDER
            The court grants plaintiff Angela
Brown’s motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories as
follows. 
            Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 2030.300, the court orders defendant Smart Resources Nursing Registry
to serve further, full and complete answers to plaintiff Angela Brown’s Special
Interrogatories, Set One, numbers 2, 5, 6, 11, and 13, which comply with Code
of Civil Procedure sections 2030.210-2030.250, within 20 days of the date of
service of this order. 
            The court orders defendant Smart
Resources Nursing Registry to pay monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,810 to
plaintiff Angela Brown within 30 days of the date of service of this order. 
The court orders plaintiff Angela Brown to give notice of this ruling
(1) to defendant Smart Resources Nursing Registry at its address of record, as
set forth in section 6 of the “Order Granting Attorney’s Motion to be Relieved
as Counsel – Civil” filed on December 5, 2023, and (2) to attorney W. Dan Lee.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
 
DATED:  July 30, 2024
