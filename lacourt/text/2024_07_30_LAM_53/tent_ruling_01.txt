plaintiff’s motion for terminating sanctions
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                 Plaintiff David Maijala          
 
RESPONDING PARTIES:     Defendant and cross-complainant Mulgrew
Aircraft Components, Inc., and defendant Mohammad Houshiar             
Motion for Terminating Sanctions
The court
considered the moving, opposition, reply, and supplemental reply papers filed
in connection with this motion.[1]

DISCUSSION
Plaintiff David Maijala (“Plaintiff”) moves the court for an order (1)
imposing terminating sanctions against defendant Mulgrew Aircraft Components,
Inc. (“Defendant”), and (2) awarding monetary sanctions in favor of Plaintiff
and against Defendant in the amount of $18,100. 
Plaintiff moves for this relief on the ground that Defendant violated
the court’s September 8, 2023, and March 4, 2024 orders. 
On September 8, 2023, the court issued an order (1) granting in part
Plaintiff’s motion to compel the production of documents in response to Plaintiff’s
First Amended Notice of Deposition, and (2) ordering Defendant to produce, at
the deposition of its person(s) most qualified, documents responsive to
Plaintiff’s requests for production of documents (i) numbers 1, 5-8, 10, 13,
16, 22, 54-59, 61-62, 69, and 71, and (ii) numbers 14-15, 28, 30-44, 64, and
117-124, limited to the period of time from May 1, 2016 through October 10,
2019, as set forth in Plaintiff’s First Amended Notice of Deposition.  (Sep. 8, 2023 Order, p. 3:7-15.)  Thereafter, on March 4, 2024, the court issued
an order (1) denying Plaintiff’s motion for terminating and monetary sanctions,
but (2) ordering Defendant to produce the documents specified in the court’s
September 8, 2023 order at a deposition of its person(s) most qualified, to be
taken by Plaintiff’s counsel “on a date no later than March 29, 2024[.]”  (Mar. 4, 2024 Order, p. 5:16-26.)
Plaintiff contends that Defendant did not produce the following
documents at the deposition of its person most qualified: (1) approximately 150
Best Deburring Services Certificates of Conformance (Request for Production No.
39); (2) all subcontracted forming-related documents (Requests for Production
Nos. 32, 38, 69); (3) a list of Defendant’s employees and consultants (Request
for Production No. 37); (4) all communications to and from Plaintiff’s email
addresses at Mulgrew (Requests for Production Nos. 7 and 13); (5) all of
Defendant’s policies and procedures for manufacturing rainbow fittings (Request
for Production No. 14);    (6) all of Defendant’s policies and procedures
regrading employee protections against retaliation (Request for Production No.
15); (7) all contracts and purchase orders between Defendant and Lockheed
(Request for Production No. 33); (8) completed traveler documents for Lockheed
rainbow fittings (Request for Production No. 35); (9) AS9100 system audit
documentation (Request for Production No. 41); (10) all Lockheed annual surveys
or audits of Defendant (Request for Production No. 43); and (11) all penetrant
inspection results for Lockheed wing joint fitting (rainbow fittings) (Requests
for Production Nos. 120 and 124).
In its opposition to this motion, Defendant (1) submits evidence
establishing that, on May 20, 2024, Defendant produced approximately 150
documents in response to Request for Production of Documents, number 39, and
(2) states, in its opposition brief, that it produced various other documents
on that date and on May 24, 2024.  (Nenni
Decl., ¶ 22; Opp., pp. 7:10-12, 14:5-7.)  Defendant’s counsel further states that
Defendant is “not aware of any existing, responsive documents which have not
been produced in this matter.”  (Nenni
Decl., ¶ 24.)  Plaintiff asserts, in his
supplemental reply papers, that Defendant still has not produced all responsive
documents. 
The court finds that Plaintiff has met his burden to show that
Defendant (1) has documents in its possession, custody, or control that are
responsive to Requests for Production of Documents numbers 7, 13, 32, 35,
38-39, and 69, but (2) did not produce those documents at the deposition of
those of its officers, directors, managing agents, employees, or agents who are
most qualified to testify on Defendant’s behalf no later than March 29,
2024.  (March 4, 2024 Order, p. 5:18-26.)
 
1.    
Meet and Confer Requirement
As a threshold matter, the court notes that Defendant contends that
Plaintiff did not meet and confer before filing the pending motion.  However, Plaintiff was not required to meet
and confer with Defendant before filing this motion for terminating and
monetary sanctions for failure to obey the court’s orders directing Defendant
to produce documents.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§§ 2023.030, 2025.450, subd. (h).)  The
court therefore evaluates Plaintiff’s motion on its merits. 
2.    
Best Deburring Services Certificates of
Conformance (Request for Production No. 39) 
The court finds that Plaintiff has shown that Defendant has in its
possession, custody, or control Best Deburring Services (“BDS”) Certificates of
Conformance that were not produced within the time ordered by the court.  (March 4, 2024 Order, p. 5:18-26; Kakoian
Decl., Ex. C, Pl. First Amended Notice of Depo., p. 15:24-27 [Request No. 39].)

Plaintiff states, in his declaration, that (1) Defendant produced only
a single BDS Certificate of Conformance (the same certificate produced by
Plaintiff), and (2) Plaintiff knows that nearly 150 certificates were not
produced since (i) defendant Mohammad Houshiar testified that a Certificate of
Conformance accompanies every order of parts processed by BDS and delivered to
Defendant, and (ii) Defendant produced over 150 invoices and purchase orders
from BDS, such that there exists at least 150 corresponding certificates that
Defendant did not produce.  (Maijala
Decl., ¶ 5, pp. 4:3-4, 4:15-16, 5:18-21.)  In opposition, Defendant submits the
declaration of its counsel, in which counsel states that, after reviewing
Plaintiff’s moving papers, Defendant “determined there were indeed some
outstanding Certificates of Compliance from [BDS], a vendor, to [Defendant],
responsive to Demand No. 39, which had not yet been produced[,]” and that
Defendant “produced these approximately 150 documents on May 20, 2024.”  (Nenni Decl., ¶ 22.)  Plaintiff does not dispute, in his
supplemental reply papers, that Defendant has produced all documents responsive
to this demand.  (Maijala Supp. Decl., ¶
4.) 
Thus, the court finds that Defendant has now complied with the court’s
orders to produce all documents responsive to Request for Production of
Documents, number 39.  The court further
finds, based on the evidence presented, that Plaintiff has also shown that
Defendant did not comply with the court’s March 4, 2024 order to produce those
documents to Plaintiff at the deposition of those of its officers, directors,
managing agents, employees, or agents who are most qualified to testify on its
behalf to be taken “on a date no later than March 29, 2024 . . . .”  (March 4, 2024 Order, p. 3:18-26.)  As set forth above, Defendant did not make
the ordered production of documents until May 20, 2024—i.e., approximately two
months after the date by which the court ordered the documents to be
produced.  The court also notes that Defendant
did not present evidence (1) explaining why Defendant did not discover the
responsive documents until after counsel reviewed the pending motion for
terminating sanctions, or (2) establishing that the documents could not have
been produced at the deposition of its person most qualified had Defendant
acted diligently.  (Nenni Decl., ¶ 22.)
Thus, the court finds that (1) Defendant engaged in conduct that is a
misuse of the discovery process by failing to comply with the court’s order to
produce those documents at a deposition of its person most qualified no later
than March 29, 2024, but (2) Defendant has now complied with the court’s order,
such that Plaintiff is no longer prejudiced by Defendant’s failure to produce
those documents by March 29, 2024 as ordered by the court.  (March 4, 2024 Order, p. 3:18-26; Code Civ.
Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (g).)
 
3.    
Subcontracting of Forming Work (Requests for
Production Nos. 32, 38, and 69)
The court finds that Plaintiff has shown that Defendant has in its
possession, custody, or control documents regarding subcontracting for the performing
of “forming” work that were not produced as ordered by the court in its September
8, 2023 and March 4, 2024 orders.  (Sep.
8, 2023 Order, p. 3:9-15; March 4, 2024 Order, p. 5:18-26; Kakoian Decl., Ex. C,
Pl. First Amended Notice of Depo., pp. 14:23-27 [Request No. 32], 15:21-24
[Request No. 38 demanding documents for invoices, purchase orders, and payments
for BDS], 21:5-8 [Request No. 69 demanding documents that Defendant gave BDS
requiring BDS to perform forming].) 
Plaintiff has stated, in his declaration, that (1) Defendant produced
18 BDS invoices;     (2) five responsive documents exist but were
not produced; and (3) Plaintiff knows that responsive documents exist but were
not produced because (i) the BDS invoices contain unique identification numbers
(e.g., job numbers, Mulgrew PO numbers) and (ii) when searching the unique
identification numbers, no associated documents were found in the production.  (Maijala Decl., ¶ 6, pp. 5:2-3, 6:12-21, 7:4-9.)
 In his supplemental reply papers,
Plaintiff asserts that Defendant did not produce additional documents
responsive to these document demands on May 20, 2024 and May 24, 2024.  (Maijala Supp. Decl., ¶ 6.)  Moreover, the court finds that Defendant has
not presented evidence establishing that it has since produced responsive
documents or that the documents described by Plaintiff do not exist.  Although counsel for Defendants states, in his
declaration, that counsel and Defendants “are not aware of any existing,
responsive documents which have not been produced in this matter[,]” the court
(1) notes that counsel did not present evidence establishing his personal knowledge
of this fact, and (2) finds this assertion to be insufficient to show that
these documents do not exist.  (Nenni
Decl., ¶ 24.)  
Thus, the court finds that Defendant engaged in conduct that is a
misuse of the discovery process by failing to comply with the court’s order to
produce documents responsive to Requests for Production of Documents, numbers
32, 38, and 69.  (Sep. 8, 2023 Order, p.
3:9-15; March 4, 2024 Order, p. 5:18-26; Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subd.
(g).)  However, Plaintiff has not
presented evidence or argument establishing that Defendant’s failure to produce
the specified documents has prejudiced him. 
Specifically, Plaintiff states only that the failure to produce is
important because it may indicate that there are 42 to 72 missing associated
documents.  (Maijala Decl., ¶ 6, p.
6:24-28.)  Thus, the court finds that
Plaintiff has not identified prejudice that he has suffered as a result of Defendant’s
conduct regarding the failure to produce this discovery. 
4.    
List of Mulgrew Employees and Consultants
(Request for Production No. 37)
The court finds that Plaintiff has not met his burden to show that
documents responsive to Request for Production number 37, which demands the
production of a list of all employees and consultants working as quality
department and engineering department personnel or Quality Management System
consultants for Defendant, exist but were not produced.  (Kakoian Decl., Ex. C, Pl. First Amended
Notice of Depo., p. 15:14-20 [Request No. 37].)  Plaintiff has not presented evidence
establishing that such a list exists, and instead has stated generally that he
knows this information was withheld because Defendant’s production does not
include this information.  (Maijala
Decl., ¶ 7, p. 8:8-10.)  The court finds
that this showing is insufficient to establish that Defendant has such a list
in its possession, custody, or control.  Moreover,
Defendant did not have an obligation to create a list including this
information to produce at the deposition of its person(s) most qualified. 
Thus, the court finds that Plaintiff has not shown that Defendant
engaged in conduct that is a misuse of the discovery process by not producing a
list of its employees and consultants in certain positions.
5.    
Communications to and from Plaintiff’s Email Account
at Mulgrew (Requests for Production Nos. 7 and 13)
The court finds that Plaintiff has shown that Defendant has in its
possession, custody, or control documents showing communications sent to and
from the email account that Plaintiff used while working for Defendant that
were not produced as ordered by the court in its September 8, 2023 and March 4,
2024 orders.  (Sep. 8, 2023 Order, p. 3:9-15;
March 4, 2024 Order, p. 5:18-25; Kakoian Decl., Ex. C, Pl. First Amended Notice
of Dep., pp. 11:11-12 [Request No. 7 demanding all communications to and from
Plaintiff’s email], 12:4-6 [Request No. 13 demanding all documents and
communications regarding Plaintiff’s work duties].)  
Plaintiff, who has knowledge of the emails sent to and from the email
address he used while working for Defendant, has identified specific emails
that were not included in Defendant’s production, and has also stated that portions
of emails and continued communications were not produced.  (Maijala Decl., ¶ 8, pp. 9:8-10:2.)  Moreover, Defendant did not produce sufficient
evidence, independent of its counsel’s conclusory assertion that there exist no
other responsive documents that have not been produced, establishing that these
documents do not exist.  (Nenni Decl., ¶
24.)  In his supplemental reply
declaration, Plaintiff asserts that there remain outstanding emails from
Defendant’s production.  (Maijala Supp.
Decl., ¶ 7, p. 7:14-27.) 
Thus, the court finds that Defendant engaged in conduct that is a
misuse of the discovery process by failing to comply with the court’s order to
produce documents responsive to Requests for Production of Documents, numbers 7
and 13.  (Sep. 8, 2023 Order, p. 3:9-15;
March 4, 2024 Order, p. 5:18-25; Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (g).)  The court further finds that Plaintiff has
demonstrated a low level of prejudice because he has shown that the documents
that have not been produced may refute Defendant’s claims that it was not
informed by Plaintiff of violations of certain requirements.  (Maijala Decl., ¶ 8, p. 10:4-9.)   
6.    
Mulgrew’s Policies and Procedures for
Manufacturing Rainbow Fittings (Request for Production No. 14)
The court finds that Plaintiff has not met his burden to show that
documents responsive to Request for Production number 14, which demands the
production of all documents regarding Defendant’s policies and procedures with
regard to the manufacturing of rainbow fittings for Lockheed Martin, exist but
were not produced.  (Kakoian Decl., Ex.
C, Pl. First Amended Notice of Dep., p. 12:7-11 [Request No. 14].) 
Plaintiff asserts that documents regarding one specific procedure
(QP-7.5, Quality Traveler Authority) remain outstanding.  (Maijala Decl., ¶ 9, p. 11:14.)  However, Plaintiff did not present evidence
establishing how he knows that documents evidencing such a procedure exists
(e.g., if Plaintiff, while working for Defendant, had knowledge of this
procedure) and was therefore withheld by Defendant. 
Thus, the court finds that Plaintiff has not shown that Defendant
engaged in conduct that is a misuse of the discovery process by not producing
documents regarding the QP-7.5 Quality Traveler Authority procedure. 
7.    
Mulgrew’s Policies and Procedures Regarding
Employee Protections Against Retaliation (Request No. 15)
The court finds that Plaintiff has not met his burden to show that
documents responsive to Request for Production of Documents, number 15, which
demands the production of all documents regarding Defendant’s policies and
procedures regarding employee protections against retaliation for reporting
illegal activity to Defendant, exist but were not produced.  (Sep. 8, 2023 Order, p. 3:9-15; March 4, 2024
Order, p. 5:18-26; Kakoian Decl., Ex. C, Pl. First Amended Notice of Dep., p.
12:12-15 [Request No. 15].)  Plaintiff
has not presented evidence establishing knowledge that documents evidencing
policies and procedures for employee protections against retaliation exist, and
instead has generally asserted that such documents were not produced.  (Maijala Decl., ¶ 10.)  Moreover, Plaintiff’s evidence appears to indicate
that these documents may not exist. 
Specifically, Plaintiff stated that, “[i]n his deposition, [Mohammad]
Houshiar was uncertain whether [Defendant] provided such protections.”  (Ibid.) 
Thus, the court finds that Plaintiff has not shown that Defendant
engaged in conduct that is a misuse of the discovery process by not producing
documents evidencing policies and procedures regarding employee protections
against retaliation. 
8.    
Contracts and Purchase Orders Between Mulgrew
and Lockheed (Request for Production No. 33) 
The court finds that Plaintiff has not met his burden to show that
Defendant has in its possession, custody, or control documents regarding contracts
and/or purchase orders between Defendant and Lockheed Martin for rainbow
fittings that were not produced as ordered by the court in its September 8,
2023 and March 4, 2024 orders.  (Sep. 8,
2023 Order, p. 3:9-15; March 4, 2024 Order, p. 5:18-26; Kakoian Decl., Ex. C,
Pl. First Amended Notice of Dep., pp. 14:28-15:2 [Request No. 33].) 
Plaintiff asserts that (1) Defendant has produced a number of
contracts between Defendant and Lockheed Martin; (2) those contracts “contain
references to [Department of Defense] contracts or other Lockheed documents
containing further requirements, such as Federal Acquisition Regulations
(FARs), which are Federal requirements applicable to contractors and
subcontractors working under Federal contracts[;]” but (3) the documents that
were referenced in the contracts have not been produced.  (Maijala Decl., ¶ 11, p. 13:1-6, 13:20-28.)  However, Plaintiff has not shown that the
documents that he contends were not produced are responsive to demand number
33.  Specifically, demand number 33 requests
all documents regarding “contracts and/or purchase orders between [Defendant]
and Lockheed for the Lockheed ‘Rainbow Fittings[.]’”  (Kakoian Decl., Ex. C, Pl. First Amended
Notice of Dep., pp. 14:28-13:2.)  It
appears to the court that, based on Plaintiff’s declaration, Defendant produced
those contracts.  (Maijala Decl., ¶ 11,
p. 13:1, 13:9-11 [Defendant produced “[a] number of Lockheed contracts with
Mulgrew”].)  Plaintiff has not shown that
the Department of Defense contracts or other documents referenced therein should
have been produced.  Plaintiff did not,
for example, establish that the documents referenced in the contracts between
Defendant and Lockheed Martin are part of the contracts themselves.  Instead, Plaintiff has identified only
documents that were referenced in those contracts. 
Thus, the court finds that Plaintiff has not shown that Defendant
engaged in conduct that is a misuse of the discovery process by not producing
documents referenced in the contracts between Defendant and Lockheed Martin.  (Sep. 8, 2023 Order, p. 3:9-15; March 4, 2024
Order, p. 5:18-26; Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (g).) 
9.    
Completed Traveler Documents for Lockheed
Rainbow Fittings (Request for Production No. 35)
The court finds that Plaintiff has shown that Defendant has in its
possession, custody, or control documents regarding completed traveler
documents for each production run of the Lockheed rainbow fittings that were
not produced as ordered by the court in its September 8, 2023 and March 4, 2024
orders.  (Sep. 8, 2023 Order, p. 3:9-15;
March 4, 2024 Order, p. 5:18-25; Kakoian Decl., Ex. C, Pl. First Amended Notice
of Dep., p. 15:6-9 [Request No. 35].) 
Plaintiff asserts that responsive documents exist but were not
produced in connection with this demand. 
Specifically, Plaintiff states that Traveler J/N 21271 and Traveler Job
No. “TEST1” have not been produced. 
(Maijala Decl., ¶ 12, p. 14:14-16.) 
Plaintiff has explained that TEST1 “was a Traveler created in response
to [Plaintiff’s] proposed corrective action to fix several of the violations
[Defendant] repeatedly conducted on Rainbow Fittings[,]” and that this traveler
“was created to process Rainbow Fitting in accordance with the corrective
action and determine its validity.” 
(Maijala Decl., ¶ 12, p. 15:8-11.)  The court finds that Plaintiff’s assertions,
made in his declaration, that the traveler was created in response to
Plaintiff’s own proposed corrective actions establish that Plaintiff has
knowledge that this document exists.  Moreover,
Plaintiff’s supplemental declaration also establishes the existence of this
document based on Plaintiff’s assertion that the TEST1 traveler “is referenced
in Mulgrew’s own document with Bates No. MACI007675.”  (Maijala Supp. Decl., ¶ 11, p.
12:24-26.)  Defendant did not produce
sufficient evidence, independent of its counsel’s conclusory assertion that
there exist no other responsive documents that have not been produced,
establishing that these documents do not exist.  (Nenni Decl., ¶ 24.)  The court further finds that Plaintiff has
shown that this document was not produced.[2]  (Maijala Decl., ¶ 12, p. 15:18-20; Maijala
Supp. Decl., ¶ 11, p. 12:23-25 [“As of the May 20, 2024 and the May 24, 2024
document productions, , an important Traveler for Job. No. ‘TEST1’ is still not
produced”].) 
Thus, the court finds that Defendant engaged in conduct that is a
misuse of the discovery process by failing to comply with the court’s order to
produce documents responsive to Requests for Production of Documents, number 35
no later than March 29, 2024.  (Sep. 8,
2023 Order, p. 3:9-15; March 4, 2024 Order, p. 5:18-25; Code Civ. Proc., §
2023.010, subd. (g).)  The court further
finds that Plaintiff has demonstrated that he has suffered a low level of
prejudice as a result of this conduct because he has stated that the
TEST1  documents will show whether
Defendant completed the corrective action experiment.  (Maijala Decl., ¶ 12, p. 15:12-13.) 
 
10.  AS9100
System Audit Documentation (Request for Production No. 41)
The court finds that Plaintiff has not met his burden to show that
documents responsive to Request for Production number 41, which demands the
production of all documents regarding the AS9100 system audit documentation
conducted by International Standards Authority, Inc., exist but were not
produced.  (Sep. 8, 2023 Order, p.
3:9-15; March 4, 2024 Order, p. 5:18-26; Kakoian Decl., Ex. C, Pl. First
Amended Notice of Dep., p. 16:4-6 [Request No. 41].)   
Plaintiff asserts that Defendant “produced only partial audit reports
for the years 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019[,]” and that the audit nonconformities
documentation issued during each audit is missing.  (Maijala Decl., ¶ 13, p. 15:25-27.)  Specifically, Plaintiff states that five
nonconformities are missing from 2016, five nonconformities are missing from
2017, and unknown number are missing from 2018, and 10 nonconformities are
missing from 2019.  (Maijala Decl., ¶ 13,
p. 15:27-28.)  However, while Plaintiff
appears to identify a certain number of missing nonconformities, Plaintiff did
not produce sufficient evidence establishing that that he has knowledge that
such nonconformities exist, such that the court can make a determination that
Defendant failed to comply with the court’s orders to produce documents
responsive to demand number 41.  (Maijala
Decl., ¶ 13, p. 16:28-17:2 [stating that Plaintiff knows the documents were
withheld because they were not found in the produced documents].) 
Thus, the court finds that Plaintiff has not shown that Defendant
engaged in conduct that is a misuse of the discovery process by failing to
produce nonconformities documents in response to Request for Production of
Documents, number 41.  
11.  Lockheed
Annual Surveys or Audits of Mulgrew (Request for Production No. 43)
The court finds that Plaintiff has not met his burden to show that
documents responsive to Request for Production number 43, which demands the
production of all documents regarding completed Lockheed Martin annual surveys
or audits of Defendant for approval under Lockheed specification STP51-302,
exist but were not produced.  (Sep. 8,
2023 Order, p. 3:9-15 [limiting production to period of time between May 1,
2016 through October 10, 2019]; March 4, 2024 Order, p. 5:18-26; Kakoian Decl.,
Ex. C, Pl. First Amended Notice of Dep., p. 16:12-16 [Request No. 43].) 
Defendant produced to Plaintiff one survey dated 2017 and one undated
survey, both of which omit the surveyor. 
(Maijala Decl., ¶ 14, p. 17:7-9.) 
The court acknowledges that Plaintiff contends that the survey documents
will “demonstrate that [Defendant] was subjected to periodic assessments to
maintain the approval status to form Lockheed parts they received from Lockheed.”  (Maijala Decl., ¶ 14, p. 17:10-12.)  However, Plaintiff has not presented evidence
establishing that Lockheed Martin completed annual surveys or audits of
Defendant for the years 2016 and 2018-2019. 
Plaintiff did not, for example, state that he had knowledge that
Lockheed Martin performed surveys or audits of Defendant for those years, or
that Defendant asserted that Lockheed Martin completed those surveys in
response to discovery (e.g., interrogatories or requests for admission).  
Thus, the court finds that Plaintiff has not shown that Defendant
engaged in conduct that is a misuse of the discovery process by failing to
produce completed Lockheed Martin surveys or audits for the years 2016 and
2018-2019.
12.  Penetrant
Inspection Results for Lockheed Wing Joint Fitting a/k/a Rainbow Fittings
(Requests for Production Nos. 120 and 124)
The court finds that Plaintiff has not shown that Defendant has
in its possession, custody, or control documents responsive to Requests for
Production of Documents, numbers 120 and 124, which demand, respectively, the
production of all documents regarding the Penetrant Inspection Results provided
to Defendant by its subcontractors for the Lockheed Martin wing joint fitting,
a/k/a rainbow fittings, that were not produced as ordered by the court in its
September 8, 2023 and March 4, 2024 orders. 
(Sep. 8, 2023 Order, p. 3:9-15 [limiting production to period of time
between May 1, 2016 through October 10, 2019]; March 4, 2024 Order, p. 5:18-26;
Kakoian Decl., Ex. C, Pl. First Amended Notice of Dep., pp. 29:7-11 [Request
No. 120 as to part number 3339709-2], 30:1-5 [Request No. 124 as to part number
3339709-2].) 
Plaintiff has presented his declaration, in which he states that (1)
although Defendant produced some penetrant inspection results, not all of the
traveler documents were accompanied by the associated penetrant inspection
results, and (2) specifically, the penetrant inspection results for Traveler
J/N 21271 and Traveler Job. No. TEST1 – as referenced in MACI007675 – were not
produced.  (Maijala Decl., ¶ 15, pp.
18:25-26, 19:7-11.)  However, Plaintiff
has not submitted evidence establishing the penetrant inspection results for
those traveler documents exist. 
Plaintiff did not, for example, present evidence establishing that all
traveler documents are accompanied by such results and that the results
associated with the two travelers identified above were omitted from
Defendant’s production.   
The court therefore finds that that Plaintiff has not shown that the
penetrant inspection results associated with the specified travelers exist but
were not produced in Defendant’s initial production and the May 20, 2024 and
May 24, 2024 productions.  (Maijala
Decl., ¶ 15; Maijala Supp. Decl., ¶ 14, pp. 16:24-17:20.)
13.  Terminating
Sanctions Are Not Appropriate
As set forth above, the court finds that Plaintiff has met his burden
to show that Defendant violated the court’s September 8, 2023 and March 4, 2024
orders by failing to produce, within the time required by the court (i.e., at a
deposition to be taken no later than March 29, 2024), all documents responsive
to Requests for Production of Documents, numbers 7, 13, 32, 35, 38-39, and 69
set forth in Plaintiff’s First Amended Notice of Deposition. 
“The
trial court may order a terminating sanction for discovery abuse ‘after
considering the totality of the circumstances: [the] conduct of the party to
determine if the actions were willful; the detriment to the propounding party;
and the number of formal and informal attempts to obtain the discovery.’”¿ (Los
Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez (2014) 223 Cal. App. 4th 377, 390, quoting Lang
v. Hochman (2000) 77 Cal. App. 4th 1225, 1246.)¿ “Generally, ‘[a] decision
to order terminating sanctions should not be made lightly.¿ But where a
violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows
that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery
rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction.’”¿ (Los
Defensores, supra, 223 Cal. App. 4th at p. 390 [citation
omitted].)¿¿¿¿¿ 
After
considering the totality of the circumstances, the court finds that terminating
sanctions against Defendant are not warranted. 
First, the evidence establishes that Defendant partially complied with
the court’s orders to produce documents at the deposition of its person(s) most
qualified.  
Second, as
to the documents that Plaintiff has established exist but were not produced,
Plaintiff has either (1) had the resulting prejudice remedied by Defendant’s
subsequent production (Request No. 39), (2) not identified prejudice suffered
as a result of Defendant’s conduct (Request Nos. 33, 38, and 69), or (3)
identified only a low level of prejudice suffered as a result of Defendant’s
conduct (Request Nos. 7, 13, and 35). 
Thus, the court finds that Plaintiff has not met his burden to show that
terminating sanctions are required to protect Plaintiff’s interests.  (Victor Valley Union High School District
v. Superior Court of San Bernardino County (2023) 91 Cal.App.5th 1121, 1158
[discovery sanctions “should not exceed that which is required to protect the
interests of the party entitled to but denied discovery”] [internal quotations
and citations omitted].) 
Third,
Plaintiff has not shown that Defendant’s violation of the court’s orders is
preceded by a history of abuse.  (Los Defensores, supra, 223 Cal. App. 4th at p.
390.)  The court found, in its March 4,
2024 order denying Plaintiff’s first motion for terminating sanctions, that
Defendant did not willfully disobey the court’s September 8, 2023 order because
(1) Plaintiff did not show that he noticed a deposition for Defendant’s
person(s) most qualified for which Defendant did not appear or produce
documents, and (2) the court did not set a date by which Defendant was required
to comply with that order.  (March 4,
2024 Order, pp. 3:19-4:2.)  
Fourth, Plaintiff
has not shown that less severe sanctions—such as evidence or issue sanctions—would
not remedy the prejudice suffered as a result of Defendant’s failure to produce
the remaining responsive documents and would not produce compliance with the
court’s orders and the discovery process.  (Los Defensores, supra, 223 Cal. App. 4th at p.
390.)  Moreover, Plaintiff did not
request that the court impose issue or evidence sanctions as an alternative to
his request for terminating sanctions.  
Finally,
the court has not yet imposed less severe sanctions against Defendant in
connection with the production of these documents.  (Sep. 8, 2023 Order, p. 3:25 [“The court
denies all requests for sanctions”]; March 4, 2024 Order, p. 4:5-6 [“The court
denies Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions”]; Victor Valley Union
High School District, supra, 91 Cal.App.5th at p. 1158 [“The
discovery statutes evince an incremental approach to discovery sanctions,
starting with monetary sanctions and ending with the ultimate sanction of
termination”] [internal quotations and citations omitted].) 
The court
therefore denies Plaintiff’s request that the court impose terminating
sanctions against Defendant.  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (d).)  
14.  Monetary
Sanctions Are Appropriate 
The court finds that Plaintiff has shown that monetary sanctions
against Defendant are appropriate.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (a).)  The
court finds that $6,225 ((11 hours x Kakoian’s $350 hourly rate) + (5 hours x
Amkraut’s $475 hourly rate)) is a reasonable amount of sanctions to impose
against Defendant.  (Kakoian Decl., ¶ 14;
Amkraut Decl., ¶¶ 2-3.)
The court denies Defendant’s request that the court award monetary
sanctions in favor of Defendant and against Plaintiff in the amount of
$5,425.  (Opp., p. 19:7.) 
ORDER
            The court denies plaintiff
David Maijala’s motion for terminating sanctions.
            The court grants plaintiff David
Maijala’s motion for monetary sanctions. 
            The court orders defendant Mulgrew
Aircraft Components, Inc. to pay monetary sanctions in the amount of $6,225 to
plaintiff David Maijala within 30 days of the date of this order. 
            The court orders plaintiff David
Maijala to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
 
DATED:  July 30, 2024
