And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling is a summary of the judge's decisions regarding the demurrer and motion to strike filed by the defendants. The plaintiff, Wesley Barry Ross and Candy Peak Ross, brought a lawsuit against the defendants, Arolyn Burns, individually and as representative of the Arolyn Burns Trust, and Park California Condominium Association, Inc., alleging various causes of action, including fraud and breach of contract. The defendants demurred to the plaintiff's eighth cause of action for fraud, arguing that it is not pled with the required specificity. The court, however, found that the allegations are sufficient to state a cause of action for fraud through concealment. The defendants also moved to strike punitive damages from the complaint, but the court denied the motion, finding that the plaintiff has sufficiently pled a cause of action for punitive damages.
