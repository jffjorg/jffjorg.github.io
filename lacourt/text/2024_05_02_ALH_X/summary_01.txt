And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Armine Vartanyan v. Law Office of Marilyn Smith, et al. The plaintiff, Armine Vartanyan, has moved for an order compelling the defendant, Marilyn M. Smith, to provide responses to form interrogatories. The court has ruled that the motion is moot because the defendant has already provided the required responses. The plaintiff has also requested sanctions against the defendant for the cost of researching and preparing the motion. The court has denied the request for sanctions, finding that the imposition of sanctions against the defendant would be unjust. The court has also denied the plaintiff's request for sanctions against the defendant's counsel, finding that the counsel's failure to timely serve the responses was due to his own mistake. The court's ruling is subject to change and will be reconsidered when the parties submit their final arguments.
