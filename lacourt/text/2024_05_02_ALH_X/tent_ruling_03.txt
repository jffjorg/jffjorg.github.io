            Moving Defendants demur
to Plaintiffs’ eighth cause of action for fraud and move to strike punitive
damages from the Complaint.
 
BACKGROUND
 
On September 26, 2023, Plaintiffs this
action against Moving Defendants and Park California Condominium
Association, Inc. alleging causes of action for (1) breach of contract, (2)
breach of implied warranty of habitability, (3) breach of covenant of quiet
enjoyment, (4) negligence, (5) constructive eviction, (6) business &
professions code section 17200 et seq., (7) violation of Civil Code section
1941.1, (8) fraud, and (9) breach of CC&RS. Plaintiffs allege that Moving
Defendants knowingly rented an uninhabitable property to them. 
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
Moving Defendants’ demurrer to
Plaintiffs’ eighth cause of action for fraud is OVERRULED.
 
            Moving
Defendants’ motion to strike punitive damages is DENIED. 
 
LEGAL STANDARD
 
Demurrer
 
A general
demurrer may be taken to a complaint where “[t]he pleading does not state facts sufficient to
constitute a cause of action.” (Code of Civ. Proc. § 430.10(e).) A demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the
complaint states a cause of action.  (Hahn
v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal. App. 4th 740, 747.) In a demurrer proceeding, the
defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading or by proper judicial
notice.  (Code Civ. Proc. section
430.30(a).)  A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or
other extrinsic matters.  (SKF Farms v. Superior Court (1984) 153
Cal. App. 3d 902, 905.)  The only issue involved in a demurrer hearing is
whether the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous matters,
states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda,
supra, 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.)
 
Motion to Strike
 
Any party, within the time allowed to respond to a pleading may serve and
file a notice of motion to strike a pleading or any part thereof.¿ (Code Civ.
Proc., § 435, subd. (b)(1).)¿ The court¿may, upon a motion, or at any time in
its discretion, and upon terms it deems proper, strike any irrelevant, false,
or improper matter inserted in any pleading.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 436, subd.
(a).)¿ The court may also strike all or any part of any pleading not drawn or
filed in conformity with California law, a court rule, or an order of the court.¿
(Code Civ. Proc., § 436, subd. (b).)¿ An immaterial or irrelevant allegation is
one that is not essential to the statement of a claim or defense; is neither
pertinent to nor supported by an otherwise sufficient claim or defense; or a
demand for judgment requesting relief not supported by the allegations of the
complaint.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., 431.10, subd. (b).)¿ The grounds for moving to
strike must appear on the face of the pleading or by way of judicial notice.¿
(Code Civ. Proc., § 437.)
 
 
DISCUSSION
 
Fraud
 
            Moving Defendants demur to Plaintiffs’ eighth cause of action for fraud
arguing that the cause of action is not pled with the required specificity. 
 
“The elements of fraud are: “(a)
misrepresentation (false representation, concealment, or nondisclosure); (b)
knowledge of falsity (or ‘scienter’); (c) intent to defraud, i.e., to induce
reliance; (d) justifiable reliance; and (e) resulting damage.” (Charnay v.
Cobert (2006) 145 Cal.App.4th 170, 184.) In California, fraud, including
negligent misrepresentation, must be pled with specificity. (Small v. Fritz
Companies, Inc. (2003) 30 Cal.4th 167, 184.) “The particularity demands
that a plaintiff plead facts which show how, when, where, to whom, and by what
means the representations were tendered.” (Cansino v. Bank of America
(2014) 224 Cal.App.4th 1462, 1469.)
 
However, an exception to the
specificity rule arises “where it appears from the nature of the allegations
that the defendant must necessarily possess full information concerning the
facts of the controversy.” (Bradley v. Hartford Acc. & Indem. Co.
(1973) 30 Cal.App.3d 818, 825 (disapproved of on separate grounds in Silberg
v. Anderson (1990) 50 Cal.3d 205).) 
 
“[T]o establish fraud through
nondisclosure or concealment of facts, it is necessary to show the defendant
‘was under a legal duty to disclose them.’” (OCM Principal Opportunities
Fund v. CIBC World Markets Corp. (2007) 157 Cal.App.4th 835, 845.)
Nondisclosure or concealment may constitute actionable fraud when: (1) there is
a fiduciary relationship between the parties; (2) the defendant had exclusive
knowledge of material facts not known to the plaintiff; (3) the defendant
actively conceals a material fact from the plaintiff; and (4) the defendant
makes partial representations but also suppresses some material facts. (See Los
Angeles Memorial Coliseum Commission v. Insomniac, Inc. (2015) 233
Cal.App.4th 803, 831.)
 
The Court finds the allegations
sufficient to state a cause of action of fraud through concealment at this
pleading stage. (Complaint, ¶¶89-94.)
 
Accordingly, the demurrer to the
eighth cause of action is OVERRULED.
 
            Punitive
Damages
 
            Moving
Defendants also move to strike punitive damages from the Complaint. 
 
Punitive damages are available in
noncontract cases where the defendant is guilty of “oppression, fraud,
or malice.” (Civ. Code § 3294(a), emphasis added.)  Conclusory allegations are insufficient to
support a claim for punitive damages. (See, e.g., Fisher v. San Pedro Peninsula Hospital (1989) 214 Cal. App. 3d 590,
620.)  However, “the stricken language
must be read not in isolation, but in the context of the facts alleged in the
rest of petitioner's complaint.” (Perkins
v. Superior Court (1981) 117 Cal. App. 3d 1, 6.)
 
            As
Plaintiffs have sufficiently pled a cause of action for fraud, Plaintiffs have
also sufficiently alleged a claim for punitive damages based thereon. 
 
            Accordingly,
the motion to strike is DENIED.
 
CONCLUSION
 
            Moving
Defendants’ demurrer to Plaintiffs’ eighth cause of action for fraud is OVERRULED.
 
            Moving
Defendants’ motion to strike punitive damages is DENIED. 
 
            Moving
Party to give notice.
