Here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling addresses a demurrer filed by the defendants (Ford Motor Company, Cerritos Ford, Inc., and Norm Reeves Ford Superstore) to the sixth cause of action for fraudulent concealment and the fifth cause of action for negligent repair. The court finds that the fraudulent concealment claim is not barred by the economic loss rule, as the plaintiff has pled fraudulent concealment with adequate particularity. However, the court sustains the demurrer to the fifth cause of action for negligent repair, as the plaintiff's damages appear to be solely economic losses, which are barred by the economic loss rule. The court grants the defendants 20 days to amend their demurrer.
