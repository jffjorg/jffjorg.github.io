English-text summary:
The Judge grants the Plaintiff's Motion to Expunge Lis Pendens, which was filed after judgment was entered in favor of the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff had moved to expunge the notice of lis pendens recorded against the subject property. The Judge found that the Plaintiff had presented sufficient evidence to prove actual possession, open and notorious possession, or continuous physical occupation of the property. The Judge also found that the Plaintiff had not acted with substantial justification in opposing the motion, and therefore denied the Plaintiff's request for attorney's fees and costs.
