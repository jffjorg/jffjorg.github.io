And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made several tentative rulings on various motions in limine filed by the parties. With respect to the first motion, the judge has granted the plaintiff's request to exclude evidence of her prior lawsuit against her former employer. The judge finds that this evidence is improper character evidence under Evidence Code § 1101 and unduly prejudicial, confusing, and time-consuming under Evidence Code § 352.

With respect to the second motion, the judge has granted the plaintiff's request to exclude evidence of claims or parties no longer at issue, but has denied the request as to evidence mentioning Select Medical in documents and other evidence, subject to the plaintiff's right to object to specific evidence offered at trial.

With respect to the third motion, the judge has denied the defendant's request to exclude "me too" evidence, finding that such evidence may be admissible under Evidence Code § 402 to prove the defendant's discriminatory intent. The judge has also ruled that the testimony of Stacy Duncan and Andree Leroy, as well as part of the proposed testimony of Wendy-Ann Sylvester, M.D., is admissible as "me too" evidence.

Finally, with respect to the fourth motion, the judge has granted the defendant's request to exclude evidence related to other lawsuits or settlements involving the defendants, but has denied the request as to evidence related to Dr. Saecho's misconduct and the defendant's failure to remedy it. The judge has also ruled that the litigation process of the lawsuit brought against the defendants by Wendy-Ann Sylvester, M.D., is likely to be wholly irrelevant to any issue in this action.
