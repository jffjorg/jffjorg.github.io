And here is the English-text summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge's tentative ruling addresses two issues: the filing of redacted documents and the delay in deposing damages expert Howard Grobstein. The Judge finds that the filing of redacted documents without a court order violates the California Rules of Court, and orders the parties to file motions to seal any redacted documents. The Judge also denies the Defendant's motion to exclude the expert witness, Howard Grobstein, due to a one-month delay in his deposition, finding that there are less prejudicial ways to handle the delay. The Judge continues the hearing on the motion for summary judgment to a later date, and orders the parties to file their motions to seal and briefs according to code.
