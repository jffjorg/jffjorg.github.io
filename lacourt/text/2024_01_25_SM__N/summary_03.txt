And here is the English-text summary:

The Court's tentative ruling grants Defendant Collision Craft, Inc.'s motion for judgment on the pleadings, without leave to amend. The Court finds that the claims at issue in this action are barred by res judicata, as the same parties are involved in a prior action (Case No. 22SMCV01311). The doctrine of res judicata prevents relitigation of the same cause of action, and the Court finds that the judgment in the prior case serves as a bar to further litigation. The Court also finds that Plaintiff's contention that Code of Civil Procedure section 1179.05, subdivision (c), allowed for tolling is not well taken. As a result, Plaintiff is only entitled to seek unpaid rent for the period of January 6, 2022, and after, and only some of the notices seek rent for the allowed period.
