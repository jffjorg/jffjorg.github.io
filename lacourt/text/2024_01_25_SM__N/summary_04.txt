Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, Clare Matrix, has filed a demurrer to the complaint of Bradmore Lincoln, LLC, alleging breach of lease and damages. The judge has ruled that the demurrer is overruled. Clare Matrix is required to file and serve an answer to the complaint within 10 days of the entry of this order. The judge has also granted Clare Matrix's request for judicial notice of a prior action, but has determined that the doctrine of res judicata does not bar the present action. The judge has found that the settlement agreement in the prior action does not indicate that the amounts sought in this action were part of the settlement, and therefore the doctrine of res judicata does not apply.
