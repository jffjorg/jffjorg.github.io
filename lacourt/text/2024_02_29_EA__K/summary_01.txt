Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants Defendant Health Net of California, Inc.'s motion to compel arbitration and stay the case pending completion of the arbitration. The court finds that the arbitration clause in the Health Net HMO plans is valid and applicable to the claims brought by Plaintiff Ning Sun. Plaintiff's claims arise from alleged improper provider referrals and delayed medical treatment under his Health Net plans. The court rejects Plaintiff's argument that Defendant's removal of the case to federal court constitutes a waiver of arbitration. The case is stayed, pending completion of the arbitration.
