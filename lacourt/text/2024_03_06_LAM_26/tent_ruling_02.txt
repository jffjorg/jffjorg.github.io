[TENTATIVE] ORDER RE:
APPLICATION FOR AN ORDER PERMITTING CHIARA TONDI
  RESTA AS COUNSEL PRO HAC VICE 
 



 
Chiara Tondi Resta (“Resta”) applies
as counsel pro hac vice for Defendant
XL Specialty Insurance Company.  The
application is unopposed. 
Under California Rules of Court, Rule 9.40,
attorneys licensed and in good standing in other states may, upon the
California court’s approval, appear as counsel pro hac vice in a pending case if an active member of the state bar
is associated as attorney of record. 
(CRC 9.40(a).)  Resta is an active member, in good standing, of the District of
Columbia and the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. (Resta Decl. ¶¶ 4-5.)  In addition, Resta states that she is not a
resident of California or regularly engaged in business in California.  (Resta Decl. ¶ 2.)  Resta is a resident of Washington, DC with an
office in Washington, DC.  (Resta Decl. ¶¶ 2-3.)  Resta states that she has filed applications
to appear pro hac vice in California within the last two years in
Cardenas Markets LLC v. Houston Casualty Company, U.S. District Court,
Central District of California, case number 5:23-cv00682 which was granted on
June 27, 2023.  (Resta Decl. ¶ 6.)  Thus, Counsel satisfies the eligibility
requirements of CRC 9.40(a).
Resta’s application successfully addresses all six
content requirements outlined in CRC 9.40(d). 
Specifically, Resta provides
in her application: (1) her residence and office address (Resta Decl. ¶¶ 2-3); (2) the courts to which Resta has been admitted to practice and the dates
of admission (Resta Decl. ¶ 4); (3) that Resta is a member in good standing in
those courts (Resta Decl. ¶ 3); (4) that she is not currently suspended or
disbarred in any court (Resta Decl. ¶ 5); (5) the title of each court and cause
in which the applicant has filed an application to appear as counsel pro
hac vice in this state in the preceding two years, and whether or not
it was granted if any (Resta Decl. ¶ 6); and (6) the name, address, and
telephone number of an active member, James P. Koelzer of the State Bar of
California who is the current counsel of record for Defendant XL Specialty Insurance
Company.  (Resta Decl. ¶ 7).
Furthermore, Resta demonstrates that she has met the requirement of CRC 9.40(c)(1). That rule
provides: “a person desiring to appear as counsel pro hac vice in a superior court must file with the court a
verified application together with proof of service . . . of a copy of the
application and of the notice on all parties who have appeared in the cause and
on the State Bar of California at its San Francisco office.”  (See Koelzer Decl. ¶ 4.)
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
The application of Chiara Tondi Resta to appear as counsel pro hac vice for Defendant XL Specialty Insurance
Company is GRANTED.
Moving
Party is ordered to
give notice and file a proof of service of such.
