And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling addresses a motion for sanctions filed by Defendant Jack Chao, who claims that Plaintiff Lei Cui's complaint is frivolous. The court denied the motion, finding that the default entered against Defendant on September 19, 2023, was properly entered. The court noted that Defendant did not file a declaration to extend time to respond to the complaint, as required by California Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41. The court also found that Defendant's contentions that he relied on promises of further extensions by Plaintiff's counsel, which were not kept, do not suffice to demonstrate that the default is void and should be set aside. As a result, the court denied the motion for sanctions and scheduled a hearing on the tentative ruling.
