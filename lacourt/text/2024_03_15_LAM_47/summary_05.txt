**Tentative Ruling Summary**

The court grants Plaintiff's motion to strike Defendant's unverified answer, and also strikes Defendant's second, unauthorized answer. The court orders Defendant to file an amended answer that is verified and addresses each allegation in the complaint individually within 20 days. The court finds that denying Defendant an opportunity to cure the defects in the answer would be unjust, given Defendant's claim that she is the victim of identity fraud and is therefore not a proper defendant.
