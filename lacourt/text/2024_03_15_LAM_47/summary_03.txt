And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Court's tentative ruling grants in part the Defendant's motion to compel further responses to form interrogatories. Specifically, the Court orders the Plaintiff to provide verified, code-compliant supplemental responses within 20 days of this order with respect to Form Interrogatory No. 17.1 and Request for Admission No. 12 only.

The Court finds that the Plaintiff's responses to the Defendant's form interrogatories are inadequate and evasive, particularly with respect to Request No. 10 and Request No. 12. The Court is not persuaded by the Plaintiff's arguments that the responses are complete and sufficient.

The Court also denies the Defendant's request for sanctions, finding that neither party fully prevailed on the motion. The Court concludes that the Defendant's motion to compel further responses is granted in part, and the Plaintiff must provide further responses to the form interrogatories as ordered.
