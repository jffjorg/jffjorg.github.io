CASE
HISTORY:
·        
06/09/23: Complaint filed. 
 
STATEMENT
OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
            This is an action for breach of contract concerning Defendants’ failure
to repay and guarantee a loan agreement codified in two promissory notes dated
March 5, 2020 and June 7, 2020. 
 
Defendant Jack Chao moves for
sanctions for filing what he contends is a frivolous Complaint. 
            
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Defendant Jack Chao moves for
sanctions for filing what he contends is a frivolous Complaint. 
 
Defendant Chao was defaulted on September 19, 2023
pursuant to a Request for Entry of Default filed on that date. Although
Defendant contends in the reply papers that this default was improperly
procured in the face of a request for an extension from Plaintiff pursuant to
Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41, that argument is unpersuasive.
Plaintiff filed proof of service on September 19 stating that Defendant was
served via substituted service with the Summons and Complaint on July 26, 2023.
(Proof of Substituted Service.) To secure an automatic extension of the time to
respond to a complaint, a party must serve and file a declaration stating that
a good faith attempt to meet and confer regarding a demurrer was made and
explaining why the parties could not meet and confer. (Code Civ. Proc. §
430.41(a)(2).) That declaration must be served and filed on or before the last
day to demur to the complaint. (Id.) No such declaration was ever filed.
Defendant’s contentions that he relied on promises of further extensions by
Plaintiff’s counsel which were not kept do not suffice to demonstrate that the
default is void and should be set aside on the Court’s own motion. (See Code
Civ. Proc. § 473(d).) Any challenge to the default on any other basis must be
made by a noticed motion pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 473. Unless
and until such relief is sought and granted, Defendant Chao has no standing to
bring this motion. 
 
            Accordingly,
Defendant’s Motion for Sanctions is DENIED. 
 
            Moving
Party to give notice.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.

            Any party may submit on the
tentative ruling by contacting the courtroom via email at Smcdept47@lacourt.org by no later than 4:00 p.m. the day
before the hearing. All interested parties must be copied on the email. It
should be noted that if you submit on a tentative ruling the court will still
conduct a hearing if any party appears. By submitting on the tentative you
have, in essence, waived your right to be present at the hearing, and you
should be aware that the court may not adopt the tentative, and may issue an
order which modifies the tentative ruling in whole or in part.
