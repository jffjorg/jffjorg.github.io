And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling of the Judge is that the Plaintiff, Pinto, is entitled to reasonable attorney's fees incurred as a result of the Defendant's former attorney, Murphy's, bad-faith delay tactics. Murphy filed multiple improper and frivolous motions to disqualify the court and notices of removal to federal court, which were filed solely to delay the court's ruling on Pinto's motion to declare Visconti a vexatious litigant and for an order to post a security bond or dismiss her cross-complaint. The Judge finds that Murphy's actions were motivated solely by an intention to harass or cause unnecessary delay, and that the motions were filed frequently the day before or the day of scheduled hearings, resulting in repeated continuances. The Judge orders Pinto to provide a declaration and supporting time records regarding the fees sought due solely to the bad-faith delay, and awards Pinto $73,083 in attorney's fees.
