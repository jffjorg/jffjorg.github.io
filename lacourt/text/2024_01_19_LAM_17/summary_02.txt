And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling denies the plaintiff's motion to compel further deposition of Erik Limon. The plaintiff had filed a lawsuit against the County of Los Angeles alleging various forms of discrimination and failure to accommodate disability. The plaintiff's counsel served the motion to compel further deposition two months late and the court finds that this is untimely. Additionally, the court finds that the plaintiff has not shown good cause to compel further deposition as the deposition was already completed and the plaintiff's counsel did not ask relevant questions about the County's CFRA policies or CFRA complaints. The court cites various cases to support its decision, including Pelton-Shepherd Industries, Inc. v. Delta Packaging Products, Inc. (2008) and Golf & Tennis Pro Shop, Inc. v. Superior Court (2022).
