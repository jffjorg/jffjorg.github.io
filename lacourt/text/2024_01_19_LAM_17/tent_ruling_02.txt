race/national origin discrimination; (2) disability discrimination; (3) failure

CFRA – Interference with Family Leave Rights; (7) violation of CFRA –
retaliation; (8) failure to prevent/correct discrimination; and (9)
retaliation.
 
            Now,

            Plaintiff
moves to compel further deposition of Erik Limon. 
 
CCP section
2024.020 requires discovery motions to be heard on or before the 15th day
before the trial date. In this case, trial was set for August 21, 2023. As
such, any discovery motion had to be noticed for hearing on or before August 6,
2023, and served no later than July 14, 2023. Plaintiff counsel served it two
months later and noticed it to be heard four months after that. As the Court of
Appeal has ruled, “a party who notices a discovery motion to be heard after the
discovery motion cutoff date does not have a right to have the motion heard.” (Cottini
v. Enloe Med. Ctr. (2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 401, 420, quoting Pelton-Shepherd
Industries, Inc. v. Delta Packaging Products, Inc. (2008) 165 Cal.App.4th
1568, 1586.)
 
Although
discovery may have been reopened following the grant of a mistrial on September
29, 2023 (see Fairmont Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (2000) 22 Cal.4th
245), the present motion is still untimely, because it was served before the
Court declared the mistrial and relates to discovery proceedings that took
place long before the date initially set for trial. (See Golf & Tennis
Pro Shop, Inc. v. Superior Court (2022) 84 Cal. App. 5th 127, 137
(discovery motion deadlines are “mandatory and the court may not entertain a
belated motion to compel”).)
 
Moreover, on
a substantive level, Plaintiff has not shown good cause to compel further
deposition. Defendant’s opposition explains: 
 
When Mr.
Limon appeared for his deposition on August 9, 2023, Ms. Obienu’s counsel did
not ask him a single question about the County’s CFRA policies, or about any
CFRA complaints made by Ms. Obienu or other employees. Although the motion
includes brief excerpts from the deposition, it omits an important series of
questions, in which Mr. Limon made it clear that he was prepared to testify on
those very subjects…. inexplicably, Ms. Obienu’s counsel terminated the
deposition minutes later, without having asked any questions about the CFRA
policy or any complaints. A review of the complete transcript shows that Mr.
Limon answered every question asked of him, that he never responded he did not
know the answer to a question, and that counsel objected to a few questions,
but never instructed Mr. Limon not to answer. The documents related to the
subject matter that Mr. Limon was to testify on were provided to Ms. Obienu’s
counsel before the deposition started. 
 
            (House
Decl. ¶ 4.) 
 
By contrast,
in Maldonado v. Superior Court (2002) 94 Cal.App.4th 1390, 1396, a case
cited in support by Plaintiff, the witnesses produced at deposition “knew very
little about the topics specified in the notices,” and did not produce the
documents they had been requested to bring with to bring with them. 
 
Based on the
foregoing, Plaintiff’s motion to compel further deposition is denied. 
 
 
It is so ordered.
