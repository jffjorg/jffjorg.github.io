Case No. 24PSCV00895


ORDER ON MOTION
TO COMPEL
Plaintiff Fernando Guerrero Jr.’s Motion to Compel the Deposition of
Defendant’s Person Most Qualified is GRANTED in part. The parties are directed
to further meet and confer as to the categories of documents, following a
review of the Department H Case Management Conference Standing Order. 
 
Background 
 
Plaintiff Fernando
Guerrero Jr. (“Plaintiff”) alleges as follows: 
 
On December 22, 2021, Plaintiff
purchased a 2022 Jeep Wagoneer, VIN No. 1C4SJVBT0NS104042 (“subject vehicle”).
The subject vehicle suffers from various defects which have not been repaired
within a reasonable number of attempts.
 
On March 22, 2024, Plaintiff filed a complaint,
asserting causes of action against FCA US LLC (“Defendant”) and Does 1-50 for: (1)
Violation of Subdivision (d) of Civil Code section 1793.2, (2) Violation of
Subdivision (b) of Civil Code section 1793.2. (3) Violation of Subdivision
(a)(3) of Civil Code section 1793.2, (4) Breach of Express Written Warranty
(Civil Code section 1791.2  subdivision
(a); section 1794), and (5) Breach of the Implied Warranty of Merchantability
(Civil Code section 1791.1; section 1794).
 
Pending before the Court is Plaintiff’s motion to
compel the deposition of Defendant’s Personal Most Qualified (“PMQ”). For the
reasons stated herein, the motion is granted in part.



Legal
Standard
“If the deponent named is not a
natural person, the deposition notice shall describe with reasonable
particularity the matters on which examination is requested. In that event, the
deponent shall designate and produce at the deposition those of its officers,
directors, managing agents, employees, or agents who are most qualified to
testify on its behalf as to those matters to the extent of any information
known or reasonably available to the deponent.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.230).
“If, after service of a
deposition notice, . . . a person designated by an organization that is a party
under Section 2025.230, without having served a valid objection. . ., fails to
appear for examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for inspection any
document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the
deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move for an order compelling
the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the production for inspection of
any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in
the deposition notice.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (a).)
“A motion
under subdivision (a) shall comply with both of the following:
(1) The
motion shall set forth specific facts showing good cause justifying the
production for inspection of any document, electronically stored information,
or tangible thing described in the deposition notice.
(2) The motion shall be
accompanied by a meet and confer declaration. . ., or, when the deponent fails
to attend the deposition and produce the documents, electronically stored
information, or things described in the deposition notice, by a declaration stating
that the petitioner has contracted the deponent to inquire about the
nonappearance.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (b).)
“If a
motion under subdivision (a) is granted, the court shall impose a monetary
sanction. . ., unless the court finds that the one subject to the sanction
acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the
imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450,
subd. (g)(1).)
 
Discussion
Plaintiff moves the Court, per
Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.450, for an order compelling Defendant to
designate and produce for deposition its PMQ on all categories identified in
Plaintiff’s “Notice of Deposition of the Person Most Qualified for FCA US, LLC
and Demand to Produce Documents at Deposition” (“Deposition Notice”). 
Plaintiffs’ counsel Mark W.
Gibson (“Gibson”) represents, and/or the accompanying exhibits reflect, as
follows:
On June 4,
2024, Plaintiff served Defendant with the Deposition Notice, setting the
deposition for August 16, 2024. (Gibson Decl., ¶ 11, Exh. 2.) Plaintiff never
received an objection to the deposition. (Id.)
On August 16, 2024, Gibson requested a “Certificate of Non-Appearance.” (Id., ¶ 12, Exh. 3.) On August 19, 2024,
Gibson was served with the “Certificate of Non-Appearance.” (Id., ¶ 16, Exh. 5.) On October 10, 2024,
Gibson emailed Defendant’s counsel, requesting three available dates for the
deposition. (Id., ¶ 13, Exh. 4.) On
October 11, 14, 15 and 16, 2024, Gibson reiterated his request to Defendant’s
counsel. (Id., ¶ 14, Exh. 4.)
Defendant has failed to provide Plaintiff with any available deposition dates,
as of the October 18, 2024 motion filing date. (Id., ¶ 15).
In opposition, Defendant
argues that the motion should be denied because Defendant “has already proposed
a date to set the PMQ deposition.” Defendant goes on to suggest that Plaintiff
“seeks to manufacture a discovery dispute where there is none.” However, this
argument is not well-taken because Defendant did not offer a deposition
date until December 31, 2024—more than two months after Plaintiff’s motion was filed and five days after Defendant’s opposition was due.[FN] Moreover, the deposition
date offered (March 12, 2025) is almost seven months after the deposition date
that was initially noticed by Plaintiff.
Accordingly, the motion is
granted in part and the deposition is ordered to go forward. As to the
deposition date, the parties are ordered to meet and confer as to Defendant’s
proposed deposition date of March 12, 2025. Moreover, Defendant is instructed to
come prepared to the hearing with at least two alternative dates its PMQ is
available for deposition in February or March 2025. 
As to the categories of
documents sought in connection with the deposition, the parties are directed to
meet and confer, either in person or by telephone or videoconference call, and
file a status report by no later than January 31, 2025, to the extent that
there are remaining disputes. The Court is not inclined to require Defendant to
produce documents that go beyond the scope of its Case Management Standing
Order. (See
Department H Case Management Standing Order, Section D(2) (“Song-Beverly
Warranty Litigation”.)-------------[FN] Defendant filed an untimely opposition on January 3, 2025. At the time its opposition was due (December 26, 2024), it had not offered a deposition date.
