The settlements are for a total of $7,000 for Anthony Maldonado, $1,000 for Adriana Maldonado, and $7,000 for Allison Maldonado. The judge notes that the settlements are reasonable and that all necessary disclosures have been made. The judge's ruling is tentative and is subject to change after further review.
