"The court shall limit the scope of discovery if it determines that the burden, expense, or intrusiveness of that discovery clearly outweighs the likelihood that the information sought will lead to the discovery of admissible evidence." (CCP § 2017.020(a))
"Unless otherwise limited by order of the court in accordance with this title, any party may obtain discovery regarding any matter, not privileged, that is relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending action or to the determination of any motion made in that action, if the matter either is itself admissible in evidence or appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence." (CCP § 2017.010)

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the motion to compel further responses to requests for production of documents and has made a tentative ruling. The plaintiff, Miao Che, seeks to compel the defendant, Genesis Motor America, LLC, to provide further responses to requests for production of documents. The defendant has provided some responses, but the plaintiff argues that they are incomplete and inadequate.

The judge has denied the motion in part, granted it in part, and ordered oral argument on the remaining issues. The judge found that the plaintiff's requests for production of documents were overly broad and sought information that was not relevant to the case. The judge also found that the defendant's responses were inadequate and failed to provide sufficient information to support the plaintiff's claims.

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to request for production of document number 39, which seeks information about the defendant's contention and the facts and witnesses upon which it is based. The judge has also ordered the defendant to provide a verified further response to this request.

The judge has denied the motion to compel further responses to requests for production of documents numbers 6, 8, 12, and 20, finding that they were overly broad and sought information that was not relevant to the case. The judge has ordered oral argument on these issues and has suggested that the parties may need to narrow their requests for production of documents.

Overall, the judge's tentative ruling is that the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to requests for production of documents is denied in part, granted in part, and ordered to oral argument on the remaining issues.
