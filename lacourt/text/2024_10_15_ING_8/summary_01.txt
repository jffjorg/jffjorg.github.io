And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is granting the motions to compel further responses to Special Interrogatories, Set Two, and Requests for Production of Documents, Set Two. The motions were filed by Defendant Linxs, which is seeking to gather evidence to support its defense that Plaintiff was not a duly licensed contractor at all times during the performance of the project.

The judge finds that the interrogatories and requests for production of documents are discoverable and relevant to the case. The judge grants the motions to compel further responses, and orders Plaintiff to provide verified further responses within 30 days.

The judge also grants Defendant Linxs' request for monetary sanctions in the amount of $2,000, payable by Plaintiff and/or counsel for Plaintiff to counsel for Defendant within 30 days.

The judge notes that the discovery sought by Defendant Linxs is necessary to support its anticipated motion for summary judgment, and that Plaintiff's objections to the discovery are without substantial justification.
