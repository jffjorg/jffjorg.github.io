BACKGROUND  A.     Factual    On  June 21, 2024, Plaintiffs, Senia Mondragon, Adriana Maldonado, Allison  Maldonado, and Anthony Maldonado (collectively “Plaintiffs”) filed a complaint  against Elbert Watts Jr., and DOES 1 through 50. The complaint alleges one  cause of action for: (1) Motor Vehicle Negligence. The complaint is based on  the allegation that Defendant collided with Plaintiffs’ vehicle.    On  September 19, 2024, Plaintiffs filed three Petitions for Minor’s Compromise for  Anthony Maldonado, Adriana Maldonado, and Allison Maldonado (collectively,  “Minor Plaintiffs”).         B. Procedural    On September 19, 2024 and  September 20, 2024, Plaintiffs filed their Petition for Approval  of Compromise of Claim or Action or Disposition of Proceeds of Judgment for  Minor or Person with a Disability. To date, no opposition has been filed.    II. ANALYSIS    A.     Legal  Standard   Court approval is required  for all settlements of a minor’s claim. (Prob. Code §§ 3500, 3600, et seq.;  Code Civ. Proc. § 372.) “‘[W]ithout trial court approval of the proposed compromise of the ward’s  claim, the settlement cannot be valid.  [Citation.] [¶] Nor is the  settlement binding [on the minor] until it is endorsed by the trial court.’” (Pearson  v. Superior Court (2012) 202 Cal.App.4th 1333, 1338.) A minor, like  Claimant, “shall appear either by a guardian or conservator of the estate or by  a guardian ad litem appointed by the court in which the action or proceeding is  pending, or by a judge thereof, in each case.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 372, subd.  (a)(1).) Alternatively, the petitioner may file a declaration demonstrating  that he or she has a right to compromise the minor’s claim under Cal. Probate  Code section 3500.  Pursuant to  California Rules of Court (“CRC”) Rule 7.950, a petition for court approval of  a compromise of a pending action for a minor “mut be verified by the petitioner  and must contain a full disclosure of all information that has any bearing upon  the reasonableness of the compromise, covenant, settlement, or disposition.”    Regarding the substance of  the Petition, to obtain court approval of the settlement of a minor’s claims,  the petitioner must file a complete and “verified petition for approval  of the settlement and must disclose ‘all information that has any bearing upon  the reasonableness of the compromise.’ [Citations.]” (Barnes v. Western  Heritage Ins. Co. (2013) 217 Cal.App.4th 249, 256; Cal. Rules of Court,  rule 7.950.) (Italics added.)     B.      Discussion    Minor Plaintiffs’ guardian ad litem, Senia Mondragon, has filed  three Petitions for Approval of Compromise of Claim or Action or  Disposition of Proceeds of Judgment for Minor or Person with a Disability. The  Petitions indicates that Minor Plaintiffs’ claims are the subject of a pending  action or proceeding that will be compromised or settled without a trial.  Plaintiffs have included a filing of the Notice of Settlement.    The  Petitions assert that all three (3) Minor Plaintiffs have recovered completely  from the effects of the injuries described in item 6, and there are no  permanent injuries. It also notes that the Petitioners have made a careful and  diligent and investigation into the facts and circumstances of the incident or  accident in which the claimant was injured; the responsibility for the incident  or accident; and the nature, extent, and seriousness of the claimant’s  injuries. Petition notes that they understand that if the compromise proposed  in this petition is approved by this Court and consummated, the claimant will  never be able to recover any more compensation from the settling defendants  even if the claimant’s injuries turn out to be more serious than they now  appear.    The  court notes that the three (3) petitions note different and separate amounts  agreed to be paid by Defendant, Elbert Watts Jr.. The Petition for Anthony  Maldonado, the total amount offered to be paid by Defendant Watts is $7,000 per  paragraph 10. Under paragraph 12, the court notes that the claimant, Anthony  Maldonado has medical expenses as follows: (1) $2,879.38 for total medical  expenses before any reductions; (2) $105.38 in total medical expenses paid; (3)  $1,400.34 in total of negotiated, contractual, or statutory reductions; (4)  $1,479.04 in total medical expenses to be paid or reimbursed from the proceeds;  and (5) $1,479.04 total amount of statutory or contractual liens. This first  petition for Anothony Maldonado also indicates that $203.51 is to be paid to  Randolph & Associates for case cost, but that the total amount of attorneys  fees sought is $2,333.33. Thus, the net balance of proceeds for Anthony  Maldonado is $2,984.12 to be transferred to a custodian for the benefit of the  minor under the California Uniform Transfers to Minors Act. Attachment 18b(6)  indicates that Petitioner requests that the balance of the proceeds of Anthony  Maldonado’s settlement in the amount of $2,084.12 be transferred to Petitioner,  Senia Mondragon.    Next,  with the petition for Adriana Maldonado, the total amount offered to be paid by  Defendant per paragraph 10 is $1,000. There are no medical expenses claimed.  The total attorney cost per paragraph 13 states that $153.29 is to be paid to  Randolph & Associate, but that $333.33 is sought to be approved. Thus, the  net balance of the proceeds for Adriana Maldonado is $513.38. Attachment 18b(6)  indicates that Petitioner requests that the balance of the proceeds of Adriana  Maldonado’s settlement in the amount of $513.38 be transferred to Petitioner,  Senia Mondragon.    Lastly,  with the petition for Allison Maldonado, the total amount offered to be paid by  Defendant per paragraph 10 is $7,000. Under paragraph 12, the court notes that  the claimant, supposedly Allison Maldonado has medical expenses as follows: (1)  $2,444.42 for total medical expenses before any reductions; (2) $94.42 in total  medical expenses paid; (3) $1,273.60 in total of negotiated, contractual, or  statutory reductions; (4) $1,170.82 in total medical expenses to be paid or  reimbursed from the proceeds; and (5) $1,170.82 total amount of statutory or  contractual liens. The petition indicates that the total case cost is $203.76,  but that the total amount of attorney’s fees for which court approval is  requested is $2,333.33. Thus, the net balance of proceeds for the claimant is  $3,292.09. Attachment 18b(6) indicates that Petitioner requests that the  balance of the proceeds of Allison Maldonado’s settlement in the amount of  $3,292.09 be transferred to Petitioner, Senia Mondragon.      III. CONCLUSION     For the foregoing reasons, all three of Plaintiffs’ Petitions for  Minor’s Compromise are GRANTED.    Moving party is ordered to provide  notice.
