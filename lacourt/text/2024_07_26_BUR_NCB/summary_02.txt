The judge found that Decurion Corporation did not own, lease, occupy, or control the parking lot where the slip and fall incident occurred, and therefore did not owe a duty to the plaintiff.

The judge also granted Rancho Marketplace Gateway, LLC's motions to compel responses to the plaintiff's initial discovery requests. The judge ordered the plaintiff to provide verified responses to Rancho's discovery requests without objections within 20 days of notice.

Finally, the judge ordered the plaintiff and her counsel to pay monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,080 to Rancho Marketplace Gateway, LLC.
