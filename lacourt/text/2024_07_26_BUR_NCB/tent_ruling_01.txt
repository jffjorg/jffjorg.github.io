LEGAL
STANDARD
CCP § 695.010(a)
states: “Except
as otherwise provided by law, all property of the judgment debtor is subject to
enforcement of a money judgment.” 
CCP § 708.510
provides in relevant part: 
(a) Except as otherwise provided by law, upon application of the
judgment creditor on noticed motion, the court may order the judgment debtor to assign to the judgment
creditor or to a receiver appointed pursuant to Article 7
(commencing with Section 708.610) all or part of a right to payment due or to
become due, whether or not the right is conditioned on future developments,
including but not limited to the following types of payments:
(1) Wages due from the federal government that are not subject to
withholding under an earnings withholding order.
(2) Rents.
(3) Commissions.
(4) Royalties.
(5) Payments due from a patent or copyright.
(6) Insurance policy loan value.
(b) The notice of
the motion shall be served on the judgment debtor. Service shall be made
personally or by mail.
(c) Subject to subdivisions (d), (e), and (f), in determining
whether to order an assignment or the amount of an assignment pursuant to
subdivision (a), the court may take into consideration all relevant
factors, including the following:
(1) The reasonable requirements of a judgment debtor who is a
natural person and of persons supported in whole or in part by the judgment
debtor.
(2) Payments the judgment debtor is required to make or that are
deducted in satisfaction of other judgments and wage assignments, including earnings assignment orders for
support.
(3) The amount remaining due on the money judgment.
(4) The amount being or to be received in satisfaction of the right
to payment that may be assigned.
(d) A right to payment may be assigned pursuant to this article only to the extent necessary to satisfy the
money judgment.
(CCP
§ 708.510(a)-(d).) 
            “When an application is made pursuant
to Section 708.510 or thereafter, the judgment creditor may apply to the court
for an order restraining the judgment debtor from assigning or otherwise
disposing of the right to payment that is sought to be assigned. The
application shall be made on noticed motion if the court so directs or a court
rule so requires. Otherwise, it may be made ex parte.”  (CCP § 708.520(a).)   “The court may issue an order
pursuant to this section upon a showing of need for the order. The court, in
its discretion, may require the judgment creditor to provide an
undertaking.”  (CCP § 708.520(b).)  “The court may modify or vacate the order at
any time with or without a hearing on such terms as are just.”  (CCP § 708.520(c).) 
DISCUSSION
            Plaintiffs/Judgment
Creditors move for an assignment order against Defendant, assigning Defendant’s interest in any earnings for acting and/or directing in
any performance, whether television, movies, commercials, plays, or other forms
of media and all payment thereunder, to Plaintiffs to the extent necessary to
pay the judgment in full, including interest thereon.  Plaintiffs also seek an order restraining
Defendant, any agent, employee, or attorney of Defendant, whether alone or in
concert, from encumbering, assigning, disposing or spending her interest in the
right to be assigned listed above. 
            In
support of the motion, Plaintiffs provide the declaration of counsel Derek L.
Tabone. Mr. Tabone states that nothing has been collected on the default
judgment entered on August 14, 2020. 
(Tabone Decl., ¶¶4-5.)  He states
that the most recent writ of execution issued on June 4, 2024 is for the amount
of
$150,267.46.  (Id., ¶6.)  Counsel states that Defendant is, among other
things, an actress who does work in commercials, movies, and television shows
and her IMDB website shows that she has worked in multiple movies or television
shows every year, as well as doing voice overs in over 170 commercials.  (Id., ¶¶7-8, Ex. C.)  The website states that Defendant has 3 theatrical
agents: Stewart Talent, Elev8, and Taylor Talent Services.  (Id., ¶9.)  Plaintiffs seek an order assigning all of
Defendant’s right to payment for her movie, television, and commercial work
until Defendant’s judgment has been paid. 
(Id., ¶10.)  
The Court considers the factors under CCP
§ 708.510(c).
First, Defendant is a natural person.  There is no information on whether she is supporting
any other persons. As the motion is unopposed, Defendant has not provided any
statements that she is supporting any other persons. 
Second, it does not appear that Defendant
has made any effort to make payments towards the judgment.  According to Mr. Tabone (Plaintiffs’ counsel),
the judgment is still unpaid.  Plaintiffs
have not indicated whether there are any other assignment orders or wage
assignments, etc. and Defendant has not filed an opposition to provide such
information.  
Third, Plaintiffs argue that Defendant
owes $150,267.46, based on the June 4, 2024 writ of execution.  
            Fourth,
Plaintiffs seek an assignment of Defendant’s right to payment for her movie,
television, and commercial work until Defendant’s judgment has been paid.  The approximate amount of how much Defendant
is paid for her acting work is not provided. 

Since the judgment has not been satisfied
and the motion is not opposed, there are grounds to issue an assignment order
pursuant to CCP § 708.510.  The Court
hereby grants Plaintiffs’ request for assignment orders.  
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
Plaintiffs
William Farmer and Jennifer Farmer’s motion for an order assigning Defendant
Lisa Thelma Long’s interest in her earnings from her movie, television,
and commercial work is granted.  Defendant,
as well as any agent, employee, or attorney of Defendant,
whether alone or in concert, shall be restrained from encumbering, assigning,
disposing or spending her interest in the aforementioned earnings.
Plaintiffs shall
give notice of this order.
