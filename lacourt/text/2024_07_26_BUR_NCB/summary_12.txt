And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling grants State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company's motion to strike the allegations for punitive damages in Cameron Berta's complaint. The complaint alleges that State Farm acted maliciously, oppressively, and fraudulently in denying Berta's insurance claim for damage to his 2017 Bentley Bentayga. The court finds that the allegations are general and conclusory and fail to specify facts that support punitive damages. The court grants the motion to strike with leave to amend. The ruling requires Berta to re-plead the complaint with specific allegations that State Farm acted with malice, oppression, or fraud in denying the claim. The ruling also requires State Farm to give notice of the order.
