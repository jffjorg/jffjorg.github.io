And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the defendants, Arunpal Sehgal and Paramjot Mann, in their motion to compel compliance with requests for production. The judge finds that the plaintiff, Maneesh Bansal, failed to produce documents in response to the defendants' requests for production and did not label the responsive documents with specific request numbers as required by Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.280, subdivision (a). The judge orders the plaintiff to comply with this statute by providing a table identifying by Bates number which documents correspond to which requests for production.

The judge also grants the defendants' motion to compel the plaintiff to provide the password to access the QuickBooks files. The judge finds that the plaintiff's argument that providing the password would give the defendants access to information regarding other unrelated businesses of the plaintiff's is unpersuasive. The judge orders the plaintiff to provide the QuickBooks admin (owner) password for the company All Seasons Healthcare, Inc. within 15 days.

The judge denies the defendants' motion for monetary sanctions against the plaintiff, finding that the plaintiff acted with substantial justification and in good faith in opposing the motion.
