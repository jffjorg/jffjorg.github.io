 Case Number:  24STCV11987    Hearing Date:   November 12, 2024    Dept:  52 Defendant HH&A
Investment Inc.’s Demurrer and Motion to Strike Portions of Complaint
Defendant
HH&A Investment Inc. demurs to the complaint by plaintiff Ali Erfanian A.
Khosravi.  Defendant also moves to strike
plaintiff’s prayer for punitive damages.
Defendant
did not provide adequate proof of service of the moving papers on
plaintiff.  Self-represented parties are not required to accept electronic service
“unless they affirmatively consent to electronic service.”  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.251(c)(3)(B);
see Code Civ. Proc., § 1010.6, subd. (c).) 
Plaintiff is not represented by counsel. 
Nothing in the record shows he affirmatively consented to electronic
service.  The proofs of service
attached to each of the moving papers indicate the papers were served on plaintiff
only by email.  The service was therefore
invalid and did not give proper notice.
Defendant
HH&A Investment Inc.’s demurrer is overruled.  Defendant’s motion to strike is denied.  Defendant shall answer the complaint within
20 days.
