And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the defendants' demurrer to the plaintiff's third amended complaint is sustained. The plaintiff, Ido Erlich Webber, has alleged six causes of action against the defendants, including conversion, breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, accounting, and declaratory relief. However, the judge has found that the plaintiff's claims are based on a flawed premise, namely that he is entitled to receive interests in and distributions, income, and benefits from certain entities and properties because his late father, Moshe, allegedly wanted his children to be treated equally. The judge has ruled that this is not a valid basis for legal ownership of property and that the plaintiff has not alleged sufficient facts to support his claims. The defendants have been given 20 days to amend their demurrer.
