And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on HH&A Investment Inc.'s demurrer and motion to strike portions of the complaint filed by plaintiff Ali Erfanian A. Khosravi. The defendant's demurrer is overruled, and the motion to strike is denied. The judge finds that the defendant did not provide adequate proof of service of the moving papers on the plaintiff, as the plaintiff did not affirmatively consent to electronic service. Since the service was by email only, it was invalid and did not give proper notice. As a result, the defendant is required to answer the complaint within 20 days.
