ANALYSIS
Motion For Order of Discharge, Deposit and Dismissal
            Plaintiff
moves for an order discharging it from liability as stakeholder, an order of deposit
of the penal sum of $50,000 of the bond in dispute between the parties with the
clerk, and ordering that Defendants, and each of them and their respective attorneys,
be restrained from instituting or further prosecuting any other proceeding in
any court in California for recovery against the bond against Plaintiff, and

Civ. Proc. Code, § 386(b) & (c)[1]
provide:
 
(b) Any person, firm, corporation, association or other entity
against whom double or multiple claims are made, or may be made, by two or more
persons which are such that they may give rise to double or multiple liability,
may bring an action against the claimants to compel them to interplead and
litigate their several claims.
 
(c) Any amount which a plaintiff or
cross-complainant admits to be payable may be deposited by him with the clerk
of the court at the time of the filing of the complaint or cross-complaint in
interpleader without first obtaining an order of the court therefor. Any
interest on amounts deposited and any right to damages for detention of
property so delivered, or its value, shall cease to accrue after the date of
such deposit or delivery.
. . .
 
(f) After any such complaint or
cross-complaint in interpleader has been filed, the court in which it is filed
may enter its order restraining all parties to the action from instituting or
further prosecuting any other proceeding in any court in this state affecting
the rights and obligations as between the parties to the interpleader until
further order of the court.

Cal Code Civ Proc § 386

     (Civ.
Proc. Code, § 386(b), (c) & (f). 
When a person may be subject to
conflicting claims for money or property, the person may bring an interpleader
action to compel the claimants to litigate their claims among themselves. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 386, subd. (b).) Once the
person admits liability and deposits the money with the court, he or she is
discharged from liability and freed from the obligation of participating in the
litigation between the claimants. [Citations.] The purpose of interpleader
is to prevent a multiplicity of suits and double vexation. [Citation.]” (City
of Morgan Hill v. Brown (1999) 71 Cal.App.4th 1114, 1122 [84 Cal. Rptr. 2d
361], fn. omitted.) “In an interpleader action, the court initially determines
the right of the plaintiff to interplead the funds; if that right is sustained,
an interlocutory decree is entered which requires the defendants to interplead
and litigate their claims to the funds. Upon
an admission of liability and deposit of monies with the court, the plaintiff
may then be discharged from liability and dismissed from the interpleader
action. [Citations.] The effect of such an order is to preserve the fund,
discharge the stakeholder from further liability, and to keep the fund in the
court's custody until the rights of potential claimants of the monies can be
adjudicated. [Citations.] Thus, the interpleader proceeding is traditionally
viewed as two lawsuits in one. The first dispute is between the stakeholder and
the claimants to determine the right to interplead the funds. The second
dispute to be resolved is who is to receive the interpleaded funds.
[Citations.]” (Dial 800 v. Fesbinder (2004) 118 Cal.App.4th 32, 42–43 [12 Cal.
Rptr. 3d 711]; see also 4 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (4th ed. 1997) Pleading, §§
