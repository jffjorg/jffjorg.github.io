And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion for payment brought by the plaintiff. The defendant claims to be a mere stakeholder with no interest in the amount in dispute and that conflicting demands have been made upon them for the amount. The judge is skeptical of the plaintiff's argument, as Civ. Proc. Code, ยง 386.5 only applies to defendants seeking to be discharged from liability, not plaintiffs. The judge is considering granting the defendant's application for an order discharging them from liability and dismissing them from the action, provided they deposit the disputed amount with the court clerk.
