And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The plaintiff, as surety, has moved for an order discharging it from liability as a stakeholder, an order of deposit of the penal sum of $50,000 of the bond in dispute between the parties with the clerk, and an order restraining the defendants from instituting or further prosecuting any other proceeding in any court in California for recovery against the bond against the plaintiff. The court has granted the motion.

The plaintiff has admitted liability in the sum of $50,000 dealer's bond as surety, and the bond was issued and executed by ACIC and SHIFT OPERATIONS LLC. The plaintiff seeks to interplead the funds and be discharged from liability as a stakeholder.

The court has determined that the plaintiff has the right to interplead the funds, and an interlocutory decree will be entered requiring the defendants to interplead and litigate their claims to the funds. The plaintiff may then be discharged from liability and dismissed from the interpleader action. The effect of this order is to preserve the fund, discharge the stakeholder from further liability, and keep the fund in the court's custody until the rights of potential claimants of the monies can be adjudicated.
