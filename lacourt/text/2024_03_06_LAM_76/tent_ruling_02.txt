[1] Although Plaintiff cites Civ. Proc. Code, § 386.5 as one
basis for this motion, that section applies to a defendant not a plaintiff:
 
Where
the only relief sought against one of the defendants is the payment of a stated
amount of money alleged to be wrongfully withheld, such defendant may, upon
affidavit that he is a mere stakeholder with no interest in the amount or any
portion thereof and that conflicting demands have been made upon him for the
amount by parties to the action, upon notice to such parties, apply to the
court for an order discharging him from liability and dismissing him from the
action on his depositing with the clerk of the court the amount in dispute and
the court may, in its discretion, make such order.
