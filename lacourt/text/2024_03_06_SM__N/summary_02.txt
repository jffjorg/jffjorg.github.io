And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has sustained the demurrer (a legal challenge) filed by the Department of Transportation (Caltrans) to the plaintiff's complaint. The plaintiff, Rafael Moreno Fregoso, has alleged negligence and premises liability against Caltrans, but the judge has ruled that the complaint does not sufficiently state a claim against Caltrans.

The judge has given the plaintiff 30 days to amend the complaint to include specific facts and allegations that demonstrate a statutory basis for liability against Caltrans. The plaintiff must plead facts that show how Caltrans' alleged actions or omissions caused the plaintiff's injuries and how those actions or omissions violate specific California statutes.

The judge has cited several California court cases to support the ruling, including cases that discuss the legal sufficiency of the allegations in a complaint, the requirements for pleading a cause of action, and the immunities available to public entities under California law.
