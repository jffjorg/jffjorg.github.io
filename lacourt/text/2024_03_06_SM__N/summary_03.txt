And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has denied the motion to quash (dismiss) the summons filed by Defendants Joseph W. Sherman and Catherine Bampoky. The motion was filed in response to a lawsuit brought by Plaintiff John Oursland. The Judge ruled that the Defendants were properly served with the summons and complaint, and that their failure to provide proof of service does not change the Court's decision. The Judge also noted that the Defendants' general appearance in the action by filing motions and answers constitutes a waiver of any objections they may have had to personal jurisdiction. The Judge ordered the Clerk to give notice of the ruling.
