Summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by the Judge in a commercial unlawful detainer case. The case was filed on September 12, 2023, and was initially dismissed on October 10, 2023, based on a conditional settlement agreement between the parties. However, the plaintiff has now moved ex parte to vacate the dismissal and enter judgment pursuant to the stipulated settlement agreement. The court has granted the motion and will enter an order enforcing the settlement agreement and awarding judgment to the plaintiff in the amount of $102,500.00, plus unpaid rent and attorney's fees and costs. The court notes that the defendant appears to be unrepresented by counsel and orders that the moving party give notice.
