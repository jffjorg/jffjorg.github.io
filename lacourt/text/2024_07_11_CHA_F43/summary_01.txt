And here is the summary in English text:

This tentative ruling denies the defendant's petition to compel arbitration and stay the action. The defendant, Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc., filed a petition to compel arbitration and stay the action, arguing that the warranty obligations under the Song-Beverly Warranty Act are inextricably intertwined with the arbitration agreement in the Retail Installment Sale Contract (RISC). The plaintiff, Ernest Nyann, opposes the petition.

The court finds that the warranty obligations under the Song-Beverly Act are not inextricably intertwined with the arbitration agreement in the RISC. The RISC is separate and distinct from the express warranties covered by the Song-Beverly Act, and the manufacturer warranty obligations arise independently from the RISC.

The court will apply state law to determine whether a non-signatory to an agreement containing an arbitration clause may compel arbitration. The court notes that the language of the arbitration provision in the RISC mentions third parties and has language similar to Felisilda v. FCA US LLC, but the RISC also has an express disclaimer of any warranties as to the dealer.

The court finds that the defendant's claim that it should be able to compel arbitration by virtue of the doctrine of equitable estoppel and its claim that it is a third-party beneficiary of the arbitration agreement is not supported by the evidence. The court concludes that the petition to compel arbitration is denied.
