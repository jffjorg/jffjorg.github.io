And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The court has reached a tentative decision regarding the hearing on the plaintiffs' motion for sanctions. Due to the court's current engagement in a 5-week jury trial, followed by another 5-week jury trial, there is insufficient time to review the various motions. The court prefers to hear the motion for sanctions after the motion for summary judgment (MSJ). To control its calendar due to congestion, the court will continue the trial and other hearings to allow sufficient time to prepare. The proposed schedule is as follows: the trial will be continued to June 25, 2024; the filing of a cross-complaint will be continued to March 13, 2024; and the MSJs will be continued to April 16, 2024. The court will also grant additional pages for the plaintiffs' opposition and defendants' replies.
