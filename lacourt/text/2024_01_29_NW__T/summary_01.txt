Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to dismiss the action. The defendant, HP Inc., argued that the plaintiffs failed to serve the summons within the two-year time period and that the opposition to the motion was untimely filed. However, the judge found that the defendant had appeared in the action despite not being properly served, had utilized the Court's process, and was willing to mediate the matter to a settlement. The judge also noted that the case involves the rights of a minor child and that the interests of justice are best served by a trial of the case.
