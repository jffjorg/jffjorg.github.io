  Case Number:  21STCV03870    Hearing Date:   January 29, 2024    Dept:  T 21STCV03870 Patino v
Parkwood
[TENTATIVE] ORDER:  Defendant HP Inc.’s Motion to Dismiss is
DENIED. Defendant HP, Inc. answered the complaint 2 years and 2 months after
the complaint was filed.  The motion comes
8 months after it has already appeared in the case.  The case is set for trial in June of this
year.  
Introduction 
Defendant/Doe 1 HP Inc.
(Defendant) moved to dismiss Plaintiffs Maya Anatolia Stone and Elvan Patino’s
(collectively, Plaintiffs) Complaint.  
Procedure 
Defendant asserted that the
opposition was untimely and it should not be considered.  The opposition was to be filed/served within
15 days after service of the motion. 
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1342(b).) 
The opposition was filed/served on January 12, 2024, which is 30 days
after the December 13, 2023 filing/service date of the motion.  However, Defendant presented no legal
authority which requires the Court to disregard an untimely opposition.  Further, the rule itself does not use
mandatory language, like “shall” or “must.” 
Further, there is no showing of any prejudice to Defendant for
Plaintiffs’ untimely opposition since Defendant addressed the merits of the
opposition in their “reply,”  filed on
January 25, 2024.  
The Court exercised its
discretion and considered the Plaintiffs’ opposition.
Discussion  
Defendant requested the Court to
exercise its discretionary authority and dismiss the action for Plaintiffs’
delay in prosecution, specifically for failing to serve the action within two
years of commencement.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
secs. 583.410 and 583.420(a)(1).)   The
burden on the motion is on the opposing party, Plaintiffs, to show some excuse
or explanation for failing to serve the summons throughout the two-year time
period.  (Scarzella v. DeMers (1993) 17
Cal.App.4th 1762, 1769; A. Groppe & Sons Glass Co., Inc. v. Fireman’s Fund
Insurance Co. (1991) 232 Cal.App.3d 220, 225.) 

The action was filed on February
1, 2021 and the two-year time limit to complete service expired on January 31,
2023.  Defendant was added to the action
as Doe 1 on January 31, 2023.  However,
Plaintiffs did not file a proof of service showing that service was made on or
before January 31, 2023.  Due to
Plaintiffs’ failure to file a proof of service to show that service was made on
or before January 31, 2023, good cause is shown for the Court to exercise its
discretionary authority to dismiss.  
The Court file reflects that a
proof of service was filed on March 7, 2023 reflecting personal service being
made on February 23, 2023 upon Co-Defendant Hewlett Packard Enterprises
Company, as Doe 2 (Hewlett Packard). 
However, Defendant’s Claim Administrator argued that it was not Hewlett
Packard that was served but Defendant that was served.  (Thomas Alch (Alch) Decl. par. 11, Exh.
4.)  Defendant’s “reply” did not dispute
this contention.  The evidence showed
that Defendant was untimely served by 23 days – a relatively short duration of
time.  However, at issue, is an
explanation as to why the action was not served upon Defendant during the
entirety of the two-year time period.  Plaintiffs’
Counsel provided that a request for the burnt computer was made to Tathiana
Patino, the sister of Decedent Francisco Patino, in Miami Florida.  However, the request was not successful due
to Tathiana being out of the country. 
Plaintiffs provided that it was not until July 2022 that Plaintiffs’
Counsel was able to obtain pictures of the burnt computer at issue.  (Alch Decl. par. 8.)  However, the contention does not explain why
Plaintiffs were not diligent in prosecuting the case from February 2021, when
the action was filed, and does not explain why Plaintiffs took until January
2023 to file/serve the action against Defendant when Defendant’s identity was
discovered some time around July 2022. 
Plaintiffs have not shown any excuse in the delayed service during the
entirety of the two-year period.  An
unexplained failure to serve the summons is prima facie grounds for
discretionary dismissal.  (Scarzella v.
DeMers, supra, 17 Cal.App.4th at p. 1769.) 
Even with a prima facie case for dismissal and a failure to show an
excuse for the delay in service, the Court is not obligated to dismiss and
dismissal is still discretionary. 
(Id.)  
In ruling on the motion, the
Court must consider all relevant matters. 
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1324(e).) 
Defendant filed an Answer on April 11, 2023 and the instant motion was
thereafter filed on December 13, 2023, nearly eight months after Defendant’s
general appearance and eleven months after the February 23, 2023 service of the
summons and complaint.  Prior to the
instant motion, Plaintiffs provided that Defendant took advantage of the
judicial process by appearing at case management conferences; serving
discovery; objecting to and/or requesting extension to Plaintiffs’ discovery
demands; and suggesting mediators for mediation.  (Alch Decl. pars. 6-7, 9-10.)  
Further, the nature of the case
involved Plaintiffs’ loss of their father and husband.  In particular, this case concerns the rights
of a minor child -- now age 10 -- whose statute of limitations will not expire
for a minimum of another 8+ years.  Even
if the Court were to dismiss this case, it would be without prejudice per CCP
sec. 581.  
The Court finds that these
additional facts provide sufficient grounds to overcome the prima facie showing
for dismissal.  The interests of justice
are best served by trial of the case because Defendant appeared in the action
despite not being properly served; has thus far defended against the action and
utilized the Court’s process; and are willing to mediate the matter to a
settlement.  The Court exercises its
discretionary authority in favor of Plaintiffs.
The motion to dismiss is
DENIED.  
IT IS SO ORDERED, CLERK TO GIVE
NOTICE.
