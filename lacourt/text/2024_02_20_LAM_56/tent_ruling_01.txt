MOVING
PARTY: Plaintiff
RESPONDING
PARTY: Defendant Farbood Majd (“Defendant”)
 
The
Court has considered the moving, opposition and reply papers.
 
BACKGROUND
            This action arises out of
an attorney-client relationship.  Plaintiff’s
complaint (the “Complaint”) alleges: (1) legal malpractice; (2) breach of
contract; and (3) breach of fiduciary duty. 

 
 
 
            On November 18, 2023 and November
20, 2023, respectively, Plaintiff filed: (1) a motion for protective order
regarding the Requests for Admissions, Set One propounded by Defendant (the
“RFA Motion”); and (2) a motion for protective order regarding the Requests for
Production, Set One propounded by Defendant (the “RFP Motion”) (collectively,
the “Motions”).[1]
 
DISCUSSION
Under
California Code of Civil Procedure (“CCP”) section 2033.080, when
requests for admission have been made, the responding party, the responding
party may promptly move for a protective order. 
(CCP § 2033.080, subd. (a).)  The
motion shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under CCP section
2016.040.  (Id.)  The court, for good cause shown, may make any
order that justice requires to protect any party or natural person or
organization from unwarranted annoyance, embarrassment, or oppression, or undue
burden and expense.  (CCP § 2033.080,
subd. (b).)  If the motion for a
protective order is denied in whole or in part, the court may order that the
party provide or permit the discovery against which protection was sought on
terms and conditions that are just.  (CCP
§ 2033.080, subd. (c).) 
 
No
party shall request, as a matter of right, that any other party admit more than
35 matters that do not relate to the genuineness of documents.  (CCP § 2033.030, subd. (a).)  If the initial set of admission requests does
not exhaust this limit, the balance may be requested in subsequent sets.  (Id.) 
Unless a declaration as described in CCP section 2033.050 has been made,
a party need only respond to the first 35 admission requests served that do not
relate to the genuineness of documents, if that party states an objection to
the balance under CCP section 2033.230 on the ground that the limit has been
exceeded.  (CCP § 2033.030, subd. (b).)  When a party requests a protective order based
on the excessive number of RFAs, the propounding party shall have the burden of
justifying the number of requests for admission.  (CCP § 2033.040, subd. (b).)  
 
Under
CCP section 2031.060, subdivision (a), when an inspection, copying, testing, or
sampling of documents, tangible things, places, or electronically stored
information has been demanded, the party to whom the demand has been directed,
and any other party or affected person, may promptly move for a protective
order.  (CCP § 2031.060, subd. (a).)  The court, for good cause shown, may make any
order that justice requires to protect any party or other natural person or
organization from unwarranted annoyance, embarrassment, or oppression, or undue
burden and expense.  (CCP § 2061.060,
subd. (b).)  Where a party must resort to
the courts, the burden is on the party seeking the protective order to show
good cause for whatever order is sought. 
(Nativi v. Deutsche Bank National
Trust Co. (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 261, 318.) 
In law and motion practice, factual evidence is provided to the court by
way of declarations.  (Calcor Space Facility, Inc. v. Superior
Court (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 216, 224.) 

 
Defendant
propounded 176 RFPs on September 27, 2023. 
(See RFP Declaration of Shahrokh Mokhtarzadeh (“Mokhtarzadeh
Decl.”) ¶ 16, Exhibit A.)  The RFAs that
Defendant contemporaneously propounded contain 453 requests for
admissions.  (See RFA Mokhtarzadeh
Decl. ¶ 16, Exhibit A.)  After receiving
the RFPs and RFAs, Plaintiff attempted to confer with Defendant about the
breadth of the discovery requests.  (See
Mokhtarzadeh Decl. ¶ 11.)  While Defendant
did not agree to pare down or otherwise limit the scope of the discovery
requests, he communicated a willingness to extend Plaintiff’s deadline to
submit responses to November 7, 2023.  (See
Mokhtarzadeh Decl. ¶ 13.)  
 
In
support of the RFP reply, Plaintiff provides evidence of the RFP responses that
he served on February 12, 2024.  (See Supp.
RFP Mokhtarzadeh Decl. ¶ 3.)  
 
            The Court finds that the Declaration for Additional
Discovery attached to the RFAs is insufficient to justify the number of RFAs
that Defendant propounded on Plaintiff. 
The declaration served with the RFAs includes a general recitation of the statutory language stating that the
greater number of RFAs is warranted in order to enable a proper investigation
of the issues in the case, but does not offer specific information to connect
the facts of this case with the substantive requirements of a CCP section 2033.050
declaration.  The conclusory declaration does not address
why Defendant needs an amount of RFAs that significantly exceeds the general
maximum of 35 requests in order to prepare his defense.  (See CCP § 2033.030, subd. (a).)  Furthermore, Defendant’s opposition (the “RFA Opposition”)
does not satisfy Defendant’s burden of justifying the propounding of more
than 35 RFAs.  (See CCP § 2033.040,
subd. (b).)  
 
In
contrast to RFAs, the number of permissible RFPs is not subject to a statutory
limit.  The Court notes that the RFP
Motion does not clearly articulate the contours of Plaintiff’s preferred
protective order regarding the RFPs. 
Nonetheless, the Court agrees that the number of document categories
sought by Defendant in the RFPs is burdensome and that several of the RFPs
request cumulative or redundant categories of documents.  Plaintiff’s evidence indicates that Plaintiff
has substantially responded to the RFPs, subject to certain objections, and
without the production of identified categories of difficult-to-access
electronically stored information (“ESI”). 
(See Supp. RFP Mokhtarzadeh Decl. ¶ 11.)  The RFP Opposition does not raise arguments
that rebut Plaintiff’s contention that several of the categories of documents
requested in the RFPs are overly burdensome, redundant, and not reasonably
calculated to lead to admissible evidence. 
The Court finds that Plaintiff has sufficiently demonstrated that there
is good cause to limit Plaintiff’s burden of providing the ESI and other
categories of documents to which Plaintiff has asserted objections.  
 
Based
on the foregoing, the Court GRANTS both the Motions.  Plaintiff is not required to submit responses
to Defendant’s RFAs, Set One numbers 36-453. 
Plaintiff is also not required to produce documents in response to the
RFPs to which valid objections have been asserted.  
 
Monetary Sanctions
            Plaintiff requests monetary sanctions in the amount of $8,810
in connection with the RFA Motion and $7,060 in connection with the RFP
Motion.  (See Supp RFA
Mokhtarzadeh Decl. ¶¶ 25-26; Supp. RFP Mokhtarzadeh Decl. ¶¶ 15-16.)[2]  With respect to the RFA Motion, this amount
represents: (1) 12 hours preparing the moving papers at an hourly rate of $500
per hour; (2) 6.5 hours reviewing the RFA Opposition and drafting the RFA
Reply; and (3) a $60 filing fee.  (Supp.
RFA Mokhtarzadeh Decl. ¶ 26.)[3]  With respect to the RFP Motion, this amount
represents: (1) 12 hours preparing the moving and reply papers collectively at
an hourly rate of $500 per hour; (2) an anticipated hour preparing for and
attending the hearing; and (3) a $60 filing fee.  (Supp. RFP Mokhtarzadeh Decl. ¶ 16.)[4]
 
            The Court exercises its discretion and awards Plaintiff
monetary sanctions in the total reasonable amount of $3,120, which represents
six hours of work at an hourly rate of $500 per hour in connection with the
Motions collectively and $120 total in filing fees.  (Moran v. Oso Valley Greenbelt Assn.
(2004) 117 Cal.App.4th 1029, 1034.) 
Defendant is ordered to pay this amount within 30 days of the date of
this order. 
 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
