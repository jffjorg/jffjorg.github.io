And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on March 29, 2024, in the case of 23SMCV00829. The plaintiff, Sarah Allwardt, has moved to set aside the dismissal with prejudice of the entire action, entered on September 11, 2023. The motion is unopposed.

The court has found that the dismissal was caused by attorney mistake or inadvertence, and therefore, the mandatory relief provisions of Code of Civil Procedure section 473(b) apply. The court has granted the motion to set aside the dismissal and has set a status conference regarding the amendment to the complaint on June 7, 2024.

The court has also ordered that the plaintiff provide notice of the court's ruling and file a proof of service regarding the same. The court's ruling is based on the evidence presented, including the attorney declaration of Barry S. Zelner, which establishes that the dismissal was caused by a mistake or inadvertence on the part of the attorney.
