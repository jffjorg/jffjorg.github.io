Background
 
On August 13, 2024, Angelina Leo aka Angelina Nia,
Steven Nia, and  W1 Inc. (collectively
“Plaintiffs”) filed a Complaint against Matt Mickelson (“Defendant”) and Does 1
to 10 alleging two causes of action for (1) breach of contract and (2) legal
malpractice. 
Defendant now demurs to the Complaint. Plaintiff
opposes the Motion. The matter is now before the court. 
request
for JUDICIAL notice
 
The court may
take judicial notice of “official acts of the legislative, executive, and
judicial departments of the United States and of any state of the United
States,” “[r]ecords of (1) any court of this state or (2) any court of record
of the United States or of any state of the United States,” and “[f]acts and
propositions that are not reasonably subject to dispute and are capable of
immediate and accurate determination by resort to sources of reasonably
indisputable accuracy.” (Evid. Code § 452, subds. (c), (d), and (h).) “Taking
judicial notice of a document is not the same as accepting the truth of its
contents or accepting a particular interpretation of its meaning.” (Joslin v. H.A.S. Ins. Brokerage (1986) 184 Cal.App.3d 369, 374.)
Defendant

request for judicial notice is granted. 
 
Demurrer[1]
 
I.         Legal Standard
 
Where pleadings are defective, a party may raise the defect
by way of a demurrer. (Coyne v. Krempels (1950) 36 Cal.2d 257, 262.) A
demurrer tests the sufficiency of a pleading, and the grounds for a demurrer
must appear on the face of the pleading or from judicially noticeable matters.¿
(CCP, § 430.30(a); Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) In
evaluating a demurrer, the court accepts the complainant’s properly pled facts
as true and ignores contentions, deductions, and conclusory statements. (Daar
v. Yellow Cab Co. (1976) 67 Cal.2d 695, 713; Serrano v. Priest (1971)
5 Cal.3d 584, 591.) Moreover, the court does not consider whether a plaintiff
will be able to prove the allegations or the possible difficulty in making such
proof. (Fisher v. San Pedro Peninsula Hospital (1989) 214 Cal.App.3d
590, 604.) 
Leave to amend must be allowed
where there is a reasonable possibility of successful amendment. (Goodman v.
Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.)¿ The burden is on the complainant to
show the Court that a pleading can be amended successfully. (Ibid.)
 
II.        Discussion
 
A.        W1’s
Capacity to Sue and Maintain this Action
 
Defendant
asserts that Plaintiff W1 lacks the capacity to maintain this action because it
is a non-qualified foreign corporation. California Corp. Code § 2105 states
that “[a] foreign corporation shall not transact intrastate business without
having first obtained from the Secretary of State a certificate of
qualification.” “A foreign corporation ... which transacts intrastate business
without complying with section 2105 shall not maintain any action or proceeding
upon any intrastate business so transacted in any court in this state, ... ”
(Corp. Code, § 2203(c).) 
 
“Section
2203, subdivision (c) imposes a penalty upon the foreign corporation which does
not qualify to transact intrastate business as required by section 2105 and
merely provides that until it does so, it shall not maintain any suit or action
in any court of this state; it simply forbids the exercise of a small part of
the corporate powers, except on the specified conditions.” (United Medical
Management Ltd. v. Gatto (1996) 49 Cal.App.4th 1732, 1741 (United
Medical).) An unregistered corporation, upon registering, is “restored to
full legal competency and [has] its prior transactions given full effect.” (Ibid;
see also  Perlas v. Mortgage Elec.
Registration Systems, Inc. (N.D. Cal., Aug. 6, 2010, No. C 09-4500 CRB)
2010 WL 3079262, at *7.)
 
“The
defendant bears the burden of proving: (1) the action arises out of the
transaction of intrastate business by a foreign corporation; and (2) the action
was commenced by the foreign corporation prior to qualifying to transact
intrastate business.” (United Medical, supra, 49 Cal.App.4th at
p. 1740.) “For purposes of qualification of a foreign corporation, ‘transact
intrastate business means entering into repeated and successive transactions of
its business in this state, other than interstate or foreign commerce.’
[Citation].” (United Systems of Arkansas, Inc. v. Stamison (1998) 63
Cal.App.4th 1001, 1007; see also Corp. Code, § 191(a).)
 
Here,
Defendant fails to meet his burden of showing this action arising out of an
attorney-client relationship that was entered into in California with a
California attorney was sufficiently repeated and successive that it
constituted intrastate business and requires Plaintiff W1 to register with the
California Secretary of State. While the Defendant relies on Neogard Corp.
v. Malott & Peterson-Grundy (1980) 106 Cal.App.3d 213 for the
proposition that a foreign corporation that contracts with California business
needs to be registered, the transactions in Neograd are distinguishable
from the single transaction involved in this action. The Neograd Court
agreed that Neograd required registration with the California Secretary of
State because of its repeated and successive transactions with  “manufacturer's representatives residing in
this state,” “[i]t sent sales representatives intrastate to induce construction
contracts between California project designers and California waterproofing
subcontractors,” “[i]t entered into contracts with such subcontractors and
utilized this fact to induce contracts between the in-state parties,” and “[i]t
signed contracts in-state to guarantee these projects and provided in-state
supervision when defects appeared.” (Id. at p. 226.)
 
Since
this action arises out of a single contract and not out of repeated and
successive transactions, the action does not involve intrastate business, and
the court fails to find that Plaintiff W1 is required to register with the
California Secretary of State to maintain this action under Corp. Code § 2105. 
 
The
demurrer as to Plaintiff W1’s lack of capacity to maintain this action is
overruled. 
 
B.        Breach
of Contract
 
The elements of a claim for breach of
contract are: “(1) the existence of the contract, (2) plaintiff’s performance
or excuse for nonperformance, (3) defendant's breach, and (4) the resulting
damages to the plaintiff.” (Oasis West Realty, LLC v. Goldman (2011) 51
Cal. 4th 811, 821.) In addition, the complaint must demonstrate damages
proximately caused by the breach. (St. Paul Ins. v. American Dynasty (2002)
101 Cal.App.4th 1038, 1060.) Furthermore, “the complaint must [also] indicate
on its face whether the contract is written, oral, or implied by conduct.” (Otworth
v. Southern Pac. Transportation Co. (1985) 166 Cal.App.3d 452, 458-59
citing CCP, § 430.10(g).)
“If the
action is based on alleged breach of written contract, the terms must be set
out verbatim in the body of the complaint or a copy of the written agreement
must be attached and incorporated by reference.” (Harris
v. Rudin, Richman & Appel (1999) 74
Cal.App.4th 299, 308.) Alternatively, “a plaintiff may plead the legal effect
of the contract rather than its precise language.”¿ (Construction Protective
Services, Inc. v. TIG Specialty Ins. Co. (2002) 29 Cal.4th 189,
198-199.)¿¿“[A]ll essential elements of a breach of contract cause of action []
must be pleaded with specificity.”¿(Levy v. State Farm Mutual Automobile
Ins. Co. (2007) 150 Cal.App.4th 1, 5.) 
 
The Complaint alleges
that Defendant agreed to represent the Plaintiffs in the case entitled Lucky
International Technology, Inc. v. Steven Nia, et al., Los Angeles County
Superior Court Case No. 20STCV48450 (the “Underlying Action”), in which Plaintiffs
were the Defendants and Cross-Complainants. (Compl. ¶ 10.) “Defendant MICKELSON
breached the agreement by failing to adequately work up case, including
discovery and client interviews, and maintain case file, criticizing
Plaintiffs' case before Judge and opposing counsel, undervaluing case in
violation of his duties of loyalty and confidentiality, and by signing a
stipulation that restricted the causes of action Plaintiffs could litigate.” (Id.
¶ 11.) “Defendant's failures to investigate facts of case, conduct discovery,
and negative representations to the court and opposing counsel predictably led
to a settlement amount that was less than it should have been.” (Id. ¶
12.) 
 
The Complaint fails
to state when the contract was entered into and if it is oral or written. The
Defendant provides proof, via judicial notice, that he withdrew as counsel in
the Underlying Action. The Complaint is devoid of facts as to why Defendant’s error
was not curable by later counsel and what specific discovery Defendant failed
to uncover that would have resulted in settling the case for a lesser amount.
Any facts not alleged in the Complaint are presumed not to exist. (Schick v.
Lerner (1987) 193 Cal.App.3d 1321, 1327.) 
 
The demurrer to the
first cause of action is sustained with leave to amend. 
 
C.        Legal
Malpractice 
 
“The
elements of a cause of action in tort for professional negligence are: the duty
of the professional to use such skill, prudence and diligence as other members
of the profession commonly possess and exercise; a breach of that duty; a
proximate causal connection between the negligent conduct and the resulting
injury; and actual loss or damage resulting from the professional's
negligence.” (Burgess v. Superior Court¿(1992) 2 Cal.4th 1064,
1066–1067.) “[I]n a legal malpractice action, whether a court or jury decides
the issue of causation ‘does not turn on the identity or expertise of the trier
of fact, but whether the issues are predominately questions of fact or law.’ ”
(Mireskandari v. Edwards Wildman Palmer LLP (2022) 77 Cal.App.5th 247,
265.)  
 
Defendant
asserts that the second cause of action fails because Plaintiff fails to allege
‘but for’ causation. In a legal malpractice action, “[t]he plaintiff must
prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that but for the attorney's
negligent acts or omissions, he would have obtained a more favorable judgment
or settlement in the action in which the malpractice allegedly occurred.” (Namikas
v. Miller (2014) 225 Cal.App.4th 1574, 1582.) While the court agrees with
the Plaintiffs that they are not required to prove their allegations at the
pleading stage, they are still required to allege specific facts to show
Defendant’s acts or omissions proximately caused them to settle for a lesser
amount. (See Stevens v. Superior Court (1986) 180 Cal.App.3d 605,
609–610 [“Whether the plaintiff will be able to prove the pleaded facts is
irrelevant to ruling upon the demurrer.”].) 
 
The
Complaint fails to allege what discovery and client interviews the Defendant
failed to take and why they prejudiced the Plaintiffs’ case in the Underlying
Action. (Compl., ¶ 16.) The Complaint fails to explain why such deficiencies
were not curable by subsequent counsel and fails to state what causes of action
the Defendant failed to pursue due to a signed stipulation and why Plaintiff
could have prevailed on those causes of action if they had been properly
litigated. (Id.) The Complaint fails to specify what specific criticism
Defendant made before the Judge and opposing counsel in the Underlying Action
that prejudiced the case leading to a lower settlement.
 
In
the absence of such fact, the court cannot find that Plaintiffs have pled
sufficient facts to show that but for Defendant’s lack of due care, the Plaintiffs
would have obtained a higher settlement. (See Slovensky v. Friedman
(2006) 142 Cal.App.4th 1518, 1528; Thompson v. Halvonik (1995) 36
Cal.App.4th 657, 662–664.) 
 
The
demurrer to the second cause of action is sustained with leave to amend. 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant’
demurrer is sustained with leave to amend. Plaintiff is granted 10 days leave
to amend. The court sets the OSC RE: Amended Complaint for February 5, 2025, at
8:30 a.m.  The Court also advances the
Case Management Conference (“CMC”) scheduled for January 16, 2025, to today,
and continues the CMC to February 5, 2025, at 8:30 a.m.
