CCP § 430.41 requires the Parties to meet and
confer prior to filing a demurrer. The Parties failed to meet this requirement.
“Any determination by the court that
the meet and confer process was insufficient shall not be grounds to overrule
or sustain a demurrer.” (CCP, § 430.41(a)(4).) As the failure to meet and
confer does not constitute grounds to overrule a demurrer, the court continues
on to the merits.
