Fulton argues that they do not own or control the subject sidewalk, which caused Plaintiff's injuries, and therefore cannot be held liable to Plaintiff as a matter of law. The Court finds that Fulton has met their initial burden and the burden now shifts to Plaintiff to present controverting evidence. Since Plaintiff did not file an opposition or provide controverting evidence, the Court grants Fulton's motion for summary judgment.
