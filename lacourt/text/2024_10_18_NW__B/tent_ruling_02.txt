LEGAL STANDARDS
 
If a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to serve a timely
response, the propounding party may move for an order compelling responses and
for a monetary sanction.  (Cal. Code Civ.
Proc. § 2030.290(b).) The statute contains no time limit for a motion to compel
where no responses have been served.  All
that need be shown in the moving papers is that a set of interrogatories was
properly served on the opposing party, that the time to respond has expired,
and that no response of any kind has been served. (See Leach v. Superior
Court (1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 902, 905-906.)
 
Where there has been no timely response to a demand for the production
of documents, the demanding party may seek an order compelling a response. (CCP
§ 2031.300(b).) Failure to timely respond waives all objections, including
privilege and work product.  (CCP §
2031.300(a).) Thus, unless the party to whom the demand was directed obtains
relief from waiver, he or she cannot raise objections to the documents
demanded. Likewise, for failure to respond, the moving party need not attempt
to resolve the matter outside court before filing the motion.
 
“The court shall impose a monetary sanction . . . against any
party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to
compel . . . responses to interrogatories or production demands, absent
substantial justification or other circumstances that make imposing the
sanctions unjust.” (CCP § 2030.290(c).) Similarly, “[t]he court may impose
a monetary sanction ordering that one engaging in the misuse of the discovery
process, or any attorney advising that conduct, or both pay the reasonable
expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that
conduct.”  (CCP § 2023.030(a).) Misuse of
the discovery process includes “[f]ailing to respond or to submit to an
authorized method of discovery,” and “[d]isobeying a court order to
provide discovery.” (CCP § 2023.010(d) and (g).)
 
Pacific’s Motions to Compel
 
Pacific moves to compel Plaintiff’s responses to Form Interrogatories,
Set One, Special Interrogatories, Set One, Request for Production of Documents,
Set One, and to deem matters admitted in Request for Admissions, Set One. As to
each motion, Pacific seeks sanctions in the amount of $2,397.50, comprised of a
$60.00 filing fee and 5.5 hours of work per motion at a rate of $425 per hour,
including an anticipated 1.5 hours preparing a reply to Plaintiff’s opposition
and 1 hour attending this matter’s hearing.
 
Pacific moves to compel Plaintiff’s responses to discovery because Plaintiff
failed to provide any responses. Pacific propounded discovery requests on
Plaintiff on May 1, 2024. (Conley Decl. ¶ 3.) Responses were due on June 3,
2024. (Ibid.) Plaintiff did not respond. Pacific sent Plaintiff a meet
and confer letter on June 13, 2024. (Ibid. at ¶ 4; Exh. B [meet and
confer letter].) Pacific also provided a warning that, if Plaintiff failed to
respond, they would file the instant motions on June 25, 2024. (Ibid.)
Plaintiff never provided discovery responses. 
 
Here, Plaintiff failed to timely comply with her discovery obligations
because she has failed to provide timely responses to discovery. Accordingly,
Plaintiff is ordered to provide verified responses,
without objections, to Pacific’s discovery requests within 15 days of this
ruling.
 
Considering Plaintiff’s total failure to comply with her discovery
obligations, the Court orders sanctions in the reduced amount of $910 per
motion (representing two hours of work at a rate of $425 per hour plus $60.00
filing fee per motion, as each motion is substantially similar, and no
oppositions were filed). Therefore, sanctions are awarded against Plaintiff in
the amount of $3,640 ($910 x four motions to compel). Plaintiff is ordered to
pay sanctions within 15 days of this ruling.
 
Schwartzman’s Motions to Compel
 
Schwartzman moves to compel Plaintiff’s responses to Form
Interrogatories, Set Two, and to deem matters admitted in Request for
Admissions, Set One. As to each motion, Pacific seeks sanctions in the amount
of $825, comprised of a $60.00 filing fee and three hours of work per motion at
a rate of $225 per hour, including an anticipated hour preparing a reply to
Plaintiff’s opposition and one hour attending this matter’s hearing.
 
Schwartzman propounded discovery requests upon Plaintiff on March 6,
2024. (Hertzog Decl. ¶ 3.) Responses were due on April 9, 2024. (Ibid.
at ¶ 4.) Schwartzman provided two extensions to April 26, 2024. (Ibid.)
Plaintiff did not respond. (Ibid. at ¶ 5.) On June 27, 2024, Schwartzman
sent Plaintiff a meet and confer letter, demanding that responses be served by
July 3, 2024, or the instant motions would be filed. (Ibid. at ¶ 6; Exh.
B [meet and confer letter].) Plaintiff did not respond. (Ibid.)
 
Plaintiff failed to timely comply with her discovery obligations because
she has failed to provide timely responses to discovery. Accordingly, Plaintiff
is ordered to provide verified responses, without objections, to Schwartzman’s
discovery requests within 15 days of this ruling.
 
Considering Plaintiff’s total failure to comply with her discovery
obligations, the Court orders sanctions in the reduced amount of $610 per
motion (representing two hours of work at a rate of $225 per hour plus $60.00
filing fee per motion, as no oppositions were filed). Therefore, sanctions are
awarded against Plaintiff in the amount of $1,220 ($610 x two motions to
compel). Plaintiff is ordered to pay sanctions within 15 days of this ruling.
