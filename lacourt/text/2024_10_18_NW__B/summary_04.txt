As for the summary in English text, here it is:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Breanna Rios's request for default judgment against Alexander Gonzalez. The request was filed on June 20, 2024, and the Judge found several deficiencies in the packet submitted by Rios, including a lack of proof of service for the Statement of Damages, an unsigned declaration of nonmilitary status, and an excessive amount of general damages sought. Additionally, the Judge noted that Rios failed to submit admissible evidence substantiating the liability of damages sought against each separate defendant. Therefore, the request for default judgment is denied, and the moving party is ordered to give notice.
