And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's motion for relief from potential waiver of trial by jury. The plaintiff filed a complaint against defendants alleging negligence resulting in severe injuries. The plaintiff posted jury fees late, nearly one year after the statutory deadline, but does not proffer a reason for the delay. The court accepts the late posting for the purposes of CCP ยง 631(f). The plaintiff argues that granting this motion will not pose undue hardship on defendants, as all parties have been preparing for a jury trial and opposing counsel does not intend to oppose the motion. Given the court's liberal policy of granting relief from waiver of trial by jury and defendants' lack of opposition, the plaintiff's motion for relief is granted.
