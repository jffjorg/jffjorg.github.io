COMPLAINT
  FILED: MAY 11, 2022
TRIAL
  DATE: NOVEMBER 18, 2024



 
I.      
BACKGROUND
 
On May 11, 2022, Plaintiff
Greta Manucharova (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Defendants City of
Los Angeles (“City”), Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (“DWP”), 6126
Fulton Apt. LLC (“Fulton”), and Does 1 to 50. Plaintiff alleges two causes of
action against Fulton: (1) premises liability; and (2) negligence. Plaintiff
alleges two causes of action against the City and DWP: (1) dangerous condition
of public property; and (2) governmental liability for government employee
negligence. The complaint arises from a September 14, 2020, incident, in which
Plaintiff tripped while walking the subject sidewalk and suffered injury as a
result. 
 
On September 25, 2023,
Fulton filed a motion for summary judgment on Plaintiff’s claims. 
On June 5, 2024, the matter
was reassigned to the Honorable Judge Moskowitz in Department B of Van Nuys
Courthouse East, effective June 24, 2024.  
No opposition has been
filed.
 
II.      
MOTION FOR SUMMARY
JUDGMENT
Fulton moves for summary
judgment on Plaintiff’s claims for premises liability and negligence. Fulton
alleges that it does not own or control the subject sidewalk which caused
Plaintiff’s injuries, and therefore cannot be held liable to Plaintiff as a
matter of law. 
 
III.      
LEGAL STANDARDS

Burden on Summary Judgment or Summary Adjudication 
In reviewing a motion for
summary judgment, the Court must apply a three-step analysis: (1) identify the
issues framed by the pleadings; (2) determine whether the moving party has met
his or her initial burden; and (3) determine whether the opposition has
demonstrated the existence of a triable, material factual issue.  (Hinesley
v. Oakshade Town Center (2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 289, 294.)  “[T]he
initial burden is always on the moving party to make a prima facie showing that
there are no triable issues of material fact.”  (Scalf v. D.B. Log
Homes, Inc. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1519.) A defendant moving for
summary judgment or summary adjudication has met his or her burden of showing
that a cause of action has no merit if the party has shown that one or more
elements of the cause of action . . . cannot be established, or that there is a
complete defense to the cause of action.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 437c, subd. (p)(2).) 
A moving defendant may
satisfy the initial burden to show that one or more elements cannot be
established by “presenting evidence that conclusively negates an element of the
plaintiff's cause of action or by relying on the plaintiff's factually devoid
discovery responses to show that the plaintiff does not possess, and cannot
reasonably obtain, evidence to establish that element.” (Schmidt v.
Citibank, N.A. (2018) 28 Cal.App.5th 1109, 1119; Aguilar v. Atlantic
Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 856 [It is insufficient for the
defendant to merely point out the absence of evidence.]; Gaggero v. Yura
(2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 884, 891.) The defendant must present evidence,
typically in the form of factually devoid discovery responses, showing that
plaintiff does not have and cannot reasonably obtain evidence to support his or
her claim.” (Ibid.) 
Unless and until a defendant
meets that burden, the plaintiff has no burden to present controverting
evidence. (Consumer Cause, Inc. v. SmileCare (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 454,
468 [“There is no obligation on the opposing party . . . to establish anything
by affidavit unless and until the moving party has by affidavit stated facts
establishing every element . . . necessary to sustain a judgment in his
favor.”].) If a defendant fails to meet that burden, summary judgment must be
denied, even if the plaintiff fails to file an opposition and fails to proffer
any evidence. 
On the other hand, if the
defendant “has met that burden, the burden shifts to the plaintiff . . . to
show that a triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to the cause
of action or a defense thereto.” (CCP § 437c, subd. (p)(2).) The plaintiff may
not merely rely on allegations or denials in its pleadings to show that a
triable issue of material fact exists, but instead “shall set forth the
specific facts showing that a triable issue of material fact exists as to the
cause of action.” (Ibid.) “If the plaintiff cannot do so, summary
judgment should be granted.” (Avivi v. Centro Medico Urgente Medical
Center (2008) 159 Cal.App.4th 463, 467.)      
IV.
DISCUSSION
Defendant’s Burden 
Fulton meets their initial
burden. 
Fulton argues that they are
not liable to Plaintiff as a matter of law because they do not own or control the
sidewalk which caused Plaintiff’s injuries.  
"One
who owns, possesses, or controls [property] has a duty to act reasonably to
protect others from a dangerous condition [stemming from] that property.” (Soto
v. Union Pacific Railroad Co. (2020) 45 Cal.App.5th 168, 177.) “The
‘crucial element’ for imposing a duty in such circumstances is control . . .
the rationale being that whoever has the means to control the property can take
steps to prevent the harm.” (Ibid.) Conversely, “[a] defendant cannot be
held liable for the defective or dangerous condition of property which it did
not own, possess, or control.” (Isaacs v. Huntington Memorial Hospital (1985)
38 Cal.3d 112, 125.) 
The
subject sidewalk adjoins Fulton’s property. An entity may be liable for
injuries to pedestrians on sidewalks abutting their property, as evaluated by
the degree of maintenance performed. (Alpert v. Villa Romano Homeowners
Ass’n (2008) 81 Cal.App.4th 1320, 1334-1335.) “ . . . A landowner or
possessor of land has a duty to take reasonable measures to protect persons
from dangerous conditions on adjoining land when the landowner or possessor
exercises possession or control over that adjacent land.” (Ibid.) 
Here, Fulton sets forth
facts establishing that they did not own or control the sidewalk at the time of
Plaintiff’s injuries. Fulton claims it did not, at any time, undertake
maintenance, control, or ownership of the sidewalk where Plaintiff tripped.
(Fulton Separate Statement of Facts (“F-SSF”) No. 7; McDeyer Decl. ¶¶ 4-6;
Villa Decl. ¶¶ 3-6.) The subject sidewalk is owned and maintained by the City
and DPW. (F-SSF No. 8; DeBlanc Decl. Exh. C [DPW’s responses to Set One of
Fulton’s Special Interrogatories, p. 3:2-8, 16-23].) 
Therefore, Fulton has set
forth sufficient evidence demonstrating that it does not own, possess, or
control the subject sidewalk which caused Plaintiff’s injuries. 
The burden now shifts to
Plaintiff. 
Plaintiff’s Burden 
Unless and until a defendant
meets that burden, the plaintiff has no burden to present controverting
evidence. (Consumer Cause, Inc. v. SmileCare (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 454,
468 [“There is no obligation on the opposing party . . . to establish anything
by affidavit unless and until the moving party has by affidavit stated facts
establishing every element . . . necessary to sustain a judgment in his
favor.”].) 
Fulton has met its initial
burden. Therefore, to survive summary judgment, Plaintiff has a burden to
present controverting evidence. Plaintiff did file an opposition or provide
controverting evidence. Accordingly, the Court grants Fulton’s motion for
summary judgment. 
 
IV.    CONCLUSION
            No
triable issue of material fact exists as to Fulton’s ownership or control over
the subject sidewalk. Accordingly, Fulton’s motion for summary judgment is
GRANTED. 
            Moving
party is ordered to give notice.
