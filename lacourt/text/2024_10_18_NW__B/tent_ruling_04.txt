Alexander Sisco, et al.

 

 
Plaintiff Breanna
Rios’s Request for Default Judgment
 
Defendant: Alexander Gonzalez
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
Plaintiff Breanna Rios’s request for
default judgment is DENIED.
            
BACKGROUND
 
This action arises from a June 4, 2020,
motor vehicle accident in which Plaintiffs Maria Quintero (“Quintero”) and
Breanna Rios (“Rios”) (collectively “Plaintiffs”) allege to have been lawfully turning
on a green arrow when Defendant Kandice Alexander Sisco (“Sisco”), negligently
operating a vehicle owned by Defendant Anthony Gonzalez (“Gonzalez”)
(collectively “Defendants”), ran a red light and collided with Plaintiffs.
(Complaint ¶ 11.) Plaintiffs allege injuries and property damage as a result. (Ibid.)
 
On May 23, 2022, Plaintiffs filed a
complaint against Defendants alleging one cause of negligence against Sisco and
one cause of motor vehicle owner liability against Gonzalez.
 
On May 7, 2024, default was entered
against Gonzalez.
 
On June 5, 2024, the case was reassigned
to the Honorable Karen Moskowitz in Department B at Van Nuys Courthouse East,
effective June 24, 2024.
 
On June 20, 2024, Rios filed the instant request
for default judgment against Gonzalez.
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 585
permits entry of a default judgment after a party has failed to timely respond
or appear. (Code Civ. Proc., § 585.) A party seeking judgment on the default by
the court must file a Request for Court Judgment, and: (1) a brief summary of
the case; (2) declarations or other admissible evidence in support of the
judgment requested; (3) interest computations as necessary; (4) a memorandum of
costs and disbursements; (5) declaration of nonmilitary status; (6) a proposed
form of judgment; (7) a dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not
sought or an application for separate judgment under CCP § 579, supported by a
showing of grounds for each judgment; (8) exhibits as necessary; and (9) a
request for attorney’s fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the
parties. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1800.) 
 
ANALYSIS
 
Plaintiff’s default judgment packet
contains the following deficiencies:
 
1.     
Statement of Damages was not served
before default was entered. Default was entered on May 7, 2024. Statement of
Damages was filed on June 20, 2024. No proof of service for Statement of
Damages has been filed. (CCP § 425.11(c) and (d).)
2.     
Declaration of nonmilitary status is not
signed. (CRC 3.1800(a)(5).)
3.     
Default judgment seeks principal damages
greater than the amount requested in the Statement of Damages. 
4.     
General damages sought are approximately
22x the amount of special damages claimed. General damages should be 5x or
less.
5.     
Plaintiff has not submitted admissible
evidence substantiating the liability of damages sought against each separate
defendant. (CRC 3.1800(a)(7).)
 
Therefore,
Plaintiff’s request for default judgment against Alexander Gonzalez is DENIED.
 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice.
