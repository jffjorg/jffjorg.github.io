The Complaint asserted a surplus of $150,209.15 from foreclosure sale proceeds concerning real property located at 23414 Walnut Street, Torrance, CA 90501 (“Property”) was available and that the Defendants have some right, title, estate, lien or other interest in the Property.On August 19, 2021, this Court granted Plaintiff’s Motion for Order Discharging Stakeholder and Awarding Reasonable Attorney’s Fees and Costs in the sum of $71,777.80 from the deposited surplus funds. Defendant Carlos Garau and Olga Garau appealed this order.On January 30, 2024, the Court of Appeals affirmed the August 19 order. On April 4, 2024, the Court of Appeals issued a Remittur and awarded Plaintiff costs on appeal.LEGAL AUTHORITYPursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 386.6, “A party to an action who follows the procedure set forth in Section 386 or 386.5 may insert in his motion, petition, complaint, or cross complaint a request for allowance of his costs and reasonable attorney fees incurred in such action. In ordering the discharge of such party, the court may, in its discretion, award such party his costs and reasonable attorney fees from the amount in dispute which has been deposited with the court. At the time of final judgment in the action the court may make such further provision for assumption of such costs and attorney fees by one or more of the adverse claimants as may appear proper.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 386.6(a).)“Section 386.6, subdivision (a), gives the trial court authority to award attorney fees to the [Plaintiff] for fees and costs incurred not only to initiate the Interpleader Case and obtain discharge, but also to defend against subsequent motions, writ petitions, and appeals attacking the validity of the interpleader complaint and discharge order.” (Southern California Gas Co. v. Flannery (2016) 5 Cal.App.5th 476, 486.)DISCUSSIONPlaintiff moves for an award of reasonable attorney’s fees and costs in the sum of $34,703.40 to be paid from the interpleader funds deposited with the Court following the Court of Appeals’ Opinion affirming this Court’s August 19, 2021 order discharging Plaintiff and awarding reasonable attorney’s fees.Here, Defendants Olga Garau and Carlos Garau challenged the validity of the August 19, 2021 order by filing an appeal. Subsequently, the Court of Appeals affirmed the August 19 order and awarded Plaintiff costs on appeal. (Appeal Remittur 4/4/24.) Plaintiff advances the declaration of its counsel, Cris A. Klingerman, attesting to the work performed, hours expended, and fees incurred to defend the order of discharge on appeal. (Klingerman Decl., ¶¶6-10.) Plaintiff also filed a Memorandum of Costs on Appeal. (MOC 5/8/24.) Plaintiff has sufficiently established that 62.95 hours were expended on defending the August 19 order on appeal, which was filed on May 20, 2019 and not resolved until April 4, 2024. Furthermore, Plaintiff seeks costs in the amount of $478.40 consisting of $390.00 for filing fees and $88.40 for transmitting, filing, and serving of record, briefs, and other papers, which are allowable pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section1033.5(a)(1) and California Rules of Court, Rule 8.891(d)(1)(D). However, Plaintiff requests fees in anticipation of responding to opposition and appearance for a total of $2,750.00 consisting of 5.50 hours at $500.00 per hour. Defendants Olga Garau and Carlos Garau did not file an opposition, thus these anticipated fees are deducted from the attorney’s fees requested by Plaintiff.Therefore, Plaintiff Barrett Daffin Frappier Treder & Weiss, LLP’s Motion for Attorney’s Fees is GRANTED in the amount of $31,953.40.Moving party is ordered to give notice of ruling.
