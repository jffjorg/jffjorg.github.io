  Case Number:  20STCV44417    Hearing Date:   October 22, 2024    Dept:  T Motion for Order Permitting Filing of Amended Memorandum of Costs and Entering New Judgment Moving Party: Plaintiff Dylan Blaze HuertaResponding Party: Defendants Monika Arakse Mkhitaryan and Armenuhi YeginyanTentative Ruling: GrantBACKGROUNDPlaintiff Dylan Blaze Huerta filed this personal injury action against defendants Monika Arakse Mkhitaryan and Armenuhi Yeginyan on November 19, 2020. The case was tried to a jury, and the Court entered judgment in Plaintiff’s favor on August 6, 2024.On August 13, 2024, Plaintiff filed his memorandum of costs. On August 21, 2024, Defendants filed their motion to tax. On September 11, 2024, Plaintiff filed his opposition to Defendant’s motion.In his September 11, 2024 opposition, Plaintiff for the first time sought prejudgment interest based on Defendants’ rejection of Plaintiff’s settlement offer made pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 998.On September 24, 2024, the Court heard Defendants’ motion to tax. As to prejudgment interest, the Court ruled that Plaintiff’s request was untimely because it was not included in his initial memorandum, but raised for the first time in his opposition to Defendants’ motion to tax.On September 25, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant motion for relief under Code of Civil Procedure section 473(b). Plaintiff seeks leave to file an amended costs memorandum including his claim for prejudgment interest.On October 8, 2024, Defendants filed their opposition. On October 15, 2024, Plaintiff filed his reply.MOVING PARTY POSITIONPlaintiff argues he failed to submit a claim for prejudgment interest due to his counsel’s mistake or excusable neglect. OPPOSITIONDefendants argue Plaintiff’s counsel’s mistake or neglect is not excusable. They also argue the proper vehicle for relief is a motion for reconsideration under Code of Civil Procedure section 1008, and Plaintiff is also not entitled to reconsideration under that section.REPLYIn reply, Plaintiff reemphasizes the arguments raised in his motion.ANALYSISI. Legal StandardCode of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b) provides for either discretionary or mandatory relief from certain prior actions or proceedings in the trial court. (Luri¿v. Greenwald¿ (2003) 107 Cal.App.4th 1119, 1124.)¿¿“ ‘Under the discretionary relief provision, on a showing of “mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect,”¿the court has discretion to allow relief from a “judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken against”¿a party or his or her attorney.¿”  (Ibid.; Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b).)¿¿The party seeking such relief must do so “within a reasonable time, in no case exceeding six months, after the judgment, dismissal, order, or proceeding was taken.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b); see Rappleyea v. Campbell (1994) 8 Cal.4th 975, 980.)II. DiscussionPlaintiff moves for relief pursuant to section 473(b), permitting the Court to relieve a party from an order entered due to the party or its counsel’s excusable neglect.The Court has broad discretion to permit a late-filed costs memorandum according to section 473. (See Pollard v. Saxe & Yolles Dev. Co. (1974) 12 Cal.3d 374, 381; Russell v. Trans Pacific Group (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 1717, 1728-1729; Wilson v. Hinkle (1977) 67 Cal.App.3d 506, 513; LeDeit v. Ehlert (1962) 205 Cal.App.2d 154, 169-170.)Plaintiff’s counsel submits a declaration attesting that his standard practice is to submit a prejudgment interest claim pursuant to CCP 998 via a supplemental memorandum. (Ksajikian Decl., ¶ 8.) Due to inadvertent administrative error, the supplemental memorandum, though fully prepared for filing, was not submitted to the Court. (Id., ¶ 9.)Defendants argue Plaintiff’s mistake was not excusable because he knew at least as early as September 11, 2024 that he had not filed a supplemental memorandum including prejudgment interest, but he did not file this motion until after the hearing on September 24, 2024. The Court does not believe the thirteen-day lapse renders the mistake inexcusable, particularly when Plaintiff could not have known the outcome of the request for interest he made in his opposition. Plaintiff filed this motion promptly the day following the hearing, as soon as it was certain that 473 relief would be required.Counsel’s mistake was inadvertent and excusable. Defendants do not argue they will be prejudiced by a late-filed supplemental memorandum. Discretionary relief is warranted.Defendant separately argues Plaintiff must move the Court to reconsider its order on Defendant’s motion to tax, rather than moving for relief under section 473. Defendants do not cite authority for the proposition that 473 relief is unavailable or that reconsideration is Plaintiff’s sole vehicle for relief. Their argument is unpersuasive.RULINGThe motion is granted. The Court vacates only the portion of its September 24, 2024 order denying prejudgment interest.Plaintiff is ordered to separately file his supplemental memorandum within three (3) days of this order. Defendant may proceed to challenge prejudgment interest via a second motion to tax, should it choose to do so, within the statutorily prescribed time following Plaintiff’s supplemental filing.An amended judgment will be permitted upon resolution of the prejudgment interest award.
