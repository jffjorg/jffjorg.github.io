MOTION TO BE
RELEIVED AS COUNSEL
 
Motion filed on 11/6/24.
 
MOVING ATTORNEY: Zaneta Conroy
CLIENT: Plaintiff Jairo Espress Melendez
 
RULING: The motion is placed off calendar.
 
On 11/6/24, attorney Zaneta Conroy filed and served the
instant motion to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff Jairo Espress Melendez
in this action on the ground that there are irreconcilable differences between
the client and the firm regarding the future course of this action.
 
The declaration filed in support of the motion indicates
that the client’s address was confirmed by mail, return receipt requested.  However, the proofs of service attached to
the motion documents indicate that the motion was served only by electronic
mail on defense counsel and on Plaintiff/the client.  No electronic address has been set forth for
Plaintiff/the client in the proofs of service. 
Additionally, no return receipt has been filed.  Plaintiff/the client has not responded to the
motion to cure the defect in notice.
