And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to appoint a neutral arbitrator. The plaintiff had filed the motion after the defendant agreed to arbitrate via JAMS Streamlined Rules & Procedures, but the plaintiff did not agree with this choice. The judge found that the arbitration agreement in the lease provides a method for selecting an arbitrator, which is to use the National Center for Dispute Resolution (NCDS) or another organization upon which the parties agree. The judge noted that the plaintiff failed to provide any authority that would allow the court to order arbitration by one of the organizations requested by the plaintiff, and that the defendant's approval is required if NCDS is not used. Therefore, the judge denied the motion and instructed the parties to use the NCDS or another organization that they agree upon.
