Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the defendants' motion to transfer the venue of the case to the Superior Court of California for Stanislaus County is granted. The court finds that the defendants reside in Stanislaus County, and the plaintiff has not presented any reasons why the case should remain in the Los Angeles County court where it was originally filed. The court orders the plaintiff to pay all fees associated with the transfer before the case is transferred to Stanislaus County. Additionally, the court awards the defendants their reasonable expenses and attorney's fees incurred in making the motion, in the amount of $780.00 if counsel appears at the hearing, or $580.00 if no appearance is made. The court also orders the plaintiff to pay these fees and costs within 30 days.
