And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding a minor's compromise petition. The petition was filed on November 5, 2024, and the hearing date is December 3, 2024. The minor, Jesus Vergara Garcia, suffered injuries in a motor vehicle accident on July 24, 2023, and is seeking a settlement with the defendants, Carlos Macario and Jose Perez.

The Judge notes that the petition and proposed order contain several defects, including the absence of appearances by the defendants, inconsistencies in the request for an order to pay settlement sums to the Client Trust Account, and inaccuracies in the medical expenses. The Judge also notes that the attorney declaration refers to the minor's father/GAL as Miguel Vergara Garcia, while the petition refers to him as Miguel Vergara Medina.

The Judge is requesting additional information and clarification on several points, including the need for an additional order, the consistency of medical expenses, and the identity of the person who signed the Retainer Agreement. The Judge is also requiring the attorney to electronically bookmark the exhibits submitted in support of the petition.
