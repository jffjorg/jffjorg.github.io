And here is a summary in English text:

The Honorable [Judge's Name] issued a tentative ruling in the case of 20CHCV00648. The case involves a dispute between neighbors, Alex Alvarado and Patricia Alvarado (the Alvarados) and Michael Meadows and Althea Meadows (the Meadows). The Alvarados filed a demurrer to the entire cross-complaint alleging that the Meadows failed to obtain leave of court to file the cross-complaint. The Judge ruled that the demurrer is overruled and the answer is due within 20 days.

The Judge also addressed the Alvarados' demurrer to the 1st cause of action in the cross-complaint for Breach of Ridgeview Saugus Homeowners' Association's Governing Documents. The Alvarados argued that the Meadows lack standing to enforce the HOA's governing documents against them, but the Judge found that the Meadows have standing to pursue their first cause of action. The Judge also found that the Alvarados' assertion of multiple causes of action against the Meadows for violations of the same governing documents in their First Amended Complaint indicates that the servitudes may be enforced by an owner.

The Judge's ruling is based on California Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) § 428.50, CCP § 430.10, CCP § 435(b)(1), CCP § 436(b), and Civil Code 5975, as well as the Davis-Stirling Act.
