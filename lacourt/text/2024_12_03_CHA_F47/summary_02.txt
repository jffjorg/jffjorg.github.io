Judge's Tentative Ruling:

The motion filed by attorney Zaneta Conroy on November 6, 2024, to be relieved as counsel for plaintiff Jairo Espress Melendez is placed off calendar. The motion was filed due to irreconcilable differences between the client and the firm regarding the future course of the action. The declaration filed in support of the motion indicates that the client's address was confirmed by mail, but the proofs of service attached to the motion documents only show service by electronic mail. No return receipt has been filed, and the plaintiff/client has not responded to the motion to cure the defect in notice.
