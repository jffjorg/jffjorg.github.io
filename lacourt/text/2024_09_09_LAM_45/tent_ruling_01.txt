Background
            Plaintiff
Shahab Khangholi worked as the Finance Manager of Patriot Hyundai of El Monte
from June 13, 2020 through July 20, 2020. 
Plaintiff alleges Defendant failed to pay him all commissions and
earnings owed to him.  On February 24,
2021, Plaintiff filed a complaint against Defendant Patriot Hyundai of El Monte
alleging (1) wrongful termination in violation of Labor Code §1102.5(b); (2)
wrongful termination in violation of Public Policy; (3) failure to pay wages in
violation of Labor Code §§201, 204.1; (4) violation of Business and Professions
Code §17200; (5) waiting time penalties in violation of Labor Code §203; (6)
NIED; (7) IIED; and (8) violation of Labor Code §§1198.5 and 432.  
            On
March 28, 2023, Plaintiff filed an amendment to the complaint naming Sam Agha
as DOE 1.
            On
November 6, 2023, Defendant Sam Agha filed a demurrer and motion to strike to
the complaint.  On August 14, 2024,
Plaintiff filed oppositions to the demurrer and motion to strike.  On August 20, 2024, Defendant Agha filed
replies to Plaintiff’s oppositions.
Legal
Standard
A demurrer for
sufficiency tests whether the complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v.
Mirada (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) A demurrer tests the pleadings
alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters. Therefore, the defects
must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial notice.
(Code Civ. Proc., §§ 430.30, 430.70; Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co.
(2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) At the pleading stage, a plaintiff need only
allege ultimate facts sufficient to apprise the defendant of the factual basis
for the claim against him.  (Semole v.
Sansoucie (1972) 28 Cal. App. 3d 714, 721.) 
The court assumes the truth of the complaint’s properly pleaded or
implied factual allegations. (E-Fab, Inc. v. Accountants, Inc. Servs.
(2007) 153 Cal.App.4th 1308, 1315.)  A
“demurrer does not, however, admit contentions, deductions or conclusions of
fact or law alleged in the pleading, or the construction of instruments
pleaded, or facts impossible in law.”  (S.
Shore Land Co. v. Petersen (1964) 226 Cal.App.2d 725, 732.)   
Discussion
            Meet and Confer Requirement
            Defendant Agha submits a meet and
confer declaration in compliance with CCP §430.41.  (Demurrer, Moussly Dec., ¶4.)  Parties met and conferred on October 30, 2023
over the telephone and were unable to resolve the issues raised in the demurrer
and motion to strike.  
            Parties’ Positions
            Defendant Agha demurs to each of the
eight causes of action alleged in the complaint.  Defendant Agha argues (1) the first and
second causes of action for violation of Labor Code §1102.5 and wrongful
termination in violation of public policy can only be brought against an
employer, not supervisors, and it is unclear from the complaint what Agha’s
relationship to Plaintiff was; (2) the third, fourth and fifth causes of action
for wage and hour violations fail because there are no allegations as to Agha’s
acts or omissions or his role in the relevant events; (3) the sixth and seventh
causes of action for NIED and IIED are barred by workers’ compensation
exclusivity; (4) the seventh cause of action for IIED fails to allege
outrageous conduct; and (5) the eighth cause of action for violation of Labor
Code §1198.5 fails to allege any facts that would make Agha liable for failing
to allow Plaintiff access to copy his employment records.  
            Defendant Agha also moves to strike
the punitive damages allegations, because there are no allegations that would
support a finding that he acted with fraud, malice or oppression.  Defendant maintains there are no facts of any
kind alleged as to him.
            In response, Plaintiff argues (1) an
individual can be held liable for violation of Labor Code §1102.5 and the case
law cited by Defendant pertains to FEHA violations; (2) the third, fourth and
fifth causes of action for wage and hour violations are sufficiently alleged
based on the allegations that Agha and his son were active in the day-to-day
operations of the Agah’s business, Defendant Patriot Hyundai of El Monte; (3) workers’
compensation exclusivity does not apply to emotional distress damages
attributed to conduct outside the normal risks of the employment relationship;
(4) the conduct alleged, intentional failure to pay commissions due and
interfering with Plaintiff’s ability to earn commissions, is outrageous
conduct; and (5) the eighth cause of action is sufficiently stated against Agha
as Plaintiff’s employer based on his refusal to provide Plaintiff’s payroll
records.  
            Plaintiff opposes the motion to
strike on grounds that Agha’s conduct in withholding his wages was intentional
and malicious.  Plaintiff argues the
Court should not consider any arguments raised for the first time on reply.
            In reply, Defendant argues the (1)
first and second causes of action can only be alleged against an employer, not
a supervisor; (2) the third, fourth and fifth causes of action for wage and
hour violations fail because there are no allegations that Agha is either Plaintiff’s
employer or  person acting on behalf of
the employer; (3) workers’ compensation exclusivity bars Plaintiff’s claims for
NIED and IIED because the failure to pay wages is within the normal employment
relationship; (4) the IIED claim fails because failure to pay wages is not
outrageous conduct and there are no allegations of severe emotional distress;
and (5) the eighth cause of action for violation of Labor Code §1198.5 fails
because Agha is not Plaintiff’s employer. 
For these same reasons, Defendant argues the punitive damages
allegations must be stricken.  
            Defendant Agha’s Demurrer is sustained with 10 days
leave to amend as to the first through fifth and eighth causes of action
            The complaint fails to contain any
allegations as to Defendant Agha’s role in the alleged events or his
relationship to Plaintiff.  Plaintiff’s
opposition argues the causes of action against Agha are sufficiently alleged,
because he was Plaintiff’s employer and that Patriot Hyundai of El Monte was
Agha’s business.  However, nowhere in the
complaint does Plaintiff allege that DOE 1, or Agha, was his employer, what Agha’s
relationship or role was in Defendant Patriot Hyundai of El Monte or how Agha
was involved in the alleged wrongful conduct. 
The only employer alleged in the complaint is Patriot Hyundai of El
Monte.  (Complaint, ¶7.)  
            Without this basic information, the
complaint fails to state a cause of action against Agha.  Moreover, until Plaintiff clearly alleges Agha’s
status in this action, the Court cannot assess Defendant’s arguments that the
first through fifth and eighth causes of action cannot be alleged against Agha,
because he was not an owner, employer or agent of the employer.
            Sixth and seventh Causes of Action for NIED and IIED
barred by workers’ compensation exclusivity
            “Where the conditions of compensation set forth in
Section 3600 concur, the right to recover compensation is, except as
specifically provided in this section and Sections 3706 and 4558, the sole and
exclusive remedy of the employee or his or her dependents against the employer.
The fact that either the employee or the employer also occupied another or dual
capacity prior to, or at the time of, the employee's industrial injury shall
not permit the employee or his or her dependents to bring an action at law for
damages against the employer.”  (Labor
Code §3602.)
            Workers’ compensation is the
exclusive remedy for a claim based on conduct that occurred in the normal
course of the employer-employee relationship. 
(Miklosy v. Regents of University of California (2008) 44 Cal.4th
876, 902.)  A claim for emotional
distress based on conduct in the workplace is not subject to Worker’s
Compensation Exclusivity under certain circumstances, such as when it is
outside the normal relationship or a violation of public policy.  (Smith v. International Brotherhood of
Electrical Workers (2003) 109 Cal.App.4th 1637, 1658.)  Garden variety termination of employment is
not outside the normality of an employment relationship without further facts
placing it outside the normal relationship. 
(Shoemaker v. Myers (1990) 52 Cal.3d 1, 25.)
            “A number of California authorities
have concluded claims for intentional infliction of emotional distress in the
employment context may be asserted where the actionable conduct also forms the
basis for a FEHA violation.”  (Light
v. Department of Parks & Recreation (2017) 14 Cal.App.5th 75, 97.)  Thus, where the emotional distress results
from unlawful discrimination or other misconduct that “exceeds the normal part
of the employment relationship” exclusivity does not apply.  (Livitsanos v. Sup.Ct. (Continental
Culture Specialists, Inc.) (1992) 2 Cal.4th 744, 756 (emotional distress
resulting from employer's defamation and harassment); Nazir v. United
Airlines, Inc. (2009) 178 Cal.App.4th 243, 288.)  Several cases have held that the exclusivity
of workers’ compensation law does not apply to emotional distress caused by
workplace discrimination.  (Cornell v.
Berkeley Tennis Club (2017) 18 Cal.App.5th 908, 946 (plaintiff can pursue
IIED claim in employment context where conduct at issue violates FEHA, but
finding plaintiff failed to satisfy IIED elements); Light v. California
Dept. of Parks & Recreation (2017) 14 Cal.App.5th 75, 101 (emotional
distress based on discrimination and retaliation alleged to violate FEHA); Fretland
v. County of Humboldt (1999) 69 Cal.App.4th 1478, 1492 (emotional distress
resulting from alleged work-related injury discrimination); Murray v.
Oceanside Unified School Dist. (2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 1338, 1362 (abrogated
on other grounds by Hart v. National Mortg. & Land Co. (1987) 189
Cal.App.3d 1420)(emotional distress allegedly resulting from continuing pattern
of workplace harassment based on sexual orientation).)
            As
to the sixth and seventh causes of action for NIED and IIED, Plaintiff’s complaint
fails to allege any emotional distress arising out of acts that fall outside
the normal scope of an employment relationship. 
Plaintiff’s NIED and IIED claims are based on Defendant’s alleged
failure to pay him wages and commissions due and the failure to provide him
with requested payroll records.  As such,
both these claims are based on conduct that falls within the normal scope of an
employment relationship and does not rise to the level, for example, of
intentional discrimination or sexual harassment.  
            Plaintiff
fails to identify any additional facts he can allege that would remove his
claims for NIED and IIED from the normal scope of the employment
relationship.  Plaintiff has the burden
of establishing that the defects are reasonably capable of cure with leave to
amend.  (Hendy v. Losse (1991) 54 Cal.3d
723, 742.)  Plaintiff fails to carry that
burden as to the NIED and IIED claim.
            Defendant’s
demurrer to the sixth and seventh causes of action for NIED and IIED is
sustained without leave to amend based on workers’ compensation exclusivity.
            Plaintiff
fails to allege outrageous conduct in the seventh cause of action for IIED
            To
state an IIED claim, the plaintiff must allege facts showing: (1) extreme and
outrageous conduct by the defendant with the intention of causing, or reckless
disregard of the probability of causing, emotional distress; (2) the
plaintiff's suffering severe or extreme emotional distress; and (3) actual and
proximate causation of the emotional distress by the defendant's outrageous
conduct.  (Smith v. BP Lubricants USA
Inc. (2021) 64 Cal.App.5th 138, 147 (plaintiff alleged outrageous conduct
based on three racially offensive statements made by defendant’s employee
before 50 of plaintiff’s coworkers and 3 of his supervisors); Berkley v.
Dowds (2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 518, 534 (affirming order sustaining demurrer
to IIED cause of action without leave to amend based on failure to allege
outrageous conduct).)  “Only emotional
distress of such substantial quantity or enduring quality that an individual in
civilized society should not be expected to endure it constitutes severe
emotional distress.”  (Angie M. v.
Supr. Ct. (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1217, 1227.)  
            Whether
conduct is outrageous is usually a question of fact but can be determined as an
issue of law.  (Smith, supra, 64
Cal.App.5th at 147.)  “Mere insulting
language, without more, ordinarily would not constitute extreme outrage unless
it is combined with aggravated circumstances. 
But behavior may be considered outrageous if a defendant (1) abuses a
relation or position which gives him power to damage the plaintiff's interest;
(2) knows the plaintiff is susceptible to injuries through mental distress; or
(3) acts intentionally or unreasonably with the recognition that the acts are
likely to result in illness through mental distress.”  (Id. at 147.)
            The
only conduct alleged in support of the seventh cause of action is incorporated
by reference.  Plaintiff alleges
Defendant failed to pay him his full wages and commissions, only paying him
$1700 in commissions.  (Complaint, ¶¶11-17).  Nonpayment of full wages alone, even if
intentional, would not rise to the level of outrageous conduct.  For this additional reason, Defendant Agha’s
demurrer to the IIED claim is sustained. 

            Motion
to Strike
            In
light of the Court’s ruling on the demurrer, the motion to strike is moot.  
            
             
 
 
            It
is so ordered.
