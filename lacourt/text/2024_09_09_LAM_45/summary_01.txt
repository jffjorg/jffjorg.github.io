And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Shahab Khangholi vs. Patriot Hyundai of El Monte, Sam Agha. The court has sustained the demurrer to the first through fifth and eighth causes of action with 10 days leave to amend, meaning that the plaintiff must re-file the complaint with additional information. The court has also sustained the demurrer to the sixth and seventh causes of action for NIED and IIED without leave to amend, meaning that the plaintiff cannot re-file those claims. The court has further sustained the demurrer to the IIED claim, finding that the alleged conduct is not outrageous.

The court's ruling is based on the plaintiff's failure to provide sufficient information to support the claims, particularly with regard to Sam Agha's role in the alleged wrongful conduct. The court has also found that the alleged conduct falls within the normal scope of an employment relationship and is therefore not actionable.

The motion to strike is moot in light of the court's ruling on the demurrer. The court's tentative ruling is subject to change based on further briefing and argument from the parties.
