And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has sustained Defendant Hamilton's demurrer to Plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint (SAC) without leave to amend. The judge has previously sustained demurrers to Plaintiff's original complaint and First Amended Complaint due to defects in the pleadings. The SAC is also defective, as it fails to allege sufficient facts to state a cause of action for wrongful death, personal injury, or property damage. The judge has determined that the SAC is conclusory and impermissibly vague and uncertain, and that it fails to allege a legal basis for the claims. Additionally, the judge has determined that the SAC is barred by the statute of limitations for wrongful death and property damage claims. The judge has ordered Defendant Hamilton to give notice, and has required Plaintiff to explain how he plans to move forward with his claims if granted an additional leave to amend.
