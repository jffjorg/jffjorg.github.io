And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has granted Plaintiff Jeanne Robinson's motion for trial preference due to her poor health. The court finds that she has a substantial interest in the action and that her health is such that a preference is necessary to prevent prejudicing her interest in the litigation. The court also finds that Plaintiff's declarations provide sufficient information about her current medical condition, treatment, and short-term prognosis. The trial is scheduled for February 20, 2024, and the parties are to meet and confer on a trial setting order.
