At all relevant times, Plaintiff was a resident and tenant of 11651 York Ave #4, Hawthorne, CA 90250 (the “Property”). Compl., ¶ 1. From the day Plaintiff moved into the Property and throughout his tenancy, there have been substandard conditions affecting the habitability of the Property. Compl., ¶ 13. Those habitability problems include maggot infestation, electric issues, and severe water damage on the ceilings. Compl., ¶¶ 14, 15. The defendants were aware of those conditions but not only failed to cure them, but refused to do so throughout the lease. Compl., ¶ 28.On 10/16/2023, Plaintiff amended the complaint to substitute J.K.

Legal Standard for Motions to Compel Initial Responses to InterrogatoriesWithin 30 days after service of interrogatories, the responding party shall serve responses to the discovery unless, on motion of the propounding party, the court has shortened the time for response, or, on motion of the responding party, the court has extended the time for response. Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subd. (a).Failure to serve timely responses results in the responding party waiving their right to object to the discovery unless the court, on motion, relieves the party from the waiver. Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).In addition, if a party fails to serve timely responses, the party making the discovery request may move for an order compelling responses. Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (b).Monetary sanctions shall be imposed against any party who unsuccessfully opposes motions to compel responses to interrogatories unless the court finds that “the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (c).B. Legal Standard for Sanctions Based on Misuse of the Discovery Process“Misuses of the discovery process include, but are not limited to, the following: ¶ …. ¶ …. ¶ …. ¶ (d) Failing to respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery. ¶ …. ¶ …. ¶ (g) Disobeying a court order to provide discovery.” Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (a)(1).“To the extent authorized by the chapter governing any particular discovery method or any other provision of this title, the court, after notice to any affected party, person, or attorney, and after opportunity for hearing, may impose the following sanctions against anyone engaging in conduct that is a misuse of the discovery process:(a) The court may impose a monetary sanction ordering that one engaging in the misuse of the discovery process, or any attorney advising that conduct, or both pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct. …. If a monetary sanction is authorized by any provision of this title, the court shall impose that sanction unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.(b) The court may impose an issue sanction ordering that designated facts shall be taken as established in the action in accordance with the claim of the party adversely affected by the misuse of the discovery process. The court may also impose an issue sanction by an order prohibiting any party engaging in the misuse of the discovery process from supporting or opposing designated claims or defenses.(c) The court may impose an evidence sanction ….(d) The court may impose a terminating sanction ….”Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030.DISCUSSIONA. Motion to Compel Initial Responses to Plaintiff’s Special InterrogatoriesPlaintiff’s counsel testifies that on February 6, 2024, he served Defendant with Plaintiff’s Special Interrogatories (Set Two) by electronic service, but no responses have been served. Declaration of Joshua Greer, filed March 22, 2024 (“Greer Decl.”), ¶¶ 4, 5; Exhibit A – a copy of the interrogatories.Defendant has not filed any opposition to the motion.Accordingly, in light of Plaintiff’s counsel’s declaration, the request to compel Defendant’s responses to the interrogatories is granted.Plaintiff moves for an order imposing sanctions of $1,084.80 against Defendant and its counsel of record, Ronald Whitaker, jointly and severally. The requested amount consists of 2.4 hours Plaintiff’s counsel spent on the moving papers at a billing rate of $452 per hour. Greer Decl., ¶ 6.The Court finds the requested sanctions reasonable and grants them against Defendant only, not defense counsel.B. Motion for Issue and Monetary SanctionsPlaintiff also moves for an order imposing issue and monetary sanctions against Defendant for disobeying the Court’s order on February 28, 2024, requiring the Defendant to serve further responses to Plaintiff’s Form Interrogatories, Nos. 4.1 and 12.1, Special Interrogatories Nos. 4, 5, 6, 9, 15, and 42, Requests for Production, Nos. 7, 8, 9, and 21, and Requests for Admission Nos. 3, 4, and 9.As issue sanctions, Plaintiff seeks an order:(1) Preventing Defendant from introducing any evidence, either directly or tangentially through the testimony of any expert witness or expert witnessdisclosures or otherwise, pertaining to maintenance performed by Defendant in Plaintiff’s rental unit related to mold and mold remediation;(2) Preventing Defendant from arguing that they did not have any notice of Plaintiff suffering from health conditions;(3) Preventing Defendant from introducing any evidence, directly or tangentially, of any maintenance or corrective efforts pertaining to water leaks from January 2016 until present; and(4) That RFA 9 be deemed admitted.Motion, p. 2:11-20.Plaintiff’s counsel attests to the following facts in support of the motion. Defendant has not provided the discovery responses despite the parties conferring regarding the discovery, the parties attending an Informal Discovery Conference on November 21, 2023, the court’s order on February 28, 2024, and Plaintiff’s offer to give Defendant until March 20, 2024, to serve the responses. Declaration of Joshua Greer, Esq. In Support Of Plaintiff’s Motion for Issue and Monetary Sanctions, filed March 22, 2024 (“Greer Decl.”), ¶¶ 2-11. Instead, on the deadline that Plaintiff’s counsel had proposed, March 20, 2024, defense counsel emailed stating that Defendant planned to serve the discovery responses by that date, but Defendant was still gathering documents. Greer Decl., ¶ 12. Defense counsel requested until March 27, 2024, but Plaintiff filed this motion on March 22, 2024, before that date. Greer Decl., ¶ 12.Neither party has filed any papers updating the court regarding whether the defendant eventually served the required discovery responses.“The trial court has broad discretion in selecting discovery sanctions, subject to reversal only for abuse. [Citations.] The trial court should consider both the conduct being sanctioned and its effect on the party seeking discovery and, in choosing a sanction, should ‘“attempt [ ] to tailor the sanction to the harm caused by the withheld discovery.”’ [Citation.]” Doppes v. Bentley Motors, Inc. (2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 967, 992 (“Doppes”).“The trial court cannot impose sanctions for misuse of the discovery process as a punishment.” Doppes, supra, 174 Cal.App.4th at p. 992.Further, “discovery statutes evince an incremental approach to discovery sanctions, starting with monetary sanctions and ending with the ultimate sanction of termination. ‘Discovery sanctions “should be appropriate to the dereliction, and should not exceed that which is required to protect the interests of the party entitled to but denied discovery.”’ [Citations.]”. Doppes, supra, 174 Cal.App.4th at p. 992.“If a lesser sanction fails to curb misuse, a greater sanction is warranted: continuing misuses of the discovery process warrant incrementally harsher sanctions until the sanction is reached that will curb the abuse.” Doppes, supra, 174 Cal.App.4th at p. 992.The court finds that Defendant has misused the discovery process by failing to respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery and disobeying a court order to provide discovery.However, the court finds that issue sanctions are not warranted at this time, given that Defendant indicated it was willing to comply with the court’s order dated February 28, 2024, but only needed more time.Instead, the court finds additional monetary sanctions proper.Plaintiff seeks sanctions of $8,407.20. The amount consists of 4.2 hours counsel spent on the moving papers, 1 hour counsel anticipated spending on the reply, and 1 hour counsel anticipates spending at the hearing, a total of 6.2 hours at counsel’s billing rate of $452 per hour (equals $2,802.40) “multiplied by three for further sanctions for failure to produce responses and contempt of court equat[ing] to a total of $8,407.20 ….” Greer Decl., ¶ 16.As stated above, the court cannot impose sanctions for misuse of the discovery process as a punishment. In addition, no reply was filed.Accordingly, the court will only impose sanctions of $2,350.40 (i.e., 5.2 hours of counsel’s time at a billing rate of $452 per hour) against Defendant.Payment of sanctions is to be made within 30 days of the receipt of notice of this ruling.
