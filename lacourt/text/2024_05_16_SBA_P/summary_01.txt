And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The court rules that the motion to compel initial responses to the plaintiff's special interrogatories is granted in its entirety. The defendant is ordered to serve its initial responses, without objections, to the plaintiff's special interrogatories (set two) within 30 days of this ruling. The defendant is also ordered to pay the plaintiff sanctions of $1,084.80.

The court rules that the motion for issue and monetary sanctions is granted in part and denied in part. The request to impose issue sanctions on the defendant is denied without prejudice. The request to impose monetary sanctions against the defendant is granted. The defendant is ordered to pay the plaintiff additional sanctions of $2,350.40. The defendant is further ordered to comply with the court's order dated February 28, 2024, within 30 days of this ruling.

The court finds that the defendant has misused the discovery process by failing to respond or submit to an authorized method of discovery and disobeying a court order to provide discovery. The court finds that the defendant was aware of the substandard conditions affecting the habitability of the property.
