And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the defendant's motion to compel the plaintiff's responses to production of documents, Set One. The plaintiff is ordered to provide verified responses, without objections, within 10 days. Additionally, the plaintiff and their counsel are ordered to pay $270.00 in sanctions to defense counsel within 10 days. The judge finds that the plaintiff failed to respond to the defendant's discovery requests, despite being served with the requests on April 18, 2024, and the deadline for response was May 19, 2024. The judge cites relevant California Code of Civil Procedure sections and case law to support the ruling.
