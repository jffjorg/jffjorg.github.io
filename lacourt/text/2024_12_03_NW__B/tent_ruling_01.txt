BACKGROUND
 
This action arises from a motor vehicle
accident. On September 4, 2019, Plaintiff Fanny Wei (“Plaintiff”) filed a
complaint against Defendants White Hawk, Inc. (“Defendant”), and Does 1 to 20 (collectively
“Defendants”), alleging one cause of action for motor vehicle negligence.

On June 7, 2024, the case was reassigned
to the Honorable Karen Moskowitz in Department B at Van Nuys Courthouse East,
effective June 24, 2024.
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
Cal. Code of Civ. Proc. § 585 permits
entry of a default judgment after a party has failed to timely respond or
appear. (Cal. Code of Civ. Proc. § 585.) A party seeking judgment on the
default by the court must file a Request for Court Judgment, and: (1) a brief
summary of the case; (2) declarations or other admissible evidence in support
of the judgment requested; (3) interest computations as necessary; (4) a
memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) declaration of nonmilitary status;
(6) a proposed form of judgment; (7) a dismissal of all parties against whom
judgment is not sought or an application for separate judgment under CCP § 579,
supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment; (8) exhibits as necessary;
and (9) a request for attorney’s fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement
of the parties. (Cal. Rules of Court Rule 3.1800.) 
 
ANALYSIS
 
Plaintiff
seeks damages in the total amount of $120,860.21, representing $20,300.00 in
special damages, $100,000.00 in general damages, and $560.21 in costs.
 
Defendant has
failed to timely respond or appear. Plaintiff’s default packet meets all
statutory requirements under CCP § 585. Therefore, Plaintiff’s request for
default judgment against Defendant White Hawk, Inc. is GRANTED.
 
Moving party is ordered to give notice if
any parties not in default.
