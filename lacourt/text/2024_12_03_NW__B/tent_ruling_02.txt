TENTATIVE RULING
 



ZAYDELL FALK,
 
Plaintiff,  
  
         vs.
 
ENRIQUE CABALLERO,
 
Defendant. 


 Case No.:  21STCV07489
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  December 3, 2024



 
Defendant Enrique Caballero (“Defendant”)’s Motion to Compel Plaintiff
Zaydell Falk (“Plaintiff”)’s responses to Production of Documents, Set One, is granted.
Plaintiff is ordered to provide verified responses, without objections, within
10 days. Additionally, Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s counsel, jointly and
severally, is ordered to pay $270.00 in sanctions to defense counsel within 10
days.
 
LEGAL STANDARDS
 
If a party to whom requests for production of documents are directed
fails to serve a timely response, the propounding party may move for an order
compelling responses and for a monetary sanction. (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.300(b).)
The statute contains no time limit for a motion to compel where no responses
have been served. All that need be shown in the moving papers is that a request
for production of documents was properly served on the opposing party, that the
time to respond has expired, and that no response of any kind has been served.
(See Leach v. Superior Court (1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 902, 905-906.)
 
Failure to timely respond waives all objections, including privilege and
work product. (CCP § 2031.300(a).) Thus, unless the party to whom the demand
was directed obtains relief from waiver, he or she cannot raise objections to
the proposed demands. Likewise, for failure to respond, the moving party need
not attempt to resolve the matter outside court before filing the motion.
 
“The court shall impose a monetary sanction . . . against any
party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to
compel . . . responses to interrogatories or production demands, absent
substantial justification or other circumstances that make imposing the
sanctions unjust.” (CCP § 2030.290(c).) Similarly, “[t]he court may impose
a monetary sanction ordering that one engaging in the misuse of the discovery
process, or any attorney advising that conduct, or both pay the reasonable
expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that
conduct.” (CCP § 2023.030(a).) Misuse of the discovery process includes
“[f]ailing to respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery,” and
“[d]isobeying a court order to provide discovery.” (CCP § 2023.010(d) and
(g).)
 
DISCUSSION
 
Defendant moves to compel Plaintiff’s responses to Request for
Production of Documents, Set One. Defendant also seeks sanctions in the amount
of $270.00. (Motion p. 2:1-4.)
 
Defendant moves to compel Plaintiff’s response to discovery because Plaintiff
 failed to provide any responses.
Defendant propounded discovery requests on Plaintiff on April 18, 2024. (Motion
Exh A. [Request for Production of Documents, Set One].) According to a June 24,
2024, correspondence from defense counsel to Plaintiff’s counsel, responses
were due on May 19, 2024. (Motion Exh. B [June 24, 2024, correspondence.) Plaintiff
did not respond. (Ibid.) 
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff is ordered to provide verified responses, without
objections, to Defendant’s Request for Production of Documents, Set One, within
10 days of this ruling.
 
Defendant requests $270.00 in sanctions, reflecting a $60.00 filing fee
and one hour of preparation at an hourly rate of $210.00. (Lopez Decl. ¶ 7.)
Therefore, Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s counsel, jointly and severally, is ordered
to pay defense counsel $270.00 in sanctions within 10 days of this hearing.
