**Case Number:** 23STCP01283

**[Tentative] Order**

**Denying Petition for Writ of Mandate**

**Introduction**

This tentative ruling denies the petition for writ of mandate filed by Key Disposal & Recycling, Inc. ("Petitioner") against the City of Commerce ("Respondent").

**Background**

In February 2018, the City adopted Resolution 18-21 and Ordinance 695, which authorized the discontinuation of issuing recycling hauler licenses and established a single license for haulers of refuse and recycling services. In October 2018, the City adopted Resolution 18-133, which increased the hauler license fee from 11% to 15%.

**Discussion**

1. **Lack of Standing**: Petitioner lacks standing to challenge Resolution 18-133, as it was never obligated to pay the increased fee and has not shown any economic harm.
2. **Untimeliness**: Petitioner's challenge to Resolution 18-133 is untimely, as the statute of limitations for mandamus proceedings expired in 2018.
3. **Exemption from Article XIII C**: The hauler license fee is exempt from Article XIII C, as it is a charge imposed for a specific benefit conferred or privilege granted directly to the payor.
4. **Specific Use of Government Property**: The Semi-Exclusive Agreements for Commercial Refuse and Recycling Services granted to successful bidders entitle the haulers to specific use of government property that they would not have enjoyed had they not paid the fee.
5. **Petitioner's Failure to Refute Evidence**: Petitioner has failed to refute the evidence presented by Respondent, including the declaration of Gina Nila, the City's Deputy Director of Public Works Operations.

**Conclusion**

Based on the foregoing, the court finds that:

1. Petitioner lacks standing to challenge Resolution 18-133.
2. The petition for writ of mandate is untimely.
3. The hauler license fee is exempt from Article XIII C.
4. Respondent has demonstrated that the hauler license fee is a charge imposed for a specific benefit conferred or privilege granted directly to the payor.
5. Petitioner has failed to refute the evidence presented by Respondent.

**Order**

The petition for writ of mandate is denied.

**Next Steps**

The case is transferred to Department One for assignment to an independent calendar court for resolution of the remaining causes of action.
