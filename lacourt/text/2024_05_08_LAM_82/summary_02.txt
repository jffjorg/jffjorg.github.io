**Summary of Judge's Tentative Ruling:**

The judge has tentatively ruled that the petition for writ of mandate filed by Catalyst-Artesia, LLC (Petitioner) against the City of Artesia (Defendant) is not moot. The Petitioner seeks to compel the City to issue a Zoning Verification Letter (ZVL) for a cannabis business location. The City denied the Petitioner's ZVL request due to the location being north of the 91 freeway. The Petitioner appealed to the Hearing Officer, who denied the appeal. The Petitioner seeks a writ of mandate to compel the City to issue the ZVL. The judge has overruled the City's demurrer, finding that the Petitioner has pleaded a cause of action for administrative mandate. The judge has also rejected the City's argument that the petition is moot.
