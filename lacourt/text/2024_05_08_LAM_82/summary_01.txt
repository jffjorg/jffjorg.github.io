```

And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English:

The court has denied Petitioner's motion to tax costs, which sought to reduce the costs claimed by Real Parties. The Real Parties incurred costs in connection with the cross-complaints, which were severed and transferred to Department 32, and in challenging paragraph 7 of the judgment, which incorrectly included enforcement costs against them. The court finds that the Real Parties' costs were necessarily incurred in this case and are recoverable against Petitioner.
