And here is a summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to dismiss the plaintiff's employment discrimination and whistleblower retaliation claims. The plaintiff alleges that she was terminated from her job in retaliation for whistleblowing activities, and that she was subjected to a hostile work environment and failed to accommodate her disability.

The defendant Claremont Graduate University demurred to multiple causes of action, arguing that the claims are barred by workers' compensation exclusivity. However, the judge ruled that the whistleblower protection statute, Labor Code ยง 1102.5, provides an exception to the workers' compensation bargain.

The judge also ruled that the plaintiff has stated valid claims for disability discrimination, retaliation, and hostile work environment. The judge sustained the demurrer to the fourth cause of action, alleging harassment in violation of FEHA, but overruled the demurrer to the first through tenth causes of action.

The judge gave the plaintiff 30 days' leave to amend the complaint.
