And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of JOHN SCOTT VALLES vs TYLER MALIKE GILLETT et al., Case Number 21STCV19958. The Plaintiff has filed a motion to set aside the dismissal of the case, which was dismissed on May 31, 2023. The Plaintiff argues that the dismissal was due to a mistake by the counsel's assistant, who mistakenly marked the file as settled/closed, resulting in the failure to serve the defendant. The Plaintiff also alleges that most of the staff at Plaintiff's counsel had quit or relocated due to the pandemic.

However, the Judge has denied the motion, finding that it is not timely filed under Code of Civil Procedure section 473. The Judge states that the six-month limit for filing the motion is jurisdictional and no exceptions apply. The Judge also notes that the court does not have authority to excuse the Plaintiff's noncompliance with the six-month time limit.

The Judge's decision is based on the legal standard set forth in Code of Civil Procedure section 473(b), which provides that the court may relieve a party from a judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken against him through his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. The Judge also cites several case citations, including Arambula v. Union Carbide Corp. (2005) and Davis v. Thayer (1980), to support their decision.
