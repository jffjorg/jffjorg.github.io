The counsel has submitted all required judicial council forms, and the plaintiff has sufficient time to obtain new representation and prepare for the trial in November. The judge also orders the judicial assistant to schedule an OSC (Order to Show Cause) in two weeks to discuss sanctions in the amount of $120 for the failure to file proof of service. The moving party is ordered to give notice.
