And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to compel the deposition of Defendant ABC Installations, ordering Defendant to appear for deposition within 20 days. The motion to compel request for productions is denied as premature. The plaintiff's request for sanctions is also denied due to Defendant's substantial justification for opposing the motion. The Judge notes that Defendant's untimely objection to the deposition notice was waived, but Defendant's objections to the document request are not waived and can be raised at the deposition. The Judge continues the motion to compel document production to allow the parties to participate in an informal discovery conference (IDC) and to resolve the outstanding issues.
