 Case Number:  22STCV00108    Hearing Date:   February 23, 2024    Dept:  30 SERGIO OCHOA, et al. vs ABC INSTALLATIONS CORP., et al.TENTATIVEPlaintiffs’ motion to compel the deposition of Defendant ABC Installations is GRANTED. Defendant ABC is ordered to appear for deposition within 20 days of this order. The motion to compel request for productions is denied as premature. Plaintiffs’ request for sanctions is DENIED.Plaintiffs’ motion to compel the deposition of Defendant is DENIED as moot. The motion to compel requests for production of documents i continued. The parties are ordered to schedule an IDC with the Court.¿¿Moving party to give notice.DiscussionOn November 14, 2023, Plaintiff served Defendants with a Notice of Deposition with a Request for Documents, set for November 27, 2023. (Allton Decl., ¶ 2; Exh. A.) Defendants’ counsel served an objection on November 22, 2023, by electronic service. (Id., Exh. B.) Under CCP section 2025.410(a), CCP section 12, and CCP section 1010.6(3)(b), Defendant had until November 20, 2023, to electronically serve their objections; considering that November 23 and November 24 were holidays. (Id., ¶ 3.) Thus, Plaintiff argues Defendant waived objections by failing to timely serve the objections.On November 27, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel attempted to meet and confer with Defendant’s counsel and notified Defendant’s counsel that the objection was untimely and demanded the production of all documents, without objection. (Id., ¶ 5.) Defense counsel simply ignored the Plaintiff’s attempts. (Id., ¶ 6.)Defendant argues in opposition that Plaintiff untimely and unilaterally served Defendant with a notice of deposition accompanied with sixty-eight (68) Requests for Production, for November 27, 2023. Defendant argues Plaintiff’s deposition notice was not timely per Code of Civil Procedure sections 1013, 2016.050, and 2025.270(a) as it was served via email on November 14, 2023.Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.270 provides in relevant part:¿(a)¿An oral deposition shall be scheduled for a date at least 10 days after service of the deposition notice.(Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.270(a).) Further, Section 2025.410 provides:Any party served with a deposition notice that does not comply with Article 2 (commencing with Section 2025.210) waives any error or irregularity unless that party promptly serves a written objection specifying that error or irregularity at least three calendar days prior to the date for which the deposition is scheduled, on the party seeking to take the deposition and any other attorney or party on whom the deposition notice was served.(Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.410(a).)The Court notes that Defendant served the objection by email on November 22, 2023. As this objection was untimely under CCP section 2025.410(a), CCP section 12, and CCP section 1013(e), Defendant waived the untimeliness of the deposition notice.The parties also dispute whether the untimely objection to the deposition notice waives the objections to the request for production of documents. Defendant argues that a deponent may wait until the deposition to raise objections. (Monarch Healthcare v. Superior Court (2000) 78 Cal.App.4th 1282, 1290.)The Court agrees with Defendants that they have not waived their objections to the request for production of documents. (Monarch Healthcare v. Superior Court (2000) 78 Cal.App.4th 1282, 1290 ["...a party or witness may wait until the deposition and raise objections at that time to the form or content of the subpoena, or to demands for production of privileged documents, etc."] quoting Weil & Brown, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter Group 1999) ¶ 8:191, pp. 8C-40 to 8C-41; see also id., ¶ 8:606, p. 8E-6.) As a preliminary matter, a request for production of documents in a deposition notice merely requires that the documents identified are to be produced by the deponent at the deposition. (CCP § 2025.220(a)(4).) Thus, a request for documents in conjunction with a deposition notice is not the equivalent of a request for production of documents underCode of Civil Procedure section 2031.010 et seq. The non-moving party need not object in advance of the deposition as with an objection to the notice. Again, objections are timely raised during the deposition and are not waived by the failure to object before the deposition commences. (See CCP § 2025.460.) As a result, the request to compel documents under the deposition subpoena is premature as to ABC Installations, as no deposition has yet occurred. Rather, if documents are not produced at the deposition, Plaintiff may then move to compel Defendant to produce the documents. (See CCP § 2025.480; see also CCP §2025.460(e).)As such, because Defendant ABC served an untimely objection to Plaintiff’s deposition notice, it has waived the issue of short notice. But Defendant ABC has not waived its objections to the document request as Defendant may object at the deposition itself, and the deposition has not taken place yet. In turn, as the deposition has not taken place yet, Plaintiff’s request to compel the documents is premature. Thus, the motion as to ABC is granted in part. Defendant ABC is to present itself for deposition within 20 days of this hearing.However, as to Plaintiffs’ motion to compel the deposition of Irepan, and the request for production of documents, on January 2, 2024, Plaintiffs’ motion as to Defendant Irepan was continued. In the interim, Defendant’ Irepan’s deposition took place on January 23, 2024. (Allton Decl., ¶ 2.) Defendant did not bring all responsive documents with him at the deposition. (Id., ¶ 3) Defense counsel asserted objections on the basis of attorney-client privilege and work product. (Id., ¶ 5.)Thus, Defendant has not waived his objections to the document request as Defendant may object at the deposition itself, and did so when he appeared for deposition on January 23, 2024. Defendants argue that Plaintiffs’ motion and separate statement do not contain any specific facts showing good cause justifying the production described in the deposition notice. (CCP § 2025.450(b)(2).) However, the requests for productions are all tied to the incident at issue, and thus satisfy the good cause showing.However, the motion to compel document production is continued to allow the parties to participate in an informal discovery conference as required by Standing Order Re Personal Injury Procedures, Spring Street Courthouse, Pg. 7.¿ In substance, this is a motion to compel further responses to document requests as Defendant objected to Plaintiffs’ request for production of documents and has failed to produce the documents.¿ But motions that require a further response to discovery require that the parties first participate in an informal discovery conference with the court. (Standing Order Re Personal Injury Procedures.) The Court’s file does not reflect that the parties participated in an IDC with respect to the objections to questions made at Defendant’s deposition.¿¿Moreover, Plaintiffs state that Defendant produced some documents but failed to provide all responsive documents. But Plaintiffs have not informed the Court which documents are at issue. Thus, after the parties participate in an IDC, the parties are ordered to file supplemental briefing informing the Court what documents are still at issue, and if any requests are moot.SanctionsThe issue of sanctions as to Irepan will be addressed at the continued hearing.As to ABC Installations, Defendant argues that sanctions should not be imposed because Plaintiff’s motion was filed and served at a time in which discovery and motion cutoff dates had passed based on the previous trial date of December 27, 2023. Further, Plaintiff untimely and unilaterally noticed Defendant’s deposition for November 27, 2023 on November 14, 2023.The Court finds that Defendant has provided substantial justification here. Discovery was closed based on the previous trial date, Plaintiffs’ deposition notice was sent on short notice, and Defendant’s objections were rendered untimely due to Court holidays (one day which not everyone else has off—adding to the confusion) and weekends. Thus, these many reasons why the deposition did not proceed weigh in favor of Defendant's substantial justification to oppose the motion. Plaintiff’s request for sanctions is denied.
