And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the Plaintiff's motion to set aside the dismissal of the case. The Plaintiff seeks to set aside the dismissal based on a mistake by their former counsel, who abruptly left the firm and failed to calendar or advise the firm of the May 8, 2023 Order to Show Cause Re: Dismissal (Settlement). The Plaintiff argues that they were misled by the Defendant's actions and that the dismissal was not timely.

The judge has determined that the Plaintiff's motion is not timely filed under California Code of Civil Procedure section 473(b), as it was filed more than six months after the dismissal. The judge also finds that the Plaintiff has not shown a meritorious case and that their excuse for not presenting a defense to the original action is not satisfactory. The judge further finds that the Plaintiff's counsel did not demonstrate diligence in discovering the mistake and seeking to set it aside.

The judge notes that while the Plaintiff may be entitled to equitable relief, they have not shown that they have a meritorious case and that their excuse for not presenting a defense to the original action is not satisfactory. The judge also notes that the Plaintiff has not demonstrated diligence in discovering the mistake and seeking to set it aside.

Therefore, the judge has denied the Plaintiff's motion to set aside the dismissal.
