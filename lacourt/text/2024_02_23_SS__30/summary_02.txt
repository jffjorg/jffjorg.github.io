And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling grants Defendant MV Transportation, Inc.'s motion to compel responses to request for production, set four, and set five, and supplemental request for production. The court orders Plaintiff Kristy Allen to serve verified responses, without objections, to the discovery at issue within 20 days. The defendant's request for sanctions is denied. The court finds that Defendant is entitled to a court order directing Plaintiff to provide verified responses without objections, as Defendant properly served the discovery requests and Plaintiff failed to serve responses. The court also denies Defendant's request for sanctions under CCP section 2023.010 for the misuse of discovery, as it does not independently authorize the trial court to impose monetary sanctions for misuse of discovery. Finally, the court orders Defendant to pay $120 in filing fees to the Court within 20 days for the two additional motions it should have filed.
