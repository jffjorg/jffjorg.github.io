And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling addresses Cross-Defendants' motion to strike the prayer for attorney's fees in the Cross-Complaint. The Court notes that the motion is untimely, but will consider it on its merits. The motion seeks to strike paragraphs 9, 20, and 21 of the Cross-Complaint, as well as the prayer for attorney's fees. The Court grants the motion to strike the prayer for attorney's fees as to request no. 1, but denies it as to requests nos. 2-4. The Court finds that paragraphs 9 and 20 are relevant and not just related to attorney's fees, and therefore denies the motion to strike. The Court also finds that the notice of motion did not identify the specific portions of the cross-complaint that Cross-Defendants seek to strike as to requests nos. 2 and 3, and therefore denies the motion as to those requests.
