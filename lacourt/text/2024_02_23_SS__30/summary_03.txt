And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied the defendant's motion to exclude the testimony of expert witness Dr. Rappard without prejudice to filing this motion in the trial court. The defendant argued that Dr. Rappard refused to participate in a deposition in good faith, refusing to answer over ten essential and critical questions and only agreeing to one-hour long depositions, while appearing at his depositions at least ten minutes late every time. The court finds that any ruling excluding the plaintiff's expert witnesses are evidentiary in nature and must be addressed by the trial court. The court also notes that the defendant's conduct gives the appearance of gamesmanship, which may be considered "unreasonable" under California law.
