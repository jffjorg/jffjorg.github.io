And here is a summary in English text of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge is considering a tentative ruling on the case, which involves a survivor cause of action and a stay issue. The judge notes that a survivor cause of action is separate from a wrongful death cause of action and vests in the decedent before death, but by statute survives the event of death. The judge also notes that the stay issue is committed to their discretion.

The defendants have argued that the claims are uncertain or without merit, but the judge believes this is better suited for a dispositive motion on the merits. The judge is not ruling on the merits of the claims at this time, but is instead considering the stay issue and the plaintiffs' request for a stay.

The judge references several legal cases, including Quiroz v. Seventh Ave. Center, Adolph v. Uber Technologies, Inc., and Cruz v. PacifiCare Health Systems, Inc., to support their decision. The judge will likely issue a final ruling after considering the parties' responses to the tentative ruling.

## English Summary:

This tentative ruling addresses several issues in a case.  

The judge clarifies that a "survivor cause of action" is distinct from a wrongful death claim and existed in the deceased person's lifetime.

Finally, the judge emphasizes that the issue of a stay in the proceedings is within the trial court's discretion.
