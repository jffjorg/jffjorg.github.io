roles: The plaintiffs are the family members of Isaac Smith. The defendants are the owners and operators of Longwood Manor.
significant\_statements: The court grants the motion to compel arbitration in part and denies it in part, and grants the motion to stay the non-arbitrable claims.

In summary, this tentative ruling grants the defendants' motion to compel arbitration for some of the plaintiff's claims and stays the non-arbitrable claims. The plaintiffs are the family members of Isaac Smith, and the defendants are the owners and operators of Longwood Manor. The ruling is based on the Arbitration Agreement signed by Isaac Smith prior to his residency at Longwood Manor. The court finds that some of the plaintiff's claims, specifically those related to Decedent's admission to Longwood Manor and the allegedly improper neglectful care he received during his residency, fall within the scope of the Arbitration Agreement. However, the court denies the motion to compel arbitration for the plaintiff's individual claims, including the wrongful death claim, as they do not arise from the contract and Plaintiffs are not signatories to the arbitration agreement. The court also declines to bifurcate these causes of action, sending the "survival" aspects of these causes of action to arbitration and keeping the aspects directed at Plaintiffs themselves in court. The ruling is based on the legal standards set forth in Code of Civil Procedure section 1281.2 and Code of Civil Procedure section 1281.4.
