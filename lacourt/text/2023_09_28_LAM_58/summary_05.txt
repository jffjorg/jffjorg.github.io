And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court grants the defendants' motion to compel arbitration in part and denies it in part. The defendants' motion to compel arbitration is granted with respect to the claims brought on behalf of the decedent (Isaac Smith) for physical abuse, neglect, and survival. These claims are subject to the arbitration agreement signed by the decedent prior to becoming a resident at Longwood Manor.

The motion to compel arbitration is denied with respect to the individual claims of the plaintiffs (David Smith, Isaac Smith, Jr., and Joseph Smith) for wrongful death, unfair business practices, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and negligent infliction of emotional distress. These claims do not arise from the contract and are not subject to the arbitration agreement.

The Court also grants the defendants' unopposed motion to stay the non-arbitrable claims.
