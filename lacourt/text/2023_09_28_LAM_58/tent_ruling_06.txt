a cause of action for wrongful death, a survivor cause of action is not a new
cause of action that vests in the heirs on the death of the decedent. It is instead
a separate and distinct cause of action which belonged to the decedent before
death but, by statute, survives that event.” (Quiroz v. Seventh Ave. Center
(2006) 140 Cal.App.4th 1256, 1264.) 


[2]           To the

p. 4:25-5:8), such arguments are better suited for a dispositive motion on the
merits. 


[3]           The stay issue is a
matter committed to the discretion of the trial court.
