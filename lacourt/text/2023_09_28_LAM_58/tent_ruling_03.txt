          The rough draft of a deposition
transcript “may not be used, cited, or transcribed as the certified transcript
of the deposition
proceedings.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.540.) In opposition,
Monster Energy states: “The attached transcript of Mr. Norman’s deposition is a
“rough” transcript, as the deposition was just taken and the final transcript
is not yet available. Defendant will present the relevant testimony from the
final transcript to the Court when it is available.” (Supp. Opp., p. 3, fn. 2.)
In the Opposition filed on September 18, 2023, Monster Energy attached a certified
copy of the deposition transcript.
