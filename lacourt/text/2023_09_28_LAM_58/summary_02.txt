Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has denied Promote Mexico's motion for summary adjudication, which sought to establish that Monster Energy owes it a duty to defend against Plaintiff's claims. The Court found that the TV Sponsorship Agreement, which contains an indemnity provision, does not apply to claims arising from the race. Monster Energy's duty to defend Promote Mexico is limited to specific circumstances, including breaches of the agreement and grossly negligent acts or omissions. The Court also rejected Promote Mexico's argument that Monster Energy's opposition is barred by judicial estoppel, as the two parties' positions are not totally inconsistent.
