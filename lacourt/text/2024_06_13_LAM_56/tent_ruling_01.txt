BACKGROUND
             This is a petition regarding an uninsured
motorist arbitration. On September 13, 2023, Petitioner North Light Specialty
Insurance Company (“Petitioner”) filed a petition against Respondents Jose
Lozano, Sarkis Lebedjian (“Lebedjian”), and David Gasparyan (“Gasparyan”)
(collectively, “Respondents”), for the purpose of establishing jurisdiction to
hear and rule upon disputes at issue in an uninsured motorist arbitration.
            
On
March 1, 2024, Petitioner moved to compel Respondent Lebedjian’s responses to
Form Interrogatories, Set One. On the same date, Petitioner moved to compel
Respondent Gasparyan’s responses to Special Interrogatories, Set One, and Form
Interrogatories, Set One. On March 7, 2024, Petitioner moved to compel
Respondent Gasparyan’s responses to Demand for Inspection, Set One. The motions
are unopposed.
 
DISCUSSION
            Legal Standard
When a party fails to
serve a timely response to interrogatories, the party propounding the interrogatories
may move for an order compelling a response. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290,
subd. (b).) A party who fails to provide a timely response waives any
objection, including one based on privilege or work product. (Id., §
2030.290, subd. (a).) “The court shall impose a monetary sanction… against any
party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to
compel a response to interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to
the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances
make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Id., § 2030.290, subd.
(c).)
 
When a party fails to serve a timely response to an inspection demand,
the party making the demand may move for an order compelling a response to the
inspection demand. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (b).) A party who fails
to provide a timely response waives any objection, including one based on
privilege or work product. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a).) “[T]he
court shall impose a monetary sanction… against any party, person, or attorney
who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to a demand
for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling, unless it finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Id., §
2031.300, subd. (c).)
 
Analysis - Lebedjian
Petitioner seeks to compel responses from Respondent Lebedjian in
connection with Form Interrogatories, Set One, served on May 11, 2023. (Denny
Decl., ¶ 4.) The Court finds a number of problems with this motion. First, a
plaintiff may not propound discovery until 10 days after service of the
summons. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.020, subd. (b) [interrogatories]; Id., § 2031.020, subd. (b) [inspection demands].) Petitioner did not file
the petition for this action until September 13, 2023, more than four months
after the discovery requests were served. In addition, the proof of service on
Lebedjian indicates that Lebedjian was served on February 17, 2024, less than
two weeks before Petitioner filed this motion. (Proof of Service (2/20/24).)
 
Moreover, the proof of service on Lebedjian
is defective. Proof of service of the summons and complaint must be made on the
mandatory Judicial Council Form POS-010 or a typewritten form that
substantially follows Form POS-010. (Code Civ. Proc., § 410.17, subd. (f); Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 2.150, subd. (a) [typewritten version of Form POS-010
permissible provided it follows the same format].) The proof of service on file
for Respondent Lebedjian is not submitted on Judicial Council Form POS-010 or a
typewritten form that follows Form POS-010. (Proof of Service (2/20/24).) The prior
proof of service submitted on October 11, 2023 indicates service on Lebedjian’s
purported attorney, George Jawlakian, but there is no document in the Court’s
file indicating that Lebedjian’s purported attorney was authorized to accept
service of the summons and petition on behalf of Lebedjian. (Proof of Service
(10/11/24); Code Civ. Proc., § 410.17, subd. (d).)
 
The Court further notes that the proof of
service attached to the Form Interrogatories does not indicate the manner that
they were purportedly served on Lebedjian. (Denny Decl., Ex. A, p. 18 of pdf.)
 
            Based on the
foregoing, the Court DENIES Petitioner’s motion to compel responses to Form
Interrogatories, Set One, from Respondent Lebedjian.
 
            Analysis –
Gasparyan
            Petitioner’s motions
to compel seek responses from Respondent Gasparyan in connection with Form
Interrogatories, Set One, Special Interrogatories, Set One, and Demand for
Inspection, Set One, served on May 11, 2023. (Denny Decls., ¶ 4.) The Court
finds these discovery motions suffer from the same problems noted above with
respect to Lebedjian, namely that they were served months before the petition
was filed, (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.020, subd. (b)
[interrogatories]; Id., § 2031.020, subd. (b) [inspection
demands]), and the proofs of service against Respondent Gasparyan are
defective, (Code Civ. Proc., § 410.17, subds. (d), (f); Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 2.150, subd. (a).) Also, the proof of service attached to the Form
Interrogatories does not indicate the manner that they were purportedly served
on Gasparyan. (Denny Decl., Ex. A, p. 18 of pdf.)
Based on the foregoing, the Court DENIES Petitioner’s motions to
compel responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One, Special Interrogatories, Set
One, and Demand for Inspection, Set One.
 
The Court further DENIES Petitioner’s requests for monetary sanctions
since it did not prevail on its motions here. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290,
subd. (c); Id., § 2031.300, subd. (c).)
