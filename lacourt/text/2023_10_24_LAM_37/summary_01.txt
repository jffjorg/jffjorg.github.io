And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling addresses the motions to dismiss and request for sanctions filed by the Yuzon Defendants (Yuzon & Associates, Inc. and Benigno Sari Yuzon) against Plaintiff Bethany Kristovich. The Yuzon Defendants argue that the Complaint is frivolous and without factual and legal merit. The court finds that the Complaint may be factually deficient, but this is not a proper basis to seek dismissal. The court also notes that Plaintiff's counsel submitted a declaration attesting to his investigation into the claims and the filing of certificates of merit. Therefore, the court denies the Yuzon Defendants' motions to dismiss and request for sanctions. The ruling will be final after October 24, 2023.
