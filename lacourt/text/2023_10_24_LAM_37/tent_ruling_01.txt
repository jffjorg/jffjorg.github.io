Background
 
On
June 8, 2023, Bethany Kristovich (“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint against
Jonathan Benshalom, 727 Las Palmas, LLC, JR Pool & Spa Service Inc., JR
Pool and Spa Services, Yoram David Najum aka Jerome Najum, Amit Apel Design,
Inc., Amit Apel, Yuzon & Associates, Inc., Benigno Sari Yuzon, and Does 1
to 100. The Complaint alleges three causes of action: (1) violation of the
standards set forth in Civ. Code §§ 896 and 897; (2) negligence; and (3)
professional negligence. 
 
On
August 4, 2023, Defendants Jonathan Benshalom and 727 Las Palmas, LLC, filed a
Cross-Complaint against Roes 1 to 50 for: (1) express indemnity, (2) equitable
indemnity, (3) contribution and apportionment, (4) declaratory relief – duty to
defend, (5) declaratory relief-duty to indemnify, and (5) breach of contract –
failure to obtain insurance. 
 
On
September 8, 2023, Defendant Amit Apel Design, Inc. and Amit Apel (collectively
“Amit Defendants”) filed a cross-complaint against Roes 1 to 50 for: (1)
implied indemnity, (2) equitable indemnity, (3) equitable apportionment of
fault, and (4) contribution. 
 
On August 24, 2023, Defendants Yuzon
& Associates, Inc. and Benigno Sari Yuzon (collectively “Yuzon Defendants”)
filed a demurrer to Plaintiff’s Complaint, noticed for hearing on November 27,
2023.  
 
On September 1, 2023, the court temporarily
granted the Yuzon Defendants’ ex parte application for a stay of proceedings
pending resolution of Defendants demurrer and motion to dismiss. On September
25, 2023, the court lifted the stay. 
 
On September 27,
2023, the Yuzon Defendants each filed a motion to dismiss and request for monetary
sanctions pursuant to CCP § 128.7. Plaintiff filed a consolidated opposition on
October 10, 2023. The Yuzon Defendants filed a reply on October 13, 2023. The
matter is now before the court. 
 
Discussion
 
I.         Legal Standard
 
CCP section 128.7(b) provides that by
presenting a pleading to the court, an attorney “is certifying that to the best
of the person’s knowledge, information, and belief, formed after an inquiry
reasonable under the circumstances, all of the following conditions are met:  
 
(1) It
is not being presented primarily for an improper purpose, such as to harass or
to cause unnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of litigation.
 
(2) The
claims, defenses, and other legal contentions therein are warranted by existing
law or by a nonfrivolous argument for the extension, modification, or reversal
of existing law or the establishment of new law.
 
(3) The
allegations and other factual contentions have evidentiary support or, if
specifically so identified, are likely to have evidentiary support after a
reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery.
 
(4) The
denials of factual contentions are warranted on the evidence or, if
specifically so identified, are reasonably based on a lack of information or
belief.”
 
Section 128.7(c) provides that the
court may impose monetary sanctions on an attorney who violates subdivision(b)
or who is responsible for the violation. 

 
“Under
section 128.7, a court may impose sanctions if it concludes a pleading was
filed for an improper purpose or was indisputably without merit, either legally
or factually. [Citation.]” (Bucur v. Ahmad (2016) 244 Cal.App.4th 175,
189.) “[T]o obtain sanctions, the moving party must show the party's conduct in
asserting the claim was objectively unreasonable. [Citation.] A claim is
objectively unreasonable if ‘any reasonable attorney would agree that [it] is
totally and completely without merit.’ [Citations.]” (Id.) No showing of
bad faith is required. (In re Marriage of Reese & Guy (1999) 73
Cal.App.4th 1214, 1221.) 

 
II.        Motion to Dismiss
 
The
Yuzon Defendants move for an order imposing monetary sanctions and the
dismissal of the entire action with prejudice. 
 
 
The
Yuzon Defendants assert that the basis for their motions is that Plaintiff’s
complaint is frivolous and without factual and legal merit. The declaration of
defense counsel asserts that having read Plaintiff’s Complaint, it fails to
specifically allege any conduct the Yuzon Defendants engaged in that resulted
in negligence and/or property damage. (Bentacourt Decl. ¶ 3.) 
 
The
court finds that the fact that Plaintiff’s complaint may be factually deficient
is not a proper basis to seek dismissal pursuant to CCP § 128.7. If the Yuzon
Defendants find that Plaintiff’s Complaint is deficient on its face, these
objections should be raised with Plaintiff’s counsel via meet and confer, and
if the parties are unable to reach a resolution, then Defendants may present
their objections by filing a demurrer. Whether Plaintiff’s Complaint states
sufficient facts against the Yuzon Defendants is a determination that will be
made at the hearing on the demurrer. 
 
At
the pleading stage, Plaintiff is not required to prove the allegations in the
Complaint.  Plaintiff’s Complaint will be
upheld if contains ultimate facts rather than evidentiary facts. (Logan v.
Southern California Rapid Transit District (1982) 136 Cal.App.3d 116, 126.)
 Moreover, Plaintiff’s counsel submitted
a declaration attesting to his investigation into Plaintiff’s claims, such as consulting
with a California-licensed structural engineer and the filing of Certificates
of Merit filed against the Yuzon Defendants by both Plaintiff and the Apel
Defendants as required by CCP § 411.35. (Lord Decl. ¶¶ 7, 8, 10; Ex. 2, 3, 5.) 
 
Accordingly,
the court finds the Yukon Defendants have failed to show that the allegations
in Plaintiff’s Complaint will have no evidentiary support and that the
Complaint was frivolously filed. 
 
Conclusion
 
The Yukon Defendants’
motions to dismiss and request for sanctions are denied.
