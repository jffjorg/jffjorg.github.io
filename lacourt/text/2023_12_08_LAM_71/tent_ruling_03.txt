 Case No.: 
  22STCV14224
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  December 8, 2023



 
The
Court, sua sponte, reconsiders its December 20, 2022, Ruling granting
Defendants Mercedes-Benz USA LLC’s and Silver Star A.G. Ltd.’s motion to compel
arbitration.  Defendants’ motion to
compel arbitration is denied.
 
The Court, sua sponte, reconsiders its December 20,
2022 order (“12/20/22 Ruling”) granting Defendants Mercedes-Benz USA LLC’s (“MBZ”)
and Silver Star A.G. Ltd.’s (“Silver Star”) (collectively, “Defendants”) motion
to compel arbitration.  (Notice of
Motion, pg. 2.)  
 
Procedural Background
On April 28, 2022, Plaintiff filed his operative complaint
against Defendants alleging five causes of action under the Song-Beverly
Consumer Warranty Act, Civil Code §§1790 et seq. (“Song-Beverly”) and in common
law tort: (1) violation of Civil Code §1793.2(d) [against MBZ]; (2) violation
of Civil Code §1793.2(b) [against MBZ]; (3) violation of Civil Code §1793.2(A)(3)
[against MBZ]; (4) breach of the implied warranty of merchantability (Civ. Code
§§1791.1, 1794, 1795.5) [against MBZ]; and (5) negligent repair [against Silver
Star] arising
from Plaintiff’s March 15, 2020 entry into a warranty
contract with MBZ regarding a 2019 Mercedes GLE 63 (“Subject Vehicle”).
On December 20, 2022, this Court granted Defendants’ motion
to compel arbitration of Plaintiff’s claims. (12/20/22 Ruling.)  
On October 4, 2023, this Court, sua sponte, set a
hearing to reconsider Defendant’s motion to compel arbitration, continuing the October
4, 2023, hearing on Plaintiff’s motion for reconsideration.  Parties submitted simultaneous briefs on November
20, 2023, addressing the holdings in Yeh v. Superior Court of Contra Costa
County (Cal. Ct. App., Sept. 6, 2023, No. A166537) 2023 WL 5741703; Kielar v. Superior Court of Placer County (Cal. Ct. App., Aug. 16, 2023, No. C096773)
2023 WL 5270559; Montemayor v. Ford Motor Company (2023) 92
Cal.App.5th 958, review filed (Aug. 1, 2023); and Ford
Motor Warranty Cases (2023) 89 Cal.App.5th 1324, review
granted (July 19, 2023).
 
Motion for Reconsideration      
A
statutory motion for reconsideration requires that the motion be made 10 days
from the date the order at issue is served.  (C.C.P. §1008.)  However, the Court has discretion to
reconsider an order on its own motion pursuant to its “constitutionally derived
authority.”  (Le Francois v. Goel (2005)
35 Cal.4th 1094, 1096.)  Section 1008
limits the parties’ ability to file repetitive motions to reconsider but does
not limit the court’s ability to reconsider its prior interim orders to correct
its own errors.  (Id. at pg.
1109.)
As the
Court is not constrained by the limitations or the requirements of C.C.P. §1008
and based on its inherent authority, the Court reconsiders its order compelling
this matter to arbitration. (Id. at pg. 1095.)
 
Motion to Compel Arbitration
The
distinguishing facts and procedural posture in Felisilda v. FCA US LLC (2020) 53
Cal.App.5th 486, coupled with recent
and persuasive case authority warrants revocation of the Court’s prior order.
At the
time Defendants made their motion to compel arbitration, Defendants relied on Felisilda
as it was the only case from a California appellate court to decide, based on
the principles of equitable estoppel and third-party beneficiary that a vehicle
manufacturer could force the plaintiff to arbitrate although the manufacturer
was not a party to the retail sales contract between Plaintiff and the dealer.  (Felisilda v. FCA US LLC (2020) 53 Cal.App.5th 486, 495.)  However, Division Eight of the Second District
Court of Appeal declined to follow Felisilda and disagreed with its
conclusion that the manufacturer had the power to elect arbitration although
not a signatory since the sales contract was not the source of the manufacturer
warranties at issue in the case, Plaintiff did not agree to arbitrate claims
with the manufacturer, and the sales contract “could not be construed to bind
the purchaser to arbitrate with the universe of unnamed third parties.”  (Ford Motor Warranty Cases
(2023) 89 Cal.App.5th 1324, 1335.)
Felisilda is distinguishable in that the dealer, who was a
party to the sales contract, moved to compel arbitration of all claims
including those against the manufacturer, who did not oppose the motion. The
trial court found it was the court’s prerogative to send the entire matter to
arbitration at the dealer’s request. (Felisilda, 53 Cal.App.5th at pg. 498.)  Here, Plaintiff did not sue the dealer, the
dealer is not a party to the action, and Defendants are moving to compel.  
More
recently in Montemayor v. Ford Motor Company (Cal. Ct. App., June
26, 2023, No. B320477) 2023 WL 4181909,
Division Seven of the Second Appellate District affirmed the trial court’s
order denying Defendant’s motion to compel arbitration as Ford was not a party
to the sales contract and could not enforce the arbitration provision under the
principles of equitable estoppel or as a third-party beneficiary of the
contract.  (Montemayor, 2023 WL 4181909, at *1-2.) 
Additionally,
on August 16, 2023, California’s Third Court of Appeal’s decision in Keilar
v. The Superior Court of Placer County (2023) 94 Cal.App.5th 614, issued a
holding further bolstering support for the prevailing authority finding that
contracts between a Plaintiff and non-signatory selling dealer cannot be relied
upon by a vehicle manufacturer to compel arbitration in a breach of warranty
case. The Keilar Court underscored that “[t]he doctrine of equitable
estoppel is the exception to “‘the general rule that a nonsignatory cannot be
compelled to arbitrate and cannot invoke an agreement to arbitrate, without
being a party to that arbitration agreement.”  (Keilar, 94
Cal.App.5th at pg. 430, quoting JSM Tuscany, LLC v. Superior Court (2011)
193 Cal.App.4th 1222, 1236-1237.)  The Keilar
Court further stated that even referencing an agreement within an
arbitration clause is not enough to grant a non-signatory Defendant standing to
compel arbitration, as the plaintiff’s actual dependance on the underlying
contract in making out the claim against the non-signatory is “always the sine
qua non of an appropriate situation for applying equitable estoppel.” (Id.,
citations omitted.)
Where
appellate decisions are in conflict, the Court exercising inferior jurisdiction
can and must make a choice between the conflicting decisions. (Auto Equity
Sales, Inc. v. Superior Court of Santa Clara County (1962) 57 Cal.2d 450,
456.)  The Court considers the analyses
in Ford Motor Warranty Cases, Montemayor, Keilar,
and Yeh more persuasive as they
address the issues more succinctly and within the same context. 
The Lease
(“Lease”) at issue is made between Plaintiff and Keyes European.  (Decl. of Ameripour ¶4, Exh. 2.)  Defendants are not parties to the Lease.  (See Decl.
of Ameripour ¶4, Exh. 2.)  The Lease
defines “we,” “us,” and “our” as the “Lessor.” (Decl. of Ameripour ¶4, Exh. 2. at
pg. 1.)  Here, MBZ and Silver Star moved
to compel arbitration; Plaintiff did not sue the Lessor. This is a critical
difference as Ford Motor Warranty Cases recognized
the distinction between who had the power to elect arbitration (“You” and “Us”)
as opposed to the scope or subject matter of arbitrable issues (disputes
with third parties including non-signatories).  (Ford Motor Warranty Cases, 89 Cal.App.5th at pg. 1339 [“Who may enforce an
arbitration agreement is a separate matter from the types of disputes the
agreement covers.”].)  Defendants
improperly conflate both issues.
The
contract in Felisilda states:
Any claim or
dispute, whether in contract, tort, statute or otherwise . . . between you and
us . . . which arises out of or relates to . . . [the] condition
of this vehicle, this contract or any resulting transaction or relationship
(including any such relation with third parties who do not sign this contract)
shall, at your or our election, be resolved by neutral, binding arbitration and
not by a court action. 
 
(Felisilda, 53 Cal.App.5th at pg. 490.) 
The
contract at issue here is substantially similar: 
Any claim or
dispute, whether in contract, tort, statute or otherwise, . . . between you and us or our
employees, agents, successors or assigns, which arises out of or relates to
your credit application, purchase or condition of this vehicle, this contract
or any resulting transaction or relationship arising out of this lease shall,
at the election of either you or us, or our successors or assigns, be resolved
by neutral, binding arbitration and not by a court action. 
 
(Decl. of Ameripour ¶4, Exh. 2 at pg. 2.)
Based
on the lease’s express provisions, MBZ and Silver Star do not have the power to
elect arbitration of issues covered by the lease
based on the arbitration provision’s scope that included resulting
relationships with third parties.  (Decl.
of Ameripour ¶4, Exh. 2 at pg. 2.)
Therefore,
Plaintiff’s claims are founded on the Lease with the Lessor, precluding
application of equitable estoppel.  Under
California law, the general rule is that “only a party to an arbitration
agreement is bound by or may enforce the agreement.”  (C.C.P. §1281.2.)  However, one exception is the principle of
equitable estoppel which applies “when the causes of action against the
nonsignatory are ‘intimately founded in and intertwined’ with the underlying
contract obligations . . ..” (Boucher v. Alliance Title Co.,
Inc. (2005) 127 Cal.App.4th 262, 272.)  Under those circumstances, where a plaintiff
“relies on contract terms in a claim against a non-signatory defendant, even if
not exclusively, a plaintiff may be equitably estopped from repudiating the
arbitration clause contained in that agreement.”  (Id.) 
          In applying equitable estoppel, the
Court examines Plaintiff’s claims to determine if they are “intertwined” with
the Plaintiff’s obligations imposed by the Lease.  (Goldman v. KPMG, LLP (2009) 173
Cal.App.4th 209, 218.)  Defendants
contend that Plaintiff’s claims under Song-Beverly against Defendants fundamentally
results from and are inseparable from the Lease and the alleged obligations of
MBZ that flow from the relationship that was created by and
through
the Lease.  (Motion to Compel, pg. 7.)  Defendants conclude that Plaintiff is
equitably estopped from repudiating the arbitration provision, which is part of
the Lease. 
          The Lease obligated Plaintiff to pay Keyes
European the monthly payments for the vehicle according to the stated terms and
conditions.  The complaint does not
assert any claim founded upon Plaintiff’s payment obligations to MBZ or Silver
Star.  Rather, Plaintiff’s claims are
based on MBZ’s statutory obligations to reimburse consumers or replace the
vehicles when unable to repair in accordance with its warranty.  (Complaint ¶¶26-28.)
          Ford Motor Warranty Cases
observed that warranties from a non-party manufacturer are not part of the
sales contract.  (Ford Motor Warranty
Cases, 89
Cal.App.5th at pg. 621, citing Corporation
of Presiding Bishop of Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints v. Cavanaugh (1963)
217 Cal.App.2d 492, 514, and Greenman v. Yuba Power Products, Inc. (1963)
59 Cal.2d 57.)  Here, Keyes European
expressly disclaimed any warranties, express or implied on the vehicle
including for warranties of merchantability or of fitness.  (Decl. of Ameripour ¶4, Exh. 2 at pg. 2 §15.)  The Montemayor court adopted the same
reasoning as Ford Motor Warranty Cases.  (Montemayor, 2023 WL 4181909, at *5.)
Defendants
have also not established that it can enforce the contract as a third-party
beneficiary.  A contract made expressly
for the benefit of a third person, “may be enforced by him at any time before
the parties thereto rescind it.”  (Civ.
Code §1559).  Persons who are “only
incidentally or remotely benefited by it” are excluded.  (Lake Almanor Associates L.P. v.
Huffman-Broadway Group, Inc. (2009) 178 Cal.App.4th 1194, 1199.)  To establish that it is an intended,
third-party beneficiary of the contract, Defendant must show “(1) whether the
third party would in fact benefit from the contract, but also (2) whether a
motivating purpose of the contracting parties was to provide a benefit to the
third party, (“and not simply acknowledge that a benefit to the third party may
follow from the contract”), and (3) whether permitting a third party to bring
its own breach of contract action against a contracting party is consistent
with the objectives of the contract and the reasonable expectations of the
contracting parties. All three elements must be satisfied to permit the
third-party action to go forward.” (Goonewardene v. ADP, LLC (2019)
6 Cal.5th 817, 830.)
          Defendants’ motion relied on the Lease
provision that identifies the scope of arbitrable matters including
claims arising from any resulting relationship with third parties.  (Motion Compel Arb, pgs. 5-6.)  However, the mere mention of third parties in
the provision governing scope does not establish that the Lease’s motivating
purpose or intent was to benefit Defendants.  ­(Ford Motor Warranty Cases, 89 Cal.App.5th at pg. 621.)
 The “motivating purpose” of the Lease
was to finance the vehicle with the Lessor; it was not made expressly for the
benefit of a third person.  (Montemayor,
2023 WL 4181909, at *10.)  Therefore, Defendants
have not established that they can invoke the arbitration provision as third-party
beneficiaries.
 
Conclusion
          A
moving party’s burden is to establish that a valid arbitration agreement exists
between the parties.  (Molecular
Analytical Systems v. Ciphergen Biosystems, Inc. (2010) 186
Cal.App.4th 696, 705.)  Defendants have
not met their initial burden. Accordingly, the Court, sua sponte, vacates its December 20, 2022, ruling that granted
Defendants’ motion to compel arbitration and issues this order, denying
Defendants’ motion to compel arbitration.
Defendants to
give notice.
