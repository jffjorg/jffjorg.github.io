Plaintiff Eileen Vines
(“Vines”) (“Plaintiff”) moves to compel Defendant American Honda Motor Company,
Inc. (“AHMC”) (“Defendant”) to comply with this Court’s July 12, 2023 Ruling
compelling Defendant to provide further responses to Plaintiff’s Request for
Production of Documents (Set One) (“RFP”) Nos. 20, 23, 44, and 47.  (Notice of Motion, pg. 2; C.C.P. §§2031.310 et
seq.)
Plaintiff requests monetary
sanctions in the amount of $2,160.00 for Defendant’s failure to comply with
this Court’s July 12, 2023 Ruling and for cost incurred in filing the instant
motion.  (Notice of Motion, pg. 2; C.C.P.
§§2031.310 et seq.)
 
Background 
On
October 26, 2021, Plaintiff filed her operative complaint against AHMC alleging
five causes of action: (1) Violation of Song-Beverly Act §1793.2(d); (2) Violation
of Song-Beverly Act §1793.2(b); (3) Violation of Song-Beverly Act
§1793.2(A)(3); (4) Violation of Song-Beverly Act §1794 and Civil Code
§1791.2(a)- Breach of Express Written Warranty; and (5) Breach of Implied
Warranty of Merchantability, Civil Code §§ 1791.1, 1794,
1795.5.  (See Complaint.)  Plaintiff alleges on or about July 15, 2019,
she purchased a 2019 Honda Accord (“Subject Vehicle”) that contained or
developed serious defects including electrical and brake defects.  (Complaint ¶¶8, 10.) 
On
July 5, 2022, Plaintiff propounded her first set of RFPs on Defendant, seeking
documents relating to Defendant’s internal investigation and analysis of the
electrical defects and brake defects, including documents concerning: (A) the
Subject Vehicle (i.e., RFP No. 2) and (B) internal knowledge and investigation
related to the electrical defects and brake defects in 2019 Honda Accord
vehicles (i.e., RFP Nos. 20, 23, 44, and 47).  (Decl. of Littles ¶¶22, 23, Exh. 6.)  On August 12, 2022, Defendant provided its
responses that consisted of boilerplate objections, responses that were not
Code-compliant, and failed to produce all responsive documents.  (Decl. of Littles ¶24, Exh. 7.)  Defendant then provided further responses to
Plaintiff on February 17, 2023, and April 6, 2023.  (Decl. of Littles ¶¶25-26, Exhs. 8-9.)  On July 12, 2023, this Court ruled on
Plaintiff’s motion for compel further responses to RFP Nos. 2, 20, 23, 44, and
47.  (7/12/23 Minute Order.)
Plaintiff
filed the instant motion on September 15, 2023. 
On October 24, 2023, the parties filed a joint stipulation to continue
the hearing on Plaintiff’s motion to December 8, 2023.  On November 27, 2023, Defendant filed its opposition.  Plaintiff filed her reply on December 4,
2023.
 
Meet
and Confer
On
November 8, 2023, parties met and conferred via videoconference, and again on
November 29, 2023, and spoke telephonically on December 1, 2023.  (Decl. of Carvalho ¶16.)  Plaintiff’s counsel declares Plaintiff
proposed a list of search terms to be used in searching custodial emails
responsive to RFP Nos. 20, 23, 44, and 47, but Defendant has refused to perform
a good faith search in this case.  (Decl.
of Carvalho ¶20.)  Plaintiff has
demonstrated a reasonable and good faith attempt to resolve discovery issues
outside of court.  (C.C.P. §§2016.040,
2031.310(b)(2).)
 
Legal
Standard
“If
a party filing a response to a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or
sampling under Sections 2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230, 2031.240, and 2031.280
thereafter fails to permit the inspection, copying, testing, or sampling in
accordance with that party’s statement of compliance, the demanding party may
move for an order compelling compliance.” 
(C.C.P. §2031.320(a).)
 
Motion
to Compel Compliance
This
Court granted Plaintiff’s
motion to request further responses to RFP Nos. 20, 23, 44, and 47, and to the extent responses are subject to privilege, Defendant
was ordered to produce a detailed privilege log specify the date of the
document; the type of document; the name of the documents author(s); the names
of the recipient(s), including the names of those receiving copies; and the
nature and basis of the privilege claimed. 
(7/12/23 Minute Order, pg. 3.)
 
1.    
RFP Nos. 20 and 23
Plaintiff argues Defendant
agreed to produce NHTSA communications related to electrical and brake
defects.  (Decl. of Carvalho ¶9.). Defendant
has not produced any NHTSA documents to Plaintiff. Defendant has not produced
any documents related to NHTSA Investigation PE22-0003, in which NHTSA
investigated CMBS issues in certain Honda vehicles, including 2019 Honda
Accords (like the Subject Vehicle).  Plaintiff argues these documents are relevant
to Plaintiff’s claims and are responsive to Plaintiff’s RFP Nos. 20 and 23.  (See Santana v. FCA US, LLC (2020) 56
Cal.App.5th 334, 344.)
Further, during meet and
confer efforts, Defendant proposed search terms, all of which are QIS numbers,
which are insufficient to yield the emails this Court ordered Defendant to
produce.
Defendant is ordered to conduct
the following email searches for RFP Nos. 20 and 23, limited to the date range
of one year before Plaintiff’s purchase of the Subject Vehicle (purchased on
May 31, 2019), to the present:
1.    
(Accord OR [Platform]) AND CMBS AND (NHTSA OR recal*)
2.    
(Accord OR [Platform]) AND (CMBS AND (crash* OR injur* OR
defect*))
3.    
(Accord OR [Platform]) AND (CMBS OR brak*) AND (Sudden* OR
unexpect* OR unintent* OR spontan* OR inadvert* OR accident *))
Further, Defendant is
ordered to produce the following custodians’ NHTSA communications: 
a.      Jeff Chang: Honda Division
Head, Product Safety, Product Regulatory Office who was involved in Honda’s
internal investigation that provided responses to the NHTSA CMBS Investigation.

b.     Jeff Crane: Honda engineer 
c.      Christopher Montgomery:
Honda engineer 
d.     Norm Ruger: Honda Tech Lead

e.      Keith Gramila: Honda Lead
Quality Investigator 
 
2.    
RFP Nos. 44 and 47
Defendant is ordered to
conduct the following email searches for RFP Nos. 44 and 47, limited to the
date range of one year before Plaintiff’s purchase of the Subject Vehicle to
the present:
1.    
(Accord OR [Platform]) AND ((Bluetooth OR BT OR hands-free OR
handsfree OR pair*) AND (call OR audio OR register* OR del*) AND (problem OR
err* OR unabl* OR (not AND work)) 
2.    
(Accord OR [Platform]) AND (“Display Blank”) AND
(Date=2018-05-31..2023-11-30) 
3.    
(Accord OR [Platform]) AND (“Goes Blank and RVC Inop”) 
4.    
(Accord OR [Platform]) AND ((display OR image OR audio OR nav* OR
gps OR camera OR RVC) AND (blank OR freez* OR froz* OR failur*)) 
 
Sanctions
          “Except
as provided in subdivision (d), the court shall impose a monetary sanction
under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person,
or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel compliance
with a demand, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust.”  (C.C.P.
§2031.320(b).)
          Plaintiff’s request for sanctions
against Defendant is granted.  Plaintiff’s counsel declares her hourly rate
is $360/hour, and she spent approximately six hours drafting the instant
motion.  (Decl. of Theophil ¶9.)  The Court calculates sanctions as follows:
$360/hour x 6 hours = $2,160.00.
          Defendant
is ordered to pay Plaintiff sanctions in the amount of $2,160.00 within 20
days.
 
Conclusion
Plaintiff’s motion to
compel compliance with this Court’s July 12, 2023, Order is granted.  Defendants are to comply within 20 days of
this ruling.
Defendant is ordered to pay
Plaintiff sanctions in the amount of $2,160.00 within 20 days.
Moving Party to give notice.
