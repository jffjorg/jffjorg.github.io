          Background
On January 24, 2023,
Plaintiff filed her operative complaint in the instant action against Defendant
alleging nine causes of action: (1) Unlawful Discrimination (Gov. Code §12940(a));
(2) Failure to Reasonably Accommodate (Gov. Code §12940(m)(1)); (3) Failure to
Engage in the Interactive Process (Gov. Code §12940(n)); (4) Retaliation (Gov.
Code §12940(h)); (5) Retaliation (Lab. Code §1102.5); (6) Retaliation (Gov.
Code §12940(m)(2); (7) Unlawful Harassment (Gov. Code §12940(j); (8) Failure to
Prevent Discrimination or Harassment (Gov. Code §12940(k); and (9) Unfair Business
Practices (Bus. & Prof. Code §17200). 
Plaintiff’s causes of action stem from Plaintiff’s employment by
Defendant as a Market Captain providing retail technology to technology
retailers.  (Complaint ¶11.)
On March 21, 2023, Defendant
filed the instant motion.  Plaintiff
filed an opposition to the motion on November 27, 2023. Defendant filed its
reply December 1, 2023.
          
          Motion to Compel Arbitration
1.    
Enforceability
of the Arbitration Agreement
Federal
law provides for enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement. The Federal
Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §1, et seq. (“FAA”), establishes a strong
federal policy in favor of arbitration of disputes where a written arbitration
agreement exists. Section 2 of the FAA provides, in pertinent part that “[a]
written provision . . . to settle by arbitration a controversy thereafter
arising out of such contract . . .  shall
be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable.”  (9 U.S.C. §2.) 
The purpose of the FAA is to “reverse the longstanding judicial
hostility to arbitration agreements.” (Gilmer v. Interstate/Johnson Lane
Corp. (1991) 500 U.S. 20, 24.)  The
FAA places arbitration agreements “on an equal footing with other contracts and
[requires courts] to enforce them according to their terms.”  (AT&T Mobility, LLC v. Concepcion (2011)
563 U.S. 333, 339; see also Rent-A-Center West, Inc. v. Jackson (2010)
561 U.S. 63, 67 [“The FAA reflects the fundamental principle that arbitration
is a matter of contract.”].)  The FAA
will preempt not only a state law that “discriminat[es] on its face against
arbitration,” but also a state law that “covertly accomplishes the same
objective by disfavoring contracts that (oh so coincidentally) have the
defining features of arbitration agreements.” (Kindred Nursing Centers
Limited Partnership v. Clark (2017) 137 S.Ct. 1421, 1426.)
The
United States Supreme Court has specifically held that the FAA applies to
employment contracts: “[A]s a matter of law the answer is clear.  In the Federal Arbitration Act, Congress has
instructed federal courts to enforce arbitration agreements according to their
terms.”  (Epic Systems Corp. v. Lewis (2018)
138 S.Ct. 1612, 1619, [holding that employees must submit to arbitration
agreements including those with collective action waivers].)  
The
FAA restricts a court’s inquiry related to compelling arbitration to two
threshold questions: (1) whether there was an agreement to arbitrate between
the parties; and (2) whether the agreement covers the dispute.  (Howsam v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc. (2002)
537 U.S. 79, 84.)  Here, both criteria
are satisfied. First, Plaintiff agreed to arbitration when she entered into the
Arbitration Agreement (“Agreement”) that contained the relevant arbitration
clause.  (Decl. of Tylki ¶¶6-9, Exh. A.)  Second, the Agreement expressly covers “all employment-related disputes, and
[Plaintiff’s] receipt of the compensation, pay raises, and other benefits paid
to [Plaintiff] by [Defendant] at present and in the future, [Plaintiff]
agree[s] that any and all controversies, claims, or disputes with anyone
(including [Defendant] and any employee, officer, director, shareholder, or
benefit plan of [Defendant], in their capacity as such or otherwise), arising
out of, relating to, or resulting from [Plaintiff’s] employment with
[Defendant] or the termination of [Plaintiff’s] employment with [Defendant].”  (Decl. Tylki ¶¶6-9, Exh. A at §13(A).)  
California
law also favors arbitration for dispute resolution. The California Arbitration
Act (“CAA”), codified at C.C.P. §1281 et seq., provides, “A written
agreement to submit to arbitration an existing controversy or a controversy
thereafter arising is valid, enforceable and irrevocable, save upon such
grounds as exist for the revocation of any contract.”  (C.C.P. §1281; see also Grafton Partners
L.P. v. Superior Court (2005) 36 Cal.4th 944, 955 [“[U]nlike predispute
jury waivers, predispute arbitration agreements are specifically authorized by
statute.”].)  
“California
law, like federal law, favors enforcement of valid arbitration agreements.” (Armendariz
v. Foundation Health Psychcare Services, Inc. (2000) 24 Cal.4th 83, 97,
99.)  The public policy in favor of
arbitration is so strong that California courts have held that an employee is
“bound by the provisions of the [arbitration] agreement regardless of whether
[he] read it or [was] aware of the arbitration clause when [he] signed the
document.”  (Brookwood v. Bank of
America (1996) 45 Cal.App.4th 1667, citing Macaulay v. Norlander (1992)
12 Cal.App.4th 1.)  The only prerequisite
for a court to order arbitration is a determination that the parties have
entered into an agreement to arbitrate the dispute.  (United Transportation Union v. Southern
California Rapid Transit District (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 804, 808.)  Thus, arbitration must be ordered “unless the
agreement clearly does not apply to the dispute in question.” (Vianna v.
Doctors’ Management Co. (1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 1186, 1189.)
Defendant proved the existence of an
arbitration agreement with Plaintiff. 
Defendant submitted evidence that on June 8, 2019, at 3:57 PM MDT, Plaintiff
signed the Agreement.  (See Decl.
of Tylki ¶¶9, 12, Exh. A.)  Pursuant to C.C.P. §1281.2, Defendant demonstrates it
made a formal demand for arbitration on March 9, 2023, via a telephone
conversation, and later, on March 16, 2023, via email, in which Plaintiff’s counsel
replied that Plaintiff did not intend to stipulate to arbitration.  (Decl. of Rastegar ¶¶3-5, Exh. 2.)  
Defendant’s
objections to the authenticity of Plaintiff’s electronic signature are
unavailing.  Civil Code §1633.9(a)
provides: “[a]n electronic record or electronic signature is attributable to a
person if it was the act of that person. The act of the person may be shown in
any manner, including a showing of the efficacy of any security procedure
applied to determine the person to which the electronic record or electronic
signature was attributable.”  (Civ. Code
§1633.9(a).)  “As a preliminary matter
the court is only required to make a finding of the agreement’s existence, not
an evidentiary determination of its validity.”  (Condee v. Longwood Management Corp.
(2001) 88 Cal.App.4th 215, 218-219.)  “The
party seeking authentication may carry its burden ‘in any manner,’ including by
presenting evidence of the contents of the contract in question and the
circumstances surrounding the contract’s execution.”  (Fabian v. Renovate America, Inc.
(2019) 42 Cal.App.5th 1062, 1068.)  Circumstantial
evidence is admissible to authenticate a signature.  (Ruiz v. Moss Brothers Auto Group, Inc.
(2019) 232 Cal.App.4th 836, 845.)
Defendant
met its burden to demonstrate the authenticity of Plaintiff’s signature.  At the time of Plaintiff’s employment,
Defendant had a pattern and practice of onboarding its new hires, including
Plaintiff, using an electronic onboarding system for new hires to review and
sign certain onboarding documents.  (Evid.
Code §1105; Decl. of Tylki ¶6.)  Employee
onboarding documents included At-Will Employment, Confidential Information, Invention
Assignment, and the Arbitration Agreement.  (Decl. of Tylki ¶6.)  Defendant’s former Vice President, People
Success, North America declares, “each user of the [onboarding] Platform was
required to create a personal account that was unique to the individual user.
Each user would have created this account by validating their last name and
9-digit social security number. Once the user entered this information, the
account was created with the email address that the user entered and a unique,
secure password that the user set. [Defendant] was never able to retrieve the
unique password used by employees to access their Platform, which remains true
as of the date of this Declaration. Further, [Defendant] could not access employees’
accounts to manipulate logins or change other information. Once logged into the
Platform, the Arbitration Agreement appeared on the screen before the employee,
who would then click “accepts” to indicate their agreement. Employees
affirmatively agreed to use an electronic signature when signing the document
electronically. The date, time of day, name of employee, email address, and
where the employee electronically signed the agreement was then recorded.”  (Decl. of Tylki ¶8.)  Defendant submitted the digital certificate
confirming Plaintiff’s signature, email address, and her IP address.  (Decl. of Tylki ¶¶9, 12, Exh. A.)  
Here,
in light of Defendant’s pattern and practice of electronically onboarding
employees and providing them with an arbitration agreement and other onboarding
documents as a condition of employment, Plaintiff’s continued employment
demonstrates that she assented to the documents.  (Evid. Code §1105; see also Diaz v. Sohnen
Enterprises (2019) 34 Cal.App.5th 126, 130.)
Based on the foregoing, Defendant proved the
existence of a valid Agreement that is enforceable by Defendant. 
 
2.    
Covered Claims
The
Agreement states, in part:
IN CONSIDERATION OF MY
EMPLOYMENT WITH THE COMPANY, ITS PROMISE TO ARBITRATE ALL EMPLOYMENT-RELATED
DISPUTES, AND MY RECEIPT OF THE COMPENSATION, PAY RAISES, AND OTHER BENEFITS
PAID TO ME BY THE COMPANY, AT PRESENT AND IN THE FUTURE, I AGREE THAT ANY AND
ALL CONTROVERSIES, CLAIMS, OR DISPUTES WITH ANYONE (INCLUDING THE COMPANY AND
ANY EMPLOYEE, OFFICER, DIRECTOR, SHAREHOLDER, OR BENEFIT PLAN OF THE COMPANY,
IN THEIR CAPACITY AS SUCH OR OTHERWISE), ARISING OUT OF, RELATING TO, OR
RESULTING FROM MY EMPLOYMENT WITH THE COMPANY OR THE TERMINATION OF MY
EMPLOYMENT WITH THE COMPANY, INCLUDING ANY BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT, SHALL
BE SUBJECT TO BINDING ARBITRATION UNDER THE ARBITRATION PROVISIONS SET FORTH IN
CALIFORNIA CODE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE SECTIONS 1280 THROUGH 1294.2 (THE "CCP
ACT"), AND PURSUANT TO CALIFORNIA LAW. THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT SHALL
CONTINUE TO APPLY WITH FULL FORCE AND EFFECT NOTWITHSTANDING THE APPLICATION OF
PROCEDURAL RULES SET FORTH IN THE CCP ACT. DISPUTES THAT I AGREE TO ARBITRATE,
AND THEREBY AGREE TO WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY, INCLUDE ANY STATUTORY
CLAIMS UNDER LOCAL, STATE, OR FEDERAL LAW, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
CLAIMS UNDER TITLE VII OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT OF 1964, THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES
ACT OF 1990, THE AGE DISCRIMINATION IN EMPLOYMENT ACT OF 1967, THE OLDER
WORKERS BENEFIT PROTECTION ACT, THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT, THE WORKER ADJUSTMENT
AND RETRAINING NOTIFICATION ACT, THE FAIR LABOR STANDARDS ACT, THE
CALIFORNIA FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING ACT, THE FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE
ACT, THE CALIFORNIA FAMILY RIGHTS ACT, THE CALIFORNIA LABOR CODE, CLAIMS OF
HARASSMENT, DISCRIMINATION, AND WRONGFUL TERMINATION, AND ANY OTHER STATUTORY
OR COMMON LAW CLAIMS. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, I UNDERSTAND THAT
NOTHING IN THIS AGREEMENT CONSTITUTES A WAIVER OF MY RIGHTS UNDER SECTION 7 OF
THE NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS ACT. I FURTHER UNDERSTAND THAT THIS AGREEMENT TO
ARBITRATE ALSO APPLIES TO ANY DISPUTES THAT THE COMPANY MAY HAVE WITH ME.
 
(Decl. of Tylki ¶9, Exh. A, emphases
added.)   
Plaintiff’s
claims arise from her employment relationship with Defendant and are therefore
governed by the Agreement. Based on the foregoing, Defendant met its burden to establish
the Agreement covers the causes of action asserted in Plaintiff’s complaint.
 
3.    
Unconscionability
“[P]rocedural
and substantive unconscionability must both be present in order for a court to
exercise its discretion to refuse to enforce a contract or clause under the
doctrine of unconscionability.”  (Armendariz,
24 Cal.4th at pg. 102.)  Courts invoke a
sliding scale which disregards the regularity of the procedural process of the
contract formation, that creates the terms, in proportion to the greater
harshness or unreasonableness of the substantive terms themselves, i.e., the
more substantively oppressive the contract term, the less evidence of
procedural unconscionability is required to conclude that the term is
unenforceable, and vice versa.  (Id.,
at pg. 114.)  Plaintiff bears the burden
of proving that the provision at issue is both procedurally and substantively
unconscionable.  
 
a.     
Procedural
Unconscionability
Plaintiff
argues the Arbitration Agreement is procedurally unconscionable because the
Agreement was presented to Plaintiff as a condition of her employment on “on a
take-it-or-leave-it basis,” and Plaintiff was unable to review the arbitration
rules because Defendant provided the rules via a link, but the link to
arbitration rules was broken. 
(Opposition, pgs. 11-12.)
“Procedural
unconscionability focuses on the elements of oppression and surprise.
[Citations] ‘Oppression arises from an inequality of bargaining power which
results in no real negotiation and an absence of meaningful choice . . .
Surprise involves the extent to which the terms of the bargain are hidden in a
‘prolix printed form’ drafted by a party in a superior bargaining position.’
[Citations.]”  (Roman v. Superior
Court (2009) 172 Cal.App.4th 1462, 1469.)
Procedural
unconscionability “focuses on the unequal bargaining positions and hidden terms
common in the context of adhesion contracts.” 
(24 Hour Fitness, Inc. v. Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th
1199, 1212-1213.)  Although standard
employment agreements offered on a “take it or leave it” basis are generally
considered contracts of adhesion, this alone is not enough to equate to
unconscionability.  (See Graham
v. Scissor-Tail, Inc. (1981) 28 Cal.3d 807, 817-819 [“To describe a
contract as adhesive in character is not to indicate its legal effect. It is,
rather, ‘the beginning and not the end of the analysis insofar as
enforceability of its terms are concerned.’”].) 
Adhesion contracts are “fully enforceable . . . unless certain other
factors are present which under established legal rules—legislative or
judicial—operate to render it otherwise.”  (Id. at pgs. 819-820; Harper v.
Ultimo (2003) 113 Cal.App.4th 1402, 1409 [adhesion alone does not render
arbitration agreements unconscionable]; see also Armendariz, 24
Cal.4th at 114; Lagatree v. Luce, Forward, Hamilton & Scripps, LLP
(1999) 74 Cal.App.4th 1105 [discussing many authorities upholding
arbitration agreements contained in adhesion contracts].) 
The
Court is not convinced by Plaintiff’s argument that she was unable to find the
rules about arbitration because the link provided to her was broken, and she
was not provided with any copies of the arbitration rules.  (Opposition, pg. 12.)  The URL to the JAMS rules was provided in
Exhibit E to the Arbitration Agreement, and while the hyperlink does not
properly direct to the JAMS Rules, the URL itself is clear as to what link
should be typed in to access the JAMS rules. 
(Decl. of Tylki, Exh. A at Exh. E.)
Plaintiff’s
argument in opposition that her requirement to sign the Arbitration Agreement
as a condition of her employment and is therefore procedurally unconscionable
is unavailing and is unsupported by case law. 
The adhesive nature of arbitration agreements in the employment context
does not render an agreement unenforceable. 
(Lagatree, 74 Cal.App.4th at pg. 1127 [“[C]ases uniformly agree
that a compulsory predispute arbitration agreement is not rendered
unenforceable just because it is required as a condition of employment or
offered on a ‘take it or leave it’ basis.”]; Armendariz, 24 Cal. 4th at pg.
113 [holding that the requirement that the employee sign an arbitration
agreement may contain some elements of procedural unconscionability, but that,
in itself, does not invalidate the arbitration agreement]; Ajamian v.
CantorCO2e, LP (2012) 203 Cal.App.4th 771, 796 [“Where there is no other
indication of oppression or surprise, the degree of procedural
unconscionability of an adhesion agreement is low[.]”].)  
Here,
the terms of the Arbitration Agreement do not appear hidden or obscure: the
section labeled “Arbitration and Equitable Relief” is bolded and underlined,
with italicized subsections for “Arbitration,” followed by “Procedure,”
“Remedy,” “Administrative Relief,” and “Voluntary Nature of Agreement.”  (Decl. of Tylki, Exh. A.).  The last subsection of the Arbitration
Agreement states: “I ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT I AM EXECUTING THIS AGREEMENT
VOLUNTARILY AND WITHOUT ANY DURESS OR UNDUE INFLUENCE BY THE COMPANY OR ANYONE
ELSE. I ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT I HAVE RECEIVED A COPY OF THE TEXT OF
CALIFORNIA LABOR CODE SECTION 2870 IN EXHIBIT B. I FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGE AND
AGREE THAT I HAVE CAREFULLY READ THIS AGREEMENT AND THAT I HAVE ASKED ANY
QUESTIONS NEEDED FOR ME TO UNDERSTAND THE TERMS, CONSEQUENCES, AND BINDING
EFFECT OF THIS AGREEMENT AND FULLY UNDERSTAND IT, INCLUDING THAT I AM WAIVING
MY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL. FINALLY, I AGREE THAT I HAVE BEEN PROVIDED AN
OPPORTUNITY TO SEEK THE ADVICE OF AN ATTORNEY OF MY CHOICE BEFORE SIGNING THIS
AGREEMENT.”  (Decl. of Tylki, Exh. A,
emphasis added.)  Accordingly, the
Arbitration Agreement’s duty to arbitrate was not hidden from Plaintiff in a
manner as to make her unaware of the agreement to arbitrate.
Based
on the foregoing, the Court finds the Arbitration Agreement is at the most
minimally procedurally unconscionable.  However,
as discussed below, the Court finds the arbitration agreement is not
substantively unconscionable.  
 
b.    
Substantive
Unconscionability
Plaintiff
argues the Arbitration Agreement is substantively unconscionable because the
agreement was presented as “take it or leave it” to the party with lesser
bargaining power without opportunity to negotiate or discuss.  (Opposition, pg. 13.)  
“Substantive
unconscionability focuses on the actual terms of the agreement and evaluates
whether they create ‘overly harsh’ or ‘‘one-sided’ results’ [Citations] that
is, whether contractual provisions reallocate risks in an objectively
unreasonable or unexpected manner. 
[Citation] Substantive unconscionability ‘may take various forms,’ but
typically is found in the employment context when the arbitration agreement is
‘one-sided’ in favor of the employer without sufficient justification, for
example, when ‘the employee’s claims against the employer, but not the
employer’s claims against the employee, are subject to arbitration.’
[Citations].”  (Roman, 172
Cal.App.4th at pgs. 1469-1470.)  In
determining whether an arbitration agreement is unconscionable, the Court
considers whether the agreement: (1) provides for a neutral arbitrator; (2)
provides for reasonable discovery; (3) requires a written award; (4) provides
for the same remedies that otherwise would be available in court; and (5) does
not require employees to bear costs unique to arbitration.  (See Armendariz, 24 Cal.4th at pgs.
102-103.)
The
Arbitration Agreement satisfies the requisite elements set forth in Armendariz
to determine the Agreement is not substantively unconscionable.  First, the Arbitration Agreement provides the
arbitration will apply the rules and procedures of the Employment Arbitration
Rules and Procedures set forth by Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services,
Inc. (the “JAMS Rules”). By incorporating the JAMS Rules, the Agreement
provides for the selection of a mutually agreed to neutral arbitrator.  (See JAMS Employment Arbitration Rules
& Procedures (“JAMS Rules”), Rules 7 and 15.)  The Agreement provides the parties with the opportunity
of selecting an arbitrator.  (See
JAMS Rules, Rule 15, “Arbitrator Selection, Disclosures, and Replacement”.)
Second,
the court in Armendariz explicitly acknowledged an arbitrator’s
authority to determine what constitutes sufficient discovery adequate to
arbitrate an employee’s claims.  (Armendariz,
24 Cal.4th at pg. 106 [employees are “entitled to discovery sufficient to
adequately arbitrate their statutory claim, including access to essential
documents and witnesses, as determined by the arbitrator.”].)  Here, the JAMS Rules provide for adequate
discovery, allowing an exchange of documents, interrogatories, and depositions.
(See JAMS Rules, Rule 17, “Exchange of Information”.)  The Agreement contains no actual limitation on
discovery and therefore does not limit Plaintiff’s discovery rights in any way.

Third,
The JAMS Rules provide for a written award with essential findings of fact and
conclusions of law on which the Award is based.  (See JAMS Rules, Rule 24, “Award.”) 
Fourth,
the Agreement provides for all relief that would be available in court,
stating: “The arbitrator shall have the power to award any remedies available
under applicable law.”  (Decl. of Tylki
¶9, Exh. A at ¶13B.)
Fifth,
under Armendariz, an employee cannot be required to pay any type of
expense that the employee would not be required to bear if he or she were free
to bring the action in court.  (Armendariz,
24 Cal.4th at pgs. 110-111.)  Here, the
Agreement places no obligations on Plaintiff to pay for or to contribute
towards the fees for the arbitrator and the use of the arbitration forum.  The Agreement requires Defendant to pay for
the costs of arbitration, stating, “[t]he company will pay for any
administrative or hearing fees charged by the arbitrator or JAMS.”  (Decl. of Tylki, ¶9, Exh. A at ¶13B.)
Based
on the evidence before the Court, the terms of the Arbitration Agreement do not
create overly harsh or one-sided results, satisfying the requirements for a substantively
conscionable agreement.
Based
on the foregoing, the Court finds the Arbitration Agreement is not substantively unconscionable.  
 
4.    
Stay of Current
Action
Pursuant
to C.C.P. §1281.4, if an application has been made to a court involving order
to arbitrate a controversy and such application is undetermined, the court
where the application is pending shall, upon motion of a party to the action,
stay the action until the application for an order to arbitrate is determined.  (C.C.P. §1281.4.)
Accordingly,
this case is stayed pending arbitration.
 
5.    
Conclusion
Defendant’s
motion to compel arbitration is granted. 
The case is stayed pending arbitration. The Court sets a non-appearance
case review for December 9, 2024, at 8:30 a.m.  The parties are directed to submit a joint
statement five calendar days in advance, apprising the Court of the status of
the arbitration.
