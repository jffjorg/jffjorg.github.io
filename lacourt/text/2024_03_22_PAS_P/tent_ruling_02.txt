Case No.: 24AHCV00012
 
 
[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER DENYING  DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO
  QUASH SERVICE OF SUMMONS
 
Date: March 22, 2024
Time:  8:30 a.m.
Dept.:  P



 
          I.        INTRODUCTION
          This appears to be an action
for breach of contract, retaliation, and harassment. Though unclear as to the
facts giving rise to these causes of action, Plaintiff George Beltran,
appearing in pro per, seeks emotional distress damages, actual damages and
general damages for losses already incurred. Beltran does identify the causes
of action within his Judicial Council form complaint, so the specific claims he
is making are somewhat unclear.  It
appears that the facts giving rise to the complaint concern an alleged breach
of a housing contract.
          Before the Court is Uribe’s motion to
quash service of summons, filed on January 30, 2024. 
          The motion to quash is itself unclear
and fails to identify any legal basis. 
It is therefore denied.
 
          II.
      LEGAL STANDARD
          There are four methods for serving a summons within the
State of California:  
(1) personal service – Code
Civ. Proc. §415.10; 
(2) substitute service – Code
Civ. Proc. §415.20; 
(3) mail service – Code Civ.
Proc. §415.30; 
(4) service by publication –
Code Civ. Proc. §415.50. 
Code Civ. Proc. §418.10(a)(1)
provides that a defendant, on or before the last day to plead, may file a
motion to quash service of the summons on the ground of lack of
jurisdiction. 
Code Civ. Proc. §415.20 
(a) [applies only to entity
defendants] 
(b) If a copy of the summons
and complaint cannot with reasonable diligence be personally delivered to the
person to be served, as specified in Section 416.60, 416.70, 416.80, or 416.90,
a summons may be served by leaving a copy of the summons and complaint at the
person’s dwelling house, usual place of abode, usual place of business, or
usual mailing address other than a United States Postal Service post office
box, in the presence of a competent member of the household or a person
apparently in charge of his or her office, place of business, or usual mailing
address other than a United States Postal Service post office box, at least 18
years of age, who shall be informed of the contents thereof, and by thereafter
mailing a copy of the summons and of the complaint by first-class mail, postage
prepaid to the person to be served at the place where a copy of the summons and
complaint were left. Service of a summons in this manner is deemed complete on
the 10th day after the mailing. 
 
III.     ANALYSIS
In
this case, it appears Defendant Uribe is objecting to the proof of service
filed January 8, 2024. Uribe urges “PLAINTIFF PROCESS SERVER MARK (CHECK) ON BEHALF
OF 416.90 (UNAUTHORIZED PERSON) EXHIBIT 1 WHICH IS NOT CONSISTENT WITH THE
SUMMONS EXHIBIT 2 IN WHICH IT PERTAINS TO NOTICE TO THE PERSON SERVED AND IS
NOT COMPLETED BY PERSONAL DELIVERY ON (DATE): IS MISSING.” (Motion p. 1:
21-24.) 
The
proof of service appears to be in order, however.  It is signed by the person who served the
papers, and indicates what was served, who was served, and on what date and
time. 
          To the extent that Uribe is arguing that he was not served,
this is not supported in the motion to quash. 
 To the extent that Uribe is
urging that the summons is incorrect because the date of personal service is
not filled out, Uribe does not any cite case law or statute as to how this
invalidates the proof of service.    
Consequently,
the motion to quash service of summons is denied.[1]
          
 
 
 
 
 
 
III.     CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
          Jaye Uribe’s motion to quash service of the summons and
complaint is DENIED.  Uribe is ordered to
file a responsive pleading within twenty (20) days. 
          The Clerk is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
