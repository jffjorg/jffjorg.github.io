```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to quash service of the summons and complaint. The defendant, Jaye Uribe, objected to the proof of service filed by the plaintiff, George Beltran, but the judge found that the proof of service appears to be in order. The defendant's argument that the summons is incorrect because the date of personal service is not filled out was not supported by any citation to case law or statute, and therefore the judge denied the motion. The defendant is ordered to file a responsive pleading within 20 days.
