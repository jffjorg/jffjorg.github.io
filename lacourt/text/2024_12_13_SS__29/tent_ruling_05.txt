Legal
Standard
 
“The purpose
of the law of summary judgment is to provide courts with a mechanism to cut
through the parties’ pleadings in order to determine whether, despite their
allegations, trial is in fact necessary to resolve their dispute.” (Aguilar
v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.) Code of Civil
Procedure section 437c, subdivision (c), “requires the trial judge to grant
summary judgment if all the evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably
deducible from the evidence’ and uncontradicted by other inferences or
evidence, show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that
the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” (Adler v.
Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.) “The function of
the pleadings in a motion for summary judgment is to delimit the scope of the
issues; the function of the affidavits or declarations is to disclose whether
there is any triable issue of fact within the issues delimited by the
pleadings.” (Juge v. County of Sacramento (1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 59, 67,
citing FPI Development, Inc. v. Nakashima (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 367,
381-382.)
 
As to each
cause of action as framed by the complaint, a defendant moving for summary
judgment or summary adjudication must satisfy the initial burden of proof by
presenting facts to show “that one or more elements of the cause of action ...
cannot be established, or that there is a complete defense to the cause of
action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2); see also Aguilar, supra,
25 Cal.4th at pp. 850-851; Scalf v. D. B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128
Cal.App.4th 1510, 1520.) Once the defendant has met that burden, the burden
shifts to the plaintiff to show that a “triable issue of one or more material
facts exists as to the cause of action or a defense thereto.” (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 437c, subd. (p)(2); see also Aguilar, supra, 25 Cal.4th at pp.
850-851.)
 
A plaintiff or
cross-complainant moving for summary judgment or summary adjudication must
satisfy the initial burden of proof by presenting facts to show “that there is
no defense to a cause of action if that party has proved each element of the
cause of action entitling the party to judgment on the cause of action.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(1).) Once the plaintiff or cross-complainant has
met that burden, the burden shift to the defendant or cross-defendant to show
that a “triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to the cause of
action or a defense thereto.” (Ibid.)
 
The party
opposing a motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication may not simply
“rely upon the allegations or denials of its pleadings” but must instead “set
forth the specific facts showing that a triable issue of material fact exists.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subds. (p)(1) & (p)(2). To establish a triable
issue of material fact, the party opposing the motion must produce substantial
responsive evidence. (Sangster v. Paetkau (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 151,
166.)
 
Courts
“liberally construe the evidence in support of the party opposing summary
judgment and resolve doubts concerning the evidence in favor of that party.” (Dore
v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc. (2006) 39 Cal.4th 384, 389.)
 
Evidentiary
Objections
 
Dignity asserts
17 objections to the declaration of Plaintiffs’ expert witness Sean Fischer,
M.D. 
 
Evidence
presented in support of, or in opposition to, a motion for summary judgment
must be admissible. (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (d); Perry v. Bakewell
Hawthorne LLC (2017) 2 Cal.5th 536, 541-43.) The court must “consider all
of the evidence set forth in the papers, except the evidence to which
objections have been made and sustained.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (c).)
 
The
Court OVERRULES Dignity’s objections.
 
Discussion
 
Dignity
moves for summary judgment on the grounds Dignity met the standard of care when
treating decedent Edith Bedigian (“Decedent”) and was not a substantial factor
in causing Decedent’s injuries. Plaintiffs bring a Professional Negligence –
Wrongful Death cause of action against Dignity.
 
Decedent fell
and suffered a left mid shaft displaced fracture on July 6, 2020. (Defendant’s
Statement of Undisputed Material Facts (“DSUMF”), No. 1.) Decedent was brought
to Dignity after her fall; Decedent
was transferred on July 13, 2020. (DSUMF, No. 9.) Decedent died on September 6,
2020, from cardiopulmonary arrest, chronic severe sepsis, and peripheral
arterial disease. (DSUMF, No. 13.) 
 
In a medical
negligence action, a plaintiff must establish the following elements: “(1) the
duty of the professional to use such skill, prudence, and diligence as other
members of [the] profession commonly possess and exercise; (2) a breach of that
duty; (3) a proximate causal connection between the negligent conduct and the
resulting injury; and (4) actual loss or damage resulting from the
professional’s negligence.” (Galvez v. Frields (2001) 88
Cal.App.4tha 1410, 1420; Simmons v. West Covina Medical Clinic (1989)
212 Cal.App.3d 696, 701-02.) “Both the standard of care and defendants’ breach
must normally be established by expert testimony in a medical malpractice
case.” (Avivi v. Centro Medico Urgente Medical Center (2008), 159
Cal.App.4th 463, 467.)
 
A medical
professional breaches the duty of professional care by failing to act in
accordance with the prevailing industry standard of care. (See Folk v.
Kilk (1975) 53 Cal.App.3d 176, 186.) “The standard of care against
which the acts of a physician are to be measured is a matter peculiarly within
the knowledge of experts; it presents the basic issue in a malpractice action
and can only be proved by their testimony …, unless the conduct required by the
particular circumstances is within the common knowledge of the layman.’” (Landeros
v. Flood (1976) 17 Cal.3d 399, 410.)
 
A defendant
moving for summary judgment in a medical malpractice action must “present
evidence that would preclude a reasonable trier of fact from finding that it
was more likely than not that their treatment fell below the standard of care.”
(Johnson v. Super. Ct. (2006) 143 Cal.App.4th 297, 305.) “When a
defendant moves for summary judgment and supports [the] motion with expert
declarations that [their] conduct fell within the community standard of care,
[the defendant] is entitled to summary judgment unless the plaintiff comes
forward with conflicting expert evidence.” (Munro v. Regents of University
of California (1989) 215 Cal.App.3d 977, 984-985.) An expert
declaration, if uncontradicted, is conclusive proof as to the prevailing
standard of care and the propriety of the particular conduct of the health care
provider. (Starr v. Mooslin (1971) 14 Cal.App.3d 988, 999.)
 
Here, Dignity
presents the declaration of Willis H. Wagner, M.D. (“Dr. Wagner”), who specializes
in the field of vascular surgery and has been board certified since 1987 in
general surgery and 1989 in vascular surgery. (Wagner Decl., ¶¶ 4-5.) Dr. Wagner
is familiar with the standard of care in the medical profession that applies to
physicians and non-physician staff within the community. (Id., ¶ 5.) 
 
Dr. Wagner has
reviewed Decedent’s medical records. (Id., ¶¶ 6-7.) Based upon that
review, Dr. Wagner opines that Dignity acted at all relevant times within the
standard of care related to its care and treatment of Decedent. (Id., ¶ 23.)
Dr. Wagner also opines that no action or inaction by Dignity caused or
contributed to the injuries of which Plaintiffs’ complaints. (Id., ¶ 29.)

 
Dr. Wagner’s
opinion testimony is “evidence which, if uncontradicted, would constitute a
preponderance of evidence that an essential element of the plaintiff’s case
cannot be established.” (Kids’ Universe v. In2Labs (2002) 95 Cal.App.4th
870, 879.) The expert opinion testimony of Dr. Wagner is evidence that Dignity
complied with its duties under California law and the standard of care for a
reasonably careful medical professional, nurses and non-physician staff, under
similar circumstances. 
 
With this
evidence, Dignity has satisfied the initial burden of showing that one or more
elements of the causes of action in the complaint cannot be established. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2).) This shifts the burden to Plaintiffs to
show that there is a triable issue of one or more material facts as to the
causes of action. (Ibid.) 
 
Plaintiffs filed
an opposition, along with the declaration of an expert witness, Sean Fischer,
M.D. (“Dr. Fischer”), who specializes in internal medicine, medical oncology,
and hematology. (Fischer Decl., ¶ 2.) Dr. Fischer has over 18 years in treating
individuals with blood-clotting disorders. (Fischer Decl., ¶ 5.) Dr. Fischer is
familiar with the standard of care in the medical profession that applies to managing
patients on anticoagulants in a hospital setting within the community. (Id.,
¶ 6.) 
 
Dr. Fischer
has reviewed Decedent’s medical records. (Id., ¶¶ 4, 10.) Based upon
that review, Dr. Fischer opines that Dignity fell below the standard of care in
two ways: (1) by discharging Decedent before her INR reach therapeutic range,
and (2) failing to provide the current anticoagulation dosage in Decedent’s
discharge instructions for subsequent providers. (Id., ¶ 13.) Dr. Fischer
also opines that the incorrect anticoagulated dosage was the cause of
Decedent’s blood clot, and that Dignity’s action of noting the incorrect dosage
was a substantial factor in Decedent’s death of which Plaintiffs’ complaints. (Id.,
¶¶ 17, 19.) 
 
Dignity
argues that the declaration of Dr. Fischer is improper as it is based on new
legal theories that were not properly pled. Dignity bases this argument on
Plaintiffs complaint and response to Special Interrogatories, Set One, No. 22. 
 
In the
complaint, Plaintiffs allege that Dignity fails to properly monitor care, and
provide treatment post-procedures/operations. In Special Interrogatories, Set
One, No. 22, Plaintiffs cite back to No. 20, and state that “[a]mong other
things, defendant improperly applied compression hose/compression devices to
decedent’s lower extremities.” As Plaintiffs refer to No. 20, the Court finds Plaintiffs
alleges that Dignity’s care and treatment of Decedent was negligent including
pre-procedure diagnosis, treatment and workup for procedure, post-procedure
care, and improper and/or premature discharge after surgery. These allegations
relate specifically to Dr. Fischer’s declaration.
 
The Court
finds this case is not similar to Lopez v. Baca (2002) 98 Cal.App.4th
1008, upon which Dignity relies. In Lopez, plaintiff asserted a new
theory under negligence per se in their opposition to summary judgment. Here,
in contrast, there is no new theory or cause of action: Plaintiffs allege in
the complaint and continue to prosecute an action for professional negligence
and contend that Dignity was negligent in its post-operation care of Decedent. The
expert declaration is offered in support of this properly pleaded cause of
action. 
 
The Court
finds Plaintiffs have met their burden, as the party opposing a motion for
summary judgment, of showing that there are disputed issues of material fact as
to whether Dignity did not meet the standard of care in its treatment of
Decedent and whether the alleged substandard of care caused, or was a
substantial factor in bringing about, Decedent’s death, including based on the
failure to provide the proper dosage of Decedent’s anticoagulation medication in
her discharge paperwork.
 
The Court expresses
no opinion as to whether the cause of action for negligence against Dignity is strong
or weak. On summary judgment, the Court does not weigh evidence or attempt to
predict the outcome at trial; rather, the Court’s role is limited to
determining whether there are triable issues of fact.
 
On this
record, the Court DENIES the motion for summary judgment filed by Dignity.
 
Conclusion
 
The
Court DENIES the motion for summary judgment filed by Dignity Community Care dba Northridge Hospital Medical Care.
 
Moving
Party is to give notice.
