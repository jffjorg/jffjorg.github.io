Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the plaintiff's motion for an order deeming the defendant to have admitted the truth of the matters specified in requests for admission. The plaintiff filed the motion because the defendant failed to serve timely responses to the requests for admission. However, the judge finds that the defendant did serve responses before the hearing, which were in substantial compliance with California Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.220. The judge also finds that the plaintiff has a complete remedy available under California Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.290 to compel a further response if the defendant's objections are without merit. The judge denies the plaintiff's request for sanctions because the defendant's failure to serve timely responses did not necessitate the filing of the motion.
