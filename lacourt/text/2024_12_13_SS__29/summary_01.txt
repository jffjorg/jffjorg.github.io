The judge will call the case to discuss two issues with counsel: (1) the application of the five-year rule to bring the case to trial, and (2) scheduling trial on a date that is convenient to all. The judge is prepared to continue the trial to a date after the summary judgment hearing date, which is currently set for June 20, 2025. The judge notes that the defendant has a right to have its summary judgment motion heard before trial and that the court has no summary judgment hearing dates available prior to the trial date. The judge orders the moving party to give notice.
