Defendant’s Motion to Specially Set Hearing on Motion for Summary Judgment
Tentative
The Court will call this matter. 
Background
On November 13, 2019, Eddie Streeter (“Plaintiff”) filed a
complaint against McCormick Ambulance, John Doe 1, and John Doe 2 for (1)
assault, (2) battery, (3) intentional infliction of emotional distress, (4)
negligence, and (5) negligent hiring, supervision, and retention causes of
action arising out of altercation outside of an emergency room on November 15,
2017.
On January 25, 2022, Default was entered against McCormick
Ambulance. A stipulation to set aside default was filed on May 24, 2023.
On January 27, 2023, WestMed Ambulance, Inc. dba McCormick
Ambulance (“Defendant”) filed its answer.
On April 12, 2023, Plaintiff added Erik Bell as Doe 1 and
Stephen Jones as Doe 2. On December 14, 2023, Erik Bell filed an answer. On
June 18, 2024, Stephen Jones filed an answer.
On October 16, 2024, Defendant filed its motion for summary
judgment set for June 20, 2025.
On November 8, 2024, Defendant filed its motion to continue
trial or in the alternative, to specially set the motion for summary judgment
hearing. Plaintiff filed an opposition on December 2, 2024. Defendant filed a
reply on December 6, 2024.
Legal Standard
Code of Civil Procedure section 128,
subdivision (a)(8), provides that the court has the power to amend and control
its process and orders so as to make them conform to law and justice. “The
power to determine when a continuance should be granted is within the
discretion of the trial court.” (Color-Vue, Inc. v. Abrams (1996) 44
Cal.App.4th 1599, 1603.) “A trial court has wide latitude in the matter of
calendar control including the granting or denying of continuances.” (Park
Motors, Inc. v. Cozens (1975) 49 Cal.App.3d 12, 18.)  
“A trial court may not refuse to hear a summary judgment
motion filed within the time limits of section 437c.” (Sentry Ins. Co. v.
Superior Court (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 526, 529; accord Cole v. Superior
Court (2022) 87 Cal.App.5th 84, 88.)
Discussion
Defendant requests the Court to specially set
the motion for summary judgment before the February 3, 2025 trial date.  Defendant filed the motion on October 16,
2024, and reserved the first available hearing date, which was in June
2025.  (Miretsky Decl., ¶ 11.)
Defendant has a right to have its summary
judgment motion heard before trial.  (Sentry Ins. Co., supra, 207
Cal.App.3d at p. 529.)  
The Court has no summary judgment hearing dates available
prior to the trial date.   
Accordingly, the Court is prepared to continue the trial to a
date after the summary judgment hearing date.
The Court will call this matter to discuss two issues with counsel:
(1) the application of the five-year rule to bring this case to trial (extended
by Emergency Rule 10); and (2) scheduling trial on a date that is convenient to
all.
Conclusion
The Court will call this matter.
Moving Party is ORDERED to give notice.
