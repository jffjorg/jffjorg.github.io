 Case Number:  23STCV13659    Hearing Date:   December 13, 2024    Dept:  29 Anderson v.
Haynes
23STCV13659
Motion to Deem the Truth of the Matters Asserted in Request for Admissions, Set
One.
Tentative
The motion is denied.
Background
On June 14, 2023, Howard Anderson (“Plaintiff”) filed a
complaint against Alana Haynes, Tamara Whitt, and Does 1 through 20, asserting
a single cause of action for negligence arising out of an automobile accident
occurring on October 20, 2021.
 
On September 8, 2023, the Court, at the request of
Plaintiff, dismissed all causes of action against Alana Haynes.
 
On April 29, 2024, Tamara Whitt filed an answer.
 
On August 12, 2024, Plaintiff amended the complaint to
name Jaylen Whitt as Doe 1.
 
On December 4, 2024, the Court granted (with leave to amend)
the motion filed by Defendant Jayle Whitt to strike the requests for punitive
damages and attorney’s fees from the prayer for relief in Plaintiff’s
complaint. 
 
As it relates to the matter on calendar for December 13,
2024, Defendant Tamara Whitt (“Defendant”) filed this motion on November 15, 2024, for an order deeming Plaintiff to have admitted the
truth of the matters specified in Request for Admissions (Set One).  Defendant also seeks sanctions.
 
Plaintiff filed an opposition on
November 27. No reply has been filed.
 
Legal Standard
A party must
respond to requests for admission within 30 days after service. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.250, subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests for admission are directed
does not provide a timely response, the propounding party “may move for an
order that … the truth of [the] matters specified in the requests be deemed
admitted.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).) There is no time
limit for such a motion, and no meet and confer efforts are required. (See id.,
§ 2033.280; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement
be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who fails to provide a
timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (a).) 
The court “shall”
make the order that the truth of the matters specified in the request be deemed
admitted unless the court “finds that the party to whom the requests for
admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a
proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial
compliance with Section 2033.220.”  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c); see St. Mary v. Super. Ct. (2014)
223 Cal.App.4th 762, 778-780.)
“It is mandatory
that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a
timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion [to deem
admitted the truth of the matters specified in the requests for admission].”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd.
(c).)
In Chapter 7 of
the Civil Discovery Act, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010, subdivision
(d), defines “[m]isuses of the discovery process” to include “[f]ailing to
respond to or to submit to an authorized method of discovery.”  Where a party or attorney has engaged in
misuse of the discovery process, the court may impose a monetary sanction in
the amount of “the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by
anyone as a result of that conduct.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (a).)
The late service of untimely discovery responses after
a discovery motion is filed “does not divest the trial court of its authority”
to hear the motion.  (Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc., supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at p. 407.)  This rule gives “an important incentive for
parties to respond to discovery in a timely fashion.”¿ (Id. at p. 408.)¿ If “the propounding party [does not] take the motion off
calendar,” the court retains the authority to impose sanctions.  (Id. at p. 409.) “The court may award
sanctions under the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to
compel discovery, even though no opposition to the motion was filed, or
opposition to the motion was withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided
to the moving party after the motion was filed.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1348(a).) 
Discussion
On July 22, 2024, Defendant served
Plaintiff with Request for Admissions, Set One. (Grandy Decl., ¶ 5 & Exh. B.)
On August 22, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel served responses that included both
objections and substantive responses, but no verification was provided.  (Id., ¶ 6 & Exh. C.) Defendant has
yet to receive any verifications. (Id., ¶ 13.) 
 
The motion for a deemed-admitted
order is denied.  Plaintiff timely served
responses that included both objections and substantive responses.  A verification was required.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.240, subd.
(a).)  No verification was provided.  
 
It is true, of course, that “[u]nsworn
responses are tantamount to no responses at all.” (Appleton v. Superior
Court (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 632, 636.) 
But here, however, Plaintiff also objected, and no verification is required
as to the objections.  Accordingly, the
Court finds that Plaintiff did serve a timely response.
 
The Court states no views on whether Plaintiff’s
objections are meritorious.  If they are,
then Defendant is not entitled to a response. 
If not, then Defendant has a complete remedy available under Code of
Civil Procedure section 2033.290 – which authorizes a propounding party to obtain
an order compelling a further response when (among other reasons) the
responding party has asserted objections that are “without merit” or “too
general.”  But where, as here, a response
has been served, Defendant’s remedy must be through a motion to compel a
further response, not a motion for a deemed-admitted order under section 2033.2
80.
 
Defendant’s request for sanctions is also
denied.  Sanctions are mandatory when the
failure to serve a timely response “necessitated” the motion for a
deemed-admitted order.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)  Here, Plaintiff served a timely response, one
that was received well before this motion was filed.  Under these circumstances, the Court does not
find that the filing of the motion for a deemed-admitted order was “necessitated”
by Defendant’s assertedly inadequate (but timely) responses.
 
Conclusion
 
The Court DENIES Defendant’s motion. 
 
Moving party is ORDERED to give
notice.
