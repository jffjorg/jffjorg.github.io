 Case Number:  22STCV19688    Hearing Date:   December 13, 2024    Dept:  29 Odaibo v. City
of Los Angeles
22STCV19688
Plaintiff’s Motion for Order Deeming Defendant to Have Admitted the Truth of
the Matters Specified in Requests for Admission (Set Two).
Tentative
The motion is denied.
Background
On June 16, 2022, Kemisi Odaibo (“Plaintiff”)
filed a complaint against City of Los Angeles (“Defendant”) and Does 1 through
50 for motor vehicle negligence and general negligence arising out of an
automobile accident occurring on March 21, 2022. 
On September 20, 2023, Defendant filed an
answer.
On February 28, 2024, Plaintiff amended the
complaint to name Giovani Santamaria Ortega (“Ortega”) as Doe 1. 
On July 7, 2024, Ortega filed an answer.
On November 12, 2024, Plaintiff filed
this motion for an order deeming Defendant to have admitted the truth of the matters
specified in Plaintiff’s Requests for Admission (Set Two).  Plaintiff also seeks sanctions.
 
Defendant filed an opposition on December
2.  (This was untimely, but the Court
exercises its discretion to consider the late-filed opposition.)  Plaintiff filed a reply on December 6.
 
Legal Standard
A party must
respond to requests for admission within 30 days after service. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.250, subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests for admission are directed
does not provide a timely response, the propounding party “may move for an
order that … the truth of [the] matters specified in the requests be deemed
admitted.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).) There is no time
limit for such a motion, and no meet and confer efforts are required. (See id.,
§ 2033.280; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement
be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who fails to provide a
timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (a).) 
The court “shall”
make the order that the truth of the matters specified in the request be deemed
admitted unless the court “finds that the party to whom the requests for
admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a
proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial
compliance with Section 2033.220.”  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c); see St. Mary v. Super. Ct. (2014)
223 Cal.App.4th 762, 778-780.)
“It is mandatory
that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a
timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion [to deem
admitted the truth of the matters specified in the requests for admission].”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd.
(c).)
In Chapter 7 of
the Civil Discovery Act, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010, subdivision
(d), defines “[m]isuses of the discovery process” to include “[f]ailing to
respond to or to submit to an authorized method of discovery.”  Where a party or attorney has engaged in
misuse of the discovery process, the court may impose a monetary sanction in
the amount of “the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by
anyone as a result of that conduct.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (a).)
The late service
of untimely discovery responses after a discovery motion is filed “does not
divest the trial court of its authority” to hear the motion.  (Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc.,
supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at p. 407.)  This
rule gives “an important incentive for parties to respond to discovery in a
timely fashion.”¿ (Id. at p. 408.)¿ If
“the propounding party [does not]
take the motion off calendar,” the court retains the authority to impose
sanctions.  (Id. at p. 409.) “The
court may award sanctions under the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files
a motion to compel discovery, even though no opposition to the motion was
filed, or opposition to the motion was withdrawn, or the requested discovery
was provided to the moving party after the motion was filed.” (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1348(a).) 
Discussion
On February 8, 2024, Plaintiff served
Defendant with Request for Admissions Set Two. (Ostoia Decl., ¶ 6 & Exh. 1.)
Plaintiff’s counsel states that as of the date that the motion was filed, no
response had been received.  (Id., ¶ 9.)
 
Defendant did, however, serve
objection-only responses to the Requests for Admission on November 5, 2024,
shortly before this motion was filed.  (Barron
Decl., ¶ 7 & Exh. B.)
 
The Court finds that Defendant has
served responses, prior to the hearing, that are in substantial compliance with
Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.220. 
If, as appears to be the case, Defendant has improperly asserted waived
objections, Plaintiff has a complete remedy available under Code of Civil Procedure
section 2033.290 – which authorizes a propounding party to obtain an order
compelling a further response when (among other reasons) the responding party
has asserted objections that are “without merit.”
 
The Court recognizes that Defendant’s
responses were not verified, but an objection-only response need not be
verified.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.240,
subd. (a).)
 
Plaintiff’s request for sanctions is also
denied.  Sanctions are mandatory when the
failure to serve a timely response “necessitated” the motion for a
deemed-admitted order.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)  Defendant did not serve timely responses, but
it did serve responses before Plaintiff filed this motion.  Under these circumstances, the Court does not
find that the filing of the motion was “necessitated” by Defendant’s failure to
serve a timely response.
 
Conclusion
 
The Court DENIES Plaintiff’s motion.
 
Moving party is ORDERED to give
notice.
