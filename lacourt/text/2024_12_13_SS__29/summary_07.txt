And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied the motion of JNJ Investments, LLC to set aside the default judgment. The defendant had argued that it did not receive actual notice of the action in a timely manner, but the court found that the evidence presented did not support this claim. The court also noted that the defendant failed to submit a copy of the answer it proposed to file with the motion. As a result, the court denied the defendant's request for relief under Code of Civil Procedure sections 473.5, 473, subdivision (b), and 473, subdivision (d). The court ordered the plaintiff to give notice of the ruling.
