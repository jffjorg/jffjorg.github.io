And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel the deposition of Defendant Sooferi. The motion is denied without prejudice because the Plaintiff failed to comply with the statutory requirements for taking a deposition. The Plaintiff is seeking to take the deposition of Defendant Sooferi, but the Plaintiff has not submitted a declaration stating that they have contacted the deponent to inquire about the nonappearance, as required by the California Code of Civil Procedure. The Judge notes that the deposition notice appears to have been timely served and that the asserted failure of Plaintiff to appear for deposition is not a valid objection to a deposition notice served by Plaintiff. The Judge also denies Defendant Sooferi's request for sanctions, finding that the Plaintiff acted with substantial justification in bringing the motion.
