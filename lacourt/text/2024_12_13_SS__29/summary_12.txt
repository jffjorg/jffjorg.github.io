And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Defendant Tamara Whitt's motion to deem the truth of the matters asserted in Request for Admissions, Set One. The motion was filed on November 15, 2024, and seeks to deem Plaintiff Howard Anderson's responses to the requests for admission as true. The judge found that Plaintiff served timely responses, although they did not include verification as required by the Code of Civil Procedure. The judge noted that Plaintiff's objections to the requests for admission were sufficient to excuse the lack of verification. The judge also denied Defendant's request for sanctions, finding that the failure to serve a timely response did not necessitate the filing of the motion.
