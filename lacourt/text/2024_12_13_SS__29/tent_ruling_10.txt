 Case Number:  22STCV33581    Hearing Date:   December 13, 2024    Dept:  29 Duclos v. Elie
22STCV33581
Petition for Approval of Minor’s Compromise for Claimant Semiyra Duclos (Age 5).
Tentative: 
 
The Court
excuses the personal appearance of the claimant and the guardian ad litem.
Counsel may appear by telephone or video conference call.  
 
The Court has
reviewed the Petition for Approval of Minor’s Compromise and proposed order
filed on November 15, 2024. The Court has also reviewed the amended petition
and proposed order filed on December 6, 2024. 
The Court finds several issues that must be addressed before the Court
can approve the petition.
 
First, Item 10a
and 10b in the Amended Petition appear to list the global settlement
amount.  The correct entries for these items
is the amount to be paid to claimant alone.
 
Second, Item 11b(1)
in the Amended Petition appears to list the global settlement amount.  The correct entry for this item is the total
amount to be paid to others (excluding claimant).
 
Third, Item 10
of the Amended Proposed Order is blank. 
This appears to be an omission.
 
Accordingly, the Court CONTINUES the hearing re Petition
for Approval of Minor’s Compromise for Semiyra Duclos (Age 5) to __/__/2025 at 01:30 P.M. in Department 29 at Spring Street
Courthouse.Moving party to give notice.
