And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the motion to be relieved as counsel filed by Jeffrey L. Fayngor, Esq. and Suraj Teppara, Esq. on behalf of the plaintiff. The motion was filed less than 16 court days before the scheduled hearing date, which is considered improper service. The court notes that the requisite forms were not properly served on the client and all other parties who have appeared in the case. As a result, the motion is denied without prejudice. The court orders the moving counsel to give notice.
