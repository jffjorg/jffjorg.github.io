Tentative
Motion is DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.
Background
On November 15, 2023, Victoria Gomez Salas
and Monica Nunez (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Gabriela Jasmin
Angeles-Rojas and Ana Giron Angeles (collectively “Defendants”) for motor
vehicle negligence cause of action arising out of an automobile accident
occurring on December 13, 2021.
On November 7, 2024, Victoria Gomez Salas was
dismissed from this action. 
Defendants have yet to appear in this matter.
On November 21,
2024, Jeffrey L. Fayngor, Esq. and Suraj Teppara,
Esq. (“Counsel”) filed this motion to be relieved as counsel. No
opposition has been filed.
 
Legal
Standard
The court may order that an attorney be changed or
substituted at any time before or after judgment or final determination upon
request by either client or attorney and after notice from one to the other.
(Code of Civ. Proc., § 284(b).) An attorney is permitted to withdraw where
conflicts between the attorney and client make it unreasonable to continue the
representation. (See Cal. Rules of Prof. Conduct 3-700(C)(1).) “The
determination whether to grant or deny a motion to withdraw as counsel lies
within the sound discretion of the trial court.” (Manfredi & Levine v.
Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128, 1133.)   
 
An application to be relieved as counsel must be made on
Judicial Counsel Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion) (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1362(a)), MC-052 (Declaration) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.136(c)), and MC-053 (Proposed Order) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362(e)).   
 
Further, the requisite forms must be served on the client
and all other parties who have appeared in the case. (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.1362(d).) The court may delay effective date of the order relieving
counsel until proof of service of a copy of the signed order on the client has
been filed with the court. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(e).) 
 
Discussion
 
Counsel has
filed the Notice to be Relieved as Counsel on November 21, less than 16 court
days before the December 13 hearing. The motion must have been filed and served
on November 19 to be timely for personal service, or served on November 14 for mail
service. 
Accordingly, the
motion is DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE due to improper service. 
Conclusion
The motion to be
relieved as counsel is DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.
Moving counsel
to give notice.
