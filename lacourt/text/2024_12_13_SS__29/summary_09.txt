And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendants' motion to dismiss the case without prejudice. The motion was filed because the plaintiff has failed to prosecute the case, and it appears that the plaintiff may have abandoned the case. However, the judge is unable to grant the motion due to a procedural issue regarding service of the motion to the plaintiff. The judge has received inconsistent information about the plaintiff's address, and the judge is unable to be certain that the motion was properly served on the plaintiff. As a result, the judge has denied the motion without prejudice, meaning that the defendants may refile the motion and serve it on the plaintiff at both potential addresses.
