And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion to dismiss the cross-complaint without prejudice. The motion was filed by the plaintiffs, Ryan Canning and Patricia Bogarin, who argued that the cross-complaint should be dismissed for failure to prosecute. However, the judge found that the plaintiffs failed to provide sufficient authority to support their claim. The judge also noted that the cross-complainant, Shawn Kerwin, had filed for bankruptcy and that the action was stayed as a result. However, the bankruptcy was discharged on May 22, 2024, and the stay was lifted, allowing Kerwin to proceed with his cross-complaint. The judge concluded that the motion to dismiss was denied without prejudice, and the moving party is required to give notice.
