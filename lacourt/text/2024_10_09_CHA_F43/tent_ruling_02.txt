RELIEF
REQUESTED
Attorneys for Defendant
are requesting to be relieved as counsel.
 
RULING: Motion
to be relieved as counsel is granted
 
Nannina L.
Angioni and Sarah A. Swanson of Kaedian LLP, counsel of record for Defendant PDQ
Pickup, LLC, seek to be relieved as counsel for that party.¿Counsel filed a
motion with the required Forms MC-051, MC-052, and MC-053. Counsel’s
declaration states that there has been a breakdown in the attorney client
relationship and that Defendant’s counsel are no longer able to work with and
communicate with their client on this case and that the client has refused to
pay invoices or communicate with its attorneys. The client has also not
provided any contact information for any other representatives besides Jacob A.
Sanchez.
 
Absent a
showing of resulting prejudice, an attorney’s request for withdrawal should be
granted.¿(People v. Prince¿(1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398, 406.)¿There is no
showing of prejudice, and counsel’s motion complies with California Rules of
Court, Rule 3.1362 and meets its requirements.
 
However, the
Court will note that corporations may not represent themselves. (Merco
Constr. Engineers, Inc. v. Municipal Court (1978) 21 Cal.3d 724.) Defendant
PDQ Pickup, LLC, should immediately find new counsel if it has not already done
so.
 
Motion to be
relieved as counsel is granted.
