And here is the English summary:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to strike portions of the Second Amended Complaint. The plaintiff, Denise R. Birtch, alleges that she owns a property and has brought causes of action for breach of contract, fraud, unfair business practices, quiet title, and declaratory relief. The defendants, Specialized Loan Servicing, LLC and Gulf Harbour Investments Corp, have moved to strike the portions of the complaint that seek punitive damages. The court has granted the motion to strike punitive damages because the plaintiff has failed to plead specific facts to support an award of punitive damages. The court has also granted the motion to strike the fourth cause of action for quiet title, which was included in violation of a previous court order. The parties are ordered to give notice of the tentative ruling, unless waived.
