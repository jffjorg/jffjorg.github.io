And here is a summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion by the plaintiff to have matters in requests for admissions deemed admitted. The motion is denied as moot because the defendant served responses prior to the hearing. However, the plaintiff's request for sanctions is granted. The defendant and their counsel are ordered to pay $510 in monetary sanctions within 30 days. The judge finds that the defendant's failure to respond to the requests for admissions was a misuse of the discovery process, and sanctions are mandatory in this situation. The judge denies the defendant's request for sanctions under CCP sections 2023.030 for alleged misuse of discovery.
