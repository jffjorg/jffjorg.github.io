RESPONDING PARTY: Plaintiff
 
The Court has considered the moving, opposition and reply papers. 
 
BACKGROUND
This action arises
out of a landlord/tenant relationship. 
On June 2, 2022, Plaintiff filed a complaint (the “Complaint”) alleging:
(1) breach of the implied warranty of habitability; (2) breach of the implied
covenant of quiet enjoyment; (3) violation of statutory duty (failure to return
security deposit); (4) unfair trade and business practices; (5) nuisance; (6)
constructive eviction; (7) violation of Civil Code section 1942.3; and (8)
breach of statutory duty under Civil Code section 1950.5. 
 
In relevant part,
the Complaint alleges: Or about August 3, 2020, Plaintiff entered into a
written lease agreement (the “Lease Agreement”) with Moving Defendant to rent a
guest house (the “Unit”) on property (the “Property”) owned by Moving
Defendant.  (Complaint ¶ 8.)  During her tenancy, Plaintiff experienced multiple
issues with the Unit, including lack of heat, electrical shorting and circuit
breakers popping.  (Complaint ¶ 9.)  In addition, Moving Defendant refused to give
Plaintiff a key to allow her to access her Unit from the street.  (Id.) 
On or around November 12, 2021, Plaintiff reported code violations to
the Department of Building and Safety (“LADBS”) and on or about November 25,
2021, LADBS issued a Notice of Code Violation (the “Notice”) identifying
various violations of the Los Angeles Municipal Code.  (See Complaint ¶¶ 9-10, Exhibit
A.)  After Moving Defendant failed to
address the Notice, on or about January 20, 2022, LADBS sent an Order to Comply
(the “Order”).  (Complaint ¶ 11, Exhibit
B.)  Moving Defendant failed to comply with
the Order.  (See Complaint ¶ 11.)  Moving Defendant continued to collect rent
from Plaintiff despite the Property’s code violations and habitability
issues.  (See Complaint ¶
22.)  Additionally, Moving Defendant did
not reimburse Plaintiff for repairs she made to the Unit after his repeated
failure to make repairs.  (See Complaint
¶ 20.)  The conditions at the Unit caused
Plaintiff to move out on or about November 20, 2021.  (Complaint ¶ 23.)  
 
 
On November 7, 2023, Moving Defendant filed a motion for summary
judgment (the “Motion”) on the grounds that the undisputed facts demonstrate
that Plaintiff’s claims are barred by res judicata.[1]
 
REQUEST FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE
            Moving
Defendant’s Request for Judicial Notice is GRANTED as to the existence of the
documents, but not to the truth of the matters stated therein.  (Dominguez v. Bonta (2022) 87
Cal.App.5th 389, 400.)
 
EVIDENTIARY OBJECTIONS
            Plaintiff’s
evidentiary objections numbers 1-9 and 12-29 are OVERRULED.  Plaintiff’s objections numbers 10-11 are
SUSTAINED. 
 
DISCUSSION
The function of a motion for summary
judgment or adjudication is to allow a determination as to whether an opposing
party cannot show evidentiary support for a pleading or claim and to enable an
order of summary dismissal without the need for trial.  (Aguilar
v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.)  California Code of Civil Procedure
(“CCP”) section 437c, subdivision (c) requires the trial judge to grant
summary judgment if all the evidence submitted, and all inferences reasonably
deducible from the evidence and uncontradicted by other inferences or evidence,
show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving
party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  (Adler
v. Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.)
 
As to each claim as framed by the
complaint, the defendant moving for summary judgment must satisfy the initial
burden of proof by presenting facts to negate an essential element, or to
establish a defense.  (CCP § 437c, subd.
(p)(2); Scalf v. D. B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005)
128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1520.)  Once the
defendant has met that burden, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show that
a triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to that cause of action
or a defense thereto.  To establish a triable
issue of material fact, the party opposing the motion must produce substantial
responsive evidence.  (Sangster v. Paetkau (1998) 68
Cal.App.4th 151, 166.)  Courts liberally
construe the evidence in support of the party opposing summary judgment and
resolve doubts concerning the evidence in favor of that party.  (Dore
v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc. (2006) 39 Cal.4th 384, 389.)
 
Moving Defendant’s Evidence
Moving Defendant presents evidence that on
February 7, 2022, Plaintiff filed a small claims lawsuit (the “Small Claims
Action”) against Moving Defendant. 
(Separate Statement of Undisputed Material Facts (“UMF”) 4.)  In the complaint in the Small Claims Action,
Plaintiff alleged: “[Moving Defendant] was my landlord.  He had me as his renter in an illegal
unit.  I have photos and a letter from
the city that this was not legal.  I also
made improvements to [Moving Defendant’s] property.  [Moving Defendant] has a $6,000 security
deposit from me that he is refusing to return. 
I have had to spend many hours on this and find new housing.  He is breaking his contract and illegally
withholding my $6,000.”  (See Declaration of John Fu (“Fu Decl.”) ¶ 6, Exhibit A.)  In the Small Claims Action’s complaint,
Plaintiff sought $10,000 in damages based on a $6,000 unrepaid security deposit
and $4,000 in “relocation fees and travel and time spent.”  (See Declaration of John Fu (“Fu
Decl.”) ¶ 6, Exhibit A.)  On March
16, 2022, the court in the Small Claims Action issued a judgment in Plaintiff’s
favor.  (See Fu Decl. ¶ 10,
Exhibit E.)  On March 23, 2022, Moving
Defendant filed a request for a trial de novo in the Small Claims Action.  (Fu Decl. ¶ 11, Exhibit F.)  At the appeal for the Small Claims action on
May 3, 2022, Plaintiff moved to have the action dismissed, which was granted by
the court.  (See Fu Decl. ¶ 5,
Exhibit G.)  
 
Applicability of Res Judicata to Plaintiff’s Claims
Res judicata, or
claim preclusion, prevents relitigation of the same cause of action in a second
suit between the same parties.  (Mycogen Corp. v. Monsanto Co. (2002)
28 Cal.4th 888, 896.)  Res judicata precludes
piecemeal litigation by splitting a single cause of action or relitigation of
the same cause of action on a different theory or for different relief.  (Weikel
v. TCW Realty Fund II Holding Co. (1997) 55 Cal.App.4th 1234, 1245.) 
For res judicata purposes, the central inquiry is not whether identical causes
of action were litigated, but whether a party had the opportunity to litigate
the causes of action.  (See id.)  Two proceedings are on the
same cause of action if they are based on the same “primary right.”  (Federation
of Hillside & Canyon Assns. v. City of Los Angeles (2004) 126
Cal.App.4th 1180, 1202.)  For the doctrine of res judicata to apply to a subsequent
action, the decision in the prior proceeding must have been final and on the
merits.  (Id.)  It is the
nature of the action and character of the judgment that determines whether it
is res judicata.  (Association of Irritated Residents v. Department of
Conservation (2017) 11 Cal.App.5th 1202, 1220.)  Where a complaint is
dismissed on procedural or technical grounds and the substance of the
underlying claim was never tried or determined the doctrine of res judicata
does not apply because there was no judgment on the merits.  (Id.)  
 
The doctrine of
res judicata generally precludes parties, or parties in privity with them, from
relitigating a cause of action determined with finality in a prior
proceeding.  (See, e.g., Smith v.
ExxonMobil Oil Corp. (2007) 153 Cal.App.4th 1407, 1413-14; Wright v. Ripley (1998) 65 Cal.App.4th
1189, 1193.)  The doctrine has two
aspects: it applies to both a previously litigated cause of action, referred to
as claim preclusion, and to an issue
necessarily decided in a prior action, referred to as issue preclusion.  (Vandenberg v. Superior Court (1999) 21
Cal.4th 815, 828; Teitelbaum Furs, Inc.
v. Dominion Ins. Co. (1962) 58 Cal.2d 601, 604.)  
 
Issue preclusion
applies only to issues that were actually litigated in the earlier matter;
whereas claim preclusion extends to all legal theories, proofs, and demands for
relief that might have been presented in the first matter, provided both suits
assert the same cause of action.  (Ferraro v. Camarlinghi (2008) 161
Cal.App.4th 509, 541 n. 21.)  Res
judicata (claim preclusion) bars the relitigation not only of claims that were
conclusively determined in the first action, but also matter that was within the
scope of the action, related to the subject matter, and relevant to the issues
so that it could have been raised and includes matters which were raised or
could have been raised, on matters litigated or litigable.  (Burdette
v. Carrier Corp. (2008) 158 Cal.App.4th 1668, 1674-75; accord Mark v. Spencer (2008) 166 Cal.App.4th 219, 229 (noting that res
judicata bars claims that parties had fair opportunities to litigate).)  Claim preclusion therefore applies as a bar
to splitting a cause of action for partial, later litigation, or relitigation
of the same cause of action based upon on another legal theory or associated
with different relief, that could have been sought in the prior action.  (Noble
v. Draper (2008) 160 Cal.App.4th 1, 10.)  The prerequisite elements for determining
whether a claim or issue is precluded are the same: (1) a claim or issue raised
in the present action is identical to a claim or issue litigated in a prior
proceeding; (2) the prior proceeding resulted in a final judgment on the merits;
and (3) the party against whom the doctrine is being asserted was a party or in
privity with a party to the prior proceeding. 
(Vandenberg v. Superior Court
(1999) 21 Cal.4th 815, 829.)
 
            Moving Defendant argues
that the claims in the Complaint are barred by res judicata because the Small
Claims Action was improperly dismissed upon appeal and the underlying judgment
remains valid pursuant to Acuna v. Gunderson Chevrolet, Inc. (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th
1467, 1473-74.)
 
            Strictly construing
Moving Defendant’s evidence, the Court finds that the Motion fails to establish
that Plaintiff’s claims are barred.  Without
deciding the issue of whether the judgment in the Small Claims Action was
improperly dismissed, the Court finds that the Motion insufficiently
demonstrates that the entirety of the claims asserted in the Complaint are
within the scope of the issues and claims raised in the Small Claims Action
itself.  While the eighth clause of
action alleged in the Complaint for unreturned security deposit mirrors the claim
for damages asserted in the Small Claims Action, the evidence of the
proceedings in the Small Claims Action does not demonstrate which other claims
and issues that arose during Plaintiff’s tenancy were actually litigated and
decided.  (See Rosse v. DeSoto Cab Co.
(1995) 34 Cal.App.4th 1047, 1052-53.) 
Because the Motion only requests summary judgment without alternatively
requesting summary adjudication the presence of any triable issues of material
fact defeats the entire Motion.  (See
Homestead Savings v. Superior Court (1986) 179 Cal.App.3d 494, 498.)  
 
            The Court therefore
DENIES the Motion.   
 
Moving party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
 
Parties who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to
the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed by the instructions provided on
the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive
an email and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed
off calendar.
