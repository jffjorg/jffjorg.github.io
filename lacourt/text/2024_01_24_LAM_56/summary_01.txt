And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has considered the motions to compel responses filed by the defendants and the opposition and reply papers submitted by the plaintiff. The defendants (91 Enterprise, LLC, Asher Elimelech, and Gilad Erlich) moved to compel the plaintiff's responses to form interrogatories, set one (FROGS). The plaintiff's counsel requested multiple extensions to submit the responses, which were granted by the defendants' counsel until September 8, 2023. However, the plaintiff's counsel became ill and was unable to work, resulting in the responses being served after the deadline.

The court finds that the plaintiff has provided verified responses to the discovery requests at issue in the motions. The court therefore denies the motions. Additionally, the court declines to impose monetary sanctions due to the circumstances that caused the plaintiff's responses to be served past the deadline.
