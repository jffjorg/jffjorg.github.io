  CASE NO.: 21STCV27498
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER RE: MOTIONS TO COMPEL RESPONSES
 
Date: 
  January 24, 2024
Time: 8:30 a.m.
Dept. 56



 
MOVING
PARTIES: Defendants 91 Enterprise, LLC; Asher Elimelech; and Gilad Erlich
(collectively, “Moving Defendants”)
 
RESPONDING
PARTY: Plaintiff
 
The
Court has considered the moving, opposition and reply papers.
 
BACKGROUND
This
action arises out of an employment relationship.  The currently operative first amended
complaint (the “FAC”) alleges: (1) failure to pay minimum wage; (2) failure to
pay overtime compensation; (3) failure to pay wages for missed rest periods;
(4) failure to pay wages when due; (5) failure to provide accurate and itemized
wage statements; and (6) violation of the Unfair Competition Law.  
 
On
September 18, 2023, Moving Defendants each filed a motion to compel Plaintiff’s
responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One (“FROGS”) (collectively, the
“Motions”).[1]
 
DISCUSSION
Under
California Code of Civil Procedure (“CCP”) section 2030.290, subdivision
(b), when a party directs interrogatories towards a party and that party fails
to serve a timely response, the party propounding the interrogatories may move
for an order compelling response to the interrogatories.  (CCP § 2030.290,
subd. (b).)  The moving party need only show that the interrogatories were
served on the opposing party, the time has expired to respond to the
interrogatories, and no responses have been served in order for the
court to compel the opposing party to respond.  (Leach v. Superior
Court (1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 902, 906.) 

 
Moving
Defendants provide evidence that they propounded the FROGS on July 31,
2023.  (Declaration of Benjamin Davidson
(“Davidson Decl.”) ¶ 3, Exhibit 1.)[2]  On September 1, 2023, the date responses were
due, Plaintiff’s counsel requested that the deadline be extended through
September 6, 2023, which Moving Defendants confirmed.  (See Davidson Decl. ¶¶ 5-8,
Exhibit 2.)  On September 6, 2023, Moving
Defendants also confirmed Plaintiff’s counsel’s request to further extend the
deadline to submit responses until September 8, 2023 due to illness.  (See Davidson Decl. ¶ 9, Exhibit
2.)  At the end of the business day on
September 8, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel sent an email stating that she tested
positive for the COVID-19 virus and requested an extension through September
12, 2023.  (See Davidson Decl. ¶¶
11-13, Exhibit 4.)  Moving Defendants’
counsel responded and informed Plaintiff’s counsel that a third extension would
not be granted.  (See id.)
 
In
support of the opposition (the “Opposition”), Plaintiff provides evidence that
Plaintiff’s counsel went to the emergency room to obtain medical care for her
illness on September 10, 2023, and was too sick to work on September 12 through
September 13, 2023.  (Declaration of
Charmaine L. Huntting ("Huntting Decl.") ¶¶ 4, 6.)  Plaintiff provided responses to the FROGs on December
7, 2023.  (Huntting Decl.) ¶ 11, Exhibit
4.)  
 
It
is undisputed that Plaintiff has provided Moving Defendants with verified
responses to the discovery requests at issue in the Motions.  To the extent that the parties dispute the
sufficiency of Plaintiff’s responses, the proper procedures are to file a
motion for relief from waiver and/or a motion to compel further responses.  The Court therefore DENIES the Motions.  In light of the circumstances that caused
Plaintiff’s responses to be served past the deadline, the Court also declines
to impose monetary sanctions. 
 
 
 Moving party is ordered to give notice of this
ruling.
 
 
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at
SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed by the instructions provided on the court
website at www.lacourt.org.  If the
department does not receive an email and there are no appearances at the
hearing, the motion will be placed off calendar.
