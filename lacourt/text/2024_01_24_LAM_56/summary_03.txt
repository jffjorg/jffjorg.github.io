Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the motion for summary judgment filed by the defendant, Hossein Asili, and has denied the motion. The defendant argued that the plaintiff's claims are barred by res judicata because the plaintiff had previously filed a small claims lawsuit against the defendant and the judgment was not properly dismissed. However, the court finds that the evidence submitted does not demonstrate that the entirety of the claims asserted in the complaint are within the scope of the issues and claims raised in the small claims action. Therefore, the court denies the motion for summary judgment and orders the defendant to give notice of this ruling.
