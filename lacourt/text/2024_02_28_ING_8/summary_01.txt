Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by the County of Los Angeles to the Third Amended Complaint (TAC). The County demurred to the TAC on the grounds that the causes of action against it fail to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.

The judge has sustained the demurrer as to the Sixth, Seventh, and Fifth causes of action against the County. The Sixth cause of action alleges Mandatory Duty pursuant to Government Code § 815.6, and the judge has ruled that the County is not liable for injury caused by the failure to make an arrest or by the failure to retain an arrested person in custody. The Seventh cause of action alleges Mandatory Duty Premises Liability, and the judge has ruled that the County is not liable for the alleged failure to prevent and suppress affrays, breaches of the peace, riots, and insurrections. The Fifth cause of action alleges Loss of Consortium, and the judge has ruled that the County is not liable for the alleged failure to investigate and retain Daniel Luna in custody.

The judge has also ruled that the County is not liable for the alleged failure to perform its mandatory duty under Penal Code § 647(g) to place Daniel Luna in civil protective custody. The judge has noted that the allegations alleged are almost the exact same as those alleged in the case of Stout v. City of Porterville, which held that the police officer's failure to take a "public inebriate" into custody did not create a mandatory duty.

The judge is inclined to sustain the demurrer without leave to amend, which means that the Plaintiffs will not be allowed to re-file the causes of action that were sustained.
