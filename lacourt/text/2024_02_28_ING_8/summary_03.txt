And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has continued the hearing on the motion to compel further responses to discovery requests to March 21, 2024. The court has granted in part the motion to compel further responses to RFPs 16, 20, and 21, ordering General Motors to produce its Warranty Policy and Procedures Manual for California sold or leased motor vehicles for the year in which the plaintiff made a demand or request for buy-back. The court has denied RFP No. 19, finding it to be overly broad and vague. The court has granted RFPs 45-46, but only as to the agreed-upon discovery by General Motors pursuant to the protective order. The court has ordered General Motors to supplement its written responses to the requests by providing Code-compliant, verified responses that identify which documents respond to which request, and to provide the documents subject to the protective order. The court has also ordered the parties to meet and confer to narrow the scope of the discovery requests and to agree on the definitions, geographic restrictions, and other aspects of the requested categories.
