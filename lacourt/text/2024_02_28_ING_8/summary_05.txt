Summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in favor of the Defendants, Karmic Energy, Inc. and Caroline Londergan, in their motion for attorneys' fees. The Court found that the Plaintiff, Rocco A. Mondello, individually, and as trustee of the 2002 Mondello Family Trust, failed to properly serve the 3-day notice, which resulted in the Plaintiff's failure to prove an essential element of the unlawful detainer trial. The Court awarded the Defendants $40,707 in attorneys' fees, after reducing the initial request of $46,150 and adjusting the hours claimed for discovery and motions. The Court also denied attorney's fees for the arguably frivolous demurrer filed by the Defendants.
