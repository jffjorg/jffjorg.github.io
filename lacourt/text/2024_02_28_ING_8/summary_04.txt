Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled on a motion to compel further responses to requests for production of documents. The parties have sufficiently met and conferred in good faith, but the judge notes that the discovery requests are overly broad and burdensome. The judge sets forth basic parameters for what it typically orders with respect to certain of the discovery requests, including the production of documents related to the subject vehicle's purchase and lease, repair orders and invoices, communications between the plaintiff and the manufacturer, and warranty claims. The judge also notes that the definition of "Electrical Defect" is overly broad and vague, and that the parties must meet and confer to resolve issues related to the scope of discovery. The judge continues the hearing to March 20, 2024, and orders the plaintiff to submit an amended separate statement by March 13, 2024.
