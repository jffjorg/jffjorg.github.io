Summary:

The judge's tentative ruling is in response to a demurrer filed by defendants Xavier Flores and Dana Jenkins, and an ex parte application filed by plaintiff Milagros Gibson. The demurrer argues that the Complaint does not state a claim because it is barred by the statute of limitations. The judge finds that the Complaint is timely and that the statute of limitations was tolled due to a clerical mistake by the clerk's office. The judge overrules the demurrer and orders the defendants to answer within 20 days.
