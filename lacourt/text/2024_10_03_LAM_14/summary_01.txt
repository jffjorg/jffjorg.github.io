And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied the Plaintiff's motion for reconsideration of the August 12, 2024 order granting the Defendant's motion to compel the Plaintiff's medical examination. The Plaintiff had argued that the Defendant had obstructed discovery and made material misrepresentations to the Court to induce the order, but the Judge found that the exhibits attached to the motion did not contain new evidence and that the information would not have changed the outcome of the motion. The Judge also found that the Defendant's representations about her sexual partners and the Western Blot Test were not misrepresentations and that the Plaintiff's medical condition is still in controversy, justifying the medical examination. The Judge concluded that the motion for reconsideration was not justified and denied it.
