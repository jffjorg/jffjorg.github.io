```

And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling denies the plaintiff's motion to conduct limited discovery in support of their opposition to the defendants' anti-SLAPP motion. The court finds that the plaintiff has not shown good cause for conducting limited discovery, as the discovery sought is too broad and may not be necessary to adequately defeat the defendants' motion. The court notes that the plaintiff's allegations appear sufficient to survive the defendants' anti-SLAPP motion, and therefore, the court does not need to allow additional discovery.
