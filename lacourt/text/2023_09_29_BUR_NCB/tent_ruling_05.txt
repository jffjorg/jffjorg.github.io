 [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
motions to be relieved as counsel
 



 
Defense counsel, Jared A. Barry, Esq. and
Barry Law Group (“Counsel”), moves to be relieved as counsel for Defendants Nico
“Nick” Halekakis and Megan Lorick Halekakis (“Defendants”).  
Counsel filed two motions to be relieved
as counsel on August 22, 2023.  Counsel
has filed the requisite MC-051 and MC-052 forms pursuant to CRC Rule
3.1362.  However, Counsel has not lodged MC-053
proposed order forms with the moving papers. 
According to the declaration of Counsel,
Counsel seeks to be relieved as counsel because there has been a total and
complete breakdown of the attorney-client relationship and breakdown in
communication.  Counsel also states that
there is a conflict of interest.  (MC-052,
§2.)  For these reasons, Counsel seeks to
withdraw from representing Defendants in this action.  
Counsel personally served Defendants.  Plaintiff’s counsel was also served with the
motions by mail. 
As for future hearing dates, the Final
Status Conference is set for December 6, 2023 and the Jury Trial is set for December
11, 2023.  
Accordingly, the motions to be relieved as
counsel are granted.  Counsel is ordered
to electronically lodge the MC-053 proposed order forms for the Court’s
signing.  Upon their receipt and
confirmation that the proposed orders have been properly filled out, the Court
will sign the orders.  The orders will
become effective upon the filing of proofs of service of a signed copy of the
order on each of the Defendants.  
Counsel and the parties are ordered to
attend the September 29, 2023 hearing. 
The Court will discuss with the parties whether a trial continuance may
be necessary.  
Notice to be provided by Counsel.
