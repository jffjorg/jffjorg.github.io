## English Summary

This tentative ruling deals with a motion filed by the Defendants in a case involving allegations of fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, and negligence. 

The Defendants are seeking attorney's fees and costs based on the Plaintiff's failure to admit certain facts in the Requests for Admissions (RFAs) that were later proven at trial. The Judge acknowledges the Defendants' entitlement to some fees and costs but finds the current request overly broad, encompassing all fees incurred after the RFAs denial, not just those related to proving the disputed facts.

The Judge has continued the hearing to allow the Defendants to provide a more detailed breakdown of the costs and fees specifically related to proving the RFAs at trial.
