The Court grants the motion and orders counsel to lodge MC-053 proposed order forms. The orders will become effective upon the filing of proofs of service of a signed copy of the order on each of the defendants. The Court will discuss with the parties whether a trial continuance may be necessary at the upcoming hearing on September 29, 2023.
