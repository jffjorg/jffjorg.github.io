## English Summary

The judge has tentatively ruled against the defendant, Imperial Care Center, on two motions. 

First, the defendant had challenged the plaintiffs' claim under the Unfair Competition Law (UCL), arguing that it didn't apply to healthcare. The judge disagreed, finding that the plaintiffs' allegations of misrepresentation and inadequate care by the nursing home were sufficiently distinct from pure regulatory violations to allow the UCL claim to proceed.

Second, the defendant had asked to strike the plaintiffs' request for treble damages under a separate law that allows for increased penalties in cases of unfair or deceptive practices against senior citizens. The judge denied this motion as well, stating that the issue of whether treble damages are appropriate could be addressed later during the trial.

Essentially, the judge has allowed the plaintiffs' case to move forward with all of their claims intact, including the potential for treble damages.

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Joseph Daniel Burt as trustee of the trust of Barbara A. Burt, et al. v. ICC Convalescent Corp. dba Imperial Care Center. The case involves allegations of elder abuse and neglect by Defendant against Decedent, who was admitted to Defendant's facility in February 2021. The Plaintiffs allege that Defendant failed to provide adequate care and neglected Decedent, resulting in harm and damages.

Defendant filed a demurrer to the 4th cause of action, which alleges unfair competition, and a motion to strike certain allegations. The Court overruled the demurrer, finding that the allegations of unfair competition are viable and not preempted by regulatory matters under the Department of Health Services.

The Court also denied Defendant's motion to strike the allegations for treble damages under Civil Code, § 3345. The Court found that the allegations of unfair competition and fraudulent conduct by Defendant support the claim for treble damages, and that the issue of double recovery can be addressed through jury instructions at trial.

The Court ordered Defendant to answer the complaint within 10 days and set the matter for further hearing.

The Judge orders Defendant to answer within 10 days of this order.
