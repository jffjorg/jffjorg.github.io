Summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is regarding a case between Joseph Daniel Burt as trustee of the Trust of Barbara A. Burt, et al. and ICC Convalescent Corp. dba Imperial Care Center. The case involves allegations of elder abuse and neglect against the Defendant, who failed to provide adequate care to Barbara Ann Burt, a resident at the facility. The Defendant filed a demurrer and motion to strike certain allegations in the complaint. The Court has overruled the demurrer to the 4th cause of action, which alleges unfair competition, and denied the motion to strike. The Court has allowed the allegations for treble damages, which permits the Plaintiff to seek triple the amount of damages if they are successful in their claim. The case will proceed to trial, where the Court will determine the validity of the Plaintiff's claims and the amount of damages, if any, to be awarded.
