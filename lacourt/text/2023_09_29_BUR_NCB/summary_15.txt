And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by National One Mortgage Corporation and Lee Akin Jr. to the complaint filed by Barron De Sanctis, Hrag Julian Karlubian, and Powdered Jelly Donut Investments, LLC.

The judge sustains the demurrer to the 2nd to 9th causes of action, including fraud, negligent misrepresentation, and breach of fiduciary duty, due to the lack of specific facts alleging how National One and Akin breached their duties to the plaintiffs. The judge also sustains the demurrer to the 7th and 8th causes of action, including negligence and breach of fiduciary duty, due to the lack of specific facts alleging how National One and Akin breached their duties to the plaintiffs.

The judge overrules the demurrer to the 5th and 6th causes of action, including intentional and negligent interference with prospective economic advantage, as the allegations of the complaint, taken as true, allege that the plaintiffs were in an economic relationship with Airbnb and its guests.

The judge grants the parties 20 days to amend their pleadings and orders that the defendants provide notice of this order.
