The court will consider the merits of the defendants' ex parte application to vacate the stipulation at the hearing. The plaintiff, 4000 Burbank, LLC, is seeking to enter judgment for $300,538.83, which is the remaining balance of the past-due rent. The defendants, Elani Kinoshita and Chad Tadashi Kinoshita, have failed to make payments according to the terms of the stipulation, and the court finds that there is substantive merit to granting the motion.
