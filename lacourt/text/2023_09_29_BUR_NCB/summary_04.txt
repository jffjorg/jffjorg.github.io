And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to unseal the court records in a case involving an unlawful detainer action. The case was originally filed as an unlawful detainer action, but was later converted to a general civil action. The plaintiff, Dana Ingram, is seeking to unseal the entire court record, citing the presumption that court records are open to the public unless confidentiality is required by law. The judge has reviewed the case and has found that there is no overriding interest that requires the records to remain sealed. The judge has granted the motion to unseal the records, and has ordered that the case shall no longer be designated as a confidential case. The plaintiff is required to provide notice of the order.
