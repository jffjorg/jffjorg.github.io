Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The court has reviewed the motion for protective order and sanctions filed by Plaintiff Mayra Aguayo against Defendant Dr. Marc Y. Waki and Dr. Vahe Nakashyan. The court finds that the 109 Special Interrogatories (SROGs) propounded by Dr. Waki are excessive in number and may be duplicative and harassing. Therefore, the court grants the motion in part and denies it in part. Plaintiff is ordered to respond to a total of 50 SROGs, including the first 35 SROGs already responded to and 15 additional SROGs that Dr. Waki may choose or re-draft. Dr. Waki is ordered to re-propound these 15 SROGs on Plaintiff. The court declines to award sanctions to either party. Plaintiff shall provide notice of this order.
