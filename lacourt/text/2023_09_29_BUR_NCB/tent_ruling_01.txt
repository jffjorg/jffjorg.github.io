Case No.:  19BBCV01099
 
Hearing Date:  September 29, 2023
 
  [TENTATIVE] order RE:
motion to enter
  judgment pursuant to stipulation 
 



 
BACKGROUND
A.    Allegations
and Background 
Plaintiff 4000 Burbank, LLC commenced this unlawful detainer action
against Defendants Elani Kinoshita and Chad Tadashi Kinoshita on December 10,
2019.  The property at issue is located
at 4002-4004 West Burbank Blvd., Burbank, CA 91505.  Plaintiff is the landlord of the
property.  Plaintiff alleges that its
agent entered into a written agreement with the Kinoshitas on January 30, 2019
for a fixed term expiring January 31, 2024 with monthly rent of $13,700.  Plaintiff alleges that it served a 3-day
notice to pay rent or quit on November 14, 2019.  Plaintiff seeks possession of the premises,
past-due rent of $30,055, forfeiture of the agreement, reasonable attorney’s
fees, and damages of $456.67 per day from December 1, 2019 through the entry of
judgment. 
On December 31, 2019, Elani Kinoshita filed an answer to the complaint.

On January 7, 2020, the default of Chad Tadashi Kinoshita was
entered.  
On January 8, 2020, the default of All Unknown Occupants was entered. 
On January 27, 2020, Plaintiff’s counsel represented to the Court that
the case had settled.  The Court set an
OSC re: Dismissal, which was continued several times.  
On January 28, 2020, Plaintiff filed a Notice of Lodgment of Stipulation.  
On September 23, 2021, Plaintiff filed the Stipulation to Modify
Stipulated Judgment.  
On October 19, 2021, pursuant to the oral request of Plaintiff’s
counsel, the complaint was dismissed without prejudice.  The Court also stated that it would retain
jurisdiction to make orders to enforce any and all settlement terms, including
judgment, pursuant to CCP § 664.6. 
B.     Motion
on Calendar 
On September 8, 2023, Plaintiff filed an ex parte application to enter
judgment pursuant to the Stipulation.  On
September 8, 2023, Defendants filed an opposition brief.  On September 11, 2023, the ex parte came for
hearing.  The Court shortened the time to
hear the motion to enforce the judgment. 
Plaintiff’s ex parte papers were deemed the moving papers.   The Court ordered any opposition brief to be
filed by September 20, 2023 and any reply brief to be filed by September 27,
2023.            On
September 20, 2023, Defendants filed an opposition brief to the motion.  The Court will consider the September 20,
2023 opposition brief as the operative opposition brief (as opposed to the
September 8, 2023 opposition brief.) 
On September 20, 2023, Defendants also filed a document entitled “EX
PARTE NOTICE OF MOTION AND MOTION TO VACATE STIPULATION,” with a hearing date
of September 29, 2023. 
DISCUSSION RE EX PARTE APPLICATION TO VACATE
THE STIPULATION
            Defendants filed an ex
parte application/motion to vacate the stipulation, arguing that the August 28,
2023 Stipulation is improper based on the City of Burbank Community
Development’s Notice of Violation of Substandard Conditions issued on June 22,
2022.  Defendants argue that the City
cited the property for an unpermitted construction lack of commercial rental
business tax registration certificate, a zoning violation, and violation of
various code sections.  They argue that
they were not aware of the violations and that Plaintiff was in material
breach, rendering the Stipulation void and unenforceable.  
Elani Kinoshita states in her declaration
that she became aware of the need for relief from the stipulation on September
7, 2023.  (Kinoshita Decl., ¶3.)  Defendants argue that the stipulation should
be vacated pursuant to CCP § 473 based on fraud.  
At this time, the Court is not in receipt of
a proof of service of Defendants’ ex parte application papers.  Thus, the Court cannot ascertain whether
Plaintiff was served with this motion. 
(The Court notes that Plaintiff has not filed an opposition to the ex
parte application prior to the hearing date.) 

In addition, Defendants have not complied
with the requirements to bring an ex parte application. CRC Rule 3.1204 provides that an ex parte
application must state with specificity the nature of the relief requested and
the date, time, and place for the application; and attempt to determine whether
the opposing party will oppose the application. 
(CRC Rule 3.1204(a).)  The ex
parte application must be accompanied by a declaration regarding notice stating
that notice was given, the applicant in good faith attempted to inform the
opposing party but was unable to do so, or for reasons specified the applicant
should not be required to inform the opposing party.  (CRC Rule 3.1204(b).) 
The Court will determine at the hearing whether proper notice of this
ex parte application was given to Plaintiff at the September 29, 2023 hearing
and whether the application should be continued to allow Plaintiff to file a
written opposition.  
DISCUSSION RE MOTION TO ENTER
JUDGMNET 
A.   
Evidentiary
Objections 
            With
the opposition brief, Defendants submitted evidentiary objections to the
declarations of counsel Jason Stillman, Ken Fisher, and the ex parte
motion.  The objections are overruled in
their entirety. 
B.    
Terms
of the Stipulation 
The Stipulation for Entry of
Judgment (“Stipulation”) is attached as Exhibit 1 to the moving papers. The Stipulation
provides in relevant part: 
·        
For settlement purposes, Plaintiff
(landlord) and the Kinoshitas (tenants) agree that the sum of $50,000
represents the sums due from tenants through January 31, 2020.  (Stipulation, ¶4.)
·        
Tenants shall pay the $50,000 as follows:
$10,570 on January 27, 2020; $10,000 on February 17, 2020; $10,000 on March 16,
2020; $10,000 on April 16, 2020; and $9,430 on May 15, 2020.  (Id.,
¶5.)  
·        
Tenants agree to pay the rent and
additional rent pursuant to the lease on February 5, 2020, March 5, 2020, April
5, 2020, and May 5, 2020.  (Id., ¶6.)  
·        
If all payments were made, the case will
be dismissed within 10 business days of the last payment required pursuant to
paragraphs 5 and 6. (Id., ¶8.) 
·        
If Tenants fail to pay any of the
payments, then upon 48-hour telephonic notice to their counsel, Plaintiff shall
make ex parte application for entry of judgment for possession of the premises,
forfeiture of the lease, and the then-due and owing sums required to be made in
paragraphs 5-6.  (Id., ¶9.)  
·        
The Stipulation does not affect the
Tenants’ future obligations under the lease. 
(Id., ¶10.) 
Plaintiff (through
its authorized agent), the Kinoshitas, Plaintiff’s counsel, and Defendants’
counsel signed the Stipulation on January 26 and 27, 2020.  (Stipulation at p.2.)   
            On November 30, 2020,
the parties entered the Stipulated Agreement Conditions, which modified the
January 2020 Stipulation.  (Stillman
Decl., Ex. 2.)  It states in relevant
part: 
The
Defendants ELANI KINOSHITA and CHAD TADASHI KINOSHITA hereby acknowledge
and agree that their collective past due balance of rent and additional rent
under their lease as of the end of September 2020 is $136,822.00. In order for
ELANI KINOSHITA and CHAD T ADASHJ KINOSHITA to pay the past due balance of
$136,822.00, the Defendants agree to make payments towards this past due
amount, in addition to the regularly monthly scheduled rent, including but not
limited to any additional rent as called in the Lease agreement. The parties
have agreed to the following payment schedule: 
-
All current rent payments as called for in the Lease agreement shall be made
timely no later than the fifth of each month commencing on October 1, 2020.
-
A minimum of $3,000.00 shall be paid on or by the 20th of each month, in addition
to each month's current rent, commencing October 20, 2020 through and including
March 20, 2021.
-
A minimum of 6,000.00 shall be paid on or by the 20th of each month, in addition
to each month's current rent commencing April 20, 2021 through and including
September 20, 2021.
-
A minimum of $9,000.00 shall be paid on or by the 20th of each month, in addition
to each month's current rent commencing October 20, 2021 until the remaining
balance of past due rent in the amount of $136,822.00 rent is paid in full.
(Stipulated
Agreement Conditions at p.1.)  
On September 23, 2021, the Stipulation to
Modify Stipulated Judgment (“Modified Stipulation”) was filed, which is
attached as Exhibit 3 to the
moving papers.  The Modified Stipulation
stated: 
1.
The Defendants ELANI KINOSHITA and CHAD TADASHI KINOSHITA hereby agree that
their collective past due balance of rent and additional rent under their lease
through August 2021 is $161,177.68. 
2.
Defendants shall pay the following sums on the following dates: 
-
All current rent payments shall be made timely on the fifth of each month
commencing September I, 2021. 
-
A minimum of $3,000.00 shall be paid on or before the 20th of each month, in
addition to each month's rent, commencing September 20, 2021, through and
including February 20, 2022;
-
A minimum of $6,000.00 shall be paid on or before the 20th of each month, in
addition to each month's rent, commencing on March 20, 2022, through and
including August 20, 2022; 
-
A minimum of $9,000.00 shall be paid on or before the 20th of each month, in
addition to each month's rent, commencing on September 20, 2022, until the
remaining balance of the past due amount of $161,177.68 is paid in full.
3.
The Parties agree that in the event any of the payments set forth above are not
made, Plaintiff may enforce the Stipulated Judgment already filed and entered
in this case. 
4.
Parties agree that acceptance of any payments shall not constitute the creation
or reinstatement of tenancy. 
5.
The Parties agree pursuant to C.C.P. § 664.6, that the court shall retain
jurisdiction to enforce this settlement agreement until the performance in full
of the terms of the agreement.
(Modified
Stipulation at p.2.)  The parties signed
the Modified Stipulation on August 30, 2021. 
The Court signed the order on September 23, 2021.  
            Finally, on August 24
and 28, 2023, the parties signed the Stipulation to Money Stipulated
Judgment.  (Stillman Decl., Ex. 4.)  It modified the September 23, 2021 Modified
Stipulation.  It states in relevant part:

1. The Defendants
ELANI KINOSHITA and CHAD TADASHI KINOSHITA hereby acknowledge and agree that
their collective past due balance of rent and additional rent under their lease
as of the end of October 2023 is $300,538.83.
2. In order for ELANI
KINOSHITA and CHAD TADASHI KINOSHITA to pay the past due balance of
$300,538.83. the Defendants agree to make payments on the following payment
schedule:
- $100,000.00 by
September 4, 2023;
- $100,000.00 by
September 29, 2023;
- $100,538.83 by
October 27, 2023;
- Thereafter regular
rent shall be due as called for in the Lease Agreement.
3. The Parties agree
that in the event any of the payments set forth above are not made, Plaintiff may
execute on the Stipulated Judgment already filed and entered in this case.
4. Any Default may
result in additional late, interest, or default fees being applied.
5. This Stipulation
may be Executed in Counterparts.
6. Facsimile
Signatures shall have the same effect as originals.
7. Parties agree that
acceptance of any payments shall not constitute the creation or reinstatement of
tenancy.
8. The parties shall
appear at an ex parte hearing to have the modified terms of this stipulation entered.
9. The Parties agree
pursuant to C.C.P. § 664.6, that the court shall retain jurisdiction to enforce
this settlement agreement until the performance in full of the terms of the
agreement.
(Stipulation to Money
Stipulated Judgment at p.2.)   
C.    
Merits of the Motion to enter judgment pursuant to the
Stipulation
Plaintiff moves for entry of judgment pursuant to the Stipulation to Money Stipulated Judgment,
signed by the parties on August 28, 2023.  In support of the motion, Plaintiff
provides the declaration of Kenneth Fisher, who is the property manager for Plaintiff.  
Mr. Fisher states that pursuant to the Stipulation, the parties agreed
that the past due balance was $300,538.83, which was to be paid down through 3
payments.  (Fisher Decl., ¶¶5-6.)  He states that Defendants failed to make the
first payment due September 4, 2023.  (Id.,
¶6.)  He states that the remaining
balance is still $300,538.83 and includes a rental ledger as Exhibit 5.  (Id., ¶7.)  Thus, Mr. Fisher states that due to
Defendants’ default on the terms of the agreement, Plaintiff is requesting that
the Court enter judgment for immediate possession and money judgment for
$300,538.85 per the terms of the Stipulation. 
(Id., ¶8.)  
In opposition, Defendants argue that on June 22, 2022, the City of
Burbank Community Development sent a Notice of Violation – Substandard
Conditions regarding the property, which they were not aware of during the
tenancy or at the time of the entering the Stipulation (and modifications).  (Opp. at Ex. A.)  Thus, they argue that Plaintiff was in
material breach, rendering the Stipulations void.  Defendants also argue that the settlement
agreement is not valid as the parties did not agree to all the material terms
and it was not signed by all the parties and does not comply with CCP § 664.6.
While Defendants argue that not all material terms were agreed upon by
the parties at the time of signing, Defendants have not shown what terms in the
Stipulation (and modifications thereafter) Defendants did not agree to.  It appears that Defendants take issue with
the June 22, 2022, the City of Burbank Community Development sent a Notice of
Violation and the issues stated in the noticed violation.  However, at the time of singing the January
2020 Stipulation, the November 30, 2020 Stipulated Agreement Conditions, and September 23, 2021 Stipulation to
Modify Stipulated Judgment (signed by the parties on August 30, 2021 and
entered by the Court on September 23, 2021) the June 22, 2022 Notice of
Violation had not yet existed, such that Plaintiff could not have committed
fraud on the terms of the Notice.  Thus,
the fact that terms considering a Notice of Violation could not have been
contemplated by the parties at the time of the three prior iterations of the
Stipulation since the Notice of Violation did not exist at that time.  Further, by the time of the August 28, 2023,
Stipulation to Money Stipulated Judgment, Defendants were aware of the June 22,
2022 Notice of Violation; yet, they signed the Stipulation to Money Stipulated
Judgment knowingly.  
Defendants also argue that the settlement agreement is not binding
because it was not signed by all parties, fails to comply with CCP § 664.6, and
the Court is deprived of jurisdiction after dismissal.  However, based on the Court’s review of the
Stipulation and modifications, the documents are each signed by Plaintiff and
each of the Defendants.  Further, as
noted above, on October 19, 2021, the Court agreed to retain jurisdiction
pursuant to CCP § 664.6 to make orders to enforce any and all settlement terms, including judgment.  Thus, Plaintiff properly requested that the
Court retain jurisdiction of this matter after dismissal.  
Based on the latest iteration of the Stipulation to Money Stipulated
Judgment, Plaintiff may seek the execution of the Stipulated Judgment for
$300,538.83 upon Defendants’ default.  As
established by Plaintiff and undisputed by Defendants, Defendants failed to
make payment pursuant to the terms of the Stipulation and, therefore, have
defaulted.  As such, there is substantive
merit to granting this motion and the Court will grant the motion.  
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
The Court will consider the merits of Defendants’ ex parte application
to vacate the Stipulation at the hearing. Based on the application papers, it
does not appear that Plaintiff was served with the application papers and that
the requirements under CRC Rule 3.1204 were properly complied with. 
Plaintiff 4000 Burbank, LLC’s motion to enter judgment pursuant to the
Stipulation is granted. 
Plaintiff shall give notice of this order.
