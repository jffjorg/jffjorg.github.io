[TENTATIVE] order RE:
motion to be relieved as counsel



 
Defense counsel, Taylor F. Williams-Moniz
of Donahoe Young & Williams LLP (“Counsel”), moves to be relieved as
counsel for Defendant John Scott Germann (“Defendant”).  
Counsel filed the amended motion to be
relieved as counsel on September 8, 2023.  
The Court notes that on September 15,
2023, it signed and entered the MC-053 form regarding the Order Granting
Attorney’s Motion to be Relieved as Counsel – Civil in favor of Counsel and
against Defendant.  As such, Counsel has
already been relieved as counsel for Defendant. 
In light of the order already signed, this amended motion is duplicative
and will be taken off-calendar. 
The motion to be relieved as counsel filed
on September 8, 2023 is taken off-calendar as moot in light of the Court’s
September 15, 2023 order granting Counsel’s motion to be relieved as
counsel.  Notice to be provided by
Counsel.
