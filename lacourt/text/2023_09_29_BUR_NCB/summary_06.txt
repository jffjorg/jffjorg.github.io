And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the defense counsel's motion to be relieved as counsel for the defendant, John Scott Germann. The motion was filed on September 8, 2023, and an amended motion was filed on the same date. However, the court notes that it had already signed an order granting the motion on September 15, 2023. Therefore, the amended motion is deemed duplicative and will be taken off-calendar. The original motion is also considered moot in light of the court's previous order. The court orders that notice of this decision be provided by the defense counsel.
