And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling addresses the issues of whether a lease agreement existed between PLI and Crown Equipment Corporation, whether an inspection of the property occurred, and whether the inspection was "reasonable". The Court notes that there is a triable issue of material fact regarding these issues based on the deposition testimony of Mr. Hilger, who does not know who the parties to the alleged lease agreement were and has not seen a copy of the lease agreement himself. The Court also notes that the joinder papers submitted by Hartford only include a brief statement and no additional arguments or evidence. The case will proceed to a future Court hearing to resolve these issues.
