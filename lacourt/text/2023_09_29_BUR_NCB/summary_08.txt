The Judge's tentative ruling addresses the issues of whether a lease agreement existed between PLI and Crown Equipment Corporation, whether an inspection of the property occurred, and whether the inspection was "reasonable". The Court notes that there is a triable issue of material fact regarding these issues based on the deposition testimony of Mr. Hilger, who does not know who the parties to the alleged lease agreement were and has not seen a copy of the lease agreement himself. The Court also notes that the joinder papers submitted by Hartford only include a brief statement and no additional arguments or evidence. The case will proceed to a future Court hearing to resolve these issues.

## English Summary

The judge is considering a motion related to a case involving 2000 Gold and Tang suing Crown Equipment Corporation. The core issue is whether a lease agreement existed for a building, as well as the circumstances surrounding any inspection of the property. 

There's conflicting information: 2000 Gold and Tang argue no written lease was present, while Mr. Hilger, in a deposition, believes there was a lease but doesn't know the parties involved or have seen a copy. The judge notes there are factual disputes that need to be resolved at trial.

Additionally, another party, Hartford, has joined the case, but their joinder is brief and lacks detailed arguments. 


The judge will ultimately decide on the motion based on the presented evidence and legal arguments.
