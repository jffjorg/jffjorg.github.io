[TENTATIVE] ORder RE: 
motion for order awarding costs of proof (CCP §
  2033.420)
 
 
 



 
BACKGROUND 
A.   
Allegations 
Plaintiff Robin Kim (“Plaintiff” or “Kim”),
as sole trustee of the McIntosh Trust (“Trust” or “MT”), commenced this action
against Defendants Yonatan Rabin and Liat Rabin and the company they owned and
operated, Defendant Sapphire Development & Construction, Inc. (“SDC”).[1]  Plaintiff alleges that the Trust owns real
property located at 926 Hilldale Ave., West Hollywood, CA 90069.  In 2016, the Trust, through its trustor Betty
Jo Kim McIntosh and trustee Plaintiff, pursued the prospect of developing the
property into residences for purposes of maximizing its value and ultimately
selling the residences.  The Trust alleged
that it engaged the Rabins, SDC, and Defendant Joseph Bernstein to handle all
aspects of the project.  Plaintiff alleged
that Defendants preyed on the Trust’s confidence in them and misrepresented
their qualifications to perform the work. 
 
The complaint, filed July 17, 2020,
alleges causes of action for: (1) intentional misrepresentation/fraudulent
inducement; (2) breach of fiduciary duty; (3) negligence; (4) unfair competition;
(5) unjust enrichment; and (6) accounting. 
B.    
Relevant Background
The matter went to trial on July 5, 2023. Just
prior to the empanelment of the jury, Plaintiff Kim dismissed the 5th
cause of action for unjust enrichment with prejudice. The 1st
(fraud) and 3rd (negligence) causes of action were tried to the
jury, while the Court considered the 4th (unfair competition) and 6th
(accounting) causes of action based upon the evidence presented. The Court
dismissed the fraud cause of action against Liat Rabin at the close of
Plaintiff’s case. 
On July 19, 2023, the jury returned a
defense verdict on the 1st and 3rd causes of action as
against all Defendants. The Court stated that based on the findings of the
jury, with which the Court concurred, there was no basis upon which to grant
relief under the 4th and 6th causes of action, and that judgement
should therefore be entered for the defense. Judgment was entered on July 31,
2023. 
On August 3, 2023, the Court issued a
Statement of Decision regarding the 6th cause of action for accounting.

the amount of $52,175 (less costs included but awarded as costs to Defendants
as the prevailing parties).  
On September 18, 2023, Plaintiff filed an
opposition brief. 
On September 21, 2023, Defendants filed a
reply brief. 
LEGAL
STANDARD
CCP § 2033.420
states: 
(a) If a party
fails to admit the genuineness of any document or the truth of any matter when
requested to do so under this chapter, and if the party requesting that
admission thereafter proves the genuineness of that document or the truth of
that matter, the party requesting the admission
may move the court for an order requiring the party to whom the
request was directed to pay the reasonable expenses incurred in making that
proof, including reasonable attorney's fees.
(b) The court shall make this order unless it
finds any of the following:
(1)
An objection to the request was sustained or a response to it was waived under
Section 2033.290.
(2)
The admission sought was of no substantial importance.
(3)
The party failing to make the admission had reasonable ground to believe that
that party would prevail on the matter.
(4) There was other good reason for the failure to
admit.
(CCP § 2033.420.) 

“One need not be a
prevailing party to be entitled to sanctions under this statute.”  (Smith v. Circle P Ranch Co. (1978)
87 Cal.App.3d 267, 274–275.) 
“[W]here it becomes clear from evidence introduced by either
party at trial that the party who denied for lack of information or belief had
access to the information at the time requests for admissions were propounded,
sanctions are justified because that party has a duty to
investigate ….”  (Bloxham
v. Saldinger (2014) 228 Cal.App.4th 729, 752.)  “[S]ince
requests for admissions are not limited to matters within personal knowledge of the responding party, that party has a duty to make a
reasonable investigation of the facts before answering items which do not fall
within his personal knowledge.”  (Id. at 751-52.) 
DISCUSSION
            Defendants move for fees and costs
against Plaintiff pursuant to CCP § 2033.420, arguing that they requested that
Plaintiff admit certain facts in the Requests for Admissions (“RFA”), but
Plaintiff failed to admit them.  
            The Court notes that in the
opposition brief, Plaintiff only disputes the reasonableness of fees, but does
not dispute that Defendants are entitled to fees and costs for his failure to
admit certain RFAs.  
            The Court has reviewed the motion,
opposition, and reply papers.  The fees
sought by Defendants appear to include all fees incurred by defense counsel
after the date of the denials of the RFAs without any apportionment for the
time and effort to prove these specific matters at trial.  Motions pursuant to CCP § 2033.420 should be
limited to fees that would compensate the “reasonable expenses incurred in
making that proof, including reasonable attorney's fees”—not for all fees
incurred after the denials of the RFAs were received.  
            Thus, the hearing on the motion will
be continued so that Defendants may provide a supplemental declaration of
counsel regarding the costs and fees of appearance at trial only.  Further details should be provided by defense
counsel regarding the time spent at trial to prove the RFAs that were denied by
Plaintiff at the time of discovery. Likewise, Defendants should provide a
supplement as to what costs are contained in this motion that were not included
in its bill of costs. Defendants should clarify why these costs were not
previously recoverable, yet are apparently believed to be recoverable now. 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
Defendants’ motion
for attorney’s fees and costs is continued to October 27, 2023 at 8:30
a.m.  Defendants are ordered to file and
serve a supplemental declaration of counsel by October 16, 2023.  Plaintiff may file and serve a responsive
supplemental declaration, if necessary, by October 20, 2023.  No further briefing may be permitted.  
Defendants shall provide notice of this
order.
