[1] The named
defendant is Crown Equipment Corporation (see caption in complaint and
paragraph 8), but the complaint refers to Crown Equipment Company in the
allegations (see paragraphs 23-24 in the complaint). 


[2] Hartford’s
joinder papers only include a 2-page joinder with no additional arguments or
separate statement.  


[3] In his
deposition, Mr. Hilger states that he believes and knows there was a lease
agreement for the building, but does not know who the parties to the agreement
were and had not seen a copy of the lease agreement himself.  (Hilger Depo. at pp.22-23.)  in reply, 2000 Gold and Tang argue that there
was no written lease agreement with PLI and that PLI was responsible for
undertaking all maintenance and management of the subject property.  There is a triable issue of material fact
regarding whether a lease agreement existed, whether an inspection of the
property occurred at the time of the lease, and whether the inspection was
“reasonable.”  


[4] At most, the
Court has Mr. Hilger’s deposition testimony. 
He testified that the loading dock is an outdoor elevated loading dock,
which is surrounded by the building premises on one side and surrounding by
rails and a ramp down to the parking lot level on the other side.  He states there is a roof over the top. He
states that the loading dock area has room for 2 trucks to back up and that the
loading dock is approximately 4 feet off the parking lot.  (Hilger Depo. at p.14.)
