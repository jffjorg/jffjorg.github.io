And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying BMW of North America, LLC's motion to compel arbitration and stay the action. The motion was filed on April 27, 2023, and is set to be heard on September 29, 2023. The judge previously denied a similar motion filed by BMWNA on June 26, 2023, and has decided to deny this second motion as well. The judge notes that the parties may review the written order issued on September 8, 2023, which details the reasoning behind the denial of the motion. The judge also notes that the motion appears to be a reiteration of the same arguments made in the previous motion, and therefore will not reconsider the denial of the motion.
