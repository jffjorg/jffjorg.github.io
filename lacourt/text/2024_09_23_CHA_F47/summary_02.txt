And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the motion filed by Petitioner/Plaintiff Kevork Antablian, compelling Respondent/Defendant State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company to serve further responses to certain document requests. The requests for which further responses are required are Request Nos. 7, 10, 11, 13, and 14, served on 8/4/23. The judge finds that State Farm's responses to these requests are deficient in that they are incomplete, evasive, and/or include improper and/or meritless objections.

The judge also finds that Petitioner is entitled to an award of sanctions against State Farm for its failure to comply with its discovery obligations. However, the judge reduces the amount of sanctions requested, imposing sanctions in the amount of $1,685.00 instead of the requested $3,310.00.

The judge orders that further responses are due and sanctions are payable within 30 days.
