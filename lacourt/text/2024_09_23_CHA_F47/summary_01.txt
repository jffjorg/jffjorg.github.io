And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is granting the motion to compel, which was filed by Right Choice In-Home Care, Inc. (Right Choice) against Keolis Transit America, Inc. (Keolis). Right Choice had requested that Keolis provide responses, without objection, to its Request for Production of Documents, Set 1. Keolis failed to provide timely responses, despite agreements to do so by certain dates. The judge finds that Right Choice is entitled to an order compelling Keolis to provide responses and is also entitled to sanctions against Keolis for its failure to comply with its discovery obligations. However, the judge reduces the amount of sanctions requested by Right Choice from $2,445.00 to $1,120.00. The motion is granted, and Keolis is ordered to provide responses and pay sanctions within 30 days.
