SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises out of a motor vehicle collision that
occurred on 1/5/21 involving a vehicle (the Vehicle) driven by Petitioner/Plaintiff
Kevork Antablian (Petitioner) and owned by Richard Patterson.  At the time of the incident, the Vehicle was
insured through Respondent/Defendant State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance
Company (State Farm).  The case against
the driver of the other vehicle involved in the collision has settled for the
$15,000 policy limit.  Petitioner  seeks underinsured coverage from State Farm.  Petitioner has made a demand for the
remainder of the underinsured motorist policy of $250,000.
 
On 2/1/24, Petitioner’s petition to compel arbitration
and appoint a neutral arbitrator was 
granted.  (See 2/1/24
Minute Order).  On 2/6/24, the parties
submitted a stipulation agreeing to the appointment of the Honorable Andrew
Kauffman as arbitrator.  (See
Stipulation filed 2/6/24).  On 2/9/24,
pursuant to the stipulation, the Court ordered Andrew Kauffman of Alternative
Resolution Centers as arbitrator.  (See
2/9/24 Minute Order).
 
Before this action was filed, on 8/4/23, Petitioner
served Request for Production of Documents, Set 1, among other written
discovery requests, on State Farm making responses due on 9/5/23.  (Tapanian Decl. ¶2, Ex.A).  State Farm failed to serve responses and
failed to respond to Petitioner’s counsel’s meet and confer efforts.  (Tapanian Decl., Ex.B).  Therefore, Petitioner filed motions to compel
responses which were scheduled for hearing in 3/21/24.  (Tapanian Decl.).
 
On 3/7/24, State Farm served responses to the discovery.  As a result, the motion to compel responses
to the document requests was placed off calendar.  (See 3/21/24 Minute Order).  The responses to the document requests
included objections to certain requests. 
(Tapanian Decl., Ex.C). 
 
On 4/24/24, Petitioner sent State Farm a meet and confer
letter regarding the insufficient responses to the document requests.  (Tapanian Decl., Ex.E).  The parties did not resolve the issues
regarding State Farm’s responses to Requests 7, 10, 11, 13 and 14.  (Tapanian Decl., Ex.F).  Therefore, on 7/9/24, pursuant to the
agreement to extend the time to file a motion to compel further responses (See
Ex.F, pdf 34), Petitioner filed and served the instant motion seeking an order
compelling State Farm to serve further responses to Request for Production of
Documents, Set 1, Request Nos. 7, 10, 11, 13 and 14, served on 8/4/23.  Additionally, Petitioner requests sanctions
against State Farm in the amount of $3,310.00. 
State Farm has not opposed or otherwise responded to the motion.  
 
ANALYSIS 
 
CCP 2031.310(a) provides: 
 
“On receipt of a response to a
demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling, the demanding party may
move for an order compelling further response to the demand if the demanding
party deems that any of the following apply: 
(1) A statement of compliance with
the demand is incomplete. 
(2) A representation of inability
to comply is inadequate, incomplete, or evasive. 
(3) An objection in the response is
without merit or too general.”
 
State Farm’s responses to the subject document requests
are deficient in that they are incomplete, evasive and/or include improper
and/or meritless objections.  
 
In response to Requests 7 and 11 improperly included
objections which were waived due to the untimeliness of the responses.  Even if the objections had not been waived, which
they were, State Farm failed to provide a privilege log to support its claim
that certain responsive documents are privileged.  See CCP 2031.240(c).  As such, Petitioner is entitled to further
responses to these requests, without objections.
 
In response to Requests 10, 13 and 14, State Farm states
that after a reasonable search, it will produce all documents in its
possession, custody and control. 
However, State Farm failed to identify which documents or categories of
documents produced are responsive to these requests as required.  See CCP 2031.280(a).  As such, Petitioner is entitled to further
responses to these requests.   
 
Petitioner is entitled to an award of sanctions against State
Farm for its failure to comply with its discovery obligations.  CCP 2031.310(h); CCP 2023.010(e); CCP
2023.030(a).  However, the Court finds
that the amount of sanctions requested is excessive.  Therefore, the Court imposes sanctions
against State Farm and in favor of Plaintiff in the amount of $1,685.00 (4
hours to meet and confer and prepare motion + 1 hour to prepare for and appear
at the hearing multiplied by $325/hour + $60 filing fee).  (See Tapanian Decl. ¶13).
 
CONCLUSION
 
The motions is granted. 
Further responses are due and sanctions are payable within 30 days.
