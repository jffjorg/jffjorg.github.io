RULING: The motion is granted as set forth
below.   
 
SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises out of an alleged fall that occurred
while Plaintiff Phyllis Ginolfi (Plaintiff) 
attended Defendant/Cross-Complainant HDL, Inc. dba
Pacoima Adult Day Care’s (HDL) adult day care facility on 8/20/19.  On 8/20/19, Plaintiff was transported to and
from HDL’s facility by a paratransit van operated by Defendant/Cross-Defendant
Keolis Transit America, Inc. (Keolis).   
 
On 6/7/21, Plaintiff filed this action against HDL and Defendant/Cross-Defendant
Right Choice In-Home Care, Inc. (Right Choice) for: (1) Dependent Adult/Elder
Abuse and (2) Negligence.  Keolis was
later named in place of Doe 1.  
 
On 10/27/23, Right Choice served Keolis with Request for
Production of Documents, Set 1, making responses due by 11/28/23.  (Nguyen Decl., Ex.A).  After not receiving timely responses, Right
Choice’s counsel contacted Keolis’ counsel and it was agreed that Keolis would
provide responses, without objection, by 12/15/23.  (Nguyen Decl.).  Responses were not received and Keolis’
counsel then promised responses, without objection, by 12/22/23.  Id. 
Still, no responses were served and on 1/5/24, Keolis’ counsel promised
responses by the end of the day.  Id.  Again, no responses were received.  Id. 
Counsel for the parties continued to meet and confer; however, as of the
filing of the motion, Keolis had still failed to serve responses to the
document requests.  Id.
 
Therefore, on 5/17/24, Right Choice filed and served the
instant motion seeking an order compelling Keolis to provide responses, without
objection, to Right Choice’s Request for Production of Documents, Set 1.  Additionally, Right Choice requests sanctions
against Keolis in the amount of $2,445.00. 
Keolis has not opposed or otherwise responded to the motion.  
  
ANALYSIS
 
Due to Keolis’ failure to provide timely responses to the
subject Requests for Production of Documents, Right Choice is entitled to an order
compelling responses without objections. 

CCP 2031.300(a), (b). 
Additionally, Right Choice is entitled to sanctions against Keolis for
its failure to comply with its discovery obligations.  CCP 2023.030(a); CCP 2031.300(c).  However, the Court finds that the amount ($2,385.00)
of sanctions requested is excessive. 
Therefore, sanctions are awarded in the amount of $1,120.00 (3 hours to
prepare motion + 1 hour to prepare for and appear at the hearing multiplied by
$265/hour + $60 filing fee).  (See
Nguyen Decl. ¶¶16-17).
 
CONCLUSION
 
The motion is granted. 
Responses, without objections, are due and sanctions are payable within
30 days.
