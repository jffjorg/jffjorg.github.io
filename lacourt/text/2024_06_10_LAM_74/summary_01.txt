And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication. The court sustains the defendant's objection to the plaintiff's additional material fact #139 and denies the defendant's motion for summary adjudication of the first cause of action for whistleblower retaliation. However, the court grants the defendant's motion for summary adjudication of the second cause of action for race and gender discrimination, as the plaintiff fails to create a triable issue of material fact supported by admissible evidence. The court finds that the defendant's evidence that the transfer was for reasons unrelated to the plaintiff's race or gender satisfies the defendant's prima facie burden, and the plaintiff's evidence to support her claim of discriminatory animus is insufficient. As a result, the plaintiff's cause of action fails, and the defendant shall give notice.
