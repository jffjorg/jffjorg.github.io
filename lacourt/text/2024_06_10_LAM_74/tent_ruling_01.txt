  Case Number:  22STCV12873    Hearing Date:   June 10, 2024    Dept:  74 Link v. County
of Los Angeles
Defendant County of Los Angeles’
Motion for Summary Judgment or, in the Alternative, Summary Adjudication.
 
The court sustains
defendant’s objection to plaintiff’s additional material fact #139. All other evidentiary
objections are preserved.
The court denies
defendant’s motion for summary adjudication of the first cause of action for whistleblower
retaliation because a triable issue of material fact exists whether plaintiff engaged
in protected activity. (Lab. Code § 1102.5, subd. (b).) Triable issues exist
whether plaintiff reported (or caused to be reported), or defendant believed
plaintiff might report (or cause to be reported), illegal conduct (plaintiff’s
additional material facts #107, 109, 111, 122) to her supervisors or the government
(plaintiff’s additional material facts # 111, 114, 118, 119, 120, 133).
The court grants defendant’s
motion for summary adjudication of the second cause of action for race and
gender discrimination because plaintiff fails to create a triable issue of
material fact supported by admissible evidence that defendant with discriminatory
intent transferred plaintiff. Defendant’s evidence that it transferred
plaintiff for reasons unrelated to her race or gender satisfies defendant’s
prima facie burden. Plaintiff’s evidence to support her claim of discriminatory
animus is her additional material fact #139 citing her declaration paragraph
23, to which the court sustains defendant’s objection, thus leaving the record
devoid of evidence to support plaintiff's claim. Accordingly, plaintiff’s cause of
action fails.
Defendant shall give notice.
