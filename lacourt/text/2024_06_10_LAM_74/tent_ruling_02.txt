 Case Number:  23STCV07253    Hearing Date:   June 10, 2024    Dept:  74 Yamamoto v. Farms,
Jr. 
Plaintiff Takuma Yamamoto’s Unopposed
Motion to Compel Responses to Form Interrogatories – General (Set One).
 
Defendant
has not served responses to Plaintiff’s form interrogatories – general (set
one). (Martinez Decl., ¶5.). An order compelling full and complete verified
responses, without objections, is warranted. Moreover, the court finds that
monetary sanctions are warranted. Because defendant did not oppose the motion,
the court deducts from the sanctions award the time plaintiff anticipated spending
to review an opposition and preparing a reply. 
The
court grants Plaintiff Takuma Yamamoto’s motion to compel responses to form
interrogatories (set one). The court orders Defendant Johnnie K. Farms, Jr. to
serve verified responses, without objections, within 10 days of the date of
this order to Plaintiff’s Form Interrogatories – General (Set One). The court
orders Defendant Johnnie K. Farms, Jr. to pay $1,390.00 (4.0 hrs x $325.00/hr +
$90.00) in sanctions to Plaintiff within 30 days of the date of this order. 
Plaintiff
shall give notice.
