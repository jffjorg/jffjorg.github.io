The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to continue the trial in a lawsuit involving Yeon Su Kim, Plaintiff, against Bella Assets LLC, Bada, LLC, and others. The Plaintiff is seeking to continue the trial due to ongoing workers' compensation litigation, preparation of a statement of damages, and incomplete discovery. The Judge finds good cause to grant the motion and continues the trial to January 14, 2025. However, the Judge notes that Plaintiff has not requested to reopen discovery, which would be necessary to extend deadlines for discovery and related motions.
