And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge grants the County of Los Angeles's motion to compel responses to the requests for production of documents, special interrogatories, and form interrogatories. The judge orders the plaintiff to provide verified code-compliant responses without objections and to produce the documents, electronically stored information, and/or other things requested without objections by July 12, 2024. The judge also grants the County's motion to compel responses to the special and form interrogatories and orders the plaintiff to provide verified code-compliant responses to the special and form interrogatories without objections by July 12, 2024. The judge denies the County's requests for sanctions, as the Discovery Act does not authorize sanctions for the County's unopposed motions to compel responses.
