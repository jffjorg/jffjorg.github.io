  Case Number:  21STCV34276    Hearing Date:   June 14, 2024    Dept:  28 Having
considered the documents submitted in support of a default judgment, the Court
rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On September
16, 2021, Plaintiff Mohammad Tehrani (“Plaintiff”)
filed this action against Defendants City of Los Angeles (“City”), Derek Anthony Dale
(“Dale”), and Doe 1-100 for general negligence, intentional tort, and
civil rights violation.  Plaintiff did
not have counsel. 
The
complaint alleged the following: On November 7, 2020, at 1545 Brockton Avenue,
#18, in Los Angeles, Defendants attacked Plaintiff and violated his civil
rights.  Defendants “charged toward
Plaintiff, and threatened to strike Plaintiff with their fists.”  Defendants “intended to cause and did cause
Plaintiff to suffer the apprehension of a harmful contact.”  Defendants “did in fact strike Plaintiff on
his person” and “intended to cause and did cause a harmful contact with
Plaintiff’s person.”On February 27, 2023, Plaintiff filed a substitution of attorney form substituting Alberto E. Algaze (“Algaze”) into the case to represent him.
On
February 28, 2023, Plaintiff filed a proof of service showing personal service of the summons, complaint, and other documents on Dale on November 11, 2021.  This proof of service did not mention a statement of damages.
Also on
February 28, 2023, Plaintiff filed a statement of damages dated February 28,
2023 which requested $10 million in general damages.  The attached proof of service showed service
by facsimile on the “facsimile telephone number” of an unnamed recipient. 
On
March 6, 2023, Plaintiff filed a substitution of attorney form replacing Algaze
with Plaintiff as a self-represented litigant. 
On
April 14, 2023, the City filed an answer. 
On
May 31, 2023, Plaintiff filed a substitution of attorney form substituting Grenville
Pridham of Severo, PLC, into the case to represent him. 
On
August 9, 2023 and September 19, 2023, Plaintiff’s former attorney Algaze filed
amended proofs of service showing personal service of the summons, complaint, statement
of damages, and other documents on Dale on November 11, 2021. 
On
September 19, 2023, the clerk entered Dale’s default. 
On
February 13, 2024, Plaintiff filed a substitution of attorney form substituting
Mario Tafur as Plaintiff’s attorney in place of Grenville Pridham. 
Also
on February 13, 2024, Plaintiff filed a request for default judgment on form
CIV-100 asking the Court to award over $25 million in damages against
Dale.  On February 14, 2024, Plaintiff submitted
a JUD-100 proposed judgment form.  On
March 12, 2024, Plaintiff filed a declaration supporting his request for default
judgment. 
On
March 15, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel asked the Court for additional time to
apply for separate judgment against the non-defaulted defendants.  (See Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1800(a)(7).)  The Court continued the hearing to June 14, 2024. 
PLAINTIFF’S REQUEST 
Plaintiff
asks the Court to enter a default judgment against Defendant Derek Anthony Dale
and award Plaintiff $25,203,755.00, consisting of $10,000,000.00 as the “demand
of the complaint,” $15,000,000.00 in punitive damages, $10,000,000.00 in
general damages, $203,270.00 in attorney’s fees, and $485.00 in costs. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
A.      Default judgment 
“[With exceptions that do not apply here,] [a] party
seeking a default judgment on declarations must use mandatory Request for Entry
of Default (Application to Enter Default) (form CIV-100) . . . The following
must be included in the documents filed with the clerk: 
“(1)  Except in
unlawful detainer cases, a brief summary of the case identifying the parties
and the nature of plaintiff's claim; 
“(2) 
Declarations or other admissible evidence in support of the judgment
requested; 
“(3)  Interest
computations as necessary; 
“(4)  A
memorandum of costs and disbursements; 
“(5)  A
declaration of nonmilitary status for each defendant against whom judgment is
sought; 
“(6)  A proposed
form of judgment; 
“(7)  A
dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application
for separate judgment against specified parties under Code of Civil Procedure
section 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment; 
“(8)  Exhibits
as necessary; and 
“(9)  A request
for attorney fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.” 
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1800(a).) 
B.       Damages 
 On a request for default judgment, “[w]here a
cause of action is stated in the complaint, plaintiff merely needs to introduce
evidence establishing a prima facie case for damages.”  (L. Edmon & C. Karnow, Cal. Practice
Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (Rutter 2023) ¶ 5:213.1, p. 5-56 (Cal.
Practice Guide), citing Johnson v. Stanhiser (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 357,
361 [trial court erred in applying preponderance of the evidence standard].) 
 The relief granted to a plaintiff upon entry
of a defendant's default cannot exceed the amount demanded in the complaint or,
for personal injury cases where damages may not be stated in the complaint, the
amount listed in the statement of damages. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 580, subd. (a),
585, subd. (b).) “The notice requirement of section 580 was designed to insure
fundamental fairness.” (Becker v. S.P.V. Construction Co. (1980) 27
Cal.3d 489, 494.) The statute insures that “defendants in cases which involve a
default judgment have adequate notice of the judgments that may be taken
against them. [Citation.] ‘If a judgment other than that which is demanded is
taken against him, [the defendant] has been deprived of his day in court—a
right to a hearing on the matter adjudicated.’ ’’ (Id. at p. 493.) A
trial court exceeds its jurisdiction if it awards damages in excess of the
amount specified in the complaint or statement of damages. (Id. at p.
494.) 
DISCUSSION 
“If defendant has not appeared in the action, the
[Code of Civil Procedure section 425.11] statement of damages must be served
‘in the same manner as a summons’ . . . .” 
(Cal. Practice Guide, supra, ¶ 5:91, p. 5-33, quoting Code Civ.
Proc., § 425.11, subd. (d)(1).)  A
summons may be served by personal service (id., ¶
4:367, p. 4-65), proper “substitute service” (id., ¶ 4:370, p. 4-66),
service by mail with acknowledgement of receipt (id., ¶ 4:371, p. 4-65),
or publication (id., ¶ 4:367, p. 4-65). 
The proof of service attached to the statement of
damages filed on February 28, 2023, purported to show service by facsimile on an
unnamed recipient.  The proof of service
did not list Dale’s name.  It listed only
a “facsimile telephone number.”  The proof
of service attached to the statement of damages did not satisfy statutory requirements and does not establish that Plaintiff properly served the statement of damages on Dale
before the clerk entered Dale’s default. 
On August 9, 2023 and September 19, 2023, Plaintiff’s
former attorney Algaze filed amended proofs of service showing personal service
of a statement of damages (and other documents) on Dale on November 11,
2021.  Algaze, however, did not have
authority to file documents on Plaintiff’s behalf because Plaintiff had filed a
substitution of attorney form on March 6, 2023 removing Algaze as Plaintiff’s
counsel.  Moreover, the only statement of
damages in the record is dated February 28, 2023, over a year after Algaze purportedly
served it on Dale.  In addition, when Plaintiff filed the original version of the proof of service on February 28, 2023, it did not mention a statement of damages.  The Court finds that
the August 9 and September 19, 2023 proofs of service do not establish that
Plaintiff properly served a statement of damages on Dale before the clerk
entered Dale’s default. 
Because the record does not show that Plaintiff
properly served a statement of damages on Dale before the clerk
entered Dale’s default, the Court vacates the default and denies Plaintiff’s
application for entry of default judgment. 
CONCLUSION 
The Court VACATES the default of Defendant Derek
Anthony Dale entered on September 19, 2023. 
The Court DENIES Plaintiff Mohammad Tehrani’s
application for entry of default judgment. 
The Court sets an OSC re: Status of Entry of Default
on August 2, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. in Department 28 of the Spring Street
Courthouse. 
Plaintiff is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
