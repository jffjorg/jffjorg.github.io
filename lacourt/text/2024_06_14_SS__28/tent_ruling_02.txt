 Case Number:  22STCV27823    Hearing Date:   June 14, 2024    Dept:  28 Having
considered the petitioning papers, the Court rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On August
26, 2022, Plaintiffs Victor Manuel Perez, Veronica Esther Perez, Mason Manuel
Perez, a minor by and through his guardian ad litem Veronica Esther Perez, and
Jaxon Andy Perez, a minor by and through his guardian ad litem Veronica Esther
Perez, filed this action against Defendants Andrea Michelle Sidman and Does
1-50 for motor vehicle tort and general negligence. 
On
February 1, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a notice of settlement. On
May 2, 2024, Petitioner Veronica Perez (“Petitioner”) filed a petition to
approve the compromise of minor Plaintiff Mason Perez’s claims. 
PETITIONER’S REQUEST 
Petitioner
asks the Court to approve the compromise of the pending action of Plaintiff Mason
Perez. 
DISCUSSION 
The
petition contains the following information about the proposed settlement: 
Gross
settlement amount:                              $8,000.00
Total
medical expenses:                                 $25,588.36
Reductions:                                                    $20,198.00
Payment/reimbursement
from proceeds:        $2,941.49
Attorney’s
fees:                                             $2,000.00
Non-medical
costs:                                        $273.50
Net
balance:                                                   $2,785.01
 Section
12a(1) of the petition states that total medical expenses were $25,588.36.  Section 12a(3) of the petition states that
this amount was reduced by $20,198.00 as the result of negotiated, contractual,
and statutory reductions.  This should
mean that the remaining $5,390.36 will be paid or reimbursed from the
settlement proceeds.  However, Section
12a(4) of the petition states that only $2,941.49 of the medical expenses will
be paid or reimbursed from the settlement proceeds.  As a result, $2,448.87 of the medical
expenses are unaccounted for.  The Court
cannot grant a petition to approve a minor’s compromise unless it shows that
all medical expenses that have not been waived or reduced will be paid or
reimbursed from the settlement proceeds. 
The
Court denies the petition without prejudice. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court DENIES without prejudice the petition to approve the compromise of minor Plaintiff Mason Perez’s action filed by Petitioner Veronica Perez on May 2, 2024. 
Petitioner
is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Petitioner
is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court within
five days.
