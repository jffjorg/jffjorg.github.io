And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has set a hearing date for November 17, 2023, to consider the plaintiff's Pitchess motion and motions to compel. The motion is denied with prejudice with respect to Judish James Williams, as records regarding his employment have been destroyed. The motion is denied without prejudice with respect to Armando Montalvo, Nicole Larisa Griffin, and Daniel Wells, as the plaintiff has failed to provide a declaration detailing good cause for the discovery of records from these officers. The plaintiff's Pitchess motion is also denied as moot with respect to Carlos Mitre, as the defendant has filed verified responses to the plaintiff's requests. Sanctions are imposed on Defendant Mitre for the motion to Deem Requests for Admissions Admitted, and on the remaining motions.
