English-text summary:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the defendant's special motion to strike, granting the motion. The lawsuit is based on a malicious prosecution claim, which requires that the defendant brought a prior action without probable cause and with malice. The judge concluded that the plaintiff has not provided sufficient evidence to demonstrate that the defendant committed perjury in her application for a temporary restraining order, and therefore did not meet the burden of proving malice. The judge also found that the plaintiff has not shown that a reasonable person in the defendant's circumstances would have believed that there were reasonable grounds to bring the temporary restraining order application. As a result, the judge granted the defendant's special motion to strike and dismissed the lawsuit.
