  Case Number:  19STCV13057    Hearing Date:   October 31, 2023    Dept:  78 Superior Court of California County of Los Angeles Department 78  DANIEL ANTUNEZ,Plaintiff, vs. LOS ANGELES DODGERS, LLC, et al., Defendants.  Case No.:  19STCV13057 Hearing Date:  October 31, 2023  [TENTATIVE] RULING RE: PLAINTIFF’S PITCHESS MOTION AND MOTIONS TO COMPELThe Court sets for November 17, 2023 at 8:30 a.m. an OSC Re: Dismissal of all Defendants for Failure to Enter Default. No Defendant has filed an answer or other responsive pleading to the Second Amended Complaint which was filed and served on August 21, 2023.The Pitchess motion is denied without prejudice, except as follows.The motion is denied with prejudice with respect to Judish James Williams given the declaration filed indicating that records regarding his employment with the CDCR between 1983 and 2011 have been destroyed pursuant to CDCR’s documentation retention policy. (10/27/23 Declaration of Renee Solis.)The Court makes no ruling with respect to Carlos Mitre as Plaintiff withdrew the Pitchess motion as it pertains to him. (10/25/23 Notice of Withdrawal.)With respect to Plaintiff’s Pitchess Motion (filed on 8/24/23) this leaves three law enforcement officers: (1) Armando Montalvo; (2) Nicole Larisa Griffin; and (3) Daniel Wells all of whom work at the Los Angeles County Probation Department.It appears that Wells is not a party to this case. Why he is included in the request remains a mystery. Plaintiff seeks 13 categories of items with respect to these law enforcement officers.However, Plaintiff has failed to provide a declaration detailing for each of the three law enforcement officers good cause with respect to each of the 13 categories of records sought.  Plaintiff has not provided any scenario as to what these officers are alleged to have done with respect to this incident and how those actions relate to the 13 categories of records sought. The Court notes that there should either be three separate declarations or one declaration with three separate sections identifying the alleged good cause with respect to each officer. The party seeking Pitchess discovery “must file a motion supported by affidavits showing ‘good cause for the discovery,’ first by demonstrating the materiality of the information to the pending litigation, and second by ‘stating upon reasonable belief’ that the police agency has the records or information at issue.” (Warrick v. Superior Court (2005) 35 Cal.4th 1011, 1019.)The “good cause” declaration must be sufficiently specific “to preclude the possibility of [the movant] simply casting about for any helpful information.” (People v. Mooc (2001) 26 Cal.4th 1216, 1226.) However, an attorney declaration based upon information and belief may be used to evidence good cause in support of a Pitchess motion. (Haggerty v. Superior Court (2004) 117 Cal.App.4th 1079, 1086.) The moving party needs to show a “plausible factual foundation” for discovery—that is, a specific factual scenario of officer misconduct that might have or could have occurred. (Warrick, supra, 35 Cal.4th at 1025-1026.) Defendant Dodgers have no standing to oppose this motion.  Assuming verified responses have been served by Defendant Carlos Mitre to the following: (1) Plaintiff’s FROGS, Set One; (2) Plaintiff’s SROGS, Set One; (3) Plaintiff’s Requests for Admission, Set One; (4) Plaintiff’s Request for Production, Set One; and (5) Plaintiff’s  Supplemental Request for Production, Set One, the motions are denied as moot.Sanctions are imposed with respect to the motion to Deem Requests for Admissions Admitted in the amount of $860 against Defendant Mitre. The filing fees are awarded with respect to the remaining motions for a total of $180.Sanctions in the amount of $1,040 are imposed on Defendant Mitre. Sanctions are payable within 30 days after the date of this order.DATED:  October 31, 2023 _______________________Hon. Jill Feeney  Judge of the Superior Court
