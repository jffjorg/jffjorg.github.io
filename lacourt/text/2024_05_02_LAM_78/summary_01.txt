And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the defendant's motion for attorney's fees in the amount of $82,142.35. The plaintiff objected to the amount of fees claimed by the defendant, citing certain entries in the defendant's billing as unreasonable. The court found that the time spent by the defendant's counsel on meet and confer correspondence and the motion for summary judgment was not unreasonable. The court also found that the defendant's counsel provided a detailed account of their billing and that the objections by the plaintiff were not sufficient to challenge the reasonableness of the fees. The court awarded the defendant's fees in a reduced amount, taking into account the defendant's concession that certain errors in billing had occurred.
