And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's motion to enforce the settlement agreement. The plaintiff and defendant entered into a settlement agreement on November 2021, where the defendant acknowledged his indebtedness to the plaintiff and agreed to repay the loan in three payments. However, the defendant failed to make the last two payments. The plaintiff moves to enforce the settlement agreement, which requires the defendant to provide a security interest in his interest in Tatatu S.p.A. The judge rules that the court may not modify the settlement agreement and must enforce it as written. The judge grants the plaintiff's motion to enforce the settlement agreement and will enter the proposed judgment, which requires the defendant to provide a security interest in his interest in Tatatu S.p.A.
