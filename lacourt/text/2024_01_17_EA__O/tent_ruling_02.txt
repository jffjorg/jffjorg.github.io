[1] Any application
material must be submitted at least 16 court days before the hearing. 
 


[2] The court directs
Plaintiff to CCP section 585 to ensure certain requirements (e.g., dismissal of
Doe Defendants) are met. 


[3] Though the form
does not clearly indicate, the court intended to dismiss Kim’s cross-complaint.
(See 11/17/21 minute order.) 
 


[4] The ‘Further
Declaration of Attorney Douglas Borthwick” does provide a CIV-100 form, but
that form also does not provide the amount sought and against whom. Though the
declarations indicate that Plaintiff seeks judgment against all defendants for
$900,000 (presumably based upon joint and several liability, though not
explained), both forms are mandatory for default judgments. (See Cal. Rules of
Court Rule 3.1800.)
