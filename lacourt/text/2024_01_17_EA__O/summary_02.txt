And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling outlines the judge's thinking based on information presented before the court. The judge directs the plaintiff to review CCP section 585 to ensure that certain requirements are met, specifically the dismissal of Doe Defendants. The judge also intends to dismiss Kim's cross-complaint, as indicated in a previous minute order. The plaintiff's submission of a "Further Declaration of Attorney Douglas Borthwick" does not meet the requirements for default judgments, as the forms do not specify the amount sought and against whom. The judge orders the plaintiff to submit the mandatory forms for default judgments, which must be done at least 16 court days before the hearing.
