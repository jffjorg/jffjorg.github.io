And here is the English-text summary:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling denying Plaintiff Jin Hong's request for entry of default judgment without prejudice. The Court cannot review the material submitted in support of the default judgment application as Plaintiff has not provided a JUD-100 form indicating who Plaintiff seeks default judgment against and for what amount. The Court has previously denied default judgment for several reasons, including the failure to notify the Court of related cases and the attempt to circumvent claim or issue preclusion defenses. The Court has also admonished Counsel to address the issues detailed in the previous ruling on the next court date.
