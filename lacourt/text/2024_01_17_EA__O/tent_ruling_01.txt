Request for Entry of Default Judgment is DENIED without prejudice.[1]

 
Background
 
This is a negligence
case. Plaintiff Jin Hong alleges the following against Defendants MICHELLE KIM
(“Kim”); JOSEPH DINGLASAN, M.D MEEIN MEDICAL CORPORATION dba EBEN EZER MEDICAL
CLINIC (“Clinic”) and Doe Defendants[2]:
In July 2018, Kim performed a laser treatment on Plaintiff’s face that caused
permanent scarring and disfigurement. Plaintiff later learned that, despite
representations, Kim was unlicensed and unqualified to perform the treatment.

1.

2.    
Negligent

Damages
 
On July
13, 2020, Kim filed a demurrer and a cross complaint against Plaintiff and
Douglas Borthwick alleging, inter alia, COAs for civil extortion and breach of
settlement agreement.
 
On July
27, 2020, default was entered against Dr. Dinglasan. 
 
On
February 22, 2021, the court adopted its tentative ruling on Kim’s demurrer,
which to take the demurrer off calendar due to numerous unsuccessful attempts
at contacting Kim to reschedule the demurrer. (No appearances by Defendant(s)
at the hearing.) The court also set two OSCs: “Order to Show Cause Re: Failure
to File Proof of Service as to Defendant Meein Medical Corporation is scheduled
for 04/13/21 at 08:30 AM in Department J at Pomona Courthouse South. Order to
Show Cause Re: Sanctions for Defendant, Michelle Kim's, Failure to Appear is
scheduled for 04/13/21 at 08:30 AM in Department J at Pomona Courthouse South.”
 
On April
13, 2021, the court issued, in relevant part, the following minute order: “There
is no appearance by defendant this date. The Order to Show Cause for
plaintiff's failure to serve defendant Meein Medical Corporation is held and
discharged. Defendant has been served. On the Court's own motion, the Case
Management Conference scheduled for 04/13/2021, and Order to Show Cause Re:
Sanctions for Defendant, Michelle Kim's, Failure to Appear scheduled for
04/13/2021 are continued to 06/04/21 at 08:30 AM in Department J at Pomona
Courthouse South. The Order to Show Cause is continued for possible terminating
sanctions, including plaintiff's request to strike defendant's demurrer.”
 
On
April 29, 2021, default was entered against the Clinic. 
 
On June 4,
2021, the court in its minute order stated the following: “Defendant Michelle
Kim failed to appear for the third time. Case Management Conference is held.
Plaintiff may proceed by way of Default Judgement.”
 
On June
7, 2021, default was entered against Kim.
 
On
November 8, 2021, Plaintiff filed a substitution of attorney indicating that he
was no longer pro per and that Douglas Borthwick would be his attorney.
 
On November
17, 2021, the court, on its own, filed an order of dismissal indicating that
“the within action is dismissed without prejudice as to Douglas Macmillan
Borthwick, et al.”[3]
The minute order states the following: “The Court and counsel confer in regards
to the non-jury trial. The Court takes the non-jury trial off calendar. Order
to Show Cause Re: Default Judgment is scheduled for 05/05/22 at 08:30 AM in
Department R at Pomona Courthouse South. There being no appearance by
defendants. The Court orders Douglas Macmillan Borthwick and Jin Hong in
Cross-Complaint filed by Michelle Kim on 07/13/2020 dismissed without
prejudice.”
 
On May 12,
2022, according to the minute order Regarding the OSC re: Default Judgment, no
parties appeared such that the court set two OSCs: Order to Show Cause Re:
Plaintiff and Defendant's Failure to Appear on 5/12/2022 is scheduled for
08/17/2022 at 08:30 AM in Department R at Pomona Courthouse South. Order to
Show Cause Re: Dismissal for Plaintiff's Failure to Prosecute Case.
 
On March
15, 2023, the court adopted its tentative ruling regarding the default judgment
as final. The tentative ruling denied the default judgment for the following
main reason: 
 
However,
those defects aside, there is a more significant reason why the matter is
denied with prejudice: there appear to be a total of three related cases (the
instant case, Case 20PSCV00055 and 19PSCV00577).[2] Moreover, not only did Plaintiff
not notify the court of the related cases (which it must have done),[3] but the
failure to do so may be an attempt to circumvent claim or issue preclusion
defenses, which may altogether have been grounds to dismiss this instant action
with prejudice. Furthermore, Plaintiff appears to have changed his name from
Guifeng Zhang (see Case 20PSCV00055) to Jin Hong, perhaps again attempt to
circumvent any defenses.  
 
On March
24, 2023, the court issued the following in its minute order: “The Court
admonishes Counsel to address the issues detailed in the above indicated ruling
on the next court date. Pursuant to the request of plaintiff, the Order to Show
Cause Re: Default Judgment scheduled for 05/24/2023 is continued to 08/25/2023
at 09:00 AM in Department O at Pomona Courthouse South.”
 
On August
22, 2023, Plaintiff filed two notices of related cases.
 
On August
29, 2023, the court denied the notice of related case(s) as both 19PSCV00577
and 20STCV08390 were dismissed. 
 
On
November 29, 2023, Plaintiff filed his default judgment application material. 
 
On
November 30, 2023, the court continued the default judgment hearing as
Plaintiff filed the material but one day before the hearing.  
 
Discussion
 
The court
cannot review the material submitted in support of Plaintiff’s default judgment
application as Plaintiff has not provided a JUD-100 form indicating who Plaintiff
seeks default judgment against and for what amount.[4]
 
Conclusion
 
Based on
the foregoing, the application is denied without prejudice.
