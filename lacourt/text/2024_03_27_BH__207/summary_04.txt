And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

This tentative ruling provides guidance on the handling of motions to compel responses to discovery requests. The court notes that providing untimely responses does not divest the trial court of its authority to hear the motion, and that the court retains the authority to hear the motion even if the untimely response does not contain objections and substantially resolve the issues raised by the motion. The court also notes that sanctions may be appropriate for untimely responses, and that the notice of motion must expressly state that sanctions are being sought against opposing counsel. Additionally, the court clarifies the distinction between waiver and forfeiture, noting that waiver is the intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right, while forfeiture is the failure to make a timely assertion of a right. The court also notes that a party may forfeit the right to object to venue by failing to timely raise an objection.
