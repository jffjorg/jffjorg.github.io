And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted both defendants' motions to be relieved as counsel, citing an impasse between the counsel and defendants. The judge found that the motions were procedurally and substantively proper, despite the defendants' objections regarding payment challenges. The judge ordered that counsel must serve the signed order on the defendants and all other parties who have appeared in the action, and file a proof of service of such.
