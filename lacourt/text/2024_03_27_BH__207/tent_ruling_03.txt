            Defendant NAI Capital Commercial
Inc. (“Defendant”) moves to compel verified responses from Plaintiff Alexander
Rivkin (“Plaintiff”) to Form Interrogatories (Set One) (“FROG”); Special
Interrogatories (Set One) (“SROG”) and Demands for Production of Documents (Set
One) (“RPD”).  Defendant also seeks
monetary sanctions in connection with the motions.  
 
Plaintiff opposes the motions and Defendant replies.
 
LEGAL
STANDARDS
 
1.     Interrogatories
 
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section
2030.290, “[i]f a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to serve a
timely response . . . [t]he party to whom the interrogatories are directed
waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings under Section
2030.230, as well as any objection to the interrogatories, including one based
on privilege or the protection for work product under Chapter 4 (commencing
with Section 2018.010.  . . .   [and] The party propounding the
interrogatories may move for an order compelling response to the
interrogatories.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subds. (a)-(b).) 
 
2.     Requests
for Production
 
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.300, subdivision (a),
“[i]f a party to whom a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is
directed fails to serve a timely response . . . [t]he party to whom the demand
for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is directed waives any objection
to the demand, including one based on privilege or on the protection for work
product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 2018.010.  . . . [and] The party making the demand may
move for an order compelling response to the demand.”  (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.300, subds. (a)-(b).)  
 
ANALYSIS
 
1.    
Discovery Requests
 
Defendant electronically served Plaintiff the
FROG, SROG, and RPD on November 6, 2023. 
(See Kenney Decl. ¶¶ 2-4 and Exhibits A-C thereto.)  Plaintiff did not
timely respond to the subject discovery requests.  (Kenney Decl. ¶ 5.)  
 
In opposition, Plaintiff indicates it has
since served verified responses to FROG, SROG, and RPD, and that it has
produced documents in response to the RPD, thus mooting the instant motions.
 
In reply, Defendant argues that Plaintiff’s
responses are inadequate, as Plaintiff improperly relies on objections that
were waived by virtue of Plaintiff’s untimely response, and the responses also
make clear that some documents are being improperly withheld.
 
Because Plaintiff has served responses to
the FROG, SROG, and RPD, the Court denies the motion to compel initial
responses is moot, except as to the issue of sanctions.[1]  Any deficiencies in the FROG, SROG, or RPD
responses are properly the subject of a motion to compel further responses
and/or a motion to compel further production, as appropriate.
 
2.    
Monetary Sanctions
Defendant
requests monetary sanctions for legal fees spent in connection with the
motions.  However, Defendant did not
properly notice the request for sanctions against Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s
counsel.  As such, the request for
sanctions is procedurally defective, especially as to Plaintiff’s counsel.[2]  Nonetheless, Plaintiff forfeited the issue by
failing to raise the procedural defect in the oppositions to the motion.[3]
 
The Court
finds Plaintiff’s failure to timely respond to the FROG, SROG, and RPD to be an
abuse of the discovery process, warranting monetary sanctions.  (See Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2023.010, subd. (d),
2030.290, subd. (c), 2031.310, subd. (h).) 
Accordingly, the Court imposes monetary sanctions against Plaintiff and
counsel for Plaintiff, Gary D. Fidler & Associates, APLC, in the amount of
$2222.66, which represents five hours of attorney time to prepare the moving
and reply papers, and attend the hearing, at $400 per hour, plus $222.66 in
filing fees at $74.22 per motion.     
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
Therefore, the Court denies, in part, Defendant’s motions to compel
responses to the FROG, SROG and RPD per Code of Civil Procedure sections
2030.290 and 2031.300 as moot.      
 
Further, the Court grants, in part, Defendant’s motions regarding the
requests for monetary sanctions and orders Plaintiff and counsel for Plaintiff,
Gary D. Fidler & Associates, APLC, jointly and severally, to pay monetary
sanctions in the amount of $2,222.66 to Defendant, by and through counsel for Defendant,
within 20 days of notice of the Court’s orders.
 
Defendant is ordered to
provide notice of the Court’s orders and file a proof of service of such.
