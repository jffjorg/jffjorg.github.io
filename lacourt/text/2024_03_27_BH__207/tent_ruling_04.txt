divest the trial court of its authority [to hear a motion to compel responses].”  (Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v.
Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 407.)  Even if the untimely response “does not
contain objections [and] substantially resolve[s] the issues raised by a motion
to compel responses…the trial court retains the authority to hear the
motion.”  (Id. at pp.
408-409.)  This rule gives “an important
incentive for parties to respond to discovery in a timely fashion.”  (Id. at p. 408.)  If “the propounding party [does not] take the
motion off calendar or narrow its scope to the issue of sanctions,” the trial
court may “deny the motion to compel responses as essentially unnecessary, in
whole or in part, and just impose sanctions.” 
(Id. at p. 409; see also Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1348(a) [“The court may award sanctions under the
Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery, even
though no opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to the motion was
withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party after
the motion was filed”].)
 


[2] “Where sanctions are sought against the opposing
party's counsel, the notice of motion must expressly so state. It is not enough
simply to attach declarations or a transcript showing that the deponent refused
to appear or answer questions on counsel's advice.” (Weil & Brown, Cal.
Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter Group 2023) ¶ 8:1985
(citing Blumenthal v. Superior Court (1980) 103 CA3d 317; Marriage of Fuller
(1985) 163 CA3d 1070); see also id. at ¶ 8:1986 [“Where an award is sought
against the attorney for advising the opposing party not to answer or respond,
the notice of motion must identify the opposing counsel and state that
sanctions are being sought against such counsel personally”].)
 


[3] “The terms “waiver” and “forfeiture” long have been
used interchangeably. As the United States Supreme Court has explained,
however, waiver is different from forfeiture. Whereas forfeiture is the failure
to make the timely assertion of a right, waiver is the ‘intentional
relinquishment or abandonment of a known right. 
Thus, it is most accurate to characterize the issue as whether a
defendant forfeits the right to object to venue by failing to timely raise such
an objection prior to trial.”  (People
v. Simon (2001) 25 Cal.4th 1082, 1097 [cleaned up]; see also Osman v.
Superior Court (2005) 134 Cal.App.4th 32, 36.)
