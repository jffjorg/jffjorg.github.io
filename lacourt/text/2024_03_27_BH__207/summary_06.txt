And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's petition to compel arbitration in a dispute arising from a rental agreement between the parties. The plaintiff, WIB Holdings LLC, sought to compel arbitration of the dispute, but the judge found that there was no evidence that the parties entered into a valid arbitration agreement. The judge noted that the defendant, Kristi Pinocchio, signed the arbitration agreement, but the plaintiff did not. The judge also found that the plaintiff had not demonstrated that there was a prior demand for arbitration and a refusal to arbitrate under the agreement. As a result, the judge denied the petition to compel arbitration and ordered the plaintiff to provide notice and file a proof of service of the denial.
