Summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge on a demurrer filed by the defendant, Innes Heights LP, to the complaint filed by the plaintiffs, Latisha Phillips, Lonella Ballard, Ishmael Ballard, Isaish Ballard, and Isaac Ballard. The demurrer is sustained as to the fifth and sixth causes of action, but overruled as to the first, second, third, fourth, seventh, and eighth causes of action. The court finds that the allegations in the complaint are sufficient to state a claim for breach of implied warranty of habitability, breach of statutory warranty of habitability, breach of covenant of quiet enjoyment, and negligence, but that the allegations are insufficient to state a claim for violation of Civil Code section 1942.4 and private nuisance. The court also finds that the complaint fails to state a claim for violation of the tenant anti-harassment ordinance and unfair competition law. The court grants leave to amend the complaint and sets a deadline for filing the amended complaint.
