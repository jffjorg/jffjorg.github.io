This is a tentative ruling by Judge Hon. Jon R. Takasugi in a case between Sandra Greene (Plaintiff) and Farmers Insurance Exchange (Defendant). The Plaintiff filed a motion to stay the entire action pending appeal of the Court's September 19, 2024 ruling granting the Defendant's motion for summary judgment. The motion is unopposed. The Court grants the Plaintiff's motion to stay, citing California Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) sections 916 and 923. The Court finds that any action taken in this case would affect the appellee's court jurisdiction over the matter, and the Defendant's non-opposition to the motion is considered a concession to the motion on the merits.
