And here is the English text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of T.H. Community, LLC v. Romero et al. The case involves an unlawful detainer action, where the plaintiff, T.H. Community, LLC, is suing the defendants, Romero et al., for alleged failure to vacate a property. However, the defendants have filed a demurrer and motion to strike portions of the complaint, arguing that the plaintiff is suspended by the Franchise Tax Board due to failure to pay corporate taxes and therefore cannot prosecute the lawsuit. The plaintiff does not oppose this argument. The Judge has taken judicial notice of the California Secretary of State online record, which shows that T.H. Community, LLC is indeed suspended by the Franchise Tax Board. Therefore, the Judge has sustained the demurrer without leave to amend, meaning that the plaintiff cannot prosecute the lawsuit until its status has been restored. The motion to strike is also moot.
