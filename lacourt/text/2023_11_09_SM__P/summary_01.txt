And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Goosen v. Draz et al, Case No. 20SMCV01622. The case involves a dispute over a lease agreement, with Goosen claiming that Draz breached the lease and Draz claiming that Goosen failed to perform improvements and repairs. The judge has denied Draz's request for declaratory relief, which sought to declare that Draz is entitled to a 10-year amortization period to use the property as intended. The judge has also denied Goosen's motion for summary judgment, finding that there are triable issues of material fact regarding the statute of limitations and the breach of lease claim. The judge has also denied Goosen's motion for summary adjudication, finding that the request for declaratory relief is not an independent cause of action, affirmative defense, claim for damages, or issue of duty. Finally, the judge has denied Goosen's motion to strike Draz's quasi-contract cause of action, finding that the pleading does not deny the existence or enforceability of the agreement, and that the quasi-contract cause of action is not available where the parties admit an express contract governs their relations.
