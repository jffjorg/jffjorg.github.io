On or about
June 25, 2020, a fire started in Defendant Lori Gonzalez’s kitchen.  Gonzalez lived in a condominium owned by
Defendant Mark Hassan and managed by Cross-Defendant Showcase Villa Owners
Association No. 7.  The condominium
suffered extensive damage and was later determined to have no fire or smoke
alarms.  The insurer, Plaintiff State
Farm General Insurance Co., brings this lawsuit alleging Negligence and Breach
of Contract.  Defendant Hassan’s
Cross-Complaint seeks Indemnification, Apportionment of Fault, and Declaratory
Relief.  
 
If a party
to whom interrogatories and document demands are directed fails to respond at
all, the propounding party’s remedy is to seek a court order compelling answers
thereto. (CCP §§ 2030.290, 2031.300.) All that needs to be shown is that the
discovery was properly served on the opposing party, that the time to respond
has expired, and that no response of any kind has been served. The moving party
is not required to show a reasonable and good faith attempt to resolve the
matter informally before filing this motion. A motion to compel initial
discovery responses need not show good cause, meeting and conferring, or timely
filing, and need not be accompanied by a separate statement. (See Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pac. Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 390, 404.) The failure to timely respond also waives all
objections. 
 
Here, Cross-Defendant
has shown that Form Interrogatories (set one), Special Interrogatories (set
one), and Request for Production of Documents (set one) were properly served
onto Cross-Complainant Mark Hassan on April 17, 2023. The deadlines to respond
have expired, and no responses of any kind have been provided.  These Motions were filed August 11, 2023— about
four months after service of the discovery. As of January 16, 2024, no substantive
Oppositions have been filed to the subject Motions. 
 
Therefore,
the Motions to Compel are GRANTED,
and Cross-Complainant MARK HASSAN is ORDERED
to provide verified responses and documents, without objection by no later
than 15 days from date of the Court’s issuance of this Order. This date may
be extended by stipulation of the parties. If any objections are asserted, it
will be tantamount to no response at all and will be deemed a violation of this
Court’s order. 
 
Monetary Sanctions
are not requested.
