CASE NO.:  22STCV31694 
HEARING:  01/18/24
 
#3
 
Defendant MESA VERDE CONVALESCENT HOSPITAL,
INC.’s Demurrer to Plaintiffs’ First Amended Complaint is CONTINUED to Thursday, March 7, 2024 at 9:30 a.m. in Dept. SE-C.

 
Moving Party to give notice. 
 
This personal injury action was filed by Plaintiff TERESA SOKOL,
individually and as the surviving heir, personal representative, and/or
successor-in-interest of Decedent, LESTER DALE BILES, and/or as administrator
or executor of the Estate of Lester Dale Biles (“Plaintiff”) on September 28,
2022. On October 5, 2023, the operative First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) was
filed. 
 
Plaintiff alleges “LESTER DALE BILES (‘DECEDENT’) died on May 16, 2021,
from injuries sustained while a patient at KINDRED HOSPTIAL WESTMINSTER…. [¶] DECEDENT
also sustained injuries while a patient at MESA VERDE POST ACUTE….” (FAC ¶¶1
and 4.) 
 
The FAC asserts the following causes of action: 
(1)
Negligence; 
(2)
Elder Abuse; 
(3)
Willful Misconduct; and
(4)
Wrongful Death
 
Defendant MESA VERDE CONVALESCENT HOSPITAL, INC. (“Defendant”) specially
and generally demurs to each cause of action. 
 
This matter is CONTINUED due to Defendant’s failure to comply with its
meet and confer obligations under CCP §430.41.
CCP
§430.41(a) states that, before filing a demurrer, the Moving Party must engage
in a specified meet and confer process with the party who filed the pleading at
issue for the purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached as to
the filing of an amended pleading that would resolve the objections to be
raised in the demurrer/motion to strike. “[T]he demurring party shall meet and
confer in person, by telephone, or by video conference with the party who filed
the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the purpose of determining whether
an agreement can be reached that would resolve the objections to be raised in
the demurrer.” (CCP §430.41(a).) A declaration setting forth such meet and
confer efforts must accompany the demurrer. (CCP § 430.41(a)(3).) 
The
Declaration of Marvin G. Fischler, attached to the subject Demurrer, does not
satisfy the requirement of CCP §430.41. Mr. Fishler expressly states that
Defendant did not comply with the meet and confer requirement prior to filing
the Demurrer. (See Fischler Decl., ¶4.) Moreover, the meet and confer
correspondence attached as Exhibit A to Mr. Fischler’s Declaration, was sent to
Plaintiff’s Counsel on the same date the subject Demurrer was served. 
Accordingly,
Defendant MESA
VERDE CONVALESCENT HOSPITAL, INC. is ORDERED to comply with CCP §430.41. If, after complying with CCP
§430.41, court intervention is needed, the parties may appear and argue the
merits on the continued hearing date. If the parties are unable to informally
resolve the issues raised in the instant Demurrer, then the Demurring Defendant
must submit a signed declaration indicating such efforts pursuant to CCP
§430.41. The declaration must be e-filed by no later than Monday, February 26,
2024.
