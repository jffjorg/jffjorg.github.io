as to Defendant MARIA GUADALUPE GONZALEZ’s Answer (filed on June 22, 2023) is GRANTED
without leave to amend. 
 
Moving Party to give notice. 
 
No Opposition filed as of January 12, 2024.  
 
Plaintiff’s Request for Judicial Notice is GRANTED. (Cal.
Ev. Code §452.) 
 
This action for
breach of contract was filed by Plaintiff LBS FINANICAL CREDIT UNION
(“Plaintiff”) on May 5, 2023. Plaintiff alleges that “[o]n or about September
16, 2022… GONZALEZ, for valuable consideration, made, executed, and delivered
to METRO ACURA a written Retail Installment Sale Contract (‘Contract’) for the
purchase of…a 2022 ACURA SH-AWD…. Pursuant to the Contract, GONZALEZ agreed to
pay for the Vehicle by making monthly payments for 84 months.” (Complaint ¶6.)  “On or about November 30, 2022… GONZALEZ
defaulted in the terms, conditions and covenants of the Contract by failing and
refusing to make the monthly payment then due and owing. Because of GONZALEZ’s
default in payments, Plaintiff has elected to declare the balance of the
Contract immediately due and payable.” (Contract ¶9.) 
 
Plaintiff asserts
the following causes of action: 
 
(1)
Breach
of Contract; 
(2)
Common
Count; 
(3)
Claim
and Deliver; 
(4)
Conversion;

(5)
Possession
of Personal Property; and 
(6)
Declaratory
Relief. 
 
On June 22, 2023,
Defendant MARIA GUADALUPE GONZALEZ (“Gonzalez”) (pro per) filed her Answer to
the Complaint. 
 
Plaintiff now moves
for judgment on the pleadings as to Defendant Gonzalez’s Answer. 
 
A motion for judgment on the pleadings has the same function
as a general demurrer, and the rules governing demurrers apply. (Smiley v.
Citibank (1995) 11 Cal.4th 138, 146.) 
 
CCP §431.30(b) states: “The answer to a complaint shall
contain: (1) the general or specific denial of the material allegations of the
complaint controverted by the defendant. (2) A statement of any new matter
constituting a defense.” (Id.) 
 
Here, Defendant’s Answer fails to either generally or
specifically deny any of Plaintiff’s causes of action, and instead attempts to
explain that Defendant Gonzalez signed for her son Defendant Solis to obtain
the subject vehicle, and that Solis is the one who should be held responsible
for payment. As indicated above, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant Gonzalez is
the holder of the note. 
 
CCP §430.20(a) states that a demurrer to an Answer is
properly sustained where, “[t]he answer does not state facts sufficient to
constitute a defense.” 
 
Plaintiff’s
unopposed Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings is GRANTED without leave
to amend for failure to state facts sufficient to constitute a defense. (CCP
§438(c)(1)A).) 
 
Defendant did not file an Opposition to this Motion. Therefore, the
Court knows of no basis to grant leave to amend.  The Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings as
to Defendant GONZALEZ’s Answer is GRANTED without leave to amend.
