HEARING:   01/18/24
#2
 
Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Further Responses to Requests for Production
(set one) is GRANTED in part. Plaintiff’s
request for sanctions is DENIED.
Moving Party to give notice.
 
Plaintiff moves for an order compelling further
responses to Requests for Production (set one).
Background
On
November 16, 2022, Plaintiff filed a Complaint against Defendants GEORGE
CHEVROLET; and GENERAL MOTORS LLC (“Defendants”) for violation of the
Song-Beverly Act and negligent repair.
Legal
Standard
CCP
§ 2031.310 allows a party to file a motion compelling further answers to
document requests if it finds that the response is inadequate, incomplete, or
evasive, or an objection in the response is without merit or too general.  The motion shall be accompanied with a meet
and confer declaration.  (CCP §
2031.310(b).)  
Discussion

Plaintiff seeks further responses to Requests
Nos. 16, 19-32, 37-41, and 45-46.
Requests Nos. 16, 19-32, and 45-46 are moot
because Defendant served further responses. (see Reply 1:15-24.)
Requests
Nos. 37-41 seek codes related to similar vehicles and customer complaints and
labor operations codes from vehicles that are the same year, make, and model as
Plaintiff’s vehicle. These requests are overboard because they seek information
not related to Plaintiff’s vehicle. Therefore, these requests will be limited
to codes related to repairs made to Plaintiff’s vehicle. Defendant is ORDERED
to provide further response to Requests Nos. 37-41 with the codes applicable to
repairs made to Plaintiff’s vehicle. 
Sanctions
The court shall impose a monetary sanction
against the party who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel
further responses to interrogatories or demand for production of documents
unless the party subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification
or the sanction would otherwise be unjust. (Code of Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300,
subd. (d), 2031.310, subd. (h), 2033.290, subd. (d).) 
The
Court finds that Defendant acted with substantial justification.
Accordingly,
Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Further Responses is GRANTED in part as set forth
above.
