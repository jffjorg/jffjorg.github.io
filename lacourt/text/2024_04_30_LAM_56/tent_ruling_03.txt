BACKGROUND 
 
  On May
18, 2023, Plaintiff Tohid Naeem (“Plaintiff”) filed the operative Complaint
against Defendant Nidal A. Barakat (“Defendant”) for Violations of Tenant
Anti-Harassment Ordinance.  On July 31, 2023, Defendant filed an
Answer.  
 
On January 12, 2024, Plaintiff filed a
Motion for Leave to File Second Amended Complaint. No opposition was filed to
the Motion; however, on January 31, 2024, this Court continued this matter to
allow Plaintiff to serve Defendant with the Motion and to give Defendant the
opportunity to respond.   
 
On February 7, 2024, Plaintiff filed another
Motion for Leave to File Second Amended Complaint. On March 19, 2024, this
Court again continued this matter to allow Plaintiff to serve Defendant with
the Motion and supporting documents at the address on record for Defendant. 
            
            On March 29, 2024,
Plaintiff filed the instant Motion for Leave to File Second Amended Complaint.
Plaintiff also filed proof of service by first-class mail at the address on
record for Defendant. No opposition has been filed as of April 26, 2024. 
 
DISCUSSION  
 
Code of Civil Procedure Section 473
permits the trial court in its discretion to allow amendments to pleadings in
the furtherance of justice. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (a)(1).) Code of
Civil Procedure Section 576 provides that any judge, at any time before or
after commencement of trial, in the furtherance of justice, and upon such terms
as may be proper, may allow the amendment of any pleading or pretrial
conference order. (Code Civ. Proc., § 576.) There is a policy of great
liberality in permitting amendments to the pleadings at any stage of the
proceeding. (Berman v. Bromberg (1997) 56 Cal.App.4th 936, 945.) An
application to amend a pleading is addressed to the trial judge’s sound
discretion. (Id.) If the motion to amend is timely made and the granting
of the motion will not prejudice the opposing party, it is error to refuse
permission to amend and where the refusal also results in a party being
deprived of the right to assert a meritorious cause of action or a meritorious
defense, it is not only error but an abuse of discretion. (Morgan v.
Superior Court of Cal. In and For Los Angeles County (1959) 172 Cal.App.2d
527, 530.) Where no prejudice is shown to the adverse party, the liberal rule
of allowance prevails. (Higgins v. Del Faro (1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 558,
564.) 
 
Under California Rules of Court
(“CRC”), Rule 3.1324, a motion for leave to amend a pleading must be
accompanied by a declaration that sets forth: (1) the effect of the amendment;
(2) why the amendment is necessary and proper; (3) when the facts giving rise
to the amended allegations were discovered; and (4) the reasons why the request
for amendment was not made sooner. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1324, subd.
(b).) 
 
A motion to amend a pleading
before trial must (1) include a copy of the proposed amendment or amended
pleading, which must be serially numbered to differentiate it from previous
pleadings or amendments; (2) state what allegations in the previous pleading
are proposed to be deleted, if any, and where, by page, paragraph and line
number, the deleted allegations are located; and (3) state what allegations are
proposed to be added to the previous pleading, if any, and where, by page,
paragraph, and line number, the additional allegations are located. (Cal. Rules
of Court, rule 3.1324(a).)
 
Here, the Minute Order of March 19,
2024 required Plaintiff to serve Defendant with the Motion and supporting
documents at the address on record for Defendant within five days of the
issuance of the order. On March 22, 2024, Plaintiff served Defendant with the
Motion and supporting documents at Defendant’s correct address. Therefore, the
Court finds Plaintiff has complied with the Minute Order of March 19, 2024. 
 
Further, the Motion is accompanied by
the Declaration of Plaintiff, which provides (1) the second amended complaint
is entirely different from the original complaint; (2) the amendment is
necessary and proper because the original complaint did not fully encompass the
scope of the issue; (3) the facts giving rise to the amended allegations were
not discovered until recently as Plaintiff regained access to an online
document and image storage account; and (4) the request for amendment was not
made earlier due to Plaintiff’s inability to retrieve relevant information
stored online and secure legal representation. (Declaration of Tohid Naeem, ¶¶ 2-5.) Thus, the Court finds Plaintiff
has complied with Rules of Court, rule 3.1324(b).
 
Lastly, the Motion includes a copy of the proposed amended
pleading. Since the proposed amended pleading is entirely different from the
original pleading (which merely states “Violations of Tenant Anti-Harassment Ordinance”), the Court finds that Plaintiff has complied with Rules
of Court, rule 3.1324(a) even though the Motion does not state what allegations
in the previous pleading are proposed to be deleted and where, and does not state
what allegations are proposed to be added to the previous pleading and where. 
 
Accordingly, the Motion for Leave to File Second Amended
Complaint filed by Tohid Naeem on March 29, 2024 is GRANTED. 
 
Moving Party is
ordered to give notice of this ruling.
 
Parties who intend to
submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at
SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed by the instructions provided on the court
website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive an email
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off
calendar. 
 
 
           Dated this 30th
day of April 2024
