 Case Number:  BS138171    Hearing Date:   April 24, 2024    Dept:  34 SUBJECT:        Motion to  Compel Further Responses to Special Interrogatories, Set 1 and Request for  Sanctions   Moving Party: Judgment  Creditor James Dalessandro Resp. Party:    Judgment Debtor Eric Mitchell            The Further SROGs Motion is GRANTED.           Judgment Debtor shall provide further  responses to the SROGs at issue within 10 days of the issuance of this Order.            Judgment Creditor’s Request for Monetary  Sanctions is DENIED.    BACKGROUND:   On July 10, 2012,  Petitioner Writers Guild of America, West Inc. filed its ADR-106, Petition to  Confirm Contractual Arbitration Award against Respondent Citizen Jane  Productions, LLC and Cibola Entertainment, LLC.    On March 1, 2013, the  Court approved the Petition and confirmed the Arbitrator’s Opinion and Award in  all respects.    On March 22, 2013,  the Court entered judgment in favor of Petitioner and against Respondents in  the total sum of $61,558.21.    On December 2, 2013,  Petitioner filed its Acknowledgement of Assignment of Judgment Pursuant to  C.C.P. §673, which acknowledged Petitioner’s assignment of Petitioner’s right,  title, and interest in the Judgment to James Dalessandro (“Judgment Creditor”).   On July 5, 2016, the  Court amended the Judgment such that Citizen Jane Production, LLC, Cibola  Entertainment, LLC, and Eric Albert Mitchell were jointly and severally liable  for the Judgment.    On September 11,  2017, the Court entered its Amended Judgment, awarding $61,558.21 in favor of  Judgment Creditor and against Judgment Debtors.      From September 11,  2017 to August 20, 2020, various sanctions and attorney’s fees awards were  granted in favor of Judgment Creditor, Judgment Debtor Eric Mitchell (“Judgment  Debtor”), or both Judgment Creditor and Judgment Debtor. All awards in favor of  Judgment Debtor have been acknowledged as fully satisfied. (See EJ-100s, filed:  July 31, 2017; December 22, 2017; December 26, 2017; January 8, 2019; March 21,  2019; September 13, 2019; August 5, 2020 [one for each of Judgment Creditor and  his Counsel]; and September 11, 2020.) However, not all awards in favor of  Judgment Creditor have been fully satisfied.    On February 9, 2021,  the Court awarded $24,633.30 in attorney’s fees and costs in favor of Judgment  Creditor and against Judgment Debtor.    On March 8, 2022,  Judgment Creditor filed his EJ-190, Application for and Renewal of Judgment.  Judgment Creditor (as assignee of record) applied for renewal of judgment in  the total amount of $192,200.81. This consisted of $52,277.21 for the judgment,  $39,993.60 for costs after judgment, $99,885.00 for interest after judgment,  and $45.00 for the EJ-190 filing fee. Item 5.a. to the EJ190 provided further  detail.    On November 29, 2023,  Judgment Debtor’s Counsel filed Notice of Withdrawal of Consent.    On March 12, 2024,  Judgment Creditor filed Motion to Compel Further Responses to Special  Interrogatories, Set 1 and Request for Sanctions (“Further SROGs Motion”). In  support of his Further SROGs Motion, Judgment Creditor concurrently filed: (1)  Declaration of E. Jay Gotfredson; (2) Judicial Council Form MC-050,  Substitution of Attorney—Civil; and (3) Proof of Service.    On March 29, 2024,  Judgment Debtor filed his Opposition to the Further SROGs Motion. In support of  his Opposition, Judgment Debtor concurrently filed Judicial Council Form  POS-050/EFS-050, Proof of Electronic Service.    On April 17, 2024,  Judgment Creditor filed his Reply in support of his Further SROGs Motion.    ANALYSIS:   I.           Legal  Standard   On receipt of a response  to form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and/or demand requests, the  propounding and/or demanding party “may move for an order compelling further  response” if: (1) the response is evasive or incomplete; (2) the representation  of inability to comply is inadequate, incomplete, or evasive; or (3) the  objection is without merit or too general. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300, subd.  (a), 2031.310, subd. (a).)   The court shall  impose monetary sanctions against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully  makes or opposes a motion to compel further interrogatories and/or a motion to  compel further production of documents, unless the Court finds that the one  subject to sanction acted with substantial justification or that other  circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust. (Code Civ. Proc., §§  2030.300, subd. (d), 2031.310, subd. (h).)   II.        Discussion   A.       The Parties’ Arguments   Judgment Creditor moves the Court to: (1) compel further responses to  certain special interrogatories (“SROGs”); and (2) award monetary sanctions in  favor of Judgment Creditor and against Judgment Debtor. (Further SROGs Motion,  p. 5:2–5.)   Judgment Debtor opposes the Further SROGs Motion, arguing: (1) that there  is no evidence of service of the interrogatories; (2) that the proof of service  for the interrogatories does not comply with the requirements for service by  mail; (3) that the failure to follow the rules for service by mail negates the  service; (4) that the proof of service does not comply with the requirements  for electronic service; (5) that discovery cannot be electronically served  because electronic service only applies to documents filed with the Court; (6)  that the responses to the SROGs were timely served; and (7) that sanctions are  not appropriate against Judgment Debtor. (Opposition, pp. 2:2, 2:10-11, 3:4,  3:15–16, 3:26–27, 6:1, 6:10.)           Judgment Creditor reiterates his  arguments in his Reply.    B.       The  Relevant Timeline           The following is the relevant timeline:   (1)        on October 20, 2023, Judgment Creditor’s Counsel  served the SROGs at issue on Judgment Debtor;   (2)        on November 25, 2023, Judgment Debtor served initial  responses to the SROGs;   (3)        on November 29, 2023, Judgment Debtor’s Counsel  filed Notice of Withdrawal of Consent;    (4)        on December 13, 2023, Judgment Creditor requested  further responses to the SROGs;   (5)        on December 22, 2023, Judgment Debtor served further  responses to the SROGs;   (6)        on January 8, 2024, Judgment Creditor requested  further responses to the SROGs;   (7)        on January 22, 2024, Judgment Debtor served further  responses to the SROGs;    (8)        on January 31, 2024, Judgment Creditor requested  further responses to the SROGs; and   (9)        as of the hearing on the Further SROGs Motion, there  is no evidence that Judgment Debtor has served further responses to the SROGs.    (Decl. Gotfredson,  Exhs. A–G.)   C.           Judgment Debtor Waived Any Issue with the Unsigned  Proof of Service   Judgment Debtor points to the unsigned Proof of Service in Exhibit A in  the Declaration of E. Jay Gotfredson, arguing that this is “fatal to the  Motion.” (Opposition, p. 2:9.)    Not so.    Exhibit A is merely evidence that interrogatories were sent to Judgment  Debtor. Thus, if Judgment Creditor came to the Court with a request for an  order compelling initial responses to the SROGs without signed proof of  service, Judgment Debtor would have a meritorious procedural argument.  Furthermore, subsequent evidence demonstrates that Judgment Debtor did in fact  respond to the initial SROGs.  In fact, Judgement  Debtor specifically states that he received and responded to the interrogatories.  (Opposition, p. 6:3-4.)    Regardless, the motion at hand involves further responses to these  SROGs, not initial responses these SROGs. (See Further SROGs  Motion, p. 1:13–15.) Although Judgment Creditor’s Counsel may not have done a  stellar job of writing a motion to compel further responses to these  SROGs — e.g., he cited portions of the Code of Civil Procedure that involve  initial responses to interrogatories and ignored portions of the Code that  involve further responses to interrogatories — that does not mean Judgment  Debtor automatically prevails on any issue that involves further  responses to these SROGs. (See Further SROGs Motion, p. 4, incorrectly citing  Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subds. (a)–(b) instead of § 2030.300, subd. (a).)  While the memorandum to the Further SROGs Motion appears to be copied and  pasted from an earlier motion that requested initial responses to  interrogatories (see, e.g., Motion, p. 3:23-25), the Court is able to discern  from the Declaration of E. Jay Gotfredson and the various exhibits attached  that further responses to the SROGs are what Judgment Creditor actually seeks  at this time.    In short, by actually providing initial responses to the SROGs, Judgment  Debtor waived any service issue as to initial receipt of the SROGs. Therefore,  as Judgment Debtor has waived any service issue as to initial receipt of the  SROGs, such an issue cannot be a basis for a subsequent procedural issue with  Judgment Creditor’s request for further responses to the SROGs.    D.          There are No Subsequent Procedural Issues with  Service           Judgment Debtor makes multiple arguments  about subsequent issues with mail and electronic service. However, all of these  arguments are predicated on an alleged initial unsigned proof of service and  the initial response to the SROGs, not the outstanding further responses to the  SROGs. (Opposition, pp. 2:10–11, 3:4, 3:26–27, 6:1.)  For the same reasons discussed above, these  arguments are not meritorious.    The Court is also aware that on November 29, 2023, Judgment Debtor’s  then-Counsel, D. Joshua Staub, filed “Notice of Withdrawal of Consent.” The  Notice stated that then-Counsel Staub “revokes the consent to receive service  for judgment debtor Eric Mitchell under Code of Civil Procedure section  684.020.” (Notice of Withdrawal of Consent, p. 2:1–3.)   Thus, as of November 29, 2023, papers had to be served on Judgment  Debtor, not on Judgment Debtor’s then-Counsel.            The Court points out that each of the  requests for further responses sent by Judgment Creditor’s Counsel appear to  have been sent to Judgment Debtor by mail (with no evidence submitted that  these requests were sent to Judgment Debtor by electronic service). (Decl.  Gotfredson, Exhs. C, E, G.) It is irrelevant that Judgment Debtor’s  then-Counsel was also provided with copies of these requests electronically. (Ibid.)     E.       Further Responses are Appropriate   Judgment Creditor propounded dozens of SROGs on Judgment Debtor. (Decl.  Gotfredson, Exh. A.) Judgment Debtor has repeatedly served boilerplate  objections that are largely evasive. (See, for example, Decl. Gotfredson, Exh.  F.) Judgment Creditor timely requested further responses. (Decl. Gotfredson,  Exh. G.)  In fact, Judgement Debtor has  avoided paying his debt for more than a decade.                   The Court GRANTS the Further SROGs  Motion.            Judgment Debtor shall provide further  responses to the SROGs at issue within 10 days of the issuance of this Order.    F.        Sanctions   Judgment Debtor now appears to be litigating this matter in propria  persona. (See MC-050.) Issuing monetary sanctions on Judgment Debtor, who  must navigate enforcement matters without the aid of counsel, would not be  appropriate. Should Judgement Debtor again retain counsel, or continue to evade  his responsibility for paying this judgment, the Court might reconsider the  issue of sanctions in a future motion.           The Court DENIES Judgment Creditor’s  Request for Monetary Sanctions.    III.      Conclusion   The Further SROGs Motion is GRANTED.           Judgment Debtor shall provide further  responses to the SROGs at issue within 10 days of the issuance of this Order.            Judgment Creditor’s Request for Monetary  Sanctions is DENIED.
