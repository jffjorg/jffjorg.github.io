And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The court has decided to dismiss the case without prejudice due to the repeated deceptions by the plaintiff's counsel. The counsel had falsely stated that the defendants had been served, which was later revealed to be untrue. The counsel had also requested a continuance based on medical reasons, but failed to inform the court that the trial could not proceed due to the lack of service. As a result, the court has dismissed the case without prejudice.
