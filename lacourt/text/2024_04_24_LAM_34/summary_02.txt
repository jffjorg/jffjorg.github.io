Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants Defendant Kim Sill's anti-SLAPP motion, strikes her from the Complaint, and allows her to move for attorney's fees and costs. The judge finds that Defendant Sill's speech and conduct are protected under the anti-SLAPP statute. The judge also denies Defendant Sill's Motion for Undertaking and takes off calendar the Demurrer and Motion to Strike, as the court lacks jurisdiction to hear these motions since Defendant Sill has been struck from the Complaint.
