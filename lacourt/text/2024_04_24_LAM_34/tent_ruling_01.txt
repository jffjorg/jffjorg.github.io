  Case Number:  22STCV29829    Hearing Date:   April 24, 2024    Dept:  34  
        This case was
filed on September 13, 2022.  
 
At the first Case Management
Conference on January 11, 2023, One day prior to the CMC, Plaintiffs filed their
CMS, indicating that all defendants had been served.  (See Plaintiff’s CMS, filed 1/10/23, §3(a).) Plaintiff’s
counsel also orally informed the Court at the CMC that all the Defendants had
been served.  
 
        Nonetheless,
the Court continued the CMC until February 16, 2023 because Plaintiff had not
filed proofs of service.  At the CMC on
February 16, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel orally informed the Court that the
Defendants had been served in September.  (See also, Plaintiff’s CMS, filed 2/2/3, §3(a),
where Plaintiff checked the box that all defendants had been served.) Based on
Plaintiffs’ counsel’s representations, the Court scheduled a Final Status
Conference for April 24, 2024 and a five-day jury trial for May 6, 2024.
 
        On February 15,
2023, Plaintiff’s counsel submitted a declaration asking for a 30-60 day
continuance of the trial because his mother had recently died.  The Court granted the request for a
continuance on February 16, 2023.
 
        On March 21,
2023, Plaintiff requested entries of default against defendants.  These requests were rejected by the Clerk on
March 22, 2023.
 
        At today’s Final
Status Conference, Plaintiff’s counsel informed the Court that none of the
Defendants had actually been served.  In
other words, Plaintiff’s counsel had lied to or misled the Court on three separate
occasions:  twice when he stated (both
orally and in Plaintiffs’ CMS’s) that defendants had been served; and once on
2/15/2023, when he asked for a 30-60 day continuance of the trial based on
medical reasons – and not informing the Court that trial could not take place because
defendants had never been served.
 
        Plaintiff also
failed to file any FSC documents for today’s hearing as required by the Court.
 
        Because of
Plaintiff’s counsel’s repeated deceptions, and because Plaintiff is unprepared
to proceed to trial, the Court DISMISSES the case without prejudice.
 
        Plaintiff to
give notice.
