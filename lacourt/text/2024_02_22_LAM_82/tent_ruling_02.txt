Case:               Vista Charter Public Schools
v. California State Board of Education (23STCP04041)
  
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Respondent California State Board of Education’s Demurrer to
Petition for Writ of Mandate is SUSTAINED IN PART.
 
I.                  
REQUEST FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE
 
Petitioner Vista Charter Public Schools’ request for
judicial notice of Exhibit A (7/9/19 California Senate Education Committee
Report re: AB 15050 is GRANTED, pursuant to Evidence Code § 452(c), but only
for the existence of the document and not the truth of the matters contained
therein. (Arce v. Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, Inc. (2010) 181
Cal.App.4th 417, 484).
 
II.               
SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION: WRIT OF MANDATE (CCP §
1085)
 
Respondent SBE demurs to the second cause of action under
CCP § 1085 on the ground that petitioner has not stated a ministerial duty that
respondent failed to perform. 
 
A writ of mandate pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 1085 is available when: (1) the petitioner has “no plain, speedy, and
adequate alternative remedy”; (2) the respondent has “a clear, present and
usually ministerial duty to perform”; and (3) the petitioner has “a clear,
present and beneficial right to performance.” (Conlan v. Bonta (2002)
102 Cal.App.4th 745, 751-52.)
 
“‘Discretionary acts
are those wherein there is no hard and fast rule as to the course of conduct
that one must or must not take and, if there is a clearly defined rule, such
would eliminate discretion.’ [Citation.] A duty is ministerial when it is the doing
of a thing unqualifiedly required. [Citation.]” (Redwood Coast Watersheds
Alliance v. State Bd. of Forestry and Fire Protection (1999) 70 Cal.App.4th
962, 970.) 
 
Respondent SBE refers to Education Code § 47605(k)(2)(E),
which governs SBE’s review of denials of charter petitions by county boards of
education. Section 47605(k)(2)(E) states in relevant part:
 
The state board shall either hear the
appeal or summarily deny review of the appeal based on the documentary record.
If the state board hears the appeal, the state board may affirm the
determination of the governing board of the school district or the county board
of education, or both of those determinations, or may reverse only upon a
determination that there was an abuse of discretion….
 
(Ed. Code § 47605(k)(2)(E).) 
SBE contends that the statute governing its consideration of
petitioner’s appeal does not prescribe any mandatory course of action, as it
could have summarily denied review of the appeal.
 
However, a traditional
writ of mandate is available not just to enforce ministerial duties but also 
“when a public
agency has abused its discretion in carrying out a discretionary function.” (CV
Amalgamated LLC v. City of Chula Vista (2022) 82 Cal.App.5th 265, 279.) The
manner in which SBE’s exercises its discretionary powers is not beyond judicial
review. (Manjares v. Newton (1966) 64 Cal.2d 365, 370 [“That mandate
will lie whenever an administrative board has abused its discretion is a rule
so well established as to be beyond question”].) “Mandamus may also issue to
correct the exercise of discretionary legislative power, but only where the
action amounts to an abuse of discretion as a matter of law because it is so
palpably unreasonable and arbitrary.” (Ellena v. Department of Ins.
(2014) 230 Cal.App.4th 198, 206.) “[T]he judicial inquiry in an ordinary
mandamus proceeding addresses whether the public entity’s action was arbitrary,
capricious or entirely without evidentiary support, and whether it failed to
conform to procedures required by law.” (California Public Records Research,
Inc. v. County of Stanislaus (2016) 246 Cal.App.4th 1432, 1443.) 
 
Petitioner alleges that SBE elected to hear petitioner’s
appeal but acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner by failing to review Los
Angeles Unified School District (“LAUSD”) or the Los Angeles County Board of
Education’s (“County”) denials of petitioner’s charter petition based on the
appropriate legal standard. (Pet. ¶ 30.) Specifically, LAUSD is alleged to have
found that petitioner was demonstrably unlikely to serve the entire community
in which it proposed to locate. (Pet. ¶ 25.) For a finding that the charter
school is demonstrably unlikely to serve the interests of the entire community
in which the school is proposing to locate, a written finding “shall detail
specific facts and circumstances that analyze and consider…[t]he extent to
which the proposed charter school would substantially undermine existing
services, academic offerings, or programmatic offerings.” (Ed. Code § 47605(c)(7).)
It is alleged that LAUSD’s entire documentary record fails to mention the
“substantially undermine” standard, except in referencing petitioner’s letter
explaining the standard, and does not detail specific facts explaining how
petitioner’s proposed charter school would “substantially undermine” LAUSD’s
existing services. (Pet. ¶¶ 25, 26.) LACBOE allegedly repeated the flawed
reasoning of LAUSD regarding whether its services would be substantially
undermined. (Pet. ¶ 27.)
 
Not only does petitioner allege that SBE failed to mention
the term “substantially undermine” in affirming LAUSD and LACBOE’s denial of
petitioner’s charter petition, but petitioner further alleges that SBE instead applied
an “undermine” or “impact” standard when reviewing the denials by LAUSD and
County. (Pet. ¶ 30(a).) While Education Code § 47605(k)(2)(E) did not set forth
any specific factors SBE must consider in deciding whether to affirm the lower
decisions, as argued by SBE in the reply (Reply at 3:3-12), the issue is not
whether SBE was required to exercise its discretion in a particular manner, but
whether the way in which SBE did exercise its discretion in its review of the
lower decisions was arbitrary, capricious, entirely without evidentiary
support, and/or failed to conform to procedures required by law. (California Public Records Research, 246
Cal.App.4th at 1443.)
 
Whether SBE’s alleged
failure to acknowledge or apply the correct legal standard, as well as the
other actions and omissions purportedly committed by SBE (Pet. ¶ 30(a-f))
justifies traditional mandate relief are issues that must be resolved at the
trial on the writ petition. 
 
The demurrer to the second cause of action is OVERRULED.
 
III.            
FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION: WRIT OF MANDATE (CCP § 1094.5)
 
Respondent SBE demurs to the first cause of action under CCP
§ 1094.5 on the ground that Education Code § 47605(k)(2) does not require a
hearing or require that evidence be taken. 
 
CCP § 1094.5 is
applicable to “any final administrative order or decision made as the result of
a proceeding in which by law a hearing is required to be given, evidence is required to be taken, and
discretion in the determination of facts is vested in the inferior tribunal….”
(CCP § 1094.5(a).) None of the required elements for review under CCP §
1094.5 are present here. Education Code § 47605(k)(2), which governs
SBE’s review of denials of charter petitions by county boards of education,
does not require any evidentiary hearing. Under Education Code § 47605(k)(2)(E),
SBE may “summarily deny review of the appeal based on the documentary record”
without giving a hearing or taking evidence. If SBE elects to hear the appeal,
it has the discretion to affirm the denial or reverse the denial if it finds an
abuse of discretion. 
 
Petitioner argues that “purely documentary proceedings can
satisfy the hearing requirement of Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5, so
long as the agency is required by law to accept and consider evidence from
interested parties before making its decision.” (Friends of the Old Trees v.
Department of Forestry & Fire Protection (1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 1383,
1391.) Education Code § 47605(k)(2)(D) requires SBE’s Advisory Commission on
Charter Schools (“ACCE”) to “hold a public hearing to review the appeal and
documentary record,” after which it must recommend to SBE “whether there is
sufficient evidence to hear the appeal or to summarily deny review of the
appeal based on the documentary record.” Education Code § 47605(k)(2)(E)
requires SBE to “either hear the appeal or summarily deny review of the appeal
based on the documentary record.” While section 47605(k)(2)(D) and
47605(k)(2)(E) require review of a documentary record, this required review is
only with respect to the decision on whether to hear the appeal, not in rendering
a decision on the appeal.
 
In hearing the appeal, neither section 47605(k)(2)(D) nor
47605(k)(2)(E) require SBE to accept and consider evidence from interested
parties before deciding whether to affirm or reverse the denial of the charter
petition—this is the decision for which petitioner seeks review by this court. (Cf.
Friends of the Old Trees, 52 Cal.App.4th at 1392 [hearing requirement under
CCP § 1094.5 satisfied with opportunities for public and agency comment and agency
obligation to respond in writing]; Eureka Teachers Assn. v. Board of
Education (1988) 199 Cal.App.3d 353, 363 [hearing requirement under CCP §
1094.5 found where people designated under statute at issue attended meeting, evidence
was presented, and board had authority to take action].) Rather, section
47605(k)(2)(E) only requires SBE to exercise its discretion to affirm or reverse
LAUSD and LACBOE’s denials of the subject charter petition and does not require
SBE to hold any hearing where evidence can be received in so doing. 
 
Whether SBE abused its discretion to affirm or reverse under
Education Code § 47605(k)(2)(E) is judicially reviewable under CCP § 1085 for
the reasons stated above. However, SBE’s decision to affirm the denials of petitioner’s
charter petition is not judicially reviewable under CCP § 1094.5, because no evidentiary
hearing was required under Education Code § 47605(k)(2).
 
The demurrer to the second cause of action is SUSTAINED.
 
IV.            
CONCLUSION
 
The demurrer to the second cause of action based on CCP §
1085 is OVERRULED.  The demurrer to the
first cause of action based on CCP § 1094.5 is SUSTAINED.  Although petitioner requests “that it be
granted leave to amend so that [it] may address any findings related to the
sufficiency of its allegations” (Opposition Br. at 18), petitioner does not
proffer how it might reasonably cure the pleading defects raised in the
demurrer.  Before deciding whether to
allow leave to amend as to first cause of action, the Court will hear from
petitioner regarding whether any amendment can remedy the defect set forth
above.
