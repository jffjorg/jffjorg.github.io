[1]           Because a stay would not serve the public interest, the
Court does not address 7-Eleven’s due process and fair hearing arguments,
including that, before the Decision was issued, (1) the City did not disclose
that it had conducted a field investigation on May 5, 2022 and (2) the City did
not make any findings regarding prior governmental efforts to address the
nuisance or 7-Eleven’s willingness to address the nuisance, as purportedly
required under the Los Angeles Municipal Code. These issues are reserved for
the trial on 7-Eleven’s petition for writ of administrative mandate.
