Summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a writ of mandate petition filed by Vista Charter Public Schools against the California State Board of Education (SBE). The petition seeks to overturn SBE's affirmation of denials by the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) and the Los Angeles County Board of Education (LACBOE) of Vista Charter Public Schools' charter petition. The judge has sustained in part SBE's demurrer to the petition, finding that SBE did not abuse its discretion in affirming the denials under Education Code § 47605(k)(2)(E). However, the judge has overruled SBE's demurrer to the second cause of action, finding that Vista Charter Public Schools has stated a claim for traditional writ of mandate relief. The judge has also sustained SBE's demurrer to the first cause of action, finding that CCP § 1094.5 does not apply because no evidentiary hearing was required under Education Code § 47605(k)(2)(E).
