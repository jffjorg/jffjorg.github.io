RULING: The motions are granted as set forth
below.   
 
SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises out of an alleged fall that occurred
while Plaintiff Phyllis Ginolfi (Plaintiff) 
attended Defendant/Cross-Complainant HDL, Inc. dba
Pacoima Adult Day Care’s (HDL) adult day care facility on 8/20/19.  On 8/20/19, Plaintiff was transported to and
from HDL’s facility by a paratransit van operated by Defendant/Cross-Defendant
Keolis Transit America, Inc. (Keolis).   
 
On 6/7/21, Plaintiff filed this action against HDL and Defendant/Cross-Defendant
Right Choice In-Home Care, Inc. for: (1) Dependent Adult/Elder Abuse and (2)
Negligence.  Keolis was later named in
place of Doe 1.  
 
On 11/6/23, HDL propounded its first set of written
discovery (Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories and Requests for
Production of Documents) on Keolis making responses due on 12/8/23.  (D’Andrea Decls.).  Keolis did not serve responses nor request an
extension of time to respond.  Id.  On 12/15/23, HDL’s counsel contacted Keolis’
counsel regarding the discovery responses requesting responses without
objections by 12/22/23.  Id.  In response, Keolis’ counsel requested that
the discovery requests be re-sent which HDL’s counsel did that day.  Id. 
No responses were received by 12/22/23. 
Id.
 
On 12/27/23, HDL’s counsel contacted Keolis’ counsel
again and requested responses, without objections, by 1/5/24.  Id. 
On 12/28/23, Keolis’ counsel indicated responses would be provided;
however, no responses were ever served.  Id.  Again, no responses were received by the
1/5/24 deadline nor the 1/19/24 deadline later agreed upon by counsel.  Id.
 
Therefore, on 2/28/24, HDL filed and served, on Keolis’s
counsel at the time, the instant motions seeking: (1)  An order compelling Keolis to provide verified
responses, without objections, to HDL’s Form Interrogatories, Set 1.  Additionally, HDL requests sanctions against
Keolis in the amount of $706.00; 
 
(2) An order compelling Keolis to provide verified
responses, without objections, to HDL’s Special Interrogatories, Set 1.  Additionally, HDL requests sanctions against
Keolis in the amount of $706.00; and 
 
(3) An order compelling Keolis to provide verified
responses, without objections, to HDL’s Requests for Production of Documents,
Set 1.  Additionally, HDL requests
sanctions against Keolis in the amount of $725.00.  
 
Keolis has not opposed nor otherwise responded to the
instant motions.  The Court notes that on
5/3/24, Keolis filed a substitution of attorney (the attorney, Jeffrey M.
Lenkov, representing Keolis appears to have changed firms and taken Keolis as
client with him) and on 5/8/24, Keolis filed an Application for Determination
of Good Faith Settlement which was withdrawn on 5/20/24.  (See Application filed on 5/8/24 &
Notice of Withdrawal filed on 5/20/24).
 
ANALYSIS
 
Due to Keolis’ failure to provide timely responses to the
subject Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories and Requests for
Production of Documents and Things, HDL is entitled to orders compelling
responses without objections.  CCP
2030.290(a), (b); CCP 2031.300(a), (b).  Additionally,
HDL is entitled to sanctions against Keolis for its failure to comply with its
discovery obligations.  CCP 2023.030(a); 2030.290(c);
CCP 2031.300(c).  Sanctions are awarded
on the amount of $1,187.00 for all three motions calculated at (4.3 hours to
prepare all three motions + 1 hour to prepare for and appear at the hearing
multiplied by $190/hour = $1,007.00 + $180.00 in filing fees ($60.00 for each
motion)).  (See D’Andrea Decls.
¶18).
 
CONCLUSION
 
The motions are granted. 
Responses, without objections, are due and sanctions are payable within
30 days.
