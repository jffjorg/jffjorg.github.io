And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling denying the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to requests for production of documents. The motion was filed by Emilio Reyes, the plaintiff, and opposed by Lorraine Ann Escobar, the defendant. The court finds that the discovery motion cutoff date passed on April 30, 2024, and since the plaintiff did not file a motion requesting that the court reopen discovery, the court does not have the authority to hear the motion. The court also denies the plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions against the defendant in the amount of $310.66. The court orders the defendant to give notice of this ruling.
