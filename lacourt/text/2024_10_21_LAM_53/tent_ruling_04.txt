PLAINTIFF’S MOTION FOR ATTORNEY’S FEES
Plaintiff Bonnie Duboff (“Plaintiff”) moves the court for an order
awarding her attorney’s fees and costs, to be paid from the recovery obtained by
the limited partnership, 245 Spalding Partners, L.P., in this action.  Defendant Linda Schermer, individually, as
trustee of the Surviving Trustor’s Trust under the Schermer Family Trust, as
trustee of the Deceased Trustor’s Trust under the Schermer Family Trust, and as
trustee of the Marital Trust under the Schermer Family Trust (“Defendant”) has opposed
the motion. 
First, the court (1) finds that Plaintiff’s derivative action was
successful, and therefore  (2) exercises
its discretion to award to Plaintiff reasonable expenses, including attorney’s
fees, from the recovery obtained by 245 Spalding Partners, L.P. in this action.

“If a derivative action is successful in whole or in part, the court
may award the plaintiff reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorney’s
fees, from the recovery of the limited partnership.”  (Corp. Code, § 15910.05, subd. (b).)  
The court finds, based on a review of Plaintiff’s Complaint, the
court’s Statements of Decision, and the Judgment entered in this action, that Plaintiff’s
action is derivative.  (Compl., ¶¶ 1
[“Plaintiff brings this action as a derivative action on behalf of 245 Spalding
Partners, L.P.], 21 [“Plaintiff brings this action, in part, derivatively in
the right, and for the benefit, of 245 Spalding Partners, L.P. . . .”]; Compl.,
pp. 24:15-18 [asserting first cause of action “by Plaintiff Derivatively”],
26:13-16 [asserting second cause of action “by Plaintiff Derivatively”], 27:1-5
[asserting third cause of action “by Plaintiff Derivatively”], 28:1-5
[asserting fourth cause of action “by Plaintiff Derivatively”], 28:22-26
[asserting fifth cause of action “by Plaintiff Derivatively”], 29:16-20
[asserting sixth cause of action “by Plaintiff Derivatively”], 30:9-13
[asserting seventh cause of action “by Plaintiff Derivatively”]; Statement of
Decision (Phase Two), pp. 24:15-25:4 [finding in favor of Plaintiff and awarding
to Plaintiff, derivatively on behalf of 245 Spalding Partners, L.P., damages
and restitution]; Oct. 9, 2023 Judgment, pp. 3:1-5, 3:10-14, 5:3-7 [finding in
favor of Plaintiff, derivatively on behalf of 245 Spalding Partners LP].)  The court notes that Defendant contends that
Plaintiff may not recover attorney’s fees because she “only sought to advance
her own personal interests and did not advance the interests of a class of
others.”  (Opp., p. 2:18-20 [emphasis in
original omitted].)  The court disagrees.

The court acknowledges that, when evaluating a request for attorney’s
fees pursuant to the common fund or substantial benefit principles, a court may
decline to award attorney’s fees if the movant’s objective was not to secure a
common fund but to establish personal adverse interests.  (Baker v. Pratt (1986) 76 Cal.App.3d
370, 379; Cziraki v. Thunder Cats, Inc. (2003) 111 Cal.App.4th 552, 563
[“When a corporation is the sole beneficiary of a derivative shareholder suit,
we conclude it should bear the costs associated with obtaining that benefit”].)  However, as noted by Plaintiff, the common
fund and substantial benefit theories provide for the recovery of attorney’s
fees separate from Corporations Code section 15910.05.  Even if the court were to find that the
reasoning set forth in the cases discussing those theories could be applied
here, Defendant has not shown, and the court does not find, that Plaintiff
obtained personal interests adverse to 245 Spalding Partners, L.P., such that
the court should exercise its discretion to deny Plaintiff’s request for
attorney’s fees.  (Corp. Code, §
15910.05, subd. (b) [“the court may award” a successful plaintiff in a
derivative action reasonable expenses] [emphasis added].) 
The court further finds that (1) Plaintiff’s derivative action was
successful, and (2) it is equitable to award Plaintiff reasonable expenses
incurred in litigating this action. 
(Oct. 9, 2023 Judgment, p. 5:3-16 [awarding damages in favor of
Plaintiff, derivatively on behalf of 245 Spading Partners, L.P., and against
Defendant in the amount of $5,930,072]; Corp. Code, § 15910.05, subd. (b).)  The court therefore exercises its discretion
to award Plaintiff reasonable expenses from the recovery obtained by 245
Spalding Partners, LP.  (Corp. Code, §
15910.05, subd. (b).)
Second, the court finds that Plaintiff has established a lodestar
amount of $775,162.50.
“[T]he fee setting inquiry in California ordinarily begins with the
‘lodestar,’ i.e., the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by the
reasonable hourly rate. . . . .¿ The reasonable hourly rate is that prevailing
in the community for similar work.¿ The lodestar figure may then be adjusted,
based on consideration of factors specific to the case, in order to fix the fee
at the fair market value for the legal services provided.”¿ (PLCM Group v.
Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095 (internal citations omitted).)¿ “[T]he
verified time statements of the attorneys, as officers of the court, are
entitled to credence in the absence of a clear indication the records are
erroneous.”¿ (Horsford v. Board of Trustees of California State Univ.
(2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 359, 396.)¿¿¿ 
Plaintiff has submitted the declarations of attorneys Stephen D.
Weisskopf and David C. Nelson, in which counsel attest to the qualifications,
skill, and experience of the attorneys and legal staff that worked on this
action.  (Weisskopf Decl., ¶¶ 4-7
[attesting to his qualifications], 10-15 [attesting to the qualifications of
counsel and legal staff from his firm]; Nelson Decl., ¶¶ 4, 6 [attesting to his
qualifications and hourly rates], 10-12 [attesting to qualifications and rates
of other attorneys at Loeb & Loeb LLP].) 
The court finds that the hourly rates requested ($375 as to attorney
Weisskopf; $375 as to attorney Kent; $250 to $325 for attorney Daubs; $250 for
attorney Stiner; $150-175 for Charne as a paralegal and $275 as an associate;
$200-$225 for attorney Ovespian; $175 for paralegal Spicher; $150 for paralegal
Bevan; $845-$1,095 for attorney Nelson; $780 for attorney Vidal; $690 for
attorney Givens; and $965 for attorney Catalano) are reasonable in light of the
qualifications, experience, and skill of counsel. 
The court has reviewed the billing statements submitted by Plaintiff’s
attorneys, Defendant’s opposition, and the declaration of André Jardini
submitted by Defendant in support of her opposition to this motion.  The court finds that (1) of the 59.3 hours
billed by attorney Weisskopf to prepare the moving papers in connection with
Plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment, 19.3 of those hours were not
reasonably expended; (2) of the 12.3 hours billed by attorney Stiner to oppose
Defendant’s motion to file an amended answer, 2.0 of those hours were not
reasonably expended; (3) of the 23 hours billed by attorney Stiner to prepare
the reply to the motion for summary judgment, 5 of those hours were not
reasonably expended; (4) of the total 10.8 hours billed by attorney Weisskopf to
file a reply to the motion for sanctions and preliminary injunction, 2.8 of
those hours were not reasonably incurred; (5) of the total 8.8 hours billed by
attorney Stiner to file a reply to the motion for sanctions and preliminary
injunction, 2.4 of those hours were not reasonably expended; (6) of the 8.1
hours billed by attorney Stiner to oppose the motion to transfer, 4.1 of those
hours were not reasonably expended; and (7) of the 16.3 hours billed by paralegal
Bevan to draft the memorandum of costs, 3.3 of those hours were not reasonably
expended.  (Weisskopf Decl., Ex. A.) 
The court finds that the work performed and hours billed by attorneys
at Loeb & Loeb LLP were reasonable because Plaintiff has submitted evidence
establishing that Defendant attempted to transfer this action to the Probate
Court or to relate this action to another case pending in the Probate Court,
such that the court finds that it was reasonable for Plaintiff to engage
additional attorneys with experience with probate and trust matters.  (Weisskopf Decl., ¶ 17; Nelson Decl., ¶ 7;
Jardini Decl., ¶¶ 46, 79 [requesting the fees incurred by Loeb & Loeb LLP
be excluded].)  The court also finds that
(1) the staffing of attorneys was not unreasonable and therefore declines to decrease
the award by 10.3 percent as requested by Defendant, and (2) the entries to
which Defendant objects as vague are not vague since they sufficiently describe
the work performed (e.g., preparation for trial).  (Jardini Decl., ¶¶ 62-68; Jardini Decl., p.
76 [Vague Billing].)  
The court finds, and Plaintiff does not appear to dispute, that Plaintiff’s
attorneys erroneously billed for identical charges on March 16, 2022.  The court therefore excludes from the
lodestar 0.30 hours billed by attorney Kent. 
(Jardini Decl., p. 78 [Error Billing].)  However, the court finds that Defendant has
not shown that the April 1, 2018 entries by attorney Stiner were
duplicative.  Specifically, although
Stiner had two entries described as “Research and analyze issues re
standing[,]” Stiner separately billed 1.10 hours and 3.10 hours for such time,
and therefore does not appear to have been an erroneously duplicative
charge.  (Ibid.; Weisskopf Decl.,
Ex. A, p. 150.) 
The court therefore finds that Plaintiff has established that her
attorneys reasonably expended 2,231.3 hours in litigating this action (58.2
hours expended by Loeb & Loeb LLP and 2,170.8 hours expended by LevatoLaw).  Thus, the court finds that Plaintiff has
established a lodestar figure of $775,162.50 and grants Plaintiff’s motion to
award her attorney’s fees in that amount, to be paid from the recovery obtained
by 245 Spalding Partners, L.P.
 
DEFENDANT’S
MOTION TO TAX COSTS
On October 27, 2023, Plaintiff filed a Memorandum of Costs, claiming
$51,981.47 in costs.  Defendant now moves
the court for an order striking from Plaintiff’s Memorandum of Costs (1) a
total of $1,103.20 in filing fees (Item 1g); (2) a total of $214.36 in service
of process fees (Item 5d); (3) $11,364.60 in court ordered transcripts (Item
9); (4) attorney’s fees (Item 10); and (5) a total of $528.96 in electronic
filing or service fees (Item 14). 
“‘If the items appearing in a cost bill appear to be proper charges,
the burden is on the party seeking to tax costs to show that they were not
reasonable or necessary.  On the other
hand, if the items are properly objected to, they are put in issue and the
burden of proof is on the party claiming them as costs.’”  (Lowry v. Port San Luis Harbor District (2020)
56 Cal.App.5th 211, 222 [internal citation omitted].) 
            The court finds that Defendant has
not met her burden to show that the costs incurred in connection with filing
fees, service of process fees, and electronic filing or service fees, even
though incurred to file and serve motions on which Plaintiff did not prevail,
were not reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation, and therefore
denies Defendant’s motion to tax $1,041.65 in filing fees, $112.76 in service
of process fees, and $528.96 in electronic filing or service fees.  (Lowry, supra, 56 Cal.App.5th
at p. 222; MC-010, ¶¶ 1, 5, 14; Bohm Decl., ¶ 4 [asserting that these costs are
associated with unsuccessful motions and ex parte applications].) 
            The court finds that Defendant has
met her burden to show that the $61.55 in court reservation fees to reserve a hearing
for a motion for a preliminary injunction that Plaintiff did not file was not
reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation and therefore grants
Defendant’s motion to tax those costs. 
(Bohm Decl., ¶ 4; Opp., p. 2:12-13 [withdrawing that request for
costs].) 
            The court grants Defendant’s motion
to tax the request for $101.54 in costs to serve supplemental discovery because
Plaintiff appears to concede that it was not reasonably necessary to the
conduct of the litigation.  (Opp., p.
2:13-14 [withdrawing that request for costs].) 
            The court denies as moot Defendant’s
motion to tax the request for attorney’s fees because the court has concluded
that Plaintiff may be awarded attorney’s fees pursuant to Corporations Code
section 15910.05 for the reasons set forth above.  (MC-010, ¶ 10 [requesting attorney’s fees on
noticed motion].)  
            The court finds that Defendant has
met her burden to show that the $11,346.50 in costs for court-ordered
transcripts is not allowable as costs because (1) Code of Civil Procedure
section 1033.5 allows for costs incurred for transcripts of court proceedings
as ordered by the court, and (2) Defendant has shown that the court did not
order transcripts.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
1033.5, subds. (a)(9) [allowing costs for transcripts of court proceedings
ordered by the court], (b)(5) [disallowing as costs transcripts of court
proceedings not ordered by the court]; Bohm Decl., ¶ 3 [“It is my recollection
that the court did not order any transcripts”].)  
In her opposition, Plaintiff “concedes that transcripts from the first
phase one trial . . . were not ordered by the court and withdraws” her request
for those costs in the amount of $472.10. 
(Opp., p. 1:23-25.)  The court
therefore grants Defendant’s motion to tax costs in the amount of $472.10.
However, Plaintiff contends that the court ordered the preparation of
transcripts at the end of the second phase of trial.  The court agrees and therefore finds that
Plaintiff has met her burden to show that she may recover the remaining $10,892.50
in those costs.  (Weisskopf Decl., Ex. A,
p. 86:6-10 [“Pursuant to stipulation, the court orders that Plaintiff shall
lodge certified copies of the final reporter’s transcript of the trial with the
court in Department 53 no later than October 24, 2022”]; Code Civ. Proc., §
1033.5, subd. (a)(9) [allowing costs for transcripts of court proceedings
ordered by the court]; Lowry, supra, 56 Cal.App.5th at p. 222.) 
ORDER
The court grants plaintiff Bonnie Duboff, on behalf of herself and all
other limited partners of 245 Spalding Partners, L.P.’s motion for attorney’s
fees as follows. 
The court orders that plaintiff Bonnie Duboff, on behalf of herself
and all other limited partners of 245 Spalding Partners, L.P., shall recover a
total of $775,162.50 in attorney’s fees from the recovery obtained by 245
Spalding Partners, L.P. in this action. 
(Corp. Code, § 15910.05, subd. (b).) 
The court grants in part defendant Linda Schermer, individually, as
trustee of the Surviving Trustor’s Trust under the Schermer Family Trust, as
trustee of the Deceased Trustor’s Trust under the Schermer Family Trust, and as
trustee of the Marital Trust under the Schermer Family Trust’s motion to tax
costs as follows. 
The court orders that the following costs are taxed from the
Memorandum of Costs filed by plaintiff Bonnie Duboff, on behalf of herself and
all other limited partners of 245 Spalding Partners, L.P. on October 27, 2023:
(1) $61.55 in reservation fees (Memo. of Costs, ¶ 1 and Attachment 1g, item 6);
(2) $101.54 in service of process fees (Memo. of Costs, ¶ 5 and Attachment 4g,
item 3); and (3) $472.10 in court-ordered transcript fees (Memo. of Costs, ¶ 9
and Attachment 9, items 1-2).  Plaintiff
Bonnie Duboff, on behalf of herself and all other limited partners of 245
Spalding Partners, L.P. shall recover all other costs identified on the
Memorandum of Costs. 
            The court orders plaintiff Bonnie
Duboff, on behalf of herself and all other limited partners of 245 Spalding
Partners, L.P., to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
