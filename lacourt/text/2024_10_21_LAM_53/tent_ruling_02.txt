The Settlement Agreement and Release of All Claims does not include a signature
on behalf of Defendant.  (Barry Decl.,
Ex. 6, p. 6.)  However, Defendant does
not dispute that the parties executed the settlement agreement.  (Opp., pp. 4:28-4:2 [stating that the parties
negotiated settlement of the case, citing Plaintiff’s exhibit]; Quezada Decl.,
¶ 16.)

The court notes that, in his declaration, attorney Barry states that he is
“only seeking an hourly rate of $600 for services rendered after January 1,
2022 through March 31, 2023” and an hourly rate of $625 for services rendered
after April 1, 2023.  (Barry Decl., ¶
24.)  However, the entries appear to show
that Barry charged $675 for services rendered throughout this action.  (See, e.g., Barry Decl., Ex. 7,  pp. 1 [charging $675 hourly rate on April 15,
2021], 3 [charging $675 hourly rate on October 22, 2021].)
