And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge is considering a tentative ruling in a case where a Settlement Agreement and Release of All Claims was executed, but lacks a signature from the Defendant. Despite this, the parties do not dispute that they executed the agreement. The Judge notes that attorney Barry, who represented the Defendant, is seeking an hourly rate of $600 for services rendered before April 1, 2023, and $625 for services rendered after that date. However, the entries show that Barry charged an hourly rate of $675 for services rendered throughout the action, which appears to contradict his declaration. The Judge will likely consider this discrepancy further at the upcoming Court Hearing.
