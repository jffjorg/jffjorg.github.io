  Order RE:
 
plaintiff’s motion to compel further
  responses to requests for production of documents
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                 Plaintiff Emilio Reyes            
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Defendant Lorraine Ann Escobar
Motion to Compel Further Responses to Requests for Production of
Documents
The court
considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers filed in connection with
this motion. 
DISCUSSION
Plaintiff Emilio Reyes (“Plaintiff”) moves the court for an order (1)
compelling defendant Lorraine Ann Escobar (“Defendant”) to serve further
responses to Plaintiff’s Requests for Production of Documents, Set Three, and
(2) awarding monetary sanctions in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant in
the amount of $310.66. 
The court finds that the discovery motion cutoff date has passed and
therefore denies Plaintiff’s motion. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2024.020, subd. (a).) 
Except as otherwise provided, “any party shall be entitled as a matter
of right to complete discovery proceedings on or before the 30th day, and to
have motions concerning discovery heard on or before the 15th day, before the
date initially set for the trial of the action.”  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2024.020, subd. (a).)  “Thus, if a party properly notices a discovery
motion to be heard on or before the discovery motion cutoff date, that party
has a right to have the motion heard.  By negative implication, a
party who notices a discovery motion to be heard after the discovery
motion cutoff date does not have a right to have the motion heard.”  (Pelton-Shepherd
Industries, Inc. v. Delta Packaging Products, Inc. (2008) 165 Cal.App.4th
1568, 1586 [emphasis in original].) 
On March 6, 2023, the court set this case for trial on May 15,
2024.  (March 6, 2023 Minute Order, p.
1.)  On May 2, 2024, the court (1)
continued trial, pursuant to the request of Plaintiff, from May 15, 2024 to
July 10, 2024, and (2) ordered that “[a]ll discovery cut-off and discovery
motion cut-off dates, and deadlines for the exchange of information concerning
expert trial witnesses, shall be based on the date initially set for trial of
this action (5/15/24) and shall not be reopened or based on the new trial date,
except that Defendants may take the deposition of Plaintiff Emilio Reyes
pursuant [to] the Court’s 5/1/24 order.” 
(May 2, 2024 Minute Order, pp. 1-2.) 
On June 27, 2024, the court continued trial from July 10, 2024 to July
17, 2024 on the court’s own motion. 
(June 27, 2024 Minute Order, p. 2.) 
The court did not reopen discovery or extend the discovery and discovery
motion cutoff dates in that order.  (Ibid.)  Thereafter, on July 15, 2024, the court
issued a minute order (1) continuing trial from July 17, 2024 to October 16,
2024, and (2) ordering that “the discovery cut-off and discovery motion cut-off
dates are only extended with respect to the deposition of Plaintiff, Emilio
Reyes.”  (July 15, 2024 Minute Order, p.
1.)  On October 9, 2024, the court issued
an order granting defendants Los Indios de San Gabriel, Inc. and Andrew Salas’s
motion for order continuing trial and final status conference, and ordered that
(1) trial in this action is continued from October 16, 2024 to January 29, 2025,
and (2) the discovery cutoff and discovery motion cutoff dates (i) were not
extended by the continuance and (ii) shall be based on the date initially set
for trial of this action, i.e., May 15, 2024. 
(Oct. 9, 2024 Order, p. 2:6-13.) 
            Thus, the discovery motion cutoff
date passed as of April 30, 2024, i.e., 15 days before May 15, 2024.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2024.020, subd.
(a).)  Because Plaintiff noticed this
motion for hearing after the discovery motion cutoff date had passed, and
because Plaintiff did not file a motion requesting that the court reopen
discovery pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2024.050, the court finds
that Plaintiff does not have a right to have this motion heard.  (Ibid.; Pelton-Shepherd Industries,
Inc., supra, 165 Cal.App.4th at p. 1586.)  
The court denies Defendant’s request for monetary sanctions against
Plaintiff.  (Opp., p. 3:3-16.) 
ORDER
            The court denies plaintiff Emilio
Reyes’s motion to compel further responses to requests for production of
documents. 
            The court orders defendant Lorraine
Ann Escobar to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
