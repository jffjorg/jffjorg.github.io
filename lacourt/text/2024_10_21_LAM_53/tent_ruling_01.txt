DISCUSSION
Plaintiff Agavni Sagryan (“Plaintiff”) moves the court for an order
awarding attorney’s fees and costs in her favor, to be paid by defendant
General Motors LLC (“Defendant”), in the total amount of $86,721.61, consisting
of $82,152.50 in attorney’s fees and $4,569.11 in costs. 
First, the court finds that Plaintiff is entitled to recover
attorney’s fees, costs, and expenses from Defendant pursuant to the
Song-Beverly Act. 
Civil Code section 1794, subdivision (d), provides:¿ “If the buyer
prevails in an action under this section, the buyer shall be allowed by the
court to recover as part of the judgment a sum equal to the aggregate amount of
costs and expenses, including attorney’s fees based on actual time expended,
determined by the court to have been reasonably incurred by the buyer in
connection with the commencement and prosecution of such action.”¿¿ 
            Plaintiff has presented evidence
establishing that, pursuant to the parties’ “Settlement Agreement and Release
of All Claims,” the parties agreed to settle this action, and Defendant shall
pay (1) $36,464.28 to Plaintiff and $18,535.72 to Chase Auto Finance, and (2)
Plaintiff’s attorney’s fees, costs, and expenses.[1]  (Barry Decl., Ex. 6, ¶ 2, subd. (b).)  The parties further agreed that “Plaintiff is
the prevailing party for purposes of the motion” for attorney’s fees.  (Id. at ¶ 2, subd. (b)(iii).)  The court therefore finds that Plaintiff may
recover from Defendant attorney’s fees, costs, and expenses that were
reasonably incurred in connection with the commencement and prosecution of this
action.  (Civ. Code, § 1794, subd. (d).) 
            Second, the court finds that
Plaintiff has established, as to the attorney’s fees incurred to commence and
prosecute this action and to prepare the pending motion for attorney’s fees, a
lodestar amount of $68,095.
“[T]he fee setting inquiry in California ordinarily begins with the
‘lodestar,’ i.e., the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by the
reasonable hourly rate. . . . .¿ The reasonable hourly rate is that prevailing
in the community for similar work.¿ The lodestar figure may then be adjusted,
based on consideration of factors specific to the case, in order to fix the fee
at the fair market value for the legal services provided.”¿ (PLCM Group v.
Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095 (internal citations omitted).)¿ “[T]he
verified time statements of the attorneys, as officers of the court, are
entitled to credence in the absence of a clear indication the records are
erroneous.”¿ (Horsford v. Board of Trustees of California State Univ.
(2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 359, 396.)¿¿ 
Plaintiff has submitted the declarations of David N. Barry, Elizabeth
Quinn, Otis R. Hayes III, Andrew Matera, and Jeramy Templin, in which they have
attested to the qualifications, experience, and skill of the attorneys who
worked on this action.  (Barry Decl., ¶¶
24-27, 29-30 [discussing rates of attorneys Eabisa and Shumake]; Quinn Decl.,
¶¶ 1, 4-11; Hayes Decl., ¶¶ 1, 4-5; Matera Decl., ¶¶ 1, 3-7; Templin Decl., ¶¶
1, 4-6.)  Plaintiff has also included a
chart setting forth the hourly rates for the attorneys that worked on this
action as follows: (1) David N. Barry ($675)[2];
(2) Elizabeth Quinn ($600); (3) Otis R. Hayes III ($500); (4) Andrew Matera
($500); (5) Jeramy Templin ($350); (6) Elizabeth Eabisa ($250); and (7) Carrie
Shumake ($400).  (Mot., p. 15:4-14.)  
Upon the court’s review of counsel’s declarations, the court finds
that the following hourly rates are reasonable: (1) as to attorney Barry, $625;
(2) as to attorney Quinn, $550; (3) as to attorney Hayes, $475; (4) as to
attorney Matera, $425; (5) as to attorney Templin, $250; (6) as to attorney
Eabisa, $250; and (7) as to attorney Shumake, $375.
            The court has reviewed each entry on
the billing statement submitted by Plaintiff’s counsel, Defendant’s opposition
papers, and its objections to specific billing entries.  Based on the court’s review of the billing
statement and Defendant’s challenges thereto, the court finds that (1) of the total
2.6 hours billed by attorney Quinn on October 27 and 28, 2021 to draft
discovery requests and notices of depositions, 0.6 of those hours were not
reasonably incurred; (2) of the total 6.9 hours billed by attorney Eabisa on
March 29, 2022 to draft two motions to compel Defendant’s further responses,
0.9 of those hours were not reasonably incurred; (3) of the 1.90 hours billed
by attorney Matera to draft Plaintiff’s motion to exclude Defendant’s expert
witness on May 23, 2023, 0.8 of those hours were not reasonably incurred; (4)
of the total 2.2 hours billed by attorney Matera to draft and file Plaintiff’s
ex parte application on May 23, 2023, 0.7 of those hours were not reasonably
incurred; (5) of the total 1.7 hours billed by attorney Quinn to travel to and
from court on March 30, 2023, 0.7 of those hours were not reasonably incurred;
(6) of the total 1.6 hours billed by attorney Barry to travel to and from court
on May 26, 2023, 0.6 of those hours were not reasonably incurred; (7) of the
total 1.6 hours billed by attorney Barry to travel to and from court on August
4, 2023, 0.6 of those hours were not reasonably incurred; (8) of the total 1.6
hours billed by attorney Barry to travel to and from court on October 19, 2023,
0.6 of those hours were not reasonably incurred; (9) of the total 1.9 hours
billed by attorney Barry to travel to and from court on November 20, 2023, 0.9
of those hours were not reasonably incurred; (10) of the total 1.0 hour billed
by attorney Barry to draft the memorandum of costs, 0.5 of those hours were not
reasonably incurred; (11) of the 2.0 hours billed by attorney Matera in
anticipation of travelling to and from court for the hearing on this motion,
1.0 of those hours are not reasonably incurred; (12) of the 4.0 hours billed by
attorney Matera to review Defendant’s opposition and prepare a reply in
connection with this motion, 2.5 of those hours are not reasonably incurred;
and (13) of the 3.0 total hours billed by attorney Barry to review the file and
travel to and from court for the hearing on this motion, 1.5 of those hours are
not reasonably incurred.  (Barry Decl.,
Ex. 7, pp. 3-4, 9-10, 20, 24-25, 26-27, 30, 40-41, 43, 45, 46, 47.)  The court therefore finds that Plaintiff has
shown that her attorneys reasonably expended 140.2 hours to commence and
prosecute this action and prepare the pending motion. 
            Thus, the court finds that Plaintiff
has established a lodestar amount of $68,095 ((43.4 hours x Barry’s $625 hourly
rate) + (22.6 hours x Quinn’s $550 hourly rate) + (6.1 hours x Hayes’s $475
hourly rate) + (47.6 hours x Matera’s $425 hourly rate) + (3 hours x Templin’s
$250 hourly rate) + (15.2 hours x Eabisa’s $250 hourly rate) + (2.3 hours x
Shumake’s $375 hourly rate)).  (Mot., p.
15 [chart summarizing hours expended by each attorney]; Barry Decl., Ex. 7
[billing statement].) 
            Third, the court finds that the
total $117.57 in mileage costs were not reasonably incurred in connection with
the commencement and prosecution of the action. 
(MC-011, p. 4; Civ. Code, § 1794, subd. (d).)  The court therefore finds that Plaintiff is
entitled to an award of costs in the amount of $4,451.54.  (Ibid.) 
ORDER
            The court grants plaintiff Agavni
Sagryan’s motion for attorney’s fees and costs as follows. 
            The court orders that plaintiff
Agavni Sagryan shall recover from defendant General Motors LLC a total of $72,546.54,
consisting of $68,095 in attorney’s fees and $4,451.54 in costs.  (Civ. Code, § 1794, subd. (d).)
            The court orders plaintiff Agavni
Sagryan to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
