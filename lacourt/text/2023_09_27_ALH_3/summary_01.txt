And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to strike the defendant's answer and has entered a default judgment against the defendant. The defendant is a corporation and is prohibited from appearing in court without counsel, and it failed to appear at two previous status conferences. The defendant also did not retain new counsel or make any appearances in court. As a result, the judge has struck the defendant's answer and entered a default judgment against the defendant. The plaintiff's motions to compel the defendant's discovery responses are now moot since the defendant can no longer participate in the litigation. The judge notes that if the motions had not been granted, the defendant would have been ordered to provide verified objection-free responses and pay monetary sanctions.
