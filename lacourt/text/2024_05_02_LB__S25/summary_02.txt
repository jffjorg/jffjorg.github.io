And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling by the court grants the motion to be relieved as counsel filed by Saideh Ghasemi Moghadam, the plaintiff's counsel. The court finds that the attorney-client relationship has broken down due to the counsel's inability to maintain regular contact and communication with the plaintiff. The court orders that the counsel's relief as counsel of record for the plaintiff is not effective until proof of service of the order signed by the court upon the client is filed in this action. The case management conference is continued to July 31, 2024, and the court requests counsel Moghadam to advise the plaintiff of the future date.
