Judge's Tentative Ruling:

The court has reviewed the defendant's demurrer to the second amended complaint and motion to strike. After considering the parties' meet and confer efforts, the court finds that the parties did not adequately meet and confer as required by Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41.

As a result, the court is continuing the hearing date to allow the parties to further meet and confer. The defendant's counsel is ordered to file a supplemental declaration describing the meet and confer efforts at least nine court days before the next scheduled hearing.

The court will set a new hearing date at a later time.
