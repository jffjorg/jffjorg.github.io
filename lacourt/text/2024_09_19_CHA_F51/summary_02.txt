And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, Paul Adame, has filed motions to compel the deposition of the plaintiff, I.G., and her mother, Anita King. The defendant also requests monetary sanctions against the deponents and their counsel in the amount of $3,836.05.

The court has reviewed the motions and the parties' submissions and has concluded that the motions are off calendar. The court finds that the defendant has failed to demonstrate good cause for compelling the depositions, as the deponents have not failed to appear for their scheduled depositions. The court also notes that the discovery cutoff date has passed, and the parties have not moved to reopen the discovery period.

The court declines to rule on the motions and instead orders that the depositions be rescheduled for a later date. The court also notes that the parties should have conducted the depositions earlier in the case and that the granting of the motions would be likely to delay the case from going to trial as planned on October 7, 2024.
