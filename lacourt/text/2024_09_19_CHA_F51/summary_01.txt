And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion to disqualify Defendant's counsel, Vanderford & Ruiz, LLP, from representing Defendant in the case. The motion was brought by Plaintiff, I.G., who claims that Defendant's counsel's relationship with Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) creates a conflict of interest that would prevent Defendant's counsel from providing independent representation.

The judge found that while LAUSD's payment of Defendant's counsel's fees may create an appearance of impropriety, the evidence does not show that LAUSD has directed or influenced Defendant's counsel's decision-making. The judge also noted that the proposed settlement is speculative and that Plaintiff has not provided any evidence or calculations to support the claim that the settlement is substantially lesser than Plaintiff's expected recovery upon a trial on the merits.

The judge concluded that there is insufficient cause to conclude that an unwaivable conflict of interest exists, and therefore denied the motion. The case is set for trial on October 7, 2024.
