SEPTEMBER 18,  2024    MOTIONS TO COMPEL  DEPOSITIONS  Los Angeles Superior Court Case # 20STCV39389    Motions filed: 5/21/24; 6/27/24                                                                  JURY TRIAL: 10/7/24   MOVING PARTY: Defendant  Paul Adame, an individual (“Defendant”) RESPONDING PARTY: Plaintiff  I.G., an individual (“Plaintiff”) NOTICE: ok    RELIEF REQUESTED: Orders compelling both  Plaintiff and non-party deponent Anita King to appear to be deposed. Defendant  also requests monetary sanctions to be imposed against the deponents and their  counsel in the combined amount of $3,836.05.   TENTATIVE RULING: The  motions are off calendar.   BACKGROUND   This action arises out of Plaintiff’s claim that on  2/3/12, when Plaintiff was a 10-year old student at Germain Elementary School  in Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD), Plaintiff was sexually battered  by Defendant, a buildings and grounds worker employed by LAUSD, during school  hours.     On 5/11/21, Plaintiff filed the operative  Second Amended Complaint (SAC), alleging against Defendant and LAUSD the  following causes of action: (1) Sexual Battery; (2) Intentional Infliction of  Emotional Distress; and (3) Negligence. On 12/1/21, the Court entered a  judgment of dismissal in favor of LAUSD after sustaining its demurrer to  Plaintiff’s third cause of action without leave to amend.   On 3/21/23,  Plaintiff appeared for her first deposition. (Ex. A to Decl. of Ramon  Quintana.) On 2/1/24, Defendant served Plaintiff with a Notice of Second  Session Deposition and Request for Production of Documents, with her second  deposition set for 2/23/24. (Ex. B to Quintana Decl.) On 2/16/24, Plaintiff  served her objections thereto. (Ex. C to Quintana Decl.) Plaintiff did not  appear for her scheduled 2/23/24 deposition.   On 4/12/24,  nonparty deponent Anita King, Plaintiff’s mother and guardian ad litem, was  served with a subpoena to appear for her deposition on 5/20/24. (Ex. D to  Quintana Decl.) Counsel for the parties agreed to reschedule Ms. King’s remote  deposition to 6/24/24. (Exs. E–F to Quintana Decl.) On 6/20/24, Ms. King served  her objections to the deposition notice. (Ex. H to Quintana Decl.) Ms. King did  not appear for her scheduled 6/24/24 deposition. (Ex. L to Quintana Decl.)   On 5/21/24,  Defendant filed the instant motion to compel the deposition of Plaintiff. On  6/27/24, Defendant filed the instant motion to compel the deposition of Ms.  King. On 9/6/24, Plaintiff filed her oppositions thereto. On 9/12/24, Defendant  filed his replies.   ANALYSIS   A party may, upon proper written  notice, obtain discovery by taking the oral deposition of any natural person,  organization, partnership, association, or governmental agency. (Code Civ.  Proc. §§ 2025.010, 2025.220.) A party deponent can be required to attend a  deposition by service of a deposition notice on the party’s attorney. (Code  Civ. Proc. § 2025.280, subd. (a).) When a nonparty is served with a deposition  subpoena but fails to attend the deposition or refuses to be sworn as a  witness, the party that served the subpoena may move for an order directing  compliance with the subpoena and imposing other terms or conditions as the  judge considers appropriate. (Code Civ. Proc. § 1987.1, subd. (a).)   “If, after service of a deposition  notice, a party to the action … without having served a valid objection …,  fails to appear for examination, … the party giving the notice may move for an  order compelling the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the production  for inspection of any document, electronically stored information, or tangible  thing described in the deposition notice.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2025.450, subd.  (a).) “If a deponent fails to answer any question or to produce any document,  electronically stored information, or tangible thing under the deponent’s  control that is specified in the deposition notice or a deposition subpoena,  the party seeking discovery may move the court for an order compelling that  answer or production.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2025.480, subd. (a).)     1.       Meet and Confer   A motion to compel a deposition must  (1) “set forth specific facts showing good cause justifying the production for  inspection of any document, electronically stored information, or tangible  thing described in the deposition notice;” and (2) “be accompanied by a meet  and confer declaration under Section 2016.040, or, when the deponent fails to  attend the deposition and produce the documents, electronically stored  information, or things described in the deposition notice, by a declaration  stating that the petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire about the  nonappearance.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2025.450, subd. (b).)    Here, Defendant’s counsel declares  that on 2/23/24, he sent Plaintiff’s counsel a meet and confer letter inquiring  about the second deposition of Plaintiff but received no substantive response.  (Quintana Decl. ¶ 6; Ex. D to Quintana Decl.) Accordingly, the Court finds that  counsel has satisfied the meet and confer requirements under Code of Civil  Procedure section 2025.450, subdivision (b).   2.       Discovery Cutoff   All discovery proceedings under the Discovery Act must be completed  30 days before the date initially set for the trial, irrespective of  continuances or postponements of that trial date. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2024.020.)  Once the discovery cutoff date has run and discovery has closed, the only means  provided in the Discovery Act for reopening discovery is a motion for leave of  court. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2024.050.)   A motion for leave to complete  discovery proceedings requires the Court to consider such factors as: “(1)¿The  necessity and the reasons for the discovery; (2)¿The diligence or lack of  diligence of the party seeking the discovery or the hearing of a discovery  motion, and the reasons that the discovery was not completed or that the  discovery motion was not heard earlier; (3)¿Any likelihood that permitting the  discovery or hearing the discovery motion will prevent the case from going to  trial on the date set, or otherwise interfere with the trial calendar, or  result in prejudice to any other party; and (4)¿The length of time that has  elapsed between any date previously set, and the date presently set, for the  trial of the action.” (Id. at subd. (b).)   Here, while the Court continued the trial date to 10/7/24, the  parties originally stipulated for trial to begin on 7/22/24, with all related  discovery dates corresponding to that date. Accordingly, the discovery cut-off  date was 6/24/24, and no party has since moved to reopen the discovery period.  In Pelton-Shepherd Industries, Inc. v. Delta Packaging Products, Inc.  (2008) 165 Cal.App.4th 1568, the Court of Appeal found that the trial court  abused its discretion in hearing the plaintiff’s belated motion to compel  discovery without first deciding whether to reopen discovery, and this abuse of  discretion was prejudicial to defendant because it was reasonably probable the  trial court would have denied any motion to reopen discovery.   Here, the Court notes that the  granting of the instant motions would inevitably require the deponents to  appear for their depositions past the 6/24/24 discovery cut-off date, and  Defendant has not moved for leave to extend or reopen the discovery period.  Even as such, the Court notes that here, as in Pelton, it is “reasonably  probable” that the Court would have denied any such motion, based on its  concerns with Defendant’s lack of diligence in seeking the depositions at an  earlier stage of the case, as well has the likelihood that permitting the  discovery would delay the case from going to trial as planned on 10/7/24. (165  Cal.App.4th at 1589; Code Civ. Proc. § 2024.050, subd. (b).)   Based on the foregoing, the Court  declines to rule on Defendant’s motions.   CONCLUSION   The motions are off calendar.
