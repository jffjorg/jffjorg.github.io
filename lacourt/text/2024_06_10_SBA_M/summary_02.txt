```

And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants HB Construction's motion for attorneys' fees on appeal in the amount of $26,388.00. The motion is granted because the defendant prevailed on appeal and was not awarded costs on appeal. The judge notes that an award of costs does not preclude a party from seeking attorneys' fees. The judge applies the "lodestar" method to determine the reasonable attorneys' fees, considering the reasonable amount of time the attorney spent and a reasonable hourly rate. The attorney's declaration is sufficient to determine whether the amount of time expended was reasonable. The judge awards attorneys' fees to the defendant in the total amount of $26,388.00.
