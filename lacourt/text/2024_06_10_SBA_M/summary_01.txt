And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling grants Defendant Stacey Morrow's motion to quash service of summons. The Plaintiff, Karen Johnston as Successor Trustee of the Morrow Family Trust, filed a complaint alleging a cause of action for Ejectment against Defendant Morrow. The Defendant moved to quash service of summons, arguing that she was not properly served with the summons and complaint. The court finds that the Plaintiff has failed to prove that the Defendant was properly served, and therefore grants the Defendant's motion to quash service of summons. The Defendant is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
