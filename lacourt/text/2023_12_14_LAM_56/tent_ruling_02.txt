  CASE NO.: 22STCV28337
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER RE: MOTION FOR
  PROTECTIVE ORDER 
 
Date: December 14, 2023
Time: 8:30 a.m. 
Dept. 56
 



 
MOVING
PARTY: Plaintiff
 
RESPONDING
PARTY: Defendant Farbood Majd (“Defendant”)
 
The
Court has considered the moving, opposition and reply papers.
 
BACKGROUND
            This action arises out of
an attorney-client relationship.  Plaintiff’s
complaint (the “Complaint”) alleges: (1) legal malpractice; (2) breach of
contract; and (3) breach of fiduciary duty. 

 
 
 
            On November 18, 2023, Plaintiff
filed a motion for protective order (the “Motion”).  The Motion requests a protective order limiting
the number of responses that Plaintiff is required to provide to Defendant’s
Special Interrogatories, Set One (the “SPROGs”) to 35 responses. 
 
DISCUSSION
Under
California Code of Civil Procedure (“CCP”) section 2030.090, when
interrogatories have been propounded, the responding party, and any other party
or affected natural person or organization may promptly move for a protective
order.  (CCP § 2030.090, subd. (a).)  The motion shall be accompanied by a meet and
confer declaration under CCP section 2016.040. 
(Id.)  The court, for good
cause shown, may make any order that justice requires to protect any party or
natural person or organization from unwarranted annoyance, embarrassment, or
oppression, or undue burden and expense. 
(CCP § 2030.090, subd. (b).)  If
the motion for a protective order is denied in whole or in part, the court may
order that the party provide or permit the discovery against which protection
was sought on terms and conditions that are just.  (CCP § 2030.090, subd. (c).)
 
Generally, a party may only propound to another party
thirty-five (35) specially prepared interrogatories that are relevant to the
subject matter of the action.  (CCP §
2030.030, subd. (a).) Subject to the right of the
responding party to seek a protective order, a party who attaches a supporting
declaration for additional discovery under CCP section 2030.050 may propound a
greater number of specially prepared interrogatories to another party if this
greater number is warranted because of any of the following:
 
(1)   The
complexity or the quantity of the existing and potential issues in the
particular case.
(2)   The
financial burden on a party entailed in conducting the discovery by oral
deposition.
(3)    The expedience of using this method of
discovery to provide to the responding party the opportunity to conduct an
inquiry, investigation, or search of files or records to supply the information
sought.
 
(CCP
§ 2030.040, subd. (a).) 
 
 
A party who propounds more than 35 specially
prepared interrogatories shall attach a supporting declaration which
substantially addresses why the number of questions is warranted under CCP
section 2030.040.  (See CCP §
2030.050.)  The example declaration
provided in CCP section 2030.050 provides that a party should “state each
factor described in Section 2030.040 that is relied on, as well as the reasons
why any factor relied on is applicable to the instant lawsuit.”  (See id.) 
 
If
the responding party seeks a protective order on the ground that the number of
specially prepared interrogatories is unwarranted, the propounding party shall
have the burden of justifying the number of these interrogatories.  (CCP § 2030.040, subd. (b).) 
 
Defendant
propounded SPROGs, Set One on September 27, 2023.  (Declaration of Shahrokh Mokhtarzadeh
(“Mokhtarzadeh Decl.”) ¶ 15, Exhibit A.) 
The SPROGs contain 822 inquiries. 
(See id.)  
 
 
            Plaintiff argues that Defendant’s declaration attached to
the SPROGs is insufficient to justify the additional discovery requests.  The Court agrees.  The declaration attached to the SPROGs provides only a generalized statement that
the greater number of SPROGs is warranted to conduct a proper investigation of
the issues in the case, without specific facts justifying the large number of
requests.  This explanation could apply
to any legal malpractice litigation and does not address why Defendant needs a
greater number of SPROGs well-beyond the general cap of 35 SPROGs.  (See CCP § 2030.030, subd. (a).)  Furthermore, Defendant’s opposition (the
“Opposition”) does not satisfy Defendant’s burden of justifying the
propounding of over 35 SPROGs.  (See CCP
§ 2030.040, subd. (b).)  
 
The
Court therefore GRANTS the Motion. 
Plaintiff is not required to submit responses to Defendant’s SPROGs, Set
One numbers 36-822.  
 
Monetary Sanctions
            Plaintiff requests monetary sanctions in the amount of
$6,060 in connection with the Motion. 
This amount represents: six hours preparing the moving papers at an
hourly rate of $500 per hour; (2) an anticipated 3 hours reviewing the
Opposition and preparing reply papers (the “Reply”) and two hours attending the
hearing; and (3) a $60 filing fee. 
(Mokhtarzadeh Decl. ¶ 36.)[1]
 
 
 
            The Court exercises its discretion and awards Plaintiff
monetary sanctions in the reasonable amount of $4,560, which represents six
hours preparing the Motion, three hours reviewing the Opposition and preparing
the Reply, and $60 in filing fees.  (Moran
v. Oso Valley Greenbelt Assn. (2004) 117 Cal.App.4th 1029, 1034.)  Defendant is ordered to pay this amount
within 20 days of the date of this order. 
 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
 
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org
as directed by the instructions provided on the court website at
www.lacourt.org.  If the department does
not receive an email and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion
will be placed off calendar.
