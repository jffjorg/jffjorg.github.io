And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for a protective order filed by plaintiff Dr. Igal Elyassi. The motion seeks to limit the number of responses Dr. Elyassi must provide to defendant Farbood Majd's Special Interrogatories, Set One (SPROGs). The SPROGs contain 822 inquiries, which is well beyond the general cap of 35 SPROGs allowed by law.

The court finds that defendant's declaration justifying the additional discovery requests is insufficient. The declaration provides only a generalized statement that the greater number of SPROGs is warranted to conduct a proper investigation of the issues in the case, without specific facts justifying the large number of requests.

The court grants the motion and orders that Dr. Elyassi is not required to submit responses to defendant's SPROGs, Set One numbers 36-822. The court also awards Dr. Elyassi monetary sanctions in the amount of $4,560, representing six hours preparing the motion, three hours reviewing the opposition and preparing the reply, and $60 in filing fees.
