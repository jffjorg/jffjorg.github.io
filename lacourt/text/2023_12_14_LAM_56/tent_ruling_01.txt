AND RELATED CROSS-ACTION
 
MOVING PARTY: Plaintiffs/Cross-Defendants
Patience and Fortitude, Inc. (“PFI”) and Wander and Ponder (“WP”);
Cross-Defendants Kalie Caldwell (“Caldwell”) and Harold Hildebrand
(“Hildebrand”) (collectively, “Moving Cross-Defendants”)
 
RESPONDING PARTY: Defendant/Cross-Complainant
Move Sales, Inc. (“MSI”)
 
The Court has considered the moving and
opposition papers.  No reply papers were
filed.  Any reply papers were required to
have been filed and served at least five court days before the hearing under California
Code of Civil Procedure (“CCP”) section 1005, subdivision (b). 
 
 
 
 
BACKGROUND
This action, which was initiated on April 2,
2021, arises out of a business relationship. 
The currently operative first amended cross-complaint (the “FAXC”) alleges:
(1) breach of contract; (2) breach of contract; (3) account stated; and (4)
goods and services rendered.  
 
On November 9, 2023, Moving Cross-Defendants
filed a demurrer (the “Demurrer”) on the ground that the FAXC fails to state
facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.
 
DISCUSSION
Meet and Confer
The meet and confer requirement has been
met.  
 
Legal Standard
A demurrer tests the sufficiency of a
complaint as a matter of law.  (Durell v. Sharp Healthcare (2010) 183
Cal.App.4th 1350, 1358.)  The court
accepts as true all material factual allegations and affords them a liberal
construction, but it does not consider conclusions of fact or law, opinions,
speculation, or allegations contrary to law or judicially noticed facts.  (Shea
Homes Limited Partnership v. County of Alameda (2003) 110 Cal.App.4th 1246,
1254.)  With respect to a demurrer, the
complaint must be construed liberally by drawing reasonable inferences from the
facts pleaded.  (Rodas v. Spiegel (2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 513, 517.)  A demurrer will be sustained without leave to
amend if there exists no reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by
amendment.  (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.)  
 
When a complaint shows on its face or on the
basis of judicially noticed facts that the cause of action alleged therein is
barred by the statute of limitations, the plaintiff must plead facts which show
an excuse, tolling, or some other basis for avoiding the statutory bar.  (Ponderosa Homes, Inc. v. City of San
Ramon (1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 1761, 1768.) 
To invoke the delayed discovery doctrine in order to stop the accrual of
the statute of limitations, a plaintiff must plead: (1) facts showing
reasonable diligence; and (2) the time and manner of discovery.  (WA Southwest 2, LLC v. First American
Title Ins. Co. (2015) 240 Cal.App.4th 140, 156-57.)  The delayed discovery doctrine only delays
accrual until the plaintiff has, or should have, inquiry notice of the cause of
action.  (Id.)  In assessing the
sufficiency of the allegations of delayed discovery, the court places the burden on the plaintiff to show diligence; conclusory
allegations will not withstand demurrer. 
(Fox v. Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc.
(2005) 35 Cal.4th 797, 808.)

 
            As
a preliminary matter, although PFI and WP filed an answer to the initial
cross-complaint (the “XC”), the Court will consider their Demurrer to the FAXC
because the FAXC supplants the XC and it, standing alone, contains all of MSI’s
allegations and requests for relief.  (See
Foster v. Sexton (2021) 61 Cal.App.5th 998, 1035.)
 
Timeliness of XC/Alter-Ego Liability
The relation back doctrine tolls the statute
of limitations on cross claims filed against a plaintiff, but the doctrine does
not apply to cross-actions against codefendants or new parties.  (See Boyer v. Jensen (2005) 129
Cal.App.4th 62, 70.) 
 
 
Ordinarily, a corporation is regarded as a
legal entity, separate and distinct from its stockholders, officers and
directors, with separate and distinct liabilities and obligations. (Sonora Diamond Corp. v. Superior Court
(2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 523, 538.)  The
corporate form will be disregarded only in narrowly defined circumstances and
only when the ends of justice so require. (Mesler
v. Bragg Management Co. (1985) 39 Cal.3d 290, 301.)  To invoke an alter ego theory of liability,
there must be: (1) such a unity of interest and ownership between the
corporation and its equitable owner that the separate personalities of the
corporation and the shareholder do not in reality exist; and (2) an inequitable
result if the acts in question are treated as those of the corporation
alone.  (Sonora Diamond Corp. v. Superior Court,
supra, 83 Cal.App.4th
at 538.)  To recover on an alter ego
theory, a plaintiff must allege sufficient facts to show a unity of interest
and ownership, and an unjust result if the corporation is treated as the sole
actor.  (A.J. Fistes Corp. v. GDL Best
Contractors, Inc. (2019) 38 Cal.App.5th 677, 696.)  A claim based upon an alter ego theory is not
itself a claim for substantive relief.  (Leek
v. Cooper (2011) 194 Cal.App.4th 399, 418.) 
It is a procedural device by which courts will disregard the corporate
entity in order to hold the alter ego individual liable on the obligations of
the corporation.  (Id. at 419.)
 
The Demurrer argues that the claims against
Caldwell and Hildebrand fail because they are time-barred and do not allege a
basis for imposing alter-ego liability.  The FAXC is based in alleged contractual
breaches that occurred in 2017 and 2018 and the claims are therefore
time-barred unless the claims against Caldwell and Hildebrand relate back to
the date that Plaintiffs initiated the action under an alter ego theory.  The Court finds that the FAXC includes
sufficient information regarding the lack of corporate formalities to allege a
unity of interest to support alter-ego allegations against Caldwell and
Hildebrand with respect to PFI and WP.  (See
FAXC ¶¶ 8-14, 20-30.)  As the
Demurrer’s arguments regarding the first, second, and fourth causes of action
concern whether the allegations may relate back to the filing of Plaintiffs’
initial Complaint based on the inclusion of Caldwell and Hildebrand, the Court
OVERRULES the Demurrer to these causes of action. 
 
Account Stated
An account stated is an agreement, based on
prior transactions between the parties, that the items of an account are true
and that the balance struck is due and owing. 
(Leighton v. Forster (2017) 8 Cal.App.5th 467, 491.)  To be an account stated, it must appear that
at the time of the statement an indebtedness from one party to the other
existed, that a balance was then struck and agreed to be the correct sum owing
from the debtor to the creditor, and that the debtor expressly or impliedly
promised to pay to the creditor the amount thus determined to be owing.  (Id.) 
The essential elements of an account stated are: (1) previous
transactions between the parties establishing the relationship of debtor and
creditor; (2) an agreement between the parties, express or implied, on the
amount due from the debtor to the creditor; (3) a promise by the debtor,
express or implied, to pay the amount due. 
(Id.)
 
Here, while the FAXC alleges that MSI
provided Moving Cross-Defendants with a statement of indebtedness, there are no
allegations that Moving Cross-Defendants separately agreed to pay an amount
owed based on past transactions.  (See
FAXC ¶¶ 19-20.)  The Court
therefore SUSTAINS the Demurrer to the third cause of action with 20 days leave
to amend. 
 
 
Moving party is ordered to give notice of
this ruling.
