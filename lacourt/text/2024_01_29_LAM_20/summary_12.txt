And here is the English text summarizing the Judge's tentative ruling:

The court has issued a tentative ruling regarding a dispute over costs between DONE! Ventures, LLC and Coastal Laundromat, Inc. (plaintiffs) and Jerry Jamgotchian, El Segundo Plaza Associates L.P., and Theta Holding IV, Inc. (defendants). The plaintiffs had previously filed a memorandum of costs in the amount of $2,391,826.07, and the defendants sought to tax those costs. However, the defendants' motion to tax costs was filed two months after the deadline, making it untimely. The court denied the motion and struck prejudgment interest from the memo of costs. The court also found that the plaintiffs served the defendants by email on May 18, 2023, and that the defendants did not receive the email until later. The court's ruling stands, and the defendants are ordered to give notice.
