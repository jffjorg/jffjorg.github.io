And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling in an employment action. The plaintiff, Gena Persons, is seeking to compel further responses from the defendant, City of Pasadena, regarding her requests for production. The defendant has already produced documents in response to the plaintiff's requests, but the plaintiff argues that the responses are incomplete and unclear. The defendant argues that its responses are sufficient and that the plaintiff is trying to circumvent the discovery process.

The court has reviewed the documents produced by the defendant and has found that they are not clearly adequate. Therefore, the motion to compel further responses is denied. The plaintiff is free to propound additional interrogatories to obtain the information it seeks.
