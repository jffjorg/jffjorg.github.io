And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The Court has considered the motion to set aside the judgment of dismissal filed by Brison Hardin and has found that the dismissal was caused by the failure of his former counsel, Nathalie Meza Contreras, to appear at the demurrer hearing due to technical difficulties. The Court notes that had former counsel appeared, it would have allowed another iteration of the complaint. Therefore, the Court grants the motion to set aside the judgment and directs former counsel to pay $1,500 in fees and costs to the defendant.
