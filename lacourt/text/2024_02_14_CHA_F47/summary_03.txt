And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by the defendants, Marc Davis and Mom's Haus, LLC, to the entire complaint filed by the plaintiff, Geneva Fontenette. The demurrer was filed on December 28, 2023, and the opposition was filed by the plaintiff on January 31, 2024.

The court has sustained the demurrer without leave to amend as to the 2nd, 4th, 5th, and 6th causes of action, which include claims of unfair business practices, breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing, unjust enrichment, and negligent misrepresentation.

The court has sustained the demurrer with 30 days leave to amend as to the 1st and 3rd causes of action, which include claims of financial elder abuse and breach of contract. The court has also indicated that the plaintiff's complaint fails to state a claim for financial elder abuse and that the facts alleged are more related to a possible breach of contract rather than egregious conduct.

The court has given the plaintiff 30 days to amend its complaint to address the issues raised in the demurrer.
