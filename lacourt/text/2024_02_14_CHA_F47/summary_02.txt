And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the stipulation and PAGA Settlement Agreement submitted by the plaintiff and has found that it does not meet the requirements for approval. The plaintiff has since submitted additional declarations and a new proposed order, which the court finds sufficient to address the issues noted in the previous minute order. The judge has approved the PAGA settlement, which includes a gross settlement of $11,000.00, attorney fees of $1,100.00, PAGA administration costs of $2,850.00, and a distribution of $5,287.50 to the state of California and $1,762.50 to the aggrieved employees. The plaintiff is ordered to file a stipulation dismissing the action without prejudice with the court retaining jurisdiction under CCP 664.6.
