Case #22CHCV00191
 
HEARING ON STIPULATION
FOR COURT APPROVAL OF PAGA SETTLEMENT
 
Stipulation received on 11/30/23.
 
On 11/30/23, Plaintiff Jessica Ornelas (Plaintiff), on
behalf of herself and the aggrieved employees (Plaintiff), submitted a Joint
Stipulation Re: Court Approval of PAGA Settlement and Order.  Upon review, the Court found the stipulation
and attached PAGA Settlement Agreement did not meet the requirements for
approval.  (See 12/6/23 Minute
Order).  In order to address the
deficiencies noted by the Court, the Court set the matter for hearing on
2/14/24 and ordered the parties to submit additional/supplemental papers,
declarations, a new proposed order, etc. at least five court days before the
hearing.  Id.
 
On 2/5/24, Plaintiff submitted declarations in support of
the settlement of the PAGA claims.  (See
Ornelas Decl.; Donabedian Decl.; Lawrence Decl.).  Additionally, on 2/6/24, Plaintiff filed a
Notice of Lodging of the Confidential Declaration of Annie Bishop with
confidential exhibits.  (See
Notice of Lodging).  The Court finds good
cause to file the lodged documents under seal so the information therein
remains confidential.  (See
12/6/24 Minute Order).
 
The Court finds that the supplemental declarations
sufficiently address the issues noted in the Court’s 12/6/23 Minute Order.  As such, the PAGA Settlement will be
approved.  Plaintiff’s counsel is ordered
to submit a new proposed Order stating: 
 
The Court, having read and
considered the stipulation of the parties and the declarations of Jessica
Ornelas, Sam Donabedian, Jodey Lawrence and Annie Bishop filed in support
thereof and good cause appearing therefor, 
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT this
Court approves of the PAGA settlement in the underlying case as follows: 1) The
PAGA settlement of $11,000.00 gross settlement is fair, just, and reasonable;
2) Attorney Fees in the amount of $1,100.00 is approved; 3) PAGA administration
costs in the amount of $2,850.00 is approved; and 4) the distribution of
$5,287.50 to the state of California and $1,762.50 to the aggrieved employees
is fair, just, and reasonable and approved. 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.

Honorable Melvin D. Sandvig
 
 
 
                                                                       
           
Thereafter, Plaintiff is ordered to file a stipulation
dismissing the action without prejudice with the Court retaining jurisdiction
pursuant to CCP 664.6.
