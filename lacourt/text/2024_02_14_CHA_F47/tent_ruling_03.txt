SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises out of an “Operating Agreement”
entered on 5/5/20 between Defendant Mom’s Haus, LLC (Mom’s Haus) and Plaintiff
Geneva Fontenette (Plaintiff).  The
“Operating Agreement” was signed by Defendant Marc Davis (Davis) on behalf of
Mom’s Haus, LLC.  Pursuant to the
“Operating Agreement,” Mom’s Haus was purchasing the restaurant Mom’s Bar-B-Que
House from Plaintiff.  
 
Pursuant to the agreement, Mom’s Haus was to pay
Plaintiff a total of $70,000.000 with $35,000.00 due on 5/1/20 and the
remaining balance paid in 24 monthly installments of $1,458.33 to begin not
less than 90 days after the expiration of the California statewide mandate on
business closures pursuant to the Covid-19 pandemic.  (See Complaint , Ex.B).
 
The complaint alleges that Davis began making the monthly
payments in July 2021.  (Complaint
¶8).  However, Davis did not make the
November and December 2021 payments due a dispute regarding the security deposit
for the lease of the restaurant. 
(Complaint ¶9).  Plaintiff further
alleges that Davis failed to make the April and May 2022 payments because of a
dispute regarding taxes Plaintiff allegedly owed on the business.  (Complaint ¶10).  Plaintiff alleges that “Defendant” stopped
making payments after December 2022. 
(Complaint ¶¶11-12).  Plaintiff
alleges that “Defendant” defaulted on 10 of 24 payments for a total of
“approximately $14,583.30.”  (Complaint
¶13).
 
On 6/7/23, Plaintiff filed the instant action against
Davis and Mom’s Haus for: (1) Financial Elder Abuse, (2) Unfair Business
Practices, (3) Breach of Contract, (4) Breach of Covenant of Good Faith and
Fair Dealing, (5) Unjust Enrichment and (6) Negligent Misrepresentation.  After meet and confer efforts failed to
resolve all of the issues Defendants had with the complaint, on 12/28/23,
Defendants filed and served the instant demurrer to the entire complaint on Plaintiff’s
former counsel.  Plaintiff’s current
counsel has waived the defect in service and on 1/31/24 filed and served an
opposition to the demurrer.  (See
Opposition, p.2:15-16).
 
ANALYSIS
 
The opposition states that Plaintiff will delete the 2nd,
4th, 5th and 6th causes of action in a First
Amended Complaint and indicates that the demurrer to these causes of action
should be sustained without leave to amend. 
(See Opposition, p.4:20-27, p.5:21-22).  As such, the Court will not address
Defendants’ arguments to those causes of action.
 
1st cause of action – Financial Elder Abuse
 
First, the complaint incorrectly identifies the elder who
allegedly suffered financial elder abuse as “decedent Thomas E. Schertz.”  (Complaint ¶15).   
 
Welfare and Institutions Code 15610.30 provides: 
 
“(a) ‘Financial abuse’ of an elder
or dependent adult occurs when a person or entity does any of the following:
(1) Takes, secretes, appropriates,
obtains, or retains real or personal property of an elder or dependent adult
for a wrongful use or with intent to defraud, or both.
(2) Assists in taking, secreting,
appropriating, obtaining, or retaining real or personal property of an elder or
dependent adult for a wrongful use or with intent to defraud, or both.
(3) Takes, secretes, appropriates,
obtains, or retains, or assists in taking, secreting, appropriating, obtaining,
or retaining, real or personal property of an elder or dependent adult by undue
influence, as defined in Section 15610.70.
(b) A person or entity shall be
deemed to have taken, secreted, appropriated, obtained, or retained property
for a wrongful use if, among other things, the person or entity takes,
secretes, appropriates, obtains, or retains the property and the person or
entity knew or should have known that this conduct is likely to be harmful to
the elder or dependent adult.
(c) For purposes of this section, a
person or entity takes, secretes, appropriates, obtains, or retains real or
personal property when an elder or dependent adult is deprived of any property
right, including by means of an agreement, donative transfer, or testamentary
bequest, regardless of whether the property is held directly or by a
representative of an elder or dependent adult.
(d) For purposes of this section,
“representative” means a person or entity that is either of the following:
(1) A conservator, trustee, or
other representative of the estate of an elder or dependent adult.
(2) An attorney-in-fact of an elder
or dependent adult who acts within the authority of the power of attorney.”
 
Statutory claims, such as a claim for financial elder
abuse, must be pled with particularity.  See
Covenant Care, Inc. (2004) 32 C4th 771, 790; Carter (2011) 198
CA4th 396, 410.  The opposition concedes
that Plaintiff’s complaint fails to allege that Plaintiff qualifies as an elder
under the Elder and Dependent Adult Abuse Act. 
(See Opposition, p.3:24-26). 
Even if the complaint identified the correct plaintiff and alleged that
Plaintiff was over 65 years of age at the time of the conduct alleged, the complaint  fails to allege sufficient specific facts to
state a claim for financial elder abuse. 
The facts alleged indicate a possible breach of contract, not the type
of egregious conduct the Elder and Dependent Adult Abuse Act was intended to
address.  
 
3rd cause of action – Breach of Contract
 
The complaint and the opposition to the demurrer
confusingly state that Plaintiff is making a claim for breach of a life
insurance contract.  (See
Complaint p.5:1; Opposition, p.5:2-6). 
Since a life insurance contract does not appear to be at issue in this
case, it is not clear what contract is the subject of the 3rd cause
of action.
 
CONCLUSION
 
The demurrer to the 1st and 3rd
causes of action is sustained with 30 days leave to amend.  The demurrer to the 2nd, 4th,
5th and 6th causes of action is sustained without leave
to amend.
