English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling denies the petition for writ of mandate filed by Robert L. Warnock, Jr. and Stephenie Lucio against the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority Board of Directors. The petitioners alleged that the Board violated the Ralph M. Brown Act by holding a meeting by teleconference on April 28, 2022, without providing notice to petitioners and without a finding that a state of emergency continued to impact the ability of the members to meet in person. The Judge finds that petitioners failed to meet their burden to demonstrate how the Board violated the Brown Act because they did not file an opening brief or administrative record. The Court exercises its discretion to deny the petition under Rule of Court 3.1113(a).
