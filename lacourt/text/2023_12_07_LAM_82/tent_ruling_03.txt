[TENTATIVE] RULING ON VERIFIED PETITION FOR
  PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE 
 
Dept. 82 (Hon. Curtis A. Kin)
 




 


 


 


 



            Petitioner John Nguyen petitions for
a writ of mandate directing respondent Board of Fire and Police Commissioners
for the City of Los Angeles to set aside its decision finding that his permanent
incapacity to work is not connected to the discharge of his duties as a police
officer and to find that his permanent incapacity is service connected. 
 
I.       Factual Background
 
A.          
Hiring
of Petitioner by Los Angeles Police Department
            
Petitioner John Nguyen began
working as police officer for the Los Angeles Police Department (“LAPD”) in
March 2008. (AR 1, 93.) Petitioner became a member of Tier 5 of the Los Angeles
Fire and Police Pension System (“LAFPP”). (AR 93.) 
 
As part of the hiring
process, petitioner submitted to a physical examination in December 2007. (AR
239-49.) Petitioner was 46 years of age and weighed 160 pounds. (AR 243, 245.) Petitioner
reported a history of heart disease in his immediate family. (AR 240, 242.) Petitioner
told the examining doctor that he was experiencing elevated cholesterol for two
years and was taking 600 milligrams of gemfibrozil twice a day. (AR 241, 242.)
 
 
 
 
1.           
Patrol Officer Assignment
 
In 2009, petitioner was
assigned to the Jail Division at LAPD. (AR 191.) Petitioner was next assigned
to the West Valley Patrol Division as a patrol officer. (AR 196.) From 2011 to
2013, petitioner worked as a Gang Enforcement Officer. (AR 15, 201.) 
 
One night in 2013,
petitioner tried to make a pedestrian stop of a gang member, who immediately
fled. (AR 15.) Petitioner chased after the gang member and grabbed the gang
member’s jacket. (AR 15.) The gang member shot at petitioner but missed. (AR
15-16.) Petitioner reportedly feared for his life and relives the encounter every
day. (AR 16, 96.)
 
2.           
Transfer to Administrative
Assignments
 
Petitioner was reassigned
to administrative jobs for the next five years. During 2013 and 2014 in the
Personnel Division, Return to Work Section, petitioner “facilitate[d]
reasonable accommodations, track[ed] employees who are sick, injured on duty, and
employees who have temporary or permanent restrictions.” (AR 209.) During 2014
and 2015 in the Metropolitan Division – M Platoon-Administrative Division, petitioner
completed various reports, “assisted with paperwork and logistics . . .
accumulated and analyzed statistical data . . . [and] worked on various
administrative projects as needed.” (AR 217.) From 2016 to 2018, petitioner was
assigned to the Training Division of the Reserve Officer and Volunteer Unit,
where petitioner provided administrative support, served as drill instructor
for Reserve Academy classes, and coordinated training and other activities
department wide. (AR 225, 229.) Petitioner also recruited and mentored
potential Reserve candidates. (AR 225, 229.)
 
3.           
Field Training Officer
          
In March 2018, petitioner
returned to uniformed patrol. (AR 233.) In addition to patrol duties, petitioner
trained probationary police officers as a Field Training Officer. (AR 233.) Due
to having responsibility for the training and safety of new police officers,
petitioner found field training stressful. (AR 13.) Petitioner stopped working
in April 2019. (AR 17.)
 
B.          
Extracurricular Concerns
 
1.           
Private Security
 
Starting in January 2012,
during petitioner’s six weeks of annual vacation, he worked 8 to 15 hours per
week as security for a private employer. (AR 25, 102.) Petitioner sat at a desk
and signed employees in and out of a restricted area. (AR 25.) In 2017 and
2018, petitioner worked security for a different private employer for 40 hours
per year. (AR 102.) 
2.           
Family Concerns
 
In November 2011,
petitioner was referred to Behavioral Sciences Services (“BSS”) by his captain.
(AR 251.) Petitioner’s son was abusing methamphetamine, and petitioner
witnessed his son attempting suicide. (AR 251-53.) The psychologist recommended
counseling and referred petitioner to someone who could help with the
hospitalization of his son. (AR 253.) 
 
C.          
Triple Bypass Surgery
 
On April 30, 2019,
petitioner presented to the Emergency Department at Kaiser. (AR 296.)
Petitioner reported experiencing chest tightness while walking with his wife
one week prior, as well as since the previous night. (AR 296.) Rahaf Damlakhi,
M.D. performed a history and physical. (AR 303.) Dr. Damlakhi noted that
petitioner was “on Lipitor and aspirin daily.” (AR 303.) Petitioner had been
prescribed Lipitor “to reduce risk of heart attacks and strokes.” (AR 303.) Dr.
Damlakhi also noted that, while petitioner did not have a history of heart
disease, petitioner had a “strong family history of heart disease . . . CAD
[coronary artery
disease] in his father,
mother and brother” and “hx [history] of stroke in his father.” (AR 303.) 
 
            On May 1 and 2, 2019, petitioner was examined by general
and interventional cardiologists. (AR 306-22.) Petitioner underwent a nuclear
stress test and was found to be ischemic. (AR 113, 312.) Petitioner’s laboratory
test showed “significant elevation of cholesterol (249 mg) and serum
triglycerides (570 mg)” (AR 135 [medical report by independent cardiologist],
311 [Kaiser record].) After performance of a heart catheterization, petitioner
was diagnosed with “ACS [acute coronary syndrome] with Severe multi-vessel CAD
with decreased flow in LAD [left anterior descending], mild LV [left ventricular]
systolic dysfunction[.]” (AR 318.) Coronary artery disease “is caused by a
build-up of fatty material within the walls of the arteries,” which “narrows
the inside of the arteries, limiting the supply of oxygen-rich blood to the
heart muscle.” (AR 68.) 
 
On May 3, 2019, petitioner
received triple coronary artery bypass graft surgery at Hoag Hospital. (AR 329,
421.) Petitioner tolerated the procedure well and was discharged on May 8,
2019. (AR 421.)
 
D.          
Application for
Disability Retirement
 
On January 31, 2020,
petitioner filed an application for disability pension benefits. Petitioner
claimed a disability of “hypertension/heart” beginning on April 29, 2019 that
prevented him from working. (AR 94.) Petitioner asserted that the disability
was service connected, claiming that the “day to day physical demands,
stressful events, irregular eating habits, all caused my heart disabilities.”[1] (AR
94.) 
 
In connection with
petitioner’s application, four physicians examined petitioner. A summary of
each physician’s medical report follows.
 
1.           
Medical Report by Marc L.
Ladenheim, M.D.
 
 On April 21, 2021, cardiologist Marc L.
Ladenheim, M.D. examined petitioner for one hour. (AR 112.) Dr. Ladenheim remarked
that petitioner “has been on treatment for hypertension, which was diagnosed
after his surgery and for high cholesterol, which was diagnosed a number of
years ago.” (AR 113.) Petitioner’s “cholesterol pattern was characterized by
high triglycerides, and elevated non-HDL cholesterol consistent with higher
risk.” (AR 113.) 
 
            Dr. Ladenheim stated that petitioner’s hyperlipidemia
poses a major risk factor for coronary artery disease. (AR 114.) The report
also mentions that both of petitioner’s parents had history of coronary
disease. (AR 114.) Petitioner’s brother “one time felt a bout of coronary
artery disease, but apparently he is healthy.” (AR 114.) 
 
            Dr. Ladenheim opined: “[Petitioner’s] work environment
with physical demands and psychologically stressful situations could have
contributed to the development of his heart disease, but it is not likely the
predominant cause.” (AR 114.) According to Dr. Ladenheim, petitioner may have
inherited a genetic risk factor for heart disease based on the history of
petitioners’ parents. (AR 115.)
 
            Dr. Ladenheim found no possibility for petitioner to
return to a full or restricted level of activity. (AR 115.) Noting petitioner’s
complaints of atypical chest pain and shortness of breath, particularly with
exertion, which were consistent with having had extensive surgery, Dr.
Ladenheim opined: “Clearly, this applicant cannot return to his prior work
environment with the extremely high physical and psychological demands of his
job. He cannot be in a high intensity, anxiety provoking environment or
situation requiring high level physical stress. He would be incapable of
performing his duties. He does not have the physical or psychological
well-being to perform his duties as a police officer. His symptoms cannot be
controlled with a modified lifestyle or diet, over the counter medications, or
prescription medication.” (AR 115.) 
 
2.           
Medical Report by R.
Nihal Goonetilleke, M.D.
 
On April 21, 2021,
cardiologist R. Nihal Goonetilleke, M.D. examined petitioner for one hour and
reviewed petitioner’s medical records. (AR 134.) Dr. Goonetilleke noted that
petitioner’s father underwent coronary bypass grafting in his 70s. (AR 136.)
Petitioner’s mother underwent a coronary angioplasty with stenting in her 80s.
(AR 136.) Petitioner did not know of any family history of
hypercholesterolemia. (AR 136.) Dr. Goonetilleke noted that petitioner’s six
siblings and three adult children were in good health without any documented
coronary artery disease. (AR 136.)
 
According to Dr. Goonetilleke,
petitioner was “clearly overweight,” as petitioner was five feet six inches and
weighed 202 pounds. (AR 136.) Dr. Goonetilleke noted a diagnosis of
“[p]ronounced dyslipidemia,” based on prior documentation of “markedly elevated
total cholesterol and serum triglyceride levels.”  (AR 135, 137.) 
 
Dr. Goonetilleke opined,
“The predominant source of his impairment can be related to a strong family
history of coronary artery disease affecting both parents, the claimant's
hypertension, dyslipidemia, and significant obesity.” (AR 138.)
 
3.           
Rebuttal Report by Sean
Leoni, M.D.
 
On January 18, 2022, internal
medicine physician Sean Leoni, M.D., prepared a report to rebut the reports of
Dr. Ladenheim and Dr. Goonetilleke. (AR 104-10.) Dr. Leoni treated petitioner
beginning in 2019 in connection with his workers’ compensation claim. (AR 483-85.)
Petitioner told Dr. Leoni that his father had a coronary bypass graft at 74
years of age and that his mother had a stent placed at the age of 79. (AR 105.)
None of petitioner’s siblings have cardiovascular issues. (AR 105.) Petitioner
reported that he was taking Lipitor prior to the 2019 injury. (AR 105.) 
 
Dr. Leoni disagreed with
the reports of Dr. Ladenheim and Dr. Goonetilleke, attributing their opinions
to their failure to consider the responsibilities of a police officer. (AR
108.) Opining that stress can increase the risk of heart attack, Dr. Leoni
stated that “stress leaves the blood vessels tightly wound,” leaving “blood
vessels…unable to respond properly to the change in blood demands (i.e.
expanding and contracting to accommodate different amounts of blood flow).” (AR
109.)
 
Based on a review of petitioner’s
job classification and job description, Dr. Leoni noted the stressors of
petitioner’s job. (AR 108.) These stressors include “daily stress with suspects
that at times involve getting into fights and altercations with armed felons,
foot pursuits, and car chases on a daily basis.” (AR 104.) Petitioner was
required to wear 25 pounds of heavy equipment, including a bulletproof vest and
firearms. (AR 104.) Petitioner was also required to enter and exit vehicles while
carrying equipment, including a helmet, extra magazines, and ballistic shields,
that weighed as much as 40 pounds. (AR 104.) Petitioner climbed fences and
walked up flights of stairs. (AR 104.) Petitioner’s shift was extended during
unusual occurrences. (AR 104.) Petitioner lacked healthy eating choices at
times and exercise during night shifts, according to Dr. Leoni. (AR 104.) 
 
With respect to
petitioner’s duties as a Field Training Officer, Dr. Leoni stated that mental
stress resulted from “having an inexperienced rookie, sometimes 2 rookies, which
created a lot of stress to be out in the field facing dangerous disturbance
situations, daily interactions with dangerous individuals, persons with
impaired mental status, drug users, and suicidal persons.” (AR 105.) Dr. Leoni
described petitioner as having “maintained a constant extremely high level of
alert and vigilant state of mind,” with petitioner being “unable to bring the
level down” when he left work. (AR 105.) 
 
With respect to family
history of heart disease, Dr. Leoni opined: “For the family history to be
contributory, the mother has to have had known coronary artery disease before
the age 50 and the father has to have had known coronary artery disease before
age of 55 to be considered a risk factor.” (AR 109.) While noting petitioner’s
risk factor of hyperlipidemia, Dr. Leoni attributed petitioner’s disability to “his
job as a police office [sic] for LAPD since 2008 through 2019.” (AR 109 [“[I]n
my opinion this is predominant and convincing evidence that the job stressors
that are outlined above have caused Mr. Nguyen’s disability”].)
 
4.           
Independent Medical
Examination by L.V. Alonso, M.D.
 
On September 20, 2019,
internal medicine physician L.V. Alonso examined petitioner for one and a half
hours and prepared a report. (AR 487-88.) Dr. Alonso did not have petitioner’s
medical records at the time he prepared the report. (AR 492.) During the
examination, petitioner told Dr. Alonso that he experienced chest pain and
shortness of breath but attributed the conditions to stress and did not give
them much importance. (AR 489.)
 
Dr. Alonso set forth stressors
at work that petitioner experienced, which are similar to the stressors set
forth by Dr. Leoni. (Compare AR 488-89 with AR 104-05.) Dr.
Alonso opined: “With reasonable medical probability, Mr. Nguyen’s heart
condition is of industrial causation, due to repetitive stress, and strain
associated with years of as a patrol, and field training officer.” (AR 493.) According
to Dr. Alonso, the physiological responses from chronic stress, including an
increase in blood pressure and heart contractility, have “adverse effects on
the cardiovascular system, increasing risk of cardiovascular morbidity, and
mortality.” (AR 494.) Dr. Alonso noted the “higher incidence of coronary artery
disease in first responders has been well documented in the literature.” (AR
494.) 
 
While Dr. Alonso noted
petitioner’s mother’s history of coronary heart disease, he characterized
petitioner’s heart condition as industrial in nature because none of
petitioner’s siblings have heart disease. (AR 494.) Dr. Alonso invoked Labor
Code § 3212 in asserting that petitioner’s “heart trouble” is presumed to
be industrial and not subject to apportionment.[2] (AR
494.) 
 
On November 15, 2019, having
received petitioner’s medical records from 2007 to 2019, Dr. Alonso prepared a
summary of the records. (AR 505-16.) A lab report from 2007 “revealed elevated cholesterol
at 247, high triglyceride at 326, high LDL at 133, and borderline
cholesterol/HDL at 5.0.” (AR 506; see also AR 508 [elevated levels of
cholesterol and triglycerides in 2010].) Petitioner was diagnosed with
hyperlipidemia in 2007. (AR 506.) In 2012, a lab result “revealed elevated
cholesterol at 216, high triglycerides at 586, and high cholesterol/HDL at 6.8,
and low HDL at 32.” (AR 510.) In 2014, petitioner’s treating physician noted
that petitioner “had not been taking his cholesterol medication regularly.” (AR
512.) Petitioner’s cholesterol and lipid levels remained elevated through 2018.
(AR 513.) 
 
On May 29, 2020, Dr.
Alonso reexamined petitioner for one hour. (AR 543-44.) Dr. Alonso reasserted
that petitioner’s coronary artery disease is presumed industrial and not
subject to apportionment. (AR 550.) With respect to petitioner’s hypertension,
Dr. Alonso recommended an apportionment of 60% industrial, “due to repetitive
stress and strain associated from years of work in active duty law
enforcement,” and 40% nonindustrial, “due to familiar cardiovascular risk
factors, and natural progression of essential hypertension, which is
essentially a non-industrial condition.” (AR 550.) 
 
E.          
LAFPP Staff Report and
Board Hearing
 
On February 3, 2022,
LAFPP staff recommended that petitioner “be granted a nonservice-connected
disability pension of 40% for his hypertension/heart only, and due to the
nature of his disability, no foreseeable purpose would be served in requiring
periodic medical examinations.” (AR 61.)
 
On February 3, 2022, the Board
of Fire and Police Pension Commissioners (“Board”) held a hearing on
petitioner’s application for disability retirement. (AR 3.) Petitioner
testified that he did not have any blood pressure or heart-related issues at
the time he was hired. (AR 10-11.) Petitioner also testified to the aspects of
the job that he found stressful, including being responsible for the safety of
rookie police officers, the unpredictability of the events occurring upon
responding to radio calls. (AR 12-16.) Petitioner also testified that he still has
chest pain, shortness of breath, and fatigue. (AR 17-18.) 
 
With respect to whether
his brother has cardiovascular issues, he stated that his brother did not have
any such issues. (AR 29-30.) Petitioner explained that, when he presented to
Kaiser, he was sedated. (AR 30.) According to petitioner, his wife either
provided the wrong information in a panic or miscommunicated because she speaks
little English. (AR 30.) 
 
Counsel for petitioner
argued that petitioner qualified for a service-connected disability pension.
(AR 33-35.) Counsel argued that Dr. Ladenheim and Dr. Goonetilleke did not assess
or ask petitioner about his stress at work. (AR 30-31, 33-34.) Counsel also
noted that petitioner’s parents had heart disease at a much later age than
petitioner. (AR 33.) 
 
The Board unanimously voted
to grant petitioner a nonservice-connected disability pension of 50%. (AR
43-45.) The Board determined that the “discharge of [petitioner’s] duties was
not the predominant cause of his impairment caused by his hypertension/heart
pursuant to City of Los Angeles Administrative Code Section 4.2006(b).” (AR 2.)
The Board’s determination was incorporated into the Findings of Fact issued on
March 17, 2022. (AR 1-2.) 
 
II.      Procedural History
 
             On August 30, 2022, petitioner filed a verified
Petition for Writ of Mandate.  On July 24,
2023, petitioner filed an opening brief. On August 23, 2023, respondents filed
an opposition. On September 5, 2023, petitioner filed a reply. The Court has
received the administrative record and the joint appendix. 
 
III.     Standard of Review
 
Under CCP § 1094.5(b),
the pertinent issues are whether the respondent has proceeded without
jurisdiction, whether there was a fair trial, and whether there was a
prejudicial abuse of discretion. An abuse of discretion is established if the
agency has not proceeded in the manner required by law, the decision is not
supported by the findings, or the findings are not supported by the evidence.
(CCP § 1094.5(b).)
 
A disability pension benefit
is a fundamental vested right. (See Strumsky v. San Diego County Employees
Retirement Assn. (1974) 11 Cal.3d 28, 45 [service-connected death benefits
to widow of police officer found to be fundamental vested right].) Accordingly,
the Court exercises its independent judgment on the administrative findings. (See
Wences v. City of Los Angeles (2§009)
177 Cal.App.4th 305, 314; Bixby v. Pierno
(1971) 4 Cal.3d 130, 143.) Under the independent judgment test, “the trial
court not only examines the administrative record for errors of law, but also
exercises its independent judgment upon the evidence disclosed in a limited
trial de novo.” (Bixby, 4 Cal.3d at 143.) The court must draw its own reasonable
inferences from the evidence and make its own credibility determinations. (Morrison v. Housing Authority of the City of
Los Angeles Board of Commissioners (2003) 107 Cal. App. 4th 860, 868.)  
 
An agency is presumed to
have regularly performed its official duties. (Evid. Code § 664.) “In
exercising its independent judgment, a trial court must afford a strong
presumption of correctness concerning the administrative findings, and the
party challenging the administrative decision bears the burden of convincing
the court that the administrative findings are contrary to the weight of the
evidence.”  (Fukuda v. City of Angels (1999) 20 Cal.4th 805, 817, internal
quotations omitted.) A reviewing court “will not act as counsel for either
party to an appeal and will not assume the task of initiating and prosecuting a
search of the record for any purpose of discovering errors not pointed out in
the briefs.” (Fox v. Erickson (1950)
99 Cal.App.2d 740, 742.) When an appellant challenges “‘the sufficiency of the
evidence, all material evidence on the point must be set forth and not merely
their own evidence.” (Toigo v. Town of Ross (1998) 70 Cal.App.4th 309,
317.)  
 
“On questions of law
arising in mandate proceedings, [the Court] exercise[s] independent judgment.’”
(Christensen v. Lightbourne (2017) 15
Cal.App.5th 1239, 1251.) The interpretation of statute or regulation is a
question of law. (See State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Quackenbush
(1999) 77 Cal.App.4th 65, 71.)
 
IV.     Analysis
 
            As a preliminary matter, respondent Board’s
request to take judicial notice of Los Angeles Charter Code §§ 1102 and 1106
and Los Angeles Administrative Code (“LAAC”) § 4.2006 is GRANTED, pursuant to
Evidence Code § 452(b). 
 
            Petitioner John Nguyen seeks a writ
of mandate directing respondent Board of Fire and Police Pension Commissioners
for the City of Los Angeles to (1) set aside its decision to grant him a
nonservice-connected disability pension of 50% and (2) grant petitioner a
service-connected disability pension and reconsider the percentage of his final
compensation. (Pet. Prayer ¶ 1.) 
 
A.          
Standard
in Finding Disability was Service-Connected
 
Section
1102 of the Los Angeles City Charter created the Board of Fire and Police
Pension Commissioners to manage and control the pension system for police
officers. (RJN Ex. A.) Under section 1106(a)(1) of the City Charter, the Board
has “sole and exclusive responsibility to administer its system . . . to
provide benefits to system participants and their beneficiaries and to assure
prompt delivery of those benefits and related services.” (Ibid.) 
 
“The
Board shall have the power to hear and determine all matters pertaining to the
granting and denying of any such application or request for a disability
pension.” (Id. at LAAC § 4.2006(c).) With respect to finding a
service-connected disability for Tier 5 plan members like petitioner, LAAC §
4.2006(a) states: “A Tier 5 Plan Member’s incapacity is caused by the discharge
of his or her duties if there is clear and convincing evidence that the discharge
of the Plan Member’s duties is the predominant cause of the incapacity.” (RJN
Ex. A.) 
 
“Clear
and convincing” evidence requires “a finding of high probability,” with
evidence “so clear as to leave no substantial doubt” and “sufficiently strong
to command the unhesitating assent of every reasonable mind.” (In re Angelia
P. (1981) 28 Cal.3d 908, 919, internal quotations omitted.) 
 
B.          
Evaluation
of Evidence
 
Upon
reviewing the evidence, the Court finds that the weight of the evidence
supports the Board’s conclusion that petitioner’s disability of
“hypertension/heart” was not predominantly caused by the discharge of his
duties and was accordingly nonservice connected. 
 
            After having examined petitioner and
reviewed petitioner’s medical records, Dr. Ladenheim, a cardiologist, found
that petitioner’s work environment, with its physical demands and
psychologically stressful situations, was “not likely the predominant cause” of
his heart disease. (AR 114.) Dr. Ladenheim acknowledged that the cause of
petitioner’s heart disease is unclear. (AR 114-15.) Nevertheless, based on petitioner’s
“significant lipid abnormality” and his parents’ history of coronary heart
disease, Dr. Ladenheim opined that petitioner had “extensive asymptomatic
artery disease” until he developed ischemic symptoms in April 2019 and had
coronary bypass surgery on May 3, 2019. (AR 114-15.) 
 
            After having examined petitioner and
reviewed petitioner’s medical records, Dr. Goonetilleke, a cardiologist, found
that the “predominant source of [petitioner’s]
impairment can be related to a strong family history of coronary artery disease
affecting both parents, the claimant's hypertension, dyslipidemia, and
significant obesity.” (AR 138.) Notwithstanding the dispute of whether
petitioner’s brother had heart issues (compare AR 29-30 [petitioner denying
brother had heart problems] with 114 [Dr. Ladenheim noting brother had a
bout of coronary heart disease]), Dr. Goonetilleke noted that petitioners’
parents were treated for heart disease in their 70s and 80s. (AR 136.) Dr.
Goonetilleke also noted the documentation of petitioner’s “markedly elevated
total cholesterol and serum triglyceride levels” evidencing “[p]ronounced
dyslipidemia” (AR 137.)
 
            Petitioner’s lipid abnormality is acknowledged
in Dr. Alonso’s summary of petitioner’s medical records, which evidenced a
history of elevated cholesterol and triglyceride levels from 2007 to 2018. (AR 506,
508, 512, 513.) Petitioner was taking gemfibrozil prior to working for the
LAPD. (AR 241.) Petitioner was prescribed Lipitor daily to reduce the risk of
heart attack. (AR 105, 303.) 
 
            The reports of Dr. Ladenheim and Dr.
Goonetilleke cast sufficient doubt on whether job-related stress was the
predominant cause of petitioner’s coronary artery disease. 
 
            Petitioner argues that the reports of
Dr. Ladenheim and Dr. Goonetilleke do not indicate that the physicians asked petitioner
about the stresses of his job or considered the stressors of his job.  That appears to be true. Dr. Ladenheim and
Dr. Goonetilleke did not engage in an analysis of the aspects of petitioner’s
job that could have caused stress, as Dr. Leoni did in his rebuttal report. (AR
104-05.) Dr. Ladenheim and Dr. Goonetilleke also did not discuss how stress
could cause heart disease and hypertension, as Dr. Leoni and Dr. Alonso did in
their reports. (AR 108-09 [Dr. Leoni], 493-94 [Dr. Alonso].) 
 
Nevertheless,
petitioner’s hyperlipidemia predated his employment with the LAPD. (AR 242, 507.)
Further, petitioner’s family history with heart disease also predated his role
as a police officer. (AR 115 [petitioner may
have had genetic risk factor].) Both Dr. Ladenheim and Dr. Goonetilleke opined
that family history and hyperlipidemia are
factors or causes for heart disease. (AR 114, 138.) Given petitioner’s
preexisting conditions or factors for heart disease, the Court does not find in
its independent judgment review that there is clear and convincing evidence
that job-related stress is the predominant cause of petitioner’s disability. 
 
As for the reports of Dr.
Leoni and Dr. Alonso, the Court notes that neither doctor is a cardiologist.
Dr. Leoni is petitioner’s treating physician for his workers’ compensation
claim. (AR 23-24, 483-85.) Dr. Alonso provided an independent medical
examination for petitioner’s workers’ compensation claim. (AR 487-96.) While
both doctors describe how stress could cause heart disease and while Dr.
Leoni opined that family history does not explain petitioner’ s heart condition
because his parents did not have known coronary artery disease in their 50s (AR
109), neither doctor provides any meaningful explanation of how petitioner’s
preexisting condition of hyperlipidemia could not be the predominant
cause of his heart disease. 
 
The Court also notes that
Dr. Alonso invoked Labor Code § 3212 in asserting that petitioner’s “heart
trouble” is presumed to be industrial.[3] (AR
494.) Here, that Labor Code presumption is not incorporated into the Los
Angeles Administrative Code. Importantly, a different standard applies in
determining whether petitioner is entitled to a finding that his disability was
service connected. 
 
            Apart from reliance on his doctors’ opinions,
petitioner also suggests that the medical directive of one of the doctor’s on
whom respondent relies actually supports petitioner’s claim, positing: “If Dr.
Ladenheim restricts Mr. Nguyen from performing work in a ‘high physical and psychologically
demanding position,’ wouldn’t that position also be the predominant cause of
his admitted permanent incapacity?” (Reply at 7:10-12; see also Opening
Br. at 12-13 [“[I]f the job is not a predominant factor, why is Dr. Ladenheim
restricting Petitioner from physical and emotional demands of his job?”].) Petitioner’s
supposition, however, does not necessarily and logically flow from Dr.
Ladenheim’s medical advice.  The fact
that petitioner may not be able to return to work due to his disability does
not necessarily mean that his work was the predominant cause of the disability,
particularly, where, as here, the record indicates a preexisting, underlying
condition of hyperlipidemia and family history. 
 
At best, crediting the
reports of the four physicians in the administrative record, petitioner’s
condition was exacerbated by the stress of his duties as a police officer. But,
when considering the record as a whole, the Court does not find clear and
convincing evidence that petitioner’s duties as a police officer were the
predominant cause of petitioner’s disability.
 
V.      Conclusion
 
            The petition is DENIED.
