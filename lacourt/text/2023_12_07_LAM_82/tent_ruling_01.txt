LOS ANGELES COUNTY METROPOLITAN TRANSPORTATION
  AUTHORITY BOARD OF DIRECTORS,
 
 


 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Respondent,
 


[TENTATIVE] RULING ON AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION
  FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
 
Dept. 82 (Hon. Curtis A. Kin)
 
 




 


 


 


 



            Petitioners Robert L. Warnock, Jr.
and Stephenie Lucio petition for a writ of mandate declaring the April 28, 2022
meeting held by respondent Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority
Board of Directors to be null and void.
 
I.       Factual Background
 
On
April 28, 2022, the Board of Directors (“Board”) of the Los Angeles County
Metropolitan Transportation Authority (“MTA”) held a meeting and approved the
North Hollywood to Pasadena Bus Rapid Transit Corridor Project (“BRT Project”).
Under the BRT Project, one lane on each side of Colorado Boulevard from Eagle
Rock Boulevard to Linda Rosa Avenue would become a dedicated bus lane.
 
The
April 28, 2022 meeting took place by teleconference. Petitioners Robert L.
Warnock, Jr. and Stephenie Lucio allege that the Board violated the Ralph M.
Brown Act, Government Code §§ 54950-54963 (“Brown Act”), by holding the meeting
by teleconference rather than in person. The Board allegedly failed to find by
majority vote within 30 days of the April 28, 2022 meeting that a state of
emergency continued to impact the ability of the members to meet in person, as purportedly
required by Government Code § 54953(e).
 
Petitioner
Warnock signed a petition against the BRT Project in August 2019. Petitioner
Lucio emailed the MTA with approximately 600 petitions, including Warnock’s
petition, on August 14, 2019.
Warnock allegedly received no notice of the April 28, 2022 meeting at least 72
hours before the meeting, as purportedly required by Government Code § 54954.1.

 
The
Board also allegedly violated Government Code § 54954.3 by restricting public
comments to one minute.
 
Based
on the alleged violations of the Brown Act, petitioners seek a declaration that
the April 28, 2022 Board Meeting is null and void.
 
II.      Analysis
 
The
Brown Act “requires the meetings of such bodies to be open to the public, held
on a regular schedule, and conducted in accordance with an agenda available in
advance of the meeting.” (Olson v. Hornbrook Community Services Dist.
(2019) 33 Cal.App.5th 502, 514; see Gov. Code §§ 54950-54954.)
 
Government
Code § 54953(e)(1) allows a legislative body to use teleconferencing without complying
with subdivision (b)(3) of section 54953, pertaining to access of
teleconference locations to the public, if, not later than 30 days after
teleconferencing for the first time and every 30 days thereafter, the
legislative body finds by majority vote that (1) the state of emergency
continues to directly impact the ability of members to meet safely in person or
(2) state or local officials continue to impose or recommend measures to
promote social distancing.
 
Government
Code § 54954.1 allows any person to request that a copy of the agenda of any meeting
of a legislative body be mailed or emailed to that person. Government Code § 54954.2(a)(1)
requires the legislative body of a local agency to post an agenda in a location
that is freely accessible to the public and on the agency’s website at least 72
hours before a regular meeting.
 
Government
Code § 54954.3 allows the legislative body of a local agency to adopt
reasonable regulations which limit the total amount of time each individual
speaker may provide testimony during a meeting.
 
Government
Code §§ 54960 and 54960.1 set forth procedures for enforcing the Brown Act. Section
54960(a)(1) states: “The district attorney or any interested person may
commence an action by mandamus, injunction, or declaratory relief for the
purpose of stopping or preventing violations or threatened violations of this
chapter by members of the legislative body of a local agency or to determine
the applicability of this chapter to ongoing actions or threatened future actions
of the legislative body, or to determine the applicability of this chapter to
past actions of the legislative body, subject to Section 54960.2….” Section
54960.1(a) states in pertinent part: “The district attorney or any interested
person may commence an action by mandamus or
injunction
for the purpose of obtaining a judicial determination that an action taken by a
legislative body of a local agency in violation of Section 54953, 54954.2,
54954.5, 54954.6, 54956, or 54956.5 is null and void under this section.”
 
On
June 20, 2022, petitioners Robert L. Warnock, Jr. and Stephenie Lucio filed a
verified petition for writ of mandate. On July 13, 2022, petitioners filed an amended
verified petition for writ of mandate.
 
The
petition for writ of mandate is brought pursuant to CCP § 1085. (FAP ¶ 5.)
“There are two essential requirements to the issuance of a traditional writ of
mandate: (1) a clear, present and usually ministerial duty on the part of the
respondent, and (2) a clear, present and beneficial right on the part of the
petitioner to the performance of that duty.” (California Assn. for Health
Services at Home v. State Dept. of Health Services (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th
696, 704.) “An action in ordinary mandamus is proper where…the claim is that an
agency has failed to act as
required
by law.” (Id. at 705.)
 
An
agency is presumed to have regularly performed its official duties. (Evid. Code
§ 664.) “The petitioner always bears the burden of proof in a mandate
proceeding brought under Code of Civil Procedure section 1085.” (California
Correctional Peace Officers Assn. v. State Personnel Bd. (1995) 10 Cal.4th
1133, 1154.)
 
Petitioners
also refer to CCP § 1094.5 in the operative First Amended Petition. (FAP ¶ 5.)
Under CCP § 1094.5, “the party challenging the administrative decision bears
the burden of convincing the court that the administrative findings are
contrary to the weight of the evidence.” (Fukuda v. City of Angels
(1999) 20 Cal.4th 805, 817; see also Bixby v. Pierno (1971) 4 Cal.3d 130, 139.)
“In a section 1094.5 proceeding, it is the responsibility of the petitioner to
produce a sufficient
record
of the administrative proceedings; ‘otherwise the presumption of regularity
will prevail, since the burden falls on the petitioner attacking the
administrative decision to demonstrate to the trial court where the
administrative proceedings were unfair, were in excess of jurisdiction, or showed
“‘prejudicial abuse of discretion.’” (Elizabeth D. v. Zolin (1993) 21
Cal.App.4th 347, 354.)
 
A
memorandum of points and authorities is required for a noticed motion,
including for mandamus. (See CRC 3.1113(a); Local Rule 3.231(b)
[describing noticed motion procedure for prerogative writs].) The absence of a
memorandum is an admission that the motion is not meritorious and may be
denied. (CRC 3.1113(a).) “The memorandum must contain a statement of facts, a
concise statement of the law, evidence and arguments relied on, and a
discussion of the statutes, cases, and textbooks cited in support of the
position advanced.” (CRC 3.1113(b); see also Local Rule 3.231(i)(2)
[opening brief must cite to administrative record].)
 
Rule
of Court 3.1113 “rests on a policy-based allocation of resources, preventing
the trial court from being cast as a tacit advocate for the moving party’s
theories”. (Quantum Cooking Concepts, Inc. v. LV Associates, Inc. (2011) 197
Cal.App.4th 927, 934.) A reviewing court “will not act as counsel for either
party to an appeal and will not assume the task of initiating and prosecuting a
search of the record for any purpose of discovering errors not pointed out in
the briefs.” (Fox v. Erickson (1950) 99 Cal.App.2d 740, 742.) The Court
cannot evaluate arguments that are not made in the briefs and cannot make the
parties’ arguments for them. (Nelson v. Avondale HOA (2009) 172
Cal.App.4th 857, 862-63 [argument waived if not raised]; Pfeifer v.
Countrywide Home Loans, Inc. (2012) 211 Cal.App.4th 1250, 1282 [same].)
 
On
September 29, 2022, the Court (Hon. Mary H. Strobel) held a trial setting
conference. (9/29/22 Minute Order.) The Court ordered petitioners to serve and
file the opening brief 60 days prior to the hearing date of July 25, 2023. (Ibid.)
The parties were to provide evidence either through a joint record lodged with
the reply brief or, if the parties could not agree on a joint record, by
appending the evidence to the parties’ respective briefs. (Ibid.)
 
            On August 10, 2023, the instant writ
petition was heard. The Court issued a tentative ruling denying the petition
because petitioners did not file an opening brief or an administrative record.
(8/10/23 Minute Order at 4.) During the hearing, counsel for the parties
stipulated to the continuance of the hearing to allow for full briefing. (Id.
at 5.) Based on counsel for petitioners’ representation that the opening brief
was prepared and could be filed forthwith, the Court ordered the opening brief
to be filed and served by August 11, 2023. (Ibid.) 
 
No
administrative record was ever lodged with the Court.[1]
Although evidence appears to be attached to the First Amended Petition, no
opening brief with citations to evidence was timely filed, either by the
deadline provided by the Court during the trial setting conference or the
deadline provided by the Court during the hearing on August 10, 2023.[2]

Accordingly,
petitioners fail to meet their burden to demonstrate how respondent Los Angeles
County Metropolitan Transportation Authority Board of Directors violated the
Brown Act. Pursuant to Rule of Court 3.1113(a), the Court exercises its
discretion to deny the petition.
 
III.     Conclusion
 
            The
petition is DENIED.
