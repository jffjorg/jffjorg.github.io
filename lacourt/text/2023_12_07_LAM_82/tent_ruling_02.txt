[1]           Petitioners untimely filed a request
for judicial notice on December 4, 2023. The request states that four exhibits
are attached thereto. No exhibits were attached to the request for judicial
notice. 
 


[2]           On December 4, 2023—three court days
before the hearing on the instant petition—petitioners  filed an opening brief. “A trial court has
broad discretion under rule 3.1300(d) of the Rules of Court to refuse to
consider papers served and filed beyond the deadline without a prior court
order finding good cause for late submission.” (Bozzi v. Nordstrom, Inc.
(2010) 186 Cal.App.4th 755, 765; see also CRC 3.1300(d) [“If the court,
in its discretion, refuses to consider a late filed paper, the minutes or order
must so indicate”].) Because petitioners flagrantly violated the Court’s order
to file the opening brief on August 11, 2023—which was prepared and ready to be
filed according to petitioners’ counsel—and respondent has not had a reasonable
opportunity to oppose the late-filed opening brief, the Court exercises its
discretion and declines to consider the opening brief. The Court further notes
that the proof of service attached to the opening brief falsely states the
brief was served on respondent on May 23, 2023. (9/13/23 Ghanshyam Decl. ¶¶ 4-6
& Ex. A.)
