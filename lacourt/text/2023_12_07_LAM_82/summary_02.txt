And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling addresses the petitioners' untimely filing of a request for judicial notice and their late filing of an opening brief. Despite the petitioners' counsel stating that the opening brief was prepared and ready to be filed on August 11, 2023, it was not filed until December 4, 2023, three court days before the hearing. The court declines to consider the late-filed opening brief, citing the broad discretion under Rule 3.1300(d) of the Rules of Court to refuse to consider papers served and filed beyond the deadline without a prior court order finding good cause for late submission. Additionally, the court notes that the proof of service attached to the opening brief falsely states that the brief was served on the respondent on May 23, 2023.
