The Judge notes that Labor Code ยง 3212 states that heart trouble that develops or manifests itself during employment will be presumed to have arisen out of and in the course of the employment, unless controverted by other evidence. The Judge will determine if the Petitioner's heart trouble arose out of and in the course of employment.
