Summary in English:

The Judge's tentative ruling sustains Rusnak/Pasadena's demurrer to the Avanessians' Complaint with leave to amend. The case is a lemon law action, where the Avanessians alleged that their 2020 Audi A4 was delivered with defects and failed to make unspecified repairs. Rusnak/Pasadena demurred to the Avanessians' fourth cause of action for negligent repair, arguing that it is barred by the economic loss rule and fails to allege sufficient facts to state a claim. The Judge finds that the Avanessians' negligent repair action is based on a contractual duty to repair and that they have not alleged any facts establishing an independent noncontractual duty. The Judge also finds that the economic loss rule applies to the case, as the Avanessians' damages are purely economic and unaccompanied by physical or property damage. The Judge notes that there is an exception to the economic loss rule for professional services contracts, but the Avanessians do not provide any binding authority that establishes whether vehicle repair service contracts meet this exception. The Judge sustains the demurrer with leave to amend, allowing the Avanessians to refile their complaint and allege additional facts to support their claim.
