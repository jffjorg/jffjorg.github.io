TENTATIVE
RULING
 
Defendant Rusnak/Pasadena’s Demurrer to Plaintiffs’
Complaint is SUSTAINED with ten (10) days leave to amend.
 
BACKGROUND
 
This is a lemon law action. On December 3, 2020, Plaintiffs
Hamlet Avanessian and Ayris Avanessian allegedly entered into a
warranty contract with Defendant Volkswagen Group of America, Inc. (Volkswagen)
by leasing a 2020 Audi A4. The Avanessians allege the vehicle was delivered
with transmission, electrical, suspension, engine, and structural system
defects.
 
On May 15, 2023, the Avanessians filed a complaint against
Defendants Volkswagen, Rusnak/Pasadena, and Does 1-10, alleging (1) breach of
express warranty, (2) breach of implied warranty, (3) violation of Song-Beverly
Act section 1793.2, subdivision (b), and (4) negligent repair.
 
On July 21, 2023, Rusnak/Pasadena filed the present
demurrer. On September 25, the court continued the hearing for parties to
further meet and confer. On October 2, Rusnak/Pasadena’s counsel met and
conferred telephonically with the Avanessians’ counsel. (Bell Suppl. Decl., ¶ 11.)
 
A hearing on the present demurrer and a case management
conference are both set for October 23, 2023.
 
ANALYSIS

Rusnak/Pasadena demurs to the Avanessians’
fourth cause of action for negligent repair on the grounds that it is (1)
barred by the economic loss rule and (2) fails to allege sufficient facts to
state a claim. For the following reasons, the court SUSTAINS Rusnak/Pasadena’s
demurrer with leave to amend.
 
Legal Standard

Demurrer
 
A party may demur to a complaint on the
grounds that it “does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of
action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (e).) A demurrer tests whether the
complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147
Cal.App.4th 740, 747 (Hahn).) When considering demurrers, courts accept
all well pleaded facts as true. (Fox v. JAMDAT Mobile, Inc. (2010) 185
Cal.App.4th 1068, 1078.) In a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent
on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial notice. (Donabedian v.
Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) “A demurrer tests the
pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters. Therefore, it
lies only where the defects appear on the face of the pleading or are
judicially noticed.” (SKF Farms v. Superior Court (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d
902, 905.) “The only issue involved in a demurrer hearing is whether the
complaint, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous matters, states a cause of
action.” (Hahn, supra, at p. 747.)
 
Economic Loss Rule
 
The economic loss rule prevents tort recovery for “‘purely
economic losses,’ meaning financial harm unaccompanied by physical or property
damage.” (Sheen v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (2022) 12 Cal.5th 905, 922.)
This is because “conduct amounting to a breach of contract becomes tortious
only when it also violates a duty independent of the contract arising from
principles of tort law.” (Erlich v. Menezes (1999) 21 Cal.4th 543, 551.)
Economic loss can include “damages for inadequate value, costs of repair and
replacement of the defective product or consequent loss of profits.” (Robinson
Helicopter Co., Inc. v. Dana Corp. (2004) 34 Cal.4th 979, 988 (Robinson),
quoting Jimenez v. Superior Court (2002) 29 Cal.4th 473, 482 (Jimenez).)
 
Discussion
 
In
this case, the Avanessians allege Rusnak/Pasadena owed them a duty “to use ordinary care and skill in
storage, preparation, and repair of the Subject Vehicle in accordance with
industry standards.” (Complaint, ¶ 61.) But it is unclear if this alleged duty
is contractual or based on an independent duty. When it is unclear if an action arises from a contract or
noncontractual duty, “the action will be considered based on contract rather
than tort.” (Arthur L. Sachs, Inc. v. City of Oceanside (1984) 151 Cal.App.3d
315, 322.) Thus,
because the Avanessians’ negligent repair action is based on a contractual duty
to repair and they have not alleged any facts establishing an independent
noncontractual duty, their fourth cause of action is barred by the economic
loss rule.
 
The Avanessians contend there is an exception to the
economic loss rule for professional services contracts. Indeed, such an
exception does exist to ensure “that the consumer receives the services the
professional agreed to provide.” (Sheen v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (2022)
12 Cal.5th 905, 933.) “In such settings, professionals generally agree to
provide ‘careful efforts’ in rendering contracted-for services,¿but ‘most
clients do not know enough to protect themselves by inspecting the
professional’s work or by other independent means.’” (Ibid, quoting
Rest.3d Torts, Liability for Economic Harm (June 2020) § 4, com. a., p. 22.)
Such professional services can include those offered by doctors, attorneys,
accountants, and stockbrokers. (See Neel v. Magana, Olney, Levy, Cathcart
& Gelfand (1971) 6 Cal.3d 176, 188.) However, the Avanessians do not
provide any binding authority that establishes whether vehicle repair service
contracts meet this exception.
 
The Avanessians also rely on Jimenez which holds
“California decisional law has long recognized that the economic loss rule does
not necessarily bar recovery in tort for damage that a defective product (e.g.,
a window) causes to other portions of a larger product (e.g., a house) into
which the former has been incorporated.” (Jimenez, supra, 29
Cal.4th at p. 483.) But the Avanessians fail to allege how Rusnak/Pasadena’s
failure to make unspecified repairs caused damage to other subcomponents of the
vehicle. (Complaint, ¶ 59-62.)
 
Accordingly, Rusnak/Pasadena’s demurrer to this cause of
action is SUSTAINED with leave to amend.
 
CONCLUSION
Based on the
foregoing, Rusnak/Pasadena’s demurrer to the
Avanessians’ Complaint is SUSTAINED with ten (10) days leave to amend as
to the fourth cause of action.
