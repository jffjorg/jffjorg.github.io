  Case Number:  21PSCV00036    Hearing Date:   October 23, 2023    Dept:  G Plaintiff Pacific Western Bank’s Motion for Award of
Attorneys’ Fees
Respondent: NO OPPOSITION
TENTATIVE RULING
Plaintiff Pacific Western Bank’s Motion for Award of
Attorneys’ Fees is GRANTED.
BACKGROUND
This
is a breach of contract action arising from a loan agreement. On April 19,
2016, Plaintiff Pacific Western Bank agreed to loan $22,000 to Defendant Howard
Gordon Schlick with a maturity date of April 19, 2017, according to a
promissory note and business loan agreement executed by Schlick. Subsequently,
the principal loan amount was increased to $200,000, the maturity date was
extended to July 19, 2019, and Defendants William and Howard Schlick, trustees
of The 2003 Jeanne M. Schlick Irrevocable Trust U/D/T Dated
March 13, 2003 (Schlick Trustees), were added to the loan agreement as
co-borrowers.
Pacific
Western Bank alleges Schlick and the Schlick Trustees (collectively,
Defendants) defaulted on the loan agreement after failing to make payment in
full by July 19, 2019. On August 9, Pacific Western Bank sent a letter to
Defendants advising them that they were in default and requesting payment in
full by August 23. After receiving no payment, Pacific Western Bank sent
Defendants a second letter on January 9, 2020 that requested payment in
full no later than November 9. Pacific Western Bank alleges they still did not
receive full payment of the loan.
On
January 14, 2021, Pacific Western Bank filed a complaint against Defendants and
Does 1-100, alleging the following causes of action: (1) breach of contract,
(2) account stated, (3) money lent, and (4) unjust enrichment.
On March 22,
2023, Pacific
Western Bank filed a motion for summary adjudication. On June 8, the court
granted their motion and entered judgment against Defendants.
On July
12, 2023, Pacific Western Bank filed the present motion. A hearing on the
motion is set for October 23.
REQUEST FOR JUDICIAL
NOTICE
Pacific Western Bank’s
request for judicial notice of the judgment entered in this action is GRANTED.
ANALYSIS
Pacific
Western Bank moves for the award of $9,525 in attorney fees. For the following
reasons, the court GRANTS their motion.
Legal
Standard
“Except as attorney’s fees
are specifically provided for by statute, the measure and mode of compensation
of attorneys and counselors at law is left to the agreement, express or
implied, of the parties; but parties to actions or proceedings are entitled to
their costs . . . .” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1021.)¿ The prevailing party on a
contract, which specifically provides for attorney fees and costs incurred to
enforce the agreement, is entitled to reasonable attorney fees in addition to
other costs.¿ (Civ. Code, § 1717, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1032, 1033.5,
subd. (a)(10)(A).)¿ The court, upon notice and motion by a party, shall
determine the prevailing party and shall fix, as an element of the costs of
suit, the reasonable attorney fees.¿ (Civ. Code, § 1717, subd. (a), (b).)
“The amount to be awarded to
a party as attorney fees is a matter within the sound discretion of the trial
judge.” (Contractors Labor Pool, Inc. v. Westway Contractors, Inc. (1997)
53 Cal.App.4th 152, 168.) In determining the reasonableness of an attorney fees
award, the court considers “the nature, difficulty, intricacy and importance of
the litigation, the amount involved, the skill required and success of the
attorney's efforts, his or her learning, age and experience, and the time
consumed.” (Id., at p. 169.)
Discussion
In this case, the initial
promissory note and business loan agreement both allow for the award of
attorney fees. (Parrish Decl., Ex. 1, p. 3; Ex. 2, p. 5.) The court also finds
Pacific Western Bank is the prevailing party as they successfully obtained
summary adjudication of their breach of contract claim against Defendants and
dismissed the remaining causes of action. Thus, the court now considers whether
their requested award of attorney fees is reasonable.
Here, Pacific Western Bank’s
counsel charged $1,000 in fixed fees and $8,525 for thirty-one hours of work at
$275 an hour. Utilizing the lodestar approach and based upon the totality of
the circumstances, the court finds this amount of attorney fees reasonable and GRANTS
Pacific Western Bank’s motion.
CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, Pacific
Western Bank’s motion for award of attorney fees is GRANTED.
