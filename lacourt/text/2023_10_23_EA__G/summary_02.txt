And here is a brief English summary:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by the Cruz Trustees to the First Amended Cross-Complaint (FACC) filed by the Cruz Defendants. The court sustains the demurrer to the second and third causes of action (financial elder abuse and intentional interference with right of inheritance) with leave to amend, and overrules the demurrer to the first cause of action (defamation). The court finds that the Cruz Trustees have standing to bring a claim for financial elder abuse, but that Esteban lacks standing to bring a claim for intentional interference with right of inheritance. The court also finds that an adequate probate remedy existed, which bars Esteban's intentional interference with right of inheritance claim.
