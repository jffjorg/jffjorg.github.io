 Case Number:  21STCV33629    Hearing Date:   April 5, 2024    Dept:  29 Motion for Terminating Sanctions filed by Defendant Mina
George Baskharon.
 
Tentative
The motion is denied.
Background
This case arises
from an motor vehicle accident that allegedly occurred on August 19, 2020.  Plaintiff Naser Baharloo (“Plaintiff”) filed the
Complaint in this action on September 13, 2021, asserting causes of action for motor
vehicle negligence and general negligence against Defendant Mina George Baskharon (“Defendant”), and Does 1
through 10.  Defendant filed an Answer on
March 22, 2023.
 
On March
11, 2024, Defendant filed this motion for terminating sanctions. No opposition
has been filed.
 
Legal Standard
When a party fails to obey a
court order compelling further responses to interrogatories or requests for
production, “the court may make those orders that are just, including the
imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction
under Chapter 7 ….  In lieu of, or in
addition to, that sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 ….”  (Code Civ. Proc., §§
2030.300, subd. (e) & 2031.310, subd. (i).)
In Chapter 7 of the Civil Discovery Action, section 2023.030,
subdivisions (a)-(d), authorizes monetary sanctions, issue sanctions, evidence
sanctions, and terminating sanctions against anyone engaging in conduct that is
a “misuse of the discovery process.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030.)  In
section 2023.010, a “misuse of the discovery
process” is defined to include (among other things) failing to respond or to
submit to an authorized method of discovery; making, without substantial
justification, an unmeritorious objection to discovery; making an evasive
response to a discovery request; disobeying a court order to provide discovery;
and making or opposing, unsuccessfully, a motion to compel without substantial
justification. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subds. (d)-(h).)
The Civil Discovery Act provides for an escalating and
“incremental approach to discovery sanctions, starting with monetary sanctions
and ending with the ultimate sanction of termination.” (Lopez v. Watchtower
Bible & Tract Society of New York, Inc. (2016) 246 Cal.App.4th
566, 604.) Discovery sanctions should be appropriate to and commensurate
with the misconduct, and they “should not exceed that which is required to
protect the interests of the party entitled to but denied discovery.” (Doppes
v. Bentley Motors, Inc. (2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 967, 992.) “If a lesser
sanction fails to curb misuse, a greater sanction is warranted: continuing
misuses of the discovery process warrant incrementally harsher sanctions until
the sanction is reached that will curb the abuse.” (Ibid.; see also,
e.g., Mileikowsky v. Tenet Healthsystem (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th
262, 279-280.) 
Terminating sanctions should be used sparingly. (Doppes, supra, 174
Cal.App.4th at p. 992; R.S. Creative, Inc. v. Creative Cotton, Ltd. (1999)
75 Cal. App. 4th 486, 496.) “Although in extreme cases a court has the
authority to order a terminating sanction as a first measure, a terminating
sanction should generally not be imposed until the court has attempted less
severe alternatives and found them to be unsuccessful and/or the record clearly
shows lesser sanctions would be ineffective.” (Lopez, supra, 246 Cal.App.4th
at p. 604.)  But where discovery violations are “willful,
preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe
sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial
court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction.” (Doppes, supra, 174
Cal.App.4th at p. 992.) Repeated and willful violations of discovery orders
that prejudice the opposing party may warrant a terminating sanction. (Creed-21
v. City of Wildomar (2017) 18 Cal.App.5th 690, 702; Los
Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 377, 390; Biles
v. Exxon Mobil Corp. (2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1327; Lang v.
Hachman (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 1225, 1246; Collisson X Kaplan
v. Hartunian (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 1611, 1617-1622.)
The
primary purpose of discovery sanctions is to obtain compliance with the Civil
Discovery Act and the Court’s orders. It is not to punish. (Newland v.
Super. Ct. (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 608, 613; Ghanooni v. Super
Shuttle of Los Angeles (1993) 20 Cal.App.4th 256, 262.) A discovery
sanction should not create a “windfall” for a party or place a party in a
better position than it would have been if the opposing party had simply
complied with its obligations under the Court’s orders and the Civil Discovery
Act. (Rutledge v. Hewlett-Packard Co. (2015) 238 Cal.App.4th 1164,
1194; see also 2 Weil & Brown, California Practice Guide: Civil Procedure
Before Trial (The Rutter Group 2023), ¶¶ 8:2214-2220.)
A “terminating sanction issued solely because of a
failure to pay a monetary discovery sanction is never justified.”  (Newland, supra, 40 Cal.App.4th at p.
615.)
Discussion
Defendant requests terminating sanctions as Plaintiff has
failed to comply with the Court’s order of February 8, 2024, requiring
Plaintiff to serve responses to form interrogatories, special interrogatories,
and requests for production, and the Court’s orders of February 7 and 8, 2024,
for the payment of sanctions. 
 
Plaintiff’s
failure to provide discovery responses is a substantial misuse of the discovery
process.  So is the violation of a court
order.  Serious sanctions are warranted
for this discovery abuse.  
For terminating sanctions, however, a party
must present evidence of repeated and willful misuse of the discovery process,
as well as evidence that less severe sanctions have
not (or likely will not) lead to compliance with the discovery rules.  Defendant has not, on this record at this
time, made such a showing.  There has not been a showing of a history or pattern of
willful abuse or repeated violations that have not been (or cannot be) cured by
lesser sanctions.
Moreover, a discovery sanction should not
create a “windfall” for a party or place a party in a better position than it
would have been if the opposing party had simply complied with its obligations
under the Court’s orders and the Civil Discovery Act. (Rutledge, supra, 238
Cal.App.4th at p. 1194.)  Here, at this
time, a terminating sanction would create such a windfall for Defendant.
Accordingly,
the Defendant’s request for terminating sanctions is DENIED. 
Defendant’s
request for a further monetary sanction is GRANTED.  Defendant has shown further misuse of the
discovery process by Plaintiff; Plaintiff’s conduct is not substantially
justified, and it would not be unjust to impose a further monetary sanction on
Plaintiff for this further discovery abuse. 
The Court sets sanctions in the amount of $817.65, the cost of bringing
this motion. (Mittskus Decl., ¶ 12.) 
The
denial as to terminating sanctions is without prejudice to Defendant in seeking
other sanctions or seeking a terminating sanction at a later stage of the
proceedings, based on a further showing of misuse of the discovery process.
Conclusion
The Court DENIES Defendant’s request for
terminating sanctions
The Court GRANTS Defendant’s
request for a further monetary sanction.
The Court
ORDERS Plaintiff and his attorney of record, Steven Slavitt, Esq., jointly and
severally, pay monetary sanctions under the Civil Discovery Act in the amount
of $817.65 within 30 days of notice of this order.
Moving
Party is ordered to give notice.
