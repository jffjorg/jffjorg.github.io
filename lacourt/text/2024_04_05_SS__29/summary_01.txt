And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to compel the deposition of the defendant's Person Most Knowledgeable (PMQ) without prejudice. The plaintiff has the right to take the deposition, but must comply with certain statutory requirements, including contacting the deponent to inquire about non-appearance and providing a declaration stating that the petitioner has done so. Since the plaintiff failed to provide such a declaration, the motion is denied. The judge notes that the plaintiff's motion must be accompanied by a declaration stating that the petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire about non-appearance, and that the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 of the Civil Discovery Act if the motion is granted.
