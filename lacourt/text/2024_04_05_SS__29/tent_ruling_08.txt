 Case Number:  22STCV22480    Hearing Date:   April 5, 2024    Dept:  29 Two
petitions for approval of minor’s compromises
 
Tentative:
 
 
The Court excuses the personal appearance of the claimant and the
guardian ad litem. Counsel may appear by telephone or video conference
call.  
 
The Court has reviewed the two petitions, Claimant Sima Burton’s
petition filed on October 24, 2023, and Claimant Ben Burston’s petition filed
on January 11, 2024. 
 
The Court finds the Petition for Ben Burston satisfies all substantive
and procedural requirements and includes all necessary documents and
attachments.  The Petition is GRANTED.
 
The Court finds that the Petition for Sima Burson, with one
exception, satisfies all substantive and procedural requirements and includes
all necessary documents and attachments. 
The one exception is that Petitioner has not submitted the required Proposed
Order to Deposit Funds Into Blocked Account (MC-355).  If that Proposed Order is submitted prior to
the hearing, the Court will be prepared to GRANT the petition and to set an OSC
for proof of deposit of funds into blocked account; if not, the Court will
briefly continue the hearing so that the proposed order may be submitted.
 
Moving party is ordered to give notice.
