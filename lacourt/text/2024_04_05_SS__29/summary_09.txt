And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the motion to continue trial filed by the Defendants, Jason Matthew Chapman and Viola Chapman. The motion is based on the fact that the Defendants have filed a motion for summary judgment, which is set to be heard on January 6, 2025, after the current trial date of June 25, 2024. The Judge finds that the Defendants have established good cause to have their motion for summary judgment heard, and therefore grants the motion to continue trial. The trial date is advanced and continued to late February 2025, and all deadlines are reset accordingly.
