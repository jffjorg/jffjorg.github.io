And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling indicates that the court will excuse the personal appearance of the claimants and their guardian ad litem, and instead counsel may appear by telephone or video conference. The court has reviewed two petitions for approval of minor's compromises, filed by Sima Burton and Ben Burston. The court finds that Ben Burston's petition satisfies all substantive and procedural requirements and grants the petition. Sima Burton's petition, however, lacks the required Proposed Order to Deposit Funds Into Blocked Account (MC-355), and the court will grant the petition only if this order is submitted prior to the hearing. If not, the hearing will be briefly continued to allow for the submission of the proposed order. The moving party is ordered to give notice.
