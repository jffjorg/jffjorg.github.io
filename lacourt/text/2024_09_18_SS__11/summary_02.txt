And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in an anti-SLAPP motion to strike that was filed by Camacho and Coalition against City. The judge has concluded that the privilege applies to the malpractice cause of action and that it prevents the privilege from being neutered. The judge has also ruled that the privilege extends to steps taken prior to or after judicial proceedings and that it is irrelevant whether the communications at issue were made with malice or intent to harm. The judge has also rejected City's arguments that the privilege should not apply because the litigation was not under serious consideration and that it would create perverse incentives related to litigation.
