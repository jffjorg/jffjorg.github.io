Significant Statements:
  - "The anti-SLAPP motion is a procedural remedy, designed to quickly identify and dispose of lawsuits brought to chill the valid exercise of a party's constitutional right of petition or free speech."
  - "The litigation privilege provides that a publication or broadcast made as part of a judicial proceeding is privileged."
  - "Producing information responsive to a settlement as part of litigation is necessary and useful. It connects to, and furthers the objects of, the litigation, especially here where Camacho purposefully filed his lawsuit to obtain officer names and photos."
  - "The Court declines to analyze City's minimal-merit argument."
