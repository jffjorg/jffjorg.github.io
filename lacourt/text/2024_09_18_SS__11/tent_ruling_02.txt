On June 18, 2024, the Court granted Camacho’s and Coalition’s anti-SLAPP
motions to strike as to City’s cross-claims. 
(See id. at pp. 2-5.)

This finding applies to the malpractice cause of action as well.  Plaintiffs allege multiple breaches of duty,
but the gravamen of the claim is that “Defendants breached their legal duty of
care . . . by producing the photographs of undercover officers, including
Plaintiffs, to Camacho for the Camacho lawsuit.”  (FAC, ¶ 111.) 
To repeat, the required production occurred at the same time on the same
flash drive as the overproduction and was not “merely incidental[.]”  (Collondrez, supra, 61 Cal.App.5th
at 1049.)


 
[3] “The privilege is not limited to statements made
during judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings.” 
(Edmon & Karnow, supra, at ¶ 7:1015.1.)  “It may extend to ‘steps taken prior thereto,
or afterwards.’”  (Ibid.)  And “[i]t is irrelevant whether the
communications at issue were made with malice or intent to harm.”  (Ibid.)

The upshot of this analysis is that it prevents the
privilege from being neutered.  Allowing
Plaintiffs to use words like “mistake,” “negligent,” “reckless,” etc. to get
around the privilege would render the privilege toothless.
 
Also,
the Court believes this analysis applies with equal force to Plaintiffs’
arguments about whether the litigation was under serious consideration, whether
Defendants “undertook their litigation obligations . . . seriously[,]” or
whether applying the privilege here would create perverse incentives related to
litigation[.]”  (Opposition, pp. 15, 16.)
