And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case 21SMCV00085, setting a hearing date for September 20, 2024. At the last hearing, the plaintiff appeared, but the defendant did not. The court found that the bond was in good form and sufficient, and is inclined to grant the request to stay the judgment and recall the writ as to Chayes, who is the only person named in the bond. However, Lei is not named in the bond, and the court believes that it is technically possible that the judgment could be reversed as to Chayes and affirmed as to Lei. To address this possibility, the court is directing the defense to add Lei to the bond, which can be done without increasing the bond amount. Once Lei is added, the court will recall the writ and stay the judgment. If there are any issues with adding Lei, the court will hear the matter and determine what to do.
