And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is frustrated with the lack of cooperation between the parties in setting a deposition date. The plaintiff served a deposition notice on November 30, 2023, and the defendant objected, citing their location in Egypt and the need for careful coordination. The defendant suggested alternative dates, but the plaintiff did not respond. The defendant then became ill with COVID-19 and requested another delay, which the plaintiff did not accept. The plaintiff filed a motion to compel the deposition, and the defendant suggested a date in August 2024, which was not accepted. The defendant then suggested a date in June 2024, which was accepted, but was later postponed due to the defendant's illness. The defendant then suggested a date in September 2024, which the plaintiff did not accept.

The judge is disappointed that the parties did not communicate better and is ordering a deposition date to be set. The judge is ordering the parties to list three dates not earlier than October 9, 2024, and not later than October 30, 2024, and for the plaintiff to pick one of those dates. The deposition will be remote and will be conducted on the chosen date, with breaks for lunch and the afternoon.

The judge is denying the plaintiff's request for sanctions, as the court is not convinced that the rules for deposing a party in a foreign country are clear. The court believes that the defendant should have done more to cooperate, but is uncertain about the appropriate sanctions.
