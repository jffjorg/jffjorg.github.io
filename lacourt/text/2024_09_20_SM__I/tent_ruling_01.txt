  Case Number:  21SMCV00085    Hearing Date:   September 20, 2024    Dept:  I At the last hearing, plaintiff appeared but defendant did
not.  The matter was continued until
today on plaintiff’s assurance that the Sheriff had been called and told to
take no action on the writ pending the hearing. 
At the last hearing, the court found that the bond was in good form and
of sufficient amount.  Thus, the court is
inclined to grant the request as to Chayes, who is the only person named in the
bond, and plaintiff does not seem to oppose staying the judgment and recalling
the writ as to Chayes.  However, Lei is
not named in the bond.  While (as
defendants point out) the defense has been coordinated, that is not
sufficient.  There are technically two
appeals, and, although they have been consolidated, as a technical matter it is
possible that the judgment will be reversed as to Chayes and affirmed as to
Lei.  The court sees that as a remote
possibility, but it remains technically possible.  So the court believes that the right answer
is to continue holding everything in abeyance for a short time to allow Lei to
be added to the bond.  The bond amount
need not be increased—the judgment is joint and several—but she does need to be
added.  That ought to be a relatively
straightforward task given that there is no appreciable risk to the
surety.  Assuming that the defense can do
that promptly, the court will hold the writ and the judgment for a short time
to allow that to happen.  Once it does
happen, the court will recall the writ entirely and stay the judgment.  If there is some problem adding Lei, the
court will hear it and figure out what to do at that point.  As a practical matter, the writ will likely
need to be recalled to make it clear that it cannot be levied on Chayes’ sole
property, even if Lei is not added.
