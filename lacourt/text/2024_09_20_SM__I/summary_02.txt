And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the plaintiff's objections to discovery and believes them to be largely frivolous. The plaintiff's counsel claims to be having difficulty communicating with the plaintiff, but the judge does not find this to be a sufficient excuse for the plaintiff's lack of participation in discovery. The judge agrees with the defense that the plaintiff must participate in discovery to be a legitimate plaintiff. As a result, the judge will grant the defendant's motions to compel discovery. The plaintiff must serve verified responses to discovery without objections (except for privileged information) within 30 days, along with documents and a privilege log. If the plaintiff fails to do so, the defendant may bring a motion to compel and seek non-monetary sanctions.
