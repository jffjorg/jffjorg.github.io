And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is frustrated with the parties' lack of cooperation and unwillingness to follow the rules. The court has decided to continue the hearing until late December and will hold an informal discovery conference (IDC) before then to try and reach an agreement. The parties will submit a joint statement before the IDC, and the court will discuss the IDC date with them. The judge warns the plaintiff that discovery demands need to be clear and unambiguous, and warns the defendant against taking a hard line and hiding behind technicalities. The judge also expresses concerns about the defendant's potential use of alter ego assertions and financial discovery, and notes that if the defendant does not cooperate, it may be too late to present evidence at trial.
