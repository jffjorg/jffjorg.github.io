 Case Number:  23SMCV04284    Hearing Date:   September 20, 2024    Dept:  I The proposed judgment/order of dismissal appears
proper.  It expressly states that the
question of whether defendant is entitled to fees (as well as the amount if
defendant is found to be so entitled) is to be determined by later motion.  Nothing in the order suggests that fees are
(or are not) appropriate.  Therefore, it
accurately reflects the court’s instructions and the court will sign it.
