 Case Number:  23SMCV00161    Hearing Date:   September 20, 2024    Dept:  I These are three motions to compel.  The case arises from an auto accident.  Discovery was propounded on March 14,
2024.  Plaintiff responded with
essentially all objections.  Having
reviewed the objections, the court believes them to be largely frivolous and
they are STRICKEN.  Plaintiff’s counsel’s
reasoning is that counsel is having trouble communicating with plaintiff and
therefore can get no information so the objections were essentially
placeholders.  The parties had attempted
an IDC, but the recent ransomware attack took that off calendar.  
 
The court tends to agree with the defense here.  Counsel may be doing all that is possible,
but that does not excuse plaintiff.  If
plaintiff wants to be a plaintiff, plaintiff must participate in
discovery.  Plaintiff’s counsel seems to
agree that the responses as they stand are inadequate. 
 
The court will therefore GRANT the motions to compel.  Verified responses without objections other
than privilege will be served within 30 days. 
Documents and a privilege log will be served at the same time.  If plaintiff fails to do so, then defendant
may bring a motion to compel and seek sanctions other than monetary ones.  In a show of good will, defendant has not
sought sanctions in these motions.
