And here is a brief summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer and motion to strike filed by Julien Entertainment.com, Inc. The court sustains the demurrer to the sixth cause of action for unfair competition, without leave to amend, because the complaint fails to identify any particular section of the statutory scheme that was allegedly violated. The court also grants the motion to strike the seventh cause of action for negligence, which was added to the complaint without permission. The court orders Julien Entertainment to file and serve an answer to the first amended complaint (FAC) within 10 days of the date of this Order. The court also sets a status conference regarding the status of the litigation, including the fact that the plaintiff has passed away.
