[1]The Court addresses Julien Entertainment’s motion to
strike before Julien Entertainment’s demurrer because Julien Entertainment
moves to strike, inter alia, certain causes of action.


[2]The Court notes that August
24, 2023 is 36 days after July 19, 2023. 


[3]In his declaration in support of the demurrer, Julien
Entertainment’s counsel states, inter alia, that “[a]fter numerous
emails between counsel following the July 19, 2023 hearing, on Friday August
18, 2023, at 10:25 p.m., Plaintiff’s counsel finally sent me a redline version
of a proposed First Amended Complaint with a request that Julien’s stipulate to
its filing.” (Alperin Decl., ¶ 6.) Julien Entertainment’s counsel further
states that “[o]n August 24, 2023, I informed Plaintiff’s counsel that we would
not stipulate to the filing of the proposed FAC because it did not comply with
the Court’s July 19, 2023 Order and that Plaintiff’s counsel failed to provide
authority to support the allegation that Julien’s owed a duty to Plaintiff
based solely on receipt of a letter from counsel.” (Alperin Decl., ¶ 7.)
 


[4]In addition, the “Motion to Strike” at page 2 of the
motion solely concerns the sixth cause of action, paragraph 66 of the sixth
cause of action, the prayer for relief for the sixth cause of action, and the
seventh cause of action. 


[5]The July 19, 2023 Order on Julien Entertainment’s
demurrer to the original Complaint provides, inter alia, “[h]owever, as noted by Julien Entertainment, Plaintiff ‘identifies
no particular section of the statutory scheme which was violated…’ (Khoury v. Maly's of California, Inc., supra, at page 619.)”
(See July 19, 2023 Order at p.
6:2-5.)
