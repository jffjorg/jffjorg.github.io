Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

Judge Beaudet discloses her personal experience with a pickup truck, which she purchased 24 years ago. The truck developed electrical problems, and she and her husband took it back to the dealer multiple times. Eventually, the manufacturer and dealer agreed to refund the purchase price. Judge Beaudet does not believe that her experience will cause her to be biased in favor of or against either party. However, if a party believes otherwise, they have until February 21, 2024, to file and serve a verified statement of disqualification. The Case Management Conference will be continued to March 6, 2024, unless both parties waive the right to file such a statement.
