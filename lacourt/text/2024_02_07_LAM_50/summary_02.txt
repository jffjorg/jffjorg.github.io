And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is reviewing Julien Entertainment's motion to strike certain causes of action and their demurrer to the original complaint. Julien Entertainment's counsel has submitted a declaration stating that they will not stipulate to the filing of a proposed First Amended Complaint because it does not comply with the court's previous order and because Plaintiff's counsel failed to provide authority to support the allegation that Julien Entertainment owed a duty to the Plaintiff. The judge notes that the motion to strike only concerns certain specific causes of action and the prayer for relief. The judge will consider these facts and Julien Entertainment's demurrer before making a final ruling.
