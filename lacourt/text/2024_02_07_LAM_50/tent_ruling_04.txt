[1]The Court also
notes that Defendant
argues that “the Assignee’s unauthorized practice of law for the
Garcia tenants should be addressed. Assignee claims that Garcia assigned all
his rights in this civil action to her, very likely because they have agreed to
share any resulting property interest or profit. This amounts to unauthorized
practice of law…” (Opp’n at p. 3:17-20.) The Court notes that Defendant does
not provide any evidence in support of this assertion. The Court also notes
that the Plaintiff in the instant action is “Carmen King, Assignee for Antolin
Garcia.”
