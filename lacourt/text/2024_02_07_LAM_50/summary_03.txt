Summary:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's motion to consolidate the instant action with the unlawful detainer action. The case involves a dispute over the enforceability of an agreement between Antolin Garcia and Jorge Garcia, as well as questions of title to the subject property. The judge cites to the California Code of Civil Procedure section 1048 and the Martin-Bragg v. Moore case, which holds that when an unlawful detainer proceeding and an unlimited action concerning title to the property are simultaneously pending, the trial court may stay the unlawful detainer action until the issue of title is resolved in the unlimited action, or it may consolidate the actions. The judge finds that the parties' right to a full trial of the issue of title may be unfairly expedited and limited if the issue of title is tried under the summary procedures that constrain unlawful detainer proceedings.
