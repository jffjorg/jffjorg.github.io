The tentative ruling recommends denying the petitions filed on January 29, 2024, for the approval of compromise of pending action of minors Leylanni Barron and Leah Barron. The petitions were denied due to defects, including the absence of a written attorney fee agreement and the failure to identify the parties represented in Attachment 18a. Additionally, the petitioners failed to file an Order Approving Compromise of Claim (MC-351) for each minor claimant. The tentative ruling orders the petitioner to file a new petition curing the defects and provides a new hearing date. The moving party is required to give notice.
