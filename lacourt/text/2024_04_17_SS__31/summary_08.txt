And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to compel the plaintiff's deposition and to pay monetary sanctions. The defendant failed to submit a meet and confer declaration stating that they contacted the plaintiff to inquire about the nonappearance at the deposition. The judge also noted that the defendant did not provide any good faith attempts at rescheduling the deposition. The denial is without prejudice, allowing the defendant to re-file the motion with the required meet and confer declaration.
