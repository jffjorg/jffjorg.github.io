And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

This tentative ruling addresses a petition to approve a compromise of a pending action by a minor, Justin Sahnazoglu. The court has reviewed the settlement agreement, which was reached between the parties, and finds it to be fair and reasonable. However, the court notes that the Order Approving Compromise (MC-351) is missing, and therefore, the petition is conditionally granted upon the petitioner's filing of the required order. The court excuses the personal appearance of the claimant and allows counsel to appear by telephone or video conference.
