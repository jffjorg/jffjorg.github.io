The applicant's application was electronically posted to the TrueFiling website, but there is no proof of service indicating that Defendants and the State Bar were served. According to California Rules of Court, rule 9.40(c)(1), proof of service is required. Therefore, the application is denied without prejudice, and the parties are ordered to meet and confer to reach an agreement.
