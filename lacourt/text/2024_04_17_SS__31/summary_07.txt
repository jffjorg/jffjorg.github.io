The judge's tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's request for default judgment against the defendant, Issac Albert Sandoval, in the amount of $400,000 for general damages and $834.36 in costs. The court finds that the plaintiff has established damages as a result of the motor vehicle v. bicycle collision, including traumatic brain injury and a closed right clavicular fracture. However, the court reduces the amount of general damages from $2 million to $400,000 due to the lack of sufficient notice to the defendant of the amount of damages being sought. The court also finds that the plaintiff is entitled to costs of $834.36 for filing fee, process server's fees, and postage.
