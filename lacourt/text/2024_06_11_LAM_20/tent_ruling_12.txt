This is a lemon law matter.  Defendant Ford Motor Company demurs to the Complaint’s sixth cause of action for concealment for failure to state sufficient facts.When considering demurrers, courts read the allegations liberally and in context, and “treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded, but not contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law.” (Serrano v. Priest (1971) 5 Cal.3d 584, 591.)  “A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters. Therefore, it lies only where the defects appear on the face of the pleading or are judicially noticed. The only issue involved in a demurrer hearing is whether the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous matters, states a cause of action.”  (Hahn v. Mirda¿(2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.)  It is error “to sustain a demurrer without leave to amend if the plaintiff shows there is a reasonable possibility any defect identified by the defendant can be cured by amendment.”  (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital Dist.¿(1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 967.)“The required elements for fraudulent concealment are (1) concealment or suppression of a material fact; (2) by a defendant with a duty to disclose the fact to the plaintiff; (3) the defendant intended to defraud the plaintiff by intentionally concealing or suppressing the fact; (4) the plaintiff was unaware of the fact and would not have acted as he or she did if he or she had known of the concealed or suppressed fact; and (5) plaintiff sustained damage as a result of the concealment or suppression of the fact. [Citation.]”  (Graham v. Bank of America, N.A. (2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 594, 606.)There are “four circumstances in which nondisclosure or concealment may constitute actionable fraud: (1) when the defendant is in a fiduciary relationship with the plaintiff; (2) when the defendant had exclusive knowledge of material facts not known to the plaintiff; (3) when the defendant actively conceals a material fact from the plaintiff; and (4) when the defendant makes partial representations but also suppresses some material facts.”  (Heliotis v. Schuman (1986) 181 Cal. App. 3d 646, 651.)  In other words, where a “fiduciary relationship is not involved, a nondisclosure claim arises when the defendant makes representations but fails to disclose additional facts which materially qualify the facts disclosed, or which render the disclosure likely to mislead.”  (Roddenberry v. Roddenberry (1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 634, 666.)  Here, contrary to Ford’s arguments, the Complaint (1) adequately indicates that the defect at issue is a transmission defect; (2) there is a transactional relationship to the extent Ford issued a warranty (Dhital v. Nissan N. Am., Inc. (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 828, 843-44); (3) a duty to disclose is otherwise established by the allegation of Ford’s exclusive knowledge of the subject defect (see, e.g., Compl. ¶ 40); and (4) the application of the economic loss rule to fraudulent inducement claims such as the one here has been rejected (Dhital v. Nissan N. Am., Inc. (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 828 [“[U]nder California law, the economic loss rule does not bar plaintiffs’ fraudulent inducement claim.”].)   In sum, the Demurrer is overruled.  An answer is to be filed within twenty days.Moving party to give notice.If counsel do not submit on the tentative, they are strongly encouraged to appear by LACourtConnect rather than in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
