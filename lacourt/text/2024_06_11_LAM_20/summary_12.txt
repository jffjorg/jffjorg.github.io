And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling in a lemon law matter involving Ford Motor Company. The Plaintiff alleged that Ford concealed a material fact about a transmission defect, and Ford demurred to the Complaint's sixth cause of action for concealment. The Court has overruled the Demurrer, finding that the Complaint adequately states a cause of action. The Court held that the Plaintiff's allegations of concealment, including Ford's duty to disclose and its exclusive knowledge of the defect, were sufficient to state a cause of action. The Court also rejected Ford's arguments that the economic loss rule bars the Plaintiff's claim. The Plaintiff is allowed to proceed with the Complaint, and Ford is required to file an answer within 20 days.
