And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Plaintiff, Selim Hoxha, filed a complaint alleging FEHA disability discrimination, FEHA failure to accommodate, and other claims against the Defendant, The Regents of the University of California. The Defendant demurred to the Plaintiff's harassment claim, arguing that the allegations do not state sufficient facts. The Court has reviewed the allegations and determined that the Plaintiff has not shown a concerted pattern of harassment, but rather a series of isolated incidents that do not rise to the level of harassment under the FEHA. The Court has sustained the demurrer to the Plaintiff's harassment claim and will not allow the Plaintiff to amend the complaint to cure the defects. The Defendant is ordered to file an answer within 20 days.
