And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the Motion to Compel in part, requiring Bit Mining International, LLC (BMI) to comply with a business record subpoena. The subpoena seeks financial documents related to asset transfers among BMI and the Defendants. The Court finds that the testimony of Michel Amar, a Defendant, is unclear and that there is an interrelationship between BMI and the Defendants. The Court also notes that corporations have a lesser privacy interest in financial documents. The Court will require a production of documents from December 1, 2017, until May 1, 2020. The Court declines to award sanctions.
