And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling is in regards to a lemon law matter between Plaintiffs Angel Ismael Juarez and Miguel Juarez, and Defendants Nissan North America, Inc. and Wish Automotive, Inc. The Plaintiffs have settled the matter and are seeking attorney's fees and costs. The Defendants argue that the fees should not be awarded because Nissan made a reasonable repurchase offer before the lawsuit was filed, that there are excessive billing entries, and that counsel's hourly rates are excessive. The Court disagrees with the Defendants' first argument, stating that the initial offer did not encompass all available relief, and that pursuing litigation was not unreasonable. The Court also agrees that counsel's rates are excessive and reduces the hourly rates for Michael Saeedian and Christopher Urner. The Court awards the Plaintiffs $24,932.75 in fees and $1,329.33 in costs.
