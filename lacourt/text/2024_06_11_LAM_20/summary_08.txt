And here is the English-text summary:

Judge's Tentative Ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for summary adjudication filed by Randall Kaplan and Madison Kaplan. The ruling grants the motion and finds that certain statements made by Kaplan and others are protected by the fair report privilege. The judge also denies Gimelstob's request for reconsideration of the ruling and his request for relief under Code Civ. Proc. § 473(b) for excusable neglect. The judge finds that Gimelstob failed to establish that he was without counsel at the time of the MSA hearing and that he did not adequately explain why he could not have presented certain evidence at the hearing. The judge also denies Gimelstob's request to file a fifth amended cross-complaint. The parties are strongly urged to consider settlement discussions or private mediation.
