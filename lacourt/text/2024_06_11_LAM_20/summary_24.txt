Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the judgment creditor's motion to foreclose on Nejat Kohan's interest in Palm Plaza Family LP. The judge rejects Kohan's contentions, including his argument that the interest should be sold in Ventura County, that the writ of execution lacks specific description of property, and that an appraisal should be ordered. The judge finds that the writ of execution complies with the requirements of the California Code of Civil Procedure and Corporations Code. The judge also finds that Kohan's contention that he was improperly served with the motion lacks merit and that Kohan's interest in the partnership is subject to a lien by Sid Kohan. The judge orders the judgment creditor to give notice.
