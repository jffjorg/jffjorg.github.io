               [1]The
parties refer to Plaintiffs signing such agreements with Quest when they were
employed by it and later Simply Good after Simply Good acquired Quest in 2019.  Plaintiffs attach to each of their
declarations submitted in support of this motion a document entitled “Confidentiality
and Proprietary Rights Agreement” as Exhibit A (purportedly related to their
agreement with Simply Food) and “Confidentiality and Invention Assignment Agreement”
(purportedly related to an agreement with Quest).  However, as Defendants point out, Plaintiffs
solely address the agreement with Simply Food; thus, the agreement with Quest does
not appear to be the subject of their motion.

Injunction, p. 7.)
