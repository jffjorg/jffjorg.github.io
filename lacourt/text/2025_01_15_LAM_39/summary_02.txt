And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion for a preliminary injunction filed by the plaintiffs. The parties have referred to agreements signed by the plaintiffs with Quest and Simply Good, a company that acquired Quest in 2019. The plaintiffs have attached documents titled "Confidentiality and Proprietary Rights Agreement" and "Confidentiality and Invention Assignment Agreement" to their declarations. However, the defendants point out that the plaintiffs only address the agreement with Simply Good and do not mention the agreement with Quest. The judge notes that the agreement with Quest does not appear to be the subject of the motion.
