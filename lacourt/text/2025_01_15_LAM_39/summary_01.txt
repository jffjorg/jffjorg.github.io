Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The plaintiffs, Zachary Kazarian, Kyle Kazarian, and Jake Jessa, move for a preliminary injunction to prevent the defendants, Simply Good Foods, Inc. and Quest Nutrition LLC, from enforcing post-employment invention assignment agreements that the plaintiffs claim are unenforceable. The agreements allegedly restrict the plaintiffs from working in the same industry as the defendants. The judge finds that the plaintiffs have demonstrated a likelihood of prevailing on the merits and that harm is likely if the injunction is not granted. The judge grants the preliminary injunction and sets an order to show cause regarding the amount of the undertaking, which must cover any damages the defendants may sustain by reason of the injunction. The parties are ordered to file briefs on the matter.
