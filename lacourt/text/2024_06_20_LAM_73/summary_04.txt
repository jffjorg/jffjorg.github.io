And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the plaintiff's motions to deem requests for admissions admitted, as well as the request for monetary sanctions against the defendants and their attorney. The truth of the matters specified in the requests for admissions is hereby deemed admitted. The judge also awards monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,750 against the defendants and their attorney, to be paid to the plaintiff's counsel within 30 days. The plaintiff is required to provide notice of the court's order and file a proof of service of such. The judge finds that the defendants' failure to respond to the requests for admissions warrants the imposition of sanctions, but reduces the amount requested due to the type of motion at issue and the fact that no opposition was filed.
