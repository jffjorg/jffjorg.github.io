Case Description: 
The case involves a dispute over invasion of privacy claims against defendant Adam Levine, who recorded telephonic meetings with plaintiffs without their consent. Plaintiffs are seeking attorney's fees and costs incurred in opposing defendant's anti-SLAPP motion.

Case Analysis: 
The court denied plaintiffs' request for attorney's fees, finding that defendant's anti-SLAPP motion was not frivolous or solely intended to cause unnecessary delay. The court noted that defendant's arguments were distinguishable from a previous case, Gerbosi v. Gaims, Weil, West & Epstein, and that defendant's motion was not entirely frivolous.

Summary of Tentative Ruling: 
Plaintiffs' request for attorney's fees is DENIED.
