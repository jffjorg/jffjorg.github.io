```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel to Defendant David Romero, Trustee of the Laguna Seca Living Trust. The motion was filed by Paul Carter, counsel for Defendants, citing a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship and a series of actions taken by the client that created an unwaivable conflict between client and counsel. However, the motion was incomplete as it lacked a proposed order. The judge noted that the court has discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw, but the motion must be granted provided that there is no prejudice to the client and it does not disrupt the orderly process of justice.
