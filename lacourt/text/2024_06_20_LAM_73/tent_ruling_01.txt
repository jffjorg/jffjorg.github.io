MOTION TO BE RELIEVED AS COUNSEL TO AS DEFENDANT
DAVID ROMERO, TRUSTEE OF THE LAGUNA SECA LIVING TRUST (filed 5/21/2024) 
 
TENTATIVE RULING 
 
The Motion to be Relieved
as Counsel as to Defendant David Romero, Trustee of the Laguna Seca Living
Trust, is DENIED.
 
I. BACKGROUND
 
On November
12, 2020, Plaintiff RJS Financial, Inc. (“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint against
Defendants Dos Potrillos LLC (“Dos Potrillos”); David A. Romero, trustee of the
Laguna Seca Living Trust; David A. Romero, an individual; and all persons known and unknown claiming
any legal or equitable right, title, estate, lien, or interest in the real
property described in the complaint adverse to the plaintiff’s title, or any
cloud on plaintiff’s title (“Defendants”).
 
The
Complaint alleges causes of action for: (1) Quiet Title and (2) Declaratory
Relief.
The Complaint alleges the
following. On or about June 2019, Plaintiff made a $2.1 million loan to
Defendant Dos Potrillos which was intended to be secured by certain properties,
including a property located at 902 Nicholson Avenue, Los Angeles, California
90744 (“Nicholson Property”). (Complaint, ¶¶ 8-9.) Dos
Potrillos executed a Promissory Note and Deed of Trust noting that the
Nicholson Property served as security for the loan. (Id., ¶¶ 9-11.) The Deed of Trust was
recorded on July 2, 2019 as Document No. 20190639198 in the Official Records of
the Los Angeles County Recorder. (Id., ¶ 11.) In July 2020, Dos Potrillos defaulted on the loan and a
Notice of Default was recorded in July 2020. (Id., ¶ 12.) Upon recording the Notice
of Default, Plaintiff learned that title to the Nicholson Property had a title
defect and record title still reflected the Nicholson Property being owned by
Defendant David A. Romero as Trustee of the Laguna Seca Trust (“Trust”) instead
of Dos Potrillos. (Id., ¶¶ 14-15.) Plaintiff alleges that due to an error,
the Deed that was signed by Romero on behalf of the Trust transferring the
Nicholson Property from the Trust to Dos Potrillos was never recorded, although
the Nicholson Property was intended by Dos Potrillos to be included as security
for the Deed of Trust. (Id., ¶ 17.)
On February
8, 2024, Defendants filed a Third Amended Cross-Complaint alleging causes of
action for:  
(1)
Declaratory Relief; 
(2)
Cancellation of Instruments; 
(3) Wrongful
Foreclosure; 
(4)
Violation of CCP
§§ 17200 et. seq.; and 
(5) Quiet
Title.
 
On
May 21, 2023, counsel for Defendants filed a Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel as
to David Romero, Trustee of the Laguna Seca Living Trust. Counsel also filed a supporting
declaration.  
 
No
opposition or other response has been filed. 
 
II.
ANALYSIS
 
A.     Legal
Standard
 
California
Rules¿of Court,¿rule 3.1362 (Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel) requires (1)
notice of motion and motion to be directed to the client (made on the Notice of
Motion and Motion to be Relieved as Counsel—Civil¿form (MC-051)); (2) a
declaration stating in general terms and without compromising the
confidentiality of the attorney-client relationship why a motion under Code of
Civil Procedure section 284(2) is brought instead of filing a consent under
Code of Civil Procedure section 284(1) (made on the Declaration in Support of
Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil¿form (MC-052)); (3) service
of the notice of motion and motion and declaration on all other parties who
have appeared in the case; and (4) the proposed order relieving counsel
(prepared on the Order Granting Attorney’s Motion to Be Relieved as
Counsel—Civil¿form (MC-053)).¿ 
 
The¿court has discretion
to allow an attorney to withdraw, and such a motion should be granted¿provided
that¿there is no prejudice to the client, and it does not disrupt the orderly
process of justice.¿¿(See¿Ramirez v.¿Sturdevant¿(1994) 21 Cal.App.4th
904, 915.)¿ 
 
B.     Discussion
Here,
Defendants’ counsel, Paul Carter, seeks relief under Code of Civil Procedure,
Section 284(2). Counsel correctly completed and filed the notice (Form MC-051)
and declaration (MC-052). (Code Civ. Proc., § 284(2); Cal. Rules Court, rule
3.1362, subds. (a) & (c).) In the declaration, counsel sufficiently
explains that this motion is being brought under Section 284(2) instead of
284(1) because the attorney client relationship has broken down and counsel states
the client has undertaken a series of actions which create an unwaivable
conflict between client and counsel. Counsel served
the notice (MC-051) and the declaration (MC-052) on Defendants.
However,
counsel has not filed a proposed order. The proposed order must be prepared on the
Order Granting Attorney’s Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil¿form (MC-053).
(Cal. Rules Court, rule 3.1362.) Since counsel
has not filed or served a proposed order with its Motion to be Relieved as
Counsel, all requirements for relief have not been satisfied.
III. DISPOSITION
 
Accordingly, the Motion
to be Relieved as Counsel to Defendant David Romero, Trustee of the Laguna Seca
Living Trust, is DENIED.
