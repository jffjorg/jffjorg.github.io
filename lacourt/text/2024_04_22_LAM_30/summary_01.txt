And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the Defendant's demurrer to the fifth cause of action in the Plaintiffs' Second Amended Complaint (SAC) is sustained, but with 10 days' leave to amend. The Court finds that the SAC fails to state a cause of action for Violation of Civil Code Section 1942.4 because the allegations are conclusory and lack specific facts. The Plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate a good cause for any alleged delay in making required repairs. The Court construes the SAC liberally and gives it a reasonable interpretation, but the allegations are insufficient to state a cause of action. The Defendant has failed to provide any substantive argument as to how the SAC is uncertain.
