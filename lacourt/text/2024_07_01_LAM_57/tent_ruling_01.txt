  Case Number:  23STCV19817    Hearing Date:   July 1, 2024    Dept:  57 1200
Management LLC (“Plaintiff”) brought this action against Defendant Alan Bunao (“Defendant”)
for recovery of COVID-19 rental debt. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1179.02.)  Pending before the Court are four discovery
motions that Plaintiff filed.  The Court’s
disposition of the motions is set forth below. 
The bottom line is that the Court is granting all of the motions. 
 
A.  Motion to Compel Compliance Regarding Production of Documents
 
On February
12, 2024, Plaintiff served its First Set of Requests for Production of
Documents (“RFPs”) consisting of 23 document requests on Defendant. (RFP McConnell
Decl., ¶ 2, Ex. A.)  On March 28, 2024, Defendant
served his verified responses to the RFPs.  (Id., ¶ 3, Ex. B.)  In all 23 of his responses, Defendant stated
as follows: “After reasonable inquiry and diligent search, the Responding Party
will produce all responsive, non-privilged documents in their possession,
custody, or control.” (Ibid.)  Also in
his responses, Defendant referred to Exhibits 101 to 113 but produced only
Exhibit 103. (Ibid.)  On April 18, 2024,
Plaintiff’s counsel emailed Defendant’s counsel a meet and confer letter. (Id.,
¶ 4, Ex. C.)  At the time of filing the motion,
Plaintiff’s counsel represents that Defendant’s counsel had neither responded
to his letter nor produced additional documents. (Ibid.) 
 
In
Opposition, Defendant argues that his responses are sufficient and that he has
produced responsive documents.  As to Defendant’s
first point, the Court notes that his responses are agreements to comply with
the RFPs, not a representation of an inability to comply as Defendant asserts
in his Opposition. As to Defendant’s second point, the Court agrees with
Plaintiff’s counsel that Defendant served verified supplemental responses on
June 20, 2024 after having filed his Opposition. (RFP Supp. McConnell Decl., ¶
2, Ex. A.)  The Court further agrees that
Defendant’s supplemental responses to RFP Nos. 7, 10-18 and 21 not only fail to
comply with his own agreement to produce but also do not constitute valid
responses on their own. \Plaintiff’s counsel also represents in Reply that Defendant’s
supplemental production only included Exhibits 101 to 104. (Id., ¶ 3.) 
 
On a motion
to compel compliance, there is no time limit and all that needs to be shown is
the responding party’s failure to comply as agreed. (Weil & Brown, Cal.
Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter Group, 2023) ¶
8:1508.1.) 
 
Finding that
Defendant has failed to produce documents including Exhibits 105-113, as
agreed, the Court grants Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel and orders Defendant to
serve Plaintiff the documents responsive to RFP Nos. 7, 10-18 and 21 by July
15, 2024.
 
 
B.  Motion to Compel Further Responses to Requests for Admissions 
 
On February 12, 2024, Plaintiff served Requests for Admission, Set One,
on Defendant (“RFAs”). (RFA McConnell Decl., ¶ 2.) Defendant served verified
responses to the RFAs on the agreed-upon deadline of March 29, 2024. (Id., ¶ 3,
Ex. B.)  At issue is Defendant’s response
to RFA No. 2, for which Plaintiff sought a supplemental response via Counsel’s
meet and confer letter on April 18, 2024. (Id., ¶ 4, Ex. C.) Counsel represents
that “Defendant refused to meet and confer in good faith,” prompting this [Motion].  (Ibid.) 
 
Code of
Civil Procedure section 2033.220 sets forth the requirements for responding to
RFAs: 
 
(a)  Each answer in a response to requests for admission shall be as complete
and straightforward as the information reasonably available to the responding
party permits.
(b)  Each answer shall:
(1) Admit so much of the matter involved in the request as is true, either
as expressed in the request itself or as reasonably and clearly qualified by
the responding party.
(2) Deny so much of the matter involved in the request as is untrue.
(3) Specify so much of the matter involved in the request as to the truth of
which the responding party lacks sufficient information or knowledge.
(c)  
If a responding party gives lack of information or
knowledge as a reason for a failure to admit all or part of a request for
admission, that party shall state in the answer that a reasonable inquiry
concerning the matter in the particular request has been made, and that the
information known or readily obtainable is insufficient to enable that party to
admit the matter.
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.220(a)-(c).) 
 
Here, RFA No. 2 asks Defendant to “Admit that the SB TOWER Twelve Month
Rental Agreement attached hereto as Exhibit ‘A’ is a genuine copy of the LEASE.”
(RFA McConnell Decl., ¶ 2, Ex. A.) In response, Defendant did not object but
stated in relevant part, “Defendant received a lease that appears to be similar
to the lease attached to Plaintiff’s complain.” (Id., ¶ 3, Ex. B.) Defendant’s “response
that the lease he received when he rented the subject property ‘appears to be
similar’ to the lease attached to the RFAs is evasive and does not clearly
admit or deny the RFA.” (RFA Separate Statement, p. 2.)  The Court agrees. 
 
In Opposition, Defendant claims for the first time that he “has
conducted a reasonable inquiry and the information is not known or readily
obtainable.” (RFA Opposition, p. 3.)  Defendant’s
response did not, however, indicate “lack of information or knowledge as a
reason for a failure to admit all or part of a request for admission” to
trigger such claim. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.220(c).) The Court thus
rejects Defendant’s argument made in Opposition that his “response is
substantive in nature.” (RFA Opposition, p. 3.) 
 
The Court further notes that as with the RFPs, Defendant served verified
supplemental response to the subject RFA after having filed his Opposition.
(RFA Supp. McConnell Decl., ¶ 2, Ex. A.) Defendant’s supplemental response,
too, is deficient. It states as follows: 
 
There is a reason to believe another lease does not include [Defendant’s
former wife] Jackie Bunao. The lease in question dates back to 2013, with
several rent increases until 2021. Following the divorce in 2017, a verbal request
was made for Jackie Bunao’s removal from the lease. Jackie relinquished all
interest in the company as part of the divorce agreement. This information was
provided to the management team via email. Please see Exhibit 106[.] 
 
(Ibid.) This supplemental response still fails to admit or deny the
genuineness of the lease and does not state an inability to admit or deny due
to lack of information or knowledge. 
 
Finding that Defendant’s original and supplemental responses do not
comply with section 2033.220, the Court grants Plaintiff’s motion as to RFA No.
2 and orders Defendant to serve a Code-compliant further response by July 15,
2024. 
 
C.  Motions to Compel Further Responses to Special and Form Interrogatories 
 
If a timely motion to compel a further response to
an interrogatory has been filed, the burden is on the responding party to
justify any objection or failure fully to answer the interrogatories. (Fairmont
Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (2000) 22 Cal.4th 245, 255.)¿¿  Here, Plaintiff timely filed its motions to compel further responses to
special and form interrogatories.  The
issue is whether Defendant satisfied his burden to justify his responses. In
his Oppositions, Defendant argues that his original responses are substantive.   The Court notes that Defendant has since served supplemental interrogatory
responses, leaving Special Interrogatories 5, 6, 9, 11, 12, 20, and 22 and Form
Interrogatories 2.6, 2.7, 2.12, 12.1, 12.3, 15.1, 17.1, 50.1, and 50.2 at issue.
(SROG Supp. McConnell Decl., ¶ 2; FROG Supp. McConnell Decl., ¶ 3.) 
 
Defendant’s supplemental responses remain deficient because they fail to
answer subparts of an interrogatory, improperly refer to other documents, and are
evasive or incomplete. Defendant has also failed to supplement his response to
Form Interrogatory 15.1. Finding that Defendant failed to justify his failure
to fully answer the interrogatories that remain at issue, the Court grants
Plaintiff’s motions to compel further responses to Special Interrogatories 5,
6, 9, 11, 12, 20, and 22, and Form Interrogatories 2.6, 2.7, 2.12, 12.1, 12.3, 15.1,
17.1, 50.1, and 50.2. Defendant is ordered to serve Code-compliant further
responses to these interrogatories by July 15, 2024.
 
 
D.  Sanctions
 
Plaintiff seeks sanctions against Defendant and his
counsel in the form of attorney’s fees and costs incurred in connection with
the motions.   The Court finds that the
hourly billing rate of Plaintiff’s counsel of $355 per hour is reasonable and
that the hours counsel spent on the motions are reasonable.  The filing fee for each of the four motions was
$60.  Based on a review of the material
that Plaintiff’s counsel submitted in connection with the motions, the Court is
imposing sanctions against Defendant and his counsel as follows:
 
RFP Motion -- $ 1,900.
 
RFA Motion -- 
$ 1,700
 
SROG Motion 
--  $2,100
 
FROG Motion 
--   $2,100
 
The total amount of the sanctions is $6,800.  That amount must be paid to the Plaintiff by August
19, 2024.
