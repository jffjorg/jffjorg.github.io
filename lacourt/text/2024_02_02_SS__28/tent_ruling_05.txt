DISCUSSION: 
Petitioner
has complied with all requirements for approval. 
Counsel
has requested an attorney’s fee award of $2,000.00 ($1,000.00 for each minor),
which is 33.33 percent of the $6,000.00 gross settlement amount.  Counsel notes that Petitioner approved the
retainer agreement that supports this request. 
California
Rules of Court, rule 7.955, “requires a trial court, in determining reasonable
attorney fees, to balance an attorney's interest in fair compensation with the
protection of the interests of a minor client. Thus, a trial court ‘must give
consideration to the terms of any representation agreement made between the
attorney and the representative of the minor or person with a disability and
must evaluate the agreement based on the facts and circumstances existing at
the time the agreement was made.’ ” (Schulz v. Jeppesen Sanderson, Inc.
(2018) 27 Cal.App.5th 1167, 1176-1177 (Schultz), quoting Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 7.955(a)(2).) 
The
Court has considered the factors listed in rule 7.955 and concludes that an
attorney’s fee award of 30 percent is reasonable in this case.  (See Schultz, supra, 27 Cal.App.5th at
p. 1175 [“Even if there is no benchmark starting point for attorney fees in
cases under California Rules of Court, rule 7.955, a court may of course
reasonably determine that 25 percent is an appropriate percentage in a given case”].) 
Therefore,
the total attorney’s fee award will be $1,800.00 ($900.00 for each minor),
which is 30 percent of the gross settlement amount.  The net settlement amount for each Claimant
is $2,100.00. 
Petitioner
requests that the amounts be paid to Roselyn Boardley at 6302 Fairfax Avenue, Los
Angeles, CA 90056. The Court orders that the net settlement amounts are to be so
distributed.
