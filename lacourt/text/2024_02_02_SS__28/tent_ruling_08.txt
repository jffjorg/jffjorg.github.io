Company (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Defendants Keveta Redd
(“Defendant”) and Does 1-20 for auto negligence – subrogation.  The complaint sought $26,772.78 in damages. 
On

service of the summons, complaint, and other documents on Defendant on May 22,
2023. 
On
September 21, 2023, the clerk entered Defendant’s default. 
On

On December
15, 2023, the Court dismissed the Doe defendants without prejudice at Plaintiff’s
request. 
PARTY’S REQUEST 
Plaintiff
California Automobile Insurance Company asks the Court to enter a default
judgment against Defendant Keveta Redd and award Plaintiff $27,313.07,
consisting of $26,772.78 as the demand of the complaint and $540.29 in costs. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
A.   Default judgment 
“[With exceptions that do not apply here,] [a] party
seeking a default judgment on declarations must use mandatory Request for Entry
of Default (Application to Enter Default) (form CIV-100) . . . The following
must be included in the documents filed with the clerk: 
“(1)  Except in
unlawful detainer cases, a brief summary of the case identifying the parties and
the nature of plaintiff's claim; 
“(2) 
Declarations or other admissible evidence in support of the judgment
requested; 
“(3)  Interest
computations as necessary; 
“(4)  A
memorandum of costs and disbursements; 
“(5)  A
declaration of nonmilitary status for each defendant against whom judgment is
sought; 
“(6)  A proposed
form of judgment; 
“(7)  A dismissal
of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application for
separate judgment against specified parties under Code of Civil Procedure section
579, supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment; 
“(8)  Exhibits
as necessary; and 
“(9)  A request
for attorney fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.” 
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1800(a).) 
B.   Damages 
          “Where a cause of action is stated in the complaint,
plaintiff merely needs to introduce evidence establishing a prima facie case
for damages.”  (L. Edmon & C. Karnow,
Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (Rutter 2023) ¶ 5:213.1, p. 5-56 (Cal. Practice Guide), citing Johnson
v. Stanhiser (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 357, 361 [trial court erred in applying
preponderance of the evidence standard].) 
          The relief granted to a plaintiff upon entry of a
defendant's default cannot exceed the amount demanded in the complaint or, for
personal injury cases where damages may not be stated in the complaint, the
amount listed in the statement of damages. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 580, subd. (a),
585, subd. (b).) “The notice requirement of section 580 was designed to insure
fundamental fairness.” (Becker v. S.P.V. Construction Co. (1980) 27
Cal.3d 489, 494 (Becker).) The statute insures that “defendants in cases
which involve a default judgment have adequate notice of the judgments that may
be taken against them. [Citation.] ‘If a judgment other than that which is
demanded is taken against him, [the defendant] has been deprived of his day in
court—a right to a hearing on the matter adjudicated.’ ’’ (Id. at p.
493.) A trial court exceeds its jurisdiction if it awards damages in excess of
the amount specified in the complaint or statement of damages. (Id. at
p. 494; see Cal. Practice Guide, supra, ¶ 5:258,
p. 5-70.) 
DISCUSSION 
An application for default judgment under Code of
Civil Procedure sections 585, subdivisions (a), (b), or (c), or section 586, “shall
include an affidavit stating that a copy of the application has been mailed to
the defendant’s attorney of record or, if none, to the defendant at his or her last
known address and the date on which the copy was mailed.  If no such address of the defendant is known
to the plaintiff or the plaintiff’s attorney, the affidavit shall state that fact.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 587; see Bae v. T.D.
Service Co. of Arizona (2016) 245 Cal.App.4th 89, 108, fn. 15 (Bae) ["appellate
courts and treatises have interpreted the phrase ‘application ... for entry of
default’ in Code of Civil Procedure section 587 to include applications for
entry of a default judgment”].) 
Consistent with Code of Civil Procedure section 587, “a
party applying for a default judgment is required to use a form document that
includes a declaration that the completed form has been mailed to the defendant’s
counsel of record [or defendant if he or she does not have counsel].” (Bae,
supra, 245 Cal.App.4th at p. 106, citing Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1800(a); Judicial Council Form No. CIV-100; 6 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (5th ed.
2008) Proceedings Without Trial, § 164, p. 605.) 
          In Bae,
the Court of Appeal rejected the appellant’s argument that it was not obligated
to comply with Code of Civil Procedure section 587 in seeking a default
judgment.  Interpreting the statutory
language, the appellate court conclude that the affidavit requirement was “mandatory”
but not “jurisdictional,” meaning that failure to comply with the requirement
does not support setting aside a default or default judgment “absent a suitable
showing of prejudice.”  (Bae, supra,
245 Cal.App.4th at p. 107.)  The court
found the respondent had established prejudice because it was unaware of the default
proceedings and believed no default judgment could be entered against it based
on its declaration of nonmonetary status. 
(Ibid.; see Cal. Practice Guide, supra, ¶ 5:187, p.
5-50 [“Failure to provide this notice may entitle defendant to set aside the
default judgment”].) 
          Based
on these authorities, the Court concludes that Plaintiff was required to submit an affidavit stating that a copy of the application for default
judgment had been mailed to Defendant. 
Plaintiff included such an affidavit in its September 21, 2023
application for default but omitted the affidavit from its December 13, 2023 application
for default judgment. 
          The Court denies the application for default judgment
without prejudice. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court DENIES Plaintiff California Automobile Insurance Company’s application
for default judgment filed on December 13, 2023 without prejudice. 
Plaintiff
is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
