 Case Number:  22STCV13691    Hearing Date:   February 2, 2024    Dept:  28 Having
considered the moving papers, the Court rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On
April 25, 2022, Plaintiff Tatianna Faith Dunmore (“Plaintiff”) filed this
action against Defendants Mark Edward Switzer (“Defendant”) and Does 1-50 for
negligence. 
On
January 3, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel, Tae Kim and Wilshire Law Firm, PLC, filed
a motion to be relieved as counsel to be heard on February 2, 2024. 
 No trial date is currently scheduled. 
COUNSEL’S REQUEST 
 Plaintiff’s counsel, Tae Kim
and Wilshire Law Firm, PLC, request to be relieved as counsel. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, provides: 
“(a) Notice 
“A notice of motion and motion to be relieved as
counsel under Code of Civil Procedure section 284(2) must be directed to the client
and must be made on the Notice of Motion and Motion to Be Relieved as
Counsel-Civil (form MC-051). 
“(b) Memorandum 
“Notwithstanding any other rule of court, no
memorandum is required to be filed or served with a motion to be relieved as counsel. 
“(c) Declaration 
“The motion to be relieved as counsel must be accompanied
by a declaration on the Declaration in Support of Attorney's Motion to Be
Relieved as Counsel-Civil (form MC-052). The declaration must state in general
terms and without compromising the confidentiality of the attorney-client
relationship why a motion under Code of Civil Procedure section 284(2) is
brought instead of filing a consent under Code of Civil Procedure section
284(1). 
“(d) Service 
“The notice of motion and motion, the declaration, and
the proposed order must be served on the client and on all other parties who
have appeared in the case. The notice may be by personal service, electronic
service, or mail. 
“(1)  If the
notice is served on the client by mail under Code of Civil Procedure section
1013, it must be accompanied by a declaration stating facts showing that either: 
“(A)   The
service address is the current residence or business address of the client; or 
“(B)   The
service address is the last known residence or business address of the client
and the attorney has been unable to locate a more current address after making
reasonable efforts to do so within 30 days before the filing of the motion to
be relieved. 
“(2)  If the notice
is served on the client by electronic service under Code of Civil Procedure
section 1010.6 and rule 2.251, it must be accompanied by a declaration stating
that the electronic service address is the client's current electronic service
address. 
“As used in this rule, ‘current’ means that the address
was confirmed within 30 days before the filing of the motion to be relieved.
Merely demonstrating that the notice was sent to the client's last known
address and was not returned or no electronic delivery failure message was
received is not, by itself, sufficient to demonstrate that the address is current.
If the service is by mail, Code of Civil Procedure section 1011(b) applies. 
“(e) Order 
“The proposed order relieving counsel must be prepared
on the Order Granting Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel-Civil (form
MC-053) and must be lodged with the court with the moving papers. The order
must specify all hearing dates scheduled in the action or proceeding, including
the date of trial, if known. If no hearing date is presently scheduled, the
court may set one and specify the date in the order. After the order is signed,
a copy of the signed order must be served on the client and on all parties that
have appeared in the case. The court may delay the effective date of the order
relieving counsel until proof of service of a copy of the signed order on the
client has been filed with the court.” 
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362.)
