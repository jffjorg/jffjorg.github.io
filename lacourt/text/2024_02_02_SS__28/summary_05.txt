Summary in English:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge regarding an expedited petition for approval of a settlement agreement. The petition was filed by Roselyn Boardley, the mother of Bailey and Benjamin Boardley, who were rear-ended by unnamed defendants while riding as passengers in her vehicle. The settlement amount is $3,000 per claimant, and the attorney's fee award is 30% of the gross settlement amount, which is $1,800. The judge concludes that this fee award is reasonable and orders that the net settlement amounts be distributed to Roselyn Boardley.
