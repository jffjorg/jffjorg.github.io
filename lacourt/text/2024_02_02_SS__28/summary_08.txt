And here is the English text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the application for default judgment filed by Plaintiff California Automobile Insurance Company is denied without prejudice. The Judge found that Plaintiff failed to comply with the mandatory requirements for an application for default judgment, specifically the requirement to submit an affidavit stating that a copy of the application had been mailed to the Defendant. The Judge notes that the Plaintiff included such an affidavit in its initial application for default judgment, but omitted it from its subsequent application. The Judge concludes that the Plaintiff was required to submit the affidavit and denies the application for default judgment without prejudice.
