And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer to the complaint filed by Plaintiff MICHAEL L. MAGASINN, as Trustee of SHAMSAM IRREVOCABLE TRUST. The demurrer was filed by Moving Defendant WINHALL 5, LLC, who argues that the 2006 deeds of trust recorded by East West Bank have priority over Plaintiff's judgment lien obtained in August 2022.

The court agrees with Moving Defendant's argument, finding that California follows a "first in time, first in right" system of lien priorities. Therefore, the East West Bank deeds of trust, recorded in 2006, have priority over Plaintiff's judgment lien, which was recorded in August 2022.

The court also sustains the demurrer with 20 days' leave to amend, allowing Plaintiff to re-allege the claims and potentially alleging that Moving Defendant intends to proceed with the foreclosure sale in an inequitable fashion.
