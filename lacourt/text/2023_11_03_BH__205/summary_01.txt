And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge Edward B. Moreton, Jr. regarding a motion filed by Defendant Niloofar Maashfegh Geller (Mrs. Geller) for release and redelivery of seized property, damages, and attorneys' fees and costs. The case arises from a dispute among shareholders of a closely held corporation called Wholesale Direct Metals (WDM), which sells precious metals to the public.

The dispute began when Plaintiff Edwin Solorzano, a minority shareholder and director of WDM, filed a complaint against Mrs. Geller and others alleging they embezzled at least $9.65 million from WDM. The arbitrator ruled in favor of Mrs. Geller on all claims asserted against her, and the court confirmed the arbitration award.

In this motion, Mrs. Geller seeks to recover the release and redelivery of the seized property, damages, and attorneys' fees and costs incurred in connection with the motion and the prior motion to quash the writ of possession. The court concludes that Mrs. Geller is entitled to the release and redelivery of the seized property, but denies her request for damages.

The court also awards Mrs. Geller attorneys' fees and costs in the amount of $28,602.56, which includes the fees for her counsel's work on the motion and the prior motion to quash the writ of possession. The court uses the lodestar method to determine the reasonable hourly rate and hours expended by Mrs. Geller's counsel, and concludes that the hourly rate of $560 is reasonable and that 50 hours of work were reasonably expended on the motion and the prior motion to quash the writ of possession.
