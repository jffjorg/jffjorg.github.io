And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying without prejudice the defendant's motion to compel the plaintiff's further responses to form interrogatories. The defendant had failed to file a joint statement, which is required by the court's rules, and also failed to schedule an Informal Discovery Conference (IDC) to resolve the discovery disputes. The court's rules require such a conference before filing a discovery motion. The plaintiff had not responded to the discovery requests, which were part of the defendant's motion. The judge's ruling is subject to change after the parties have had an opportunity to review and respond to the tentative ruling.
