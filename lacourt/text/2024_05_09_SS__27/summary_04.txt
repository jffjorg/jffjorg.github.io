And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English:

The court has granted the defendant's motion to reopen discovery, allowing for further discovery, including depositions and a neuropsychological examination. The plaintiff opposed reopening of fact discovery, but not expert discovery. The court found that the defendant's request was reasonable, given the age of the case and the minimal prejudice that would result from reopening discovery. The court also considered the diligence of the parties and the likelihood that reopening discovery would prevent the case from going to trial on the current date. The court ordered that all trial-related deadlines would be reset to follow the current trial date of July 29, 2024.
