The judge has granted the motion for leave to amend the complaint to correct a mistake in the date of the incident. The plaintiff, MARIA ANGELICA AMARAL, et al., filed the complaint on June 13, 2022, but the correct date of the incident is July 6, 2020, not November 11, 2022 as stated in the complaint. The plaintiff has complied with the requirements of Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1324, including including a copy of the proposed amendment and specifying the effect of the amendment. As no opposition was filed and prejudice does not seem likely, the court has granted the motion. The parties are advised to submit to the tentative ruling by email or appear remotely or in person for oral argument on May 9, 2024.
