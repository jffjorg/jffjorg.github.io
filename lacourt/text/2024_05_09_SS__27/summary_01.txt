And here is the English-text summary:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for summary judgment and summary adjudication. The plaintiff, Annmarie Quizon, filed a trip and fall complaint against Forever 21 Inc. and 1431 Promenade LLC, alleging causes of action for negligence and premises liability. The defendant, Forever 21 Inc., moves for summary judgment and summary adjudication, arguing that it was responsible for the design, installation, and maintenance of the stairs at the Forever 21 store where the accident occurred. The court finds that the defendant has met its initial burden in showing that Forever 21 Inc. was responsible for the use and maintenance of the property, and that the plaintiff failed to present evidence that raises a triable issue of fact regarding the premises liability cause of action. Therefore, the court grants summary adjudication as to the premises liability cause of action. However, the court denies summary adjudication as to the negligence cause of action, as the defendant failed to meet its initial burden in showing that the plaintiff's allegations of negligence are without merit.
