And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The court grants the defendant's motion to reopen discovery and continue the trial. The defendant moves to continue the trial and reopen discovery because the plaintiff is alleging brain damage and cognitive difficulties, and the defendant was not aware of these issues until recently. The court finds that the defendant was not tardy in seeking to reopen discovery and continue the trial. The court sets a new trial date for September ____, 2024.

The court also grants the defendant's motion to compel deposition, ordering the defendant to produce certain documents and to allow the plaintiff to depose the person most knowledgeable about the documents.

The court will hear argument on the issue of sanctions. The parties are required to submit on this tentative ruling by email or appear remotely or in person for oral argument.
