Legal Standard
A plaintiff may make a demand for
production of documents and propound interrogatories without leave of court at
any time 10 days after the service of the summons on, or appearance by, the
party to whom the demand is directed, whichever occurs first. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2031.020, subd. (b); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.020, subd. (b).) The demand for
production of documents is not limited by number, but the request must comply
with the formatting requirements in Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.030. A party
may propound 35 specially prepared interrogatories that are relevant to the
subject matter of the pending action and any additional number of official form
interrogatories that are relevant to the subject matter of the pending action.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.030, subd. (a)(1) - (a)(2).)
 
The party whom the request is
propounded upon is required to respond within 30 days after service of a
demand, but the parties are allowed to informally agree to an extension and
confirm any such agreement in writing. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260, subd. (a);
Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.270, subd. (a)
- (b); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.270, subd. (a) - (b).)
 
If a party fails to timely respond
to a request for production or interrogatories, the party to whom the request
is directed waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings under
Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.230, and waives any objection, including one based on
privilege or on the protection for work product. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300,
subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).)¿¿The party propounding the
discovery requests may move for an order compelling responses. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (b); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (b).) Unlike a motion to compel further discovery responses, a
motion to compel initial discovery responses does not have any meet and confer
requirements.
 
Code of Civil Procedure section
2023.030, subdivision (a) provides, in pertinent part, that the court may
impose a monetary sanction on a party engaging in the misuse of the discovery
process to pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by
anyone as a result of that conduct. A misuse of the discovery process includes
failing to respond or submit to an authorized method of discovery. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (d).)¿¿¿A court has discretion to fix the amount of reasonable
monetary sanctions. (Cornerstone Realty Advisors, LLC v. Summit Healthcare
Reit, Inc. (2020) 56 Cal.App.5th 771, 791.)
 
Analysis and
Conclusion
On May 11,
2022, Plaintiff filed the present case. On November 21, 2023, Defendant Allen
Building LLC served its Form Interrogatories, set one and special
interrogatories, set one on Plaintiff. Plaintiff’s responses were due on
December 23, 2023. Defendant granted Plaintiff several extensions, but as of
March 22, 2024, no responses have been served. Defendant now moves the Court to
compel initial responses to its Form interrogatories and Special Interrogatories,
Sets One.
Plaintiff
filed an opposition only to Defendant’s motion to deem RFAs admitted, scheduled
for a hearing on May 13, 2023. Plaintiff did not file an opposition to
Defendant’s motion to compel FROG and SROG. In its reply to the opposition,
Defendant stated that Plaintiff did not serve responses to the interrogatories.
 
Thus,
Defendant’s motions to compel are granted. Plaintiff is ordered to provide
complete responses to Defendant’s Form Interrogatories, Set One, and Special
Interrogatories, Set One, within 20 days of today without objections. 
Defendant
also requests sanctions in the amount of $1,660 for the two motions. The Court
finds that Plaintiff’s non-response forced Defendant to incur attorney’s fees
by filing the present and finds the amount of sanctions requested reasonable
for two motions, but the Court reduces the amount because no opposition was
filed. And, thus, no Reply was filed.  Consequently, Plaintiff and her counsel are
ORDERED, jointly and severally, to pay sanctions of $1000.00 to Defendant within
20 days of today’s date.
