English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is a denial of the Plaintiff's motion to join Barbara J Youngman as a necessary party to the case. The Plaintiff alleges that Barbara J Youngman, a partner and shareholder of Youngman Reitshtein, PLC, is liable for Ron Reitshtein's acts and omissions in the underlying civil and family law cases. The Judge finds that the Plaintiff has not demonstrated grounds to join Barbara J Youngman as a necessary party to the case. The Judge also notes that the Plaintiff failed to provide evidence to support its assertions and that the Code of Civil Procedure section 379 does not authorize the Court to join Barbara J Youngman as a party to the case. The Judge also finds that the Plaintiff's reliance on California State Bar Rule 3.158 is misplaced.
