And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in plain English:

The Judge has ruled on the demurrer filed by the Defendants, which challenges the legal sufficiency of the complaint filed by the Plaintiffs. The Judge has sustained the demurrer and denied leave to amend the complaint. The Judge has also ruled that the motion to strike certain portions of the prayer for damages is improper and moot.

The dispute arose from a real estate transaction in which the Plaintiffs, Michael Caballero and Eunice Angelica Ibarra, bought a property from the Defendants, Jenny Dang, Tam Pham, and US Land Realty, Inc. The Plaintiffs filed a complaint against the Defendants for failure to disclose certain information during the transaction. The Defendants filed a cross-complaint against the Plaintiffs for breach of contract and negligence.

The Judge has ruled that the Plaintiffs failed to amend the cross-complaint as agreed during the meet and confer process, and therefore, the demurrer is sustained on all grounds. The Judge has also denied leave to amend the complaint. The motion to strike certain portions of the prayer for damages is improper and moot.

The case is set for hearing on August 20, 2024. The parties must submit on the tentative by sending an email to the court indicating their intention to submit on the tentative. If the parties do not submit on the tentative, they must arrange to appear remotely.
