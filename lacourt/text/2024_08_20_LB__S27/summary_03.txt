And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by Cross-Defendants (Matt Knabe, Brianna Knabe, and Bixby Hill Community Association) to the cross-complaint filed by Autrey against the Oftadehs (Dr. Golamali Oftadeh and Dr. Lydia Oftadeh). The cross-complaint alleges trespass, harassment, invasion of privacy, private nuisance, IIED, trespass to chattels, conversion, and declaratory relief.

The Judge has overruled the demurrer, finding that the Oftadehs have failed to show prejudice at the pleading stage. The Judge notes that the issue of whether Autrey's cross-complaint arises out of the same transactions, events, and/or occurrences as the complaint and/or the Knabes' cross-complaint is not apparent from the face of the cross-complaint, and can only be determined at the evidence stage of the proceedings.

As a result, the Oftadehs are ordered to file an answer to the cross-complaint within ten days. The parties who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the court indicating their intention to submit.
