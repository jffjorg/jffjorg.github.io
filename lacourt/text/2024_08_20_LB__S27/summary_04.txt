And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to strike certain claims and allegations in the plaintiffs' complaint. The plaintiffs, Eric and Carly Chevalier, are suing the defendants, Bowl Choi, Inc., Golden Bowl Charbroiled Teriyaki, David Yashar, and Pibson Partners, LLC, for private nuisance, aiding and abetting private nuisance, trespass to land, and negligence.

The defendants have moved to strike the plaintiffs' prayer for punitive damages, arguing that there are no facts pled with specificity that show fraud, malice, or oppression. The judge has granted the motion to strike and denied the plaintiffs' request for leave to amend.

The defendants have also moved to strike all references to aiding and abetting, as this claim is not recognized in California civil law. The plaintiffs have not opposed this motion, and the references are stricken without leave to amend.

Additionally, the defendants have moved to strike the plaintiffs' prayer for damages under Civil Code ยง3334, which provides a remedy for damages for wrongful "occupation of real property." The plaintiffs have not addressed this motion, and it is granted without leave to amend.

The judge has ordered the defendants to file an answer to the complaint, with the stricken allegations and prayer, within ten days. The parties are also reminded of an upcoming Case Management Conference, which will be held concurrently with the hearing on the motion to strike.
