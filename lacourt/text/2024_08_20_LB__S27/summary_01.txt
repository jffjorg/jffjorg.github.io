And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling regarding the motion to enforce the settlement agreement between Plaintiff Nena Maynez and Defendant Cristina Cruz-Madrid. The parties entered into a settlement agreement, pursuant to which Defendant would pay Plaintiff $305,000 and, upon completion of all payments, Plaintiff would quitclaim title to the subject property to Defendant. Defendant has made all payments to Plaintiff, but Plaintiff has not quitclaimed title to the property to Defendant. Defendant seeks an order enforcing the settlement, which the Court is inclined to grant if Defendant submits a proper proposed judgment reflecting the terms of the parties' settlement.

The Court has previously held three hearings on Defendant's motions to enforce settlement, and the parties have not been able to agree on the terms of the proposed judgment. The Court is not inclined to fashion a unique remedy to "act as excelsior" and sign the quitclaim deed itself on behalf of Plaintiff. Instead, the Court suggests that Defendant submit a proposed judgment that simply reflects the terms of the parties' settlement agreement, which would require Plaintiff to quitclaim title to the property to Defendant immediately.

The Court wishes to hear from the parties at the time of the hearing concerning exactly how the judgment should be crafted to ensure Defendant ultimately obtains ownership of the subject property. The Court asks Counsel to make arrangements to appear remotely at the hearing on the motion to enforce settlement.
