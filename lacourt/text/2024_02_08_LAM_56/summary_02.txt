And here is the summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling is regarding a motion to set aside/vacate the dismissal of a complaint filed by the plaintiff, AJA Vasquez-Looper, against Renaissance Imaging Medical Associates, Inc. et al. The plaintiff seeks to reinstate the complaint and file an amended complaint naming the proper entity as a defendant. The plaintiff's counsel, Youssef H. Hammoud, has submitted a declaration stating that before the complaint was dismissed, the plaintiff learned that RIMA was not the entity responsible for the wrongdoing alleged in the complaint.

The judge has considered the moving and opposition papers but is unable to evaluate the motion due to a lack of sufficient clarification and evidence. The judge has therefore continued the hearing on the motion to February 27, 2024, and ordered the plaintiff to file a supplemental declaration and points and authorities supporting the relief sought by the motion, as well as lodge a copy of the proposed amended complaint, by February 15, 2024.
