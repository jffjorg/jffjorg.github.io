  CASE NO.: 23STCV03957
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER RE: MOTION TO BE
  RELIEVED AS COUNSEL
 
Date: 
  February 8, 2024
Time: 8:30 a.m.
Dept. 56
Jury Trial: August 19, 2024
 



 
MOVING PARTY: Tung & Associates, APLC
(“T&A”)
 
On
January 16, 2024, T&A filed a motion to be relieved as Plaintiff’s counsel
(the “Motion”).  The Motion is compliant
with California Rules of Court,
rule 3.1362.  The Motion is
unopposed.  Any opposition papers were
required to have been filed and served at least nine court days before the
hearing under California Code of Civil Procedure section 1005,
subdivision (b).
 
DISCUSSION
The
court has discretion on whether to allow an attorney to withdraw, and a motion
to withdraw will not be granted where withdrawal would prejudice the
client.  (Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915.)  
 
 
            In support of the Motion, counsel
declares that the attorney-client relationship has deteriorated to an extent
that that prevents the representation from proceeding.  The Court finds this to be an adequate basis
for withdrawal.  For this reason and
because it is unopposed, the Court GRANTS the Motion.  (Sexton
v. Superior Court (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410.)  
 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed
by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If
the department does not receive an email and there are no appearances at the
hearing, the motion will be placed off calendar. 
 
           Dated this 8th day of February 2024
