And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the motion filed by Tung & Associates, APLC (T&A) to be relieved as counsel for Karen Maciel-Gomez, the plaintiff. The motion was unopposed and was based on the deteriorated attorney-client relationship, which prevents the representation from proceeding. The court has discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw, and in this case, the court finds that the withdrawal would not prejudice the client. The court orders T&A to give notice of this ruling.
