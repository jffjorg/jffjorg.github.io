This is a tentative ruling by the Hon. Holly J. Fujie, Judge of the Superior Court, regarding a motion to compel further responses. The case involves a dispute over the enforcement of a money judgment and the sufficiency of Plaintiff's responses to discovery requests. The Court has considered the moving and opposition papers and finds that Plaintiff's responses to RFAs, FROGs, and SPROGs are sufficient, but further responses are warranted to identify documents forming the basis for Plaintiff's claims. The Court grants the motion in part and orders Plaintiff to provide further RFP responses within 20 days. The Court declines to impose monetary sanctions at this time.
