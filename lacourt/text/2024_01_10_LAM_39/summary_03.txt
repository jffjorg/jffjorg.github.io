And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has issued a tentative ruling denying the defendant's motion for attorneys' fees. The defendant had sought fees under Civil Code section 1717 and Code of Civil Procedure 1021, citing an attorneys' fees provision in the deed of trust. However, the court found that the plaintiffs' action was not an action "on a contract" containing an attorney's fees provision, as the deed of trust was not the basis of the lawsuit. Instead, the plaintiffs alleged that the defendant had promised to forgive a certain amount of debt as part of a loan modification and stay the foreclosure, and that the defendant's defense was not related to collecting, enforcing, or protecting its rights under the deed. The court denied the defendant's motion and ordered the defendant to provide notice and file proof of such with the court.
