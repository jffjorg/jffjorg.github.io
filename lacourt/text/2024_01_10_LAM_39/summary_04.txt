And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the defendant's demurrer to the fifth cause of action (fraudulent inducement-concealment) is sustained. The plaintiff's allegations of fraud do not meet the heightened pleading standard, as they are conclusory and lack specific facts to support the claims. The judge has also granted the motion to strike the prayer for punitive damages, as the fraud claim has been dismissed. The plaintiff's counsel has been denied leave to amend the complaint, as no supplemental facts have been identified that would satisfy the pleading standard. The defendant is required to file an answer within 30 days, and notice and proof of such must be filed with the court.
