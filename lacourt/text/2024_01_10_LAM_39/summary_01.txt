And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the plaintiff, Ashley Olson, is entitled to strike and tax the costs incurred by the defendants, Matrix Rehabilitation, Inc. and Patricia Apodaca, in this employment action. The judge found that the plaintiff's action was not frivolous and that the defendants are not automatically entitled to costs in a Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA) case. The judge rejected the defendants' argument that the motion was filed too late, citing California Rules of Court, rule 3.1700, which allows the court to consider motions filed within 30 days of the deadline. The judge has ordered the plaintiff's counsel to provide notice and file proof of the costs with the court.
