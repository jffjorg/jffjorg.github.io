And here is the summary in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling regarding a motion to set aside a default judgment and vacate a writ of execution filed by Respondent Marvin Carrera. The Court entered a sister-state judgment in favor of Petitioner Claudia Montes on March 15, 2021, and issued a writ of execution on October 11, 2023.

Respondent Carrera argues that he is entitled to relief under CCP ยง 473.5 and 86 because service of summons was not made with actual notice to him. However, the Court finds that CCP ยง 473.5 does not apply to sister-state judgments, and Respondent's arguments are improper under CCP ยง 1710.40(a) as they seek to relitigate matters already adjudicated in Nevada courts.

The Court notes that while Respondent's moving papers do not provide evidence of extrinsic fraud, mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect, CCP ยง 86 would still not apply to this case as judgment was entered in Nevada and not in California.

Therefore, the Court denies the motion to set aside the default judgment and vacate the writ of execution.
