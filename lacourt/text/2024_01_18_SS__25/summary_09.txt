And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the petition of Laneisha Porter, the guardian ad litem for minor Claimant La'Riah Porter Williams, for approval of the settlement of Claimant's claim against Estefani Astorge Uribe. The parties have agreed to settle Claimant's claim for $9,517.00, which will be paid after deducting medical expenses, attorney's fees, and court fees. The Court notes that the Petition was initially deficient, but the petitioner has since filed a subsequent Petition that corrects the deficiencies. The Court finds that the Petition satisfies the requirements under CCP § 372 and grants the petition. The Court sets an Order to Show Cause (OSC) for March 27, 2024, to confirm the deposit of the settlement funds and to request dismissal of the entire action.
