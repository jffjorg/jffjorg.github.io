Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the defendants' motion to quash service of summons due to defective service. The plaintiffs had attempted to serve the defendants personally, but failed. They then served the defendants by mail, but failed to include copies of the notice and acknowledgement as required by California Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) § 415.30. The defendants received the summons and complaint, but did not sign the acknowledgement. The court finds that the plaintiffs have failed to meet their burden of proving personal jurisdiction over the defendants, and therefore grants the motion to quash service of summons.
