Petitioner alleges that Defendant collided into  the vehicle in which Claimant was a rear passenger causing her injuries. Petitioner  was appointed minor Claimant’s guardian ad litem on August 10, 2023.    On August 18, 2023, Petitioner  filed a Petition to Confirm Minor’s Compromise as to Claimant: La’Riah Porter  William, age 12.    On August 18, 2023, Petitioner  filed the Order Approving Compromise and Order to Deposit Money into Blocked  Account. On November 09, 2023, the Court, noting deficiencies with the Petition,  continued the hearing till January 18, 2023.    On November 21, 2023, Petitioner  filed the instant Petition for Approval of Compromise of Claim or Action or  Disposition of Proceeds of Judgment for Minor.    No opposition has been filed.   MOVING PARTY  POSITION   Claimant, who is 13 years old, has  agreed to settle her claim against the Defendant for $9,517.00. As a result of a  car accident that happened on January 12, 2023, Claimant suffered back pain and  pain in Claimant’s left hand. Claimant received an emergency medical exam,  x-rays and chiropractic care. Claimant has fully recovered from her injuries. A  total of $5,869.86 will be deducted from the settlement proceeds reflecting $3,219.50  in medical expenses, $2,379.25 in attorney’s fees, and $ 271.11 in Court fees  and costs, leaving Claimant with $3,647.14. The $3,647.14 will be deposited in  insured accounts in one or more financial institutions in California, subject  to withdrawal only upon the authorization of the Court.   OPPOSITION               No  opposition has been filed.    REPLY               No reply  has been filed.    ANALYSIS   I.          Legal  Standard  Court approval is required for  all settlements of a minor’s claim. (Prob. Code §§ 3500, 3600, et seq.;  CCP § 372.) “‘[W]ithout trial court approval of the proposed compromise of the  ward’s claim, the settlement cannot be valid.  [Citation.] [¶] Nor is the  settlement binding [on the minor] until it is endorsed by the trial court.’” (Pearson  v. Superior Court (2012) 202 Cal.App.4th 1333, 1338.)  A minor, like  Claimant, “shall appear either by a guardian or conservator of the estate or by  a guardian ad litem appointed by the court in which the action or proceeding is  pending, or by a judge thereof, in each case.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 372(a)(1).)  Alternatively, the petitioner may file a declaration demonstrating that he or  she has a right to compromise the minor’s claim under Cal. Probate Code §  3500.     Regarding the substance of the  Petition, to obtain court approval of the settlement of a minor’s claims, the  petitioner must file a complete and “verified petition for approval of  the settlement and must disclose ‘all information that has any bearing upon the  reasonableness of the compromise.’ [Citations.]” (Barnes v. Western Heritage  Ins. Co. (2013) 217 Cal.App.4th 249, 256; Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.950.)  (Italics added.)    Under Probate Code § 3505, if a petition is unopposed, the  Court must issue a decision on the petition at the conclusion of the hearing.      II.        Discussion     Minor – La’Riah  Porter William, 13 years  old  Guardian Ad Litem – Laneisha  Porter  Defendant – Estefani  Astorge Uribe    Settlement:                                          $9,517.00  Attorney’s Fees:                                  $2,379.25  Litigation and Other Costs:                $271.11  Medical Bills:                                      $3,219.50  TOTAL TO BE PAID TO MINOR:  $3,647.14    General Requirements  ·          Petition on Form  MC-350?                             YES  ·          Proposed Order on Form  MC-351?                YES  ·          Proof of service on  other parties?                       YES    Type of injury, medical expenses    Claimant La’Riah Porter William complained of back Pain and left-hand pain. (Pet. p. 2,  ¶¿6.)  Claimant has a pre-existing left-hand injury prior to the accident (Id.)   She received the following treatment: “Emergency medical exam; x-rays and  chiropractic care.”  (Id. at ¶ 7.)  She has recovered  completely and does not have any permanent injuries.  (Id. at ¶ 8.)    ·          Medical records  documenting injuries and treatment?  Yes.

The  name, branch, and address of each depository are specified in Attachment 18b(2).” (8/18/23 Pet. p. 8, 18(b)(2).)  Petitioner submits  Attachment 18(b)(2), which identifies that the funds should be deposited to  Banck of America. (Id. Attach. 18(b)(2).)   Attorneys’ Fees and Litigation Costs    ·          Attorneys’ fees  requested?  Yes, 25% of total settlement.  (8/18/23 Pet., Attach.  13a, Lam Decl. ¶¶ 2,4.)  ·          If yes, attorney  declaration including factors under CRC 7.955(b)?  Declaration does not  discuss any of the factors.

(Pet. p. 5, ¶ 13b.)     In its prior decision the Court noted the following deficiencies with  the Petition:  (1)    Because Petitioner is also minor Claimant’s guardian ad  litem, the guardian ad litem box in item 1 should be checked;    (2)     Item 10(c)  should be completed;    (3)    Item 12(a) should be completed;    (4)    Item 12(b)(5)(a)(ii) should state the amount of  statutory lien;    (5)    Item 12(b)(5)(b)(i) provides that $4245 was charged  with a $1995.15 negotiated reduction, but lists $1995.15 as the amount to be  paid from settlement (rather than $2249.85 after the reduction);   (6)    Item 12(b)(5)(b)(ii) provides that $2605 was charged  with a $1224.35 negotiated reduction, but lists $1224.35 as the amount to be  paid from settlement (rather than $1380.65 after the reduction); and   (7)    The reduction agreements should be included as  Attachment 12b(5) to the Petition   (11/09/23  Minute Order.)  The Court notes that since issuing its order, Petitioner has filed a subsequent  Petition on November 21, 2023, which corrects the deficiencies noted in the 11/09/23  Minute Order. Taken together with  the petition filed on August 18, 2023, the Court finds the Petition  sufficiently satisfies the requirements under CCP § 372. For those reasons, the Court GRANTS  the Petition submitted on behalf of Claimant La’Riah Porter  Williams.    II.        Conclusion                           Petitioner/ Guardian ad  Litem, Laneisha Porter’s Petition for Approval of Compromise of Claim or Action or  Disposition of Proceeds of Judgment for Minor on behalf of Claimant La’Riah  Porter Williams is GRANTED.   The Court  sets the following OSC’s:   ORDER TO  SHOW CAUSE Re:  Proof of Deposit of Money  Into Blocked Account  and  ORDER TO  SHOW CAUSE Re:  Request for Dismissal of  Entire Action are set for MARCH 27, 2024 at 9:30 a.m.in Department 25 of the Spring Street Courthouse.  All Future dates are advanced and vacated.
