And here is the English summary:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of George Rahme v. The Bicycle Casino, L.P. et al. (Case No. 23STCV16017). The defendant, TBC, L.P., has moved the Court to compel the plaintiff, George Rahme, to arbitrate his claims against TBC and stay the action. The Court is requesting that the parties address two key issues: whether the plaintiff contends that he did not sign the arbitration agreement or that he signed it but did not do so "knowing"; and the effect of a sentence in the 2018 arbitration agreement that waives the right to bring a private attorney general representative action.
