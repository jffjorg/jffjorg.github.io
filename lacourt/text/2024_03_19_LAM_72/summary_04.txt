Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling denying the petition of J.G. Wentworth Originations, LLC (Petitioner) to approve the transfer of structured settlement payment rights from an unidentified payee (Payee). The Court has also ordered Petitioner and its counsel, James Felton, to show cause why they should not be sanctioned up to $1500 each for making express misrepresentations to the Court.

The Petitioner failed to meet several procedural requirements, including providing a copy of the transfer agreement, a listing of the Payee's dependents, and a copy of the disclosure required by statute. The Court also notes that the Payee's declaration indicates that she wishes to exercise her right to cancel the transfer agreement.

The Court is concerned about Petitioner's actions in this case, including filing the petition without identifying the Payee or attaching a declaration, and filing an ex parte application to advance the hearing date with allegedly untrue information. The Court relied on counsel's apparently untrue statement to advance the hearing date, which creates an appearance of wrongdoing.

The Court has set an order to show cause for April 8, 2024, at 8:30 a.m., and requires Petitioner and its counsel to file any response to the order to show cause no later than March 29, 2024.
