to Compel Further Responses to Request for Production of Documents (set two)
 
SUMMARY
OF ACTION
On
February 2, 2023, and May 1, 2023, Plaintiff John Domantay filed a wage and
hour and unfair business practices complaint, and first amended complaint,
against Defendants Kix Screening and Protection Services, LLC and Christopher
Walters. Defendants answered on June 8, 2023. 
 
On
June 26, 2024, a representative of defense counsel filed a notice of death of
defense attorney Sheldon Rosenfield. 
 
RULING: Granted.
Plaintiff John Domantay moves to compel further responses to
request for production of documents (set two), numbers 53-56 from Defendant Kix
Screening and Protection Services, LLC. Plaintiff contends Defendant only
provided meritless objections and evasive responses, without production of
documents confirmed in their possession via deposition.
 
Following the notice of death of attorney Sheldon
Rosenfield, the court docket shows no new substitution of counsel on behalf of
either defendant. The corporate entity cannot appear in the action without
representation from an admitted attorney. (Merco
Constr. Engineers, Inc. v. Municipal Court (1978) 21 Cal.3d 724, 731.) The
motion is unopposed. The court electronic filing system shows no reply on file
at the time of the tentative ruling publication cutoff.
 
The court finds the objections lack merit. While Defendant
denies any responsive items, Plaintiff cites to the deposition of the PMQ,
whereby applicable documents were admitted as existing. [Declaration of Amanda
Erickson, ¶¶ 5-6, Ex. 1: Deposition Transcript; Ex. 2-3: Request for Production
and Responses.] 
 
The motion is GRANTED. While Defendant cannot serve
responses without new counsel, assuming new counsel substitutes into the case
the court orders further responses. Defendant is shall either provide code
compliant responses regarding the lack of applicable documents, if Defendant
elects to continue with denial notwithstanding the deposition testimony, or
Defendant may produce responses. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2031.210, subd. (a)(1-2),
2031.220, 2031.230.)
 
 
The court imposes the statutory minimum of $1,000 in
sanctions against Plaintiff Kix Screening and Protection Services, LLC. Payable
within 30 days. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2023.050, subd. (a), 2031.280, subd. (a).)

 
Discovery disputes leading to voluminous requests from the
court may lead to the appointment of a discovery referee. The court does not
conduct independent discovery conferences.
 
Order to Show Case re: Sanctions, etc. on calendar for
December 3, 2024. Trial remains set for January 6, 2025. 
 
Plaintiff to give notice to all parties.
