And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the motion to compel further responses to request for production of documents (set two) filed by plaintiff John Domantay against defendant Kix Screening and Protection Services, LLC. The plaintiff contends that the defendant only provided meritless objections and evasive responses, without production of documents confirmed in their possession via deposition. The court found that the objections lack merit and that the defendant must provide code-compliant responses regarding the lack of applicable documents. The court also imposed a statutory minimum of $1,000 in sanctions against the defendant, payable within 30 days. The court ordered the defendant to either provide responses or produce the requested documents. Discovery disputes may lead to the appointment of a discovery referee, and an order to show cause regarding sanctions and other issues is set for December 3, 2024.
