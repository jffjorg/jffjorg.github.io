SUMMARY
OF ACTION
On
July 26, 2023, Integrated Lender Services filed a complaint in interpleader
against Sharon Munoz, Patricia Munoz, and Vivian Yamaguchi. Plaintiff alleges
the complaint arises from a surplus balance of $344,954.56 following the August
3, 2022, non-judicial foreclosure sale of 732-734 Leonard Ave., Los Angeles. Plaintiff
alleges the complaint in interpleader was necessary due to competing claims for
the surplus funds amongst all three defendants.
 
Defendant
Yamaguchi answered the complaint on September 26, 2023. Particia Munoz filed an
answer and amended answer on October 23, 2023, and December 14, 2024. A default
was entered against Sharon Munoz on October 10, 2023.
 
RULING: Granted.
Plaintiff,
Integrated Lender Services moves for leave to deposit $342,597.63 with the
court, and discharge from the action. Plaintiff filed a notice of
non-opposition. 
 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 386 states in relevant part: 
 
A defendant, against
whom an action is pending upon a contract, or for specific personal property,
may, at any time before answer, upon affidavit that a person not a party to the
action makes against him, and without any collusion with him, a demand upon
such contract, or for such property, upon notice to such person and the adverse
party, apply to the court for an order to substitute such person in his place,
and discharge him from liability to either party, on his depositing in court
the amount claimed on the contract, or delivering the property or its value to
such person as the court may direct; ¿and the court may, in its discretion,
make the order; ¿or such defendant may file a verified cross-complaint in
interpleader, admitting that he has no interest in such amount or such property
claimed, or in a portion of such amount or such property and alleging that all
or such portion of the amount or property is demanded by parties to such action
or cross-action and apply to the court upon notice to such parties for an order
to deliver such property or portion thereof or its value to such person as the
court shall direct.  And whenever conflicting claims are or may be made upon a
person for or relating to personal property, or the performance of an
obligation, or any portion thereof, such person may bring an action against the
conflicting claimants to compel them to interplead and litigate their several
claims.  The order of substitution may be made and the action of interpleader
may be maintained, and the applicant or interpleading party be discharged from
liability to all or any of the conflicting claimants, although their titles or
claims have not a common origin, or are not identical but are adverse to and
independent of one another.
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 386, subd. (a).)
 
A party who holds property to which a person or various
persons re assert claims, and where the party holds no interest other than as
stakeholder, the defendant may bring a motion under Code of Civil Procedure
section 386. (Cantu v. Resolution Trust
Corp. (1992) 4 Cal. App. 4th 857, 875.) The moving party only need “file a
disclaimer relinquishing any purported claim to the stake.” (Ibid.) “Once the [party] admits liability and deposits the money with
the court, [the party] is discharged from liability and freed from the
obligation of participating in the litigation between the claimants.” (City of Morgan
Hill v. Brown (1999) 71 Cal.App.4th
1114, 1122.)
 
The complaint and motion arise from a surplus balance of
$344,954.56 following the August 3, 2022, non-judicial foreclosure sale of
732-734 Leonard Ave., Los Angeles.
 
The court finds no other basis of
liability against Integrated Lender Services,
and therefore grants the motion for deposit and discharge of all liability
claims on the bond. (Code Civ. Proc., § 386, subd. (b).) Dismissal effective
upon deposit of the funds with the court. (Code Civ. Proc., § 386.5.)
 
Integrated Lender Services also moves for $17,621.92 in
attorney fees and costs. “In ordering the discharge of such party, the court
may, in its discretion, award such party his costs and reasonable attorneys’
fees from the amount in dispute which
has been deposited with the court. At the time of final judgment in the
action the court may make such further provision for assumption of such costs
and attorney fees by one or more of the adverse claimants as may appear
proper.”  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 386.6, subd. (a); UAP-Columbus
JV 326132 v. Nesbitt (1991) 234 Cal.App.3d 1028, 1036; Great West-Life Assur. Co. v. Superior Court (1969) 271 Cal.App.2d
124, 128.) The amount of attorney fees and costs must be restricted to those
incurred as to the interpleader remedy. (Sweeney
v. McClaran (1976) 58 Cal.App.3d 824, 830-831.)
 
The requested fees arise from prior efforts to execute a
settlement agreement. The settlement agreement was not executed thereby leading
to the subject motion and additional costs sought for the motion itself.
[Declaration of Kassandra Goldberg.] The request also includes $2,356.93 in
foreclosure fees and $11,118.42 in legal costs. [Declaration of Michael Reagan
and Goldberg.]
 
The court grants the unchallenged
fee and cost request.
 
Integrated
Lender Services to give notice.
