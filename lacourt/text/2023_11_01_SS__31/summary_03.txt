And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motions to compel discovery responses filed by Defendant Bodega Latina Corp. and its affiliates. The motions were filed because the Plaintiff, Manuel Navarrette, failed to respond to discovery requests despite being properly served. The judge finds that the Defendant properly served the discovery requests and that the Plaintiff failed to respond in a timely manner. As a result, the judge is ordering the Plaintiff to serve verified responses to the discovery requests without objections within 15 days.

Additionally, the judge has awarded sanctions to the Defendant in the amount of $675, which includes $225 per hour for attorney fees and $450 for expenses. The sanctions are mandatory and are intended to ensure that the Plaintiff and their attorney comply with the discovery requests.

The judge has also required the Plaintiff and their attorney to pay the sanctions to the Defendant within 15 days. The judge encourages the parties to meet and confer to resolve any outstanding issues and notes that the parties should assume that others may appear at the hearing to argue.
