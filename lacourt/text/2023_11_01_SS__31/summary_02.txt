  - "Plaintiff did not see anything on the floor aside from the black skid mark she attributes as coming from the heel of her shoe. Plaintiff's conclusion that there must have been lard on the floor is speculative and unsupported by any evidence."
  - "A reasonable trier of fact would not be able to find in Plaintiff's favor on the presence of something slippery on the floor given that Plaintiff's lack of evidence of any slippery substance, and the absence of evidence to indicate there is a basis for concluding the subject area actually was slippery/dangerous."
