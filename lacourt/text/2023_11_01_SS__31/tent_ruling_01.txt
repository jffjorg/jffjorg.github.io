  Case Number:  20STCV44672    Hearing Date:   November 1, 2023    Dept:  31 DEPT:   31 OSC DATE:  11/01/2023 CASE NAME/NUMBER:  20STCV44672 ARAM KARYAN vs JAYSN KEITH DOBARD, et al. REQUEST FOR COURT JUDGMENT AGAINST [DEFAULTING PARTY]:  JAYSN KEITH DOBARD RECOMMENDATION:   DENY for reasons stated below.  TENTATIVE  The request for default judgment submitted on September 27, 2023 is DENIED for the following reasons:  The use of CIV-100 is mandatory. (CRC 3.1800(a).) The Court is unable to locate Plaintiff’s request for court default judgment on CIV-100.   It is unclear if Plaintiff is seeking default judgment against both Defendants Jaysn Keith Dobard (“Dobard”) and Skyline Exchange LLC (“Skyline”) (collectively, “Defendants”), or against only Dobard. Plaintiff’s proposed judgment on JUD-100 names only Dobard, whereas the declarations filed appear to seek default against both Defendants. Plaintiff’s request for default judgment must be consistent.   If Defendants are jointly and severally liable for the same amount, Plaintiff must submit one JUD-100 identifying all jointly and severally liable defendants in item 5(a). If Defendants are not jointly and severally liable for the same amount, Plaintiff must submit admissible evidence to substantiate the liability of and damages sought against each separate Defendant, and must show recovery of different amounts are not duplicative. (CRC 3.1800(a)(7).)  Additionally, the Court is unable to locate a copy of the Statement of Damages. Plaintiff must submit a copy of the Statement of Damages served on each Defendant. (CRC 3.250(a)(20).)   Further, Plaintiff has not dismissed all other parties, including all unnamed Doe Defendants, whom Plaintiff is not seeking default judgment against. This is required per CRC 3.1800(a)(7).  Lastly, the exhibits attached to Plaintiff’s declaration are unauthenticated. Plaintiff must still introduce admissible prima facie evidence of damages. (Johnson v. Stanhiser (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 357, 361.)  No later than __________________, Plaintiff is to submit a new default judgment package correcting these defects. Failure to do so may result in the imposition of sanctions, including monetary sanctions and/or dismissal. The OSC re entry of default judgment is continued to _____________.
