Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the petition to approve the compromise of the pending action of a person with disability and has tentatively denied the petition due to several issues. The proposed special needs trust (SNT) does not meet the requirements of LASC rule 4.116(b) and the court will require an amended trust instrument. Additionally, the court will require a bond of $4,044,000 to cover the full amount of the net settlement proceeds. The court will also continue the hearing for notice of hearing with proof of service on the state agencies. The proposed trust instrument does not meet the requirements of LASC rule 4.116(b) and the court will require a new proposed SNT instrument. The court will not approve the petition until these issues are resolved.
