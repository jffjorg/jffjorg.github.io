And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling denies the request for default judgment submitted by Aram Karyan, the plaintiff, against Jaysn Keith Dobard and Skyline Exchange LLC, the defendants. The judge's primary reasons for denying the request are that the plaintiff failed to submit a complete and consistent request for default judgment, did not provide a copy of the Statement of Damages served on each defendant, did not dismiss all other parties, and did not authenticate the exhibits attached to their declaration. The judge orders the plaintiff to submit a new default judgment package correcting these defects no later than a specified date and warns that failure to do so may result in sanctions, including monetary sanctions and/or dismissal. The hearing on default judgment is continued to a later date.
