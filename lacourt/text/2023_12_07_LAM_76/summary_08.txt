Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has considered the placement of Section 3334 in the Civil Code and concludes that it defines a remedy rather than an independent cause of action. The section is located among other statutes that define damages awardable for particular claims, indicating a legislative intent to provide a remedy rather than create a standalone cause of action. The Court notes that a cause of action must be established before a remedy can be awarded. The Court cites a previous case, Venice Coalition to Preserve Unique Community Character v. City of Los Angeles (2019), which holds that an injunction is a remedy, not a cause of action, and therefore cannot be issued if the underlying causes of action are not established.
