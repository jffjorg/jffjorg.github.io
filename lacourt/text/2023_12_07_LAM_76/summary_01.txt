This tentative ruling addresses Defendant Kia America, Inc.'s motion to tax Plaintiff's memorandum of costs.

The Court finds that Plaintiff is entitled to recover deposition costs, expert witness fees, and other charges, as permitted by California Code of Civil Procedure and California Civil Code.
