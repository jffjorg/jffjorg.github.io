And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Defendant American Honda Motor Co., Inc.'s motion for summary adjudication as to the fourth cause of action, which alleges fraudulent concealment by Defendant. The judge found that Plaintiffs did not establish a special or transactional relationship with Defendant, and therefore did not rely on any representation by Defendant in making their purchase decision. The judge also found that Plaintiffs did not cite any evidence to dispute Defendant's evidence that Plaintiffs did not rely on any representation by Defendant. As a result, the judge concluded that Plaintiffs failed to cite evidence sufficient to raise a triable issue of material fact, and therefore granted the motion for summary adjudication.
