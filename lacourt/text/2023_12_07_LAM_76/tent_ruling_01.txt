ANALYSIS
Motion To Tax
Costs
Discussion
Following a jury trial, judgment was
entered in favor of Plaintiff. Defendant seeks to tax Plaintiff’s memorandum of
costs as follows:
1.         The
$19,874.87 judgment could have been rendered in limited civil case.
             Civ. Prc. Code, § 1033(a) provides:
(a) Costs or any portion of claimed costs shall be as determined by
the court in its discretion in a case other than a limited civil case in
accordance with Section 1034 where the prevailing party recovers a judgment
that could have been rendered in a limited civil case.

     (Civ.
Proc. Code, § 1033(a) [bold emphasis added].)
            This section gives the Court
discretion to deny costs to the Plaintiff.
In
determining whether the prevailing party recovered a judgment that could have
been rendered in a court of lesser jurisdiction, the trial court does not add a
potential award of statutory or contractual attorney's fees. ( Dorman v. DWLC Corp. (1995) 35 Cal. App. 4th 1808, 1815 [42 Cal. Rptr. 2d 459].)
(Steele v. Jensen Instrument Co. (1997) 59
Cal.App.4th 326, 331.)
            However, Civil Code, § 1794 of the
Song-Beverly Act controls as the more specific statute[1].
§ 1794(d) mandates an award of reasonably incurred attorney’s fees, costs and expenses.
(Civil Code, § 1794(d):
(d) If the buyer prevails in an action under this section, the buyer
shall be allowed by the court to recover as part of the judgment a sum equal to
the aggregate amount of costs and expenses, including attorney’s fees based on
actual time expended, determined by the court to have been reasonably incurred
by the buyer in connection with the commencement and prosecution of such action.[2]
      (Civ.
Code § 1794(d).)
2.         $931.37 in filing and
Motion fees, claimed under Item 1;
            Defendant argues that only $460.51
is permitted for filing the lawsuit, but $931.37 was for filing fifteen unnecessary
motions. Defendant does not explain why each 
motion was unnecessary, nor why that would bar recovery of costs.
            The motion to tax Item No. 1 is
DENIED.
3.         $4,957.65 in
deposition costs, claimed under Item 4;
            Defendant argues that there was no
need for Plaintiff’s attorneys to take the depositions of service advisors and
technicians because the service advisors and technicians keep a contemporaneous
record of their work on the repair orders they prepare each time they work on a
vehicle.  Plaintiff's attorneys also know
the service advisors and technicians work on hundreds of vehicles each year and
cannot remember each one. There was no reason to incur the cost of serving
deposition Subpoenas on and taking the depositions of the service advisors and
technicians in this case.
            A prevailing party is entitled to
recover the following deposition costs:
 
(3)
 
(A) Taking, video
recording, and transcribing necessary depositions, including an original and
one copy of those taken by the claimant and one copy of depositions taken by
the party against whom costs are allowed.
 
(B) Fees of a certified
or registered interpreter for the deposition of a party or witness who does not
proficiently speak or understand the English language.
 
(C) Travel expenses to
attend depositions.

     (Code Civ. Proc. § 1033.5(a)(3).)
            Here, Plaintiff was entitled to take
the deposition testimony of service advisors and technicians to lay the
foundation for business records, as well as to provide any information their
personal knowledge may have added. Defendant does not dispute that these
depositions actually occurred. Plaintiff’s counsel’s pre-lawsuit knowledge of Lemon
Law does not obviate the need for deposition testimony, as Plaintiff’s counsel
does not have personal knowledge of the underlying facts.
            The Court finds that the deposition
costs were reasonably incurred and will be awarded to Plaintiff.
            The motion to tax Item No. 4 is
DENIED.  
            4.
        $719.57 for service of process
costs, claimed under Item 5;
            Defendant does not present any
argument as to why $719.57 in service of process costs should not be awarded. To
the extent Defendant relies upon its argument that such costs were incurred in
connection with unnecessary depositions, this argument is not persuasive, as
set forth above re: Item No. 4.
            The motion to tax Item No. 5 is
DENIED.
5.         $2,899.71 for expert
witness fees, claimed under item 8b;
            Defendant argues that expert
testimony was not required in this Lemon Law case, and Plaintiff’s decision to
retain an expert who resides in Sonoma does not justify his travel, hotel and
meal costs.
            Civ. Code, § 1794(d) permits the
buyer to recover costs which the court determines to have been reasonably
incurred:
(d) If the buyer prevails in an
action under this section, the buyer shall be allowed by the court to recover
as part of the judgment a sum equal to the aggregate amount of costs and
expenses, including attorney’s fees based on actual time expended, determined
by the court to have been reasonably incurred by the buyer in connection with
the commencement and prosecution of such action.
     (Civ.
Code § 1794(d).)
            Plaintiff does not explain why expert
witness testimony was required in this action, which falls squarely within the
reasoning of Oregel:
 
Isuzu also
argues it was incumbent on Oregel to prove not only that the car leaked oil but
also to show the cause of the leak, and that he failed to meet this burden
because he produced no expert testimony proving the cause of the leak. However,
the statute requires only that Oregel prove the car did not conform to the
express warranty, and proof that there was a persistent leak that Ron Baker
could not locate or repair suffices. We do not interpret the statute as
depriving a consumer of a remedy if he cannot do what the manufacturer, with
its presumably greater expertise, was incapable of doing, i.e. identify the
source of the leak. We also reject Isuzu's claim that Oregel was obliged to
introduce expert testimony to prove the nonconformity. It is within the
realm of common knowledge that a new car with an unremediable oil leak does not
conform to its warranty, and no expert testimony is necessary to establish this
proposition. (Jorgensen v. Beach 'n' Bay Realty, Inc. (1981) 125 Cal. App. 3d 155, 163 [177 Cal. Rptr. 882]
["The correct rule on the necessity of expert testimony has been
summarized by Bob Dylan: 'You don't need a weatherman to know which way the
wind blows.' " (Fn. omitted.)].)

     (Oregel
v. American Isuzu Motors, Inc. (2001) 90 Cal. App. 4th 1094, 1102 n.8.)
            As such, the Court finds that the
expert witness fees and associated travel costs were not reasonably incurred.
However, Defendant only seeks to tax the expert’s travel-related costs in the
amount of $2,899.71.
            The motion to tax Item No. 8b is
GRANTED in the amount of $2,899.71.
6.         $18,775.12 for Court
reporter fees, claimed under item 12;
            Defendant argues that these fees are
excessive on their face, compared to the Los Angeles Superior Court fee
schedule. Defendant also argues that transcripts of court proceedings which
were not ordered by the Court are not allowable as costs. (Civ. Proc.
Code,  § 1033.5(b)(5).)
            Plaintiff argues that Civil Code, §
1794(d) allows Plaintiff to recover a broader and more inclusive category of
costs than those enumerated under § 1033.5. However, Jensen v. BMW North America,
Inc. (1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 112, cited by Plaintiff, interpreted
that language in Civil Code, § 1794 “costs and expenses” to include expert
witness fees, while Civ. Proc. Code, § 1033.5(a)(8) would only such costs if
ordered by the court. While Civ. Proc. Code, § 1033.5(a)(11) only authorizes
court reporter fees as established by statute, the Court finds that Civil Code,
§ 1794(d) would authorize recovery of such expenses if reasonably incurred.
            In the Opposition, Plaintiff points
out that the parties agreed to splitting the costs of the court reporting for
the duration of trial. (Memorandum of Costs, Attachment 12c, Exh. G.) Defendant
does not dispute that the court reporter actually charged $18,775.12 in fees,
nor that Plaintiff actually paid such fees. The use of a court reporter was
reasonable for purposes of preserving the record for appeal. Under Jensen’s
interpretation of Civil Code, § 1794(d), these costs will be permitted.
            The motion to tax Item No. 12 is DENIED.
7.         $2,903.22 for
interpreter fees, claimed under item 13;
            Defendant argues that the documents
attached to the Memorandum of Costs do not support the amount or need for an
interpreter.
            Plaintiff argues that he is a native
Spanish speaker who requires Spanish language interpretation at both deposition
and at trial, and there were not Superior Court interpreters available during
trial. (Crandall Decl., ¶ 6.) Moreover, Attachment 13c, Exh. H to the Memorandum
of Costs is evidence of the costs.
            The Court finds Plaintiff’s argument
and evidence to be persuasive and the costs will be permitted.
            The motion to tax Item No. 13 is
DENIED.
8.         $3,527.42 in
"other" charges, claimed under item 16.
            Defendant argues that “other” costs
such as postage, photocopies, travel, parking and meals are not recoverable per
Civ. Proc. § 1033.5(b)(3). However, § 1033.5(b)(3) provides that postage,
telephone and photocopying charges may be allowable “when expressly authorized
by law.” § 1033.5(b) does not prohibit recovery of travel, parking and meal costs.
The Court will permit recovery of these costs, except for travel and meal
costs. Travel costs in the form of mileage is akin to overhead, the choice to
take an Uber incurs even greater travel costs than driving, and a person must
each lunch regardless of where they are. In this regard, the total travel/mileage
and meal costs being disallowed totals $1,477.80 (Memorandum of Costs,
Attachment 16a.) 
            As such, the motion to tax Item No.
16 is GRANTED in the reduced amount of $1,477.80.
