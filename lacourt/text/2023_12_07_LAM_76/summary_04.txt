And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The tentative ruling denies the motion of Jupiter Warehouse and Distribution, the plaintiff, to consolidate this case with another case, 23CMCV00833, entitled 300 West Artesia, L.P. v. B&O Express, Inc. The Court had previously issued an order finding that the two cases are not related. The Court also notes that cases may not be consolidated unless they are in the same department, and any motion to consolidate cases filed in different departments may be noticed and heard after those cases have been related into a single department or were already assigned to the same department. The Court does not desire oral argument on the motion and advises counsel to contact the staff in Department 76 to inform the Court whether they wish to submit on the tentative or to argue the matter.
