[1] The Court notes that the
placement of section 3334 in Civil Code Division 4 (General Provisions), Part 1
(Relief), Title 2 (Compensatory Relief), Chapter 2 (Measure of Damages),
Article 2 (Damages for Wrongs), where the section resides among other statutes
that define damages awardable for particular claims, supports a legislative
intent for section 3334 to define a remedy rather than create an independent
cause of action.  In the absence of a
valid cause of action, a court cannot award a remedy.  (Cf. Venice Coalition to Preserve
Unique Community Character v. City of Los Angeles (2019) 31 Cal.App.5th 42,
54 (“An injunction is a remedy, not a cause of action. Therefore, it may not be
issued if the underlying causes of action are not established.”).)
