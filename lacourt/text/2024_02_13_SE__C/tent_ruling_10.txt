Tentative Ruling 
Defendant Soft Packing, Inc.’s Demurrer is OVERRULED.

Plaintiff to give notice. 
 
Background
This is a complaint for unlawful detainer by Plaintiff The
Susan M. Pratto Trust Dated July 2,1998 and Renee E. Pratto Trust Dated
December 16,1997 acting through Susan M. Pratto, as trustee (“Plaintiff”) against
Defendant Soft Packaging, Inc. (“Defendant”) regarding the commercial real
property located at 13211 Florence Avenue, Santa Fe Springs, California 90670
(the "Property").
Legal Standard 
A demurrer for sufficiency
tests whether the complaint states a cause of action.  (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.)  When considering
demurrers, courts read the allegations liberally and in context.  In a
demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading
or via proper judicial notice.  (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co.
(2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.)  “A demurrer tests the pleadings alone
and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters.  Therefore, it lies only
where the defects appear on the face of the pleading or are judicially
noticed.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 430.30, 430.70.)  At the pleading
stage, a plaintiff need only allege ultimate facts sufficient to apprise the
defendant of the factual basis for the claim against him.  (Semole v. Sansoucie (1972) 28 Cal. App. 3d 714, 721.)  A “demurrer does
not, however, admit contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law
alleged in the pleading, or the construction of instruments pleaded, or facts
impossible in law.”  (S. Shore Land Co. v. Petersen (1964) 226
Cal.App.2d 725, 732 (internal citations omitted).) 
Discussion 
Defendant demurs to the Complaint on the grounds that it
fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.  Defendant argues Plaintiff’s three-day notice
to perform or quit was defective because the lease agreement entitles Defendant
to thirty-days’ notice.  
Defendant relies upon section 13.1(e) of the lease
agreement which states: “A Default by Lessee as to the terms, covenants,
conditions or provisions of this Lease, or of the rules adopted under Paragraph
40 hereof other than those described in subparagraphs 13.1(a), (b), (c) or (d),
above, where such Default continues for a period of 30 days after written
notice; provided, however, that if the nature of Lessee's Default is such that
more than 30 days are reasonably required for its cure, then it shall not be
deemed to be a Breach if Lessee commences such cure within said 30 day period
and thereafter diligently prosecutes such cure to completion.” (Complaint, Ex. 1, Lease Agreement ¶ 13(e).)

Plaintiff argues that the notices are for illegal
activities and nuisance which are specifically governed by section 13.1(c) of
the lease agreement.  This section only
requires a three-day notice period: “The failure of Lessee to allow Lessor and/or
its agents access to the Premises or the commission of waste, act or acts
constituting public or private nuisance, and/or an illegal activity on the
Premises by Lessee, where such actions continue for a period of 3 business
days following written notice to Lessee. In the event that Lessee commits
waste, a nuisance or an illegal activity a second time then, the Lessor may
elect to treat such conduct as a non-curable Breach rather than a Default.” (Complaint,
Ex. 1, Lease Agreement ¶ 13(c) (emphasis added).)  
The Court must accept as true all facts properly pleaded in
the Complaint.  Here, Plaintiff alleges the
existence of the Lease Agreement (Complaint ¶ 7); termination of the Lease
Agreement by Notices served on December 15, 2023, which all expired no later
than December 22,2023 (Complaint ¶¶15-17), and defendant remains in possession
of the Property (Complaint ¶ 19).  Based
thereon, the Court determines that Plaintiff has pled sufficient facts to
constitute a cause of action.  
 
Accordingly, Defendant’s Demurrer is OVERRULED.
