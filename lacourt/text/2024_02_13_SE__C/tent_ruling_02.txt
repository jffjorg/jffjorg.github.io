Tentative Ruling 
I.               
Defendant Loma Linda University Shared
Services’ Motion to Transfer Venue is DENIED. 
Plaintiff to give notice. 
 
Loma Linda University Shared Services (“LLUSS”) moves for
an order transferring venue of the instant action to the Superior Court of San
Bernardino County.
Background 
Plaintiff filed his complaint in Los Angeles Superior Court
on October 22, 2020. (Jacobsen Decl. ¶ 2, Ex. A.) The complaint alleges nine
causes of action: assault, battery, intentional infliction of emotional
distress, false arrest, false imprisonment, violations of Civil Code sections
51.7 and 52.1, negligence, negligent hiring, and negligent supervision. (Id.)
The complaint originally named ten defendants, consisting of two corporate
entities and eight individuals. All defendants except Loma Linda University
Shared Services (“LLUSS”) filed their respective answers between January 28,
2021, and July 22, 2021. (Id. ¶ 3.) 
On June 22, 2023, Plaintiff filed an amendment to the
complaint substituting in LLUSS to replace “Doe 1.” (Jacobsen Decl. ¶ 4.)
Plaintiff served the amendment on LLUSS on July 31, 2023. (Id. ¶ 5.)
LLUSS has yet to file its answer.
Legal Standard 
On
timely motion, the court must order a transfer of venue “when the court
designated in the complaint is not the proper court.” (Code Civ. Proc., §§
396b, 397(a).)  A motion to transfer venue on grounds the designated court
is not proper must file and serve the motion before or at the time of filing an
answer, demurer, or motion to strike.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 396b.) 
“Venue is determined based on the complaint on file at the time the motion to
change venue is made.”  (Brown v. Superior Court (1984) 37 Cal.3d
477, 482; Haurat v. Superior Court for Los Angeles County (1966) 241
Cal.App.2d 330, 337 [“Venue is determined on the basis of the complaint as it
stands at the time the motion to change is made, and the plaintiff is not
permitted to make a subsequent election of theories by proposed amendments
thereto”].)  In an action involving personal injuries, a venue is proper
where a defendant resides or where the injuries occurred.   (Code
Civ. Proc., § 395(a).)   
 
The burden is on the moving party to establish facts justifying
the transfer.  (Mission Imports, Inc. v. Superior Court¿(1982) 31
Cal.3d 921, 928.)  Absent “an affirmative showing to the contrary, the
presumption is that the county in which the title of the action shows that it
is brought is, prima facie, the proper county for the commencement and
trial of the action.”  (Ibid.; Fontaine v. Superior Court¿(2009)
175 Cal.App.4th 830, 836.)  The moving party may submit declarations
containing admissible evidence in support of the motion to transfer
venue.  (Mission Imports, supra, 31 Cal.3d at p. 928.)   
 
Discussion 
This is the second time a motion to transfer venue has been
made in this case.  The Court denied
Defendants’ Motion to Transfer Venue on December 7, 2023, on the grounds that
it was untimely.  LLUSS, a newly added
defendant, argues this Motion to Transfer Venue is timely because it was filed
before the deadline for LLUSS to file a responsive pleading, and before LLUSS
filed an answer. (CCP § 396b(a).) However, the
Court did not deny the first Motion to Transfer Venue because Defendants failed
to file their motion before they were required to answer.  The first Motion to Transfer Venue was denied
because Defendants failed to explain why they waited two and one-half years to
file the motion.  Although LLUSS is a new
defendant in this lawsuit, no new evidence is presented by the parties in
support of their respective positions. 
The record is substantially the same as it was when the Court denied
Defendants’ Motion to Transfer Venue on December 7, 2023, except that the case
is now two months older.  LLUSS cites no
authority, and the court is aware of none, which requires the Court to grant a
motion to transfer venue under these circumstances.  Therefore, for the reasons stated in the
Court’s order dated December 7, 2023, the Court determines that LLUSS’ Motion
to Transfer Venue is untimely.  
Accordingly, LLUSS’ Motion to Transfer Venue is
DENIED.
