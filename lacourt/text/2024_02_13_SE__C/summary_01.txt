And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling in this shareholder derivative action, appointing a Discovery Referee for all discovery purposes in the action. The parties are required to submit up to three nominees for appointment as a referee within 10 days of this order, and any objections to the other party's nominees must be submitted within 15 days of this order. The Court has also ordered Defendant S&H Business Management, Inc. to bear all costs associated with the Discovery Referee.

The Court's decision was made after considering the parties' submissions and the exceptional circumstances of the case. The Court noted that the parties have been unable to agree on discovery responses, and the appointment of a Discovery Referee is necessary to resolve these disputes. The Court also considered the fact that Plaintiff Myung Sik Kim is a 50% owner of S&H and has a right to review S&H's records, but Defendant S&H is denying her access to these records.

The Court's ruling is based on Code of Civil Procedure § 639, which allows for the appointment of a Discovery Referee in exceptional circumstances. The Court finds that the exceptional circumstances in this case include the multiple discovery motions and disputes, the large number of documents to be reviewed, and the need for a neutral third party to resolve these disputes.

The Court's decision is subject to change based on any opposition or further submissions from the parties. The parties are also required to meet and confer on discovery issues and submit a joint statement of discovery disputes and proposed discovery schedule.
