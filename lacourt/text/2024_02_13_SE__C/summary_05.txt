And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel further response to requests for production and special interrogatories. The Plaintiff, Patricia Garcia, filed the underlying action alleging workplace discrimination and harassment against her employer, US Motor Works, LLC (Defendant MotorWorks).

The Plaintiff served Defendant MotorWorks with Special Interrogatories and Request for Production, and Defendant MotorWorks responded to the requests. However, the Plaintiff argued that the responses were incomplete and defective, and the Defendant argued that the requests were overbroad and invasive of employee privacy.

The Court finds that the Plaintiff has fulfilled the meet and confer requirement and that the request for production is within the proper scope of discovery, except for wage information which shall be redacted from the response. The Court also finds that the request for special interrogatories is overbroad and will be limited to the four-month period from August 2021 to November 2021.

The motion is granted in part, with the Plaintiff's requests for production and special interrogatories being granted, subject to the limitations noted above. The Court declines to impose sanctions on the Defendant, finding that it acted with substantial justification in opposing the motion.
