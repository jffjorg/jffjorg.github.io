And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to set aside default filed by Jonathan Gough, a defendant in a lawsuit against Palm Vista, LLC, et al. The lawsuit relates to a grant agreement with the City of Bellflower, California, for the development of the Palm Vista Mobile Home Park. Gough was served with the summons and complaint on June 14, 2022, but argues that he was not personally served and did not have actual notice of the lawsuit until January 23, 2023. The judge finds that the proof of service is valid on its face and that Gough's motion is untimely, as it was filed more than 14 months after he was served notice of default. The judge also notes that the motion is based on extrinsic evidence, which is not sufficient to show the invalidity of the default judgment. Therefore, the judge denies Gough's motion to set aside default.
