And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling grants Defendant Claire Camburn's motion to vacate the entry of default. Claire had been mistakenly led to believe that the lawsuit would be dismissed after Plaintiff Tanya Camburn promised to "drop [her] lawsuit". As a result, Claire did not file an answer to the Complaint and default was entered against her. The court has accepted Claire's assertion that she was excusably negligent and has granted her motion to vacate the entry of default. Claire is ordered to file and serve her answer within 5 days.
