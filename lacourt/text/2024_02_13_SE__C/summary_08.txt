And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the defendants' demurrer is continued to April 2, 2024, due to their failure to comply with California Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) §430.41, which requires a meet and confer process before filing a demurrer. The defendants are ordered to engage in this process with the plaintiff and file a declaration setting forth their efforts. If the parties are unable to resolve the issues informally, they may appear and argue the merits of the demurrer on the continued hearing date.
