And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling denies the motion of Defendant Loma Linda University Shared Services (LLUSS) to transfer the venue of the lawsuit to the Superior Court of San Bernardino County. The Plaintiff, Jesse Simpson, filed his complaint in the Los Angeles Superior Court on October 22, 2020, and the complaint alleges nine causes of action against various defendants, including LLUSS. LLUSS has not filed an answer to the complaint, and the Court has previously denied another motion to transfer venue filed by other defendants. The Court finds that LLUSS's motion is untimely and denies it, noting that the same arguments and evidence were presented in the previous motion and that the Court is not aware of any authority that requires a different outcome. The hearing on this matter is scheduled for February 13, 2024.
