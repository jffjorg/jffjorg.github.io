And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendant's demurrer to the plaintiff's complaint. The defendant argues that the three-day notice provided by the plaintiff was improper, but the judge finds that the complaint properly alleges that the notice was provided and therefore overrules the demurrer. The judge orders the plaintiff to provide notice and requires the defendant to file an answer within 10 days. The judge's decision is based on the legal standard that a demurrer tests whether the complaint states a cause of action, and that the allegations in the complaint must be taken as true at the pleading stage. The judge relies on various legal authorities, including California court decisions and statutes, to support its ruling.
