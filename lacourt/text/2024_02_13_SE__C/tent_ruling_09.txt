Tentative Ruling 
Defendant Deronn Hasan’s Demurrer is OVERRULED.
 Answer due in 10 days. 
Plaintiff to give notice.
 
Background 
This is an action for unlawful detainer alleging unpaid
rents at the property of 9043 Park Street, Bellflower, CA 90706. 
Legal Standard 
A demurrer for sufficiency
tests whether the complaint states a cause of action.  (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.)  When considering
demurrers, courts read the allegations liberally and in context.  In a
demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading
or via proper judicial notice.  (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co.
(2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.)  “A demurrer tests the pleadings alone
and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters.  Therefore, it lies only
where the defects appear on the face of the pleading or are judicially
noticed.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 430.30, 430.70.)  At the pleading
stage, a plaintiff need only allege ultimate facts sufficient to apprise the
defendant of the factual basis for the claim against him.  (Semole v. Sansoucie (1972) 28 Cal. App. 3d 714, 721.)  A “demurrer does
not, however, admit contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law
alleged in the pleading, or the construction of instruments pleaded, or facts
impossible in law.”  (S. Shore Land Co. v. Petersen (1964) 226
Cal.App.2d 725, 732 (internal citations omitted).) 
Discussion 
Defendant demurs to Plaintiff’s Complaint on the grounds
that it fails to state a cause of action. Defendant argues that the three-day notice
was improper.  
Plaintiff has attached the three-day notice to the Complaint
(Complaint, Exhibit 2.) At the pleading stage, the Court must take the
allegations in the Complaint as true. Therefore, the Court finds that the
Compliant properly alleges that a three-day notice was provided. 
Accordingly, Defendant’s demurrer is OVERRULED.
