Plaintiff to give notice. 
 
Background
Defendants, International Forklift Company and Brian
Challoner Demurrer on the punitive damage allegations in the First Amended
Complaint (FAC) on the grounds that the FAC does not state facts sufficient to
constitute a cause of action against Defendants. Defendants also seeks Demurrer
on the allegations for intentional infliction of emotional distress, negligent
inflection of emotional distress, assault, battery, statutory negligent
entrustment of a vehicle and business and professions code §17200, et seq.
against Defendants in that there are no facts whatsoever stated regarding this
cause of action.
Meet and Confer  
CCP
§430.41(a) states that, before filing a demurrer, the moving party must engage
in a specified meet and confer process with the party who filed the pleading at
issue for the purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached as to
the filing of an amended pleading that would resolve the objections to be
raised in the demurrer/motion to strike. “[T]he demurring party shall meet and
confer in person or by telephone with the party who filed the pleading
that is subject to demurrer for the purpose of determining whether an agreement
can be reached that would resolve the objections to be raised in the demurrer.
If an amended complaint…is filed, the responding party shall meet and confer
again with the party who filed the amended pleading before a demurrer to the
amended pleading.” (emphasis added.) (CCP §430.41(a).) A declaration setting
forth such meet and confer efforts must accompany the demurrer. (CCP §
430.41(a)(3).)   
 
The
Court finds that the Moving Defendants have not satisfied their meet and confer
obligations.  The provisions of the Code are mandatory; compliance is not
optional.  
 
Defendants
are ORDERED to comply with CCP §430.41. If, after complying with CCP
§430.41, court intervention is needed, the parties may appear and argue the
merits of the demurrer on the continued hearing date. If the parties are unable
to informally resolve the issues raised in the instant demurrer, then Counsel
for the Moving Defendants must submit a signed declaration indicating such
efforts pursuant to CCP § 430.41.
 
The
Demurrer is CONTINUED to Tuesday, April 2, 2024 at 10:30 AM in Department SE-C.
