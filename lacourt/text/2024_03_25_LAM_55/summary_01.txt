And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the Defendant's motion to continue the trial and all related dates. The motion was filed due to the departure of the Defendant's lead counsel in February 2024 and the inability to obtain the Plaintiff's mental health records. The Judge finds good cause for a continuance based on the circumstances, including the need for additional discovery and the proximity of the trial date. The Judge also finds that the other factors laid out in Rule of Court 3.1332(d) militate in favor of a brief continuance. The trial date will be set in November 2024, and the motion and discovery cutoff dates will be calculated in relation to the continued trial date.
