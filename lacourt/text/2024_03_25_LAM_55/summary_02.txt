And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on a motion brought by Christine Wells (Plaintiff) against Futura Bus Net Inc. (Defendant). The motion seeks an order compelling Defendant to respond to Plaintiff's second set of special interrogatories and monetary sanctions. The judge has granted the motion, ordering Defendant to serve initial verified responses to the second set of special interrogatories without objections, but has denied the request for monetary sanctions. The judge has found that Defendant has not served responses to the interrogatories and that the second set of interrogatories is not duplicative of the first set. The judge has also found that Defendant's failure to respond is not justified, but has imposed no monetary sanctions due to substantial justification for Defendant's position. The judge has given Defendant until April 12, 2024, to comply with the order.
