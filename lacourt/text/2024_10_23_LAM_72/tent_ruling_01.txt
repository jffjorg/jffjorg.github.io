Background
 
This is a landlord-tenant case.
 
On September 30, 2020, Plaintiff and Defendant entered a
lease agreement (the “Lease”) whereby Plaintiff rented the real property
located at 1200 S. Figueroa St., # E3503, Los Angeles, California 90015 (the
“Property”) from Defendant. (Complaint at p. 3.)
 
Defendant subsequently fell behind on rent payments and
eventually stopped making payments entirely. Defendant was evicted and allegedly
moved out on December 2, 2021. (Complaint at p. 3; Garner Decl. ¶ 2.)
 
Plaintiff filed this action on September 8, 2024, raising
claims for (1) breach of contract; and (2) common counts.
 
Default was entered against Defendant on March 28, 2024.
 
Legal Standard
 
CCP § 585 permits entry of a judgment after a Defendant has
failed to timely answer after being properly served.  A party seeking judgment on the default by
the Court must file a Form CIV-100 Request for Court Judgment, and: 
 
(1) Proof of service of the complaint and summons;
(2) A dismissal of
all parties against whom judgment is not sought (including Doe defendants) or
an application for separate judgment under CCP § 579, supported by a showing of
grounds for each judgment (CRC 3.1800(a)(7));
(3) A declaration
of non-military status as to the defendant (typically included in Form CIV-100)
(CRC 3.1800(a)(5));
(4) A brief summary of the case (CRC 3.1800(a)(1)); 
(5) Admissible
evidence supporting a prima facie case for the damages or other relief
requested (Johnson v. Stanhiser (1999)
72 Cal.App.4th 357, 361-362); 
(6) Interest computations as necessary (CRC 3.1800(a)(3)); 
(7) A memorandum of
costs and disbursements (typically included in Form CIV-100 (CRC 3.1800(a)(4));

(8) A request for
attorney’s fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties (CRC
3.1800(a)(9)), accompanied by a declaration stating that the fees were
calculated in accordance with the fee schedule as per Local Rule 3.214.  Where a request for attorney fees is based on
a contractual provision the specific provision must be cited; (Local Rule
3.207); and
(9) A proposed form
of judgment (CRC 3.1800(a)(6));
(10) Where an
application for default judgment is based upon a written obligation to pay
money, the original written agreement should be submitted for cancellation (CRC
3.1806). A trial court may exercise its discretion to accept a copy where the
original document was lost or destroyed by ordering the clerk to cancel the
copy instead (Kahn v. Lasorda's Dugout, Inc. (2003) 109 Cal.App.4th
1118, 1124);
(11) Where the
plaintiff seeks damages for personal injury or wrongful death, they must serve
a statement of damages on the defendant in the same manner as a summons (Code
Civ. Proc. § 425.11, subd. (c), (d)).
 
 
(California Rules
of Court rule 3.1800.)
 
Pursuant to Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5(a)(1), items are
allowable as costs under Section 1032 if they are “filing, motion, and jury
fees.”
 
A party who defaults only admits facts that are well-pleaded
in the complaint or cross-complaint. (Molen v. Friedman (1998) 64
Cal.App.4th 1149, 1153-1154.) Thus, the complaint must state a claim for the
requested relief.
             
 
Discussion
 
Service of the Complaint and Summons
 
            According
to the proof of service filed on February 6, 2024, Defendant was served on February
1, 2024 at 2253 South Atlantic Boulevard, Commerce, California 90040, via
substitute service on Jane Doe, the person in charge at that location.
 
 
Dismissal of Other Parties
 
The Doe defendants were dismissed from the action on August
7, 2024, pursuant to Plaintiff’s request.
 
 
Non-Military Status
 
Richard Scott avers to Defendant’s non-military status.
 
 
Summary of the Case
 
Plaintiff provides a brief summary of the case in the
Declaration of Kevin Garner. Plaintiff adequately pleads its causes of action
in the Complaint.
 
 
Evidence of Damages
 
“Code of Civil Procedure section 580 prohibits the entry of
a default judgment in an amount in excess of that demanded in the complaint.”  (Kim v. Westmoore Partners, Inc. (2011)
201 Cal.App.4th 267, 286.) Moreover, “a statement of damages cannot be relied
upon to establish a plaintiff's monetary damages, except in cases of personal
injury or wrongful death.” (Ibid.) “In all other cases, when recovering
damages in a default judgment, the plaintiff is limited to the damages
specified in the complaint.” (Ibid.) Moreover, a plaintiff must submit admissible
evidence supporting a prima facie case for the damages or other relief
requested (Johnson v. Stanhiser (1999)
72 Cal.App.4th 357, 361-362.)
 
Plaintiff seeks $125,441.26 in damages, which it attributes
to rental charges, fees, and repairs for damage to the Property. Plaintiff
provides a Final Account Statement indicating the amount due. (Garner Decl., ¶
3, Ex. B.) Plaintiff has adequately evidenced its damages.
 
 
Interest
 
Plaintiff seeks $33,336.44 in interest.
 
The Complaint requests interest on the unpaid loan amount. (Complaint
at p. 2.) Plaintiff seeks interest running from December 2, 2021 – the date of
Defendant’s eviction – to July 29, 2024. The unpaid rent and late fees,
totaling , are capable of being made certain because they accrued before this
date. The miscellaneous damages in the Final Account Statement were also made
certain by December 2, 2021 because they are all shown to have accrued prior to
that date.
 
The Lease provides for an interest rate of 10 percent per annum.
(Garner Decl., Ex. A at p. 6.)
 
Plaintiff does not provide its interest calculations. The
Court has confirmed that the amount requested is accurate.
 
 
Memorandum of Costs and Disbursements
 
Plaintiff includes a memorandum of costs in the submitted
Form CIV-100, averring that it expended $1,039.00 in costs.
 
 
Attorney’s Fees
 
            Plaintiff
requests $161.00 in attorney’s fees. The Leave provides for attorney’s fees up
to a maximum of $1,200.00 in an action to recover rent. (Garner Decl., Ex. A at
p. 6.)
 
This is an action on a contract. Because the judgment is
between $10,000.01 and $50,000, the maximum recovery of attorney’s fees is
equal to $690 plus 3% of the excess over $10,000. (Local Rule 3.214.) 
 
            $697.00
is well within this amount. The Court approves Plaintiff’s attorney’s fees.
 
 
Proposed Form of Judgment
 
            Plaintiff
has submitted a proposed form of judgment.
 
 
Submission of the Written Agreement
 
            California
Rule of Court 3.1806 states that “unless otherwise ordered” judgment upon a
written obligation to pay money requires a clerk’s note across the face of the
writing that there has been a judgment. Here, Plaintiff has not submitted the
original documents. The Court does not discern any practical need for such a
clerk’s note on the written obligation in the current case and therefore orders
that it need not be included. If this causes any issues for any party or
non-party, they are authorized to bring the matter to the Court’s
attention.  
 
 
Statement of Damages
 
Plaintiff does not need to submit a statement of damages
because this is not a personal injury or wrongful death case.
