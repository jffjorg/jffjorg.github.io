Summary in English:

The tentative ruling sustains the demurrer filed by Caltrans, a public entity, to the complaint filed by Levivian Beatrice Valencia, individually and as successor-in-interest to Cuca Bry Anna Mona Perryman's estate. The demurrer was filed on grounds of uncertainty, failure to state a cause of action, and lack of jurisdiction. The court assumes the truth of the properly pleaded factual allegations and concludes that the complaint fails to state a cause of action against Caltrans. The court grants the demurrer and allows the plaintiff 30 days to file an amended complaint.
