And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling grants in part the motion by Plaintiff Johnna Mike-Price for issue, evidence, and monetary sanctions relating to GD Midea's and Wuhu Maty's failure to comply with the court's discovery order. The court finds that the defendants' non-compliance with the court's order is a misuse of the discovery process and imposes monetary sanctions of $3,320 on the defendants and their counsel.

The court also grants the motion by Susanne Drumheller as Guardian ad Litem for minor Commander Mike-Price for statutory trial preference. The minor Plaintiff has a substantial interest in the case and is entitled to a preferential trial setting. The trial date is rescheduled for November 22, 2024.

The court declines to impose issue or evidentiary sanctions at this time, but instead orders the defendants to comply with the court's discovery order within 10 days. The court also orders the defendants to pay the plaintiff's counsel $400 per hour for 8 hours of work and $120 in filing fees.
