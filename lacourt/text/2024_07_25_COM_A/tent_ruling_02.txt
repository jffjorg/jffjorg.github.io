[TENTATIVE] ORDER SUSTAINING
DEMURRER
 TO PLAINTIFF’S COMPLAINT WITH LEAVE TO AMEND
 
      This
action arises from the alleged wrongful death of Cuca Bry Anna Mona Perryman
(“Decedent”), who was struck by a vehicle driven by Lakila Marie Young.
Decedent’s mother, Levivian Beatrice Valencia (“Valencia”), alleges claims
against Defendants on her own behalf and as successor-in-interest to Decedent’s
estate. Plaintiff alleges claims for negligence, a survival action on behalf of
decedent, and for wrongful death. 
      On
January 9, 2024, the court granted Plaintiff’s counsel’s motion to be relieved.
(M.O. 1/9/24.)  The order became
effective on January 10, 2024, when counsel served the client with the order. On
March 5, 2024, the court heard and granted Defendant, City of Los Angeles’ (“City”),
demurrer to the complaint with 30 days leave to amend. The court’s file does
not reflect that Plaintiff amended the complaint. 
      Defendant,
People of the State of California, acting by and through the Department of
Transportation (“Caltrans”) now demurs to the entire complaint on grounds of
uncertainty, failure to state a cause of action, and lack of jurisdiction as
Plaintiff has not alleged a statutory basis for liability against a public
entity. The demurrer was timely served on Plaintiff, who did not file an
opposition. 
      The bases for demurrer are limited by
statute and may be sustained for reasons including failure to state facts
sufficient to state a cause of action and uncertainty. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10.) A
demurrer “tests the sufficiency of a complaint as a matter of law and raises
only questions of law.” (Schmidt v. Foundation Health
(1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 1702, 1706.) The court must assume the truth of (1) the
properly pleaded factual allegations; (2) facts that can be reasonably inferred
from those expressly pleaded; and (3) judicially noticed matters. (Blank v. Kirwan
(1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) The court may not consider contentions, deductions,
or conclusions of fact or law. (Moore v. Conliffe
(1994) 7 Cal.4th 634, 638.) 
      Defense counsel attempted to meet and
confer in good faith with Plaintiff, who did not respond. (Andrea S. Maehara
decl., ¶¶ 2-5.)
      A
public entity is not liable for an injury except as provided by statute. (Gov. Code § 815.) Plaintiff must allege sufficiently detailed facts to support an
inference that each of the statutory elements of liability is satisfied.
General allegations are regarded as inadequate. (Mittenhuber
v. City of Redondo Beach (1983)
142 Cal.App.3d 1, 5.)
Moreover, “[s]ince the duty of a governmental agency can only be created by
statute or ‘enactment,‘ the statute or ‘enactment‘ claimed to establish the
duty must at the very least be identified." (Searcy
v. Hemet Unified School Dist. (1986)
177 Cal.App.3d 792, 802.)
      The
basis for liability against Caltrans is its alleged negligence in designing and
constructing the subject roadway and in failing to maintain traffic controls
and lighting where the accident occurred. (Complaint, ¶ 17, 31.) Plaintiff
invokes Civil Code § 1714(a) which generally requires everyone to be
responsible for injury caused to another because of a lack of ordinary care or
skill in the management of property. (Complaint, ¶ 32.) However, "section
1714 is an insufficient statutory basis for imposing direct liability on public
agencies." (Eastburn
v. Regional Fire Protection Authority (2003) 31 Cal.4th 1175, 1180.) 
      Based on
the foregoing, the demurrer is SUSTAINED. Plaintiff has 30 days to file an
amended complaint. (McDonald v. Superior Court (1986) 180 Cal.App.3d 297, 303
[leave to amend is liberally granted irrespective of whether the plaintiff
requested it].)
