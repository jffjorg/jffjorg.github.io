```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered West Hills Hospital's motion to strike the plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint (SAC) and has decided to grant the motion in part. The judge has struck the plaintiff's Paragraph 14 amendment, which was added without permission, and has also struck the "reckless and willful" and "recklessly" language in Paragraphs 8 and 22 of the SAC. This language is no longer relevant since the plaintiff has only maintained a first cause of action for medical malpractice. The judge has given the plaintiff permission to file a third amended complaint by October 31, 2024.
