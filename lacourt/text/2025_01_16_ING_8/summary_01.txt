And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge is issuing a tentative ruling on Loyola Marymount University's (LMU) Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings (MJOP) as to the second cause of action, which is a claim for Violation of the Unruh Civil Rights Act. The Judge grants LMU's motion, finding that the plaintiff, John Doe, has failed to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action against LMU.

The Judge is not basing the ruling on the statute of limitations, but rather on the sufficiency of the pleading. The Judge finds that the plaintiff's allegations do not demonstrate an intent to discriminate against him by LMU, and that the plaintiff has failed to plead intentional conduct by LMU.

The Judge will allow the plaintiff to present oral argument on whether he can sufficiently allege such conduct in a further amended pleading. The Judge tentatively grants LMU's motion for judgment on the pleadings as to the second cause of action, and orders LMU to provide notice.
