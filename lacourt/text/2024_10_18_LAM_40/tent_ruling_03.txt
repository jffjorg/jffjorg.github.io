 [TENTATIVE] RULING RE:
Defendant’s Motion
  for Reconsideration of Order Granting Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment
  [RES ID # 2488]



 
I. Background
A. Pleadings
On August 14, 2023, Plaintiff
Prime/Park LaBrea Titleholder, LLC filed a Complaint suing Defendants Arzu
Kocgirli, Serra Altan, and Does 1 to 10 in unlawful detainer. 
On September 1, 2023, Defendants
Kocgirli and Altan filed Answers to the unlawful detainer Complaint. 
On November 20, 2023, Plaintiff
requested dismissal of Defendant Serra Altan, which Judge Andrew Esbenshade
entered that day.
B. Relevant Procedural History
On May 31, 2024, Plaintiff filed a
motion for summary judgment in its favor as relates to Defendant Kocgirli, who
remained in possession of the subject premises, or, in the alternative, summary
adjudication of 11 affirmative defenses raised in Kocgirli’s September 1, 2023,
in pro per Answer. 
No opposition, reply, or notice of
non-opposition was filed. 
On June 28, 2024, the Court granted
Plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment. 
C. Motion Before the Court
On August 19, 2024, Kocgirli filed the
instant motion for reconsideration. The hearing on the motion was initially set
for September 19, 2024. At the hearing, Plaintiff’s counsel stated that he had
not received a copy of the motion. The hearing was continued to October 17,
2024, to allow Plaintiff a chance to respond. 
On October 2, 2024, Plaintiff filed
an opposition to the motion. 
The motion is now before the Court.

 
II. Motion
A. Requests for Judicial Notice
In the motion, Kocgirli “requests
that the Court take judicial notice” of a previous case between Plaintiff and
Kocgirli. However, Kocgirli has not provided a copy of the material as required
by California Rules of Court, rule 3.1306(c).
B. Code of Civil Procedure
Section 1008 subdivision (a)
1. Timeliness 
When an application for an order
has been made to a judge, a party affected by the order may, within ten (10)
days after service upon the party of written notice of entry of the order, make
an application to judge to reconsider the order. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1008,
subd. (a).) 
Plaintiff served Kocgirli with
notice of entry of the ruling on the motion for summary judgment on July 2,
2024. (7/2/2024 Proof of Service.) The Court also served notice of entry of
judgment on July 24, 2024, (7/24/2024 Notice of Entry of Judgment.) Kocgirli
did not file this motion until August 19, 2024, well after the ten-day period
provided in Code of Civil Procedure section 1008. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1008,
subd. (a).) 
Thus, the motion is untimely and
could be denied on that basis alone. However, as Kocgirli also seeks relief
under Code of Civil Procedure section 473 subdivision (b), the Court will address
the merits of the motion under both statutes. 
2. Legal
Standard
When
an application for an order has been made to a judge, or to a court, and
refused in whole or in part, or granted, or granted conditionally, or on terms,
any party affected by the order may, within 10 days after service upon the
party of written notice of entry of the order and based upon new or different
facts, circumstances, or law, make application to the same judge or court that
made the order, to reconsider the matter and modify, amend, or revoke the prior
order. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1008, subd. (a).) 
A motion for reconsideration is used to ask the court to
modify, amend, or revoke its earlier order on a prior motion to the court
because of new or different facts, circumstances, or law. (Code Civ. Proc., §
1008, subd. (a).) Such an order may involve an interim or final order (see Code
Civ. Proc., § 1008, subds. (e), (h)), where an interim order is an intermediate
ruling of some kind that requires further proceedings before the suit can be
resolved, and where a final order is an order that finally disposes of the suit
(see People v. DeLouize (2004) 32 Cal.4th 1223, 1231 [differentiating
between interim and final orders]).  
               A
party may move for reconsideration based on: (1) new or different facts, (Code
Civ. Proc., § 1008, subd. (a); see e.g., In re Marriage of LaMoure
(2013) 221 Cal.App.4th 1463, 1473 [reconsideration motion granted on new
evidence]); (2) new or different circumstances, (Code Civ. Proc., § 1008, subd.
(a)); and (3) new or different law, (Code Civ. Proc., § 1008, subd. (a); Baldwin
v. Home Sav. of Am. (1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 1192, 1196.) However, a party
cannot move reconsideration based on the court’s erroneous order, i.e., the
court’s misinterpretation of facts or law. (See Jones v. P.S. Dev. Co.
(2008) 166 Cal.App.4th 707, 724, disapproved on other grounds by Reid v.
Google, Inc. (2010) 50 Cal.4th 512, 531-532, 532 n. 4.) 
A court acts in excess of jurisdiction when it grants a motion
to reconsider that is not based upon “new or different facts, circumstances or
law.”  (Gilberd v. AC Transit (1995) 32 Cal.App.4th 1494,
1499.)  Motions for reconsideration are restricted to circumstances where
a party offers the Court some fact or circumstance not previously considered,
and some valid reason for not offering it earlier. (Ibid.) 
Moreover, there is a strict requirement of diligence, which
means the moving party must present a satisfactory explanation for failing to provide the evidence or different facts
earlier. (Garcia v. Hejmadi (1997) 58
Cal.App.4th 674, 690.) The burden under Section
1008 is comparable to that of a party seeking a new trial on the ground of
newly discovered evidence: the information must be such that the moving party
could not, with reasonable diligence, have discovered or produced it at
trial.  (New York Times Co. v. Superior Court (2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 206, 212-213.) 
3. Analysis
Kocgirli argues that the Court
should reconsider the order granting Plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment
because there are new and different facts. She states that she was unable to
present these facts before the hearing on the motion for summary judgment, as
she was hospitalized that week due to pregnancy-related complications. (Mot.
pp. 2-3.) Kocgirli argues that this new information raises triable issues of fact,
and that summary judgment is thus improper in this case. (Mot. p. 3.) 
The new facts are as follows.
Kocgirli argues that there is a potential waiver argument because in April
2023, she tried to pay the March and April 2023 rent, but Plaintiff returned
the check. (Mot. p. 2.) She further argues that she should not be held liable
for holdover damages that accrued in a previous litigation that was dismissed.
(Mot. p. 2.) Kocgirli next asserts that she experienced numerous habitability
issues throughout her tenancy including severe roach and ant infestations.
(Mot. p. 2.) Lastly, Kocgirli states that it is unclear whether Plaintiff
complied with the Los Angeles Rent Stabilization Ordinance and Just Cause
Ordinance regarding evictions. because Plaintiff has not supplied any proof
that they filed a Notice of Intent to Evict with the Los Angeles Housing
Department as required by LAMC §§ 151.09.C.9 and 165.05.B.5. (Mot. p. 2.) 
Plaintiff argues that Kocgirli does
not present new or different facts or circumstances, but rather addresses facts
that existed at the time of the summary judgment hearing that she did not
present. (Opp. p. 5.) Indeed, the circumstances Kocgirli presents in her
declaration do not constitute new or different facts within the meaning of Code
of Civil Procedure section 1008. (See New York Times, supra, 135
Cal.App.4th at 213.) At the time of the summary judgment, Kocgirli was fully
aware of the circumstances she now outlines, yet she did not present them to
the Court. 
Thus, Kocgirli’s motion for
reconsideration under Code of Civil Procedure section 1008 is DENIED. 
C. Code of Civil Procedure
section 473 subdivision (b)
            1.
Legal Standard
Section 473 subdivision (b) of the
Code of Civil Procedure provides for both discretionary and mandatory relief
from a judgment, dismissal, and/or order or other proceeding taken against a
party through his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b).) The provision provides that “[t]he court
may, upon any terms as may be just, relieve a party or his or her legal
representative from a judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken
against him or her through his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or
excusable neglect. Application for this relief shall be accompanied by a copy
of the answer or other pleading proposed to be filed therein, otherwise the
application shall not be granted, and shall be made within a reasonable time,
in no case exceeding six months, after the judgment, dismissal, order, or
proceeding was taken.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b).)
The discretionary relief portion of
section 473, subdivision (b) is not limited to defaults and default-equivalent
conduct, and courts have not construed such a limitation, particularly where
the only limiting language in this statutory provision comes with respect to
the narrower mandatory relief provision of the statute. (Minick v. City of
Petaluma (2016) 3 Cal.App.5th 15, 25-27.) For example, California courts
have held that the discretionary relief provisions of section 473, subdivision
(b) apply to a motion for relief from a summary judgment. (Id. at p. 31
[attorney’s medical condition and medication for that condition, that,
unbeknownst to him, impaired his judgment and made him unable to prepare proper
opposition to the summary judgment motion, was excusable neglect under section
473, subdivision (b)]; see also Huh v. Wang (2007) 158 Cal.App.4th 1406,
1418-19 [“Summary judgments … are not within the purview of the mandatory
relief provision” of section 473, subdivision (b) because relief is limited to “defaults,
default judgments, and dismissals,” but “[t]he discretionary relief provision
of section 473, subdivision (b) applies to any ‘judgment, dismissal, order, or
other proceeding’”].)
            2. Analysis
Kocgirli also seeks relief under
Code of Civil Procedure section 473 subdivision (b) on the grounds that “her
pregnancy resulted in surprise visits and complications that limited her
ability to participate in this case. Specifically, [Kocgirli] required an
emergency visit for an infusion on June 24, 2024, only 4 days before
Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment was heard and therefore was unable to
attend the hearing and oppose the MSJ.” (Mot. p. 7:6-11.) 
Code of Civil Procedure section 473
requires that an application for relief be accompanied by the pleading proposed
to be filed. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b) [stating that application
for relief “shall be accompanied by a copy of the answer or other
pleading proposed to be filed therein, otherwise the application shall not
be granted…”].)
Here, Kocgirli’s motion for relief
from the summary judgment ruling under section 473 subdivision (b) must then be
accompanied by her proposed opposition to the motion for summary judgment. However,
no such pleading has been submitted. 
Even assuming her motion for reconsideration
contains her proffered opposition, plaintiff has not shown mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. In fact, Kocgirli was present at
the April 26, 2024 trial setting conference, and again at the June 10, 2024
Final Status Conference. At the latter hearing, the Court considered the
parties’ stipulation to continue the jury trial and discussed the scheduling of
the Plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment. Kocgirli was therefore fully
informed of the hearing date as of June 10, 2024, and had knowledge as early as
May 31, 2024 that the motion was going to be filed. (Guzman Declaration, ¶¶
2-4.) Yet the only date on which Kocgirli relies for her argument that she was “unable
to participate fully in this case” is the date of June 24, 2024, four days
before the hearing. While that is certainly a problem for her attendance at the
motion, it does not explain her failure to file anything prior to that date,
nor does she explain why she was unable to do so.
Finally, even if the Court were to
look past these issues, the declaration and memorandum are very conclusory,
stating only that triable issues exist. For example, to respond to the
habitability argument, she states that she has “videos” but does not attach any
evidence. (Kocgirli Dec. at ¶ 5.) She states that she “do[es] not believe that Plaintiff
has complied with the Los Angeles Rent Stabilization Ordinance and Just Cause
Ordinance,” but she does not provide any evidence that they have not. (Id. at
¶ 6.) The Court does not know if she intended to submit a further declaration
or opposition with exhibits, but clearly the time for her to have done so is
now. (Code Civ. Proc. § 473, subd. (b).)
Thus, Kocgirli’s motion for
reconsideration under Code of Civil Procedure section 473 subdivision (b) is
DENIED.
III. Conclusion
Defendant Arzu Kocgirli’s Motion
for Reconsideration of Order Granting Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment
is DENIED.
