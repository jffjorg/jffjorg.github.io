And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has considered the Defendant's Motion for Reconsideration of the Order Granting the Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment. The Defendant, Arzu Kocgirli, argues that the Court should reconsider the summary judgment order because she was unable to present new information prior to the hearing due to pregnancy-related complications. However, the Court finds that the new facts presented are not new or different within the meaning of Code of Civil Procedure section 1008. The Court also notes that the Defendant was fully aware of the circumstances she now presents, but did not present them to the Court previously. Therefore, the motion for reconsideration under Code of Civil Procedure section 1008 is denied.

The Defendant also seeks relief under Code of Civil Procedure section 473 subdivision (b) on the grounds of excusable neglect and surprise. However, the Court finds that the Defendant's claim of excusable neglect is not supported by evidence, and that she had ample opportunity to present her opposition to the summary judgment motion prior to the hearing. Therefore, the motion for reconsideration under Code of Civil Procedure section 473 subdivision (b) is also denied.

In conclusion, the Defendant's Motion for Reconsideration of the Order Granting the Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment is denied.
