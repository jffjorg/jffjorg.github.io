I.       BACKGROUND
This action arises from a motor vehicle accident.
Plaintiff Ernie Irawati Soebroto (“Plaintiff”), individually and as successor
in interest to decedents Andrea Bullo and Marco Bullo (“Decedents”), alleges
that, on November 22, 2022, Decedents died as a result of Defendants Ford Motor
Company (“Ford”) and Kevin Ivan Gonzalez (“Gonzalez”) (collectively
“Defendants”)’s negligence.
On September 26, 2024, Plaintiff filed a
complaint against Defendants Ford, Gonzalez, and Does 1 to 100, alleging three causes
of action: (1) strict product liability; (2) negligence; and (3) breach of
express warranty.
            On
December 17, 2024, Ford filed the instant motion for an order authorizing the
release and reproduction of the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner-Coroner’s
Office’s photographs, x-rays, radiographs, records, and related files regarding
Decedents.
            Plaintiff
has not filed an opposition.
II.    LEGAL STANDARD
Cal.
Code of Civ. Proc. § 129 provides:
 
“(a)
Notwithstanding any other law, a copy, reproduction, or facsimile of any kind
of a     photograph,
negative, or print, including instant photographs and video recordings, of the         body, or any portion of
the body, of a deceased person, taken by or for the coroner at the          scene of death or in the
course of a post mortem examination or autopsy, shall not be             made or
disseminated except as follows:
…
(2)
As a court of this state permits, by order after good cause has been shown and
after     written
notification of the request for the court order has been served, at least five
days     before the order
is made, upon the district attorney of the county in which the post     mortem examination or
autopsy has been made or caused to be made;
(3)
For use of potential use in a civil action or proceeding in this state that
relates to the    death
of that person, if either of the following applies:
(A)
The coroner receives written authorization from a legal heir, representative,
or                        family member of
that person. The written authorization may be provided before               the action is
filed or while the action is pending.
(B)
A subpoena is issued by a party who is a legal heir or representative of the       deceased person in a
pending civil action.”
(CCP
§ 129.)
III.
  DISCUSSION
            Ford
argues that good cause exists for an order pursuant to CCP § 129 because such
records pertain directly to (1) the cause of Decedents’ deaths, (2) Plaintiff’s
claims that Decedents died as a result of alleged defects in the 1965 Ford
Mustang (“Mustang”) that Decedents were in at the time of the accident, and (3)
Ford’s defenses to Plaintiff’s claims. (Motion p. 2:13-20.) Specifically,
Plaintiff alleges that Decedents’ deaths were caused, in part, by defects in
the Mustang’s fuel system. (Ibid. at p. 4:27-28.)
            Ford
shows good cause for an order pursuant to CCP § 129. Plaintiff stipulates to
the instant motion. (Ibid. at ¶ 3; Exh. A [stipulation].) Additionally,
Ford declares written notice of this motion was served on the District Attorney
on December 17, 2024. (Adams Decl. ¶ 4.) However, Ford fails to provide proof
of service on the District Attorney as required by CCP § 129. Therefore, for
this procedural deficiency, the Court denies Ford’s motion.
IV.
CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, Ford Motor Company’s
motion for an order authorizing the release and reproduction of the Los Angeles
County Medical Examiner-Coroner’s Office’s photographs, x-rays, radiographs,
records, and related files regarding Decedents is DENIED without prejudice.
Moving party is ordered to give notice.
