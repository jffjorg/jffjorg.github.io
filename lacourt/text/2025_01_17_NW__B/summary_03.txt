And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on Defendant Sam Tucker's motion to compel further responses to Plaintiff Noah Cvengros's discovery motions. The judge finds that Plaintiff has failed to provide complete and coherent responses to the discovery motions, and therefore grants the motion. The judge orders Plaintiff to provide verified, complete, and code-compliant responses to the discovery motions within 20 days.

The judge also awards monetary sanctions to Plaintiff in the amount of $1,845, representing three hours of work per motion at an hourly rate of $185 and a $60 filing fee. The judge finds that Plaintiff's failure to provide complete and coherent responses to the discovery motions constitutes a misuse of the discovery process.

The judge notes that Defendant made diligent efforts to meet and confer with opposing counsel, but Plaintiff's counsel failed to provide a joint statement on the status of discovery. The judge concludes that Defendant's meet and confer efforts were sufficient.
