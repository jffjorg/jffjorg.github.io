I.      
BACKGROUND  
On October 2, 2024, Plaintiffs Melissa Jean Pero
(“Pero”), Kamran Hussain (“Kamran”), and Ludmila Seletskiy
(“Seletskiy)(collectively “Plaintiffs”) filed a complaint against Defendants
Asif “Robert” Hussain (“Robert”), Kelly Gorgone (“Gorgone), and Does 1 to 25
(collectively “Defendants”) alleging one cause of action for wrongful use of
civil proceedings.
On December 2, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a first amended
complaint (“FAC”) adding a second cause of action for financial elder abuse.
On December 23, 2024, Robert filed the instant anti-SLAPP
motion to strike portions of Plaintiffs’ FAC.
On January 7, 2025, Plaintiffs filed their reply.
On January 13,
2025, Robert filed his reply.
 
II.         
LEGAL STANDARD
“Litigation of an
anti-SLAPP motion involves a two-step process. First, ‘the moving defendant
bears the burden of establishing that the challenged allegations or claims
‘aris[e] from’ protected activity in which the defendant has engaged.’
[Citation.] Second, for each claim that does arise from protected activity, the
plaintiff must show the claim has “at least ‘minimal merit.’ [Citation.]”  (Bonni v. St. Joseph Health System
(2021) 11 Cal.5th 995, 1009 [citations omitted].) As to the second step
inquiry, a plaintiff seeking to demonstrate the merit of the claim “may not
rely solely on its complaint, even if verified; instead, its proof must be made
upon competent admissible evidence.” (Sweetwater Union High School
District v. Gilbane Building Co. (2019) 6 Cal.5th 931, 940 [citations
omitted].)
A
party opposing a special motion to strike has the burden to “state [] and
substantiate [] a legally sufficient claim.” (Navellier v. Sletten
(2002) 29 Cal.4th 82, 88 & 93.) “‘Put another way, the [party] “must
demonstrate that the complaint is both legally sufficient and supported by a
sufficient prima facie showing of facts to sustain a favorable judgment if the
evidence submitted by the defendant is credited.”’ [Citations.]”  (Ibid. at 88-89.)  To that end, the defendant must present
competent evidence “that would be admissible at trial.” (HMS Capital, Inc.
v. Lawyers Title Co. (2004) 118 Cal.App.4th 204, 212.) “[D]eclarations may
not be based upon ‘information and belief’ [citation]” and documents submitted
without the proper foundation will not be considered. (Ibid.)  The complaint, even if verified, is
insufficient to carry the plaintiff’s shifted burden. (Roberts v. Los
Angeles County Bar Association (2003) 105 Cal.App.4th 604, 614; Karnazes
v. Ares (2016) 244 Cal.App.4th 344, 354 [“pleadings do not constitute
evidence”].)
 
III.      
DISCUSSION

Evidentiary Objections
On January 13, 2025, Robert objected to
portions of the following persons’ declarations, provided in support of Plaintiffs’
opposition: (1) Ludmilla Seletskiy; (2) Melissa Jean Pero; (3) Kelly Gorgone;
and (4) Kamran Hussain.
 
Seletskiy Declaration
Robert’s objections are overruled as to Nos.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Seletskiy was in a romantic relationship with decedent
Mohammed “Mike” Hussain (“Decedent”) since 2001. (Seletskiy Decl. ¶ 2.)
Seletskiy and Decedent were married on January 31, 2022. (Ibid. at ¶ 3.)
Therefore, Seletskiy sets forth adequate foundation regarding her knowledge of ownership
interest of Tires by MAK, Inc., dba Valley Discount Tires (“Valley Discount
Tires”). (See ibid. at ¶ 4 [“I know (of the ownership interest) from tax
filings for the Tire Business].) Additionally, pursuant to Cal. Evid. Code §
1260, “. . . evidence of any of the following statements made by a declarant
who is unavailable as a witness is not made inadmissible by the hearsay rule:
(1) That the declarant has or has not made a will or established or amended a
revocable trust. (2) That the declarant has or has not revoked his or her will,
revocable trust, or an amendment to a revocable trust. (3) That identifies the
declarant’s will, revocable trust, or an amendment to a revocable trust.” (Cal.
Evid. Code § 1260(a).) Where intent is a material element of a disputed fact,
declarations of a deceased made after as well as before an alleged act that
indicate the intent with which he performed the act are admissible in evidence
as an exception to the hearsay rule. (Whitlow v. Durst (1942) 20 Cal.2d
523, 524.) The doctrine that declarations of a decedent’s intent to do an act
are admissible to prove that act thereafter was done is fully accepted in
California. (Casey v. Casey (1950) 97 Cal.App.2d 875, 881.) Therefore,
Seletskiy’s declarations regarding Decedent’s creation or lack of a will, and
circumstances thereof, are admissible under § 1260.
 
Pero, Gorgone, and Kamran Declarations
Robert’s objections to the Pero, Gorgone, and
Kamran declaration are overruled in their entirety for the same reasoning
discussed supra. (See Evid. Code § 1260; Whitlow, supra, (1942)
20 Cal.2d at 524; Casey, supra, (1950) 97 Cal.App.2d at 881.)
 
Prong One: Arising
from Protected Activity
“A
cause of action is subject to a special motion to strike if the defendant shows
that the cause of action arises from an act in furtherance of the defendant’s
constitutional right of petition or free speech in connection with a public
issue and the plaintiff fails to demonstrate a probability of prevailing on the
claim. [Citations.]”  (Digerati
Holdings, LLC v. Young Money Entertainment, LLC (2011) 194 Cal.App.4th 873,
883.) 
“An
‘act in furtherance of a person’s right of petition or free speech under the
United States or California Constitution in connection with a public issue’ is
defined by statute to include ‘(1) any written or oral statement or writing
made before a legislative, executive, or judicial proceeding, or any other
official proceeding authorized by law, (2) any written or oral statement or
writing made in connection with an issue under consideration or review by a
legislative, executive, or judicial body, or any other official proceeding
authorized by law, (3) any written or oral statement or writing made in a place
open to the public or a public forum in connection with an issue of public
interest, or (4) any other conduct in furtherance of the exercise of the constitutional
right of petition or the constitutional right of free speech in connection with
a public issue or an issue of public interest.’[Citation.] If the defendant
shows that the cause of action arises from a statement described in clause
(1) or (2) of [§ 425.16(e)], the defendant is
not required to separately demonstrate that the statement was made in
connection with a ‘public issue.’ [Citation.]” 
(Ibid.)
“A
cause of action is one ‘arising from’ protected activity within the meaning of
section 425.16, subdivision (b)(1) only if the defendant’s act on which the
cause of action is based was an act in furtherance of the defendant’s
constitutional right of petition or free speech in connection with a public
issue. [Citation.] In deciding whether the ‘arising from’ requirement is
satisfied, ‘the court shall consider the pleadings, and supporting and opposing
affidavits stating the facts upon which the liability or defense is based.’ [(CCP
§425.16(b)(2).)] Whether the ‘arising from’ requirement is satisfied depends on
the ‘gravamen or principal thrust’ of the claim. [(Episcopal Church Cases
(2009) 45 Cal.4th 467, 477, quoting Martinez v. Metabolife International,
Inc. (2003) 113 Cal.App.4th 181, 193.)] A cause of action does not arise
from protected activity for purposes of the anti-SLAPP statute if the protected
activity is merely incidental to the cause of action. [(Martinez, 113
Cal.App.4th at pg. 188.)]” (Digerati Holdings, LLC, 194 Cal.App.4th at
pgs. 883-884.) To show that a claim arises from protected activity under
§425.16(b)(1), it is not sufficient to show that the claim “was filed after, or
because of, protected activity, or when protected activity merely provides
evidentiary support or context for the claim.” (Rand Resources, LLC v. City
of Carson (2019) 6 Cal.5th 610, 621.) 
“Rather, the protected activity must ‘supply elements of the challenged
claim.’ [Citation.]”  (Ibid.)
“At
the first step, the moving defendant bears the burden of identifying all
allegations of protected activity, and the claims for relief supported by them.
When relief is sought based on allegations of both protected and unprotected
activity, the unprotected activity is disregarded at this stage.” (Baral
v. Schnitt (2016) 1 Cal.5th 376, 396)(emphasis added.)  
Robert
brings the instant motion on the grounds that Plaintiffs’ cause of action for
wrongful use of civil proceedings arises from Robert’s protected activity, and
that Plaintiffs cannot demonstrate a probability of prevailing on their claim.
(Motion p. 2:4-7.) On June 26, 2023, Robert, the son of decedent, filed a
Petition for Probate of Will and Authorization to Administer Estate (the
“Petition”) in the Los Angeles County Superior Court, Case No. 23STPB05930.
(Robert Decl. ¶¶ 3 and 15; Exh. E [Petition].) Robert did so with the belief
that all signatures on Decedent’s will were valid. (Ibid. at ¶ 15.)
Robert declares that, after filing the petition, he became aware that Kelly
Gorgone’s signature was invalid because Gorgone never witnessed decedent sign
the will. (Ibid.) Thereafter, on June 5, 2024, at Robert’s instruction,
Robert’s counsel filed a request for dismissal of the Petition with prejudice.
(Ibid.; Exh. B [request for dismissal].) Robert was informed and
believes that the Probate Court rejected that filing on technical grounds,
stating that a different format was required. (Ibid. at ¶ 16.)
Accordingly, on June 28, 2024, Robert’s counsel filed a notice of intention to
abandon the Petition. (Ibid.; Exh. C [notice].) On September 11, 2024,
finding that Robert had withdrawn the Petition, the Probate Court denied the Petition
without prejudice. (Ibid. at ¶ 17; Exh. D [Probate Court September 11,
2024, order].)
Plaintiffs filed
the instant action on October 2, 2024, and a FAC on December 2, 2024. (See FAC.)
Plaintiffs’ FAC alleges that Robert, in bad faith, submitted a forged will to
probate. (FAC ¶¶ 23, 25, 28-31.) These allegations serve as the grounds for
Plaintiffs’ first cause of action against Robert for wrongful use of civil
proceedings. (Ibid. at ¶¶ 32-42.)
Filing
a petition for probate of will and authorization to administer estate is a
statutorily protected activity under CCP § 425.16 because such a petition
constitutes a written or oral statement or writing made before a judicial proceeding,
or any other official proceeding authorized by law. (Digerati Holdings, LLC
v. Young Money Entertainment, LLC (2011) 194 Cal.App.4th 873, 883.)
Plaintiffs’ cause of action against Robert for wrongful use of civil
proceedings arises from his filing of the Petition. Therefore, Robert has shown
that this cause of action arises from a protected activity pursuant to CCP §
425.16. The burden now shifts to Plaintiffs to show a probability of prevailing
on their claim for wrongful use of civil proceedings.
 
Second Prong:
Plaintiffs’ Probability of Succeeding
A cause of action
for wrongful use of civil proceedings requires a showing that the defendant
initiated the underlying action with malicious intent, or “motive other than
that of bringing a perceived guilty person to justice or the satisfaction in a
civil action of some personal or financial purpose. [Citation.]” (Soukup v.
Law Offices of Herbert Hafif (2006) 39 Cal.4th 260, 292.) Such malice may
range anywhere from “open hostility to indifference. [Citations.]” (Ibid.)
“Malice may also be inferred from the facts establishing lack of probable
cause.” (Grindle v. Lorbeer (1987) 196 Cal.App.3d 1461, 1465-1466.)
Here,
under their cause of action for wrongful use of civil proceedings, Plaintiffs
allege that “[n]o reasonable person in Defendants[‘] . . . circumstances would
have believed there was reasonable grounds to bear witness to a false will and
bring the Petition for Probate . . . because the Purported Will was fraudulently
obtained after Decedent’s death by Defendants . . .” (FAC ¶ 38.) Additionally,
Plaintiffs allege that Decedent’s signature was forged by Robert with “intent
to take, withhold, and otherwise wrongfully obtain Decedent’s property . . .” (Ibid.
at ¶ 25.) To support these claims, Plaintiffs point to Gorgone’s testimony
that Robert approached her in approximately May or June 2023 and asked that she
sign the will as a witness, and further asked her to back-date her witness
attestation to July 5, 2022, with which Gorgone complied. (Ibid. at ¶
26.) Gorgone states that, after becoming concerned that her signature was given
under false pretenses, she asked Robert to tell her the “truth” about what he asked
her to do. (Gorgone Decl. ¶ 8.) Pero declares that, prior to asking Gorgone,
Robert asked Pero to sign the will as a witness and she refused. (Pero Decl. ¶
7.) Finally, Plaintiffs provide evidence that Decedent’s purported signature on
the will might not actually be his. (See Kahn Decl. ¶¶ 4-7.)
Therefore,
Plaintiffs make a prima facie showing of malice on Robert’s behalf and, in
turn, make a prima facie showing of facts supporting a judgment in their favor.
(Chavez v. Mendoza (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 1087, 1087.) Accordingly,
Plaintiffs meet their burden under the second prong of Bonni, supra, 11
Cal.5th, showing that their claim for wrongful use of civil process has
“minimal merit.” Accordingly, Robert’s motion is denied.
 
Attorney’s Fees
and Costs
Plaintiffs
request attorney’s fees pursuant to CCP §§ 425.16(c)(1) and 128.5. However, Robert’s
motion had merit as his filing of the Petition was protected activity, and the
instant motion was not made “for the sole purpose of harassing an opposing
party.” (See CCP § 128.5(b)(2).) Therefore, the Court declines to award
attorney’s fees or costs.
 
IV.    CONCLUSION
Defendant
Asif “Robert” Hussain’s special motion to strike Plaintiffs’ first cause of
action in their first amended complaint is DENIED.
Moving
party to give notice.
