And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Ford Motor Company's motion to release and reproduce photographs, x-rays, and records related to the deaths of Andrea Bullo and Marco Bullo. Ford argued that it had shown good cause for the order, citing the relevance of the records to the cause of the decedents' deaths and Ford's defenses to the plaintiff's claims. However, the court found that Ford failed to provide proof of service on the District Attorney as required by California Code of Civil Procedure § 129. Despite this, the court did find that Ford showed good cause for the order, but the procedural deficiency was sufficient to deny the motion. The court's decision is tentative and subject to revision after the hearing on January 17, 2025.
