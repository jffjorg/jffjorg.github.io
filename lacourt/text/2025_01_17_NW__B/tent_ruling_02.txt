BACKGROUND
 
On January
28, 2022, Plaintiff Vardui Keshishyan (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against
Defendants PQ New York, Inc. (“PQ”), Le Pain Quotidien (“Le Pain”), and Does 1
to 100, alleging two causes of action: (1) premises liability; and (2) general
negligence. The complaint alleges that, on February 2, 2020, Plaintiff slipped
and fell due to Defendants’ negligence and sustained injuries as a result.
 
On May 31,
2024, the Court held hearings on Order to Show Cause Re: Dismissal for Failure
to File Proof of Service, Order to Show Cause Re: Dismissal for Failure to
Request Entry of Default, and a Trial Setting Conference. (See May 31,
2024, Minute Order.) No parties appeared. (Ibid.) The Court dismissed
the action, without prejudice, pursuant to Cal. Code of Civ. Proc. §§ 581(g)
and 583.410. (Ibid.)
 
On October 18, 2024, Plaintiff filed the
instant motion to set aside/vacate dismissal. The motion remains unopposed.
 
LEGAL STANDARD
 
“Section 473(b) provides for both
discretionary and mandatory relief [from dismissal]. [Citation.]” (Pagnini
v. Union Bank, N.A. (2018) 28 Cal.App.5th 298, 302.) An application for
relief under this section must be made no more than six months after entry of
the judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding from which relief is sought
and must be accompanied by an affidavit of fault attesting to the mistake, inadvertence,
surprise or neglect of the moving party or its attorney. (CCP § 473(b); English
v. IKON Business Solutions (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 130, 143.) Additionally,
an application for relief under this section “shall be accompanied by a copy of
the answer or other pleading proposed to be filed herein, otherwise the
application shall not be granted.” (CCP § 473(b).) Relief under this section is
mandatory when based on an attorney affidavit of fault; otherwise, it is
discretionary. (Ibid.) When dismissal is the attorney’s fault, the
six-month period starts to run from the date of the entry of dismissal. (CCP §
473(b); Sugasawara v. Newland (1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 294, 295.)
 
DISCUSSION
Plaintiff’s counsel claims that dismissal was
entered as a result of their mistake, inadvertence, and excusable neglect. (Aghamalyan
Decl. ¶ 2.) Counsel alleges that their non-appearance at the May 31, 2024, hearing
was due to a calendaring error. (Ibid. at ¶¶ 16, 18-19, and 22.) The May
31, 2024, was an Order to Show Cause Re: Failure to File Proof of Service.
Plaintiff filed proof of service as to Defendants PQ, Dave Barone, and APQ
Americana CA, LLC, on January 26, 2024. (Aghamalyn Decl. ¶ 12; Exh. D [proof of
service].)
Under the
circumstances, the Court finds that Plaintiff’s arguments have merit.  Courts have found excusable neglect where a
counsel calendaring error resulted in dismissal. (Renteria v. Juvenile
Justice, Dept. of Corrections and Rehabilitation (2006) 135 Cal.App.4th
903, 911; Bergloff v. Reynolds (1960) 181 Cal.App.2d 349, 358-359.)
Further, as to all Defendants other than Le Pain Quotidien, proof of service
was filed.  
CONCLUSION
 
Based on the
foregoing, Plaintiff Vardui Keshishyan’s Motion to Set Aside Dismissal is GRANTED.
The Court sets
an OSC Re: Failure to File Proof of Service as to Defendant Le Pain Quotidien
and an OSC re Entry of Default as to the remaining defendants on [date].
