And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling is a summary of the arguments presented by the parties in a lawsuit regarding exposure to hazardous materials. The plaintiffs, Leobardo Segura-Meza and others, are suing the defendants, Agoura Hills Marble and Granite, Inc., and others, for fraudulent concealment and other claims. The defendants have filed demurrers to the plaintiffs' fourth cause of action, alleging that the complaint fails to state a claim for fraudulent concealment, and motions to strike punitive damages.

The court has considered the pleadings and arguments presented by the parties and has ruled that the plaintiffs' fraudulent concealment claim fails as to Francini, Inc. because it does not adequately allege, with specificity, that Francini willfully misstated or concealed material information with the intent to defraud Meza-Segura or that Meza-Segura relied upon any misrepresentation by Francini.

The court has also sustained the demurrers with 20 days leave to amend and granted the motions to strike punitive damages with 20 days leave to amend. The parties are ordered to file an amended complaint within 20 days to cure the defects in the original complaint.
