And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge, Hon. Holly J. Fujie, has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for leave to amend the complaint filed by Plaintiff Tohid Naeem. The motion is deficient on several grounds, including a lack of notice of the hearing, failure to file a proof of service, and failure to file a memorandum of points and authorities. The motion also does not comply with California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1324, which requires a separate declaration specifying the effect of the amendment, why it is necessary and proper, when the facts giving rise to the amended allegations were discovered, and the reasons why the request for amendment was not made earlier. Due to these defects, the Court denies the motion without prejudice. The Court orders the Plaintiff to give notice of this ruling and directs parties who intend to submit on this tentative to send an email to the Court as directed by the instructions provided on the court website.
