And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for terminating sanctions or alternative sanctions against KIPP Foundation and KIPP SoCal Public Schools. The judge also denied the plaintiff's request for additional sanctions against the defendants. The judge found that the defendants had complied in part with the discovery at issue and that the imposition of terminating sanctions would be punitive. The judge took into account the parties' stipulation to produce additional documents and the substitution of new counsel for the plaintiff. The judge concluded that the circumstances did not warrant the imposition of sanctions and that the case should proceed without further action.
