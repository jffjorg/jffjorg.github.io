And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling sustaining the demurrer filed by Nationwide Guard Services (NGS) without leave to amend, and overruling the demurrer by joinder filed by SEKO Worldwide, LLC. The court has taken judicial notice of the records filed in this action and the first amended complaint filed in the lead case. The court has also considered the factual allegations in the complaint and determined that the exclusivity provisions of the Worker's Compensation Act bar Plaintiff's claim against NGS. The court has further determined that SEKO's alleged failure to provide a guard shack free from unsanitary conditions constitutes a form of negligence, but that SEKO does not have a duty to exercise ordinary care in the management of the premises. As a result, the court has ordered SEKO to file its answer within 10 days.
