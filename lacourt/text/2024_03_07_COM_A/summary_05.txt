And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The court has decided to continue the hearing on Cross-Complainant's request for a preliminary injunction to April 9, 2024. The hearing was initially set for March 7, 2024, but the court needs more time to complete the debtor's examination and allow the parties to produce additional evidence. The examination has not yet been completed due to the court reporter's sudden illness, and the transcript is not yet available. The court has ordered the parties to produce documents at the next examination, which will take place on April 9, 2024. The temporary restraining order previously issued remains in full force and effect until the next hearing.
