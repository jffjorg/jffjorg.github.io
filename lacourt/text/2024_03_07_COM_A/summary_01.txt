And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the plaintiff's motion to compel the joinder of Jose Miguel Calvillo and Olga L. Mercado as defendants in this action. The motion is defective because it misapplies the joinder statutes and fails to serve the proposed new defendants with the motion. The defendant has already answered the complaint, and the plaintiff's remedy is to file a motion for leave to file an amended complaint or to amend the complaint as a matter of right. Therefore, the motion is taken off calendar.
