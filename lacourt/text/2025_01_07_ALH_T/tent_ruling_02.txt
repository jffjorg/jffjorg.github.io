 Case Number:  22STCV12147    Hearing Date:   January 7, 2025    Dept:  T Jonathan Cervantes Gonzalez vs Los Angeles County, et al.Motion: Motion for Terminating SanctionsMoving Party: Defendants County of Los Angeles and Deputy Cameron FerminResponding Party: NoneTentative Ruling: GrantBACKGROUNDThis is a negligence action based on a motor vehicle accident. The complaint was filed on April 11, 2022. On June 20, 2024, the Court granted Defendants County of Los Angeles and Deputy Cameron Fermin’s (“Defendants”) motion to compel the deposition of Plaintiff Jonathan Cervantes Gonzalez (“Plaintiff”). Plaintiff was ordered to appear for a deposition and pay $1,153.00 in monetary sanctions within 30 days of the ruling. (Min. Order, 6/20/24.) On June 26, 2024, Defendants served electronic notice of the order on Plaintiff. Defendants now move for terminating sanctions based on Plaintiff’s failure to comply with the June 20, 2024 order. No opposition has been filed. MOVING PARTY POSITION Defendants ask for terminating sanctions because Plaintiff has failed to appear for a deposition.   OPPOSITIONNo opposition was filed. REPLYNo reply was filed.  ANALYSISI. Legal Standard“To the extent authorized by the chapter governing any particular discovery method or any other provision of this title, the court, after notice to any affected party, person, or attorney, and after opportunity for hearing, may impose…sanctions against anyone engaging in conduct that is a misuse of the discovery process.” (Code Civ. Proc. section 2023.030.) The court may impose a terminating sanction for misuse of the discovery process by any of the following: “(1) An order striking out the pleadings or parts of the pleadings of any party engaging in the misuse of the discovery process; (2) An order staying further proceedings by that party until an order for discovery is obeyed; (3) An order dismissing the action, or any part of the action, of that party; (4) An order rendering a judgment by default against that party.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (d).)  Failing to respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery, or disobeying a court order to provide discovery, constitutes a misuse of the discovery process. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subds. (d), (g).) “The trial court may order a terminating sanction for discovery abuse ‘after considering the totality of the circumstances: [the] conduct of the party to determine if the actions were willful; the detriment to the propounding party; and the number of formal and informal attempts to obtain the discovery.’” (Los Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez (2014) 223 Cal. App. 4th 377, 390, quoting Lang v. Hochman (2000) 77 Cal. App. 4th 1225, 1246.)   “Generally, ‘[a] decision to order terminating sanctions should not be made lightly.  But where a violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction.’” (Los Defensores, supra, 223 Cal. App. 4th at p. 390 [citation omitted].)    “Under this standard, trial courts have properly imposed terminating sanctions when parties have willfully disobeyed one or more discovery orders.” (Los Defensores, supra, 223 Cal.App.4th at p. 390 citing Lang, supra, 77 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1244-1246 [discussing cases]; see, e.g., Collisson & Kaplan v. Hartunian (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 1611, 1617-1622 [terminating sanctions imposed (by striking the defendant’s Answer and subsequently granting default judgment) after defendants failed to comply with one court order to produce discovery]; Laguna Auto Body v. Farmers Ins. Exchange (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 481, 491, disapproved on other grounds in Garcia v. McCutchen (1997) 16 Cal.4th 469, 478, n. 4 [terminating sanctions imposed against the plaintiff for failing to comply with a discovery order and for violating various discovery statutes].)  “If that party or party-affiliated deponent then fails to obey an order compelling attendance, testimony, and production, the court may make those orders that are just, including the imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against that party deponent or against the party with whom the deponent is affiliated. In lieu of, or in addition to, this sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against that deponent or against the party with whom that party deponent is affiliated, and in favor of any party who, in person or by attorney, attended in the expectation that the deponent's testimony would be taken pursuant to that order.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (h).) II.  DiscussionHere, Defendants assert that Plaintiff has not appeared for a deposition, and therefore has failed to abide by the June 20, 2024 order. On June 28, 2024, County of Los Angeles served a fourth notice of deposition on Plaintiff pursuant to the order, setting it for July 22, 2024. (Jordan Decl. ¶ 5, Exh. B.) On July 9, 2024, Plaintiff served objections asserting the date was unilaterally set, and that counsel cannot contact Plaintiff despite conducting skip trace searches and contacting family members. (Id., Exh. C.) On July 22, 2024, Plaintiff failed to appear at the deposition and a certificate of non-appearance was obtained. (Id. ¶ 7, Exh. D.) Defendants argue that if Plaintiff’s deposition is not taken, they will be prevented from adequately defending this case. Plaintiff has not opposed this motion and therefore fails to set forth steps to contact Plaintiff, or exactly when they lost contact.  Given that Plaintiff has not contacted his counsel, and has not opposed this motion, the Court deems Plaintiff’s noncompliance to be willful, and also notes that Plaintiff’s failure to participate in this case prejudices Defendants. Moreover, it appears lesser sanctions such as monetary sanctions have not induced compliance. Therefore, the motion for terminating sanctions is granted. RULINGDefendants County of Los Angeles and Deputy Cameron Fermin’s motion for Terminating Sanctions is GRANTED. The complaint as to Defendants County of Los Angeles and Deputy Cameron Fermin is dismissed.
