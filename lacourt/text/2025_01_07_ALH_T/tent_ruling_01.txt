Defendant also seeks monetary sanctions. No opposition has been filed. MOVING PARTY POSITION Defendant asks for an order compelling Plaintiff to appear for a deposition no later than January 16, 2025, and seeks $2,547.36 in monetary sanctions.

Legal Standard“If, after service of a deposition notice, a party to the action . . . , without having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails to appear for examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for inspection any document . . . described in the deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move for an order compelling the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the production for inspection of any document . . . described in the deposition notice.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (a).) “A motion under subdivision (a) [above] shall comply with both of the following: 1. The motion shall set forth specific facts showing good cause justifying the production for inspection of any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the deposition notice. 2. The motion shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040, or, when the deponent fails to attend the deposition and produce the documents, electronically stored information, or things described in the deposition notice, by a declaration stating that the petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire about the nonappearance.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (b).) II.  Discussion A.  Meet and ConferAccording to the declaration of George L. Mallory, after Plaintiff failed to appear at his deposition on November 26, 2024, he sent a meet and confer regarding the non-appearance and requested alternative dates. Plaintiff did not respond. (Mallory Decl. ¶ 8, Exh. 11.) Therefore, the meet and confer requirement is met. B.  Compel DepositionOn August 14, 2024, Defendant served a third amended deposition notice on Plaintiff, set for September 26, 2024. (Mallory Decl. ¶ 6, Exh. 7.) On September 23, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel emailed stating that the deposition would not move forward, but did not provide a reason. (Id. ¶ 7, Exh. 8.) On November 5, 2024, Defendant served a fourth amended deposition notice, set for November 26, 2024. (Mallory Decl. ¶ 7, Exh. 9.) Plaintiff did not serve an objection and failed to appear at the deposition. (Id. ¶ 8.) Defendant obtained a Certificate of Non-Appearance. (Id., Exh. 10.)Therefore, because the evidence shows that Plaintiff did not appear for a noticed deposition, and did not serve objections, the motion to compel is granted. C. SanctionsIf a motion is granted, the court shall impose a monetary sanction in favor of that party unless the court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the sanction unjust. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2025.450 (g).)Defendant seeks $2,547.36 in monetary sanctions against Plaintiff and his counsel, based on a $250 hourly rate for six hours, a $1,031.95 Court Reporter fee for the non-appearance (Exh. 12), and a $15.41 filing fee. (Mallory Decl. ¶ 11.) The Court finds that sanctions are warranted but the amount requested is excessive given the type of motion, lack of opposition, and the fact counsel can appear remotely at the hearing. Therefore, the Court awards sanctions in the reduced amount of $1,797.36 (three hours of attorney time to file and appear at the hearing, the Court Reporter fee, and filing fee). RULINGDefendant County of Los Angeles’ Motion Compelling Attendance of Plaintiff for Deposition is GRANTED. Plaintiff Grant Peter Yahiayan shall appear for a deposition no later than January 24, 2025. The Court further GRANTS $1,797.36 in monetary sanctions against Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s counsel of record, jointly and severally. Said monetary sanctions shall be paid to counsel for Defendant within 30 days.
