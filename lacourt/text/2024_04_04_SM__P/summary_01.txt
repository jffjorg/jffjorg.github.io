And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication filed by the defendants, Volkswagen Group of America, et al. The motion is denied in part and granted in part.

The court finds that the vehicle purchased by the plaintiff, Ferguson, does fall under the definition of a "new vehicle" under the Song-Beverly Act, and therefore, the first four causes of action based on this act are not barred. The court also finds that the defendants' informal dispute resolution (IDR) mechanism does not comply with federal law and therefore, the plaintiff's failure to exhaust this mechanism does not bar the Magnuson-Moss claim.

However, the court grants summary adjudication on the sixth cause of action for negligent repair due to the economic loss rule, as there is no physical or property damage alleged.

The court also denies the defendants' argument that the vehicle is not a "new vehicle" under the SBA, citing Jensen v. BMW North America, Inc. (1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 112, and declines to follow Rodriguez v. FCA US, LLC (2022) 77 Cal.App.5th 209.

The court's tentative ruling is subject to change after considering any further arguments or evidence presented at the hearing on April 4, 2024.
