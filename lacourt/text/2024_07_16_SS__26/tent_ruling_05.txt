ANALYSIS:
 
On April 11, 2024, Defendant City of Whittier (“Defendant
Whittier”) served Request for Production of Documents, Set One, on Plaintiff
Martha Delia Anda (“Plaintiff”). (Motion, Verska
Decl., Exh. A.) Despite a meet and confer effort, Plaintiff has not
served responses to the discovery. (Id. at ¶¶4-9.) Defendant Whittier
filed the instant Motion to Compel Responses to Request for Production of
Documents, Set One, and Request for Sanctions, on May 30, 2024. No opposition
has been filed to date. 
 
Discussion
 
Based on Plaintiff’s failure to serve initial responses to
the discovery, the Motion to Compel Responses to the Request for Production of
Documents, is granted. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300.) There is no requirement
for a prior meet and confer effort before a motion to compel initial responses
can be filed. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300.) Furthermore, the motion can be
brought at any time after the responding party fails to provide the responses.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300.) Therefore, Defendant Ocean Honda is entitled to
an order compelling Plaintiff to serve verified responses to the Request for
Production of Documents, Set One, without objections.
 
Plaintiff’s failure to timely respond constitutes a misuse
of the discovery process. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (d).) Sanctions
are appropriate under Code of Civil Procedure sections 2023.010 and 2023.030
and have been properly noticed. However, the amount sought is excessive for a
simple and unopposed motion. Pursuant to a lodestar calculation, sanctions are
awarded against Plaintiff in the amount of $245.00 based on one hour of
attorney time billed at $245.00 per hour. (Motion, Verska Decl., ¶11.) 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant City of Whittier’s Motion to Compel Responses to Request
for Production of Documents, Set One, and Request for Sanctions is GRANTED. PLAINTIFF MARTHA DELIA ANDA IS TO
SERVE VERIFIED RESPONSES TO THE DISCOVERY REQUESTS, WITHOUT OBJECTIONS, WITHIN
20 DAYS’ SERVICE OF THIS ORDER. PLAINTIFF MARTHA DELIA ANDA AND COUNSEL OF
RECORD ARE ORDERED TO PAY SANCTIONS OF $245.00 TO DEFENSE COUNSEL WITHIN 20
DAYS’ SERVICE OF THIS ORDER.
