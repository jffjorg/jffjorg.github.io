And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant City of Whittier's motion to compel responses to a request for production of documents and request for sanctions is granted. The plaintiff, Martha Delia Anda, is ordered to serve verified responses to the discovery requests without objections within 20 days of service of this order. Additionally, the plaintiff and their counsel are ordered to pay sanctions of $245.00 to defense counsel within 20 days of service of this order. The judge's ruling is based on the plaintiff's failure to serve initial responses to the discovery requests and the defendant's failure to meet and confer with the plaintiff. The judge finds that the plaintiff's failure to comply with the discovery requests constitutes a misuse of the discovery process and that sanctions are appropriate.
