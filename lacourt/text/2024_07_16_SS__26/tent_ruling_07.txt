ANALYSIS: 
 

On April 5, 2024, Plaintiffs Kinberly
Ortiz and Mana Gloria Andrade (“Plaintiffs”), in propria persona, filed the
Complaint in this action against Defendants Kito Robinson Smith (“Defendant
Smith”) and Housing Authority of the City of Los Angeles (“Defendant HACLA”).
Defendant HACLA filed a Notice of Appearance on May 14, 2024, then the instant
Demurrer to the Complaint on June 11, 2024. No opposition has been filed to
date. 
 
Discussion
 
The Demurrer is not accompanied
by a meet and confer declaration as required by Code of Civil Procedure section
430.41. Defendant is admonished that
failing to meet and confer in the future may result in the Demurrer being
placed off calendar. 
 
The Demurrer is brought on three
separate grounds: the Complaint (1) fails to allege facts sufficient to state a
cause of action; (2) is uncertain; and (3) is moot. (Demurrer, p. 1:18-20.) Special
demurrers, however, are not permitted in the limited jurisdiction court. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 92, subd. (c).) Therefore, the Court will not rule on the
demurrer for uncertainty. Nor does the Demurrer cite authority for a demurrer
based on mootness. The memorandum of points and authorities relies on Code of
Civil Procedure section 430.10, which does not state a party may object by
demurrer on the grounds that a pleading is moot. The Demurrer also cites two
cases regarding mootness. Parkford Owners for a Better Community v. County
of Placer (2020) 54 Cal.App.5th 714, 721, however, concerned a motion for
judgment on the pleadings, not a demurrer. Center for Environmental Science,
Accuracy & Reliability v. Department of Water Resources (Cal. Ct. App.,
Feb. 1, 2021, No. C080967) 2021 WL 320814, is an unpublished case that cannot
be cited as legal authority. Therefore, no authority is presented to sustain
the Demurrer on the grounds that the Complaint is moot. The Court accordingly
denies Defendant HACLA’s request for judicial notice, which is directed to the
mootness argument. 
 
Defendant HACLA makes a minimal
argument that the Complaint fails to allege facts sufficient to state a cause
of action because it is “completely incomprehensible and of no legal merit
whatever.” (Demurrer, p. 2:13-20.) The Complaint purports to seek injunctive
relief to prevent Plaintiffs’ eviction from the premises at 1343 E. 114th
Street, Apartment 657, Los Angeles, California. (Compl., p. 1-2.) No other
argument is provided in the Demurrer regarding the sufficiency of Plaintiffs’
allegations for injunctive relief. Therefore, the Demurrer for failure to
allege facts sufficient to state a cause of action is overruled. 
 
The Court, now having now ruled
on the Demurrer to the Complaint, finds it lacks jurisdiction to issue a
judgment in this action. The
limited jurisdiction court lacks jurisdiction to issue the injunctive relief
sought in the Petition. (See Code Civ. Proc., §§ 85, 86.) 
Therefore,
the case is reclassified as an unlimited civil case and transferred to the
Reclassification/Transfer Desk for collection of fees and reassignment of the
case to an Independent Calendar Court. Plaintiffs are ordered to pay the
reclassification fee within ten (10) days.
 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant Housing Authority of the
City of Los Angeles’ Demurrer to the Complaint is OVERRULED.
 
BASED ON THE RELIEF SOUGHT IN THE COMPLAINT, THIS ACTION IS RECLASSIFIED
AS AN UNLIMITED CIVIL CASE AND TRANSFERRED TO THE RECLASSIFICATION/TRANSFER
DESK FOR REASSIGNMENT TO AN INDEPENDENT CALENDAR COURT. PLAINTIFFS KIMBERLY
ORTIZ AND MARIA GLORIA ANDRADE ARE ORDERED TO PAY THE RECLASSIFICATION FEE
WITHIN TEN (10) DAYS.
