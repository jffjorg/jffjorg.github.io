Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion of Westlake Services, LLC (the judgment creditor) to attach the wage earnings and other assets of Rotha Valdovinos, the spouse of Cristian Valdovinos (the judgment debtor). The judgment creditor filed the motion on March 5, 2024, and the court granted a continuance for further briefing. The judgment creditor filed a supplemental declaration on June 28, 2024, which included evidence of Rotha's employment as a packer by Pactiv Corporation. However, the court found that this evidence was not sufficiently timely to support the issuance of an earnings withholding order under Code of Civil Procedure section 706.109. The court noted that Rotha completed a membership application with First California Federal Credit Union in 2021, more than three years ago. The court therefore denied the judgment creditor's motion to attach Rotha's wage earnings and other assets.
