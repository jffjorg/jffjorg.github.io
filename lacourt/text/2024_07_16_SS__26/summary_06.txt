The demurrer was filed on June 11, 2024, and no opposition has been filed to date. The Judge finds that the Complaint does not allege sufficient facts to state a cause of action, as required by law. The Complaint was filed on December 18, 2023, and is in the form of a Judicial Council Form PLD-C-001, which requires the inclusion of factual allegations. However, no such allegations are included in the Complaint, and the defendant has not demonstrated that the Complaint can be amended to include sufficient allegations. The Judge admonishes the defendant for failing to meet and confer before filing the demurrer, as required by law. The demurrer is sustained without leave to amend, and the Court clerk is ordered to notify the parties of the tentative ruling.
