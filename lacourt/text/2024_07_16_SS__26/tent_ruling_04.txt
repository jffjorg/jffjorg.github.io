ANALYSIS:
 
On December 14, 2023, Petitioner Jordan Roberts
(“Petitioner”) filed the instant Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award against
Respondent Carlos Caraccioli (“Respondent”). The Petition was initially set for
hearing on April 18, 2024 but continued the day before to May 14, 2024 with an
order from the Court for Petitioner to give notice to all parties. (Notice Re:
Continuance, 04/17/24.) At the hearing on May 14, 2024, the Court noted the
lack of any proof of service of the Petition and hearing date and continued the
matter to July 16, 2024. (Minute Order, 07/16/24.) On June 25, 2024, Petitioner
filed proof of personal service. 
 
Discussion
 
Confirmation of the arbitration award is sought under Code
of Civil Procedure section 1285, et seq., which states “[a]ny party to an
arbitration in which an award has been made may petition the court to confirm,
correct or vacate the award.  The
petition shall name as respondent all parties to the arbitration and may name
as respondents any other persons bound by the arbitration award.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1285.) “If a
petition or response under this chapter is duly served and filed, the court
shall confirm the award as made, whether rendered in this state or another
state, unless in accordance with this chapter it corrects the award and
confirms it as corrected, vacates the award or dismisses the proceeding.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1286.)
 
A response to a
Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award that seeks to vacate or correct the award
must be served and filed no later than 100 days after the date of the service
of a signed copy of the award on the respondent. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1288.2.)
 
Discussion
 
Service of the Petition and Notice of Hearing
 
Code of Civil
Procedure, section 1290.4 requires that the Petition and Notice of Hearing be
served on Respondent “in the manner provided in the arbitration agreement for
the service of such petition and notice” or “[i]f the arbitration agreement
does not provide the manner in which such service shall be made . . . [s]ervice
within this State shall be made in the manner provided by law for the service
of summons in an action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1290.4, subds. (a), (b).) 
 
Petitioner has not
shown that the parties’ arbitration agreement provides for the manner of
service of the Petition and the Notice of Hearing. It follows that the Petition
and the Notice of Hearing must be served in the manner provided by law for
service of a summons, which is set forth in Code of Civil Procedure sections
415.10 to 415.95. Petitioner has now filed proof of service of the Petition and
the Notice of Continued Hearing Date by personal delivery to Respondent on June
22, 2024. Therefore, the Court finds that service of the Petition and the
Notice of Hearing conforms to Code of Civil Procedure section 1290.4.  
 
Service of the Arbitration Award and Timing of Service
of Petition (CCP §§ 1283.6, 1288, 1288.4)
 
Code of Civil
Procedure section 1283.6 requires that “[t]he neutral arbitrator shall serve a
signed copy of the award on each party to the arbitration personally or by
registered or certified mail or as provided in the agreement.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1283.6.) This requirement may be satisfied by service by the
arbitrator, or upon proper service of the Award with the Petition. (See Murry v. Civil Service Employees Ins. Co. (1967) 254 Cal.App.2d 796, 799-800.) The
arbitration award is accompanied by a proof of service by certified mail dated
April 13, 2023. (Pet., Attachment 8(c), p. 11.)
 
Also, a party seeking a court judgment confirming an
arbitration award must file and serve the petition no more than four years, but
not less than 10 days, after the award is served.
(Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1288, 1288.4.) Petitioner has now demonstrated
compliance with Code of Civil Procedure
sections 1288 and 1288.4.
 
Confirmation of the Arbitration Award
 
An arbitration award
is not directly enforceable until it is confirmed by a court and judgment is
entered.  (Code Civ. Proc. § 1287.6; Jones
v. Kvistad (1971) 19 Cal.App.3d 836, 840.) The court must confirm the award
as made, unless it corrects or vacates the award, or dismisses the
proceeding.  (CCP § 1286; Valsan
Partners Limited Partnership v. Calcor Space Facility, Inc. (1994) 25
Cal.App.4th 809, 818.) Code of Civil Procedure, section 1285.4 states a
petition under this chapter shall:
 
a)     
Set forth the substance of or have attached a copy of
the agreement to arbitrate unless the petitioner denies the existence of such
an agreement.
 
b)     
Set forth the names of the arbitrators.
 
c)     
Set forth or have attached a copy of the award and the
written opinion of the arbitrators, if any.
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1285.4.) The Petition complies with the
above requirements. It sets forth the nature of the arbitration agreement and
the name of the arbitrator. (Pet., ¶4.) A copy of the arbitration award is also
attached. (Id. at Attachment 8(c).) Substantively, the Petition
demonstrates that Petitioner is entitled to an award of $18,532.05 from
Respondent. (Id. at Attachment 8(c), p. 10.) 
 
Attorney’s Fees,
Costs and Interest
 
The interest sought by Petitioner, seven percent per annum
from 30 days after the award was issued (May 13, 2023), is appropriate pursuant
to Civil Code section 3289, subdivision (b).
 
Conclusion
 
Petitioner Jordan Roberts’ Petition to Confirm Arbitration
Award is GRANTED IN THE AMOUNT OF $18,532.05 PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST CALCULATED
AT SEVEN PERCENT PER ANNUM FROM MAY 13, 2023 (30 DAYS AFTER THE AWARD WAS
ISSUED) UNTIL ENTRY OF JUDGMENT. PETITIONER IS TO FILE AND SERVE A PROPOSED
JUDGMENT WITHIN 20 DAYS OF THIS ORDER.
