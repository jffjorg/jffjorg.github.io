And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the demurrer filed by the defendant, Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority, is sustained without leave to amend. The demurrer was filed in response to the plaintiff, Nick Montoya's, complaint alleging general negligence and premises liability. The plaintiff crashed into a dried tree branch on a bike path and suffered injuries, and contends that the bike path is under the care and maintenance of the defendant.

The judge's ruling is based on the Government Claims Act, which requires that a claim for monetary damages against a public entity be presented to the public entity within six months of the accrual of the cause of action. The plaintiff failed to allege facts showing compliance or excuse for noncompliance with this requirement, and therefore the demurrer is sustained. The judge notes that the plaintiff's opposition did not dispute the requirements for stating a claim for monetary damages against a public entity, and that the plaintiff provided no evidence to show that he filed a timely and proper claim with the correct public entity, the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority.
