SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises from an incident that occurred on
7/25/22 where Plaintiff Nick Montoya (Plaintiff) crashed into a dried tree
branch while riding his scooter on a bike path and suffered injuries as a
result.  Plaintiff contends that the bike
path is under the care and maintenance of the Defendant Los Angeles County
Metropolitan Transportation Authority (Defendant).  Plaintiff further contends that Defendant
failed to properly maintain and trim dried branches in order to prevent
injuries to civilians.    
 
On 6/21/23, Plaintiff filed this action against Defendant
for general negligence and premises liability. 
After meet and confer efforts failed to resolve the issues Defendant had
with the complaint, on 7/28/23, Defendant filed and served the instant demurrer
to the entire complaint.  Plaintiff has
opposed the demurrer. 
 
ANALYSIS
 
Under the Government Claims Act, an action for monetary
damages cannot be maintained against a public entity unless a plaintiff has
first presented a written claim to the public entity.  See Government Code 905, 945.4.  Claims involving injury to a person must be
presented to the public entity within six months of the accrual of the cause of
action.  Government Code 911.2(a).  The failure to present a timely and proper
claim to the public entity is fatal to the cause of action.  See City of San Jose (1974) 12
C3d 447, 454; Harman (1982) 131 CA3d 607, 613-614; State of
California (2004) 32 C4th 1234, 1239.
 
The failure to allege facts showing compliance or excuse
for noncompliance with the claim  presentation
requirement is grounds for demurrer based on failure to allege sufficient facts
to state a cause of action.  CCP
430.10(e); State v. Superior Court (Bodde) (2004) 32 C4th 1234, 1239.
Here, Plaintiff’s Judicial Council Form Complaint
concludes that Plaintiff has complied with applicable claims statutes but does
not include any facts to support the allegation of compliance.  (See Complaint ¶9.a).  Defendant requests that the Court dismiss
Plaintiff’s complaint for failure to comply with Government Code 911.2.      
 
In opposition to the demurrer, Plaintiff does not dispute
the foregoing requirements to stating a claim for monetary damages for personal
injuries against a public entity. 
Rather, Plaintiff requests that the 
Court allow his action to proceed because his counsel filed a claim with
the City of Los Angeles, received a denial letter on 12/22/22 and Plaintiff
filed this action on 6/21/23, within six months of the denial.  
 
The denial letter from the City of Los Angeles, which
Plaintiff attaches to the opposition, specifically provides that the principal
reason for the denial of Plaintiff’s claim was “[t]he Los Angeles County
Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) is a separate public entity and not
part of the City of Los Angeles.”  (See
Akari Decl., Ex.1).  The letter even
indicates that the address for the MTA was enclosed.  Id. 

 
Plaintiff offers no evidence to show that he filed a timely
and proper claim with the MTA, the public entity which he has sued in this
action.  Plaintiff also provides no
authority for the proposition that the denial of a claim by one public entity,
the City of Los Angeles, satisfies the condition precedent for filing a court action
against a separate public entity, MTA. 
 
Plaintiff gives no indication as to how he can cure the
defect in his complaint.  
 
CONCLUSION
 
The demurrer is sustained without leave to amend.
