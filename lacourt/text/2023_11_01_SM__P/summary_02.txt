And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to vacate a summary judgment order. Defendant Aarons is seeking to set aside the order, arguing that it was contrary to law and failed to consider all evidence and arguments. The motion re-asserts various arguments previously raised, including claims that the action was subject to a bankruptcy stay and that prior transfers of the note were void. The Judge has previously considered and rejected these arguments, finding that there was no effective bankruptcy stay and that the expert testimony presented was inadmissible. The Judge has also rejected an argument that an assignment of a deed of trust is of no legal effect without the actual transfer of the corresponding promissory note, citing case law from Debrunner v. Deutsche Bank National Trust Co. The Judge has ruled that the motion to vacate is denied and that any further attempts to revisit the arguments will be treated as frivolous and subject to sanctions.
