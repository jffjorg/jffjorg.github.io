Leo Cono v. Mary
Premtaj, Case No. 21SMCV00040 
Hearing Date
November 1, 2023 
Plaintiff Leo Cono’s
Motion
 
Plaintiff’s motion
consists of attachments, including judicial council forms, court reservation
receipts, photographs of US postal service receipts and emails apparently sent
by plaintiff. There is no memorandum of points and authorities, nor does any of
the attachments include a clear request for court action. The court cannot
discern what plaintiff seeks via this motion. As the nature of the motion is
unclear, it is DENIED.
