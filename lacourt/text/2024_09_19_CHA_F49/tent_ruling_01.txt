MOVING PARTY: Defendant AutoNation Ford Valencia
RESPONDING PARTY: Plaintiff Austin Smith 
NOTICE: OK.
 
RELIEF
REQUESTED: An

Plaintiff Austin Smith to provide responses, without objection, to Requests for

TENTATIVE
RULING: The
motion is GRANTED IN PART. The request for monetary sanctions is GRANTED IN
PART.
 
BACKGROUND
 
Plaintiffs Taylor Peacock (“Peacock”) and Austin Smith
(“Smith”) (collectively “Plaintiffs”) brought this action under Song-Beverly
Consumer Warranty Act (Lemon Law), Consumer Legal Remedies Act, and
Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act over alleged defects in their 2020 Ford Expedition
(the “Subject Vehicle”), which was manufactured by Defendant Ford Motor Company
(“FMC”). Plaintiffs entered into a warranty contract with Defendant FMC on or
about December 19, 2020.
 
On January 31, 2023, Plaintiffs initiated this action.
Subsequently, on May 26, 2023, the Department F47 Court sustained a demurrer
filed by Defendant FMC on April 10, 2023.
 
On June 23, 2023, Plaintiffs filed their First Amended
Complaint (“FAC”) against Defendants FMC and AutoNation Ford Valencia
(“AutoNation Ford”), and Does 1 through 10, alleging the following causes of
action: (1) Violation of Subdivision (d) of Civil Code Section 1793.2, (2) Violation of Subdivision (b) of Civil Code Section
1793.2, (3) Violation of Subdivision (a)(3) of Civil Code Section 1793.2, (4)
Breach of Implied Warranty of Merchantability (Civ. Code §§ 1791.1, 1794,
1795.5), (5) Fraudulent Inducement – Concealment, (6) Negligent Repair, (7)
Violation of Consumer Legal Remedies Act (Civ. Code § 1750 et seq.), and (8)
Violation of the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act. The First through Fifth, and
Seventh through Eighth Causes of Action are alleged against Defendant FMC. The
Sixth Cause of Action is alleged against AutoNation Ford. Subsequently, on
December 5, 2023, the Department F47 Court sustained FMC’s demurrer to the
Third and Fifth Causes of Action.
 
On May 6, 2024, AutoNation Ford
filed the instant Motion to Deem the Requests for Admission, Set One, Admitted.
(the “Motion”). 
 
Subsequently, on September 5,
2024, Smith filed his Opposition to the Motion, and AutoNation Ford replied on
September 12, 2024. 
 
ANALYSIS
 
“Any party may obtain discovery . . . by
a written request that any other party to the action admit the genuineness of
specified documents, or the truth of specified matters of fact, opinion
relating to fact, or application of law to fact. A request for admission may
relate to a matter that is in controversy between the parties.”¿ (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.010.)¿ “Within 30 days after service of requests for admission,
the party to whom the requests are directed shall serve the original of the
response to them on the requesting party, and a copy of the response on all
other parties who have appeared ....”¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.250, subd.
(a).)¿
 
If a party to whom request for
admissions is served fails to provide a timely response, the party to whom the
request was directed waives any objections, including based on privilege or the
work product doctrine. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (a).) The requesting
party can move for an order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth
of any matters specified in the request be deemed admitted, as well as for
monetary sanctions. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).) The court shall
issue this order unless the party to whom the request was made serves a
response in substantial compliance prior to the hearing on the motion. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)¿
 
A.   
Motion to Deem
Requests for Admission, Set One, Admitted
 
AutoNation Ford’s counsel
(“Counsel”) attests that on March 7, 2024, Smith was served with the first set
of Requests for Admission. (Geraghty Decl. ¶ 3, Ex. “2.”) Having not received
any responses by the due date, Counsel sent Plaintiff’s counsel a written meet
and confer letter on April 24, 2024, requesting Plaintiff Smith to serve his
responses, without objection, by April 29, 2024. (Id. ¶ 5, Ex. “3.”) On
May 6, 2024, Counsel attempted to contact Plaintiff’s counsel via telephone, but
was unsuccessful.  (Id. ¶ 6.)
Despite these efforts, no responses had been received from Plaintiff Smith at
the time of the filing of the Motion. (Id. ¶ 8.) Subsequently,
Plaintiffs’ counsel served verified discovery responses to AutoNation Ford on
August 28, 2024. (Sanaia Decl. ¶ 8.)
 
Based on the above records,
the Court determines that Smith failed to serve a timely response, thereby
waiving any objection to the interrogatories, including those based on
privilege or the protection for work product, pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 2033.280, subdivision (a). 
 
Nevertheless, under Code of
Civil Procedure section 2033.280, subdivision (a), the court, on motion, may relieve
that party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following
conditions are satisfied: (1) The party has subsequently served a response
that is in substantial compliance with Sections 2033.210, 2033.220, and
2033.230. (2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response was the
result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
 
Here,
Plaintiff Smith’s counsel contends that she was not aware of outstanding
discovery responses, until August 26, 2024, when the opposition to the Motion
became due. (Sanaia Decl. ¶¶ 6, 10.) Plaintiffs made a good faith attempt to
immediately respond to Defendant’s Discovery Requests. (Id. ¶ 7.) “The
reason for this delay is due to a calendaring error. Upon further
investigation, we noticed the deadline to serve Discovery Responses was not
properly calendared. Calendaring Department of Plaintiffs’ Counsel is
responsible for making sure that due dates and deadlines are calendared, and
that Plaintiffs’ attorneys are made aware of these deadlines. Because of this
inadvertent and excusable mistake made by the Calendaring Department,
Plaintiffs failed to respond to Defendant’s discovery requests in a timely
manner.” (Id. ¶ 9.)
 
Established case law holds
that errors such as misreading a calendar do not qualify as excusable neglect
absent extraordinary circumstances. (See Garcia v. Hejmadi (1997) 58
Cal.App.4th 674). Similarly, simple carelessness, lack of diligence, or neglect
without reasonable justification is not excusable. (See Huh v. Wang
(2007) 158 Cal.App.4th 1406 [attorney’s failure to respond to discovery due to
“press of business” did not constitute excusable neglect.]) Additionally, AutoNation
Ford’s counsel sent a written meet and confer letter on April 24, 2024,
alerting that “[a]s of today’s date, my office has not received Plaintiffs’
discovery responses.” (Geraghty Decl. Ex. “3.”) Furthermore, the Motion papers
were served upon Plaintiff’s counsel’s law firm on May 6, 2024. (5/6/2024 Proof
of Service.) Consequently, the Court finds Plaintiff’s argument that the delay
was solely due to calendaring errors to be unpersuasive. 
 
Accordingly, the Court finds that
Plaintiff’s failure to serve a timely response was not the result
of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. Therefore, Plaintiff is not
relieved from the waiver of objections.
 
Based on the above, the Court GRANTS IN PART the Motion,
deeming Plaintiff’s objections asserted in his responses dated August 28, 2024,
waived.
 
Nonetheless, the Court finds
the Plaintiff’s responses, although untimely, were served before the hearing on
the Motion, and are in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220. 
 
Code of Civil Procedure section
2033.280, subdivision (c), provides in pertinent part, “The court shall
make this order [to deem admitted], unless it finds that the party to whom the
requests for admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the
motion, a proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial
compliance with Section 2033.220.”
 
Therefore, the Court DENIES IN
PART the
Motion as to deem the Requests for Admission, Set One, admitted.
 
A.   
Monetary
Sanctions
 
“It is mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction
under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or
both, whose failure to serve a timely response to requests for admission
necessitated this motion.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)
 
Although the Court has denied in part the
Motion to deem Requests for Admission, Set One, admitted, it finds that the
mandatory sanctions under Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.280, subdivision
(c) are still applicable in this case. 
 
Given that the Motion shares significant
similarities with another concurrently filed motion, the Court determines the
total and reasonable amount of attorney’s fees and costs incurred for the work
performed in connection with the Motion to be $435.00, calculated based on a
reasonable hourly rate of $250.00 for 1.5 hours reasonably spent plus a $60.00
filing fee.
 
Therefore, the Court GRANTS IN PART Defendant AutoNation
Ford’s request for monetary sanctions.
 
CONCLUSION
 
Defendant
AutoNation Ford Valencia’s Motion to Deem Admitted Requests for Admission, Set
One, is GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART. Specifically, Plaintiff Austin
Smith’s objections, asserted in her responses dated August 28, 2024, are deemed
waived. However, the genuineness and truth of the matters specified in the
Requests for Admission, Set One, are not deemed admitted.
 
Defendant
AutoNation Ford Valencia’s Request for Monetary
Sanctions is GRANTED IN PART. 
 
Plaintiff
Austin Smith and his attorney of record are ordered to jointly and severally
pay $435.00 to Defendant AutoNation Ford Valencia
within 20 days.

party to give notice.
