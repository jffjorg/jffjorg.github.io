And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment. The plaintiffs, Eileen Carry and Sylvia Merino, are seeking declaratory relief, alleging that the defendants, Boys & Girls Clubs of Santa Monica, Inc., et al., reinstated their tenancy by accepting rent after the remittitur. The defendants argue that their acceptance of rent did not reinstate the tenancy, but the judge finds that they waived enforcement of the forfeiture order by accepting rent for several months after the remittitur. The judge cites Jones v. Della Maria, which holds that a landlord who accepts rent after a notice to quit must be treated as having waived the right to continue the eviction and having established a new tenancy. The judge concludes that the defendants' months-long acceptance of rent reinstated the plaintiffs' tenancy and grants the motion for summary judgment.
