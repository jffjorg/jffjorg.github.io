BACKGROUND
 
This is an action for unpaid rent. Plaintiff Kevin Su sued defendants
Fengyu Wang, Keyi Wang, and Yuxiao Wang on January 13, 2023 for breach of
contract and breach of guaranty. Plaintiff alleges he executed a lease with
Defendant Fengyu Wang on or around November 18, 2020. The remaining defendants
guaranteed Wang’s obligations under the lease. Wang allegedly failed to pay
rent.
 
Plaintiff now moves for an order deeming admitted all matters referred
to in his Requests for Admission (Set One) served on defendant Keyi Wang on
January 27, 2024. 
 
Defendant filed no opposition.
 
ANALYSIS
 
Under Code
of Civil Procedure section 2033.280, subdivision (a), “[i]f a party to whom
requests or admission are directed fails to serve a timely response…[t]he party
to whom the requests for admission are directed waives any objection to the
requests, including one based on privilege or on the protection for work
product[.]”  (Id., §
2033.280(a).)  Where a party fails to
respond to requests for admissions, the propounding party may move for an order
that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in
the requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction.  (Id.,
§ 2033.280 (b).)  The court “shall” grant
a motion to deem admitted the matters specified in the requests for admissions,
“unless it finds that the party to whom the requests for admission have been
directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to
the requests for admission that is in substantial compliance with Section
2033.220.” (Id., § 2033.280(c).) 
 
A. Deemed Admissions
 
Plaintiff’s counsel attests that he served defendant Wang with RFAs on
January 27, 2024, and she failed to timely respond. Defendants filed no
opposition contesting these facts. Plaintiff is entitled to an order deeming
matters admitted.
 
B. Sanctions
 
When deeming matters admitted, “[i]t is mandatory that the court impose
a monetary sanction ... on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to
serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitate [a] motion [under
section 2033.280].” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280(c).)
 
Plaintiff is entitled to sanctions. Counsel attests to a reasonable $900.00
for hours spent working on this motion and $61.65 in costs. The request is
granted. The Court imposes sanctions on Defendant in the amount of $961.65,
payable to Plaintiff and/or his counsel within sixty (30) days of this order.
