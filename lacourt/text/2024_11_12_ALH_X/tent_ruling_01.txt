  Case Number:  22AHCV00842    Hearing Date:   November 12, 2024    Dept:  X DEFENDANT’S
MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
 
Defendant moves for summary judgment
on Plaintiff’s complaint on the grounds that the complaint is barred by the
statute of limitations.
 
Plaintiff’s Complaint asserts a sole cause of action against
Defendant Smith and her law office for legal malpractice in connection with
Defendant Smith’s representation of Plaintiff Vartanyan in two cases: as a
petitioner in a family law divorce case (LASC Case No. 17VEFL00447), and as a
plaintiff in a legal malpractice case LASC Case No. 20STCV47588).  Defendant Smith moves for summary judgment
arguing the legal malpractice Complaint in this matter is time-barred, having
been filed past the limit of one-year for malpractice.
 
Tentative Ruling
 
Defendant Smith’s motion for summary judgment is GRANTED.

Relevant Facts
 
Plaintiff Vartanyan’s instant legal malpractice Complaint
was filed on October 14, 2022.  In it,
Plaintiff Vartanyan alleges that Defendant Smith was negligent in handling two
actions: a family law case (17VEFL00447) and a civil case (20STCV47588).
 
In the family law case (17VEFL00447), Plaintiff Vartanyan
alleges that Defendant Smith failed to exercise reasonable care and skill in
performing legal tasks for Plaintiff Vartanyan when Defendant Smith was her
attorney, between November 2020 to October 8, 2021.  In the civil case (20STCV47588), Plaintiff
Vartanyan alleges that Defendants failed to include all parties in the civil
complaint.
 
On September 20, 2021, Defendant Smith advised Plaintiff Vartanyan
that she would no longer represent Plaintiff Vartanyan with respect to either
the family or civil matters.  (SSUMF
7.)  The letter included the following
language: 
 
Anticipating that you will ask
either to appeal the Court’s ruling or file a motion for reconsideration [with
respect to the Subject Matter], I recommend against either as the likelihood of
a successful appeal is practically nil and there are no grounds for a motion
for reconsideration.  If you want to
explore those options, it will need to be with other counsel.  This office will not file an appeal nor file
a motion for reconsideration.
[…]
If you decide you want to go
forward, you will need to retain new counsel (or you may represent
yourself).  This office will not
represent you at the November 22, 2021 hearing nor will this office undertake
any further action on your behalf (such as preparation of the Income and
Expense declaration).
 
You must let me know of your
decision no later than October 1.  If I
have not heard from you by that date, I will proceed with a motion to be
relieved as counsel which, if granted, you will be representing yourself.
[…]
If you will not authorize me to
dismiss the [malpractice] case, you will need to sign a substitution as I will
no longer represent you in that case.  If
you will not sign a substitution, then I will file a request with the court for
permission to withdraw.  You may also
retain new counsel who can substitute into the case.  But you must let me know your decision by
October 1 as there are deadlines coming up and I will not spend more time on
the case.
[…]
This office can no longer represent
you.
 
(SSUMF 7; Smith Decl., ¶ 7, Exh. 4.)  On October 8, 2021, Plaintiff Vartanyan signed
a substitution of attorney, removing Defendant Smith as her attorney of record
in the family law case (17VEFL00447). 
The substitution of attorney was filed on October 12, 2021.  (SSUMF 9.) 
 
Legal Analysis
 
Defendant Smith’s motion hinges on two theories.  First, that Defendant Smith’s September 20,
2021 letter of withdrawal to Plaintiff Vartanyan unequivocally notified
Vartanyan that Smith would no longer provide any services to Plaintiff Vartanyan
in the divorce case or the civil complaint. 
Therefore, the statute of limitations expired on September 20,
2022.  Second, and at the very least, that
the instant legal malpractice complaint is time-barred and should have been
filed two days earlier, by October 12, 2022, with a year after the date on
which the substitution of attorney in the divorce case was filed with the court.
 
The Attorney-Client Relationship Ended In September 2021;
Plaintiff Vartanyan’s Instant Legal Malpractice Complaint is Time-Barred
 
“The applicable statute of limitations for legal malpractice
claims is section 340.6.”  (Truong v.
Glasser (2009) 181 Cal.App.4th 102, 110.)  Code of Civil Procedure section 340.6 provides that
a malpractice action must be commenced “within one year after the plaintiff
discovers, or through the use of reasonable diligence should have discovered,
the facts constituting the wrongful act or omission....”  (§ 340.6, subd. (a).)  The running of the statute of limitations is
tolled during the time that “[t]he attorney continues to represent the
plaintiff regarding the specific subject matter in which the alleged wrongful
act or omission occurred.”  (Id.,
at subd. (a)(2); see also Beal Bank, SSB v. Arter & Hadden, LLP
(2007) 42 Cal.4th 503, 505 [“Under California law, the statute of limitations
for attorney malpractice claims arising from a given matter is tolled for the
duration of the attorney’s representation of the client in that matter”].)  The tolling is referred to as “the continuous
representation exception.”  (Id.,
at p. 511; Truong v. Glasser, supra, 181 Cal.App.4th at p. 115.)
 
“[T]he
failure to formally withdraw as attorney of record, standing alone, will not
toll the statute of limitations under the rubric of continued
representation.”  (Shapero v. Fliegel (1987) 191
Cal.App.3d 842, 846.)  “[C]ontinuity of
representation ultimately depends, not on the client’s subjective beliefs, but
rather on evidence of an ongoing mutual relationship and activities in
furtherance of that relationship.”  (Worthington
v. Rusconi (1994) 29 Cal.App.4th 1488, 1498.) Where the attorney’s acts are
only “tangentially related to the legal representation” of the client, the
statute is not tolled.  (Von Tott v.
Johnson (1983) 148 Cal.App.3d 608, 613.)  Thus, the specific inquiry is not whether an
attorney-client relationship still exists, but when the representation of the
specific matter terminated.  (Ibid.;
Foxborough v. Van Atta (1994) 26 Cal.App.4th 217.) 
 
Ordinarily, an attorney’s
representation ends “ ‘ “when the client discharges the attorney or consents to
a withdrawal, the court consents to the attorney’s withdrawal, or upon
completion of the tasks for which the client retained the attorney.” ’ ”  (Nguyen v. Ford (2020) 49 Cal.App.5th
1, 13, quoting GoTek Energy, Inc. v. Socal IP Law Grp., LLP (2016) 3
Cal.App.5th 1240, 1246.)  “ ‘ “[I]n the
event of an attorney’s unilateral withdrawal or abandonment of the client, the
representation ends when the client actually has or reasonably should have no
expectation that the attorney will provide further legal services.  [Citations.]  That may occur upon the attorney’s express
notification to the client that the attorney will perform no further services.”
’ ”  (Nguyen, supra, p. 13,
quoting GoTek, supra, 3 Cal.App.5th at p. 1247.)  Clerical and ministerial activity of counsel
or the process of formally withdrawing from proceedings does not constitute
continuing representation.  (GoTek,
supra, 3 Cal.App.5th at p. 1245.) 
 
“After a client has no reasonable expectation that the
attorney will provide further legal services, however, the client is no longer
hindered by a potential disruption of the attorney-client relationship and no
longer relies on the attorney’s continuing representation, so the tolling
should end.”  (Gonzalez v. Kalu (2006) 140 Cal.App.4th 21,
31.)  “The client’s reasonably objective belief controls in all
cases.”  (Flake v. Neumiller & Beardslee (2017) 9 Cal.App.5th
223, 231.)
 
There is no dispute that Plaintiff Vartanyan received
Defendant Smith’s September 20, 2021 letter. 
The clear and unequivocal language in Smith’s letter shows Plaintiff
Vartanyan could not have an objectively reasonable belief that Defendant Smith
continued to represent her in both the family and civil cases.  (See SSUMF 7; Smith Decl., ¶ 7, Exh. 4. [“This
office can no longer represent you”, and “You must let me know of your decision
no later than October 1.  If I have not
heard from you by that date, I will proceed with a motion to be relieved as
counsel.”].)  As such, Defendant Smith
has established that the attorney-client relationship ended no later than
September 21, 2021.  Where the instant
complaint was filed on October 14, 2022, more than a year later, it is
time-barred.
 
Plaintiff’s Opposition Does Not Raise A Triable Issue
 
As Defendant Smith has established the absence of a triable
issue of fact, the burden shifts to Plaintiff Vartanyan to establish that a
triable issue of fact exists.  Plaintiff
opposition does not meet this burden.
 
First, Plaintiff Vartanyan has proffered no new facts in the
separate statement.  Indeed, the facts
are not disputed, except for the date that Plaintiff Vartanyan received the
letter.  The Court considers Plaintiff
Vartanyan’s late-filed response to the Defendant Smith’s separate statement, in
which she asserts that Defendant Smith’s letter was delivered on September 21, 2022,
not September 20.  This fact does not
create a triable issue where Plaintiff Vartanyan’s instant legal malpractice
action was not filed for another few weeks, until October 14, 2022.
 
Second, the Court cannot consider Plaintiff Vartanyan’s
declaration and any facts submitted therein, because it has not been signed
under penalty of perjury.  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2015.5.)
 
Third, even if the Court considers Plaintiff Vartanyan’s
declaration and/or additional facts, Plaintiff Vartanyan has not pled delayed
discovery in her Complaint.  The scope of a
motion for summary judgment is limited to the allegations in the
complaint.  (See Hutton v. Fidelity
National Title Company (2013) 213 Cal.App.4th 486, 493; Jacobs v.
Coldwell Banker Residential Brokerage Co. (2017) 14 Cal.App.5th 438,
443-444 [evidence offered on unpleaded claim, theory or defense irrelevant
because outside scope of pleadings].)  If
plaintiff relies on the discovery rule, the complaint must specifically allege
facts showing “(1) the time and manner of discovery and (2) the inability to
have made earlier discovery despite reasonable diligence.”  (Fox v. Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc.
(2005) 35 Cal.4th 797, 808.)
 
Accordingly, where Plaintiff Vartanyan fails to raise a
triable issue of fact, the motion for summary judgment is granted.
