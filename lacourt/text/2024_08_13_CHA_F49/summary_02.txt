And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the motion of Defendant Karine Smbatian's counsel, Lisa N. Shyer, to be relieved as counsel. The motion was filed on March 6, 2024, and the court continued the hearing due to the absence of the required Judicial Council Form MC-053. On July 1, 2024, Counsel filed the instant motion to be relieved as counsel, citing a complete breakdown in communication rendering it impossible to carry out the representation. The court has reviewed the motion and supporting documents and finds Counsel's reasons for seeking relief to be satisfactory. The motion is granted, and Counsel is relieved as counsel for Defendant Karine Smbatian.
