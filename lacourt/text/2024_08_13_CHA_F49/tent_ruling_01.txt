MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER
RESPONSES AND FURTHER PRODUCTION TO FIRST SET OF DEMANDS FOR INSPECTION AND
COPYING OF DOCUMENTS; REQUEST FOR SANCTIONS [3129]

Los Angeles Superior
Court Case No. 22CHCV00784

 
Motion
filed: 5/10/24
 
MOVING PARTY: Defendant Macaria Beltran
RESPONDING PARTY: None.
NOTICE: OK.
 
RELIEF
REQUESTED: An
order compelling Plaintiff to produce supplemental responses and production to Defendant’s
first set of Demands for Inspection and Copying of Documents, and imposing
monetary sanctions against Plaintiff and Grant/Shenon, A Professional Law
Corporation, in the amount of $1,635.00.
 
TENTATIVE
RULING: The
motion is GRANTED. The request for monetary sanctions is GRANTED IN PART.
 
BACKGROUND
 
Plaintiff Patrick Graham (“Plaintiff” or “Graham”) initiated
this action on September 26, 2022. Subsequently, on December 12, 2022,
Plaintiff filed his operative First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) against Defendant
Macaria Beltran (“Beltran” or “Defendant”), individually and as trustee of The
MCB Trust, and Does 1 to 10, alleging the following causes of action: (1)
Fraud; (2) Negligent Misrepresentation; and (3) Specific Performance. Defendant
filed an Answer to the FAC on January 11, 2023. 
 
On May 10, 2024, Plaintiff filed a Substitution of Attorney
with the Court, substituting himself for his former counsel, Grant/Shenon, A
Professional Law Corporation. (5/10/24 Substitution of Attorney.)
 
On the same day, May 10, 2024, Defendant filed the instant
Motion to Compel Further Responses and Further Production to First Set of
Demands for Inspection and Copying of Documents (the “Motion”). 
 
Subsequently, on July 12, 2024, Defendant submitted Proof of
Service, demonstrating that motion papers were served on the self-representing
Plaintiff Graham.
 
No Opposition or Reply papers have been received by the
Court.
 
ANALYSIS
 
“On receipt of a response to a demand for
inspection, copying, testing, or sampling, the demanding party may move for an
order compelling further response to the demand if the demanding party deems
that … [a] statement of compliance with the demand is incomplete[;] … [a]
representation of inability to comply is inadequate, incomplete, or evasive[;
or] … [a]n objection in the response is without merit or too
general.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (a).) The motion must
set forth specific facts showing good cause justifying the discovery sought by
the demand, and both the motion and opposition must be accompanied by a
separate statement or attorney declaration providing a concise outline of the
discovery requests at issue and each response in dispute. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (b).) 
 
A.   
Procedural
Requirements 
 
1.     
Timeliness
 
A motion to compel further
responses to requests for production must be brought within 45 days of service
of the verified response, supplemental verified response, or on a date to which
the propounding and responding parties have agreed to in writing; otherwise,
the propounding party waives the right to compel further responses. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (c); but see Golf & Tennis Pro Shop, Inc. v.
Superior Court (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 127, 134-136 [suggesting that the
45-day deadline does not apply to (i.e., it does not begin to run with service
of) objections-only responses; it only applies to responses that are required
to be verified].)
 
Here, Graham’s written responses were
served by email on February 14, 2024, (Block Decl. ¶ 4, Ex. “B.”) The service
of written responses establishes the deadline for Defendant to file a motion to
compel further as April 4, 2024, calculated based on a 45-day time period with
an extension of two court days per Code of Civil Procedure section 1010.6,
subdivision (a)(3)(B), which accounts for the method of electronic service.
 
However, the Motion was initially served and filed on May
10, 2024, thereby missing the established deadline. Nevertheless, Graham’s
responses are deemed to be objections-only, with no documents produced. (Block
Decl. ¶ 4.) In Golf & Tennis Pro Shop, Inc. v. Superior Court,
supra, the Court of Appeal held that the 45-day time period to file a
motion to compel further responses to interrogatories does not begin to run
upon service of a combination of unverified factual responses and objections,
where the motion challenges only the objections. (Id. at p. 127.) The
Court notes that this legal principle also applies to Demands for Inspection
and Production.
 
Accordingly, the Court determines
that the 45-day time period has not begun, as Plaintiff’s response to the
Demands for Inspection and Copying of Documents was objection-only and unverified.
 
Therefore, the Motion is deemed timely.
 
2.      Meet
and Confer 
“A motion [to compel further
responses to requests for production] shall be accompanied by a meet and confer
declaration under Section 2016.040.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.290, subd.
(b)(1).)
Here, Beltran has
satisfied the meet and confer requirement. (Block Decl., ¶ 7, Ex. “E” and
“F.”).
3.      Separate
Statement
 
The California Rules of Court rule
3.1345 (a)(2) explicitly states that “Any motion involving the content of a
discovery request or the responses to such a request must be accompanied by a
separate statement. The motions that require a separate statement include a
motion: ... (3)  To compel further responses to a demand for inspection of
documents or tangible things[.]” “A separate
statement is a separate document filed and served with the discovery motion
that provides all the information necessary to understand each discovery
request and all the responses to it that are at issue.” (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.1345(c).)
 
Here, Beltran has fulfilled the
requirement by concurrently filing a separate statement with the Motion.
 
B.    
Motion to
Compel Further Responses and Production
 
1)     
Requests at
Issue
 
Defendant asserts that
Plaintiff’s responses to all Demands for Inspection and Copying of Documents
(“Demand”) are insufficient.
 
Demand
No. 1: “All DOCUMENTS and COMMUNICATIONS between YOU,
DEFENDANT, or any third party, which YOU believe form the
basis for a valid
purchase or sale contract for the PROPERTY.”
 
Demand
No. 2: “All DOCUMENTS or COMMUNICATIONS between YOU and
DEFENDANT in which DEFENDANT agreed to sell you the
PROPERTY.”
 
Demand
No. 3: “All DOCUMENTS or COMMUNICATIONS which reference an agreed purchase
price between YOU and DEFENDANT for the sale of the PROPERTY.”
 
Demand
No. 4: “All DOCUMENTS or COMMUNICATIONS which specify any terms
or conditions between YOU and DEFENDANT for the sale of the
PROPERTY.”
 
Demand
No. 5: “All of YOUR bank statements from January 1, 2020 through the
date of
this request.”
 
Demand
No. 6: “Any and all credit reports obtained by YOU or YOUR behalf
including
but not limited to those concerning or relating to this
PROPERTY or any other any other loan or credit application from January 1, 2020
through the date of this request.”
 
Demand
No. 7: “Any and all DOCUMENTS or COMMUNICATIONS between you and
any lender concerning or relating to the purchase of the
PROPERTY or any other
property from January 1, 2020 through the date of this
request.”
 
Demand
No. 8: “Any and all DOCUMENTS or COMMUNICATIONS evidencing any
loan applications made by YOU in connection with the
purchase of this PROPERTY or
any other property (real or personal) from January 1, 2020
through the date of this
request,”
 
Demand
No. 9: “Any and all DOCUMENTS or COMMUNICATIONS evidencing any
commitment letters, pre-approvals, or loan approvals between
YOU and any lender,
concerning or relating to this PROPERTY or any other
property (real or personal) from
January 1, 2020 through the date of this request.”
 
Demand
No. 10: “Any DOCUMENTS which YOU believe evidence your financial
ability to purchase the PROPERTY.”
 
Demand
No. 11: “ALL DOCUMENTS which YOU intend to use at the time of trial.”
 
(Block Decl. Ex. “B.”)
 
2)     
Moving Party’s
Showing of Good Cause
 
A motion to compel further
responses to requests for production shall “set forth specific facts showing
good cause”. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd., (b)(1).) To establish “good
cause,” the moving party must show (1) the items demanded are relevant to the
subject matter and (2) specific facts justify discovery of the requested items
(e.g., why such information is necessary for trial preparation or to prevent
surprise at trial). (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd., (b)(1); see Glenfed
Develop. Corp. v. Superior Court (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 1113, 1117 (Glenfed).)
If “good cause” is shown by the moving party, the burden is then on the
responding party to justify any objections made to document disclosure. (Kirkland
v. Superior Court (2002) 95 Cal.App.4th 92, 98.)
 
 
Here, Defendant’s counsel attests,
“Each of the categories of the Demand are directly tied to Plaintiff’s claims
in this action. Every document sought is available from no other source. The
documents to be produced will be used as evidence at trial, as well as to
discovery potentially other evidence. The documents will also be used to
prepare for trial and to evaluate any settlement proposals.” (Block Decl. ¶ 6.)
 
The Court
finds that Demands are demonstrated to be directly relevant. The documents
sought by Demands are supported by good cause and are necessary for trial
preparation.
 
Accordingly,
the Court determines that Defendant has satisfied his burden in establishing
good causes for Demands for Inspection and Copying of Documents.
 
3)      Opposing Party’s Justification of Objections
 
“If
the responding party objects to the demand for inspection, copying, testing, or
sampling of an item or category of item, the response shall do both of the
following: (1) Identify with particularity any document, tangible thing,
land, or electronically stored information falling within any category of item
in the demand to which an objection is being made. (2) Set forth clearly
the extent of, and the specific ground for, the objection. If an objection is
based on a claim of privilege, the particular privilege invoked shall be
stated. If an objection is based on a claim that the information sought is
protected work product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 2018.010), that
claim shall be expressly asserted. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.240, subd. (b).)
 
“If an objection is based on a
claim of privilege or a claim that the information sought is protected work
product, the response shall provide sufficient factual information for other
parties to evaluate the merits of that claim, including, if necessary, a
privilege log.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.240, subd. (c)(1).)
 
Here, Plaintiff
has not filed an Opposition to the Motion, thereby waiving any issues and
failing to meet the burden in justifying his objections. Consequently, the
Court considers Plaintiff’s objections to be without merit. Additionally,
Plaintiff’s responses do not specifically identify any document to which an
objection is being made. Furthermore, Plaintiff has not provided sufficient
factual information for the demanding party to evaluate the merits of any claims
for protection under privilege. 
 
            Accordingly,
the Court GRANTS the Motion. 
 
C.   
Monetary
Sanctions
 
Beltran also requests the imposition of monetary
sanctions in the amount of $1,635.00, against Plaintiff and his former attorney
of record, Grant/Shenon, A Professional Law Corporation, under Code of Civil
Procedure section 2031.310, subdivision (h).
 
Although Grant/Shenon, A Professional Law Corporation,
has been substituted out as counsel for Plaintiff, the initial responses to
Defendants’ Demand were provided during its period of representation. This
justifies the request for monetary sanctions against the firm as Plaintiff’s former
counsel of record. 
 
Utilizing a lodestar approach, and
in view of the totality of the circumstances, the Court finds that the total
and reasonable amount of attorney’s fees and costs incurred for the work in
preparing the Motion is $960.00, calculated at a reasonable hourly rate of
$450.00 for two hours reasonably spent, in addition to $60.00 for filing fees. 
 
CONCLUSION
 
Defendant
Macaria Beltran’s Motion to Compel Further Responses and Production to Demands
for Inspection and Copying of Documents, Set One, is GRANTED.
 
Plaintiff
Patrick Graham is ordered to provide further responses and production to
Defendant’s Demands for Inspection and Copying of Documents, Set One, within 30
days.
 
Defendant
Macaria Beltran’s Request for Monetary Sanctions is GRANTED IN PART.
 
Plaintiff
Patrick Graham and Grant/Shenon, A Professional Law Corporation, are
ordered, jointly and severally, to pay $960.00 to Defendant Macaria Beltran.

Los Angeles Superior

Motion
filed: 5/10/24
 
MOVING PARTY: Defendant Macaria Beltran
RESPONDING PARTY: None.
NOTICE: OK.
 
RELIEF
REQUESTED: An
order compelling Plaintiff to produce supplemental responses to Defendant’s
first set of Special Interrogatories, and imposing monetary sanctions against Plaintiff
and Grant/Shenon, A Professional Law Corporation, in the amount of $1,635.00.
 
TENTATIVE
RULING: The
motion is GRANTED. The request for monetary sanctions is GRANTED IN PART.
 
BACKGROUND
 
Plaintiff Patrick Graham (“Plaintiff” or “Graham”) initiated
this action on September 26, 2022. Subsequently, on December 12, 2022, Plaintiff
filed his operative First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) against Defendant Macaria
Beltran (“Beltran” or “Defendant”), individually and as trustee of The MCB

(2) Negligent Misrepresentation; and (3) Specific Performance. Defendant filed his

On May 10, 2024, Plaintiff filed a Substitution of Attorney
with the Court, substituting himself for his former counsel, Grant/Shenon, A
Professional Law Corporation. (5/10/24 Substitution of Attorney.)
 
On the same day, May 10, 2024, Defendant filed the instant
Motion to Compel Further Responses First Set of Special Interrogatories (“SROGs”)
(the “Motion”). 
 
Subsequently, on July 12, 2024, Defendant submitted Proof of
Service, demonstrating that motion papers were served on the self-representing
Plaintiff Graham.
 
No Opposition or Reply papers have been received by the
Court.
 
ANALYSIS
 
“On receipt of a response to interrogatories, the
propounding party may move for an order compelling a further response if the
propounding party deems that any of the following apply: (1) An answer to a
particular interrogatory is evasive or incomplete. (2) An exercise of the
option to produce documents under Section 2030.230 is unwarranted or the
required specification of those documents is inadequate. (3) An objection to an
interrogatory is without merit or too general.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd.
(a).)
 
A.   
Procedural
Requirements 
 
1.     
Timeliness
 
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.300,
subdivision (c), notice of this motion must be given within 45 days following
the service of the verified response, or any supplemental verified response, or
by a later date agreed-upon in writing, failing which the propounding party
waives any right to compel a further response to the interrogatories. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (c); but see Golf & Tennis Pro Shop, Inc.
v. Superior Court (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 127, 134-136 [suggesting that the
45-day deadline does not apply to (i.e., it does not begin to run with service
of) objections-only responses; it only applies to responses that are required
to be verified].)
 
The 45-day deadline “is ‘jurisdictional’
in the sense that it renders the court without authority to rule on motions to
compel other than to deny them.” (Sexton v. Superior Court (1997) 58
Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410.)
 
Here, Graham’s written responses were
served by email on February 14, 2024, (Block Decl. ¶ 4, Ex. “B.”) The service
of written responses establishes the deadline for Defendant to file a motion to
compel further as April 4, 2024, calculated based on a 45-day time period with
an extension of two court days per Code of Civil Procedure section 1010.6,
subdivision (a)(3)(B), which accounts for the method of electronic service.
 
However, the Motion was initially served and filed on May
10, 2024, thereby missing the established deadline. Nevertheless, Graham’s
responses are deemed to be objections-only, with no factual responses and
unverified. (Block Decl. Ex. “B.”) In Golf & Tennis Pro Shop, Inc. v.
Superior Court, supra, the Court of Appeal held that the 45-day time
period to file a motion to compel further responses to interrogatories does not
begin to run upon service of a combination of unverified factual responses and
objections, where the motion challenges only the objections. (Id. at p.
127.) 
 
Consequently, in alignment with the precedent set in Golf
& Tennis Pro Shop, Inc. v. Superior Court, the Court determines that
the 45-day time period has not begun, as Plaintiff’s response to the Special
Interrogatories, Set One, was objection-only and unverified.
 
Therefore, the Motion is deemed timely.
 
2.      Meet
and Confer 
 
“A motion under subdivision (a) shall be
accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (b)(1).) “A meet and confer declaration in
support of a motion shall state facts showing a reasonable and good faith
attempt at an informal resolution of each issue presented by the motion.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2016.040.) 
 
Here, Beltran has satisfied the meet and
confer requirement. (Block Decl., ¶ 5, Ex. “C” and “D.”)
 
3.      Separate
Statement
 
The California Rules of Court rule
3.1345 (a)(2) explicitly states that “Any motion involving the content of a
discovery request or the responses to such a request must be accompanied by a
separate statement. The motions that require a separate statement include a
motion: ... (2) To compel further responses to interrogatories[.]” “A separate
statement is a separate document filed and served with the discovery motion
that provides all the information necessary to understand each discovery
request and all the responses to it that are at issue.” (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.1345(c).)
 
Here, Beltran has fulfilled the
requirement by concurrently filing a separate statement with the Motion.
 
B.    
Motion to
Compel Further Responses to SROGs
 
A party may use interrogatories to request the
identity and location of those with knowledge of discoverable matters. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2030.010.) To show an interrogatory seeks relevant, discoverable
information “is not the burden of [the party propounding interrogatories]. As a
litigant, it is entitled to demand answers to its interrogatories, as a matter
of right, and without a prior showing, unless the party on whom those
interrogatories are served objects and shows cause why the questions are not
within the purview of the code section.” (Williams
v. Superior Court (2017) 3 Cal.5th 531,.541, citing West Pico Furniture
Co. v. Superior Court (1961) 56 Cal.2d 407, 422.)
 
In her Motion, Defendant argues that this civil action stems
from Plaintiff’s allegations in the Complaint that Defendant agreed to sell
Plaintiff certain real property, and “[t]he interrogatory is directly relevant
to the issues raised by Plaintiff in the Complaint, and merely providing the
information imposes no undue burden.” (Def.’s Separate Statement (“SS”), at p. 5.)
 
Plaintiff’s responses, however,
contain mostly blanket and boilerplate objections, stating, “Plaintiff objects that the
request is overbroad, unduly burdensome, oppressive, and harassing insomuch as
it is disproportionate to the needs of the case and to the extent that it seeks
information that is already in Plaintiff’s possession. Plaintiff further
objects to the request as it is vague and ambiguous, not reasonably
particularized, and to the extent it seeks information not within Plaintiff's
possession, custody, or control. Plaintiff further objects to the request as it
is not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.
Responding Party further objects on the ground of attorney-client privilege and
the attorney work-product doctrine. Responding Party further objects that this
request is overbroad as to time and scope. Responding Party further objects
this request to the extent that it seeks to violate privacy rights.” (See
generally Block Decl. Ex. “B.”)
 
The Court finds Plaintiff’s blanket and
boilerplate objections to be without merit. A responding party generally may not respond to interrogatories
just by asserting its “inability to respond.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.220 [responding party who
“does not have personal knowledge sufficient to respond fully” to interrogatory
may so state, but must “make a reasonable and good faith effort to obtain the
information by inquiry to other natural persons or organizations,” unless the
information is “equally available to the propounding party.”]) Here, Plaintiff’s responses do not
state that he was unable to respond or that he did not have personal knowledge
sufficient to respond fully. Thus, Plaintiff is required to respond to the discovery
based on the information known to him.
 
Additionally, privacy concerns are not absolute; “they
must be balanced against other important interests....¿Invasion of a privacy
interest is not a violation of the state constitutional right to privacy if the
invasion is justified by a competing interest. Legitimate interests derive from
the legally authorized and socially beneficial activities of government and
private entities.” (Hill v. National Collegiate Athletic Assn. (1994) 7
Cal.4th 1, 37-38.) 
 
Here, Plaintiff’s responses fail to identify a legally protected
privacy right in which he has a reasonable expectation of privacy and the
threatened invasion of which is serious rather than trivial. Given that the
Court has previously found that the interrogatories are directly relevant to
the issues raised in the Complaint, it determines that Plaintiff’s objections
have failed to demonstrate that a balancing test could tip toward any potential
invasion of privacy when weighed against the competing public interests of
obtaining just results in litigation.
 
Furthermore, Plaintiff’s other objections based on vagueness,
ambiguity, and overbreadth, without the support of factual showing or legal
analysis, do not overcome the Court’s previous determination that the
interrogatories are relevant and specific.
 
Lastly, Plaintiff has not filed an Opposition to the Motion,
thereby waiving any issues and failing to meet the burden in justifying his
objections. Consequently, the Court considers Plaintiff’s objections to be
without merit.
 
Accordingly, the Court GRANTS
the Motion to Compel Further Responses to Special Interrogatories, Set One.
 
C.   
Monetary
Sanctions
 
Beltran also requests the imposition of monetary
sanctions in the amount of $1,635.00, against Plaintiff and his former attorney
of record, Grant/Shenon, A Professional Law Corporation, under Code of Civil
Procedure section 2030.300.
 
Although Grant/Shenon, A Professional Law Corporation,
has been substituted out as counsel for Plaintiff, the initial responses to
Defendant’s Special Interrogatories were provided during its period of
representation. This justifies the request for monetary sanctions against the
firm as Plaintiff’s former counsel of record. 
 
Utilizing a lodestar approach, and in view of the totality
of the circumstances, the Court finds that the total and reasonable amount of
attorney’s fees and costs incurred for the work in preparing the Motion is
$960.00, calculated at a reasonable hourly rate of $450.00 for two hours
reasonably spent, in addition to $60.00 for filing fees. 
 
CONCLUSION
 
Defendant
Macaria Beltran’s Motion to Compel Further Responses to Special Interrogatories,
Set One, is GRANTED.
 
Plaintiff
Patrick Graham is ordered to provide supplemental responses to Defendant’s Special
 Interrogatories, Set One, within 30 days.
 
Defendant
Macaria Beltran’s Request for Monetary Sanctions is GRANTED IN PART.
 
Plaintiff
Patrick Graham and Grant/Shenon, A Professional Law Corporation, are ordered,
jointly and severally, to pay $960.00 to Defendant Macaria Beltran.Moving

Los Angeles Superior
Court Case No. 22CHCV00784
 Motion
filed: 5/10/24 MOVING PARTY: Defendant Macaria BeltranRESPONDING PARTY: None.NOTICE: OK. RELIEF
REQUESTED: An
order compelling Plaintiff to produce supplemental responses to Defendant’s
first set of Form Interrogatories, and imposing monetary sanctions against Plaintiff
and Grant/Shenon, A Professional Law Corporation, in the amount of $1,635.00. TENTATIVE
RULING: The
motion is GRANTED. The request for monetary sanctions is GRANTED IN PART. BACKGROUND Plaintiff Patrick Graham (“Plaintiff” or “Graham”) initiated
this action on September 26, 2022. Subsequently, on December 12, 2022, Plaintiff
filed his operative First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) against Defendant Macaria
Beltran (“Beltran” or “Defendant”), individually and as trustee of The MCB
Trust, and Does 1 to 10, alleging the following causes of action: (1) Fraud;
(2) Negligent Misrepresentation; and (3) Specific Performance. Defendant filed his
Answer to the FAC on January 11, 2023.  On May 10, 2024, Plaintiff filed a Substitution of Attorney
with the Court, substituting himself for his former counsel, Grant/Shenon, A
Professional Law Corporation. (5/10/24 Substitution of Attorney.) On the same day, May 10, 2024, Defendant filed the instant
Motion to Compel Further Responses First Set of Form Interrogatories (“FROGs”) (the
“Motion”).  Subsequently, on July 12, 2024, Defendant submitted Proof of
Service, demonstrating that motion papers were served on the self-representing
Plaintiff Graham. No Opposition or Reply papers have been received by the
Court. ANALYSIS “On receipt of a response to interrogatories, the
propounding party may move for an order compelling a further response if the
propounding party deems that any of the following apply: (1) An answer to a
particular interrogatory is evasive or incomplete. (2) An exercise of the
option to produce documents under Section 2030.230 is unwarranted or the
required specification of those documents is inadequate. (3) An objection to an
interrogatory is without merit or too general.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd.
(a).) A.   
Procedural
Requirements  1.     
Timeliness Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.300,
subdivision (c), notice of this motion must be given within 45 days following
the service of the verified response, or any supplemental verified response, or
by a later date agreed-upon in writing, failing which the propounding party
waives any right to compel a further response to the interrogatories. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (c); but see Golf & Tennis Pro Shop, Inc.
v. Superior Court (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 127, 134-136 [suggesting that the
45-day deadline does not apply to (i.e., it does not begin to run with service
of) objections-only responses; it only applies to responses that are required
to be verified].) The 45-day deadline “is ‘jurisdictional’
in the sense that it renders the court without authority to rule on motions to
compel other than to deny them.” (Sexton v. Superior Court (1997) 58
Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410.) Here, Graham’s written responses were
served by email on February 14, 2024, (Block Decl. ¶ 4, Ex. “B.”) The service
of written responses establishes the deadline for Defendant to file a motion to
compel further as April 4, 2024, calculated based on a 45-day time period with
an extension of two court days per Code of Civil Procedure section 1010.6,
subdivision (a)(3)(B), which accounts for the method of electronic service. However, the Motion was initially served and filed on May
10, 2024, thereby missing the established deadline. Nevertheless, Graham’s
responses are deemed to be objections-only, with no factual responses and
unverified. (Block Decl. Ex. “B.”) In Golf & Tennis Pro Shop, Inc. v.
Superior Court, supra, the Court of Appeal held that the 45-day time
period to file a motion to compel further responses to interrogatories does not
begin to run upon service of a combination of unverified factual responses and
objections, where the motion challenges only the objections. (Id. at p.
127.)  Consequently, in alignment with the precedent set in Golf
& Tennis Pro Shop, Inc. v. Superior Court, the Court determines that
the 45-day time period has not begun, as Plaintiff’s response to the Form
Interrogatories, Set One, was objection-only and unverified. Therefore, the Motion is deemed timely. 2.      Meet
and Confer  “A motion under subdivision (a) shall be
accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (b)(1).) “A meet and confer declaration in
support of a motion shall state facts showing a reasonable and good faith
attempt at an informal resolution of each issue presented by the motion.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2016.040.)  Here, Beltran has satisfied the meet and
confer requirement. (Block Decl., ¶ 5, Ex. “C” and “D.”) 3.      Separate
Statement The California Rules of Court rule
3.1345 (a)(2) explicitly states that “Any motion involving the content of a
discovery request or the responses to such a request must be accompanied by a
separate statement. The motions that require a separate statement include a
motion: ... (2) To compel further responses to interrogatories[.]” “A separate
statement is a separate document filed and served with the discovery motion
that provides all the information necessary to understand each discovery
request and all the responses to it that are at issue.” (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.1345(c).) Here, Beltran has fulfilled the
requirement by concurrently filing a separate statement with the Motion. B.    
Motion to
Compel Further Responses to FROGs A party may use interrogatories to request the
identity and location of those with knowledge of discoverable matters. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2030.010.) To show an interrogatory seeks relevant, discoverable
information “is not the burden of [the party propounding interrogatories]. As a
litigant, it is entitled to demand answers to its interrogatories, as a matter
of right, and without a prior showing, unless the party on whom those
interrogatories are served objects and shows cause why the questions are not
within the purview of the code section.” (Williams
v. Superior Court (2017) 3 Cal.5th 531,.541, citing West Pico Furniture
Co. v. Superior Court (1961) 56 Cal.2d 407, 422.) In her Motion, Defendant argues that this civil action stems
from Plaintiff’s allegations in the Complaint that Defendant agreed to sell
Plaintiff certain real property, and “[t]he interrogatory is directly relevant
to the issues raised by Plaintiff in the Complaint, and merely providing the
information imposes no undue burden.” (Def.’s Separate Statement (“SS”), at p. 4.) Plaintiff’s responses, however,
contain mostly blanket and boilerplate objections, stating, “Plaintiff objects that the
request is overbroad, unduly burdensome, oppressive, and harassing insomuch as
it is disproportionate to the needs of the case and to the extent that it seeks
information that is already in Plaintiff’s possession. Plaintiff further
objects to the request as it is vague and ambiguous, not reasonably
particularized, and to the extent it seeks information not within Plaintiff's
possession, custody, or control. Plaintiff further objects to the request as it
is not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.
Responding Party further objects on the ground of attorney-client privilege and
the attorney work-product doctrine. Responding Party further objects that this
request is overbroad as to time and scope. Responding Party further objects
this request to the extent that it seeks to violate privacy rights.” (See
generally Block Decl. Ex. “B.”) The Court finds Plaintiff’s blanket and
boilerplate objections to be without merit. A responding party generally may not respond to interrogatories
just by asserting its “inability to respond.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.220 [responding party who
“does not have personal knowledge sufficient to respond fully” to interrogatory
may so state, but must “make a reasonable and good faith effort to obtain the
information by inquiry to other natural persons or organizations,” unless the
information is “equally available to the propounding party.”]) Here, Plaintiff’s responses do not
state that he was unable to respond or that he did not have personal knowledge
sufficient to respond fully. Thus, Plaintiff is required to respond to the
discovery based on the information known to him. Additionally, privacy concerns are not absolute; “they
must be balanced against other important interests....¿Invasion of a privacy
interest is not a violation of the state constitutional right to privacy if the
invasion is justified by a competing interest. Legitimate interests derive from
the legally authorized and socially beneficial activities of government and
private entities.” (Hill v. National Collegiate Athletic Assn. (1994) 7
Cal.4th 1, 37-38.)  Here, Plaintiff’s responses fail to identify a legally protected
privacy right in which he has a reasonable expectation of privacy and the
threatened invasion of which is serious rather than trivial. Given that the
Court has previously found that the interrogatories are directly relevant to
the issues raised in the Complaint, it determines that Plaintiff’s objections
have failed to demonstrate that a balancing test could tip toward any potential
invasion of privacy when weighed against the competing public interests of
obtaining just results in litigation. Furthermore, Plaintiff’s other objections based on vagueness,
ambiguity, and overbreadth, without the support of factual showing or legal
analysis, do not overcome the Court’s previous determination that the
interrogatories are relevant and specific. Lastly, Plaintiff has not filed an Opposition to the Motion,
thereby waiving any issues and failing to meet the burden in justifying his
objections. Consequently, the Court considers Plaintiff’s objections to be
without merit. Accordingly, the Court GRANTS
the Motion to Compel Further Responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One. C.   
Monetary
Sanctions Beltran also requests the imposition of monetary
sanctions in the amount of $1,635.00, against Plaintiff and his former attorney
of record, Grant/Shenon, A Professional Law Corporation, under Code of Civil
Procedure section 2030.300. Although Grant/Shenon, A Professional Law Corporation,
has been substituted out as counsel for Plaintiff, the initial responses to
Defendant’s Form Interrogatories were provided during its period of
representation. This justifies the request for monetary sanctions against the
firm as Plaintiff’s former counsel of record.  Utilizing a lodestar approach, and in view of the totality
of the circumstances, the Court finds that the total and reasonable amount of
attorney’s fees and costs incurred for the work in preparing the Motion is
$960.00, calculated at a reasonable hourly rate of $450.00 for two hours
reasonably spent, in addition to $60.00 for filing fees.  CONCLUSION Defendant
Macaria Beltran’s Motion to Compel Further Responses to Form Interrogatories,
Set One, is GRANTED. Plaintiff
Patrick Graham is ordered to provide supplemental responses to Defendant’s Form
Interrogatories, Set One, within 30 days. Defendant
Macaria Beltran’s Request for Monetary Sanctions is GRANTED IN PART. Plaintiff
Patrick Graham and Grant/Shenon, A Professional Law Corporation, are ordered,
jointly and severally, to pay $960.00 to Defendant Macaria Beltran. Moving
party to give notice.
