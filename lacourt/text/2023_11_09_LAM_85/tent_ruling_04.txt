The court has ruled on the parties’ written evidentiary objections, placing an
“O” for “overruled” and “S” for “sustained” where there was no blank to check.  Some objections were overruled pursuant to Fibreboard
Paper Products Corp. v. East Bay Union of Machinists, Local 1304, Seelworkers
of America, AFL-CIO, (1964) 227 Cal.App.2d 675, 712 (court may overruled
objection if any portion of objected to material is admissible).


            [2]Honarkar
requests judicial notice of (1) an “Order to Cease and Desist Issued Upon
Consent Pursuant to the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, as Amended,” issued by the
Board of Governors of the United States Federal Reserve System, dated January
18, 2022 (RJN Ex. 20); and (2) various Deeds of Trust (“DOT”) recorded in
Orange County and San Bernadino County between June 2021 and January 2023 (RJN
Exs. 21-28).  The requests are
granted.  Evid. Code §452(c).

Notwithstanding the choice of Delaware law, the Operating Agreements state that
any actions related to or arising out of the Operating Agreements shall be
brought in Los Angeles County.  Id.


[4] At the
time that Honarkar’s demands were made, and at the time his Petition was filed,
both Honarkar and Respondent MOMs believed that he was a member of the
MOMs.  Honarkar Decl., ¶21.  Upon the review of documents, Honarkar
recalled that the Operating Agreements were amended in July 2022 so that 4G, an
entity that was owned and controlled by Honarkar, became the member of the MOMs
in his place.  Honarkar Decl., ¶22, Ex.
15.  Honarkar remained the beneficial
member of the MOMs and remained personally liable for the obligations of a
member.  Ex. 15.
In their recently filed “Demand for Arbitration” in the
Related Cases, the MOMs admit that this is correct: “In exchange, Honarkar
became a member of the MOM Entities, which membership was later transferred to
4G Wireless, Inc. in July 2022.”   Ybarra Decl., Ex. 2 (Declaration of Michael
Farrell, Ex. 4, Attachment 1, ¶3).  Reply

to record the associated DOTs, which occurred months after they had been
executed.  Reply at 9.

When the court refers to a category by a single word description, it does not
purport to limit the production to documents that meet that single word
description.  Rather, the court intends
the entire category to be produced.
