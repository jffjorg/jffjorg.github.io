  Case Number:  21STCV22304    Hearing Date:   November 9, 2023    Dept:  85 
Ari Chazanas v. Vazgen
Hakopian, 21STCV22304
 
Tentative decision on application
for right to attach order: granted in part




 
            
            
            Plaintiff
Ari Chazanas (“Ari”) applies for a right to attach order against Defendant Vazgen
Hakopian (“Hakopian”) in the amount of $67,500.
            The
court has read and considered the moving papers (no opposition was filed) and
renders the following tentative decision.
 
            A. Statement of the Case
            1.
Complaint
            Plaintiff
Ari filed the Complaint on June 15, 2021, alleging breach of contract, fraud,
negligence, restitution under Business and Professions Code (“Bus. & Prof.
Code”) section 7031, and money had and received.  The Complaint alleges in pertinent part as
follows.
            Hakopian
owns T. Max Custom Cabinets (“T. Max”). 
In November 2020, Ari spoke with Hakopian about remodeling the kitchen
(“Project”) at Ari’s new home at 1835 Old Ranch Road, Los Angeles, CA (“Project
Property”).  During these conversations,
Hakopian represented he had the necessary qualifications and had performed
similar remodels before.  On November 11,
2020, Hakopian provided a $52,000 invoice for the work listed therein
(“Invoice”).  The parties later added
items and increased the quote to $61,600. 

            Based
on Hakopian’s assertions and the Invoice, in November 2020, the parties entered
an oral agreement to complete the Project in 45 days for $61,600.  Hakopian was to conduct all work and furnish
all labor and material for the Project.  The
parties agreed on the type of marble and the wood for the cabinets.  On November 24. 2020, Ari made the required
down payment of $8,000.  He then made
payments totaling an additional $53,600 through April 23, 2021.
            Because
the agreement constituted a home improvement contract within the definition of Bus.
& Prof. Code section 7159, the agreement was required to be in writing,
signed by all parties, with numerous disclosures.  Hakopian provided no such contract.  The down payment also exceeded the $1,000
maximum under Bus. & Prof. Code section 7159.
            From
the beginning of the Project, Hakopian’s work was behind schedule, of low
quality, and not compliant with industry standards.  The Project was not finished by April
2021.  Cabinets and stone slabs were not
framed and installed properly, and the cabinets were made of cheap, low-quality
material.  
            In
April 2021, Ari had to engage new contractors to demolish and re-do the cabinets.  He also paid $10,000 for a contractor to repair
and correct a stone slab.  The total cost
of re-doing the Project was about $70,000.
            Ari
also learned Hakopian did not have the licenses he claimed to have to conduct
the Project.  He should have been
licensed as a general contractor and held specialty licenses like a C- 6
Cabinet, Millwork, and Finish Carpentry license.  Based on the definition of a contractor in
Bus. & Prof. Code section 7026.1, Hakopian was required to be licensed as a
contractor by the Contractors State License Board (“CSLB”).  In May 2021, Ari searched and CSLB database
and found Hakopian was never listed as a general or specialty contractor during
this project.  The CSLB later issued a
Verified Certificate of non-licensure status for Hakopian.
            Bus.
& Prof. Code section 7031(b) allows Ari to bring an action against an
unlicensed contractor to recover all compensation paid to the unlicensed
contractor for performance of any act or contract.  Because of Hakopian’s false representations, Bus.
& Prof. Code section 7160 allows him to recover a $500 penalty, attorney’s
fees, and any damages sustained in reliance on those representations.  Demands for the return of all amount paid
have failed.  
            Ari
seeks (1) return of the $61,600 paid to Hakopian, plus 10% annual interest; (2)
$70,000 for costs to complete and repair the work; (3) $15,000 to reimburse Ari
for the additional month’s lease he paid for his previous home because of
Hakopian’s delay; (4) attorney’s fees per CCP section 1029.8 and Bus. &
Prof. Code section 7160; (5) $10,000 in treble damages per CCP section 1029.8;
(6) $13,000 to purchase three marble slabs to replace slabs Hakopian’s
fabricators either damaged or lost; (7) $500 in penalties under Bus. &
Prof. Code section 7160; (9) exemplary damages; and (9) costs of suit.
 
            2.
Cross-Complaint
            On
November 10, 2021, Hakopian filed a Cross-Complaint against Cross-Defendants
Ari, Lotus West Properties, Inc. (“Lotus”), Demetra Chazanas (“Demetra”), and
Demetra Design Corp. (“DDC”), alleging (1) failure to pay overtime wages; (2)
failure to pay all wages upon termination; (3) failure to provide wage
statements; (4) failure to provide meal periods; (5) failure to provide rest
periods; and (6) unfair competition.  The
verified Cross-Complaint alleges in pertinent part as follows.
            Ari
is a real estate developer and owns Lotus.  Demetra is an interior designer and owns DDC.  Each company is an alter-ego of its owner.
            On
August 25, 2019, the four Cross-Defendants hired Hakopian as an employee to
install kitchen and bathroom cabinets in Ari’s residential developments.  Hakopian was an employee because the
companies dictated the projects he worked on, hours, wages, arrival and
quitting time, work to complete on a particular day, which cabinets and
countertops to install, kitchen and bathroom designs, and start and end dates
for the projects.
            In
November 2020, Cross-Defendants assigned Hakopian to perform the Project.  As part of this assignment, Hakopian would
install kitchen and bathroom cabinets and countertops at the Project Property.  Cross-Defendants chose and supplied the
cabinets and countertops, only to later complain they did not like their
choices.  On May 17, 2021,
Cross-Defendants terminated Hakopian.  At
the time, they owed him $25,000 in unpaid wages.  Penalty wages under Labor Code section 203
have since accrued.
            During
Hakopian's employment, under Labor Code section 226(a), Cross-Defendants failed
to provide itemized wage statements.  Under
Labor Code section 226(e), Hakopian is entitled to recover $50 for the first violation
and $100 per violation thereafter for up to $4,000, plus reasonable attorney’s
fees.
            Although
Hakopian often worked more than eight hours a day and forty days a week,
Cross-Defendants failed to pay overtime. 
They also failed to provide the required 30-minute meal periods and
10-minute rest periods.  
            The
conduct also constitutes unfair competition under Bus. & Prof. Code section
17200.  Hakopian is therefore entitled to
restitution of all wages and overtime of which he was deprived as of
termination, compensation of missed meals and rest periods, prejudgment
interest, and attorney’s fees.
            Hakopian
seeks damages, restitution for unfair competition, prejudgment interest, and
attorney’s fees.
 
            3.
Course of Proceedings
            On
September 9, 2021, Ari served Hakopian with the Complaint and Summons.
            On
October 28, 2021, Hakopian served his Answer and filed it the next day.
            On
December 3, 2021, Hakopian served Ari, Lotus, Demetra, and DDC with the
Cross-Complaint and Summons.
            On
March 7, 2022, Cross-Defendants filed and served Hakopian with separate
Answers.
            On
September 12, 2022, Department 34 (Hon. Michael Linfield) stayed the case in
its entirety.
            On
June 27, 2023, Department 34 lifted the stay only to allow Ari to apply for a
right to attach order.
            On
July 24, 2023, Department 34 took Ari’s application for a right to attach order
off-calendar for failure to file in the correct department.
            On
September 29, 2023, this court denied Ari’s ex parte application for a
right to attach order against Hakopian for $99,268.11.  The court granted a temporary protective
order (“TPO”) enjoining the release of $67,500 from escrow related to the sale
of 1565 Kings Road, Palmdale, CA 93551 (“Palmdale Property”).  It also set a hearing on the application for
a right to attach order for November 9, 2023. 

On October 17, 2023, Ari filed and served a new application for
a right to attach order in the amount of $67,500.
 
            B.
Applicable Law
            Attachment
is a prejudgment remedy providing for the seizure of one or more of the
defendant’s assets to aid in the collection of a money demand pending the
outcome of the trial of the action.  See
Whitehouse v. Six Corporation, (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 527, 533.  In 1972, and in a 1977 comprehensive
revision, the Legislature enacted attachment legislation (CCP §481.010 et
seq.) that meets the due process requirements set forth in Randone v.
Appellate Department, (1971) 5 Cal.3d 536. 
See Western Steel & Ship Repair v. RMI, (12986) 176
Cal.App.3d 1108, 1115.  As the attachment
statutes are purely the creation of the Legislature, they are strictly
construed.  Vershbow v. Reiner,
(1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 879, 882.




            A
writ of attachment may be issued only in an action on a claim or claims for
money, each of which is based upon a contract, express or implied, where the
total amount of the claim or claims is a fixed or readily ascertainable amount
not less than five hundred dollars ($500). 
CCP §483.010(a).  A claim is
“readily ascertainable” where the amount due may be clearly ascertained from
the contract and calculated by evidence; the fact that damages are unliquidated
is not determinative.  CIT
Group/Equipment Financing, Inc. v. Super DVD, Inc., (2004) 115 Cal.App.4th
537, 540-41 (attachment appropriate for claim based on rent calculation for
lease of commercial equipment).
            All
property within California of a corporation, association, or partnership is
subject to attachment if there is a method of levy for the property.  CCP §487.010(a), (b).  While a trustee is a natural person, a trust
is not.  Therefore, a trust’s property is
subject to attachment on the same basis as a corporation or partnership.  Kadison, Pfaelzer, Woodard, Quinn &
Rossi v. Wilson, supra, 197 Cal.App.3d at 4.
            If
the action is against a defendant who is a natural person, an attachment may be
issued only on a commercial claim which arises out of the defendant’s conduct
of a trade, business, or profession.  CCP
§483.010(c).  Consumer transactions
cannot form a basis for attachment.   CCP
§483.010(c); Kadison, Pfaelzer, Woodard, Quinn & Rossi v. Wilson,
(1987) 197 Cal.App.3d 1, 4 (action involving trust property was a commercial,
not a consumer, transaction).
            The
plaintiff may apply for a right to attach order by noticing a hearing for the
order and serving the defendant with summons and complaint, notice of the
application, and supporting papers any time after filing the complaint.  CCP §484.010. 
Notice of the application must be given pursuant to CCP section 1005,
sixteen court days before the hearing.  See
ibid.
            The
notice of the application and the application may be made on Judicial Council
forms (Optional Forms AT-105, 115).  The
application must be supported by an affidavit showing that the plaintiff on the
facts presented would be entitled to a judgment on the claim upon which the
attachment is based.  CCP §484.030.  
            Where
the defendant is a corporation, a general reference to “all corporate property
which is subject to attachment pursuant to subdivision (a) of Code of Civil
Procedure Section 487.010” is sufficient. 
CCP §484.020(e).  Where the
defendant is a partnership or other unincorporated association, a reference to
“all property of the partnership or other unincorporated association which is
subject to attachment pursuant to subdivision (b) of Code of Civil Procedure
Section 487.010” is sufficient.  CCP
§484.020(e).  A specific description of
property is not required for corporations and partnerships as they generally
have no exempt property.  Bank of
America v. Salinas Nissan, Inc., (“Bank of America”) (1989) 207
Cal.App.3d 260, 268.
            Where
the defendant is a natural person, the description of the property must be
reasonably adequate to permit the defendant to identify the specific property
sought to be attached.  CCP §484.020(e).  Although the property must be specifically
described, the plaintiff may target for attachment everything the individual
defendant owns.  Bank of America v.
Salinas Nissan, Inc., (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 260, 268.
            A
defendant who opposes issuance of the order must file and serve a notice of
opposition and supporting affidavit as required by CCP section 484.060 not
later than five court days prior to the date set for hearing.  CCP §484.050(e).  The notice of opposition may be made on a
Judicial Council form (Optional Form AT-155). 

            The
plaintiff may file and serve a reply two court days prior to the date set for
the hearing.  CCP §484.060(c). 
            At
the hearing, the court determines whether the plaintiff should receive a right
to attach order and whether any property which the plaintiff seeks to attach is
exempt from attachment.  The defendant
may appear the hearing.  CCP
§484.050(h).  The court generally will
evaluate the attachment application based solely on the pleadings and
supporting affidavits without taking additional evidence.  Bank of America, supra, 207
Cal.App.3d at 273. A verified complaint may be used in lieu of or in addition
to an affidavit if it states evidentiary facts. 
CCP §482.040.  The plaintiff has
the burden of proof, and the court is not required to accept as true any
affidavit even if it is undisputed.  See
Bank of America, supra, at 271, 273.



            The
court may issue a right to attach order (Optional Form AT-120) if the plaintiff
shows all of the following: (1) the claim on which the attachment is based is
one on which an attachment may be issued (CCP §484.090(a)(1)); (2) the
plaintiff has established the probable validity of the claim (CCP
§484.090(a)(2)); (3) attachment is sought for no purpose other than the
recovery on the subject claim (CCP §484.090(a)(3); and (4) the amount to be
secured by the attachment is greater than zero (CCP §484.090(a)(4)). 
            A
claim has “probable validity” where it is more likely than not that the
plaintiff will recover on that claim. 
CCP §481.190.  In determining this
issue, the court must consider the relative merits of the positions of the
respective parties.  Kemp Bros.
Construction, Inc. v. Titan Electric Corp., (2007) 146 Cal.App.4th 1474,
1484.  The court does not determine
whether the claim is actually valid; that determination will be made at trial
and is not affected by the decision on the application for the order.  CCP §484.050(b).
            Except
in unlawful detainer actions, the amount to be secured by the attachment is the
sum of (1) the amount of the defendant’s indebtedness claimed by the plaintiff,
and (2) any additional amount included by the court for estimate of costs and
any allowable attorneys’ fees under CCP section 482.110.  CCP §483.015(a); Goldstein v. Barak
Construction, (“Goldstein”) (2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 845, 852.  This amount must be reduced by the sum of (1)
the amount of indebtedness that the defendant has in a money judgment against
plaintiff, (2) the amount claimed in a cross-complaint or affirmative defense
and shown would be subject to attachment against the plaintiff, and (3) the
value of any security interest held by the plaintiff in the defendant’s
property, together with the amount by which the acts of the plaintiff (or a
prior holder of the security interest) have decreased that security interest’s
value.  CCP §483.015(b).  A defendant claiming that the amount to be
secured should be reduced because of a cross-claim or affirmative defense must
make a prima facie showing that the claim would result in an attachment
against the plaintiff.
            Before
the issuance of a writ of attachment, the plaintiff is required to file an
undertaking to pay the defendant any amount the defendant may recover for any
wrongful attachment by the plaintiff in the action.  CCP §489.210. 
The undertaking ordinarily is $10,000. CCP §489.220.  If the defendant objects, the court may
increase the amount of undertaking to the amount determined as the probable
recovery for wrongful attachment.  CCP
§489.220.  The court also has inherent
authority to increase the amount of the undertaking sua sponte.  North Hollywood Marble Co. v. Superior
Court, (1984) 157 Cal.App.3d 683, 691.
 
            C. Statement of Facts[1]
            1.
The Agreement
            In
the Fall of 2020, Ari and his wife purchased the Project Property.  Ari Decl., ¶4.  Also in the Fall of 2020, he met Hakopian,
who asserted he was T. Max’s owner and principal.  Ari Decl., ¶5.  Ari said he wanted a contractor to remodel
his kitchen, fabricate and install new custom cabinets and countertops, and
perform other work.  Ari Decl., ¶5.  Hakopian asserted that he and T. Max were
experienced in cabinet and kitchen renovation projects.  Ari Decl., ¶6.  He also said they maintained the necessary licensure,
certificates, and other legal requirements for the Projects.  Ari Decl., ¶6.  T. Max had completed numerous jobs similar to
the Project.  Ari Decl., ¶6.  
            Hakopian
gave Ari a $52,000 Invoice from T. Max with a list of anticipated Project
work.  Ari Decl., ¶5, Ex. A.  This work included fabrication of countertops
and kitchen cabinets.  Ari Decl., ¶5, Ex.
A.  The Invoice said that Hakopian would
need 45 days to finish it, starting from when he can deliver the boxes.  Ari Decl., ¶5, Ex. A.  Hakopian informed Ari that this was a higher
quote than usual because these cabinets would be of “high quality.”  Ari Decl., ¶5.
            On
November 19, 2020, Ari and Hakopian entered an oral contract for the
Project.  Ari Decl., ¶7.  In addition to the items listed in the Invoice,
Hakopian would fabricate and install additional bathroom cabinetry and
countertop.  Ari Decl., ¶7.  Hakopian agreed to use solid walnut and oak
materials for the cabinets and experienced and licensed fabricators for the
counters.  Ari Decl., ¶7.  The total contract price increased to $61,600,
with an $8,000 down payment.  Ari Decl.,
¶7.  Hakopian agreed to provide all
labor, material, supervision, coordination, storage, and shop drawings.  Ari Decl., ¶7.  He agreed to ensure the Project’s workmanlike
and substantial completion.  Ari Decl.,
¶7.  Hakopian would complete the Project
in 45 days.  Ari Decl., ¶7.
            On
November 24, 2020, Ari paid T. Max the $8,000 down payment.  Ari Decl., ¶8, Ex. B.  Between November 25, 2020 and April 23, 2021,
Ari paid an additional $53,600 in five checks. 
Ari Decl., ¶8, Ex. C.  The total
amount paid was $61,600.  Ari Decl., ¶8.
 
            2.
Breach
            From
November 2020 through April 2021, Ari visited the Project Property many times to
check Hakopian’s progress on the Project. 
Ari Decl., ¶9.  By April 2021, far
after the 45-day deadline, the Project was less than 50% complete.  Ari Decl., ¶9.  Hakopian also performed the work in an
unworkmanlike manner that did not conform to industry standards.  Ari Decl., ¶9.  The materials were of low quality and the
framing was improper compared to other contractors with whom Ari had
worked.  Ari Decl., ¶9.  The cabinet material was low-quality veneer
instead of the promised walnut.  Ari
Decl., ¶9.  The grain was oak, and the color
was not walnut.  Ari Decl., ¶9.  
            Ari
hired a licensed contractor to demolish and remove the work Hakopian had
performed and start the Project anew. 
Ari Decl., ¶10.  Ari paid this
contractor $70,000.  Ari Decl., ¶10.  
            In
May 2021, Ari began to suspect Hakopian had defrauded him.  Ari Decl., ¶11.  On May 19, he filed a complaint with the CSLB.  Ari Decl., ¶11; Kawahito Decl., ¶4, Ex. E.  On May 25, the CSLB issued a Verified
Certificate of non-licensure status.  Ari
Decl., ¶11, Ex. D.  A diligent search
revealed no records that Hakopian, doing business as T. Max, was registered as
a contractor since January 2018.  Ari
Decl., ¶11, Ex. D. 
            On
July 8, 2021, the CSLB notified Hakopian in writing about Ari’s complaint and
the CSLB’s finding that he was not a licensed contractor.  Kawahito Decl., ¶4, Ex. E.  The notice gave Hakopian ten days to contact
the CSLB to discuss the investigation.  Kawahito
Decl., ¶4, Ex. E.  If he had contracted
without a license, a criminal action against him could follow.  Kawahito Decl., ¶4, Ex. E.  
            Ari
would never have hired Hakopian if he knew Hakopian was not a licensed
contractor and could not complete the Project. 
Ari Decl., ¶17.
 
            3.
Source for Restitution
            On
June 15, 2021, Ari filed the Complaint in this action.  Ari Decl., ¶12, Ex. F.  It alleges breach of an oral contract and recovery
of amounts paid to an unlicensed contractor. 
Ari Decl., ¶12, Ex. F.  
            On
August 12, 2022, the Los Angeles City Attorney's Office filed the criminal case
The People of the State of California vs. Vazgen Hakopian, Case No.
2CJ01131, alleging violations of Bus. & Prof. Code sections 7028(a) and
7159.5(a)(3).  Ari Decl., ¶13, Ex. G.  On May 12, 2023, Department 45 (Hon. Kim
Nguyen) ordered Hakopian to pay $67,500 in restitution.  Ari Decl., ¶14, Ex. H.
            In
a June 2023 asset search on Hakopian, Ari discovered he owned two residential
real property assets that could satisfy the restitution order.  Ari Decl., ¶15.  Hakopian had already sold one of them, and the
other, Palmdale Property, was on the market. 
Ari Decl., ¶15.  Ari requested
that Hakopian fulfill the restitution order by paying the $67,500 out of the
escrow.  Ari Decl., ¶15.  Ari would then use this restitution to offset
against the amount owed in this case.  Ari
Decl., ¶15.  Hakopian refused.  Ari Decl., ¶15.  
            On
September 13, 2023, Ari learned the Palmdale Property had gone into
escrow.  Ari Decl., ¶16, Ex. J.  Ari interpreted this as an attempt to move
assets and hide money.  Ari Decl., ¶16.  He therefore applied for and was granted a TPO.  Ari Decl., ¶16.  On October 2, 2023. Ari posted the $10,000
undertaking for this TPO.  Ari Decl., ¶16,
Ex. I.  
            Ari
seeks attachment of $67,500 against Hakobian, solely to recover amounts owed.  Ari Decl., ¶¶ 17, 19.  The oral agreement was not secured by any
collateral or real property.  Ari Decl.,
¶18. 
 
            D. Analysis
            Ari
applies for a right to attach order Hakopian in the
amount of $67,500.
 
            1.
A Claim Based on a
Contract and on Which Attachment May Be Based
            A
writ of attachment may be issued only in an action on a claim or claims for
money, each of which is based upon a contract, express or implied, where the
total amount of the claim or claims is a fixed or readily ascertainable amount
not less than five hundred dollars ($500). 
CCP §483.010(a).  
            Ari’s
claim is based on breach of an oral
contract and violation of Bus. & Prof. Code sections 7031(b) and 7160.  Ari Decl., ¶12, Ex. F.  Courts have granted prejudgment writs
of attachment in disgorgement cases against unlicensed contractors.  See Goldstein, supra, 164
Cal.App.4th at 853-54.  The damages for each
claim are at least $61,600.  Ari Decl.,
¶8, Exs. B-C.  Ari has claims on which to
base attachment.
 
            2. An Amount Due That is Fixed
and Readily Ascertainable 
            A
claim is “readily ascertainable” where the damages may be readily ascertained by
reference to the contract and the basis of the calculation appears to be
reasonable and definite.  CIT
Group/Equipment Financing, Inc. v. Super DVD, Inc., (2004) 115 Cal.App.4th 537,
540-41.  The fact that the damages are
unliquidated is not determinative.  Id.  But the contract must furnish a standard by
which the amount may be ascertained and there must be a basis by which the
damages can be determined by proof.  Id.
(citations omitted).
            A
person who utilizes the services of an unlicensed contractor may bring an
action in any court of competent jurisdiction in this state to recover all
compensation paid to the unlicensed contractor for performance of any act or
contract.  Bus. & Prof. Code §7031(b).  A contractor is any person, consultant to an
owner-builder, firm, association, organization, partnership, business trust,
corporation, or company, who or which undertakes, offers to undertake, purports
to have the capacity to undertake, or submits a bid to construct any building
or home improvement project or part thereof. 
Bus. & Prof. Code §7026.1(a)(2)(A).
            Any
person who is induced to contract for a work of improvement, in reliance on
false or fraudulent representations or false statements knowingly made, may
recover from such contractor a $500 penalty plus reasonable attorney’s fees, in
addition to any damages sustained by him by reason of such statements or
representations made by the contractor or solicitor.  Bus. & Prof. Code §7160.  
            The initial Invoice for the Project listed
a price of $52,000.  Ari Decl., ¶5, Ex.
A.  The scope of this work included
fabrication of countertops and kitchen cabinets.  Ari Decl., ¶5, Ex. A.  The parties later expanded the scope of the
Project and increased the cost to $61,600, with an $8,000 down payment.  Ari Decl., ¶7.  Ari paid Hakopian $61,600 across six checks.  Ari Decl., ¶8, Exs. B-C.  Readily ascertainable damages under Bus.
& Prof. Code section 7031(b) total $61,600.
            Mem.
at 7.  In addition to the $61,600 paid
pursuant to the oral agreement, Ari paid $70,000 to have another contractor
redo the Project after Ari’s breach thereof. 
Ari Decl., ¶10.  The court in the
Criminal Case awarded Ari $67,500 in restitution from Hakopian.  Mem. at 7, 10; Ari Decl., ¶14, Ex. H.  Ari asserts that the ascertainable damages
total $67,500.  
            The
maximum attachment available to Ari is $61,600. 
Ari may be awarded $70,000 as damages at trial, but this amount is not readily
ascertainable from the agreement.  Nor
does the restitution order in the Criminal Case control.  The criminal court issued this order based on
violations of Bus. & Prof. Code sections 7028(a) and 7159.5(a)(3).  Ari Decl., ¶13, Ex. G.  This does not bear on readily ascertainable
damages for breach of contract or in violation of Bus. & Prof. Code section
7031(b).
            Ari
asserts that he will be entitled to attorney’s fees under Bus. & Prof. Code
section 7160.  Mem. at 9.  Ari does not present any evidence of
estimated attorney’s fees and they are disallowed.  Mem. at 9. 
Ari would be entitled after trial to the $500 penalty in Bus. &
Prof. Code section 7160, but penalties are not available for attachment.
            The
readily ascertainable damages total $61,600. 

 
            3.
Attachment Based on Commercial Claim
            If
the action is against a defendant who is a natural person, an attachment may be
issued only on a commercial claim which arises out of the defendant’s conduct
of a trade, business, or profession.  CCP
§483.010(c).  Consumer transactions
cannot form a basis for attachment.   CCP
§483.010(c); Kadison, Pfaelzer, Woodard, Quinn & Rossi v. Wilson, (“Kadison”)
(1987) 197 Cal.App.3d 1, 4 (action involving trust property was a commercial,
not a consumer, transaction).
            The
initial Invoice was in the name of T. Max. 
Ari Decl., ¶5, Ex. A.  Ari asserts
that “T. Max” is a fictitious business name that cannot insulate Hakopian from
liability.  Mem. at 8.  This is true. 
In addition, Ari shows that he made the oral agreement with Hakopian,
not T. Max.  Ari Decl., ¶7.  Hakopian represented that he was the owner of
T. Max, a company experienced in cabinet and kitchen renovation projects.  Ari Decl., ¶6. 
   He also asserted that he had
the licenses necessary to complete the Project. 
Ari Decl., ¶6.  The action arises out
of Hakopian’s conduct of a business or profession.  
 
            4. Probability of Success
            A
claim has “probable validity” where it is more likely than not that the
plaintiff will recover on that claim. 
CCP §481.190.  In determining this
issue, the court must consider the relative merits of the positions of the
respective parties.  Kemp Bros.
Construction, Inc. v. Titan Electric Corp., (2007) 146 Cal.App.4th 1474,
1484.  The court does not determine
whether the claim is actually valid; that determination will be made at trial
and is not affected by the decision on the application for the order.  CCP §484.050(b).
 
            a.
Bus. & Prof. Code Section 7028(a)
            A
person who utilizes services of an unlicensed contractor may bring an action to
recover all compensation paid to the unlicensed contractor for performance of
any act or contract.  Bus. & Prof.
Code §7031(b).  
            Ari
and Hakopian entered the oral agreement for the Project in November 2021.  Ari Decl., ¶7.  By April 2021, Ari had paid $61,600 for
Hakopian and T. Max to complete the Project. 
Ari Decl., ¶8, Exs. B-C.  In May 2021,
the CSLB informed Ari it had no records of Hakopian or T. Max’s licensure since
2018.  Ari Decl., ¶11, Ex. D.  
            Ari
has demonstrated a probability of success under Bus. & Prof. Code section 7031(b).

 
            b.
Bus. & Prof. Code Section 7160
            Any
person induced to contract for a work of improvement, in reliance on false or
fraudulent representations or false statements knowingly made, may recover from
such contractor a $500 penalty plus reasonable attorney’s fees, in addition to
any damages sustained by him by reason of such statements or representations
made by the contractor or solicitor. 
Bus. & Prof. Code §7160.  
            Ari
asserts that when he discussed the Project with Hakopian before the agreement,
Hakopian said that he had the necessary credentials and experience to complete
the Project.  Mem. at 9; Ari Decl., ¶6.  Ari would not have hired Hakopian if he knew
otherwise.  Ari Decl., ¶17.  Although Ari fails to provide an evidentiary
foundation for Hakopian’s representations of when and where they were made, there is no
opposition and this defect is waived.
            Ari
has demonstrated a probability of success under Bus. & Prof. Code section 7160.
  
 
            5.
Attachment Sought for a Proper Purpose 
            Attachment
must not be sought for a purpose other than the recovery on the claim upon
which attachment is based.  CCP §484.090(a)(3).  Ari seeks
attachment for a proper purpose.  Ari
Decl., ¶¶ 17, 19.
 
            6.
Description of Property to be Attached
            Where
the defendant is a natural person, the description of the property must be
reasonably adequate to permit the defendant to identify the specific property
sought to be attached.  CCP §484.020(e).  Although the property must be specifically
described, the plaintiff may target for attachment everything the individual
defendant owns.  Bank of America v.
Salinas Nissan, Inc., (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 260, 268. The requirement of
specificity avoids unnecessary hearings where an individual defendant is
willing to concede that the described property is subject to attachment.  Ibid. 
A general list of categories - e.g., “real property, personal
property, equipment, motor vehicles, chattel paper, negotiable and other
instruments, securities, deposit accounts, safe-deposit boxes, accounts
receivable, general intangibles, property subject to pending actions, final
money judgments, and personal property in decedents’ estates” – is
sufficient.  Ibid. 
            Ari
seeks to attach Hakopian’s interests in real property except leasehold estates
with unexpired terms of less than one year; accounts receivable; chattel paper;
equipment; farm products; inventory; general intangibles and final money
judgments arising out of the conduct by the defendant of a trade, business, or
profession, except when an individual claim has a principal balance of under
$150; money on the premises where a trade, business, or profession is conducted
and elsewhere, except for the first $1,000; deposit accounts; negotiable
documents of title; instruments; securities; minerals or the like to be
extracted; money from an escrow account related to the sale of the Palmdale
Property; and any community property that would be subject to enforcement of
judgment obtained in this case.  The
description of attachable property is adequate.
 
            E. Conclusion
            The
application for a right to attach order is granted in the amount of $61,600.  Ari has already filed a $10,000 undertaking
and no additional undertaking is required. Mem. at 10; Ari Decl., ¶16, Ex. I.
