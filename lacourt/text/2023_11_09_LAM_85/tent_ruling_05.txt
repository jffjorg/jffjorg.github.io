 Case Number:  23STLC05063    Hearing Date:   November 9, 2023    Dept:  85 
Keys Auto Finance v. Ryan
Torre, 23STLC05063
 
Tentative decision on application
for a writ of possession: granted



 
            
            Plaintiff
Keys Auto Finance (“Keys”) seeks a writ of possession against Defendant Ryan
Torre (“Torre”) to recover a 2007 BMW 3 Series 335i Sedan, VIN WBAVB73547VF50895
(“Vehicle”).  
            The
court has read and considered the moving papers (no opposition was filed) and
renders the following tentative decision.
 
            A. Statement of the Case
            1.
Complaint
            Plaintiff
Keys filed the Complaint against Defendant Torre on August 10, 2023, alleging (1)
possession of personal property, (2) breach of contract, (3) goods sold and
delivered, (4) book account, and (5) account stated.  The Complaint alleges as follows.
            On
May
6, 2022, Torre entered a written Contract (“Contract”) in which Keys leased
the Vehicle to Torre.  At all relevant
times, Keys has been the legal owner of the Vehicle.  The Certificate of Title from the Department
of Motor Vehicles (“DMV”) reflects Keys’s interest.  The Contract gives Keys the right to take
and have immediate possession of the Vehicle after default.  
            Torre
breached the Contract on March 6, 2023, by failing to make
the monthly lease payment due.  He has
also failed to maintain physical damage insurance for the Vehicle,
which the Contract also defines as a breach. 
The balance due and owing is $12,436.66 plus interest thereon.  Demands to turn over the Vehicle have
failed.  The Contract requires Torre to
reimburse Keys for all expenses incurred to enforce the Contract, including
collection costs and attorney’s fees and costs.
            Keys
seeks (1) possession for the Vehicle, or payoff of $12,436.66 with interest and
costs if recovery cannot be had; (2) compensatory damages of $15.23 per day
from March 6, 2023, until Keys has possession of the Vehicle; (3) the balance
owed under the Contract plus interest at the maximum judicial rate from March
6, 2023, with applicable delinquency charges and collection costs, less any
proceeds from disposition of the Vehicle if Keys obtains it; and (4) attorney’s
fees and costs.
 
            2.
Course of Proceedings 
            On
October 3, 2023, Keys served Torre with the Complaint, Summons, and moving
papers by substitute service, effective October 13, 2023.
 
            B.
Applicable Law
            A
writ of possession is issued as a provisional remedy in a cause of action for
claim and delivery, also known as replevin. 
See Pillsbury, Madison
& Sutro v. Schectman, (1997) 55 Cal.App.4th 1279, 1288.  As a provisional remedy, the right to
possession is only temporary, and title and the right to possess are determined
in the final judgment.  
            A
writ of possession is available in any pending action.  It also is available where an action has been
stayed pending arbitration, so long as the arbitration award may be ineffectual
without provisional relief.  See CCP §1281.7. 
 
            1. Procedure
            Upon
the filing of the complaint or at any time thereafter, a plaintiff may apply
for an order for a writ of possession. 
Unlike attachment, where Judicial Council forms are optional, the
parties must use the mandatory approved Judicial Council forms in a claim and
delivery proceeding.  (Judicial Council
Forms CD-100 et seq.).
            A
plaintiff must make a written application for a writ of possession.  CCP §512.010(a), (b); (Mandatory Form
CD-100); CCP §512.010(a).  A verified
complaint alone is insufficient.  6
Witkin, California Procedure, (5th ed. 2008) §255, p.203.  The application may be supported by
declarations and/or a verified complaint. 
CCP §516.030.  The declarations or
complaint must set forth admissible evidence except where expressly permitted
to be shown on information and belief.  Id.
            The
application must be executed under oath and include: (1) A showing of the basis
of the plaintiff's claim and that the plaintiff is entitled to possession of
the property claimed.  If the plaintiff's
claim is based on a written instrument, a copy of it must be attached; (2) A
showing that the property is wrongfully detained by the defendant, how the
defendant came into possession of it, and, the reasons for the detention based
on the plaintiff’s best knowledge, information, and belief; (3) A specific description
of the property and statement of its value; (4) The location of the property
according to the plaintiff’s best knowledge, information, and belief.  If the property, or some part of it, is
within a private place which may have to be entered to take possession, a
showing of probable cause to believe that the property is located there; and
(5) A statement that the property has not been taken for (a) a tax, assessment,
or fine, pursuant to a statute, or (b) an execution against the plaintiff’s
property.  Alternatively, a statement
that if the property was seized for one of these purposes, it is by statute
exempt from such seizure.  CCP
§512.010(b).
 
            2. The Hearing
            Before
noticing a hearing, the plaintiff must serve the defendant with all of the
following: (1) A copy of the summons and complaint; (2) A Notice of Application
and Hearing; and (3) A copy of the application and any supporting declaration.  CCP §512.030(a).  If the defendant has not appeared in the
action, service must be made in the same manner as service of summons and
complaint.  CCP §512.030(b).
            Each
party shall file with the court and serve upon the other party any declarations
and points and authorities intended to be relied upon at the hearing.  CCP §512.050. 
At the hearing, the court decides the merits of the application based on
the pleadings and declarations.   Id.  Upon a showing of good cause, the court may
receive and consider additional evidence and authority presented at the
hearing, or may continue the hearing for the production of such additional
evidence, oral or documentary, or the filing of other affidavits or points and
authorities.  Id.  
            The
court may order issuance of a writ of possession if both of the following are
found: (1) The plaintiff has established the probable validity of the
plaintiff’s claim to possession of the property; and (2) The undertaking
requirements of CCP section 515.010 are satisfied.  CCP §512.060(a).  “A claim has ‘probable validity’ where it is
more likely than not that the plaintiff will obtain a judgment against the
defendant on that claim.”  CCP
§511.090.  This requires that the
plaintiff establish a prima facie case; the writ shall not issue if the
defendant shows a reasonable probability of a successful defense to the claim
and delivery cause of action.  Witkin,
California Procedure, (5th ed. 2008) §261, p.208.  A defendant’s claim of defect in the property
is not a defense to the plaintiff’s right to possess it.  RCA Service Co. v. Superior Court,
(1982) 137 Cal.App.3d 1, 3.
            No
writ directing the levying officer to enter a private place to take possession
of any property may be issued unless the plaintiff has established that there
is probable cause to believe that the property is located there.  CCP §512.060(b).  
            The
successful plaintiff may obtain a preliminary injunction containing the same
provisions as a TRO that remains in effect until the property is seized by the
levying officer.[1]  CCP §513.010(c).  
            The
court may also issue a “turnover order” directing the defendant to transfer
possession of the property to the plaintiff (See Mandatory Form CD-120). 
The order must notify the defendant that failure to comply may subject
him or her to contempt of court.  CCP
§512.070.  The turnover remedy is not
issued in lieu of a writ, but in conjunction with it to provide the plaintiff
with a less expensive means of obtaining possession.  See
Edwards v Superior Court, (“Edwards”) (1991) 230 Cal.App.3d 173,
178.
 
            3. The Plaintiff’s Undertaking
            Generally,
the court cannot issue an order for a writ of possession until the plaintiff
has filed an undertaking with the court (Mandatory Form CD-140 for personal
sureties).  CCP §515.010(a).  The undertaking shall provide that the
sureties are bound to the defendant for the return of the property to the
defendant, if return of the property is ordered, and for the payment to the
defendant of any sum recovered against the plaintiff.  Id. 
The undertaking shall be in an amount not less than twice the value of
the defendant's interest in the property or in a greater amount.  Id. 
The value of the defendant's interest in the property is determined by
the market value of the property less the amount due and owing on any
conditional sales contract or security agreement and all liens and encumbrances
on the property, and any other factors necessary to determine the defendant’s
interest in the property.  Id.
            However,
where the defendant has no interest in the property, the court must waive the requirement
of the plaintiff’s undertaking and include in the order for issuance of the
writ the amount of the defendant’s undertaking sufficient to satisfy the
requirements of CCP section 515.020(b).  CCP
§515.010(b). 
 
            C. Statement of Facts
            On May 6, 2022, Torre and Keys
entered into a written Contract to lease the Vehicle.  Shafie Decl., ¶5, Ex. A.  Torre was required to make 42 installments of
$456.91 from June 6, 2022 thereafter.  Shafie
Decl., ¶5, Ex. A.  During this time, Torre
also agreed to have physical damage insurance that will cover any loss of or
damage to the Vehicle.  Shafie Decl., ¶5,
Ex. A.  In the event of default for
failure to pay or Torre’s breach of any other promise in the Contract, Keys had
the right to accelerate the amount owed, repossess the Vehicle, and assess a 5%
late charge for any payment that is overdue by more than ten days.  Shafie Decl., ¶5, Ex. A.  
            The
Certificate of Title from the DMV reflects Keys’s interest in the Vehicle.  Shafie Decl., ¶5, Ex. B.  Keys has been the Vehicle’s legal owner at
all relevant times.  Shafie Decl., ¶6.
            Torre
breached the Contract for failure to pay the monthly installment due on March
6, 2023.  Shafie Decl., ¶7.  Torre has also failed to maintain physical
damage insurance for the protection of the Vehicle, a separate breach of the
Contract.  Shafie Decl., ¶8.  Keys has elected to exercise its right to
accelerate the amount owed under the Contract and demand return of the
Vehicle.  Shafie Decl., ¶7.  The outstanding balance is $12,436.66.  Shafie Decl., ¶9.  
            As
of July 21, 2023, the Kelley Blue Book lists the Vehicle’s market value as $5,570
and its current listing price as $6,520. 
Shafie Decl., ¶9, Ex. C.  Because
the outstanding balance owed is $12,436.66, Torre’s equity in the Vehicle is negative
$6,866.66.  Shafie Decl., ¶9.  
            The
Contract and Certificate of Title lists Torre’s address as 365 Cliff Dr Apt
208, Pasadena, CA 91107.  Shafie Decl.,
¶5, Exs. A-B.  Keys believes this is the
Vehicle’s current location.  Shafie Decl.,
¶12.  
 
            D. Analysis
            Plaintiff
Keys seeks a writ of possession for the Vehicle against Torre.
 
            1.
Breach of Agreement
            The
Contract required Torre to make 42 lease payments of $456.91 from June 6, 2022 thereafter.  Shafie Decl., ¶5, Ex. A.  During this time, Torre also agreed to have
physical damage insurance that will cover any loss of or damage to the Vehicle.  Shafie Decl., ¶5, Ex. A.  In the event of default for failure to pay or
Torre’s breach of any other promise in the Contract, Keys had the right to
accelerate the amount owed, repossess the Vehicle, and assess a 5% late charge
for any payment that is overdue by more than ten days.  Shafie Decl., ¶5, Ex. A.  The Certificate of Title reflects Keys’s
interest in the Vehicle.  Shafie Decl.,
¶5, Ex. B.
            Keys
presents only conclusory evidence that Torre breached the Contract, both for
failure to maintain insurance and failure to pay the installment due on March
6, 2023.  Shafie Decl., ¶¶ 7-8.  There is no payment history or calculation of
the amount owed.  However, the Contract
is a lease and there is no showing that Torre has any legal interest in the
Vehicle.
 
            2.
Undertaking
            The
undertaking shall be in an amount not less than twice the value of the
defendant's interest in the property or in a greater amount.  CCP §515.010(a).
            T
Keys does not need to post an undertaking because Torre has no legal interest in
the Vehicle.  Mem. at 4.  
 
            3.
Redelivery Bond
            The
memorandum also asserts that Torre should have to file an undertaking of $12,436.66,
plus attorney’s fees and costs.  Mem. at
4.  
            If
the court finds that the defendant has no interest in the property, a defendant’s
redelivery undertaking shall state that if the plaintiff recovers judgment on
the action, the defendant shall pay all costs awarded to the plaintiff and all
damages that the plaintiff may sustain by reason of the loss of possession of
the property.  CCP §§ 515.010(b),
515.020(b).  This cannot exceed the value
of the Vehicle, or $6,520.  Shafie Decl.,
¶9, Ex. C.  The redelivery bond shall be the $6,520
value of
the Vehicle.
 
            4.
Order to Enter Private Property
            No
writ directing the levying officer to enter a private place to take possession
of any property may be issued unless the plaintiff has established that there
is probable cause to believe that the property is located there.  CCP §512.060(b).  
            Keys
believes the Vehicle is currently at 365 Cliff Dr Apt 208, Pasadena, CA 91107,
the address listed on the Contract and Certificate of Title.  Shafie Decl., ¶¶ 5, 12, Exs. A-B.  Keys can obtain a writ to enter that address
as a private residence, and any public or commercial address, to obtain the
Vehicle.  
 
            E.
Conclusion
            The
application for a writ of possession for the Vehicle is granted.  Keys has not filed a proposed order for writ
of possession and must do so within two court days of this hearing on the
proper Judicial Council form or it will be waived.  No undertaking is required, and the
re-delivery undertaking will be $6,520.  The
levying officer may enter the private address at 365 Cliff Dr Apt 208,
Pasadena, CA 91107 and any commercial or public address.
