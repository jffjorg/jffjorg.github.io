And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the parties' written evidentiary objections and has granted judicial notice of certain documents, including an "Order to Cease and Desist Issued Upon Consent Pursuant to the Federal Deposit Insurance Act" and various Deeds of Trust recorded in Orange and San Bernardino counties. The court has also overruled some objections and sustained others, citing relevant case law.

The court notes that, despite the choice of Delaware law, the Operating Agreements require any actions related to or arising out of the agreements to be brought in Los Angeles County.

The court also notes that Honarkar was a member of MOMs, but was replaced by 4G Wireless, Inc. as a member in July 2022. Honarkar remains the beneficial member of MOMs and remains personally liable for the obligations of a member.

The court has granted Honarkar's request for judicial notice of the documents related to the transfer of membership in MOMs to 4G Wireless, Inc.

The court has also determined that the issue of Honarkar's ownership and control over 4G is being litigated in the Related Actions and that Honarkar has demanded arbitration of the Related Cases.
