And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by the Defendant County of Los Angeles to the Complaint filed by Plaintiff YOLANDA CASSIDY. The Plaintiff alleges that the Defendants used her name to falsely communicate that she treated a deceased police dog and participated in a cover-up of the dog's death, which harmed her professional reputation and ability to earn income.

The Court has concluded that the Plaintiff's false light claim is adequately pleaded and that the Plaintiff has alleged sufficient special damages. The Court has also ruled that the Plaintiff's cause of action for misappropriation of name invasion of privacy is valid, despite the Defendant's argument that the Plaintiff did not allege that the Defendants commercially benefited from the alleged misappropriation.

The Court has overruled the demurrer filed by the Defendant County of Los Angeles and has given the Plaintiff 20 days to answer.
