And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The plaintiff, Sami Ammari, seeks a new trial in his case against the City of Burbank. The court previously granted the city's summary judgment motion and denied Ammari's request to continue the hearing. Ammari now argues that the court abused its discretion and created irregularity by denying his continuance request and granting the city's motion without allowing him to amend his complaint. However, the court finds that Ammari failed to show due diligence and could have and should have filed a timely opposition to the summary judgment motion. The court also notes that Ammari's argument about a separate warrant issue lacks merit and that the issue is already covered by his existing complaint. Therefore, the court denies the motion for new trial.
