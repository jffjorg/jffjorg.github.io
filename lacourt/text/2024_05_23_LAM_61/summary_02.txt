And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the motion to vacate the sister-state judgment entered in favor of the plaintiff, 2336 Clark, LLC. The defendant, Maria Botham, argued that the judgment was improperly entered at a time when it was not final, as the plaintiff's prior sister-state judgment in the same action was previously ordered vacated on March 29, 2022. The defendant also argued that she was not served with the notice of entry of sister-state judgment as provided in Code of Civil Procedure § 1710.40, subd. (b). The court found that the prior order granting the plaintiff's motion to vacate judgment was based on the following facts and dates: the Illinois court granted the plaintiff leave to seek additional fees on November 2, 2021; the plaintiff filed the application for entry of sister-state judgment on November 12, 2021; and the Illinois court granted the plaintiff's request for fees and costs on November 18, 2021. The court cited Illinois law for the proposition that, if a trial court has jurisdiction to hear a claim for fees, any other judgment entered in the case before the claim for fees is ruled upon is or becomes nonfinal and nonappealable when the claim for fees is made. The court also noted that the failure to serve a notice of entry of judgment is not a grounds for vacating the judgment.
