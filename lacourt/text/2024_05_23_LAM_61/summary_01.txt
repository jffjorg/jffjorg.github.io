The defendant, WG Oxnard, LLC, has moved to compel the plaintiff, Fitness Club Management, Inc., to file an acknowledgment of satisfaction of judgment. The defendant claims to have satisfied the judgment through a post-judgment agreement between the parties, but the plaintiff opposes the motion, citing the pending action alleging fraud and seeking rescission of the agreement. The court finds that the merits of the defendant's motion are subject of the pending action and that the validity of the post-judgment agreement is in dispute. Therefore, the motion is denied without prejudice.
