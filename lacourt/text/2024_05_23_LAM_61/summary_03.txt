Summary:
This is a tentative ruling on a demurrer to the First Amended Complaint in a lawsuit between Sylvia Cuellar and Courtney N. Phillips, Trustee of the Clark Living Trust. The demurrer argues that the claims for specific performance are barred by the doctrine of res judicata, as the court previously ordered the transfer of the property to the trust. However, the court finds that the prior proceedings were not necessarily in the nature of a "quiet title" action, and that the transfer of the property into the trust does not prevent the plaintiff from seeking performance of the contract. The demurrer is therefore overruled as to the first through third causes of action.
