**Summary of Tentative Ruling**

The Judge's tentative ruling sustains the demurrer to Plaintiff's complaint, but only to the extent that it finds the complaint sufficient to withstand demurrer. The Judge also denies Defendant's motion to strike the prayer for punitive damages, references to Defendant as a "fiduciary", and prayers for "interest" in the complaint. The Judge finds that the complaint adequately alleges negligent misrepresentation and fraudulent concealment, and that the prayer for punitive damages is proper. The Judge also denies Defendant's motion to strike the prayer for prejudgment interest, finding that the issue is premature.
