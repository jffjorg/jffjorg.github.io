And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on various motions in limine filed by both parties. The plaintiff's motions 29, 32, 33, 34, 35, and 36 are denied, while the defendant's motion 23 is granted, limiting the introduction of evidence related to the amount of medical bills paid. The defendant's motions 24, 25, and 26 are also denied, except for motion 26, which is granted in part, allowing the defendant to introduce evidence about its financial ability to absorb costs if the plaintiff introduces evidence about the cost-effectiveness of improving the playground. The judge notes that the parties' motions in limine are filed on the eve of trial and are denied without prejudice, allowing the parties to renew their objections at trial. The judge will revisit its prior rulings if new evidence is introduced at trial.
