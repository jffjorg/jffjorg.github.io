```

And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in which the Plaintiffs' motion to strike the Answer in its entirety, or alternatively, portions of the Answer to the Complaint, filed by Defendants Salvador Carrillo and Veronica Cordova, has been DENIED. The Plaintiffs, Samuel Mariz, Rosa Lopez, Nicolas Mariz, Samuel Mariz Jr., and Alma Lopez, had sought to strike the Answer on the grounds that it included an improper general denial. However, the Judge notes that the Defendants had previously filed a Second Amended Verified Answer to the Complaint, which does not appear to include a general denial. Therefore, the motion appears to be based on the original or first amended answer and does not reference the second amended answer.
