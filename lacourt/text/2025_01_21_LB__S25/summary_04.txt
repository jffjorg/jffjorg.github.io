And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendant's demurrer to the complaint. The defendant's demurrer is sustained with leave to amend as to all causes of action, including breach of implied warranty of habitability, breach of contract, negligence, constructive eviction, unjust enrichment, and violation of California Civil Code § 1942.5.

The judge found that the statute of limitations has run on the first, second, third, seventh, and eighth causes of action, and that the doctrine of equitable estoppel does not apply. The judge also found that the doctrine of the statute of frauds applies to the agreement regarding the interest in real property, and that the plaintiffs have not alleged anything regarding equitable estoppel.

The judge also struck certain portions of the complaint with leave to amend, including allegations of emotional distress damages. The judge gave the plaintiffs 20 days to amend their complaint.

The judge's ruling is based on various California laws and court decisions, including Wassman v. South Orange County Community College District, Juran v. Epstien, Byrne v. Laura, Powers v. Ashton, Presta v. Tepper, Ehrlich v. Menezes, Hooked Media Group, Inc. v. Apple. Inc., and Trope v. Katz.
