 Case Number:  24LBCV01843    Hearing Date:   January 21, 2025    Dept:  S25 Procedural BackgroundOn August 30, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a complaint against Defendants Palazzo Realty, Inc., Todd Family Trust and Does 1 to 10, alleging the following causes of action:1) Breach of Implied Warranty of Habitability;2) Breach of Contract;3) Negligence;4) Constructive Eviction;5) Unjust Enrichment;6) Violation of California Civil Code § 1942.5;7) Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress;8) Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress.Plaintiffs allege that on they have resided as tenant of the residential property at 2459 Elm Avenue, Long Beach, California and that the tenancy was initiated based on a verbal rental agreement between Plaintiffs and the now-deceased Richard Todd. (Compl., ¶¶ 1.1, 3.1.) Plaintiffs further allege that they were met with severely substandard living conditions. (Compl., ¶ 4.1.)Meet and ConferDefense counsel states that she attempted to meet and confer with Plaintiffs but to no avail; the requirements are satisfied. (Seyler Decl., ¶¶ 2-8; Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a)(2), and § 435.5, subd. (a)(2) & (3).)Tentative RulingDefendant Demurrer to the Complaint is sustained with leave leaved to amended as to all causes of action.Statute of LimitationsThe statute of limitations for a breach of an oral contract is two years. (Code Civ. Proc., § 339.) The statute of limitations for “an action for assault, battery, or injury to, or for the death of, an individual caused by the wrongful act or neglect of another” is two years. (Code Civ. Proc., § 335.1; see also Wassman v. South Orange County Community CollegeDistrict (2018) 24 Cal.App.5th 825, 853.) Plaintiffs’ allegation that they have been aware of the breach of the oral contract or damages since 2005 means that the statute of limitations have run on the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 7th and 8th causes of action. The Court SUSTAINS the instant demurrer with leave to amend as to the 1st, 2nd, 3rd 7th and 8th causes of action on this ground.The Statute of FraudsUnder the statute of frauds, codified in section 1624 of the Civil Code, certain transactions, including, as relevant here, an agreement regarding an interest in real property, must be reduced to writing and subscribed by the party to be charged to be enforceable. (Civ. Code § 1624(a)(3) [“An agreement for the leasing for a longer period than one year, or for the sale of real property, or of an interest therein; such an agreement, if made by an agent of the party sought to be charged, is invalid, unless the authority of the agent is in writing, subscribed by the party sought to be charged”.]) However, equitable estoppel permits enforcement of an oral agreement to prevent fraud when one party has detrimentally relied on an oral promise or another party has been unjustly enriched. (Juran v. Epstien (1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 882, 892). Equitable estoppel may preclude a statute of frauds defense. (Byrne v. Laura (1997) 51 Cal.App.4th 1054, 1068). Whether the doctrine of equitable estoppel should be applied in a given case is a question of fact. (Ibid.) Here, no written agreement has been attached to the complaint that overcomes the statute of frauds defense. Moreover, Plaintiffs have not alleged anything regarding equitable estoppel. The instant demurrer is SUSTAINED with leave to amend on the statute of frauds ground as well.Todd Family Trust“[A] trust itself can neither sue nor be sued in its own name. Instead, the real party in interest in litigation involving a trust is always the trustee.” (Powers v. Ashton (1975) 45 Cal.App.3d 783, 787; see also Presta v. Tepper (2009) 179 Cal.App.4th 909, 914.) The Court agrees with Defendant that Plaintiffs may not sue the Todd Family Trust in its own name; rather, Plaintiffs must sue the trustee of the Todd Family Trust. The instant demurrer is SUSTAINED with leave to amend as to this ground as to Defendant Todd Family Trust.2nd Cause of Action – Breach of ContractPlaintiffs allege that they agreed to pay rent in exchange for the right to occupy the property; however, there is no direct allegation that Plaintiffs did perform their obligation of paying rent. Plaintiffs’ request for emotional distress damages does not apply to the 2nd cause of action. (See Ehrlich v. Menezes (1999) 21 Cal.4th 543, 558 [“damages for mental suffering and emotional distress are generally not recoverable in an action for breach of an ordinary commercial contract in California.”]) The instant demurrer is also SUSTAINED WITH LEAVE TO AMEND as to the 2nd cause of action on this ground.4th Cause of Action – Constructive EvictionThe Court finds that Plaintiffs have failed to allege that they surrendered or vacated the property, an essential element for a constructive eviction claim. The instant demurrer is SUSTAINED with leave to amend as to the 4th cause of action on this ground.5th Cause of Action – Unjust Enrichment"California does not recognize a cause of action for unjust enrichment.” (Hooked Media Group, Inc.. v. Apple. Inc. (2020) 55 Cal.App.5th 323, 336.) As the Court has sustained the demurrer as to all causes of action, the 5th cause of action cannot not survive standalone cause of action. The instant demurrer is SUSTAINED with leave to amend on this ground.Motion to StrikeThe Court strikes the following portions of the complaint with leave to amend:1. Compl., ¶ 7.3, 8:1-3,2.
