And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction, which sought to compel the HOA to remove Hsieh and Lee from the board of directors. The plaintiff failed to provide evidence of irreparable harm, which is a necessary requirement for injunctive relief. The court found that the plaintiff's petition did not demonstrate a likelihood of prevailing on the merits of the case at trial, and that the harm to the plaintiff would not outweigh the harm to the defendant if the injunction were granted. The court also noted that the plaintiff's motion did not address the fundamental requirement of equitable relief, which is irreparable harm.
