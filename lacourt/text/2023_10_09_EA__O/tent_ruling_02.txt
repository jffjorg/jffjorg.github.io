court that an amendment to the Association's Bylaws was passed and adopted in
2017 that allows for directors to reside offsite. (Opp. p. 3, citing
Associationâ€™s Bylaws, Section 4.01.) The amended petition only references
the 2007 amendment. (First Amended Petition, p. 3.) This fact is
dispositive of the entire lawsuit; thus, Plaintiff would likely have no
probability of prevailing on the merits.
