  Case Number:  23STCV05277    Hearing Date:   October 9, 2023    Dept:  O Tentative Ruling
 
Petitioner CYNTHIA ESCUTIA-COBAIN’s
MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY
INJUNCTION is DENIED.  
 
The Opposition makes references to multiple
related cases. (Opp. p.
2, fn. 1 [“Petitioner and her husband Arthur Cobian have also filed multiple
lawsuits (i.e., Case Nos. 21WCSC01360, 21WCSC01377, 23WCSC00262, 23WCSC00211,
and 23PSRO00366) against residents that are upset that Petitioner refuses to
grant access to the Association so that re-pipe project can be completed.  These lawsuits target such residents'
statements made during board meetings concerning Petitioner's failure to comply
with the CC&Rs and granting access.”].) Plaintiff is to comply with California Rules of Court
Rule 3.300 [Notice of Related case]. 
 
Background
 
This action pertains
to the HOA’s bylaws. Petitioner/Plaintiff CYNTHIA ESCUTIA-COBIAN in her
petition states, inter alia, that two persons elected to the Board of
Directors, Isabel Hsieh and Karen Lee, are not resident Unit Owners” as neither
live in any condominium of in the Fall Creek community but rent the units to
third parties, in violation of Article IV of the bylaws. 
 
On March 9,
2023, Plaintiff filed the instant ‘petition for writ of mandate, declaratory
relief, and injunction.’

On April 27, 2023, Plaintiff filed the instant motion for preliminary
injunction. 
 
On June 21,
2023, Plaintiff filed an amended petition against the Respondents.
 
On July 13,
2023, the court issued, in pertinent part, the following minute regarding
Plaintiff’s ex-parte application ‘For Temporary Restraining Order Pending
Hearing On Preliminary Injunction And Order To Advance The Hearing On The
Preliminary Injunction Persently Set For Hearing On October 9, 2023’: “The
moving party has failed to make an affirmative factual showing of irreparable
harm, immediate danger, or any statutory basis for granting relief Ex Parte
pursuant to California Rules of Court 3.1202(c).”
 
On July 21,
2023, Respondents filed a verified answer to the first amended petition. 
 
On July 26,
2023, Respondents filed a cross-complaint against Plaintiff for
Violation/Breach of the Governing Documents; Injunctive Relief; and Damages.
(Based upon a review of the cross-complaint, it is predicated upon the
allegation that the HOA has determined it is necessary to re-pipe all of the
buildings within the development, but Plaintiff has refused to allow the HOA
access to Plaintiff’s unit for the re-pipe project.) 
 
On July 31,
2023, Respondents filed their first amended verified answer. 
 
On September
21, 2023, Plaintiff filed a substitution of attorney (replacing William B.
Hanley with Feldsott, Lee & Nichter). 
 
On September
26, 2023, Respondents filed their opposition to the preliminary injunction
motion.
 
To date, as
of Tuesday, 10/03/23 at 8:30 AM, no Reply has been received (due 5 court days
before hearing [October, 10/02/23]).
 
Legal
Standard
 
The purpose of a preliminary injunction is to preserve
the status quo pending final resolution upon a trial. (See Scaringe v.
J.C.C. Enterprises, Inc. (1988) 205 Cal.App.3d 1536.) The status quo has
been defined to mean the last actual peaceable, uncontested status which
preceded the pending controversy. (14859 Moorpark Homeowner’s Assn. v. VRT
Corp. (1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 1396. 1402.) The burden of proof is on the
plaintiff as moving party. (O’Connell v. Superior Court (2006) 141
Cal.App.4th 1452, 1481, emphasis added.) A plaintiff seeking injunctive relief
must show the absence of an adequate damages remedy at law. (Code Civ. Proc. §
526(4); Thayer Plymouth Center, Inc. v. Chrysler Motors (1967) 255
Cal.App.2d 300, 307.)   
 
The trial court considers two factors in determining
whether to issue a preliminary injunction: (1) the likelihood the
plaintiff will prevail on the merits of its case at trial, and (2) the
interim harm the plaintiff is likely to sustain if the injunction is denied as
compared to the harm the defendant is likely to suffer if the court grants a
preliminary injunction. (Code Civ. Proc. § 526(a); Husain v.
McDonald’s Corp. (2012) 205 Cal.App.4th 860, 866-67, emphasis added.) The
balancing of harm between the parties “involves consideration of such things as
the inadequacy of other remedies, the degree of irreparable harm, and the
necessity of preserving the status quo.” (Husain, supra, 205 Cal.App.4th
at 867.) Thus, a preliminary injunction may not issue without some showing of
potential entitlement to such relief.  (Doe v. Wilson (1997) 57
Cal.App.4th 296, 304.) The decision to grant a preliminary injunction generally
lies within the sound discretion of the trial court and will not be disturbed
on appeal absent an abuse of discretion. (Thornton v. Carlson (1992) 4
Cal.App.4th 1249, 1255.) While a court must consider both factors in
making its decision, it may deny a preliminary injunction if either of the
two factors alone would support a ruling denying relief. (See Jessen
v. Keystone Savings & Loan Assn. (1983) 142 Cal.App.3d 454, 459.)
 
Discussion
 
Plaintiff
seeks an injunction for an order to compel the HOA to, effectively, remove
Hsieh and Lee from the board of directors. 
 
The court, however, need not address whether
plaintiff will prevail on the merits[1]
as Plaintiff has not provided evidence let alone discussed a fundamental
requirement of equitable relief: irreparable harm. (See also Opp. p. 6, citing Korean
Philadelphia Presbyterian Church v. California Presbytery (2000) 77
Cal.App.4th 1069, 1084 [irreparable harm must be imminent as opposed to a mere
possibility of harm sometime in the future]. Absent a showing of irreparable
harm, a showing of which is Plaintiff’s burden, injunctive relief is
unwarranted.  
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the
foregoing, the motion is DENIED.
