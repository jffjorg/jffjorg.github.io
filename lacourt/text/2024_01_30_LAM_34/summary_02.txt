And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on the motion for sanctions previously set. The motion has been denied, and monetary sanctions are awarded in favor of the judgment debtor and against the judgment creditor and their counsel, jointly and severally, in the amount of $550.00. The bench warrant on the judgment debtor is quashed, as the judgment has been fully satisfied. The judge also denied the judgment debtor's concise supplemental briefing, which was a motion for reconsideration of the award of monetary sanctions. The judge found that the motion for sanctions was frivolous and that the judgment debtor's counsel had spent an unreasonable amount of time on the opposition. The judge ordered the judgment creditor and their counsel to pay reasonable expenses, including attorney's fees, incurred as a result of the frivolous motion.
