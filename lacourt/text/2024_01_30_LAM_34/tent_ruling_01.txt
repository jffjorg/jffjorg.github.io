BACKGROUND:
 
On July 28, 2021, Family Choice Private Duty Agency, Inc.
(“FCPDA”) filed its Complaint against Kamerron Easton (“Easton”) and James P.
Ashby (“Ashby”) on causes of action for breach of contract, breach of covenant
of good faith and fair dealing, and commons counts. 
 
On October 15, 2021, Easton, who is an attorney
litigating in propria persona, filed his Cross-Complaint against FCPDA
and Shellydale Princess Gray (“Gray”).
 
On October 22, 2021, Easton filed his Answer to the
Complaint. 
 
On February 8, 2022, the Court sustained in part FCPDA
and Gray’s Demurrer to the Cross-Complaint. Specifically, the Court sustained
the Demurrer to the first and sixth causes of action in the Cross-Complaint,
for breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing and intentional
infliction of emotional distress, respectively. 
 
On March 10, 2022, FCPDA and Gray filed their Answer to
the Cross-Complaint. 
 
On May 6, 2022, FCPDA and Gray filed their Amended Answer
to the Cross-Complaint. 
 
On October 7, 2022, Ashby filed his Answer to the
Complaint. 
 
On multiple dates in 2023 (including March 14, March 16,
March 21, March 28, and May 9), the Court granted or granted in part various
motions filed by Easton against Gray and FCPDA. 
 
        On March 27, 2023, Easton filed: (1)
Motion to Compel Further Responses, Without Objections, to Special
Interrogatories, Set No. 1 and Request for Order Awarding Monetary Discovery
Sanctions Against Cross-Defendant and Defense Counsel for Reasonable Expenses
Actually Incurred (“Easton’s Further SROGs Motion Against Gray”); and (2)
Motion to Compel Further Responses, Without Objections, to Special
Interrogatories, Set No. 1 and Request for Order Awarding Monetary Discovery
Sanctions Against Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant and Defense Counsel for Reasonable
Expenses Actually Incurred (“Easton’s Further SROGs Motion Against FCPDA”).
 
        On April 7, 2023, Easton filed his
Motion to Compel Further Responses, Without Objections, to Demand for
Inspection, Set No. 1 and Request for Order Awarding Monetary Discovery
Sanctions against Cross-Defendant and Cross-Defense Counsel (“Easton’s Further
RPDs Motion Against Gray”). 
 
        On April 14, 2023, Easton filed his
Motion for Order (Further Verified Responses as this Court Ordered on
3/21/2023), and Request for Order Awarding Monetary Discovery Sanctions,
Issues, Evidentiary and/or Contempt Sanctions are Warranted (“Easton’s Motion
Compelling Ordered Further Responses Against Gray”). 
 
        On May 15, 2023, Easton filed his Motion
to Deem the Truth of Matters Specified in Request for Admissions, Set No. 3 Admitted
and for Imposition of Monetary Discovery Sanctions Against Cross-Defendant and
Cross-Defense Counsel (“Easton’s Motion to Deem Admitted RFAs Against Gray”). 
 
        On May 17, 2023, Easton filed his Motion
for Monetary Sanctions for Violations of Court Orders (Court Orders Dated:
03/21/2023 and 03/28/2023) (“Easton’s Motions for Monetary Sanctions Against
Gray”). 
 
        On June 30, 2023, Gray filed: (1)
Opposition to Easton’s Motions for Orders, to Compel Responses, Without
Objections, Deem Request for Admissions (Set 3) Admitted, and for Sanctions
(“Gray’s Combined Opposition”); and (2) Proof of Service. 
 
        On October 25, 2023, the Court ordered
FCPDA to provide initial responses to form interrogatories (“FROGs”) and
requests for production of documents (“RPDs”) propounded by Ashby within
fourteen days. The Court also deemed admitted the requests for admission
(“RFAs”) propounded by Ashby against FCPDA. 
 
        On December 21, 2023, Ashby filed: (1)
Motion to Issue Terminating Sanctions for Failure to Produce Documents Pursuant
to Court Order and for Sanctions (“Ashby’s RPDs Motion for Terminating
Sanctions Against FCPDA”); and (2) Motion to Issue Terminating Sanctions for
Failure to Comply with Court Order and Request for Sanctions (“Ashby’s FROGs
Motion for Terminating Sanctions Against FCPDA”). Ashby filed Declaration of
William F. Clark for each of these motions. 
 
        On January 2, 2024, by request of FCPDA,
the Clerk’s Office dismissed with prejudice Ashby from the Complaint. 
 

ANALYSIS:
 
 
I.         
Ashby’s
Motions for Terminating Sanctions
 
Ashby filed two motions for
terminating sanctions. However, Ashby, who has since been dismissed with
prejudice from the Complaint, is no longer a party to this matter. 
 
Ashby’s
RPDs Motion for Terminating Sanctions Against FCPDA is DENIED as moot. 
 
Ashby’s
FROGs Motion for Terminating Sanctions Against FCPDA is DENIED as moot. 
 
 
 
II.       Easton’s Discovery Motions
 
Easton filed six discovery motions
from March 27, 2023 through May 17, 2023. 
 
        Gray filed a
combined opposition to these motions on June 30, 2023. Gray’s combined opposition
lacked a signed declaration. 
 
        No reply or
subsequent response has been filed. 
 
        At the hearing
on these six discovery motions, the Parties should update the Court on the
status of the discovery requests. If the responses to the discovery requests
remain outstanding, the Parties will be provided time to file a sur-reply and a
sur-rebuttal. If responses to the discovery requests have been served, the
motions will be denied as moot. 
 
        The Court notes
that sanctions for Easton, who is an attorney litigating this matter in
propria persona, may only include costs, not attorney’s fees. (Kravitz
v. Super. Ct. (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 1015, 1020.)
