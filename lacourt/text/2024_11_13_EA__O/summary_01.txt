Here is the summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's motions to compel responses to discovery requests and sanctions. The plaintiff's counsel sent meet and confer letters to the defendant, but the defendant failed to respond. The plaintiff's counsel provided additional extensions for the defendant to respond, but the defendant has not served responses or opposition. The court orders the defendant to provide complete, full, and verified responses to the discovery requests. The court also awards sanctions in the amount of $1,920.00 to the plaintiff's counsel. The defendant's failure to respond to the discovery requests and the additional extensions provided by the plaintiff's counsel justify the imposition of monetary sanctions.
