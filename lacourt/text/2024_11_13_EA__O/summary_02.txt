And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling suggests that Maria, the owner of the property, intends to hold both the Plaintiff (mother of the child) and Lucia (owner of the dog) responsible for the accident that occurred on Maria's property. According to Maria, the Plaintiff is responsible because she was aware of the dog on the property, while Lucia is responsible because she did not obey the no dog policy and continues to live on the property despite an unlawful detainer action. The judge notes that, according to case law, an estate cannot be sued, and therefore the estate of the decedent is not a party to the case. The judge's ruling is based on the information presented by Maria, including the fact that the Plaintiff and Lucia are tenants on the property, separated by a gate, and that Lucia was served with an unlawful detainer action.
