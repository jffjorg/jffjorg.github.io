BOARD
Case No. 22STCP04162
Hearing Date: November 17, 2023
 
 
[Tentative]       ORDER
DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
                             
                             UPON
PROOF OF SERVICE AS ORDERED
 
                                                                                                                                                                                            
 
Petitioner, Lionel C. Williams, filed his unverified
163-page petition for writ of mandate on November 22, 2022. The petition
includes three exhibits.
 
On March 3, 2023, the court conducted a trial setting
conference. The court discussed the administrative record. As Petitioner had
not yet requested Respondent, the California Unemployment Insurance Appeals
Board (CUIAB), to prepare the administrative record, the court continued the
trial setting conference.
 
On April 14, 2023, at the continued trial setting
conference, the CUIAB represented Petitioner had requested the administrative
record, and it had been mailed to Petitioner. The court then set trial for
today’s date. The court ordered Petitioner to file his opening brief at least
60 calendar days before trial. The court also ordered the CUIAB to give notice.
 
While the court has no record of the CUIAB providing
timely notice to Petitioner, the court notes the CUIAB filed its notice of
non-receipt of Petitioner’s opening brief on September 27, 2023. The notice
advised of today’s trial date, the due date for the opening brief and that
Petitioner had not filed or served his opening brief. The CUIAB, however,
served the notice electronically to the wrong email address—to LIONEL982@ME.COM instead of LIONEL1982@ME.COM. There is no
evidence the CUIAB served the notice by first-class mail.
 
Accordingly, the court does not have good notice for
today’s hearing and cannot proceed. (Alternatively, if the CUIAB does has
provided notice and can file proof of same, the court will proceed.)
 
Petitioner has not lodged the certified administrative
record with the court as ordered on April 14, 2023.
 
It is the Petitioner’s burden to demonstrate error by
the CUIAB. Without a certified administrative record, Petitioner cannot meet
his burden. The court may not grant a petition for a writ of mandate where a
petitioner fails to produce an adequate administrative record. (See Elizabeth
D. v. Zolin (1993) 21 Cal.App.4th 347, 350 and Hothem v. City and County
of San Francisco I1986) 186 Cal.App.3d 702, 705.) Where no administrative
record has been provided, “ ‘the presumption of regularity will prevail, since the
burden falls on the petitioner attacking the administrative decision to
demonstrate to the trial court where the administrative proceedings were
unfair, were in excess of jurisdiction, or showed prejudicial abuse of
discretion.’ ” (Elizabeth D. v. Zolin, supra, 21 Cal.App.4th at 354 [cleaned
up].)
 
Petitioner has also failed to file an opening brief.
Petitioner has therefore waived any claims alleged in the petition. Petitioner bears
the burden of proof in these proceedings and the failure to file an opening
brief and administrative record means that Petitioner has not met this burden.
(Manriquez v. Gourley (2003) 105 Cal.App.4th 1227, 1233 [“[T]he
party challenging the administrative decision bears the burden of
convincing the court that the administrative findings are contrary to the
weight of the evidence.”]; Weinberg v. Cedars-Sinai Medical Center (2004)
119 Cal.App.4th 1098, 1107. [“Generally, ‘[i]n
a section 1094.5 proceeding, it is the responsibility of the
petitioner to produce a sufficient record of the administrative proceedings; “.
. . otherwise the presumption of regularity will prevail . . . .” ’ ”] See also City of South San Francisco v.
Board of Equalization (2014) 232 Cal.App.4th 707, 720 [“in mandate
proceeding brought under Code Civ. Proc. § 1085,
petitioner always bears burden of proof”]; South
Orange County Wastewater Authority v. City of Dana Point (2011) 196
Cal.App.4th 1604, 1612. [“Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1085,
review of quasi-legislative actions is limited to an inquiry into whether the
action was arbitrary, capricious or entirely lacking in evidentiary support, .
. . [and] [t]he petitioner has the burden of proof to show that the decision is
unreasonable or invalid as a matter of law.” (Cleaned up.)]) 
 
Evidence
Code section 664 also creates a presumption “that official duty has been
regularly performed.” (Evid. Code § 664.) Given the presumption and
Petitioner’s burden in mandamus, it follows that Petitioner has not met his
burden—that is, has not overcome the presumption of regularity contained in
Evidence Code section 664—where he files no opening brief demonstrating error.
 
Moreover,
California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1103 provides writ petitions are considered
law and motion matters. (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1103, subd. (a)(2).) A
memorandum must be filed in support of a law and motion matter. (Cal. Rules of
Court, Rule 3.112, subd. (a)(3).) A party filing a motion “must serve and file
a supporting memorandum.” (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.113, subd. (a).) The
memorandum must set forth “a statement of facts, a concise statement of the
law, evidence and arguments relief on, and a discussion of statutes, cases, and
textbooks cited in support of the position advanced.” (Id. at subd.
(b).) The failure to file a memorandum may be construed by the court as an
admission the motion “is not meritorious and cause for its denial.” (Id. at
subd. (a).)
 
Based on the foregoing, the petition
is denied. The court finds Petitioner failed to demonstrate agency error.
