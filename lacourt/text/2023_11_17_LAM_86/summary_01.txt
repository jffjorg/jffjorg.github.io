And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the petition for a writ of mandate filed by Lionel C. Williams, a petitioner, against the California Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board (CUIAB). The petition alleged errors in the CUIAB's decision, but the court found that the petitioner had failed to meet his burden of proof.

The court noted that the CUIAB had provided notice of the trial date, but the notice was sent to the wrong email address and there was no evidence that it was served by first-class mail. The petitioner was also required to file an opening brief and a certified administrative record, but failed to do so.

The court cited various California court decisions, including Elizabeth D. v. Zolin and Manriquez v. Gourley, to support its conclusion that the petitioner had not met his burden of proof. The court also noted that the petitioner's failure to file a memorandum in support of the petition may be construed as an admission that the motion is not meritorious.

As a result, the court denied the petition and found that the petitioner had failed to demonstrate agency error.
