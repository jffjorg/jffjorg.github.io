And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is in response to a motion to strike certain parts of the First Amended Complaint filed by the State of California, the defendant. The motion seeks to strike three specific paragraphs of the complaint that allege violations of California's Information Privacy Act, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and negligent infliction of emotional distress. The plaintiff, Michele Hanisee, a former Deputy District Attorney, alleges that the California Attorney General, Rob Bonta, leaked her and others' personally identifying information as a political stunt.

The Judge grants the motion to strike as to two of the paragraphs, finding that they are irrelevant and do not support the claims or defenses. However, the Judge denies the motion to strike as to the first paragraph, finding that it is relevant and supports the claims.

The Judge also addresses the plaintiff's request for declaratory and injunctive relief, finding that it is improper because the claims concern past wrongs and not ongoing controversies. The Judge grants the defendant's motion to strike the portions of the complaint seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.

Finally, the Judge addresses the plaintiff's request for exemplary damages, finding that it is improper because the defendant is immune from liability as a state employee acting in their official capacity.
