And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in this case, which addresses the plaintiff's claims for declaratory relief and exemplary damages against the defendants. The plaintiff seeks to prevent the defendants from publicly disclosing her home address, date of birth, and CII Number, which are contained in her CCW permit. The judge grants the plaintiff's request for preliminary and permanent injunctive relief to prevent further dissemination or publication of this information.

The judge also grants the plaintiff's request for a declaration by the court under Code of Civil Procedure section 1060, which will clarify the rights, responsibilities, and obligations of the parties to one another. This declaration will also specify the steps that the defendants must take to safeguard and refrain from publicly disclosing the plaintiff's information.

The judge rejects the defendant's motion to strike exemplary damages against the "DOE defendants" who work for a public entity. The court notes that the parties do not dispute that public entities are shielded from punitive damages, but the defendant is seeking to strike exemplary damages against specific individuals who are not public entities.

The judge also notes that the plaintiff's alternative argument cuts both ways, and that the plaintiff is welcome to request leave to file an amended complaint if she discovers evidence to support declaratory relief.
