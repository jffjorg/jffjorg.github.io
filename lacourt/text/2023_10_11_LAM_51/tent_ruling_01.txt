STATEMENT OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS: 
 
On April 7, 2023, Plaintiff Deputy
District Attorney Michele Hanisee (Plaintiff) filed a Complaint against
Defendant State of California (Defendant).
 
On June 15, 2023, Plaintiff filed a
First Amended Complaint (FAC) and served it via electronic service on
Defendant’s counsel. The FAC has five causes of action for: (1) Violation of
California’s Information Privacy Act; (2) Violation of Right to Privacy Under
Article 1, Section1 of the California Constitution; (3) Intentional Infliction
of Emotional Distress; (4) Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress; and (5)
Public Disclosure of Private Facts.[4]
 
Plaintiff was a Deputy District
Attorney who prosecuted criminal matters.[5]
Plaintiff alleges that on June 27, 2022, California Attorney General Rob Bonta
leaked Plaintiff’s and others’ personally identifying information concerning
concealed carry weapons (CCW) permits as a political stunt.  Specifically, Plaintiff identifies an online
portal that allows public users to download an excel spreadsheet containing
information about CCW holders. (FAC ¶¶ 16-19.) Plaintiff alleges that the
Department of Justice took the portal down on June 28, 2022. (FAC ¶ 20.)  
 
Defendant timely filed the instant
motion to strike on July 18, 2023. (CCP § 1010.6(a)(3)(B).) Plaintiff timely
filed an opposition on September 28, 2023. Defendant timely filed a reply on October
4, 2023.
 
LEGAL STANDARD: 
 
Request for
Judicial Notice
 
The court grants Plaintiff’s request for
judicial notice as to Exhibit A. (Evid. Code § 452(c), (h); See Kalnoki v. First American Trustee Servicing
Solutions, LLC (2017) 8
Cal.App.5th 23,37.) However, the court only takes judicial notice of the
foregoing documents only as to “the existence, content and authenticity of
public records and other specified documents”; it does not take judicial notice
of the truth of the factual matters asserted in those documents. (Dominguez v. Bonta (2022) 87 Cal. App.
5th 389, 400.)¿ 
 
Motion to Strike
 
The court may, upon a motion, or at any
time in its discretion, and upon terms it deems proper, strike any irrelevant,
false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading. (Code Civ. Proc., (CCP) §
436(a).) The court may also strike all or any part of any pleading not drawn or
filed in conformity with the laws of this state, a court rule, or an order of
the court. (Id., § 436(b).) The
grounds for moving to strike must appear on the face of the pleading or by way
of judicial notice. (Id.¿§¿437.)¿“When
the defect which justifies striking a complaint is capable of cure, the court
should allow leave to amend.” (Vaccaro v.
Kaiman¿(1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 761, 768.) 
 
Irrelevant matter includes:
allegations not essential to the claim or defense, allegations “neither
pertinent to nor supported by an otherwise sufficient claim or defense,” or a
demand for judgment “requesting relief not supported by the allegations of the
complaint or cross-complaint.” (CCP § 431.10(b).) 
 
Meet and Confer
 
Prior to filing a demurrer, the
demurring party is required to satisfy their meet and confer obligations
pursuant to Code of Civ. Proc. §430.41, and demonstrate that they so satisfied
their meet and confer obligation by submitting a declaration pursuant to Code
of Civ. Proc. §430.41(a)(2) & (3). The Declaration of Laura
Lively Babashoff indicates that the parties met and conferred on July 12, 2023,
but were unable to resolve the issues. (Dec. Babashoff, ¶¶ 2-4.) 
 
ANALYSIS: 
 
Declaratory Relief
 
Defendant argues that declaratory
relief is improper because Plaintiff’s claims concern past wrongs, not an
ongoing controversy. Plaintiff contends that Defendant still possesses
Plaintiff’s data, has not dispossessed the data, destroyed it, or otherwise
provided legally enforceable assurances that they will not publish the data
again.[6]
(See also RJN Ex. A[7].)
Alternatively, plaintiff argues that now is not the appropriate time for this
challenge since parties have not yet conducted discovery.[8]

 
A plaintiff’s
declaratory relief complaint must specifically allege that an actual, present
controversy exists, and must state the facts of the respective claims
concerning the disputed subject matter.[9]
(City of Cotati v. Cashman (2002) 29
Cal.4th 69, 79; Connerly v.
Schwarzenegger (2007) 146 Cal.App.4th 739, 746 (Connerly).) A sufficient complaint: (1) sets forth facts showing
the existence of an actual controversy relating to the parties’ legal rights
and duties, and (2) requests the court to adjudge these rights and duties. (Ludgate Ins. Co. v. Lockheed Martin Corp.
(2000) 82 Cal.App.4th 592, 606; Qualified
Patients Ass’n v. City of Anaheim (2010) 187 Cal.App.4th 734, 751; see also
Travers v. Louden (1967)
254.Cal.App.2d 926, 931-32 (Travers) [commenting
that declaratory relief may be appropriate for parties with a continuing
relationship].) A declaratory relief claim should not be used to determine
issues that are already engaged by other causes of action. (Hood v. Superior Court (1995) 33
Cal.App.4th 319, 324.)
 
In Connerly, the plaintiff sought declaratory relief that a law was
unconstitutional and to prevent the government from enforcing it. (Connerly, supra, at 746.) The Court of Appeals found no actual controversy
because the Supreme Court definitively ruled that the challenged law was
unconstitutional and there were no allegations that the State threatened to
enforce the law anyway. (Id. at p. 747.)
Like Connerly, where the offending
law was definitively resolved, here, the FAC alleges that the CA DOJ
“permanently” took the firearms data web portal offline on June 28, 2022. (FAC
¶ 20.) In other words, Plaintiff acknowledges that they are seeking declaratory
relief for a past wrong, not an ongoing controversy. Moreover, there does not
appear to be any dispute that the disclosure of this information, if it
occurred again, would be wrongful. Stated otherwise, there is no present dispute
or threat of a future dispute relating to the parties’ legal rights and duties.

Accordingly, Plaintiff’s request that
the court Order Defendant to do more than take down the website by articulating
“further steps [they] must take to safeguard and refrain from publicly
disclosing information obtained or kept by Defendants as a result of
Plaintiff’s application for or holding of a CCW permit” (Prayer ¶ 4)  is not really a prayer for Declaratory Relief,
but rather, Plaintiff is essentially requesting the court: (1)  to remind Defendant of its duty to follow the
law and (2) to have Defendant provide Plaintiff a plan on they will follow the
law in the future. (Prayer ¶ 4.) Plaintiff provides no authority to support
this two-fold request as a appropriately labeled Declaratory Relief.  
Accordingly, the court GRANTS
Defendant’s Motion to Strike the portions of the FAC that seek declaratory
relief.
 
Injunctive Relief
 
            The parties
raise the same arguments regarding Plaintiff’s request for injunctive relief as
for declaratory relief.
 
“[I]njunctive
relief lies only to prevent threatened injury and has no application to wrongs
that have been completed.” (Huntingdon
Life Sciences, Inc. v. Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty USA, Inc. (2005) 129
Cal.App.4th 1228, 1266.)
 
            Plaintiff’s
request for injunctive relief fails for the same reasons as her request for
declaratory relief. Plaintiff has not alleged a threatened future injury, but
only an injury that occurred wholly in the past. (FAC ¶¶ 5, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20,
21.)[10]

 
            Accordingly,
the court GRANTS Defendant’s Motion to Strike the portions of the FAC that seek
injunctive relief.
 
Exemplary Damages
 
            Defendant
argues that Plaintiff cannot seek exemplary damages against the DOE defendants
because they are immune by acting under their official capacity as state
employees. Plaintiff contends that the FAC does not seek exemplary damages from
immune employees.
 
            A plaintiff
cannot recover punitive, or exemplary, damages from government employees acting
solely in their official capacity. (Gov. Code § 818; see Civ. Code § 1798.53
[“other than an employee of the state or of a local government agency acting
solely in his or her official capacity”].)
 
            Upon
reviewing the FAC, the court declines to delve into Defendant’s argument to
strike the exemplary damages request because the request is not directed at
Defendant.[11]

 
            Accordingly,
the court DENIED Defendant’s Motion to Strike the portions of the First Amended
Complaint pertaining to the request for exemplary damages.
 
CONCLUSION:
 
            For
the foregoing reasons, the Court decides the pending motion as follows: 
 
1.      
Defendant’s
Motion to Strike is DENIED as to Page 15, line 17 of the First Amended
Complaint;
2.      
Defendant’s
Motion to Strike is GRANTED as to Page 15, lines 18-22 of the First Amended
Complaint; and
3.      
Defendant’s
Motion to Strike is GRANTED as to Page 15, line 23 – Page 16, line 2 from the
First Amended Complaint.
Moving party is to give notice. 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
