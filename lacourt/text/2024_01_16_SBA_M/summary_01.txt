Roles:
- Plaintiff (Eunmin Kim)
- Defendant (Andrew Lwin)
- Judge (Gary Y. Tanaka)
Significant Statements:
- "The trial court may order a terminating sanction for discovery abuse 'after considering the totality of the circumstances: [the] conduct of the party to determine if the actions were willful; the detriment to the propounding party; and the number of formal and informal attempts to obtain the discovery.'"
- "Generally, '[a] decision to order terminating sanctions should not be made lightly. But where a violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction.'"
```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Defendant Andrew Lwin's motion for terminating sanctions and monetary sanctions, as well as his motion for reconsideration. The judge found that Defendant failed to comply with a court order and did not provide sufficient evidence to warrant reconsideration of the previous order. The judge noted that Defendant's failure to comply with the court order was willful and preceded by a history of abuse, and that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules. The judge also admonished Defendant for again asserting the same motion, which was previously denied.
