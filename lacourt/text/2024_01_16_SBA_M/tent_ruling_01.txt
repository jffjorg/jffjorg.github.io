            Background
 
            Plaintiff filed the Complaint on March 25, 2020. Plaintiff
alleges the following facts. Plaintiff was a tenant and rented a room from
Defendant. Defendant sexually harassed Plaintiff on numerous occasions.
Defendant then evicted Plaintiff when she refused Defendant’s advances and assaulted
and battered her when she warned other potential tenants.  Plaintiff alleges causes of action for: 1. Retaliatory
Eviction; 2. Breach of the Implied Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment; 3. Constructive
Eviction; 4. Battery; 5. Assault; 6. IIED; 7. NIED; 8. Violation of Gov. Code
12955(a); 9. Violation of Gov. Code 12955(f); 10. Violation of Civ. Code 51.9;
11. Violation of California Code of Regulations 12120. 
 
            On September 21, 2023, Defendant’s motion for terminating
sanctions and monetary sanctions was denied. On October 24, 2023, Defendant’s
motion for terminating sanctions and monetary sanctions was denied.
 
            Motion for
Terminating Sanctions 
 
            If a party fails to comply with a court order compelling
discovery responses or attendance at a deposition, the court may impose
monetary, issue, evidence, or terminating sanctions.  CCP § 2025.450(h) (depositions); §
2030.290(c) (interrogatories); § 2031.300(c) (demands for production of
documents).  CCP § 2023.030 provides
that, “[t]o the extent authorized by the chapter governing any particular
discovery method . . . , the court, after notice to any affected party, person,
or attorney, and after opportunity for hearing, may impose . . .  [monetary, issue, evidence, or terminating]
sanctions against anyone engaging in conduct that is a misuse of the discovery
process . . . .”  Code of Civil Procedure
§ 2023.010 provides that “[m]isuses of the discovery process include, but are
not limited to, the following:  . .
.  (d) Failing to respond or to submit to
an authorized method of discovery. . . . (g) Disobeying a court order to
provide discovery. . . . .”  
 
            “The trial court may order a terminating sanction for
discovery abuse ‘after considering the totality of the circumstances:  [the] conduct of the party to determine if
the actions were willful; the detriment to the propounding party; and the
number of formal and informal attempts to obtain the discovery.’”  Los
Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez (2014) 223 Cal. App. 4th 377, 390
(quoting Lang v. Hochman (2000) 77
Cal. App. 4th 1225, 1246).  “Generally,
‘[a] decision to order terminating sanctions should not be made lightly.  But where a violation is willful, preceded by
a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not
produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial court is justified in
imposing the ultimate sanction.’”  Los Defensores, 223 Cal. App. 4th
at 390 (citation omitted).   
   
            “Under this standard, trial courts have properly imposed
terminating sanctions when parties have willfully disobeyed one or more
discovery orders.”  Los Defensores, 223 Cal. App. 4th at 390 (citing Lang, 77 Cal. App. 4th at 1244-1246
(discussing cases)); see, e.g., Collisson & Kaplan v. Hartunian
(1994) 21 Cal. App. 4th 1611, 1617-1622 (terminating sanctions imposed after
defendants failed to comply with one court order to produce discovery); Laguna Auto Body v. Farmers Ins. Exchange
(1991) 231 Cal. App. 3d 481, 491, disapproved on other grounds in Garcia v. McCutchen (1997) 16 Cal. 4th
469, 478, n. 4 (terminating sanctions imposed against plaintiff for failing to
comply with a discovery order and for violating various discovery statutes).
 
            The type of severe sanctions sought by plaintiff such as
issue, evidentiary, and terminating sanctions for failure to comply with a
court order are allowed only where the failure was willful.  See
R.S. Creative, Inc. v. Creative Cotton, Ltd. (1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 486,
495; See also Vallbona v. Springer (1996) 43 Cal.App.4th 1525, 1545; See also Biles v. Exxon Mobil Corp. (2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 1315,
1327.  
 
            “Doomsday” sanctions are reserved for parties who commit
willful, repeated, violations of court orders.  Los Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez
(2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 377, 390. 
“Generally, [a] decision to order terminating sanctions should not be
made lightly. But where a violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse,
and the evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance
with the discovery rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate
sanction.”  Id.  
 
            Defendant moves, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure §
2023.030, for terminating sanctions against Plaintiff, as well as monetary
sanctions. The motion is made on the grounds that Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s
counsel disobeyed the Court’s order of September 14, 2023 to serve verified
responses within 10 days to Defendant’s Special Interrogatories, Set One, and
Request for Production of Documents, Set Two. 
 
            The Court directs the parties to the Court’s order of
October 24, 2023 denying this motion for terminating sanctions which was
brought upon the exact same grounds. The Court admonishes Defendant for again
asserting the very same motion which was previously denied.
 
            For the foregoing reasons, Defendant’s Motion for
Terminating Sanctions and Monetary Sanctions is denied. 
 
            Motion for Reconsideration
 
            CCP § 1008(a) states: “When an application for an order
has been made to a or to a court, and refused in whole or in part, or granted,
or granted conditionally, or on terms, any party affected by the order may,
within 10 days after service upon the party of written notice of entry of the
order and based upon new or different facts, circumstances, or law, make
application to the same judge or court that made the order, to reconsider the
matter and modify, amend, or revoke the prior order.  The party making the application shall state
by affidavit what application was made before, when and to what judge, what
order or decisions were made, and what new or different facts, circumstances,
or law are claimed to be shown.”  In
addition, the party seeking reconsideration must provide not just new or
different facts, circumstance, or law, but a satisfactory explanation for the
failure to produce it at an earlier time. See Garcia v. Hejmadi (1997)
58 Cal.App.4th 674, 690. 
 
            Pursuant to CCP § 1008, Defendant moves for
reconsideration of the October 24, 2023 order denying Defendant’s motion for
terminating sanctions. Defendant argues that he did, in fact, give notice of
the Court’s September 14, 2023 ruling on September 14, 2023. Defendant argues
that he did file the motion within 16 court days of the hearing date. Defendant
states that the rejection of the filing was due to Court error.  
 
            Plaintiff’s motion is denied because Defendant fails to
provide new facts, circumstances, or law to warrant reconsideration of the
Court’s prior order. First, the contention that notice was timely provided on
September 14, 2023 is conclusory, self-serving, and not supported with
corroborating evidence.  Second,
Defendant did not file the motion on October 2, 2023, but instead on October 9,
2023. The attempt to file the motion on October 2, 2023 was rejected not due to
Court error, but due to error by Defendant not utilizing the correct
reservation date.  In any event, ultimately,
the motion was officially deemed filed on October 9, 2023.  It was then incumbent upon Defendant to
ensure correct statutory notice was provided by arranging for a continuance of
the hearing date, since 11 court day notice was provided for the motion not 16
court days. 
 
            In addition, Defendant fails to provide any valid
explanation as to why the purported new facts were not presented earlier. Garcia
v. Hejmadi (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 674, 690. Defendant clearly had knowledge
of these purported facts at the time of the October 24, 2023 hearing and did
not present them to the Court at that time. If, in fact, these purported new
facts were presented at the hearing, then, the Court denied that motion with
knowledge of these facts and in consideration of these facts. Therefore, these
facts would then, not be considered “new” facts.
 
            Therefore, for the foregoing reasons, Defendant’s motion
for reconsideration is denied.
 
            Plaintiff is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
