## English Summary

The judge issued a tentative ruling denying the Defendant's motion to compel Plaintiff's expert depositions. The judge found that the Defendant did not provide enough evidence to show that the depositions were properly noticed and that expert witness fees were properly tendered. 

The judge also ruled that the Defendant, as the successor to the deceased original Defendant, has standing to bring the motion. However, due to the lack of evidence, the motion was denied without prejudice, meaning the Defendant can refile the motion with proper documentation.

Here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel the depositions of Plaintiff's experts, Steven Dunbar, D.C. and Babak Samimi, M.D. The Plaintiff filed a Complaint against Decedent, who passed away after the filing of the action. The Defendant, Jack Swank, was substituted as the personal representative of Decedent.

The Defendant argued that the depositions of the Plaintiff's experts were properly noticed, but the Plaintiff failed to produce them. The Judge noted that the Defendant's declaration referred to six exhibits in support of the motion, but none were attached to the declaration. The Judge also noted that it was unclear whether the Defendant tendered the expert witness fee or whether the parties stipulated otherwise.

The Judge denied the motion to compel the depositions of the Plaintiff's experts without prejudice. The Judge ordered the moving party to give notice of the ruling. The parties are encouraged to meet and confer to reach an agreement, and if a party intends to submit on the tentative ruling, they must send an email to the court with the subject line "SUBMIT" followed by the case number.

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling is regarding a motion to compel the depositions of Plaintiff's experts, Steven Dunbar, D.C. and Babak Samimi, M.D., in a case where the Plaintiff, Stephen Harris, is seeking damages from the Defendant, Jack Swank, for an automobile accident. The Defendant has since passed away, and the Court has granted a motion to substitute Judith Lorraine Swank as the personal representative of the Decedent. The Plaintiff opposes the motion, arguing that the Defendant lacks authority to bring the motion. However, the Court finds that the Defendant has the authority to bring the motion, as the personal representative of the Decedent. The Court also finds that the Defendant has not properly noticed the depositions, as the declaration in support of the motion does not include the necessary exhibits, and it is not clear whether the expert witness fees were tendered. Therefore, the motion is denied without prejudice. The parties are encouraged to meet and confer to reach an agreement, and if they cannot, they should arrange to appear remotely or in person for oral argument.
