The judge issued a tentative ruling denying the Defendant's motion to compel Plaintiff's expert depositions. The judge found that the Defendant did not provide enough evidence to show that the depositions were properly noticed and that expert witness fees were properly tendered. 

The judge also ruled that the Defendant, as the successor to the deceased original Defendant, has standing to bring the motion. However, due to the lack of evidence, the motion was denied without prejudice, meaning the Defendant can refile the motion with proper documentation.

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling is regarding a motion to compel the depositions of Plaintiff's experts, Steven Dunbar, D.C. and Babak Samimi, M.D., in a case where the Plaintiff, Stephen Harris, is seeking damages from the Defendant, Jack Swank, for an automobile accident. The Defendant has since passed away, and the Court has granted a motion to substitute Judith Lorraine Swank as the personal representative of the Decedent. The Plaintiff opposes the motion, arguing that the Defendant lacks authority to bring the motion. However, the Court finds that the Defendant has the authority to bring the motion, as the personal representative of the Decedent. The Court also finds that the Defendant has not properly noticed the depositions, as the declaration in support of the motion does not include the necessary exhibits, and it is not clear whether the expert witness fees were tendered. Therefore, the motion is denied without prejudice. The parties are encouraged to meet and confer to reach an agreement, and if they cannot, they should arrange to appear remotely or in person for oral argument.

Judge Michelle Kim has issued a tentative ruling regarding a motion to compel the depositions of Plaintiff's experts in the case 18STCV01564. The Plaintiff, Stephen Harris, filed a Complaint against Defendant Jack Swank for damages arising from an automobile accident. Judith Lorraine Swank was later substituted as the personal representative of Jack Swank. Defendant filed a motion to compel the depositions of Plaintiff's experts, Steven Dunbar, D.C. and Babak Samimi, M.D. However, the Court denied the motion due to a lack of evidence regarding the proper notice and tender of expert witness fees.

The Judge addressed several issues raised by the parties, including Defendant's argument that Plaintiff's opposition was untimely and that Plaintiff still had not served the amended complaint on Swank. The Judge decided to consider Plaintiff's opposition and found no prejudice in receiving it through email at 12:01 a.m. instead of 11:59 p.m. on the due date. The Judge also determined that Plaintiff provided no authority supporting the contention that the motion was now improper or that the Court may not consider the motion when Swank has stepped into the place of Decedent.

Additionally, the Judge decided not to consider Defendant's argument regarding the service of the amended complaint, as it was raised for the first time in the reply brief. The Judge stated that the purpose of a reply brief is not to raise new issues. The Judge also mentioned that the time had not yet expired for Defendant to properly set forth this argument.

The Judge then discussed the motion to compel the deposition of Plaintiff's experts. The Judge noted that it is not clear whether Defendant properly noticed Steven Dunbar, D.C.'s and Babak Samimi, M.D.'s depositions, as Defense counsel's declaration refers to six exhibits in support of the motion, none of which were attached. The Court also could not determine if Defendant tendered the expert witness fee or if the parties stipulated otherwise. If no stipulation was made and Defendant failed to tender the fee with the deposition notice, then Steven Dunbar, D.C. and Babak Samimi, M.D. were not required to appear at the noticed deposition. Due to the lack of evidence and the issue regarding the expert witness fees, the motion was denied without prejudice.
