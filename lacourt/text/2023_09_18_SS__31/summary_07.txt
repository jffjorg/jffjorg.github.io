## English Summary

The judge issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel discovery filed by 21st Century Insurance Company against Samuel Yun.

The defendant argued that Yun failed to provide timely and verified responses to initial discovery requests.  The judge agreed, finding that Yun's responses were untimely because they lacked verifications, even though they were served within the time limit. The judge also found that Yun's opposition to the motion was untimely and therefore wouldn't consider it. 

Therefore, the judge granted the defendant's motion to compel, ordering Yun to provide verified responses to the discovery requests within 20 days. Additionally, the judge imposed sanctions of $480 against Yun and his attorney for unsuccessfully opposing the motion.
