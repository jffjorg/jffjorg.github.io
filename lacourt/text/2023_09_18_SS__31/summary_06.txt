And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses a motion by defendant Hertz Corporation to stay all further proceedings in the action. Hertz filed a petition for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 on May 22, 2020, and the automatic stay has been in place since then. The judge finds that the motion to stay proceedings against Hertz is moot because the automatic stay has already been in place for over three years. The judge also notes that the automatic stay only protects the debtor and does not extend to non-debtor co-defendants, such as defendant Dyllan William Williams. The judge orders the moving party to give notice and encourages the parties to meet and confer to reach an agreement. If a party intends to submit to the tentative ruling, they must send an email to the court with the specified information.
