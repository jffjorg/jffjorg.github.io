The judge's tentative ruling addresses a motion by defendant Hertz Corporation to stay all further proceedings in the action. Hertz filed a petition for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 on May 22, 2020, and the automatic stay has been in place since then. The judge finds that the motion to stay proceedings against Hertz is moot because the automatic stay has already been in place for over three years. The judge also notes that the automatic stay only protects the debtor and does not extend to non-debtor co-defendants, such as defendant Dyllan William Williams. The judge orders the moving party to give notice and encourages the parties to meet and confer to reach an agreement. If a party intends to submit to the tentative ruling, they must send an email to the court with the specified information.

**English Summary:**

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on Hertz's motion to stay the lawsuit due to its bankruptcy filing.  The judge notes that the automatic stay in bankruptcy applies only to the debtor (Hertz in this case) and not to non-debtor defendants (Williams). Therefore, the stay of proceedings against Hertz is considered moot since it has been in effect since 2020. However, the stay does not extend to Williams, so the case will proceed against him. The judge encourages the parties to meet and confer to see if they can reach an agreement and advises them on the procedure for submitting on the tentative ruling or appearing for oral argument.

## English Summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of *Imelda Barragan v. The Hertz Corporation and Dyllan William Williams*.  

The judge finds that because Hertz filed for bankruptcy in 2020, an automatic stay is in place preventing further legal proceedings against Hertz.

The judge has urged the parties to discuss the matter further and potentially reach an agreement.
