And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the request for default judgment submitted by Ernest Hill against Litco Entertainment Inc. on August 28, 2023. The denial is based on several reasons, including the fact that Hill has not dismissed all other parties involved in the case, including the Doe defendants. Additionally, Hill failed to provide a copy of the Statement of Damages and did not demonstrate proof of service of the Statement of Damages on Litco Entertainment Inc. prior to the entry of default. The judge has ordered Hill to correct these defects and submit a new default judgment package by a certain date. Failure to comply may result in sanctions, including monetary sanctions and/or dismissal.
