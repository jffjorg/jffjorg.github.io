Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiffs' motion to seal the complaint. The motion was filed in a contractual dispute between the parties, and the plaintiffs argued that the complaint contains confidential information and private financial information that should be kept from the public. However, the judge found that the proposed sealing is not narrowly tailored, as the plaintiffs aim to seal the entire document rather than just the relevant portions. The judge noted that court records are presumed to be open to the public unless confidentiality is required by law, and that a prior court order is necessary to seal documents. The judge cited several legal precedents, including Overstock.com, Inc. v. Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (2014) and NBC Subsidiary (KNBC-TV), Inc. v. Super. Ct. (Locke) (1999), to support the conclusion that the court cannot grant the motion to seal the complaint.
