 Case Number:  BC597857    Hearing Date:   February 28, 2024    Dept:  74 SoCal Diesel, Inc. v. Extrasensory
Software, Inc., et al.
 
Plaintiff SoCal Diesel Inc.’s Motion
to Compel Further Responses to Requests for Production of Documents (Set Two)
from Defendant Ira Emus
 
The
court considered the moving papers, opposition, and reply.
BACKGROUND
            This action arises from a dispute
over alleged misappropriation of trade secrets.
            In October 2015, Plaintiff SoCal
Diesel, Inc. (Plaintiff) filed a complaint against ExtraSensory Software, Inc.,
Robyn Emus, and Ira Emus (Defendant).
            On June 15, 2023, Plaintiff served
Defendant with requests for production of documents (RFPs).
            On July 28, 2023, Defendant served
Plaintiff with unverified responses. Plaintiff was dissatisfied.
            On September 14, 2023, Defendant
served supplemental responses. Plaintiff was still dissatisfied.
            The parties met and conferred to no
avail.
            On October 30, 2023, Plaintiff filed
this motion to compel further response to the RFPs.
LEGAL STANDARD 
            A
propounding party may move for an order compelling a further response to a
demand for inspection if the propounding party deems that an answer or
statement of compliance is evasive or incomplete, or that an objection is
“without merit or too general.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.310, subd. (a).) Such a motion must set forth specific facts showing
good cause for the discovery sought and be accompanied by a meet and confer
declaration. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2031.310, subd. (b), 2031.210, subd. (b).)
DISCUSSION
            Plaintiff first seeks further
response to RFP Nos. 12-16, which ask Defendant to produce documents he “gave
to [persons] for the preparation of, or advice regarding, [his] California
State and United States Federal tax returns for the year[s] of [2018-2022].” In
his supplemental responses, Defendant objects that the requests are irrelevant
and invokes the tax-return privilege. Plaintiff also seeks further response to
RFP Nos. 120 and 121, which target documents related to Defendant’s net worth. Last,
Plaintiff seeks further response to RFP No. 122, which concerns documents
related to payments Defendant received from ExtraSensory Software, Inc. from
2017 until the present. Defendant objects to RFP Nos. 120-122 on the grounds of
relevance and his privacy rights. 
            Plaintiff
contends Defendant waived his objections because he failed to assert them with
sufficient specificity in his initial responses to the RFPs. (Stadish v.
Sup.Ct. (Southern Calif. Gas Co.) (1999) 71 Cal.App.4th 1130, 1141.) Even
if Defendant waived his objections, though, he did not waive his right to pursue
a protective order. (Id. at p. 1144.) On February 5, 2024, Defendant
filed a motion for a protective order, whose hearing is set for March 12, 2024.
With that motion, Defendant seeks an order that he need not respond to any
discovery regarding his financial condition or profits until Plaintiff brings a
motion under Code of Civil Procedure section 3295, subdivision (c). To rule on
the RFPs at issue would therefore be premature. 
CONCLUSION
                The court continues the hearing to
March 12, 2024, as a placeholder date.
                Plaintiff shall give notice.
