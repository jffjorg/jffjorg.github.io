```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the motions to seal documents filed by Nominal Defendant Outlook Amusements, Inc. and Defendant Jason Freeland. The court has denied Nominal Defendant's motion to seal the entirety of Plaintiff Timothy Youd's motion to enforce the settlement agreement and supporting documents without prejudice, as Nominal Defendant failed to identify specific portions of the documents that would compromise their alleged overriding interests.

The court has granted in part Defendant's motion to seal their opposition to Plaintiff's motion to enforce the settlement agreement and supporting documents, allowing them to seal references to confidential settlement terms. However, the court has denied Defendant's request to seal other portions of their opposition, as they did not cite an overriding interest that would support the sealing of those documents.

The court has also denied Nominal Defendant and Defendant's motion to seal Plaintiff's reply in support of his motion to enforce the settlement agreement and supporting documents, as they failed to identify specific portions of the documents that would compromise their alleged overriding interests.

In making its ruling, the court applied the legal standard set forth in California Rules of Court, rule 2.550, which requires the court to find that an overriding interest exists, that the proposed sealing is narrowly tailored, and that no less restrictive means exist to achieve the overriding interest. The court has ordered the parties to give notice of its tentative ruling.
