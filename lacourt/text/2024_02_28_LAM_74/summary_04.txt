And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the moving papers, opposition, and reply in this case. The plaintiff, SoCal Diesel Inc., is seeking to compel the defendant, Ira Emus, to provide further responses to requests for production of documents (RFPs) regarding tax returns, net worth, and payments. The defendant objects to providing discovery regarding financial condition and profits, citing relevance and privacy rights. The court notes that the defendant waived his objections to the RFPs by failing to assert them with sufficient specificity in his initial responses. However, the defendant did not waive his right to pursue a protective order, which is currently set for hearing on March 12, 2024. The court concludes that it would be premature to rule on the RFPs at issue and continues the hearing to March 12, 2024, as a placeholder date. The plaintiff shall give notice.
