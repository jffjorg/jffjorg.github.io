Here is a summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses a demurrer filed by the Estate of Mark D. Croce against Robinson Helicopter Company, Inc.'s (Robinson) cross-complaint. The demurrer challenges the cross-complaint's causes of action, including total equitable indemnity, comparative indemnity, equitable apportionment of fault, contractual indemnity, contribution, and declaratory relief. The court overrules the demurrer for several causes of action, finding that Robinson's claims are not time-barred and that the Estate does not have a right to indemnification. The court also grants the Estate's motion to strike certain portions of the cross-complaint, including requests for attorney fees. The ruling concludes that the court will not strike the entire cross-complaint, and the Estate is given notice.
