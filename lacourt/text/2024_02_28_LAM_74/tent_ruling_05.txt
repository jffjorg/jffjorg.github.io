 Case Number:  BC665489    Hearing Date:   February 28, 2024    Dept:  74 Timothy Youd
v. Jason Freeland, et al.
Nominal Defendant Outlook
Amusements, Inc. and Defendant Jason Freeland’s Motion to Seal Plaintiff’s Motion
to Enforce the Settlement Agreement and Supporting Documents.
 
BACKGROUND
            This action arises from a business
dispute. 
            On
June 16, 2017, Plaintiff Timothy Youd (Plaintiff) filed a complaint against
Defendant Jason Freeland (Defendant).
            On
March 12, 2018, Nominal Defendant Outlook Amusements, Inc. (Nominal Defendant)
filed a cross-complaint against Plaintiff. 
            In
August 2019, the parties settled.
            On
August 4, 2023, Plaintiff filed a motion to enforce the settlement.
            On
August 14, 2023, Nominal Defendant filed this motion to seal Plaintiff’s motion
to enforce the settlement and supporting documents.
            On
August 17, 2023, Defendant filed a joinder to the motion to seal.
LEGAL STANDARD
            Unless confidentiality is required
by law, court records are presumed to be open to the public. (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 2.550, subd. (c).) Consequently, pleadings, motions, evidence, and
other papers may not be filed under seal merely by stipulation of the parties;
rather, a prior court order is necessary. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.551,
subd. (a).) 
            To
grant such an order, the court must expressly find that . . . “an overriding
interest exists that overcomes the right of public access to the record, an
overriding interest supports sealing the records, a substantial probability
exists that the overriding interest will be prejudiced if the record is not
sealed, the proposed sealing is narrowly tailored, and no less restrictive
means exist to achieve the overriding interest.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
2.550, subd. (d).) 
            If
the court fails to make the required findings, the order is deficient and
cannot support sealing. (Overstock.com, Inc. v. Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (2014)
231 Cal.App.4th 471, 487.) 
DISCUSSION  
            Nominal
Defendant and Defendant aim to seal the entirety of Plaintiff’s motion
to enforce the settlement agreement and the following supporting documents: the
parties’ settlement agreement, Plaintiff’s arbitration demand, and Plaintiff’s
declaration. But Nominal Defendant and Defendant have failed to identify in
their motion the specific portions of these documents that, if available to the
public, would compromise their alleged overriding interests. Consequently,
Nominal Defendant and Defendant’s request is not sufficiently narrowly tailored
for the purposes of their motion. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.550, subd. (d).)
CONCLUSION 
The
court denies Nominal Defendant and Defendant’s motion to seal without
prejudice.
Defendant
shall give notice.////////////Timothy Youd

Amusements, Inc. and Defendant Jason Freeland’s Motion to Seal Their Opposition
to Plaintiff’s Motion to Enforce the Settlement Agreement and Supporting
Documents.
 
BACKGROUND
            This action arises from a business
dispute. 
            On
June 16, 2017, Plaintiff Timothy Youd (Plaintiff) filed a complaint against
Defendant Jason Freeland.
            On
March 12, 2018, Nominal Defendant Outlook Amusements, Inc. filed a
cross-complaint against Plaintiff. 
            In
August 2019, the parties settled.
            On
August 4, 2023, Plaintiff filed a motion to enforce the settlement.
            On
September 8, Nominal Defendant and Defendant (Defendants) filed their
opposition to the motion to enforce the settlement. Defendants also filed this
motion to seal their opposition and supporting documents.
LEGAL STANDARD
            Unless confidentiality is required
by law, court records are presumed to be open to the public. (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 2.550, subd. (c).) Consequently, pleadings, motions, evidence, and
other papers may not be filed under seal merely by stipulation of the parties;
rather, a prior court order is necessary. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.551,
subd. (a).) 
            To
grant such an order, the court must expressly find that . . . “an overriding
interest exists that overcomes the right of public access to the record, an
overriding interest supports sealing the records, a substantial probability
exists that the overriding interest will be prejudiced if the record is not
sealed, the proposed sealing is narrowly tailored, and no less restrictive
means exist to achieve the overriding interest.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
2.550, subd. (d).) 
            If
the court fails to make the required findings, the order is deficient and
cannot support sealing. (Overstock.com, Inc. v. Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (2014)
231 Cal.App.4th 471, 487.) 
DISCUSSION  
            Defendants
first seek to seal portions of their opposition that disclose the parties’
settlement terms. To that end, Defendants point to the parties’ settlement
agreement, which contains a confidentiality provision. Under the provision, the
parties agreed to keep the terms and conditions of the agreement confidential.
(Motion, p. 4.) Defendants have an overriding interest in sealing references to
confidential settlement terms. (See Universal City Studios, Inc. v. Superior
Court (2003) 110 Cal.App.4th 1273, 1283.) This interest will be prejudiced
if the settlement terms are accessible to the public. Indeed, Defendants
contend they would not have entered the settlement without the confidentiality
provision. (Reply, p. 3:19-22.) To demonstrate they have narrowly tailored the
proposed sealing, Defendants have filed their opposition and supporting
declarations with proposed redactions and lodged on September 21, 2024,
unredacted versions for the court’s review. The court finds the proposed
redactions for the following portions of the opposition sufficiently narrowly
tailored: page 2, lines 9-11; page 3, lines 1-7, 15-16, 17-24, 27-28; page 4,
line 15; page 8, lines 17-19; page 9, lines 25-27; page 10, lines 4-6, 10-12,
22-25; page 11, lines 7-12, 13-20, 25-28. But the court does not find the
proposed redaction on page 8, lines 2-7 sufficiently narrowly tailored. Last,
the court finds the proposed redactions in the declarations of Aaron May and Michael
A. Taitelman are sufficient. (May Decl., ¶¶ 5, 8; Taitelman Decl., ¶ 4.) 
            Additionally,
Defendants aim to seal other portions of their opposition. Defendants claim the
opposition refers to their private financial information. This is a potential
overriding interest that would be compromised if the information were available
to the public. However, Defendants’ opposition and supporting documents do not
mention Defendants’ financial affairs. The court further notes that Defendants
wish to seal their descriptions of Plaintiff’s reform efforts. But Defendants
have not cited an overriding interest that would support the sealing of these
portions of their opposition.
CONCLUSION 
Based
on the foregoing, the court grants in part Defendants’ motion to seal their
opposition to Plaintiff’s motion to enforce the settlement agreement and
supporting documents.
