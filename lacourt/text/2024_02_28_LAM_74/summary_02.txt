And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to seal documents filed by the defendants. The motion seeks to seal portions of documents filed in support of the plaintiff's opposition to the defendants' motion for summary judgment and the defendants' reply. The judge has ruled that the defendants' motion to seal should be granted, finding that a legitimate interest supports sealing the documents. The judge has identified specific documents that contain third-party employee names, which are confidential and should not be publicly disclosed. The judge has also noted that the defendants have identified an overriding interest in sealing the documents, which includes the privacy interest of the third-party employees. The judge has concluded that the sealing of the documents is necessary to protect this overriding interest, and that a substantial probability exists that the overriding interest will be prejudiced if the record is not sealed.
