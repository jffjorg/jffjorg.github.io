And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Darryn, Thomas, by and through Guardian Ad Litem Bridgette Thomas, et al. versus Westfield Group. The Court notes that the parties reached a conditional settlement in June 2023, with a deadline to finalize the settlement by October 30, 2023. However, the Plaintiff failed to correct deficiencies in their petition to approve the minor's compromise and has not filed a new petition. As a result, the Court has denied the Expedited Petition to Approve Minor's Compromise. The Plaintiff is ordered to file a new corrected petition within two weeks or show cause why sanctions in the amount of $250 should not be imposed. The Court also orders the Defendant's counsel to file a declaration stating whether monies have been transferred pursuant to the settlement. The parties are required to file updated paperwork at least five days prior to the next court hearing. The Court sets two orders to show cause: one regarding dismissal of the case and another regarding sanctions.
