And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer to the plaintiff's second amended complaint and a motion to strike punitive damages and certain causes of action. The plaintiff alleges race and religious discrimination in violation of the Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA) and claims that she was required to participate in activities related to Christmas celebrations despite her religious beliefs. The plaintiff also claims that she was terminated from her job due to her complaints about discriminatory treatment.

The judge finds that the plaintiff has sufficiently pled facts to support religious discrimination in violation of FEHA and overrules the demurrer to the third cause of action. However, the judge grants the motion to strike the request for punitive damages and any references pertaining to punitive damages, finding that the plaintiff failed to allege facts supporting an award of punitive damages.
