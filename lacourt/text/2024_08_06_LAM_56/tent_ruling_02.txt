            The Court has considered the moving papers.
 The motion is unopposed.
 
BACKGROUND
             This is an action arising from a complaint (the
“Complaint”) filed by Plaintiff on October 26, 2023 against Defendants Los
Angeles Computer Department LLC, Mark Ivanov (“Ivanov”) and Bryan Hollenbeck.  The Complaint asserts the following causes of
action: (1) breach of contract; (2) fraud; (3) negligent misrepresentation; and
(4) concealment.
 
            On April 29, 2024, the Court noted
that pursuant to Minute Orders dated February 27, 2024, and April 12, 2024,
Plaintiff was to resubmit the request for entry of default (“Request for
Default”) as to Ivanov, but the request was not resubmitted by Plaintiff.  Thus, the Court ordered the dismissal of Mark
Ivanov in the Complaint without prejudice. 
(April 29, 2024 Minute Order; April 29, 2024 Order of Dismissal.)
 
            On June 13, 2024, Plaintiff filed
the instant motion seeking to set aside the dismissal of Ivanov (the “Motion”).  Plaintiff is also requesting leave to amend
Ivanov’s name from “Mark Ivanov” to “Nikolay Ivanov.”  No opposition has been filed.
             
DISCUSSION
            The court is empowered to relieve a party or their legal representative
from a judgment,
dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken against them through their
mistake, inadvertence,
surprise or excusable neglect.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b).)  Application for this relief shall be accompanied
by a copy of the answer or other pleading proposed to be filed therein,
otherwise the application shall not be granted, and shall be made within a
reasonable time, in no case exceeding six months, after the judgment,
dismissal, order, or proceeding was taken. (Id.) The law favors a trial
on the merits and courts therefore liberally construe section 473.  (Bonzer v. City of Huntington Park
(1993) 20 Cal.App.4th 1474, 1477.)  Doubts
in applying section 473 are resolved in favor of the party seeking relief from
default.  (Id. at 1478.)    
 
            “The court may, in
furtherance of justice, and on any terms as may be proper, allow a party to
amend any pleading or proceeding by adding or striking out the name of any party,
or by correcting a mistake in the name of a party, or a mistake in any other
respect; and may, upon like terms, enlarge the time for answer or demurrer…”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 473(a)(1).)
 
Plaintiff’s counsel declares that on or before April
29, 2024, he suffered from technical issues that prevented him from receiving
reminders or alerts regarding the need to file the Request for Default.  (Declaration of Vladimir Shagramanov, Esq., ¶
6.)  He further declares that he had
prepared the Request for Default, but inadvertently failed to file it with the
Court.  (Id., ¶ 7.)  
 
Moreover, Plaintiff’s counsel attests that Plaintiff’s
former counsel made an error in using “Mark Ivanov” on the summons as well as
on the face page of the Complaint, but used the correct name of “Nikolay
Ivanov” on page two of the Complaint.  (Id.,
¶ 8.)  Plaintiff thus requests leave to
correct Ivanov’s name from “Mark Ivanov” to “Nikolay Ivanov.”
 
The Court finds that Plaintiff has adequately shown
that the dismissal of the Complaint was the result of Plaintiff’s counsel’s mistake,
inadvertence or excusable neglect.  In
addition, the Motion is timely filed within six months of the order of dismissal
of Ivanov.  For these reasons and because
it is unopposed, the Court GRANTS the Motion and orders that the dismissal of
Ivanov be vacated, and that the Complaint be reinstated as against Ivanov.  (Sexton v. Superior Court (1997) 58
Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410.)  Further, in the
interest of justice, Plaintiff’s request to amend Ivanov’s name is
GRANTED.  
            
Moving
Party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.            
 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed
by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive an email
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off
calendar.
