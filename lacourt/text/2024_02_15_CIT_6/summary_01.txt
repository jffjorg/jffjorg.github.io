And here is the text summary:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling granting Plaintiff Caroline Rodriguez's motion for attorney's fees in the reduced amount of $63,851. The motion was unopposed by Defendant Adrian Martinez. The Court found that Plaintiff's counsel, Mr. William Chapman, had incurred reasonable attorney's fees in enforcing the contract, despite some duplicative or administrative tasks. The Court reduced the initial request of $118,068 due to excessive or unsupported time entries. The final award of $63,851 is based on the Court's own experience and familiarity with the legal market. The Court will issue a formal ruling after receiving notice from Plaintiff.
