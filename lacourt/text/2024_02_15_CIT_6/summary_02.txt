And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the motion to be relieved as Plaintiff's counsel without prejudice. Counsel is ordered to give notice of this ruling and file proof of service of same within five calendar days. The judge finds that the breakdown in the attorney-client relationship is sufficient grounds for withdrawal. However, Counsel did not file all the required forms for the motion, including a supporting declaration on Judicial Council Form MC-052. The judge also notes several other issues, including Counsel's failure to provide Plaintiff's address in the motion, the misspelling of Plaintiff's name in the proof of service, and the lack of clarity regarding which attorneys are withdrawing.
