And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the County of Los Angeles' motion for summary judgment. The County argued that it did not have notice of the alleged defect in the roadway, and the City of Covina, the cross-complainant, did not dispute this fact or provide admissible evidence that the County had actual notice of a dangerous condition or that the dangerous condition existed long enough for the County to have constructive notice. The judge found that the City's sole evidence supporting the theory that the County's tree caused the defect was a conclusory opinion based on nothing other than a review of photographs, which is not competent expert testimony. Therefore, the judge ruled that the County has met its initial burden of making a prima facie showing that it did not have notice of the dangerous condition, and the City has failed to raise a triable issue of fact on this issue.
