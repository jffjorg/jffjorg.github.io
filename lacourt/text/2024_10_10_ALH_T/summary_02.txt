And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for summary judgment filed by Defendant 824 Company. The case is a trip and fall action arising from an incident on May 13, 2019, where Plaintiff Vaughan Alexander allegedly fell and sustained injury coming out of an elevator at Defendant's commercial office property. The Plaintiff alleges causes of action for general negligence and premises liability, while the Defendant argues that the Plaintiff cannot establish a legal duty existed or breach of duty. The Judge has denied the Defendant's motion for summary judgment, finding that there is a triable issue of fact as to whether the Defendant had actual or constructive notice of the subject elevator mis-leveling prior to the incident. The Judge has taken judicial notice of the Plaintiff's complaint and the Defendant's answer, and has overruled the Defendant's objections to the Plaintiff's declarations. The Judge has also analyzed the evidence presented and has determined that the Defendant has not met its burden of showing that it exercised utmost care in maintaining the elevator. As a result, the case will proceed to trial.
