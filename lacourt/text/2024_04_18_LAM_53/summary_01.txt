And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English:

The court denies the plaintiffs' motion to withdraw from arbitration and proceed in court. The court finds that the parties intended to adopt the Federal Arbitration Act to govern their arbitration. The court also finds that defendants did not make a timely payment to JAMS, but that they have since made the required payment. The court concludes that plaintiffs have not shown that they may withdraw from arbitration under the California Arbitration Act, the Federal Arbitration Act, or the JAMS rules. The court also concludes that plaintiffs have not shown that they may withdraw from arbitration under Civil Code sections 1657 and 1657.1. Therefore, the court denies the plaintiffs' motion.
