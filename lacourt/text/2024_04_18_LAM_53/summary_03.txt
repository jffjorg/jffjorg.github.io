And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling is issued by Judge Robert B. Broadbelt in a case between the Los Angeles Community College District (represented by Newton W. Kellam) and Morillo Construction, Inc. The case concerns a Code of Civil Procedure section 170.6 challenge filed by plaintiff/relator Newton W. Kellam against Judge Steve Cochran. Judge Cochran is unavailable to reconsider the March 5, 2024 order accepting the challenge and reassigning the case to Judge Robert B. Broadbelt. Therefore, the court issues an Order to Show Cause why the court should not, on its own motion, reconsider and vacate the order and issue a new order denying the challenge. The court sets a hearing for May 1, 2024, and orders that any responses to the order be filed by April 26, 2024.
