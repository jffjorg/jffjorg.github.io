  Order RE:
 
plaintiffs’ motion to withdraw from
  arbitration and proceed in court
 



 
MOVING PARTIES:
            Plaintiffs Steven Trinh and
Linda Trinh 
 
RESPONDING PARTIES:
   (1) Defendants Calstar Motors Inc.,
Mercedes-Benz Financial Services, and Daimler Trust, and (2) Defendant
Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC
Motion to Withdraw from Arbitration and
Proceed in Court
The court considered the moving and reply papers filed in connection
with this motion. 
The court did not consider the opposition papers filed by defendants
Calstar Motors Inc., Mercedes-Benz Financial Services, and Daimler Trust because
those papers were not served on plaintiffs Steven Trinh and Linda Trinh within
the time required by Code of Civil Procedure sections 1005 and 1013.  (Opp., p. 6 [proof of service establishing
service by mail on April 5, 2024]; Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1005, subds. (b)
[opposing papers shall be filed and served at least nine court days before the
hearing on the motion], (c), 1013 [any period of notice in the case of service
by mail shall be extended by five calendar days]; Reply, p. 2:1-17 [objecting
to service].) 
The court considered the opposition papers filed by defendant
Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC. 
 
DISCUSSION
Plaintiffs Steven Trinh and
Linda Trinh (“Plaintiffs”) move the court for an order          (1) permitting Plaintiffs to withdraw from
arbitration, and (2) awarding Plaintiffs reasonable fees and costs.  Plaintiffs move for this relief on the ground
that defendants Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC (“Mercedes”), CalStar Motors Inc.,
Mercedes-Benz Financial Services USA LLC, Daimler Trust, and Lithia Motors,
Inc., d/b/a Mercedes-Benz of Los Angeles (collectively, “Defendants”) have
waived their right to participate in arbitration pursuant to (1) Code of Civil
Procedure sections 1281.97 and 1281.98, (2) federal law, (3) the JAMS rules,
and (4) Civil Code sections 1657 and 1657.1.
On August 17, 2023, the court
issued a minute order stating that counsel for the parties represented “that
the parties have submitted the issues of arbitrability of Plaintiffs’ claims to
arbitration at JAMS.”   (Aug. 17, 2023
Minute Order, p. 1.)  In support of their
motion, Plaintiffs have submitted evidence showing that (1) on June 23, 2023,
Plaintiffs submitted the JAMS form necessary to commence arbitration in this
action, seeking “arbitration of arbitrability per the terms of the arbitration
clause[;]” (2) after Plaintiffs served their demand for arbitration, the
parties selected an arbitrator from a panel of neutrals provided by JAMS; (3) JAMS
confirmed that the parties had selected an arbitrator; and (4) JAMS issued an
invoice dated August 18, 2023 to defendants Calstar Motors, Inc., Mercedes-Benz
Financial Services USA LLC, and Daimler Trust, in the amount of $9,000, which
was “due upon receipt.”  (Parnell Decl., ¶¶
79, 84, 87; Parnell Decl., Ex. 4, JAMS Demand for Arbitration, p. 2, ¶ 4;
Parnell Decl., Ex. 5 [JAMS Aug. 18, 2023 Invoice].)  Thereafter, on September 29, 2023, JAMS
issued a notice to all of the parties involved in the arbitration (1) stating
that JAMS had not received the $9,000 necessary to proceed with arbitration
from the respondents and (2) placing the matter on an administrative stay, to
be lifted upon receipt of the full payment. 
(Parnell Decl., Ex. 5.) 
First, the court finds that
Plaintiffs have not shown that they may withdraw from arbitration under Code of
Civil Procedure sections 1281.97 and 1281.98. 
“Perceiving that a ‘company’s
failure to pay the fees of an arbitration provider’ as required by an
arbitration agreement or applicable law ‘hinders the efficient resolution of
disputes and contravenes public policy,’ in 2019 the California Legislature passed
Senate Bill No. 707 and added sections 1281.97 and 1281.98 to the California
Arbitration Act (CAA) (§ 1280 et seq.).” 
(De Leon v. Juanita’s Foods (2022) 85 Cal.App.5th 740, 750
[internal citations and internal footnote omitted].)  “Whereas section 1281.97 concerns a failure
to timely pay ‘the fees or costs to initiate’ an arbitration proceeding
(§ 1281.97, subd. (a)(1), italics added), section 1281.98 concerns a
failure to timely pay ‘the fees or costs required to continue’ an
arbitration proceeding (§ 1281.98, subd. (a)(1), italics added).”  (Ibid.) 
Here, the arbitration
agreement relied on by the parties, set forth in the “Retail Installment Sale
Contract – Simple Finance Charge (with Arbitration Provision)” (the “RISC”)
executed by and between plaintiff Steven Trinh and defendant Calstar Motors Inc.,
states that “[a]ny arbitration under this Arbitration Provision shall be
governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq.) and not by
any state law concerning arbitration.” 
(Parnell Decl., Ex. 2, RISC, p. 5.) 
Ordinarily, California procedural statutes governing arbitration (i.e.,
the California Arbitration Act (Code Civ. Proc., § 1280, et seq.) “apply
by default because Congress intended the comparable FAA sections [citations] to
apply in federal court.”  (Victrola
89, LLC v. Jaman Properties 8 LLC (2020) 46 Cal.App.5th 337, 345.)  However, parties are permitted to expressly
designate that arbitration proceedings should move forward under the Federal
Arbitration Act’s procedural provisions rather than state procedural law.  (Ibid.; Cronus Investments, Inc. v.
Concierge Services (2005) 35 Cal.4th 376, 394 [Supreme Court’s opinion
“does not preclude parties to an arbitration agreement to expressly designate
that any arbitration proceeding should move forward under the FAA’s procedural
provisions rather than under state procedural law”] [emphasis in original].)
The court finds that the
language in the RISC’s Arbitration Provision, in stating both that any
arbitration thereunder shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and not
by any state law concerning arbitration, shows that the parties intended to
“adopt[] the FAA—all of it—to govern their arbitration[,]” such that the
procedural rules of the Federal Arbitration Act apply here.  (Rodriguez v. American Technologies, Inc. (2006)
136 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1122.)  Thus, the
court finds that (1) the parties expressly agreed to incorporate the Federal
Arbitration Act's procedural provisions in place of California law, and (2)
therefore the California Arbitration Act, including Code of Civil Procedure
sections 1281.97 and 1281.98, do not apply to the arbitration proceedings
involving the parties in this action. 
(Parnell Decl., Ex. 2, RISC, p. 5; Rodriguez, supra, 136
Cal.App.4th at pp. 1121-1122; Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1281.97, 1281.98.) 
Second, the court
acknowledges, as Plaintiffs point out, that sections 1281.97 and 1281.98 are
not preempted by the Federal Arbitration Act. 
(Suarez v. Superior Court of San Diego County (2024) 99
Cal.App.5th 32, 42-43 [court followed other cases “to conclude that section
1281.97 neither prohibits nor discourages the formation of arbitration
agreements” and that that “rule of procedure for the conduct of the arbitration
proceeding is not preempted by the FAA”]; Gallo v. Wood Ranch USA, Inc. (2022)
81 Cal.App.5th 621, 641 [“the FAA does not preempt sections 1281.97 and
1281.99”].)  However, the issue presented
by Plaintiffs’ motion does not concern preemption by the Federal Arbitration
Act, and instead concerns whether the procedural provisions of the California
Arbitration Act (including those statutes) are applicable.  As set forth above, the court has concluded
that the parties’ arbitration agreement adopted the procedural provisions of
the Federal Arbitration Act, rendering sections 1281.97 and 1281.98 inapplicable
to this motion. 
Third, the court finds that
Plaintiffs have not shown that they may withdraw from arbitration pursuant to
federal law.
Plaintiffs rely on Sink v.
Aden Enterprises, Inc. (2003) 352 F.3d 1197, 1201, in which the Ninth
Circuit held “that a party to an arbitration agreement may not compel
arbitration of claims under FAA § 4 where a prior default in arbitration of
those claims precludes that party from obtaining a stay of litigation pending
arbitration under § 3.”  In so holding,
the Ninth Circuit found that the employer’s “failure to pay required costs of
arbitration was a material breach of its obligations in connection with the
arbitration.”  (Id. at p. 1201.) 
The court recognizes that, under
federal law, the failure to timely pay arbitration costs may be considered a
material breach of the parties’ arbitration agreement.  (Sink, supra, 352 F.3d at p.
1201.)  However, Plaintiffs have not
shown that Defendants did not make a timely payment to JAMS.  As set forth above, the August 18, 2023
invoice issued by JAMS stated that payment of the $9,000 was “due upon
receipt.”[1] 
(Parnell Decl., Ex. 5.)  However,
the invoice did not set forth an express deadline by which payment was to be
received by JAMS.  (Ibid.)  Thereafter, JAMS sent its “Notice of
Administrative Stay” to all the parties to the arbitration, which advised them
that (1) the $9,000 payment had not been received, and (2) JAMS would close its
file on the matter if it did not receive the outstanding amount by October 30,
2023.  (Parnell Decl., Ex. 6.) 
Thus, the first express
deadline by which Defendants were required to make the $9,000 payment to JAMS
was the date of October 30, 2023. 
(Parnell Decl., Ex. 6.)  Defendant
Mercedes has submitted evidence in support of its opposition establishing that
Defendants paid the arbitration fees on October 13, 2023, and October 27, 2023,
before this deadline.  (Aliviado Decl., ¶
31.)  The court therefore finds that
defendant Mercedes has shown that Defendants are not in material breach of the
arbitration agreement.
Even if the court were to find
that Defendants breached the arbitration agreement by failing to pay the
arbitration fees upon receipt of the August 18, 2023 invoice, the court would
exercise its discretion to deny Plaintiffs’ motion because (1) Plaintiffs did
not demonstrate undue prejudice by the short delay in Defendants’ failure to
make a timely payment, and (2) Mercedes has introduced evidence explaining that
the delay in payment was caused by the resulting confusion among counsel for
Defendants as to which defendant was to pay the arbitration fees since the
August 18, 2023 invoice was addressed solely to counsel for defendants Calstar
Motors, Inc., Mercedes-Benz Financial Services USA LLC, and Daimler Trust.[2] 
(Aliviado Decl., ¶¶ 25, 27, 30.) 
Fourth, the court finds that
Plaintiffs have not shown that they may withdraw from arbitration pursuant to the
JAMS rules.  Rule 6, subdivision (c) of
“JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules & Procedures” states, in relevant part,
the following:  “If, at any time, any
Party has failed to pay fees or expenses in full, JAMS may order the suspension
or termination of the proceedings.” 
(Parnell Decl., Ex. 7, p. 4, § Rule 6, subd. (c).)  The plain language of this rule permits only
JAMS – and not Plaintiffs – to suspend or terminate arbitration proceedings
based on a party’s failure to timely pay all arbitration fees.  (Ibid.)  Thus, Plaintiffs have not shown that this
rule allows them to unilaterally terminate arbitration. 
Finally, the court finds that
Plaintiffs have not shown that they may withdraw from arbitration pursuant to
Civil Code sections 1657 and 1657.1.  Under
these statutes, the time for performance in a contract of adhesion shall be
reasonable (Civ. Code, § 1657.1), and the time for performance in a
contract that does not specify the time for performance may also be reasonable,
except “[i]f the act is in its nature capable of being done instantly—as, for
example, if it consists in the payment of money only—it must be performed
immediately upon the thing to be done being exactly ascertained” (Civ. Code, §
1657).  Plaintiffs have not cited any
authority establishing that any failure on the part of Defendants to pay the
required arbitration fees in accordance with these statutes entitles Plaintiffs
to withdraw from arbitration and proceed in court, particularly where Defendants
have since performed within a reasonable time. 
(Aliviado Decl., ¶ 30.) 
Thus, for the reasons set
forth above, the court finds that Plaintiffs have not shown that they may elect
to unilaterally terminate and withdraw from arbitration, proceed in court, and
obtain an award for fees and costs against Defendants based on their failure to
pay all required arbitration fees upon receipt of the August 18, 2023
invoice.  The court therefore denies
Plaintiffs’ motion.
