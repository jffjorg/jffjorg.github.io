 Case Number:  23STCV19739    Hearing Date:   October 22, 2024    Dept:  78  Superior Court of California County of Los Angeles Department 78 ¿ ALEXIS MOORE, et al., Plaintiff(s), vs. KENNEDY WILSON, et al., Defendant(s). Case No.:¿ 23STCV19739 Hearing Date: October 22, 2024   [TENTATIVE] ORDER DENYING DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER DISCOVERY RESPONSES TO SPECIAL INTERROGATORIES  Plaintiffs Alexis Moore, Andrea Areiza, Alyse Greene, Dailynn Huerta, Miesha Miller, Milan Harrell, Mohammed Fahad, and Vitu Chea (“Chea”) filed their First Amended Complaint against defendants Kennedy Wilson, KW Westmoreland Tic, Inc. dba as The Chadwick, Graystar Real Estate Partners LLC, Greystar California Inc., and Does 1 through 50 for allegations arising from the habitability of rental apartments. On May 15, 2024, KW Westmoreland Tic, LLC, erroneously sued as KW Westmoreland Tic, Inc., (“KW”) filed the instant motion for an order compelling Plaintiff Chea to provide further responses to its special interrogatories, set one. The motion is untimely. As acknowledged by KW’s counsel with supporting evidence, the parties agreed that KW would have until May 14, 2024 to file its motion to compel. (Van Der Wall Decl. ¶ 12, Exhs. 11-13.) However, the instant motion was filed one day later, on May 15, 2024. The Court has no jurisdiction to review an untimely filed motion to compel further. (Golf & Tennis Pro Shop, Inc. v. Superior Ct. (2022) 84 Cal. App. 5th 127, 134.) Based on the foregoing, KW’s motion to compel further responses is DENIED.   Moving Party is ordered to give notice.  DATED: October 21, 2024 __________________________ Hon.
