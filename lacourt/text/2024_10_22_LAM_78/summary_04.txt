Roles: Judge Michelle C. Kim, Plaintiff's counsel, Defendant's counsel
Significant Statements: The Court finds that Plaintiffs have met their burden that service was proper. As Plaintiffs aver, Defendant's affidavit does not state that he was not at 3750 West El Segundo on the purported date of service. Further, Plaintiffs have provided sufficient evidence that the business address is 3750 West El Segundo, and that Defendant had actual notice of the lawsuit pursuant to the emails he sent to Plaintiffs' counsel. As such, even under a liberal construction of the statute, Defendant has failed to demonstrate that he had actual lack of notice of the lawsuit in time to defend that was not caused by inexcusable neglect or avoidance of service under section 473.5.
