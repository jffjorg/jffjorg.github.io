And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a request for default judgment against the defendants Albert Nazaryan, Nelli Nazaryan, and Zhasmen Tovbekhakyan. The plaintiff, State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company, alleges that the defendants failed to cooperate with the claim investigation and concealed and misrepresented material facts about the accident. The judge notes that the defendants failed to file an answer to the complaint and that the plaintiff has since obtained entry of default against them. The judge also notes that the plaintiff has filed a motion to strike the answer that the defendants did file.

The judge is granting the application for default judgment, but only conditionally. The plaintiff must file a new CIV-100 form that cures a defect in the original form. The judge is requiring the plaintiff to file a new form because it failed to sign Item 8 of the original form, which is a requirement under the California Rules of Court.

The judge's ruling is tentative and is subject to change after the hearing on October 22, 2024.
