And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Kennedy Wilson's (KW) motion to compel further discovery responses from plaintiff Vitu Chea. KW filed its motion one day late, on May 15, 2024, despite the parties agreeing that KW would have until May 14, 2024 to file its motion to compel. The court has no jurisdiction to review an untimely filed motion to compel, and therefore, KW's motion is denied. The judge encourages the parties to meet and confer to reach an agreement and provides instructions on how to submit or appear at the hearing.
