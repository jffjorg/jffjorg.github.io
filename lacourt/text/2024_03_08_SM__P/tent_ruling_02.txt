Joseph Farahzad v.
JMA Plastering Inc. et al., Case No. 23SMCV04923
Hearing Date March
8, 2024
Defendants JMA
Plastering Inc. dba JMA Construction and Jose Israel Andres-Molina’s Motion to
Strike Punitive Damages 
 
In this construction
defect case plaintiff alleges defendants failed to properly perform lathing and
plastering work and falsely represented that they held the required license. Defendants
move to strike the request for punitive damages. 
 
Punitive damages
are allowable when a plaintiff proves defendant has been guilty of oppression,
fraud or malice. Cal. Civ. Code §3294(a). Facts giving rise to a claim for
punitive damages must be pleaded specifically – vague or conclusory allegations
are insufficient. G.D. Searle & Company v. Superior Court (1975) 49
Cal.App.3d 22, 29. 
 
Defendants argue
plaintiff has not specifically alleged facts giving rise to a right to recover
punitive damages. The complaint alleges a cause of action for intentional
misrepresentation, stating how, when, why and by what means the alleged
fraudulent statements were made. Complaint ¶¶42-44. A properly pleaded fraud
claim is sufficient to support a claim for punitive damages upon a motion to
strike. DENIED.
