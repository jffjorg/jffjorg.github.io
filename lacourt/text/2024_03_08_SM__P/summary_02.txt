And here is the English-text summary:

In this construction defect case, plaintiff Joseph Farahad alleges that defendants JMA Plastering Inc. et al. failed to properly perform lathing and plastering work and falsely represented that they held the required license. The defendants have moved to strike the request for punitive damages, arguing that the plaintiff has not specifically alleged facts giving rise to a right to recover punitive damages. However, the plaintiff's complaint alleges a cause of action for intentional misrepresentation, stating specific facts about the alleged fraudulent statements. The court finds that a properly pleaded fraud claim is sufficient to support a claim for punitive damages upon a motion to strike, and therefore denies the defendant's motion.
