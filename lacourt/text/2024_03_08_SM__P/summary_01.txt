A tentative ruling has been made by the Judge in the case of Mario Gonzalez v. Cascade Mountain Technologies et al. (Case No. 23SMCV03499). The case involves a dispute over a defective stadium seat purchased by Gonzalez from Costco, which allegedly caused him injuries. The defendants, Costco Wholesale Corporation and Cascade Mountain Technologies, have filed a demurrer to the complaint, arguing that it is uncertain and lacks specific details about the defect and how it caused the injuries.

The Judge has ruled that the complaint is indeed vague and uncertain, and that Gonzalez must specifically identify the defect and how it injured him before the lawsuit can proceed. The Judge has granted the defendants 10 days to amend the complaint.
