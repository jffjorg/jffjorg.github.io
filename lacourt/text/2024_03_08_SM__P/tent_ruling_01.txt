Mario Gonzalez v.
Cascade Mountain Technologies et al., Case No. 23SMCV03499
Hearing Date March
8, 2024
Defendants’
Demurrer to Complaint (Unopposed)
 
Plaintiff Mario
Gonzalez allegedly purchased a stadium seat from Costco. Gonzalez alleges the
seat was defective, causing injuries. Defendant Costco Wholseale Corporation
and Cascade Mountain Technologies demur for uncertainty. 
 
Gonzalez’s form
complaint is vague. Although he asserts causes of action for products liability
and negligence, he does not allege any facts identifying the product’s defect
or stating how it injured him. The complaint merely states in a conclusory
fashion that the seat had a defect which caused plaintiff to fall. Complaint
pgs. 4-5. The complaint is uncertain— Gonzelez must specifically identify the
defect and how it injured him before this lawsuit can proceed.
 
SUSTAINED with ten
days leave to amend.
