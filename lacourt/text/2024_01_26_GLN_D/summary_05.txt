Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied the plaintiff's application for a writ of possession without prejudice. The plaintiff, Ally Bank, has not provided sufficient evidence to support its claim to possession of the property. The application lacks critical information, including a copy of the contract, statements of the value and location of the subject property, and an affidavit providing an evidentiary showing of the basis for the claim to possession. Additionally, the plaintiff has not provided proof of service of the required documents, including the summons and complaint, notice of application and hearing, and application for writ and all declarations or affidavits in support of the motion. The Judge has also noted that the application does not meet the statutory requirements under California Code of Civil Procedure sections 512.010 and 512.060. The case is set for a hearing on March 7, 2024, and the plaintiff is directed to provide the required information and proof of service before the court can consider the application again.
