Summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge is considering a motion to compel further responses to discovery filed by the defendant, NGP Motors, Inc. (dba Sunrise Ford of North Hollywood). The motion seeks to compel the plaintiff, Toni Lawson-Apana, to provide further responses to special interrogatories and document requests. The plaintiff has objected to the discovery requests, arguing that they are vague, ambiguous, overbroad, and unduly burdensome. The judge has reviewed the parties' arguments and evidence and has concluded that the plaintiff has failed to justify her objections and has not provided sufficient responses to the discovery requests.

The judge has ordered the plaintiff to serve further Code-compliant responses to the discovery requests, without objections, except for the tax records requested in Request No. 29. The judge has also ordered the plaintiff to provide a statement of compliance or inability to comply with the discovery requests, and has set a deadline for the plaintiff to serve the further responses.

The judge has also taken into account the California Supreme Court's decision in Williams v. Superior Court, which reiterated that a party asserting a privacy objection bears the initial burden of establishing a legally protected privacy interest, an objectively reasonable expectation of privacy in the given circumstances, and a threatened intrusion that is serious.
