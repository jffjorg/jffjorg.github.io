**Significant Statements**

* "The court previously had been concerned that the showing was incomplete, as there had been no evidence confirming that plaintiff filed a creditor's claim, or when it was filed."
* "Although the claim does not identify plaintiff Ando as the creditor upon whose behalf claimant/attorney Tyer is making the claim, there is reference to the Civil Case of 'Kurt Takashi Ando v. Jim Cox.'"
* "The technical rejection of the claim here made on January 24, 2023, which would be deemed a notice of rejection as of February 23, 3023, appears to have accordingly been a rejection with did not contain a statement that plaintiff has three months within which to apply for an order for substitution."
* "This motion, filed on August 20, 2023 would be timely."
