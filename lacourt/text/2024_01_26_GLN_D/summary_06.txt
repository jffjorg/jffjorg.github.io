And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling denies the applications for writ of possession filed by Pawnee Leasing Corporation against Saken Transportation Inc. and Hamlet Avanesian. Both defendants are in default, with default having been entered against Saken Transportation Inc. on January 3, 2024, and against Hamlet Avanesian on January 4, 2024. The court notes that the entry of default terminates a defendant's rights to take any further affirmative steps in the litigation, and therefore, the plaintiff should proceed to a default prove-up hearing to obtain final judgment. The application is denied without prejudice, and a default prove-up schedule will be set for April 24, 2024, at 8:30 a.m.
