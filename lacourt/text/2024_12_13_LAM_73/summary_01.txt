And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on Plaintiff Shahnaz Amirtalesh's motion to quash Defendants' subpoena of David Rodriguez. The Plaintiff argues that the subpoena is untimely and was not properly served, and that it is directed at an inspector who is unrelated to the case. The Defendants argue that the motion is moot because the trial has been continued, and that David Rodriguez is a Code Enforcement Officer with the City of Beverly Hills who encountered the Plaintiff in July 2024 when he inspected her apartment. The Judge finds that the motion is indeed moot because the trial has been continued, and therefore denies the motion to quash the subpoena.
