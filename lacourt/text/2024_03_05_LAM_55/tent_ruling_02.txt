 Case Number:  23STCV12007    Hearing Date:   March 5, 2024    Dept:  55  
NATURE OF PROCEEDINGS:
Defendant Dal-Tile Distribution, Inc.’s Motion to Strike Plaintiffs’ Complaint.
Plaintiffs JAIME BLANCO MACIEL and HELEN ORTIZ-BLANCO filed
suit against over 50 defendants for injuries sustained by Plaintiff JAIME
BLANCO MACIEL by inhaling dust from working with defendants’ products containing
crystalline silica. Defendant DAL-TILE DISTRIBUTION, INC. now moves to strike, from
page 22, at line 27, the following allegation from the Complaint: “And other
stone products to be identified during the course of discovery.” (Mot., 2:7.)  
Defendant argues that this language in the Complaint does
not meet the standard required for a toxic tort pleading such as the Complaint.
But the case relied on by Defendant does not support its argument. With respect
to pleading causation in a toxic tort case, the California Supreme Court has
held that a plaintiff must identify each product that allegedly caused the injury.
 Bockrath v. Aldrich Chemical Co.
(1999) 21 Cal. 4th 71, 80. “If the plaintiff does not believe the requisite
evidence exists, but does actually believe that it is likely to be discovered
later, ‘after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery’
(Code Civ. Proc., § 128.7, subd. (b)(3)), the complaint must so state (ibid.).”  Bockrath v. Aldrich Chemical Co.
(1999) 21 Cal. 4th 71, 82. Thus, Plaintiffs’ allegation that the products that
caused Jaime Blanco Maciel’s injuries include other undiscovered stone products
to be identified in discovery is authorized by the holding in Bockrath. It
would be an illogical interpretation of Bockrath to require causation to
be pled as to undiscovered products, because that cannot be done unless the
product can be known and analyzed. 
The motion to strike is denied.  Twenty days to answer.
