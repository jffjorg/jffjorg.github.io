And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the motion to strike the Plaintiffs' Complaint filed by Dal-Tile Distribution, Inc. The Plaintiffs, Jaime Blanco Maciel and Helen Ortiz-Blanco, sued over 50 defendants for injuries sustained by Jaime Blanco Maciel from inhaling dust from working with defendants' products containing crystalline silica. The Defendant argued that the Complaint's allegation of "other stone products to be identified during the course of discovery" does not meet the standard required for a toxic tort pleading. The Judge disagrees, citing the California Supreme Court's holding in Bockrath v. Aldrich Chemical Co. that a plaintiff must identify each product that allegedly caused the injury, but may also state that the products causing the injury will be discovered later through further investigation or discovery. The Judge concludes that the Plaintiffs' allegation is authorized by this holding and denies the motion to strike. The Defendant has 20 days to answer.
