  Case Number:  23STCP02525    Hearing Date:   March 5, 2024    Dept:  55 NATURE OF PROCEEDINGS:  Petitioners’ Petition to Correct
Attorney-Client Fee Arbitration Award.
 
The LAW OFFICES OF SAM X.J. WU, APC and SAM X. J. WU (“Petitioners”)
filed a Petition against TING ZHANG. LAN FANG, and ZHIQIN SONG (“Respondents”),
alleging that the arbitrator’s decision contains purely mathematical errors
needing corrected.  
A court may “‘correct the award and confirm it as
corrected if the court determines that: The arbitrators exceeded their powers
but the award may be corrected without affecting the merits of the decision
upon the controversy submitted….’” Jones v. Humanscale Corp. 
(2005) 130 Cal.App.4th 401, 412 (quoting CCP §1286.6(b)). As reflected in the
declaration of Petitioners’ counsel, Respondents do not oppose the proposed
corrections, and in fact signed a stipulation to confirm the petition to
correct the arbitration award. 
The Court therefore grants the unopposed and
stipulated petition. The Court will sign the proposed order attached to the
parties’ signed stipulation, which is attached to the Iniguez declaration.
