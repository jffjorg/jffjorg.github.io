And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court's tentative ruling addresses two motions: Motion 1, which seeks to compel responses to discovery requests, and Motion 2, which seeks to deem admissions admitted. The court finds that the defendant failed to provide timely responses to the discovery requests, despite the plaintiff's service of the requests on August 17, 2023. The court grants Motion 1, but only in part, as the defendant provided responses after the motion was filed. The court also orders the defendant to pay sanctions under Chapter 7 of the California Code of Civil Procedure. The court will hear argument on Motion 2, which pertains to requests for admissions. The court notes that the defendant's failure to provide timely responses necessitates the imposition of sanctions under CCP ยง 2033.280(c). The court will discuss the issue of sanctions with counsel.
