TENTATIVE RULING
In the 1/19/2024 Minute Order, the Court mentioned how the hearing on
motion for summary judgment was continued to 5/17/2024.
 
As of 5/10/2024, despite the fact that there is a scheduled
hearing on motion for summary judgment with CRS# 979079855708 for 5/17/2024, no
documents have been filed with the Court for this motion.
 
“Notice of the motion and supporting papers shall be
served on all other parties to the action at least 75 days before the time
appointed for hearing.” (CCP § 437c(a)(2).)
 
Although §
437c(a)(2) mentions when the notice and supporting papers need to be served
on all parties, it is silent as to when the moving papers need to be filed with
the Court. However, “An opposition to the motion shall be served and filed not
less than 14 days preceding the noticed or continued date of hearing, unless
the court for good cause orders otherwise.” (CCP § 437c(b)(2).) Based on CCP §
437c(b)(2), it appears that at the very least it can be implied that the moving
papers needed to be served and filed earlier than 14 days preceding the hearing
because naturally the moving papers precede the opposition. 
 
Further, although
not binding, The Rutter Guide states:
 
Although CCP § 437c is silent
concerning when the notice and supporting papers must be filed (as opposed to
served), they presumably should be filed at the same time they are served. As
with other motions, the proof of service must be filed no later than five court
days before the hearing date (though, as a practical matter, the proof of
service normally should be attached to and filed with the moving papers. [CRC
3.1300(c); see ¶ 9:100 ff.]
 
(Weil & Brown, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure
Before Trial (The Rutter Group 2023) ¶ 10:83)
 
The hearing on motion for summary judgment with CRS#
979079855708 is DENIED. Further, the Court notes that it is unclear if
Plaintiff or a Defendant scheduled this hearing because there is no notice of
motion, nor any papers filed with the Court, to indicate who was the moving
party.
