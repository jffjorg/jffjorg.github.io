[TENTATIVE RULING
DEMURRER]
RELIEF REQUESTED
Defendant, Federal Express Corporation, moves for an order sustaining its
demurrer to the Second Amended Complaint for Damages brought by Plaintiff.
Defendant
demurs on the following grounds:
“1.
The first, second and third causes of action in the SAC are barred by the
litigation privilege. Code of Civil Procedure § 47(b). Plaintiff seeks to
impose liability for statements made in discovery responses in prior
litigation, and in response to an arbitration demand. These causes of action
pivot on communications made in prior litigation, which are immune from
liability by operation of the litigation privilege. Rubin v. Green (1993) 4
Cal.4th 1187. Where pleaded facts make clear that statements were made in a
judicial or quasi-judicial proceeding, a general demurrer based on the
litigation privilege is proper. See Holland v. Jones (2012) 210 Cal.App.4th
378. 
2.
The first, second and third causes of action in the SAC are barred because the
exclusive remedy for plaintiff, a former employee of Defendant injured in the
scope of employment, is through workers’ compensation. Labor Code § 3602. 
3.
The first, second and third causes of action in the SAC fail to state a valid
cause of action, as follows: 
a)
With respect to the first cause of action for declaration relief, plaintiff is
a stranger to the insurance contract for which he seeks declaratory relief. As
such, he can prove neither a proper subject of declaratory relief nor an actual
controversy involving justiciable questions. Jolley v. Chase Home Finance, LLC
(2013) 213 Cal.App.4th 872. 
b)
With respect to the second cause of action for breach of contract, plaintiff is
not in privity with the parties to the insurance contract he claims was
breached. The absence of at least two contracting parties, a plaintiff and a
defendant, is fatal to a cause of action for breach of contract. CACI 303 and
see Schaefer v. Williams (1993) 15 Cal.App.4th 1243. 
c)
With respect to the third cause of action for promissory estoppel, plaintiff
cannot prove the first element of promissory estoppel, the existence of a clear
and unambiguous promise. Lange v. TIG Ins. Co. (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 1179. A
discovery response served in prior litigation which produced only the insurance
policy’s declarations pages is insufficient. Plaintiff was not a party to the
policy and the declaration pages did not establish a clear and unambiguous
promise to establish that plaintiff was entitled to an underinsured motorists
insurance benefits.”
(Def.
Dem. p. 2-3.)
BACKGROUND
Plaintiff, Alex Haddad,
filed the original complaint on 5/15/2023 against Federal Express Corporation
alleging six causes of action for: (1) Declaratory Relief; (2) Breach of
Contract; (3) Fraudulent Misrepresentation; (4) Bad Faith Denial of Insurance
Claim; (5) Constructive Fraud; and (6) Promissory Estoppel.
On
6/16/2023, Plaintiff filed an FAC against Federal Express Corporation and
Protective Insurance Corporation dba Protective Insurance Company for: (1)
Declaratory Relief; (2) Breach of Contract; (3) Bad Faith Denial of Insurance
Claim; (4) Violation of Business and Professions Code Section 17200 et seq; and
(5) Promissory Estoppel.
On
10/6/2023, the Court sustained Federal Express Corporation’s demurrer to the third
cause of action without leave to amend. The demurrer to the 1st, 2nd,
4th, and 5th causes of action were sustained with leave
to amend granted.
Plaintiff
filed the SAC on 11/8/2023 against Federal Express Corporation and Worthe,
Hanson & Worthe, a law corporation. The first three causes of action – (1)
declaratory relief, (2) Breach of Contract, and (3) Promissory Estoppel – are
alleged against both Defendants. The fourth cause of action for legal
malpractice is alleged only against Defendant Worthe, Hanson & Worthe.
The
demurrer to the SAC was initially set for 5/10/2024 but was reset for
5/17/2024.

Meet and Confer
A party filing a
demurrer “shall meet and confer in person or by telephone with the party who
filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the purpose of determining
whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve the objections to be
raised in the demurrer.”  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a).)  “The
parties shall meet and confer at least five days before the date the responsive
pleading is due. If the parties are not able to meet and confer at least five
days prior to the date the responsive pleading is due, the demurring party
shall be granted an automatic 30-day extension of time within which to file a
responsive pleading, by filing and serving, on or before the date on which a
demurrer would be due, a declaration stating under penalty of perjury that a
good faith attempt to meet and confer was made and explaining the reasons why
the parties could not meet and confer.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a)(2).) 
Failure
to sufficiently meet and confer is not grounds to overrule or sustain a
demurrer. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41(a)(4).)
Here,
Defendant’s counsel alleged that the parties met and conferred but an agreement
was not able to be reached. (Ortiz Decl. ¶ 3.)
LEGAL STANDARDS FOR DEMURRERS
Demurrer
– Sufficiency
A demurrer for
sufficiency tests whether the complaint states a cause of action.  (Hahn v. Mirda, (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th
740, 747.)  When considering demurrers,
courts read the allegations liberally and in context.  (Taylor v. City of Los Angeles Dept. of
Water and Power (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1228.)  The court “treat[s]
the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded, but not
contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law ….”  (Berkley v. Dowds (2007) 152
Cal.App.4th 518, 525.)  In a demurrer
proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via
proper judicial notice.  (Donabedian
v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.)  A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and
not the evidence or other extrinsic matters; therefore, it lies only where the
defects appear on the face of the pleading or are judicially noticed.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 430.30, 430.70.)  The only issue involved in a demurrer hearing
is whether the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous matters,
states a cause of action. (Hahn, supra, 147 Cal.App.4th at
747.)  
The
general rule is that the plaintiff need only allege ultimate facts, not
evidentiary facts.  (Doe v. City of
Los Angeles (2007) 42 Cal.4th 531, 550.) 
“All that is required of a plaintiff, as a matter of pleading … is that
his complaint set forth the essential facts of the case with reasonable
precision and with sufficient particularity to acquaint the defendant with the
nature, source and extent of his cause of action.”  (Rannard v. Lockheed Aircraft Corp.
(1945) 26 Cal.2d 149, 156-157.)  
On
demurrer, a trial court has an independent duty to “determine whether or not
the … complaint alleges facts sufficient to state a cause of action under any
legal theory.”  (Das v. Bank of
America, N.A. (2010) 186 Cal.App.4th 727, 734.)  Demurrers do not lie as to only parts of
causes of action, where some valid claim is alleged but “must dispose of an
entire cause of action to be sustained.” 
(Poizner v. Fremont General Corp. (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97,
119.)  “Generally
it is an abuse of discretion to sustain a demurrer without leave to amend if
there is any reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by
amendment.”  (Goodman v. Kennedy
(1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 349.)
Demurrer – Uncertainty
A special demurrer for
uncertainty, CCP section 430.10(f), is disfavored and will only be sustained
where the pleading is so bad that defendant cannot reasonably respond—i.e.,
cannot reasonably determine what issues must be admitted or denied, or what counts or
claims are directed against him/her.  (Khoury v. Maly’s of Calif., Inc. (1993)
14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.)  Moreover, even if the pleading is somewhat
vague, “ambiguities can be clarified under modern discovery procedures.” (Ibid.)
ANALYSIS
Litigation
Privilege
Defendant argues that
the litigation privilege bars the first, second, and third cause of action.
Defendant incorrectly cites to the Code of Civil Procedure § 47(b). The Court
notes that it appears as if Defendant intended to cite to Civil Code § 47(b). 
The
Court does not find Defendant’s argument persuasive that the first, second, and
third causes of action are barred by Civil Code § 47(b). “This subdivision does
not make privileged any communication made in a judicial proceeding knowingly
concealing the existence of an insurance policy or policies.” (Civil Code §
47(b)(3).)
Second Cause of Action – Breach of Contract
To state a cause of action for
breach of contract, Plaintiff must allege “(1) the existence of the contract,
(2) plaintiff’s performance or excuse for nonperformance, (3) defendant’s
breach, and (4) resulting damages to the plaintiff.”  (Oasis West Realty, LLC v. Goldman (2011)
51 Cal.4th 811, 821.)  
A cause of action for breach of contract is subject to
demurrer if “it cannot be ascertained from the pleading whether the contract is
written, is oral, or is implied by conduct.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., §430.10(g).) 
A written contract must be pled verbatim in the body of the
complaint, be attached to the complaint and incorporated by reference, or be
pled according to its legal effect.  (Bowden
v. Robinson (1977) 67 Cal.App.3d 705, 718.) 
An allegation of an oral agreement must “set[] forth the substance of
its relative terms.”  (Gautier v.
General Tel. Co. (1965) 234 Cal.App.2d 302, 305.)
“Facts alleging a
breach, like all essential elements of a breach of contract cause of action,
must be pleaded with specificity. (See generally 4 *6 Witkin, Cal. Procedure
(4th ed. 1996) Pleading, § 4495, pp. 585–586; Bentley v. Mountain (1942) 51
Cal.App.2d 95, 98, 124 P.2d 91 [general averments that defendants violated
contract insufficient; pleader must allege facts demonstrating breach];
Thompson v. Purdy (1931) 117 Cal.App. 565, 567, 4 P.2d 282, [general averments
that defendant failed to perform duties or comply with contract
insufficient].)” (Levy v. State Farm Automobile Ins. Co. (2007) 150 Cal.App.4th
1, 5-6.)
Plaintiff’s breach-of-contract
claim is alleged from ¶¶ 28-32 in the SAC. 
Here, Plaintiff does
not appear to plead the first element of existence of the contract. It is
unclear which alleged contract the parties entered into. Plaintiff’s
allegations cite to Exhibit A and Exhibit C, but it is unclear if Plaintiff is
alleging that Defendant(s) entered into these contracts with Plaintiff. 
Further, the second
element of a breach-of-contract claim was not alleged.
Third, Plaintiff does
not allege Defendant’s breach of the contract. Plaintiff alleges in ¶31 that
Defendants breached a duty, but duty is not an element of a breach of contract
claim. 
Defendant’s demurrer
to the second cause of action for breach of contract is SUSTAINED.
Third
Cause of Action – Promissory Estoppel
“The elements of a promissory estoppel claim
are ‘(1) a promise clear and unambiguous in its terms; (2) reliance by the
party to whom the promise is made; (3) [the] reliance must be both reasonable
and foreseeable; and (4) the party asserting the estoppel must be injured by
his reliance.' [Citation.].” (Jones v. Wachovia Bank (2014) 230
Cal.App.4th 935, 945 citing U.S. Ecology, Inc. v. State of California (2005)
129 Cal.App.4th 887, 902.)
Here, Plaintiff does
not plead the first element of promissory estoppel. When reading ¶¶ 33-39 in
the SAC it is unclear what the promise is that Plaintiff is basing its claim
off of. Further, Plaintiff did not plead the second, third, and fourth elements
of this cause of action.
Defendant’s demurrer
to the third cause of action is sustained.
First
Cause of Action – Declaratory Relief
Defendant’s argument on why the declaratory
relief cause of action should be sustained is somewhat unclear. It appears that
Defendant is arguing that the declaratory relief cause of action is based on
the breach of contract cause of action and since Defendant is not a party to
the contract, the declaratory relief cause of action should be sustained.
The Opposition does
not address Defendant’s argument.
Since the breach of
contract cause of action was sustained, the declaratory relief cause of action
is likewise sustained since Opposition does not address Defendant’s argument.
Leave to
Amend
The Court is inclined to grant leave to amend
to the first, second, and third causes of action.
However, the Court
will hear argument as to whether this entire action is barred and the exclusive
remedy is through worker’s compensation.
“Where the conditions
of compensation set forth in Section 3600 concur, the right to recover
compensation is, except as specifically provided in this section and Sections
3706 and 4558, the sole and exclusive remedy of the employee or his or her
dependents against the employer. The fact that either the employee or the
employer also occupied another or dual capacity prior to, or at the time of,
the employee’s industrial injury shall not permit the employee or his or her
dependents to bring an action at law for damages against the employer.” (Labor
Code § 3602.)
Here, Plaintiff’s SAC alleges
that the automobile accident forming the basis of its SAC occurred while
driving Defendant’s truck in the course and scope of his employment. (See SAC ¶
1.)
“ With limited
exceptions not pertinent here, workers' compensation is an employee's exclusive
remedy against the employer when the employee is injured while acting within
the course of his or her employment. (Lab.Code, §§ 3600, 3601, 3602;
further statutory references are to the Labor Code unless otherwise specified.).”
(Colombo v. State of California (1991) 3 Cal.App.4th 594, 596.)
Further, Defendant
points out how the SAC does not allege any statutorily-specified exceptions so
that Plaintiff’s exclusive remedy is anything other than workers compensation.
Opposition’s argument
on this topic is unpersuasive by simply arguing that the SAC is silent as to
whether he has commenced a worker’s compensation claim and/or if worker’s
compensation claim was commenced or if a worker’s compensation claim has been
resolved either by stipulation or a hearing. 
Further, Opposition
argues that there is no factual basis from a reading of the SAC for Defendant
to conclude that no recognized exceptions to the exclusivity remedy rule apply.
The Court notes that this argument is unpersuasive – the basis from reading the
SAC in which Defendant concludes there are no recognized exceptions is that
Plaintiff does not plead any.
For example, it
appears as if Labor Code § 3602(b) lists exceptions:
An
employee, or his or her dependents in the event of his or her death, may bring
an action at law for damages against the employer, as if this division did not
apply, in the following instances:
(1) Where
the employee’s injury or death is proximately caused by a willful physical
assault by the employer.
(2) Where
the employee’s injury is aggravated by the employer’s fraudulent concealment of
the existence of the injury and its connection with the employment, in which
case the employer’s liability shall be limited to those damages proximately
caused by the aggravation. The burden of proof respecting apportionment of
damages between the injury and any subsequent aggravation thereof is upon the
employer.
(3) Where
the employee’s injury or death is proximately caused by a defective product
manufactured by the employer and sold, leased, or otherwise transferred for
valuable consideration to an independent third person, and that product is
thereafter provided for the employee’s use by a third person.
(Labor Code § 3602(b).)
Plaintiff does not appear to allege any of these exceptions.
Further, Plaintiff cites to Labor Code § 3852 and argues that the
statute states that the workers’ compensation law does not preempt employee
civil damages remedies against nonemployee third parties whose tortious
misconduct contributed to the injury.
However, § 3852 does not state that. Section 3852 states in relevant
part, “The claim of an employee, including, but not limited to, any peace
officer or firefighter, for compensation does not affect his or her claim or
right of action for all damages proximately resulting from the injury or death
against any person other than the employer.”
Section 3852 appears to be about recovering from any person other than
the employer. Here, FedEx was the employer of Plaintiff.
At the hearing, Plaintiff should address how this action falls within
the exceptions to the exclusive remedy of workers’ compensation. Plaintiff
cited Waggaman v. Northwestern Security Ins. Co. (1971) 16 Cal.App.3d
571, but this case does not discuss what exceptions there are to workers’ compensation
as the exclusive remedy.
