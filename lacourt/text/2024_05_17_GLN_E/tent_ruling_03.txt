Plaintiff, Benigno T. Evardone, Jr., filed a Complaint on 06/20/2023
alleging three causes of action for: (1) Violation of Song-Beverly Act – Breach
of Express Warranty, (2) Violation of Song-Beverly Act – Breach of Implied
Warranty, and (3) Violation of Song-Beverly Act Section 1793.2.
 
MOTION 1 - RELIEF REQUESTED¿
“Plaintiff, BENIGNO T. EVARDONE, JR.
(hereinafter “Plaintiff”), will, and hereby do, move for an order to compel
responses, without objections, to Plaintiff’s Requests for Production of
Documents, Set One (“RFPs”). Plaintiff’s Requests for Production of Documents,
Set One, was initially served and propounded on Defendant by Plaintiff on
August 17, 2023. 
 
This Motion is made pursuant to
California Code of Civil Procedure, sections 2033.280, 2023.010, and 2023.030
on the basis that Plaintiff properly served upon Defendant, Requests for
Production of Documents, Set One, and Defendant has failed to serve timely
responses. Plaintiff’s RFPs seek information directly relevant and material to
their claims under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act. Thus, Plaintiff
seeks an order compelling Defendant to produce responses, without objections,
within 10 calendar days of the Court’s order. 
 
The Motion is based upon this
Notice, the following Memorandum of Points and Authorities, the Declaration of
Gregory Sogoyan, the pleadings, and papers on file herein, and upon any other
matters that may be presented to the Court at the hearing. 
 
No separate statement is being
submitted in support of the instant Motion, as it is not required pursuant to
rule 3.1345(b), of the California Rules of Court.”

“Plaintiff, BENIGNO T. EVARDONE, JR.
(hereinafter “Plaintiff”), will, and hereby do, move for an order deeming the
truth of matters admitted in Plaintiff’s Requests for Admissions, Set One.
Plaintiff’s Requests for Admissions were initially served and propounded on
Defendant by Plaintiff on August 17, 2023. 
 
This Motion is made pursuant to
California Code of Civil Procedure, sections 2033.280, subdivision (a), and
2033.280, subdivision (b), on the grounds that Defendant FCA US LLC
(“Defendant”) has failed to provide verified and timely responses to Plaintiff’s
Requests for Admissions, which seek information directly relevant and material
to their claims under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act. Thus, Plaintiff
seeks an order deeming the truth of matters admitted, within 10 calendar days
of the Court’s order. 
 
The Motion is based upon this
Notice, the following Memorandum of Points and Authorities, the Declaration of
Gregory Sogoyan, the pleadings and papers on file herein, and upon any other

LEGAL
STANDARD – COMPEL RESPONSES, INSPECTION DEMANDS
Within
30 days after service of a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or
sampling, the party to whom the demand is directed shall serve the original of
the response to it on the party making the demand, and a copy of the response
on all other parties who have appeared in the action, unless on motion of the
party making the demand, the court has shortened the time for response, or
unless on motion of the party to whom the demand has been directed, the court
has extended the time for response. (CCP § 2031.260(a).)
If a party to whom a demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling is directed fails to serve a timely response to it, the
party making the demand may move for an order compelling response to the
demand. (CCP § 2031.300(b).)
If a party to whom a demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling is directed fails to serve a timely response to it, the
party to whom the demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is
directed waives any objection to the demand, including one based on privilege
or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section
2018.010). (CCP § 2031.300(a).) “The court, on motion, may relieve that
party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following conditions
are satisfied: (1) The party has subsequently served a response that is in
substantial compliance with Sections 2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230, 2031.240,
and 2031.280. (2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response was the result
of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.” (CCP § 2031.300(a)(1)-(2).)
Unlike a motion to compel further responses, a motion
to compel responses is not subject to a 45-day time limit, and the propounding
party does not have to demonstrate either good cause or that it satisfied a
“meet and confer” requirement. (Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v.
Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 404
citing Weil and Brown, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (The
Rutter Group 2006) ¶¶ 8:1137 to 8:1144, pp. 8F-59 to 8F-60, ¶¶ 8:1483 to
8:1489, pp. 8H-29 to hH-30 (Weil & Brown).)
 
LEGAL STANDARD –REQUEST TO DEEM ADMISSIONS ADMITTED
“Within 30 days after service of requests for
admission, the party to whom the requests are directed shall serve the original
of the response to them on the requesting party, and a copy of the response on
all other parties who have appeared, unless on motion of the requesting party
the court has shortened the time for response, or unless on motion of the
responding party the court has extended the time for response.” (CCP § 2033.250(a).)
 
If a party to whom
requests for admission are directed fails to serve a timely response, the
requesting party may move for an order that the genuineness of any documents
and the truth of any matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted, as
well as for a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010). (CCP § 2033.280(b).) 
Further, “If
a party to whom requests for admission are directed fails to serve a timely
response, the following rules apply: (a) The party to whom the requests for
admission are directed waives any objection to the requests, including one
based on privilege or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4
(commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that
party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following
conditions are satisfied: (1) The party has subsequently served a response
that is in substantial compliance with Sections 2033.210, 2033.220, and
2033.230. (2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response was the
result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.” (CCP § 2033.280(a).)
“The court shall
make this order, unless it finds that the party to whom the requests for
admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a
proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial
compliance with Section 2033.220.” (CCP § 2033.280(c).)
 
TENTATIVE RULING 
On
August 17, 2023, Plaintiff served Requests for Production of Documents and
Requests for Admissions, Set One, on Defendant. (Sogoyan Decl. ¶ 8.)
As
of the date of the Sogoyan Declaration [April 8, 2024], Defendant had failed to
provide any responses to the discovery served on August 17, 2023. (See Sogoyan
Declarations; ¶ 10 & 13.) 
Defendant
submitted an untimely Opposition on 5/10/2024 stating that it served its
verified responses on May 10, 2024 to the instant discovery.
In
the Opposition papers, Defendant did not provide proof of verifications for any
of the discovery at issue. 
Motion
1 is DENIED as moot since Defendant provided responses after the motion was
filed. Sanctions would not be moot; however, Plaintiff did not request
sanctions.
As
to Motion 2, the Court will hear argument. Motion 2 pertains to RFAs. CCP §
2033.280(c) requires that responses must be in substantial compliance. The
Court will hear argument as no verifications have been provided.

Sanctions - Inspection Demands
In relevant part, § 2031.300(c) states:
Except as provided
in subdivision (d), the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to a demand for inspection,
copying, testing, or sampling, unless it finds that the one subject to the
sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make
the imposition of the sanction unjust.
 
(CCP §
2031.300(c).)
 
Sanctions –
Requests for Admission
“It is mandatory that the court impose a monetary
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) on the party or
attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a timely response to requests for
admission necessitated this motion.” (CCP § 2033.280(c).) 
Sanctions Ruling
“The
court may award sanctions under the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files
a motion to compel discovery, even though no opposition to the motion was
filed, or opposition to the motion was withdrawn, or the requested discovery
was provided to the moving party after the motion was filed.” (Cal. Rules of
Court, Rule 3.1348(a).) 
 
The Court will
discuss the issue of sanctions with counsel.
