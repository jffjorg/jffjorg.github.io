The Court notes that despite the scheduled hearing date, no documents have been filed with the Court for the motion. The Court emphasizes the importance of complying with the rules regarding service and filing of moving papers. Specifically, the Court highlights the need for the moving party to file the moving papers with the Court at the same time as serving the notice and supporting papers. The Court also notes that it is unclear who scheduled the hearing, as there is no notice of motion or papers filed with the Court to indicate who the moving party is.
