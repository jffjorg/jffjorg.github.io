Trial Date: UNSET
Case Name: ARTYOM GABRIELYAN, an individual; v. WING STREET RESIDENCE, LLC., a
limited liability company; CLIDE ABRAAMYAN, an individual; and DOES 1-25
TENTATIVE RULING
On 4/9/2024, this Court entered default judgment for Plaintiff, Artyom
Gabrielyan, and against Defendants, Clide Abraamyan and Wing Street Residence
LLC, on the Complaint filed on 08/11/2023. 
 
On 4/18/2024, Defendants, Wing Street Residence LLC and
Clide Abraamyan moved this Court for an order setting aside the entry of
default filed by Plaintiff and the default judgment entered by the Court on
April 9, 2024, and for leave to defend this action.
 
On 5/3/2024, Defendants’ counsel filed a stipulation and
proposed order to set aside entry of default and vacate default judgment. In
relevant part of the stipulation, it stated:
 
IT IS HEREBY STIPULATED
by and between the parties, through their respective attorneys of record, that
the defaults entered by the Clerk on October 18, 2023, and October 24, 2023, be
set aside and the default judgment entered on April 9, 2024, be vacated,
permitting defendants to file an answer to plaintiff’s Complaint within ten
(10) days of receipt of the signed Order setting aside default. The parties
agree that this Stipulation may be signed in counterparts and a facsimile
signature is as binding as an original.
 
(Stip. filed 5/3/2024, p.2.)
 
Since both Plaintiff and Defendants’ counsel signed the
stipulation, Defendants’ motion to set aside default and vacate default
judgment is GRANTED. The defaults entered on 10/18/2023 and 10/23/2024 are
vacated. The default judgments entered on 4/9/2024 are vacated. Defendants are
permitted to file an answer to Plaintiff’s Complaint within 10 days of receipt
of the signed order setting aside default.
