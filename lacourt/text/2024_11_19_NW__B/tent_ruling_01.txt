  Case Number:  22STCV04790    Hearing Date:   November 19, 2024    Dept:  B MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES TO FORM INTERROGATORIES, SET ONE, SPECIAL INTERROGATORIES, SET ONE, AND REQUEST FOR MONETARY SANCTIONS.Date of Hearing: November 19, 2024 Trial Date: February 18, 2025Department: B Case No.: 22STCV04790Moving Party: Defendant Suitable Staffing Solutions, Inc.Responding Party: Plaintiff Jamel Dupree PhillipsBACKGROUNDOn February 8, 2022, Plaintiff Yesenia Andrade (“Andrade”) filed this action against Defendants NGL Transportation, LLC (“NGL”), Pedro Millancova (“Millancova”), and Does 1 to 50 (collectively “Defendants”) alleging four causes of action: (1) negligence; (2) negligent hiring, retention, supervision, or training; (3) negligent entrustment; and (4) negligence per se.On January 30, 2023, Plaintiff Jamel Dupree Phillips (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint arising out of the same underlying motor vehicle accident against Defendants NGL, Millancova, and Does 1 to 50. The cases were consolidated on August 29, 2023.On November 29, 2023, Plaintiff filed an amendment to complaint identifying Suitable Staffing Solutions, Inc. (“Suitable Staffing”) as Doe 1.On June 6, 2024, the action was reassigned to the Honorable Karen Moskowitz in Department B at Van Nuys Courthouse East, effective June 24, 2024.On July 2, 2024, Suitable Staffing filed the instant motions to compel Plaintiff’s further responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One, and Special Interrogatories, Set One (“Discovery Motions”). Suitable Staffing also requests sanctions.On August 14, 2024, Plaintiff filed their oppositions.On August 21, 2024, Suitable Staffing filed their replies.[TENTATIVE] RULINGSuitable Staffing’s Discovery Motions are GRANTED.LEGAL STANDARDCal. Code of Civ. Proc. § 2030.300 provides, in pertinent part, that “[o]n receipt of a response to interrogatories, the propounding party may move for an order compelling a further response if the propounding party deems that any of the following apply: (1) An answer to a particular interrogatory is evasive or incomplete. (2) An exercise of the option to produce documents under Section 2030.230 is unwarranted or the required specification of those documents is inadequate. (3) An objection to an interrogatory is without merit or too general. (CCP § 2030.300(a).)Unless notice of a motion to compel further responses is given within 45 days of the service of the verified response, or any supplemental verified response, or on or before any specific later date to which the propounding party and the responding party have agreed in writing, the propounding party waives any right to compel a further response. (CCP §§ 2030.300(c).)Under California law, the objecting party has the burden of justifying its objections when the propounding party requests that the Court order further responses. (Coy v. Superior Court (1962) 58 Cal.2d 210, 220-221.) Further, under CCP § 2023.010, it is a misuse of discovery to make unmerited objections. (CCP § 2023.010(e).)DISCUSSIONMeet and Confer RequirementAs a preliminary matter, Plaintiff argues that Suitable Staffing did not satisfy the meet and confer requirement of § 2030.33(b), and the instant Discovery Motions should therefore be denied.A motion to compel further responses shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration. (CCP § 2030.300(b).) Upon receipt of Suitable Staffing’s Discovery Motions, Plaintiff requested and was granted two extensions, the last ending on May 14, 2024. (Hernandez Decl. ¶ 5; Exh. 2 [correspondences].) Plaintiff served their responses to Suitable Staffing’s Discovery Motions on May 14, 2024. (Ibid. at ¶ 6; Exh. 3 [Plaintiff’s responses].) On June 18, 2024, Suitable Staffing counsel contacted Plaintiff to meet and confer regarding further responses to the Discovery Motions. (Ibid. at ¶ 7; Exh. 4 [June 18, 2024, correspondence].) On June 28, 2024, Plaintiff requested another extension, but counsel were unable to come to an agreement. (Ibid. at ¶ 9; Exh. 6 [June 28, 2024, correspondence].) Suitable Staffing attempted multiple times to set an Informal Discovery Conference (“IDC”). (See Hernandez Reply Decl. ¶¶ 2-10; Reply Exhs. 1-8 [correspondences, notices, and objections re: IDC].) To date, defense counsel has not received supplemental discovery responses. (Hernandez Motion Decl. at ¶ 10.)Therefore, Suitable Staffing satisfies the meet and confer requirement of CCP § 2030.300(b).)Form Interrogatories, Set OneSuitable Staffing moves to compel Plaintiff’s further responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One, Nos. 8.6 and 8.7.The motion is granted as to Nos. 8.6 and 8.7. Form interrogatories were created and approved by the Judicial Council to allow discovery into information regarding an individual’s general background information. A party responding to these interrogatories owes a duty to respond in good faith as best as possible. (Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 771, 783.) Therefore, Plaintiff is ordered to provide verified, objection-free, supplemental responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One, Nos. 8.6 and 8.7.Special Interrogatories, Set OneSuitable Staffing moves to compel the Plaintiff’s further responses to Special Interrogatories, Set One, Nos. 8, 18, and 29.The motion is granted. The fact that Plaintiff may have been involved in other automobile collisions is wholly relevant to the injuries he claims were caused by the underlying accident. Additionally, Special Interrogatory No. 29 does not seek Plaintiff’s unrelated medical history as Plaintiff claims. Instead, it simply asks Plaintiff to identify the dates on which they were involved in any automobile accidents which occurred within three years after the incident subject of their complaint. (See Special Interrogatories, Set One, No. 29.) The question does not ask for medical records or history.Plaintiff is ordered to provide verified, objection-free, supplemental responses to Special Interrogatories, Set One, Nos. 8, 18, and 29.Monetary Sanctions“The court may impose a monetary sanction against a party engaging in the misuse of the discovery process, or any attorney advising that conduct” under CCP § 2023.030(a). A court has discretion to fix the amount of reasonable monetary sanctions. (Cornerstone Realty Advisors, LLC v. Summit Healthcare Reit, Inc. (2020) 56 Cal.App.5th 771, 791.)Here, Plaintiff failed to fully respond to Defendant’s Discovery Motions without substantial justification, constituting a misuse of the discovery process. Therefore, monetary sanctions are appropriate.Defendant requests monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,635.00 per motion, representing a $60.00 filing fee, four hours meeting and conferring, researching, and drafting the instant motions, and an anticipated three hours to review any opposition, draft reply, and appear for hearing, at an hourly rate of $225.00. (Hernandez Decl. ¶ 11.) The Court reduces monetary sanctions to $1,185.00 per motion, representing five hours of work per motion at an hourly rate of $225.00 and a $60.00 filing fee, as each motion pertained to only a few interrogatories. Therefore, the Court awards monetary sanctions against Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s counsel, jointly and severally, in the total amount of $2,370.00.CONCLUSIONBased on the foregoing, Defendant’s Discovery Motions are GRANTED.The Court ORDERS that Plaintiff provides verified, complete and code-compliant responses, without objections, to Defendant’s Form Interrogatories, Set One, Nos. 8.6. and 8.7, and Special Interrogatories, Set One, Nos. 8, 18, and 29 within 20 days of this hearing.Additionally, Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s counsel, jointly and severally, are ordered to pay $2,370.00 in monetary sanctions to defense counsel within 20 days of this hearing.Moving party is ordered to give notice.
