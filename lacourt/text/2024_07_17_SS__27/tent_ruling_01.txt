Ruling: MOTION TO CONTINUE TRIAL IS GRANTED TO A DIFFERENT DATE THAN
REQUESTED AND THE MSJ DATE IS  SPECIALLY
SET
 
On December 19, 2019,
Plaintiff filed the present premises liability case. On December 19, 2023,
Defendant Consolidated Disposal Service, LLC filed a Motion for Summary
Judgment to be heard on March 12, 2025. When the motion for summary judgment
was filed, the trial was set for April 3, 2024, but it has since been continued
to the current trial date of September 18, 2024. On May 31, 2024, the Court
denied Defendant’s motion to advance the hearing date on its MSJ due to the
Court’s congested calendar, stating, "Defendant was unable to secure a
hearing date earlier than the trial date because, as stated in its motion, the
earliest available date for the Court to hear the motion was March 12,
2025." Defendant now moves the Court to continue the trial date to
sometime in April 2025, 45 days after the Court hears Defendant’s motion for
summary judgment.
Numerous courts of
appeal have held that a trial court cannot refuse to consider a motion for
summary judgment that is timely filed. "A trial court may not refuse to
hear a summary judgment filed within the time limits of [Code of Civil
Procedure] section 437c. [Citation.] Local rules and practices may not be
applied so as to prevent the filing and hearing of such a motion." (Sentry
Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 526, 529); accord First
State Inc. Co. v. Superior Court (2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 324, 330
[invalidating case management order to the extent it precluded filing motions
pursuant to section 437c ]; Wells Fargo Bank v. Superior Court (1988)
206 Cal.App.3d 918, 923 [local court rule that "require a party filing a
complex summary judgment motion to file the motion six months before the date
set for trial is void and unenforceable because it is inconsistent with section
437c"].) As the Sentry court explained: "We are sympathetic to
the problems the trial courts experience in calendaring and hearing the many
motions for summary judgment. However, the solution to these problems cannot
rest in a refusal to hear timely motions." (Sentry, supra, at p.
530.) 
Plaintiff in his
opposition does not contest that Plaintiff’s MSJ was timely filed. Plaintiff argues
that there is no good cause for the continuance; however, the Court disagrees.
Continuing the trial date so the summary judgment motion can be heard
constitutes good cause. Numerous courts of appeal have held that a trial court
cannot refuse to consider a motion for summary judgment that is timely filed. (Sentry
Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 526, 529); accord First
State Inc. Co. v. Superior Court (2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 324, 330
[invalidating case management order to the extent it precluded filing motions
pursuant to section 437c ]; Wells Fargo Bank v. Superior Court (1988)
206 Cal.App.3d 918, 923 [local court rule that "require a party filing a
complex summary judgment motion to file the motion six months before the date
set for trial is void and unenforceable because it is inconsistent with section
437c"].)
Plaintiff contends that
the motion should not be granted because Defendant could have brought the same
arguments under a motion for judgment on the pleadings. The Court examined the
motion for summary judgment (MSJ) and found that Defendant raises specific
arguments, such as not owning the subject premises and the absence of evidence
of any dangerous condition. These arguments are appropriate for an MSJ, which
considers evidence outside the pleadings, rather than a motion for judgment on
the pleadings, where the allegations in the complaint are assumed to be true.
Plaintiff further
argues that Defendant was not diligent in bringing the motion. However, the
record shows that Defendant  filed a
motion to advance the MSJ and tried to have the MSJ heard prior to the current
trial date. Due to the Court’s congested calendar, the MSJ could not be heard
sooner. Plaintiff also did not cite any legal authority indicating how
Defendant’s alleged tardiness is relevant to the Court’s decision to continue
the trial so that the MSJ can be heard. As far as the Court is aware, the primary
consideration under such a scenario is whether the MSJ was timely filed, which
Plaintiff does not dispute in the opposition. As the Sentry court
explained: "We are sympathetic to the problems the trial courts experience
in calendaring and hearing the many motions for summary judgment. However, the
solution to these problems cannot rest in a refusal to hear timely
motions." (Sentry Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d
526, 530.)
Plaintiff correctly notes
out that this case was filed on December 19, 2019, and is thus nearing its
five-year limit on December 19, 2024. However, as a result of the COVID
pandemic, a 6-month extension of the 5-year limit is automatically added to
this case, making the 5-year limit expire on June 19, 2025.  Nonetheless, to ensure the matter is
addressed with sufficient time for trial and contrary to the usual practice in
the PI Hub of not specially setting motions because of the calendaring issues
that arise therefrom, the Court hereby specially sets the Motion for Summary
Judgment for September 18, 2024, at 1:30 p.m., and continues the trial to
October 30, 2024, at 8:30 a.m.  The only
basis to continue the trial date is so the motion for summary judgment can be
heard. Defendant has not shown good cause to have the fact discovery cut-off
follow the new trial date. Should the parties wish to reopen fact discovery,
they can do so either through stipulation or motion.  All other
case-related deadlines, including expert discovery, will follow the new trial
date.
