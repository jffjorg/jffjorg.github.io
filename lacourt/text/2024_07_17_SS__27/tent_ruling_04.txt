CASE NO./NAME: 23STCV03767 SUSANA DELGADO,
et al. vs MARTIN CARRILLO-MORALES 
Moving Party: Plaintiff Susan Delgado 
Responding Party: Defendants Karen Bourdain
and Martin Morales
Notice: Sufficient¿ 
Ruling: THE COURT WILL HEAR FROM THE PARTIES 
 
1.   Defendant Karen Bourdain’s Discovery Responses
On February 27, 2024, Plaintiff Susan Delgado served
Defendant Karen Bourdain with Special Interrogatories (Set One), Form
Interrogatories (Set One), Requests for Admission (Set One), and Requests for
Production (Set One). The statutory deadline to respond was March 31, 2024;
however, no responses were provided. On June 4, 2024, after no responses had
been provided, Plaintiff moved the Court to compel initial responses.
On June 7, 2024, Defendant Bourdain filed an
opposition stating that Defendant had served verified responses to Plaintiff
Susan Delgado’s Form Interrogatories (Set One), Requests for Production (Set
One), Special Interrogatories (Set One), and Requests for Admission (Set One).
Plaintiff did not file a reply contesting Bourdain’s opposition or service of
the discovery response. Thus, Delgado’s motions against Bourdain are therefore
moot.
2.  Defendant
Martin Morales’ Discovery Responses
On July 17, 2023, Plaintiff Susan Delgado served
Defendant Martin Morales with Form Interrogatories (Set One) and Special
Interrogatories (Set One). The due date for responses was August 17, 2023, but
no responses were served. On June 4, 2024, after no responses had been
provided, Plaintiff moved the Court to compel initial responses.
Defendant Martin Morales filed an opposition stating
that the responses at issue had been provided in 2023, but on July 9, 2024,
Defendant withdrew the opposition. The Court will hear from Defendant Morales
regarding the status of the discovery responses and whether they have been
provided prior to the hearing.
3.  Sanctions
Plaintiff seeks
sanction in the amount of $1,875 for each of the six discovery motions on the
calendar today. Defendant Bourdain’s counsel, in the opposition, requests that
all sanctions be imposed against his law firm, Martinez, Dieterich &
Zarcone Legal Group, only. Defendant’s counsel also requests to be heard. The
Court will accordingly also hear from the parties as to the issue of sanctions.
