And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court grants the motion to compel initial responses to Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, and Requests for Production of Documents propounded by the defendants. The plaintiff, Miguel Montes, has failed to respond to the discovery requests, despite multiple extensions granted by the defendants. The court orders the plaintiff to provide complete and verified responses to the discovery requests without objections within 30 days. The court also awards sanctions of $2,000 to the defendants, as the plaintiff's failure to respond to the discovery requests was not justified. The court finds that the plaintiff has failed to act with substantial justification in failing to respond to the discovery requests, and sanctions are mandatory in this case.
