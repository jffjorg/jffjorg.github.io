And here is the summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the defendant's motion to continue the trial date to allow for hearing of the motion for summary judgment. The plaintiff had opposed the motion, arguing that there was no good cause for the continuance. However, the judge disagrees with this argument and finds that continuing the trial date to allow for hearing of the motion for summary judgment constitutes good cause. The judge notes that the parties agree that the defendant's motion for summary judgment was timely filed, and that the court has a congested calendar, making it difficult to hear the motion earlier. The judge specially sets the motion for summary judgment for September 18, 2024, and continues the trial to October 30, 2024. The judge also orders that all other case-related deadlines, including expert discovery, will follow the new trial date.
