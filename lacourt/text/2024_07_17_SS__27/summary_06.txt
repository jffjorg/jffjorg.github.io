Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to limit the subpoenas for medical and radiology records in part. The plaintiff had sought to limit the subpoenas to treatments of only those body parts and medical conditions that she put at issue and from ten (10) years prior to the date of the subject incident to the present. The judge has agreed with this request and limited the subpoenas accordingly.

The judge has also denied the plaintiff's request for sanctions against the defendant. The plaintiff had sought sanctions because the defendant had served eight subpoenas for the plaintiff's insurance and medical records, which the plaintiff claimed were overly broad and intrusive.

The judge has balanced the interests of the parties and has limited the subpoenas to ensure that the plaintiff's privacy interests are protected while still allowing the defendant to gather relevant information for its defense. The judge has also noted that the plaintiff has satisfied the meet and confer requirement and has acted with substantial justification in bringing the motion.
