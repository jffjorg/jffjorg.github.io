Legal Standard
A defendant may make a demand for
inspection, copying, testing, or sampling without leave of court at any time.
Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.020, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.020, subd.
(a).) A plaintiff may make a demand for production of documents and propound
interrogatories without leave of court at any time 10 days after the service of
the summons on, or appearance by, the party to whom the demand is directed,
whichever occurs first. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.020, subd. (b); Code Civ.
Proc., § 2030.020, subd. (b).) A plaintiff may make a demand for
production of documents and propound interrogatories without leave of court at
any time 10 days after the service of the summons on, or appearance by, the
party to whom the demand is directed, whichever occurs first. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2031.020, subd. (b); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.020, subd. (b).) The demand for
production of documents is not limited by number, but the request must comply
with the formatting requirements in Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.030. A party
may propound 35 specially prepared interrogatories that are relevant to the
subject matter of the pending action and any additional number of official form
interrogatories that are relevant to the subject matter of the pending action.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.030, subd. (a)(1) - (a)(2).)¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿¿¿ 
The party whom the request is
propounded upon is required to respond within 30 days after service of a
demand, but the parties are allowed to informally agree to an extension and
confirm any such agreement in writing. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260, subd. (a);
Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.270, subd. (a)
- (b); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.270, subd. (a) - (b).)¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿¿¿ 
If a party fails to timely respond
to a request for production or interrogatories, the party to whom the request
is directed waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings under
Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.230, and waives any objection, including one based on
privilege or on the protection for work product. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300,
subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).)¿¿The party propounding the
discovery requests may move for an order compelling responses. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (b); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (b).) Unlike a motion to compel further discovery responses, a
motion to compel initial discovery responses does not have any meet and confer
requirements.¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿¿ 
Code of Civil Procedure section
2023.030, subdivision (a) provides, in pertinent part, that the court may
impose a monetary sanction on a party engaging in the misuse of the discovery
process to pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by
anyone as a result of that conduct. A misuse of the discovery process includes
failing to respond or submit to an authorized method of discovery. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (d).)¿¿¿A court has discretion to fix the amount of reasonable
monetary sanctions. (Cornerstone Realty Advisors, LLC v. Summit Healthcare
Reit, Inc. (2020) 56 Cal.App.5th 771, 791.) 
 
Discussion
On December 14, 2023,
Defendants Jack Chu and Esther Pang propounded Form Interrogatories, Special
Interrogatories, and Requests for Production of Documents (Set Ones) on
Plaintiff. The responses were due by January 17, 2024. Defendants granted
Plaintiff several extensions, with the final due date set for February 28,
2024. On February 26, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel filed a Motion to be Relieved
as Counsel, and on April 5, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel was relieved. Plaintiff
is currently in pro per. As of June 7, 2024, the date of the filing of this
motion, Defendants have not received the discovery responses at issue and
Defendants move the Court to compel responses. Plaintiff did not file an
opposition or any other document indicating that the responses at issue have
been served prior to the hearing. Thus, the present motions are granted.
Plaintiff is ordered to provide complete and verified responses to Defendants’
Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, and Requests for Production of
Documents (Set Ones) without objections within 30 days of today.
 
Defendants request
sanctions in the amount of $1,320 per motion. Sanctions are mandatory when a
party’s non-response forces the opposing party to file motions to compel or
deem admitted. The Court does not find Plaintiff to have acted with substantial
justification. However, given the simplicity of the issues, the Court reduces
sanctions to $2,000 for all three motions. Consequently, the Court grants
sanctions in the amount of $2,000. The Court ORDERS Plaintiff to pay sanctions
of $2,000 to Defendants within 30 days of today’s date.
