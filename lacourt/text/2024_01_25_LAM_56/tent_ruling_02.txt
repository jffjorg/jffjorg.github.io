  CASE NO.:  22STCV03159
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER RE: MOTIONS FOR
  RECONSIDERATION
 
Date: 
  January 25, 2024
Time: 8:30 a.m.
Dept. 56
Judge: Holly J. Fujie
 



 
MOVING PARTIES: Defendants Soon Hee Kwon (“Kwon”) and Yun Young Hwang
(“Hwang”) (collectively, “Moving Defendants”)
 
RESPONDING PARTY: Plaintiffs
 
The Court has reviewed the moving and opposition papers.  No reply papers were filed.  Any reply papers were required to have been
filed and served at least five court days before the hearing under California Code
of Civil Procedure (“CCP”) section 1005, subdivision (b). 
 
BACKGROUND
The currently operative first amended
complaint (the “FAC”) alleges 24 causes of action arising out of alleged
wrongful conduct that occurred in the course of a business relationship.  
 
 
On September 14, 2023, the Court granted
Plaintiffs’ motions to compel Moving Defendants’ depositions.  The Court’s September 14, 2023 ruling also
ordered Kwon to pay $2,767.15 and Hwang to pay $2,812.15 in monetary sanctions
to Plaintiffs. 
 
On September 20, 2023, Moving Defendants each
filed a motion for reconsideration (collectively, the “Motions”) to request
reconsideration of the Court’s September 14, 2023 order compelling Moving
Defendants’ depositions and requiring them to pay monetary sanctions.
 
DISCUSSION
Under CCP section 1008,
subdivision (a), when an application for an order has been made to a judge, or
to a court, and refused in whole or in part, or granted, or granted
conditionally, or on terms, any party affected by the order may, within 10 days
after service upon the party of written notice of entry of the order and based
upon new or different facts, circumstances, or law, make application to the
same judge or court that made the order, to reconsider the matter and modify,
amend, or revoke the prior order.  (CCP §
1008, subd. (a).)  The party making the
application shall state by affidavit what application was made before, when and
to what judge, what order or decisions were made, and what new or different
facts, circumstances, or law are claimed to be shown.  (Id.) 
A party seeking reconsideration must also provide a satisfactory
explanation for the failure to produce the evidence at an earlier time.  (Id.)  Facts of which the party seeking
reconsideration was aware of at the time of the original ruling are not “new or
different.”  (Garcia v. Hejmadi (1997)
58 Cal.App.4th 674, 690.)  The trial
court has discretion with respect to granting a motion for
reconsideration.  (New York Times Co. v. Superior Court (2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 206,
212.)
 
The Court finds that the
Motions fail to set forth new circumstances, facts, or law that were not known
at the time of the September 14, 2023 hearing.[1]  The Motions argue, without citations to
authority, that the Court’s imposition of monetary sanctions was excessive.[2]  Moreover, the Motions’ overarching arguments
appear targeted at the veracity of the claims alleged in the FAC rather than
the legal basis for granting discovery motions. 
The Court therefore DENIES the Motions. 
 
 
Moving parties are ordered to give notice of this
ruling. 
 
 
 
 
 
Parties who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to
the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed by the instructions provided on
the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive
an email and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed
off calendar. 
 
 
  Dated
this 25th day of January 2024
