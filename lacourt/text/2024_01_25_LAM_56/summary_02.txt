And here is the English-text summary:

The Court has reviewed the motions for reconsideration filed by defendants Soon Hee Kwon and Yun Young Hwang, seeking to reverse the court's previous order compelling their depositions and imposing monetary sanctions. The court finds that the motions fail to present new facts, circumstances, or law that were not known at the time of the original ruling. The motions argue that the monetary sanctions were excessive, but do not provide any authority to support this claim. The court therefore denies the motions.
