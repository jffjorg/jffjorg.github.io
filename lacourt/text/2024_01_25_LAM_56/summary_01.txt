And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has reviewed the motion for an assignment order filed by Plaintiff Joyce Faye Atlas, which seeks to assign rental payment rights to satisfy the judgment entered against Defendant Mike H. Davidyan and his alter-ego company on October 27, 2023. The motion also requests that the Court restrain Defendant from disposing of rental payments or properties and from threatening or taking adverse action against tenants for complying with the assignment order.

The judge finds that Plaintiff has sufficiently demonstrated a right to an assignment order, citing California Code of Civil Procedure section 708.510, subdivision (a), which allows the court to order the assignment of a right to payment due or to become due, including rental payments. The judge also notes that the principal of the judgment and court-awarded attorney's fees remain unsatisfied.

The judge grants the motion and orders Defendant's tenants to assign their rental payment rights to Plaintiff to satisfy the judgment. The judge also orders Plaintiff to give notice of this ruling.
