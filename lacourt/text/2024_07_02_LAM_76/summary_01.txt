And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the motion to set aside the default judgment entered against the defendants, ROC Capital Holdings, Lucas Sambrook, and Loan Funder LLC, Series 8688. The Judge found that the defendants' answer to the original complaint is sufficient and that the amended complaint did not add new causes of action. The Judge relied on the case of Carrasco v. Craft to support this finding, stating that when a complaint is amended after an answer has been filed, the defendant is not required to file a new answer, and the original answer remains valid. The Judge also noted that the amended complaint did not add significant new allegations against the defendants, and that the default judgment was improper.
