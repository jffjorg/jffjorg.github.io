ANALYSIS
 
Motion To Set Aside Default
 
Discussion
 
Defendants ROC Capital Holdings,
Lucas Sambrook, and Loan Funder LLC, Series 8688 move to set aside the entry of
default against them. On March 27, 2024, default as entered against Lucas
Sambrook, an individual; ROC Capital Holdings, LLC, a Business Entity, and on
April 11, 2024, default was entered against Loan Funder, LLC and Series 8688, a
Business Entity.
 
The ground for this motion is that
Moving Defendants filed a Verified Answer to the Second Amended Complaint,
which stands as Moving Defendants Answer to the Third Amended Complaint and
states a sufficient defense to the Third Amended Complaint. Defendants cites Carrasco
v. Craft (1985) 164 Cal.App.3d 796, which state as follows:
 
In Gray v. Hall (1928) 203 Cal. 306 [265 P. 246], the court, in a watershed
decision, stated as follows: "It has been generally held that where a
plaintiff amends his declaration or complaint so as to change the cause of
action, or add a new one, it constitutes an abandonment of the original issues,
and judgment by default may be taken against the defendant if he fails to a new
or amended answer or plea within the time allowed therefore, notwithstanding
the original answer or plea is still on file. [Citations.] Thus rule is
without application, however, where the amendment is merely as to formal or
immaterial matters, and does not change the cause of action;  [*809] 
nor does it apply where the original plea or answer set forth a sufficient
defense to the declaration or complaint as amended. [Citations.]
 
[TEXT OMITTED ]
Not Certified for Publication. ". . . 'In short,
when a complaint is amended after answer, the defendant is not bound to
answer de
novo. He may do so if he chooses; but, if he does not elect to do so,
his original answer stands as his answer to the amended complaint; and in such
case he will not be in default except as to the additional facts set up in the
amended complaint, and not put in issue by the answer. . . .'" ( Id., at pp. 310-311, 313.) The court went on to hold
that entry of a default in a case where the original answer can stand as
an answer to the amended complaint constitutes error.

(Carrasco v. Craft (1985) 164 Cal.App.3d
796, 808-09 [bold emphasis added].)
 
On December 5,
2022, Plaintiff filed the 2AC. Then, on December 6, 2022, Plaintiff filed
another “2AC,” which was in effect a 3AC, without leave of court. This was
ordered stricken by the Court on September 12, 2023. On January 5, 2023,
Defendants ROC Capital Holdings, LLC, Loan Funder LLC, Series 8688 and Lucas
Sambrook filed a Verified Amended Answer to the 2AC. Thereafter, on September
11, 2023, Plaintiff filed a 3AC. 
 
Defendants argue
that, with respect to the allegations against Moving Defendants, the 3AC was
identical in nearly all material respect to the 2AC.  Both the 2AC and 3AC contained the same five
causes of action.  The 2AC contained 107
separate paragraphs and a nine-paragraph prayer for relief. (Moran Decl., ¶
14.) The 3AC contained 110 paragraphs and a nine-paragraph prayer for relief.
(Id.) Two of the three paragraphs that were added to the 3AC contain
allegations solely against Defendant Fidelity. 
(Id., at Ex. H.)  With respect to
the third new paragraph (Paragraph 89), it alleges as follows:     
 
“Under California Civil Code §
3294(c)(3), fraud means an intentional misrepresentation, deceit, or
concealment of a material fact known to the defendant with the intention on the
part of the defendant of thereby depriving a person of property or legal rights
or otherwise causing injury. On May 5, 2021, Defendants including FIDELITY
caused a Notice of Trustee’s Sale to be recorded against Plaintiff’s Property
indicating that the loan was outstanding in the amount of  400,184.00 which, once again, was an erroneous
amount. Thereafter, on July 9, 2021, Defendants caused Plaintiff’s property to
be sold to an individual named JOE PARADA at public auction. Defendant PARADA
paid a total of $437,845.43 for the property, one cent over the opening bid.
Defendants including 
FIDELITY caused a Trustee’s Deed
Upon Sale to be recorded on August 26, 2021, which transferred title of the
Property to PARADA.” (Moran Decl., Ex. H.)
  

Although Paragraph
89 was a “new” addition to the 3AC, nearly all of the allegations contained in
Paragraph 89 are not new.  They were
copied and pasted from other portions of Plaintiff’s 2AC (that did not apply to
Fidelity) and restated to ensure that the allegations now to Fidelity in
addition to the other defendants.  (See
e.g. 2AC ¶¶ 80-81).
 
Plaintiff has not
filed an opposition to demonstrate that the foregoing is inaccurate. Based on
the representations of Defendants’ counsel, entry of default as to these
Defendants as to the 3AC was improper, because they were entitled to stand on
the Answer to the 2AC. (Carrasco, supra, 164
Cal.App.3d at 808-09.)
 
As such, the motion to set
aside default is GRANTED.
