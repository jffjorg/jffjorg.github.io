And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the motion to quash subpoena filed by Clifford Sullivan, a cross-defendant in the case. The subpoena sought privileged information and information not subject to discovery. The Court finds that the Plaintiffs, Zalfa Halaby and Charles Elkins, were not substantially justified in opposing the motion and awards sanctions against them in the amount of $1,200. The Court also awards Sullivan $1,120 in sanctions for four hours of attorney time. The ruling is based on the principles of attorney-client privilege and the discovery rules of the California Code of Civil Procedure.
