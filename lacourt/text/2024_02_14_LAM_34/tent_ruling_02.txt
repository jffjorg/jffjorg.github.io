ANALYSIS:
 
I.         
Legal
Standard
 
California Code of Civil Procedure requires a
response from the party to whom the request for admissions is directed within
30 days after service of the request for admissions. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2033.250, subd. (a).)
 
If the party fails to serve a timely response,
“the party to whom the requests for admission are directed waives any objection
to the requests.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (a).)
 
The requesting party may then “move for an
order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters
specified in the requests be deemed admitted, as well as for monetary sanction
under Chapter 7.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).)
 
A court will deem requests admitted, “unless
it finds that the party to whom the requests for admission have been directed
has served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the
requests for admission that is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220.
It is
mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing
with Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to
serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)
 
II.      
Discussion
 
A. 
    The
Discovery Requests
 
State Farm General Insurance Company moves the Court to deem admitted
the requests in the requests for admission (“RFAs”) against Win.it America, Inc. and Winit America Trade Company Limited. (RFAs
Motion Against Win.it, Inc., p. 5:18–20; RFAs Motion Against Winit Limited, p.
5:21–23.)
 
In their respective oppositions, Win.it
America, Inc. and Winit America Trade Company Limited submit evidence to the
Court that indicates responses to the RFAs were served on January 26, 2024.
(Opposition to RFAs Motion Against Win.it, Inc., Exh. C; Opposition to RFAs
Motion Against Winit Limited, Exh. C.) 
 
State Farm
General Insurance Company notes that these responses are late and only filled
with objections and denials. (Reply to RFAs Motion Against Win.it, Inc., p.
2:11–13; Reply to RFAs Motion Against Winit Limited, p. 2:12–14.)
 
It is
undisputed that the responses are late and that they are filled with objections
and denials. But ultimately, after the boilerplate objections, the responding
parties have responded to the RFAs. They need only have provided affirmations,
denials, or notice of lack of information to the RFAs, and they have done so. 
 
Thus, these
motions are moot. 
 
The Court
DENIES as moot the RFAs Motion Against Win.it, Inc. and the RFAs Motion Against
Winit Limited.
 
B. 
    Sanctions
 
State Farm General Insurance Company requests $3,060.00 in monetary
sanctions for each of the motions. (RFAs Motion
Against Win.it, Inc., p. 5:18–20; RFAs Motion Against Winit Limited, p.
5:21–23.)
 
It appears that Win.it America,
Inc.’s and Winit America Trade Company Limited’s responses to the discovery motions were
untimely. 
 
The Court finds no evidence showing that there was substantial
justification or other circumstances that would make the imposition of a
sanction unjust. Thus, the Court must impose a monetary sanction on Win.it America, Inc. and Winit America Trade Company Limited. 
 
Counsel for State Farm General Insurance Company declares: (1) that
their hourly rate is $500.00 per hour; (2) that they will have spent six hours
on each of these discovery motions; and (3) that they incurred a $60.00 filing
fee for each of these motions. (RFAs Motion
Against Win.it, Inc., Decl. Letofsky, ¶ 6; RFAs Motion Against Winit Limited,
Decl. Letofsky, ¶ 6.)
 
The Court finds that the hourly rate and costs incurred are reasonable.
However, the hours incurred for the hearings are duplicative, and the motions
are unlikely to have taken as long as claimed. The Court will allow monetary
sanctions for a total of six hours of work (three hours per motion), plus the
costs for the motions (also split by motion).
 
The Court AWARDS monetary sanctions for State Farm General Insurance
Company and against Win.it America, Inc. in the amount of $1,560.00. 
 
The Court AWARDS monetary sanctions for State Farm General Insurance
Company and against Winit America Trade Company Limited in the amount of $1,560.00.

 
III.     Conclusion
 
The RFAs
Motion Against Win.it, Inc. and the RFAs Motion Against Winit Limited are
DENIED as moot.
 
Monetary sanctions are AWARDED for State Farm General Insurance Company
and against Win.it America, Inc. in the amount of $1,060.00. 
 
Monetary sanctions are AWARDED for State Farm General Insurance Company
and against Winit America Trade Company Limited each in the amount of $1,560.00.
