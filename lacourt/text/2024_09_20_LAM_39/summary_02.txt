  - "Where a defendant brings a motion to strike under section 425.16 based on a claim that the plaintiff's action arises from activity by the defendant in furtherance of the defendant's exercise of protected speech or petition rights, but either the defendant concedes, or the evidence conclusively establishes, that the assertedly protected speech or petition activity was illegal as a matter of law, the defendant is precluded from using the anti-SLAPP statute to strike the plaintiff's action."

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion to strike a complaint filed by the Personnel Commission of the Montebello Unified School District and Law Office of Willoughby & Associates, Inc. against Mark Skvarna, Capitol Advisors Group, LLC, Norma Copado, Alvarez-Glasman & Colvin, Jeff Marderosian, and Elizabeth Cabrera. The defendants claim that the Commission's actions were taken in furtherance of a constitutional right and seek to strike the complaint.

The judge finds that the defendants have failed to make a prima facie showing that the Commission's actions were taken in furtherance of a constitutional right. Specifically, the Commission's declaration of a conflict of interest and hiring of outside counsel were lawful under Education Code section 45313, and the defendants' refusal to approve invoices for legal services was unlawful.

As a result, the judge denies the defendants' motion to strike and orders them to pay for the Commission's legal services. The judge also orders the defendants to give notice of this order and file proof of service.
