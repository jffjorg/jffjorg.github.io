MOTION
            Plaintiffs
and Judgment Creditors MHJ Group, Inc. and Kai Hou Liang (“Plaintiffs”) move to
foreclose on a charging order against the membership interests of Defendant and
Judgment Debtor AA Sunrise, Inc. (“Defendant”) in Yorba Linda Garden, LLC
(“Yorba Linda Garden”).  The Court
entered judgment against Defendant in the amount of $7,700,000 in its order of
September 5, 2023.  In its order of
February 5, 2024, the Court issued a charging order against Defendant’s
interest in Yorba Linda Garden.  (See
February 5, 2024 Minute Order.)  In its
order of July 15, 2024, the Court granted Plaintiffs’ motion for foreclosure on
Defendant’s interests in Yorba Linda Garden. 
(See Hellman v. Anderson (1991) 233 Cal.App.3d 840, 852; Corps. Code,
§§ 15907.03, subd. (b), 16504, subd. (b), 17705.03, subd. (b).)  
Plaintiffs now
seek to hold an auction of Defendant’s interest in Yorba Linda Garden.  However, it is the levying officer, not the
judgment creditor, who conducts an auction. 
(Code Civ. Proc., §§ 701.510, 701.520.) 
As such, the Court directs Plaintiffs to the Los Angeles County
Sheriff’s Department Civil Division, which acts as a levying officer for writs
of sale.
Plaintiffs are to
give notice of this order and to file proof of service of such.
