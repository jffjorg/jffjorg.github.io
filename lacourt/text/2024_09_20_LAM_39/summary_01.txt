And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion for attorneys' fees filed by the defendant, LA-Fig Parking Lot Lessee, LLC, after the plaintiffs, Mohill Holdings, LP and MO Foundation Holdings, LLC, voluntarily dismissed their claims against the defendant. The defendant argues that it is the prevailing party and is entitled to attorneys' fees, while the plaintiffs argue that the defendant is not the prevailing party because the claims were voluntarily dismissed.

The judge rules that the defendant is the prevailing party because the plaintiffs' claims are based on the defendant's holdover possession and are therefore non-contractual. The judge notes that the defendant has not provided billing records to support its request for attorneys' fees, but has provided a declaration from its attorney stating that the number of hours billed are commensurate with the tasks performed.

The judge awards the defendant $60,000 in attorneys' fees, which includes $10,000 incurred with respect to litigating this motion for attorney fees. The judge finds that this amount is reasonable in light of the nature of the litigation, its difficulty, and the skill required and success of the attorney's efforts.
