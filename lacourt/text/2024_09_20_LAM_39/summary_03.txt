And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in plain English:

The judge is considering a motion to foreclose on a charging order against AA Sunrise, Inc.'s (Defendant) interest in Yorba Linda Garden, LLC. The charging order was issued after the court entered a judgment against the Defendant in the amount of $7,700,000. The court has already granted the Plaintiff's motion for foreclosure, and now the Plaintiffs are seeking to hold an auction of the Defendant's interest in Yorba Linda Garden. However, the judge notes that it is the levying officer, not the judgment creditor, who conducts the auction. The judge directs the Plaintiffs to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department Civil Division, which acts as a levying officer, and requires the Plaintiffs to give notice of this order and file proof of service.
