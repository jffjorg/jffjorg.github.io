The plaintiff, State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company, has moved to deem requests for admissions (RFAs) admitted against the defendant, Mariana Diaz-Zamora, and has also requested monetary sanctions of $460.00. The defendant did not file an opposition to the motion. The court has granted the motion, finding that the plaintiff is entitled to an order deeming the matters specified in the requests as admitted due to the defendant's failure to respond to the RFAs.

The court requires the parties to engage in a meet and confer prior to the hearing date to attempt to resolve the discovery conflicts without the need for court intervention.
