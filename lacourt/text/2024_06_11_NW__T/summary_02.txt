And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the Plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to RFP Set 1 from the Defendant FCA. The judge denies the Plaintiff's motion with respect to most of the requests, finding the Defendant's supplemental responses sufficient. However, the judge grants the Plaintiff's motion with respect to request 19, finding the request overbroad and harassing. The judge also denies the Plaintiff's motion with respect to request 73, finding it not related to the 2022 Ram 1500 vehicle at issue.
