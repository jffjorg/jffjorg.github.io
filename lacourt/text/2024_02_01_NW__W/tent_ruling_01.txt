BACKGROUND
 
Plaintiff Mark A. Liker alleges
Defendant Eliezer Appel, in his capacity as a California licensed attorney,
instructed Plaintiff to purchase certain real property for $250,000.00 to
Defendant Cochran Inc. and promised Plaintiff a return on his investment as
well as plaintiff would take ownership of the property or that the property
would secure Plaintiff’s investment. Plaintiff further alleges Eliezer Appel
concealed from Plaintiff the fact that plaintiff did not own the property or
the company that took title to the property that is, the Defendant Lockhart
Development, Inc., and that Eliezer Appel took Plaintiff’s investment for his
own gain. 
 
On November 24, 2020, Plaintiff Mark A.
Liker filed a complaint against Defendants Eliezer Appel, Lockhart Development,
Inc., and Cochran Inc. asserting a single cause of action for fraud. Plaintiff
filed a Second Amended Complaint on August 30, 2023, asserting new causes of
action – breach of contract, negligent misrepresentation, intentional
misrepresentation, conspiracy to commit fraud, and breach of attorney fiduciary
duty/duty of loyalty. 
 
On February 11, 2021, Lockhart
Development, Inc. filed a cross-complaint against Mark A. Liker asserting
causes of action for (1) Breach of Written Contract; (2) Intentional or
Negligent Interference with Contractual Relations; (3) Interference with Prospective
Economic Advantage; (4) Breach of Fiduciary Duty; (5) Declaratory Relief; (6) Implied
Contractual Indemnity; and (7) Slander of Title. 
 
On October 20, 2022, Appel filed a
cross-complaint against Liker, the California Neurological Institute, and Avi
Marciano asserting causes of action for (1) Violation of Physician’s Medical
Practice Act (MPA); (2) Undue Influence (CA Welfare & Institutions Code
15610.70); (3) Negligent Infliction of Extreme Emotional Distress (NIED); (4) Intentional
Infliction of Extreme Emotional Distress (IIED); (5) Intentional Interference with
Prospective Economic Advantage; and (6) Civil Extortion.      
 
This action is related to Marc A.
Larocque v. Christine Larocque Franz, et al. (LC105233). 
 
[Tentative] Ruling
 
Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant Mark A. Liker’s Motion for Attorneys’
Fees is GRANTED. 
 
discussion
 
Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant Mark A. Liker moves the court for an
award of attorney fees and costs against Cross-Complainant Lockhart pursuant to
Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16. Liker makes the motion on the grounds that
on November 7, 2023, the Second District Court of Appeal affirmed the
anti-SLAPP order and judgment entered July 30, 2021 by this court after
granting Mark A. Liker’s Special Motion to Strike, and that an award of
attorney fees and costs to Liker as prevailing party in the appeal is mandatory.
 
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16(c), a
prevailing defendant is entitled to recover attorneys’ fees and costs
associated with the motion. Under CRC 3.1702 and CRC 8.104, a request for
attorneys’ fees must be made within 60 days of service of the notice of entry
of judgment. A defendant may only recover fees and costs related to the motion
to strike. (Lafayette Morehouse, Inc. v. Chronicle Publishing Co. (1995)
39 Cal.App.4th 1379, 1383.) This includes fees associated with bringing the
motion for fees. (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1141 (“an
award of fees may include not only the fees incurred with respect to the
underlying claim, but also the fees incurred in enforcing the right to
mandatory fees under Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16.”).) Additionally,
“[a]ny fee award must also include those incurred on appeal. [Citation.]” (Trapp
v. Naiman¿(2013) 218 Cal.App.4th 113, 122.)¿ 
 
On July 30, 2021, this court granted Liker’s anti-SLAPP motion and
on November 7, 2023, the Court of Appeal affirmed this court’s order. Accordingly,
Liker’s motion for attorneys’ fees is proper and Liker is entitled to recover
attorneys’ fees and costs. 
 
The court further finds the attorney fees and costs sought herein reasonable.
Liker requests $14,717.50 in attorney fees and $596.10 in costs. Counsel’s
hourly rate is $400. (Arnold Decl., ¶6.) Based on Mr. Arnold’s experience, his
hourly rate is reasonable in the community of practice. Moreover, an appeal
from an anti-SLAPP motion is complex in nature and requires the submission of
declarations and evidence akin to a motion for summary judgment or a
preliminary injunction.¿Counsel for Liker also provides a billing statement
listing the tasks, time incurred, and costs incurred by Liker in this action
for the anti-SLAPP Motion to date. (Arnold Decl., Exh. B.) The billing
statement of the attorney fees and costs incurred on the motion and the
declaration by counsel demonstrate the reasonableness of the time spent on this
case.
 
Accordingly, Liker’s unopposed motion for attorneys’ fees
is granted in the total amount of $14,717.50 in attorney fees and $596.10 in
costs.
