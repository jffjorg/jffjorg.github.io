[1] Petitioner was
previously known as Darcy French Cornwell. 



[2] The court credits
this testimony over that of Sergeant Linder, who was not certain a kiss
occurred, or Officer Evans, who testified that the kiss lasted two
seconds.  
 


[3]
The court need not consider whether Petitioner’s alcohol
consumption was excessive.  Count One was
not predicated on that issue.
