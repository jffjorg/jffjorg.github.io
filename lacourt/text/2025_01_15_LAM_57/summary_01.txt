And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer of Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant Adam Michael Perzow to the First Amended Cross-Complaint of Defendants/Cross-Complainants Accolade, Inc. and MD Insider, Inc. The demurrer is sustained in part without leave to amend and overruled in part. Perzow is directed to file an answer to the cross-complaint by January 31, 2025.

The Court found that the first cause of action in the cross-complaint, which seeks a declaration of Perzow's ownership interest in MDI's intellectual property, is not a collateral attack on a 2017 judgment entered in Orange County Superior Court against MDI. The Court also found that the fraud-based claims in the fifth, sixth, and seventh causes of action are not a collateral attack on the judgment.

However, the Court found that the fraud-based claims in the second, third, and fourth causes of action do reflect a collateral attack on the judgment, as they were given up through a release in the settlement agreement. The Court sustained the demurrer to these claims without leave to amend.

The Court also found that the claim for breach of fiduciary duty is not barred by the statute of limitations, as the Defendants did not discover the factual bases of the claim until 2022.

Overall, the Court's tentative ruling sets the stage for further litigation and requires Perzow to file an answer to the cross-complaint by January 31, 2025.
