```

And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied the Defendant's motion to compel the Plaintiff to provide further responses to requests for production of documents that were made during the Plaintiff's deposition. The Defendant's motion was defective because it did not include a separate statement that sets forth the requests and the responses to the requests, including objections. Additionally, the motion was filed more than 60 days after the deposition was completed, which is contrary to Code of Civil Procedure Section 2025.480(b). The Judge finds that the Defendant should have filed a motion to compel responses if the Plaintiff did not provide any responses at all, rather than a motion to compel further responses.
