And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The City of Bell Gardens has moved for summary judgment, arguing that it did not own and control the drain catch basin where the plaintiff, Barbara Spatz, fell off her bicycle. The City argues that the plaintiff's complaint is that the drain catch basin should have been covered with a cross-hatched grate to prevent the accident, but the City did not own or control the drain catch basin. The City also argues that its actions were reasonable and therefore it is immune from liability.

The plaintiff and the County of Los Angeles oppose the motion, arguing that there are triable issues of material fact regarding the ownership and control of the drain catch basin. The County argues that the City's evidence does not meet its burden of showing that it did not own or control the drain catch basin, and that the Court should deny the motion.

The Court has reviewed the evidence and concludes that there are triable issues of material fact regarding the ownership and control of the drain catch basin. The Court also notes that there are conflicting agreements and plans regarding the ownership and maintenance of the drain catch basin.

Based on the foregoing, the City's motion for summary judgment is denied. The parties are encouraged to meet and confer to see if they can reach an agreement. If a party intends to submit on this tentative ruling, the party must send an email to the Court with the subject line "SUBMIT" followed by the case number.

English text:
This tentative ruling is for the case 21STCV13985, scheduled for a hearing on September 26, 2023. The case is about an alleged dangerous condition of public property, where the plaintiff, Barbara Spatz, fell while riding her bicycle over a non-cross-hatched vertical grate in the bike lane of westbound Florence Ave. near the intersection of Emil Avenue. The plaintiff alleges the non-cross-hatched vertical grate in the bike lane constituted a dangerous condition. The City of Bell Gardens and the County of Los Angeles filed cross-complaints against each other. The City of Bell Gardens now moves for summary judgment, which is denied. The City argues it is entitled to summary judgment because it did not own and control the drain catch basin that the plaintiff alleges caused the accident. However, the plaintiff asserts both the City and the County are responsible for the catch drain basin, and that the catch basin is located within the City’s streets and easement area. The County contends the City’s motion does not reference the exact location of the subject incident, and that the exact location of the catch basin is in dispute. The City replies that the catch basin is located in the northeast corner because the plaintiff testified she crossed the intersection of Emil Ave. when the incident occurred. The court grants the City’s request for judicial notice of the plaintiff’s Claim for Damages and the City’s claim rejection notice to the plaintiff, but denies the request for the photograph attached to the plaintiff’s Claim for Damages and the Map of Los Angeles County Storm Drain System. The court finds that the City did not meet its burden to show that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and that there exist triable issues of material fact raised by both the plaintiff and the County to deny the City’s motion.
