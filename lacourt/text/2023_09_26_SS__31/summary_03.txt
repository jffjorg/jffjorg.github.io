And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motions to compel the defendant, Miguel Reyes, to respond to discovery requests. The plaintiff had propounded form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and request for production of documents on October 27, 2022, but the defendant failed to serve responses. The plaintiff seeks to compel the defendant to respond without objections and pay sanctions. The judge finds that the defendant was properly served and failed to respond, and therefore grants the motion. The judge also imposes sanctions on the defendant and his counsel in the amount of $1,184.95, which includes attorney fees and costs. The judge orders the defendant to serve verified responses to the discovery requests within 20 days.
