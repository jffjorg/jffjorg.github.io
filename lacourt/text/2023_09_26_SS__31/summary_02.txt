**English Text Summary:**

In this case, Plaintiff Dion Nawrocki's lawyer, Peter Hakim, has filed a motion to be relieved as counsel. The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting this motion. 

The judge states that there has been a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship, making it difficult for Hakim to effectively represent Nawrocki. Hakim has attempted to address these issues, but they remain unresolved.  

While service of the motion was initially made via mail, Hakim also emailed Nawrocki, who confirmed receipt and responded directly. The judge considers this sufficient notice.

The trial in this case is currently scheduled for May 21, 2024, providing ample time for Nawrocki to find new representation.
