And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled to grant the motion to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff Dion Nawrocki's attorney, Peter Hakim, Esq. of Downtown LA Law Group. The reason for the motion is a breakdown of the attorney-client relationship, which Counsel claims has prevented effective representation. Counsel has made extensive efforts to remedy the issues with Plaintiff, but Plaintiff has refused to comply. The judge has found that there is sufficient time for Plaintiff to seek new counsel, given the current trial date set for May 21, 2024. The judge has ordered Counsel to give notice and has encouraged the parties to meet and confer to reach an agreement. The hearing will proceed as scheduled, unless the parties submit to the tentative ruling by email or appear remotely or in person for oral argument.
