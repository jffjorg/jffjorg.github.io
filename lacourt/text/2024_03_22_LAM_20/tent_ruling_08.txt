Plaintiff Sofia Zermoglio seeks to compel further responses to her form interrogatories (employment), set one, and requests for production, set one, from Defendant LA Opinion, LP and her requests for production, set one, special interrogatories, set one, and form interrogatories (employment), set one, from Defendant Impremedia Operating Co., LLC.Defendants contend they are willing to supplement their responses and would like to continue to meet and confer.At this time it seems that an order to compel responses would be premature.  The Motions to Compel are, thus, denied without prejudice.  The Court declines to award sanctions at this time.  The parties are to continue meeting and conferring. The Court notes that there is absolutely no reason that there should be nine motions to compel further responses on the docket as to only Plaintiff’s first set of discovery, particularly when the trial date is in May 2026.  Moving party to give notice.If counsel do not submit on the tentative, they are strongly encouraged to appear by LACourtConnect rather than in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
