And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion of cross-complainants to file a Second Amended Complaint. The cross-complainants seek to add six new parties and nine new causes of action to their complaint. The judge finds that the cross-complainants have diligently pursued discovery and only recently discovered the facts giving rise to the new claims. The judge also finds that the cross-complainants complied with the California Rules of Court and that leave to amend is generally required to be liberally granted. The judge notes that the opposition did not demonstrate that the cross-complainants were dilatory or that they will be prejudiced by the amendment. Therefore, the motion is granted, and the cross-complainants are ordered to file the Second Amended Complaint within five days.
