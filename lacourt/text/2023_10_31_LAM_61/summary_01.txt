And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is granting in part the motion to reopen discovery filed by Plaintiffs Miaoxin Yu and Jesse Weiner. The motion is granted in that Plaintiffs are allowed to take the deposition of Defendant Jianxiang Shi. This is the only Defendant for whom Plaintiffs have identified prior efforts to obtain their deposition, and Plaintiffs have shown good cause for reopening discovery solely to take this deposition. However, the motion is denied in all other respects, as Plaintiffs have not shown good cause to take any other depositions or to propound further written discovery.
