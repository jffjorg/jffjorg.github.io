County of Los Angeles’s Motions to Compel Responses to Form Interrogatories and
Requests for Production from Plaintiffs Leah Garcia and Jaylene Rea are DENIED
as moot. 
 
Defendant to give notice.
 
I.                  
MOTION TO
COMPEL & DEEM ADMITTED
A propounding party may demand a responding
party to produce documents that are in their possession, custody or control.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.010.) A party may likewise conduct discovery by
propounding interrogatories to another party to be answered under oath. (Code
Civ. Proc. § 2030.010, subd. (a).) The responding party must respond to the
production demand either by complying, by representing that the party lacks the
ability to comply, or by objecting to the demand. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.210.) The responding party must respond to the interrogatories by
answering or objecting. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.210, subd. (a).) If the
responding party fails to serve timely responses, the propounding party may
move for an order compelling responses to the production demand and
interrogatories. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, 2031.300.) 
 
A
party who fails to serve a timely response to interrogatories or a demand for
inspection waives any objection to the demand. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290,
2031.300.)
Defendant County of Los Angeles seeks an order compelling
responses to form interrogatories and requests for production served upon
Plaintiffs Leah Garcia and Jaylene Rea on May 25, 2023. (Aslam Decl. ¶¶ 9–10.)
Despite several notices to Plaintiffs’ counsel that responses were due and
overdue, no responses have been provided. (Aslam Decl. ¶¶ 12–13, Exh. I.)
 
Plaintiffs have filed a response indicating that responses
were served on October 17, 2023, the date their opposition to the present
motions were due. 
 
Defendant in reply contends that the motions are not mooted
by the responses, as the responses contain several deficiencies, such as the
production of only two documents, the identification of broad swaths of
responsive documents without any specificity, defective statements of inability
to comply, and evasive interrogatory responses. (Reply at pp. 5–6.)
 
The motions are moot. Defendant sought to compel responses
to form interrogatories and requests for production from Plaintiffs, and
responses have been provided. The deficiencies that Defendant identifies are
beyond the scope of the present motions, which seek only to compel the
provision of responses pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure §§ 2030.290 and
2031.300. The “evasive or incomplete” character of these responses is properly
the subject of a motion to compel further responses, authorized under Code of Civil
Procedure §§ 2030.300 and 2031.310. Defendant seeks no sanctions in its motions
to compel.
 
The motions are therefore DENIED.
