And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The defendant, November First Partnership, has made a motion to compel the deposition of the plaintiff, Ultimate Action, LLC's person most qualified (PMQ) and Ted Fox. The defendant claims that they have attempted to secure these depositions since February 2021, but to no avail. The plaintiff argues that they have proposed to allow the depositions to take place, but the defendant has failed to stipulate to dates for its own witnesses.

The court finds that there has been substantial delay in the scheduling of depositions, and that an order compelling the deposition of the plaintiff's PMQ and Ted Fox on December 11 and 12, 2023 is appropriate. However, the court does not award sanctions against the plaintiff, as the evidence shows less a unilateral effort at delay by the plaintiff than irreconcilable differences in the parties' approaches to scheduling. The motion is granted, and the defendant is ordered to give notice.
