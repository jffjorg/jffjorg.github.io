And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the County of Los Angeles's motions to compel responses to form interrogatories and requests for production from Plaintiffs Leah Garcia and Jaylene Rea. The Defendant had sought to compel responses and deem admitted the responses, but the Judge has denied the motions as moot. The Judge notes that despite several notices to Plaintiffs' counsel, no responses were provided until October 17, 2023, and that the responses contain several deficiencies. However, the Judge finds that these deficiencies are beyond the scope of the present motions, which only seek to compel the provision of responses. The Judge concludes that the motions are therefore denied.
