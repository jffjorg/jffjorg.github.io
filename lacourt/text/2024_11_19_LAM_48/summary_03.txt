And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled to continue the hearing on Cross-Defendants' motion for summary adjudication. Cross-Complainants have requested a continuance to conduct discovery and oppose the motion. The judge has determined that Cross-Complainants need more time to gather evidence and that Cross-Defendants' deficient discovery responses have hindered their ability to oppose the motion. The judge has set deadlines for a supplemental opposition and reply and has instructed the parties to be prepared to discuss the scheduling of depositions and related dates at the hearing. The motion for summary adjudication is continued to a future date, and the parties are required to file amended oppositions and replies.
