And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the motion for trial preference filed by the minor plaintiffs (under the age of 14) who were injured in a civil action. The motion is mandatory under California Code of Civil Procedure section 36, subdivision (b), as the plaintiffs meet the requirements for mandatory preference. The judge finds that the plaintiffs have a substantial interest in the case and grants the motion without weighing the interests of the parties. The hearing will proceed on November 19, 2024, where the parties will discuss their discovery plan and select FSC and trial dates.
