  CASE NO.: 23STCV20273
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING MOTIONS TO BE
  RELIEVED AS COUNSEL
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
November 19, 2024



 
Byron
Moldo, Kelly Scott, Catherine Veeneman, and Morgan Kutzner of Ervin Cohen &
Jessup LLP, counsel of record for Defendants David Hopp M.D., Andrew Hopp, and Youthfill
MD XIX LLC, seek to be relieved as counsel. 
Counsel’s declaration states that there has been an irreparable breakdown
in the attorney-client relationship that prevents counsel from continuing to represent
Defendants.
Absent
a showing of resulting prejudice, an attorney’s request for withdrawal should be
granted.  (People v. Prince (1968)
268 Cal.App.2d 398, 406.)  Counsel’s motions
comply with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362.  Trial is not until March 16, 2026, and there is
no prejudice to Defendants.
The
unopposed motions to be relieved are GRANTED and effective upon filing a proof of
service showing service of the signed Form MC-053 orders and this order on David
Hopp M.D., Andrew Hopp, Youthfill MD XIX LLC, and all parties who have appeared.
However,
“a corporation cannot represent itself in a court of record either in propria persona
or through an officer or agent who is not an attorney.”  (Caressa Camille, Inc. v. Alcoholic Beverage
Control Appeals Bd. (2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 1094, 1101.)  Therefore, an Order to Show Cause Re: Failure
to Retain New Counsel for Youthfill MD XIX LLC is scheduled for March 27, 2025 at
8:30 a.m. in Department 48 at Stanley Mosk Courthouse.
Youthfill
MD XIX LLC must retain new counsel by that date or the Court will place it in default.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
 
        
Dated this 19th day of November 2024
