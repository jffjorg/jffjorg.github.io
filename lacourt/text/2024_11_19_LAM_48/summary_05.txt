Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to take depositions of two non-expert witnesses, Mardiros Mihranian M.D. and Sousse Yaacoubian, beyond the discovery cutoff date. The witnesses were disclosed by the defendant on August 9, 2024, but the parties were unable to agree on the terms of the depositions. The judge has limited the depositions to 45 days and has denied the defendant's request to limit the depositions to one hour and specific topics. The judge has also denied the plaintiff's request for sanctions. The motion to reopen discovery is granted, and the parties are required to submit any objections to the tentative ruling by email.
