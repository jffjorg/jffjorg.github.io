  CASE NO.: 21STCV24038
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING MOTION FOR LEAVE
  TO AMEND COMPLAINT
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
November 19, 2024



 
On June 29, 2021, Plaintiff Larchmont Place LLC filed this
action, and on August 22, 2024, it filed a first amended complaint.
On October 25, 2024, Plaintiff filed a
motion for leave to file a second amended complaint.
The
Court may, in its discretion and after notice to the adverse party, allow an amendment
to any pleading.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 473,
subd. (a)(1).)  A motion to amend a pleading
must include a copy of the proposed amendment or amended pleading which must be
serially numbered to differentiate it from previous pleadings or amendments and
must state what allegations in the previous pleading are proposed to be deleted
or added, if any, and where, by page, paragraph, and line number, the allegations
are located.  (California Rules of Court,
rule 3.1324(a).)  The motion shall also be
accompanied by a declaration attesting to the effect of the amendment, why the amendment
is necessary and proper, when the facts giving rise to the amended allegations were
discovered, and why the request for amendment was not made earlier.  (California Rules of Court, rule 3.1324(b).)
Plaintiff
identifies the proposed amendments and provides a copy of the proposed second amended
complaint, including a redlined version. 
(Kashfian Decl. ¶ 13.)  Plaintiff seeks
to add Defendants Temple Williams and Circle W Productions Inc. to the caption page
(see Code Civ. Proc., § 422.40; California Rules of Court, rule 2.111(4)) and to
include a new cause of action for unjust enrichment.  Plaintiff’s counsel explains that, upon reviewing
the pleadings in early October 2024 following service of Defendants’ answers, counsel
discovered facts that supported an additional cause of action for unjust enrichment
as an alternative theory of liability against Defendants.  (Kashfian Decl. ¶ 11.)  This cause of action was not previously asserted
due to counsel’s oversight and inadvertence. 
(Kashfian Decl. ¶ 17.)
Defendant
Cyndi Finkle opposes the motion on the grounds that unjust enrichment is not a cause
of action.  The Court does not ordinarily
consider the validity of the proposed amended pleading when determining whether
to grant leave to amend.  (Kittredge Sports
Co. v. Superior Court (1989) 213 Cal.App.3d 1045, 1048.)  However, the Court does note that although unjust
enrichment is generally not a cause of action, a court may construe a cause of action
for unjust enrichment as a cause of action for quasi-contract seeking restitution.  (Rutherford Holdings, LLC v. Plaza Del Rey
(2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 221, 231.)
Because
there is no showing of prejudice, the motion for leave to amend the complaint is
GRANTED.  The Second Amended Complaint, received
on October 25, 2024, is deemed filed as of November 19, 2024.
Moving
party give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
