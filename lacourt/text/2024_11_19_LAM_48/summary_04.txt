Here is a brief English-text summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge has tentatively ruled in favor of dismissing the demurrers of three defendants: Gloria Corrales, Tandy Motley, and Pilot Travel Centers LLC. The demurrers were filed in response to the plaintiffs' claims of negligence, fraud, and conversion. The Judge found that the plaintiffs failed to adequately plead their claims against the defendants, specifically citing deficiencies in their allegations of duty, causation, and damages. The Judge has ordered the defendants dismissed from the action without leave to amend.
