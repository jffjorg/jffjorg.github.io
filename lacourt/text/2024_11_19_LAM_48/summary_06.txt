Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted a motion to compel the deposition of Jaguar Land Rover North America, LLC's person most knowledgeable (PMK) and the production of certain documents. The motion was filed by Howard Song and Hye Song, who are suing the defendant for alleged defects in a vehicle. The defendant had objected to the deposition topics and dates, but the judge has overruled these objections and ordered the defendant to produce its PMK and the requested documents within 30 days. The judge has also denied the plaintiff's request for sanctions. The parties are ordered to submit on the tentative ruling, and no appearances before the court are required unless a companion hearing is also on calendar.
