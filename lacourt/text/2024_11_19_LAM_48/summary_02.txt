And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the plaintiff's motion for leave to file a second amended complaint. The plaintiff seeks to add two new defendants to the caption page and include a new cause of action for unjust enrichment. The judge notes that while unjust enrichment is generally not a cause of action, it can be construed as a cause of action for quasi-contract seeking restitution. The judge finds that there is no showing of prejudice and therefore grants the motion. The second amended complaint is deemed filed as of November 19, 2024. The parties who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court indicating their intention to submit.
