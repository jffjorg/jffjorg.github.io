Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the Demurrer filed by the Defendants, Sylvia Quintanilla, Adriana Quintanilla, and Isaac Quintanilla, against the Complaint filed by the Plaintiffs, Cynthia Rangel and Jose Rangel. The Demurrer argues that the Complaint does not state sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action for Implied and Prescriptive Easements.

The Court has sustained the Demurrer with 20 days' leave to amend, finding that the Plaintiffs cannot be granted an easement over property which they allege to be their own. The Court also granted leave to amend the Demurrer to add an additional ground that Plaintiff Cynthia Rangel is not a proper plaintiff.

The Court denied the request for judicial notice of a Grant Deed, citing a lack of authentication through a sworn affidavit. The Court also denied the demurrer as to Plaintiff Cynthia Rangel on this basis.

The Plaintiffs are granted leave to amend their Complaint as they have not amended it yet.
