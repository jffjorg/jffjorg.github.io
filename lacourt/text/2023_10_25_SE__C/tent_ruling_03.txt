Plaintiff Alliant
Credit Union’s unopposed application for writ of possession is GRANTED. No
bond. 
 
Moving Party to give NOTICE.
 
 
Plaintiff Alliant
Credit Union (Plaintiff) applies for a writ of possession pursuant to CCP §
512.010 et seq.
Background
On October 24, 2022,
Plaintiff filed this lawsuit against Defendant Juan R. Garcia (Defendant) for
claim and delivery of personal property and writ of possession and restraining
order and money due on contract arising out of Defendant’s alleged failure to
make payments pursuant to a financing contract for a 2021 Grand Design M-397TH.
Plaintiff alleges that Defendant failed to make payments under the contract
beginning on April 8, 2021 and it is entitled to possession of the vehicle
under the terms of the contract. 
Discussion
If the proof of service
is filed on or before the hearing, the following analysis applies:
Upon the filing of the
complaint or at any time thereafter, the plaintiff may apply for a writ of
possession. (CCP § 512.010(a).) The application shall include all of the
following, which may be established by affidavit, pursuant to CCP § 512.101(b):
 
1.   
The
basis of the plaintiff’s claim that the plaintiff is entitled to possession;
2.   
A
showing that the property is wrongfully detained and of the manner in which
defendant came into possession; 
3.   
A
particular description of the property and a statement of its value;
4.   
The
property’s location based on plaintiff’s knowledge, information and belief; and

5.   
A
statement that the property has not been seized by statute or execution against
it. 
 
The writ will be issued
if the plaintiff’s claim is probably valid. (CCP § 512.040(b).) A writ to take
possession of property at a private location requires the plaintiff to show
probable cause that the property is located there. (CCP § 512.060(b).)
Plaintiff presents
evidence that it is the true owner of the 2021 Grand Design M-397TH, VIN
573FM4532M1118679. (Chism Decl., ¶ 4.) Plaintiff states that Defendant signed a
contract with Plaintiff to finance the purchase of the vehicle and default of
the repayment terms of the contract granted Plaintiff the right to immediate
possession of the vehicle. (Chism Decl., ¶ 4.) Plaintiff states that Defendant
defaulted on the repayment terms beginning on April 8, 2021 and currently owes
$123,426.84 under the contract. (Chism Decl., ¶ 5.) Defendant has failed to
surrender possession of the vehicle to Plaintiff. (Chism Decl., ¶ 9.) Plaintiff
is informed that the vehicle is currently at 25017 Harker Lane, Moreno Valley,
CA 92551. (Chism Decl., ¶ 10.) 
Based on Plaintiff’s declaration and lacking
any opposition, Plaintiff’s claim is probably valid. 
Undertaking: A bond
must be posted as part of the undertaking unless the court finds that the
defendant has no interest in the property. (CCP § 515.010(b).) The undertaking
must be in an amount equal to twice the value of the defendant's interest in
the property (market value less all liens, etc.). (CCP § 515.010.) Defendant’s
interest is based on the market value of the property less (1) any amount due
and owing on any conditional sales contract or security agreement, (2) all
liens and encumbrances on the property, and (3) any other factors to determine
the defendant’s interest in the property. (CCP § 515.010(a).)
Defendant has no interest in the property. Plaintiff
is not required to post an undertaking.  
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff Alliant Credit Union’s
application for writ of possession is GRANTED. No bond.
