And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants Alliant Credit Union's unopposed application for a writ of possession to take possession of a 2021 Grand Design M-397TH vehicle from defendant Juan R. Garcia. The vehicle is currently located at 25017 Harker Lane, Moreno Valley, CA. The plaintiff alleges that the defendant failed to make payments under a financing contract starting from April 8, 2021, and is entitled to possession of the vehicle under the terms of the contract. The judge finds that the plaintiff's claim is probably valid and that the defendant has no interest in the property, therefore, no bond is required.
