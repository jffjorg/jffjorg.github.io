And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the Pacific Southwest District of the Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod's (PSD) special motion to strike the cross-complaints filed by Peace Lutheran Church (PLC) and Chastity Carvel (Carvel) in part. PSD's motion was granted as to PLC's Second through Tenth Causes of Action and Carvel's First through Fourth Causes of Action, and denied in part as to PLC's First Cause of Action.

PLC's First Cause of Action for declaratory and injunctive relief was denied because PSD has satisfied its burden of showing that PLC's claims are based on an act in furtherance of its right to petition. However, PLC's claims for unjust enrichment and constructive trust were struck because they are not causes of action.

PLC's Second Cause of Action for unfair business practices was struck because PLC failed to provide evidentiary support for its claim. PLC's Third Cause of Action for breach of contract was struck because PLC failed to establish that PSD's constitution and bylaws are a contract between PLC and PSD.

PLC's Sixth through Tenth Causes of Action for fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, and emotional distress caused by litigation were struck because PLC failed to provide sufficient evidentiary support for its claims.

Carvel's claims were also struck because she failed to provide evidentiary support for her claims. Carvel's First Cause of Action for abuse of process was struck because she failed to provide support for her claim beyond simply filing or maintaining the underlying lawsuit for an improper purpose. Carvel's Second and Third Causes of Action for emotional distress caused by litigation were struck because the causes of action are barred by law.
