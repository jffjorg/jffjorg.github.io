Defendant’s Demurrer to the entire Complaint
is sustained without leave to amend.
Moving Party to give NOTICE.
 
Defendant Downey Smile Center (Defendant)
demurs to the only cause of action in Complaint on the grounds that it fails to
state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.
Background
On
January 23, 2023, Plaintiff Marcel Padilla (Plaintiff) filed his Complaint for
Dental Malpractice against Defendants Estella Flores, DDS, and Downey Smile
Center. Plaintiff alleges that Defendant Flores, while working at Downey Smile,
negligently broke his tooth while extracting it. 
Legal
Standard
The party against whom
a complaint has been filed may object to the pleading, by demurrer, on several
grounds, including the ground that the pleading does not state facts sufficient
to constitute a cause of action. (CCP § 430.10(e).) A party may demur to an
entire complaint, or to any causes of action stated therein. (CCP § 430.50(a).)
Discussion

Defendant argues that the only cause of action,
Dental Malpractice, is barred by the statute of limitations because the
Complaint was filed more than one year after the discovery of the injury. “In
an action for injury or death against a health care provider based upon such
person's alleged professional negligence, the time for the commencement of
action shall be three years after the date of injury or one year after the
plaintiff discovers, or through the use of reasonable diligence should have
discovered, the injury, whichever occurs first.” (CCP § 340.5.) Here, Plaintiff
alleges in his Complaint that he “sent a notice of his intention to commence
action based upon Defendants[‘] negligence” on January 27, 2021. Thus, it is
evident from the face of the Complaint that Plaintiff discovered his injury by
January 27, 2021 and had until January 27, 2022 to file his Complaint. However,
Plaintiff filed his Complaint on January 23, 2023. Therefore, the Complaint
fails to state a claim because the Dental Malpractice cause of action is barred
by the statute of limitations. Thus, Defendant’s Demurrer to the entire
Complaint is sustained.
Additionally, leave to amend is not granted
because Plaintiff has failed to show in what manner his Complaint could be
amended. A demurrer should be sustained without leave to amend if there is no
reasonable possibility the complaint can be cured by amendment. (Levya v.
Nelson (2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 1061, 1063.) The burden is on the plaintiff to
show in what manner he can amend his complaint and how the amendment would
change the legal effect of his pleading. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18
Cal 3d. 335.)
 
Accordingly, Defendant’s
Demurrer to the entire Complaint is sustained without leave to amend.
