And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge, C Padilla, has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Marcel Padilla v. Estella Flores, DDS, and Downey Smile Center. The Judge has sustained the Defendant's Demurrer to the entire Complaint without leave to amend. The Demurrer was based on the grounds that the Complaint fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, specifically that the Dental Malpractice cause of action is barred by the statute of limitations. The Plaintiff had until January 27, 2022 to file his Complaint, but did not do so until January 23, 2023, more than one year after the statute of limitations had expired. The Judge has denied leave to amend the Complaint because the Plaintiff has failed to show in what manner his Complaint could be amended to cure the defects. The case will proceed to a hearing on October 25, 2023.
