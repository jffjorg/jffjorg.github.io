The judge has also granted in part and denied in part the motions to compel further deposition testimony from Jack Saadia and Paul Reisz. The judge has ordered further deposition testimony on certain questions related to Saadia's criminal history, his understanding of the Right of First Offer, and his intent to exercise the ROFO.

The judge has denied the requests for sanctions against Saadia and All-Ways, finding that they acted with substantial justification in their actions. The judge has ordered All-Ways to produce certain documents and communications related to the property.

The case involves disputes between Saadia Square, Square Mile, and All-Ways over a property in Rialto, California, and the parties' alleged breaches of contract, covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and intentional interference. The case will proceed to a hearing on October 25, 2023.
