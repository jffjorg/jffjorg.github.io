NOOSHA SHAHEEDY 
  
        
  vs.
 
FORD MOTOR
  COMPANY, et al. 
 


 Case
  No.:  23STCV02444
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  January 31, 2024



 
                                                                    
Plaintiff is
awarded $7,520.00 in reasonable attorney fees.  
 
Given that
Plaintiffs’ motion did not include a verified memorandum of cost, the Court
does not consider the cost award at this time. 

 
            On
2/3/2023, Plaintiff Noosha Shaheedy (Plaintiff) filed suit against Ford Motor
Company and Santa Monica Ford Lincoln, alleging violations of the Song-Beverly
Act and negligent repair. 
 
            Now,
Plaintiff moves for attorney fees totally $21,878.00 and costs totaling
$1,149.19. 
 
Legal Standard 
 
The party
claiming attorneys’ fees must establish entitlement to such fees and the
reasonableness of the fees claimed.  (Civic Western Corporation v. Zila
Industries, Inc. (1977) 66 Cal.App.3d 1, 16.) “Except as attorney’s fees
are specifically provided for by statute, the measure and mode of compensation
of attorneys and counselors at law is left to the agreement, express or
implied, of the parties[.]” (CCP § 1021.)
 
“It is well
established that the determination of what constitutes reasonable attorney fees
is committed to the discretion of the trial court, whose decision cannot be
reversed in the absence of an abuse of discretion.”  (Melnyk
v. Robledo (1976) 64 Cal.App.3d 618, 623.) 
In exercising its discretion, the court should
consider a number of factors, including the nature of the litigation, its
difficulty, the amount involved, the skill required in handling the matter, the
attention given, the success or failure, and the resulting judgment.  (Ibid.) 
 
In
determining what constitutes a reasonable compensation for an attorney who has rendered
services in connection with a legal proceeding, the court may and should
consider the nature of the litigation, its difficulty, the amount involved, the
skill required and the skill employed in handling the litigation, the attention
given, the success of the attorneys’ efforts, their learning, their age, and
their experience in the particular type of work demanded the intricacies and
importance of the litigation, the labor and necessity for skilled legal
training and ability in trying the cause, and the time consumed. (Stokus v. Marsh (1990) 217 Cal.App.3d
647, 657 (Stokus).) 
 
In
determining the proper amount of fees to award, courts use the lodestar
method.  The lodestar figure is
calculated by multiplying the total number of reasonable hours expended by the
reasonable hourly rate.  “Fundamental to
its determination … [is] a careful compilation of the time spent and reasonable
hourly compensation of each attorney … in the presentation of the case.”  (Serrano
v. Priest (1977) 20 Cal.3d 25, 48 (Serrano
III).)  A reasonable hourly rate must
reflect the skill and experience of the attorney.  (Id.
at 49.)  “Prevailing parties
are compensated for hours reasonably spent on fee-related issues.  A fee request that appears unreasonably
inflated is a special circumstance permitting the trial court to reduce the
award or deny one altogether.”  (Serrano v. Unruh (1982) 32 Cal.3d 621,
635 (Serrano IV); see also Weber v. Langholz (1995) 39 Cal.App.4th
1578, 1587 (“The trial court could make its own evaluation of the reasonable
worth of the work done in light of the nature of the case, and of the
credibility of counsel’s declaration unsubstantiated by time records and
billing statements.”)
 
Reasonable
attorney fees should be based on an objective standard of reasonableness, i.e.,
the market value of services rendered, not on some notion of cost incurred. (PLCM Group, Inc. v. Drexler (2000) 22
Cal.4th 1084, 1090.)  The value of legal
services performed in a case is a matter in which the trial court has its own
expertise.  (Id. at 1096.)  The trial
court may make its own determination of the value of the services contrary to,
or without the necessity for, expert testimony. 
(Ibid.)  The trial
court makes its determination after consideration of a number of factors,
including the nature of the litigation, its difficulty, the amount involved,
the skill required in its handling, the skill employed, the attention given,
the success or failure, and other circumstances in the case.  (Ibid.)
 
Discussion 
 
Plaintiff
seeks attorney fees totally $21,878.00. 
 
Plaintiffs’
counsel claims the following hourly rates for the attorneys who worked on this
case: 
 
-        
Michael Saeedian: $695/hr
-        
Christopher Urner: $525/hr 
-        
Jorge Acosta: $250/hr (law clerk)
 
In Morris
v. Hyundai Motor Am. (2019) 41 Cal. App. 5th 24, 41, the trial court
reduced the rates of Bryan Altman of the Altman Law Group, who has 30-plus
years of litigation experience with over 100 jury trials, of which 20-plus were
as lead trial counsel in lemon law cases, from $650 to $500 per hour, reduced
Steve Mikhov of the Knight Law Group from $500 to $400, and reduced all the
associates’ rates that ranged from $450 to $350 to $300 per hour. (Id. at 8-9.)
In support of the lower court decision, the court of appeal held that:
 
[E]ven if
Morris established that her attorneys’ rates were generally commensurate with
other consumer law attorneys with the same level of experience and skill,
Morris ignores that there are a number of factors that the trial court may have
taken into consideration in determining that reductions in the attorneys’
hourly rates were warranted. The court reasonably could have reduced the rates
based on its finding that the matter was not complex; that it did not go to
trial; that the name partners were doing work that could have been done by
lower-billing attorneys; and that all the attorneys were doing work that could
have been done by paralegals.
 
            (Id.
at pp. 23-24.)
 
            Similarly,
Judge Randolph Hammock of the Los Angeles County Superior Court recently found
rates of $350 per hour appropriate for an “experienced” lawyer to take a lemon
law case all the way through trial. (See Mikhaeilpoor v. BMW of N. Am., LLC
(2020) 48 Cal.App.5th 240, 245-46 [“The court found the requested fee amount
“was just not reasonable.”… The court decided that $350 “is a reasonable hourly
rate for the services that were done.”].)
 
            Here,
the Court finds the hourly rates to be unreasonable, and, based on case law,
reduces the hourly rates for each of plaintiffs’ attorneys to a reasonable
blended $400 per hour for all attorneys who litigated this case, consistent
with Mikhaeilpoor. This is also informed by the fact that this case did
not address novel or difficult questions, and was straightforward and simple. 
 
Hours
 
            Plaintiff’s
counsel claims a total of 42.1 hours. However, as detailed in Defendant’s
opposition, the billing records indicate padding and unreasonable billings. For
example, counsel claims 1.4 hours related to the business decision of
determining whether to represent Plaintiff, and 9.1 hours related to this
motion for attorney fees. As noted by Defendant, this means that 25% of the
billings here only benefited counsel. (See Opp., 8:23-24.) 
 
Moreover,
despite using form documents for discovery, counsel billed 1.7 hours to draft
and file the form complaint, (Proudfoot Decl., Exhs. A-B), and 4.0 hours on
template discovery requests (Id., Exhs. E-F)
 
            The
Court agrees with Defendant’s contention that 23.3 hours of the total hours
claimed were not reasonably incurred. This leaves 18.8 hours reasonably
incurred. At an hourly rate of $400/hr, this brings the total attorney fees
award to $7,520.00.
 
            Plaintiff
did not file a Verified Memorandum of Costs, and thus the Court has not
considered the request for costs. 
 
It is so ordered.
