  vs.
 
JOELLE M. DRUCKER, et al. 
  


 Case
  No.:  23STCV21506    
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  January 31, 2024




 
            Defendant’s demurrer is SUSTAINED, WITHOUT LEAVE TO
AMEND.  
 
            On 9/7/2023, Plaintiff Mid-Valley Industrial Center
(Plaintiff) filed suit against Joelle M. Drucker, Drucker Law Offices,
Elizabeth T. Pierson, and Gillpierson, LLP, alleging: (1) legal malpractice;
(2) breach of fiduciary duty; and (3) breach of contract. 
 
            Now, Defendants Elizabeth T. Pierson and Elizabeth T.
Pierson dba Gillpierson, LLP (collectively, Pierson Defendants) demur to
Plaintiff’s Complaint. 
 
            The motion is unopposed.
 
Factual Background
 
Plaintiff
alleges that it engaged Co-Defendant Joelle M. Drucker (Ms. Drucker) on or
about June 17, 2022 for representation in connection with the underlying
probate proceeding styled In re Estate of Brett Andrew Bereny, Los
Angeles Superior Court Case No. 22STPB04561 (the Underlying Proceeding)
(Complaint, ¶ 8.) Plaintiff alleges that Ms. Drucker agreed to file a claim
based upon rents owed by the decedent in the Underlying Proceeding in the
amount of $356,440. (Complaint, ¶ 9.)
 
Plaintiff
alleges that her file was transferred to the Pierson Defendants after Ms.
Drucker experienced a medical emergency. 
 
Plaintiff
alleges that when she later inquired with the Pierson Defendants about the
status of her claim, it learned that no claim had been filed. Thus, Plaintiff
contends that it lost the ability to pursue a claim based on unpaid rents.
(Complaint, ¶ 12.)
 
Discussion 
 
            Pierson Defendants argue that Plaintiffs claim against
them is time-barred as a matter of law.
 
            In support, Pierson Defendants note that the decedent in
the Underlying Proceeding died on September 5, 2021. (Request for Judicial
Notice (RJN, Exh. 2.) While this date is not alleged as part of Plaintiff’s
Complaint, the date of death is listed in the official Petition for Probate. (Ibid.)
The Court may properly take judicial notice of the records of “any court of
record of the United States,” as well as “[o]fficial acts of the legislative,
executive, and judicial departments of the United States and of any state of
the United States.” (Evid. Code § 452, subds. (c), (d); see also Greenspan
v. LADT LLC (2010) 191 Cal.App.4th 486, 525 (holding that trial court
properly took judicial notice of arbitration award under Evidence Code section
452, subdivision (d).)
 
            CCP section
366.2 provides:
 
(a)   If a person against whom an action may be brought on a
liability of the person, whether arising in contract, tort, or otherwise, and
whether accrued or not accrued, dies before the expiration of the applicable
limitations period, and the cause of action survives, an action may be
commenced within one year after the date of death, and the limitations
period that would have been applicable does not apply.
 
(emphasis
added.)
 
“Upon
a person's death, Code of Civil Procedure section 366.2 ‘provides for an
outside time limit of one year for filing any type of claim against a
decedent.’” (Estate of Holdaway (2019) 40 Cal.App.5th 1049, 1053, emphasis
added.) A creditor’s claim tolls section 366.2’s limitations period only if it
is filed before the one-year limitations period elapses. (See Dobler v.
Arluk Medical Ctr. Indus. Group (2001) 89 Cal.App.4th 530, 535-536 [“[I]f a
claim is not filed in a probate proceeding . . . within the one-year limitation
period of Code of Civil Procedure section 366.2, a creditor will be forever
barred from asserting a claim against the decedent”].)
 
Indeed,
Probate Code section 9100—which establishes the deadlines for filing a
creditor’s claim in a probate administration—expressly provides that “[n]othing
in this section shall be interpreted to extend or toll any other statute of
limitations or to revive a claim that is barred by any statute of limitations.
The reference in this subdivision to a ‘statute of limitations’ includes
Section 366.2 of the Code of Civil Procedure.” (Prob. Code § 9100, subd. (c),
emphasis added.) Thus, the statute of limitations for a creditor’s claim in a
probate administration is the earlier of (a) one year after date of death or
(b) four months after letters testamentary had been issued. In the Underlying
Proceeding, the earlier of those two dates was September 5, 2022
 
Here,
decedent died on 9/5/2021. Accordingly, Plaintiff had one year to commence a
claim. Ms. Drucker first transferred Plaintiff’s file to the Pierson Defendants
on 11/18/2022. Accordingly, at the time of transfer, Plaintiff’s claim had
already expired. 
 
A claim
asserting that an attorney failed to timely file an underlying lawsuit requires
that the plaintiff “must first plead and prove that at the critical times in
question there existed the relationship of attorney and client with its
accompanying responsibilities.” (Shelly v. Hansen (1966) 244 Cal.App.2d
210, 214; accord Stuart v. Superior Court (1992) 14 Cal.App.4th 124, 128
(affirming summary judgment where the attorney defendant was not counsel of
record at “critical in time in question” when damage occurred).) Here, as set
forth above, the “critical time” regarding the underlying claim for unpaid
rents was between September 5, 2021 and September 5, 2022—i.e., the one-year
limitations period under Code of Civil Procedure 366.2. Any creditor’s claim to
be filed in that time period needed to be filed before the one-year period
elapsed. But the Complaint establishes that the Pierson Defendants were not
involved at all until November 2022. (Complaint, ¶ 10.) 
 
Moreover,
it is axiomatic that an attorney is only liable where a claimant can establish “a
proximate causal connection between the negligent conduct and the resulting
injury . . . .” (Thompson v. Halvonik (1995) 36 Cal.App.4th 657, 661; Kasem
v. Dion-Kindem (2014) 230 Cal.App.4th 1395, 1399.) Thus, Plaintiff must
establish that but for the Pierson Defendants’ alleged misconduct, it would not
have suffered damages. (Viner v. Sweet (2003) 30 Cal.4th 1232.)
 
Here,
Plaintiff has not alleged facts which could show that Defendants caused
Plaintiff’s damage when the claim had expired before Defendants ever become
involved with Plaintiff’s claim. 
 
Plaintiff did
not file an opposition. The Court takes this to be a concession to the merits
of Defendants’ motion. Plaintiff has not set forth any argument that the deficiencies
identified could be addressed through amendment. Accordingly, the Court is
without any basis to award leave to amend. (McDonald v. Superior Court
(1986) 180 Cal.App.3d 297, 303- 304.)
 
Based on the
foregoing, Defendants’ demurrer is sustained, without leave to amend.  
 
It is so ordered.
