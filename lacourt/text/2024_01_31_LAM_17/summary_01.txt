And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case where the plaintiff, Yi He, is seeking to have her requests for admission (RFAs) deemed admitted against the defendant, Bank of America, National Association, and Thomas Flores. The defendant had requested extensions to respond to the RFAs, and eventually provided responses. The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion, citing the fact that the defendant has provided substantially code-compliant responses. The judge has also declined to award sanctions against the defendant, finding that the counsel's failure to timely respond was an oversight based on the circumstances of the day. The judge has ordered that the motion be denied, and has encouraged parties who wish to submit on the tentative to do so by email by the day prior to the hearing.
