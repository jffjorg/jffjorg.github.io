And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the plaintiff's default judgment packet and identified several deficiencies. The plaintiff claims that they were in negotiations with an affiliate of SK Telecom, a large Korean conglomerate, for a $10 million deal that was suddenly cancelled due to defamatory articles published by the defendant. However, the plaintiff failed to provide sufficient evidence to support this claim. Specifically, the plaintiff submitted a template agreement that does not establish pending negotiations with SK Telecom, and there is no evidence to support the contention that the deal was increased from $5 million to $10 million. Additionally, the plaintiff failed to provide evidence that SK Telecom specifically indicated that the defamatory articles were the reason for backing away from the deal. To proceed, the plaintiff must provide evidence that they were in negotiations with SK Group for $10 million and that SK Group saw the defamatory articles and specifically indicated that they were backing away from the deal because of them. The plaintiff must also set forth a summary of the case, including all applicable legal authority, to show that each element of defamation per se has been met.
