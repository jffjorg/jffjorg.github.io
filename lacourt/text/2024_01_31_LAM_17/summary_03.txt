Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The plaintiff, Noosha Shaheedy, seeks attorney fees and costs totaling $21,878.00 and $1,149.19, respectively, in this lawsuit against Ford Motor Company and Santa Monica Ford Lincoln. The court has reviewed the plaintiff's counsel's claims and finds that the hourly rates claimed by the attorneys are unreasonable. Therefore, the court reduces the hourly rates to a reasonable blended rate of $400 per hour. After calculating the reasonable hours worked by the attorneys, the court awards the plaintiff $7,520.00 in attorney fees. The court does not consider the request for costs as the plaintiff did not file a Verified Memorandum of Costs.
