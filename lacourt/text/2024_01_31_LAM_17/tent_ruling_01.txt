 Hearing
  Date:  January 31, 2024




 
Plaintiff’s motion to have her RFAs
deemed admitted is DENIED. The Court declines to award sanctions at this time.
 
            On
7/22/2020, Plaintiff Yi He (Plaintiff) filed suit against Bank of America,
National Association and Thomas Flores, alleging: 1) sex/gender harassment; (2)
sex/gender discrimination; (3) race/color discrimination; (4) unlawful
retaliation (FEHA); (5) failure to prevent; and (6) wrongful termination. 
 
            On
11/28/2023, Plaintiff moves to have her Requests for Admission (RFAs) deemed
admitted against Defendant Bank of America (Defendant or BOA.)
 
Discussion 
 
            On
6/19/2023, Plaintiff propounded RFAs on Defendant Bank of America . 
 
On 7/20/2023
Counsel for Defendant requested a two week extension to 8/4/2023, which was
granted. (Yun Decl. ¶¶ 7-8, Ex. 4.) On 8/3/2023 Counsel for Defendant requested
a further two week extension to 8/18/2023 while they continued their search for
documents. Again, Plaintiff granted the extension. (Yun Decl. ¶¶ 9-10, Ex. 5.)
After Counsel for Plaintiff provided further information related to the RFP3,
Counsel for Defendant requested a week extension on 8/17/2023 which moved
Defendant’s response date to 8/25/2023. (Yun Decl. ¶¶ 11-12, Ex. 6.) Plaintiff
further granted two more extensions of one week on 8/25/2023 and 8/31/2023
making Defendant’s response date 9/8/2023. (Yun Decl. ¶¶ 13-14, Ex. 7.)
 
On 9/8/2023,
Counsel for Defendant served objection only responses for Plaintiff’s RFP3 in
order to preserve their objections. However, Defendant did not furnish a
response nor an objection to Plaintiff’s RFA1 or FIG2 (FROG). (Yun Decl. ¶¶
15-16, Ex. 8.)
 
In
opposition, Defendant admits that it did not timely serve responses to the
subject RFAs. However, Defendant indicates that responses have since been
provided, and its failure to initially provide timely response was due to
counsel’s mistake following a “stressful and exhausting day” in which counsel’s
mother underwent major surgery and counsel was in the hospital all day. (Opp.,
2: 12-14.)
 
Given that
substantially code-compliant responses have been provided, the substance of
Plaintiff’s motion is moot, and the motion is denied. (CCP § 2033.280, subd.
(a).) “If the party manages to serve its responses before the hearing, the
court has no discretion but to deny the motion … Everything, in short, depends
on submitting responses prior to the hearing.” (Demyer v. Costa Mesa Mobile
Homes Estates (1995) 36 Cal. App. 4th 393, 395-396 (disapproved on other
grounds in Wilcox v. Birtwhistle (1999) 21 Cal. 4th 973.) 
 
The Court
also finds sanctions are not warranted under the circumstances. CCP section
2033.280, subdivision (c), provides in pertinent part: “It is mandatory that
the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with [Code of
Civil Procedure] Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose
failure to serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated this
motion.” 
 
However, the
Civil Discovery Act, also provides in pertinent part: 
 
To the extent
authorized by the chapter governing any particular discovery method ..., the
court, after notice ... and after opportunity for hearing, may impose the
following sanctions against anyone engaging in conduct that is a misuse of the
discovery process: [¶] (a) ... If a monetary sanction is authorized by any
provision of this title, the court shall impose that sanction unless it
finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification
or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.
 
(CCP
§2023.030, subd. (a), emphasis added.) 
 
Here, the
Court is persuaded that Defendant’s counsel’s failure to timely respond was an
oversight based on the circumstances of the day (i.e., having spent a long day
at the hospital with her mother). This is evidenced by the fact that
Defendant’s counsel thereafter communicated with Plaintiff’s counsel regarding
other discovery issues without this issue arising, and Plaintiff did not alert
Defendant to the oversight. As such, Defendant had no opportunity to address
the issue prior to the motion being filed.
 
Based on the
foregoing, Plaintiff’s motion to have her RFAs deemed admitted is denied. The
Court declines to award sanctions at this time. 
 
It is so ordered.
