```

Summary:

In this tentative ruling, Judge Jon R. Takasugi denies the defendants' motion for summary judgment, but grants their motion for summary adjudication as to the first through eighth causes of action. The defendants, Spectrum Hydroponics and Scott Murray, moved to dismiss the plaintiff's claims of discrimination, retaliation, and other Labor Code violations. The plaintiff, Casey Miller, alleged that he was discriminated against and retaliated against by the defendants while he was employed by Spectrum Hydroponics. The defendants argued that they did not regularly employ five or more employees, which is a requirement for coverage under the Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA). The court found that the defendants did not meet their burden of proof and that there is a disputed issue of material fact as to whether the defendants regularly employed five or more employees. The court granted summary adjudication as to the first through eighth causes of action, but denied summary judgment as to the remaining claims.
