   [1] In  opposition, Plaintiff argues that Defendants have not addressed causes of  action 3 or 9-15. However, by addressing Plaintiff’s claims for  disability discrimination, retaliation in violation of FEHA, and retaliation in  violation of CRFA, Defendants have necessarily addressed the failure to prevent  that conduct (i.e. the 3rd cause of action). Accordingly, the Court  rejects Plaintiff’s contention that the 3rd cause of action is  unaddressed by Defendants motion.
