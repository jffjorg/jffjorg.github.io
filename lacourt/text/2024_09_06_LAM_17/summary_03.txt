And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the defendants' demurrer to the plaintiff's second and third causes of action (medical battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress) is overruled. The judge has also denied the defendants' motion to strike, finding that the plaintiff has alleged sufficient facts to support his claims.

The judge's ruling is based on the plaintiff's allegations that the defendants performed surgery on the wrong eye without proper markings or numbing drops, and that the defendants ignored the plaintiff's attempts to alert them to the error. The judge believes that these allegations could show that the defendants exceeded the scope of the plaintiff's consent and intended to inflict emotional distress.

The judge has accepted the allegations as true and has found that the plaintiff has alleged sufficient facts to state a claim for medical battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress. The judge has also denied the defendants' motion to strike, finding that the plaintiff's claim is not limited to medical negligence and that the defendants' conduct could be considered extreme and outrageous.
