And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to tax costs filed by Defendant Laurie Ann Pastel. The motion seeks to recover $31,034.09 in costs, including filing and motion fees, jury fees, deposition costs, court reporter fees, and other expenses. The plaintiff objects to some of these costs, arguing that they were not necessary or reasonably incurred. The judge concludes that the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate that the costs were not actually incurred or were unreasonable in amount. The judge also rejects the plaintiff's argument that half of the costs should be struck, as there is no authority to support this position. The motion to tax costs is therefore denied.
