And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling on a motion to compel the deposition of plaintiff Sophie Morris and to impose sanctions for discovery abuse. The defendant's Alice and Nathan Hirsch move to compel Sophie Morris to attend a deposition on February 6, 2024, or on another mutually convenient date and time. The defendants argue that Sophie Morris failed to serve an objection to the deposition notice and failed to appear for the deposition, despite being contacted by the defendants' counsel. The court finds that Sophie Morris failed to comply with the deposition notice and grants the motion. The court orders Sophie Morris to attend her deposition at Veritext Court Reporting within 10 days of this order. Additionally, the court imposes sanctions in the amount of $1,063.00 against Sophie Morris and payable within 30 days.
