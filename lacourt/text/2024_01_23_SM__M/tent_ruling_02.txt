to Tax Costs

Legal
Standard
 
In general, the “prevailing party” is entitled as a matter of right to
recover costs for suit in any action or proceeding. (CCP § 1032(b); Santisas v. Goodin (1998) 17
Cal.4th 599, 606.) “Prevailing party” includes the party with a net
monetary recovery, a defendant in whose favor a dismissal is entered, a
defendant where neither plaintiff nor defendant obtains any relief, and a
defendant as against those plaintiffs who do not recover any relief against
that defendant. (CCP § 1032 (a)(4).)
 
            “Allowable costs shall be reasonably
necessary to the conduct of the litigation rather than merely convenient or beneficial
to its preparation.” (CCP § 1033.5(c)(2).) “If the items appearing in a cost
bill appear to be proper charges, the burden is on the party seeking to tax
costs to show that they were not reasonable or necessary.” (Ladas v. California State Auto. Assn. (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 761, 774.) On
the other hand, if the items are properly objected to, they are put in issue
and the burden of proof is on the party claiming them as costs. (Ibid.)
 
            Unless objection is made to the
entire cost memorandum, the motion to strike or tax costs must refer to each
item objected to by the same number and appear in the same order as the
corresponding cost item claimed on the memorandum of costs and state why each
item is objectionable. (CRC rule 3.1700(b)(2).) Any grounds not stated are
waived. (Boyd v. Oscar Fisher Co. (1989) 210 Cal. App. 3d 368, 383.)
 
 
Analysis
 
            On December 14, 2021, Defendant Laurie Ann Pastel filed a
memorandum of costs seeking $31,034.09 as follows:
            
1.     Filing
and motion fees -                                              $2,149.75
2.     Jury
fees -                                                                   $150.00
4.     Deposition
costs -                                           
           $2,116.34
11. Court
reporter fees as established by statute -       $24,738.00
12. Models,
enlargements, and photocopies of exhibits - $1,880.00
 
Item 1
 
Plaintiff objects to every entry under item one, except
for the filing fees associated with the answer ($435.00) and the motions
($120.00). Plaintiff questions the remaining filing fees, such as those listed
as $114.45. Plaintiff contends that such fees should be less than $20.00 each. Generally,
filing and motion fees are allowable as costs. (CCP  1033.5(a)(1).) Allowable costs include fees for
the electronic filing of documents through an electronic filing service
provider, if a court orders electronic filing. (CCP § 1033.5(a)(14).) The
burden is on the party challenging costs to show they were not reasonable or
necessary. Plaintiff fails to demonstrate that the costs were not actually
incurred, or were unreasonable in amount. In opposition, Defendant supplies
invoices from a court approved electronic service provider. Plaintiff only
speculates that each of item of costs should be less, but provides no evidence
or authority on what the costs should be. Absent further argument or evidence
from Plaintiff, the Court will not tax these costs.
 
Other
costs
 
Plaintiff argues that the Court should strike half of all
the other costs. Plaintiff reasons that the costs were incurred on behalf of
two Defendants, and one was dismissed prior to the verdict, and therefore half
of the cost was not necessary or reasonably incurred. Plaintiff posits no
authority which would justify the arbitrary cutting of costs incurred simply
because one defendant was dismissed prior to verdict. Therefore, the Court will
not strike these costs.
 
Accordingly, the motion is DENIED.
