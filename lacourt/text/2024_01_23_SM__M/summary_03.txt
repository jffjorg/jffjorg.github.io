And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is denying the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment on its sole cause of action for unlawful detainer, as the plaintiff has already recovered the same damages in a separate breach of contract action. The judge is granting the plaintiff's alternative motion for summary adjudication on the issue of possession, as the plaintiff has demonstrated entitlement to possession of the premises. The judge finds that the plaintiff has presented sufficient evidence to show that the defendant failed to pay rent beginning April 2020 and is in default under the lease, and that the plaintiff served a valid Three-Day Notice requiring the defendant to pay rent. The judge also finds that the defendant has failed to present any evidence to dispute the amount of rent owed or to contest the service of the notice.
