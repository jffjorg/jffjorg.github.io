And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, Ralphs Grocery Company, moves for summary judgment on the grounds that there is no triable issue of material fact regarding the plaintiff's claims for negligence, premises liability, and negligent hiring, training, supervision, and retention. The court grants the motion, finding that the defendant has met its burden to show that it had no duty to protect against criminal acts by third parties and that any alleged breach was not the proximate cause of the plaintiff's injuries.

The court finds that the defendant's failure to take reasonable steps to secure its property and prevent the attack does not establish a triable issue of material fact. Additionally, the plaintiff's failure to oppose the motion or establish a triable issue of material fact results in the grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendant.

The court orders the defendant to file a proposed judgment within 10 days and to provide notice of this ruling and file a proof of service of such.
