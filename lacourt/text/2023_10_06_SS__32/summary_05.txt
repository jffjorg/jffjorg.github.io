And here is the summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling concerns a motion filed by attorneys Adina Ostoia and Kate Jamsheed to be relieved as counsel for plaintiff Lon Derek Carter. The motion is filed due to a breakdown in attorney-client communication, which has prevented the client from signing a substitution of attorney. The court finds this a valid reason for withdrawal under the Rules of Professional Conduct. However, the court denies the motion, as permitting counsel to withdraw at this late stage would likely result in prejudice to the rights of the plaintiff. The court orders counsel to give notice of the order and file a proof of service.
