Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding four motions to compel further responses filed by the Plaintiff, Rima Grigoryan, against the Defendant, Ralphs Grocery Company. The motions seek to compel verified responses to requests for production of documents, special interrogatories, and requests for admissions. The Judge grants the Plaintiff's motion to compel production of the surveillance video agreed upon by the Defendant and a verified response to Request for Production of Documents, Set One, Number 3. The video and response shall be served on the Plaintiff within 15 days. The Judge also admonishes the Plaintiff to properly present their motions going forward, rather than delaying a deposition and failing to present argument or legal authorities for the actual legal issue they are seeking the Court to address.
