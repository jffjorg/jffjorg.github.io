And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is regarding a motion to compel compliance with a deposition subpoena served on Med Funding, a non-party to the action. The subpoena requires Med Funding to produce documents and information related to Plaintiff Walter Andrade's medical treatment and liens held by Med Funding. Med Funding objected to the subpoena, citing ambiguity, relevance, and trade secrets. The Judge finds that the topics relating to Plaintiff and the particular liens held relating to Plaintiff are discoverable under the reasoning of Moore v. Mercer. However, the Judge concludes that evidence of what Med Funding negotiates in other cases is not discoverable under the Defendants' theory that it is relevant to the reasonable value of Calabasas Surgery Center's services to Plaintiff. The Judge also finds that Med Funding has not met its burden to establish the privilege of trade secrets first. The motion is granted in part and denied in part.
