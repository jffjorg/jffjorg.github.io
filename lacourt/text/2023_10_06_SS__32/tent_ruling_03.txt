MOTIONS


Motion to Compel Responses to Request for Production and
  Monetary Sanctions 




MOVING PARTY


Defendant LA County Metropolitan Transportation Authority 




OPPOSING PARTY


Arturo Bermudez



 
MOTION
 
Defendant Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority
(Defendant), moves to compel responses to Requests for Production of Documents.
Defendant asserts that on November 8, 2022, it served Requests for Production
of Documents on Plaintiff Arturo Robles Bermudez’s then-counsel via email and
U.S. mail. (Ortega Decl. ¶ 3.)  Defendant
granted several discovery extensions until April 12, 2023. (Id. ¶ 13.) On May
15, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel moved to be relieved; the Court granted the
motion. (Min. Order, May 15, 2023.) Plaintiff has been a self-represented
litigant since then.
 
            On August 17, 2023, Defendant mailed
a letter to Plaintiff explaining that it intended to move compel the production
of responses and would seek monetary sanctions. Defendant asserts it received
no response. (Id. ¶ 19, 20, Exh. 13.) On August 23, 2023, Defendant mailed a
second letter explaining the same information in more detail but received no
response. (Id. ¶ 21, Exh. 14.) 
 
ANALYSIS
 
LEGAL STANDARD
 
Under Code of Civil Procedure
Section 2031.300, if a party fails to serve a timely response to a demand for
inspection, the party making the demand may move for an order compelling
response to the demand. (CCP § 2031.300 subd. (b).)  The party who fails to
serve a timely response to a demand for inspection waives any objection to the
demand unless the court finds that the party has subsequently served a response
that is in substantial compliance or party’s failure was the result of mistake,
inadvertence, or excusable neglect. (CCP § 2031.300
(a)(1)-(2).)
 
Courts shall impose a monetary
sanction against any party who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to
compel a response to a demand for inspection unless the party acted with
substantial justification or other circumstances make the imposition of the
sanction unjust. CCP § 2031.300. Reasonable expenses include attorney fees, filing
fees, referee fees and other costs incurred. (CCP §2023.030, subd. (a).)
Monetary sanctions are limited to the “reasonable expenses that a party
incurred as a result of the discovery abuse. (§2023.030(a).) Trial courts have
discretion “to reduce the amount of fees and costs requested as a discovery
sanction in order to reach a reasonable award.” (Cornerstone Realty, Advisors,
LLC v. Summit Healthcare Reit, Inc. (2020) 56 Cal.App.5th 771 (791).) 
 
DISCUSSION
 
Defendant represents it has not received responses to the Requests for
Production of Documents. The last deadline to respond was April 12, 2023.
Defendant’s attempts to contact Plaintiff have been unsuccessful and Plaintiff
has neither served responses nor an opposition to this motion. 
 
            Defendant requests monetary
sanctions for $1,150.00 representing an hourly rate of $230, accounting for
three hours to draft the moving papers, two hours to read the opposition and
draft the reply, and one hour to attend the hearing. The Court finds the amount
of sanctions requested to be excessive, particularly given the nature of the
motion and the lack of an opposition. The grants monetary sanctions in the
amount of $460 (2 hours at $230).
 
CONCLUSION AND
ORDER
 
Therefore, the Court grants Defendant’s unopposed Motion to
Compel Responses to Request for Production under Code of Civil Procedure § 2031.300. Plaintiff shall serve verified responses,
without objections, within 30 days.
 
Further, the Court orders Plaintiff to pay monetary
sanctions in the amount of $460.00 to Defendant, by and through counsel for Defendant,
within 30 days of notice of the Court’s orders. 
 
Defendant is ordered to provide notice of the Court’s
orders and file a proof of service of such.
