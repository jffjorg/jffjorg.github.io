And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the defendant's unopposed motion to compel discovery responses from the plaintiff. The defendant served the plaintiff with a request for production of documents (RPDs) and a supplemental interrogatory, set one, but the plaintiff has not responded. The judge finds that the plaintiff was properly served with discovery and failed to respond, and therefore grants the motion. The judge also orders the plaintiff to serve verified responses to the discovery requests within 20 days.

The judge denies the defendant's request for monetary sanctions of $1,050, as the defense counsel's declaration failed to provide how the amount was calculated.

The parties are encouraged to meet and confer after reading the tentative ruling to see if they can reach an agreement. If a party intends to submit on the tentative ruling, they must send an email to the court with the subject line "SUBMIT" followed by the case number. Unless all parties submit by email, the parties should arrange to appear remotely or in person for oral argument.
