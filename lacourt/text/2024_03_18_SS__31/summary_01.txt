This is a tentative ruling by a judge in a case involving a request for default judgment by plaintiff Ivan Rene Moore against defendant Jaari Zvi. The case arises from an automobile collision and alleges negligence, battery, and intentional infliction of emotional distress by the defendant. The plaintiff seeks damages for property damage, rental car costs, medical specials, and general damages for pain and suffering. The defendant has been defaulting, and the plaintiff has filed multiple requests for default judgment. The court has reviewed the plaintiff's declaration and finds that it lacks sufficient evidence to support the plaintiff's claims. The court notes that the plaintiff has not provided any documentation of his special damages, and that his claims for personal injuries waive his right to privacy regarding his conditions. The court awards the plaintiff general damages for pain and suffering in the amount of $5,000 and punitive damages in the amount of $5,000, and orders the plaintiff to file a proposed judgment on judicial council form JUD-100 within 10 days.
