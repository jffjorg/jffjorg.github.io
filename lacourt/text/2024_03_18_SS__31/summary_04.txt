And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses the demurrer to complaint filed by Hertz Corporation, which was filed after default was entered against the company on February 9, 2024. The judge rules that Hertz has no right to bring its demurrer at this point in time and therefore overrules it without prejudice. The judge orders Hertz to give notice of the ruling and encourages the parties to meet and confer to reach an agreement. If a party intends to submit to the ruling, they must send an email to the court with the required information. If the parties do not submit or appear at the hearing, the court may take the motion off calendar or adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the court.
