And here is the English-text summary:

The Tentative Ruling denies the Plaintiff's motion to compel State Farm to produce business records in connection with a deposition subpoena. The Plaintiff filed the motion on February 20, 2024, which is untimely as it exceeds the 60-day deadline for filing and serving a motion to compel compliance with a deposition subpoena. The Court held that the 60-day deadline is mandatory and that failure to move for further answers within the statutory time forecloses further relief. The Plaintiff's misstatement of a previous case in support of the motion's timeliness is not well-taken. The Defendant opposes the motion and argues that the Plaintiff has failed to give proper notice as to which subpoena he seeks to enforce. The Court orders the moving party to give notice and encourages the parties to meet and confer to reach an agreement.
