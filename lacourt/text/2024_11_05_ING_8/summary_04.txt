Summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by Defendant Carelon Behavioral Health of California, Inc. to the Third Amended Complaint filed by Plaintiff Karin Friedman. The demurrer is based on the argument that Plaintiff's third cause of action for Negligent Selection of an Independent Contractor fails to state sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action.

The judge finds that the parties have met and conferred in good faith prior to filing the demurrer, and the meet and confer requirements have been met. The judge also notes that although Plaintiff's new allegations in the Third Amended Complaint technically address the defects noted in the previous demurrer, these allegations are pleaded in a conclusory fashion.

The judge overrules the demurrer and orders Plaintiff to give notice. The judge also cautions Plaintiff that if no facts are developed during the discovery phase, Plaintiff will be expected to dismiss the negligent selection cause of action.
