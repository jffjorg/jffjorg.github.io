I. BACKGROUND¿¿ 
¿¿ 
A.    Factual¿¿ 
 
On March 21, 2023, Plaintiff, Carlitta Smith
(“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Defendants, Robin Lynn Thompson, Terry
Holt as Trustee of the Holt Living Trust dated September 6, 2002, Sandra Hold
as Trustee of the Holt Living Trust dated September 6, 2002, and DOES 1 through
25. The complaint alleges causes of action for: (1) Negligence; (2) Common Law
Strict Liability; and (3) Strict Liability (Dog Bite Statute).  
 
Defendant, Robin Lynn Thompson (“Thompson”) notes that
on April 22, 2021, she received a Letter of Representation from Plaintiff’s
attorney. On April 27, 2021, Thompson notes that a claims adjuster, Jennifer
Wilmoth, spoke with Plaintiff’s attorney, confirming the facts of the incident.
On November 18, 2023, Thompson notes that Plaintiff served a copy of the
summons and complaint to her PO box that she never checks on and did not find
the copy of the summons and complaint until the middle of March 2024. 
 
On February 9, 2024, this Court entered default
against Defendant Thompson. 
 
On June 11, 2024, counsel for Thompson filed a Motion
to Strike punitive damages and served this on the Plaintiff’s attorney via
email. This Court denied the motion to strike as Defendant Thompson was
effectively not a part of the case as she had defaulted. Defendant Thompson next
filed a Motion to Set Aside Default on July 30, 2024. The Motion was granted on
October 8, 2024. On that same date, this Court also noted the subsequent
hearing set for a Motion for Attorney’s Fees which had been mentioned in each
of Plaintiff’s opposition briefs to the Motions to Set Aside/Vacate
Defaults.  
 
Plaintiff asserts that Defendants’ counsel reached
out, requesting he set aside the defaults. He noted, in the email
correspondence, that he would not set aside the defaults without compensation.
Plaintiff’s counsel, Kenechi R. Agu, filed a declaration (“Agu Decl.”), attesting
to his fees thus far in this action. 
 
B.   
Procedural 
 
On July 30, 2024, Defendant
Thompson filed a Motion to Set Aside Default. On August 12, 2024, Plaintiff
filed an opposition brief. 
 
On August 12, 2024, this
motion was originally heard. On the Court’s own motion, the hearing was
continued to September 11, 2024. Warren Jr. was ordered to file a declaration
on or before September 9, 2024. On October 8, 2024, this Court granted the
Defendant’s Motion to Set Aside Default, and set for hearing a Motion for Attorney’s
Fees to be considered as a condition of the Court having granted the application
under Section 473 to relieve Defendants form the default. 
 
On November 1, 2024, Agu
filed a Declaration in Support of Attorney’s Fees. Defendant Thompson has not filed
a reply brief, supplemental briefing, or supplemental declaration as to oppose
the granting of Attorney’s Fees. 
 
II. ANALYSIS¿ 
¿ 
A.   
 Legal Standard
¿ 
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b),
both discretionary and mandatory relief is available to parties from a
judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding.  Discretionary relief is
available under the statute as “the court may, upon any terms as may be just,
relieve a party or his or her legal representative from judgment, dismissal,
order, or other proceeding taken against him or her through his or her mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.  (Code of Civ. Proc.
§¿473(b).)  Alternatively, mandatory relief is available when “accompanied
by an attorney’s sworn affidavit attesting to his or her mistake, inadvertence,
surprise, or neglect.”  (Ibid.)  Under this statute, an application for
discretionary or mandatory relief must be made no more than six months after
entry of the judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding from which relief
is sought.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 473(b); English v. IKON Business
Solutions (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 130, 143.) “‘[W]hen relief under section
473¿is¿available, there is a strong¿public¿policy¿in¿favor¿of granting relief
and allowing the requesting party his or her day in court…[Citation.]” (Rappleyea
v. Campbell¿(1994) 8 Cal. 4th 975, 981-82.) 
 
Further, under Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision
(b), “[t]he court shall, whenever relief is granted based on an attorney’s
affidavit of fault, direct the attorney to pay reasonable compensatory legal
fees and costs to opposing counsel or parties.” (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 473, subd. (b).)  
 
B.   
Discussion 
 
Here,
Plaintiff’s counsel has asserted that Plaintiff has incurred as reasonable
attorney’s fees and costs for this effort, in the amount of $7,695. (Agu Decl., ¶ 3.) Agu contends that his hourly rate is
$450. The Court finds that Agu’s hourly rate is reasonable. As to each of the
entries of time, the court rules on each as follows: 
 
1.    
02/01/24
– Drafted Request for Entry of Default – 0.4 hours 
a.      Reasonable
2.    
02/01/24
– Drafted CMC Statement – 1.1 hours
a.      Reasonable
3.    
06/27/24
– Opposition to Motion to Strike – 0.6 hours
a.      Reasonable. 
4.    
08/05/24
– Reviewed Defendant’s Motion to Vacate Package – 2.6 hours. 
a.      Unreasonable. This amount is shortened to 1 hour. 
5.    
08/07/24
– Drafted Opposition Documents to Motion to Vacate, including research time –
6.4 hours. 
a.      Unreasonable. Opposition is a general opposition to a Motion to
Set Aside Entry of Default attesting to attorney’s mistake, inadvertence,
surprise, or excusable neglect. This is not a complex issue presented to allot
for such an amount of time. This amount is being shortened to 2.5 hours. 
6.    
09/09/24
– Reviewed Defendant’s Attorney Declaration – 0.4 hours
a.      Reasonable
7.    
09/09/24
– Drafted Amended Opposition Documents to Motion to Vacate, including research
time – 1.1 hours
a.      Reasonable.
8.    
09/09/24
– Preparation for and attendance at motion to Set Aside Hearing – 2 hours. 
a.      Unreasonable. A motion for default judgment does not typically
take even an hour of the court’s hearing time. This amount is shortened to 1
hour. Moreover, the hearing was continued. 
9.    
10/05/24
– Review of Defendant’s Supplemental Declaration in Support of her Motion to
Set Aside – 0.5 hours. 
a.      Reasonable. 
10. 
10/08/24
– Preparation for and attendance at motion to Set Aside Hearing – 1.5 Hours 
a.      Excessive, counsel was certainly prepared for this continued
motion, and as noted above, motions to set aside do not typically even take an
hour at hearing. This amount is shortened to 0.5 hours. 
11.  11/01/24 - Preparation of Declaration in Support of Attorneys
Fees – 0.5 hours. 
a.      Reasonable. Although the substance of the Declaration was
already provided in the two iterations of oppositions, a declaration needed to
be drafted and filed for the hearing.
As such, this Court
GRANTS Plaintiff’s request for Attorney’s Fees pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 473, subdivision (b), but the lesser amount of $4,545. 
 
III. CONCLUSION
            Based
on the foregoing, the court GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion for attorney’s fees in
the amount of $4,545.  
            Plaintiff
is ordered to provide notice.
