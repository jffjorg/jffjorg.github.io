And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the plaintiff's motion to vacate the dismissal of the action and reinstate the case to the civil active list. The plaintiff, Sherif Makar, had filed a complaint against the defendant, Zachary Keller, and DOES 1 through 50, alleging motor vehicle negligence and general negligence. The plaintiff's counsel accidentally marked the box to dismiss the entire action, and the court had previously granted the request for dismissal. The plaintiff has now moved to vacate the dismissal and reinstate the case, citing Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b), which allows for relief from a judgment or dismissal due to mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect. The judge has granted the motion, finding that the plaintiff's application for relief complies with the requirements of the statute and that the dismissal was made less than six months after entry. The case is reinstated to the civil active list, and the plaintiff is ordered to provide notice to the defendant.
