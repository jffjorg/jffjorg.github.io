And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has tentatively denied the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment. The plaintiff, Homebridge Management, Inc., filed an unlawful detainer complaint against the defendants, Angela L. Cooper and Jabril Spencer, alleging that it acquired ownership of the subject property through a non-judicial foreclosure sale and that the defendants failed to deliver possession of the property. The plaintiff served a three-day notice to quit on the defendants, but the defendants failed to respond.

The court finds that there is a triable issue of fact as to whether the foreclosure sale was done in compliance with Civil Code section 2924. The court also finds that Defendant Spencer has raised issues as to whether he has standing to challenge the foreclosure sale, whether the notice of sale was properly given, and whether the description of the place of the sale is sufficient.

The court will allow oral argument on these issues and will not grant summary judgment at this time.
