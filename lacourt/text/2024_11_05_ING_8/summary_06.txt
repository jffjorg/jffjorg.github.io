And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in favor of the defendant's motion to compel arbitration. The defendant argues that the plaintiff signed an arbitration agreement, and the court agrees that the agreement is valid and enforceable. The court finds that the agreement is procedurally unconscionable due to the lack of a Spanish translation, but this is not sufficient to invalidate the agreement. The court also rejects the plaintiff's arguments that the agreement is substantively unconscionable due to a PAGA waiver, unilateral modification, and limited discovery. The court concludes that the arbitration agreement meets the requirements of Armendariz and grants the defendant's motion to compel arbitration.
