 Case Number:  LAM17K02862    Hearing Date:   April 16, 2024    Dept:  26   State Farm Mutual Automobile v. David Ayon, et  al.MOTION TO VACATE DISMISSAL AND ENFORCE  SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT AND ENTER JUDGMENT (CCP §§ 664.6 and 1032)  ANALYSIS:   Plaintiff State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company  (“Plaintiff”) filed the instant action for automobile subrogation against  Defendants David Ayon (“Ayon”) and Oscar Uriarte (“Uriarte”) (collectively,  “Defendants”) on March 6, 2017. On August 31, 2018, Plaintiff filed a copy of  its settlement agreement with Ayon with a request for dismissal and retention  of jurisdiction under Code of Civil Procedure Section 664.6. The Court granted  the request for dismissal with retention of jurisdiction on August 31, 2018.  (Stip and Order for Settlement, 08/31/18.)   Plaintiff filed the instant Motion to Vacate Dismissal,  Enforce Settlement Agreement, and Enter Judgment on January 30, 2024. No  opposition has been filed to date.    Discussion   The Motion to Enforce Settlement is brought under Code of Civil  Procedure, section 664.6, which states in relevant part:   If parties to pending litigation  stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties outside the presence of the court  or orally before the court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the  court, upon motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement.  If requested by the parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties  to enforce the settlement until performance in full of the terms of the  settlement.   (Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6, subd.  (a).) Prior to January 1, 2021, “parties” under section 664.6 meant the  litigants themselves, not their attorneys.   (Levy v. Superior Court (1995) 10 Cal.4th 578, 586.) The current  statute provides that “parties” includes “an attorney who represents the party”  and an insurer’s agent. (Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6, subd. (b).) The settlement  must include the signatures of the parties seeking to enforce the agreement,  and against whom enforcement is sought. (J.B.B. Investment Partners, Ltd. v.  Fair (2014) 232 Cal.App.4th 974, 985.) The settlement agreement here complies with the statutory  requirements set forth above because it was signed by both parties and  Plaintiff’s counsel. (Mahfouz Decl. ¶ 6, Ex. A.)    The request for retention of  jurisdiction must also be made in writing, by the parties, before the action is  dismissed for the Court’s retention of jurisdiction to conform to the statutory  language. (Wackeen v. Malis (2002) 97 Cal.App.4th 429, 433 [“If, after a  suit has been dismissed, a party brings a section 664.6 motion for a judgment  on a settlement agreement but cannot present to the court a request for  retention of jurisdiction that meets all of these requirements, then  enforcement of the agreement must be left to a separate lawsuit.”].) The  parties’ request for retention of jurisdiction complies with these requirements  because it was made in writing to the Court before the action was dismissed. (Mahfouz  Decl. ¶ 6, Ex. A.) Therefore, the Court finds that the parties’ settlement  agreement is enforceable, and the request for the Court’s retention of  jurisdiction is proper, under Code of  Civil Procedure Section 664.6.   The settlement agreement provides  that Ayon would pay Plaintiff $9,260.49 by way of a $4,260.49 payment from  insurance, followed by monthly payments starting on August 15, 2018. (Mahfouz  Decl. ¶ 6, Ex. A.) The settlement agreement also provides that if Ayon defaults,  judgment in the amount of $14,977.16, plus costs, prejudgment interest, and  reasonable attorney’s fees, less monies paid, may be entered in Plaintiff’s  favor. (Id. at Ex. A, ¶ 6, 8.) Ayon made total payments in the amount of  $2,400.00 and thereafter defaulted. (Id. at ¶ 9.) Therefore, Plaintiff  seeks an order entering judgment against Ayon based on the settlement amount of  $14,997.16 plus costs of $507.95, interest of $820.82, attorney’s fees of  $839.31, less payments of $6,660.49 ($4,260.49 + $2,400.00) for a total of $10,504.75.  (Id. at ¶8.) However, the settlement agreement provides for judgment in  the amount of $14,977.16. As such, the Court will impose judgment against Ayon  based on the settlement amount of $14,977.16 plus costs of $507.95, interest of  $820.82, attorney’s fees of $839.31, less payments of $6,660.49 ($4,260.49 +  $2,400.00) for a total of $10,484.75.   Conclusion   Plaintiff State Farm Mutual Insurance Company’s Motion to  Vacate Dismissal, Enforce Settlement Agreement, and Enter Judgment is GRANTED  IN THE AMOUNT OF $10,484.75.    Moving party to give notice.
