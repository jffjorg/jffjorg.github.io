Discussion
 
Where a
party willfully disobeys a discovery order, courts have discretion to impose
terminating, issue, evidence or monetary sanctions. (Code Civ. Proc., §§
2023.010, subds. (d), (g); R.S. Creative, Inc. v. Creative Cotton, Ltd.
(1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 486, 495.) The court should look to the totality of the
circumstances in determining whether terminating sanctions are appropriate. (Lang
v. Hochman (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 1225, 1246.) Ultimate discovery sanctions
are justified where there is a willful discovery order violation, a history of
abuse, and evidence showing that less severe sanctions would not produce
compliance with discovery rules. (Van Sickle v. Gilbert (2011) 196
Cal.App.4th 1495, 1516.) “[A] penalty as severe as dismissal or default is not
authorized where noncompliance with discovery is caused by an inability to
comply rather than willfulness or bad faith.” (Brown v. Sup. Ct. (1986)
180 Cal.App.3d 701, 707.) 
 
“The
court may impose a terminating sanction by one of the following orders: (1) An
order striking out the pleadings or parts of the pleadings of any party
engaging in the misuse of the discovery process. (2) An order staying further
proceedings by that party until an order for discovery is obeyed. (3) An order
dismissing the action, or any part of the action, of that party. (4) An order
rendering a judgment by default against that party.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
2023.030, subd. (d).)
 
The
Court granted Plaintiff’s (1) Motion to Compel Responses to Request for
Production of Documents and Request for Sanctions; and (2) Motion to Compel
Responses to Special Interrogatories and Request for Sanctions. (Min. Order,
11/01/23; Motion, Brown Decl., Ex. 1.) The Court ordered Defendant to serve code-complaint
and objection-free responses and to pay sanctions in the amount of $1,645.50 within
20 days. (Id.) Notice of the order was served on Defendant on November
8, 2023. (Id.) Defendant did not serve any responses to the subject
discovery until March 20, 2024. Defendant’s responses are not compliant with
Code of Civil Procedure Sections 2030.220 and 2031.210, subdivision (a).
Furthermore, Defendant did not provide an explanation for why these responses
were untimely nor why he failed to comply with the November 1, 2023 order
including paying the ordered monetary sanctions. However, Defendant initially
appeared in this matter as a pro per Defendant and recently obtained legal assistance, indicating
noncompliance with discovery may have been caused by an inability to comply
rather than willfulness or bad faith. Moreover, the is no present history of
noncompliance apart from the initial discovery order. To the extent that
Defendant has provided non-compliant discovery responses as to Special
Interrogatories Nos. 13, 16-18, and Request for Production of Documents Nos. 5,
9-11. Additionally, there is no indication that Defendant is vexatious
litigant, a motion to compel further responses appears to be a more appropriate
avenue than terminating sanctions. Although the Court finds that monetary
sanctions are more appropriate in this situation to produce or ensure future
compliance, Defendant’s circumstance of appearing in pro per before finally retaining
counsel makes imposition of additional monetary sanctions unjust. 
 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiff Creditors Adjustment Bureau, Inc.’s Motion for
Terminating Sanctions is DENIED.
 
Moving party to give notice.
