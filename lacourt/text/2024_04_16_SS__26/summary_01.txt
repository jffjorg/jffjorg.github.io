Here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has granted the motion to declare plaintiff Young Chow Dai a vexatious litigant. The court found that plaintiff has repeatedly relitigated the same issues, filed unmeritorious motions, and conducted unnecessary discovery. The court also found that plaintiff has filed successive motions to vacate judgment, which were denied. The court determined that plaintiff has not shown a reasonable probability of prevailing in the litigation. As a result, the court ordered plaintiff to furnish bond or security before filing any new litigation. Additionally, the court found that a pre-filing order was warranted in this case.
