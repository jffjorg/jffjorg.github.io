Here is the English-text summary:

The judge issues a tentative ruling denying the plaintiff's motion for terminating sanctions against the defendant. The plaintiff, Creditors Adjustment Bureau, Inc., filed a complaint against the defendant, Ronnie M. Perez, for breach of contract, open book account, account stated, and reasonable value. The plaintiff filed a motion to compel responses to demand for production of documents and special interrogatories, which the court granted. The defendant failed to comply with the court's order and did not serve compliant responses until March 20, 2024. The court finds that the defendant's noncompliance was not caused by willfulness or bad faith, but rather an inability to comply. Therefore, the court denies the plaintiff's motion for terminating sanctions and instead imposes monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,645.50. The court also notes that the defendant's circumstances, having appeared pro per before retaining counsel, make additional monetary sanctions unjust.
