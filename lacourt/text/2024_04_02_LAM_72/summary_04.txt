And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling is about a lawsuit filed by Kevin Laughlin against Liberty Mutual Insurance Company, Ohio Casualty Insurance Company, and Ohio Security Insurance Company. The lawsuit is related to an insurance dispute involving a commercial general liability insurance policy issued to Sapphire Bakery Company, LLC. The policy did not cover Laughlin's business, Eagle Mist Corporation, as an additional insured, but Laughlin believed that he was covered and received defense and indemnification from the defendants.

The defendants demurred to the complaint, arguing that the claims were not valid. The court agreed with the defendants on the first and second causes of action, dismissing them without leave to amend. The court also dismissed the third cause of action, malicious prosecution, without leave to amend, because Laughlin did not achieve a favorable termination of the entire action.

However, the court gave Laughlin leave to amend the complaint to state a claim for unfair competition, as the conduct of the defendants may be considered "unlawful, unfair or fraudulent." The court also granted leave to amend to add claims for constructive trust, negligent misrepresentation, and/or abuse of process. The court ordered Laughlin to amend the complaint within 20 days.
