 Hearing Date:  January 30, 2024
 Calendar Number:  1



 
 
 
Plaintiff Edmond Durham (“Plaintiff”) moves for
reconsideration of the Court’s January 30, 2024 order enforcing Plaintiff’s
settlement agreement with Defendants Jose P. Laguna and the Jose P. Laguna
Trust (collectively, “Defendants”).
 
The Court DENIES the motion for reconsideration.
 
Background
 
Plaintiff Edmond Durham (“Durham”) filed this action on May
16, 2022 against Defendants, alleging breach of contract related to a property
that Plaintiff rented from Defendants.
 
The parties entered a settlement of the matter outside of
the presence of the court. (Swartz Decl. ¶¶ 3-6; Exh. A.) The settlement
agreement provides that Plaintiff would vacate the property by June 30, 2023
and would notify Defendants’ attorney once Plaintiff had vacated. (Swartz
Decl., Exh. A ¶¶ 1-3.) The settlement also provides that the prevailing party
in any dispute to enforce the settlement will be entitled to reasonable
attorney’s fees and costs. (Swartz Decl., Exh. A ¶ 18.)
 
As of November 22, 2023, Plaintiff had not moved out and had
not paid any rent since April 2023. Defendant’s attorney also has not been
notified that Plaintiff has vacated the property.
 
On January 30, 2024, the Court granted Defendants’ unopposed
motion to enforce the settlement agreement and for attorney’s fees pursuant to
the agreement.
 
            Plaintiff
moved for reconsideration of the January 30, 2024 order on February 23, 2024.
Defendants filed an opposition. Plaintiff did not file a reply.
 
Legal Standard
 
Within ten days of service of an order, a party may move for
reconsideration based on new facts, circumstances, or law.  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1008, subd. (a); see also Mink v. Superior Court (1992) 2
Cal.App.4th 1338, 1342.)  The moving party shall state by affidavit what
application was made before, what order or decisions were made, and what new or
different facts or circumstances are claimed to be shown.  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1008, subd .(a).)  “[T]he party seeking reconsideration must
provide not only new evidence but also a satisfactory explanation for the
failure to produce that evidence at an earlier time.”  (Glade v. Glade
(1995) 38 Cal.App.4th 1441, 1457.)  The legislative intent was to restrict
motions for reconsideration to circumstances where a party offers the court
some fact or circumstance not previously considered and some valid reason for
not offering it earlier.  (Gilberd v. AC Transit (1995) 32
Cal.App.4th 1494, 1500.) 
 
“If those requirements have been met to the satisfaction of
the court but the court is not persuaded the earlier ruling was erroneous, the
proper course to grant reconsideration and to reaffirm the earlier ruling.” (Corns
v. Miller (1986) 181 Cal.App.3d 195, 202.)
 
“If a court at any time determines that there has been a
change of law that warrants it to reconsider a prior order it entered, it may
do so on its own motion and enter a different order.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
1008, subd. (c).)
 
Discussion
 
Plaintiff argues that the settlement agreement should be set
aside because he did not understand the consequences of the agreement at the
time of his signing and disagrees with the agreement. Plaintiff states that he
no longer has an attorney due to the fact that he does not agree with the
settlement.
 
This is not a valid basis for reconsideration. Insofar as
Plaintiff has an argument that he did not assent to the settlement agreement,
that argument could have been raised on the initial motion to enforce the
settlement. There are no new facts warranting reconsideration.
 
Plaintiff argues that he should be
permitted to obtain relief from judgment under Code of Civil Procedure, section
473, subd. (b). The Court does not find that Plaintiff has met the standard for
such relief and has not sufficiently shown mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or
excusable neglect.

 
The Court denies the motion for reconsideration.
