             Plaintiff Markus Pinon (“Plaintiff”) seeks to
compel defendant General Motors, LLC (“Defendant”) to produce a person most
qualified to testify in response to a January 11, 2024 notice of deposition.
 
            The Court
GRANTS the motion in part as follows. 
Within 30 days, Defendant shall produce a person most qualified to
testify as to Categories 1-4, 7 and 10. 
Except as so ordered, the Court denies the motion.  
 
            The Court
grants the motion to compel only as to categories 1-4, 7 and 10 for a number of
reasons.  First, Defendant agrees to
produce a witness on those topics.  (Defendant’s
Opp. at 1:22-2:3.)  Second, Plaintiff has
failed to file a separate statement as to the other topics to which Defendant
objects.  (Cal. Rule of Court
3.1345.)  Nor has Plaintiff provided a
category-by-category analysis of the other topics in any other way.  Third, in his reply brief Plaintiff disclaims
any argument as to Defendant’s objections. 
(Reply at 1:10-11 [“Thus, Plaintiff is making no arguments of
Defendant’s objections, but merely requiring an order compelling Defendant’s
deposition.”].)
 
            Accordingly,
the Court grants this motion, but only as to categories 1-4, 7 and 10 of the
deposition notice.
