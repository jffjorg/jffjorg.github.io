And here is the English text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the Plaintiff's motion for reconsideration of the Court's January 30, 2024 order enforcing the settlement agreement. The Plaintiff, Edmond Durham, argues that the settlement agreement should be set aside because he did not understand the consequences of the agreement at the time of signing and disagrees with the agreement. However, the Court finds that this is not a valid basis for reconsideration, as the Plaintiff could have raised this argument on the initial motion to enforce the settlement. The Court also denies the Plaintiff's request for relief from judgment under Code of Civil Procedure, section 473, as the Plaintiff has not met the standard for such relief and has not sufficiently shown mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.
