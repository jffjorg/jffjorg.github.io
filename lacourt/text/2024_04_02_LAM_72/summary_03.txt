(St. Mary Medical Center v. Superior Court)
```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the Pustilnikovs' motions to compel the deposition of Rambod Hadidi and to show cause re: contempt against Hadidi. The judge also denies their motion for sanctions against the City or Hadidi. The Pustilnikovs had sought to compel Hadidi's deposition because they wanted to question him about his expert opinion in support of the City's opposition to their motion for determination of good faith settlement. The judge finds that the Pustilnikovs have not shown that Hadidi's work product privilege has been waived, and that the exception to the pre-disclosure bar on expert depositions is only available in limited circumstances, such as where an expert has submitted a declaration in support of a motion for summary judgment or an opposite the motion. The judge notes that the Pustilnikovs have not cited any case that supports a broader exception to the pre-disclosure bar, and that their claim that they need to depose Hadidi to discover new and different facts and then use those facts to move for reconsideration is a circular argument.
