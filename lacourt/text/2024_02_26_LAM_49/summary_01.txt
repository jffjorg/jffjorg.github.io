Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Counsel Farzad Seyfnia's motion to be relieved as counsel for Defendant LA Fine Motors, LLC. The motion is granted on the condition that Counsel submits an order indicating that the next hearing will be an OSC re: Striking of Answer on April 3, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. If LA Fine Motors does not have a new attorney of record by that date, its answer may be stricken. The judge notes that the case is pending in arbitration, and Counsel has adequately demonstrated "good cause" for withdrawal. The judge also notes that the matter was stayed to allow for arbitration, and that Counsel's motion is being heard by the court rather than the arbitrator.
