And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has ruled on the demurrer to the Complaint and the Motion to Strike. The court has sustained the demurrer to the First Cause of Action, which alleges breach of contract, breach of the implied warranty of habitability, and breach of quiet enjoyment. The court has given the plaintiffs 30 days to amend their complaint to plead the legal effect of their lease agreements and to separate the claims into three standalone causes of action.

The court has overruled the demurrer to the Fourth Cause of Action, which alleges private nuisance, finding that the plaintiffs have adequately alleged a substantial and unreasonable interference with their use and enjoyment of the property.

The court has also overruled the demurrer to the Sixth Cause of Action, which alleges unfair business practices, finding that the plaintiffs have adequately alleged injuries resulting from the defendants' failure to remedy or maintain the premises.

The court has granted the Motion to Strike, which sought to strike the plaintiffs' allegations pertaining to punitive damages, finding that the plaintiffs have failed to plead the required specific facts necessary to show the requisite malice, oppression, or fraud necessary to seek punitive damages. The court has given the plaintiffs 30 days to amend their complaint to plead adequate specific facts to demonstrate that the corporate defendants acted with malice, oppression, or fraud.
