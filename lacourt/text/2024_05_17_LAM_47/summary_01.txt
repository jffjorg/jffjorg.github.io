And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling on a motion for leave to file a First Amended Complaint in an action for conversion and breach of contract. The Court granted the motion, allowing Plaintiffs to file their First Amended Complaint within 5 days. The Court found that Plaintiffs had substantially complied with the requirements for amending a pleading. The motion was opposed by Defendants, who argued that Plaintiffs were tardy in bringing the motion and that the new allegations would substantially alter the posture of the case on the eve of trial. The Court rejected these arguments and granted the motion, finding good cause to permit Plaintiffs to file their First Amended Complaint.
