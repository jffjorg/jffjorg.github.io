And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to dismiss for forum non conveniens. The defendant had argued that the case should be dismissed or stayed because the case would be more conveniently heard in Delaware, where the parties' employment agreement was signed. The judge ruled that the defendant's motion was denied because the plaintiff's rights would be weakened by enforcement of the forum selection clause, which would require the case to be heard in Delaware. The judge also ruled that the public policy of California prohibits enforcement of the non-compete provision in the employment agreement.
