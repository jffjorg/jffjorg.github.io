Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in plain English:

The judge is considering four motions filed by the City of West Hollywood (Defendant) against Jameelah Budhan (Plaintiff). The motions are to deem admitted certain requests for admission, compel responses to form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and a demand for production. The Plaintiff has not responded to these discovery requests, despite being served on May 20, 2024. The Judge finds that the Plaintiff has failed to respond and grants the motions. The Judge also awards monetary sanctions against the Plaintiff in the amount of $1,000, which is reduced from the initial request of $1,250. The Judge orders the Plaintiff to serve verified responses without objections within 20 days and to pay the sanctions within 30 days.
