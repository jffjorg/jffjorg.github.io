Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion by FedEx Freight, Inc. to change the venue of the trial from Los Angeles County to Fresno County. The motion is based on the fact that defendants American Roadlines and Singh reside in Fresno County, and that FedEx is an Arkansas corporation with its principal place of business in Tennessee. The judge notes that the complaint alleges that the accident occurred in New Mexico, but that the parties have been litigating the matter in Los Angeles County for six months.

The plaintiff opposes the motion, arguing that the Los Angeles Superior Court is the proper court for the trial, and that moving the trial to Fresno County would be prejudicial to him. The plaintiff also argues that nearly all of the witnesses reside in Los Angeles County, including his treating doctors.

The judge grants the motion, finding that the Los Angeles Superior Court is not the proper court for the trial. The judge orders that the parties must stipulate to the proper court, or that the case be transferred to the proper court in a proper county designated by the defendant.
