BACKGROUND
 
This is a medical malpractice
wrongful death action based on care the decedent Claudia Lorena Mejia received
on April 29, 2020. Plaintiffs Manuel Lopez Guardian Ad Litem for Brianna Sky
Lopez, Individually and Successor-In-Interest to the Estate of Claudia Lorena
Mejia, and Manuel Lopez Guardian Ad Litem for Bella Rose Lopez, Individually
and Successor-In-Interest to the Estate of Claudia Lorena Mejia (collectively,
Plaintiffs), filed this action on June 3, 2021, against defendants Medcove
Urgent Care, Jason Torres, N.P. (erroneously sued as Jason Torres)
(collectively, Defendants), and Does 1 to 100, alleging the sole cause of
action for professional negligence (wrongful death).
 
On August 29, 2024, Defendants
moved for terminating sanctions and monetary sanctions. On October 4, 2024,
Plaintiffs opposed the motion. On October 10, 2024, Defendants replied.
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
The court is authorized, after notice and opportunity for
hearing, to impose the following sanctions against anyone engaging in conduct
that is a misuse of the discovery process: monetary sanctions, issue sanctions,
evidence sanctions, terminating sanctions, and contempt. (Code Civ. Proc., §¿2023.030,
subd. (a)-(e).) A terminating sanction may be imposed by an order striking out a
pleading of any party engaging in the misuse of the discovery process. (Id.,
§ 2023.030, subd. (d)(3).)  
 
“The discovery statutes evince an incremental approach to
discovery sanctions, starting with monetary sanctions and ending with the
ultimate sanction of termination.” (Doppes v. Bentley Motors, Inc.¿(2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 967,
992 (Doppes); see J.W. v. Watchtower Bible and Tract Society of New
York, Inc.¿(2018) 29 Cal.App.5th 1142, 1169.) If a lesser sanction fails to
curb misuse, a greater sanction is warranted. (Doppes, 174
Cal.App.4th at 992.) Discovery sanctions should be appropriate to the dereliction, and should not exceed what is required to protect the
interests of the party entitled to but denied discovery. (Ibid.) “But
where a violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence
shows that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the
discovery rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate
sanction.” (Ibid. [quoting Mileikowsky v. Tenet Healthsystem (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 262,
279-280 (Mileikowsky)]; Creed-21 v. City of Wildomar¿(2017) 18
Cal.App.5th 690, 702 [quoting same].)  
 
Code of
Civil Procedure, section 2023.010, subdivisions (d) and (f) provide that a
misuse of the discovery process includes, but is not limited to, “[f]ailing to
respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery” and “[m]aking an evasive response
to discovery.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010(d), (f).)         
            
DISCUSSION
 
            Defendants
previously served written discovery requests on Plaintiffs on March 21, 2024.
(Villebro Decl., ¶ 11, Ex. F.) Plaintiffs failed to timely respond, and
Defendants successfully moved to compel responses to those requests. The Court
ordered Plaintiffs to provide verified responses within 10 days and to pay
monetary sanctions in the total amount of $2,340.00. (Minute Order (8/6/24);
Minute Order (8/7/24).) Defendants contend that Plaintiffs still have not
provided responses or paid the sanctions per the Court’s orders on August 6,
2024, and August 7, 2024. Defendants seek terminating sanctions and monetary
sanctions in the amount of $1,050.00. Defendants contend terminating sanctions
are warranted because lesser sanctions would only permit Plaintiffs to continue
engaging in stalling tactics, which has thwarted Defendants’ efforts to prepare
for trial. Defendants contend Plaintiffs have had enough time to comply with
the Court’s orders and respond to discovery, but simply chose not to do so.
 
            In opposition, Plaintiffs contend
terminating sanctions are a drastic measure and are not appropriate here
because they have not willfully failed to comply. Plaintiffs concede they did
not provide timely responses per the Court’s orders, but indicate that they
have now provided verified responses. (Chisvin Decl., ¶¶ 2-3, Exs. A, B.) Plaintiffs
contend the delayed responses were not willful but were inadvertent and caused
by administrative delays, and that there is no history of evasive or incomplete
responses from Plaintiffs. (Chisvin Decl., ¶ 4.) Plaintiffs contend no monetary
sanctions are warranted as they have fully complied with their discovery
obligations. Plaintiffs also contend sanctions should not be imposed where
compliance is achieved, given Plaintiffs have now complied by providing their
discovery responses.
 
            In reply, Defendants contend that
Plaintiffs have not explained what the administrative delays were and that Plaintiffs
still have not paid the monetary sanctions per the Court’s August 6, 2024 and
August 7, 2024 orders.
 
            The Court finds that terminating
sanctions are not warranted here given Plaintiffs have finally provided their verified
responses. (Chisvin Decl., Exs. A, B; see Doppes, 174
Cal.App.4th at 992.) Nevertheless, Plaintiffs’ continued discovery abuse
warrants sanctions. Defendants previously gave notice of the Court’s August 6,
2024 and August 7, 2024 orders. (Notice of Ruling (8/6/24); Notice of Ruling
(8/7/24).) Plaintiffs did not provide any explanation regarding what purported
“administrative delays” caused Plaintiffs’ failure to provide verified
responses within the timeframes of the Court’s orders. (Chisvin Decl., ¶ 4; Minute Order (8/6/24); Minute
Order (8/7/24).) 
 
            The Court GRANTS the motion for
monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,050.00, comprised of 4.5 hours preparing
the motion, reviewing the opposition, preparing the reply, and appearing at the
hearing on the motion, multiplied by the hourly rate of $220.00, plus the
$60.00 filing fee. 
 
CONCLUSION AND
ORDER
 
The Court DENIES the motion for
terminating sanctions. 
 
The Court orders Plaintiffs and
their counsel to pay $1,050.00 in monetary sanctions to counsel for Defendants
within 30 days. 
 
Defendants shall provide notice and file a proof of service of such.
