And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion by the defendants to compel the Los Angeles County Registrar-Recorder/County Clerk and California Department of Public Health to produce any confidential marriage certificates filed between the plaintiffs, Kanwardeep Singh and Rochelle Yullin Arias. The defendants served subpoenas on the non-party deponents, but did not personally serve the instant motion on them. The plaintiffs do not oppose the motion, and the judge finds good cause to order the production of the confidential marriage certificates. The judge orders the Los Angeles County Clerk to provide any confidential marriage certificates filed between the plaintiffs to the defendants' counsel, and requires the defendants to provide notice of the Court's ruling and file a proof of service of such.
