And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge is considering a motion to relieve Attorney Eduardo Martorell as counsel for Plaintiff Carmen Alexandra Zometa. The motion is based on a breakdown in attorney-client communication, which is a valid reason for withdrawal. However, the proposed order (MC-053) is incomplete and contains errors, and the Judge orders Counsel to file an amended form within 5 calendar days. Counsel must also serve the signed order within 10 days and file a proof of service. The Judge conditionally grants the motion pending Counsel's filing and service of the updated form, and Counsel will remain the attorney of record for Plaintiff until the updated proposed order is filed and served.
