This is an auto accident case. On January 12,
2023, plaintiffs Joanne Batch, Nicholas Batch, and Nathanael Batch, a minor, by
and through his Guardian Ad Litem, Joanne Batch (collectively, Plaintiffs), filed
this action against defendants Ruben Ambrose Acevedo (Ruben), Alissa Acevedo,
and Does 1 to 100, alleging causes of action for negligence (motor vehicle),
general negligence, negligent entrustment, and loss of consortium. 
On December 6, 2023, Nathanael Batch (Claimant),
a minor, by and through his Guardian Ad Litem, Joanne Batch (Petitioner), filed
a petition to confirm minor’s compromise. 
On January 10, 2024, after being called for
hearing, the Court continued the hearing on the petition to permit Petitioner
to correct issues identified in the Court’s tentative ruling. 
On January 12, 2024, Nathanael Batch (Claimant),
a minor, by and through his Guardian Ad Litem, Joanne Batch (Petitioner), filed
this petition to confirm minor’s compromise. 
DISCUSSION
Plaintiffs have
agreed to settle their claims with Defendant in exchange for $175,000.00, $7,500.00 of which
will go to Claimant. If approved, $1,875.00 will be paid in attorney’s fees, $792.05
will be paid for reimbursement of case costs advanced by Claimant’s attorneys,
and $185.92 will be paid to The Rawlings Company as reimbursement of medical
expenses paid by Kaiser Permanente, leaving a balance of $4,647.03 for
Claimant, to be deposited into a blocked account. 
Court approval is required for
all settlements of a minor’s claim. (Probate Code, §§ 3500, 3600, et seq.; Code Civ. Proc., § 372.) The
Court has reviewed the proposed settlement and finds the proposed attorney’s
fees, equaling 25% of Claimant’s settlement proceeds, to be fair and reasonable.
The Court further finds that everything else appears to be in order. 
Based on the foregoing, the Court
GRANTS the petition. 
CONCLUSION
The Court
GRANTS the petition for minor’s
compromise. 
Petitioner is ordered to provide notice of the Court’s
ruling and file proof of service of same within five days of the Court’s order.
