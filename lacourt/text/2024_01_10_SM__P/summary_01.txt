Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Wetzel v. Board of Trustees of the California State University (Case No. 23SMCV03162). The plaintiff, Wetzel, alleges that she paid the defendant $10,600 for a certificate program that she claims is necessary for her to become a speech language pathologist, but the program does not enable her to achieve this goal. The defendant has demurred to the complaint, arguing that it is unclear whether the contract is oral, written, or implied by conduct.

The court has sustained the demurrer with leave to amend, meaning that the plaintiff has the opportunity to revise the complaint to clarify the nature of the contract. The court has also sustained the demurrer as to the second and third causes of action, which are based on breach of contract (implied in fact) and unjust enrichment/quasi-contract (implied in law), respectively.

The court has also granted the defendant's motion to strike the plaintiff's request for attorney's fees, as the demurrer was sustained and the plaintiff has agreed to dismiss the third and fourth causes of action, which were for conversion and unjust enrichment/quasi-contract (implied in law), respectively.
