And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to compel an independent medical examination (IME) by Dr. Michael Gold. The motion is granted, and the IME will occur within 10 days unless otherwise agreed to by the parties. The judge agrees that good cause exists to order the examination, as Plaintiff Guven Uzun has not been examined since June 2021, and Defendants are entitled to a clear and current picture of Plaintiff's current status. The judge also notes that conducting an IME in a federal court action, even if related to this case, would not trigger the protections of Code of Civil Procedure § 2032.220(a) and a single IME. The judge is not inclined to grant sanctions, as the procedural history posed a reasonable question as to Defendants' entitlement to a second IME, and thus the opposition was justified.
