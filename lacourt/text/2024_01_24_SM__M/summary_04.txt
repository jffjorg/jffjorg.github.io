Here is a summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling addresses a demurrer and a motion to strike punitive damages in the case of Avrech, et al. v. Delta Capital LLC. The demurrer claims that the plaintiff's complaint fails to state sufficient facts and is subject to the statute of limitations. The Judge sustains the demurrer with leave to amend, citing the need for the plaintiff to attach a copy of the lease and estoppel certificate to the complaint.

The Judge also addresses the motion to strike punitive damages, finding that the complaint alleges sufficient facts to support an award of punitive damages. The Judge notes that the plaintiff's allegations of intentional delay and retaliation in response to complaints of defects could support a claim of punitive damages. The motion to strike is denied.

The Judge orders the plaintiff to file an amended complaint within 10 days.
