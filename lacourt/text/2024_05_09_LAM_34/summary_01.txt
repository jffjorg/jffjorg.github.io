And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendants' ex parte motion to stay the action for more than seven months until their motion to compel arbitration is heard. The court has expressed concerns that the defendants are using delaying tactics to prolong the case, and that granting the motion would allow defendants to file a motion to compel arbitration at the beginning of a case and then set it for hearing months or years later, effectively staying the case indefinitely. The court has stated that it is committed to achieving substantive justice in a timely manner and will not tolerate delaying tactics.
