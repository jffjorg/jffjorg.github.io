            Relevant Background
                        
            On June 16,
2023, Plaintiff served Defendant with a Notice of Deposition of Defendant’s
Person Most Qualified.  The Notice sets
forth twenty-seven (27) categories and twenty-five (25) requests for production
of documents at deposition.  The
deposition was noticed for July 20, 2023.
 
            On June 26,
2023, defense counsel requested Plaintiff’s availability for deposition.  Defense counsel did not mention whether Defendant
would appear for the person most qualified (PMQ) deposition.  
 
            On June 29,
2023, defense counsel again inquired about Plaintiff’s availability for
deposition.  Plaintiff’s counsel
responded on the same day by requesting confirmation of Defendant’s appearance
for the PMQ deposition or to provide alternate dates.  Defense counsel indicated that she would be
unavailable on the noticed deposition date of July 20, 2023 from 2:00 p.m. and
onward.  Plaintiff’s counsel confirmed
the deposition would likely require the entire day and again requested
alternate dates.
 
            On July 12,
2023, defense counsel confirmed that the noticed PMQ deposition date of July
20, 2023 would not work for a full-day deposition.  Defense counsel asked Plaintiff for alternate
dates. 
 
            On July 13,
2023, Defendant served an Objection to the Notice.  The Objection was based upon defense
counsel’s unavailability for the deposition date.  Defendant did not propose alternate dates.  
 
            On July 31,
2023, Plaintiff’s counsel again inquired about possible dates for the PMQ
deposition. 
 
            On August
3, 2023, defense counsel indicated they were working on dates and hoped to
produce one PMQ for all the topics.  In
the parties email exchange, a disagreement arose over who was responsible for
providing alternate dates for the PMQ deposition, and whether there was a
currently noticed PMQ deposition.  Plaintiff’s
counsel again requested alternate dates by August 4, 2023.
 
            On August
8, 2023, after Defendant had yet to propose deposition dates, Plaintiff filed
this motion to compel the deposition of Defendant’s PMQ.  Plaintiff seeks sanctions against Defendant
and its counsel. 
 
            On August
9, 2023, defense counsel notified Plaintiff’s counsel by email that she had
been out of state and traveling from August 5-8, 2023, and was thus
unavailable.  However, defense counsel
was able to speak with Defendant’s PMQ, Kimberly McFerguson, and had obtained
her dates of availability.
 
            Thereafter,
the parties came to an agreement over a deposition date.  Plaintiff deposed McFerguson on September 27,
2023.  At the deposition, Ms. McFerguson
indicated that she was not the PMQ for all deposition topics and identified two
other individuals—Jonathan Hernandez and Janie. Li— who may have knowledge of
the remaining PMQ topics. 
 
            On November
17, 2023, Defendant filed an Opposition, arguing that Plaintiff’s motion was
moot given that Ms. McFerguson had been deposed and that the parties were
working on deposition dates for the two other individuals.  Defendant requests sanctions against
Plaintiff and his counsel for persisting with this motion.
 
            On November
22, 2023, Plaintiff filed a Reply, arguing the motion is not moot because Mr.
Hernandez and Ms. Li had yet to be deposed. 
             
II.        LEGAL STANDARDS
 
Any party may obtain discovery by
taking in California the oral deposition of any person.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2025.010.)  “If, after service of a deposition notice, a party to the
action…without having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails to
appear for examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for inspection any
document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the
deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move for an order compelling
the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the production for inspection of
any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in
the deposition notice.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd.
(a).)   
 
            Monetary
Sanctions¿ 
¿ 
            Code
of Civil Procedure section 2023.030 is a general statute authorizing the Court
to impose discovery sanctions for “misuse of the discovery process,” which
includes (without limitation) a variety of conduct such as: making, without
substantial justification, an unmeritorious objection to discovery; making an
evasive response to discovery; and unsuccessfully and without substantial
justification making or opposing a motion to compel or limit discovery.¿ (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2023.010.)¿¿ 
¿ 
            If
sanctions are sought, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.040 requires that
the notice specify the identity of the person against whom sanctions are sought
and the type of sanction requested, that the motion be supported in the points
and authorities, and the facts be set forth in a declaration supporting the
amount of any monetary sanction.¿¿¿¿ 
 
            “If
a motion under [Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.450] subdivision (a) is
granted, the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing
with Section 2023.010) in favor of the party who noticed the deposition and
against the deponent or the party with whom the deponent is affiliated, unless
the court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial
justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction
unjust.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (g)(1).)¿¿¿¿ 
 
Sanctions against counsel:¿ The court in Kwan
Software Engineering, Inc. v. Hennings (2020) 58 Cal.App.5th 57, 81 (Hennings)
noted that discovery sanctions against an attorney are governed by a different
standard than sanctions against a party:¿¿¿ 
¿ 
By the terms of the statute, a trial court under section
2023.030(a) may not impose monetary sanctions against a party’s attorney unless
the court finds that the attorney “advised” the party to engage in the conduct
resulting in sanctions. (§ 2023.030(a); Ghanooni v. Super Shuttle (1993)
20 Cal.App.4th 256, 261, 24 Cal.Rptr.2d 501.)¿ “Unlike monetary sanctions
against a party, which are based on the party's misuse of the discovery
process, monetary sanctions against the party's attorney require a finding the
‘attorney advis[ed] that conduct.’ ” (Ibid.) “It is not enough that the
attorney's actions were in some way improper.” (Corns v. Miller (1986)
181 Cal.App.3d 195, 200, 226 Cal.Rptr. 247 (Corns).) Because an
attorney's advice to a client is “peculiarly within [his or her] knowledge,”
the attorney has the burden of showing that he or she did not counsel discovery
abuse. (Ibid.) Accordingly, when a party seeking sanctions against an
attorney offers sufficient evidence of a misuse of the discovery process, the
burden shifts to the attorney to demonstrate that he or she did not recommend
that conduct. (Id. at pp. 200–201, 226 Cal.Rptr. 247; Ghanooni,
at p. 262, 24 Cal.Rptr.2d 501.)¿
 
III.      DISCUSSION
 
            It is
undisputed that Defendant produced Ms. McFerguson for deposition on September
27, 2023. As such, the motion is moot.   
 
            Plaintiff
argues the motion is still at issue because Ms. McFerguson stated she was not
the PMQ for all the deposition topics and identified Mr. Hernandez and Ms. Li
as the persons most qualified for the remaining topics.  Further, Defendant only recently provided
deposition dates for Mr. Hernandez and has not yet confirmed Ms. Li’s
availability.  (See Reply, Chami Decl.,
Ex. F.)  However, it appears Defendant is
striving to provide available dates for the depositions of Mr. Hernandez and
Ms. Li.  Plaintiff does not show that Defendant
has engaged in any of the conduct giving rise to a motion to compel a party’s
deposition: Defendant has not served an invalid objection, let alone any
objection, to the deposition of Mr. Hernandez or Ms. Li, nor has either individual failed to appear for deposition.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd.
(a).)  Given the foregoing, an order compelling Defendant’s
deposition is not warranted.
 
            Monetary
Sanctions
 
            The parties
each request imposition of sanctions against the other and their counsel.          
Plaintiff argues sanctions are warranted against Defendant and
its counsel because Defendant objected to the deposition notice based on
unavailability.  As such, Defendant was
responsible for providing alternate dates yet failed to do so despite numerous
requests from Plaintiff.  Plaintiff
further argues that Defendant provided deposition dates only because this
motion was filed.  
 
            Defendant
argues sanctions are warranted against Plaintiff and his counsel because Defendant
requested alternate dates when it became clear defense counsel would be
unavailable for the July 20, 2023 deposition date.  Defense counsel also states in her declaration
that she was in the process of obtaining the requested dates.  Plaintiff was so notified on August 1,
2023.  However, because defense counsel
was traveling, and because of Ms. McFerguson’s unavailability, defense counsel
did not obtain the dates until August 8, 2023. 
(Alameddine Decl., ¶¶ 6-10.)
 
            The Court declines
to award (or impose) sanctions.  Plaintiff
may be technically correct that, Defendant, as the party objecting to the
notice based on unavailability, should have provided alternate dates.  However, Defendant requested the same of
Plaintiff prior to serving its written objection to the notice, and only served
the objection when Plaintiff did not respond. 
In sum, both parties requested alternate dates.  Neither party did not do so until engaging in
a lengthy meet and confer process.  This
motion could have been avoided altogether if the parties had not unreasonably insisted
that the other party “blink first.” 
            
IV.       CONCLUSION 
 
            The motion
is moot.  The requests for sanctions are
denied.
 
Moving party to give notice, unless waived.
