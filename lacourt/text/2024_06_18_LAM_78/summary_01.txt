And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for summary judgment filed by First American Title Company (FATC). The ruling denies FATC's motion, finding that there is a triable issue of material fact regarding whether FATC owed a duty of care to the Plaintiffs.

The Plaintiffs, Kenney Kapoor, Zalfa Halaby Elkins, and Charles Elkins, brought a lawsuit against FATC, alleging that it breached its duty of care in processing the escrow sale of the Hacienda Property. FATC argued that it did not owe a duty of care to the Plaintiffs and that it did not breach its duty of care.

The judge found that there is a triable issue of material fact regarding whether FATC knew of the dispute between the Plaintiffs and Kapoor over the Hacienda Property. If FATC knew of the dispute, it would have known of the Plaintiffs' allegations that the property was mistakenly transferred to REZ-CA and that Sullivan had fraudulently conveyed the property back to South Shore.

The judge also found that FATC failed to meet its burden of proof on summary judgment, as there is no evidence that FATC was unaware of the dispute over the Hacienda Property. The judge denied FATC's motion for summary judgment and granted the Plaintiffs' opposition in part.
