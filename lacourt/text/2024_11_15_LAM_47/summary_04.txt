And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge, Theresa M. Traber, has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Michael S. Yu, et al. v. Bank of the West, et al. (Case No. BC562415). The case involves a real property dispute, with the plaintiffs alleging that they were fraudulently induced to liquidate their real property, which was wrongfully obtained by the defendants.

Attorney John M. Moscarino has moved to be relieved as counsel for the defendants, Commercial Loan Solutions, LLC and Commercial Loan Solutions III, LLC. The judge has granted the motion, finding that Moscarino has demonstrated good cause for withdrawal. The judge's ruling is conditioned on Moscarino giving notice of the ruling to all parties and filing proof of service with the court.

The judge has also set a status conference for January 15, 2025, at 8:30 a.m. to discuss the retention of counsel for the corporate defendants. Any party may submit on the tentative ruling by contacting the courtroom via email by November 14, 2024, at 4:00 p.m.
