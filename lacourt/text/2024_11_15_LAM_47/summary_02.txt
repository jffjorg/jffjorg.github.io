And here is the summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motions brought by Defendants Rose Choi and Anthony Youngwon Choi to compel Plaintiff Tiffany Wilson to respond to interrogatories and requests for production, and to seek sanctions. The motions were served on Plaintiff by electronic service, but the judge finds that this service was not proper because Plaintiff has not consented to electronic service. As a result, the judge denies the motions to compel and the requests for sanctions. The judge orders the moving parties to give notice of the ruling.
