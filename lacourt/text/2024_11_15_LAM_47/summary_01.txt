And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling by Judge Theresa M. Traber denies the City of Montebello's motion for attorney's fees as the prevailing party on the petition. The petition was filed by NASA Services, Inc. and 1701 Gage Road, LLC, challenging the City's denial of a conditional use permit for a solid waste transfer station. The City moved for attorney's fees under federal law, but failed to address whether the petitioners' claims were "groundless or without foundation" as required by the Supreme Court. The judge finds that the petitioners' claims were not frivolous, citing the City's unsupported findings for the conditional use permit. As a result, the City's motion for attorney's fees is denied.
