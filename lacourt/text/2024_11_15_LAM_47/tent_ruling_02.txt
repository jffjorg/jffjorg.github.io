STATEMENT
OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
            This is a habitability and trespass action filed on April 21, 2023.  Plaintiff leased an office from Defendants
which she alleges was contaminated with toxic mold. Plaintiff also alleges that
Defendants entered the office without permission and took documents belonging
to Plaintiff. 
 
Defendants Rose Choi and Anthony
Youngwon Choi move to compel Plaintiff to respond to interrogatories and
requests for production, and for sanctions. 
            
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Defendants Rose Choi and Anthony
Youngwon Choi move to compel Plaintiff to respond to interrogatories and
requests for production, and for sanctions. 
 
Code of Civil Procedure section
1010.6 authorizes electronic service on unrepresented persons in civil actions
only when the person to be served has consented to electronic service. (Code
Civ. Proc. § 1010.6(c)(1)-(2).) Consent to electronic service is made by either
(1) serving notice on all parties and filing notice with the Court; or (2)
manifesting affirmative consent through electronic means with the Court or the
Court’s e-filing service provider and concurrently providing the party’s
email for receiving service. (Code Civ. Proc. § 1010.6(c)(3).) The act of
electronic filing is not express consent. (Id.) 
 
Here, each of the six motions
brought by these Defendants was purportedly served on Plaintiff by electronic
service on May 24, 2024, according to the proofs of service accompanying the
motions. However, Plaintiff in this action is a self-represented litigant who
has never filed a notice of consent to electronic service, nor has she
manifested affirmative consent through electronic means. Defendants have
therefore failed to give proper notice of these motions. 
 
            Accordingly,
Defendant Rose Choi’s Motions to Compel Responses to Form Interrogatories,
Special Interrogatories, and Requests for Production are DENIED.
 
            Defendant
Anthony Youngwon Choi’s Motions to Compel Responses to Form Interrogatories,
Special Interrogatories, and Requests for Production are DENIED.
 
            Defendants’
Requests for Sanctions are DENIED.
 
            Moving
Parties to give notice.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.

            Any party may submit on the
tentative ruling by contacting the courtroom via email at Smcdept47@lacourt.org by no later than 4:00 p.m. the day
before the hearing. All interested parties must be copied on the email. It
should be noted that if you submit on a tentative ruling the court will still
conduct a hearing if any party appears. By submitting on the tentative you
have, in essence, waived your right to be present at the hearing, and you
should be aware that the court may not adopt the tentative, and may issue an
order which modifies the tentative ruling in whole or in part.
