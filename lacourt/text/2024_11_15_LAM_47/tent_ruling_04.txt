STATEMENT
OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
            This is a real property dispute. Plaintiffs allege that, after defaulting
on a loan, they were fraudulently induced to liquidate their real property,
which was wrongfully obtained by Defendants for a fraction of its actual value
and thereafter sold. 
 
Attorney John M. Moscarino moves to
be relieved as counsel for Defendants Commercial Loan Solutions, LLC and
Commercial Loan Solutions III, LLC.
            
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Attorney John M. Moscarino moves to
be relieved as counsel for Defendants Commercial Loan Solutions, LLC and
Commercial Loan Solutions III, LLC.
 
Moving counsel filed all three required forms (MC-051,
-052, and -053) as to both parties and filed proof of service by mail with the
Court. Moving counsel served the motions on the Defendants by mail and
confirmed that the addresses were current by email and telephone conversation.
(MC-052 ¶ 3(b).) 
 
In general, an attorney may withdraw with
or without cause so long as the withdrawal would not result in undue prejudice
to the client’s interest – i.e., counsel cannot withdraw at a critical point in
the litigation, because that would prejudice client, but can withdraw
otherwise. (Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal. App. 4th 904,
915.) The court has discretion to deny an attorney’s request to withdraw where
the withdrawal would work an injustice or cause undue delay in the proceeding,
but the court’s discretion in this area is one to be exercised reasonably. (Mandell
v. Superior Court (1977) 67 Cal.App.3d 1, 4.)   
 
            Here, the first phase of trial in
this matter has concluded, and the second phase of trial has not yet been set.
Further, the only other hearing in this matter is a Status Conference set to
coincide with the hearings on these motions. The risk of prejudice to these
Defendants is therefore low. Moving Counsel states that withdrawal is necessary
because both clients have assigned all their property to CLS ABC in an
assignment for the benefit of creditors filed in Hennepin County, Minnesota,
and the clients have been placed into receivership. (MC-052 ¶ 2.) Moving
Counsel states that the clients therefore have no assets with which to honor
their fee agreements with counsel. (Id.) In light of the low risk of
prejudice to the parties at this juncture, the Court finds that Moving Counsel
has demonstrated good cause for withdrawal. 
 
            Accordingly, Attorney John M.
Moscarino’s Motion to be Relieved as Counsel for Commercial Loan Solutions, LLC
is GRANTED.
 
            Attorney John M. Moscarino’s Motion
to be Relieved as Counsel for Commercial Loan Solutions III is GRANTED.
 
            This ruling is conditioned on Moving
Counsel giving notice of this ruling to all parties and filing proof of service
with the Court.
 
            The Court sets a Status Conference
Re: Retention of Counsel for Corporate Defendants for Wednesday, January 15,
2025 at 8:30 A.M. 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
 
Dated:  November 15,
2024                            ___________________________________

            Any party may submit on the
tentative ruling by contacting the courtroom via email at Smcdept47@lacourt.org by no later than 4:00 p.m. the day
before the hearing. All interested parties must be copied on the email. It
should be noted that if you submit on a tentative ruling the court will still
conduct a hearing if any party appears. By submitting on the tentative you
have, in essence, waived your right to be present at the hearing, and you
should be aware that the court may not adopt the tentative, and may issue an
order which modifies the tentative ruling in whole or in part.
