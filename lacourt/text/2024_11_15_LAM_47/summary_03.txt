And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on Attorney Gregory L. Mast's application to be admitted as counsel for Defendants pro hac vice. The application is verified and complies with the requirements of Rule 9.40, except that it does not include the dates of admission to each jurisdiction in which the applicant is licensed to practice. Despite this, the court will permit a brief continuance to allow the applicant to provide the missing information. The application is therefore continued to November 25, 2024 at 9:00 AM.
