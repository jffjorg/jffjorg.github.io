STATEMENT
OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
            This was a petition for writ of mandate challenging the City of
Montebello’s denial of a conditional use permit for the operation of a solid
waste transfer station. 
 
Respondents move for attorney’s
fees as the prevailing parties on the petition. 
            
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Respondents move for attorney’s
fees as the prevailing parties on the petition. 
 
The Petition in this action
asserted four causes of action: (1) petition for writ of mandate under
California Code of Civil Procedure sections 1094.5 and 1085; (2) denial of due
process rights; (3) denial of equal protection; and (4) declaratory relief.
(See generally Petition.) As relevant here, Petitioners’ second and third
causes of action were grounded in section 1983 of title 42 of the United States
Code. This statute authorizes claims against any person who, under color of
law, deprives another of their constitutional or statutory rights, privileges,
or immunities. (42 U.S. Code § 1983.) For any action under section 1983, subject
to exceptions not relevant here, “the court, in its discretion, may allow the
prevailing party, other than the United States, a reasonable attorney’s fee as
part of the costs[.]” (42 U.S. Code § 1988(b).) However, a court may only award
attorney’s fees under section 1988 if it finds that the plaintiff’s action is
“meritless in the sense that it is groundless or without foundation.” (Hughes
v. Rowe (1980) 449 U.S. 5, 14.) 
 
Although Respondents assert that
they are entitled to attorney’s fees as the prevailing parties, they make no
effort in their moving papers to address whether Petitioners’ claims were
“groundless or without foundation” as required by the Supreme Court’s
unequivocal holding.  Although it may
have been served on Petitioner, Respondents did not file a reply brief in
support of their motion; nor did they submit the requisite courtesy copy of any
reply brief to the Court. Moreover, according to Petitioner’s surreply, it
appears that Respondents’ reply still fails to reckon with the frivolousness
standard that is required for a defense fee award under section 1988.  As Petitioners argue, the dismissal of
Petitioners’ claims in the face of a summary judgment motion does not render
them frivolous. This is particularly true here where Judge Chalfant ruled that
three of the City’s four findings for the conditional use permit Petitioners
sought were unsupported by substantial evidence.  Given these procedural deficiencies, the
Court cannot find Petitioners’ contentions that the City violated their constitutional
rights to substantive due process and equal protection to be wholly
frivolous.  Respondents have therefore
failed to demonstrate that they are entitled to attorney’s fees under federal
law. 
 
Accordingly, Respondents’ Motion
for Attorney’s Fees is DENIED.
 
Moving Parties to give notice.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.

            Any party may submit on the
tentative ruling by contacting the courtroom via email at Smcdept47@lacourt.org by no later than 4:00 p.m. the day
before the hearing. All interested parties must be copied on the email. It
should be noted that if you submit on a tentative ruling the court will still
conduct a hearing if any party appears. By submitting on the tentative you
have, in essence, waived your right to be present at the hearing, and you
should be aware that the court may not adopt the tentative, and may issue an
order which modifies the tentative ruling in whole or in part.
