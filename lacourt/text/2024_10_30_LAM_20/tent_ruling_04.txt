  On July 28, 2023, John Koblanski filed the operative Complaint against Defendants Ultralytics, Inc. and Glenn Jocher for (1) declaratory relief, (2) breach of fiduciary duty, and (3) failure to pay minimum wages under FLSA.  Plaintiff alleges that he and Jocher formed a company, Ultralytics, Inc.  Plaintiff claims there was an agreement in which he was supposed to have a 35% interest in Ultralytics, but Jocher now asserts Plaintiff is owed nothing despite the time and effort that Plaintiff invested in making Utralytics successful.  On October 1, 2024, Defendants sought to dismiss this action for forum non conveniens. That request was denied.Defendants now seek a stay of discovery pending a ruling on the above motion to dismiss.  It’s not apparent why the instant Motion has not been withdrawn given the denial of the motion to dismiss.The Motion for Protective Order is denied as moot.Moving parties to give notice.
