And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has reviewed the demurrer and motion to strike filed by the Defendants, 801 SOUTH GRAND AVENUE (LA), INC., et al., in response to the Complaint filed by Plaintiff, Elat Properties, Inc. The Plaintiff alleges that it purchased a building from the Defendants on a short timeline so as not to pay the "mansion tax" and that during the transaction, the Plaintiff relied on a spreadsheet presented by the Defendants that falsely stated that the obligation amount for future tenant improvements for two units was $0 when it was actually $250,000.

The Judge has overruled the demurrer, finding that the Complaint adequately alleges that the Plaintiff relied on the statements in the spreadsheet and that the Defendants were aware that some improvements could not be reasonably discovered. The Judge has also denied the motion to strike the Complaint's references to punitive damages, finding that the motion is premature and that the fraud claim has survived.

The Judge has granted the Plaintiff 20 days to file an answer to the Complaint. The Judge has also declined to take judicial notice of the estoppel certificates provided to the Plaintiff, finding that the matter is disputed and that the Court should not take notice of the certificates without objection.
