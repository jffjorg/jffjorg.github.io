And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by Sandra Vartanian, trustee of the Sandra Vartanian Revocable Trust, to the Complaint filed by Plaintiffs Leticia Romo, John Michael Sanchez, and Juan Jose Sanchez. The Complaint alleges negligence, breach of warranty of habitability, and other claims against Sandra and other defendants. Sandra demurred to the Complaint, arguing that the allegations are uncertain and fail to state sufficient facts. The judge rejected Sandra's arguments, finding that the Complaint plainly states that nothing was done to restore utilities to the property during 2022/2023, when Sandra was an owner. The judge also found that the Complaint addresses multiple wrongs, including Sandra's failure to restore utilities to the entire property, and that the negligence claim is not time-barred. As a result, the judge overruled the demurrer and ordered Sandra to file an answer within 20 days.
