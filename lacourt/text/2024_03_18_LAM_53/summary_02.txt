And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the evidence presented by CitiStaff and has concluded that Junction Collaborative Transports is involved in shipping goods in and out of California. Additionally, CitiStaff has requested that the court order the plaintiff to submit his claims against all named defendants to arbitration. However, the judge has determined that CitiStaff does not have the authority to make this request, as it does not have standing to move the court for an order compelling arbitration against non-moving defendants. The judge's tentative ruling is that CitiStaff's request for arbitration will not be granted.
