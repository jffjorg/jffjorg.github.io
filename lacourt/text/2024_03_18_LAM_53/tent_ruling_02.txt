CitiStaff’s evidence establishes that Junction Collaborative Transports is
involved in the “shipping of goods in and out of California.”  (Slater Decl., ¶ 3.)

The court notes that it appears that CitiStaff requests that the court order
Plaintiff to submit his claims against all named defendants to
arbitration.  (Mot., pp. 12:1-27
[asserting that nonmoving defendant Junction Collaborative Transports is
entitled to move to compel arbitration pursuant to the Arbitration Agreements],
14:2-5 [stating that, because “all of Plaintiff’s claims against all Defendants
are subject to arbitration,” CitiStaff requests that “the parties” be ordered
to arbitration]; Reply, p. 10:10-12, 10:20-22 [CitiStaff requests that the
court compel Plaintiff “to submit his claims against all Defendants” to
arbitration] [emphasis added].) 
CitiStaff does not have standing to move the court for an order
compelling Plaintiff to submit his claims to arbitration against nonmoving
defendants.
