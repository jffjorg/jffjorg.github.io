And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling denies the defendant's motion to deem the plaintiff, Martin Ramirez, a vexatious litigant and dismiss the action or require the plaintiff to post a bond. The Judge finds that the defendant has not met its burden to show that the plaintiff repeatedly filed unmeritorious motions, pleadings, or other papers in the Mayendia Action, conducted unnecessary discovery, or engaged in other tactics that are frivolous or solely intended to cause unnecessary delay. The Judge notes that the plaintiff's conduct in the Mayendia Action and in this action may be viewed as unprofessional and uncivil, but this does not constitute vexatious litigation. The Judge orders the plaintiff to give notice of the ruling.
