[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING
  IN PART MOTION FOR SANCTIONS
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
October 12, 2023



 
On
January 12, 2022, Plaintiffs Victor Coronado and Philip Dimaggio filed this action
against Defendant General Motors LLC.
On
April 17, 2023, Plaintiffs moved to compel the deposition of Defendant’s person
most knowledgeable (“PMK”).  On June 16, 2023,
the Court granted the motion in part.  The
Court also approved the parties’ agreement that the PMK deposition take place on
July 20, 2023.  Counsel for all parties were
present at the hearing.
On
June 20, 2023, Plaintiffs attempted to confirm the deposition start time via email,
and on June 27, 2023, Plaintiffs served a notice of the Court’s June 16, 2023 ruling.  (Rabieian Decl. ¶¶ 3-4.)
On
July 18, 2023, Plaintiffs again sent an email requesting confirmation of the 11:00
a.m. start time for the deposition on July 20. 
(Rabieian Decl. ¶ 5.)  On July 19,
2023, Defendant’s counsel Cameron Major responded, “There was no agreement between
our offices that the PMK Deposition in this matter would proceed on July 20th.”  (Rabieian Decl. ¶ 6 & Ex. 5.)  Although Cameron Major did not appear at the June
16, 2023 hearing where the parties agreed to a July 20 deposition date, Xylon D.
Quezada appeared for him and on behalf of Defendant.  Plaintiffs responded to this email, and several
hours later, Defendant stated that it would not be producing its PMK.  (Rabieian Decl. ¶¶ 7-8.)  On July 20, 2023, Plaintiffs took an affidavit
of nonappearance at the deposition.  (Rabieian
Decl. ¶ 10.)
On
August 31, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a motion for monetary, issue, and evidentiary
sanctions.
A
court may impose an issue sanction ordering that designated facts must be taken
as established in accordance with the claim of the party adversely affected by the
misuse of the discovery process.  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (b).)  A court may
also impose an issue sanction prohibiting any party engaging in the misuse of the
discovery process from supporting or opposing designated claims or defenses.  (Ibid.)
“Discovery
sanctions are intended to remedy discovery abuse, not to punish the offending party.  Accordingly, sanctions should be tailored to serve
that remedial purpose, should not put the moving party in a better position than
he would otherwise have been had he obtained the requested discovery, and should
be proportionate to the offending party’s misconduct.”  (Williams v. Russ (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th
1215, 1223.)
On
September 29, 2023, the day after filing its opposition to this motion, Defendant
offered October 5, 2023 for the PMK deposition. 
(Rabieian Reply Decl. ¶ 5.)  On October
3, 2023, Defendant canceled the October 5, 2023 deposition, and the parties rescheduled
the deposition for October 11, 2023, the day before the hearing on this motion.  (Rabieian Reply Decl. ¶ 7.)
Because
Defendant is now cooperating with rescheduling the PMK deposition (which was scheduled
to occur the day before this hearing), the request for issue and evidentiary sanctions
is DENIED.
However,
Defendant appears to have reengaged in scheduling discussions and agreed to new
dates only in response to this motion.  Therefore,
Plaintiffs’ request for monetary sanctions is GRANTED.  Defendant’s counsel is ordered to pay sanctions
of $2,610.00 to Plaintiffs within 30 days.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
 
        
Dated this 12th day of October 2023
