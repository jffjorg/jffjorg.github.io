[TENTATIVE] ORDER DENYING DEFENDANT’S MOTION
  FOR PROTECTIVE ORDER 
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
October 12, 2023



 
On January 30, 2023, Plaintiff
Priscilla Gonzalez filed this action against Defendant Dorothy D. Inc. and others.
On
August 24, 2023, Defendant filed a motion for protective order for Plaintiff’s deposition
of Defendant’s PMK with request for production of documents.
Upon
a showing of good cause, the Court may issue a protective order to protect a party
or deponent from unwarranted annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden
and expense.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.420,
subd. (b).)  The protective order may include
directions that the deposition not be taken, be taken at a different time or place,
be taken on certain specified terms and conditions, be taken by written instead
of oral examination, or that the scope be limited to certain matters.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.420, subd. (b).)  “[T]he burden is on the party seeking the protective
order to show good cause for whatever order is sought.”  (Fairmont Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (2000)
22 Cal.4th 245, 255.)
Plaintiff
served a PMK deposition notice with request for documents on May 31, 2023, for a
deposition on August 25, 2023.  (Opposition,
Wagner Decl. ¶¶ 3, 11 & Ex. B.)  On August
24, 2023 at 9:15 a.m., Plaintiff’s counsel emailed Defendant’s counsel to “confirm
the deposition of the PMQ is going forward tomorrow and where you would like the
zoom link sent.”  (Motion, Waddell Decl.,
Ex. A; Opposition, Wagner Decl., Ex. G.) 
At 9:27 a.m., Defendant’s counsel responded, “Ok.  Well, the deposition is not going forward.  My client is unavailable.”  Defendant filed this motion at 8:20 p.m. the same
day.
Defendant’s
“unfortunate calendaring defect wherein the request for that August 25, 2023 date
to be calendared was not actually calendared” (Motion, Waddell Decl.; see also Reply
at p. 3) is not good cause for a protective order.  Defendant’s counsel’s declaration is entirely
conclusory and lacks any factual specificity regarding annoyance, embarrassment,
oppression, or undue burden and expense that would occur due to the deposition.  (See Nativi v. Deutsche Bank National Trust
Co. (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 261, 318; Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.420, subds. (a)-(b).)
Instead,
Defendant appears to ask that its objections not be deemed waived.  (See Motion at pp. 4-5; Reply at pp. 4-5.)  For an August 25, 2023 deposition, Defendant’s
objections to the deposition notice and request to quash the notice were due by
August 22.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.410,
subds. (a), (c).)  Defendant still has not
objected to the deposition notice or request for production of documents.  (Opposition, Wagner Decl. ¶ 15.)  There is no evidence that Defendant has since
produced its PMK for deposition or served a substantially compliant response to
the request for production of documents. 
(See Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a).)  Thus, whether viewed as a motion for protective
order or a motion for relief from waiver, Defendant has not met its burden.
The
motion for protective order is DENIED.
Plaintiff’s
request for sanctions is granted in part. 
(See Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.420, subd. (h).)  Defendant’s counsel is ordered to pay sanctions
of $3,000.00 to Plaintiff within 30 days.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
