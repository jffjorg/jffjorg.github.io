And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling by Judge Thomas D. Long overrules the demurrer filed by Defendants Eun Hee Song, et al. to the eighth cause of action (negligent misrepresentation) in the fourth amended complaint (4AC) filed by Plaintiff TL Veterans Construction, Inc. The Judge finds that the 4AC sufficiently alleges the essential elements of negligent misrepresentation, including the representation, justifiable reliance, and harm. Specifically, the Plaintiff alleged that it relied on a certificate of insurance provided by Defendants, which stated that Plaintiff was an additional insured on the project. The Judge therefore denies the demurrer and orders the Defendants to file an answer within 10 days.
