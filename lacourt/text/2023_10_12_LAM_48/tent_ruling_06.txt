[TENTATIVE] ORDER OVERRULING DEFENDANT’S
  DEMURRER
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
October 12, 2023



 
On
November 10, 2022, Plaintiff Luis Abundes filed this action against Defendant Antonio
Perez and others.
On
February 2, 2023, Defendant filed a demurrer to the first cause of action for quiet
title, the only cause of action brought against him.
At
the original June 6, 2023 hearing on the motion, the Court granted Plaintiff leave
to amend, continued the hearing on the demurrer, and allowed supplemental briefing.
Plaintiff
filed a first amended complaint (“FAC”) on September 15, 2023.
A
demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the complaint states a cause of action.  (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740,
747.)  When considering demurrers, courts
read the allegations liberally and in context, accepting the alleged facts as true.  (Nolte v. Cedars-Sinai Medical Center (2015)
236 Cal.App.4th 1401, 1406.)  “Because a demurrer
challenges defects on the face of the complaint, it can only refer to matters outside
the pleading that are subject to judicial notice.”  (Arce ex rel. Arce v. Kaiser Found. Health
Plan, Inc. (2010) 181 Cal.App.4th 471, 556.)
A.        Defendant’s Request For Judicial Notice
is Granted.
Defendant
asks the Court to take judicial notice of various documents recorded in the office
of the Los Angeles County Recorder or filed in a bankruptcy action.
The
Court may take judicial notice of the legal effect of documents’ language when the
effect is clear, but it may not take judicial notice of the truth of statements
of fact recited within the documents.  (Fontenot
v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 256, 265.)  The request is granted only to that extent.
Plaintiff’s
opposition to the documents is overruled.
B.        Defendant’s Evidentiary Objections Are
Sustained.
Defendant’s
objections to the Declaration of Negar Tehrani and its exhibits are sustained.  To the extent that the exhibits are an improper
form of Plaintiff requesting judicial notice of documents filed in an unlawful detainer
action, the Court denies the request as irrelevant.
C.        The Complaint and Judicially Noticeable
Facts Do Not Show That Plaintiff Lacks Standing.
The
Complaint alleges that on April 7, 1992, Yolanda Abundes forged Plaintiff’s signature
on a deed to transfer his joint tenancy interest in the property to his parents
and Yolanda Abundes.  (Complaint ¶ 35; FAC
¶ 35.)
Defendant
argues that Plaintiff lack standing to quiet title because he conveyed his interest
in the property before the allegedly forged deeds were recorded.  (Demurrer at pp. 13-15.)  Defendant identifies an August 27, 1987 deed through
which Plaintiff conveyed his interest in the property to his parents.  (Demurrer at p. 14; RJN, Ex. 3.)  The legal effect of that document is the property
transfer on the date of the deed.  It does
not, however, prove that Plaintiff did not own the property during any intervening
period prior to the 1992 forged deed.
The
Court allowed Plaintiff to file a FAC to address the 1987 deed.  (See Suppl. Demurrer at p. 3.)  The FAC alleges that Grant Deed dated August 28,
1987 that appears on the title of the property is a forgery.  (FAC ¶¶ 17, 34, 43.)  Plaintiff alleges that after his ex-wife transferred
her community property interest to Plaintiff in an Interspousal Transfer Deed recorded
on April 8, 1987, Plaintiff did not execute any other deeds in 1987.  (FAC ¶ 17.) 
This fact is sufficient, and it is not clear from the face of the complaints
that Plaintiff lacks standing.
The
demurrer is overruled on this ground.
D.        Plaintiff’s Statement In Bankruptcy Is
Not Inconsistent With This Action.
Defendant
argues that Plaintiff’s judicial admissions bar him from claiming an interest in
the property.  (Demurrer at pp. 15-16.)  In Plaintiff’s bankruptcy proceeding, Plaintiff
filed a January 20, 2023 schedule stating that he has zero real estate assets.  (Demurrer at pp. 16-17; RJN, Ex. 16.)  On demurrer, the Court cannot conclude that this
bars Plaintiff’s claim to quiet title in property that he alleges is wrongfully
owned by Defendant.
The
demurrer is overruled on this ground.
E.        The Complaint Is Not Facially Barred By
the Statute of Limitations.
Defendant
argues that the claim for quiet title is barred by the statute of limitations.  (Demurrer at pp. 18-19.)  To sustain a demurrer on the statute of limitations,
the running of the statute must appear clearly and affirmatively on the face of
the complaint.  (Geneva Towers Ltd. Partnership
v. City of San Francisco (2003) 29 Cal.4th 769, 781.)  “‘[I]t is not enough that the complaint might
be time-barred.  [Citation.]’”  (Ibid.)
“The
Legislature has not established a specific statute of limitations for actions to
quiet title. . . . Generally, the most likely time limits for a quiet title action
are the five-year limitations period for adverse possession, the four-year limitations
period for the cancellation of an instrument, or the three-year limitations
period for claims based on fraud and mistake.” 
(Salazar v. Thomas (2015) 236 Cal.App.4th 467, 476-477, footnotes
omitted.)  “‘“[A]s a general rule, the statute
of limitations [for a quiet title action] does not run against one in possession
of land.”’  [Citation.]  Part of the rationale for this special rule for
quiet title actions is an unwillingness to convert a statute of limitations into
a statute that works a forfeiture of property rights on the person holding the most
obvious and important property right—namely, possession.”  (Id. at p. 477.)
Defendant
notes that the allegedly forged deeds were recorded in 1992, and because Plaintiff
continued to live at the property, he “presumably should have also received the
recorded 1992 deeds in the mail.”  (Demurrer
at pp. 18-19.)  But as Defendant also notes,
the recorded deeds were mailed and addressed to Jesus, Elena, and Yolanda—not addressed
to Plaintiff.  (Demurrer at p. 19.)  Additionally, Plaintiff continued to live at the
property until after Defendant purchased the property without giving him notice
before the sale.  (Complaint ¶ 29; FAC ¶ 29.)  The Complaint’s allegations do not show that the
statute of limitations has run.
The
demurrer is overruled on this ground.
F.         The Unlawful Detainer Action Does Not
Bar This Action.
Defendant
argues that the quiet title claim is barred by res judicata because of Defendant’s
unlawful detainer action against Plaintiff. 
(Demurrer at pp. 20-21.)  A court may
sustain a general demurrer if all facts necessary to show that an action is barred
by res judicata are within the complaint or subject to judicial notice.  (Frommhagen v. Board of Supervisors (1987)
197 Cal.App.3d 1292, 1299.)  Res judicata
precludes the re-litigation of a cause of action that previously was adjudicated
in another proceeding between the same parties, or parties in privity with them.  (Federation of Hillside & Canyon Assns.
v. City of Los Angeles (2004) 126 Cal.App.4th 1180, 1202.)  “Res judicata applies if (1) the decision in the
prior proceeding is final and on the merits; (2) the present proceeding is on the
same cause of action as the prior proceeding; and (3) the parties in the present
proceeding or parties in privity with them were parties to the prior proceeding.”  (Ibid.)
“Ordinarily,
issues respecting the title to the property cannot be adjudicated in an unlawful
detainer action.”  (Martin-Bragg v. Moore
(2013) 219 Cal.App.4th 367, 385.)  “Defects
in the plaintiff’s title ‘are neither properly raised in [a] summary proceeding
for possession, nor are they concluded by the judgment.’”  (Ibid.)  Although both parties claimed ownership of the
property in the unlawful detainer action (see Demurrer at p. 20), the judgment was
only for possession.  (RJN, Ex. 14.)
The
demurrer is overruled on this ground.
G.        Conclusion
The
demurrer is OVERRULED.  Defendant is ordered
to file an answer within 10 days.  (California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1320(j)(1).)
Moving
party to give notice.
