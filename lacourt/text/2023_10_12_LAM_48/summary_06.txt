The judge has overruled the demurrer on all grounds. The judge found that the plaintiff has standing to quiet title to the property, that the complaint is not facially barred by the statute of limitations, and that the unlawful detainer action does not bar this action. The judge has ordered the defendant to file an answer within 10 days.
