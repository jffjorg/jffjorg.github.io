[TENTATIVE] ORDER OVERRULING DEMURRER TO
  FOURTH AMENDED COMPLAINT
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
October 12, 2023



 
On March 23, 2023, Plaintiff
TL Veterans Construction, Inc. filed a fourth amended complaint (“4AC”) against
Defendants RK All Insurance Services, Rian Kang, and others.  
On
April 3, 2023, Defendants filed a demurrer to the eighth cause of action, the only
brought against them.
A
demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the complaint states a cause of action.  (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740,
747.)  When considering demurrers, courts
read the allegations liberally and in context, accepting the alleged facts as true.  (Nolte v. Cedars-Sinai Medical Center (2015)
236 Cal.App.4th 1401, 1406.)
The
eighth cause of action alleges negligent misrepresentation.  “The essential elements of a count for intentional
misrepresentation are (1) a misrepresentation, (2) knowledge of falsity, (3) intent
to induce reliance, (4) actual and justifiable reliance, and (5) resulting damage.  [Citations.] 
The essential elements of a count for negligent misrepresentation are the
same except that it does not require knowledge of falsity but instead requires a
misrepresentation of fact by a person who has no reasonable grounds for believing
it to be true.  [Citations.]”  (Chapman v. Skype Inc. (2013) 220 Cal.App.4th
217, 230-231.)  “Causes of action for intentional
and negligent misrepresentation sound in fraud and, therefore, each element must
be pleaded with specificity.”  (Daniels
v. Select Portfolio Servicing, Inc. (2016) 246 Cal.App.4th 1150, 1166.)  “‘This particularity requirement necessitates
pleading facts which show how, when, where, to whom, and by what means the
representations were tendered.’  [Citation.]”  (Lazar v. Superior Court (1996) 12 Cal.4th
631, 645.)
Defendants
argue that the 4AC “does not specifically allege what misrepresentation was made,
how Plaintiff justifiably relied on the misrepresentation, nor how Plaintiff was
harmed.”  (Demurrer at p. 3.)  Plaintiff alleges that it told JNH that Plaintfif
needed proof that it would be insured for the work on the project, and that proof
of insurance was a condition of entering into the contract.  (4AC ¶ 85.) 
Defendants provided JNH with a certificate of insurance that names Plaintiff
as an additional named insured on the project. 
(4AC ¶ 87.)  In reliance on this statement
about Plaintiff being as additional named insured, Plaintiff hired JNH to work on
the project.  (4AC ¶ 90.)  This sufficiently alleges the representation,
justifiable reliance, and harm.
Defendants
also argue that “the Certificate is simply a notice of issuance of various different
insurance policies to JNR Roofing, Inc. as the named insured for general liability,
auto liability and workers compensation coverage, and describes plaintiff only as
a certificate holder.”  (Demurrer at p. 3.)  That is not correct.  The Certificate of Liability Insurance expressly
states: “TL Veterans Construction Inc. is listed as additional insured.  Project : DSH-Metropolitan SNF Building Roof Replacement.”  (4AC, Notice of Errata, Ex. 2.)
The
demurrer is OVERRULED.  Defendants are ordered
to file an answer within 10 days.  (California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1320(j)(1).)
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
