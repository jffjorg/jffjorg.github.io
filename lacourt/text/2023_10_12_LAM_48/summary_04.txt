And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The plaintiff, QBN Capital, LLC, has moved for summary judgment against the defendants, Eugenio A. Gonzalez, Monica Gonzalez, and Theresa Gonzalez. The defendants have alleged affirmative defenses of fraudulent inducement and undue influence.

The court has reviewed the evidence and found that the plaintiff has met its burden of proof and that the defendants have not presented sufficient evidence to raise a triable issue of fact regarding their affirmative defenses.

The court has granted the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment and ordered the plaintiff to submit a proposed judgment within five days.

The court has also scheduled a non-appearance case review for October 27, 2023, at 9:00 a.m. to review the proposed judgment.

The parties who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the court indicating their intention to submit. If all parties submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the court are required unless a companion hearing is also on calendar.
