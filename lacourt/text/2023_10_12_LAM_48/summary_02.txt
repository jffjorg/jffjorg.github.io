And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling on a motion for sanctions. The case involves Victor Coronado and Philip Dimaggio (plaintiffs) against General Motors LLC (defendant). The plaintiffs moved to compel the deposition of the defendant's person most knowledgeable (PMK) and the defendant failed to produce the PMK for deposition. The defendant's counsel cancelled the deposition and only agreed to new dates after the motion was filed. The court granted the request for monetary sanctions and ordered the defendant's counsel to pay $2,610.00 to the plaintiffs within 30 days. The request for issue and evidentiary sanctions was denied since the defendant is now cooperating with rescheduling the PMK deposition.
