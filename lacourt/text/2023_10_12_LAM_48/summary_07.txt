And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling denies the defendant's motion for a protective order to prevent a deposition of its PMK on August 25, 2023. The defendant claims that its PMK is unavailable for deposition due to an "unfortunate calendaring defect", but the court finds that this is not good cause for a protective order. The defendant's counsel's declaration lacks factual specificity regarding the alleged annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden and expense that would occur due to the deposition. The court also finds that the defendant has not met its burden to show good cause for a protective order. Additionally, the court grants the plaintiff's request for sanctions in the amount of $3,000.00 to be paid by the defendant's counsel within 30 days.
