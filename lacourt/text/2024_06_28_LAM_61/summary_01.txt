And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to compel arbitration, finding that the confidentiality provision and default discovery limitations are unconscionable. The judge ruled that the confidentiality provision is not based on a legitimate commercial need, and the default discovery limitations are not reasonable given the complexity of the case. However, the judge severed these unconscionable provisions from the rest of the arbitration agreement, allowing the motion to compel arbitration to proceed. The judge noted that the arbitration agreement contains a severability clause and that the unconscionable provisions do not indicate a systematic effort to impose an inferior forum upon the employee.
