And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Defendant Haiwei Yang's motion to set aside the default and default judgment that was entered against him. Yang claimed that he was unaware that his answer had to be verified and that his lack of awareness was a mistake within the meaning of Code of Civil Procedure Section 473(b). However, the judge found that Yang failed to file a verified answer by the deadline, despite receiving notice of the court's order to do so. The judge concluded that Yang did not demonstrate that the entry of the default and default judgment against him was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect, and therefore did not meet the requirements of Section 473(b) for relief from the default and default judgment.
