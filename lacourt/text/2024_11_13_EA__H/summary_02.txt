And here is a summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling denies Defendant/Cross-Complainant Yong Qi's motion to vacate the order compelling arbitration and lift the stay. The court granted Qi's motion to compel arbitration on March 4, 2024, and the case was stayed pending completion of the arbitration. Qi now seeks to vacate the order and lift the stay, arguing that the court lacks jurisdiction to do so. The court finds that it does lack jurisdiction, citing the California Code of Civil Procedure, as once a motion to compel arbitration is granted and the case is stayed, the court only retains "vestigial jurisdiction" over matters submitted to arbitration. The court cannot grant Qi's motion to vacate the arbitration order and lift the stay, as there is no agreement to withdraw the controversy from arbitration.
