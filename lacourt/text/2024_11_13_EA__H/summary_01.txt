And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Continental Casualty Company's application for default judgment against William Kellenberg without prejudice. The judge noted several defects in the application, including the lack of authentication of evidence, discrepancies in the calculation of interest, and typographical errors in the Declaration of Alison K. Schlick. The judge also expressed concern that the Court does not appear to be in possession of the underlying request corresponding to a proposed "Order to Accept Copies in Lieu of Originals." As a result, the judge ordered Continental Casualty Company to submit a revised default judgment packet that addresses these issues.
