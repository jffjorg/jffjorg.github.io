 Case Number:  23PSCV03961    Hearing Date:   July 24, 2024    Dept:  K Plaintiff Wesco
Insurance Company’s Motion for Leave to File Second Amended Complaint is GRANTED.

Background   
Plaintiff Wesco Insurance Company
(“Plaintiff”) seeks subrogation for a September 25, 2022 motor vehicle
accident. On March 1, 2024, Edgar Cisneros’
(“Defendant”) default was entered on the complaint.
On May 29, 2024, Plaintiff filed a
First Amended Complaint (“FAC”), asserting a cause of action against Defendant
and Does 1-10 for:
1.                 
Subrogation
On June 27, 2024, the court denied
Plaintiff’s “Ex Parte Application for Leave to File a Second Amended
Complaint.”
A Case Management Conference is
set for August 14, 2024.
Legal Standard
“The court
may, in furtherance of justice, and on any terms as may be proper, allow a
party to amend any pleading…” (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (a)(1); and see §
576 [“Any judge, at any time before or after commencement of trial, in the
furtherance of justice, and upon such terms as may be proper, may allow the
amendment of any pleading or pretrial conference order”].)
“[T]he trial
court has wide discretion in allowing the amendment of any pleading.” (Bedolla v. Logan & Frazer (1975) 52
Cal.App.3d 118, 135.) “[I]t is irrelevant that new legal theories are
introduced as long as the proposed amendments relate to the same general set of
facts.” (Kittredge Sports Co. v. Superior
Court (1989) 213 Cal.App.3d 1045, 1048 [quotation marks and citation
omitted].) “[E]ven if the proposed legal theory is a novel one, the preferable
practice would be to permit the amendment and allow the parties to test its legal sufficiency by demurrer, motion for judgment on the
pleadings or other appropriate proceedings.” (Id. [quotation marks and citation omitted].) With that said, “the
failure of a proposed amendment to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause
of action or defense may support an order denying a motion to amend.” (California
Casualty Gen. Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (1985) 173 Cal.App.3d 274, 280,
disapproved of on other grounds in Kransco v. American Empire Surplus Lines
Ins. Co. (2000) 23 Cal.4th 390)
Courts must
apply a policy of great liberality in permitting amendments to the complaint at
any stage of the proceedings, up to and including trial, when no prejudice is
shown to the adverse party. (Atkinson v.
Elk Corp. (2003) 109 Cal.App.4th 739, 761.) However, “even if a good
amendment is proposed in proper form, unwarranted delay in presenting it may—of
itself—be a valid reason for denial. . . denial may rest upon the element of
lack of diligence in offering the amendment after knowledge of the facts, or
the effect of the delay on the adverse party.” (Roemer v. Retail Credit Co. (1975) 44 Cal.App.3d 926, 940.)
“A motion to amend a pleading
before trial must: (1) Include a copy of the proposed amendment or amended
pleading, which must be serially numbered to differentiate it from previous
pleadings or amendments; (2) State what allegations in the previous pleading
are proposed to be deleted, if any, and where, by page, paragraph, and line
number, the deleted allegations are located; and (3) State what allegations are
proposed to be added to the previous pleading, if any, and where, by page,
paragraph, and line number, the additional allegations are located.” (Cal. Rules
of Court, rule 3.1324(a).)
Additionally, “[a] separate
declaration must accompany the motion and must specify: (1) The effect of the
amendment; (2) Why the amendment is necessary and proper; (3) When the facts
giving rise to the amended allegations were discovered; and (4) The reasons why
the request for amendment was not made earlier.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1324(b).)
Discussion
Plaintiff moves the
court, per Code of Civil Procedure § 473, for leave to file its proposed Second
Amended Complaint (“SAC”). Plaintiff represents that the proposed SAC is
“necessitated based on an error contained in the First Amended Complaint with
respect to PLAINTIFF’S alleged damages.” (Motion, 1:27-28).
The motion is
unopposed. Defendant’s default was previously entered as to Plaintiff’s
complaint. Court records reflect that Defendant was substitute served with
Plaintiff’s FAC on June 7, 2024 (completed June 17, 2024). Defendant has not
appeared, to date (i.e., as of July 17, 2024, 3:45 p.m.). Plaintiff’s counsel
Michael Daniels (“Daniels”) attests that he has made “multiple attempts” to
contact Defendant telephonically to obtain his consent to the filing of the
proposed SAC, without success. (Daniels Decl., ¶ 3).
The motion is
granted. The proposed SAC is deemed filed as of this date.
