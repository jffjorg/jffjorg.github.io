Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the defendants' motion for attorney's fees in the reduced amount of $36,612. This amount is based on the defendants' request for $37,212 in attorney's fees, which was reduced by the judge due to the defendants' failure to provide detailed billing statements for two hours of work on a reply to an opposition. The judge also awarded $3,805 in costs to the defendants.

The judge based its decision on the defendants' request for attorney's fees pursuant to an attorney's fee provision in the reciprocal easement agreement (REA) and the defendants' declaration of counsel, which provided detailed information about the hours worked and the hourly rate charged by the defendants' attorney.

The judge also considered the defendants' request for attorney's fees under the vexatious litigant statute, which allows for the release of attorney's fees and costs from the proceeds of a bond posted by a vexatious litigant. The judge determined that the plaintiff is a vexatious litigant and ordered the release of the attorney's fees and costs from the proceeds of the bond.

Overall, the judge's tentative ruling grants the defendants' motion for attorney's fees and costs, and releases those fees and costs from the proceeds of the bond posted by the plaintiff.
