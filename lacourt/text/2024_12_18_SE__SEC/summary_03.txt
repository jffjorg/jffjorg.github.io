Summary:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the motion for summary adjudication filed by Plaintiffs Melissa Giron and Rudy Giron against Defendant American Honda Motor Co., Inc. The motion is granted as to Honda's Fifth and Eighth Affirmative Defenses. The Court finds that there is no evidence that Honda maintains a qualified third-party dispute resolution process, and therefore, Plaintiffs are entitled to summary adjudication as to these issues. The Court also notes that even if Honda did have a third-party dispute resolution process, that would not be a shield to civil penalties under California Civil Code §1794(c) (which depends on a finding of willfulness). The burden now shifts to Defendant to show that a triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to the cause of action or a defense thereto.
