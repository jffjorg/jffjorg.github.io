And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion filed by Counsel Raymond Perez to be relieved as counsel in a premises liability action brought by Plaintiff Francisco Ramos against Union Pacific Railroad, et al. The motion was unopposed, but the court denied it without prejudice because Counsel did not provide sufficient justification or reasoning for the motion. The court noted that Counsel had not followed the required procedures for filing a motion to be relieved as counsel, and that the "Case Name" on the proposed order did not accurately reflect the name of the case. The court also stated that it could not determine whether good cause existed for Counsel's withdrawal because Counsel did not provide any information about the reasons for the motion.
