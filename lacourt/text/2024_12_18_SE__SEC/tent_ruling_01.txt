(collectively, Defendants) move the Court for an order determining Defendants
to be the prevailing parties in this action and for an award of attorney’s fees

Background
 
On March 10, 2021, Plaintiff Henry Aguila (Plaintiff) filed
this lawsuit against Defendants. The second amended complaint alleged: (1) interference
with prospective advantage, (2) negligence, (3) intentional infliction of emotional
distress, and (4) breach of contract. 
 
On March 1, 2023, the Court granted Defendants’ motion to
declare Plaintiff a vexatious litigant. The Court ordered Plaintiff to furnish
a security in the sum of $50,000.
 
On April 2, 2024, after granting summary judgment in favor
of Defendants, the Court entered judgment for Defendants.
 
On May 17, 2024, Plaintiff filed a notice of appeal. On
August 9, 2024, a notice of default was filed placing the appeal in default for
failure to timely pay deposit for a Reporter’s Transcript.
 
Legal Standard
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 1717 subd. (a) provides, “[i]n
any action on a contract, where the contract specifically provides that
attorney’s fees and costs, which are incurred to enforce that contract, shall
be awarded either to one of the parties or to the prevailing party, then the
party who is determined to be the party prevailing on the contract, whether he
or she is the party specified in the contract or not, shall be entitled to
reasonable attorney's fees in addition to other costs.”
 
In determining what fees are reasonable, California courts
apply the “lodestar” approach. (See, e.g., Holguin v. DISH Network LLC
(2014) 229 Cal.App.4th 1310, 1332.) This inquiry “begins with the ‘lodestar,’
i.e., the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable
hourly rate.” (See PLCM Group v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095.)
From there, the “[t]he lodestar figure may then be adjusted, based on
consideration of factors specific to the case, in order to fix the fee at the
fair market value for the legal services provided.” (Ibid.) Relevant
factors include: “(1) the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, (2)
the skill displayed in presenting them, (3) the extent to which the nature of
the litigation precluded other employment by the attorneys, [and] (4) the
contingent nature of the fee award.” (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th
1122, 1132.)
 
The trial court has broad authority to determine the amount
of a reasonable fee. (PLCM Group, Inc. v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th
1084, 1095.) The party bears the burden of proof as to “reasonableness” of any
fee claim. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (c)(5).) The party seeking fees
has the burden of documenting the appropriate hours expended and hourly rates. (City
of Colton v. Singletary (2012) 206 Cal.App.4th 751, 784.) This burden
requires competent evidence as to the nature and value of the services
rendered. (Martino v. Denevi (1986) 182 Cal.App.3d 553, 559.)
 
An attorney's testimony as to the number of hours worked is
sufficient evidence to support an award of attorney fees, even in the absence
of detailed time records or billing statements, and there is no requirement
that such records or statements be offered in evidence. (Steiny & Co.,
Inc. v. California Electric Supply Co. (2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 285, 293; see
also Horsford v. Board of Trustees of California State University (2005)
132 Cal.App.4th 359, 396.) 
 
If the items appear to be proper charges, a verified
memorandum is prima facie evidence that the costs, expenses, and services
therein listed were necessarily incurred by the prevailing party, then the
burden shifts to the opposing party to show that the items are unreasonable. (Decoto
Sch. Dist. of Alameda County v. M & S Tile Co. (1964) 225 Cal. App. 2d
310, 316-17.)
 
Discussion
 
Defendants move the Court, pursuant to Civil Code section
1717, Code of Civil Procedure section 1032 subd. (a)(4)(b), Code of Civil
Procedure section 1033.5 subd. (a)(10), and California Rules of Court rule
3.1702 for an order determining Defendants to be the prevailing parties in this
action and for an award of attorney fees in the amount of $37,212.00 and costs
in the amount of $3,805. Defendants request the Court release this amount from
the $50,000 cash bond posted by Plaintiff. As of this date, this motion is
unopposed.
 
          Prevailing
Party
 
Defendants seek attorney’s fees pursuant to an attorney’s
fee provision in the reciprocal easement agreement (REA). In relevant part, the
REA states: “should any of the provisions hereof be violation, it will be
difficult or impossible to determine the amount of damages resulting
therefrom….Any costs and expenses of any such proceeding, including reasonable
attorneys’ fees, shall be paid by the losing Owner to the prevailing Owner upon
demand therefor.” (RJN, Exh. A., REA, ¶ 9.1.) 
 
Pursuant to the REA and judgment in favor of Defendants,
Defendants are deemed the prevailing party.
 
          Reasonableness
of Attorney’s Fees
 
Defendants request $37,212 in attorney’s fees. Defendants concurrently
submit the declaration of counsel for Defendants, Barak Isaacs (Isaacs), and a
memorandum of costs.
 
Isaacs has been a practicing attorney for nearly twenty-five
years and has a normal billing rate of $400 per hour. (Isaacs Decl., ¶ 3.) In
this action, Isaacs reduced his billing rate to $300 per hour. (Isaacs Decl., ¶
3.) Isaacs spent 114.04 hours of work on this case, including an additional seven
hours preparing this motion. (Isaacs Decl., ¶ 5.) Isaacs includes billing
statements reflecting the hours of work expended on this case. (Isaacs Decl., ¶
4, Exh. A.) Isaacs anticipates two hours of work for replying to an opposition
and one hour for a hearing. (Isaacs Decl., ¶ 6.)
 
Here, Defendants have provided attorney testimony as well as
detailed billing statements. The Court finds that Isaac’s reduced billing rate
of $300 and 114.04 hours of work are reasonable. This action was filed on March
10, 2021, and there have been multiple complex motions filed including
demurrers and a motion for summary judgment. However, because no opposition was
filed, the Court deducts Isaac’s anticipated two hours of work on a reply. 
 
Additionally, Defendants include a memorandum of costs.
Defendants seek a total of $3,805 in costs. Here, the items requested in the
memorandum of costs appear to be proper charges and, therefore, the memorandum
of costs is prima facia evidence of the costs incurred by Defendants. (See Decoto
Sch. Dist. of Alameda County v. M & S Tile Co. (1964) 225 Cal. App. 2d
310, 316-17.) 
 
Accordingly, the Court GRANTS Defendants’ motion for
attorney’s fees in the reduced amount of $36,612 reflecting 114.04 hours of
work in this action, and 8 hours of work related to bringing this motion.
Additionally, the Court awards $3,805 in costs.
 
          Vexatious
Litigant
 
Defendants contend a separate basis for attorney’s fees
exists in the vexatious litigant statute and request the Court release the
attorney’s fees and costs from Plaintiff’s bond.
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 391 defines a “security” as “an
undertaking to assure payment, to the party for whose benefit the undertaking
is required to be furnished, of the party’s reasonable expenses, including
attorney’s fees and not limited to taxable costs, incurred in or in connection
with a litigation instituted, caused to be instituted, or maintained or caused
to be maintained by a vexatious litigant.” 
 
On July 27, 2023, Plaintiff posted bond in the amount of
$50,000 with the Clerk of this Court pursuant to the Court’s Order on July 25,
2023. This bond assured payment of reasonable attorney’s fees and costs
incurred in this action. 
 
Accordingly, the Clerk of this Court will release $36,612 in
attorney’s fees and $3,805 in costs to Defendants from the proceeds of the July
27, 2023, bond.
