And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by defendants Elliot Tishbi and Jefferson Esquerra to the first and second causes of action in a fraud action brought by plaintiff Seung Jae Baek. The demurrer is based on the original complaint, which was filed on December 29, 2023. However, before the opposition was due, plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint (FAC) on July 23, 2024. As a result, the original complaint is no longer the operative pleading, and the demurrer is moot. The judge is requiring the moving party to give notice of this ruling.
