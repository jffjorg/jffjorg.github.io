The Judge's tentative ruling grants the Plaintiff's motion to vacate the dismissal of the case and place it back on the calendar. The Plaintiff, Hector Mora, alleged premises liability against the Defendants, Los Angeles Unified School District, Los Angeles County Office of Education, County of Los Angeles, and City of Maywood. The Plaintiff's counsel, Igor Fradkin, inadvertently requested to dismiss the case, which was granted by the Court on February 12, 2024. The Judge finds that the mistake was excusable and that there is a strong public policy in favor of granting relief and allowing the Plaintiff his day in court. Therefore, the Judge grants the Plaintiff's motion to set aside the dismissal and places the matter back on the calendar.
