And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's motion to amend the judgment to add Avenatti & Associates, APC as an additional judgment debtor. The court finds that Avenatti & Associates, APC is an alter ego for the defendant and that an inequitable result would occur if the court denies the motion. The plaintiff provided evidence of a unity of interest and ownership between Avenatti & Associates, APC and the defendant, including commingling of funds and assets, failure to segregate funds, and the unauthorized diversion of corporate funds or assets to personal uses. The court also finds that the plaintiff has demonstrated that an inequitable result would occur if the court denies the motion, as the defendant has consistently evaded paying the judgment and the property at issue now is set to be abandoned. The court orders the plaintiff to provide a proposed amended judgment within 14 days of the order.
