Defendant’s counsel indicates they are not filing an opposition on behalf of AA
because they only represent Mr. Avenatti individually. The court is not
persuaded by any of these assertions. First, Defendant’s counsel indicates they
could not confer with their client because he is incarcerated at Terminal
Island and has “limited access to phone privileges, email, documents and mail .
. . .” (Limited Opp. 1:4-5, 20-22.) Counsel has not indicated an inability to
meet with their client in person. Second, Mr. Avenatti is the Agent of AA and
appears on all proofs of service filed with this court. (Amended Request for
Judicial Notice, Exhibit 1.) Defendant did not dispute this. Plaintiff also
includes a paralegal’s email who is involved with Mr. Avenatti’s criminal
trials. Defendant did not dispute this either. Third, Plaintiff served notice
to Defendant’s counsel of the ex parte application to advance the hearing on
the instant motion via email. Defendant’s counsel did not appear at the
hearing. (August 20, 2024 Minute Order.) Plaintiff subsequently served notice
of the ruling on all parties via U.S. Mail and e-mail. (August 21, 2024 Notice
of Ruling.) Defendant had seven days to prepare a  “robust” opposition.
