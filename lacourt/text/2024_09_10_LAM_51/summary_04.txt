And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge notes that Defendant's counsel claims they are not filing an opposition on behalf of AA because they only represent Mr. Avenatti individually, and that Mr. Avenatti is incarcerated at Terminal Island with limited access to phone and email. However, the judge is not persuaded by these claims. The judge points out that Defendant's counsel has not indicated an inability to meet with their client in person, and that Mr. Avenatti is the Agent of AA and appears on all proofs of service filed with the court. The judge also notes that Plaintiff served notice of the ex parte application and hearing on Defendant's counsel, and that Defendant did not appear at the hearing. The judge concludes that Defendant had seven days to prepare a "robust" opposition, but did not do so.
