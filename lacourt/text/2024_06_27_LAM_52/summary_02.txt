And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer and motion to strike filed by the defendants, New York Life Insurance, New York Life, and New York Life Group Benefits Solutions. The defendants demurred to the first, third, eighth, and ninth causes of action alleged by the plaintiff, Gayane Mkrtchyan, in her third amended complaint.

The judge sustained the demurrer to the eighth cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress without leave to amend, as the plaintiff failed to meet her burden of showing how she could cure the defect in her complaint.

The judge overruled the demurrer to the first, third, and ninth causes of action, finding that the plaintiff had adequately alleged that NY Life discriminated against her based on her disability and retaliated against her for exercising her rights.

The judge also denied the defendants' motion to strike portions of the second amended complaint regarding punitive damages, finding that the plaintiff had adequately alleged sufficient facts to support a claim for punitive damages.

Finally, the judge ordered the defendants to answer the third amended complaint within 20 days.
