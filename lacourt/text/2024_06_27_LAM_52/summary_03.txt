And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the defendants' ex parte application to advance the hearing on their motion to reopen discovery is granted. The hearing is advanced from August 2, 2024, to June 27, 2024. However, the judge does not find good cause to reopen discovery. The defendants are seeking to depose Thomas Reichmann, an inspector for the Los Angeles Housing Department, but fail to show that his testimony is necessary or relevant to their potential liability under Civil Code section 1942.4. The judge also notes that the defendants do not show diligence in deposing Reichmann, as they knew of his opinion and could have sought it at any time. Furthermore, permitting this discovery is unlikely to prevent the trial from going forward as scheduled on July 23. As a result, the court denies the defendants' motion to reopen discovery.
