  Case Number:  23STCV14994    Hearing Date:   June 27, 2024    Dept:  52 Order to Show Cause Re: Default
Judgment
Plaintiff Deborah Justice requests court judgment by default
against defendant Allyson Maren Carey. 
Plaintiff’s application for default judgment has three defects.  
First,
plaintiff did not request dismissal of defendants Does 1-5.  A request for default judgment must
include “[a] dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought
or an application for separate judgment against specified parties under Code of
Civil Procedure section 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each
judgment.”  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1800(a)(7).)  Plaintiff does not seek
default judgment against the Doe defendants. 
They therefore must be dismissed. 

Second, plaintiff did not submit “[a] proposed form of
judgment.”  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1800(a)(6).)  Plaintiff must submit a
proposed judgment on Judicial Council Form JUD-100.  
Third, plaintiff seeks excessive attorney fees of
$8,538.50.  A prevailing party can only
recover attorney fees when authorized by contract, statute, or law.  (CCP § 1033.5(a)(10).)  Plaintiff relies on the parties’ written
lease agreement.  (Comp., Ex. A.)  It provides, “In any action or proceeding
arising out of this Agreement, the prevailing party between Landlord and Tenant
shall be entitled to reasonable attorney fees and costs, collectively not to
exceed $1,000 (or $500__), except as provided in paragraph
35A.”  (Id., p. 6, ¶ 36.)  Paragraph 35.A only provides an exception
under which someone “shall not be entitled to recover attorney fees.”  (Id., p. 6, ¶ 35.A.)  Plaintiff therefore cannot recover more than
$500 in attorney fees under this contract.
The order to show cause re: default
judgment is hereby continued to August 2, 2024, at 8:30 a.m.
