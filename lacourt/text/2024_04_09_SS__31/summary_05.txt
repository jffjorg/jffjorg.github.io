And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling denies KB Home's motion to specially set the hearing date for its motion for summary judgment (MSJ) and grants a trial continuance. The court finds that KB Home's request for a continuance is reasonable, as it filed its MSJ early and there is no opposition to the motion. The court also notes that the Personal Injury courts do not have the capacity to add hearings to their fully booked motion calendars. As a result, the court will continue the trial date to accommodate KB Home's MSJ.
