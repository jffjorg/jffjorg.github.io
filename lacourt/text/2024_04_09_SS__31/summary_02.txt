The motion was filed due to an irreparable breakdown in the attorney-client relationship. However, the court has found that the motion was not properly served on the defendant, and therefore, Counsel must provide proof of service demonstrating service has been made on the defendant. If proof of service is not provided, the motion will be denied without prejudice. The parties are encouraged to meet and confer to reach an agreement, and if a party intends to submit on the tentative ruling, they must send an email to the court with the case number and other required information.
