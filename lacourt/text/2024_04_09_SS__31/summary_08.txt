The Judge's tentative ruling grants the defendant's unopposed motion to compel the plaintiff to respond to discovery requests. The defendant served the discovery requests on December 18, 2023, and the plaintiff failed to respond. The defendant sent email correspondence requesting responses on or before January 31, 2024, but the plaintiff still failed to respond. The court finds that the plaintiff waived any objections they may have had to the discovery requests by failing to respond in a timely manner. The court awards sanctions in the amount of $1,020 against the plaintiff and their counsel. The court also awards the defendant one hour for the motion and one hour to appear at the hearing at the requested rate of $240 per hour, as well as one motion filing fee of $60 as costs. The court orders the plaintiff and/or their counsel to pay the sanctions within twenty days.
