And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has decided to decline the petition to approve the compromise of a pending action of a minor. The reason for this decision is that the minor, Bushra El Habbal, is now 18 years old and no longer a minor. As a result, the court does not have jurisdiction to review the petition. The court excuses the personal appearance of the claimant and the guardian ad litem, and counsel may appear by telephone or video conference call. The court also orders the moving party to give notice of the court's decision.
