 Case Number:  21STCV46301    Hearing Date:   April 9, 2024    Dept:  31 DEPT:  31 HEARING DATE: 04/09/2024 CASE NAME/NUMBER: 21STCV46301 TALEB MOHAMAD EL HABBAL, et al. vs JACKSON DOYLE, et al. PETITION TO APPROVE COMPROMISE OF PENDING ACTION OF A MINOR Bushra El Habbal, Age 18 RECOMMENDATION: Decline.   TENTATIVE¿ ¿ The Court excuses the personal appearance of Claimant and the guardian ad litem. Counsel may appear by telephone or video conference call.¿  Court approval is required for all settlements of a minor’s claim. (Prob. Code §§ 3500, 3600, et seq.; CCP § 372.) A minor is a person under the age of 18. However, as of December 5, 2023, Claimant Bushra El Habbal reached the age of 18. Because Claimant is no longer a minor, and this petition is not brought on the grounds that Claimant is an adult person with a disability, there is no basis necessitating this Court’s review.   The Court declines to rule on the petition.  Moving party is ordered to give notice.
