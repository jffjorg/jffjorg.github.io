The court has granted State Farm's motion for leave to intervene in this case. State Farm, the automobile insurer for defendant Christian Jonathan Mejia, seeks to intervene in the case to protect its interests. The court finds that State Farm has a sufficient interest in the case to protect its potential liability under Insurance Code ยง 11580. The court concludes that State Farm's intervention will not enlarge the issues in the litigation and will not interfere with the rights of the original parties to the action. The court orders State Farm to file a separate copy of its complaint-in-intervention and serve it on all parties within 10 days.
