And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling addresses a motion for instructions regarding the preliminary distribution of sale proceeds in a case involving Leonard B. Weinsaft (Plaintiff) and Ami Deckel (Defendant). The Plaintiff, who was a 50% owner of the subject property, wants to conduct an IRC Section 1031 exchange to avoid a large capital gains tax payment. The Referee, Kevin Singer, moves for an order approving the distribution of 50% of the sale proceeds to the Plaintiff. However, the Defendant argues that the request is premature and unsupported by evidence. The Court agrees that the request is not adequately supported and orders the Referee to file and serve a preliminary accounting, and the Defendant to file and serve a response to the accounting. The motion is continued to December 18, 2023, at 9:00 am.
