Referee Kevin Singer moves for an order
approving the distribution of 50% of the proceeds from the sale of the subject
property to Plaintiff. Singer asserts that the Court should allow this
distribution before the referee’s final accounting because Plaintiff was a 50%
owner of the property and Plaintiff wishes to conduct an
IRC Section 1031 exchange, to avoid a large capital gains tax payment. The 1031
exchange must be conducted before January 24, 2024 (180 days after close of
escrow). Singer represents that the costs of sale, as well as other fees and
costs incurred due to Defendant’s family’s actions, will show that Plaintiff is
entitled to significantly more than half of the sale proceeds in this matter.
 
In opposition, Defendant argues that this request is premature and
unsupported by evidence. The Court agrees that the request is not adequately
supported. Singer provides no evidence showing even a rough estimate of costs
and fees, let alone anything resembling an accounting. The Court will not
distribute funds based on Singer’s “confidence” that Plaintiff ultimately will be
entitled to more than 50% of the sale proceeds. The Court will allow Singer to
present supplemental evidence to support the distribution. 
 
The motion is CONTINUED to December 18, 2023 at 9:00am. Singer shall
file and serve a preliminary accounting, no more than 5 pages, no later than 12:00
pm on December 12, 2023. Defendant to file and serve a response to the
accounting, no more than 5 pages, no later than 12:00 pm on December 15, 2023.
