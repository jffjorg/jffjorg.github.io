ANALYSIS
“Any party may
obtain discovery . . . by a written request that any other party to the action
admit the genuineness of specified documents, or the truth of specified matters
of fact, opinion relating to fact, or application of law to fact. A request for
admission may relate to a matter that is in controversy between the parties.”
(CCP § 2033.010.)¿ “Within 30 days after service of requests for admission, the
party to whom the requests are directed shall serve the original of the
response to them on the requesting party, and a copy of the response on all
other parties who have appeared…” (CCP § 2033.250(a).)¿¿ 
¿¿ 
If a party to
whom requests for admissions are served fails to provide a timely response, the
party to whom the request was directed waives any objections, including based
on privilege or the work product doctrine. (CCP § 2033.280(a).) The requesting
party can move for an order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth
of any matters specified in the request be deemed admitted, as well as for
monetary sanctions. (CCP § 2033.280(b).) The court shall issue this order
unless the party to whom the request was made serves a response in substantial
compliance prior to the hearing on the motion. (CCP § 2033.280(c).)¿ 
 
Plaintiff did
not serve responses to Defendant’s requests for admissions before the deadline.
Based on the information available to the Court, it does not appear that
Plaintiff has ever served responses to the requests for admissions.  
 
Defendant’s
motion to deem requests for admissions admitted is granted.
