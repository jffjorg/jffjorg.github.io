And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, Los Angeles Unified School District, has requested a stay of proceedings pending the resolution of two writ proceedings in the Court of Appeals concerning the constitutionality of AB 218. The court has denied the request, finding that staying the entire action would not be in the interest of judicial economy. The court has also granted the request for judicial notice of various court filings and court orders in the West Contra Costa USD v. Superior Court and Roe #2 v. Superior Court actions. The court has concluded that the interests of judicial economy are best served by going forward with the litigation, and that the defendant's ability to engage in meaningful settlement negotiations is not significantly impacted by the pending writ proceedings.
