BACKGROUND
 
On March, 7, 2024, Plaintiff Michael
Pinson filed a first amended complaint against Defendant LoanDEPOT.com, LLC for
1. Breach of Contract; 2. Breach of the
Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing; 2. Violations of California Civil Code
Section 2923.7; 3. Violations of California Civil Code Section 2924.11; and 4.
Violation of Cal. Business & Professions Code section 17200, et seq. 
 
Plaintiff alleges in November 2019, Plaintiff
obtained a first-position refinance mortgage from Defendant Loan Depot in the
amount of $386,000.00. Loan Depot was also servicer of the loan. Plaintiff
alleges they elected to execute a COVID-19 forbearance agreement with Loan
Depot and stopped making payments as a result. Upon the forbearance expiring,
Plaintiff alleges he entered into a 3-month trial payment plan (“TPP 1”), which
would then convert into a loan modification upon successful completion.
Plaintiff contends Loan Depot then neglected to transfer over the paperwork
authorizing automatic withdrawal and as a result, Loan Depot did not withdraw
the payments from Plaintiff’s account and payments were therefore not made on
time and Loan Depot revoked TPP 1. After months and months of trying to resolve
the issue, Loan Depot marched towards foreclosure and recorded a Notice of
Trustee’s Sale setting the property for auction on December 14, 2023. 
 
[Tentative] Ruling
 
Defendant
loanDepot.com’s Motion to Dissolve Preliminary Injunction is GRANTED. 
 
ANALYSIS
 
Defendant loanDepot moves the court for
an order dissolving the preliminary injunction issued by this court on June 7,
2024 on the grounds that Plaintiff Pinson has failed to comply with the
conditions for the preliminary injunction by failing to post a bond in the sum
of $117,373.27 and failing to make the monthly impounded escrow payments of
$501.30. 
 
“In any action, the court may on notice
modify or dissolve an injunction or temporary restraining order upon a showing
that there has been a material change in the facts upon which the injunction or
temporary restraining order was granted, that the law upon which the injunction
or temporary restraining order was granted has changed, or that the ends of
justice would be served by the modification or dissolution of the injunction or
temporary restraining order.”  (CCP §533.)
 
Defendant argues on June 7, 2024, this court
issued a preliminary injunction enjoining Defendant from further non-judicial
foreclosure proceedings against the real property located at 21551 Burbank
Blvd, #99, Woodland Hills, California 91367 (the “Property”). On June 11, 2024,
Defendant filed a declaration as to the amount of the bond for the preliminary
injunction, which was the current amount due of $117,373.27. At the Case
Management Conference on July 18, 2024, the court ordered the bond amount to be
$117,373.27 and for it to be posted within 20 days by the Plaintiff. The court
further ordered that the preliminary injunction was to stay active as long as
the bond is posted. 
 
Based on the foregoing, the court
agrees the preliminary injunction shall be dissolved. Plaintiff’s deadline to
post the bond was August 7, 2024. Yet no bond has been posted. (Thomason Decl.
¶8.) As noted by Defendant, case law indicates that “[i]t is very clear from
the authorities that a preliminary injunction does not become operative until a
bond is furnished, and that such a bond is expressly required.” (Griffin v.
Lima (1954) 124 Cal. App. 2d 697, 699.) Moreover, “[i]f the court
determines that the applicant's undertaking is insufficient and a sufficient
undertaking is not filed within the time required by the statute, the order
granting the injunction must be dissolved.” (CCP § 529(a).) Because the court
must require an undertaking upon granting an injunction, the June 7, 2024 order
granting the injunction must be dissolved. 

 
The motion is unopposed.
Accordingly, Defendant loanDepot.com’s
Motion to Dissolve Preliminary Injunction is GRANTED.
