The Judge, Theresa M. Traber, issued a tentative ruling on April 15, 2024, in the case of Melton L. Mitchell et al. v. Ford Motor Company, et al. (Case No. 23STCV17259). The case involves a lemon law action filed by Plaintiffs Melton L. Mitchell and Stacey Mitchell, alleging that defendants Ford Motor Company and Santa Monica Ford Lincoln concealed material facts about the defective transmission system of their 2020 Ford Explorer. The Judge overruled the defendants' demurrer to the fifth cause of action for fraudulent concealment and the sixth cause of action for negligent repair. The Judge found that the Plaintiffs adequately alleged specific facts and proved a duty to disclose material facts. The Judge also held that the economic loss rule does not bar the Plaintiffs' fraud cause of action.
