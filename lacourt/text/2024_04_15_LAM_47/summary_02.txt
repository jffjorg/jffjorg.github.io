And here is the English text summary of the Tentative Ruling:

The plaintiff, Mohamad Mehdi Molaei, has filed a lemon law action against American Honda Motor Co., Inc. for a 2020 Honda Odyssey with defects in core systems. The plaintiff moves to compel further responses to requests for production, claiming that the defendant has not provided sufficient information. The court finds that the plaintiff has satisfied the requirements for a motion to compel further responses and that good cause exists for the requests. The court also finds that the defendant's objections to the requests are without merit. The court grants the plaintiff's motion and orders the defendant to produce verified, code-compliant responses without objections to the requests within 30 days of this order.
