Summary:
The tentative ruling is a summary of a court hearing on April 15, 2024, in a case involving sexual harassment and assault by coworkers. The plaintiff, Irma Leticia Mejia, alleges that she was sexually harassed and assaulted by her coworkers at Cameo Hotel Inc and Valley Active Properties, LLC. The defendants demur to the first, second, and sixth causes of action, arguing that the plaintiff's claims are barred by the worker's compensation exclusivity rule. The court finds that the plaintiff's claims are not barred by the exclusivity rule and that the defendants are vicariously liable for the alleged harassment. The court also finds that the plaintiff's claims for punitive damages are sufficient at the pleading stage. The defendants' motion to strike portions of the plaintiff's complaint is denied.
