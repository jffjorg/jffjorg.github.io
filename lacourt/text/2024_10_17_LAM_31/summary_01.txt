And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for reconsideration filed by Plaintiff Jeff Baoliang Zhang, Ph.D. The Plaintiff seeks to reconsider previous court orders, including the denial of his motion for reconsideration of the judgment entered on February 15, 2024. However, the Court finds that the Plaintiff's motion is untimely and lacks sufficient grounds for reconsideration. The Court notes that the Plaintiff had previously filed a motion for reconsideration of the February 15, 2024 order, which was denied on May 2, 2024. The Court also finds that the Plaintiff's basis for relief is not explained and does not identify any new or different facts, circumstances, or law that would support reconsideration. Therefore, the Court denies the motion for reconsideration.
