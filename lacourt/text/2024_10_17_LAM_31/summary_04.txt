And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer and motion to strike filed by KKW Trucking, Inc. in the case of Henry Bell v. KKW Trucking, Inc.

The court sustains the demurrer to the second and third causes of action, which alleged disability discrimination and failure to engage in a good faith interactive process. The court finds that Henry Bell was provided with a medical leave of absence as a reasonable accommodation and that he was later cleared to return to work without restrictions. As a result, the court concludes that KKW Trucking, Inc. did not violate the Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA).

The court also grants the motion to strike punitive damages allegations from the complaint. The court finds that the allegations are conclusory and unsupported by specific facts. Henry Bell's allegations of malice and oppression are insufficient to support a claim for punitive damages.

The court denies leave to amend the complaint without prejudice. Henry Bell may seek leave to amend the complaint if additional facts are learned during discovery.

The court will issue a final ruling on the demurrer and motion to strike after considering any oppositions or replies.
