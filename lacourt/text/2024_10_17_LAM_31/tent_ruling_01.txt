MOVING PARTY:               Plaintiff Jeff Baoliang Zhang,
Ph.D. 
 
RESPONDING
PARTY:     Defendants
City of Los Angeles, et al.
 
 
I.          BACKGROUND
 
             On July 28, 2021, Plaintiff, Jeff Baoliang
Zhang, Ph.D., who is self-represented, filed this action against the City of
Los Angeles (sued as the “Los Angeles Police Department”).  
 
            On January
5, 2023, Zhang filed the operative First Amended Complaint (“FAC”).¿ The FAC
alleges causes of action for (1) Willful Perjuries, the Serious Violation of
the Federal Laws; (2) Violation of the United States Constitution; and (3)
Theft and Robbery of Plaintiff’s Property, Willful Perjuries, the Serious
Violation of the Federal Laws.¿ The FAC also adds Kenneth Bryant (“Bryant”),
Jesse Hinchman (“Hinchman”), Albert Delarocha (“Delarocha”), Charlie Beck
(“Beck”), Michel Moore (“Moore”), and Ibanks as defendants.¿¿¿ 
¿ 
On February 9, 2023, the City, Hinchman, Moore, and Bryant
filed a demurrer.¿ On August 11, 2023, the court sustained the demurrer to the
FAC, without leave to amend.¿¿¿ 
¿ 
On October 26, 2023, the court denied Plaintiff’s motion for
reconsideration but, on its own motion, reconsidered and overruled the August
11, 2023 ruling as to the Second Cause of Action only.  
 
 On January 19, 2024, the City, Hinchman, Moore, and
Bryant filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings as to the Second Cause of
Action.¿ The court heard oral argument on February 14, 2024 and took the matter
under submission.  On February 15, 2024, the court issued its order
granting the motion.  On the same day, the court entered judgment in favor
of the City, Hinchman, Moore, and Bryant and against Plaintiff. 
 On February 16, 2024, the court scheduled two
hearings: (1) Order to Show Cause Re: Dismissal As To Why This Case Should Not
Be Dismissed As To Unserved Defendants Albert Dalarocha and Ibankz; and (2)
Order to Show Cause Re: Dismissal As To Why This Case Should Not Be Dismissed
For Failure to Request Entry of Default As to Defendant Charlie Beck. 
After a continuance, the OSCs were scheduled for August 14, 2024. 
 
On August 7, 2024, the City, Hinchman, Moore, and Bryant
(hereafter, Defendants) filed a Status Report regarding proof of service of
summons and complaint as to Delarocha, Beck, and Ibankz. 
 
On August 9, 2024, Plaintiff filed a response titled,
“Defendant’s New Lies.”  
 
The OSCs were heard on August 14, 2024.  After oral
argument, the court took the matter under submission.  
 
On August 26, 2024, the court found that it did not have discretion
to dismiss defendants Beck, Delarocha, and Ibankz.  The clerk of the court served Plaintiff with
notice of the court’s ruling on the same day.
 
On September 5, 2024, Plaintiff filed a document titled “Motion
for Reconsideration: A Trial is Absolutely Necessary for This Case Filled with
Federal Civil Rights Violations”.
 
II.        DISCUSSION
& LEGAL STANDARD
 
            The basis of Plaintiff’s motion for reconsideration is
difficult to discern.  As best the court
can tell, Plaintiff challenges the court’s previous rulings, including but not
limited to orders issued on August 11, 2023 and February 15, 2024.  The time to file motions for reconsideration
of these orders has long passed.   
 
“When an application for an order has been made to a judge,
or to a court, and refused in whole or in part, or granted, or granted
conditionally, or on terms, any party affected by the order may, within 10 days
after service upon the party of written notice of entry of the order and based
upon new or different facts, circumstances, or law, make application to the
same judge or court that made the order, to reconsider the matter and modify,
amend, or revoke the prior order.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 1008, subd. (a).)¿ 
 
The court further notes that Plaintiff did, in fact, file a
motion for reconsideration of the court’s February 15, 2024 order.  The court heard that motion and issued an
order denying reconsideration on May 2, 2024. 
There is no occasion to revisit that order.
 
To the extent Plaintiff seeks reconsideration of the court’s
August 26, 2024, order, Plaintiff’s basis for relief is not sufficiently
explained.  Plaintiff does not identify
which portions of the August 26 order require reconsideration let alone
identify any new or different facts, circumstances, or law that would support
reconsideration.  
 
 
  
III.       CONCLUSION 
 
            Accordingly, the motion for reconsideration is DENIED.
 
            The clerk
of the court to give notice.
 
 
Dated:   October 17, 2024
