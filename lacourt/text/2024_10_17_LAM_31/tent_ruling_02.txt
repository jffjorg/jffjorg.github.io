MOTION
TO SET ASIDE ENTRY OF DEFAULT


 
MOVING PARTY:               Defendant
Specialty Mattress, Inc.
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     No opposition
 
 
I.          BACKGROUND
 
            On January
3, 2024, plaintiffs Matilde Chen, Merlyn Julieta Chen, and Jesus Alberto Lopez
Sandoval (collectively, Plaintiffs) commenced this FEHA employment action against
their employers, defendants Partners Personnel Management Services, LLC
(Partners) and Specialty Mattress, Inc. (Specialty). 
 
            On January
30, 2024, Plaintiffs served Specialty with the summons and complaint by
substituted service.  Specialty did not
answer the complaint.
 
On April 10, 2024, default was entered against Specialty.
 
            On June 28,
2024, Specialty filed this Motion to Set Aside Entry of Default. 
 
On October 8, 2024, Specialty filed a Notice of
Non-Opposition.  
 
II.        LEGAL STANDARD 
 
Code of Civil Procedure section
473, subdivision (b) provides that a court may “relieve a party or his or her
legal representative from a judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding
taken against him or her through his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or
excusable neglect.”  In addition, a court must vacate a default or
dismissal when a motion for relief under Section 473, subdivision (b) is filed
timely and accompanied by an attorney’s sworn affidavit attesting to the
attorney’s mistake, inadvertence, surprise or neglect “unless the court finds
that the default or dismissal was not in fact caused by the attorney’s mistake,
inadvertence, surprise or neglect.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd.
(b).)   
 
The party or the legal
representative must seek such relief “within a reasonable time, in no case
exceeding six months, after the judgment, dismissal, order, or proceeding was
taken.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b); see Rappleyea v. Campbell
(1994) 8 Cal.4th 975, 980 [“because more than six months had elapsed from the
entry of default, and hence relief under section 473 was unavailable”]; People
v. The North River Ins. Co. (2011) 200 Cal.App.4th 712, 721 [motion for
relief under section 473 must be brought “within a reasonable time, in no case
exceeding six months”].)   
 
III.      DISCUSSION
 
Specialty seeks to vacate the entry of default on the
grounds of mistake, surprise, or excusable neglect.  Specifically, Specialty manager Ana Marie
Serrano-Lopez inquired from co-defendant Partners about whether Partners would
be providing an attorney to defend Specialty in this matter.  On March 11, 2024, Partners finally informed
Specialty that it would not be providing counsel for Specialty.  (Serrano-Lopez Decl., ¶¶ 4-7.)  Specialty obtained counsel as soon thereafter,
in April 2024, because of financial issues. 
(Id., ¶ 10.)  A copy
of Specialty’s proposed answer is attached to Ms. Serrano-Lopez’s amended
declaration.  For these reasons, Specialty
argues it is entitled to relief.  
 
A court may vacate a default or
dismissal when a motion for relief under Section 473, subdivision (b) is filed
timely and accompanied by the party’s sworn affidavit attesting to the party’s
mistake, inadvertence, surprise or neglect.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 473,
subd. (b).)   
 
The court finds that Specialty is
entitled to relief.  The motion was
timely filed and is supported by the proposed pleading to be filed.  There is no opposition filed directing a
different result. 
 
IV.       CONCLUSION 
 
The unopposed motion to set aside entry of default is GRANTED.
 The default entered against Defendant
Specialty Mattress, Inc. on April 10, 2024 is VACATED.  Defendant’s proposed answer is deemed filed
as of this date.  
 
Defendant to give notice.
 
Dated:   October 17,
2024
