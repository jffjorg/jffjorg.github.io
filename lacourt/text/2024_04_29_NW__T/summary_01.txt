And here is a text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the plaintiff's motion to compel and the defendant's request for a Guardian Ad Litem (GAL). The judge finds that the plaintiff's motion is incomplete, as it combines two separate motions into one. The judge requires a separate fee to be paid for the second motion by the time of the hearing. Additionally, the judge is concerned about the defendant's ability to participate in the case, as he is in a "grave" medical condition and may be "on his way out". The judge requires medical evidence of the defendant's condition and need for a GAL before proceeding with the trial. The judge also notes that the case will not continue until this evidence is submitted.
