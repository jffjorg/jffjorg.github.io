  Case Number:  23VECV01249    Hearing Date:   April 29, 2024    Dept:  T 23VECV01249 Volchanov v. ArellanoTentative ruling: Plaintiff’s motions to compelMoving party has impermissibly combined two motions into one.  This is not allowed under the Rules of Court.  If a separate fee for the second motion is paid by the time of the hearing, the court will consider the second motion.The bigger picture has to do with the trial and FSC and not only the discovery motion.  If the defendant is in “grave” medical condition and is “on his way out”, does this mean he is unable to participate in the case and may need a GAL? The court is unwilling to continue the trial until some medical evidence of defendant’s condition and need for a GAL is submitted.  If the defendant’s wife is to be GAL and the case is to be continued, there will still need to be some medical evidence of his condition.
