And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has decided to continue the hearing for the preliminary injunction to provide Move Central Inc. with additional time to file an opposition. This is because the plaintiff, Lady JGerard, did not comply with the proper service requirement, as specified in California Code of Civil Procedure ยง1005. Lady JGerard is required to provide proof of service of the ex parte papers from February 29, 2024. If proof of service is not filed, the court will vacate the temporary restraining order (TRO) nunc pro tunc. Additionally, the court has requested that Lady JGerard provide proof of service of the ex parte papers, which were served on March 14, 2024. The court is concerned that the ex parte TRO may have been granted improperly if the proof of service is not filed.
