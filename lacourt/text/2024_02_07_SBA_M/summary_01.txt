- "There is no showing that moving Defendant acted in bad faith in making this motion."

```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion for leave to file a cross-complaint, which seeks to invalidate a foreign money judgment obtained by the plaintiff in Singapore. The defendant's motion was granted because the proposed causes of action arise out of the same transaction, occurrence, or series of transactions or occurrences as the plaintiff's petition, and the granting of leave to file the cross-complaint is mandatory pursuant to CCP § 426.10. The judge also found that the defendant did not act in bad faith in making the motion and that granting the motion will not cause the plaintiff substantial prejudice and injustice. The defendant is directed to file and serve the proposed cross-complaint within five days of the date of the ruling.
