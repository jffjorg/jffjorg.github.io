declaration.
 
Defendants
Casa Bonita Convalescent Hospital, LLC and Casa Bonita Convalescent Hospital,
Inc. move to compel arbitration on the complaint of plaintiff Elizabeth Graham,
and a stay of the case. Defendants move to compel arbitration based on the
arbitration provision in the “Arbitration Agreement.” Defendants maintain all
claims are subject to arbitration under the terms of the agreement. Plaintiff
in opposition challenge enforcement of the agreement on grounds within the
language of the agreement, as well as legal bars. Defendants in reply maintains
the existence of the executed arbitration agreement and enforceability.
Defendant denies the unconscionability arguments as well, and otherwise
maintains the ability to sever any offending sections.
 
“A written
agreement to submit to arbitration an existing controversy or a controversy
thereafter arising is valid, enforceable and irrevocable, save upon such grounds
as exist for the revocation of any contract.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1281.) “On
petition of a party to an arbitration agreement alleging the existence of a
written agreement to arbitrate a controversy and that a party thereto refuses
to arbitrate such controversy, the court shall order the petitioner and the
respondent to arbitrate the controversy if it determines that an agreement to
arbitrate the controversy exists, unless it determines that: (a) The right to
compel arbitration has been waived by the petitioner; or (b) Grounds exist for
the revocation of the agreement.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1281.2.)
 
The agreement itself requires arbitration for any
claims arising from employment and subject to state, federal or local law,
including contract and tort claims. While the FAA governs the rules for
conducting arbitration, barring citation to a case precluding California law,
motions to compel arbitration are still governed by California law. (Adolph
v. Uber Technologies, Inc. (2023) 14 Cal.5th 1104, 1119; Viking River Cruises, Inc. v.
Moriana (2022) 142 S.Ct. 1906; Volt Information Sciences, Inc. v. Board of Trustees of Leland
Stanford Junior University (1989) 489 U.S. 468, 477–479; Victrola 89, LLC v. Jaman
Properties 8 LLC (2020) 46 Cal.App.5th 337, 346.) 
 
The
law creates a general presumption in favor of arbitration. In a motion to compel arbitration, the moving party must prove by a
preponderance of evidence the existence of the arbitration agreement and that
the dispute is covered by the agreement. “‘Under “both
federal and state law, the threshold question presented by a petition to compel
arbitration is whether there is an agreement to arbitrate.”’” (Long v. Provide Commerce, Inc. (2016) 245 Cal.App.4th
855, 861.) “Private arbitration is a matter of
agreement between the parties and is governed by contract law. (Platt Pacific, Inc. v. Andelson (1993)
6 Cal.4th 307, 313.) In a motion to compel arbitration, the moving party must prove by a
preponderance of evidence the existence of the arbitration agreement and that
the dispute is covered by the agreement. The burden then shifts to the
resisting party to prove by a preponderance of evidence a ground for denial
(e.g., fraud, unconscionability, etc.). (Rosenthal v. Great Western Fin'l
Securities Corp. (1996) 14 Cal.4th 394, 413-414; Gamboa v. Northeast Community Clinic (2021)
72 Cal.App.5th 158, 164–165; Hotels
Nevada v. L.A. Pacific Ctr., Inc. (2006)
144 Cal.App.4th 754, 758.) Any challenges to the formation
of the arbitration agreement should be considered before any order sending the
parties to arbitration. The trier of fact weighs
all evidence, including affidavits, declarations, documents, and, if
applicable, oral testimony to determine whether the action goes to arbitration.
(Hotels Nevada v. L.A. Pacific Ctr., Inc., supra, 144 Cal.App.4th at
p. 758.)
 
The court interprets the
arbitration clause like any other contract, including determination of the
intent of the parties and ambiguities. (Gravillis v. Coldwell Banker Residential Brokerage Co. (2006) 143 Cal.App.4th 761, 772.) “‘A contract must be so interpreted
as to give effect to the mutual intention of the parties as it existed at
the time of contracting, so far as the same is ascertainable and lawful.’ (Civ.
Code, § 1636.) ‘The language of a contract is to govern its interpretation, if
the language is clear and explicit, and does not involve an absurdity.’ (Civ.
Code, § 1638.) ‘When a contract is reduced to writing, the intention of the
parties is to be ascertained from the writing alone, if possible; subject,
however, to the other provisions of this Title.” (Civ. Code, § 1639.) “The
whole of a contract is to be taken together, so as to give effect to every
part, if reasonably practicable, each clause helping to interpret the other.’
(Civ. Code, § 1641.) ‘A contract must receive such an interpretation as will
make it lawful, operative, definite, reasonable, and capable of being carried
into effect, if it can be done without violating the intention of the parties.’
(Civ. Code, § 1643.) ‘The words of a contract are to be understood in their
ordinary and popular sense, rather than according to their strict legal
meaning; unless used by the parties in a technical sense, or unless a special
meaning is given to them by usage, in which case the latter must be followed.’
(Civ. Code, § 1644.) ‘However broad may be the terms of a contract, it extends
only to those things concerning which it appears that the parties intended to
contract.’ (Civ. Code, § 1648.) ‘Repugnancy in a contract must be reconciled,
if possible, by such an interpretation as will give some effect to the
repugnant clauses, subordinate to the general intent and purpose of the whole
contract.’ (Civ. Code, § 1652.) ‘Stipulations which are necessary to make a
contract reasonable, or conformable to usage, are implied, in respect to
matters concerning which the contract manifests no contrary intention.’ (Civ.
Code, § 1655.)” (Siligo v.
Castellucci (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 873, 880–881.)
 
“A
contract term should not be construed to render some of its provisions
meaningless or irrelevant.” (Estate of
Petersen (1994) 28 Cal.App.4th 1742, 1754 (footnote 4).) “A
well-settled maxim states the general rule that ambiguities in a form contract
are resolved against the drafter. (Citations.) But that is a general rule; it
does not operate to the exclusion of all other rules of contract
interpretation. It is used when none of the canons of construction succeed in
dispelling the uncertainty.” (Oceanside
84, Ltd. v. Fidelity Federal Bank (1997) 56 Cal.App.4th 1441, 1448.)
 
The court finds an agreement was executed by
Graham with an entity identified as Casa Bonita. [Declaration of Richard
Escontrias, Ex. A.] Defendant represents the entity was Casa Bonita
Convalescent, Inc., which later changed to Casa Bonita Convalescent, LLC. The
court finds no dispute over the existence of entities or change in entity
status. The change in corporate form includes the retention of all assets and
liabilities, including the subject agreement. (See Corp. Code, § 1153, et seq.) 
 
The
court also finds the terms encapsulate all claims raised in the complaint.
Thus, the court finds a valid arbitration agreement between Graham and Casa
Bonita Convalescent Hospital, Inc.
 
The burden now shifts
to Plaintiff to challenge enforcement. The court considers the myriad arguments
under unconscionability presented in opposition. 
 
Unconscionability
claims have both a “‘procedural’” and “‘substantive’” element. (Stirlen v. Supercuts, Inc. (1997) 51
Cal.App.4th 1519, 1531.) “‘Procedural unconscionability’” concerns the manner
in which the contract was negotiated and the circumstances of the parties at
that time. (Kinney v. United HealthCare
Services, Inc. (1999) 70 Cal.App.4th 1322, 1329.) “‘The procedural
element focuses on two factors: “oppression” and “surprise.”  “Oppression” arises from an inequality of
bargaining power which results in no real negotiation and an absence of
meaningful choice. “Surprise” involves the extent to which the supposedly
agreed-upon terms of the bargain are hidden in the prolix printed form drafted
by the party seeking to enforce the disputed terms.’” (Stirlen v. Supercuts, Inc., supra, 51 Cal.App.4th at p. 1532.)
“Substantive unconscionability” involves contracts leading to “‘“overly
harsh”’” or “‘“one-sided”’” results.’” … “[U]nconscionability turns … on an
absence of ‘justification “for it…” [and therefore] must be evaluated as of the
time the contract was made.’” (Stirlen v. Supercuts, Inc. (1997) 51 Cal.App.4th
1519, 1532.)
 
In
the employment context, a mandatory arbitration agreement
is enforceable, if it “(1) provides for neutral arbitrators, (2) provides for
more than minimal discovery, (3) requires a written award, (4) provides for all
of the types of relief that would otherwise be available in court, and (5) does
not require employees to pay either unreasonable costs or any arbitrators’ fees
or expenses as a condition of access to the arbitration forum.” (Armendariz v. Foundation Health Psychcare
Services, Inc. (2000) 24 Cal.4th 83, 102.) Required execution of an
arbitration agreement as a condition of employment may constitute an
unconscionable provision, where the contract lacks mutuality and/or imposes a
disadvantage on the employee. (Armendariz
v. Foundation Health Psychcare Services, Inc., supra, 24 Cal.4th at pp.
114-118; Little v. Auto Stiegler, Inc. (2003)
29 Cal.4th 1064, 1071-1072.)
 
Plaintiff
relies on a description of the contract as one of adhesion, with a disadvantage
imposed on Plaintiff due to the inability to review the terms with an attorney
before signing the agreement. [Declaration of Elizabeth Graham.] The court
finds an insufficient basis of procedural unconscionability based on the argued
circumstances. (Gentry v. Superior Court (2007) 42 Cal.4th 443, 470-472
overruled in AT&T Mobility LLC v. Concepcion (2011) 563 U.S. 333,
341 [131 S.Ct. 1740, 1747, 179 L.Ed.2d 742].) 
 
The
court also finds the terms comply with all substantive unconscionable
standards, including limitations on discovery and arbitrator neutrality. Nothing
in the complaint otherwise indicates a PAGA claim, seeking any form of public
injunction, multiple cases pending under the “Bellwether Procedures” section,
or confidentiality clause challenges. The court also finds any potential
statute of limitations argument not part of any enforcement issue.
 
The
action is therefore ordered to arbitration in compliance with the terms of the
agreement. The parties may stipulate to an arbitrator with JAMS, but in case
they are unable to agree upon an arbitrator, the parties are directed to
contact JAMS for internal direction on the selection process. If the parties reach
an impasse on an arbitrator and JAMS rules otherwise preclude selection, the
parties may submit a list of one to two arbitrators from each side, where the
court will select the arbitrator. The parties have 30 days from the date of
this order to begin the selection process.
 
“If
a court of competent jurisdiction, whether in this State or not, has ordered
arbitration of a controversy which is an issue involved in an action or
proceeding pending before a court of this State, the court in which such action
or proceeding is pending shall, upon motion of a party to such action or
proceeding, stay the action or proceeding until an arbitration is had in
accordance with the order to arbitrate or until such earlier time as the court
specifies.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1281.4.) The court orders the action stayed. 
 
The
court will set an OSC re: Status of Arbitration and Stay at the time of the
hearing.
