And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has issued a tentative ruling denying the defendant's motion to quash the service of the summons and complaint. The defendant, Mark Geragos, claims that the service was invalid because it was not done at his business address, but rather at his residence. The plaintiff, Donald Erikson, argues that the service was valid because it was done in the presence of a person apparently in charge of the residence. The court found that the process server left the papers with Marcelina Reyes, who was identified as the person in charge, and that the motion lacked any specific argument denying any basis of authority for Reyes to accept service of process. The court also noted that the parties do not factually dispute the process server's actions. As a result, the court denied the motion and ordered the defendant to file a responsive pleading within 10 days.
