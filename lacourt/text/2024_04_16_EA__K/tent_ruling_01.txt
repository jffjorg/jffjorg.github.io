Discussion
Plaintiff’s Application for Default Judgment is denied without
prejudice. The following defects are noted:
1.                 
Plaintiff has provided a default prove-up application
via piecemeal submissions. The court will not consider any piecemeal
submissions going forward. Any future default prove-up application must be full
and complete. 
 
2.                 
Plaintiff previously attested that “[o]ther employees
that requested off even for the same day were regularly allowed to take them
off” and that “other workers asked to be placed on furlough due to COVID-19 and
could keep their positions and not work.” (Plaintiff’s Decl., ¶ 8.) Plaintiff
has not provided evidence supporting the above statements. 
 
3.                 
Plaintiff has attested that, in or around early July
2020, she asked her manager Roy for the day off on the fourth of July and that,
in response, Roy “became furious and accused [her] of refusing to work.” (Id.,
¶ 6). It appears, from this paragraph, that Plaintiff communicated to Roy that
she needed that day off because of childcare issues. It does not appear that
the issue of Plaintiff’s pregnancy came up during that time. There does not
appear to be anything in Plaintiff’s text communications with her manager,
moreover, that suggest that Plaintiff was being discriminated against on the
basis of her pregnancy.
 
4.                 
Plaintiff has now reduced the $950,000.00 originally
requested in general damages to $100,000.00; however, she continues to provide
scant support for same (see above). Further, Plaintiff’s request for
nearly $100,000.00 in general damages “for pain and suffering and the emotional
distress [she] endured and continue[s] to endure” (Plaintiff’s Decl., ¶ 17)
appears contradicted by Plaintiff’s purported “concession” of her sixteenth and
seventeenth causes of action “due to lack of evidence” (Gould Decl., ¶¶ 57 and
58.)
 
5.                 
Plaintiff has not provided an explanation for the
unspecified “administrative costs.” Plaintiff is to provide an itemization of
the $1,871.05 in clerk’s filing fees.
 
6.                 
Attorneys fees should be reduced in accordance with
Local Rule 3.214.
