And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has reviewed the motions filed by the parties and has made some changes to the previously scheduled dates for hearings. The Judge has continued the hearing on Motions #1-#3 to April 16, 2024, and has also continued the Final Status Conference to July 16, 2024, and the trial date to July 30, 2024. The Judge has also waived notice of these changes. The Judge notes that the Plaintiffs have changed their response to DUMF Nos. 28 and 29, but the Judge does not find these changes problematic as they narrow the parties' purported disagreements. The Judge acknowledges that the only real issue is BJ's ratification.
