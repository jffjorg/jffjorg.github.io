And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge denies the plaintiff's application for default judgment without prejudice. The plaintiff's application is defective due to piecemeal submissions, lack of evidence supporting certain claims, and insufficient support for damages. The plaintiff is required to provide a full and complete default prove-up application and to itemize the administrative costs. The plaintiff's request for damages is reduced due to lack of evidence. The judge also notes that the plaintiff's previous attestations are not supported by evidence.
