[2]              Plaintiffs have also changed their
response to DUMF Nos. 28 and 29 from “[d]isputed as misleading” to
“undisputed.” The court does not find these changes problematic as they narrow,
rather than enlarge, the parties’ purported disagreements.


[3]              See Complaint, ¶ 118 (i.e., “BJS
validated and approved the harassment if VICTORIA BERGERON, failing to address
the tortfeasor’s conduct and instead punishing VICTORIA BERGERON by changing
her shifts so she would see her son less often or be forced to quit.”
Additionally, Victoria acknowledges in opposition that “[t]he only real issue
is BJ’s ratification.” (Opp., 4:20). 


[4]              BJ’s points out in reply that night
shifts were often desirable shifts where one could generate more income.
(Plaintiff’s “Compendium of Evidence[, etc.]”, Exh. 2, 66:9-19).
