BACKGROUND           
            This
is a breach of contract case. On April 10, 2023, plaintiff McKesson Medical
Surgical, Inc. (Plaintiff) filed this action against defendant ‘Matias’
Clinical Laboratory, Inc., a California Corporation, dba Health Care Providers Laboratory
(Defendant) and Does 1 through 20, alleging causes of action for breach of
contract and common counts. On March 11, 2024, default was entered against
Defendant on Plaintiff’s motion for terminating sanctions. On August 12, 2024,
Plaintiff submitted a default judgment package, which the Court denied without
prejudice. On October 4, 2024, Plaintiff resubmitted a default judgment
package.           
LEGAL
STANDARD 
Code of
Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a party
has failed to timely respond or appear. (Code Civ. Proc., § 585.) A party
seeking judgment on the default by the court must file a Request for Court
Judgment, and: (1) a brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other
admissible evidence in support of the judgment requested; (3) interest
computations as necessary; (4) a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) declaration
of nonmilitary status; (6) a proposed form of judgment; (7) a dismissal of all
parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application for separate
judgment under Code of Civil Procedure section 579, supported by a showing of
grounds for each judgment; (8) exhibits as necessary; and (9) a request for
attorneys’ fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties. (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1800.) 
ANALYSIS 
Plaintiff
seeks default judgment against Defendants in the total amount of $144,170.23,
including $117,117.27 in damages, $23,457.79 in interest, $3,061.17 in attorney
fees, and $534.00 in costs. While Plaintiff addressed certain issues noted in
the Court’s prior rejection of the default judgment package, the declaration of Kenya Myers is not executed. (Myers Decl., p. 3;
Code Civ. Proc., § 2015.5.) As such, the copy of the contract and invoice
attached thereto are without foundation. (Myers Decl., Exs. A, B; Kim v.
Westmoore Partners, Inc., supra, 201 Cal.App.4th at p. 288.) The Court
disregards the copies attached to the declaration for Plaintiff’s counsel for
lack of personal knowledge. (Ibid.; Hettena Decl. re: In Support of
Entry of Default, ¶ 5, Exs. A, B.) 
CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s
request for entry of default judgment is DENIED without prejudice. Plaintiff must
resubmit the signed declaration of Kenya Myers before the hearing on November
19, 2024. If the Court accepts the resubmitted declaration, the Court will sign
the proposed judgment and this hearing will come off calendar.
