  Case Number:  19SMCV00543    Hearing Date:   January 25, 2024    Dept:  I The application for an order shortening time is
GRANTED.  The court will discuss a
briefing schedule with the parties.  But
that said, the court will inquire whether plaintiff intends to oppose the
motion to compel further and, if so, what the basis is for such an
opposition.  The court cannot see the
basis for any opposition, but of course, the court has not heard from plaintiff
on that subject.
