Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the motion to compel further responses is granted. The dispute is over responses to special interrogatories 9, 14, and 15, which seek information about plaintiff's liability on the cross-complaint and the use of housing assistance money. The judge finds that the plaintiff's responses were inadequate and that the defendant was entitled to supplemental responses. The judge orders the plaintiff to provide full, complete, and verified responses within 5 court days. The judge also imposes sanctions on the plaintiff in the amount of $1005, payable within 30 days. The judge notes that the defense counsel made repeated promises that were not kept and approved the inadequate answers and supplements.
