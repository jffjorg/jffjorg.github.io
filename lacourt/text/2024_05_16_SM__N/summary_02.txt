And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has made a tentative ruling in the case of Calvin Love vs. Royal Personal Training. The Judge denied Calvin Love's motion to compel in-person depositions of Camille Choido and Tori Choido, as the Defendant agreed to produce the witnesses for in-person deposition. The motion was denied as moot, and no sanctions were necessary. Additionally, the Judge denied Calvin Love's request for monetary sanctions, as the Defendant's conduct in seeking a remote deposition was warranted and would make the imposition of sanctions unjust. The parties are advised to resolve discovery disputes informally in the future or be subject to potential monetary sanctions.
