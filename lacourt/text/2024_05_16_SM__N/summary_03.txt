And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on Defendant Lennox Industries Inc.'s Motion to Admit Steven Rosenwasser Pro Hac Vice. The court has granted the motion, allowing Steven Rosenwasser to appear pro hac vice in this case. The court cited California Rules of Court, rule 9.40, which allows an attorney who is not a member of the California State Bar to appear pro hac vice in California courts if they meet certain conditions. Rosenwasser has met these conditions, including being a member in good standing of all bars and courts in which he is admitted to practice, and not having appeared in any other actions in California in the preceding two years. The court found that Rosenwasser is qualified and ready to appear pro hac vice and that his appearance in this action would not cause a significant disruption of orderly justice.
