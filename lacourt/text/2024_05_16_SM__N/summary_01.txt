And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the demurrer filed by Defendants Wayne Gretzky and Janet Gretzky to the First Amended Complaint is SUSTAINED, with 30 days' leave to amend. The judge has found that the Plaintiff's claims for fraud and negligent misrepresentation are insufficiently pleaded due to a lack of specific facts regarding the Defendants' alleged misrepresentations. The judge has granted the Defendants' request for judicial notice of certain court orders and has considered the Plaintiff's "Errata Plaintiff's First Amended Complaint" as if it were a Second Amended Complaint. The judge has given the Plaintiff an opportunity to amend the complaint to cure the defects identified in the ruling.
