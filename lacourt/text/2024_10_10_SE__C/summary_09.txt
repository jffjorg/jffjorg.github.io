And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion of WELLS INTERNATIONAL MARKETING GROUP, INC. (Defendant) to quash service of the summons and complaint in the unlawful detainer action filed by SIMIN L.P. (Plaintiff). The Defendant argued that the service was improper because Plaintiff failed to serve them with the latest versions of the Judicial Counsel forms, but the judge ruled that the forms used by Plaintiff were not rejected by the court and that the fact that they are outdated does not deprive the court of jurisdiction or render the service void. The judge ordered the Defendant to answer within 5 days from the date of the court's issuance of the ruling.
