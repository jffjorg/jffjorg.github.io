This contractual fraud action was filed by Plaintiff XIOMARA
VERELA MENDOZA (“Plaintiff”) on August 25, 2021. 
 
Defendant moves for judgment on pleadings “on the grounds
that Plaintiff’s operative Complaint cannot state facts sufficient to
constitute a cause of action against Defendant, given the Court’s order deeming
a number of Requests for Admissions admitted by Plaintiff that negate
Plaintiff’s causes of action as a matter of law.” (Motion 2:3-6.)  
 
On October 1, 2024, this Court granted in part Plaintiff’s
Motion to Set Aside the Court’s Order deeming matters admitted as to Request
Nos. 1-3. 
 
The Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings is DROPPED as MOOT
as to Request Nos. 1-3.
 
The unopposed Motion is GRANTED as to Request No. 4, which
admitted that there was no punitive damages liability on the part of Defendant.
