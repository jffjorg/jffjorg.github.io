And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's request for entry of default against the defendants, Trader Joe's Company, Inc. and Jeff Kirby. The defendants had requested an automatic 30-day extension of time to file a responsive pleading, which the court has granted. The court has also advanced the hearing on the plaintiff's opposition to the defendants' request for automatic extension to today's date, but has denied the opposition. The court's ruling means that the defendants will have additional time to respond to the plaintiff's complaint.
