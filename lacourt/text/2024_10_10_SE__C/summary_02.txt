And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge C Mendoza in a contractual fraud action filed by Plaintiff XIOMARA VERELA MENDOZA against Defendant INTERINSURANCE EXCHANGE OF THE AUTOMOBILE CLUB, INC. on August 25, 2021. The Defendant moved for judgment on the pleadings, arguing that Plaintiff's operative Complaint cannot state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action against the Defendant, given the Court's order deeming a number of Requests for Admissions admitted by Plaintiff that negate Plaintiff's causes of action as a matter of law.

The Court granted in part Plaintiff's Motion to Set Aside the Court's Order deeming matters admitted as to Request Nos. 1-3, making the Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings moot as to those requests. The Court also granted the Defendant's Motion as to Request No. 4, which admitted that there was no punitive damages liability on the part of the Defendant. Opposing Party is required to give notice, and the deadline for filing a reply is October 3, 2024.
