 Case Number:  23NWCV00392    Hearing Date:   October 10, 2024    Dept:  C Matter to be heard by Judge - Olivia RosalesORTIZ v. SOLIMAN
CASE NO.:  23NWCV00392
HEARING:  10/10/24
 
ADD ON
 
Defendant TAHANI SOLIMAN’s Motion to Compel Appearance and
Testimony of Plaintiff MARY ROSE ORTIZ at Deposition is GRANTED.   
 
Moving Party to give notice. 
 
This action concerning real property was filed by Plaintiffs MARY ROSE
ORTIZ and ANDREW ORTIZ (collectively “Plaintiffs”) against Defendants TAHANI
SOLIMAN, in individual; and TAHANI SOLIMAN, as Trustee to the Soliman Family
Trust; (collectively “Defendant”) and Does 1-100 on February 6, 2023. 
 
Defendant Soliman noticed the deposition of Plaintiff Mary
Rose Ortiz for July 12, 2024. Prior to the date of the deposition, Defendant’s
counsel was told by a non-attorney at Plaintiffs’ Counsel’s office that
Plaintiff Mary Rose Ortiz would not be appearing for the deposition. “Because
Plaintiff’s counsel himself did not conform he would not appear or produce
Plaintiff, Defendant appeared for the deposition. Plaintiff did not appear.”
(Motion 3:23-25.) Defendant now moves to compel the deposition of Plaintiff
Mary Rose Ortiz, and for monetary sanctions. 
 
In Opposition, Plaintiff Mary Rose Ortiz argues that the
Motion is procedurally defective and must be denied because Defendant failed to
submit a declaration stating that the Defendant contacted the deponent to
inquire about the nonappearance after Mary Ruiz Ortiz failed to appear as
required by CCP §2025.450(b)(2). 
 
Motions under CCP §2025.450 must “be accompanied by a meet
and confer declaration under Section 2016.040, or when the deponent fails to
attend the deposition and produce the documents, electronically stored
information, or things described in the deposition notice, by a declaration
stating that the petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire about the
nonappearance.” (CCP §2025.450(b)(2).) 
 
Although defense counsel submitted a declaration indicating
meet and confer efforts prior to the deposition, CCP §2025.450(b)(2) requires
evidence of such efforts after the deponent fails to appear at the deposition. 
 
 
This matter was initially heard on Thursday, October 3,
2024, but was continued to today’s date in the interests of adjudicating this
matter on the merits. Defendant/Moving Party was given the opportunity to
submit a declaration in compliance with CCP §2025.450(b)(2). 
 
On October 8, 2024, in compliance with this Court’s October
3, 2024 Order—Counsel for Defendant filed a Meet and Confer Declaration in
Support of Defendant’s Motion to Compel Appearance and Testimony of Plaintiff
Mary Rose Ortiz at Deposition. The October 8, 2024 Declaration of Dana Seyler
states that the parties were able to agree upon a new date for Mary Rose
Ortiz’s declaration. (See Seyler and Confer Decl., ¶¶12-13, Exs. 12-13.) The Deposition
of Mary Rose Ortiz is now scheduled for October 25, 2024. 
 
A party may obtain discovery by taking oral depositions. (CCP
§2025.010.) CCP §2025.450, which governs motions to compel deposition, provides
that “[i]f, after service of a deposition notice, a party to the action…without
having served a valid objection under §2025.410, fails to appear for
examination…the party giving the notice may move for an order compelling the
deponent’s attendance and testimony.” (CCP §2025.450(a).) 
 
The motion is GRANTED. Defendant is entitled to take Plaintiff’s
deposition, and Plaintiff does not substantively oppose being deposed. Plaintiff
MARY ROSE ORTIZ is ORDERED to comply with the Notice of Deposition of Mary Rose
Ortiz served on October 8, 2024.  
 
If [the] motion is granted, the court shall impose a monetary
sanction…in favor of the party who noticed the deposition and against the
deponent or the party with whom the deponent is affiliated, unless the court
finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification
or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (CCP
§2025.450(g)(2).) 
 
Sanctions are denied. Both parties acted with
substantial justification.
