Specially Appearing Defendant WELLS INTERNATIONAL MARKETING
GROUP, INC.’s Motion to Quash Service of Summons and Complaint is DENIED. 
 
Opposing Party to give notice. 
 
No Reply filed as of October 8, 2024. Due by October 4,
2024. (See 10/01/24 Order) 
 
This unlawful detainer action was filed by Plaintiff SIMIN
L.P. on August 27, 2024. 
 
Specially Appearing Defendant WELLS INTERNATIONAL MARKETING
GROUP, INC. (“Defendant”) now moves to quash service of the summons and Complaint
on the ground that “the Defendant has never been properly or lawfully served
with the Summons and Complaint and all other documents as required by the
California Rules of Court, the California Civil Code, and the California Code
of Civil Procedure.” (Notice 2:7-9.) Defendant specifically argues that the
substituted service effectuated on Friday, August 30, 2024 is insufficient
because “Plaintiff failed to serve Defendant with the Forms Adopted by
Mandatory Use from the Judicial Counsel of California. Accordingly, under
California law, service was improper and Defendant requests an Order from this
Court quashing service of Summons, Complaint and all other documents.” (Motion
3:19-22.) 
 
In Opposition, Plaintiff argues that the Motion should be
denied because the documents served adequately comply with CCP §§412.20 and
1167.
 
Plaintiff failed to utilize the latest versions of the
following Judicial Counsel forms: SUM-130 (Summons – Unlawful Detainer
-Eviction); CMC-010 (Civil Case Cover Sheet); and UD-101 (Plaintiff’s Mandatory
Cover Sheet and Supplemental Allegations – Unlawful Detainer. However, it is
undisputed that Defendant was served with a Court-stamped and Court approved
summons. Plaintiff’s documents were not rejected by this Court, and the fact
that the forms utilized by Plaintiff are outdated does not deprive this Court
of jurisdiction or otherwise render service void. As argued in Opposition, CRC
Rule 1.42(9) expressly states that this Court cannot reject forms that are “not
the latest version of the form adopted or approved by the Judicial Counsel.”
(Id.) 
 
The Motion is DENIED. Defendant is ORDERED to Answer within
5 days from the date of the Court’s issuance of this Order.
