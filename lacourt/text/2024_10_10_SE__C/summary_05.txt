And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has granted Defendant TAHANI SOLIMAN's Motion to Compel Appearance and Testimony of Plaintiff MARY ROSE ORTIZ at Deposition. The motion was filed because Plaintiff MARY ROSE ORTIZ failed to appear for the deposition on July 12, 2024. Although Defendant's counsel did not submit a declaration stating that they contacted the deponent to inquire about the nonappearance after the deposition, they did submit a declaration indicating meet and confer efforts prior to the deposition. The Judge found that Plaintiff MARY ROSE ORTIZ does not substantively oppose being deposed and ordered her to comply with the Notice of Deposition of Mary Rose Ortiz served on October 8, 2024. The deposition is now scheduled for October 25, 2024. The Judge also denied the request for monetary sanctions, finding that both parties acted with substantial justification.
