And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled on the demurrer filed by the defendants, Efren Martinez and Graciela Ortiz, to the plaintiff's First Amended Complaint. The plaintiff, B.A., alleges that Martinez and Ortiz were negligent in hiring and supervising Billy Valdivia, who was convicted of sexual assault and battery of a minor. The judge has overruled the demurrer in part as to Martinez, finding that Martinez had knowledge of Valdivia's reputation and should have taken action to prevent the harm. However, the judge has sustained the demurrer as to Ortiz, finding that the allegations against Ortiz do not sufficiently show that she knew or should have known of Valdivia's actions.

The judge has also ruled on the other causes of action, including intentional infliction of emotional distress and breach of duty to protect the minor student volunteer. The judge has overruled the demurrer as to all causes of action, finding that the allegations are sufficient to withstand demurrer.

The judge has also denied the demurrer to the fifth and sixth causes of action, which allege concealment and ex post facto cover-up of wrongdoing. The judge has found that the allegations are sufficient to show that the defendants engaged in a concerted effort to cover up Valdivia's actions.

Overall, the judge's tentative ruling is a mixed decision, finding that some of the defendants' demurrers are overruled, while others are sustained. The case will proceed to trial, where the plaintiff will have the opportunity to present its evidence and the defendants will have the opportunity to present their defense.
