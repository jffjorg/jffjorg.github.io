And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the unopposed motion for determination of good faith settlement filed by T&M Products, Inc. and Ivy Nunez. The settlement amount is $275,000.00. The judge has considered the factors set forth in Tech-Bilt v. Woodward-Clyde & Assoc. (1985) 38 Cal.3d 488, including the rough approximation of the claimant's total recovery and the settling parties' proportional liability, the amount paid in settlement, the allocation of settlement proceeds among claimants, and the financial condition of the settling parties. The judge has determined that the settlement is within the reasonable range of the settling parties' share of liability and is therefore made in good faith.
