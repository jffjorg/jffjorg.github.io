And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers and rules as follows. The defendants have filed a motion for summary judgment and a motion to specially set or advance the hearing on that motion, or to continue the trial. The plaintiff does not oppose the request to specially set or advance the hearing on the summary judgment motion, but opposes the request to continue the trial. The defendants filed their motion for summary judgment more than two weeks after the statutory deadline, so the court denies their motion to specially set or advance the hearing on the summary judgment motion or to continue the trial.
