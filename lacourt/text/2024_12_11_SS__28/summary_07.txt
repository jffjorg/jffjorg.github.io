And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has considered the petition to approve the compromise of minor Plaintiff Damian Rodriguez's action and has ruled as follows. The Court grants the petition, but with modifications. The gross settlement amount is $60,000.00, and the net balance is $29,676.88. The petition requests $24,000.00 in attorney's fees, but the Court has determined that an award of 30% of the gross settlement amount is reasonable. Therefore, the Court awards $18,000.00 in attorney's fees. With the attorney's fee award reduced to $18,000.00, the net settlement amount is increased to $35,676.88. The Court orders that $5,000.00 of the net settlement amount be paid or delivered to Ruben Rodriguez, the guardian ad litem, without bond. The remaining net settlement amount ($30,676.88) is to be deposited in insured accounts at US Bank, subject to withdrawal only on authorization of the Court. The Court also orders Plaintiff to file a notice of settlement and sets an Order to Show Cause Re: Proof of Deposit for February 28, 2025.
