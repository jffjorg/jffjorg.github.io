And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion filed by defendants to compel plaintiff to submit to medical examinations. The defendants are seeking to have the plaintiff examined by two physicians, a neurologist and a spine neurosurgeon, on November 12 and November 19, 2024, respectively. The defendants also asked the court to impose sanctions on the plaintiff. However, the judge has denied the motion because the defendants are unclear about the basis for the relief they seek. The judge has ordered the moving parties to give notice of this ruling and to file proof of service with the court within five days.
