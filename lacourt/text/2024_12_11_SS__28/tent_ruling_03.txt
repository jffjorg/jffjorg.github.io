On motion of the  party demanding the examination, the court may shorten this time.  “(e) The  defendant shall serve a copy of the demand under subdivision (a) on the  plaintiff and on all other parties who have appeared in the action.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2032.220.)            Code of  Civil Procedure section 2032.230 provides:  “(a) The  plaintiff to whom a demand for a physical examination under this article is  directed shall respond to the demand by a written statement that the examinee  will comply with the demand as stated, will comply with the demand as  specifically modified by the plaintiff, or will refuse, for reasons specified  in the response, to submit to the demanded physical examination.  “(b) Within  20 days after service of the demand the plaintiff to whom the demand is  directed shall serve the original of the response to it on the defendant making  the demand, and a copy of the response on all other parties who have appeared  in the action. On motion of the defendant making the demand, the court may  shorten the time for response. On motion of the plaintiff to whom the demand is  directed, the court may extend the time for response.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2032.230.)            Code of  Civil Procedure section 2032.240 provides in part:  “(a) If a  plaintiff to whom a demand for a physical examination under this article is  directed fails to serve a timely response to it, that plaintiff waives any  objection to the demand. The court, on motion, may relieve that plaintiff from  this waiver on its determination that both of the following conditions are  satisfied:  “(1) The  plaintiff has subsequently served a response that is in substantial compliance  with Section 2032.230.  “(2) The  plaintiff’s failure to serve a timely response was the result of mistake,  inadvertence, or excusable neglect.  “(b) The  defendant may move for an order compelling response and compliance with a  demand for a physical examination.  “(c) The  court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section  2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or  opposes a motion to compel response and compliance with a demand for a physical  examination, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with  substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of  the sanction unjust. . . .”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2032.240,  subds. (a), (b), (c).)            Code of  Civil Procedure section 2032.250 provides:  “(a) If a  defendant who has demanded a physical examination under this article, on  receipt of the plaintiff’s response to that demand, deems that any modification  of the demand, or any refusal to submit to the physical examination is  unwarranted, that defendant may move for an order compelling compliance with  the demand. This motion shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration  under Section 2016.040.  “(b) The  court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section  2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or  opposes a motion to compel compliance with a demand for a physical examination,  unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial  justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction  unjust.”(Code Civ. Proc., § 2032.250.) Code of Civil Procedure section 2032.310 provides:  “(a) If any  party desires to obtain discovery by a physical examination other than that  described in Article 2 (commencing with Section 2032.210), or by a mental  examination, the party shall obtain leave of court.  “(b) A motion  for an examination under subdivision (a) shall specify the time, place, manner,  conditions, scope, and nature of the examination, as well as the identity and  the specialty, if any, of the person or persons who will perform the  examination. The motion shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration  under Section 2016.040.  “(c) Notice  of the motion shall be served on the person to be examined and on all parties  who have appeared in the action.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2032.310.)  Code of Civil Procedure section 2032.320 provides in  part:  “(a) The  court shall grant a motion for a physical or mental examination under Section  2032.310 only for good cause shown.  * * *  “(d) An order  granting a physical or mental examination shall specify the person or persons  who may perform the examination, as well as the time, place, manner, diagnostic  tests and procedures, conditions, scope, and nature of the examination. . .  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2032.320, subds. (a), (d).)   DISCUSSION  On  October 11, 2024, Defendant Jaryn Pedroza noticed Plaintiff’s medical  examination by Luke Macyszyn, M.D., a board-certified spine neurosurgeon, for November  12, 2024.  On October 14, 2024, Defendant  JP Ready Mix, Inc., noticed Plaintiff’s medical examination by Dr. Barry  Ludwig, a board-certified neurologist, for November 19, 2024.  Defendants  generally assert that “The parties have met and conferred regarding the need to  take multiple examinations” and “Plaintiff's attorney has taken a position that  Defendant is entitled to one examination and will not submit to multiple  examinations . . . .”  (Motion p. 5.)  However, Defendants do not explain whether  Plaintiff served a response to one or both of Defendants’ notices of Plaintiff’s  medical examination under Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.230, subdivision  (a).  It is also unclear whether Defendants  are moving to compel compliance with their demand for a physical examination under  Code of Civil Procedure section 2032.240, subdivision (b), or Code of Civil  Procedure section 2032.250, subdivision (a), which apply to demands for a  physical examination without leave of court under Code of Civil Procedure section 2032.220.  Citing  Code of Civil Procedure section 2032.310, Defendants request “an order for  multiple examinations: orthopedic and neurological.”  (Motion pp. 6-7.)  Code of Civil Procedure section 2032.310  applies to requests for leave of court to conduct “a physical examination other than that described in Article  2 (commencing with Section 2032.210), or . . . a mental examination . . . .”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2032.310, subd. (a).)  Yet Defendants seek sanctions under Code of  Civil Procedure sections 2032.240 and 2032.250, which (as noted) apply to demands for a  physical examination without leave of court under Code of Civil Procedure section 2032.220.  The  Court denies the motion because Defendants are unclear about the basis for the  relief they seek.  CONCLUSION  The  Court DENIES the motion of Defendants Jaryn  Pedroza, Jaryn Pedroza, Inc., erroneously sued and served as Jaryn Pedroza Inc,  JP Ready Mix, Inc., erroneously sued and served as JP Ready Mix Inc, and Jaryn  Pedroza Ready Mix to compel Plaintiff’s medical examinations and for sanctions.  Moving  parties are ordered to give notice of this ruling.  Moving  parties are ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court  within five days.
