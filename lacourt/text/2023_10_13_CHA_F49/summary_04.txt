And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the defendant's motion to compel arbitration and stay the action. The plaintiff, Linda Jackson, executed a License Agreement with the defendant, Salon Republic, which included an arbitration clause. The defendant suspended use of the premises due to the Covid-19 pandemic, and the plaintiff subsequently requested termination of the License Agreement. The defendant demanded payment of rent, and the plaintiff vacated the premises. The plaintiff filed a complaint, and the defendant moved to compel arbitration based on the arbitration clause in the License Agreement. The judge finds that the arbitration agreement covers the disputed conduct set forth in the complaint and orders the action to be arbitrated in compliance with the terms of the agreement. The parties are directed to select an arbitrator or follow the American Arbitration Association's rules for selection. The court also orders the action stayed pending arbitration.
