And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion for reconsideration of the order compelling arbitration. The motion was filed by the plaintiffs, Kristen and Alfredo Galvan, who alleged that the defendants, Aqua Blue Construction, Inc., and Britton Julien, failed to obtain a valid contractor's license and workers' compensation insurance. The defendants argued that the additional language in the order was properly added, while the plaintiffs argued that it was improperly added.

The judge has also struck the additional language in the order, which referred to Business and Professions Code section 7168. The judge determined that the language was not conforming to the court's order and was the result of a clerical error.

The judge has ordered the parties to proceed with the arbitration selection, as ordered on April 6, 2023. The action remains stayed pending arbitration. The November 14, 2023, OSC re: Arbitration Status remains set pending the hearing, but subject to a new date.
