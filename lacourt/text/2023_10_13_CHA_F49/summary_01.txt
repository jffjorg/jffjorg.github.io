Here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge on a motion for judgment on the pleadings in a case involving a 15-cause-of-action complaint filed by Plaintiff Vanessa Silvas against Defendants Prohealth Professional Services, et al. The motion is granted without prejudice/with leave to amend. The court finds that Plaintiff lacks standing to prosecute the action due to the failure to disclose potential employment and workers' compensation claims in the bankruptcy petition. The court also finds that the statute of limitations is not tolled, and that the motion for judgment on the pleadings is timely. The court declines to make a finding of judicial estoppel and declines to address the issue of workers' compensation exclusivity. The court orders Plaintiff to substitute the bankruptcy trustee in order to proceed with the action, and grants Plaintiff 30 days to file an amended complaint with the substituted trustee as the real party in interest, or secure proof of abandonment of the claims in order to establish a restoration of standing by Plaintiff.
