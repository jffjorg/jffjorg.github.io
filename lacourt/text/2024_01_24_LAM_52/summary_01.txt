**Significant Statements:**
- "Where ... the plaintiff seeks to prove an essential element of her case by circumstantial evidence, she cannot recover merely by showing that the inferences she draws from those circumstances are consistent with her theory. Instead, she must show that the inferences favorable to her are more reasonable or probable than those against her." (Leslie G. v. Perry & Associates (1996) 43 Cal.App.4th 472, 483)
- "A trial court generally has 'no obligation to undertake its own search of the record 'backwards and forwards to try to figure out how the law applies to the facts' of the case." (Quantum Cooking Concepts, Inc. v. LV Associates, Inc. (2011) 197 Cal.App.4th 927, 934)
