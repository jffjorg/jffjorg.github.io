RELIEF REQUESTED  
 
            Plaintiff moves for an order

BACKGROUND 
 
This case
arises out of Plaintiff Justin Whiter’s lemon law claim for a 2019 Ford Fusion,
Vehicle Identification Number 3FA6P0HD4KR174062 (the “Subject Vehicle”).
Plaintiff filed his complaint on March 7, 2023. Plaintiff filed the instant motion to compel further responses to his
request for production of documents, set one (the “Motion”) issued to
FMC. Plaintiff does not request sanctions in connection with the Motion. 
 
TENTATIVE RULING 
 
            Plaintiff’s Motion to compel further
responses is granted in part. FMC is ordered to produce supplemental
verified, code-compliant responses to the RFPs and produce all responsive
documents which are not part of the public record within 30 days. RFP Nos. 45, 68, 73, and 79 are granted
subject to the following limitations: RFP Nos. 68 and 73 are
limited to documents from 2019; and RFP Nos. 45 and 79 are limited to documents
concerning the Subject Vehicle.
  
 
OBJECTIONS TO EVIDENCE 
 
A trial court may decline to rule on evidence that is not
material to the disposition of the motion. 
  
LEGAL STANDARD 
 
On receipt
of a response to discovery requests, the party requesting may move for an order
compelling further responses for interrogatories (Code Civ. Proc. 2030.300),
requests for admission (Cod. Civ. Proc. section 2033.290), and request for
production (Code Civ. Proc. section 2031.310). “Unless notice of this motion is
given within 45 days of the service of the verified response, or any
supplemental verified response, or any specific later date to which the
requesting party and the responding party have agreed in writing, the
requesting party waives any right to compel further response to the requests
for admission.” (Code Civ. Proc. section 2033.290, subd. (c). 
 
MEET AND CONFER
 
A motion to compel further responses to
requests for production of documents must be accompanied by a meet and confer
declaration. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (b)(2).)
 
The Court finds
that the meet and confer requirement has been met. (Smith Decl. ¶¶
26-34, Exs. 7-12).

Plaintiff seeks further responses to RFPs
1, 3, 12, 15, 17, 19, 31, 36, 39, 43, 45, 46, 56, 57, 58, 68, 69, 73, 76, 77,
78, 79, 80, 82 and 83.  Plaintiff argues that FMC’s responses are not code-compliant
and contain boilerplate objections.  
 
Plaintiff characterizes the RFPs as
falling into five categories: (1) documents concerning the Subject Vehicle
(Nos. 1, 3, 12, and 15); (2) documents concerning FMC’s internal knowledge and
investigation in other vehicles regarding the engine defects in other vehicles with
the same engine as the Subject Vehicle (Nos. 17, 19, 31, 36, and 39); (3)
documents concerning summaries, memorandum, PowerPoints regarding the engine
defects in other vehicles with the same engine as the Subject Vehicle (Nos. 43,
45 and 46); (4) documents concerning FMC’s lemon law policies and procedures
(Nos. 56, 57, 58, 68, 69 and 73); and (5) documents concerning communication
with governmental agencies and suppliers (Nos. 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 82 and 83). Plaintiff
asserts that there is good cause to seek these documents because they are
relevant to Plaintiff’s claims and various issues presented in the Complaint,
including whether FMC knew of the alleged defects. 
 
In the opposition (the “Opposition”), FMC argues its existing
responses are code-compliant and its privilege objections are proper and
merited.  FMC
argues that Plaintiff has not established good cause to compel further
responses or production. FMC also contends that Plaintiff’s definition of
“ENGINE DEFECT(S)” does not adequately describe the information sought, and the
requests are overly broad and burdensome. FMC additionally argues cost shifting
is appropriate if the Court compels FMC to produce discovery. 
 
The Court finds that Plaintiff has shown good cause that the
RFPs seek documents relevant to the action. FMC’s current objections are stated
in boilerplate and conclusory language and its responses are not code compliant
under CCP section 2031.210. As to FMC’s argument regarding Plaintiff’s Engine
Defect definition, Plaintiff provides the following definition: “[t]he term ‘ENGINE
DEFECT(S)’ shall be understood to mean such defects which result in symptoms,
including, loss of power; rough running; engine misfire(s); loss of coolant
and/or oil; low coolant and/or oil; failure and/or replacement of the engine,
cylinder, long block, and/or engine components; and/or any other similar
concern identified in the repair history for the SUBJECT VEHICLE.” The Court
finds that this definition adequately describes the information sought as it is
based on Plaintiff’s repair orders. 
 
Notwithstanding, the Court finds that RFP
Nos. 68 and 73 should be limited to documents from 2019, whereas RFP Nos. 45
and 79 should be limited to documents concerning the Subject Vehicle. Further,
as to RFP Nos. 76, 78, and 80, the Court limits the requests to documents that
are not publicly available NHTSA documents. 
 
Sanctions are not requested and the Court
declines to impose sanctions. 
 
CONCLUSION 
 
 The Court GRANTS the Motion in part and orders
FMC to produce supplemental verified, code-compliant responses to the RFPs and
produce all responsive documents which are not part of the public record within
30 days. RFP Nos. 45, 68,
73, and 79 are granted subject to the limitation described above.
