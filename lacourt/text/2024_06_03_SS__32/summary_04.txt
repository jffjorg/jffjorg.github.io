And here is the English text summarizing the Tentative Ruling:

The motion to enforce a settlement agreement is denied. The plaintiff, Theresa Oshodi, signed the agreement on April 23, 2024, but the defendants did not sign the agreement. The plaintiff argues that the agreement was amended on April 24, 2024, but the defendants maintain that there was no written agreement signed by both parties. The court finds that the agreement is not enforceable under California Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6 because it was not signed by all parties to the agreement.
