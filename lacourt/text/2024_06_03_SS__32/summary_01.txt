And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has tentatively ruled that Counsel, Raymond Ghermezian, Esq., may be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff Javier Aguilar due to a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship. The Court finds that this is a valid reason for withdrawal. However, the Court orders Counsel to file an updated proposed order within 5 calendar days of the hearing, which must include information about all future hearings and proceedings noticed by any party. Additionally, Counsel must serve the signed order within 10 days of the date of the order and file a proof of service of such. The Court conditionally grants the motion pending Counsel's filing and service of the updated proposed order.
