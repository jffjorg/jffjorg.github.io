OPPOSING PARTY:


Unopposed
  



 
 
The Court has reviewed the amended
expedited petition filed May 15, 2024 by Petitioner Allen Quinn (Petitioner) on
behalf of Claimant Fuyuku Quinn, age 9. The Court denies the petition
without prejudice for the following reasons:
 
Since Petitioner marked 3g(2), he must include attachment
3 describing an investigation showing that defendants are judgment proof outside
their insurance policy limits.  
 
Attachment 11c must contain more terms of the settlement,
including what Claimant agrees to do in return. 
 
Petitioner must not include Claimant’s settlement in item
12b since that section is reserved for “persons other than the claimant.” 
 
Since attachment 13g shows $5,670 in medical charges,
with payments and adjustments, Petitioner must amend the values in item 13a
accordingly. 
 
Petitioner requests $750.00 in attorney fees which represents
25% of the gross settlement. Petitioner must provide a copy of the fee
agreement in attachment 14a. 
 
In item 18b, instead of writing Fuyuku Quinn, Petitioner
must include the expected attorney fees from Haruko
Quinn. 
 
Petitioner now marks 15b, indicating that Petitioner paid
the attorney fees and costs. However, no proof of the expenses and payments
were provided. If no payments have been made, then Petitioner should select 15a
instead. 
 
In the proposed order (MC-351), the gross settlement must
be listed in item 6 ($3,000). 
 
In form MC-355, the amount in item 4 must match the net
balance amount shown in the petition and MC-351 ($1,745.19). 
 
Moving party is ordered to give
notice.
