HEARING DATE:


June
  3, 2024




CASE NUMBER:


21STCV28000




MOTIONS:  


Motion
  to Enforce Settlement 




MOVING PARTY:


Defendants Jinhwan Kim, Ryung Hwan Kyung,
  and JDLK Trucking, Inc. 




OPPOSING PARTY:


Plaintiff
  Theresa Oshodi



 
 
BACKGROUND
 
This action arises out of an alleged motor vehicle accident that
occurred on May 13, 2020. Plaintiff Theresa Oshodi (“Plaintiff”) filed the
complaint on July 30, 2021. 
 
On October 18, 2023, the Court granted Plaintiff’s counsel’s motion to
be relieved. Plaintiff is currently self-represented. 
 
Defendants Jinhwan Kim, Ryung Hwan Kyung, and JDLK Trucking, Inc.
(“Defendants”) now move to enforce a purported settlement agreement between
Defendants and Plaintiff under Code of Civil Procedure section 644.6. On May
22, 2024, Plaintiff filed an “Answer” to Defendants’ motion, in opposition. No
proof of service is attached to Plaintiff’s “Answer” and no reply has been
filed.[1] 
 
LEGAL
STANDARD 
Pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 664.6, “if parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a
writing signed by the parties outside the presence of the court or orally
before the court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon
motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement.  If
requested by the parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties to
enforce the settlement until performance in full of the terms of the
settlement.”  “Section 664.6 was enacted to provide a summary procedure
for specifically enforcing a settlement contract without the need for a new
lawsuit.”  (Weddington Productions, Inc. v. Flick (1998) 60 Cal.App.4th 793, 809.)  A writing is
signed by a “party” if signed by any of the following: “(1) The party; (2) An
attorney who represents the party; or (3) If the party is an insurer, an agent
who is authorized in writing by the insurer to sign on the insurer's behalf.”
(Code Civ. Proc. § 664.6.)    
To be enforceable under Code of Civil
Procedure section 664.6, any written settlement agreement outside of court must
be signed. An agreement to settle under section 664.6 cannot be enforced unless
it is signed by all of the litigating parties to the agreement. (J.B.B.
Investment Partners, Ltd. v. Fair (2014) 232 Cal.App.4th 974, 985.) Although the Court may adjudicate
disputes over the terms of the settlement agreement, the Court may not modify
terms from what was agreed to by the parties. (Machado v. Myers (2019)
39 Cal.App.5th 779, 797.) 
 
DISCUSSION
 
Defendants assert that the parties reached a settlement compromise on
April 23, 2024. The purported settlement agreement was signed by Plaintiff on
April 23, 2024 and is attached to this motion as exhibit A. (Miller Decl. ¶ 4,
Exh. A.) The material terms state that Defendants will pay Plaintiff $40,000
and $13,500 to “Law Offices of William W. Green & Associates.” In exchange,
Plaintiff will dismiss the case with prejudice.
 
Defendants assert that on April 24, 2024, Plaintiff called Defendants’
counsel stating she wanted to “amend” the settlement to a total amount of
$60,000. (Miller Decl. ¶ 5.) Defendants then filed this motion to enforce the
agreement. 
 
In opposition, Plaintiff concedes that she signed the Agreement on
April 23, 2024, but argues that it was amended on April 24, 2024 by verbal and
written agreement. (Answer, 2.) Plaintiff asks the Court to enforce the amended
agreement; Plaintiff refers to a “Notice of the Amendment of Contract” dated
April 24, 2024. 
 
Plaintiff argues that Defendants did not pay for Plaintiff’s property
damage to her vehicle. (Answer, 3.) Plaintiff also argues that her signature on
the agreement was “rendered under duress and undue influence.” (Id., 5.)
However, Plaintiff does not provide facts supporting she signed it under
duress. Attached to the opposition, Plaintiff provides what appears to the
Agreement signed by her on April 23, 2024.[2]
After the fifth paragraph, the following was added:
 
“Notice of Amendment of Contract
 
Releasor hereby reminds releasees that the property damage out of
pocket costs estimated by releasees in 2021 as $13,000.00 for the totaled 2014
Hyundai Sonata is not included in this release.
 
A compensation payout must include property damage, which is usually
paid upfront.
 
And whereas releasor incurred additional out of pocket costs such as
car rentals, driver to drive the rentals for the first three months, tow yard
and storage costs to the tune of approximately $5,000, releasor is settling for
only additional 10,000 gross settlement amount, instead of $15,000.
 
This contract is hereby amended as such, and pursuant to the phone
conversation with defendants’ trial lawyer, Stacey Miller on 4/24/24 at
approximately 9:30 a.m.”
 
Notwithstanding the assertions in Plaintiff’s opposition, the
purported agreement that Defendants seek to enforce was signed only by
Plaintiff. (See Miller Decl., Exh. A.) There is no indication that Defendants,
or their counsel, also signed the agreement. Therefore, because section 664.6
requires the agreement to be signed
by all of the litigating parties to the agreement, the motion to enforce
pursuant to section 664.6 is denied. (See J.B.B. Investment
Partners, Ltd., supra, 232 Cal.App.4th at 985.)
 
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
 
Therefore,
Defendants’
motion to enforce settlement is DENIED. 
 
            Defendants shall give notice of
the Court’s order and file a proof of service of such.
