And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge is granting the motion for appointment of successor in interest, but conditionally, pending the filing of an amended declaration that corrects the defects in the current declaration. The declaration does not provide the place of Plaintiff's death and does not include exhibit A, purporting to be Plaintiff's death certificate. The judge is requiring the moving party to file an amended declaration and provide a certified copy of Plaintiff's death certificate.
