Background
Pleadings
On February 25, 2021, Plaintiff
Creditors Adjustment Bureau, Inc. (Plaintiff)—as assignee of interests held by
State Compensation Insurance Fund (Assignor)—sued Defendant Addition Building
& Design, Inc. (Addition B&D), Michael Ross (dba Green Build Design LA)
and Does 1 through 10 pursuant to a Complaint alleging claims of (1) Breach of
Contract, (2) Open Book Account, (3) Account Stated, and (4) Reasonable Value.
The claims arise from allegations
that Defendant Addition B&D and Assignor entered into a written agreement
through which Assignor agreed to provide a policy of workers compensation
insurance to Defendant, bearing Policy No. 9203093-18 and providing coverage
for the period of January 11, 2018 through January 11, 2019, for which
Defendant agreed to pay premiums in accordance with the terms and conditions of
said policy, only for Defendant Addition B&D to default on payments as of
May 26, 2020, resulting in damages of $296,480.20, together with interest
thereon at the rate of ten percent (10%) per annum from May 26, 2020.
Motion Before the Court
On September 12, 2023, Plaintiff
served (1) a third set of requests for admission (RFAs, Set Three) on Defendant
Ross and (2) a third set of requests for admission (RFAs, Set Three) on
Defendant Addition B&D.
Based on their failure to respond,
on October 24, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel sent a meet and confer letter to
Defendants’ counsel.
On November 7, 2023, due to ongoing
nonresponse, Plaintiff filed motions to deem RFAs, Set Three, admitted against
Defendants Ross and Addition B&D. Both motions seek awards of monetary
sanctions and were served via mail and email on Defendants’ counsel.
The motions are accompanied by a
facially valid proof of service.
The motions are unopposed by
Defendants Ross and Addition B&D and are now before the Court.
 
Motion to Deem Requests for Admission Admitted

Legal Standard
The discovering party can make a
motion to deem as admitted any unanswered requests for admission or any
requests answered in a late or unverified response. (See Code Civ. Proc., §
2033.280, subd. (b); Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.240, subd. (a) [RFA responses must
be signed by responding party under oath]; see Appleton v. Superior Court
(1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 632, 636 [unsworn response to RFAs is treated like no
response].) These requests are not automatically deemed admitted; the discovery
party must make the motion. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).)
To establish this ground, a movant
must show:
(1) Proper service (see Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.070);
(2) Expiration of the deadline for
the initial response 30 days after service or on date agreed to by parties (see
Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.250, subds. (a), (b)); and
(3) That (a) the responding party
served no response (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b)), (b) the
propounding party served a late response (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd.
(b)); or (3) the responding party served an unsworn response (see Appleton
v. Superior Court, supra, 206 Cal.App.3d at p. 636 [unsworn response
to RFAs is treated like no response]).
A court must deny a motion to
compel initial discovery where the discovery sought is outside the scope of
discovery. (See CBS, Inc. v. Superior Court (1968) 263 Cal.App.2d 12,
19; see also Code. Civ. Proc., § 2017.010 [scope of discovery].)
Order Deeming RFAs Admitted:
GRANTED.
Plaintiff shows the September 12,
2023 service of (1) RFAs, Set Three on Defendant Ross’s counsel and (2) RFAs,
Set Three, on Defendant Addition B&D’s counsel. (All Motions, Frischer
Decl., Ex. 1, Proof of Service.)
Plaintiff shows expiration of the
deadline for the initial responses and Defendants’ ongoing failure to serve
responses to these discovery requests. (See All Motions, Frischer Decl., ¶¶ 1-5.)
A review of the discovery requests
shows that they are within the scope of discovery because they involve requests
that go to admissible evidence or matters reasonably calculated to lead to the
discovery of admissible evidence. (All Motions, Frischer Decl., Ex. A.)
Plaintiffs’ motions are thus
GRANTED.
Sanctions: GRANTED.
The Court must award sanctions when
a party’s response is untimely, and the discovering party makes a motion to
deem the requests admitted. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c); see Stover
v. Bruntz (2017) 12 Cal.App.5th 19, 31-32; see e.g., Appleton v.
Superior Court, supra, 206 Cal.App.3d at pp. 635-636 [sanctions are
mandatory].)
The court may award sanctions under
the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery,
even though no opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to the motion
was withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party
after the motion was filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1348, subd. (a).)
The Court finds that the complete
failure to respond to an authorized method of discovery—requests for admission—supports
monetary sanctions against Defendants Ross and Addition B&D. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (d); Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1348, subd. (a).)
The Court also finds that both
motions sufficiently support the requested sanctions through nearly identical
declarations from counsel, which specify the costs for filing each motion, the
reasonable fee rate charged by counsel, and the reasonable hours expended in
preparing each motion and expected to be expended in attending the hearing.
(All Motions, Frischer Decl., ¶ 5.)
Both requests for sanctions are
thus GRANTED, for a total monetary sanctions recovery of $2,873.30.
