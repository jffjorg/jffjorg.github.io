Here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling is in response to a demurrer filed by Laura Gonzalez, a defendant in the Unlawful Detainer Action (Case No. 23NWCV02960). The demurrer was based on allegations that the Unlawful Detainer Complaint is uncertain, ambiguous, or unintelligible. The Court finds that the Complaint is sufficient to state a cause of action and to apprise the defendant of the issues to be met. The Court also determines that the allegations in the SAC (Second Amended Complaint) are not accepted as truth, even if verified. Additionally, the Court finds that the issues in the Unlawful Detainer Action and the Civil Action (Case No. 22STCV05593) are not substantially the same. Therefore, the demurrer is overruled, and Laura Gonzalez is ordered to file an Answer within 5 court days.
