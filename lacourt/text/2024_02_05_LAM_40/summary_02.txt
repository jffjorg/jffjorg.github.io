Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that Global Cannabis Applications Corp.'s demurrer to the First Amended Complaint filed by High Heals Kitchen, Inc. and Michelle Mangione is OVERRULED. The demurrer was filed on October 26, 2023, and argued that the complaint failed to sufficiently allege fraud. The judge found that the allegations in the complaint, including the parties' entry into a Nondisclosure Agreement, GCAC's offer to buy Plaintiffs' proprietary technology, and GCAC's false representations to Plaintiffs, sufficiently alleged a cause of action for fraud. The judge also found that the allegations demonstrated GCAC's intent to deceive or induce reliance and resulted in damages to Plaintiffs. The judge ordered GCAC to file its Answer within 10 days.
