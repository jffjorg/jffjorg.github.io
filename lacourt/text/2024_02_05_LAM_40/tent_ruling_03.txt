Background
Pleadings in This Action – LASC. No. 23NWCV02960
On September 18, 2023, Plaintiff Maria R. Villagrana (Maria Villagrana) filed
a Complaint – Unlawful Detainer against Defendants Laura Gonzalez, Maria
Guadalupe, and Does 1 to 10 (the Unlawful Detainer Action).
The Complaint is based on allegations that Defendants breached a
subtenancy agreement first entered in January 1, 2006 for tenancy at 12136
Lowemont Street, Norwalk, California 90650 (the Property), with Defendants
first entering the agreement with the prior owner of the Property, “Jose” (deceased,
or Decd.), Maria Villagrana later coming into ownership of the Property and
“offering an agreement verbally to tenants,” and Defendants breaching the
agreement by failing to make 12 payments of rent ($2,500 per month x 12 months
equaling $30,000).
Maria Villagrana prays for possession of the premises, costs, past-due
rent of $30,000, forfeiture of agreement, damages of $83.33 per day from
September 6, 2023, and relief the Court deems just and proper.
Other Proceedings - LASC No. 22STCV05593
Prior to the above actions, on February 14, 2022, Laura Gonzalez
initiated LASC No. 22STCV05593 (the Civil Action) by filing a Verified
Complaint alleging claims of Quiet Title, Cancellation of Instrument, and
Declaratory Relief against Maria Villagrana, her spouse, Jaime Villagrana, and all
persons unknown claiming an interest in the Property. The Quiet Title claims
sought quiet title over the Property. The Cancellation of Instrument claim
sought cancellation of 2017 and 2018 grant deeds for the Property from Jose
Gonzalez (Decd.)—Laura Gonzalez’s husband and Maria Villagrana’s father—to
Maria Villagrana. Maria Villagrana demurred to that pleading, and the Court
sustained the demurrer on September 8, 2022. The declaratory relief claim
sought a declaration on rights and duties regarding Laura Gonzalez’s community
property interest in the Property in light of payments made toward the mortgage
by Jose Gonzalez during their marriage and whether the above grant deeds were
void or ineffective.
On October 6, 2022, Laura Gonzalez filed a First Amended Complaint (FAC)
alleging the same three claims against the same three defendants. On July 6,
2023, the Court sustained a demurrer by Maria Villagrana to the FAC, finding
that, as alleged, the Property was owned by Jose Gonzalez as sole property and
was then transferred to his trust. Based on those pleadings, the Court found,
the FAC only alleged a possible community property reimbursement action against
the owner of the Property, which, per the FAC, would be Jose Gonzalez’s trust,
provided the 2017 and 2017 deeds were voided or found ineffective. Thus, the
Quiet Title and Cancellation of Instrument claims and derivative Declaratory
Relief claims were found to be fatally deficient as pled.
On July 25, 2023, Laura Gonzalez filed a Verified Second Amended
Complaint (SAC) alleging claims of (1) Declaratory Relief for Equitable
Reimbursement on Real Property and (2) Unjust Enrichment against Maria
Villagrana and all persons unknown claiming an interest in the Property. On
December 4, 2023, the Court overruled a demurrer by Maria Villagrana to the
FAC, reasoning among other things that the declaratory relief claim stated a
controversy regarding Laura Gonzalez’s entitlement to reimbursement of community
property assets by way of an equitable lien on the Property. However, the Court
sustained the demurrer to the Unjust Enrichment claim on the ground that no
such claim exists in California. The Court also granted a motion to strike
portions of the SAC, specifically and only as to paragraph 32.
On January 8, 2024, Laura Gonzalez filed an Answer to the SAC.
Motion Before the Court – LASC. No. 23NWCV02960
On September 28, 2023, Laura
Gonzalez demurred to the Complaint in the Unlawful Detainer Action.
On December 7, 2023, Laura Gonzalez filed notices of related case in both
actions.
On December 18, 2023, the Court related the Civil Action and Unlawful
Detainer Action.
On December 19, 2023, Maria
Villagrana opposed the demurrer.
No reply appears in the record.
 
Request
for Judicial Notice
The Court takes judicial notice of
the SAC in the Civil Action, the 1996 marriage certificate for Laura Gonzalez
and Jose Gonzalez, and the 2001 death certificate for Jose Gonzalez. (Demurrer,
RJN, Exs. A-C; Evid. Code, §§ 452, subds. (c), (d), 453, subds. (a)-(b).)
 
Demurrer
Demurrer Sufficiency Standard
A demurrer for sufficiency tests
whether the complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007)
147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747; see Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (e).) This
device can be used only to challenge defects that appear on the face of the
pleading under attack or from matters outside the pleading that are judicially
noticeable. (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) To sufficiently allege a cause of action,
a complaint must allege all the ultimate facts—that is, the facts needed to establish
each element of the cause of action pleaded. (Committee on Children’s
Television, Inc. v. General Foods Corp. (1983) 35 Cal.3d 197, 212,
superseded by statute as stated in Branick v. Downey Savings & Loan
Assn. (2006) 39 Cal.4th 235, 242.) Thus, “[t]o survive a
[general] demurrer, the complaint need only allege facts sufficient to state a
cause of action; each evidentiary fact that might eventually form part of the
plaintiff’s proof need not be alleged.” (C.A. v. William S. Hart Union High
School Dist. (2012) 53 Cal.4th 861, 872.) In testing the sufficiency of the
cause of action, the demurrer admits the truth of all material facts properly
pleaded. (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital Dist. (1992) 2 Cal.4th 962,
966-67.) A demurrer, however, “does not admit contentions, deductions or
conclusions of fact or law.” (Daar v. Yellow Cab Co. (1967) 67 Cal.2d
695, 713.) When considering demurrers, courts read the allegations liberally
and in context. (Taylor v. City of Los Angeles Dept. of Water and Power
(2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1228, disapproved on other grounds, Jones v.
Lodge at Torrey Pines Partnership (2008) 42 Cal.4th 1158, 1162.) The face
of the complaint includes exhibits attached to the complaint. (Frantz v.
Blackwell (1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 91, 94.) If facts appearing in the exhibits
contradict those alleged, the facts in the exhibits take precedence. (Holland
v. Morse Diesel Intern., Inc. (2001) 86 Cal.App.4th 1443, 1447, superseded
by statute on other grounds as stated in White v. Cridlebaugh (2009) 178
Cal.App.4th 506, 521.)
Uncertainty Legal Standard 
A demurrer to a pleading lies where
the pleading is uncertain, ambiguous, or unintelligible. (Code Civ. Proc. §
430.10, subd. (f).) “A demurrer for uncertainty is strictly construed, even
where a complaint is in some respects uncertain, because ambiguities can be
clarified under modern discovery procedures.” (Khoury v. Maly’s of
California, Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616, disapproved on other
grounds in Quelimane Co. v. Stewart Title Guar. Co. (1998) 19 Cal.4th
26, 46 [holding claims for unfair business practices need not be pled
specifically, impliedly disapproving Khoury].) As a result, a special
demurrer for uncertainty is not intended to reach failure to incorporate
sufficient facts in the pleading but is directed only at uncertainty existing
in the allegations already made. (People v. Taliaferro (1957) 149
Cal.App.2d 822, 825, disapproved on other grounds in Jefferson v. J.E.
French Co. (1960) 54 Cal.2d 717, 719-720 [statute of limitations question].)
Where complaint is sufficient to state a cause of action and to apprise
defendant of issues he is to meet, it is not properly subject to a special
demurrer for uncertainty. (See ibid.; see also Gressley v. Williams
(1961) 193 Cal.App.2d 636, 643 [“A special demurrer [for uncertainty] should be
overruled where the allegations of the complaint are sufficiently clear to
apprise the defendant of the issues which he is to meet”].)
Order on Demurrer: OVERRULED.
A defendant may demur in an
unlawful detainer proceeding. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1170.)
In her demurrer, Laura Gonzalez
first argues that the Unlawful Detainer Complaint should be sustained because the
allegations in the Complaint to the effect the Laura Gonzalez ever entered into
a tenancy agreement are a lie, as shown by the judicially noticed documents.
Laura Gonzalez also argues that the demurrer should be sustained because the
Complaint contains nothing but “[m]ere recitals, references to, or allegations
of material facts that are left to surmise [that] are subject to a special
demurrer for uncertainty.” (Demurrer, pp. 3-6.)
In her opposition, Maria Villagrana
cites a wealth of authority in opposition to Laura Gonzalez’s demurrer but only
makes a single cursory and conclusory argument supporting the sufficiency or
certainty of pleading. (Opp’n, pp. 3-5.)
No reply appears in the record.
The Court finds in favor of Maria
Villagrana.
Any issues relating to whether
allegations in the Complaint are lies are evidentiary, whereas a demurrer
focuses on the pleadings. (See Blank v. Kirwan, supra, 39 Cal.3d at
p. 318.) The fact that the SAC was filed and has been judicially noticed does
not change the Court’s determination because the allegations made in the SAC are
not accepted as truth, even if verified. (Lockley v. Law Office of Cantrell,
Green, Pekich, Cruz & McCort (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 875, 885 [Documents
are only judicially noticeable to show their existence and what orders were
made such that the truth of the facts and findings within the documents are not
judicially noticeable].)
The Court also determines that the
“material facts left to surmise” argument is not sufficiently elaborated as to
merit a different outcome. As stated, the Unlawful Detainer Complaint is
sufficient insofar as it alleges that a rental agreement exists between the
parties and has been breached by Defendants.
To the extent that Laura Gonzalez
demurs to the Unlawful Detainer Complaint on the ground that there is another
action pending between the same parties on the same cause of action (the Civil
Action)—otherwise known as a plea in abatement pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 430.10, subdivision (c)—the Court finds that such a demurrer
would not have been sustained either. Both actions must be but are not based on
substantially the same cause of action, turning on a determination of whether judgment
in the first action would bar recovery in the second action (Lord v. Garland
(1946) 27 Cal.2d 840, 848.)
Here, the SAC in the Civil Action
alleges a single operative claim: Declaratory Relief for determination of
whether Laura Gonzalez is entitled to reimbursement from Maria Villagrana as a
result of community property contributions to the mortgage during Jose
Gonzalez’s life and whether the 2017 and 2018 deeds are void or ineffective. (SAC,
¶¶ 33-35.) A determination on the right to reimbursement or validity of the
2017 and 2018 grant deeds, however, does not affect a determination on Maria
Villagrana’s entitlement to possession of the premises or past due rent as a
result of Defendants’ alleged breach of the purported oral agreement between
the parties, which is the purpose of the Complaint in the Unlawful Detainer
Action.
Defendant Laura Gonzalez’s demurrer
is thus OVERRULED.

Conclusion
Defendant Laura Gonzalez’s Demurrer to the Complaint in the Unlawful
Detainer Action is OVERRULED. Defendant is ordered to file an Answer
within 5 court days.
