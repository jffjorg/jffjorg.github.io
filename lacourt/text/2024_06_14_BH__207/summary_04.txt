And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses the extension of the deadline for filing a lawsuit. The plaintiff, Eislers, brought an Unlawful Detainer complaint, which was originally filed on behalf of a different entity but was later amended. The defendants argue that the case was not actually stayed, but rather was actively litigated until July 9, 2021. The court does not need to address the issue of whether scheduling a trial date, entering an order declaring the plaintiff a vexatious litigant, or holding status conferences regarding the status of the appeal precludes a finding that the action was actually stayed. Instead, the court finds that even construing the deadline most favorably to the plaintiff, the deadline has still passed.
