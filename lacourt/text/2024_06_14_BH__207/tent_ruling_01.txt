MATTER


Request for Default Judgment



 
Plaintiff Roman Teroganesyan (“Plaintiff”) requests for default
judgment against Defendants ZG Valet, Inc. and Victor Zamora (“Defendants”)
in the amount of $32,155.54, which is composed of general damages in the amount
of $10,000; special damages in the amount of $21,217.47; and costs in the
amount of $938.07.
 
1.     Doe
Defendants 
 
            Plaintiff’s
Complaint alleges a single cause of action for negligence, arising from the
theft of valuable items from the trunk of Plaintiff’s vehicle after the vehicle
was left unlocked while in Defendants’ care. 
Defendant Zamora was substituted in the case as Doe 1.  Defendants were personally served with a copy
of the summons and complaint on November 18, 2023. Default was entered against
Defendants on February 8, 2024. 
Plaintiff has not yet requested dismissal of the remaining unnamed Doe
defendants.  The Court cannot enter
default judgment while the Doe defendants remain in the case.
 
2.    
Damages
 
            Plaintiff’s
Complaint does not specify the amount of damages sought.  The Court cannot award damages that are in
excess of what is pled in the Complaint. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 580, subd. (a)
[“The relief granted to the plaintiff, if there is no answer, cannot exceed
that demanded in the complaint”]; Levine v. Smith (2006)
145 Cal.App.4th 1131, 1136-1137 [“when recovering damages in a default
judgment, the plaintiff is limited to the damages specified in the complaint”].)  
 
            Further, the Court notes that
Plaintiff served a Statement of Damages on Defendants on February 2, 2024.  (See Proofs of Service filed February 9,
2024.)  However, Plaintiff failed to
submit the Statement of Damages with the request for entry of default
judgment.  
 
            But more important, the service of a
Statement of Damages in lieu of alleging specific damages in the operative
complaint is not apt.  Generally, “A
statement of damages cannot be relied on to establish a plaintiff's monetary
damages on the defendant's default, except in a personal injury or wrongful
death case.”  (Cal. Judges Benchbook,
Civ. Proc. Before Trial § 16.16, p. 1924, citations omitted.)   In Sporn v. Home Depot USA, Inc., the
Court of Appeal determined:
 
Defendant
also attacks the judgment under section 425.11, contending that plaintiff was
required to serve it with a statement of damages and failed to do so. Section
425.11 applies to an action for personal injuries or wrongful death and was
passed concurrently with the amendment to section 425.10 that prohibits stating
the amount demanded in the complaint filed in such an action. Section 425.11
was enacted to satisfy the due process requirement that defendants be apprised
of their exposure before a default may be taken.  But here the complaint, which was not limited
to personal injuries and did not claim wrongful death, expressly apprised
defendant of the amount demanded. A statement of damages would have been
superfluous and was not required under these circumstances.
 
(Sporn
v. Home Depot USA, Inc. (2005) 126 Cal.App.4th 1294, 1302 [Plaintiff’s
claims of negligence, gross negligence, fraudulent misrepresentation and fraud centered
on the theft of his identity] [cleaned up].) 
Similar to the appellate court’s determination Sporn v. Home Depot USA,
Inc., this Court finds that Plaintiff’s action is not one for personal
injuries or wrongful death as defined pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
sections 425.10 and 425.11.  As such,
Plaintiff will need to amend the complaint and serve it on Defendants before
the Court will enter default judgment as requested.  
 
CONCLUSION
 
            Because the Doe
defendants have not yet been dismissed and because Plaintiff seeks damages in
excess of those demanded in the Complaint, the Court denies without prejudice
Plaintiff’s request to enter default judgment.
 
            Further, the
Court continues the Order to Show Cause re Entry of Default and/or Default
Judgment to October 22, 2024 at 8:30 A.M. in Department 207.
