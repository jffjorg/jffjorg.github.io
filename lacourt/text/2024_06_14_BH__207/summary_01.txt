Here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has denied the plaintiff's request for entry of default judgment, citing that the Doe defendants have not yet been dismissed from the case. Additionally, the court found that the plaintiff's complaint does not specify the amount of damages sought, and therefore cannot award damages in excess of what is pled in the complaint. The court also noted that the plaintiff failed to submit the Statement of Damages with the request for entry of default judgment. Finally, the court continued the Order to Show Cause re Entry of Default and/or Default Judgment to October 22, 2024.
