[1]              Plaintiff’s
evidentiary objections to the Declaration of Curtis C. Jung filed in support of
Defendants’ Demurrer are SUSTAINED. 


[2]              On
August 26, 2024, the court OVERRULED the demurrer as to First (Breach of
Contract), Second (Declaratory Relief) and Ninth (Breach of Fiduciary Duty) Causes
of Action in the original Complaint. Therefore, the court declines to revisit
those causes of action in the instant demurrer.
