And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is granting the motions of Counsel Michael J. Khouri to be relieved as counsel for Family Choice Private Duty Agency, Inc. (FCPDA) and Shellydale Princess Gray. Counsel's motions comply with the requirements of California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, except for the failure to provide proposed orders granting Counsel's motions. The court determines that Counsel has not been able to communicate with Gray, who is the sole owner of FCPDA, due to her health conditions. Despite this, the court grants the requested withdrawal, subject to the filling of proposed orders within five days of this order, and effective upon the filing of proof of service showing service of the signed orders.
