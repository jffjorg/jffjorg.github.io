Plaintiff and Cross-Defendant’s
Counsel Michael J. Khouri’s Motions to be Relieved as Counsel are GRANTED, subject
to the filling of proposed orders within five (5) days of this order, and effective
upon the filing of proof of service showing service of the signed orders. 
 
Background
Plaintiff Family Choice
Private Duty Agency, Inc. (“FCPDA”) alleges as follows:
On October 15, 2019,
Marilyn Ashby (“Decedent”) entered into an agreement with FCPDA where FCPDA
would provide in-home care services to Decedent who had been diagnosed with
terminal cancer.  
FCPDA provided its
services from October 2019 through Decedent’s death on February 14, 2020. At
the time of Decedent’s death, there was an outstanding balance for FCPDA’s
services of $84,348.00. 
On March 16, 2020, FCPDA
entered into an agreement with Decedent’s older brother, James P. Ashby
(“Ashby”), to provide him transportation and grocery services. Ashby has not
paid and refuses to pay for any of FCPDA’s services, which total $38,516.01.
FCPDA contends that Ashby believed that Decedent and/or her estate would cover
his outstanding invoices. 
On June 2, 2020, Kamerron
Easton (“Easton”) filed a petition for administration of Decedent’s estate.
FCPDA filed its creditor’s claim in Decedent’s estate on July 1, 2020. Easton
was appointed personal representative of Decedent’s estate on April 16, 2021. 
On June 7, 2021, Easton
served a rejection of FCPDA’s creditor’s claim since Easton claims that there
is not enough funds to pay for the claim. 
On July 28, 2021, FCPDA
filed its Complaint against Easton and Ashby on causes of action for: 
1.    
      Breach
of Contract;
2.    
      Breach
of Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing; 
3.    
      Common
Count for Goods and Services; and 
4.    
      Common
Count for Open Book Account. 
On October 15, 2021,
Easton, who is an attorney litigating in propria persona, filed his
Cross-Complaint against FCPDA and Shellydale Princess Gray (“Gray”) alleging
the following causes of action: 
1.    
      Breach
of Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing; 
2.    
      Financial
Elder Abuse; 
3.    
      Violation
of California’s Unfair Competition Law (“UCL”); 
4.    
      Fraud,
Deception, and Concealment; 
5.    
      Negligence;
and 
6.    
      Intentional
Infliction of Emotional Distress. 
On October 22, 2021,
Easton filed his Answer to the Complaint.
On February 8, 2022, the court
sustained in part FCPDA and Gray’s Demurrer to the Cross-Complaint.
Specifically, the court sustained the Demurrer to the first and sixth causes of
action in the Cross-Complaint, for breach of covenant of good faith and fair
dealing and intentional infliction of emotional distress, respectively.
On March 10, 2022, FCPDA
and Gray filed their Answer to the Cross-Complaint.
On May 6, 2022, FCPDA and
Gray filed their Amended Answer to the Cross-Complaint.
On October 7, 2022, Ashby
filed his Answer to the Complaint.
On January 2, 2024, by
request of FCPDA, the Clerk’s Office dismissed with prejudice Ashby from the
Complaint.
On October 17, 2024, Gray
and FCPDA’s counsel, Michael J. Khouri (“Counsel”), filed respective: (1)
MC-051, Motions to be Relieved as Counsel; (2) Declarations of Michael J. Khouri
in Support of Motion to be Relieved as Counsel; and (3) Proofs of Service. 
No
opposition or other response has been filed. 
 
Legal Standard
 
“The
attorney in an action or special proceeding may be changed at any time before
or after judgment or final determination, as follows: [1] Upon the consent of
both client and attorney, filed with the clerk, or entered upon the minutes; [2]
Upon the order of the court, upon the application of either client or attorney,
after notice from one to the other.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 284.)
 
An
attorney moving to be relieved as counsel under California Code of Civil
Procedure section 284(2) must meet the requirements set out in California Rules
of Court, rule 3.1362. 
 
To
comply with rule 3.1362, the moving party must submit the following forms: (1)
Notice of Motion and Motion to be Relieved as Counsel; (2) Declaration in
Support of Attorney's Motion to be Relieved as Counsel; and (3) Order Granting
Attorney's Motion to be Relieved as Counsel. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362(a), (c), (e).) 
 
The
moving party must serve the aforementioned forms on the client and all other
parties who have appeared in the case. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(d).)
Further, when the client is served by mail, the attorney's declaration must
show that the client's address was confirmed within the last 30 days and how it
was confirmed. (Ibid.)  
 
Absent
a showing of resulting prejudice, an attorney’s request for withdrawal should
be granted.  (People v. Prince
(1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398, 406.) 
 
Discussion
 
Counsel’s
Motions to be Relieved as Counsel comply with the requirements of California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, in that Counsel provided notices of motion, motions
to be relieved as counsel, and declarations in support of the motions to be
relieved as counsel. However, Counsel failed to provide proposed orders
granting Counsel’s motions to be relieved as counsel. 
 
            The declarations state that Gray, as an individual and
sole owner of FCPDA, refuses to participate in litigation due to her health
conditions. (Khouri Decl., ¶ 3.) Additionally, Counsel declares that he has
lost contact with Gray and has only been able to communicate with Gray twice in
the past six months. (Ibid.) 
 
            The court determines that the requirements of Rules of
Court Rule 3.1362 enumerated above have not been sufficiently met in that
Counsel failed to provide proposed orders granting Counsel’s motions. Nevertheless,
the court grants the requested withdrawal, conditioned upon the filling of
proposed orders, and effective upon the filing of proof of service showing
service of the signed orders. 
 
Conclusion
 
            Plaintiff and Cross-Defendant’s
Counsel Michael J. Khouri’s Motions to be Relieved as Counsel are GRANTED, subject
to the filling of proposed orders within five (5) days of this order, and effective
upon the filing of proof of service showing service of the signed orders.
