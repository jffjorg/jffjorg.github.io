English-text summary:

The judge issued a tentative ruling in a lawsuit between Steven Li (Plaintiff) and James C. Chou, CJ Max Investments LLC, and Helios Enterprises LLC (Defendants). The lawsuit involves a dispute over a $6,000,000 investment made by Plaintiff in 2012. The parties entered into an Investment Return Agreement, which ended in 2022. Plaintiff alleges that Defendants breached the agreement and unjustly enriched themselves, and he seeks an accounting and damages.

The judge overruled the defendants' demurrer (a legal objection) to the fourth cause of action (accounting) and sustained the demurrer to the third cause of action (unjust enrichment) and the eighth cause of action (negligence). The judge also ordered the Plaintiff to dismiss the fifth cause of action within five days.

The judge's ruling is based on the allegations in the Plaintiff's First Amended Complaint (FAC) and the parties' previous agreements. The FAC alleges that the parties entered into a fiduciary and contractual relationship, and that Plaintiff is entitled to an accounting and damages. The judge found that the Plaintiff's FAC is not so uncertain that the Defendants cannot reasonably respond.

The judge's tentative ruling will be discussed further at a hearing on November 26, 2024.
