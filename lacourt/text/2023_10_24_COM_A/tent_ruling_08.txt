[TENTATIVE]
ORDER CONTINUING
 THE HEARING ON PETITION FOR CHANGE OF NAME
 
Petitioner, Valeria
 Citlalli Leyva, a minor, by and through her mother, Gabriela C. Huitzil,
filed this Petition for an Order for Change of Name to Valeria
 Citlalli Barrera.  
            Since only one
parent consented to the name change, Petitioner is required to serve the other
parent with the Order to Show Cause at least 30 days before the hearing. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 1277(a)(4).) The OSC shall be personally served on the other
parent if that parent resides in California. (Id.) Service outside
California may be accomplished by mail, return receipt requested. Code Civ. Proc., § 415.40 Petitioner
shall file the proof of service with the court prior to the hearing date.
            Petitioner is
required to make diligent efforts to locate the other parent. If the other
parent cannot be located, Petitioner shall file a supplemental declaration stating
what attempts were made to locate the other parent and why service cannot be
reasonably accomplished. The supplemental declaration shall be filed no less
than 10 court days before the continued hearing date. Additionally, the Court’s
file does not reflect that Petitioner has complied with the requirements for
publication of the Order to Show Cause. Code Civ. Proc., § 1277. 
            Accordingly, the Court
continues the hearing to December 7, 2023,
at 8:30 a.m. in Department A of the Compton Courthouse. Petitioner is ordered
to comply with the foregoing requirements.
