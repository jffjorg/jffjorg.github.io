And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge in a lawsuit between L.V. and the Compton Unified School District. L.V. alleges that she was sexually abused as a child by an employee of the school district and is seeking damages for negligence and negligent hiring, retention, and supervision. The school district demurs to all claims, arguing that Assembly Bill 218, which revived claims previously barred, is unconstitutional and constitutes a gift of public funds. The judge denies the school district's motion for judgment on the pleadings, finding that the revival of claims is not a gift of public funds and that L.V. has an enforceable claim. The judge also rejects the school district's argument that L.V. did not have an enforceable claim because she did not present a government claim.
