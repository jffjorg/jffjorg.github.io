And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the petition for a change of name submitted by Maria del Carmen Romo Duardo, who wishes to shorten her name and add her husband's name. However, the court's file does not reflect that the petitioner has complied with the requirements for publication of the Order to Show Cause, as mandated by Code Civ. Proc., ยง 1277. Therefore, the court is continuing the hearing to December 7, 2023, at 8:30 a.m. in Department A of the Compton Courthouse. Prior to the new hearing date, the petitioner is ordered to comply with the publication requirements.
