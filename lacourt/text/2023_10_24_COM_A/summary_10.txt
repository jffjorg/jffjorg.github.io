The Plaintiff alleges 16 causes of action for breach of implied warranty of habitability and related claims, and is now seeking to add claims for unlawful lockout, denial of a pre-move out inspection, bad faith retention of deposit, unlawful entry, and assault and battery. The Judge finds that the proposed new claims arose after the date the complaint was filed and do not prejudice the Defendant. The Judge grants the motion, ordering the Plaintiff to file and serve the amended complaint forthwith.
