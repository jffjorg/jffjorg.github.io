And here is the English summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Briana Garcia v. General Motors, LLC, continuing the hearing on the Plaintiff's motion to compel the deposition attendance of a person most qualified and custodian of records of Defendant General Motors. The Plaintiff purchased a vehicle from the Defendant, which suffered from widespread defects that the Defendant failed to repair within a reasonable number of attempts, violating the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act. The Defendant has refused to produce a witness and has made boilerplate objections to the Plaintiff's discovery requests. The Judge has ordered the parties to meet and confer with the Court's prior rulings in mind, and to file a joint statement of items remaining in dispute. The Judge has also ordered the parties to comply with the Court's "Addendum to Case Management Conference Order (Song-Beverly Litigation) regarding Discovery." The hearing has been continued to November 15, 2023, at 8:30 a.m. in Department A of the Compton Courthouse.
