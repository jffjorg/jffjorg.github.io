And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling sustaining the demurrer to the cross-defendants' answer to the cross-complaint and granting the motion to strike the affirmative defenses. The cross-defendants' answer fails to state sufficient facts to constitute a defense and is deemed to be a futile attempt to rehash their previous demurrer to the cross-complaint. The judge has also denied the cross-defendants' request for leave to amend their answer. The decision is based on the fact that the cross-defendants' affirmative defenses do not raise any new matter or recognized affirmative defenses, but rather simply deny the allegations in the cross-complaint or assert that the cross-complaint is unclear or that the cross-defendants did not engage in the acts alleged. The judge has also granted the motion to strike the affirmative defenses at issue, finding that they are irrelevant and improper and not filed in conformity with the laws of California.
