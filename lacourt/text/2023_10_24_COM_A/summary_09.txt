And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a Tentative Ruling in the case of Atlas VI JCP Carson, LLC v. Khaled I. Azzam, et al. The Plaintiff, Atlas VI JCP Carson, LLC, has filed an application for a writ of attachment against the Defendants, Khaled I. Azzam and Metro Fusion, Inc.

The Court has denied the Plaintiff's application for a writ of attachment against Metro Fusion, Inc. because the Plaintiff has not established that Metro Fusion, Inc. is liable for the damages claimed. The Plaintiff has established that Khaled I. Azzam, the tenant, is liable for the damages, and the Court has granted the Plaintiff's application for a writ of attachment against him.

The Court has also ordered the Plaintiff to post an undertaking of $10,000 within ten days. The undertaking is a security deposit that the Plaintiff must post in case the Court later determines that the writ of attachment was issued incorrectly.

The Court has based its decision on the pleadings and other papers in the record, as well as the arguments presented by the parties. The Court has found that the Plaintiff has established that a writ of attachment may issue as the complaint is one for contract damages, and that the amount to be secured is greater than zero. However, the Court has found that the Plaintiff has not established that Metro Fusion, Inc. is liable for the damages claimed, and therefore has denied the application for a writ of attachment against that entity.
