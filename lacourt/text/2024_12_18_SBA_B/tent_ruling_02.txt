BACKGROUND
On May 3, 2024, plaintiff Sherryl
Martov filed a complaint against E. Robbie Robinson IV aka Robbie Robinson for
motor vehicle negligence and general negligence based on an incident that
occurred on April 23, 2023, at Skypark Drive and Hawthorne Blvd., in Torrance. 
On September 19, 2024, defendant
filed an answer.
Trial is scheduled for April 13,
2026.
LEGAL AUTHORITY
CCP §36 states, in relevant
part:  “(a) A party to a civil action who
is over 70 years of age may petition the court for a preference, which the
court shall grant if the court makes both of the following findings:  (1) The party has a substantial interest in
the action as whole.  (2) The health of
the party is such that a preference is necessary to prevent prejudicing the
party’s interest in the litigation. . . . (c) 
Unless the court otherwise orders: 
(1)  A party may file and serve a
motion for preference supported by a declaration of the moving party that all
essential parties have been served with process or have appeared. (2)  At any time during the pendency of the
action, a party who reaches 70 years of age may file and serve a motion for
preference. . . . (e) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the court may
in its discretion grant a motion for preference that is supported by a showing
that satisfies the court that the interests of justice will be served by
granting this preference.  (f) Upon the
granting of such a motion for preference, the court shall set the matter for
trial not more than 120 days from that date. . . .” 
            CCP §36.5 states, “An affidavit
submitted in support of a motion for preference under subdivision (a) of
Section 36 may be signed by the attorney for the party seeking preference based
upon information and belief as to the medical diagnosis and prognosis of any
party.  The affidavit is not admissible
for any purpose other than a motion for preference under subdivision (a) of
Section 36.” 
            “Failure to complete discovery or
other pretrial matters does not affect the absolute substantive right to trial
preference for those litigants who qualify for preference under subdivision (a)
of Section 36 . . . . The express legislative mandate for trial preference is a
substantive public policy concern which supersedes such considerations.”  Swaithes v. Superior Court (1989) 212
Cal. App. 3d 1082, 1086-87 (citation omitted).
DISCUSSION
            Under CCP §36(a), plaintiff Sherryl
Martov requests an order granting a trial preference and specially setting the
trial date within 120 days from the date of the order.
            Plaintiff asserts that she is 77 years
old, born on January 27, 1947.  She has a
substantial interest in the action as a whole as this is a personal injury case.  She contends that she was rearended by
defendant.  According to plaintiff’s
counsel’s declaration, plaintiff suffers from coronary artery disease (cardiac
arrest in 2018 and four heart surgeries, irregular heartbeat, numerous episodes
of dizziness, and has a pacemaker), stage 2 kidney disease, emphysema,
hypertension, immunodeficiency, chronic pain, and mild cognitive issues.  Counsel attests that plaintiff’s age and
health are such that it is becoming increasingly difficult for her to meet the
demands of litigation and trial and plaintiff’s ability to communicate, focus,
read, and be as responsive as necessary to participate in this litigation and
trial preparation continues to decline. 
See Kristopher O’ Connell decl. 
            In opposition, defendant argues that
plaintiff has failed to comply with CCP §36(c) that all essential parties have
been served or appeared.  Defendant also
contends that plaintiff has failed to establish that she is over 70 years of
age by competent evidence.  Defendant
further argues that plaintiff has failed to evidence that her health is such
that a preference is necessary to prevent prejudicing her interest in the
litigation and that she has not shown any medical diagnosis or prognosis.  Defendant asserts that plaintiff’s discovery
responses indicate that she is experiencing continued pain and discomfort and
that she “only requires further treatment in her right knee and back” and she
is “feeling improved” and semi-retired and “apparently still working.”  Defendant also argues that he will be
prejudiced if the motion is granted because he has not yet had the opportunity
to obtain all medical records and is set to conduct a vehicle inspection, IME,
and deposition in January 2025.
            In reply, plaintiff contends that
defendant concedes that discovery is well underway and that this case is a
straightforward vehicle negligence case. 
Plaintiff’s counsel states in a supplemental declaration that to the
extent it is required, “all essential parties have been served and
appeared.”  Plaintiff’s counsel also
attaches a copy of a portion of plaintiff’s responses to form interrogatories
in which she attests that her birthdate is January 27, 1947.
            The Court rules as follows:  The Court finds that plaintiff is over 70
years old.  She has a substantial
interest in the action as whole. 
Further, the health of plaintiff is such that a preference is necessary
to prevent prejudicing the party’s interest in the litigation.
            The motion is thus GRANTED.
