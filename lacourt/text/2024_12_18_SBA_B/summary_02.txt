And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion for trial preference, setting the trial for a date within 120 days from the date of the order. The plaintiff, Sherryl Martov, is 77 years old and suffers from various medical conditions, including coronary artery disease, stage 2 kidney disease, and chronic pain. The judge found that Martov has a substantial interest in the action as whole and that her health is such that a preference is necessary to prevent prejudicing her interest in the litigation. The defendant, Robbie Robinson IV, opposed the motion, arguing that Martov has failed to comply with CCP ยง36(c) and has not established that she is over 70 years of age. However, the judge found that Martov has met the requirements for trial preference and granted the motion.
