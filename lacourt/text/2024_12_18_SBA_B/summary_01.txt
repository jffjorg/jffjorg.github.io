And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted plaintiff Joselyn L. Marquez's motion to compel further responses to defendant Adonnis Alexander Andrade's objection-only responses to plaintiff's Demand for Production of Documents, Set One. The judge finds that defendant Andrade's objections are without merit and that plaintiff has shown good cause to support the motion. The judge orders defendant Andrade to serve a further verified response without objections to plaintiff's demand and to produce all documents and things in his possession, custody, or control that are responsive to plaintiff's demand, within 20 days. The judge also denies plaintiff's request for $860 in sanctions, as it was not properly noticed as required by law.
