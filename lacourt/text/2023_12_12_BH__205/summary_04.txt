And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the demurrer filed by Kone Inc. will be continued to January 8, 2024. Kone Inc. argues that it is solely a maintenance and repair company and cannot be liable for premises liability because it is not a property owner, occupier, or lessor, and it does not own the subject elevator. However, the judge finds that Kone Inc. failed to meet and confer with the plaintiff before filing the demurrer, as required by California Code of Civil Procedure § 430.41. The judge instructs Kone Inc.'s counsel to file a supplemental declaration that complies with the requirements of §430.41.
