 Case Number:  23SMCV02388    Hearing Date:   December 12, 2023    Dept:  205 Superior Court of California County of Los Angeles – West District  Beverly Hills Courthouse / Department 205   LORENZO CERULLO,  Plaintiff, v.  CVS PHARMACY, INC., et al.,   Defendants.    Case No.:  23SMCV02388     Hearing Date:  December 12, 2023   ORDER RE:   DEFENDANT KONE INC.’S    DEMURRER TO COMPLAINT  Plaintiff Lorenzo Cerullo was entering an elevator at a CVS pharmacy when he was crushed by the elevator doors.  He claims he sustained severe injuries to his body, requiring ongoing medical treatment.   

The operative complaint includes a single claim for premises liability against Defendants CVS Pharmacy Inc., Stone Haven Partners, L.P. and Kone Inc. This hearing is on Defendant Kone Inc.’s demurrer to the complaint.  Kone argues it is solely a maintenance and repair company and cannot be liable for premises liability because it is not a property owner, occupier or lessor, and it does not own the subject elevator.   Code Civ. Proc. § 430.41 requires that before the filing of a demurrer the moving party “shall meet and confer in person or by telephone” with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve the objections to be raised in the demurrer.  (Code Civ. Proc. § 430.41(a).)  The parties are to meet and confer at least five days before the date the responsive pleading is due. (Code Civ. Proc. § 430.41(a)(2).)  Thereafter, the moving party shall file and serve a declaration detailing their meet and confer efforts. (Code Civ. Proc. § 430.41(a)(3).)  Defendant submits the Declaration of Timothy Noon, which shows the parties failed to meet and confer “in person or by telephone.”  Kone’s counsel merely sent a letter, without any attempts to call opposing counsel.   The Court will continue the hearing on the demurrer to January 8, 2024 at 9:00 a.m.  Kone’s counsel is instructed to file a supplemental declaration that complies with the requirements of §430.41.  DATED:  December 12, 2023
