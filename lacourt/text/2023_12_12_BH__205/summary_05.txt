English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling on a demurrer to the second amended complaint in a slander of title action. The plaintiff, 9450 Topanga Properties, LLC, alleges that the defendant, NYGARD FOUNDATION, et al., slandered its title by recording a Deed of Trust with Assignment of Rents without its knowledge or authority. The defendant argues that the slander of title claim fails because the plaintiff has not pled malice, publication, and proximate cause. The court agrees and sustains the demurrer with 20 days' leave to amend.

The court also finds that the quiet title claim is uncertain and sustains the demurrer with leave to amend. The court notes that the plaintiff's complaint does not adequately plead the claim and that the remedy being sought is unclear.

The court orders that the demurrer be sustained with 20 days' leave to amend and that the parties may meet and confer to determine whether an agreement can be reached to resolve the objections to be raised in the demurrer.
