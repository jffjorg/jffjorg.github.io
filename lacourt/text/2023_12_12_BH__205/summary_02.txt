And here is the English text summary:

This is a tentative ruling on a motion to bifurcate the trial in a case between CIVIC CENTER WAY, LLC (CCW) and TIBOR KELEMEN, et al. The case arises from a dispute between CCW and Third Point Land Company LLC, the seller of undeveloped land in the City of Malibu. CCW alleges that Third Point concealed a Notice of Violation from the City of Malibu, which found violations of environmental regulations, and seeks to rescind the sale. The defendants, including Kelemen Company LLC and Tibor Kelemen, argue that bifurcation is mandatory under Civil Code §3295(d) to prevent the admission of evidence of their wealth and financial condition during the liability phase of the trial. The court agrees and grants the motion to bifurcate the trial, citing the need to avoid juror confusion and potential prejudice to the defendants.
