ALLEGATIONS: 
 
Abimelec Burgos (Plaintiff) brings action against General
Motors, LLC (GM) for GM’s alleged violation of the Song Beverly Act. The
Complaint alleges five causes of action for (1) violation of Civil Code §
1793.2(d), (2) violation of Civil Code § 1793.2(b), (3) violation of Civil Code
§ 1793.2(a)(3), (4) breach of express written warranty, and (5) breach of the
implied warranty of merchantability. 
 
Before the Court is motion by Plaintiff to recover attorney
fees in the amount of $47,120.50. GM opposes and Plaintiff replies.  
  
ANALYSIS: 
 
I.                   
LEGAL
STANDARD 
 
A prevailing party in an action under the Song-Beverly Act
may be entitled to attorney's fees. (Civ. Code § 1794(d); see also C.C.P. §
1032(a)(4).) 
 
The calculation of attorney's fees under the Song-Beverly
Act is based on the lodestar method, which multiplies the number of hours
reasonably expended by a reasonable hourly rate. (Graciano v. Robinson Ford
Sales (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 140, 154; Robertson v. Fleetwood Travel
Trailers of California, Inc. (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 785, 817-819.)
Nonetheless, the prevailing party should not receive a "windfall"
through an award of reasonable attorney's fees. (Ketchum v. Moses (2001)
24 Cal.4th 1122, 1132.) Thus, a prevailing buyer under the Song-Beverly Act has
the burden of "showing that the fees incurred were 'allowable,' were
'reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation,' and were 'reasonable
in amount." (Levy v. Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc. (1992) 4
Cal.App.4th 807, 816.) 
 
Once an attorney has presented evidence of her or his
actual time spent and hourly rate charged, the time and hourly rate are
presumed to be reasonable. (Mandel v. Lackner (1979) 92 Cal.App.3d 747,
761.) An award of attorney fees may be based on counsel's declarations, without
production of detailed time records. (Raining Data Corp. v. Barrenechea
(2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 1363, 1375.) The verified time statements of attorneys,
as officers of the court, are entitled to credence in the absence of a clear
indication the records are erroneous. (Horsford v. Board of Trustees of
California State University (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 359, 396.)
 
II.                
MERITS 
 
In opposing this motion, GM argues (1) much of the time
billed by Plaintiff’s counsel was not reasonably incurred and (2) that
Plaintiff’s counsel has not demonstrated its rates are reasonable. The Court
will address each of these arguments in turn. 
 
Reasonable Hours Billed
 
Absent circumstances rendering an award unjust, an award of
attorney's fees should ordinarily include compensation for all hours reasonably
spent, including those relating solely to obtaining the fee award. (See Ketchum
vs. Moses supra, 24 Cal.4th at p. 1133.) The prevailing party has the
burden to present verified time records showing the hours spent on the case,
but once properly submitted, such records are "entitled to credence in the
absence of a clear indication the records are erroneous." (Horsford v.
Board of Trustees (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 359, 396.) Nonetheless, "[a]
trial court may not rubber stamp a request for attorney fees, but must
determine the number of hours reasonably expended." (Donahue v. Donahue
(2010) 182 Cal.App.4th 259, 271-272.)
 
Where a party is challenging the reasonableness of
attorney's fees as excessive that party must attack itemized billing with
evidence that the fees claimed were not appropriate or obtain the declaration
of an attorney with expertise in the procedural and substantive law to
demonstrate that the fees claimed were unreasonable. (Premier Medical
Management Systems, Inc. v. California Ins. Guarantee Assn. (2008) 163
Cal.App.4th 550, 563-64.) A reduced award might be fully justified by a general
observation that an attorney over litigated a case or submitted a padded bill
or that the opposing party has stated valid objections. (Gorman v. Tassajara
Development Corp. (2009) 178 Cal.App.4th 44, 101.)
 
Here, Plaintiff has submitted billing entries of the attorneys
and paralegals who worked on this case as Exhibit 12. It appears that a total
of 128.7 hours were billed in this matters for a total of $42,120.50, including
the time billed in bringing this motion. (Manno Decl. Exh. 12.) The billing
entries are split between attorney Alessandro Manno (Manno) (at rate of $400
per hour), attorney Nancy Zhang (Zhang) (at a rate of $525 per hour), and
paralegal Robert Aguilar (Aguilar) (at a rate of $210 per hour). (Id.) 
 
The vast majority of GM’s argument is that the hours billed
in relation to propounding discovery and bringing discovery related motions are
unreasonably inflated. GM argues that Plaintiff’s counsel relies substantially
upon templates in both creating its discovery requests and bringing motions to
compel. (Kay Decl. ¶ 6.) GM contends that many of the entries related to
discovery should be reduced by considerable amounts, in most cases over 75%.
(See Oppo. pgs. 9-11.) GM extends this argument to the documents prepared for
trial and Plaintiff’s motions in limine. 
 
The Court acknowledges that several of the discovery
related entries appear to be unreasonable in duration. It can be easily
observed that the discovery propounded in this case echoes the discovery
Plaintiff’s counsel regularly propounds in Song-Beverly matters, both in form
and content. At the same time, the use of templating is a legal reality which
appears to the Court inescapable. Although Plaintiff’s counsel undoubtedly used
some form of templating in propounding discovery in this matter, it does not follow
that their efforts were trivial. 
 
As with many things, the Court finds the reasonable amount
of hours likely lies somewhere in the middle. The Court will reduce the number
of hours billed in connection to discovery, but not in the drastic amount GM
requests. These reductions are listed below: 
 
·        
December 19 & 28, 2022 and February 12,
2024: Drafting Discovery/Deposition (Manno Decl., Exh. 12 pgs. 53, 51, 16.)
 
o  
Manno: reduced from 2.7 hours to 1.2 hours. 
o  
Zhang: reduced from 1.2 hours to 0.8 hours. 
 
·        
March 3 & 17, 2023: Drafting Meet and
Confer Correspondence (Manno Decl., Exh. 12 pgs. 41-42.)
 
o  
Manno: reduced from 2.1 hours to 1 hour. 
 
·        
April 15, 2024, June 26, 2024, and July 3
& 5, 2024: Drafting Motion to Compel Deposition of GM’s PMK (Manno Decl.,
Exh. 12, pgs. 9-11 & 13.) 
 
o  
Manno: reduced from 6.2 hours to 4 hours. 
 
·        
March 20, 2023, April 13, 20 & 21, 2023:
Drafting Motions to Compel Further Responses to Requests for Production (Manno
Decl., Exh. 12, pgs. 38-33.)
 
o  
Manno: reduced from 10.7 hours to 3.2 hours. 
o  
Zhang: reduced from 1.2 hours to 0.8 hours. 
 
·        
November 29, 2023, December 1 & 12, 2023,
January 8 & 29, 2024 and February 1 & 9, 2024: Drafting Motion to
Compel Compliance (Manno Decl. Exh. 12, pgs. 26, 24, 17-19.) 
 
o  
Manno: reduced from 5.6 hours to 1.4 hours. 
o  
Zhang: reduced from 1.1 hours to 0.6 hours. 
 
 
·        
December 26, 2023, February 23, 2024, and
July 9-10 & 15-16, 2024: Drafting Trial Documents (Manno Decl. Exh. 12,
pgs. 7-9, 15 & 22.) 
 
o  
Manno: reduced from 8.9 hours to 6 hours. 
 
·        
December 20, 2023: Drafting Motions in Limine
(Manno Decl., Exh. 12, p. 23.)
 
o  
Manno: reduced from 4.7 hours to 2 hours. 
 
GM further argues that the entirety of the 12.2 hours
billed by paralegal Aguilar should be stricken because it consists of clerical
work not befitting the expertise of a paralegal. GM then goes on to argue that
Plaintiff’s paralegal engaged in “block billing”, thereby preventing a
determination as to what work performed was appropriate for a paralegal. The
billing entries under Aguilar appear reasonably particularized. For example, on
February 12, 2024, Aguilar billed .2 hours to review, format, finalize, and
draft the proof of service for Plaintiff’s Amended Notice of Deposition. (Manno
Decl., Exh. 12, p. 16.) Further still, necessary overhead support services that
secretaries and paralegals provide to attorneys may be included in an attorney
fees award. (City of Oakland v. McCullough (1996) 46 Cal.App.4th 1, 7.)
As such, the Court declines to strike or reduce the billing entries for the
paralegal work. 
 
GM further argues that the 4 hours billed in drafting a
repair chronology should also be stricken. GM argues that this task could be
easily performed by a paralegal and thus should not be billed at the attorney
rate. The Court finds this unpersuasive. GM’s declaration is silent as to the
complexity of a repair chronology and the work performed on November 30, 2022,
December 13, 2022, March 5 & 17, 2023 and April 4, 2024. Without evidence
to the contrary, Plaintiff’s submissions are presumably valid. The Court
declines to exercise its discretion to strike or reduce the billing entries for
the repair chronology. 
 
Lastly, the Court finds a reduction of the amount of
billable hours in connection with the instant motion should be reduced.
Plaintiff’s counsel appears to have billed 11.9 hours in the preparation of
this motion. (Manno Decl., Ex. 12, pgs. 1-6.) Although this motion is quite
lengthy (Plaintiff’s declaration/exhibits total 756 pages), the Court finds the
bulk of the material presented is duplicative of previous filings in this case.
It appears to the Court that the vast majority of effort in drafting this motion
was incurred in compiling discovery and related motions, compiling court orders
for attorney’s fees in other cases, and attaching the billable hours. In the
Court’s estimation these tasks did not reasonably necessitate 11.9 hours of
attorney work from Plaintiff’s counsel Manno. As such, the hours are reduced
from 11.9 hours to 4 hours. 
 
In short, the Court exercises its discretion in reducing
the billable hours from 128.7 to 97.4 (a total reduction of 33.3 hours.) This
reflects a total reduction from 9.9 hours to 8.6 hours for work attributable to
Zhang, and a reduction from 106.6 hours to 76.6 hours for work attributable to
Manno. 
 
Reasonable Rates 
 
GM argues that
Plaintiff has failed to uphold his burden to demonstrate the hourly rates of
his counsel are reasonable, instead substituting a number of trial court orders
approving motions for attorney’s fees were the moving party claimed a similar
rate. GM argues that Plaintiff should be required to demonstrate their rates
are reasonable within the scope of the local legal community. 
 
The Court does find a
reduction in the hourly rate is warranted based on the showing Plaintiff has
made. The declaration of Plaintiff’s attorney Manno reflects that he has been
litigating Song-Beverly matters since August 2022, shortly before this case started.
(Manno Decl. ¶ 33.) In the Court’s experience, attorneys with such
relatively limited experience in a new area of law cannot reasonably expect to
bill at a rate of $380 per hour. Based on its experience and expertise, the
Court finds a reasonable rate for Manno in the pendency of this litigation
would be no more than $325 per hour. 
 
As concerns the
entries billed by Plaintiff’s attorney Zhang, the Court finds Plaintiff showing
as to the rate of $500 per hours is insufficient. While Manno explains that
Zhang is a senior partner who has been litigating Song-Beverly cases since
2017, the fact remains that the $500 per hour rate is far above average. (Manno
Decl. ¶ 32.) As such the Court finds a reasonable rate for the Zhang would
be no more than $400 per hour for the complexity of these cases.  
 
Conclusion 
 
The motion for
attorney fees is GRANTED in the reduced amount of $30,897.  Given that this is a contingency case, the
court will apply a multiplier of 1.2 for total attorney’s fees of $37,076.40.  
 
This amount reflects 76.6
hours of work by Manno at a rate of $325 per hour ($24,895), 8.6 hours of work
by Zhang at a rate of $400 per hour ($3,440), and 12.2 hours of work by
paralegal Aguilar at a rate of $210 per hour ($2,562).
