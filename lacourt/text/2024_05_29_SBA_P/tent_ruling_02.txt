No oppositions or reply papers have been filed as of May 24, 2024.RULINGDefendant Vortex’s Demurrer to the First Amended Complaint is SUSTAINED without leave to amend.BACKGROUNDPlaintiff alleges it leased commercial premises to Defendants pursuant to a written lease agreement. Plaintiff served Defendants with a 3-day notice to perform covenants or quit on June 30, 2021. Plaintiff alleges Defendants maintained a cannabis business or activity in violation of Los Angeles County Code.On December 16, 2022, Plaintiff filed a complaint for unlawful detainer. On March 14, 2024, the Court sustained demurrer to the complaint with 20 days leave to amend. On March 25, Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint for unlawful detainer.On April 15, 2024, Defendant Vortex filed a demurrer to the FAC. No opposition or reply has been filed as of May 24, 2024.LEGAL AUTHORITYWhen considering demurrers, courts read the allegations liberally and in context. (Taylor v. City of Los Angeles Dept. of Water and Power (2006) 144 Cal. App. 4th 1216, 1228.) “A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters. Therefore, it lies only where the defects appear on the face of the pleading or are judicially noticed.” (SKF Farms v. Superior Court (1984) 153 Cal. App. 3d 902, 905.) “The only issue involved in a demurrer hearing is whether the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous matters, states a cause of action.” (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal. App. 4th 740, 747.) The court assumes the truth of the complaint’s properly pleaded or implied factual allegations. (E-Fab, Inc. v. Accountants, Inc. Servs. (2007) 153 Cal.App.4th 1308, 1315.) On demurrer, courts assume the truth of all well-pled factual allegations in the subject pleading, “shorn of any legal conclusions.” (Fuller v. First Franklin Financial Corp. (2013) 216 Cal.App.4th 955, 959.)DISCUSSIONDefendant Vortex demurs to the FAC on grounds that the 3-day Notice to Perform Covenants or Quit was served with insufficient notice. Defendant Vortex argues that the lease agreement requires that all notices be served with five days’ notice, including a Notice to Perform or Quit pursuant to CCP §1161(3). Defendant argues the Plaintiff must make some affirmative showing that this defect in notice can be cured or face demurrer without leave to amend. Defendant argues Plaintiff will be unable to cure this defect and asks that demurrer be sustained without leave to amend.Exhibit A to the FAC is the written lease agreement between Plaintiff and Defendant Vortex. (FAC, Ex. A.) Pursuant to ¶14 of the Lease Agreement, in the event of Vortex’s default, Plaintiff “may give Lessee notice of such default and if Lessee does not cure any suchdefault within 05 days, after the giving of such notice..., then Lessor may terminate this lease on not less than 05 days’ notice to Lessee.” (FAC, Ex. A, ¶14.)The language of paragraph 14 is permissive, not mandatory. Plaintiff “may” provide a 5-day notice to cure or quit. Such language is insufficient to supersede the mandatory language of CCP §1161(3) or to require Plaintiff to provide Vortex with a 5-day notice to perform or quit. “In commercial leases the landlord and commercial tenant may lawfully agree to notice procedures that differ from those provided in the statutory provisions governing unlawful detainer. Thus, if the lease contains service requirements for the notice to quit at variance with the requirements in the unlawful detainer statutes, the lease provisions control.” (Culver Center Partners East #1, L.P. v. Baja Fresh Westlake Village, Inc. (2010) 185 Cal.App.4th 744, 750.) Paragraph 14 does not require Plaintiff to give Defendant a notice of a default, but, if he does, the parties agreed that Defendant had five days to cure a default. Because the lease provisions control and Plaintiff did not comply with those provisions, the three-day notice was invalid.Defendant Vortex’s demurrer based on failure to state a cause of action for unlawful detainer is SUSTAINED.A valid Notice to Quit is jurisdictional in an Unlawful Detainer case. Because the Notice in this action is deficient, there is no basis by which the complaint can be amended. Therefore, the Demurrer is SUSTAINED without leave to amend.ORDERDefendant Vortex’s Demurrer to the FAC is SUSTAINED. Defendant Vortex is ordered to give notice and to file a proposed judgment consistent with this ruling.
