And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving a hotel guest who claims to have suffered bedbug bites during a stay at a Hilton hotel. The guest, Anthony Soriano, is suing the hotel and its parent companies, Hilton Worldwide, Inc. and Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc., alleging that the hotel was aware of the bedbug infestation but failed to take action to eradicate it. The hotel has filed a demurrer, arguing that the guest's claims do not state facts sufficient to support causes of action for battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and fraudulent concealment. The judge has sustained the demurrer in its entirety, finding that the guest's allegations do not demonstrate the hotel's knowledge of the infestation or intent to cause harm.
