And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has considered the demurrer filed by Defendant Vortex to the First Amended Complaint. The demurrer was sustained without leave to amend. The Plaintiff alleged that it leased commercial premises to the Defendants and served them with a 3-day notice to perform covenants or quit. The Plaintiff also alleged that the Defendants maintained a cannabis business or activity in violation of Los Angeles County Code. The Court found that the 3-day notice was invalid because it did not comply with the mandatory language of CCP ยง1161(3) and the lease agreement. As a result, the Plaintiff failed to state a cause of action for unlawful detainer. The Court also found that the Plaintiff did not cure the defect in notice and that the demurrer was sustained without leave to amend.
