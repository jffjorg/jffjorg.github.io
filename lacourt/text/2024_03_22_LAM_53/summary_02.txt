And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the amended complaint and has noted that a single incident of harassing conduct can create a triable issue regarding the existence of a hostile work environment. In this case, the plaintiff has alleged that customers directed gender-based profanity towards her on multiple occasions, which allegedly interfered with her work performance and created a hostile work environment. The court has tentatively ruled that this behavior may be sufficient to support the plaintiff's claims of a hostile work environment.
