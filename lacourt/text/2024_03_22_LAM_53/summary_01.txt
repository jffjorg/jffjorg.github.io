English-text summary:

In this tentative ruling, Judge Robert B. Broadbelt III addresses the demurrer to the second amended complaint filed by Romina Zerpa against Walmart, Inc., et al. The court sustains the demurrer of defendants Tiffani Medina-Khuu and Katherine Whatley, finding that the allegations do not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action for harassment. However, the court overrules the demurrer of defendants Walmart, Inc., et al., finding that the allegations do state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action for harassment, as Walmart Defendants may be responsible for the acts of nonemployees under the Fair Employment and Housing Act. Specifically, the court finds that the use of gender-based profanity directed toward Plaintiff constitutes harassment on the basis of her sex or gender.
