[Tentative]
  Order RE:
 
plaintiff’s motion to deem admissions
  admitted and request for sanctions
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                Plaintiff Immigrant Rights
Defense Council, LLC
 
RESPONDING PARTY:        Unopposed
Motion to Deem Admissions Admitted and Request for Sanctions
The court
considered the moving papers filed in connection with this motion.  No opposition papers were filed. 
DISCUSSION
Plaintiff Immigrant Rights Defense Council, LLC (“Plaintiff”) moves
the court for an order (1) deeming admitted the truth of the matters specified
in its Requests for Admission, Set One, served on defendant Agencia Privada de
Inmigracion, Inc. (“Defendant”), and (2) awarding monetary sanctions in its favor
and against Defendant in the amount of $2,578.35.
If
a party to whom requests for admission are directed fails to serve a timely
response, the court shall, upon motion by the propounding party, order that the
matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted unless the court finds
that the party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has served
substantially compliant responses before the hearing on the motion.¿ (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.280, subds. (b), (c).)¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
Plaintiff served Defendant with its Requests for Admissions, Set One,
on December 28, 2023, by mail.  (Medvei
Decl., Ex. 1, p. 24 [proof of service].) 
Defendant did not serve timely responses and had not served responses as
of the date that Plaintiff filed this motion. 
(Medvei Decl., ¶ 5.) 
Defendant did not file an opposition brief or other evidence with the
court establishing that responses have since been served.  The court therefore grants Plaintiff’s
motion.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280,
subd. (c).) 
The court grants Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd.
(c).)  The court finds that $1,078 ((2
hours x $500 hourly rate) + $78.35 filing fees) is a reasonable amount of
sanctions to impose against Defendant in connection with this motion.  (Medvei Decl., ¶ 6.) 
ORDER
The court grants plaintiff Immigrant Rights Defense Council, LLC’s
motion to deem admissions admitted and for sanctions. 
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.280, subdivision (b),
the court orders that the truth of the matters specified in plaintiff Immigrant
Rights Defense Council, LLC’s Request for Admissions, Set One, served on
defendant Agencia Privada de Inmigracion, Inc., is deemed admitted. 
The court orders defendant Agencia Privada de Inmigracion, Inc. to pay
monetary sanctions to plaintiff Immigrant Rights Defense Council, LLC in the
amount of $1,078 within 30 days of the date of service of this order. 
 
 
 
 
 
The court orders plaintiff Immigrant Rights Defense Council, LLC to
give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
 
DATED:  March 22, 2024
