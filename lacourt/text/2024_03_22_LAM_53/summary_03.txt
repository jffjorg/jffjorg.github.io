And here is a brief English summary of the Tentative Ruling:

The court denies the plaintiff's motion to dismiss the cross-complaint for forum non conveniens. The plaintiff, Laundrylux Funding Services, LLC, sought to dismiss the cross-complaint filed by defendants Cleotilda Ortiz and Jose Alberto Castro, citing the doctrine of forum non conveniens. However, the court finds that the defendants' demand for a jury trial and posting of jury fees in California courts outweighs the potential inconvenience of litigating in New York courts. Additionally, the court determines that the mandatory forum selection clause in the Secured Promissory Note and Agreement is enforceable and requires the defendants to litigate their claims in New York courts. As a result, the court denies the plaintiff's motion and allows the cross-complaint to proceed in California courts.
