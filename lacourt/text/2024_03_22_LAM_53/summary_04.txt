And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in response to a motion filed by Zachary McCready, the counsel for defendant Intercity Fellowship Hall, to be relieved as counsel for the defendant. The judge has found that the motion is moot because the defendant has already filed a "Substitution of Attorney – Civil" form stating that it is substituting in as its own counsel. However, the judge has noted that the defendant is a corporation and therefore cannot represent itself in court. As a result, the judge has ordered an "Order to Show Cause" to be set for June 10, 2024, to determine why the defendant's answer should not be stricken for lack of representation by counsel.
