```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendants' motion to remove the lis pendens against their property. The defendants, John Zhong and Catherine Li, argue that the City of Diamond Bar's notice of lis pendens is without legal authority, but fail to address Government Code section 65908, which allows the City to file a notice of lis pendens in zoning enforcement actions. The court has discretion to remove the lis pendens if the defendants make an appropriate showing of need, but they failed to do so. The defendants' claim that the lis pendens hampers legitimate property transactions is insufficient, as every lis pendens filed by a government agency to enforce zoning regulations could be expunged on the same ground.
