  Case Number:  22BBCV00432    Hearing Date:   September 11, 2024    Dept:  P [TENTATIVE]
ORDER OVERRULING DEFENDANT CITY OF BURBANK’S DEMURRER TO SECOND AMENDED
COMPLAINTI.        INTRODUCTION
          This is an action arising
from a contract dispute between Plaintiff VCI Utility Services, LLC dba Vantage
Utility Services (“Plaintiff”) and Defendant City of Burbank (“Defendant” or
“City”). Plaintiff sued the City on June
13, 2022, alleging a single cause of action for Breach of Contract.  On August 15, 2022, Plaintiff filed its First
Amended Complaint, which added a second cause of action for violation of
California Public Contract Code.  On July
8, 2024, Plaintiff filed its Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”) against the City
for (1) Breach of Contract; (2) Violation of the California Public Contract
Code; and (3) Prompt Payment Violation, was deemed filed by the Court. (Min.
Order, 07/08/24.)
Plaintiff
alleges it worked on construction at Hollywood Way and Winona Avenue (the “project”)
for the City beginning in or about April 2020. The project was delayed for six
weeks, which caused an increase in costs of $624,365.31. Plaintiff submitted a change
order to the City for that amount but it was never processed. While working on
the project, Plaintiff regularly applied for payments under the contract.  The City made payments to Plaintiff but
withheld retention in the amount of $41,887. 
Plaintiff completed the project on or about October 7, 2020.  The City never paid the amounts set forth
above and rejected Plaintiff’s Government Code Claim.  
          On August 7, 2024, City filed the instant Demurrer to SAC. On
August 28, 2024, Plaintiff filed an opposition. The City filed its reply on
September 6, 2024. 
                    
II.      LEGAL
STANDARD
Code
of Civil Procedure Section 430.10, subdivision (e), provides for a demurrer on
the basis that a complaint fails to state a cause of action.
A
demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of a complaint. (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968,
994.)  A plaintiff’s allegations must be
accepted as true for purposes of demurrer, no matter how “improbable” they are.
(Del E. Webb Corp. v. Structural
Materials Co. (1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 593, 604 (Del E. Webb).) Allegations need not be accepted as true if they are
contradicted by judicially noticeable facts. (Cansino v. Bank of America (2014) 224 Cal.App.4th 1462, 1474.)
“We
treat the demurrer as admitting all the properly pleaded material facts and
consider matters which may be judicially noticed, but we do not treat as
admitted contentions, deductions, or conclusions of fact or law. (Align Technology, Inc. v. Tran (2009)
179 Cal.App.4th 949, 958 [102 Cal.Rptr.3d 343].) Further, ‘ “ ‘we give the
complaint a reasonable interpretation, reading it as a whole and its parts in
their context.’ ”’ (Ibid.) Because a
demurrer tests only the legal sufficiency of the pleading, we accept as true
even the most improbable alleged facts, and we do not concern ourselves with
the plaintiff's ability to prove its factual allegations. (Ibid.) ‘“Facts appearing in exhibits attached to the first amended
complaint also are accepted as true and are given precedence, to the extent
they contradict the allegations.”’ (Paul
v. Patton (2015) 235 Cal.App.4th 1088, 1091 [185 Cal.Rptr.3d 830].)
Although a demurrer does not ordinarily reach affirmative defenses, it ‘“will
lie where the complaint ‘has included allegations that clearly disclose some
defense or bar to recovery.’ ”’ (Casterson
v. Superior Court (2002) 101 Cal.App.4th 177, 183 [123 Cal.Rptr.2d 637].)” (Nolte v. Cedars-Sinai Medical Center
(2015) 236 Cal.App.4th 1401, 1406.)
 
Judicial
notice may be taken of a plaintiff’s unequivocal discovery responses based on
his or her knowledge, even if they contradict the complaint. (Bockrath v. Aldrich Chemical Co., Inc.
(1999) 21 Cal.4th 71, 83 (Bockrath).)
“The
court will take judicial notice of records such as admissions, answers to
interrogatories, affidavits, and the like, when considering a demurrer, only
where they contain statements of the plaintiff or his agent which are
inconsistent with the allegations of the pleading before the court.” (Del E. Webb at 605.)
A
demurrer challenges defects appearing on the face of the complaint or in
judicially noticeable material, but cannot be based on evidence. “Speaking
demurrers” are not permitted. (The Rutter Group California Practice Guide:
Civil Procedure Before Trial, §7.8.)
Code
of Civil Procedure Section 430.10, subdivision (f), provides for a demurrer
where a pleading is uncertain.
Only
where a pleading is so uncertain a defendant cannot determine what must be
admitted or denied is a demurrer for uncertainty appropriate. (Khoury v. Maly’s of California (1993) 14
Cal.App.4th 612, 616.)
 
 
A.  
Judicial
Notice In Connection With Demurrers
Code
of Civil Procedure Section 430.30,
subdivision (a) provides,
“When any ground for objection to the complaint . . . appears from… matter of which the court is required to
or may take judicial notice, the objection on that ground may be taken by a
demurrer to the pleading.” 
Judicial notice may be mandatory or discretionary.  As pertinent here, discretionary judicial
notice under Evid. Code §452, subdivision (d)(1) may be taken of the records of any court of
this state.
“It is the consequence of judicial notice that
the ‘fact’ noticed is, in effect, treated as true for purposes of proof. ‘Under
the doctrine of judicial notice, certain matters are assumed to be indisputably
true, and the introduction of evidence to prove them will not be required.
Judicial notice is thus a substitute for formal proof. [Citation.]’ (1 Witkin,
Cal. Evidence (3d ed. 1986) § 80, p. 74.) Therefore, a finding of fact that was
judicially noticed would be removed as a subject of dispute and would be
accepted for evidentiary purposes as true. The effect would be that without
resort to concepts of collateral estoppel or res judicata that would litigate
whether the issue was fully addressed and resolved, a finding of fact would be
removed from dispute in the other action in which it was judicially noticed.” (Sosinksy v.
Grant (1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 1548, 1564.)
 
As
to findings of fact in a court file, the fact that the finding was made may be
established by judicial notice but the fact itself may not be established
through the device of judicial notice.  
[N]either a finding of
fact made after a contested adversary hearing nor a finding of fact made after
any other type of hearing can be indisputably deemed to have been a correct
finding. As we have noted, ‘[u]nder the doctrine of judicial notice, certain
matters are assumed to be indisputably true, and the introduction of evidence
to prove them will not be required.’ (1 Witkin, Cal. Evidence (3d ed. 1986) §
80.) “Taking judicial notice of the truth of a judge’s factual finding would
appear to us to be tantamount to taking judicial notice that the judge’s
factual finding must necessarily have been correct and
that the judge is therefore infallible. We resist the temptation to do so.” (Id. at 1568.)
 
Judicial
notice may not be taken of any matter unless authorized or required by law.”
(Evid. Code, § 450.) Matters that are subject to judicial notice are listed in
Evidence Code sections 451 and 452. A matter ordinarily is subject to judicial
notice only if the matter is reasonably beyond dispute. (Citation.) Although
the existence of a document may be
judicially noticeable, the truth of statements contained in the document and
its proper interpretation are not subject to judicial notice if those matters
are reasonably disputable. (StorMedia,
Inc. v. Superior Court (1999) 20 Cal.4th 449, 457, fn. 9.) StorMedia stated: “In ruling on a
demurrer, a court may consider facts of which it has taken judicial notice.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 430.30, subd. (a).) This includes the existence of a
document. When judicial notice is taken of a document, however, the
truthfulness and proper interpretation of the document are disputable. (Joslin v. H.A.S. Ins. Brokerage (1986)
184 Cal.App.3d 369, 374.)” (Ibid.)
 
Joslin v. H.A.S. Ins. Brokerage, supra, 184
Cal.App.3d at page 374, stated: “Taking judicial notice of a document is not
the same as accepting the truth of its contents or accepting a particular
interpretation of its meaning. (Citation.) On a demurrer a court’s function is
limited to testing the legal sufficiency of the complaint. (Citation.) ‘A
demurrer is simply not the appropriate procedure for determining the truth of
disputed facts.’ (Citation.) The hearing on demurrer may not be turned into a
contested evidentiary hearing through the guise of having the court take
judicial notice of documents whose truthfulness or proper interpretation are
disputable. (Citation.)” Joslin, supra, at page 375, stated further, “
‘judicial notice of matters upon demurrer will be dispositive only in those
instances where there is not or cannot be a factual dispute concerning that
which is sought to be judicially noticed.’ (Citation.)”

citations shortened or omitted.)
 
III.     ANALYSIS
          A. Summary of Pleading
The
SAC alleges that on or about March 8, 2019, Plaintiff entered into a written
blanket purchase order agreement with the City (“contract”). (SAC ¶5.) There
was no fixed scope of work in the contract and the contract maximum was $1,000,000.00.
(SAC ¶6.) The contract contemplated that the City would issue purchase orders
within the scope of the contract pursuant to further quotes by Plaintiff. (SAC
¶6.) Plaintiff provided a quote for construction on Hollywood Way and Winona
Avenue (the “project”) in the amount of $747,557.88. (SAC ¶7.) Performance of
the contract began in or about early April 2020. (SAC ¶8.) The project was
delayed for six weeks due to issues with the soil discovered during the trench
work, which caused costs to increase. (SAC ¶¶9-11.) On or about July 23, 2020,
Plaintiff submitted a change order to the City reflecting increased costs of
$624,365.31, which was never processed by the City. (SAC ¶11.)  Plaintiff regularly applied for payments under
the contract.  (SAC ¶12.)  The City withheld retention from these
payments, which the City has never paid. 
(SAC ¶12.)
B.
Request for Judicial Notice 
Defendant
City’s request for judicial notice is GRANTED pursuant to Evidence Code
Sections 452, subdivision (d), (h), and 453 (except as to the truth). 
Plaintiff
objection to the request for judicial notice is OVERRULED.
C.
Discussion
          The City demurs to the first and third causes of action in
the SAC on the grounds that they (1) are time-barred; (2) fail to state a cause
of action for retention claims; and (3) fail to allege facts sufficient to
constitute a cause of action under Civil Code Section 8818.  As a preliminary matter, the City’s demurrer to
the first cause of action must be overruled, as it is procedurally
improper.  The City’s moving papers make
it clear that it is not demurring to the breach of contract cause of action in
its entirety, but only to the newly alleged retention claims.  However, a “partial demurrer” as to a cause of
action is impermissible.  (See PH II,
Inc. v. Superior Court (1995) 33 Cal. App. 4th 1680, (“[a] demurrer does
not lie to a portion of a cause of action.”)) 
On this basis alone, the demurrer to the first cause of action is
overruled. 
          1. Plaintiff’s Retention Claims Are Not Time-Barred
          Assuming the “partial demurrer” as to the first cause of
action is permissible, the Court would still overrule the demurrer as to that
cause of action as discussed below.
The
City contends that Plaintiff’s claims in the SAC for statutory penalties (SAC
¶35), the retention amount and attorney’s fees as authorized by statute (SAC
¶31; Prayer at 6:1-3), and the retention amount authorized by the contract
between the parties (SAC ¶¶24-25), are time-barred because they accrued in
December 2019 and were subject to a six month extension pursuant to Emergency
Rule 9. Even if Plaintiff was not required to satisfy the Government Claims
Act, the City argues Plaintiff still would have had to file this lawsuit for
the statutory penalties no later than June 2021, retention amount and
attorney’s fees as authorized by statute no later than June 2023, and retention
amount authorized by the contract between the parties no later than June 2024.
Moreover, the City asserts that the new retention claims were not filed in the
original complaint nor the First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) and do not rest on
the same general facts as Plaintiff’s pre-existing differing site conditions
claims. (SAC ¶¶31-34.)
          The Court disagrees. “An amended complaint relates back to
an earlier complaint if it is based on the same general set of facts, even if
Plaintiff alleges a different theory or new cause of action.”  (Smeltzley v. Nicholson Mfg. Co.
(1977) 18 Cal. 3d 932, 934.) However, the doctrine will not apply if “the
plaintiff seeks by amendment to recover upon a set of facts entirely unrelated
to those pleaded in the original complaint.” 
(Stockwell v. McAlvay (1937) 10 Cal. 2d 368, 375.)  In ¶ 21 of the First Amended Complaint,
Plaintiff alleged that the City breached “multiple obligations as set forth in
the contract.”  This allegation
undoubtedly encompasses the recently added allegations of withheld retention
payments.  The newly added allegations set
forth an additional basis for the breach of contract claim and “relate back” to
the timely filed First Amended Complaint. 

          Specifically, Plaintiff’s effort to recover the $41,887 (alternatively
listed as $44,400.64) withheld retention payments arise from the same general
set of facts set forth in the First Amended Complaint and are closely related
to the allegations of the City’s breach for nonpayment of the $624,365.  In this Court’s view, these alleged breaches
are two sides of the same coin.  As such,
the amendments as to the first cause of action are proper.  While the Court will address the statute of
limitations arguments as to the third cause of action below, it would not be
unreasonable to conclude that because the retention claims relate back to the
First Amended Complaint, the demurrer must also be overruled as to the third
cause of action, which is arguably an alternate theory of recovery for the
unpaid withheld retention.
          2.  Applicable Statutes of Limitation                  
          Code of Civil Procedure Section 340, subdivision (a) states
“An action upon a statute for a penalty or forfeiture, if the action is given
to an individual, or to an individual and the state, except if the statute
imposing it prescribes a different limitation” must be filed within one year.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 340.)           Code
of Civil Procedure Section 337, subdivision (a) provides “An action upon any contract,
obligation or liability founded upon an instrument in writing, except as
provided in Section 336a; provided, that the time within which any action for a
money judgment for the balance due upon an obligation for the payment of which
a deed of trust or mortgage with power of sale upon real property or any
interest therein was given as security, following the exercise of the power of
sale in such deed of trust or mortgage, may be brought shall not extend beyond
three months after the time of sale under such deed of trust or mortgage.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 337, subd. (a).)
          Code of Civil Procedure Section 338, subdivision (a)
provides that an “action upon a liability created by statute, other than a
penalty or forfeiture” must be filed within three years. (Code Civ. Proc., §
338, subd. (a).)  
          The SAC incorporates by reference all allegations contained
in paragraphs 1 through 29. (SAC ¶¶18, 30.) As to the first cause of action,
Plaintiff alleges it furnished labor, materials, equipment and services to the
City in performing its work on the project. (SAC ¶19.) Plaintiff alleges it
performed or satisfied all conditions and requirements under the Contract. (SAC
¶20.) The City breached the contract by failing to provide a time extension and
compensation for delays that are recoverable under the contract; failing to
process and pay change order requests and claims as required under the contract;
and failing and refusing to pay all sums due under the Contract. (SAC ¶¶21-23.)
The City also breached the contract by failing to promptly pay retention owed
to Plaintiff in the amount of $41,887 which has been due and owing since 2020.
(SAC ¶24.) 
As
to the third cause of action, the SAC alleges the City further withheld $44,400.64
in retention from Plaintiff under the contract, which was due 45 days after
completion of the project. (SAC ¶¶31-32, 36.) Plaintiff demanded payment in
December 2019 and the City refused to pay the retention for the past 53 months.
(SAC ¶¶33-34.) Plaintiff is entitled to prompt payment penalties of two (2)
percent per month pursuant to Civil Code Section 8818 and Public Contract Code
Section 7107. (SAC ¶35.)
          In reading the SAC as a whole and taking the allegations as
true, Plaintiff’s retention claims are not time-barred.[1] Although
the purpose of Public Contract Code Section 7107, “is to ensure that contractors
and subcontractors, who may have less leverage than project owners and contractors,
respectively, are paid for their work on a timely basis,” in a more complicated
public works project, the contractor may wait years before receiving retention
payments. (Blois Construction, Inc. v. FCI/Fluor/Parsons (2016) 245
Cal.App.4th 1091, 1095-1097.) In fact, the SAC alleges that Plaintiff has not
received retention payments at all since completing the project. Next, the City
does not cite any case or statutory law to support its contention that
Plaintiff is required to present a claim for retention payments. 
By
contrast, Public Contract Code Section 7107, subdivision (h), explicitly states
“[a]ny attempted waiver of the provisions of this section shall be void as
against the public policy of this state.” (Pub. Contract Code, § 7107, subd.
(h).) Essentially, the City’s contention that the retention claims are
time-barred seems to be an argument for waiver of the Public Contract Code. Additionally,
as discussed above, the retention claims rest on the same general facts of
Plaintiff’s pre-existing different condition claims because they all arise out
of the Contract at issue in this case. As such, the retention claims were filed
within the three-year statute of limitations per Code of Civil Procedure
Section 338, subdivision (a). Similarly, the SAC alleges breach of the Contract
in 2020, thus the first cause of action was filed within the four-year period.
Lastly, there is no indication that Code of Civil Procedure Section 340,
subdivision (a) applies to actions against municipalities.  
          2. The SAC Sufficiently Pleads Terms of a Contract
The
City asserts that the SAC fails to state sufficient facts to constitute a cause
of action as to the retention claims because Plaintiff fails to identify all
the material terms contained in the bidder’s proposal sheets and fails to
attach any portion of the contract to the SAC.
“Establishing
a breach of contract claim requires a showing of “(1) the existence of the contract,
(2) plaintiff's performance or excuse for nonperformance, (3) defendant's
breach, and (4) the resulting damages to the plaintiff.” (D’Arrigo Bros. of
California v. United Farmworkers of America (2014) 224 Cal.App.4th 790,
800.) “Further, the complaint must indicate on its face whether the contract is
written, oral, or implied by conduct.” (Otworth v. Southern Pac.
Transportation Co. (1985) 166 Cal.App.3d 452, 458–459.)¿ “In an action
based on a written contract, a plaintiff may plead the legal effect of the contract
rather than its precise language.” (Construction Protective Services, Inc.
v. TIG Specialty Ins. Co. (2002) 29 Cal.4th 189, 198–199; see also 14A Cal.
Jur. 3d Contracts § 393.)
In
reading the SAC as a whole and taking the allegations as true, Plaintiff
alleges sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action as to the retention
claims. The SAC alleges the contemplated scope of the work under contract, the
total amount for the contract, and how the City would issue purchase orders
pursuant to further quotes by Plaintiff. (SAC ¶¶5-6.) The SAC further alleges
that Plaintiff provided labor, materials, equipment, and services for work on
the project. (SAC ¶¶7, 19.) The SAC further alleges performance of the contract
began in or about early April 2020. (SAC ¶8.) The SAC alleges that the project
was delayed for six weeks due to issues with the soil discovered during the
trench work and caused the costs to increase. (SAC ¶¶9-11.) The SAC also
alleges pursuant to the contract, on or about July 23, 2020, Plaintiff
submitted a change order to the City reflecting the increased costs in the
amount of $624,365.31, which was never processed by the City. (SAC ¶11.) The
SAC also alleges that Plaintiff regularly applied for payments pursuant to the contract,
but the City withheld retention from each payment despite Plaintiff completing
all the work required for the project on or about October 7, 2020. (SAC
¶¶12-14.) As such, a reasonable jury could infer that the City entered into the
contract with Plaintiff to complete issued purchase orders, Plaintiff performed
its obligations pursuant to the contract, and the City failed to pay Plaintiff
under the contract. 
          3. Plaintiff’s Claim Under Civil Code Section 8818
The
City argues that Plaintiff’s retention claims must be dismissed without leave
to amend because Civil Code Section 8818 does not apply to public works such as
the work at issue in the present lawsuit.  Civil Code Section 8818, subdivision (a)
provides that “The owner or direct contractor is liable to the person to which
payment is owed for a penalty of 2 percent per month on the amount wrongfully
withheld, in place of any interest otherwise due.” (Civ. Code, §8818, subd.
(a).)
Although
the SAC alleges that Plaintiff is entitled to prompt payment penalties of two
(2) percent per month pursuant to Civil Code Section 8818, the SAC also alleges
that Plaintiff’s entitlement to prompt payment penalties of two percent per
month are recoverable under Public Contract Code Section 7107. (SAC ¶35.)
Pursuant to Public Contract Code Section 7107, subdivision (f), “In the event
that retention payments are not made within the time periods required by this
section, the public entity or original contractor withholding the unpaid
amounts shall be subject to a charge of 2 percent per month on the improperly
withheld amount, in lieu of any interest otherwise due….” (Pub. Contract Code,
§ 7107, subd. (f).) There is no dispute that Public Contract Code applies to
the public works at issue in this case. Thus, the retention claims are properly
asserted against the City under Public Contract Code Section 7107. The City’s
argument regarding the invocation of Civil Code Section 8818 is noted but
improper on a demurrer where it is not the only basis for the alleged claims.
