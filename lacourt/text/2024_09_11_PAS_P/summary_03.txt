And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted Vahe Khachatryan's motion for leave to file a cross-complaint against Central Park North Association (CPN) and other defendants. The cross-complaint arises from a dispute over the construction work performed on Khachatryan's condominium, which caused damage to the plaintiffs' unit. The court notes that Khachatryan did not have adequate information at the time he filed his answer, and that the proposed cross-complaint will not cause additional expense or burden on discovery. The court also notes that the trial date is set for September 30, 2024, and that the cross-complaints will be severed from trial on the underlying Second Amended Complaint. The court exercises its discretion to sever the cross-complaints to prevent prejudice to Plaintiff Maureen Gonzalez, who is 89 years old and has health issues.
