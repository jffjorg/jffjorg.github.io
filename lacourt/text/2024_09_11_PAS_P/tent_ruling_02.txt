This is an appropriate time to remind
the parties, particularly Plaintiff, that citing G & W Builders, Inc. v.
Bernards Bros., No. B226690, 2013 WL 143582, is improper under CRC 8.1115(a). 
Plaintiff notes that Defendant
omits reference to this case in its demurrer after raising it in the meet and
confer.  What Plaintiff calls
omission, this Court calls compliance with the rules of court.
