(Code of Civil Procedure Section 598)
  - "As an evidentiary restriction, section 3295(d) requires a court, upon application of any defendant, to bifurcate a trial so that the trier of fact is not presented with evidence of the defendant's wealth and profits until after the issues of liability, compensatory damages, and malice, oppression, or fraud have been resolved against the defendant." (Torres v. Automobile Club of Southern California)
  - "Trifurcation would prolong the trial by requiring the jury to engage in up to three rounds of deliberations, which would necessarily be preceded by three rounds of jury instructions."
