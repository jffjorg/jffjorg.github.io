And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied Petitioner Vagharshak Harutyunyan's Motion to Compel Arbitration. The Petitioner sought to compel arbitration of their claims against Respondent Progressive Insurance, arguing that an arbitration agreement existed between the parties. The Petitioner presented a copy of the insurance policy, which included an arbitration provision, and argued that Respondent had failed to cooperate in the investigation of the subject collision.

Respondent Progressive Insurance opposed the motion, arguing that the Petitioner had breached their duty to cooperate under the insurance policy by failing to attend an Examination Under Oath (EUO) and to provide requested information. Respondent also argued that the Petitioner's demand for arbitration was premature, as the parties had not yet reached an impasse regarding liability or damages.

The court found that the Petitioner had not met their burden of showing that they were entitled to arbitration. The court held that the insurance policy requires the Petitioner to cooperate in the investigation of the subject collision, including attending an EUO and providing requested information, before they are entitled to the benefits of uninsured motorist arbitration.

The court also held that the Respondent's failure to agree to arbitration was not a barrier to the Petitioner's right to demand arbitration, as the Petitioner had not provided a recorded statement or appeared for examination. The court therefore denied the Petitioner's Motion to Compel Arbitration.
