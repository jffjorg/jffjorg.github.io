And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

This tentative ruling addresses the demurrer filed by defendant Sotheby's International Realty, Inc. to the fraud and unfair business practices claims made by plaintiff Tierney. The court rules that the demurrer is sustained as to the fraud claim due to the plaintiff's failure to plead sufficient facts supporting delayed discovery. The court also rules that the motion to strike punitive damages is moot since the demurrer to the fraud claim is sustained. Additionally, the court grants the motion to strike the prayer for attorney's fees since there are no allegations providing statutory or contractual grounds supporting attorney's fees.
