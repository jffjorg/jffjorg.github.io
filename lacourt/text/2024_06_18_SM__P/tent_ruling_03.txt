Tierney
v. Westridge Investment LLC, et al., Case No. 23SMCV05866
Hearing
date June 18, 2024
Defendant
Sotheby’s International Realty, Inc.’s (1) Demurrer and (2) Motion to Strike
 
In
this construction defect case, plaintiff sued broker Sotheby’s International
Realty and various construction-related entities. Sotheby’s demurs to the
still-pending causes of action for fraud and unfair business practices/Bus. &
Prof. §17200. Causes of action 2-4 were previously dismissed as against moving
defendant. Sotheby’s also moves to strike the punitive damages and attorney
fees allegations.
 
Demurrer
In
reviewing the legal sufficiency of a complaint against a demurrer, a court will
treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded. Blank
v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318 (Blank); C & H Foods Co.
v. Hartford Ins. Co. (1984) 163 Cal.App.3d 1055, 1062. A “demurrer lies
only for defects appearing on the face of the complaint[.]” Stevens v.
Superior Court (1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 594, 601. For purposes of ruling on a
demurrer, the complaint must be construed liberally by drawing reasonable inferences
from the facts pleaded. Wilner v. Sunset Life Ins. Co. (2000) 78
Cal.App.4th 952, 958.
 
Plaintiff
need only allege ultimate facts, not evidentiary facts. Doe v. City of Los
Angeles (2007) 42 Cal.4th 531, 550. “All that is required of a plaintiff,
as a matter of pleading … is that his complaint set forth the essential facts
of the case with reasonable precision and with sufficient particularity to
acquaint the defendant with the nature, source and extent of his cause of
action.” Rannard v. Lockheed Aircraft Corp. (1945) 26 Cal.2d 149, 156
157.
 
Fraud
Cause of Action
The
statute of limitations for fraudulent concealment is three years. Code Civ.
Proc. §338(d). In a cause of action for fraud, the statute of limitations
begins to run “‘after one has knowledge of facts sufficient to make a
reasonably prudent person suspicious of fraud, thus putting him on inquiry . .
. .’ [Citation.]” Cleveland v. Internet Specialties West, Inc. (2009)
171 Cal.App.4th 24, 31. “[P]laintiffs are required to conduct a reasonable
investigation after becoming aware of an injury, and are charged with knowledge
of the information that would have been revealed by such an investigation.” Fox
v. Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc. (2005) 35 Cal.4th 797, 808. 
 
“In
order to rely on the discovery rule for delayed accrual of a cause of action, ‘[a]
plaintiff whose complaint shows on its face that his claim would be barred
without the benefit of the discovery rule must specifically plead facts to show
(1) the time and manner of discovery and (2) the inability to have made earlier
discovery despite reasonable diligence.’ [Citations omitted.] In assessing the
sufficiency of the allegations of delayed discovery, the court places the
burden on the plaintiff to ‘show diligence’; ‘conclusory allegations will not
withstand demurrer.’ [Citation omitted.]” Id. 
 
There
is a three-year statute of limitations for fraud. Defendant Sotheby’s argues the
claim accrued September 3, 2020, when escrow closed. The suit was filed
December 15, 2023, three months after the three-year statute expired. 
 
Plaintiff’s
opposition does not address the statute of limitations argument or when the
material defects were discovered. In the complaint, plaintiff alleges “[a]fter Plaintiff
took possession of the PROPERTY, Plaintiff began to discover that there were
substantial and material defects in the PROPERTY that had not been disclosed to
Plaintiff by any of the SELLER DEFENDANTS or BROKER DEFENDANTS.” Compl. ¶52. “In
order to evaluate the full extent of the construction defects at the PROPERTY,
Plaintiff hired an expert to evaluate and estimate the cost of repairing the
construction defects . . . .” Compl. ¶55. 
 
These
allegations are insufficient to state when and how plaintiff discovered the
material defects, so the court cannot evaluate the delayed discovery claims. Setting
that issue aside, the claims for fraud at paras. 20-58, see e.g. Transfer
Disclosure Statement, Questionnaire and AVID forms, adequate plead a cause of
action for fraud. See also paras. 110-125, and allegations of inter-related
nature of defendants. SUSTAINED WITH LEAVE TO AMEND as to the delayed discovery
issue.
 
Unfair
Business Practices - Business & Professions Code §17200
California’s
unfair competition law (UCL) prohibits any unlawful, unfair, or fraudulent
business act or practice. Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code §17200 et seq. A claim may
be brought under the UCL by a person who has suffered injury in fact and has
lost money or property as a result of unfair competition. Cal. Bus. & Prof.
Code §17204. To establish standing under the UCL, a plaintiff must (1)
establish a loss or deprivation of money sufficient to qualify as injury in
fact, i.e., economic injury, and (2) show that the economic injury was the
result of, i.e., caused by, the unfair business practice that is the gravamen
of the claim. See Kwikset Corp. v. Superior Court (2011) 51 Cal.4th 310,
337. 
 
Defendant
argues the complaint fails to state facts sufficient to constitute this cause
of action because the complaint alleges unjust enrichment and there is no such
cause of action in the complaint. In the sixth cause of action, plaintiff alleges
“Defendants have been unjustly enriched at the expense of Plaintiff, and
Plaintiff is entitled to damages and restitution in an amount to be proven at
trial.” Compl. ¶130. 
 
Plaintiff
sought restitution, which is permitted in a 17200 claim. OVERRULED.
 
Motion to Strike 
Punitive Damages 
To support a prayer for punitive damages, the complaint
must allege “oppression, fraud, or malice.” Cyrus v. Haveson (1976)
65 Cal.App.3d 306, 316-17. “Malice means conduct which is intended by the
defendant to cause injury to the plaintiff or despicable conduct which is
carried on by the defendant with a willful and conscious disregard of the
rights or safety of others.” Civ. Code §3294. 
 
This is moot, as the demurrer to the fraud claim is
sustained to allow plaintiff to allege facts supporting delayed discovery.
However, the court notes plaintiff alleges intentional misrepresentation or
concealment of defects to induce plaintiff into closing escrow. Compl. ¶¶112,
114, 115-118, 121-124, which would be sufficiently specific allegations of
fraud to support an allegation of punitive damages. MOOT.
 
Attorney’s Fees 
Defendant moves to strike the prayer for attorney’s fees.
There are no allegations providing statutory or contractual grounds supporting
attorney’s fees. GRANTED.
