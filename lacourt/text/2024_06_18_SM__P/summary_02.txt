significant_statements:
  - The court disagrees with the opposition's argument that Semler's motion does not comply with Rule 3.1324.
  - The opposition's argument regarding lack of factual specificity is for the court to consider on a challenge to the pleadings, not on the motion for leave to amend.
  - The statute of limitations relates back to the original date of the incident, so this argument is unavailing and not appropriate for consideration on a motion for leave to amend.
```

And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for leave to file an amended cross-complaint. The plaintiff, Semler Companies, is seeking to add new causes of action to its cross-complaint, including fraud, negligence, and breach of contract. The court has determined that the opposition's argument that Semler's motion does not comply with the California Rules of Court 3.1324 is without merit. The court also disagrees with the opposition's argument that the proposed amended cross-complaint fails to state a cause of action. The court has ordered the moving party to provide a supplemental declaration regarding when the facts giving rise to the amendment were discovered and why the request to amend was not made earlier.
