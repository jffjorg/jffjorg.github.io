And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to demurrer and motion to strike filed by Loyola Marymount University (LMU) in a case brought by John Doe alleging discrimination and abuse. The court has sustained LMU's demurrer to the first cause of action without leave to amend, meaning that the plaintiff will not be allowed to amend his complaint to address the deficiencies identified by the court. The court has also found that LMU's motion to strike is mooted, as the first cause of action has been sustained on demurrer.

The court's ruling is based on its analysis of the plaintiff's complaint and the defendant's demurrer and motion to strike. The court found that the first cause of action fails to allege that the plaintiff filed a complaint with a local educational agency prior to commencing this action, as required by Education Code Section 66292.3. The court also found that the plaintiff's argument that the exhaustion requirement is excused is without merit.

The court has taken judicial notice of an excerpted portion of the plaintiff's sworn deposition testimony and exhibit 66 to the plaintiff's deposition. The court has also considered the plaintiff's argument that the agencies identified by LMU do not have jurisdiction to hear and resolve the plaintiff's state law claims, but has found that the agencies do have jurisdiction to hear and resolve the claims under federal law.

Overall, the court's tentative ruling is a significant development in the case, as it may limit the plaintiff's ability to pursue his claims and may have implications for the parties' future litigation strategy.
