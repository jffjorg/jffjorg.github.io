Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge is tentatively granting the defendant's motion to compel an independent mental examination (IME) of the plaintiff, Jose Nolazco. The defendant has argued that good cause exists to order the IME because Nolazco's mental condition is in controversy in the case. The judge has identified several issues that need to be addressed before the IME can take place, including the disclosure of raw data and test questions, the audio recording of the testing portion, and the scope of questions that can be asked.

The judge has also stated that it will exercise its discretion to require the defendant or its IME doctor to provide the plaintiff's counsel with the test questions and raw data after the plaintiff attends the IME. Additionally, the judge has prohibited the plaintiff's counsel, expert, or any other person from coaching the plaintiff about how to answer the questions in any of the standardized tests.

The judge has also noted that the IME will be subject to a protective order to address the concerns about test security and integrity. Finally, the judge has stated that it will require oral argument on several issues, including the disclosure of raw data and test questions, the audio recording of the testing portion, and the scope of questions that can be asked.
