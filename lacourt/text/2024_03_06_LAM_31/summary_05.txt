And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Estate Research Associates v. Controller of the State of California, case number 24STCP00007. The petition, filed by Estate Research Associates, seeks to establish a claim to escheated property and order payment of that property. The property in question is funds being held by the California State Controller, which were assigned to Mary Alvidrez by Christine Martinez. The court finds that the petition sets forth the basis for Martinez's entitlement to Alvidrez's property and that the requisite notice has been given to the Attorney General and Controller. As the petition is unopposed, the court grants the petition and orders the property to be delivered to Estate Research Associates.
