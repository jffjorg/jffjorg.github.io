And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses several issues in a wrongful death action. The court notes that NPB Global Consulting Group, Inc's opposition contains redactions, but since other parties did not redact or file their pleading under seal, the court need not address the issues raised by NPB Global's redactions. The court also considers the arguments regarding CISS's liability for indemnification and finds that CISS must concede it has some liability since it is paying $86,042.52. The court also considers the non-economic damages suffered by the plaintiff, including loss of love, companionship, comfort, care, assistance, protection, affection, society, and moral support. The court notes that each defendant shall be liable only for the amount of non-economic damages allocated to that defendant in direct proportion to that defendant's percentage of fault. The court is unaware if Non-Settling Defendants attempted to obtain discovery of CISS's financial condition.
