And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge denied CI Security Specialist, Inc.'s (CISS) motion for a determination of a good faith settlement. The Judge found that the settlement between Plaintiffs and CISS does not pass the test for a good faith settlement. CISS argued that it had no liability for the stabbing, but the Judge found that CISS's security guards were assigned to the area where the stabbing occurred and that CISS failed to procure the required insurance coverage. The Judge also found that the settlement amount of $86,042.52 was not reasonable, considering the potential liability of CISS for failing to properly perform security control and the potential for indemnification by Non-Settling Defendants. The Judge concluded that the settlement was not made in good faith and that CISS's motion was denied.
