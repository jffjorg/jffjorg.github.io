PLAINTIFF’S
MOTION FOR ATTORNEY FEES, COSTS, AND EXPENSES
 
DEFENDANT’S
MOTION TO STRIKE, OR IN THE ALTERNATIVE TAX PLAINTIFF’S COUNSEL’S MEMORANDUM OF
COSTS



 
 
I.          BACKGROUND
 
            On March 28, 2022, Plaintiff Andrea Bugarin filed a
Complaint against Defendant General Motors, LLC (“GM”) for violations of the
Song-Beverly Act.  
 
On September 26, 2023, Plaintiff accepted GM’s section 998
offer to settle the case.  
 
On November 7, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel represented to the court
that the issue of attorney fees and costs was pending and more time was needed
to submit the Request for Dismissal.  
 
On November 16, 2023, Plaintiff filed a Memorandum of Costs.
 
On November 22, 2023, Plaintiff filed a motion for attorney
fees, costs, and expenses.  
 
On December 1, 2023, GM filed a motion to strike, or in the
alternative tax, Plaintiff’s counsel’s memorandum of costs.  
 
            The
foregoing motions are fully briefed.  The
court rules as follows:
 
II.        PLAINTIFF’S MOTION FOR ATTORNEY FEES,
COSTS, AND EXPENSES
A.   
Judicial Notice
Plaintiff
requests judicial notice of nineteen (19) court orders awarding attorney fees in
other cases Song-Beverly actions.  As
the court does not rely on the documents to resolve this motion, the court
declines to rule on Plaintiff’s request.
B.    
Discussion & Legal
Standard 
Plaintiff seeks $21,641.00 in
attorney fees.[1]  Plaintiff also seeks an additional $2,575 for
reviewing GM’s opposition, drafting a reply brief, and attend the hearing for
this motion, and to prepare an opposition to GM’s motion to strike, or
alternatively tax, Plaintiff’s claims costs.[2]
 The total being $24,216.
            On September
26, 2023, the parties agreed to settle the matter.¿ (Moore Decl., ¶ 19, Ex. 2.)
 The settlement provides for attorney
fees by motion under Civil Code section 1794, subdivision (d).¿ (Id.) 
Civil Code section 1794,
subdivision (d) provides:¿ 
(d) If the buyer prevails in an
action under this section, the buyer shall be allowed by the court to recover
as part of the judgment a sum equal to the aggregate amount of costs and
expenses, including attorney’s fees based on actual time expended, determined
by the court to have been reasonably incurred by the buyer in connection
with the commencement and prosecution of such action.¿ 

(Civ. Code, § 1794, subd. (d), emphasis added.)¿ 
The settlement provides Plaintiff
is the prevailing party under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act for the
purposes of this motion.¿ Accordingly, Plaintiff is entitled to an award of
reasonable attorney fees as the prevailing party.¿ The only matter at issue is
the reasonableness of the fees requested.¿ 
Attorney Fees
The determination of reasonable
amount of attorney fees is within the sound discretion of trial courts. (PLCM
Group v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095; Akins v. Enterprise
Rent-A-Car Co. (2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 1127, 1134.) “The determination of
what constitutes a reasonable fee generally ‘begins with the ‘lodestar,’ i.e.,
the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly
rate….’”¿ “[T]he lodestar is the basic fee for comparable legal services in the
community; it may be adjusted by the court based on factors including, as
relevant herein, (1) the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, (2)
the skill displayed in presenting them, (3) the extent to which the nature of
the litigation precluded other employment by the attorneys, (4) the contingent
nature of the fee award….”¿ (Graciano v. Robinson Ford Sales, Inc.
(2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 140, 154.)¿ In setting the hourly rate for an attorney
fees award, courts are entitled to consider the rate of “‘fees customarily
charged by that attorney and others in the community for similar work.’”¿ (Bihun
v. AT&T Information Systems, Inc. (1993) 13 Cal.App.4th 976, 997
[affirming rate of $450 per hour], overruled on other grounds by Lakin v.
Watkins Associated Indus. (1993) 6 Cal.4th 644, 664.)  The burden is
on the party seeking attorney fees to prove reasonableness of the fees.¿ (Center
for Biological Diversity v. County of San Bernardino (2010) 188 Cal.App.4th
603, 615.)¿ 
It is settled “ ‘that the
determination of what constitutes reasonable attorney fees is committed to the
discretion of the trial court .... [Citations.] The value of legal services
performed in a case is a matter in which the trial court has its own expertise.
[Citation.] The trial court may make its own determination of the value of the
services contrary to, or without the necessity for, expert testimony.’ ” (PLCM
Group v. Drexler, supra, 22 Cal.4th at p. 1096; accord, Ketchum
v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1132 [the “ ‘ “experienced trial judge is
the best judge of the value of professional services rendered in his court, and
... his judgment ... will not be disturbed unless the appellate court is
convinced that it is clearly wrong” ’ ”].)
Similarly, the United States
Supreme Court has stated that “trial courts need not, and indeed should not,
become green-eyeshade accountants. The essential goal in shifting fees (to
either party) is to do rough justice, not to achieve auditing perfection. So
trial courts may take into account their overall sense of a suit, and may use
estimates in calculating and allocating an attorney's time. And appellate
courts must give substantial deference to these determinations, in light of
‘the district court's superior understanding of the litigation.’ [Citations.]
We can hardly think of a sphere of judicial decisionmaking in which appellate
micromanagement has less to recommend it.” (Fox v. Vice (2011) 563 U.S.
826, 838.)
1.      Reasonable
Hourly Rate¿  
Plaintiff retained Consumer Law
Experts, P.C. for this matter which involved work by attorneys Julian A. Moore and
Joseph Kowalski, billing at hourly rates of $515 and $350, respectively. 
(Moore Decl., ¶ 20, Ex. 23.)¿ 
            GM
does not challenge the reasonableness of Plaintiff’s counsel’s hourly billing
rates.  
            Based
upon general prevailing rates in the Los Angeles area for this type of
litigation, and GM’s lack of opposition to Plaintiff’s counsels’ hourly rates, the
court finds $515 and $350 to be reasonable.
2.      Number
of Hours Reasonably Expended¿ 
GM’s real point of contention lies
here. Plaintiff’s counsel’s records reflect a total of 45.4 billable hours
spent litigating this matter. ¿(Moore Decl., ¶ 41, Ex. 23.)  
¿           “[I]t
is the burden of the challenging party to point to the specific items
challenged [within the moving party’s verified billing invoice], with a
sufficient argument and citations to evidence.¿ General arguments that fees
claimed are excessive, duplicative, or unrelated do not suffice.”¿ (Lunada
Biomedical v. Nunez (2014) 230 Cal.App.4th 459, 488.)¿¿¿ 
¿           GM
objects to Plaintiff’s counsel’s attempt to recover fees for administrative
tasks performed by a non-attorney, the amount of billing given Plaintiff’s
counsel’s use of template discovery, and billing for trial preparation after the
parties agreed to settle the matter.  GM
challenges specific billing entries. 
(Opp., pp. 6-7.)  Plaintiff does
not address these specific challenges to the billing entries.
The court appreciates that this
case progressed towards trial.¿ Along the way, Plaintiff served and responded
to standard written discovery.  Save for this
motion, and GM’s motion to strike or tax costs, there was no law and motion
practice.¿  
            Moreover,
there was nothing particularly complex or unique about this case.¿ The issues involved
were applicable to other consumers’ vehicles, thereby triggering economies of
scale in terms of Plaintiff’s counsel’s efficiency in litigating this type of
lemon law case.¿  
Considering these facts, the court
agrees that in some instances, the time quoted is excessive or unreasonable
under the circumstances.¿¿Accordingly, the court finds the total amount of
reasonable attorney’s fees in this case is $20,013.50.  This was calculated by reducing Plaintiff’s
counsels’ billing entries as follows: 
·        
0.9 total hours billed by an unidentified person
named Jessica Anvar on November 2, 2021 at various hourly rates.  The entries are for clerical work which are
not recoverable as attorney fees.  The Court reduces these entries in
their entirety for a total reduction of $376.50. 


·        
0.9 hours billed by paralegal Katherine Carreno
on November 13 and 16, 2023 for clerical work. 
Clerical work is not recoverable as attorney fees.  The Court reduces these entries in their
entirety for a reduction of $180.00. 


·        
1.5 hours billed for Drafting Meet and Confer
Correspondence on June 10, 2022: The Court finds the time to be
excessive.  The Court reduces this entry by 1 hour at Mr. Matera’s
hourly rate, amounting to a reduction of $350.00. 


·        
21.4 hours billed by attorney Julian
Moore for drafting discovery and preparing and responses.  (See Moore Decl., Ex. 23, Entries from April
6, 2022; May 9, 19 and 31, 2022; June 21 and 22, 2022.)  The time is excessive.  The Court
reduces these entries by 6.4 hours at Mr. Moore’s hourly rate, amounting to a
reduction of $3,296.00. 


Total Amount Reduced:
$4,202.50  
 
III.       GM’S MOTION
TO STRIKE, OR IN THE ALTERNATIVE TAX, COSTS
 
Plaintiff seeks costs and expenses in the sum of $1,044.80.  (See Memorandum of Costs.)  GM argues Plaintiff’s costs should be
stricken because there is no evidence to support the requested sum.  
 
A party challenging the amounts claimed may file a motion
to tax costs, which must be served and filed 15 days after service of the cost
memorandum.¿ If the cost memorandum was served by mail, the period is extended
as provided in Code of Civil Procedure section 1013. If the cost memorandum was
served electronically, the period is extended as provided in Code of Civil
Procedure section 1010.6(a)(4).  (Cal. Rules of Court., rule 3.1700, subd.
(b)(1).)¿ “Unless objection is made to the entire cost memorandum, the motion
... must refer to each item objected to by the same number and appear in the
same order as the corresponding cost item claimed on the memorandum of costs
and must state why the item is objectionable.”¿ (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1700, subd. (b)(2).)¿ 
¿¿ 
The memorandum of cost is a verified statement by the
party, attorney, or agent that the costs are correct and were necessarily
incurred in the case.  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1700, subd.
(a)(1).)  “If the items appear to be proper charges, the verified
memorandum is prima facie evidence that the costs, expenses and services
therein listed were necessarily incurred by the defendant, and the burden of
showing that an item is not properly chargeable or is unreasonable is upon the
[objecting party].”  (Oak Grove School Dist. v. City Title Ins. Co.
(1963) 217 Cal.App.2d 678, 698.)  “[I]f the correctness of the memorandum
is challenged either in whole or in part by the affidavit or other evidence of
the contesting party, the burden is then on the party claiming the costs and
disbursements to show that the items charged were for matters necessarily
relevant and material to the issues involved in the action.”  (Id.
at p. 699.)¿¿ 
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5 lists the costs that
are recoverable.  Section 1033.5 provides: “(1) Costs are allowable if
incurred, whether or not paid. (2) Allowable costs shall be reasonably
necessary to the conduct of the litigation rather than merely convenient or
beneficial to its preparation. (3) Allowable costs shall be reasonable in
amount. (4) Items not mentioned in this section ... may be allowed ... in the
court’s discretion.”  (Code Civ. Proc., §¿1033.5, subd. (c)(4).)¿¿ 
 
            Here, GM fails to carry its
burden to show Plaintiff’s costs should be reduced by any amount.  Plaintiff seeks to recover $747.70 for filing
and motion fees, $72.10 for service of process, and $225 for ADR.  These costs are allowable.  (See Code Civ. Proc., §¿1033.5, subd.
(c)(4).)¿¿ 
 
            Alternatively, GM argues $333.93
incurred in filing and motion fees ($261.83) and service of process ($72.10)
should be taxed because they were unnecessary costs.  (See Mot., pp. 4-5.)  Specifically, GM challenges (1) fees for
filing the Notice of Case Management and posting jury fees, Notice of Change of
Address, and Motion for Attorney’s Fees, and service of process for Laurence
Braddell (“Braddell”) and James Oaks (“Oaks”). (See Memorandum of Costs, Items
1c, 1d, 1e, 5a, and 5b).  GM argues these
fees were incurred solely for the benefit of Plaintiff’s counsel because this
case did not advance to trial nor were Braddell or Oaks deposed.  This challenge also fails.  GM’s “hindsight” approach fails to carry the
day.  First and foremost, the challenged
costs are all allowable costs.  (See Civ.
Proc. Code, § 1033.5, subds. (a)(1) and (a)(4).)  GM does not meet its
burden to overcome the presumption that the costs were reasonably
incurred.  
 
IV.        CONCLUSION
            
Plaintiff is awarded attorney’s fees in the sum of $20.013.50,
and costs in the sum of $1,044.80, for a total award of $21,058.30.
 
Plaintiff to give notice.
