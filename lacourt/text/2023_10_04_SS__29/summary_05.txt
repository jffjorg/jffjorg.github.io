The judge has tentatively denied the defendant's motion to continue the trial date from February 16, 2024 to January 6, 2025. The defendant had requested the continuance to allow time for expert discovery and to hear a motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication before trial. However, the judge found that the defendant had not yet filed a motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication, and that the case did not appear to be particularly complex. The judge also noted that the defendant had reserved the earliest available hearing date for its anticipated motion for summary judgment/summary adjudication, which is November 5, 2024. As a result, the judge did not find good cause for a continuance at this time. However, the judge noted that if the defendant does in the future timely file a motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication, the case law would require the Court to grant a request for a continuance so that the motion could be heard before trial.

Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to continue the trial date without prejudice. The defendant had requested a continuance of the trial date from February 16, 2024 to January 6, 2025, citing the need for expert discovery and potential mediation. The plaintiff opposed the motion, arguing that further delay would prejudice them and that the defendant had not proceeded diligently. The judge found that the defendant had not shown good cause for the continuance, as the case did not appear to be particularly complex and trial was scheduled for more than four months away. The judge noted that if the defendant were to file a motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication in the future, the case law would require the court to grant a request for a continuance. However, no such motion had been filed at the time of the ruling.
