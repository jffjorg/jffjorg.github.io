And here is the English summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has tentatively denied the defendant's motion to continue the trial date from February 16, 2024 to January 6, 2025. The defendant had requested the continuance to allow time for expert discovery and to hear a motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication before trial. However, the judge found that the defendant had not yet filed a motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication, and that the case did not appear to be particularly complex. The judge also noted that the defendant had reserved the earliest available hearing date for its anticipated motion for summary judgment/summary adjudication, which is November 5, 2024. As a result, the judge did not find good cause for a continuance at this time. However, the judge noted that if the defendant does in the future timely file a motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication, the case law would require the Court to grant a request for a continuance so that the motion could be heard before trial.
