And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to compel the defendant to respond to requests for production of documents. The defendant failed to respond to the requests in a timely manner, serving responses more than a month after the deadline. The judge has also granted the plaintiff's request for sanctions, but limited the award to $1,250, which is the reasonable cost of preparing and filing the motion. The judge denied the plaintiff's request for additional sanctions, finding that the defendant's counsel made an honest error in calculating the response date. The judge ordered the defendant to provide code-compliant written responses to the requests for production of documents within 30 days of notice of the order.
