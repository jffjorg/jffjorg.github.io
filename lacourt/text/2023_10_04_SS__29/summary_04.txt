And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to compel the defendant to respond to requests for production of documents. The defendant failed to respond to the requests in a timely manner, serving responses more than a month after the deadline. The judge has also granted the plaintiff's request for sanctions, but limited the award to $1,250, which is the reasonable cost of preparing and filing the motion. The judge denied the plaintiff's request for additional sanctions, finding that the defendant's counsel made an honest error in calculating the response date. The judge ordered the defendant to provide code-compliant written responses to the requests for production of documents within 30 days of notice of the order.

significant\_statements:
- “The motion to compel is GRANTED.”
- “The request for sanctions is GRANTED in part.”
- “Plaintiff served the RFPs by email on July 31, 2023.  Normally, responses are due 30 days after service.  Thirty days after service was Wednesday, August 30, 2023.  Because the RFPs were served by email, Defendant, by statute, had two additional court days to respond to the RFPs.  That means that the responses were due on Friday, September 1, 2023.  Defendant did not serve his responses on September 1.  Instead, he served them one court day later, on Tuesday, September 5, 2023.  The consequences for failing to serve a timely response to RFPs are set forth in Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.300: the responding party waives all objections.  There is no exception in the statute, even when responses are served only one court day late.  The Court may grant relief from the waiver of objections, but the responding party must seek such relief by motion and must make the showing required by statute.”
- “Defendant did serve untimely responses, but those responses consisted entirely of objections that have been waived by operation of law.  That is tantamount to no response at all.  The other arguments in the Opposition (including that a meet and confer and a separate statement are required) are simply incorrect.  Accordingly, the Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion to compel.”
- “As to sanctions, the Legislature has directed that the Court ‘shall’ award sanctions unless the Court ‘finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.’  As to the amount of sanctions, however, the Court must limit the sanction to the amount of ‘reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of [the sanctionable] conduct.’  Plaintiff requests monetary sanctions in the amount of $10,000, but that is far beyond what is reasonable.  A motion
