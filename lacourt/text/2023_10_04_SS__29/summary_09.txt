## English Text Summary:

The judge has tentatively ruled to sustain LAUSD's demurrer (a legal challenge to the lawsuit) with leave to amend.  

This means the judge found that the lawsuit, as currently written, doesn't properly state a legal claim against LAUSD because it relies on general tort law, which doesn't apply to public entities like LAUSD. Instead,  the lawsuit needs to identify a specific statute that allows for a claim against LAUSD.

The judge has given the plaintiff 21 days to revise their lawsuit and try to incorporate a valid statutory basis for their claims. 


The judge also overruled LAUSD's argument that the plaintiff cannot recover prejudgment interest, stating that this is not a proper subject for a demurrer.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has sustained the demurrer filed by the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) with leave to amend. The plaintiff, Carlio Alburo, a minor, had filed a complaint against LAUSD and other defendants, alleging that he was severely injured in an explosion during a high school physics class. LAUSD demurred, arguing that the complaint did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action against a public entity. The judge agreed, finding that the plaintiff had not pleaded any statutory basis for his claims, which are required to state a cause of action against a public entity. However, the judge also found that it is reasonably possible that the plaintiff may be able to amend to state viable causes of action against LAUSD. Therefore, the plaintiff is granted leave to amend within 21 days of notice of this order.

Summary:
The Judge's tentative ruling for the case number 23STCV09503, hearing date October 4, 2023, Dept 29, sustains the Demurrer with leave to amend. Plaintiff Carlio Alburo, a minor, filed a complaint against Defendants Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) and Does 1 through 20 on April 28, 2023, through his Guardian ad litem Dolores Alburo. On July 14, 2023, Plaintiff filed a first amended complaint (FAC) against the same defendants. The FAC alleges that on November 10, 2022, Plaintiff attended a high school physics class at the Edward R. Roybal Learning Center, and during an experiment, an explosion occurred that caused severe bodily injury to Plaintiff. The experiment was conducted at the direction and supervision of Plaintiff’s physics teacher. The FAC asserts causes of action for Assault, Battery, Premises Liability, Negligence, Gross Negligence, Respondeat Superior, and Negligent Hiring, Retention, Training and Supervision. LAUSD filed a Demurrer on August 15, 2023, which was replied to by Plaintiffs on September 19, and LAUSD filed a reply on September 27. The Judge rules that LAUSD's argument that Plaintiff cannot recover prejudgment interest is not the proper subject of a demurrer, and overrules it. However, the Judge sustains the Demurrer because Plaintiff does not plead any statutory basis for his claims, which are barred by Government Code section 815. The Judge grants Plaintiff leave to amend within 21 days of notice of this order.
