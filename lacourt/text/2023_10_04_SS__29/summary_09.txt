And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has ruled that the Demurrer filed by Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) is sustained with leave to amend. The Demurrer challenged the sufficiency of the plaintiff's claims against LAUSD, a public entity. The Judge found that the plaintiff's claims are based on common law tort principles, which are barred by Government Code section 815. The Judge granted the plaintiff leave to amend the complaint to state one or more viable causes of action against LAUSD. The plaintiff has 21 days to file an amended complaint.
