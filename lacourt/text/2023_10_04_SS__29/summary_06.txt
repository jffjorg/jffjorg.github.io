**English Summary:**

The judge has denied the Defendant's request for terminating sanctions (dismissing the case altogether) because this is considered a harsh remedy reserved for extreme situations.

However, the judge has granted the Defendant's request for additional monetary sanctions against the Plaintiff and their attorney for the ongoing discovery violations. The Plaintiff and their attorney are ordered to pay $690 in sanctions.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the defendant's motion to continue the trial date from January 26, 2024, to June 26, 2024. The defendant seeks a five-month continuance to complete discovery and prepare for trial, and the court finds that good cause has been shown for the continuance.

The judge denies the defendant's request for terminating sanctions, finding that a terminating sanction is a drastic remedy that is appropriate only in extreme cases. Although the plaintiff's conduct merits substantial sanctions, the defendant has not yet demonstrated that a terminating sanction is warranted in this matter.

The judge grants the defendant's request for monetary sanctions in the amount of $690, calculated as three hours of attorney time multiplied by counsel's billing rate of $210 per hour, plus a filing fee of $60. The plaintiff and counsel of record are ordered to pay the monetary sanctions within 30 days of notice of this order.

Plaintiff Edvin Asatori filed a complaint against Defendant Steven Perez and Does 1 through 10 alleging causes of action for motor vehicle negligence and general negligence.
