And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's application for default judgment without prejudice. The plaintiff, Hua Xia Bank Co., Ltd., Zhengzhou Branch, alleges that it granted a credit line to Henan Province Songhe Wines Industry Co., Ltd. and that the defendant, Wenchen Zhu, signed a surety contract for the loans. The plaintiff claims that Songhe Wines was unable to repay the loans and that it terminated the loans and requested repayment. The plaintiff obtained a judgment against Zhu and another defendant.

The judge denied the application because the plaintiff failed to provide required information and documentation, including a brief summary of the case, a calculation of interest, and authentication of Exhibit 1. The judge also noted that the plaintiff did not meet the burden of establishing that the foreign country judgment is entitled to recognition under the Uniform Foreign Country Money Judgments Recognition Act. The judge requested that the plaintiff submit a revised default judgment packet that addresses the aforementioned issues.
