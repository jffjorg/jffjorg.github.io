Xia Bank Co., Ltd., Zhengzhou Branch v. Zhu, Case No. 24PSCV01353


ORDER ON DEFAULT JUDGMENT APPLICATION


 Plaintiff
Hua Xia Bank Co., Ltd., Zhengzhou
Branch’s
Application for Default Judgment is DENIED without prejudice.
 
Background
Plaintiff Hua Xia Bank Co., Ltd., Zhengzhou Branch (“Plaintiff”)
alleges as follows:

          On February 20, 2020, Plaintiff
entered into a Credit Line Loan Contract with Henan Province Songhe Wines
Industry Co., Ltd. (“Songhe Wines”) in which Plaintiff granted Songhe Wines a
credit line up to 60 million yuan for the term of February 20, 2020 to January
22, 2021; that same day, Plaintiff and Songhe Wines 
executed two Working Capital Loan Contracts, stipulating
that Plaintiff would extend two separate loans of 30 million yuan each to
Songhe Wines, with a loan term spanning from February 20, 2020, to February 20,
2022. Wenchen Zhu (“Zhu”) signed a surety contract for the above loans.
          Plaintiff disbursed 60 million yuan to
Songhe Wines on February 20, 2020. Songhe Wines was subsequently sued by
multiple banks, causing significant changes to its financial status in
violation of the loans. On or about July 8, 2020, Plaintiff declared the loans
prematurely terminated and requested that Songhe Wines immediately repay the
principal and interest. On July 21, 2020, Plaintiff sued Zhu and others in the
Higher People’s Court of Henan Province and on August 25, 2020 obtained a
judgment against Zhu and another defendant.
On April 26, 2024, Plaintiff filed a “Complaint for
Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign-County Money Judgment Under Uniform
Foreign County Money Judgments Recognition Act [CCP §§ 1713-1724]” against Zhu.
On June 26, 2024, Zhu’s default was entered.
Pending before the Court is Plaintiff’s default judgment
application.

 
Discussion
Plaintiff’s
Application for Default Judgment is denied without prejudice. The
following defects are noted:
          1.       Plaintiff
has failed to submit a brief summary of the case “identifying the parties and
the nature of plaintiff’s claim,” as per California Rules of Court, rule
3.1800, subdivision (a)(1).
          2.       Plaintiff
identified the defendant as “Wenchen Zhu” in the summons and complaint, proof
of service filed June 26, 2024 and Request for Entry of Default filed June 26,
2024, yet identifies the defendant in this default prove-up application as “Zhu
Wenchen.” The defendant is also identified as “Zhu Wenchen” in the English
translation of the Civil Judgment attached as Exhibit A to the Declaration of
Zhao Xiang (“Xiang”). The Court requests clarification as to the defendant’s
name.
          3.       Plaintiff
has not provided the Court with a calculation of interest as set forth in
Paragraph 3 of Hans Lin’s (“Lin”) declaration.
          4.       Lin
has not sufficiently authenticated Exhibit 1 to his declaration.
          5.       The party seeking
recognition of the foreign country judgment has the burden of establishing that
the judgment is entitled to recognition under the Act. (Code Civ. Proc., §
1715, subd. (c).) There are two requirements that must be met before California
will recognize and enforce a foreign country monetary judgment: (1) the foreign
country judgment “[g]rants or denies recovery of a sum of money” and (2) the
foreign country judgment “is final, conclusive, and enforceable” “[u]nder the
law of the foreign country where rendered.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1715, subd.
(a)(1) and (2).)
 Plaintiff has not met
this burden. The statements made by Xiang, particularly those contained in
Paragraphs 12-17, 20, 21, 23, and 24, are conclusory and devoid of any facts.
The Court is particularly interested in facts supporting Paragraph 15, given
that the Civil Judgment attached as Exhibit A to Xiang’s declaration reflects
that “Zhu Wenchen did not appear in the hearing” and did not submit a written
response. (Exh. A, pp. 2 and 4.) The Court requests that Plaintiff submit
briefing and declarations in this regard.
Accordingly, the application for default judgment is
denied without prejudice, and Plaintiff is directed to submit a revised default
judgment packet that addresses the aforementioned issues.
