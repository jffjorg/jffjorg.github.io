## English Summary:

Judge Upinder S. Kalra's tentative ruling grants the motion filed by Defendants Hill Farrer & Burrill LLP and Daniel J. McCarthy to appoint an arbitrator. This ruling stems from a dispute regarding a real estate and asset case filed by Plaintiffs against Defendants. 

The court acknowledges that an arbitration agreement exists between the parties, but they failed to agree on a method for appointing an arbitrator.  

Despite Plaintiffs initially expressing their intent to proceed with arbitration, they have not cooperated in the process.  Therefore, the Judge finds that the agreed-upon method for appointing an arbitrator is no longer viable.


The Court will order the parties to jointly propose a list of five arbitrators within 15 days. If they fail to cooperate, the non-participating party can submit their own list and explain their efforts to collaborate.  A further status hearing is scheduled for November 1, 2023.

```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion to appoint an arbitrator to resolve the dispute between the parties. The parties have been unable to agree on a method of appointing an arbitrator, and the court has therefore stepped in to appoint one. The court has ordered the parties to meet and confer and file a joint list of arbitrators for the court to select a list of five arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree on a list, the court will appoint an arbitrator from the list. The court has also ordered that if a party fails to cooperate in the selection process, the other party may file a list of their own choices accompanied by a declaration explaining their efforts to comply with the court's order and the failure on the part of the other party to cooperate. The court's goal is to expedite the selection of an arbitrator and resolve the dispute as quickly as possible.
