Tentative
Motion to be relieved as counsel is granted.
Background
On June 29, 2023, Geraldyne Lorna Harriston
(“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against City of Los Angeles (“Defendant”) and
Does 1 through 50, asserting causes of action for negligence and violation of
Government Code sections 815.2(a) and 820(a) arising out of an incident on June
30, 2021, in which the Los Angeles Police Department’s attempt to dispose of
illegal fireworks allegedly led to large explosion.
On November 6, 2023, Defendant filed an
answer.
On October 2, 2024, Plaintiff filed a First
Amended Complaint.
On October 3, 2024, Adam Valenzuela of Dordulian Law Firm (“Counsel”)
filed this motion to be relieved as counsel. No opposition has been filed. 
Legal
Standard
The court may order that an attorney be changed or
substituted at any time before or after judgment or final determination upon
request by either client or attorney and after notice from one to the other.
(Code of Civ. Proc., § 284(b).) An attorney is permitted to withdraw where
conflicts between the attorney and client make it unreasonable to continue the
representation. (See Cal. Rules of Prof. Conduct 3-700(C)(1).) “The
determination whether to grant or deny a motion to withdraw as counsel lies
within the sound discretion of the trial court.” (Manfredi & Levine v.
Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128, 1133.)   
 
An application to be relieved as counsel must be made on
Judicial Counsel Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion) (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1362(a)), MC-052 (Declaration) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.136(c)), and MC-053 (Proposed Order) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362(e)).   
 
Further, the requisite forms must be served on the client
and all other parties who have appeared in the case. (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.1362(d).) The court may delay effective date of the order relieving
counsel until proof of service of a copy of the signed order on the client has
been filed with the court. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(e).) 
 
Discussion
 
Counsel has
filed the Notice, Declaration and Order to be Relieved as Counsel. All
substantive and procedural requirements are satisfied.  Counsel states there has been a breakdown of
the attorney-client relationship.
 
The Court finds
there is good cause to relieve Counsel as attorney of record. 
 
Accordingly, the
motion is GRANTED.
Conclusion
The Court GRANTS
the motion to be relieved as counsel is GRANTED. 
The order is
effective upon filing with the Court a proof of service showing service of the
signed order (not just the minute order) on the client.
Moving counsel
to give notice.
