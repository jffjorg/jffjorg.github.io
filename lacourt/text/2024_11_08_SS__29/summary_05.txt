And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion of Counsel Sandeep G. Agarwal to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff Ventura Cruz Dominguez. Counsel has filed the required papers and satisfied all procedural requirements. The judge finds that there is good cause to grant the motion due to the plaintiff's nonresponsiveness, which has made it impossible for Counsel to represent him. The judge orders the Judicial Assistant to revise the proposed order to reflect the hearing on November 21, 2024, which is set to consider a motion to compel the plaintiff's deposition. The order will be effective upon filing with the court a proof of service showing service of the signed order on the client.
