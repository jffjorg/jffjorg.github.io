 Case Number:  22STCV32115    Hearing Date:   November 8, 2024    Dept:  29 Dominguez v. Orquiza
22STCV32115
Motion to be Relieved as Counsel, filed by Plaintiff’s
Counsel Sandeep G, Agarwal, Esq.
Tentative
The motion is granted.
Background
On September 30, 2022, Ventura Cruz Dominguez
(“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Ryan Andrew Alamrio Orquiza, Arline J.
Almario Orquiza, Rogelio R. Orquiza (collectively “Defendants”), and Does 1
through 20, asserting causes of action for motor vehicle negligence and
negligence per se arising out of an alleged automobile accident on October 7,
2020.
On February 7, 2024, Defendants filed an
answer.
On October 1, 2024, Sandeep G, Agarwal, Esq. of Law Offices of Bob Khakshooy
(“Counsel”) filed this motion to be relieved as counsel. No opposition has been
filed. 
Legal
Standard
The court may order that an attorney be changed or
substituted at any time before or after judgment or final determination upon
request by either client or attorney and after notice from one to the other.
(Code of Civ. Proc., § 284(b).) An attorney is permitted to withdraw where
conflicts between the attorney and client make it unreasonable to continue the
representation. (See Cal. Rules of Prof. Conduct 3-700(C)(1).) “The
determination whether to grant or deny a motion to withdraw as counsel lies
within the sound discretion of the trial court.” (Manfredi & Levine v.
Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128, 1133.)   
 
An application to be relieved as counsel must be made on
Judicial Counsel Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion) (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1362(a)), MC-052 (Declaration) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.136(c)), and MC-053 (Proposed Order) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362(e)).   
 
Further, the requisite forms must be served on the client
and all other parties who have appeared in the case. (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.1362(d).) The court may delay effective date of the order relieving
counsel until proof of service of a copy of the signed order on the client has
been filed with the court. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(e).) 
 
Discussion
 
Counsel has
filed the required papers and satisfied all procedural requirements. Counsel
states Plaintiff has become nonresponsive, which has made it impossible to
represent him. (Decl., No. 2.) The Court finds there is good cause to grant the
motion.
 
Subsequent to
the filing of this motion to withdraw, Defendants filed a motion to compel, set
for hearing on November 21, 2024.  The
order must be revised to include the information relating to the hearing.
Conclusion
The Court GRANTS
the motion to be relieved as counsel.
The Court
DIRECTS the Judicial Assistant to revise the proposed order, Item 7a to reflect
the hearing on November 21, 2024, and Item 7b to state that the subject matter
of the hearing is a Motion to Compel Plaintiff’s deposition. 
The order is
effective upon filing with the Court a proof of service showing service of the
signed order (not just the minute order) on the client.
Moving Counsel
is ordered to give notice.
