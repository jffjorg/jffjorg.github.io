Background
On June 28, 2023, Sara Dorantes (“Plaintiff”)
filed a complaint against the Plush Cellar, LLC, Rita Morales, Elizabeth Amanda
Morales, DBS Enterprises, Rombert Samuel Scuderi, Richard John Scuderi, and
Does 1 through 100, asserting causes of action for negligence, assault and
battery, and premises liability arising out of an alleged physical altercation on
May 28, 2023 at 2420 Daly Street in Los Angeles.

relieved as counsel. No opposition has been filed. 
Legal
Standard
The court may order that an attorney be changed or
substituted at any time before or after judgment or final determination upon
request by either client or attorney and after notice from one to the other.
(Code of Civ. Proc., § 284(b).) An attorney is permitted to withdraw where
conflicts between the attorney and client make it unreasonable to continue the
representation. (See Cal. Rules of Prof. Conduct 3-700(C)(1).) “The
determination whether to grant or deny a motion to withdraw as counsel lies
within the sound discretion of the trial court.” (Manfredi & Levine v.
Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128, 1133.)   
 
An application to be relieved as counsel must be made on
Judicial Counsel Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion) (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1362(a)), MC-052 (Declaration) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.136(c)), and MC-053 (Proposed Order) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362(e)).   
 
Further, the requisite forms must be served on the client
and all other parties who have appeared in the case. (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.1362(d).) The court may delay effective date of the order relieving
counsel until proof of service of a copy of the signed order on the client has
been filed with the court. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(e).) 
 
Discussion
 
Counsel has
filed the Notice, Declaration and Order to be Relieved as Counsel. Counsel has
met the procedural requirements. Counsel states there has been a breakdown of
the attorney-client relationship. 
 
All substantive
and procedural requirements are satisfied. 
The Court finds there is good cause to relieve Counsel as attorney of
record.
 
Accordingly, the
motion is GRANTED.
Conclusion
The motion to be
relieved as counsel is GRANTED. 
The order is
effective upon filing with the Court a proof of service showing service of the
signed order (not just the minute order) on the client.
Moving counsel
to give notice.
