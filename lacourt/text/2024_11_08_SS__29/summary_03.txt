And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to compel the plaintiff to comply with a demand for a medical examination. The defendant filed the motion without the required meet and confer declaration, which is a mandatory requirement under California Code of Civil Procedure section 2032.250. The judge found that the defendant did not make a reasonable and good faith attempt to resolve the issue through informal means, as required by the statute. The motion is denied without prejudice, meaning that the defendant may refile the motion with the required declaration.
