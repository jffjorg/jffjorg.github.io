 Case Number:  23STCV00047    Hearing Date:   November 8, 2024    Dept:  29 Carter v. City of Los Angeles
23STCV00047
Motion to be Relieved as Counsel, filed by Plaintiff’s
Counsel Loren B. Halpern, Esq.
Tentative
The motion is
granted.
Trial is continued.
Background
On January 3, 2023, Xavier Carter
(“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against City of Los Angeles (“Defendant”) and
Does 1 through 100, asserting a cause of action for premises liability arising
out of an alleged bicycle accident on June 3, 2022.
On July 24, 2023, Defendant filed an answer
and cross-complaint.
On October 15, 2024, Loren B. Halpern, Esq. (“Counsel”) filed a motion to
be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff. No opposition has been filed. 
Trial is set for the same day as the hearing.
Legal
Standard
The court may order that an attorney be changed or
substituted at any time before or after judgment or final determination upon
request by either client or attorney and after notice from one to the other.
(Code of Civ. Proc., § 284(b).) An attorney is permitted to withdraw where
conflicts between the attorney and client make it unreasonable to continue the
representation. (See Cal. Rules of Prof. Conduct 3-700(C)(1).) “The
determination whether to grant or deny a motion to withdraw as counsel lies
within the sound discretion of the trial court.” (Manfredi & Levine v.
Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128, 1133.)   
 
An application to be relieved as counsel must be made on
Judicial Counsel Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion) (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1362(a)), MC-052 (Declaration) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.136(c)), and MC-053 (Proposed Order) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362(e)).   
 
Further, the requisite forms must be served on the client
and all other parties who have appeared in the case. (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.1362(d).) The court may delay effective date of the order relieving
counsel until proof of service of a copy of the signed order on the client has
been filed with the court. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(e).) 
 
Discussion
Counsel has
filed and served the Notice, Declaration, and Order to be Relieved on Plaintiff
and Defendant and has satisfied all procedural requirements. Counsel states
that his withdrawal is mandatory under the California Rules of Professional
Conduct, but he has been unable to obtain a signed substitution of attorney. Counsel
attempted to confirm Plaintiff’s last known address by mailing motion papers to
the last known address with return receipt requested and calling Plaintiff’s
last known phone number. 
Counsel has satisfied
all procedural and substantive requirements. 
Good cause is shown.  The motion
is granted.
To protect Plaintiff
against undue prejudice from the granting of the motion, the date of trial is
continued for approximately 90 days.
The order must
be revised to reflect the new schedule.
Conclusion
The Court GRANTS
the motion to be relieved as counsel.
The Court CONTINUES
the trial to February __, 2025, at 8:30 am in Department 29 of the Spring
Street Courthouse.
The Court
CONTINUES the Final Status Conference to _________, 2025, at 10:00 am in
Department 29 of the Spring Street Courthouse.
All deadlines
are reset based on the new trial date.
The Judicial
Assistant is directed to revise the proposed order to reflect these new dates.
The order is
effective upon filing with the Court a proof of service showing service of the
signed order (not just the minute order) on the client.
Moving counsel
is ordered to give notice.
