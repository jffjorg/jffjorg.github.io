And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the defendant, Arya Shah, granting the defendant's motions to compel the plaintiff, Jessleen McDonnell and Lawrance Canlas, to respond to the defendant's form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and requests for production. The plaintiff failed to respond to the discovery requests, and the defendant did not need to show anything more to support the motions. The judge also denied the defendant's requests for sanctions, as the plaintiff did not oppose the motions. The judge ordered the plaintiff to provide written, verified, and code-compliant responses to the defendant's discovery requests within 15 days of notice.
