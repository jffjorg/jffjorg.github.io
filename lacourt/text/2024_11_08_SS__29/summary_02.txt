And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to file an amended cross-complaint, which seeks to add Plaintiff James Everling as a cross-defendant. The defendant claims that recent depositions have raised questions about whether Everling's actions caused the incident that resulted in the two plaintiffs falling on a dance floor. The judge finds that the defendant has shown good cause to amend the cross-complaint, and that the amendment will serve the interests of justice without significantly expanding the legal or factual issues of the case. The judge also denies, without prejudice, the "joinder" filed by Thalians and Carnelli, which seeks to file their own cross-complaint.
