Cruz, et al. vs SP+, et al. 
Moving Party: Plaintiff 
Responding Party: Defendant SP PLUS
CORPORATION
Notice: Sufficient 
Ruling: MOTION FOR TRIAL PREFERENCE IS DENIED; PARTIES AND COURT TO ADDRESS TSC
 
Background
On September 9, 2019,
Plaintiff filed this lawsuit. In 2019, Defendants SP Plus and Rodolfo
Echevarria filed their answer. From February 2021 to May 2023, the parties
conducted discovery and were ready to proceed to trial in May 2023. In June
2023, the parties submitted a Long Cause Packet to Department 1.
From July 2023 to
August 2024, the court noted deficiencies in the parties' Long Cause Packet,
causing the parties to amend the packet multiple times. On August 30, 2024,
Counsel for Defendant stated they no longer considered this a long cause matter
and would be editing the witness list to reflect their changed position.
The five-year deadline,
including a six-month extension due to emergency rules, is March 9, 2025.
Defendant did not stipulate to Plaintiff’s request to extend the five-year
deadline. Plaintiff now moves the Court for trial preference, seeking a trial
sometime in January 2025.
Discussion
Plaintiff’s motion for
trial preference is made under CCP § 36(e), which allows the Court discretion
to grant a motion for preference when the "interests of justice will be
served by granting this preference." The basis for Plaintiff's request is
that the case is nearing its five-year statutory deadline, and trial preference
is necessary to avoid potential delays, such as unavailability of the court,
which could cause the case to miss the deadline. Plaintiff alleges the parties
are ready to proceed to trial, and no prejudice will result from granting the
motion.
Defendants argue that
Plaintiff’s motion is premature because a trial setting conference is already
scheduled for October 23, 2024, and trial is expected to commence before the
five-year deadline in March 2025.
The Court’s decision to
grant or deny discretionary trial preference requires an evaluation of various
factors, including the court’s calendar, any dilatory conduct by Plaintiff,
potential prejudice to Defendant from an accelerated trial date, and the risk
of mandatory dismissal if trial preference is denied (Mitchell v. Frank R.
Howard Memorial Hospital (1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 1396, 1404). The Court may
also consider specific circumstances, such as Plaintiff's advanced age or
health conditions, the potential need for live testimony, or other factors that
may impact the fairness of the trial (Salas v. Sears (1986) 42 Cal.3d
342).
The
Court finds that granting trial preference is unnecessary, as Department 1
takes into account the 5-year statute when making trial assignments.  That said, both parties have completed
discovery and have been ready to proceed to trial since June 2023. Accordingly,
the Court intends to set trial for a date as soon as possible and will discuss
that with the parties today.
