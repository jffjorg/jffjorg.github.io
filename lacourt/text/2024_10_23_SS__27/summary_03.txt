And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has taken the motion to tax costs off the calendar due to the pending appeal of the September 9, 2024 judgment against the plaintiff. The defendant had filed a memorandum of costs to recover certain litigation-related costs, and the plaintiff subsequently filed a motion to tax those costs. However, since the plaintiff has filed a notice of appeal, the motion to tax costs is stayed pending the resolution of the appeal. The court has also set a status conference for December xx, 2024, to discuss the appeal.
