And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for trial preference, seeking a trial date in January 2025. The plaintiff argued that the case is nearing its five-year statutory deadline and that trial preference is necessary to avoid potential delays. The defendant opposed the motion, claiming it is premature since a trial setting conference is already scheduled for October 2024 and trial is expected to commence before the deadline. The judge found that granting trial preference is unnecessary, as the court takes into account the five-year statute when making trial assignments. The judge did, however, intend to set trial for a date as soon as possible and will discuss this with the parties at the trial setting conference.
