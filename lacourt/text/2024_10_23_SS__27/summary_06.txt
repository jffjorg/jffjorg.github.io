And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion to continue the trial date for the slip-and-fall case. The parties had requested a continuance because of a scheduled mediation and outstanding discovery matters, including the deposition of Ryan Gomez and an Independent Medical Examination (IME) on the plaintiff. The judge acknowledges that there are still some discovery matters to be completed, but notes that most of the discovery should have been done by now. The judge is willing to reopen fact discovery for the deposition of Mr. Gomez and the IME, but will not continue the trial date. The judge also notes that the case has been pending for over two years and that the parties should have scheduled mediation and completed discovery more quickly.
