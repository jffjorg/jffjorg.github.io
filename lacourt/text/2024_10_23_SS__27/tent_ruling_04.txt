Plaintiff has declared that he will fully participate in discovery, including attending the second medical examination previously ordered by the Court on May 22, 2024. Plaintiff further declares that he will work with his attorney to provide availability for the examination and will comply with all future Court orders. Given Plaintiff’s expressed willingness to engage in discovery and abide by Court directives, the Court will not impose terminating sanctions at this time. The parties are directed to meet and confer to schedule the examination at the earliest mutually agreeable date. However, since terminating sanctions have been relieved, the Court imposes monetary sanctions in the amount of $2,000 against both Plaintiff and his attorney of record for forcing Defendant to file a motion for sanctions due to Plaintiff’s refusal and failure to comply with the Court’s May 22, 2024, order to attend the IME. The sanctions are payable to Defendant within 20 days of today. PLEASE TAKE NOTICE:    If a party intends to submit on this tentative ruling,¿the party must send an email to the court at¿sscdept27@lacourt.org¿with the Subject line “SUBMIT” followed by the case number.¿The body of the email must include the hearing date and time, counsel’s contact information, and the identity of the party submitting.   Unless¿all¿parties submit by email to this tentative ruling, the parties should arrange to appear remotely (encouraged) or in person for oral argument.¿You should assume that others may appear at the hearing to argue.   If the parties neither submit nor appear at hearing, the Court may take the motion off calendar or adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the Court.¿ After the Court has issued a tentative ruling, the Court may prohibit the withdrawal of the subject motion.
