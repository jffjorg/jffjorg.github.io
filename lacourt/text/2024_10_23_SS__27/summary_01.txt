And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling regarding a motion to toll the five-year deadline in a case between Mari Tarpinian and LACMTA et al. The motion is moot because the parties had previously stipulated to an extension of the deadline to August 31, 2025, and set a trial date for July 15, 2025. The court has taken the motion off calendar and set a hearing date for October 23, 2024. The parties are required to submit to the tentative ruling by email or appear remotely or in person for oral argument. If the parties do not submit or appear, the court may take the motion off calendar or adopt the tentative ruling as the final order.
