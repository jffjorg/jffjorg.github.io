The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion for relief. The plaintiff has agreed to fully participate in discovery, including attending a second medical examination previously ordered by the court. The court has not imposed terminating sanctions at this time due to the plaintiff's expressed willingness to comply with court directives. However, the court has imposed monetary sanctions in the amount of $2,000 against both the plaintiff and his attorney for forcing the defendant to file a motion for sanctions due to the plaintiff's refusal to comply with a previous court order. The parties are directed to meet and confer to schedule the examination at the earliest mutually agreeable date.
