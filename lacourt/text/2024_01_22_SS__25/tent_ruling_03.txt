BACKGROUND
 
On March 08, 2022, Plaintiff Nishantha Pitigala
(“Plaintiff”) filed a cause of action against Defendant Citibank (“Defendant”
or Citibank”) for breach of fiduciary duty. 
 
On October 30, 2023, Plaintiff requested entry of default
against Defendant and default was entered by the Clerk on the same day. 
 
On December 07, 2023, Defendant filed the instant Motion
to Set Aside Default and for Leave to Defend Action. 
 
No opposition has been filed. 
 
MOVING PARTY
POSITION
 
Defendant prays for the Court to set aside the default
entered against Defendant on October 30, 2023 pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 473.5.
Defendant argues that it did not receive actual notice of the litigation
because Plaintiff’s issuance of personal service on CT Corporation was
improper. Defendant asserts that CT Corporation System is not and was not Citibank’s
agent for service of process at the time Plaintiff rendered personal service on
March 09, 2022, and only became aware once it was notified of its default. Because
service was improperly rendered, resulting in Defendant not receiving actual
notice, Defendant argues the Court must set aside default.

ANALYSIS
 
I.          Legal
Standard
A court may set aside a default
or default judgment when service of summons has not provided a party with actual
notice.  Code of Civil Procedure § 473.5 states: 
 
“(a) When service of a summons has not resulted in actual
notice to a party in time to defend the action and a default or default
judgment has been entered against him or her in the action, he or she may serve
and file a notice of motion to set aside the default or default judgment and
for leave to defend the action. The notice of motion shall be served and filed
within a reasonable time, but in no event exceeding the earlier of: (i) two
years after entry of a default judgment against him or her; or (ii) 180 days
after service on him or her of a written notice that the default or default
judgment has been entered. 
 
(b) A notice of motion to set aside a default or default
judgment and for leave to defend the action shall designate as the time for
making the motion a date prescribed by subdivision (b) of Section 1005, and it
shall be accompanied by an affidavit showing under oath that the party’s lack
of actual notice in time to defend the action was not caused by his or her
avoidance of service or inexcusable neglect. The party shall serve and file
with the notice a copy of the answer, motion, or other pleading proposed to be
filed in the action. 
 
(c) Upon a finding by the court that the motion was made
within the period permitted by subdivision (a) and that his or her lack of
actual notice in time to defend the action was not caused by his or her
avoidance of service or inexcusable neglect, it may set aside the default or
default judgment on whatever terms as may be just and allow the party to defend
the action.” 
 
Additionally, “‘[s]ervice
of process, under longstanding tradition in our system of justice, is
fundamental to any procedural imposition on a named defendant.’
[Citation.]”  (AO Alfa-Bank v. Yakovlev (2018) 21¿Cal.App.5th 189,
202.)  “To establish personal jurisdiction, compliance with statutory
procedures for service of process is essential.”  (Kremerman v. White (2021).
71 Cal.App.5th 358, 371.)  Defendant’s knowledge of the action does not
dispense with statutory requirements for service of summons.  (Kappel
v. Bartlett (1988) 200 Cal.App.3d 1457, 1466.) 
 
“A defendant, on or before the
last day of his or her time to plead or within any further time that the court
may for good cause allow” may move “to quash service of summons on the ground
of lack of jurisdiction of the court over him or her” that results from lack of
proper service.  (Code of Civ. Proc. § 418.10(a)(1).  A defendant has
30 days after the service of the summons to file a responsive pleading. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 412.20(a)(3).) 
 
“When a
defendant challenges the court’s personal jurisdiction on the ground of
improper service of process ‘the burden is on the plaintiff to prove the
existence of jurisdiction by proving, inter alia, the facts requisite to an
effective service.’” (Summers v.
McClanahan¿(2006) 140 Cal.App.4th 403, 413.) 
 
II.        Discussion 
 
On March 24, 2022, Plaintiff filed a Proof of Service,
showing that on March 09, 2022, Defendant was served by Personal Service. Specifically,
the Summons, complaint, and other documents were left with Daisy Montenegro, an
authorized person, at 330 North NBrand Blvd. Ste. 700, Glendale, CA, 91203.
(03-24-22 Proof of Service.; See also 10-30-23 Proof of Service.) The Proof of
Service is signed by a registered California process server under penalty of
perjury and a declaration of diligence is attached. (Id.). “Evidence
Code section 647 provides that a registered process server’s declaration of
service establishes a presumption affecting the burden of producing evidence of
the facts stated in the declaration.  [Citation.]”  (American
Express Centurion Bank v. Zara (2011) 199¿Cal.App.4th 383, 390; Evid. Code
§ 647.) 
 
Defendant’s
motion is timely filed. Here, since no default judgment has been entered, Defendant
needed to have filed the motion within 180 days of service of written notice that the default had been entered.
Here, Default was entered on October 30, 2023. (10-30-23 Request for Default.)
Defendant first learned of the default on November 13, 2023, when it received Plaintiff’s
request to take its default. (Mot. p.5:2-3; Citibank Decl. ¶ 9.) Defendant
would subsequently file the instant motion on December 07, 2023. Thus, the
Court finds that the motion is timely made. 
 
Defendant submits its affidavit as well as the affidavit of
its counsel, in which both explain that Plaintiff served the Summons and
Complaint on CT Corporation System as the purported agent for service of
process for Citibank. (Kelly Andrew Beall Decl. ¶ 4, Exh. 1; Citibank Decl. ¶
5.) However, Defendant’s records indicate that it was never served with summons
in this case and that moreover CT Corporation System was not and currently is
not Citibank’s agent for service. (Citibank Decl. ¶¶ 4,6.) Counsel for
Defendant states that on November 07, 2023, she sent a letter requesting
Plaintiff to execute a stipulation to set aside the default and several emails
requesting the same but to no avail. (Beall Decl. ¶¶ 6-7, Exhs. 2-3.) 
 
No opposition has been filed by
the Plaintiff. 
 
Thus, the Court finds that
Defendant has overcome the presumption established by the Proof of Service
filed on both October 30, 2023, and March 24, 2022. Here, Defendant provides
evidence that they had no knowledge of the litigation against them and that the
service was improper as it was served on CT Corporation System who is not an
identified agent for Citibank.
 
Thus,
Defendant’s Motion to Set Aside Default is GRANTED.  Defendant includes a proposed Motion to Quash
Service of Summons with its Motion to Set Aside Default to be filed in this
action.  
 
III.       Conclusion 
            
            Defendant Citibank,
N.A.’s Motion to Set Aside Default is GRANTED. Default
entered on October 30, 2023, is
hereby VACATED.  
 
Defendant is ordered to visit the Court’s Reservation System
(CRS) today to reserve a date for its hearing on Motion to Quash Service of
Summons, and to file said noticed Motion to Quash Service of Summons within 20 days
of this Court’s ruling.
