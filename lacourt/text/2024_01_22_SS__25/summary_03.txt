**Tentative Ruling**

The Court rules that the Defendant's Motion to Set Aside Default is granted. The default entered on October 30, 2023, is vacated. The Defendant asserts that it did not receive actual notice of the litigation because the service of process was improper. The Court finds that the Defendant has overcome the presumption established by the Proof of Service filed on both October 30, 2023, and March 24, 2022. The Defendant provides evidence that it had no knowledge of the litigation against it and that the service was improper as it was served on CT Corporation System who is not an identified agent for Citibank. The Court grants the motion and orders the Defendant to visit the Court's Reservation System (CRS) today to reserve a date for its hearing on Motion to Quash Service of Summons, and to file said noticed Motion to Quash Service of Summons within 20 days of this Court's ruling.
