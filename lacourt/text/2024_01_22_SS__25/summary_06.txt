And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to deem the matters specified in the Request for Admissions, Set One, as true against the defendant. The defendant failed to serve timely verified responses to the plaintiff's Request for Admissions, which is a misuse of the discovery process. As a result, the court is required to impose a monetary sanction on the defendant in the amount of $460.00, which is the reasonable expense incurred by the plaintiff's counsel in filing and arguing the motion.
