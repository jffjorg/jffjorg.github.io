ANALYSIS
 
I.          Legal
Standard
Under Code of Civil Procedure, section 473, subdivision
(b), “the court may, upon any terms as may be just, relieve a party or his or
her legal representative from a judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding
taken against him or her through his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or
excusable neglect.” (Code Civ. Proc., §473(b)). Relief under this section is
mandatory when based on an attorney affidavit of fault; otherwise, it is
discretionary. (Id.) An application for relief must be made no more than
six months after entry of the order from which relief is sought and must be
accompanied by an affidavit of fault attesting to the moving party’s mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, or neglect. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b); English
v. IKON Business Solutions (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 130, 143.) When relief
from default and a default judgment is based on an attorney affidavit of fault,
the six-month period starts to run from the date of the entry of the default
judgment. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, sub. (b); Sugasawara v. Newland
(1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 294, 295.) 
 
II.        Discussion 
 
Plaintiff moves to set aside default judgement under Section
473(b). Plaintiff argues that the dismissal of the wrong defendant was due to
its attorney’s mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect and thus prays for
mandatory relief under Section 473(b). 
 
Here, the Court finds the Motion to
be timely. CCP section 473(b) provides that an application for relief must be
made no more than six months after entry of the order from which it was sought.
Here, Plaintiff’s request to dismiss Abbie Lill was entered on June 05, 2023. (06/05/2023
Request for Dismissal.) Plaintiff filed its motion on October 26, 2023, well
within the six-month deadline. 
Plaintiff
provides the Court with a declaration from its Counsel, Joseph Pleasant.
(Joseph Pleasant Decl.) Plaintiff’s counsel avers that he mistakenly caused Defendant
Lill to be dismissed by asking another attorney in Counsel’s office, “(…to sign
the dismissal and instructing my staff to file it) believing [Defendant Lill]
was the driver of rear vehicle. (Id. ¶ 3.) Counsel meant to dismiss Defendants
Salinas and Fuentes as Salinas was driving the rear vehicle, not Lill. (Id.)
When Counsel was later advised of the mistake, he then caused Salinas and
Fuentes to be dismissed “(by asking Susan Benson in my office to sign the
dismissal and instructing my staff to file it).” (Id.) When counsel
tried to file an amended complaint, he was informed by the clerk that he needed
to file a motion to vacate the dismissal of Lill. (Id. ¶ 4.) Thus, based on
Counsel’s declaration the Court finds that the error was caused by Plaintiff’s
counsel’s mistake, inadvertence,
or excusable neglect and therefore entitles Plaintiff to mandatory relief under
Section 473(b). 
 
            Therefore, since
the motion complies with section 473(b), Plaintiff is entitled to mandatory relief.

 
            Accordingly,
the Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion to vacate dismissal. 
 
III.       Conclusion 
            
            Plaintiff’s Motion to Vacate Dismissal is GRANTED.  The dismissal entered on June 05, 2023, as to
Defendant Lill is hereby vacated.
