BACKGROUND
 
On March 16, 2023, Plaintiff GCFS
Inc. (“Plaintiff”) filed two causes of action against Defendant Zachary T.
Cadwallader aka Zach Cadwallader, individually and dba Zach Cadwallader (“Defendant”)
for breach of contract and common counts, seeking damages in the amount of $2,639.53.

 
Defendant filed his Answer on May
04, 2023.
 
On October 25, 2023, Plaintiff filed the
instant Motion to Deem Requests for Admission Admitted and Request for Monetary
Sanctions (the “Motion”) against Defendant. No opposition was filed. 
 
MOVING PARTY
POSITION
 
Plaintiff requests the Court order that the genuineness
of the documents and the truths of the matters specified in the Request for
Admissions, Set One, (“RFA’s”) be deemed admitted. Plaintiff argues that
the motion is necessary as Defendant failed to serve responses under section
2033.280. Plaintiff additionally seeks $460.00 in sanctions for court fees totaling
$60.00 and attorney’s fees totaling $400.00 for two hours, at a rate of $200
per hour, for work on the motion.

ANALYSIS
 
I.          Legal
Standard
A party must respond to requests for
admissions within 30 days after service of such requests. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.250,
subd. (a).)  “If a party to whom requests for admission are directed fails
to serve a timely response…(a) [that party] waives any objection to the
requests, including one based on privilege or on the protection for work
product…” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (a).) “The requesting party may
move for an order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any
matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary
sanction under Chapter 7.” (Id. at subd. (b).)  A motion dealing
with the failure to respond, rather than with inadequate responses, does not
require the requesting party to meet and confer with the responding party. (Deymer
v. Costa Mesa Mobile Home Estates (1995) 36 Cal.App.4th 393, 395, fn. 4
[disapproved on other grounds in Wilcox v. Birtwhistle (1999) 21 Cal.4th
973]). There is no time limit within which a motion to have matters deemed
admitted must be made. (Brigante v. Huang (1993) 20 Cal.App.4th 1569,
1585.)  
 
II.        Discussion 
 
Plaintiff moves for an order that the genuineness of the
documents and the truth of the matters specified in the Requests for Admission (Set
One) be deemed admitted. Plaintiff argues that the motion is necessary
as Defendant has failed to serve verified responses under section 2033.280.
Plaintiff additionally seeks sanctions against Defendant for the fees incurred
filing and arguing the motion. 
 
 
A.         Request for Admissions
Plaintiff
provides the Court with a declaration from Plaintiff’s counsel. Plaintiff’s
counsel declares that his office served Defendant with Plaintiff’s Requests for
Admission, Set One, (RFAs) on May 17, 2023. (Gary A. Bemis Decl., ¶ 3; Exh. 2.)
Around July 12, 2023, Plaintiff’s Counsel noticed no responses had been
received as to Plaintiff’s RFAs after revieing his file, thus necessitating the
motion. (Id. ¶ 4.)  Plaintiff’s
counsel subsequently served Defendant a meet and confer letter advising Defendant’s
counsel to provide responsive answers to Plaintiff’s discovery request by July
26, 2023, to avoid filing the instant motion. (Id.; Exh. 1.) The Court
presumes that since the issuance of the “meet and confer” letter, no responses
have been filed. 
 Here, the Court finds that more than 30 days have
lapsed since Defendant was served with Plaintiff’s RFAs because Defendant has not
submitted verified responses within the initial 30 days or after Plaintiff’s
July 26, 2023, extension. Thus, since Defendant has not provided Plaintiff’s
with verified responses to Plaintiff’s RFAs within 30 days of its service, Plaintiff
is entitled to pursue the motion. Therefore, Plaintiff is entitled to an order
deeming Plaintiff’s Requests for Admission, Set One, admitted against Defendant
pursuant to CCP, § 2033.280. 
            
B.         Sanctions
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.030,
subdivision (a) provides, in pertinent part, that the court may impose a
monetary sanction on a party engaging in the misuse of the discovery process to
pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone
because of that conduct. A misuse of the discovery process includes failing to
respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2023.010, subd. (d).) Furthermore, it is “mandatory that the Court impose a
monetary sanction…on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a
timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).) 
 
The Court finds Defendant’s
failure to respond to Plaintiff’s Requests for Admissions, Set One, a misuse of
the discovery process. The Court is also required to impose a monetary sanction
on Defendant for their failure to respond to the Requests for Admission that
necessitated this motion under Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.280,
subdivision (c). 
 
Plaintiff’s counsel seeks
sanctions in the amount of $460.00, based on two (2) hours of attorney time
billed at $200.00 per hour for work on the motion and a filing fee of $60.00. (Bemis
Decl., ¶ 5.)  The Court finds the amount reasonable
given the simplicity of this Motion and the lack of opposition and reply. Accordingly,
Plaintiff’s request for sanctions is GRANTED.
 
III.       Conclusion 
            
            Plaintiff GCFS, Inc.’s Motion to Deem Requests for
Admission Admitted is GRANTED. THE COURT DEEMS THE MATTERS WITHIN PLAINTIFF’S
REQUEST FOR ADMISSIONS, SET ONE, AS TRUE AGAINST DEFENDANT. 
 
DEFENDANT ZACHARY
T. CADWALLADER AKA ZACH CADWALLADER, individually and DBA ZACH CADWALLADER IS ORDERED TO PAY $460.00 TO
PLAINTIFF’S COUNSEL WITHIN THIRTY (30) DAYS OF SERVICE OF THIS ORDER. 
 
Moving party is ordered to give
notice.
