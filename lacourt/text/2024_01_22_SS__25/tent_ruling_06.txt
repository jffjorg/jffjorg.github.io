BACKGROUND
 
On August 12, 2022, Plaintiff State
Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company (“Plaintiff”) filed a subrogation action
against Defendant Jasmin Giselle Guzman (“Defendant”) seeking damages in the
amount of $4,262.37 for a motor vehicle accident involving Defendant and
Plaintiff’s insured. 
 
On November 17, 2023, Plaintiff filed the
instant Motion to Deem Request for Admissions Admitted and Request for Monetary
Sanctions (the “Motion”) against Defendant. No opposition was filed. 
 
MOVING PARTY
POSITION
 
Plaintiff requests the Court order that the genuineness
of the documents and the truth of the matters specified in Plainitff’s Request
for Admissions, Set One, (“RFA’s”) be deemed admitted. Plaintiff argues
that the motion is necessary as Defendant failed to serve timely verified responses
under CCP Section 2033.280. Plaintiff additionally seeks $460.00 in sanctions for
court fees totaling $60.00 and attorney’s fees totaling $400.00 for two (2)
hours, at a rate of $200 per hour, for work on the motion.

ANALYSIS
 
I.          Legal
Standard
A party must respond to requests for
admissions within 30 days after service of such requests. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2033.250, subd. (a).)  “If a party to whom requests for admission are
directed fails to serve a timely response…(a) [that party] waives any objection
to the requests, including one based on privilege or on the protection for work
product…” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (a).) “The requesting party may
move for an order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any
matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary
sanction under Chapter 7.” (Id. at subd. (b).)  A motion dealing
with the failure to respond, rather than with inadequate responses, does not
require the requesting party to meet and confer with the responding party. (Deymer
v. Costa Mesa Mobile Home Estates (1995) 36 Cal.App.4th 393, 395, fn. 4
[disapproved on other grounds in Wilcox v. Birtwhistle (1999) 21 Cal.4th
973]). There is no time limit within which a motion to have matters deemed
admitted must be made. (Brigante v. Huang (1993) 20 Cal.App.4th 1569,
1585.)  
 
II.        Discussion 
 
Plaintiff moves for the Court to issue an order that the
genuineness of the documents and the truth of the matters specified in the
Request for Admissions (Set One) be deemed admitted. Plaintiff argues
that the motion is necessary as Defendant has failed to serve verified responses
under section 2033.280. Plaintiff additionally seeks sanctions against
Defendant for the fees incurred filing and arguing the motion. 
 
A.         Request for Admissions
Plaintiff
provides the Court with a declaration of its counsel. Counsel declares that her
office served Defendant with Plaintiff’s Requests for Admission, Set One,
(RFAs) on March 28, 2023. (Janelle McCammack Decl., ¶ 1; Exh. A.) Defendant’s
responses were initially set to be due on May 01, 2023. (Id. ¶ 2.)
Counsel states that multiple extensions were given to Defendant’s counsel,
extending the deadline to provide verified responses to May 17, 2023. On June
14, 2023, Defendant’s counsel served unverified responses to Plaintiff’s RFAs.
(Id. ¶ 3,4; Exh. B.) On April 20, 2023, Plaintiff served Defendant a
meet and confer letter advising Defendant that, her unverified responses were
equivalent to no responses at all. (Id. ¶ 5; Exh. C.) Plaintiff declares
that to date no statutory compliant responses have been served on Plaintiff. (Id.
¶ 6.) 
 The Court finds Defendant’s responses to be
unverified. CCP § 2033.240 (a) states that a “party to whom the requests for
admission are directed shall sign the response under oath, unless the response
contains only objections.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.240 subd. (a).) CCP §
2033.240(c) further states that “the attorney for the responding party shall
sign any response that contains an objection.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.240
subd. (c).) Courts have held that, “[u]nsworn responses are tantamount to no
responses at all.” (Appleton v. Superior Court (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d
632, 636.) 
Here, Defendant’s
responses are unverified because it does not contain the Defendant’s signature,
but rather Defendant’s counsel’s signature. (McCammack Decl. Exh. B.) The Court
notes that Defendant’s responses do not contain any objections, nor does it
contain only objections. Thus, Defendant is required to sign the responses
under oath rather than her attorney. Here, since Defendant did not do so, the
responses are not considered verified under CCP § 2033.240(a). Thus, since
Defendant has not provided Plaintiff’s with verified responses to Plaintiff’s
RFAs within 30 days of its service, and Plaintiff is entitled an order deeming Plaintiff’s
Requests for Admission, Set One, admitted against Defendant pursuant to CCP §
2033.280. 
            
B.         Sanctions
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.030,
subdivision (a) provides, in pertinent part, that the court may impose a
monetary sanction on a party engaging in the misuse of the discovery process to
pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone
because of that conduct. A misuse of the discovery process includes failing to
respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2023.010, subd. (d).) Furthermore, it is “mandatory that the Court impose a
monetary sanction…on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a
timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).) 
 
The Court finds Defendant’s
failure to respond to Plaintiff’s Requests for Admissions, Set One, a misuse of
the discovery process. The Court is also required to impose a monetary sanction
on Defendant for their failure to respond to the Requests for Admission that
necessitated this motion under Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.280,
subdivision (c). 
 
Plaintiff seeks sanctions in the
amount of $460.00, based on two (2) hours of attorney time billed at $200.00
per hour and a filing fee of $60.00. (McCammack Decl., ¶ 7.) The Court finds
the amount reasonable given the simplicity of this Motion and the lack of
opposition and reply. Accordingly, Plaintiff’s request for sanctions is
GRANTED.
 
III.       Conclusion 
            
            Plaintiff State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company’s
Motion to Deem Request for Admissions Admitted is GRANTED. THE COURT DEEMS THE
MATTERS WITHIN PLAINTIFF’S REQUEST FOR ADMISSIONS, SET ONE, AS TRUE AGAINST
DEFENDANT. DEFENDANT IS ORDERED TO PAY $460.00 TO PLAINTIFF’S COUNSEL WITHIN THIRTY
(30) DAYS OF SERVICE OF THIS ORDER. 
 
Moving party is ordered to give
notice.
