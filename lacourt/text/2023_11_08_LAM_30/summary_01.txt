The Tentative Ruling denies Plaintiff Antoinette Lima-Washington's motion for leave to file a Third Amended Complaint (TAC). The motion was opposed by Defendants Pasadena Unified School District and Michael Bell. The court finds that the Plaintiff has not satisfied the procedural requirements for amendment, as specified in California Rules of Court, rule 3.1324. Specifically, the Plaintiff has not identified which facts are newly discovered, specified when the facts were discovered, or explained why the amendment is necessary and proper. Therefore, the motion is denied.
