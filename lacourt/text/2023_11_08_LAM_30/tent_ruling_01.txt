Lima-Washington vs. Pasadena Unified School
District, et. al., Case
No. 22STCV15523
 
Tentative Ruling re: 
Plaintiff’s Motion for Leave to File Third Amended Complaint
 
            Plaintiff Antoinette Lima-Washington
(Plaintiff) moves for leave to file the Third Amended Complaint (TAC). The
motion is opposed by Defendants Pasadena Unified School District and Michael
Bell (collectively, Defendants). The motion is denied.
 
The court may, in its discretion and
after notice to the adverse party, allow, upon any terms as may be just, an
amendment to any pleading, including adding or striking out the name of any
party, or correcting a mistake in the name of a party, or a mistake in any
other respect. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (a)(1).)  
California courts are required to
permit liberal amendment of pleadings in the interest of justice between the
parties to an action. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (a); Dieckmann v. Superior Court (1985) 175 Cal.App.3d 345, 352.)
“Public policy dictates that leave to amend be liberally granted.” (Centex Homes v. St. Paul Fire & Marine
Ins. Co. (2015) 237 Cal.App.4th 23, 32.) 

The policy in favor of allowing
amendments is also so strong that “courts are bound to apply a policy of great
liberality in permitting amendments to the complaint at any state of the
proceedings, up to and including trial.” (Atkinson
v. Elk Corp. (2003) 109 Cal.App.4th 739, 761.) “The law is well settled
that a long-deferred presentation of the proposed amendment without a showing
of excuse for the delay is itself a significant factor to uphold the trial
court's denial of the amendment.” (Leader
v. Health Ind. of America, Inc. (2001) 89 Cal.App.4th 603, 613.) However,
while unwarranted delay in requesting leave to amend is one factor, courts will
only deny leave if there if there has also been prejudice to the other side. (Higgins
v. Del Faro (1981) 123
Cal.App.3d 558, 564-565.)
 
Under California Rules of Court, rule
3.1324:
(a)   A motion to amend a pleading before
trial must: 
(1) Include a copy of
the proposed amendment or amended pleading, which must be serially numbered to
differentiate it from previous pleadings or amendments; 
(2) State what
allegations in the previous pleading are proposed to be deleted if any, and
where, by page, paragraph, and line number, the deleted allegations are
located; and 
(3) State what
allegations are proposed to be added to the previous pleading, if any, and
where, by page, paragraph, and line number, the additional allegations are
located.
 
Subdivision (b) of rule 3.1324 requires
the motion be accompanied by a separate, supporting declaration, specifying:
(1) the amendment’s
effect; 
(2) why the amendment
is necessary and proper; 
(3) when the facts
giving rise to the amended allegations were discovered; and 
(4) the reasons why
the request for amendment was not made earlier.
 
The proposed TAC adds causes of action
for Retaliation under CFRA (Gov. Code § 12945.2) and Negligent Supervision,
adds factual allegations regarding prior lawsuits against Defendant Pasadena
Unified School District, and makes various edits. (Cook Decl. ¶ 10, Ex. A.) 
 
While Plaintiff’s counsel states in her
declaration that “[n]ewly added facts, as set forth below were discovered
during the course of investigation and extensive discovery completed as of
today” (Cook Decl. ¶ 4), neither counsel nor Plaintiff’s motion has identified which
facts are newly discovered, specified “when the facts giving rise to the
amended allegations were discovered,” or explained “why the amendment is
necessary and proper.” (Rules of Court, rule 3.1324, subd. (b).) Because
Plaintiff has not satisfied the procedural requirements for amendment, the
motion is denied.
