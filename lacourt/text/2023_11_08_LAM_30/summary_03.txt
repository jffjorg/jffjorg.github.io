Summary of the tentative ruling:

The court has granted the motion to compel response filed by Manifest Destiny Transport Co. et al. (MD Transport) against South Bay Freight Systems, LLC et al. (SB Freight). The motion was filed to compel SB Freight to produce further responses to the Post-Judgment Special Interrogatories and Requests for Production. The court has awarded monetary sanctions to MD Transport in the amount of $9,679.50.

The court found that SB Freight's responses to the interrogatories and requests for production were evasive and incomplete. The court also found that SB Freight's objections to the requests for production were unavailing. The court ordered SB Freight to produce all responsive documents within its possession, custody, or control.

The court also noted that SB Freight's dissolution in May 2017 did not exempt it from the requirement to respond to the interrogatories and requests for production. The court further noted that SB Freight's attempts to limit its production to "documents sufficient to show its assets" or "documents sufficient to show its customers" were not justified.

The court's ruling is based on the Code of Civil Procedure sections 708.020, 708.030, 2030.010, 2031.010, 2031.220, and 2031.280. The court's decision is in line with the California Supreme Court's holding that a party may not provide "deftly worded conclusionary answers designed to evade a series of explicit questions" and that a party must provide a "proper solution" to a series of explicit questions.
