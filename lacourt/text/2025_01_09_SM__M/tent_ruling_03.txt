Legal
Standard
 
Relief under Code of Civil Procedure section 473(b)
is either discretionary or mandatory. A motion for mandatory relief must be
made no more than six months after entry of judgment and be accompanied by an
attorney’s sworn affidavit attesting to the attorney’s “mistake, inadvertence,
surprise or neglect.” (CCP § 473(b).) The attorney affidavit of fault must
contain a “straight forward admission of fault.” (State Farm Fire &
Casualty Co. v. Pietak (2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 600, 610.) But it need
not contain an explanation of the reasons for the attorney’s mistake,
inadvertence surprise or neglect. (Martin
Potts & Assocs., Inc. v. Corsair, LLC (2016) 244 Cal.App.4th 432, 438-441.) Relief must be granted
“unless the court finds that the default or dismissal was not in fact caused by
the attorney's mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect.” (Ibid.) If mandatory relief is
granted, the court must “direct
the attorney to pay reasonable compensatory legal fees and costs” to the
opposing counsel or parties. (CCP § 473(b).)
 
Where a party cannot obtain an attorney affidavit of
fault, the party may seek discretionary relief under section 473(b) due to
“mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.” (CCP § 473(b).) A
motion for discretionary relief must be made “within a reasonable time but in
no instance exceeding six months after the judgment, dismissal, order, or
proceeding was taken.” (Id.) If discretionary relief is granted, the court may
in its discretion order the moving party to pay the costs, including attorney fees,
incurred in obtaining the default. (Rogalski v. Nabers Cadillac (1992)
11 Cal.App.4th 816, 823; Vanderkous v. Conley (2010) 188
Cal.App.4th 111, 118-119.) If the motion for discretionary relief is granted,
the court may order the offending attorney to pay monetary sanctions up to
$1,000 to opposing parties, or up to $1,000 to the State Bar Client Security
Fund, or “[g]rant other relief as is appropriate.” (CCP § 473(c)(1)(A), (B),
(C).)
 
A motion for relief under section 473(b) “shall be
accompanied by a copy of the answer or other pleading proposed to be filed
therein, otherwise the application shall not be granted. . .” (CCP § 473(b).)
However, this requirement is
not jurisdictional; substantial compliance may suffice. (Carmel, Ltd. v. Tavoussi (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 393, 403
[finding substantial compliance where counsel offered proposed answer at
motion hearing rather than serving it with moving
papers].) 
 
CCP section 473.5(a) permits
the court to set aside a default or default judgment “[w]hen service of a
summons has not resulted in actual notice to a party in time to defend the
action and a default or default judgment has been entered against him.”¿ “The
notice of motion shall be served and filed within a reasonable time, but in no
event exceeding the earlier of:¿ (i) two years after entry of a default
judgment against him or her; or (ii) 180 days after service on him or her of a
written notice that the default or default judgment has been entered .”¿ (Id.)
The phrase “actual notice” means “genuine knowledge of the party litigant” and
does not include constructive or imputed notice to the client.¿ (Tunis v.
Barrow (1986) 184 Cal. App. 3d 1069, 1077.) A defendant also must show that
his “lack of actual notice in time to defend the action was not caused by his
inexcusable neglect or avoidance of service.”¿ (Id. at
1077-1078.) Further, the court is “not required to accept [a] self-serving
evidence contradicting the process server's declaration.” (Rodriguez v. Nam
Min Cho (2015) 236 Cal.App.4th 742, 751.)¿ 
 
To qualify for equitable relief based on extrinsic
mistake, which exists when circumstances extrinsic to the litigation have
unfairly cost a party a hearing on the merits, the defendant must demonstrate:
(1) “a meritorious case”; (2) “a satisfactory excuse for not presenting a
defense to the original action”; and (3) “diligence in seeking to set aside the
default once the fraud [or mistake] had been discovered.” (Mechling v.
Asbestos Defendants (2018) 29 Cal.App.5th 1241, 1245-1246 (citing In re
Marriage of Stevenot (1984) 154 Cal.App.3d 1051, 1071).)¿¿ 
 
Analysis
 
Defendant Orcones Trucking Inc.
moves to set aside default against it entered on or about September 21, 2023,
and requests leave to file an answer.
 
            Defendant’s
motion is untimely on all grounds. (CCP §§473(b), 473.5.) The record demonstrates
that Defendant received actual notice of this lawsuit in time to defend. Plaintiffs
filed this suit on June 27, 2023. Default was entered against Defendants on
August 31, 2023. Default judgment was entered against Defendant on September
21, 2023. The motion was filed more than a year after from both events, on
October 22, 2024. This is outside the jurisdictional six month period for
section 473 relief. 
 
Furthermore, Defendant had actual knowledge
of this suit in time to defend the suit. Defendant explains that it made a
mistake in believing that, because it timely notified its insurance broker, the
broker was going to handle all issues including appointment of counsel. (Wang
Decl., ¶¶ 5-6.) The principal of Defendant admits to being sub-served on July
12, 2023, and passing along the documents to his insurance (Gacia Decl., ¶ 5.) Thus,
section 473.5 relief is also unavailable. 
 
Defendant also did not move within
a reasonable amount of time after acquiring knowledge of the default. Counsel
admits that on April 11, 2024, they were assigned to this case by Defendant’s
insurer. (Wang Decl., ¶ 4.) Despite counsel’s claim to be reasonably
investigating the service at this juncture, Defendant waited another six months
to file the instant motion.
 
Accordingly, the motion is DENIED.
