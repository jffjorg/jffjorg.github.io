And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to set aside the default and file an answer. The motion is untimely and the defendant received actual notice of the lawsuit in time to defend. The defendant's mistake was in believing that its insurance broker would handle all issues, including the appointment of counsel. The defendant failed to take timely action to address the default and did not move to set aside the default within a reasonable amount of time after acquiring knowledge of the default. As a result, the motion is denied.
