And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted defendant Sixt Rent A Car LLC's motion to continue the trial and related dates to allow the parties to complete documenting their settlement. The parties settled the action in March 2024, but plaintiff's counsel has not yet returned the signed release document, delaying dismissal. Since the action is settled, it would be a waste of time and resources to move forward with trial on the current trial date. The court sets a trial setting conference for January 30, 2025, and continues all trial-related dates and deadlines to correspond with the new trial date.
