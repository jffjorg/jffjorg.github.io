Plaintiffs, Claudia and Josue

2.     Motions
for Summary Judgment
a.     Law Governing Standard of Care
The standard of care against which
the acts of health care providers are to be measured is a matter within the
knowledge of experts.  Elcome v. Chin
(2003) 110 Cal.App.4th 310, 317.  Unless
the conduct required by the particular circumstances is within the common
knowledge of the layman, the standard of care in a malpractice action can only
be proved by an expert’s testimony.  Id.  If the “common knowledge” exception does not
apply to a medical malpractice action, expert evidence is conclusive and cannot
be disregarded.  Id.  
 
A medical practitioner is not
necessarily negligent just because he chooses one medically acceptable method
of treatment or diagnosis and it turns out that another medically accepted
method would have been a better choice. 
CACI 506.  Likewise, a medical
practitioner is not necessarily negligent just because his efforts are
unsuccessful or he makes an error that was reasonable under the circumstances.  CACI 505.
 
Whether the standard of care in the
community has been breached presents the basic issue in a malpractice action
and can only be proved by opinion testimony unless the medical question is
within the common knowledge of laypersons. 
See Jambazian v. Borden (1994) 25 Cal.App4th 836, 844. “‘When a
defendant moves for summary judgment and supports his motion with expert
declarations that his conduct fell within the community standard of care, he is
entitled to summary judgment unless the plaintiff comes forward with
conflicting expert evidence.’“ (Munro v. Regents of University of California
(1989) 215 Cal.App.3d 977, 984-985.)
 
b.     Law Governing Causation
In order to establish that
defendant's negligence was a “substantial factor” in causing injury or death,
the plaintiff must prove the negligence was of itself sufficient to bring about
that harm.  “The law is well settled that
in a personal injury action causation must be proven within a reasonable
medical probability based upon competent expert testimony.  Mere possibility alone is insufficient to
establish a prima facie case. 
[Citations.]  That there is a
distinction between a reasonable medical ‘probability’ and a medical
'possibility' needs little discussion. 
There can be many possible ‘causes,’ indeed, an infinite number of
circumstances which can produce an injury or disease. A possible cause only
becomes ‘probable’ when, in the absence of other reasonable causal
explanations, it becomes more likely than not that the injury was a result of
its action.  This is the outer limit of
inference upon which an issue may be submitted to the jury.” Bromme v. Pavitt
(1992) 5 Cal.App.4th 1487, 1498; citing Jones v. Ortho Pharmaceutical Corp.
(1985) 163 Cal.App.3d 396, 402 403.
 
c.     Moving Burden
Defendants support their motion
with the expert declaration of Dr. Eric Ontiveros, M.D.  Dr. Ontiveros sets forth his expert
qualifications, states which documents he reviewed to form his expert opinion,
details the moving defendants’ care and treatment of Plaintiffs, and ultimately
concludes Defendants complied with the standard of care at all times and
nothing they did caused or contributed to Plaintiffs’ injuries.  
 
d.     Shifted Burden
Because Defendants met their moving
burden to show they are entitled to judgment as a matter of law, the burden
shifts to Plaintiffs to raise a triable issue of material fact.  They failed to file timely opposition to the motion,
and therefore necessarily failed to meet their shifted burden.  The motion is unopposed and granted.  
 
Moving Defendants are ordered to
give notice.
