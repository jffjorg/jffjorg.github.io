 Case Number:  23LBCV02507    Hearing Date:   March 26, 2024    Dept:  S27 Plaintiff’s attorneys seek to be
relieved as counsel, contending there has been an irrevocable breakdown in the
attorney-client relationship such that further representation is not
possible.  Counsel declares he served Plaintiff
with the moving papers at a confirmed address. 
Counsel filed proof of service of the moving papers on Defendants.  Counsel failed, however, to file proof of
service of the moving papers on Plaintiff. 
Absent proof of service, the Court cannot confirm whether Plaintiff was
timely served.  The motion is therefore
denied without prejudice.  
 
The Court notes that there is an
OSC re: proof of service of the summons and complaint on calendar concurrently
with the hearing on this motion.  The
Court asks Counsel to make arrangements to appear remotely at the OSC and hearing
on the motion.
