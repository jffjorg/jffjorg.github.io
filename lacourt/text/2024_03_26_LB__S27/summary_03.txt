And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the motion for attorneys' fees filed by the defendants in the amount of $44,178.80. The defendants are entitled to recover their fees spent defending the action because the plaintiff's complaint sought to enforce the governing documents (CC&Rs) in a wholly improper manner. The plaintiff's complaint alleges various violations of the CC&Rs and seeks an injunction providing for various forms of relief. The defendants moved for an award of attorneys' fees under the CC&Rs and the Davis-Stirling Common Act. The Judge finds that the defendants met their threshold burden to show they are entitled to recover their fees and awards the full amount of fees sought. The Court will interlineate the judgment to reflect the award of fees.
