And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses a motion by the plaintiff's attorney to be relieved as counsel due to an alleged breakdown in the attorney-client relationship. The attorney claims to have served the plaintiff with the moving papers at a confirmed address, and filed proof of service on the defendants. However, the attorney failed to file proof of service on the plaintiff, making it impossible for the court to confirm whether the plaintiff was timely served. As a result, the motion is denied without prejudice. The judge also notes that there is an upcoming OSC re: proof of service of the summons and complaint, and asks the attorney to appear remotely at the OSC and hearing on the motion.
