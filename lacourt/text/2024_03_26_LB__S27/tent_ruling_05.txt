b.     Analysis
i.             
Does
a presumption of fairness exist?  
Was the settlement reached through arm's-length bargaining?  Yes. The parties participated in a full-day
mediation with Mark LeHocky, Esq., and ultimately agreed to settle at the
conclusion of the session on 12/27/23.  Young
Declaration, ¶3. 
Were investigation and discovery sufficient to allow counsel and the
court to act intelligently?  Yes. Young provides
a detailed description of all discovery conducted at ¶12 of his declaration in
support of the motion.   
Is counsel experienced in similar litigation?  Yes.  Attorney
Mahoney details the firm’s experience with PAGA litigation at ¶3.
What percentage of the class has objected?  n/a
 
            CONCLUSION:  The settlement is entitled to a presumption
of fairness.
 
b.         Is the settlement fair,
adequate, and reasonable?
Strength of Plaintiffs' case. 
"The most important factor is the strength of the case for
plaintiffs on the merits, balanced against the amount offered in
settlement."  (Kullar v. Foot Locker
Retail, Inc. (2008) 168 Cal.App.4th 116, 130.) Plaintiff's Counsel estimated
damages in this action and concluded Defendant’s exposure is $363,750; however,
Counsel also notes that this includes substantial penalties, and employers
often take the position that such penalties are not available under the
circumstances.  See Young Declaration,
¶¶19-20.  
Risk, expense, complexity and likely duration of further
litigation.  Given the nature of the
claim, the case is likely to be expensive and lengthy to try.  Procedural hurdles (e.g., motion practice and
appeals) are also likely to prolong the litigation as well as any recovery by
the aggrieved employees.
3.         Risk of maintaining
class action status through trial.  n/a
4.         Amount offered in
settlement. The Settlement Amount of $93,500 represents only a small fraction
of the potential exposure, but in light of the potential for a finding in
Defendant’s favor in connection with the penalty issues, the settlement is in
the "ballpark" of reasonableness. After administrator, attorney, and
enhancement payments are made, the remaining settlement will be in the amount
of $42,156.03 will remain.  If 25% of the
remaining settlement ($10,536.26) will be available for distribution to all
aggrieved employees, then payments to the 246 Aggrieved Employees will average
$42.83.   
5.         Extent of discovery
completed and stage of the proceedings. 
As indicated above, at the time of the settlement, Plaintiff's Counsel
had conducted sufficient discovery.
6.         Experience and views of
counsel.  The settlement was negotiated
and endorsed by Plaintiff's Counsel who, as indicated above, is experienced in
PAGA litigation.
 
            CONCLUSION:  The settlement can be deemed "fair,
adequate, and reasonable." 
 
c.         Scope of the release 
Upon the approval by the Court of this Settlement, each PAGA Member (including
Plaintiff), shall fully release and forever discharge Defendant, and its
present and former parent companies, subsidiaries, divisions, related or
affiliated companies and joint ventures, shareholders, officers, directors,
employees, agents, attorneys, insurers, reinsurers, successors and assigns, and
any individual or entity which could be jointly liable with Defendant
("Releasees") from the PAGA Released Claims, which include all claims
known or unknown under PAGA.  ¶1.27 of settlement
agreement.  The “PAGA Released Claims”
are defined as all claims under PAGA that area pled in Plaintiff’s complaint or
that could have been pled under PAGA based on the factual allegations in the
complaint and that arose during the covered period.  ¶5 of settlement agreement.
Plaintiff will also provide a general release and CC §1542 waiver as to
Defendant, as well as a release of any discrimination-based claims. ¶5.1.1 of
settlement agreement.
 
 d.        Is the notice proper?
PAGA has no notice requirements for unnamed class members, nor may such
employees opt out of a PAGA actions.  See
Hernandez v. DMSI Staffing, LLC. (N.D. Cal. 2015) 79 F.Supp.3d 1054, 1063,
aff'd sub nom. Hernandez v. DMSI Staffing, LLC (9th Cir. 2017) 677 Fed. Appx.
359.  See also Moniz v. Adecco USA, Inc.
(2021) 72 Cal.App.5th 56.  
Within 15 calendar days after entry of judgment on this settlement,
Defendant will compile a list of aggrieved employees and provide it to the
Claims Administrator. ¶4.2 of settlement agreement.  Defendant must fully fund the settlement
within 180 days of entry of judgment on this settlement.  ¶4.3.
Within 10 calendar days of receipt of the final settlement check from
Defendant, the Claim Administrator shall send notice and check to each PAGA
member. ¶4.4.
 
e.         Attorney fees and costs
An aggrieved employee who prevails in a PAGA action may recover
reasonable attorney's fees and costs.  Labor
Code §2699(g)(1).  Whether a plaintiff
established entitlement to an award of fees under PAGA is a question best
decided by the trial court. San Diego Municipal Employees Association v. City
of San Diego (2016) 244 Cal.App.4th 906.
Counsel requests $31,166.67 in litigation fees (33% to the gross
settlement).  Per Counsel’s declaration,
this amount is fair and reasonable.  
Counsel requests reimbursement for costs incurred during the litigation
in the sum of $9,688.30, which is also fair and reasonable.  
 
The Court is inclined to approve fees in the amount of $31,166.67 and
costs in the amount of $9,688.30.
 
f.          Representative
Enhancement Award
The Settlement Agreement provides for $5,000.00 for a representative
payment. Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s attorney both declare this incentive is
based on Plaintiff’s willing participation in every stage of the
litigation.  The Court also notes that
Plaintiff has agreed to a broad waiver of all future claims.  The Court finds the incentive award reasonable.   
 
g.         Claims Administration
Costs
The Settlement Agreement provides for $5500.00 in Administration Costs
to Phoenix.  This is fair and reasonable
and in line with the normal amount sought by administrators in these cases.
 
 h.        Conclusion
The Court finds the settlement and all requested fees and costs to be
reasonable, and the Court will grant the motion to approve the settlement.
 
Plaintiff is ordered to give
notice.
