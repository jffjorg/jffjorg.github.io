And here is the summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling is in favor of approving the settlement agreement between Aireanna M. Chapman, as a designated Private Attorney General, and Marlora Investments LLC. The settlement affects 246 aggrieved employees and covers the employment period between October 4, 2022, and January 26, 2024. The settlement requires Defendant to pay $93,500, which will be distributed as follows: $31,166.67 in attorneys' fees, $9,688.30 in litigation expenses, $5,500 in administration expenses, and $5,000 in a representative incentive payment to Plaintiff.

The judge concludes that the settlement is entitled to a presumption of fairness, as the parties participated in a full-day mediation and agreed to settle at the conclusion of the session. The judge also finds that the settlement is fair, adequate, and reasonable, considering the strength of Plaintiff's case, the risk and expense of further litigation, and the amount offered in settlement.

The judge is inclined to approve fees in the amount of $31,166.67 and costs in the amount of $9,688.30. The judge also finds the representative enhancement award of $5,000 reasonable, as it is based on Plaintiff's willing participation in every stage of the litigation.

The judge orders that the settlement agreement be approved and that Plaintiff provide notice to the aggrieved employees.
