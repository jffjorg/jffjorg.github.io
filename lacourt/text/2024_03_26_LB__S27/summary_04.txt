And here is a summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses a demurrer filed by the defendants, Allyn Emery and Loma Law Group, APC, against the plaintiff, Cary Atwood, and Lyran Consulting, Inc. The defendants challenged the original complaint and the First Amended Complaint, which alleged breach of fiduciary duty, conversion, unjust enrichment, breach of contract, equitable estoppel, quantum meruit, and accounting. The judge sustained the demurrer to the first cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty, finding that the parties did not establish a joint venture relationship. The judge also sustained the demurrer to the conversion cause of action, finding that the claim was barred by the statute of limitations. The judge overruled the demurrer to the quantum meruit cause of action, finding that the claim was not barred by the statute of limitations. The judge denied the motion to require the plaintiff to post a bond, finding that the defendants had not shown a reasonable probability of success on the merits. The judge ordered the plaintiff to file a Second Amended Complaint within 20 days and the defendants to file a responsive pleading within the statutory time thereafter.
