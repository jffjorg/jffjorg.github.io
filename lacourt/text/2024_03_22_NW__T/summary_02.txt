And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling sustaining the demurrer to the plaintiff's first amended complaint without leave to amend. The plaintiff, Danielle Zamorano, had brought a lawsuit against Dr. Kiarash Rowhanian and Refresh Med Spa L.A. alleging violations of the Consumer Legal Remedies Act, the Unfair Competition Law, and negligent misrepresentation. The defendants demurred to the complaint, arguing that the plaintiff failed to allege sufficient facts to plead reliance and damages. The judge agreed, finding that the plaintiff did not adequately allege how she relied on the defendants' alleged representations and that her damages were insufficiently pleaded. The plaintiff's request for leave to amend was denied because she failed to present new facts to cure the defects in the complaint. The case is scheduled for a hearing on March 22, 2024, where the judge will consider the defendants' proposed judgment of dismissal.
