  Case Number:  23VECV00843    Hearing Date:   March 22, 2024    Dept:  T 23VECV00843
Grigoryan v Jaguar
Tentative
ruling on Ex Parte Application: Because of court congestion, the court is unwilling to special set the
motion to compel.  Instead, because of
the ongoing discovery disputes, the court would be inclined to continue the
trial for 60 days and discovery to remain open. 
The court would be willing then to move the hearing on the 5/15 motion
to compel to 5/1.  This will be discussed
at the hearing on 3/22.
