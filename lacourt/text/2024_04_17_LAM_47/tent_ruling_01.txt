CASE:                         Martin Melendez-Murillo et al. v. AKG
Trading (USA), Inc., et al.
 
CASE NO.:                 23STCV08596            
 
MOTION
TO QUASH SERVICE OF SUMMONS AND COMPLAINT

 
MOVING PARTY:               Defendant Guidoni USA, Inc.
 
RESPONDING PARTY(S): Plaintiffs Martin
Melendez-Murillo and Rufina Barajas
 
STATEMENT
OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
            This is a toxic tort action, filed on April 18, 2023, alleging that
Plaintiff Melendez-Murillo developed silicosis and consequential injuries by
breathing in dust from Defendants’ stone products generated by his work as a
fabricator and polisher of stone countertops.
 
Defendant Guidoni USA, Inc. moves
to quash service of the summons and complaint for lack of personal
jurisdiction. 
 
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Defendant Guidoni USA, Inc. moves
to quash service of the summons and complaint for lack of personal
jurisdiction. Defendant filed and served an Entry of Appearance in this case on
November 29, 2023. (Entry of Appearance filed November 29, 2023.) “By generally
appearing, a defendant relinquishes all objections based on lack of personal
jurisdiction or defective process or service of process.” (In re Marriage of
Obrecht (2016) 245 Cal.App.4th 1, 8.) Defendant has therefore waived the
right to object for lack of personal jurisdiction.
 
Accordingly, Defendant Guidoni USA, Inc.’s
Motion to Quash Service of the Summons and Complaint is DENIED.
 
            Defendant
is ordered to file a demurrer, answer, or other responsive pleading per code. 
 
            Moving
Party to give notice.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.

should be noted that if you submit on a tentative ruling the court will still
conduct a hearing if any party appears. By submitting on the tentative you
have, in essence, waived your right to be present at the hearing, and you
should be aware that the court may not adopt the tentative, and may issue an
order which modifies the tentative ruling in whole or in part.
