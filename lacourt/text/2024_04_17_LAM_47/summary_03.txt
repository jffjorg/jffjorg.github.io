And here is a summary in English text:

Judge Theresa M. Traber issued a tentative ruling on April 17, 2024, in the case Le Cui v. HicksLander LLC, et al. Plaintiff Lei Cui filed a complaint alleging breach of contract and misrepresentation against Defendants Jerry Mao, Jack Chao, and Michael Perry. The Defendants filed demurrers, seeking to dismiss the claims.

The Court found that Defendant Jerry Mao's demurrer to the second cause of action for intentional misrepresentation is sustained with leave to amend. The Court also sustained with leave to amend the demurrer to the third cause of action for negligent misrepresentation.

As for the fourth cause of action for breach of guaranty contract, the Court sustained the demurrer with leave to amend. The Court found that the parties' agreement included a usurious interest rate and that Plaintiff has not shown how the Complaint might be amended to cure the defect.

The Court granted leave to amend to Plaintiff on the second and third causes of action. However, the Court did not grant leave to amend on the fourth cause of action.

Judge Traber also stricken Defendant Michael Perry's demurrer as improper since he was in default.

The Court's tentative ruling will be considered at the hearing on April 17, 2024.
