And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the Motion to Quash Service of Summons filed by Defendant RJ Bucaria, arguing that Bucaria has sufficient minimum contacts with California and is an agent and alter ego of Upsense Media Capital Pty, Ltd. The court finds that Bucaria has purposefully availed himself to the benefits of California as it relates to the claim at issue and has systematic, continuous contacts with California. The court also finds that Bucaria's general appearances in California and his solicitation of investors for the movie in California demonstrate his intent to do business in California. Additionally, the court notes that Bucaria's misappropriation and transfer of Plaintiff's investment to an account in Silicon Valley, CA, and his Prolific Media Holdings partners that are California-based, further demonstrate his contacts with California.

The court concludes that Bucaria is equitably estopped from challenging the Court's jurisdiction by appearing in the Court-ordered JAMS Arbitrations, and that holding that there is no alter ego and granting the Motion to Quash Service of Summons would leave Plaintiff "holding an empty bag". The court also notes that it would be inequitable for Bucaria to be shielded by Upsense's corporate form.
