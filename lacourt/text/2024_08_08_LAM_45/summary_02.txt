Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the Motion to Compel Arbitration and stay or dismiss proceedings, finding that the Arbitration Agreements signed by Sonya Torosyan and Meri Arutyunyan are valid and enforceable. The judge rejects the Plaintiffs' arguments that the Agreements are invalid due to lack of authentication, procedural unconscionability, and substantive unconscionability. The judge finds that the Agreements were signed electronically, and the security process used to authenticate the signatures is sufficient. The judge also finds that the Agreements are not procedurally unconscionable, as there is no evidence that the Plaintiffs were coerced into signing the Agreements. Finally, the judge finds that the Agreements are not substantively unconscionable, as they do not impose harsh or oppressive terms on the Plaintiffs.
