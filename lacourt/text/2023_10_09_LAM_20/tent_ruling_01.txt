BACKGROUND
            This is a commercial fraud case brought
by Plaintiffs Tomoaki Nishimura and Kai Ramen Dining, Inc., against their
former business partners, Defendants Tatsunori Yanagi, Tomoyoshi, Inc., and Y’s
OT Corporation. 
            Plaintiffs allege they formed two
business partnerships with Defendants in 2020. Plaintiffs provided capital and
licensed their “Kai Ramen” trademarks and trade secrets for use in restaurants
operated by Defendants. Defendants promised a profit share in return. Defendants
subsequently breached the partnership agreements, misappropriated the
partnership’s assets, and stopped paying profit shares to Plaintiffs, but
continued to operate restaurants using Plaintiffs’ trademarks and trade
secrets.
The operative Complaint alleges causes of
action for (1) unfair business practices, (2) breach of contract, (3) fraud,
(4) breach of fiduciary duty, (5) misappropriation of trade secrets, (6) an
accounting, and (7) conversion.
            Defendant Y’s OT Corporation (hereafter
“Defendant”, singular) cross-complained against Tomoaki Nishimura (hereafter
“Plaintiff”, singular) individually for (1) breach of contract and (2) breach
of fiduciary duty. Defendant claims Plaintiff did not provide their venture
with the capital or other support he promised in the parties’ partnership
agreement and that he looted and misappropriated income and assets of their
business.
            On December 23, 2022, Defendant
served its second set of Form Interrogatories on Plaintiff, concurrently with
its first set of Requests for Admission. (Cohen Decl. i/s/o Form
Interrogatories Motion (Cohen Decl. A), ¶ 2 and Ex. B.) 
On the same date, Defendant served its
first set of Special Interrogatories on Plaintiff. (Cohen Decl. i/s/o Special
Interrogatories Motion (Cohen Decl. B), ¶ 2.)
            On April 4, 2023, Plaintiff
responded to Defendant’s Requests for Admission. (Cohen Decl., A, ¶ 3 and Ex.
C.) 
On May 19, 2023, Plaintiff responded to
Defendant’s Form Interrogatories (Set Two) and Special Interrogatories (Set
One). (Cohen Decl. A, ¶ 3 and Ex. D; Cohen Decl. B, ¶ 4 and Ex. C.)
            On May 31, 2023, Defendant’s counsel
sent Plaintiff’s counsel correspondence inviting him to meet and confer over
purported deficiencies in Plaintiff’s responses. (Cohen Decls., ¶ 4 and Exs. D,
E.) He received no response. (Ibid.)
            On July 3, 2023, Defendant filed the
instant motions.
            Plaintiff filed no opposition, and
Defendant no reply.
            
DISCUSSION
Applicable
Law
CCP §2030.300(a) authorizes a party propounding interrogatories to move
for an order compelling a further response if that party deems that “[a]n
answer to a particular interrogatory is evasive or incomplete,” “[a]n exercise of the option to produce documents under Section
2030.230 is unwarranted or the required specification of those documents is
inadequate,” or “[a]n objection to an interrogatory is without merit or
too general.”
            Further undesignated statutory
references are to the Code of Civil Procedure.
 
Analysis
(1)   Form
Interrogatories (Set Two)
At issue here is
solely Form Interrogatory No. 17.1, which requests that Plaintiff (1)
indicate whether each of his responses to Defendant’s Requests for Admission is
qualified or unqualified, and (2) for any denial or qualified admission, state
various relevant facts.
Plaintiff
responded to all of Defendant’s requests for admission with denials. But to
Interrogatory No. 17.1, he provided a single response regarding “Request for
Admission No. 1 through 23”, collectively. The response is two pages long and lays
out a long, rambling factual account of Defendant’s case not specific to any
particular admission.
A
discovery response “must be as complete and straightforward as the
information reasonably available to the responding party permits.” (§ 2030.220,
subd. (a), italics added.) The Court agrees with Defendant that Plaintiff’s
response is “deliberately uninformative and violative of the discovery
process.” (S.S., 5:2.) Plaintiff has not filed an opposition arguing it had any
justification for responding in this manner.
The
motion is GRANTED as to Form Interrogatory No. 17.1.
 
(2)   Special
Interrogatories (Set One)
At
issue here are Nos. 7, 12, 16-35, 37-43, and 45-47. 
No. 7
            This interrogatory asks Plaintiff to identify “each
recipe, menu item, pricing, vendor, product, and marketing strategy that [he]
claim[ed] as a trade secret” in his Complaint.
            Plaintiff responded by citing to section 2030.230,
arguing that a response would require an abstract or compilation of documents
that would pose an equal burden on the responding or the propounding party.
Plaintiff then argued “[the] information is equally available to the
propounding party as they ... had/have access to the same information ... .”
            Plaintiff’s response is deficient. It is not complete or
straightforward (§ 2030.220(a)). It does not actually respond to the question
posed. And Plaintiff has not filed an opposition explaining why a compilation
of documents would be required.. Furthermore, even if section 2030.230 applied
– which the Court does not believe it does – section 2030.230 requires the
plaintiff to specify underlying documents in detail and provide the propounding
party with an opportunity to examine them. 
Finally,
Defendant’s counsel attests that Plaintiff served discovery responses late,
with no extension granted or other justification. (Cohen Decls., ¶¶ 3-4.) Plaintiff’s
objections – including specifically his rights under section 2030.230 – were
waived when he failed to serve timely responses in the first place. (§
2030.290, subd. (a).) The court may only relieve a party from waiver upon
motion. (Ibid.)
            Plaintiff shall provide a complete and straightforward
response, without objections, that complies with Code of Civil Procedure
section 2030.220.)
            The motion is GRANTED as to Special Interrogatory No. 7.
 
No. 12
            This interrogatory seeks identification of “every person
to whom any of the Plaintiffs herein have ever licensed or permitted the use of
any Kai Ramen-related trade secret.”
            Defendant responded solely with objections.
As
discussed above, Plaintiff’s objections were waived when he failed to serve
timely initial responses. (§ 2030.290, subd. (a).)
            Plaintiff shall provide a complete and straightforward
response, without objections, that complies with Code of Civil Procedure
section 2030.220.)
            The
motion is GRANTED as to Special Interrogatory No. 12.
 
No. 17
            This
interrogatory asks Plaintiff to identify “all equipment that was purchased for
partnership use at [its] Downtown location”, as alleged in the Complaint.
            Plaintiff
responded by citing to section 2030.230. His response is deficient for all the
same reasons as his response to No. 7, above.
            Plaintiff
shall provide a complete and straightforward response, without objections, that
complies with Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.220.)
            The motion is
GRANTED as to Special Interrogatory No. 17.
 
            No. 18
            This
interrogatory asks Plaintiff to identify “all persons and employees who
performed services for the partnership and/or Tomoyoshi at the Downtown
location.” 
Plaintiff responded:
“Erica, Arisa, Valente, and other employees whose names’ [sic]
responding party does not recall at this time. Discovery is continuing.” (S.S. 5:5-6.)
Plaintiff’s response
does not satisfy section 2030.220, which requires him to answer each
interrogatory “to the extent possible” and “make a reasonable and good faith
effort to obtain the information by inquiry to other natural persons or
organizations ... .” (§ 2030.220, subds. (b)-(c).) “If only partial answers [to
an interrogatory] can be supplied, the answers should reveal all information
then available to the party. If a person cannot furnish details, he should set
forth the efforts made to secure the information. He cannot plead ignorance to
information which can be obtained from sources under his control.” (Deyo v.
Kilbourne (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 771, 782.)
            Plaintiff
has provided no explanation, in his responses or in opposition papers, why he
would only be able to recall three first names of all persons whom he employed
or who performed services for him. Nor does he set forth efforts he made to
uncover names that he simply “cannot recall at this time.” His response is
patently insufficient.
            Plaintiff
shall provide a complete and straightforward response, without objections, that
complies with Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.220.)
            The motion is
GRANTED as to Special Interrogatory No. 18.
 
            No. 19
This interrogatory asks
Plaintiff to “[s]tate the amount and purpose of all expenses that [he] and/or
Kai Ramen Dining, Inc. paid with respect to the operations of the Downtown
location ... .”
Plaintiff responded by
citing to section 2030.230. His response is deficient for all the same reasons
as his response to No. 7, above.
Plaintiff
shall provide a complete and straightforward response, without objections, that
complies with Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.220.)
The motion is GRANTED as
to Special Interrogatory No. 19.

service, equipment, or other item of value [he] and or Kai Ramen Dining, Inc.

Plaintiff to “[s]tate the date(s), amount(s), payor(s), and payee(s) of all
profit shares what were paid to or on behalf of the plaintiffs  ... .”
Plaintiff responded by
citing to section 2030.230. His response is deficient for all the same reasons
as his response to No. 7, above.
Plaintiff
shall provide a complete and straightforward response, without objections, that
complies with Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.220.)
The motion is GRANTED as
to Special Interrogatory No. 21.
 
No. 22
            This
interrogatory asks Plaintiff to “[s]tate all facts supportive of [his]
contention that Defendants had taken all of the cash on the premises, emptied
the bank accounts, and refused to pay vendors at the Downtown location, as
alleged at paragraph 5 of [his] Complaint.”
            In
response, Plaintiff copied and pasted paragraph 5 of the Complaint.
Plaintiff’s response – if it qualifies as a
response – does not satisfy section 2030.220, which requires “complete and
straightforward responses” to each interrogatory “to the extent possible” and to
“make a reasonable and good faith effort to obtain the information by inquiry
to other natural persons or organizations ... .” (§ 2030.220.) Even “[i]f only
partial answers [to an interrogatory] can be supplied, the answers should
reveal all information then available to the party. If a person cannot furnish
details, he should set forth the efforts made to secure the information. He
cannot plead ignorance to information which can be obtained from sources under
his control.” (Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 771, 782.)
            This
response is patently insufficient.
            Plaintiff
shall provide a complete and straightforward response, without objections, that
complies with Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.220.)
            The motion is
GRANTED as to Special Interrogatory No. 22.
 
No. 23
This interrogatory asks
Plaintiff to “[s]tate all facts supportive of [his] contention that ‘Defendants
and each of them had stolen partnership funds for themselves’ as alleged at
paragraph 6 of [his] complaint.”
Defendant responded: “The
fact is Defendants fired all employees and emptied all of the funds remaining
in the Tomoyoshi bank account.” (S.S. 8:9-10.)
This response is
patently insufficient for the same reasons discussed regarding Interrogatory
No. 22, above.
            Plaintiff
shall provide a complete and straightforward response, without objections, that
complies with Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.220.)
            The
motion is GRANTED as to Special Interrogatory No. 23.

all writings supportive of YOUR contention that Defendants had taken all of the
cash on the premises, emptied the bank accounts, and refused to pay vendors at

No. 22, discussed above.

responses” to each interrogatory “to the extent possible” and to “make a
reasonable and good faith effort to obtain the information by inquiry to other
natural persons or organizations ... .” (§ 2030.220.) A complete,
straightforward response also furnishes relevant details. (See Deyo v.

Kilbourne (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 771, 782.)

not refer to documents at all, but to entities. To the extent it means to refer
to categories of documents, those categories are so general as to be meaningless.
The response is insufficient.

The motion is GRANTED as to Special
Interrogatory No. 46.
 
No. 47
This interrogatory
asks Plaintiff to “[i]dentify the owner(s) of each personal property item
listed in paragraph 32 of [his] complaint.”
In response, Plaintiff
copied and pasted paragraph 32 of the Complaint.
            Plaintiff’s
response is patently insufficient for all the same reasons as his response to
Interrogatory No. 22, discussed above.
            Plaintiff
shall provide a complete and straightforward response, without objections, that
complies with Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.220.)
            The motion is
GRANTED as to Special Interrogatory No. 47.
 
(3)   Monetary Sanctions
Section
2030.300(d) mandates the imposition of sanctions “against any party,
person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel
further response . . . unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction
acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the
imposition of the sanction unjust.”
            “[T]he
burden is on the moving party to show (by
declarations) the facts essential to an award of sanctions: e.g., the opposing
party's failure to make discovery, reasonable efforts to resolve the matter
informally, etc. The burden then shifts to the party against whom sanctions are
being sought to establish some excuse or justification for the conduct in
question.”  (Weil &
Brown, Cal. Practice Guide:  Civ. Pro.
Before Trial (The Rutter Group June 2021 Update) ¶
8:2015.)
            Defendant has made an unrebutted showing that Plaintiff
failed to respond to discovery and failed to respond to reasonable efforts to
resolve the matter informally. Plaintiff’s responses are also patently
insufficient and abusive of the discovery process. Defendant shifted the burden
to Plaintiff to avoid sanctions, and Plaintiff filed no opposition. Defendant
is entitled to sanctions.
            Defendant requests monetary sanctions of $2,506.15 in
connection with its Form Interrogatories motion and $4,243.65 in connection
with its Special Interrogatories motion. This award is based on a reasonable
$695 hourly rate for their attorney, Robert W. Cohen, who has been licensed and
practicing law for more than thirty years. Mr. Cohen attests to two and four
hours spent on each motion, respectively, which is reasonable. He also attests
to $73.65 in filing fees and related costs – also reasonable. Finally, he
estimates a total of 1.0 hours spent reviewing opposition papers, preparing a
reply, and appearing for the hearing. No opposition was filed, and remote
appearance is encouraged. The Court awards only 1.0 hours to appear for
hearing.
The
Court therefore awards sanctions in the reduced total amount of $4,938.65
[7 hours @ $695/hour + $73.65 x 2 for costs] in favor of Defendant and against
Plaintiff Tomoaki Nishimura.
 
CONCLUSION
The Motion to Compel Further Responses to
Form Interrogatories (Set Two) is GRANTED in its entirety.
The Motion to Compel Further Responses to
Special Interrogatories (Set One) is GRANTED in its entirety.
Defendant shall provide verified,
Code-compliant responses without objection to the above discovery within 20
days. 
In connection with the above motions, the
Court awards sanctions in the reduced total amount of $4,938.65 in favor of Defendant
and against Plaintiff Tomoaki Nishimura, payable within 20 days.
 
            If counsel do not submit on the
tentative, they are strongly encouraged to appear by LACourtConnect rather than
in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
