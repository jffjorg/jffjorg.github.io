MOVING PARTY: Cross-Defendant
YUKEE ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN CORP (“Yukee”)
 
RESPONDING PARTY: Defendants/Cross-Complainants
DVIR COHEN and YAFIT COHEN (collectively, the “Cohens”)
 
            The Court has considered the moving
and opposition papers.  No reply papers
were filed.  Under Code of Civil
Procedure (“CCP”) section 1005, subdivision (b), any reply papers were required
to have been filed and served at least five court days before the hearing.
 
BACKGROUND
             This action arose out of a dispute over the August
22, 2022 foreclosure sale of a real property located at 611 West Lemon Avenue,
Arcadia, CA 91007 (the “Property”).  On
October 7, 2002, Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant Bo Zhang (“Zhang”) brought a complaint
asserting claims for (1) fraudulent misrepresentation and (2) violation of
Business and Professions Code section 17200. 

 
On
November 8, 2022, upon application of Zhang, the Court issued a preliminary
injunction enjoining the eviction of Zhang from the Property and from transferring
title to the Property.
 
            On or about January 26, 2024, the
parties to this action signed a Settlement Agreement and Mutual Release
(“Settlement Agreement”).  (Declaration
of Eva Neumann (“Neumann Decl.”), ¶ 3; Exh. 1.) 
The signatories to the Settlement Agreement are 1) Zhang; 2) Eva Neumann
on behalf of Yukee; 3) Eva YU Neumann; 4) United Premier Development Liability
Company, LLC; 5) Jianying Wu; 6) Dvir Cohen; and 7) Yafit Cohen.  (Id., p. 6)
 
            On March 25, 2024, the Cohens filed a
motion to enforce the Settlement Agreement pursuant to CCP sections 664.6 and
533, in order to enforce the parties’ Settlement Agreement, specifically the
provision requiring Zhang to move to dissolve the November 8, 2022 preliminary
injunction.  The Court, in its June 21,
2024 Minute Order, granted the Cohens’ motion to enforce the Settlement
Agreement, stating that the “Court reserves jurisdiction under CCP §
664.6.”  (6/21/24 Minute Order.)
 
            On August 6, 2024, Yukee filed the
present Motion to Enforce Settlement (the “Motion”), specifically seeking to
order the Cohens to cooperate with opening escrow and proceeding with the sale
of the Property as set forth in the Settlement Agreement.  
 
            On October 11, 2024, the Cohens
filed an opposition.  No reply has been
filed.
 
REQUEST FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE 
            The Cohens request judicial notice of the Chapter 7 Voluntary Petition
for Individuals Filing Bankruptcy filed by Eva Yu Neumann on July 29, 2024, as
case number 2:24-bk-15995-WB in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Central District of
California (Exhibit 1).  
 
While the Court may take judicial notice of records
of any court of the United States (Evid. Code 452(d), the Court denies the
request as the matter is irrelevant in the Court’s ruling on this Motion.  The Court may decline to take judicial notice
of irrelevant matters.  (Town of
Atherton v. California High-Speed Rail Authority (2014) 228 Cal.App.4th
314, 341; People v. McKinzie (2012) 54 Cal.4th 1302, 1326, 144 Cal.Rptr.3d
427, 281 P.3d 412 [court will take judicial notice of only relevant
matters].)”)
 
DISCUSSION
Legal Standard
Code
Civ. Proc. (“CCP”) § 664.6 provides, in pertinent part, as follows: “If parties
to pending litigation stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties outside the
presence of the court or orally before the court, for settlement of the case,
or part thereof, the court, upon motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the
terms of the settlement.”  
 
In
hearing a CCP §664.6 motion, the trial court may receive evidence, determine
disputed facts, and enter terms of a settlement agreement as a judgment. 
(Bowers v. Raymond J. Lucia Companies, Inc. (2012) 206 Cal.App.4th
724, 732.)  The Court may also receive
oral testimony in addition to declarations.  (Kohn v. Jaymar-Ruby, Inc. (1994) 23
Cal.App.4th 1530, 1533.)  The
Court may interpret the terms and conditions to settlement (Fiore v. Alvord (1985)
182 Cal.App.3d 561, 566), but the Court may not create material terms of a
settlement, as opposed to deciding what terms the parties themselves have
previously agreed upon (Weddington Productions, Inc. v. Flick (1998) 60
Cal.App.4th 793, 810). 
 
Analysis
As
previously held by this Court, the parties in this case entered into a valid
and binding settlement, and there is no evidence for the Court to conclude
otherwise.  (6/21/2024 Minute Order.)  Below are the relevant terms of the
Settlement Agreement:

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(Neumann Decl.,
Exh. 1, p. 2.)
 
In
its Motion, Yukee asserts that according to the terms of the Settlement
Agreement, after the injunction was lifted, Yukee was to open escrow to
purchase the Property.  Yukee claims that
immediately after the June 21, 2024 hearing when the Court granted the Cohens’
motion to enforce the Settlement Agreement, Yukee attempted to open escrow as
specified in the
Settlement Agreement,
but the Cohens refused to cooperate.  Yukee
further avers that it stands ready to complete the transaction, including
having funds available to complete the purchase (Neumann Decl., ¶ 7, Exh. 4.),
but that the Cohens are falsely claiming that Yukee has failed to act in a timely
manner to carry out the terms of the settlement, and now refuse to cooperate
with Yukee in completing the transaction. 

 
            In opposition, the Cohens argue that
they have faithfully adhered to the terms and conditions of the Settlement
Agreement.  In contrast, they claim that it
is Yukee who has breached the agreement despite being made aware of the necessary
steps to purchase the Property.  The
Cohens assert that there are two specific conditions outlined in the Settlement
Agreement with which Yukee agreed to comply in order to proceed with the purchase
of the Property, but it failed to do so.
 
First, the Cohens point
to § III.A.2 of the Settlement Agreement to support its contention that as the
identified “BUYER” under the Settlement Agreement, Yukee has agreed to execute
a “residential purchase agreement prepared by Beverly Alvarez” within 5 days of
signing the agreement.  Second, pointing
to § III.A.3 of the Settlement Agreement, the Cohens contend that upon opening
escrow, Yukee was required to provide proof of funds coming directly from a
bank or lending institution in its name. 

 
The
Cohens present evidence that Yukee has not complied with the conditions it has
agreed to under the Settlement Agreement.  In the declaration of Beverly Alvarez
(“Alvarez”), Alvarez states that she received the signed Settlement Agreement
on January 26, 2024.  (Declaration of
Beverly Alvarez [“Alvarez Decl.”], ¶ 2.) 
As the agent of “Sellers” (identified in the Settlement Agreement as the
Cohens), she prepared a residential purchase agreement based on the terms and
conditions of the Settlement Agreement.  (Id.,
¶ 3.)  Subsequently, however, on February
5, 2024, she received three text messages from Eva Neumann (“Neumann”), the
first of which stated “We can’t use YUKEE architectural design as buyer…” then
another text message, “Please change buyer name, Antonio Gomez thank you” then
another text message instructing her to change the buyer to Ms. Neumann’s
nephew, “Daniel Junde Yu”.  (Id.,
¶ 8, Exh. 3.)  Based on these
developments, she requested further instructions from the Cohens’ attorney,
Andrew Jay Culick (“Culick”), who advised her that the settlement agreement
could only be amended by the written consent of all parties who had signed the
agreement.  (Id., ¶ 9.)  Culick further advised Alvarez to send Yukee
a Notice to Buyer to Perform.  (Id.;
Declaration of Andrew Jay Culick, ¶ 4.)  Alvarez
then prepared a Notice to Buyer to Perform, which was sent to Yukee.  (Alvarez Decl., ¶ 10; Exh. 4.)  
 
Nothing
occurred for three months regarding the sale of the Property until after the
June 21, 2024 hearing, when Culick requested Alvarez to draft and send another purchase
agreement to Yukee, which she did.  (Id.,
¶ 11-12.)  Subsequently, on July 16 and
17, 2024, Neumann sent emails to Culick attaching purchase agreements prepared
by Neumann.  (Culick Decl., ¶¶
9,11.)  Culick states that upon
examination, he noted that the terms and conditions in the purchase agreements
sent by Neumann conflicted with the terms and conditions of the parties’
settlement, among which is that Neumann added herself as a buyer of the
Property.  (Id., ¶¶ 10, 12.)  
 
The
Cohens also assert that the purported proof of funds submitted by Yukee in
support of its Motion (Neumann Decl., Exh. 4) was never provided to the Cohens
until the filing of the Motion.  The
Court notes that, as the Cohens point out, the certificate of deposit bearing
the name of the “Jung Family Trust Datd Jan 251988” and a Chase bank statement bearing
the name of the account holder “Jenny Nobuta” are not, in fact, proof of funds coming
directly from a bank, lending institution, or bank statement in Yukee’s name,
as required by the Settlement Agreement. 
(Id.)
 
In sum, the Cohens have sufficiently
demonstrated and presented evidence that Yukee has not complied with the
conditions required of it under the terms of the Settlement Agreement.  Yukee has thus waived the right to enforce
the Settlement Agreement by failing to perform its obligations under it.   (Civ.
Code, § 1439 [“Before any party to an obligation can require another party to
perform any act under it, he must fulfill all conditions precedent thereto
imposed upon himself…”]; Consol. World Invs., Inc. v. Lido Preferred Ltd.
(1992) 9 Cal. App. 4th 373, 380–81 [“performance by CWI of its duty to request
opening of escrow was a condition precedent to Lido's performance of its duty
to complete the sale.  Lido could not
perform its promise until after CWI performed its part…Thus, the uncontradicted
evidence established the failure of the conditions precedent to Lido’s duty to
sell.”].)
 
It is elementary that a
plaintiff suing for breach of contract must prove it has performed all
conditions on its part or that it was excused from performance.  (Reichert v. General Ins. Co. (1968) 68
Cal.2d 822, 830, 69 Cal.Rptr. 321, 442 P.2d 377.)  Similarly, where defendant’s duty to perform
under the contract is conditioned on the happening of some event, the plaintiff
must prove the event transpired.  (Cochran
v. Ellsworth (1954) 126 Cal.App.2d 429, 440–441, 272 P.2d 904.)
