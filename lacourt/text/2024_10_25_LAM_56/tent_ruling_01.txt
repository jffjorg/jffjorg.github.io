MOVING PARTY: Defendant/Cross-Complainant
ARIE KACHONE (“Kachone”)
 
RESPONDING PARTY: None
 
            The Court has considered the moving
papers.  No opposition has been
filed.  Any opposition was required to
have been filed and served at least nine court days prior to the hearing.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1005, subd. (b).)
 
BACKGROUND
             This case arises from a landlord-tenant
dispute.  On November 9, 2020, Plaintiff Jason
Grendus (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Defendants Yacov Cohen and
Kachone, alleging a single cause of action for Breach of Contract.  On April 30, 2021, Kachone filed a
cross-complaint against Plaintiff for 1) Breach of Implied Warranty of Habitability;
2) Negligence; 3) Nuisance; 4) Breach of Contract; 5) Breach of the Covenant of
Good Faith and Fair Dealing; 6) Fraud; 7) Violation of Civil Code section
1946.2; 8) Violation f the Tenant Protection Act; 9) Violation of COVID-19
Tenant Relief Act; and 10) Violation of the CARES Act.
 
After
a bench trial held on April 10 and 11, 2024, the Court issued a ruling in its July
12, 2024 Minute Order, finding, in relevant part to this Motion, as follows:
 
The
Court finds in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant Kachone on the
Complaint in the amount of $7,841.07 for rent unpaid from May 1, 2019 through
April 31, 2020.  The Court finds that no
pre-judgment interest is due on this amount, as it was not a sum certain prior
to the date of this order.
 
The
Court finds that Plaintiff is entitled to collect his attorney’s fees, as
proven, in an amount not to exceed $500, against Kachone.  The Court finds that Plaintiff is entitled to
collect his costs against Kachone, on the basis of a Bill of Costs, to be filed
and served.
 
(7/12/24 Minute
Order, p. 9.)
 
            On July 30, 2024, Plaintiff filed his
Memorandum of Costs.  On August 12, 2024,
Kachone filed the instant Motion to Tax Costs (the “Motion”).  Judgment was entered on August 14, 2024.  On September 6, 2024, Plaintiff filed an
Amended Memorandum of Costs. 
 
DISCUSSION
             In general, the “prevailing
party” is entitled as a matter of right to recover costs for suit in any action
or proceeding.  (CCP § 1032(b); Santisas v. Goodin (1998) 17 Cal.4th
599, 606; Scott Co. of Calif. V. Blount,
Inc. (1999) 20 Cal.4th 1103, 1108.) 
“Prevailing party” includes the party with a net monetary recovery, a
defendant in whose favor a dismissal is entered, a defendant where neither
plaintiff nor defendant obtains any relief, and a defendant as against those
plaintiffs who do not recover any relief against that defendant.  (CCP § 1032(a)(4).)
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5 sets forth
the costs recoverable by the prevailing party.  To recover a cost, it must be reasonably
necessary to the litigation and reasonable in amount.  (Perko’s
Enterprises, Inc. v. RRNS Enterprises (l992) 4 Cal.App.4th 238, 244.)  If the items appearing in a cost bill appear
to be proper charges, the burden is on the party seeking to tax costs to show
that they were not reasonable or necessary.  (Ladas
v. California State Automotive Assoc. (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 761,
773-74.)  On the other hand, if the items
are properly objected to, they are put in issue and the burden of proof is on
the party claiming them as costs.  (Id.) 

 
“[T]he mere filing of a motion to tax costs may be
a ‘proper objection’ to an item, the necessity of which appears doubtful, or
which does not appear to be proper on its face.”  (Nelson
v. Anderson (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 111, 131.)  “However, ‘[i]f the items appear to be proper
charges the verified memorandum is prima facie evidence that the costs,
expenses and services therein listed were necessarily incurred by the defendant
[citations], and the burden of showing that an item is not properly chargeable
or is unreasonable is upon the [objecting party].’”  (Id.
[quoting Oak Grove School Dist. V. City
Title Ins. Co. (1963) 217 Cal.App.2d 678, 699] [alterations in original].)
 
            As an initial matter,
the Court notes that Plaintiff filed a Memorandum of Costs prior to the entry
of judgment.  The Court, however, will
proceed to consider it.  The premature filing of a memorandum of costs is treated as
“a mere irregularity at best” that does not constitute reversible error absent
a showing of prejudice.  (Haley v. Casa Del Rey Homeowners Assn.
(2007) 153 Cal.App.4th 863, 880.)  Further, courts treat prematurely filed
cost bills as being timely filed.  (Id.)  Here, there
is no evidence that the filing of the memorandum of costs before the entry of
judgment caused any prejudice.
 
Here,
Kachone moves to strike Plaintiff’s costs in its entirety, or to strike the following
items in Plaintiff’s Memorandum of Costs: 1) court-ordered transcripts; 2)
court reporter fees; and 3) fees for electronic filing.
 
While
under Code Civ. Proc. 1033, subd (a), a court does have the discretion to
deny a plaintiff’s recovery of litigation costs where a prevailing party
recovers a judgment that could have been rendered in a limited civil case, the
Court declines to deny Plaintiff’s recovery of costs in its entirety.  
 
The
Court, however, shall consider the individual items that Kachone seeks to
strike or tax.
 
Kachone
avers that the $462.27 cost pertaining to transcripts should be stricken as he
is unaware of any transcripts that were ordered by the Court.  Kachone also moves to strike the filing fees,
arguing that without a worksheet, it is impossible to discern how the amount
claimed is arrived at.  
 
The
Court notes that in his Amended Memorandum of Costs, Plaintiff did include a
worksheet to support these costs claimed to have been incurred.  Moreover, a
verified memorandum of costs is prima facie evidence that the costs, expenses,
and services therein listed were necessarily incurred.  (Rappenecker v. Sea-Land Serv., Inc.
(1979) 93 Cal.App.3d 256, 266.)  A party seeking to tax costs must provide
evidence to rebut this prima facie showing.  (Jones v. Dumrichob (1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 1258, 1266.)  Mere
statements unsupported by facts are insufficient to rebut the prima facie
showing that costs were necessarily incurred.  (Id.)  Thus, the Court denies Kachone’s motion as to
transcripts and electronic filing fees. 
 
Regarding
the court reporter fees, Kachone asserts that the $3,604 should be stricken or
taxed, as this expense was split equally between the three parties in this case,
and no deposition was taken.  This
assertion is supported by a declaration of Kachone’s counsel.  (Declaration of Barak Isaacs, ¶ 3.)  In the absence of an opposition rebutting
this assertion, the Court gives credence to the same.  Accordingly, the Court taxes the court
reporter fees by $2,403 reflecting the share of the two other parties in this
case.
 
RULING
Based on the foregoing, the Motion is GRANTED in
part, and DENIED in part. The amount taxed is $2,403.  
 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
