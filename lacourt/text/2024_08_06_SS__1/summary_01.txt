And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on a petition to correct or vacate an arbitration award. The petition was filed by Plaintiff Bianca Ball, who alleges labor law violations by defendants CDC Restaurant Group, Inc. and Jeremiah Cillpam. The arbitrator, Hon. Monica Bachner (ret.), issued a partial award holding that the labor agreement does not permit or require classwide arbitration, either under California or federal law. The Court will correct the Award by striking the portion applying federal law to the question of whether class arbitration is appropriate and otherwise confirm the award. The Court finds that the arbitrator did not exceed her authority in applying federal law to this issue, but did exceed her authority in revisiting the question of whether the Agreement permits class arbitration under federal law. The petition is granted in part, and the Court will correct the Award and confirm it as corrected.
