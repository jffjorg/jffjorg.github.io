And here is the summary in English text:

The case involves a motion to consolidate two actions: ZARUK HACIKIAN, an individual, v. TADEH MATOUSI, an individual aka Tod the Builder, and SARO MATOUSI, an individual, and TADEH MATOUSI, et al. v. ZARUK HACIKIAN, small claims case. The plaintiff is seeking to consolidate the cases, arguing that the issues of fact and law are common to both actions and that consolidation would avoid unnecessary costs and delays, promote efficient use of judicial resources, and avoid inconsistent verdicts.

The parties have filed various motions and oppositions, with the defendants arguing that consolidation would severely impair their due process rights, create procedural irregularities, and lead to potential res judicata issues. The judge has reviewed the pleadings and has tentatively ruled that the motion to consolidate is denied, citing the need for the small claims court to consider the matter and the procedural requirements of CCP §116.390.
