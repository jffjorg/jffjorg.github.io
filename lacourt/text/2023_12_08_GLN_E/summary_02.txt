And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling is to deny the motion to compel arbitration filed by Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC (MBUSA) against Christian Navarro, the plaintiff. MBUSA is seeking to compel arbitration under the Retail Installment Sale Contract (RISC) despite being a non-signatory to the agreement. The Court finds that MBUSA's arguments on equitable estoppel and third-party beneficiary doctrine are inapplicable and distinguishable from previous cases. The Court also notes that the RISC is a non-signatory agreement and that the plaintiff has not waived his right to arbitration. The Court overrules the plaintiff's objections to the RISC and grants the plaintiff's request for judicial notice. The hearing is set for December 8, 2023, to address any further issues.
