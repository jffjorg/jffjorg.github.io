(Compl. ¶15.)
MOTION 1 – Compel Further Responses to
Special Interrogatories
RELIEF REQUESTED
Plaintiff
moves the Court for an order compelling further responses to Plaintiff’s
Special Interrogatories and for monetary sanctions in the amount of $2,385.00
against Defendant FCA US LLC and its attorneys of record, Ongaro PC.
This
motion is made on the grounds that Defendant FCA US LLC has not provided Code compliant
responses to Plaintiff’s Special Interrogatories numbers 18-23, 25, 26, 29-31,
and 43- 48, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.300, subdivision
(e) and 2023.030, subdivision (g).)
The
Court notes that the relief requested in the Notice only referred to
“Plaintiff,” despite the fact that there are two Plaintiffs.
Procedural
Moving
Party: Movant simply refers to “Plaintiff” despite there being two Plaintiffs.
The Court will presume that both Plaintiffs, John and Ronda Ramseyer are moving
to compel further responses since Exhibit A in the Lopez Declaration states
that the propounding party is Plaintiffs, John Ramseyer and Ronda Ramseyer.

Responding Party: Defendant, FCA US LLC

LEGAL
STANDARD - COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES TO INTERROGATORIES
Under CCP § 2017.010, “any party may
obtain discovery regarding any matter, not privileged, that is relevant to the
subject matter involved in the pending action..., if the matter either is
itself admissible in evidence or appears reasonably calculated to lead to the
discovery of admissible evidence.”  The
Section specifically provides that “[d]iscovery may relate to the claim or
defense of the party seeking discovery or of any other party to the action,”
and that discovery “may be obtained of the identity and location of persons
having knowledge of any discoverable matter, as well as of the existence,
description, nature, custody, condition and location of any document, electronically
stored information, tangible thing, or land or other property.”
On receipt of a
response to interrogatories, the propounding party may move for an order
compelling a further response if the propounding party deems that any of the
following apply:
(1)   An answer to a particular interrogatory is
evasive or incomplete.
(2)   An exercise of the option to produce documents
under Section 2030.230 is unwarranted or the required specification of those
documents is inadequate.
(3)   An objection to an interrogatory is without
merit or too general.
(CCP §2030.300(a).
If a timely motion to compel has been filed,
the¿burden is on the responding party¿to justify any objection or failure fully
to answer.¿(Coy v. Superior Court of Contra Costa County (1962) 58
Cal.2d 210, 220–221 [addressing a motion to compel further responses to
interrogatories]; see also¿Fairmont Ins. Co. v. Superior Court¿(2000) 22
Cal.4th 245, 255.)  
“While the party propounding interrogatories may have
the burden of filing a motion to compel if it finds the answers it receives
unsatisfactory, the burden of justifying any objection and failure to respond
remains at all times with the party resisting an interrogatory.” (Williams
v. Superior Court (2017) 3 Cal.5th 531, 541 citing Coy v. Superior Court
(1962) 58 Cal.2d 210, 220-221.)
Furthermore, to the extent there is any doubt in
whether these records should be discoverable, California’s liberal approach to
discovery provides that doubt should be resolved in favor of permitting
discovery. (Pacific Tel. & Tel. Co. v. Superior Court (1970) 2
Cal.3d 161, 173.)
The party to whom interrogatories have been propounded
shall respond in writing under oath separately to each interrogatory by any of
the following:
(1) An answer
containing the information sought to be discovered.
(2) An exercise of
the party’s option to produce writings.
(3) An objection to
the particular interrogatory.
 
(CCP §2030.210(a).)
PROCEDURAL
ANALYSIS
45-Day
Requirement
“Unless notice of this motion is given within
45 days of the service of the verified response, or any supplemental verified
response, or on or before any specific later date to which the propounding
party and the responding party have agreed in writing, the propounding party
waives any right to compel a further response to the interrogatories.” (CCP
§2030.300(c).)
Here, Movant’s motion appears timely. Movant explained
how responding party never provided verifications.
Meet and Confer
“A
motion under subdivision (a) shall be accompanied by a meet and confer
declaration under Section 2016.040.” (CCP §2030.300(b)(1).)
Here, Movant included the declaration of Lopez wherein
a meet and confer was alleged in ¶5 of the declaration. 
Opposition’s argument that Movant did not comply with
the meet and confer requirement is unavailing. Opposition argues that Movant
did not comply with Department E’s requirement that states, “The parties must
first meet and confer in person, by video conference, or by telephone call to
attempt to informally resolve all discovery issues. If the parties cannot
agree, the Court requests that the parties schedule an Informal Discovery
Conference (IDC) with the Courtroom Assistant and participate in the IDC before
filing any discovery motion.” Here, the Court does not find this sufficient to
deny the motion because Movant attempted to meet and confer by email and
Opposition did not respond.
SUBSTANTIVE ANALYSIS
As
a preliminary matter, Opposition argues that Plaintiffs provided virtually no
substantive discussion demonstrating good cause for further responses to
Plaintiffs’ SROGs. 
Here, the Court does not find this argument availing.
The burden is not on the movant to demonstrate good cause. While a motion to
compel a further response to an inspection demand requires good cause, a motion
to compel a further response to an interrogatory does not. (Compare CCP
§2031.310(b)(1) to CCP §2030.300(b).)
“While the party propounding interrogatories may have
the burden of filing a motion to compel if it finds the answers it receives
unsatisfactory, the burden of justifying any objection and failure to respond
remains at all times with the party resisting an interrogatory.” (Williams
v. Superior Court (2017) 3 Cal.5th 531, 541 citing Coy v. Superior Court
(1962) 58 Cal.2d 210, 220-221.)
Movant argues that FCA has either completely refused
to answer the questions asked, provided evasive responses, or provided
responses that are not code compliant. Movant also mentions how verifications
were not provided. Movant also argues that FCA’s objections in response are
improper.
Here, the Court tentatively plans to GRANT Plaintiffs’
motion to compel further responses. 
As a preliminary matter, FCA’s responses appear to
either object entirely, or have objections interspersed with responses.
Unlike Movant, who submitted a separate statement, FCA
did not submit a separate statement in Opposition. While the Court does not
find that it is a requirement for FCA to submit a separate statement in
Opposition, FCA does have the burden of justifying any objections and failure
to respond to the interrogatories. With no separate statement in Opposition,
much of FCA’s Opposition is boilerplate pertaining to discovery, generally
speaking, that does not specifically justify its objections with respect to any
of the individual SROGs at issue. Therefore, it is difficult to decipher
Opposition’s arguments attempting to justify its objections. 
The most specific the Opposition gets with respect to discussing
individual SROGs, is when Opposition states:
The amount at
issue concerning Plaintiffs’ single vehicle does not warrant requiring Defendant
to conduct a search for (#25) training materials, (# 26 and 31) policies and
procedures for complying with Song-Beverly, (#45 & 46) anticipated and
actual repair rates and (#47 & 48) most common symptoms or complaints
regarding all 2016 Jeep Cherokee vehicles. There are hundreds of agents that
process Song Beverly claims for the State of California and each one operates
on a case-by-case basis with their own methodology as per FCA US policies and
procedures delineated in the Warranty Administration Manual, Dealer Policy Manual,
and CAC Policies & Procedures, as already produced months ago subject to a
protective order.
 
(Oppo. p. 4-5.)
 
As to the
statement above by Opposition, the Court isn’t sure what Opposition is even trying
to explain. 
 
FCA further
responds as follows: “Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.230,
please see the copy of the Dealer Policy Manual, the copy of the policies and
procedures of its Customer Assistance Center regarding handling of customer
complaints and requests for refund or replacement of their vehicle, produced by
FCA US in response to Plaintiffs’ First Set of Requests for Production of
Documents No. 19.” (See response to SROG 18.) As to those responses with
reference to 2030.230, the Court does not see how those responses are appropriate
in the instant scenario. 
 
CCP §2030.230
states, “ If the answer to an interrogatory would necessitate the
preparation or the making of a compilation, abstract, audit, or summary of or
from the documents of the party to whom the interrogatory is directed, and if
the burden or expense of preparing or making it would be substantially the same
for the party propounding the interrogatory as for the responding party, it is
a sufficient answer to that interrogatory to refer to this section and to
specify the writings from which the answer may be derived or ascertained. This
specification shall be in sufficient detail to permit the propounding party to
locate and to identify, as readily as the responding party can, the documents
from which the answer may be ascertained. The responding party shall then
afford to the propounding party a reasonable opportunity to examine, audit, or
inspect these documents and to make copies, compilations, abstracts, or
summaries of them.”
 
The Court fails to
see how 2030.230 is applicable in the instant scenario, and Opposition makes no
cognizable argument as to how that response is appropriate in the
circumstances. 
 
FCA further
responds as follows: “In California and pursuant to the Song-Beverly Consumer
Warranty Act, FCA US would offer to repurchase or replace a new motor vehicle
if it contained a non-conformity covered by the applicable limited express
warranty that substantially impaired its use, value or safety that was not
repaired after a reasonable number of attempts to do so.” (See SROG 19.)
As to those responses, the Court fails to see how that response is responsive
to the interrogatories, thus those responses appear evasive.
 
Further, in
several of FCA’s responses, FCA stated that the SROGs were not relevant or reasonably
calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. The Opposition also
brings these objections up, presumably in an attempt to justify those
objections, but FCA doesn’t explain in any cognizable manner as to how the
requests are not relevant, overly broad, or not reasonably calculated to lead
to the discovery of admissible evidence.
 
TENTATIVE RULING
MOTION 1
 
Plaintiffs’ motion
to compel further responses to SROGs 18-23, 25, 26, 29-31, and 43-48 is
GRANTED. 
 
FCA did not
justify its objections. Further, it is entirely unclear how § 2030.230 is
applicable in the instant scenario, and several of FCA’s responses seemed
evasive as it is unclear how several of the responses are responsive to the
SROGs. 
 
FCA is to provide
verified, code compliant responses, without objections in 10 days. The Court
directs FCA to CCP §§ 2030.210 and 2030.220. 
 
Sanctions
“The court shall
impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010)
against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a
motion to compel a further response to interrogatories, unless it finds that
the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that
other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (CCP
§2030.300(d).)
 
“The court may
award sanctions under the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion
to compel discovery, even though no opposition to the motion was filed, or
opposition to the motion was withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided
to the moving party after the motion was filed.” (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule
3.1348(a).) 
 
Movant request monetary sanctions in the amount of
$2,385.00 imposed against FCA US LLC and its attorneys of record, Ongaro PC.
Movant explains its sanctions request as follows:
10. As a result of
Defendant’s failure to provide Code-compliant responses and the time and effort
it took Plaintiffs to meet and confer, Plaintiffs respectfully requests that
this Court award monetary sanctions for the costs associated with Plaintiffs’ preparation
of this motion. The total legal fees incurred of preparing the motion and
supportive papers will be as follows: 
a. I spent 2.6
hours drafting the instant motion, separate statement, proposed order, notice
of motion, and declaration, at my normal billing rate of $375.00 per hour, for
a total of $825.00. 
b. It is also
reasonably anticipated that I will spend an additional two hours reviewing
Defendant’s opposition and drafting a reply at my normal billing rate of
$375.00 per hour, for a total of $750.00. 
c. Finally, it is
reasonably anticipated I will spend an additional two hours preparing for and
attending the scheduled hearing on this matter at my normal billing rate of
$325.00, for a total of $750.00 d. In all, legal fees will total $2,475.00. 
11. Our office
will be forced to spend $60.00 in filing the instant motion. 
12. Adding up the
figures above equals a total of $2,535.00. These sanctions are sought against
Defendant FCA US LLC and its attorneys of record, Ongaro P.C.
 
(Lopez Decl. ¶¶10-12.)
 
Opposition argues
against sanctions by stating:
 
Based upon
Plaintiffs’ failure to comply with the Court’s requirements for discovery
motions, i.e. meeting and conferring in person, by video conference or by
telephone, and for requesting an IDC prior to filing any discovery motion,
there is simply no justification for sanctions in this case. In fact, the court
“shall” sanction the moving party if the moving party files a Motion to Compel
before attempting a “reasonable and good faith attempt” to meet and confer with
the responding party. (See CCP §§ 2023.010 (i) and 2023.030.)
 
(Oppo. p. 8.)
 
The issue of
sanctions will be taken up at the hearing.


MOTION 2 – Compel
Further – Requests for Production
 
RELIEF REQUESTED
Plaintiffs
move the Court for an order compelling responses to Plaintiffs’ First Set of Requests
for Production and for monetary sanctions in the amount of $2,535.00 against
Defendant FCA US LLC and its attorneys of record, Ongaro P.C. 
This motion is made on the grounds that Defendant FCA
US LLC has not provided Code-compliant responses to Plaintiffs’ Requests for
Production numbers 16-32 and 45-46 pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section
2031.310.

LEGAL STANDARD – COMPEL FURTHER – REQUESTS
FOR PRODUCTION
Under CCP § 2017.010, “any party may obtain discovery
regarding any matter, not privileged, that is relevant to the subject matter
involved in the pending action..., if the matter either is itself admissible in
evidence or appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of
admissible evidence.”  The Section
specifically provides that “[d]iscovery may relate to the claim or defense of
the party seeking discovery or of any other party to the action,” and that discovery
“may be obtained of the identity and location of persons having knowledge of
any discoverable matter, as well as of the existence, description, nature,
custody, condition and location of any document, electronically stored
information, tangible thing, or land or other property.”

 
CCP § 2031.310(a) provides that a party demanding a document
inspection may move for an order compelling further responses to the demand if
the demanding party deems that:
“(1)   A statement of compliance with the demand is
incomplete.
  (2)   A
representation of inability to comply is inadequate, incomplete, or evasive.
  (3)  
An objection in the response is without merit or too general.”  

 
Under
CCP § 2031.310 (b)(1), “The motion shall set forth specific facts showing good
cause justifying the discovery sought by the demand.”  
 
“In
the more specific context of a demand for production of a tangible thing, the
party who asks the trial court to compel production must show “good cause” for
the request—but unless there is a legitimate privilege issue or claim of
attorney work product, that burden is met simply by a fact-specific showing of
relevance.” (TBG Ins. Services Corp. v. Superior Court (2002) 96
Cal.App.4th 443, 448.)


ANALYSIS
45-Day Requirement
Unless
notice of this motion is given within 45 days of the service of the verified
response, or any supplemental verified response, or on or before any specific
later date to which the demanding party and the responding party have agreed in
writing, the demanding party waives any right to compel a further response to
the demand. (CCP §2031.310(c).) 
Here, Movant’s motion appears timely. Movant explained
how responding party never provided verifications.
Meet and Confer
“The
motion shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section
2016.040.” (CCP §2031.310(b)(2).)
Here, Movant included the declaration of Lopez wherein
a meet and confer was alleged in ¶5 of the declaration. 
Opposition’s argument that Movant did not comply with
the meet and confer requirement is unavailing. Opposition argues that Movant
did not comply with Department E’s requirement that states, “The parties must
first meet and confer in person, by video conference, or by telephone call to
attempt to informally resolve all discovery issues. If the parties cannot
agree, the Court requests that the parties schedule an Informal Discovery
Conference (IDC) with the Courtroom Assistant and participate in the IDC before
filing any discovery motion.” Here, the Court does not find this as sufficient
grounds to deny the motion because Movant attempted to meet and confer by email
and Opposition did not respond.
ANALYSIS
REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION NO. 16. 
All of YOUR warranty claims policy and procedure
manual(s) from 2018 to the present.
RESPONSE TO REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION 16:

FCA US will comply in part with this request and
produce, subject to protective order, a copy of the current Warranty
Administration manual. FCA US otherwise objects to this request because it is
vague, ambiguous, overly broad and seeks information neither relevant nor
reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence or
proportional to the needs of this case. FCA US also objects to Plaintiffs’
definition of the term “YOUR” because it is overly broad and compound, and
includes entities not owned or operated by FCA US and individuals or entities
who are not agents of FCA US and not within FCA US’s control.
TENTATIVE RULING RFP 16
The
Court will hear argument as to RFP 16.
Under CCP § 2031.310 (b)(1), “The motion shall set
forth specific facts showing good cause justifying the discovery sought by the
demand.”  
“In the more specific context of a demand for
production of a tangible thing, the party who asks the trial court to compel
production must show “good cause” for the request—but unless there is a
legitimate privilege issue or claim of attorney work product, that burden is
met simply by a fact-specific showing of relevance.” (TBG Ins. Services
Corp. v. Superior Court (2002) 96 Cal.App.4th 443, 448.)
For the most part, Movant has demonstrated good cause
with respect to the instant request by explaining how this request is relevant
to FCA’s policies and procedures and whether FCA complied with the Song-Beverly
Act. However, Movant’s motion states that the instant action pertains to a 2016
Jeep Cherokee. The Court is unclear as to why the request pertains to the years
2018 to the present. Further, the Court is unclear as to why the request isn’t
limited to warranty claims policy and procedure manuals that are limited to the
same make, model, and year of the subject vehicle.
If the Movant can demonstrate good cause with respect
to “from 2018 to the present,” and why the request isn’t limited to warranty
claims policy and procedure manuals of the same make, model, and year of the
subject vehicle, the Court is inclined to grant this motion with respect to
this RFP and overrule FCA’s objections. If Movant cannot demonstrate good
cause, then the Court is inclined to Deny this motion with respect to this RFP.
Further, if Movant demonstrates good cause, the Court
does not find FCA’s response with respect to the protective order to be
compliant. The Movant explains that the code does not allow a party to
unilaterally condition production on a protective order. The Court finds
Movant’s argument availing because §§ 2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230 and 2031.240
explain how responding party is to respond. Responding party’s response did not
comply with those code sections. Further, if responding party were to move for
a protective order, it appears that FCA would have had to have complied with § 2031.060,
and here, FCA did not move for a protective order.
Lastly, if the Movant demonstrates good cause, the
Court does not find FCA’s objections justified as they are boilerplate and FCA
does not explain in a cognizable fashion how the objections are justified. 
FCA did not submit a separate statement in Opposition.
While the Court does not find that it is a requirement for FCA to submit a
separate statement in Opposition, FCA has the burden of justifying any
objections after Movant first establishes good cause. The burden is on the
moving party to show both relevance to the subject matter and specific facts
justifying discovery. (Glenfed Develop. Corp. v. Superior Court (1997)
53 Cal.App.4th 1113, 1117.  Once good
cause is established by the moving party, the burden then shifts to the
responding party to justify any objections made to document disclosure. (See Hartbrodt
v. Burke (1996) 42 Cal.App.4th 168, 172-174.)
With no separate statement in Opposition, much of
FCA’s Opposition is boilerplate pertaining to discovery, generally speaking,
that does not specifically justify its objections with respect to any of the
individual RFPs at issue. Therefore, it is difficult to decipher Opposition’s
arguments attempting to justify its objections. 
The most specific the Opposition gets with respect to
talking about individual requests, Opposition states:
The amount at
issue concerning Plaintiffs’ single vehicle does not warrant requiring
Defendant to conduct a search for (#25) training materials, (# 26 and 31)
policies and procedures for complying with Song-Beverly, (#45 & 46)
anticipated and actual repair rates and (#47 & 48) most common symptoms or
complaints regarding all 2016 Jeep Cherokee vehicles. There are hundreds of
agents that process Song Beverly claims for the State of California and each
one operates on a case-by-case basis with their own methodology as per FCA US
policies and procedures delineated in the Warranty Administration Manual,
Dealer Policy Manual, and CAC Policies & Procedures, as already produced
months ago subject to a protective order.
 
(Oppo. p.5.)
 
As to the statement above in Opposition, the Court is
unclear what Opposition is trying to say.
REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION NO. 17. 
YOUR workshop manual(s) for the SUBJECT VEHICLE. 
RESPONSE TO REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION 17:

FCA US will comply in full to this request and
produce, subject to protective order, a copy of the Service Manual applicable
to the SUBJECT VEHICLE. FCA US objects to Plaintiffs’ definition of the term
“YOUR” because it is overly broad, compound, and includes entities not owned or
operated by FCA US as well as individuals or entities who are not agents of FCA
US nor within FCA US’ control.
TENTATIVE RULING RFP 17
Here,
the Court finds that Movant demonstrated good cause. 
Further, the Court does not find FCA’s response with
respect to the protective order to be compliant. The Movant explains how the
code does not allow a party to unilaterally condition production on a
protective order. The Court finds Movant’s argument availing because §§ 2031.210,
2031.220, 2031.230 and 2031.240 explain how responding party is to respond.
Responding party’s response did not comply with those code sections. Further,
if responding party were to move for a protective order, it appears that FCA
would have had to have complied with § 2031.060, and here, FCA did not move for
a protective order.
The Court does not find FCA’s objections justified as
they are boilerplate and FCA does not explain in a cognizable fashion how the
objections are justified. Again, FCA did not submit a separate statement in
Opposition. While the Court does not find that it is a requirement for FCA to
submit a separate statement in Opposition, as noted FCA has the burden of
justifying any objections after Movant first establishes good cause.
With no separate statement in Opposition, much of
FCA’s Opposition is boilerplate pertaining to discovery, generally speaking,
that does not specifically justify its objections with respect to any of the
individual RFPs at issue. Therefore, it is difficult to decipher Opposition’s
arguments attempting to justify its objections 
The more specific statement is identical to the one
discussed above in re RFP 16.
Plaintiffs’ motion to compel further response to RFP
17 is GRANTED. FCA is to provide a verified, code compliant, further response,
without objection.
REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION NO. 18.

The operative Franchise Agreement, if any, on the date
of sale of the SUBJECT VEHICLE between YOU and the dealership that sold the
SUBJECT VEHICLE to Plaintiffs. 
RESPONSE TO REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION 18:

FCA US objects to this request because it is overly
broad and seeks information neither relevant nor reasonably calculated to lead
to the discovery of admissible evidence or proportional to the needs of this
case.
TENTATIVE RULING RFP 18
Here,
Movant’s separate statement demonstrated good cause as to the request. The
Court incorporates its prior reasoning as explained in “Tentative Ruling RFP
17” with respect to its explanation on overruling the instant objections in RFP
18.
Plaintiffs’ motion to compel further response to RFP 18
is GRANTED. FCA is to provide a verified, code compliant, further response,
without objection.
REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION NO. 19.

All DOCUMENTS which describe the procedures used by
YOU for evaluating and responding to complaints by California consumers
regarding vehicles YOU manufactured or distributed since 2018. 
RESPONSE TO REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION 19:

FCA US will comply in full with this request and will
produce, subject to protective order, a copy of its Warranty Administration
Manual, Dealer Policy Manual, and Customer Assistance Center Policies and
Procedures for the Subject Vehicle. FCA US otherwise objects to this request
because it is vague, ambiguous, overly broad and seeks information neither
relevant nor reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible
evidence or proportional to the needs of this case. FCA US also objects to Plaintiffs’
definition of the term “YOU” because it is overly broad and compound, and
includes entities not owned or operated by FCA US and individuals or entities
who are not agents of FCA US and not within FCA US’s control.
TENTATIVE RULING RFP 19
The
Court will hear argument as to RFP 19. The Court also adopts the further
reasoning explained in “Tentative Ruling RFP 16,” into this ruling as the Court
is unclear as to why 2018 is relevant when the Subject Vehicle is a 2016.
Further, the Court is unclear why the request is not limited to the same make,
model, and year of the subject vehicle. If the Movant demonstrates good cause,
the Court is inclined to grant the motion with respect to this request as
explained in “Tentative Ruling RFP 16.”
REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION NO. 20. 
All DOCUMENTS which describe policies, procedures,
and/or instructions since 2018 that YOUR employees and agents should follow
when evaluating a customer request for a refund of their money paid towards or
owed on a motor vehicle manufactured or distributed by YOU.
RESPONSE TO REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION 20:

FCA US will comply in full with this request and will
produce, subject to protective order, a copy of its Warranty Administration
Manual, Dealer Policy Manual, and Customer Assistance Center Policies and
Procedures for the Subject Vehicle. FCA US otherwise objects to this request
because it is vague, ambiguous, overly broad and seeks information neither
relevant nor reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible
evidence or proportional to the needs of this case. FCA US also objects to Plaintiffs’
definition of the terms “YOU” and/or “YOUR” because it is overly broad and

All DOCUMENTS describing YOUR policies, procedures,
and parameters for defining what constitutes a “reasonable number of repair
attempts” to determine eligibility for a vehicle repurchase pursuant to the
Song-Beverly Act since 2018. 
RESPONSE TO REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION 28: 
FCA US does not utilize a single definition of what
constitutes a reasonable number of repairs when considering whether a vehicle
qualifies for repurchase under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act.
California Civil Code section 1793.2 does not define what constitutes a
reasonable number of repair attempts. Whether a vehicle was repaired within a
reasonable number of repair attempts will vary depending on myriad factors
including, but not limited to, the mechanical component being repaired, the
nature of the mechanical problem, the ability of the customer to accurately
describe the mechanical problem, the availability of diagnostic information
identifying the mechanical problem, the availability of replacement parts, if
needed, and the existence of more than one mechanical problem with similar
presentations, considerations of whether the problem is related to an earlier
mechanical problem, and considerations of whether the problem is related to a
component that is covered by an applicable warranty. FCA US will nonetheless
comply in full with this request and will produce, subject to protective order,
a copy of its Warranty Administration Manual, Dealer Policy Manual, and
Customer Assistance Center Policies and Procedures for the Subject Vehicle. FCA
US otherwise objects to this request because it is vague, ambiguous, overly
broad and seeks information neither relevant nor reasonably calculated to lead
to the discovery of admissible evidence or proportional to the needs of this
case. FCA US also objects to Plaintiffs’ definition of the term “YOUR” because
it is overly broad and compound, and includes entities not owned or operated by
FCA US and individuals or entities who are not agents of FCA US and not within
FCA US’s control.

TENTATIVE RULING RFP 32
The
Court will hear argument as to RFP 32. See reasoning explained in “Tentative
Ruling RFP 19.” The difference the Court notes with this RFP is that it
pertains to 2015 to present. However, the Court still has concerns as to the
RFP not pertaining to the same make, model, and year of the subject vehicle and
why the RFP extends all the way “to the present,” when the instant vehicle is a
2016.

Jeep Cherokee vehicles regarding any of the complaints that the SUBJECT VEHICLE
was presented to YOUR or YOUR authorized repair facilities for repair during

ambiguous, overly broad and seeks information neither relevant nor reasonably

owned or operated by FCA US and individuals or entities who are not agents of
FCA US and not within FCA US’s control.

is GRANTED. FCA is to provide a verified, code compliant, further response,

All DOCUMENTS evidencing warranty repairs to 2016 Jeep
Cherokee vehicles regarding any of the components that YOU or YOUR authorized
repair facilities performed repairs on under warranty. 
RESPONSE TO REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION 46:

FCA US objects to this request because it is vague,
ambiguous, overly broad and seeks information neither relevant nor reasonably
calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence or proportional to
the needs of this case. FCA US also objects to Plaintiffs’ definition of the
terms “YOU” and/or “YOUR” because it is overly broad and compound, and includes
entities not owned or operated by FCA US and individuals or entities who are
not agents of FCA US and not within FCA US’s control.
TENTATIVE RULING RFP 46
Here,
Movant’s separate statement demonstrated good cause as to the request. The

OVERALL AS TO ALL TENTATIVE RULINGS

Sanctions
Except
as provided in subdivision (j), the court shall impose a monetary sanction
under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person,
or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel further
response to a demand, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction
acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the
imposition of the sanction unjust. (CCP §2031.310(h).)
“The court may award
sanctions under the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to
compel discovery, even though no opposition to the motion was filed, or
opposition to the motion was withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided
to the moving party after the motion was filed.” (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule
3.1348(a).) 
Movant requests monetary sanctions in the amount of
$2,535.00 against Defendant FCA US LLC and its attorneys of record, Ongaro P.C.
Movant explains its sanctions request as follows:
10. As a result of
Defendant’s failure to provide Code-compliant responses and the time and effort
it took Plaintiff to meet and confer, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this
Court award monetary sanctions for the costs associated with Plaintiff’s preparation
of this motion. The total legal fees incurred of preparing the motion and
supportive papers will be as follows: 
a. I spent a total
of 2.6 hours drafting the instant motion, separate statement, proposed order,
notice of motion, and declaration, at my normal billing rate of $375.00 per
hour, for a total of $975.00. 
b. It is also
reasonably anticipated that I will spend an additional two hours reviewing
Defendant’s opposition and drafting a reply at my normal billing rate of
$375.00 per hour, for a total of $750.00. 
c. Finally, it is
reasonably anticipated I will spend an additional two hours preparing for and
attending the scheduled hearing on this matter at my normal billing rate of
$325.00, for a total of $750.00 
d. In all, legal
fees will total $2,475.00. 
11. Our office
will be forced to spend $60.00 in filing the instant motion. 
12. Adding up the
figures above equals a total of $2,535.00. These sanctions are sought against
Defendant FCA US LLC and its attorneys of record, Ongaro P.C.
 
(Lopez Decl.
¶10-12.)
 
In Opposition, FCA
argues that sanctions should not be imposed because Plaintiffs did not comply
with Department E’s discovery requirements pertaining to an IDC and that
Plaintiffs did not make a reasonable and good faith attempt to meet and confer.
 
The Court finds Opposition’s
argument against imposing sanctions to be weak considering that FCA never
responded to Plaintiffs’ letter attempting to meet and confer. 
 
The issue of sanctions will be taken up at the
hearing.
