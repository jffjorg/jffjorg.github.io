And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendants' motion for summary judgment. The defendants, Anastasia Beverly Hills, LLC and Anastasia Soare, argued that plaintiff Arnold Simon's claims are barred by the terms of the 2000 Termination Agreement, which they claim Simon signed, selling his shares of Anastasia Beverly Hills, LLC for $1,487,155. However, the judge found that the defendants failed to meet their burden of showing that Simon cannot establish one or more of the claims asserted in the complaint. The judge also found that the defendants' evidence does not show that they paid Simon in full, and that Simon has provided admissible evidence that the defendants remain indebted to him in the amount of $229,507.07 under the Termination Agreement. Additionally, the judge found that there are disputed issues of fact regarding the defendants' performance of the Amendment to the Termination Agreement and the authenticity and validity of the purported assignment of Simon's shares to Soare. As a result, the judge denied the defendants' motion for summary judgment and allowed the case to proceed to trial.
