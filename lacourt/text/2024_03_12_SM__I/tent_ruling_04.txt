 Case Number:  23SMCV01051    Hearing Date:   March 12, 2024    Dept:  I These are the last two of 11 motions to compel.  Although the court believes that some of the
requests are broader than they ought to be, the fact is that plaintiff has not
opposed the motion and (unlike the case for document production) the
propounding party need make no showing as to interrogatories and RFA’s.  Accordingly, the motion to compel further
responses to interrogatories is GRANTED. 
Complete, code-compliant, verified responses will be served within 10
court days without objection.  The
requests for admission are DEEMED ADMITTED unless, prior to this hearing,
responses were served.  The request for
sanctions is GRANTED.  Sanctions in the
amount of $1320 for both motions combined are imposed against plaintiff but not
counsel.  They are payable within 30
days.
