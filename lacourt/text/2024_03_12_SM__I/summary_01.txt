And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on the upcoming court hearing. The judge is considering the opposition filed by the plaintiff, but will not consider any new evidence presented. The judge is uncertain about the deadline for filing a reply to the opposition, as it could be based on the notice of entry or the judgment date. The judge may allow a late-filed reply and will discuss the matter with counsel. The judge also questions why the fee motion is subject to jurisdiction and will discuss this with counsel. The judge will not consider any evidence in the opposition, except for the interest rate, which seems to be a question of law. The judge does not think that the opposition and reply are jurisdictional, but is unsure if the court can grant more time over objection.
