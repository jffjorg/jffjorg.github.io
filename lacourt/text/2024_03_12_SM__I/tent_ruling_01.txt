  Case Number:  20SMCP00231    Hearing Date:   March 12, 2024    Dept:  I The court is
inclined to consider the opposition (but not any new evidence contained
therein), but questions what happens to the reply.  If the 75 days runs from the notice of entry,
then April 13, 2024 would seem the cut off, meaning April 15.  But if the judgment date is the cut off, then
April 8 is the cut off.
The court
would not consider any evidence in the opposition, but the interest rate seems
to be a question of law.  Court might
allow a late-filed reply.  Unlike the
notice of intent, the court does not think the opposition and reply are
jurisdictional.  But it is not clear that
the court can grant more time over objection. 
The court will discuss it.
The court is
not sure why the fee motion is subject to the jurisdiction.  It would seem that this would be like fees in
any other case and the court is not sure why it is subject to the time
constraints plaintiff seems to think.
The court
will discuss that with counsel.
