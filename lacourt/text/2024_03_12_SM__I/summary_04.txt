And here is the English text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel further responses to interrogatories, requests for admission, and sanctions. The Judge notes that the plaintiff has not opposed the motion, and therefore, the propounding party need make no showing for interrogatories and requests for admissions. As a result, the motion to compel further responses to interrogatories is granted, and the plaintiff is required to serve complete, code-compliant, verified responses within 10 court days without objection. The requests for admission are deemed admitted unless responses were served prior to the hearing. Additionally, the Judge grants the request for sanctions and imposes a penalty of $1320 against the plaintiff, payable within 30 days.
