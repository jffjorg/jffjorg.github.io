And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is to vacate the current trial date due to the case not being ready for trial. The parties have requested a continuance to June 2024, and the Judge is considering this request. The Judge explains that the reason for the continuance is that Plaintiff's Counsel experienced a series of personal and family events that made it difficult for them to devote full time to the case, and Defense Counsel was involved in a capital murder case that was unexpectedly continued. The Judge appreciates the cooperation between the parties and is willing to work with them to set a new trial date. However, the Judge is unsure of its availability and may need to set a further status conference to determine a new trial date.
