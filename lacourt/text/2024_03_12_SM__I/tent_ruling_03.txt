 Case Number:  22STCV30200    Hearing Date:   March 12, 2024    Dept:  I This is a motion for terminating sanctions.  However, after the motion was filed, the
court had discussions with defense counsel. 
At this point, the court is not convinced that additional sanctions are
required.  The court believes that
defendants and defense counsel have committed to complying with discovery
obligations going forward.  Whatever
shortcomings might have taken place have been addressed in prior orders, and
the court does not believe more is necessary at this time.  Therefore, the motion is DENIED.
