And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

Judge Joel L. Lofton has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Rhonda Strauss and Mark Strauss v. Templar Titan, Inc. The Plaintiffs moved to compel further responses to their requests for production of documents, but the motion was denied. The Plaintiffs had served their requests on February 8, 2024, and Defendant provided objection-only responses on March 12, 2024. The Court found that the Plaintiffs' motion was actually a motion to compel further responses, which is allowed under California law. However, the Plaintiffs failed to include a separate statement with their motion, as required by California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1345. Therefore, the motion was denied. The Plaintiffs' requests for sanctions were also denied.
