RELIEF
REQUESTED 
 
             Plaintiffs move for an order
compelling Defendant to provide discovery responses to their requests for the production
of documents.
 
BACKGROUND
 
            This case arises from Plaintiffs
Rhonda Strauss and Mark Strauss’s (“Plaintiffs”) claim that Defendant Templar
Titan, Inc., unlawfully placed tracking devices on Plaintiffs’ vehicle.
Plaintiffs filed this complaint on May 5, 2021, alleging one cause of action
for invasion of privacy. 
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
Plaintiffs’ motion for an order compelling Defendant to provide
further responses to its requests for the production of documents is DENIED.
 
            Plaintiffs’
requests for sanction is denied. 
 
LEGAL STANDARD
 
            A party making a discovery request may move for an order compelling a
response if the party to whom the requests were made fails to serve a timely
response, including for special interrogatories (Code Civ. Proc. section
2030.290, subd. (b)) and requests for production (Code Civ. Proc. section
2031.300, subd (b)). A party must serve a response within 30 days after service
of a discovery request. (Code Civ. Proc. sections 2030.260, subd, (a) and
2031.260, subd.(a).)
 
DISCUSSION
 
Plaintiffs move to compel a response
to its requests for the production of documents. Plaintiffs provide they served
their requests for the production of documents on February 8, 2024. (Stearn
Decl. ¶ 1.) Plaintiffs provide that
on March 12, 2024, Defendant provided objection-only responses. (Id. ¶
4.) 
 
Plaintiffs classify their motion as one to compel an initial
response rather than one to compel a further response. However, in the court’s
view, this motion is a motion to compel further responses.
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.210, subdivision (a)(3),
provides that a party may respond to a demand for inspection with “[a]n
objection to the particular demand for inspection, copying, testing, or
sampling.” Further, a party may move for further responses on the
grounds that “[a]n objection in the response is without merit or too general.”
(Code Civ. Proc. section 2031.310, subd. (a)(3).) Because the relevant code
sections allow a party responding to a discovery response to object and a party
to compel further responses over those objections, the correct motion here is a
motion to compel further responses.
 
California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1345 requires a separate
statement to be included with a motion to compel further responses. A separate
statement is not attached to the present motion. Plaintiff’s motion is denied.
 
 
CONCLUSION
 
Plaintiffs’ motion for an order compelling Defendant to provide
further responses to its requests for the production of documents is DENIED.
 
            Plaintiffs’
requests for sanction is denied. 
 
            Moving
Party to give notice.
