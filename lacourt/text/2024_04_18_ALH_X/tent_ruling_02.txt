MOTION
FOR JUDGEMENT ON THE PLEADINGS

RESPONDING PARTY:      No
response filed. 
 
SERVICE:                              Filed November 16, 2024
 
RELIEF
REQUESTED 
 
             Plaintiff moves for judgment on
the pleadings. 
 
BACKGROUND
 
             This case arises out of Plaintiff Headway
Capital, LLC’s (“Plaintiff”) claim that Defendant breached a written guarantee
for a loan and owes an outstanding balance of $31,853.43. Plaintiff filed this
complaint on November 10, 2022. 
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
Plaintiff’s
motion for judgment on the pleadings is GRANTED.
 
DISCUSSION
 
            Plaintiff moves for judgment on the pleadings. Plaintiff provides that
the motion is proper because in Defendant’s answer, filed on December 23, 2022,
Defendant checked the box that provides that “Defendant admits that all of the
statements of the complaint or cross-complaint are true EXCEPT:” but failed to
state any allegations that he contends are false.
 
A plaintiff may
move for judgment on the pleadings on the grounds “that the
complaint states facts sufficient to constitute a cause or causes of action
against the defendant and the answer does not state facts sufficient to
constitute a defense to the complaint.” (Code Civ. Proc. section 438.) The grounds for
motion provided for in this section shall appear on the face of the
challenged pleading or from any matter of which the court is required to take
judicial notice.¿ (Code Civ. Proc. section 438(d).)¿The standard
for ruling on a motion for judgment on the pleadings is essentially the same as
that applicable to a general demurrer, that is, under the state of the
pleadings, together with matters that may be judicially noticed, it appears
that a party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. (Bezirdjian v.
O'Reilly (2010) 183 Cal.App.4th 316, 321-322 (citing Schabarum v.
California Legislature (1998) 60 Cal.App.4th 1205, 1216).)
 
            Defendant
has admitted to each allegation in Plaintiff’s complaint. Plaintiff alleges
that the parties entered into a written guarantee for a loan. (Complaint ¶ 7.) Plaintiff alleges that Defendant breached the agreement by
failing to make payments. (Id. ¶¶ 8-9.) Plaintiff alleges that it
performed all its obligations. (Id. ¶ 10.) Plaintiff alleges that it has
been damaged in the sum of $31,853.43. (Id. ¶ 11.) The face of Defendant’s answer demonstrates that Defendant
has failed to allege any defense or facts sufficient to constitute a defense to
the complaint. Plaintiff’s motion for judgment on the pleadings is granted.
 
CONCLUSION
 
Plaintiff’s
motion for judgment on the pleadings is GRANTED.
 
            Moving
Party to give notice.
