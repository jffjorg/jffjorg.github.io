complaint.
 
BACKGROUND
 
             This case arises out of Plaintiff Creditors
Adjustment Bureau, Inc.’s (“Plaintiff”) claim that Defendant Edgar J.
Guttierrez (“Defendant”) owes an outstanding sum of $16,505.58 for credit card
charges and $9,903.83 for a line of credit. Plaintiff filed this complaint on
September 11, 2023, alleging one cause of action for breach of contract.
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
Defendant’s demurrer to Plaintiff’s
complaint is OVERRULED.
 
Plaintiff’s request for sanction is
denied.
 
LEGAL STANDARD
 
A general
demurrer may be taken to a complaint where “[t]he pleading does not state facts sufficient to
constitute a cause of action.” (Code of Civ. Proc. § 430.10(e).) A demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the
complaint states a cause of action.  (Hahn
v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal. App. 4th 740, 747.) In a demurrer proceeding, the
defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading or by proper judicial
notice.  (Code Civ. Proc. section
430.30(a).)  A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or
other extrinsic matters.  (SKF Farms v. Superior Court (1984) 153
Cal. App. 3d 902, 905.)  The only issue involved in a demurrer hearing is
whether the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous matters,
states a cause of action.  (Hahn v.
Mirda, supra, 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.)
 
Additionally, a
special demurrer to a complaint may be brought on the ground the pleading is
uncertain, ambiguous, or unintelligible. Code Civ. Proc section 430.10(f); Beresford Neighborhood Assn. v. City of
San Mateo (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 1180, 1191.) A demurrer based
on uncertainty is disfavored and will be strictly construed even when the
pleading is uncertain in some respects. (Khoury v. Maly's of California, Inc. (1993) 14
Cal.App.4th 612, 616.) A demurrers based on uncertainty are “granted only if
the pleading is so incomprehensible that a defendant cannot reasonably
respond.” (Lickiss v. Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (2012) 208
Cal.App.4th 1125, 1135.) 
 
DISCUSSION
 
            Defendant
demurrers to Plaintiff on the grounds that Plaintiff has failed to plead
standing to this bring this claim. Defendant argues that Plaintiff failed to
sufficiently allege assignment of the contract to have standing. Defendant
argues that Plaintiff was required to provide the written instrument
establishing assignment.   
 
“[A] plaintiff may plead the legal
effect of the contract rather than its precise language.” (Miles v. Deutsche
Bank National Trust Co. (2015) 236 Cal.App.4th 394, 402.) Plaintiff alleges
that prior to the commencement of this action, it was assigned the claims for
collection purposes only. (Complaint ¶ 4.) Plaintiff provides its assignor was City National Bank. (Id.
¶ 1.) The court notes
that Plaintiff does not allege the specific date of assignment. At the pleading
stage, this is sufficient for Plaintiff to allege it has standing to bring this
claim for breach of contract. Similarly, Plaintiff’s complaint is not so
incomprehensible as to be uncertain.
 
Defendant’s demurrer to Plaintiff’s
complaint is overruled. 
 
CONCLUSION
 
Defendant’s demurrer to Plaintiff’s
complaint is OVERRULED.
 
Defendant is ordered to file an ANSWER
within 10 days’ notice of this order. 
 
Plaintiff’s request for sanction is
denied.
