English-text summary:

The tentative ruling denies plaintiff's motion to compel defendant's responses to special interrogatories and request for production of documents, as the motions were not properly prepared and the plaintiff failed to file separate statements. However, the court grants plaintiff's motion to compel defendant's further responses to the request for production of documents, as the defendant failed to provide code-compliant responses and waived objections. The court also awards plaintiff's request for sanctions in the amount of $3,060.00, payable within 30 days, and orders the defendant to provide code-compliant responses within 20 days.
