And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has made a tentative ruling in the case of Calderon, et al. v. FCA US LLC. The Plaintiffs' motion to deem their Requests for Admission admitted against the Defendant, FCA US LLC, has been denied. However, the Judge has granted the Plaintiffs' request for monetary sanctions against the Defendant and its counsel in the reduced amount of $981.65. This amount is due to the Defendant's failure to respond timely to the Plaintiffs' Requests for Admission and its subsequent provision of untimely responses. The Judge has determined that the Defendant's failure to respond was due to mistake, inadvertence, and excusable neglect, and that the Defendant has substantially complied with the Code of Civil Procedure. The Judge has also reduced the amount of sanctions due to the fact that the Plaintiffs did not file a reply to the Defendant's opposition.
