```
case_number: 24STCV13872
hearing_date: 2024-09-25
dept: 73
judge: Hon. Rolf Treu
parties:
  - Plaintiffs: AISPURO, et al.
  - Defendant: BEVERLY COMMUNITY HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION
counsel:
  - Plaintiffs: Stephen Garcia (Garcia & Artigliere)
  - Defendant: Rima Badawiya (Lewis Brisbois Bisgaard & Smith, LLP)
demurrer:
  - Defendant's demurrer to the Complaint's first cause of action is OVERULED
motion_to_strike:
  - Defendant's motion to strike portions of the Complaint is DENIED
background:
  - On June 4, 2024, Plaintiffs filed this action against Defendant Beverly Community Hospital Association
  - The Complaint alleges the following causes of action:
    - Elder Abuse
    - Negligence
    - Wrongful Death
issues:
  - Defendant argues that Plaintiffs' first cause of action for Statutory Elder Abuse/Neglect of a Dependent Adult fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action against Defendant and is uncertain
  - Defendant argues that Plaintiffs' prayer for damages regarding punitive and exemplary damages and treble damages conflicts with the terms of the Stipulation entered into between Plaintiffs' counsel and the Bankruptcy Trustee
  - Plaintiff argues that the restrictions on the enforcement of any final judgment by the Bankruptcy Court has no bearing on the sufficiency of pleading causes of action
  - Plaintiff argues that the Stipulation permits Plaintiff to proceed in the civil forum to final judgment, and appeal if necessary, in accordance with the applicable civil laws with no restrictions placed thereon
analysis:
  - The Court disagrees with Defendant's argument that Plaintiffs' first cause of action violates the Stipulation
  - The Court finds that the terms of the Stipulation appear to only restrict how any potential judgment obtained in the matter will be collected and does not modify the statutory and regularly available remedies
  - The Court notes that Defendant does not argue in its Motion that Plaintiffs fail to allege the requisite elements of its Statutory Elder Abuse/Neglect of a Dependent Adult cause of action
  - The Court finds that Defendant's demurrer to Plaintiffs' first cause of action is OVERRULED
  - The Court finds that Defendant's motion to strike portions of the Complaint is DENIED
```

* Defendant's motion to strike portions of the Complaint is DENIED.
* The Court disagrees with Defendant's argument that Plaintiffs' first cause of action violates the Stipulation entered into between Plaintiffs' counsel and the Bankruptcy Trustee.
* The Court finds that the terms of the Stipulation appear to only restrict how any potential judgment obtained in the matter will be collected and does not modify the statutory and regularly available remedies.
* The Court notes that Defendant does not argue in its Motion that Plaintiffs fail to allege the requisite elements of its Statutory Elder Abuse/Neglect of a Dependent Adult cause of action.
* The Court finds that Defendant's demurrer is based on the incorrect assumption that the Stipulation modifies the statutory and regularly available remedies, and that the Court will not address this issue.
