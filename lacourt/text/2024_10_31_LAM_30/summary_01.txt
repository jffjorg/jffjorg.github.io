Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Edgar Buniatyan (Plaintiff) v. Tesla Motors, Inc., et. al. (Defendant). The Plaintiff is seeking an award of attorney's fees and costs against the Defendant. The court has awarded the Plaintiff fees and costs in the amount of $13,071.26.

The court's decision is based on several factors, including the Song-Beverly Act, which allows a prevailing buyer to recover attorney's fees and costs. The court also considered the hourly rates and number of hours billed by the Plaintiff's counsel, as well as the complexity and difficulty of the case.

The court found that the hourly rates alleged by the Plaintiff's counsel were inconsistent, and adjusted the rates accordingly. The court also reduced the number of hours claimed by the Plaintiff's counsel for drafting documents and communicating with each other.

Finally, the court awarded a lodestar multiplier of 1.0, finding that a multiplier was not warranted in this case. The court's final award includes $12,478.75 in attorney's fees and $592.51 in costs.
