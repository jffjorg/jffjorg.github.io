Buniatyan vs. Tesla Motors,
Inc., et. al., Case No. 24STCV14633
Tentative Ruling
re:  Plaintiff’s Motion for Attorney’s
Fees 
Edgar Buniatyan (Plaintiff) moves for an award of
attorney’s fees and costs against Tesla Motors, Inc.
(Defendant). The Court awards Plaintiff
fees and costs of $13,071.26.
“[A]s a general rule, attorney fees
are not recoverable as costs unless they are authorized by statute or
agreement.” (People ex rel. Dept. of
Corporations v. Speedee Oil Change Systems, Inc. (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th
424, 429.) In a lemon law action, costs
and expenses, including attorney fees, may be recovered by a prevailing buyer
under the Song-Beverly Act. (Civ. Code, §§ 1790, et seq.) Specifically,
if the buyer prevails, they may recover “a sum equal to the aggregate amount of
costs and expenses, including attorney’s fees based on actual time expended, determined
by the court to have been reasonably incurred by the buyer in connection with
the commencement and prosecution of such action.” (Id., § 1794, subd.
(d).)
The
attorney bears the burden of proof as to “reasonableness” of any fee claim. (Id.,
§ 1033.5, subd. (c)(5).) This burden requires competent evidence as to the
nature and value of the services rendered. (Martino
v. Denevi (1986) 182 Cal.App.3d 553, 559.) “Testimony of an attorney as to
the number of hours worked on a particular case is sufficient evidence to
support an award of attorney fees, even in the absence of detailed time
records.” (Ibid.)  
A
plaintiff’s verified billing invoices are prima facie evidence that the costs,
expenses, and services listed were necessarily incurred. (Hadley v. Krepel (1985) 167 Cal.App.3d 677, 682.) “In challenging
attorney fees as excessive because too many hours of work are claimed, it is
the burden of the challenging party to point to the specific items challenged,
with a sufficient argument and citations to the evidence. General arguments
that fees claimed are excessive, duplicative, or unrelated do not suffice.” (Lunada Biomedical v. Nunez (2014) 230
Cal.App.4th 459, 488.) 
            In determining whether the requested
attorney’s fees are “reasonable,” the Court’s “first step involves the lodestar
figure—a calculation based on the number of hours reasonably expended
multiplied by the lawyer’s hourly rate. The lodestar figure may then be
adjusted, based on consideration of facts specific to the case, in order to fix
the fee at the fair market value for the legal services provided.” (Gorman v. Tassajara Development Corp.
(2008) 162 Cal.App.4th 770, 774.) In determining whether to adjust the lodestar
figure, the Court may consider the nature and difficulty of the litigation, the
amount of money involved, the skill required and employed to handle the case,
the attention given, the outcome, and other circumstances. (EnPalm LLC v. Teitler (2008) 162
Cal.App.4th 770, 774; PLCM Group, Inc. v.
Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095.)
 
The parties’ settlement agreement provides that Defendant shall pay
Plaintiff reasonably incurred attorney’s fees, costs, and expenses pursuant to
Civil Code section 1794, subdivision (d) as determined by the Court via noticed
motion. (Barahmand Decl. ¶ 5, Ex. A.) 
 
Defendant challenges the hourly rates alleged by Plaintiff’s counsel. Plaintiff
alleges an hourly rate of $375 for Attorney Navid Barahmand (Barahmand Decl. ¶
9), an hourly rate of $600 for Attorney Eli Banayan (Eli Decl. ¶¶ 8, 10,
14–15), and an hourly rate of $900 for Attorney Koorosh Banayan (Koorosh Decl.
¶¶ 8–9, 12). Fee rates are recoverable if they are “within the range of
reasonable rates charged by and judicially awarded comparable attorneys for
comparable work.” (Children’s Hospital & Medical Center v. Bonta
(2002) 97 Cal.App.4th 740, 783.) In calculating the lodestar rate, “the court
may rely on its own knowledge and familiarity with the legal market, as well as
the experience, skill, and reputation of the attorney requesting fees
[Citation], the difficulty or complexity of the litigation to which that skill
was applied [Citations], and affidavits from other attorneys regarding
prevailing fees in the community and rate determinations in other cases.
[Citation.]” (569 East County Boulevard LLC v. Backcountry
Against the Dump, Inc. (2016) 6
Cal.App.5th 426, 437.)
 
Here, the
rates alleged by Plaintiff’s counsel are inconsistent. Barahmand alleges a
reasonable hourly rate of $375. The Court finds a $600 or $900 hourly rate charged
in the same case unreasonable given the rate of $375 charged by a comparable
attorney. (Barahmand Decl. ¶ 9.) Given Eli’s and Koorosh’s greater levels of
experience, the Court applies an hourly rate of $450 and $500, respectively.
 
Defendant
also challenges the number of hours Plaintiff billed. First, Defendant points
to Plaintiff’s complaint and discovery requests as material created from a
template. Indeed, Plaintiff’s complaint is nearly identical to an earlier
complaint filed by the same attorney. (Hooper Decl. Exs. B1, B2.) Plaintiff’s
discovery requests are similarly generic. (Id. Ex. C.) Plaintiff alleges
the complaint took 4.1 total hours to draft and the discovery requests took 4.4
hours. While these billings do not reflect the drafting of documents from
scratch, given the few edits of templates required to produce these papers, the
hours claimed are unreasonable for attorneys claiming to have high levels of
experience. Thus, the Court will award fees for half of the alleged hours with
respect to these matters. 
 
Defendant
further challenges Plaintiff’s billing regarding communication between
Plaintiff’s various attorneys. Indeed, considering the high hourly rates and
levels of experience claimed by Barahmand, Eli, and Koorosh, a simple case such
as this did not require over 20 hours of communication time between attorneys
who could likely handle the case on their own. Thus, the Court will award fees
for half of these alleged hours as well.
 
Finally,
Defendant challenges Plaintiff’s requested lodestar multiplier of 1.1. A fee
multiplier may be warranted in cases taken on a contingency basis, based on the
elevated risk involved. (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1132.)
Other potential factors to consider when applying a multiplier include “(1) the
novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, (2) the skill displayed in
presenting them, [and] (3) the extent to which the nature of the litigation
precluded other employment by the attorneys.” (Ibid.) The Court finds
that a multiplier is not called for in this matter.
 
Defendant
does not contest the $2,000 in fees claimed by Plaintiff with respect to
drafting the present motion and reply.
 
Accordingly,
the Court awards $12,478.75 in attorney’s fees to Plaintiff (([$375 per hour
Barahmand] x [19.5 hours / 2]) + ([$450 per hour Eli] x [24.1 hours / 2]) +
([$500 per hour Koorosh] x [5.6 hours / 2]))  + [$2,000 present motion and reply] ).
(Barahmand Decl. ¶ 7–8; Eli Decl. ¶ 8; Koorosh Decl. ¶ 8.)
Costs are
awarded in the amount of $592.51.
