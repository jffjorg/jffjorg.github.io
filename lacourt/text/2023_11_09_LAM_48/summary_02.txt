And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled to sustain the demurrer to the First Amended Cross-Complaint filed by Aguila against Cross-Defendants. The judge found that the FACC does not state a claim for tortious interference with contract because Aguila did not allege that Cross-Defendants knew of his contract with RDS, and the allegations of actual knowledge and interference are insufficient. The judge also found that Aguila did not own the property, so it is unclear how the owners' demolition of their own property interfered with Aguila's rights. Additionally, the judge found that Aguila did not allege how Cross-Defendants' demolition in fact interfered with his contract with RDS. The judge has given Aguila 30 days to amend the FACC.
