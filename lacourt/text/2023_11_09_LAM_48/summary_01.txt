And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted in part the plaintiff's motion to quash the defendant's deposition subpoena for business records. The defendant's subpoena is overbroad and violates the court's protective order, which was issued on March 13, 2023. The court has modified the subpoena to limit the production of records to those related to the plaintiff's claimed injuries and from after September 2019. The court has also denied the plaintiff's request for sanctions, as the defendant had a legitimate discovery interest in the plaintiff's medical records. The court notes that this subpoena, motion, and outcome are similar to those in the plaintiff's November 7, 2023 motions, and suggests that the parties may wish to meet and confer and stipulate to the resolution and take the motions off calendar.
