Summary of the Tentative Ruling:

The Court has tentatively ruled to grant the unopposed motion to consolidate two related cases, Case Nos. 22STCV28077 and 22STLC06776. The cases involve Green Court Investors, LP, Infinity Plumbing Inc., Marco Marquez, Maria Carmen Marquez, and other parties in a dispute over a copper re-piping contract. The Court finds that there are common questions of law and fact between the two cases, and consolidation would enhance trial court efficiency by avoiding unnecessary duplication of evidence and the danger of inconsistent adjudications. The Court orders that Case No. 22STCV28077 be the lead case, and all future pleadings must be filed under this case number.
