And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge Thomas D. Long in the case of Theresa Kang vs. New Rez, LLC et al. (Case No. 23STCV07794). Tony Cara, counsel for plaintiff Theresa Kang, has filed a motion to be relieved as counsel due to the compromised attorney-client relationship, the plaintiff's uncooperativeness, and the difficulty in carrying out representation effectively. Since no party opposed the motion, the court grants the motion and orders that counsel be relieved as of the filing of a proof of service showing service of the order on all parties. The court notes that there is no prejudice to the plaintiff, as the trial has not yet been scheduled.
