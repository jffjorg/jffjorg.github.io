Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling granting the Union's anti-SLAPP motion and striking the fourth and fifth causes of action against the Union. The Union's petitioning activity, including contacting City officials, speaking at a Commission meeting, and staging protests outside the restaurant, is protected speech under the Noerr-Pennington doctrine. The court finds that the Union's activity was not a sham and was intended to influence City officials, rather than to extort or intimidate the plaintiff. The court also finds that the plaintiff has not shown a probability of prevailing on the merits of its interference claims. The Union is awarded its attorney fees and costs incurred in bringing the motion.
