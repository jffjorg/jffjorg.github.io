Defendant’s
motion to tax is GRANTED IN PART, DENIED IN PART. The Court taxes a total of $57,410.53 from
Plaintiff’s claimed costs. 
 
On 11/4/2015, Plaintiff Cynthia Lopez filed suit against
Kenneth Lopez. Plaintiff’s first amended complaint (FAC) alleges causes of
action for: (1) defamation-libel; (2) defamation-slander; (3) intentional
infliction of emotional distress; (4) negligent infliction of emotional
distress; (5) malicious prosecution; (6) abuse of process; and (7) injunctive
relief.
 
            Now,
Defendant moves to tax costs.
 
Discussion 
 
            Defendant
seeks an order taxing the following cots:
 
-         
Item 1: Filing fees totaling $5,007.88.
Defendant argues that these should be reduced to $850, and should be equitably
reduced further.
 
-         
Item 4: Deposition transcripts totaling
$66,155.87. Defendant requests that the Court disallow the entire amount.
 
-         
Item 5: Service of Process Fees
totaling $8,510.00 Defendant requests that the Court disallow the entire
amount.
 
-         
Item 8: Witness Fees totaling
$653.20.  Defendant requests that the
Court disallow the entire amount.
 
-         
Item 9: Court-ordered transcript costs
totaling $3,771.75. Defendant requests that the Court disallow the entire
amount.
 
-         
Item 11: Court reporter costs totaling
$11,669.76. Defendant requests that the Court disallow the entire amount.
 
-         
Item 12: Models, enlargements, and
photocopies of exhibits costs totaling $5,388.56. Defendant requests that the
Court disallow the entire amount.
 
-         
Item 14: $6,571.20 in electronic filing
fees. Defendant requests that the Court disallow the entire amount.
 
-         
Item 16: $34,250.42 in “other” costs.
Defendant requests that the Court disallow the entire amount.
 
Plaintiff was
the prevailing party in this action, and thus is entitled to recover costs as a
matter of right. Plaintiff was awarded damages for each claim, totaling
$466,500.00. As such, Plaintiff was the party with net recovery. (CCP §
1032(a)(4).) Plaintiff also meets the definition of a “prevailing party” as a Cross-Defendant
under Code of Civil Procedure sections 1032(a)(2) and §1(a)(4), as “a defendant
in whose favor a dismissal is entered.” The Court disagrees with Defendant’s
contention that Plaintiff is not the prevailing party in this action.
 
The Court
previously continued this matter, and directed Plaintiff to file supplemental
materials to better identify the costs being claimed, and to organize the
documents to support those costs.
 
After review,
the Court finds Plaintiff to have corroborated her costs as follows. 
 
As to Item 1
and 14, Plaintiff submitted documents which show costs totaling $10,498.1 in
fees. (See Lopez Decl., Exhs. 3, 14,15.) Plaintiff’s Memorandum claimed $11,579.08 in fees for Items 1 and 14
($6,571.20 + $5,007.88). Accordingly, the Court taxes the difference of
$1,080.98. 
 
As for Item 4, Plaintiff submitted documentation which
shows $36,915.36 in deposition costs.  Given
that Plaintiff’s Memorandum claims $66,155.87, the Court taxes the difference
of $29,240.51. 
 
As for Item 5, Plaintiff submitted documents which total
only $5,182.33. Given
that Plaintiff’s Memorandum claims $8,510, the Court taxes the difference of $3,327.67. 
             

            As for Item 8, Plaintiff submitted
documentation which shows $2,152.09 incurred. Given that Plaintiff only claimed
$653.20, the Court does not tax this amount. 
 
            As
for Item 9, Plaintiff submitted documentation which shows $3,771.75
incurred. Accordingly, the Court does not tax this amount. 
            
As for Item
11, Plaintiff submitted
documentation which shows $13,100.81. incurred. Given that Plaintiff only
claimed $11,669.76, the Court does not tax this
amount. 
 
            As
for Item 12, Plaintiff
submitted documentation which shows $5,397.26 incurred. Given that Plaintiff only
claimed $5,388.56, the Court does not tax this
amount. 
 
            As for Item 16, Plaintiff did not submit any supplemental
documentation, nor did she reorganize Exhibits previously submitted. The Court
finds support only for $10,489.05 in claimed costs. Given that Plaintiff
claimed $34,250.42
in costs, the Court taxes the difference of $23,761.37.
 
            Based on the foregoing, Defendant’s motion to tax is
granted in part, denied in part. The Court taxes a total of $57,410.53.
 
                        
It is so
ordered.
