The court has reviewed the plaintiff's claimed costs and has taxed a total of $57,410.53. The court has disallowed certain costs claimed by the plaintiff, including deposition transcripts, service of process fees, and witness fees, and has taxed the difference between the claimed amount and the supported amount. The court has also found that the plaintiff did not provide sufficient documentation to support certain costs claimed, including electronic filing fees and "other" costs. The court has granted the defendant's motion to tax in part and denied it in part.
