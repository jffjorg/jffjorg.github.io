BACKGROUND
            On March 20, 2024, plaintiffs Rigoberto
Perez and Laura Perez (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against defendant
American Honda Motor Company, Inc. (“Defendant”), alleging the following causes
of action: (1) violation of subdivision (d) of Civil Code § 1793.2; (2) violation
of subdivision (b) of Civil Code § 1793.2; (3) violation of subdivision (a)(3)
of Civil Code § 1793.2; (4) breach of the implied warranty of merchantability;
and (5) fraudulent inducement – concealment.
            The complaint alleges that, on August
8, 2021, Plaintiff purchased a 2021 Honda Pilot which was manufactured and or
distributed by Defendant. (Compl. ¶ 6.) A written warranty accompanied the sale
of the subject vehicle. (Id. at ¶ 7, Exh. A.) It is further alleged that
the subject vehicle possessed a “sensing defect” that were covered by the
warranty and substantially impaired the subject vehicle’s use, value and
safety. (Id. at ¶¶ 11-12. 57.) Defendant is alleged to have concealed
this “sensing defect” prior to Plaintiff’s purchase of the subject vehicle. (Id.
at ¶ 64.)
            Now, Defendants move to dismiss the
fifth cause of action in the complaint as well as the prayer for punitive damages.
Plaintiff opposes. 
 
LEGAL AUTHORITY
A.   
Judgment
on the Pleadings
      “The
grounds for a motion for judgment on the pleadings must appear on the face of
the complaint or from a matter of which the court may take judicial notice.” (Richardson-Tunnell
v. School Ins. Program for Employees (2007) 157 Cal.App. 4th
1056, 1061, disapproved on other grounds by Quigley v. Garden Valley Fire
Prot. Dist. (2019) 7 Cal. 5th 798, 815 n.8. Accord  Bufil v. Dollar Financial Group, Inc. (2008) 162 Cal.App.4th
1193, 1202,  disapproved on other
grounds by Noel v. Thrifty Payless, Inc. (2019) 7 Cal. 5th 955, 986;
Saltarelli & Steponovich v. Douglas (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th
1, 5.) 
      A motion
for judgment on the pleadings involves the same type of procedures that apply
to a general demurrer. (Richardson-Tunnell v. School Ins. Program for
Employees (2007) 157 Cal.App. 4th 1056, 1061,  disapproved on other grounds by  Quigley v. Garden Valley Fire Prot. Dist.
(2019) 7 Cal. 5th 798, 815 n.8; Burnett v. Chimney Sweep (2004) 123 Cal.
App. 4th 1057, 1064.) In considering a motion for judgment on the pleadings,
courts consider whether properly pled factual allegations, assumed to be true
and liberally construed, are sufficient to constitute a cause of action. (Stone
Street Capital, LLC v. Cal. State Lottery Com'n (2008) 165 Cal.App.4th 109,
116; Fire Ins. Exchange v. Sup. Ct. (2004) 116 Cal. App. 4th 446,
452-53.) A motion for judgment on the pleadings does not lie as to only part
of a cause of action. (Fire Ins. Exch. v. Sup. Ct. (2004) 116
Cal.App.4th 446, 452.) “[A] motion for judgment on the pleadings performs the
office of a general, not a special, demurrer...” Fabbro v. Dardi & Co.
(1949) 93 Cal. App. 2d 247, 252.)
 
B.    
Motion
to Strike
The court may, upon a motion, or at
any time in its discretion, and upon terms it deems proper, strike any
irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading. (Code Civ.
Proc. § 436(a).) The court may also strike all or any part of any pleading not
drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of this state, a court rule, or an
order of the court. (Code Civ. Proc. § 436(b).) The grounds for moving to
strike must appear on the face of the pleading or from any matter of which the
court is required to take judicial notice. (Code Civ. Proc. § 437.)
 
DISCUSSION
            As
a preliminary matter, the Court finds that the Defendant has complied with the
meet and confer requirement pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure §§ 430.41 and
435.5. (Hernandez Decls. at ¶ 2.)
A.    MOTION FOR JUDGMENT ON THE
PLEADINGS
Defendant argues that the fifth
cause of action is subject to a motion for judgment on the pleadings because it
has not been pleaded with the requisite specificity. (MJOP at pp. 16-19.) In
particular, Defendant argues that the sufficient facts have not been alleged
that Defendant had exclusive knowledge of the alleged defect or that the
parties had a direct transaction to trigger a duty to disclose the alleged
defect. 
To state a
claim for fraudulent inducement-concealment, a plaintiff must allege: (1) the
defendant “concealed or suppressed a material fact,” (2) the defendant was
“under a duty to disclose the fact to the plaintiff,” (3) the defendant
“intentionally concealed or suppressed the fact with the intent to defraud the
plaintiff,” (4) the plaintiff was “unaware of the fact and would not have acted
as he did if he had known of the concealed or suppressed fact,” and (5) “as a
result of the concealment or suppression of the fact, the plaintiff must have
sustained damage.” (Bigler-Engler v. Breg, Inc. (2017) 7 Cal.App.5th
276, 310–11.)  
Absent a
fiduciary relationship between the parties, a duty to disclose can arise in
only three circumstances: (1) the defendant had exclusive knowledge of the
material fact; (2) the defendant actively concealed the material fact; or (3)
the defendant made partial representations while also suppressing the material
fact. (Bigler-Engler, supra, 7 Cal.App.5th at 311; LiMandri v.
Judkins (1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 326, 336.) Such circumstances “presuppose[ ] the existence of
some other relationship between the plaintiff and defendant in which a duty to
disclose can arise.” (LiMandri, supra, 52
Cal.App.4th at p. 337.)
The California Supreme Court “has described the necessary relationship
giving rise to a duty to disclose as a ‘transaction’ between the plaintiff and
defendant ….” (Bigler-Engler, supra, 7 Cal.App.5th at p. 311; Warner
Construction Corp. v. City of Los Angeles (1970) 2 Cal.3d 285, 294 [“In
transactions which do not involve fiduciary or confidential relations”]; Hoffman
v. 162 North Wolfe LLC (2014) 228 Cal.App.4th 1178, 1187–89 [rejecting
concealment claim where plaintiffs “were not involved in a transaction with the
parties they claim defrauded them”]; LiMandri, supra, 52 Cal.App.4th at
p. 337 [“such a relationship can only come into being as a result of some sort
of transaction between the parties”].) 
Defendant contends that it did not
have exclusive knowledge of the alleged defect because it is alleged that this
alleged defect was publicly disclosed through the NHTSA and there was no direct
transaction between the parties. (Demurrer at pg. 6.) In this regard, Defendant
argues that sufficient facts have not been alleged to suggest that Defendant’s
authorized dealerships are its agents for the purpose of selling cares. (Id.
at pg. 7.) Moreover, Defendant asserts that the express warranty does not
create a duty to disclose because it is not part of the sale contract. (Id.
at pg. 6, relying on Ford Motor Warranty Cases (2023) 89 Cal.App.5th 1324 611,
619-620.)
In opposition, Plaintiff maintains
that the fifth cause of action has been sufficiently alleged and reasons that a
transaction relationship is not required under California law for the
manufacturer to have a duty to disclose. Regardless, Plaintiff asserts that for
pleading purposes, her allegations are sufficient to establish a transactional
relationship. (Opposition at pg. 7, relying on Dhital v. Nissan North
America (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 828.)
The
plaintiffs in Dhital sued Nissan for Song-Beverly violations. They
alleged the transmission was faulty and unreliable, and that it placed them at
risk for an accident though they did not allege they had actually been injured.
The pleading included a claim for fraudulent inducement. Plaintiffs alleged
that Nissan concealed defects it had a duty to disclose in order to induce the
purchase. The trial court sustained Nissan’s demurrer to the fraudulent
inducement cause of action on the basis that it was barred by the economic loss
doctrine. Within its decision reversing the lower court’s decision, the
appellate court found that: 
 
“[a]t the pleading stage (and in the absence of a
more developed argument by Nissan on this point), we conclude Plaintiff’s
allegations are sufficient. Plaintiff alleged that they bought the car from a
Nissan dealership, that Nissan backed the car with an express warranty, and
that Nissan’s authorized dealerships are its agents for purposes of the sale of
Nissan vehicles to consumers. In light of these allegations, we decline to hold
Plaintiff’s claim is barred on the ground there was no relationship requiring
Nissan to disclose known defects.”
 
(Dhital, supra, 84 Cal.App.5th at pp.
727-729.)
However, other
courts have called into question Dhital’s presumption of a transactional
relationship between the parties.  Antonov
v. General Motors LLC (C.D. Cal., Jan. 19, 2024, No. 823CV01593FWSMJR) 2024
WL 217825, at *11 (“[I]n Dhital the California Court of Appeal conducted
limited substantive analysis of the plaintiffs' transactional relationship
allegations due to the defendant's failure to fully brief the argument” making
the conclusion that there was a transaction unconvincing.”)  Defendant here has set forth a satisfactory
argument as to why it should not be summarily presumed that an agency
relationship existed between Defendant and the dealership that sold the subject
vehicle to Plaintiff. “[A] dealer or retailer may in a layman's view be an agent
of the [manufacturer], but he is not an agent in the legal sense of that
relationship.” (Avalon Painting Co. v. Alert Lumber Co. (1965) 234
Cal.App.2d 178, 184; see also Herremans v. BMW of N. Am., LLC, No.
(C.D.Cal. 2014) 2014 WL 5017843, at *6 [“[t]he relationship between automobile
manufacturers and their dealers has been examined by a host of courts
throughout the country, all of which have agreed that dealers are not ‘agents’
of manufacturers.”].) Plaintiff’s complaint does not allege that Defendant’s
authorized dealerships are its agents. Critically, “fraud must be pleaded specifically; general and conclusory allegations do
not suffice.” (Lazar v. Superior Court (1996) 12 Cal.4th 631, 645.)
Thus, without sufficiently alleging the existence of a transactional
relationship, the complaint fails to sufficiently allege the existence of a
duty.
Further, Plaintiff’s own complaint undermines the assertion that the
information regarding the “sensing defect” was solely in the possession of
Defendant.  In Paragraph 63 of the
complaint, Plaintiff sets forth a series of complaints about the “sensing
defects” in Honda vehicles which were publicly available between March 9, 2017
and April 17, 2020, all of which were posted prior to Plaintiff’s purchase of
the subject vehicle.
Accordingly, because the complaint
does not sufficiently allege a direct transaction between the parties, the
fifth cause of action for fraudulent concealment has not been sufficiently
alleged. Because Plaintiff’s own complaint makes clear that information
regarding the existence of the “sensing defect” was available to the public
prior to Plaintiff’s purchase of the vehicle, the court finds that there is no
possibility of successful amendment.  For
the sake of judicial economy, the court declines to address Defendant’s
remaining argument regarding preemption. 
B.     MOTION TO STRIKE
Because Defendant’s Motion for
Judgment on the Pleadings has been granted as to the fifth cause of action, and
the motion to strike attacks the punitive damages that would flow only from
that cause of action, it is GRANTED.
 
CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, the motion
for judgment on the pleadings is GRANTED and the motion to strike is GRANTED without
leave to amend.
