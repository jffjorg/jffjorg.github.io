Summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge on a motion for judgment on the pleadings and a motion to strike filed by American Honda Motor Company, Inc. (Defendant) against Rigoberto Perez and Laura Perez (Plaintiffs). The Defendant argues that the fifth cause of action for fraudulent concealment has not been sufficiently alleged because it does not demonstrate a direct transaction between the parties. The judge agrees, finding that the complaint does not sufficiently allege a transactional relationship between the parties and that the information regarding the "sensing defect" was publicly available prior to the plaintiff's purchase of the vehicle. As a result, the motion for judgment on the pleadings is granted and the motion to strike is granted without leave to amend.
