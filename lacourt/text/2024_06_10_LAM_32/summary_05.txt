English-text summary:

The Tentative Ruling is about a dispute over a default judgment entered against Defendant Christopher Stone. The Plaintiff, Alyssa Backlund, filed a complaint against the Defendants, Elite Imaging Concepts, LLC, and Christopher Stone, alleging various causes of action, including defamation, false light, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. The Court finds that the CCP § 425.11 statement was properly served on the Defendants, and the default judgment was properly entered. The Court also finds that the award of punitive damages is consistent with the holding in State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co. v. Campbell (2003) 538 U.S. 408, 410. The Court denies the Defendant's motion to vacate the renewal of the judgment.
