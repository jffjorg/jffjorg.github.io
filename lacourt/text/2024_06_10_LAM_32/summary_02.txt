And here is the English-text summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The court has granted the plaintiff's motion for leave to file a second amended complaint. The plaintiff seeks to add causes of action for Disability Discrimination, Disability Harassment, Retaliation, and Failure to Prevent Discrimination under the Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA). The defendants opposed the motion, arguing that it would be prejudicial. However, the court disagrees, finding that the defendants have had nearly a year to prepare for the additional claims and that there is still time for discovery and/or motions. The court is inclined to grant the motion, subject to the defendants' opportunity to conduct discovery and/or motions, and the court's willingness to grant a brief continuance of the trial if necessary.
