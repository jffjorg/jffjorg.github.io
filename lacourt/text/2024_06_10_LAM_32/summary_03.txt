  - "Absent such statement, defendant lacks notice of the actual liability threatened, so that any default judgment is void."
  - "The court finds that the CCP ยง 425.11 statement served on Defendants was proper, and the CCP ยง 425.11 statement informed Defendants of the nature and the amount of damages being sought."
```

And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to vacate the renewal of judgment. The defendant had argued that the complaint did not specify damages sought, and therefore, the defendant was not properly served with a statement of damages prior to the default judgment. The judge found that the complaint does contain causes of action for personal injury, including defamation, false light, and intentional infliction of emotional distress, and therefore, the defendant was properly served with a statement of damages. The judge also found that the default judgment was proper and did not violate due process.
