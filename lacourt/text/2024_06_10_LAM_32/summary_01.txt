And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion for leave to file a second amended complaint. The plaintiff seeks to add paragraphs to the complaint in support of their legal malpractice claim against the defendants. The defendants opposed the motion, arguing that the plaintiff has already been held liable and is attempting to shift blame. However, the judge found that the defendants failed to show prejudice, which is the primary factor in denying leave to amend. As a result, the judge is granting the plaintiff's motion and ordering the plaintiff to file their second amended complaint within 5 days. The trial has been continued to May 27, 2025, and the Final Status Conference has been continued to May 15, 2025.
