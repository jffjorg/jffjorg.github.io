     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
plaintiffs’ motion for leave to file Second
  amended complaint 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On May 4, 2021, Plaintiffs ZEIN E.
OBAGI, JR., an individual; and
OBAGI
LAW GROUP, P.C., a California law corporation (“Obagi”) filed this action
against Defendants BYRON SPENCER HOLLINS, an individual; HOLLINS &
ASSOCIATES;
MICHAEL
M. LEVIN, an individual. 
On September 21, 2021, Obagi filed its
first amended complaint.
On October 6, 2021, dismissed defendant
Levin. 
Plaintiff is an attorney who was sued by a
former client in an underlying case (the “Dominguez Action”). Plaintiff was
held liable for, among other things, failure to notify his former client
Dominguez of receipt of settlement funds, failure to render accounts for client
funds, failure to maintain client funds in trust, and breach of fiduciary duty.
Plaintiff’s claim against the Hollins
Defendants arises from the Hollins firm’s alleged failure to adequately
represent Plaintiff in the Dominguez Action.
Plaintiff now seeks leave to amend his
complaint to accomplish the following: (1) allege more specific facts regarding
the Hollins Defendants’ failure to adequately represent Plaintiff; (2) remove allegations
concerning Levin; and (3) correct Plaintiffs’ true name (See Motion 2-3.) 
            On May 9, 2024, Plaintiffs filed the
instant motion for leave to file a second amended complaint. Defendants filed their
opposition on May 28, 2024.  Plaintiffs
filed their reply on June 3, 2024.
LEGAL STANDARD
The court may, in the furtherance of
justice, and on such terms as may be proper, allow a party to amend any
pleading. (Code Civ. Proc, §§ 473, subd. (a), 576.) Courts must apply a policy
of liberality in permitting amendments at any stage of the proceeding,
including during trial, when no prejudice to the opposing party is shown. (Duchrow
v. Forrest (2013) 215 Cal.App.4th 1359, 1377.) In determining the extent of
prejudice to the opposing party, the court must consider various factors, such
as whether the amendment would delay trial or increase the discovery burden. (Demetriades
v. Yelp, Inc. (2014) 228 Cal.App.4th 294, 306.)
A motion for leave to amend a complaint
must be accompanied by a declaration that explains: (1) the effect of the
amendment; (2) why the amendment is necessary and proper; (3) when the facts
giving rise to the amended allegations were discovered; and (4) the reasons why
the request for amendment was not made earlier. (Cal. Rules of Ct., Rule
3.1324(b).)
DISCUSSION
Plaintiffs seek to add paragraphs to the complaint
in support of Plaintiffs’ legal malpractice claim against Defendants.  
            Defendants’ oppositions mainly
center around the argument that Plaintiff has already been held liable in the
underlying action and is merely attempting to shift blame onto others or raise
defenses against the pending State Bar action. These arguments are not
pertinent to the instant motion.
            Defendant’s opposition fails to show
prejudice, which is the primary factor in denying leave to amend. (See Duchrow,
supra, 215 Cal.App.4th at p. 1377 [amendments are liberally granted absent
prejudice to the opposing party].) As such, the the Court is disinclined to
deny Plaintiff leave to amend. Defendants retain the opportunity to demur or
move to strike after Plaintiff files an amended pleading.
CONCLUSION
            Plaintiffs’ motion for leave to file
a second amended complaint is GRANTED.   Plaintiff shall file their second amended
complaint within 5 days of this order. 
Trial is continued to May 27, 2025, and Final Status Conference is continued
to May 15, 2025.
