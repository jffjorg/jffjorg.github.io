And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in a product liability action brought by Fernando Barajas-Salomon against 101 Granite Countertop LLC and Best-Way Marble and Tile Co., Inc. The plaintiff alleges that he developed lung disease and is at increased risk of developing other silica-related diseases due to his exposure to silica-containing stone products during his occupation.

The court has granted the defendants' motion to quash service of summons, finding that the court lacks personal jurisdiction over the defendants. The court has also granted the defendants' demurrer, finding that the plaintiff's complaint does not state a cause of action for punitive damages.

The court has denied the defendants' motion to strike the plaintiff's complaint, finding that the complaint adequately pleads the fraudulent concealment claim. The court has stricken a "catch-all" allegation in the complaint that would have allowed the plaintiff to base liability on any number of unidentified products.

The court's tentative ruling is subject to change pending the parties' objections and the court's final determination.
