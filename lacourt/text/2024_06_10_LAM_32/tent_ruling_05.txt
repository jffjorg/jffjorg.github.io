[TENTATIVE] order RE:
motion to vacate renewal of judgment by
  default pursuant to ccp section 683.170 



            
BACKGROUND
            Plaintiff filed a Complaint for (1)
Defamation; (2) False Light; (3) Public Disclosure of
Facts; (4) Abuse of
Process; (5) Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress; and (6) Violation of
Business and
Professions Code § 17200 et seq. against the Defendants Christopher Stone and
Elite Imaging Concepts, LLC on November 19, 2010.   (Decl. Mermelstein
Ex. 1)

            On May 18, 2011, Defendants filed
their answer to the Complaint.
            On April 24, 2013, Defendants’ attorney
filed a Substitution of Attorney stating that Attorney Syverson would be
withdrawing as Defendants’ counsel, and Defendant Christopher Stone would be
acting in pro per. Christopher Stone, as the new legal representative, listed
his address on this Substitution of Attorney as P.O. Box 2088, Los Angeles, CA
90078.  (Decl. Mermelstein Ex. 3)
            On June 6, 2013, Plaintiff filed her
Statement of Damages which outlined all damages sought against Defendant
Christopher Stone.  (Decl. Mermelstein
Ex. 6)
            On Jund 6, 2013, the Trial Court
held a hearing on an Order to Show Cause re Contempt/Sanctions/Striking of the
Answer against Defendant Christopher Stone and on the Plaintiff’s Motion to
Strike Answer of Defendant Christopher Stone. The Court ruled in a Minute Order
dated June 6, 2013, that the Plaintiff’s Motion to Strike Answer of Defendant
Christopher Stone was to be granted, no appearance was made by Defendant
Christopher Stone, and a hearing on an Order to Show Cause re Default and/or
Default Judgment was to be placed on calendar for July 8, 2008. (Decl. Mermelstein
Ex. 5)
            On June 26, 2013, Plaintiff served Defendant
Christopher Stone with the Statement of Damages via mail to the address
provided by Christopher Stone in the substitution of attorney. (Decl. Mermelstein
Ex. 7)
            In a July 8, 2013, minute order, the
court ruled that the Order to Show Cause re Default and/or Default Judgment was
continued to September 6, 2013.
On August 7, 2013, Plaintiff filed and served notice to Defendant of the
September 6, 2013, hearing re Default and/or Default Judgment. (Decl. Mermelstein
Ex. 8)
            Plaintiff filed a Request for Entry
of Default Judgment against Defendant Christopher Stone on August 28, 2023, and
provided mail service to Christopher Stone at the address designated by him in
the Substitution of Attorney. (Decl. Mermelstein Ex. 9)
            Plaintiff obtained a Judgment by
Default against Defendant Christopher Stone awarding
Plaintiff General
Damages in the amount of $500,000.00, Special Damages in the amount of
$320.00, Punitive
Damages in the amount of $500,000, Attorney Fees in the amount of $125,528.00 and
Costs in the amount of $3,003.17. This Judgment was entered into this action on
December 11, 2013 by the Plaintiff. (Decl. Mermelstein Ex. 15)
On November 28, 2023, Plaintiff timely filed an Application For and
Renewal of Judgment and Memorandum of Costs after Judgment with the Court in

Renewal of Judgment and
Application for and
Renewal of Judgment on January 15, 2024. (Decl. Mermelstein Ex. 18)
            On March 12, 2024, Defendant
Christopher Stone timely filed a Motion to Vacate Renewal of Judgment by Default
Pursuant to CCP Section 683.170.
DISCUSSION
In personal injury and wrongful death actions, the complaint must not
state the amount of damages sought (CCP § 425.10).   Therefore, before a default may be entered,
plaintiff must serve defendant with a statement of “the nature and amount of
damages being sought.” (CCP § 425.11(b), (c); see Hamm v. Elkin (1987)
196 CA3d 1343, 1345-1346 [service after default entry but before prove-up not
sufficient.])    If defendant has
appeared in the lawsuit, the notice may be served by mail on defendant's
attorney of record or on defendant if in pro per. [CCP § 425.11(d)(2)] 

The purpose of a CCP § 425.11 statement prior to default is to give
defendant “one last chance” to respond, knowing exactly what judgment may be
entered if he or she fails to appear. Absent such statement, defendant lacks
notice of the actual liability threatened, so that any default judgment is
void. (Stevenson v. Turner (1979) 94 CA3d 315, 319; Janssen v. Luu
(1997) 57 CA4th 272, 275.)       A CCP § 425.11 statement is required for
entry of default where an answer has been filed but is later ordered stricken
as a discovery sanction. Due process requires such notice “whether [defendants]
default by inaction or by wilful obstruction” of discovery. (Greenup v.
Rodman (1986) 42 C3d 822, 829; Morgan v. Southern Calif. Rapid Transit
Dist. (1987) 192 CA3d 976, 985.)
In the present case, Defendants contend that they were not properly
served.   As stated above, Defendants answered the
complaint on May 18, 2011, and Defendants were served with the CCP § 425.11 statement
by mail on June 26, 2013, prior to the default being entered against
Defendants.  Pursuant to CCP §
425.11(d)(2), if defendant has appeared in the lawsuit, the notice may be
served by mail on defendant's attorney of record or on defendant if in pro per.
As such, the Court finds that Defendants were properly served with the CCP §
425.11 statement.
In the present case, Defendant contends that plaintiff’s complaint does
not include a cause of action for personal injury, and as such, the CCP §
425.11 statement fails to provide for
the formal notice
required before plaintiffs may obtain compensatory damages exceeding
the amount requested
in the complaint.
            Contrary to Defendants’ assertions,
the court finds that Plaintiff’s complaint contains personal injury cause of
action.  Plaintiff’s Complaint asserts causes
of action for (1) Defamation; (2) False Light; (3) Public Disclosure of Facts;
(4) Abuse of Process; (5) Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress; and (6)
Violation of Business and Professions Code § 17200 et seq. against the
Defendants.  The cause of action of defamation
is understood as a personal injury claim. 
(See, O'Hara v. Storer Communications, Inc. (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d
1101, 1118.)  Also, the cause of action
for intentional infliction of emotional damage constitutes a claim of
personal injury
against the Defendants. (See, Globe Internat, Inc. v. Superior Court
(1992) 9
Cal.App.4th 393,
398–399.)  Finally, the causes of action
for false light and public disclosure of private facts constitute a claim for personal
injury against the Defendants.  (See,  O'Hilderbrandt v. Columbia Broadcasting
System, Inc. (1974) 40 Cal.App.3d 323, 329.)  
             
            Based upon the foregoing the court
finds that the CCP § 425.11 statement served on Defendants was proper, and the CCP
§ 425.11 statement informed Defendants of the nature and the amount of damages
being sought.
             In the present case, Defendant contends that punitive
damages must be vacated  because the “complaint
fails to specify any damages whatsoever—no compensatory damages, no general
damages and no special damages.”  (Defendants’
Motion p. 8)  The court finds that the judgment
properly awarded compensatory damages to Plaintiff and that the award of
punitive damages are consistent with the holding in State Farm Mut.
Automobile Ins. Co. v. Campbell (2003) 538 U.S. 408, 410.
            In the present case, Defendant contends
that Plaintiff’s attorneys’ fees and costs must be vacated because all damages
shall be void. As set forth above, the damages awarded by the court in this
instant action should not be vacated since the default judgment was appropriate
and did not violate due process.  In
accordance with the equitable private attorney general doctrine, Plaintiff
filed the a request for attorney’s fees Pursuant to CCP §1021.5, and the court
properly approved the attorney’s fees for Plaintiff.
CONCLUSION
            Defendant’s Motion to Vacate Renewal
of Judgment by Default Pursuant to CCP § 683.170 is DENIED.
