 
BACKGROUND
 
On June 7, 2018, Plaintiff State Farm Mutual Automobile
Insurance Company (“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint alleging a single cause of
action for Subrogation against Defendants Julio Cesar Moran (“Moran”), Maria I.
Velasquez (“Velasquez”) (collectively, the “Defendants”), and DOES 1 through
40, inclusive. The Complaint arises from Defendant Julio Cesar Moran colliding
with the vehicle of Plaintiff’s insured. 
 
On October
24, 2018, Defendants filed a joint Answer to the Complaint. 
 
On March
5, 2021, Defendant Velasquez was dismissed from this action without prejudice. 
 
On March 8, 2021, Plaintiff filed a Settlement Stipulation
for Dismissal (the “Stipulation”). The Stipulation provides that Plaintiff shall
receive a total sum of $11,208.03 from Defendant Moran or on his behalf.
(Stipulation, ¶ 2.) The amount owed is to be allotted as follows: a lump sum
payment of $5,708.03 made by Defendant Moran’s insurance carrier, or any other
source, forthwith; and the balance of $5,500.00 shall be made in monthly
installments of $50.00 beginning on August 30, 2019, and due on the same day of
each month thereafter until the balance of the settlement amount is paid in
full. (Stipulation, ¶¶ 3-4.) Once Defendant Moran executes and delivers the
Stipulation to Plaintiff, Plaintiff was required to execute the Stipulation and
cause the action to be dismissed without prejudice. (Stipulation, ¶ 5.) 
 
The Stipulation provides that the parties stipulate with
each other and request that the Court retain jurisdiction of this matter
pursuant to CCP § 664.6. (Stipulation, ¶ 6.) If Defendant Moran pays the
settlement amount as agreed, the Stipulation provides that interest will be waived.
 (Stipulation, ¶ 7.) If Defendant
defaults and does not cure such default within 10 days, Plaintiff is “entitled
to have the dismissal set aside and judgment for the unpaid settlement amount
entered, plus the cost of requesting judgment be entered, plus interest at 7%
per year from the date the complaint was filed.” (Stipulation, ¶ 7.) 
 
On March 23, 2021, the Court entered an Order for Dismissal
with Reservation to Vacate and Enter Judgment Upon Breach (the “Order”), which
dismissed this action without prejudice in its entirety but allowed the Court
to retain jurisdiction to enforce the Stipulation pursuant to CCP § 664.6. (03/23/23
Order.) 
 
On April 16, 2024, Plaintiff filed and served the instant unopposed
Motion to Vacate Dismissal and Enter Judgment. As of June 26, 2024, the motion
is unopposed. Any opposition to the motion was required to have been filed and
served at least nine court days prior to the hearing. (CCP § 1005(b).)

ANALYSIS
 
I.          Enforcing
the Stipulation    
A.               
Legal Standard 
“Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6
provides a summary procedure to enforce a settlement agreement by entering
judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement.” Hines
v. Lukes (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 1174, 1182. “[I]f the parties to
pending litigation enter into a settlement either in writing signed by the
parties or orally before the court, the court, upon a motion, may enter
judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement.” Ibid. “The court
retains jurisdiction to enforce a settlement under the statute even after a
dismissal, but only if the parties requested such a retention of jurisdiction
before the dismissal.” Ibid. “Such a request must be made either in
writing signed by the parties or orally before the court.” Ibid. 
“A court ruling on a motion under Code
of Civil Procedure section 664.6 must determine whether the parties entered
into a valid and binding settlement.” Ibid. “A settlement is enforceable
under section 664.6 only if the parties agreed to all material settlement
terms.” Ibid. “The court ruling on the motion may consider the parties’
declarations and other evidence in deciding what terms the parties agreed to.” Ibid.
“If the court determines that the parties entered into an enforceable
settlement, it should grant the motion and enter a formal judgment pursuant to
the terms of the settlement.” Ibid. Code Civ. Proc. § 664.6 “expressly
provides for the court to enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the
settlement.” Id. at p. 1183. “It is widely recognized that the courts are not at
liberty to revise an agreement under the guise of construing it.” Series AGI Est Linn of Appian Group Investors
DE, LLC v. Eves (2013) 217 Cal.App.4th 156, 164. A prevailing party is entitled to its costs in
any action or proceeding. (CCP § 1032(b).) A prevailing party is a party with a
net monetary recovery. (CCP § 1032(a)(4).) “Except as attorney’s fees are
specifically provided for by statute, the measure and mode of compensation of
attorneys and counselors at law is left to the agreement, express or implied,
of the parties.” (CCP § 1021.) 
B.        Discussion
 
In support of the motion, Plaintiff’s
counsel, Harlan M. Reese, Esq. (“Reese”), provides a declaration. Counsel declares
that: on June 10, 2019, Plaintiff and Defendant Moran entered into the
Stipulation in which Defendant Moran agreed to make monthly payments to settle
this matter. (Reese Decl., ¶ 2; Exh. A.) This action was dismissed on March 23,
2021 with reservation to vacate and enter judgment upon breach. (Reese Decl., ¶
3; Exh. B.) Defendant Moran’s insurance carrier made a one-time payment in the
amount of $5,708.03. (Reese Decl., ¶ 4.) Defendant Moran made monthly payments
pursuant to the Stipulation totaling $2,300.00; however, Defendant Moran has
since defaulted on payments. (Reese Decl., ¶ 4.) Plaintiff has notified
Defendant Moran multiple times of his default. (Reese Decl., ¶ 5; Exh. C.)  
Plaintiff seeks to set
aside the dismissal and enter judgment in the amount of $11,208.03, less the
later payments of $8,008.03, plus court costs of $494.50, which amounts to
total judgment in the amount of $3,694.50. (Reese Decl., ¶ 7.) The court costs
consist of $370.00 for filing the Complaint, a $64.50 service of process fee,
and a $60.00 motion fee. (Reese Decl., ¶ 7.) 
 The
Court finds that it has authority to enforce the Stipulation pursuant to Hines
v. Lukes, supra, 167 Cal.App.4th 1174, 1182. Plaintiff and
Defendant Moran signed the Stipulation. The Court also has jurisdiction to
enforce the Stipulation as the parties explicitly requested—and furthermore
agreed—that the Court would retain jurisdiction to enforce such agreement. The
Court furthermore determines that the parties entered into a valid and binding
agreement. The declaration of Plaintiff’s counsel sets forth the terms of the Stipulation
and indicates that Defendant Moran has breached the Stipulation. 
 
The Court
notes that the Stipulation only allows Plaintiff to recover “the cost of
requesting judgment to be entered.” (Stipulation, ¶ 7.) As such, Plaintiff is
not entitled to recover costs for filing the Complaint in the amount of $370.00
or the service of process fee of $64.50. Plaintiff can only recover the costs
for filing the instant motion, which is in the sum of $60.00. 
 
The Motion to Vacate Dismissal and Enter Judgment is therefore
GRANTED IN PART. The Court will enforce the Stipulation and enter judgment
thereto but only in the amount of $3,260.00, which represents the settlement
amount of $11,208.03 minus payments collectively received from Defendant Moran and
Defendant Moran’s insurance carrier in the amount of $8,008.23, plus the motion
filing fee of $60.00.  
 
II.        Conclusion 
            
            Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s motion is GRANTED IN
PART. The Court will enforce the Stipulation and enter judgment thereto but
only in the amount of $3,260.00 pursuant to the Court’s discussion above. 
  
            Moving party is ordered to give
notice.
