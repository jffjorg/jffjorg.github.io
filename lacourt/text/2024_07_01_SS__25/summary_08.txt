Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the case and has found that there is a valid arbitration agreement between the plaintiff, Antonio Penaloza Salazar, and Defendant Romo's Auto Sales LLC. The court has also found that the arbitration agreement covers the claims alleged in the complaint. However, the court cannot grant the motion to compel arbitration at this time because Defendant Romo has not been served with the summons, complaint, and motion. The court continues the hearing on the motion to compel arbitration to August 13, 2024, at 10:00 AM, to allow Defendant Romo to be served.
