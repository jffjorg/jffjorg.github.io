**Tentative Ruling**

This tentative ruling is in response to Plaintiff State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company's unopposed Motion to Vacate Dismissal and Enter Judgment. The motion seeks to enforce a settlement agreement between Plaintiff and Defendant Julio Cesar Moran, which was reached on June 10, 2019. The settlement agreement provides for Defendant Moran to make monthly payments of $50.00 to settle the matter. However, Defendant Moran has defaulted on these payments and Plaintiff seeks to set aside the dismissal and enter judgment for the unpaid settlement amount.

The Court finds that it has authority to enforce the settlement agreement under California Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6 and that the parties entered into a valid and binding agreement. The Court determines that the parties agreed to all material settlement terms and that the settlement agreement allows Plaintiff to recover "the cost of requesting judgment to be entered."

The Court grants the motion in part, enforcing the settlement agreement and entering judgment for $3,260.00, which represents the settlement amount minus payments collectively received from Defendant Moran and Defendant Moran's insurance carrier, plus the motion filing fee of $60.00.
