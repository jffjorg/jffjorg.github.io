This is a tentative ruling in a lemon law action filed by Mayra Lemus and Martin Sanchez Hernandez against General Motors, LLC. The plaintiffs purchased a 2021 Chevrolet Colorado with a defective transmission system and allege that the defendant knowingly concealed the defect. The defendant demurred to the fourth cause of action for fraudulent concealment and moved to strike portions of the First Amended Complaint.

The court found that the defendant had a duty to disclose the defect and that the plaintiffs' allegations of fraudulent concealment are sufficient to state a cause of action.
