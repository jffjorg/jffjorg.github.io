Existence of an Arbitration Agreement
 
Under California law, arbitration
agreements are valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as
exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract. (Blake v. Ecker (2001) 93 Cal.App.4th
728, 741 (overruled on other grounds by
Le Francois v. Goel (2005) 35 Cal.4th 1094).) A party petitioning to compel
arbitration has the burden of establishing the existence of a valid agreement
to arbitrate, and the party opposing the petition has the burden of proving, by
a preponderance of the evidence, any fact necessary to its defense. (Banner Entertainment, Inc. v. Superior Court
(1998) 62 Cal.App.4th 348, 356-57.) 
 
As to the burden of production,
rather than persuasion, courts have articulated a three-step burden shifting
process: 
 
First, the moving party bears the
burden of producing “prima facie evidence of a written agreement to arbitrate
the controversy.” [citation] The moving party “can meet its initial burden by
attaching to the [motion or] petition a copy of the arbitration agreement
purporting to bear the [opposing party’s] signature.” [citation] Alternatively,
the moving party can meet its burden by setting forth the agreement’s
provisions in the motion. [citations] For this step, “it is not necessary to
follow the normal procedures of document authentication.” [citation] If the
moving party meets its initial prima facie burden and the opposing party does
not dispute the existence of the arbitration agreement, then nothing more is
required for the moving party to meet its burden of persuasion.
 
If the moving party meets its initial
prima facie burden and the opposing party disputes the agreement, then in the
second step, the opposing party bears the burden of producing evidence to
challenge the authenticity of the agreement. [citation] The opposing party can
do this in several ways. For example, the opposing party may testify under oath
or declare under penalty of perjury that the party never saw or does not
remember seeing the agreement, or that the party never signed or does not
remember signing the agreement. [citations]
 
If the opposing party meets its burden
of producing evidence, then in the third step, the moving party must establish
with admissible evidence a valid arbitration agreement between the parties. The
burden of proving the agreement by a preponderance of the evidence remains with
the moving party. [citation].
 
(Gamboa v. Northeast Community Clinic (2021) 72
Cal.App.5th 158, 165-66.)
 
Defendant has provided a document,
in English, titled, in block capitals, “Acknowledgement of Policies, Rules and
Agreement for At-Will Employment and Arbitration” signed by Plaintiff dated
July 6, 2022. (Declaration of Alexis Barrientos ISO Mot. Exh. A.) This document
states, in block capitals, above the signature line:
 
I KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY AGREE TO
SUBMIT AND SETTLE ANY DISPUTE, CONTROVERSY OR CLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING
TO MY EMPLOYMENT RELATIONSHIP WITH THE COMPANY TO ARBITRATION AS DESCRIBED IN
THE “ARBITRATION AGREEMENT” SECTION OF THIS HANDBOOK. I AGREE THAT THE
ARBITRATION OF SUCH ISSUES, INCLUDING THE DETERMINATION OF ANY AMOUNT OF
DAMAGES SUFFERED, SHALL BE FINAL AND BINDING UPON ALL PARTIES TO THE
ARBITRATION TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. I REALIZE BY AGREEING TO
ARBITRATION, I WILL HAVE WAIVED MY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY. THIS POLICY CANNOT
CHANGE EXCEPT BY WRITTEN AGREEMENT BETWEEN MYSELF AND THE PRESIDENT OF THE
COMPANY.
 
(Id.) Defendant has also provided the Arbitration
Agreement referenced in the Acknowledgement, which states:
 
This binding arbitration shall be
conducted by a retired judge or such other neutral third- party as jointly
selected by the parties, and the procedure governed by the Federal Arbitration
Act (9 U.S.C. Sections 1-16). All parties shall have all rights of discovery
and remedies as they would in a California civil action. The binding
arbitration award of all issues, including damages (if applicable) and
attorneys’ fees, shall be final and binding upon all the parties, to the extent
permitted by law. Judgment upon the binding arbitration award may be entered by
any court having jurisdiction. The parties shall each initially bear their own
costs and attorney’s fees. The Employer shall pay for the arbitrator’s fees and
any out-of-pocket costs required for the administration of the arbitration. The
arbitrator shall issue a written decision explaining the reasons for the
decision. The arbitrator shall follow the applicable law(s) in determining
whether to award attorneys’ fees and costs to the prevailing party. 
 
(Id. Exh. B.) As Plaintiff has not opposed this
motion, Defendant has therefore demonstrated that Plaintiff signed a binding
arbitration agreement. 
 
Applicability of the FAA
 
            The Agreement
expressly states that arbitration shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration
Act. (Barrientos Decl. Exh. B.) Plaintiff, having not responded to this motion,
does not dispute that the Federal Arbitration Act governs this agreement. 
 
//
 
Scope of the Arbitration Agreement
 
             “The scope of arbitration is a matter of
agreement between the parties.” (See, e.g., Ericksen, Arbuthnot, McCarthy,
Kearney & Walsh, Inc. v. 100 Oak Street (1983) 35 Cal.3d 312, 323.) “A
party can be compelled to arbitrate only those issues it has agreed to
arbitrate.” (Perez v. U-Haul Co. of California (2016) 3 Cal.App.5th 408,
419.)
 
Defendant contends that, as an
employment discrimination action, this case, on its face, arises out of
Plaintiff’s employment. As Plaintiff has not responded to the motion, Plaintiff
does not dispute this contention. The Court therefore finds that this action is
within the scope of the Arbitration Agreement. 
 
Conclusion
 
            As
Defendant has demonstrated the existence of a binding arbitration agreement
governed by the Federal Arbitration Act whose scope encompasses the claims
asserted in this action, the Court finds that Defendant is entitled to compel
this matter to binding arbitration. 
 
CONCLUSION:

 
Accordingly, Defendant’s Motion to Compel
Arbitration is GRANTED.
 
This action is hereby stayed
pending resolution of the arbitration.
 
The Court sets a hearing for a
Status Conference Re: Arbitration for Thursday, April 25, 2024, at 8:30 AM.
 
Moving Party to give notice.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.

have, in essence, waived your right to be present at the hearing, and you
should be aware that the court may not adopt the tentative, and may issue an
order which modifies the tentative ruling in whole or in part.
