And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge, Theresa M. Traber, issued a tentative ruling denying Plaintiff Olanna Taskey's motion for issue and monetary sanctions against Defendants Benjamin Boston, et al. The Plaintiff alleged that Defendant Hyland was employed by the other Defendants and sexually harassed and physically attacked her, and she requested sanctions due to the Defendants' failure to produce documents responsive to her Requests for Production. The Judge found that Plaintiff failed to provide adequate evidence to justify the extraordinary remedy of issue sanctions and that she did not demonstrate sanctionable conduct by the Defendants. The Judge also denied the Defendants' counter-request for monetary sanctions under Code of Civil Procedure sections 128.5 and 128.7, finding that they failed to demonstrate compliance with the safe harbor provisions.
