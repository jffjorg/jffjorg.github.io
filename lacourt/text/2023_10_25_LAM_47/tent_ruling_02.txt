STATEMENT
OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
            This is a medical malpractice action. Plaintiff alleges that Defendant
failed to adhere to the standard of care while performing cardiac surgery on
Plaintiff in October 2018. 
 
Defendant moves to advance the
hearing on Defendant’s pending Motion for Summary Judgment or Summary
Adjudication currently scheduled for April 16, 2024. 
            
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Defendant moves to advance the
hearing on Defendant’s pending Motion for Summary Judgment or Summary
Adjudication currently scheduled for April 16, 2024. In the alternative,
Defendant moves for a trial continuance to permit his motion to be heard. 
 
The Court has the inherent power to
control its own processes and orders so as to make them conform to law and
justice. (Code Civ. Proc. § 128(a)(8).) Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 437c subdivision (a)(2), notice of a Motion for Summary Judgment or
Summary Adjudication must be served a minimum of 75 days in advance of the date
of the hearing, plus additional days for overnight mail, electronic service, or
U.S. mail. (Code Civ. Proc. § 437c(a)(2).) Moreover, the motion must be heard
no later than 30 days before the date of trial. (Code Civ. Proc. § 437c(a)(3).)

 
Defendant’s Motion for Summary
Judgment, or, in the alternative, Summary Adjudication was filed with this
Court on September 27, 2023, and the attached proof of service states that it
was served on all parties by electronic service. (Motion for Summary Judgment
POS.) Trial in this matter is set for January 16, 2024, but the motion is not
scheduled to be heard until April 16, 2024. Defendant’s counsel represents that
the latter date was the first date available on the Court’s reservation system
for a summary judgment motion. (Declaration of David J. Rubaum ISO Mot. ¶ 5.) Thirty
days before the date of trial is Sunday, December 17, 2023. Therefore, the last
possible date to have this motion heard is Friday, December 15. (See Code Civ.
Proc. § 12.) Moreover, accounting for the full statutory notice period of 75
days plus two court days, the first date this motion could be heard is
Wednesday, December 13, 2023. So as to avoid continuance of trial and to ensure
all parties receive the notice of and time to respond to this motion to which
they are entitled by statute, the Court will set the hearing on Defendant’s
Motion for Summary Judgment to Friday, December 15, 2023. 
 
Accordingly, Defendant’s Motion to
Advance Hearing is GRANTED. 
 
Defendant’s Motion for Summary
Judgment, or, in the alternative, Summary Adjudication currently scheduled for
April 16, 2024 at 9:00AM is advanced to this date and CONTINUED to Friday,
December 15, 2023, at 9:00 AM. Any opposition or reply papers shall be served
and filed pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 437c. 
 
Moving Party to give notice.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.

            Any party may submit on the
tentative ruling by contacting the courtroom via email at Smcdept47@lacourt.org by no later than 4:00 p.m. the day
before the hearing. All interested parties must be copied on the email. It
should be noted that if you submit on a tentative ruling the court will still
conduct a hearing if any party appears. By submitting on the tentative you
have, in essence, waived your right to be present at the hearing, and you
should be aware that the court may not adopt the tentative, and may issue an
order which modifies the tentative ruling in whole or in part.
