Demurrer to First Amended Complaint
 
            Defendant
demurs to the fifth cause of action for fraudulent concealment in the First
Amended Complaint. 
 
Legal Standard
 
A demurrer tests whether the
complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147
Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) When considering demurrers, courts read the allegations
liberally and in context. (Taylor v. City of Los Angeles Dept. of Water and
Power (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1228.) In a demurrer proceeding, the
defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial
notice. (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968,
994.) “A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other
extrinsic matters. Therefore, it lies only where the defects appear on the face
of the pleading or are judicially noticed.” (SKF Farms v. Superior Court
(1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 902, 905.) “The only issue involved in a demurrer hearing
is whether the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous matters,
states a cause of action.” (Hahn, supra, 147 Cal.App.4th at p. 747.) The
ultimate facts alleged in the complaint must be deemed true, as well as all
facts that may be implied or inferred from those expressly alleged. (Marshall
v. Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1397, 1403; see also Shields
v. County of San Diego (1984) 155 Cal.App.3d 103, 133 [stating, “[o]n
demurrer, pleadings are read liberally and allegations contained therein are
assumed to be true”].) “This rule of liberal construction means that the
reviewing court draws inferences favorable to the plaintiff, not the
defendant.” (Perez v. Golden Empire Transit Dist. (2012) 209 Cal.App.4th
1228, 1238.) 
 
Meet and Confer
 
Before filing a demurrer, the
demurring party shall meet and confer in person or by telephone with the party
who has filed the pleading subject to the demurrer and file a declaration
detailing their meet and confer efforts.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41(a).) That
said, an insufficient meet and confer process is not grounds to overrule
or sustain a demurrer.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41(a)(4).)
 
The Declaration of Jesse Valencia in
support of the demurrer states that the parties met and conferred on July 31,
2023 via telephone regarding this demurrer and the simultaneous motion to
strike, but were not able to reach an agreement. (Declaration of Jesse Valencia
ISO Demurrer ¶ 3.) The Court therefore finds that Defendant has satisfied the
statutory meet and confer process. 
 
Analysis
 
            Defendant
demurs to the fifth cause of action for fraudulent concealment for failure to
state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.
The elements of fraud are (a) a misrepresentation (false
representation, concealment, or nondisclosure); (b) knowledge of its falsity;
(c) intent to induce reliance; (d) justifiable reliance; and (e) resulting
damage. (Lazar v. Superior Court (1996) 12 Cal.4th 631, 638.)  
 
The elements of fraudulent concealment are (1) concealment
or suppression of a material fact; (2) by a defendant with a duty to disclose
the fact to the plaintiff; (3) intent to defraud the plaintiff by intentionally
concealing or suppressing the fact; (4) the plaintiff was unaware of the fact
and would not have acted as he or she did if he or she had known of the
concealed or suppressed fact; and (5) the plaintiff sustained damage as a
result of the concealment or suppression of fact. (Hambridge v. Healthcare
Partners Medical Group, Inc. (2015) 238 Cal.App.4th 124, 162.)  
 
1.     
Representations
 
            Defendant
first argues that Plaintiffs’ fourth cause of action fails because they do not
allege any misrepresentations by Defendant or its agents. This contention
neglects that Plaintiffs allege a cause of action for fraudulent concealment,
not ordinary fraudulent misrepresentation. Defendants have therefore failed to
demonstrate that the fifth cause of action is defective on this basis.
 
2.     
Duty to Disclose
 
Defendant next argues that it had no duty to disclose any defect
because it had no transactional relationship with Plaintiffs. 
 
There are four circumstances in which nondisclosure or
concealment may constitute actionable fraud: (1) when the defendant is in a
fiduciary relationship with the plaintiff; (2) when the defendant had exclusive
knowledge of material facts not known to the plaintiff; (3) when the defendant
actively conceals a material fact from the plaintiff; or (4) when the defendant
makes partial representations but also suppresses some material fact.” (LiMandri
v. Judkins (1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 326, 336.) A duty to disclose may also
arise when a defendant possesses or exerts control over material facts not
readily available to the plaintiff. (Jones v. ConocoPhillips Co. (2011)
198 Cal.App.4th 1198, 1199.)  
 
“Even under the strict rules of common law pleading, one of
the canons was that less particularity is required when the facts lie more in
the knowledge of the opposite party.” (Alfaro v. Community Housing
Improvement System & Planning Assn., Inc. (2009) 171 Cal.App.4th 1256,
1384.)  
 
            Defendant argues that this cause of
action fails because, although the First Amended Complaint contends that
Defendant had exclusive knowledge of and actively concealed material facts from
Plaintiffs, the First Amended Complaint does not allege a transactional
relationship between the parties. Ordinarily, a duty to disclose absent a
fiduciary relationship “presupposes the existence of [a] relationship between
the plaintiff and defendant in which a duty to disclose can arise.” (Bigler-Engler
v. Breg, Inc. (2017) 7 Cal.App.5th 276, 311.) Defendant contends that
because Defendant is the manufacturer of Plaintiff’s vehicle, there was not a
“direct dealing” between the parties that gives rise to a duty to disclose.
(See Bigler-Engler, supra, at 311.) Defendant is mistaken.
 
            Although a manufacturer does not
have a transactional relationship with the “public at large” (Bigler-Engler,
supra, at 311), a vendor does have a duty to disclose material facts
“not only to immediate purchasers, but also to subsequent purchasers
when the vendor has reason to expect that the item will be resold.” (OCM
Principle Opportunities Fund v. CIBC World Markets Corp. (2007) 157
Cal.App.4th 835, 859-60.) Here, the essential allegation is that
Plaintiffs are not members of the public at large, but a subsequent purchaser
of a product manufactured by Defendant. Existing precedent does not require
Plaintiffs to allege any further relationship with the manufacturer of the
vehicle exhibiting the defects giving rise to this action. 
 
Motion to Strike Portions of First Amended Complaint
 
            Defendant
moves to strike Plaintiff’s prayer for punitive damages on the basis that the
fourth cause of action for fraud is without merit, and Plaintiff has failed to
allege facts sufficient to support a claim of malice or oppression. As the
Court has overruled Defendant’s demurrer to the fourth cause of action for
fraud, this argument necessarily fails. 
 
CONCLUSION:

 
            Accordingly, Defendant’s
Demurrer to the First Amended Complaint is OVERRULED.
 
            Defendant’s
Motion to Strike Portions of the First Amended Complaint is DENIED. 
 
            Moving
Party to give notice.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
