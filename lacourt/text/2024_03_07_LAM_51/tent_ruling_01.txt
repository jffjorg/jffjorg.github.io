STATEMENT OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS: 
 
On December 2, 2021, Plaintiff Claire Lin (Plaintiff) filed
a Complaint against Defendant General Motors, LLC (Defendant) with two causes
of action for: (1) Breach of Implied Warranty of Merchantability under the
Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act; and (2) Breach of Express Warranty under
the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act. The Complaint concerns Plaintiff’s lease
of a 2019 Chevrolet Bolt EV, VIN 23 1G1FZ6S05K4108229.
 
On January 7, 2022, Defendant filed an Answer. 
 
On January 28, 2022, Plaintiff moved for leave to file a
First Amended Complaint (FAC), which the court granted on March 28, 2022.
 
On March 28, 2022, Plaintiff’s FAC was deemed filed. Plaintiff’s
FAC added a third cause of action for Violation of Business and Professions
Code § 17200.
 
On April 25, 2022, Defendant filed an Answer to the FAC.
 
On October 17, 2023, Plaintiff filed a Notice of Settlement.

 
On December 20, 2023, Plaintiff filed the instant motion for
attorneys’ fees and costs. On January 22, 2024, Defendant filed an opposition.
On January 29, 2024, Plaintiff filed a reply.
 
On February 5, 2024, the court held a hearing on Plaintiff’s
Motion for Attorney Fees and Costs with an Order to Show Cause re: Dismissal
(Settlement). The parties agreed to further meet and confer regarding
settlement as to Attorney Fees and the court continued the hearing to March 7,
2024.
 
On February 22, 2024, the parties filed a Joint Report re
Status of Settlement of Plaintiff’s Motion for Attorney’s Fees and Costs.
 
LEGAL STANDARD: 
 
A prevailing buyer in an action under Song-Beverly “shall
be allowed by the court to recover as part of the judgment a sum equal to the
aggregate amount of costs and expenses, including attorney’s fees based on
actual time expended, determined by the Court to have been reasonably incurred
by the buyer in connection with the commencement and prosecution of such
action.”  (Civ. Code, § 1794(d).) By permitting buyers who prevail under
Song-Beverly to recover their attorneys’ fees, “our Legislature has provided
injured consumers strong encouragement to seek legal redress in a situation in
which a lawsuit might not otherwise have been economically feasible.” (Murillo v. Fleetwood Enterprises, Inc.
(1998) 17 Cal.4th 985, 994.)   
 
The prevailing party has the burden of showing that the
requested attorney fees are reasonable. (Robertson
v. Fleetwood Travel Trailers of California Inc. (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 785,
817.) The party seeking attorney fees “is not necessarily entitled to the
compensation of the value of attorney services according to [his or her] own
notion or to the full extent claimed . . . .”  (Levy v. Toyota Motor Sales, USA, Inc. (1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 807,
816.) If the “time expended or the monetary charge being made for the time
expended are not reasonable under all circumstances, then the court must take
this into account and award fees in a lesser amount.” (Nightingale v. Hyundai Motor America (1994) 31 Cal.App.4th 99,
104.)   
 
A calculation of attorneys’ fees for a Song-Beverly action
begins with the “lodestar” approach, under which the Court fixes the lodestar
at “the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly
rate.” (Margolin v. Regional Planning
Com. (1982) 134 Cal.App.3d 999, 1004-1005.) “California courts have
consistently held that a computation of time spent on a case and the reasonable
value of that time is fundamental to a determination of an appropriate
attorneys’ fee award.” (Ibid.)  
 
“It is appropriate for a trial court to reduce a fee award
based on its reasonable determination that a routine, non-complex case was
overstaffed to a degree that significant inefficiencies and inflated fees
resulted.”  (Morris v. Hyundai Motor
America (2019) 41 Cal.App.5th 24, 39.) It is also appropriate to reduce a
fee award based on “inefficient or duplicative efforts” in the billing record.
(Id. at p. 38.) However, the analysis
must be “reasonably specific” and cannot rely on general notions about the fairness
of the fee award. (Kerkeles v. City of
San Jose (2015) 243 Cal.App.4th 88, 102.) Moreover, in conducting the
analysis, courts are not permitted to tie any reductions in the fee award to
some proportion of the buyer’s damages recovery. (Warren v. Kia Motors America, Inc. (2018) 30 Cal.App.5th 24,
39.)   
 
The lodestar figure may also be adjusted, based on
consideration of factors specific to the case, in order to fix the fee at the
fair market value for the legal services provided. (Serrano v. Priest (1977) 20 Cal.3d 25, 49; PLCM Group, Inc. v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.App.4th 1084, 1095.) The factors considered in determining the
modification of the lodestar include the nature and difficulty of the
litigation, the amount of money involved, the skill required and employed to
handle the case, the attention given, the success or failure,¿and other circumstances in the case. (EnPalm, LLC v.¿Teitler¿Family Trust¿(2008)
162 Cal. App. 4th 770, 774 (emphasis in original).) A negative modifier was
appropriate when duplicative work had been performed. (Thayer v. Wells Fargo Bank,¿N.A.¿(2001) 92 Cal.App.4th 819.)¿ 
 
ANALYSIS: 
 
Plaintiff requests $65,159.50 in attorneys’ fees and
$4,959.92 in costs for a total of $70,119.42. Defendant requests that the court
reduce the attorneys’ fees to $27,680.00 and costs to $3,676.60. 
 
In the Joint Status Report, the parties indicate that
Plaintiff reduced their fee demand by 5.6 hours or $1,547.50 representing the
time spent drafting memos to file re case status and travel time to the first
Motion to Compel the Deposition of GM’s Person Most Knowledgeable hearing.
Plaintiff reiterates another voluntary reduction of 5.7 hours or $2,157.50 from
the billing that was filed with Plaintiff’s Motion for Attorneys’ Fees and
Costs. In sum, Plaintiff reduces their original request for Attorneys Fees
request from $65,159.50 to $61,454.50. Defendant’s position is unchanged.
 
Prevailing Party
 
Here, the parties entered a Settlement Agreement that provided
for GM to pay Plaintiff $40,000.00 cash, inclusive of civil penalties, with no
obligation for Plaintiff to return the subject vehicle; that Plaintiff is the
prevailing party; and that attorneys’ fees, costs, and expenses incurred by
Plaintiff would be paid in compliance with Civil Code § 1794(d) by way of
motion. (Barry Decl. ¶42, Exhibit 10.) 
 
Lodestar
Fees  
 
The lodestar method looks at the time spent on a matter multiplied
by the reasonable hourly rate. (Serrano, supra 20 Cal.3d at 49). The two-step
process begins with the lodestar method, which is the time spent on the matter
multiple by the hourly rate. After the lodestar method, the second step is
determining whether a multiplier should be applied. The factors that Courts
look at to determine if a multiplier is reasonable are: 1) the novelty and
difficulty of the questions involved, (2) the skill displayed in presenting
them, (3) the extent to which the nature of the litigation precluded other
employment by the attorneys, (4) the contingent nature of the fee award.” (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122,
1132). 
 
“In determining hourly rates, the court must look to the
“prevailing market rates in the relevant community.” (Bell v. Clackamas County¿(9th Cir.2003) 341 F.3d 858, 868.) The
rates of comparable attorneys in the forum district are usually used. (See¿Gates v. Deukmejian¿(9th Cir.1992) 987
F.2d 1392, 1405.) In making its calculation, the court should also consider the
experience, skill, and reputation of the attorney requesting fees.” (Heritage Pacific Financial, LLC v. Monroy¿(2013)
215 Cal.App.4th 972, 1009.) 
 
Plaintiffs argue the hourly rates are reasonable. Here, the
requested hourly rates are as follows:
·        
David N. Barry: 35.2 hours at $625/hour
·        
Anna H. Galaviz: 5.3 hours at $515/hour
·        
Logan G. Pascal: 4.6 hours at $350/hour
·        
Brian J. Kim: 129.4 hours at $300/hour
The court finds that these hourly rates are reasonable based
on the hourly rate of similarly situated attorneys in the Los Angeles area.
Based on the Laffey Matrix, attorneys with similar years of experience as
Plaintiffs’ counsel as identified above have comparable, if not a higher hourly
rate. However,
billing at a high rate comes with the expectation that the attorney also works
in an efficient manner that reflects the premium paid for his or her services.
The court considers this fact in addressing the reasonableness of the hours
expended, below.  
 
Thus, the hourly rates are appropriate.
 
Reasonableness
of Hours Billed  
 
To determine if the requested amount is reasonable,
California courts utilize the lodestar method. The two-step process begins with
the lodestar method, which is the time spent on the matter multiple by the
hourly rate. After the lodestar method, the second step is determining whether
a multiplier should be applied. The factors that Courts look at to determine if
a multiplier is reasonable are: 1) the novelty and difficulty of the questions
involved, (2) the skill displayed in presenting them, (3) the extent to which
the nature of the litigation precluded other employment by the attorneys, (4)
the contingent nature of the fee award.” (Ketchum
v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1132.)  
 
Although a verified fee bill is “prima facie evidence the
costs, expenses and services listed were necessarily incurred,” (Hadley v. Krepel (1985) 167 Cal.App.3d
677, 682), ultimately, Counsel still has the burden to demonstrate the
reasonableness of charges. (Mikhaeilpoor,
supra, 48 Cal.App.5th at p. 247.) The
court has reviewed the fee bill submitted by Counsel and the proposed
reductions by Defendant.
 
Plaintiffs
contend that the billable hours are reasonable. The total amount billed is 180
hours. While Plaintiff is to be commended for not billing for all work and assigning
much of the work to a junior associate billing at $300 per hour, the hours
billed for this unremarkable lemon law case with no dispositive motions and
very little other motion work seems high. Upon review of the billing, the Court
questioned the reasonableness of some billing entries.
 
Pleadings, Motions,
& Discovery
 
Boilerplate filings serve a useful purpose. They increase
productivity by allowing for simple edits to existing documents. Thus,
utilizing templates is to be commended when it results in efficiency. However,
if templates are employed but attorneys are still billing significant time to
make minor changes, such use of legal resources is unwarranted and any such
bill is unreasonable, particularly if the attorney is billing at a high hourly
rate. (Mikhaeilpoor, supra, at p. 250.) Here, the court found
instances where the time spent for minor cut and paste edits to templates was
unreasonable.
 
i.                   
Complaint/Amended
Complaint
Counsel acknowledged that because of their oversight, they failed
to file a UCL claim in the initial pleading. While it would have been a better
practice for Defendant to stipulate to the amendment, it nonetheless is not reasonable
to have Defendant pay for Plaintiff’s admitted oversight. This is worthy of a
$1,600 reduction.
 
 
ii.                 
Discovery
Requests to Defendant
Counsel billed 12.6 hours at $300.00 per hour to draft
initial discovery requests to Defendant that were identical in several other
cases. (Quezada Decl., Exhibit A, B, E, and F.) The review of these billing
entries reveals unreasonable charges. To start, Form Interrogatories are a
Judicial Council form that merely requires checking boxes. Deposition notices
are also templates. The remaining discovery requests appear to be standard
Song-Beverly Act discovery questions with minimal edits tailored to the subject
vehicle. This hardly warrants 12.6 hours from a seasoned Lemon Law attorney even at a discounted $300.00 per hour.
Accordingly, these fees are unreasonably inflated by 50 %. The court finds that
no more than $1,800 should have been expended instead of the billed $3,780.
 
iii.               
Motion in Limine
The Motions in limine are templates and are routinely filed.
Other than the motion to exclude the expert witness, the Court questions whether
the in limine motion are even proper motions since they do not seek to exclude
identifiable evidence or resolve difficult evidentiary issues. Plaintiff billed
19.7 hours for a total of $5,910. Much of these charges are unreasonable and
unnecessary. The court finds that no more than $1200 should have been expended
resulting in a reduction of $4,710.
 
The Court appreciates that Plaintiff has voluntarily further
reduced their own bill by 
5.6 hours for $1,547.50 for drafting file memos and 5.7 hours
for $2,157.50 related to the fee motion. Otherwise, the Court finds that Plaintiff
has satisfied their burden justifying the reasonableness of their fee bill.
 
As such, the Court reduces the
requested lodestar by $8,290. In all other respects, the billings are proper
and reasonable. To be clear, the Court finds the reasonable amount of fees,
based upon its experience and knowledge of this type of litigation, the lack of
novelty and complexity of this case, and the professed specialization of
Plaintiff’s counsel is $55,322. 
 
Costs: 
 
            Plaintiffs
request $4,959.92 in costs and expenses. The memorandum of Costs is attached as
Exhibit 8. “Items on a verified cost bill are prima facie evidence the costs, expenses
and services listed were necessarily incurred, and when they are properly
challenged the burden of proof shifts to the party claiming them as costs.” (Hadley, supra, 167 Cal.App.3d at 682).
Under CCP § 1794(d) “If the buyer prevails in an action under this section, the
buyer shall be allowed by the court to recover as part of the judgment a sum
equal to the aggregate amount of costs and expenses, including attorney's fees
based on actual time expended, determined by the court to have been reasonably
incurred by the buyer in connection with the commencement and prosecution of
such action.”
             
Defendant argues that the Court
should reduce the requested amount by $1,283.32. This is based on the parking
and mileage, the filing fee, and future estimated court reporter fees.
 
            The Court
finds that Defendant has failed to file a Motion to Tax Costs. Thus, the
requested costs are appropriate. Moreover, while the reporter charge was
estimated at the first hearing, the charge has been incurred as of this, the
subsequent hearing. Thus, as of today, the $550 for a future hearing is an
“incurred cost” Thus, the Court will deny the request to reduce the costs. 
 
CONCLUSION:
 
            For
the foregoing reasons, the Court decides the pending motion as follows: 
 
Motion for Attorneys’ Fees is GRANTED, in the amount of $55,322
and costs in the amount of $4,959.92 for a total of $60,281.92 payable within 45
days of service of this order. 
 
 
Moving party is to give notice. 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
