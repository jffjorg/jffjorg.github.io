And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge has ruled on the Defendant's demurrer to the Plaintiff's Verified Complaint. The Defendant demurred, arguing that the loan is barred by California's One-Action/Security-First Rule (California Code of Civil Procedure § 726). However, the Judge found that the promissory note is not secured by real property, but rather by personal property, specifically the assets of La Flor De Mayo Market. Additionally, Jennifer Sang Young Lee, the grantor under the commercial security agreement, is not a guarantor, and real property has not been offered as collateral. Therefore, the Judge ruled that Code Civ. Proc. § 726 is inapplicable and overruled the demurrer, ordering the Defendant to answer the Complaint within 10 days.
