And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel plaintiff's responses to discovery requests and a request for sanctions. The plaintiff, Barbara Miranda, failed to respond to the defendant, City of Santa Monica's, discovery requests, despite an extension and requests from the City's counsel. The judge has granted the City's motion to compel the plaintiff's responses and ordered the plaintiff to serve verified, code-compliant responses without objection on or before September 25, 2024.

The judge has also granted the City's request for sanctions, but in an amount to be discussed by the City's counsel during oral argument. The City is seeking $250 for the motion to compel Form Interrogatories and $500 for the motion to compel Requests for Production of Documents. The judge notes that the monetary sanctions requested are reasonable, but requires oral argument from the City's attorney to determine the amount of time spent and hours not spent on reviewing the opposition and preparing a reply brief.

The judge has scheduled a hearing for September 4, 2024, to discuss the amount of sanctions and to provide an opportunity for the parties to argue the issues.
