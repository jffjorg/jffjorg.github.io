BACKGROUND
 
This action arises from a motor vehicle
accident. On February 3, 2022, Plaintiff Arturo Sandoval (“Plaintiff”) filed a
complaint against Defendants Michael Scott Hurtado Gomez (“Gomez”), Jesus Edgar
Salazar (“Salazar”), and Does 1 to 15 (collectively “Defendants”), alleging two
causes of action: (1) motor vehicle negligence; and (2) general negligence.
 
On June 6, 2024, the case was reassigned
to the Honorable Karen Moskowitz in Department B at Van Nuys Courthouse East,
effective June 24, 2024.
 
On November 20, 2024, Plaintiffs filed
the instant request for default judgment.
 
Gomez default was entered on 5/1/24. 
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
Cal. Code of Civil Procedure § 585
permits entry of a default judgment after a party has failed to timely respond
or appear. (Cal. Code of Civ. Proc. § 585.) A party seeking judgment on the
default by the court must file a Request for Court Judgment, and: (1) a brief
summary of the case; (2) declarations or other admissible evidence in support
of the judgment requested; (3) interest computations as necessary; (4) a
memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) declaration of nonmilitary status;
(6) a proposed form of judgment; (7) a dismissal of all parties against whom
judgment is not sought or an application for separate judgment under CCP § 579,
supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment; (8) exhibits as necessary;
and (9) a request for attorney’s fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement
of the parties. (Cal. Rules of Court Rule 3.1800.)

seeks damages in the total amount of $680,560.82, representing $180,060.82 in
special damages, $500,000.00 in general damages, and $500.00 in costs.
