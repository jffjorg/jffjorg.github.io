BACKGROUND
 
This action
arises from the September 2019 stabbing and subsequent death of Defendant
Cyndy’s Cleaning Services (“Cyndy’s”)’s employee Kamryn Stone. (Complaint ¶¶
4-5.) On June 30,
2021, Barry F. Stone, individually and as successor-in-interest to the Estate
of Kamryn Stone and Kristie Campbell-Stone, sued ABM Industry Groups, LLC
(“ABM”), and other defendants, alleging premises liability, negligence,
negligent hiring, and assault and battery. (Ibid. at ¶ 4.)
 
On
June 7, 2024, this action was reassigned to the Honorable Karen Moskowitz in
Department B at Van Nuys Courthouse East, effective June 24, 2024. 
 
On October
29, 2024, Samuel C. Gazzo, Esq. (“Counsel”) filed and served the instant
unopposed Motion to be Relieved as Counsel for Cyndy’s.
 
[Tentative] Ruling
 
The Court GRANTS the Motion to be
Relieved as Counsel filed by Samuel C. Gazzo, Esq.
 
LEGAL STANDARD
 
The
court may order that an attorney be changed or substituted at any time before
or after judgment or final determination upon request by either client or
attorney and after notice from one to the other. (Cal. Code of Civ. Proc. §
284(2).) “The determination whether to grant or deny a motion to withdraw as
counsel lies within the sound discretion of the trial court.” (Manfredi
& Levine v. Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128,
1133.)   
 
An application to be relieved as
counsel must be made on Judicial Counsel Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and
Motion) (Cal. Rules of Court Rule 3.1362(a)), MC-052 (Declaration) (CRC Rule
3.1362(c)), and MC-053 (Proposed Order) (CRC Rule 3.1362(e)).  The
proposed order must specify all hearing dates scheduled in the action or
proceeding, including the date of trial, if known. (CRC Rule 3.1362(e).) 
 
Further, the
requisite forms must be served on the client and all other parties who have
appeared in the case. (CRC Rule 3.1362(d).) The court may delay the
effective date of the order relieving counsel until proof of service of a copy
of the signed order on the client has been filed with the court. (CRC Rule
3.1362(e).) The Court has discretion on whether to allow an attorney to
withdraw, and a motion to withdraw will not be granted where withdrawal would
prejudice the client.  (Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21
Cal.App.4th 904, 915.)  

 
DISCUSSION
Counsel declares that Developers
Surety & Indemnity Company (“DSIC”) retained Counsel to defend Cyndy’s in
this matter. (MC-052 Item 2.) DSIC obtained judgment against Cyndy’s which
provides in pertinent part that DSIC has no duty to defend or indemnify Cyndy’s
in this matter. (Ibid.) Accordingly, DSIC has terminated Counsel’s
representation and directed Counsel to withdraw from this case. (Ibid.)
Counsel has filed and served Cyndy’s with
the required documents under CRC Rule 3.1362. Cyndy’s will not be prejudiced by
Counsel’s relief as they have adequate time to find alternative representation.
Therefore, Counsel’s motion to be relieved is granted, effective upon service
and filing of the proof of service of the Order with the Court.
CONCLUSION
 
The Court GRANTS the Motion to be
Relieved as Counsel filed by Samuel C. Gazzo, Esq. Court
to sign proposed Order.
 
Moving party is ordered to give notice.
