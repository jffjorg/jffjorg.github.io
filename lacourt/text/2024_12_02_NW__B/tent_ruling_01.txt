Plaintiff David Medina’s Request for Default
Judgment
 
Defendant: Rives Grogan
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
Plaintiff David Medina’s Request for
Default Judgment against Defendant Rives Grogan is DENIED.
            
BACKGROUND
 
This is a personal injury action. On February
9, 2021, Plaintiff David Medina (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against
Defendants Rives Grogan (“Grogan”), New Beginnings Christian Discipleship (“New
Beginnings”), GM Service (“GM”), and Does 1 through 25 (collectively
“Defendants”), alleging two causes of action: (1) general negligence; and (2)
premises liability.
 
On June 5, 2024, the case was reassigned
to the Honorable Karen Moskowitz in Department B at Van Nuys Courthouse East,
effective June 24, 2024.
 
On 3/22/23 default was entered as to
Grogan. 
 
On August 1, 2024, Plaintiff filed the
instant request for default judgment.
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
Cal. Code of Civil Procedure § 585
permits entry of a default judgment after a party has failed to timely respond
or appear. (Cal. Code of Civ. Proc. § 585.) A party seeking judgment on the
default by the court must file a Request for Court Judgment, and: (1) a brief
summary of the case; (2) declarations or other admissible evidence in support
of the judgment requested; (3) interest computations as necessary; (4) a
memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) declaration of nonmilitary status;
(6) a proposed form of judgment; (7) a dismissal of all parties against whom
judgment is not sought or an application for separate judgment under CCP § 579,
supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment; (8) exhibits as necessary;
and (9) a request for attorney’s fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement
of the parties. (Cal. Rules of Court Rule 3.1800.) 
 
ANALYSIS
 
Plaintiff seeks
damages in the total amount of $490,718.81, representing $188,325.48 in special
damages, $300,000.00 in general damages, and $2,393.33 in attorney’s fees.
 
Plaintiffs’
request for default judgment against Defendants is denied for the following deficiencies:
 
1.       Plaintiff failed to file a CIV-100
requesting default judgment. (CRC 3.1800(a).)
2.       Plaintiff failed to file a JUD-100 or
other proposed order. (CRC 3.1800(a)(6).)
 
3/ Plaintiff requests attorney’s fees but fails to
provide a retainer agreement or other statutory basis for attorney’s fees.
(Cal. Civ. Code § 1717.5(a); CRC 3.1800(a)(9).)
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s
request for default judgment against Defendant Rives Grogan is DENIED. Plaintiff
is put on notice that further deficient filings risk sanctions or dismissal
pursuant to Cal. Code of Civ. Proc. § 583.410 and CRC 3.110 (h).
 
Moving party is ordered to give notice.
