And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants the motion filed by Samuel C. Gazzo, Esq. (Counsel) to be relieved as counsel for Cyndy's Cleaning Services. The motion is unopposed. Counsel declares that Cyndy's has no duty to defend or indemnify Cyndy's, and DSIC has terminated Counsel's representation. Counsel has filed and served Cyndy's with the required documents under CRC Rule 3.1362. The judge finds that Cyndy's will not be prejudiced by Counsel's relief, as they have adequate time to find alternative representation. The motion is granted, and Counsel is relieved as counsel for Cyndy's.
