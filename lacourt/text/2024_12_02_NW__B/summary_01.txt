And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Plaintiff David Medina's request for default judgment against Defendant Rives Grogan. The judge found that the request was deficient in several ways, including the failure to file a CIV-100 request and a proposed order, and the failure to provide a retainer agreement or statutory basis for attorney's fees. The judge also noted that the request did not meet the requirements of California Code of Civil Procedure section 585. As a result, the judge denied the request and put the plaintiff on notice that further deficient filings may risk sanctions or dismissal.
