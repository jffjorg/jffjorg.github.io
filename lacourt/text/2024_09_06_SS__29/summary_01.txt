And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the defendants' motions to compel nonparties Spalding Multi-Specialty Surgery Center, LLC and Mobin Medical Corporation dba Mobin Neurosurgery to appear for deposition without prejudice. The defendants had issued deposition subpoenas to the nonparties and served them personally, but the nonparties did not appear for the scheduled depositions. The Judge found that the defendants' counsel had communicated with the nonparties' counsel and that the nonparties' counsel had stated that the depositions could not proceed due to "unforeseen circumstances". The Judge ruled that the nonparties must be personally served with a motion to compel, and since the defendants had not done so, the motions were denied. The Judge ordered the defendants to give notice and scheduled a hearing for September 6, 2024.
