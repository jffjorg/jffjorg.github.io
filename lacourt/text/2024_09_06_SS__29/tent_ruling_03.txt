Background
Two consolidated cases arise out of a
multi-vehicle automobile accident on July 6, 2019, near the Adams Exit on the
101 North Freeway in Los Angeles.
In Case No. 21STCV23847 (the “Marinero
Action”), Plaintiffs Luis Felix Marinero, Ana Rodriguez, and Nathaly Rodriguez
filed a complaint on June 28, 2021, asserting causes of action for negligence
and negligence per se against Defendant Angelica Bianca Diaz (“Diaz”) and Does
1 through 25.  Diaz filed her answer on August 20, 2021.
In Case No. 21STCV24492 (the “Smith
Action”), Plaintiff Lloyd Smith (“Smith”) filed a complaint on July 1, 2021,
asserting a cause of action for negligence against Defendants Diaz, Luis
Rodriguez, and Does 1 through 50.  On
February 1, 2023, Diaz and Luis Rodriguez each filed their
answers.  Diaz and Luis Rodriguez filed Cross-Complaints against each
other as well.
On March 15, 2023, the Court
determined that the Marinero Action and the Smith Action are related cases.  On February 23, 2024, the Court consolidated
the Marinero Action and the Smith Action, with the Marinero Action as the lead
case.
On August 6, 2024, Diaz filed these
two motions, seeking to compel Plaintiff Smith to respond to a Supplemental
Interrogatory and a Supplemental Request for Production of Documents.  Diaz also seeks sanctions.
No opposition has been filed.
Legal Standard
A party must respond to interrogatories within 30 days
after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subd.(a).) If a party to whom
interrogatories are directed does not provide a timely response, the propounding
party may move for an order compelling response to the interrogatories. (Id.,
§ 2030.290, subd. (b).) There is no time limit for a motion to compel initial
responses, and no meet and confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2030.290;
Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants
(2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In
addition, a party who fails to provide a timely response generally waives all
objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.290, subd. (a).) 
When a party moves to compel initial responses to
interrogatories, “the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the motion], unless it finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd.
(c).)
A party must respond to requests for production of documents
within 30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260, subd.(a).) If a
party to whom requests for production of documents are directed does not
provide timely responses, the requesting party may move for an order compelling
response to the demand. (Id., § 2031.300, subd. (b).) There is no time
limit for a motion to compel initial responses, and no meet and confer efforts
are required. (See id., § 2031.300; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting,
Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.)
Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who
fails to provide a timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a).) 
When a party moves to compel initial responses to
requests for production, “the court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the motion], unless it finds that
the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that
other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd.
(c).)
In Chapter 7 of the Civil Discovery Act, Code
of Civil Procedure section 2030.030 provides that the court may impose
sanctions “[t]o the extent authorized by the chapter governing any particular
discovery method or any other provision of this title.”  Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010,
subdivision (d), defines “[m]isuses of the discovery process” to include
“[f]ailing to respond to or to submit to an authorized method of
discovery.”  Where a party or attorney
has engaged in misuse of the discovery process, the court may impose a monetary
sanction in the amount of “the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees,
incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.020, subd. (a).)
Discussion
Diaz served Plaintiff Smith with discovery, including a
Supplemental Interrogatory and a Supplemental Request for Production of
Documents, on February 27, 2024. 
(Lawrence Decls., ¶ 4 & Exhs. A.) 
Smith has not responded.  (Id.,
¶ 5.)
Diaz need not show anything more.  The motions to compel are granted.
The requests for sanctions are denied.  The applicable sanctions statutes, Code of
Civil Procedure sections 2030.290, subdivision (c), and 2031.300, subdivision (c),
authorize sanctions against a party, person, or attorney “who unsuccessfully
makes or opposes” the motion to compel. 
Here, no opposition was filed.

The Court GRANTS Defendant Diaz’s motions to compel.
The Court ORDERS Plaintiff Smith to serve a code compliant,
verified, written response, with objection, to Diaz’s Supplemental
Interrogatory within 10 days of notice.
The Court ORDERS Plaintiff Smith to serve a code compliant,
