 Case Number:  23STCV00599    Hearing Date:   September 6, 2024    Dept:  29 Christian v. City of Los Angeles  23STCV00599  Defendants’ Motion for Summary JudgmentTentative Ruling The Motion for Summary Judgment filed by Defendants
Cara A. Bartlett and Blake Bartlett is DENIED.
Background
On January 11, 2023, Bridget Christian
(“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against City of Los Angeles (“City”) and Does 1
through 100 for premises liability and general negligence arising from a trip
and fall occurring on October 15, 2022, on a sidewalk in front of 2630 North
Vermont Avenue.
On February 16, 2023, City filed an answer.
On March 30, 2023, Plaintiff amended the
complaint to name Blake Bartlett and Cara Bartlett as Does 51 and 52.
On June 27, 2023, Blake Bartlett and Cara
Bartlett (collectively “the Bartletts”) filed an answer.
On May 20, 2024, the Bartletts filed this
motion for summary judgment.
Plaintiff filed an opposition and a request for
judicial notice on August 13.
The Bartletts filed a reply (and then a
corrected reply), along with objections to some of Plaintiff’s evidence, on
August 29.
Legal Standard
“The purpose of the law of summary judgment
is to provide courts with a mechanism to cut through the parties’ pleadings in
order to determine whether, despite their allegations, trial is in fact necessary
to resolve their dispute.” (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25
Cal.4th 826, 843.) Code of Civil Procedure section 437c, subdivision (c),
“requires the trial judge to grant summary judgment if all the evidence
submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence’ and
uncontradicted by other inferences or evidence, show that there is no triable
issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment
as a matter of law.” (Adler v. Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7
Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.) “The function of the pleadings in a motion for summary
judgment is to delimit the scope of the issues; the function of the affidavits
or declarations is to disclose whether there is any triable issue of fact
within the issues delimited by the pleadings.” (Juge v. County of Sacramento
(1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 59, 67, citing FPI Development, Inc. v. Nakashima
(1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 367, 381-382.)
 
As to each cause of action as framed by the
complaint, a defendant moving for summary judgment or summary adjudication must
satisfy the initial burden of proof by presenting facts to show “that one or
more elements of the cause of action ... cannot be established, or that there
is a complete defense to the cause of action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd.
(p)(2); see also Aguilar, supra, 25 Cal.4th at pp. 850-851; Scalf
v. D. B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1520.) Once the
defendant has met that burden, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show that
a “triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to the cause of action
or a defense thereto.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2); see also Aguilar,
supra, 25 Cal.4th at pp. 850-851.)
 
A plaintiff or cross-complainant moving for
summary judgment or summary adjudication must satisfy the initial burden of
proof by presenting facts to show “that there is no defense to a cause of
action if that party has proved each element of the cause of action entitling
the party to judgment on the cause of action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd.
(p)(1).) Once the plaintiff or cross-complainant has met that burden, the
burden shift to the defendant or cross-defendant to show that a “triable issue
of one or more material facts exists as to the cause of action or a defense
thereto.” (Ibid.)
 
The party opposing a motion for summary
judgment or summary adjudication may not simply “rely upon the allegations or
denials of its pleadings” but must instead “set forth the specific facts
showing that a triable issue of material fact exists.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
437c, subds. (p)(1) & (p)(2). To establish a triable issue of material
fact, the party opposing the motion must produce substantial responsive
evidence. (Sangster v. Paetkau (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 151, 166.)
 
Courts “liberally construe the evidence in
support of the party opposing summary judgment and resolve doubts concerning
the evidence in favor of that party.” (Dore v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc.
(2006) 39 Cal.4th 384, 389.)
 
Request for Judicial Notice
 
Plaintiff requests that the Court take judicial notice of
California Streets and Highways Code, section 5610 and Los Angeles Municipal
Code section 62.104. This request is GRANTED.
 
Objections to Evidence
 
The Bartletts raise 7 objections to Plaintiff’s evidence. 
Evidence presented in support of, or in opposition to, a
motion for summary judgment must be admissible. (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c,
subd. (d); Perry v.
Bakewell Hawthorne LLC
(2017) 2 Cal.5th 536, 541-43.) The court must “consider all of the evidence set forth in the papers,
except the evidence to which objections have been made and sustained.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (c).)
 
The Court SUSTAINS Objection No. 6, to paragraph 10 of the
Declaration of Phillip Rosescu, as it contains nothing more than legal contentions,
which are not the proper subject of expert testimony.
 
The Court SUSTAINS Objection No. 7, to the City’s
interrogatory responses, as discovery responses may be used only against the
responding party, and the responses contain nothing more than legal
contentions, not facts.  
 
The Court OVERRULES the other objections.
 
Discussion
 
The facts of the accident are not disputed for
purposes of this motion. The accident occurred on October 15, 2022, on the
sidewalk in front of 2630 North Vermont Avenue in Los Angeles. (Defendant’s
Statement of Undisputed Material Facts [“DSUMF”], No. 1.) The accident happened
at night, and there was a dangerous height differential between the sidewalk
slabs that was measured to be between 1¾ and 2¼ inches. (Plaintiff’s Statement
of Additional Material Facts [“PSAMF”], Nos. 17-19.) Plaintiff rolled her ankle
(according to her deposition testimony) or tripped and fell (according to the
complaint) and suffered injuries. (PSAMF, No. 33; Complaint, at p. 4.) 
The Bartletts own the abutting private property
at 2630 North Vermont Avenue. (DSUMF, No. 3.) The sidewalk is located on a
public easement/right of way held by City. (DSUMF, Nos. 2, 5.) 
There is evidence that the dangerous condition
had existed since April 2009. (PSAMF, No. 22, 32; Rosescu Decl., ¶ 11.) The Bartletts
have owned the property abutting the sidewalk since July 31, 2020. (PSAMF, No.
14.)
Plaintiff
alleges a single cause of action for negligence against the Bartletts. (This is
the Second Cause of Action in the complaint. The First Cause of Action, for premises
liability, is asserted only against City and Does 1 through 50, and the
Bartletts were named as Does 51 and 52.) 
The
basic elements of a cause of action for negligence are: (1) the existence of a
legal duty; (2) breach of that
duty; (3) causation; and (4) resulting damages. (Brown v. USA Taekwondo
(2021) 11 Cal.5th 204, 213; Kesner
v. Superior Court (2016) 1
Cal.5th 1132, 1158; Castellon v. U.S. Bancorp (2013) 220
Cal.App.4th 994, 998.) The existence and scope of duty are legal questions
for the court.¿¿(Brown, supra, 11 Cal.5th at p. 213; Annocki¿v.
Peterson Enterprises, LLC¿(2014) 232 Cal.App.4th 32, 36.)
The general rule
governing duty is set forth in Civil Code section 1714: “Everyone is
responsible, not only for the result of his or her willful acts, but also for
an injury occasioned to another by his or her want of ordinary care or skill in
the management of his or her property or person, except so far as the latter
has, willfully or by want of ordinary care, brought the injury upon himself or
herself.” (Civ. Code, § 1714, subd. (a).) This establishes what the California
Supreme Court has described as the “default rule” that every person has a legal
duty “to exercise, in his or her activities, reasonable care for the safety of
others.” (Brown, supra, 11 Cal.5th at p. 214.)
Those who own,
possess, or control property generally have a duty to exercise ordinary care in
managing the property to avoid exposing others to an unreasonable risk of harm.
(Annocki¿v.
Peterson Enterprises, LLC¿(2014) 232 Cal.App.4th 32, 37.) If
a dangerous condition exists, the property owner is “under a duty to exercise
ordinary care either to make the condition reasonably safe for their
[customers’] use or to give a warning adequate to enable them to avoid the
harm.” (Bridgman v. Safeway Stores, Inc. (1960) 53 Cal.2d 443, 446.) 
The
law regarding the liability of landowners with regard to defects or dangerous
conditions on sidewalks abutting their property is well established in numerous
appellate cases. “Under
the common law, a landowner does not have any duty to repair abutting sidewalks
along a public street, and does not owe any duty to pedestrians injured as a
result of a defect in the sidewalks.” (Jordan v. City of Sacramento
(2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 1487, 1490 (citing Schaefer v. Lenahan (1944) 63
Cal.App.2d 324, 325).) By statute, specifically Streets and Highways Code
section 5610, abutting property owners have an obligation to repair defects in
the sidewalk, regardless of whether they created the defects. (See Jones v.
Deeter (1984) 152 Cal.App.3d 798, 803.) Nonetheless, the so-called
“Sidewalk Accident Doctrine” provides that abutting property owners have no
duty to members of the public in tort law, and are not liable to members of the
public, unless the property owner created the defect or exercised dominion or
control over the abutting sidewalk. (Lopez v. City of Los Angeles (2020)
55 Cal.App.5th 244, 255; Jordan, supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1490-91
[Section 5610 “imposes a duty of repair on the abutting property owners for
defects in sidewalks, regardless of who created the defects, but does not of
itself create tort liability to injured pedestrians or a duty to indemnify
municipalities, except where a property owner created the defect or exercised
dominion or control over the abutting sidewalk”]; see also Contreras v. Anderson
(1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 188, 196; Jones, supra, 152 Cal.App.3d at pp.
802-803.)  
Thus, for more than 150 years the general rule has been that “in
the absence of a statute, a landowner is under no duty to maintain in a safe
condition a public street or sidewalk abutting his property.” (Lopez, supra,
55 Cal.App.5th at p. 255.) “[A] person’s ownership or occupancy of property,
without more, is insufficient to impose a duty to maintain abutting, publicly
owned property. (Id. at p. 256; see also Isaacs v.
Huntington Memorial Hospital (1985) 38 Cal.3d 112, 134 [“A defendant
cannot be held liable for the defective or dangerous condition of property
which it did not own, possess, or control.”]; Williams v. Foster (1989) 216
Cal.App.3d 510, 521 [“we are unwilling to find the duty to maintain the
sidewalk established by section 5610 is owed to members of the public in the
absence of clear and unambiguous legislative language, especially in view of
the long-standing judicial determination that abutters ordinarily have no such
duty”].) 
This general
rule of no duty has an important exception: when the abutting property owner
has “exercised control” over the otherwise public property. (Lopez, supra,
55 Cal.App.5th at p. 255.) For this exception to apply, the abutting owner must
take some affirmative action regarding the public property, such as when the
abutting owner has created the hazard or asserted “dominion and control over
the … publicly owned property by effectively treating the property as its own.”
(Id. at p. 256.)
Here, the Bartletts
argue essentially (1) the accident occurred on a sidewalk that was the City’s public
property; (2) as the abutting property owner, they had no duty to Plaintiff or
other members of the public to maintain the sidewalk in a safe condition or to
warn of the dangerous condition (or at least no such duty that can be enforced
through private tort litigation); and (3) they did not cause or contribute to
the dangerous condition or exercise control over the sidewalk where the
accident occurred.
On the first
point, the evidence is undisputed. (DSUMF, No. 2.)
On the second
point, the Bartletts are correct on the law. Under the Sidewalk Accident Doctrine,
they owed no duty to Plaintiff or other members of the public – unless they
caused or contributed to the dangerous condition or exercised control over the
sidewalk. To the extent that Plaintiff presents arguments to the contrary (contending,
for example, that the Bartletts had knowledge of the dangerous condition and breached
their duty to Plaintiff to maintain the sidewalk, to make it safe, or to warn
of the dangerous condition), those arguments lack merit.
On the third
point, the Bartletts met their initial burden, as defendants moving for summary
judgment, of presenting evidence to show that they did not cause or contribute
to the dangerous condition or exercise control over the sidewalk. (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2).) The Bartletts showed that from the time that they acquired
the property in 2020 to the date of the accident, they did not exclude members
of the public from the sidewalk; they did not exercise control over the
sidewalk; they did not perform any construction work on or affecting the
sidewalk; and they did not otherwise damage, modify, or change the condition of
the sidewalk. (DSUMF, Nos. 4, 8.) The Bartletts further presented evidence that
the uplift in the sidewalk was caused by root growth from a tree located on
public property in front of the Roosevelt Municipal Golf Course. (DSUMF, Nos.
10, 12; Stivers Decl., ¶¶ 2, 5, & 10.)
This initial
showing by the moving parties shifts the burden on summary judgment to
Plaintiff to present evidence to show that there are triable, disputed issues
as to one or more material facts. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2).)  
Plaintiff has
done so. Plaintiff has presented evidence that the Bartletts entered and exited
their property in vehicles using the driveway, and in doing so they naturally
crossed the sidewalk. (PSAMF, No. 26; Blake Bartlett Depo., at 19:4-23.) Plaintiff
further presented expert testimony that the concrete of sidewalks becomes weak
when it has voids beneath it from an offset, and even ordinary vehicle use of a
driveway can cause cracking and exacerbate the displacement of the sidewalk
slabs. (PSAMF, Nos. 23-24; Greeley Decl., ¶ 7; Rosescu Decl., ¶ 8.) As a
result, even though the dangerous condition existed long before the Bartletts
became the owners of the abutting property, there is evidence in the record
from which a finder of fact could draw a reasonable inference that the
Bartletts’ ordinary use of their driveway contributed – in at least some material
degree – to the dangerous condition of the sidewalk.
The Court
expresses no views on whether this evidence is strong or weak. In ruling on a
motion for summary judgment, it is not the role of the Court to weigh the
evidence. It is sufficient, to purposes of this motion, for the Court to rule
that there is sufficient evidence in the record, combined with drawing all of
the reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party, that would support a
finding that the Bartletts contributed in at least some way to the existence of
the dangerous condition of the sidewalk. 
As there are
disputed issues of material fact on the issue of whether the conduct of the
Bartletts contributed to the dangerous condition, the Court must deny the
Bartletts’ motion for summary judgment.
Conclusion
The Court DENIES the motion for summary
judgment filed by Blake Bartlet and Cara Bartlett.
Moving party is ordered to give notice.
