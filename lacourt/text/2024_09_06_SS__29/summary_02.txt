And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendants' motion to compel the deposition of the plaintiff, Selma Veli. The plaintiff did not appear for the originally scheduled deposition dates and did not serve an objection to the deposition notice. The defendants properly noticed the plaintiff's deposition and the plaintiff's failure to appear is deemed a misuse of the discovery process. The judge has also granted the defendants' request for sanctions in the amount of $1,272.20, which includes attorney's fees and court reporter costs. The judge has ordered the plaintiff to appear for deposition and give testimony under oath on September 9, 2024, and has ordered the plaintiff and their counsel to pay the sanctions within 30 days of notice.
