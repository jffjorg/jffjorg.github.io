And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the evidence presented by the parties and has found that there are disputed issues of material fact regarding whether the Bartletts contributed to the dangerous condition of the sidewalk. The Bartletts argue that they did not cause or contribute to the condition and that they did not exercise control over the sidewalk. However, the plaintiff presents evidence that the Bartletts' ordinary use of their driveway may have contributed to the condition, and that they had knowledge of the condition but failed to take steps to correct it.

The court finds that the Bartletts have met their initial burden of showing that they did not cause or contribute to the condition, but that the plaintiff has presented sufficient evidence to raise a triable issue of fact regarding the Bartletts' liability. Therefore, the court denies the Bartletts' motion for summary judgment and orders the case to proceed to trial.
