And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the plaintiff's motion to serve the defendant by publication. The plaintiff filed a complaint against the defendant on March 30, 2023, alleging motor vehicle negligence and general negligence arising from an accident on November 24, 2021. The plaintiff has made attempts to serve the defendant at two addresses, but has not yet made a sufficient showing for service by publication. The judge notes that service by publication is a "last resort" and requires a thorough investigation to locate the defendant's whereabouts. The plaintiff has not provided sufficient evidence of all efforts made to locate the defendant's whereabouts, and has not attempted to serve the defendant by notice and acknowledgement, one of the statutorily authorized methods for service. The judge orders the plaintiff to give notice of the denial and notes that the denial is without prejudice to a subsequent motion supported by additional evidence.
