As for the summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on Barreto's motion to deem Plaintiff Wells as having admitted the truth of the matters specified in Requests for Admission, Set Two. The motion is granted, and the Court orders Plaintiff Wells to pay sanctions of $585 to Defendant Barreto within 30 days of notice of this order. The motion was filed after Plaintiff Wells failed to respond to requests for admission served on May 2, 2024. The Judge noted that Plaintiff's failure to respond waived all objections and necessitated the motion. The Court also set sanctions in the amount of $585, calculated based on 1.5 hours of attorney work, multiplied by a reasonable billing rate of $350.00 per hour plus a $60 filing fee.
