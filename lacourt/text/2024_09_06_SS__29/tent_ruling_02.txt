21STCV23499
Motion to Compel Deposition of Plaintiff
Tentative
The motion is granted.The request for sanctions is granted in part.
Background
Selma Veli (“Plaintiff”) filed a
complaint on June 24, 2021, against John Hyun Joo, Karen Kimura Joo
(collectively, “Defendants”), and Does 1 through 50, asserting a cause of
action for negligence arising out of a motor vehicle accident on February 5, 2020.

Defendants filed an answer to the
complaint on July 26, 2023. 
On August 14, 2024, Defendants
filed this motion to compel the deposition of Plaintiff.  Defendants also seek sanctions.
No opposition has been filed.
Legal Standard
“Any party may obtain discovery …
by taking in California the oral deposition of any person, including any party
to the action.”  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2025.010.)  Code of Civil Procedure
sections 2025.210 through 2025.280 provide the requirements for (among other
things) what must be included in a deposition notice, when and where
depositions may be taken, and how and when the notice must be served.  
“The service of a deposition
notice … is effective to require any deponent who is a party to the action or an
officer, director, managing agent, or employee of a party to attend and to
testify, as well as to produce any document, electronically stored information,
or tangible thing for inspection and copying.” 
(Id., § 2025.280, subd. (a).)
Section 2025.410, subdivision (a),
requires any party to serve a written objection at least three days before the
deposition if the party contends that a deposition notice does not comply with
the provisions of sections 2025.210 through 2025.280.
Section 2025.450, subdivision (a),
provides:
“If, after service of a
deposition notice, a party to the action or an officer, director, managing
agent, or employee of a party, or a person designated by an organization
that is a party under Section 2025.230, without
having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails to appear for
examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for¿inspection any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the
deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move for an order compelling
the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the production for inspection of
any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in
the deposition notice.”  
Any such motion to compel must show good
cause for the production of documents and, when a deponent has failed to
appear, the motion must be accompanied “by a declaration stating that the
petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire about the nonappearance.”  (Id., subd. (b).)  
When a motion to compel is
granted, “the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010) in favor of the party who noticed the
deposition and against the deponent or the party with whom the deponent is
affiliated, unless the court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust.”  (Id., § 2025.450, subd. (g)(1).) 
In Chapter 7 of the Civil Discovery Act, section 2023.010,
subdivision (d), defines “[m]isuses of the discovery process” to include
“[f]ailing to respond to or to submit to an authorized method of
discovery.”  Where a party or attorney
has engaged in misuse of the discovery process, the court may impose a monetary
sanction in the amount of “the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees,
incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct.”  (Id., § 2023.030, subd. (a).)
Discussion
Defendants initially noticed Plaintiff’s deposition for March
22, 2024.  (Cao Decl., ¶ 5 & Exh. A.)  Plaintiff’s counsel informed Defendants that
Plaintiff was unavailable on that date. 
(Id., ¶ 6.)  Counsel
engaged in further correspondence about deposition scheduling, but Plaintiff’s
counsel did not provide a date for Plaintiff’s deposition.  (Id., ¶¶ 6-9.)
On April 30, Defendants noticed Plaintiff’s deposition for
June 14.  (Id., ¶ 9 & Exh.
C.)  Plaintiff’s counsel notified
Defendants that Plaintiff would not appear but Plaintiff never served an
objection to the deposition notice, and Plaintiff did not appear on June
14.  (Id., ¶¶ 10-11.)
Defendants do not need to show anything more.  They properly noticed Plaintiff’s deposition,
Plaintiff did not object, and Plaintiff did not appear.  The motion to compel is granted.
Defendants’ request for sanctions is granted in part.  The Court is granting Defendants’ motion, the
conduct of Plaintiff is not substantially justified, and the imposition of
sanctions would not be unjust.  In light
of the relatively straightforward nature of this motion, the Court sets
sanctions in the amount of $1,272.20, calculated based on three hours of
attorney time, multiplied by counsel’s reasonable billing rate of $250 per
hour, plus $522.20 in court reporter costs. 
(See id., ¶¶ 11, 14 & Exh. E.)
Conclusion
The Court GRANTS Defendants’ motion to compel.
The Court ORDERS Plaintiff to appear for deposition and give
testimony under oath on September 9, 2024, at 10:00 am, 1851 East First Street,
Suite 835, Santa Ana, California.

The Court ORDERS Plaintiff and counsel of record, the Law
Offices of D. Hess Panah & Associates, jointly and severally, to pay

Defendants within 30 days of notice.
The Court ORDERS Defendants to give notice by electronic service
by no later than 4:00 pm today, September 6, 2024.
