Defendant Barreto’s Motion for Order Deeming Plaintiff to Have Admitted the
Truth of the Matters Specified in Requests for Admission
Tentative
The motion is granted.
Background
On February 25, 2022, Talbot Louis Wells
(“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against PIH Health Downey Hospital (“PIH”),
Juan Jose Macias Barreto (“Barreto”), and Does 1 to 100 for (1) assault, (2)
battery, (3) infliction of emotional distress, (4) negligence, and (5)
negligent hiring, supervision, and retention causes of action arising from a
physical altercation occurring on March 15, 2020.
On May 19, 2022, PIH filed an answer to the complaint.
On January 18, 2023, Plaintiff amended the
complaint to name Allied Universal Security Services Universal Protection
Service LPP as Doe 1. On February 21, 2023, Plaintiff amended the complaint to
name Allied Barton Security Services LP as Doe 2. 
On March 27, 2023, Defendant
Universal Protection Service LP dba Allied Universal Security Services,
erroneously served as Allied Barton Security Services LP (“Universal”),
filed an answer and cross-complaint.
On June 20, 2023, Barreto filed an answer to the complaint.
On April 30, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel was
relieved as counsel. 
On August 1, 2024, Barreto filed this motion for
an order deeming Plaintiff to have admitted the truth of the matters specified
in Requests for Admission, Set Two. 
No opposition has been filed. 
Legal Standard
 
A party must
respond to requests for admission within 30 days after service. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.250, subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests for admission are directed
does not provide a timely response, the propounding party “may move for an
order that … the truth of [the] matters specified in the requests be deemed
admitted.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).) There is no time
limit for such a motion, and no meet and confer efforts are required. (See id.,
§ 2033.280; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement
be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who fails to provide a
timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (a).) 
The court “shall”
make the order that the truth of the matters specified in the request be deemed
admitted unless the court “finds that the party to whom the requests for
admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a
proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial
compliance with Section 2033.220.”  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c); see St. Mary v. Super. Ct. (2014)
223 Cal.App.4th 762, 778-780.)
“It is mandatory
that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a
timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion [to deem
admitted the truth of the matters specified in the requests for admission].”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd.
(c).)
In Chapter 7 of
the Civil Discovery Act, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010, subdivision
(d), defines “[m]isuses of the discovery process” to include “[f]ailing to
respond to or to submit to an authorized method of discovery.”  Where a party or attorney has engaged in
misuse of the discovery process, the court may impose a monetary sanction in
the amount of “the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by
anyone as a result of that conduct.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (a).)
Discussion
On May 2, 2024, Barreto served
Plaintiff with Requests for Admission, Set Two. (Baghdassarian Decl., ¶ 3 &
Exh. 1.) Plaintiff has not responded. (Id., ¶ 5.)
 
No opposition has been filed. 
 
Barreto need not show anything more.  The motion is granted.
 
The request for sanctions is granted
in part.  Plaintiff’s failure to serve a
timely response to the requests for admission necessitated this motion.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)  Given the relatively straightforward nature
of the motion, the Court sets sanctions in the amount of $585, calculated based
on 1.5 hours of attorney work, multiplied by reasonable billing rate of $350.00
per hour plus $60 filing fee.  (Baghdassarian
Decl., ¶ 6.)
 
Conclusion
 
The Court GRANTS Defendant Juan Jose
Macias Barreto’s Motion.

Louis Wells is DEEMED TO HAVE ADMITTED the truth of the matters specified in
Requests for Admission, Set Two, propounded by Defendant Juan Jose Macias Barreto.
 
The Court ORDERS Plaintiff Talbot
Louis Wells to pay sanctions of $585 to Defendant Juan Jose Macias Barreto within
30 days of notice of this order.
