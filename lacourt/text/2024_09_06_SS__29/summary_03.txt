And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted defendant Angelica Bianca Diaz's motions to compel plaintiff Lloyd Smith to respond to a supplemental interrogatory and a supplemental request for production of documents. The motions were filed on August 6, 2024, and no opposition was filed. The judge has denied Diaz's requests for sanctions.

The judge's ruling is based on California Code of Civil Procedure sections 2030.260, 2030.290, 2031.260, and 2031.300, which require parties to respond to discovery requests within a certain timeframe. Smith failed to respond to Diaz's discovery requests, which included a supplemental interrogatory and a supplemental request for production of documents, served on February 27, 2024.

The judge has ordered Smith to serve a code-compliant, verified, written response, with objection, to Diaz's supplemental interrogatory and supplemental request for production within 10 days of notice. The judge has also denied Diaz's requests for sanctions, as no opposition was filed.
