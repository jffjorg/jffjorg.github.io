And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the plaintiff's motion for relief from waiver of jury trial. The plaintiff, Amayel Garfias, filed a complaint against the County of Los Angeles and Deputy Miguel Leon, alleging assault and battery, negligence, interference with civil rights, and harassment and hostile work environment. The plaintiff's complaint included a demand for a jury trial, but the defendant Miguel Leon filed an answer and the County of Los Angeles filed an answer without mentioning jury trial. The plaintiff later filed a notice of posting jury fees and then filed this motion for relief from waiver of jury trial.

The judge notes that the primary statute addressing waiver of a jury trial is Code of Civil Procedure Section 631, which allows a party to waive their right to a jury trial by not timely posting jury fees. However, the California Supreme Court has also held that a court may, in its discretion, allow a trial by jury despite a waiver, as long as it does not result in hardship to other parties or the court.

In this case, the plaintiff's motion was untimely served, and the hearing on the motion is continued. The judge will consider the timeliness of the request, whether the requester is willing to comply with applicable requirements for payment of jury fees, and the reasons supporting the request. The judge will also consider whether granting relief from waiver would result in any hardship to other parties or to the court.
