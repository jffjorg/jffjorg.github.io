MOTION TO DEEM REQUESTS FOR ADMISSIONS, SET
ONE, ADMITTED
Hearing Date: 5/21/24 
CASE NO./NAME: 22STCV22034 STATE FARM vs
JUSTIN PARKER, et al.
Moving Party: Plaintiff
Responding Party: Defendant Justin Parker
Notice: Sufficient 
Ruling: MOTION TO DEEM REQUESTS FOR
ADMISSIONS, SET ONE, ADMITTED IS GRANTED.
 
On May 15, 2023,
Plaintiff State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company served Defendant
Justin Parker with its Request for Admissions, Set One.  Numerous extensions were requested and
granted, with the final extension permitting responses to be served by November
30, 2023. On November 29, 2023, Defendant served responses to Plaintiff's
Request for Admissions, Set One. However the responses were unverified. On
January 16, 2024, Plaintiff sent a letter to Defendant requesting the
verifications. As of February 15, 2024, the date in which the motion was filed,
no verified responses have been served. Plaintiff now moves the Court to deem
the contents of its Request for Admissions, Set One, admitted.
Although Defendant served responses to the
Request for Admissions, Set One, before the November 30, 2023 deadline, the
responses are unverified. Unverified responses are equivalent to no responses
at all. (Appleton v. Superior Court (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 632, 636.)
Defendant did not file an opposition or any other documents showing that the
verifications were served prior to the hearing. The Court has also examined the
responses and finds that they do not consist solely of objections. Therefore,
the motion is GRANTED. Plaintiff does not request sanctions.
