And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the motions to compel initial responses to form interrogatories and special interrogatories on Defendant Wilson Summit, Defendant Subdivision Management, and Defendant Gwen Tibbs. The plaintiff had propounded these requests on January 31, 2024, and the defendants failed to respond in a timely manner. The plaintiff granted multiple extensions beyond the initial due date of March 5, 2024, and finally filed motions to compel on April 11, 2024. The court finds that the plaintiff's urgency in requesting the discovery responses is understandable given the trial preference and the discovery cutoff date set for June 15, 2024. The court reduces the sanction amount to $1750 for all five motions and orders the defendants to pay this amount within 20 days.
