CASE NO./NAME: 22STCV21451 IAN ANDREW
CRANE-EDWARDS vs LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL
Moving Party: Defendant Los Angeles Unified
School District
Responding Party: Unopposed 
Notice: Sufficient¿ 
Ruling: MOTION TO CONTINUE TRIAL IS GRANTED
 
On July 1, 2022,
Plaintiff filed the present case. The trial is currently scheduled for June 27,
2024. Defendant filed the present motion, containing a joint stipulation by the
parties to continue the trial to sometime in October 2024. The reason for this
continuance is to allow the parties to prepare for and attend a mediation set
for July 3, 2024, and to prepare for trial afterward that mediation should the
mediation fail.  The Court is not willing
to continue the matter 100+ days; the parties should have planned mediation
consistent with the trial date, which, pursuant to Rules of Court and case law,
is intended to be firm.  However, considering
the age of the case, the fact that only one prior continuance has been granted,
and the parties' joint stipulation, the Court as an accommodation to counsel
and the parties, will grant an approximate 45-day continuance.
The new trial date will be August __, 2024, at 8:30 a.m.  Pursuant to the stipulation of the parties, all
pretrial deadlines are to follow the new trial date.  The Final Status
Conference is continued to _______, at 10:00 a.m.
