FOR PRODUCTION, SET ONE, AND REQUESTS FOR SANCTIONS
Hearing Date: 5/20/24 
CASE NO./NAME: 23STCV16729 CESAR ALDANA REYES,
et al. vs ALAN D. RUCK
Moving Party: Defendant Alan Ruck
Responding Party: Unopposed
Notice: Sufficient 
Ruling: MOTION TO COMPEL INITIAL REPSONSES TO
REQUESTS FOR PRODUCTION, SET ONE, AND REQUESTS FOR SANCTIONS ARE GRANTED.
 
Background
On December 21, 2023,
Defendant Alan D. Ruck served Plaintiff Cesar Reyes with Request for
Production, Set One. Plaintiff failed to produce responsive documents by the
statutory deadline. Defendant gave Plaintiff several extensions. By April 19,
2024, when the present motion was filed, Defendant had not received the
discovery responses at issue. No opposition was filed.
 
Legal Standard
A defendant may make a demand for
production of documents and propound interrogatories without leave of court at
any time. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.020, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.020,
subd. (a).) The demand for production of documents is not limited by number,
but the request must comply with the formatting requirements in Code Civ.
Proc., § 2031.030. A party may propound 35 specially prepared
interrogatories that are relevant to the subject matter of the pending action
and any additional number of official form interrogatories that are relevant to
the subject matter of the pending action. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.030, subd.
(a)(1) - (a)(2).)
¿¿ 
The party whom the request is
propounded upon is required to respond within 30 days after service of a
demand, but the parties are allowed to informally agree to an extension and
confirm any such agreement in writing. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260, subd. (a);
Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.270, subd. (a)
- (b); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.270, subd. (a) - (b).)
¿¿ 
If a party fails to timely respond
to a request for production or interrogatories, the party to whom the request
is directed waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings under
Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.230, and waives any objection, including one based on
privilege or on the protection for work product. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300,
subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).)¿¿The party propounding the
discovery requests may move for an order compelling responses. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (b); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (b).) Unlike a motion to compel further discovery responses, a
motion to compel initial discovery responses does not have any meet and confer
requirements.
¿ 
Code of Civil Procedure section
2023.030, subdivision (a) provides, in pertinent part, that the court may
impose a monetary sanction on a party engaging in the misuse of the discovery
process to pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by
anyone as a result of that conduct. A misuse of the discovery process includes
failing to respond or submit to an authorized method of discovery. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (d).)¿¿A court has discretion to fix the amount of reasonable
monetary sanctions. (Cornerstone Realty Advisors, LLC v. Summit Healthcare
Reit, Inc. (2020) 56 Cal.App.5th 771, 791.)
¿¿¿¿ 
Analysis
 
It is undisputed that Plaintiff
did not serve timely initial discovery responses. No opposition was filed, nor
were any other documents showing that discovery responses had been served prior
to the hearing. Thus, the present motion to compel is GRANTED, and Plaintiff is
ORDERED to submit verified discovery responses without objections within 20
days from today.
Plaintiff’s non-responsiveness
prompted Defendant to file the present motion and incur attorney’s fees.
Defendant requests sanctions in the amount of $455.00, which the Court finds
reasonable. Consequently, the Court sanctions Plaintiff in the amount of $455.
Plaintiff and his counsel are ORDERED, jointly and severally, to pay sanctions
of $455 to Defendant within 20 days of today’s date.
