Background
On January 31, 2024, Plaintiff propounded Form
Interrogatories (Set One) and Special Interrogatories (Set One) on Defendant
Wilson Summit. On the same day, Plaintiff propounded Form Interrogatories (Set
One) and Special Interrogatories (Set One) on Defendant Subdivision Management,
and
Form Interrogatories (Set One) on Defendant Gwen Tibbs. Defendants Tibbs,
Wilson Summit and Subdivision Management are all represented by the same
defense counsel. The five discovery responses at issue were due by March 5, 2024. After a series of
extensions granted by Plaintiff, the final deadline was set for March 29, 2024.
When no responses were provided by that date, Plaintiff communicated to
Defendants that it had until April 3, 2024, before Plaintiff would file motions
to compel. On April 11, 2024, Plaintiff moved the Court to compel responses to
the discovery requests at issue after receiving no discovery responses.
 
Defendants filed an opposition, arguing that
discovery responses had been provided prior to the hearing. In the reply,
Plaintiff does not contest this. Thus, the present motions are MOOT.
 
Defendants argued that sanctions are not
warranted because it acted with substantial justification. However, the record
reveals that Plaintiff granted multiple extensions beyond the initial due date
of March 5 and clearly informed Defendants that a motion would be filed if no
responses were received by April 3. Plaintiff's urgency in requesting the
discovery responses is understandable given the trial preference and the
discovery cutoff date set for June 15, 2024. When Plaintiff did not receive any
discovery responses by the communicated deadline, he filed the motion eight
days later. The argument by defense counsel that a longer extension might
typically be expected does not constitute substantial justification. Plaintiff
is not obligated to grant any extension and may, under statute, move to compel
immediately after not receiving responses. Defendants should not expect
Plaintiff to provide extensions that Plaintiff is not obligated to give. Having
said that, the Court acknowledges that Defendants had to provide discovery
responses to eight sets of discovery within a shorter timeframe then would
typically be expected for the amount of discovery at issue. The Court exercises
its discretion and reduces the sanction amount to $1750 for all five motions.
Consequently, Defendants and its counsel are ORDERED, jointly and severally, to
pay sanctions of $1750 to Plaintiff within 20 days of today’s date.
