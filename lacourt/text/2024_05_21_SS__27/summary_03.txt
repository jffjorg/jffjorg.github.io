And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's motion to compel initial responses to form interrogatories and requests for production, and to deem the contents of the plaintiff's requests for admissions admitted. The defendant did not serve timely initial discovery responses, and the plaintiff has incurred attorney's fees as a result. The court orders the defendant to submit verified responses to the plaintiff's requests for production and form interrogatories without objections within 20 days. The court also deems the contents of the plaintiff's requests for admissions admitted. The court sanctions the defendant in the amount of $1500.
