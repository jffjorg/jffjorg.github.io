And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to compel the deposition of the defendant's person most knowledgeable, as the defendant failed to serve a written objection to the notice of deposition and did not appear for the deposition on the noticed date. The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to compel the production of documents, as the moving papers failed to show good cause for the production of the documents sought. The judge has also ordered sanctions against the defendant and its counsel in the amount of $1500 to be paid within 30 days, as the defendant's person most knowledgeable did not appear for the deposition and the defendant did not provide prior notice of the transfer of the person most knowledgeable to the jail system.
