And here is the English-text summary of the Tentative Ruling:

The court has issued a tentative ruling denying the motion to designate the matter as complex. The court found that the case does not present novel legal issues that would require exceptional judicial management. The court also found that the case does not involve a large number of witnesses or a substantial amount of documentary evidence that would require extraordinary judicial management. The court noted that the case involves alleged negligence by the LAPD and DCFS within a short timeframe and does not believe the case requires exceptional judicial management. The court also noted that the Personal Injury Hub is being phased out and that Department 27 will likely morph into an Independent Civil court during the pendency of the case.
