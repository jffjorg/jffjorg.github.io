BACKGROUND
Plaintiffs Aisha Jeter, Daniel Ernan Jacob Jeter, and Elijah
David Massey (by and through his guardian ad litem) filed a First Amended
Complaint (FAC) against defendants 6325 8th Avenue, LLC and Malin Asset
Management, Inc. (Defendants) on August 16, 2024, for (1) negligence, (2)
intentional infliction of emotional distress, (3) breach of the implied
warranty of habitability, (4) tortious breach of same, (5) private nuisance,
(6) breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, (7) violation of Civil Code
section 1942.4, (8) unfair business practices, and (9) premises liability. 
As alleged in the FAC, Defendants own or manage a
residential rental property located at 6325 8th Ave., Los Angeles 90043 (“the
Property”). Plaintiffs have rented Apartment 5 on the Property (“the Unit”)
since September 23, 2020. During Plaintiffs’ tenancy, their Unit has suffered
from vermin infestation, dampness, moisture, and mold, defective plumbing,
defective smoke detectors, unsealed windows, and crumbling walls, floors, etc.
Plaintiffs complained to Defendants’ agents, but Defendants refused to correct
the poor conditions.
The motion now before the Court is Defendants’ Demurrer with Motion to
Strike (CCP 430.10) 
 
LEGAL STANDARD
When considering demurrers, courts read the allegations
liberally and in context. Wilson v. Transit Authority of City of Sacramento
(1962) 199 Cal.App.2d 716, 720-21. In a demurrer proceeding, the defects must
be apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial notice. Donabedian
v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994. “A demurrer tests the
pleading alone, and not on the evidence or facts alleged.” E-Fab, Inc. v.
Accountants, Inc. Servs. (2007) 153 Cal.App.4th 1308, 1315. As such, courts
assume the truth of the complaint’s properly pleaded or implied factual
allegations. Ibid. However, it does not accept as true deductions,
contentions, or conclusions of law or fact. Stonehouse Homes LLC v. City of
Sierra Madre (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 531, 538. 
Further, the court may, upon a motion, or at any time in its
discretion, and upon terms it deems proper, strike any irrelevant, false, or
improper matter inserted in any pleading. Code Civ. Proc., § 436(a). The court
may also strike all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in
conformity with the laws of this state, a court rule, or an order of the court.
Id., § 436(b). The grounds for a motion to strike are that the pleading
has irrelevant, false, or improper matter, or has not been drawn or filed in
conformity with laws. Id. § 436. The grounds for moving to strike must
appear on the face of the pleading or by way of judicial notice. Id. §
437. 
Leave to amend must be allowed where there is a reasonable
possibility of successful amendment. See Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18
Cal.3d 335, 349 (court shall not “sustain a demurrer without leave to amend if
there is any reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by amendment”);
Kong v. City of Hawaiian Gardens Redevelopment Agency (2002) 108
Cal.App.4th 1028, 1037 (“A demurrer should not be sustained without leave to
amend if the complaint, liberally construed, can state a cause of action under
any theory or if there is a reasonable possibility the defect can be cured by
amendment.”). The burden is on the complainant to show the Court that a
pleading can be amended successfully. Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d
311, 318.
ANALYSIS
Demurrer
Defendants demur to the third, fourth, and sixth cause of
action as to Massey on the grounds that, as a minor, he was not a party to the
lease contract and cannot state claims based on that contract.
Breach of Implied Warranty of Habitability 
Defendants argue that Massey cannot maintain a cause of
action for breach of the Implied Warranty of Habitability because such a claim
is on the lease, which Massey is not a party to.  
“[A] warranty of habitability is implied by law in
residential leases in this state…” Green v. Superior Court of San Francisco
(1974) 10 Cal.3d 616, 637.  
Defendants rely on Family Code section 6701, which states in
relevant part, “A minor cannot … [m]ake a contract relating to real property or
any interest therein.”
Plaintiffs argue that Massey is entitled to bring a claim
for breach of the implied warranty of habitability because he was an intended
third-party beneficiary of the lease.  
‘“California law permits third party beneficiaries to
enforce the terms of a contract made for their benefit.” Spinks
v. Equity Residential Briarwood Apartments (2009) 171 Cal.App.4th 1004,
1021-1022 (Spinks). (quoting, Principal Mutual Life Ins. Co. v.
Vars, Pave, McCord & Freedman (1998) 65 Cal.App.4th 1469, 1485. (Principal
Mutual). “That authority is codified in Civil Code section 1559, which
states: ’A contract, made expressly for the benefit of a third person, may
be enforced by him at any time before the parties thereto rescind it.’”
Ibid. “[C]hildren as third party beneficiaries may enforce the provisions
therein made expressly for their benefit in the same manner as can a party to
the agreement.” Reliance Life Ins. Co. v. Jaffe (1953) 121 Cal.App.2d
241, 244.   
“The test for determining whether a contract was made for
the benefit of a third person is whether an intent to benefit a third person
appears from the terms of the contract. If the terms of the contract
necessarily require the promisor to confer a benefit on a third person, then
the contract, and hence the parties thereto, contemplate a benefit to the third
person.” Johnson v. Holmes Tuttle Lincoln-Mercury, Inc. (1958) 160
Cal.App.2d 290, 297 (citation omitted). “Nevertheless, the third person need
not be named or identified individually to be an express beneficiary. A third
party may enforce a contract if it can be shown that he or she is a member of
the class for whose express benefit the contract was made.” Kaiser Eng’rs v.
Grinnell Fire Prot. Sys. Co. (1985) 173 Cal.App.3d 1050, 1055. 


Here, the lease states that “Occupancy is for 2 Adults and 1
Minor Only.”  FAC ¶ 17, Ex. A at p. 29.
Plaintiffs allege that they informed Defendants that Massey would be living
with them when they entered into the lease agreement. FAC ¶ 16. The lease terms
require Defendants to confer on Massey the benefit of allowing him to occupy
the property.  Moreover, Family Code
section 6701, subdivision (b), concerns only a minor’s ability to make a
contract; it says nothing about their ability to enforce a contract to which
they are a third-party beneficiary. Accordingly, the Court concludes that
Massey has properly alleged that he was a third-party beneficiary to the
lease.  
Furthermore, Defendants ignore that in addition to a
contractual claim, breach of warranty of habitability can also be a statutory
claim. Civil Code section 1941 provides, “The lessor of a building intended for
the occupation of human beings must, in the absence of an agreement to the
contrary, put it into a condition fit for such occupation, and repair all
subsequent dilapidations thereof, which render it untenantable, except such as
are mentioned in section nineteen hundred and twenty-nine.” For a unit to be “untenantable
under section 1941.1 … means that the condition of the premises ‘are not fit
for occupancy or rental.’ McNairy v. C.K. Realty (2007) 150 Cal.App.4th
1500, 1506 (quoting Black’s Law Dict. (6th ed. 1990) p. 1540, col. 1).
Conditions rendering a property untenantable are further enumerated in Civil
Code section 1941.1 which includes violations of Health and Safety Code section
17920.3. Nothing in these statutory provisions limits their scope to those
authorized occupants who signed the lease. 
Because the Court finds that Massey has properly pleaded
that he is a third-party beneficiary, and because his statutory rights do not
depend on privity of contract, the Court finds that Massey can state a claim for
breach of the implied warranty of habitability. Accordingly, the demurrer as to
the third cause of action is overruled. 
Tortious Breach of Implied Warranty 
Defendants make substantially the same argument as to the
tortious breach of implied warranty of habitability claim. 
For the reasons given above, the Court finds that Massey properly
pleaded that he is an intended third-party beneficiary to the lease. 
Additionally, a claim for tortious breach of implied
warranty sounds not in contract but in tort. In Stoiber v. Honeychuck
(1980) 101 Cal.App.3d 903 (Stoiber), the court recognized a cause of
action for tortuous breach of implied warranty of habitability. The court
explained that in Rowland v. Christian (1968) 69 Cal.3d 108, “the
Supreme Court repudiated the traditional trespasser-licensee-invitee
classification of duties of an owner or possessor of land, and substituted in
place of these rigid classifications the basic rule of foreseeability of injury
to others.” Stoiber, supra,101 Cal.App.3d at p. 917. Thus, the issue
is whether Massey’s injury was foreseeable, not whether he had a contract with
Defendants.
Plaintiffs have pled facts sufficient to allege that Massey
was an authorized occupant of the property and that there were habitability
issues with the property due to the unsanitary and unsafe conditions. As such,
Massey may maintain a cause of action for tortious breach of the warranty of
habitability, notwithstanding the fact that he was not a party to the
lease. Accordingly, the demurrer as to the fourth cause of action is
overruled.  
Quiet Enjoyment 
Again, Defendants argue that Massey may not bring an action
for breach of the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment because he is not a party
to the contract.  
“In the absence of language to the contrary, every lease
contains an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment, whereby the landlord impliedly
covenants that the tenant shall have quiet enjoyment and possession of the
premises.”  Andrews v. Mobile Aire
Estates (2005) 125 Cal. App. 4th 578, 588. 
“The implied covenant of quiet enjoyment implies a term in a contract,
and a breach of the covenant gives rise to an action in contract.”  Ginsberg v. Gamson (2012) 205 Cal.
App. 4th 873, 896. A third-party beneficiary is entitled to sue for breach of
the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment. Spinks, supra, 171 Cal.App.4th
at pp. 1035-36. 
In Spinks, the court reversed summary adjudication of
a plaintiff’s breach of quiet title, holding that whether the plaintiff was a
third-party beneficiary to the lease presented a triable issue of fact. Id.
at p. 1036. There, the lease was between the plaintiff’s employer and the
defendant landlord, but evidence showed that the parties intended the plaintiff
to occupy the property. Id. at 1027.
Defendants argue that the lease granted Massey only a
“license” interest – not a tenancy interest. The Court finds this unpersuasive.
By the terms of the lease, all three Plaintiffs were entitled to occupancy, and
no additional language was included, otherwise limiting Massey’s interest in
the property. Massey was not a mere licensee, whom the Defendants
could eject at their discretion. While Defendants are correct that Massey is
not, and legally could not be, a signatory to the lease, the parties’ clear
intent, as alleged in the FAC, was that he occupy the property with his
mother and uncle. As in Spinks, the fact that Massey’s right is
derivative of the parties who signed the lease on his behalf is not
dispositive. Spinks, supra, 171 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1035-36.  Accordingly, the Court overrules the
demurrer as to the sixth cause of action for quiet enjoyment. 
 
 
 
Motion to Strike
Punitive Damage
Defendants argue that Plaintiffs fail to allege sufficient
facts to support their claims for punitive and exemplary damages. Defendants
further argue the FAC fails to specify which defendant engaged in the alleged
conduct. 
To state a prima facie claim for punitive damages, a
complaint must set forth the elements as stated in the general punitive damage
statute, Civil Code Section 3294. College Hospital, Inc. v. Superior Court
(1994) 8 Cal.4th 704, 721. These statutory elements include allegations that
the defendant has been guilty of oppression, fraud, or malice. Civ. Code §
3294, subd. (a). “‘Malice’ means conduct which is intended by the defendant to
cause injury to the plaintiff or despicable conduct which is carried on by the
defendant with a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of
others.” Civ. Code, § 3294 subd. (c)(1).
“In order to survive a motion to strike an allegation of
punitive damages, the ultimate facts showing an entitlement to such relief must
be pled by a plaintiff. In passing on the correctness of a ruling on a motion
to strike, judges read allegations of a pleading subject to a motion to strike
as a whole, all parts in their context, and assume their truth. In ruling on a
motion to strike, courts do not read allegations in isolation.” Clauson v.
Superior Court (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 1253, 1255. (citations omitted). “The
mere allegation an intentional tort was committed is not sufficient to warrant
an award of punitive damages. Not only must there be circumstances of
oppression, fraud or malice, but facts must be alleged in the pleading to
support such a claim.” Grieves v. Superior Ct. (1984) 157 Cal.App.3d
159, 166 (fn. omitted) (citations omitted). A tenant’s habitability action
against the owners for failure to remedy slum living conditions may be
sufficient to support a claim for punitive damages. See, e.g., Stoiber
v. Honeychuck (1980) 101 Cal.App.3d 903, 921 (failure to correct defective
living conditions sufficient for punitive damages claim; Rivera v. Sassoon
(1995) 39 Cal.App.4th 1045, 1046 (affirming general, special, and punitive
damages jury award for breach of the warranty of habitability, nuisance, and
other torts). Punitive damages may be assessed against an employer where the
employer authorized or ratified a malicious act. College Hospital Inc., supra,8
Cal.4th at. p 723.
Plaintiffs pleaded sufficient facts to support their prayer
for punitive damages. They allege that Defendants had actual knowledge of
defective conditions in the premises, including a severe and persistent
cockroach infestation, chronic water leaks that caused damage and mold, a
rodent infestation, and a number of other issues, such as missing window sealant,
defective plumbing, and cracked walls, ceilings, and flooring. FAC ¶ 29. Plaintiffs
specifically allege that Defendants’ conduct was “willful, wanton, intentional,
despicable malicious and initiated with malice and with the intent to knowingly
take advantage of, oppress, and injure Plaintiffs.” FAC ¶¶ 42, 49, 72, 81, 89. While
conclusory allegations are not entitled to a presumption of truth, a jury could
conclude that the alleged conduct was done with malice. Plaintiffs make these
allegations against each Defendant and allege that they authorized, instructed,
and ratified this conduct by their agents and employees. FAC ¶¶ 6, 7, 15, 25,
34. Whether Plaintiffs can prove that each Defendant engaged in such
conduct is not an issue for demurrer. Accordingly, the Court denies the motion
to strike punitive damages. 
CONCLUSION
Defendants’ Demurrer is overruled.  Defendants’ Motion to Strike is Denied. Defendants
have twenty days to answer.
