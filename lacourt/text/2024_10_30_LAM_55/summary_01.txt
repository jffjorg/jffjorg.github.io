And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the defendants' motion for leave to file a first amended cross-complaint. The motion seeks to add an eighth cause of action for declaratory relief to the cross-complaint, which would establish the parties' respective rights to attorney's fees under the lease agreement. The judge finds that the defendants have complied with the requirements of California Rules of Court, rule 3.1324(a) and (b), and that the proposed amendment does not change or delete any allegations, but only adds a new cause of action. The judge also finds that the defendants' delay in seeking leave to amend is not prejudicial to the plaintiffs, as the proposed amendment does not require additional discovery or investigation, and both parties have been aware of their differing interpretations of the lease attorney fee provision for over a year. The judge orders the defendants to file and serve the first amended cross-complaint within 10 days of the order.
