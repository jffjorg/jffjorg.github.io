And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in this case, in which plaintiff Baker is suing defendants Millennium Dance Studios, Ann Marie Hudson, and David Kingsdale for breach of fiduciary duty. The court has reviewed the prior action between the parties and has determined that the prior dismissal of Baker's complaint was not on the merits, and therefore, res judicata does not bar Baker's new claims. The court has also sustained the demurrer to the third cause of action, which is for interference with contract, because the defendants were acting in their capacities as corporate agents in causing Millennium to breach the contract. The court has overruled the demurrer to the second cause of action, which is for breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, because this cause of action is almost always pled and is almost never of any moment. The court has also overruled the demurrer to the declaratory relief cause of action, but has warned that leave to amend may not be granted again. The court has denied the motion to strike punitive damages.
