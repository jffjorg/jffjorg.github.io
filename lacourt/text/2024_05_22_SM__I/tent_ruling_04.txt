 Case Number:  23SMCV03186    Hearing Date:   May 22, 2024    Dept:  I The court is inclined to DENY the application without
prejudice.  There do not appear to be
exigent circumstances such that the matter must be heard without giving Fisher
an opportunity to oppose.  Frankly, it
does not appear that there would be grounds to deny the motion if brought with
notice, but the court believes Fisher ought to have an opportunity to be heard.
 Of course, if defendant will stipulate,
a stipulation and order will suffice.
