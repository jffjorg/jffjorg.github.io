The judge has sustained the demurrer with leave to amend for certain affirmative defenses, including unclean hands, laches, offset, privilege, and excuse. The judge has sustained the demurrer without leave to amend for other affirmative defenses, including failure to state a claim, lack of standing, and failure to mitigate. The judge has overruled the demurrer for certain affirmative defenses, including estoppel and judicial estoppel. The judge has also ruled on the verification of the answer, finding that it complies with the Code of Civil Procedure. The judge has given the defendant 10 court days to amend their answer. The judge suggests that the parties do a better job of meeting and conferring and filing motions that might matter more than this one.
