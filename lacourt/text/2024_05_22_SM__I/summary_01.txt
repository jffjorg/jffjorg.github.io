The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case, stating that the unopposed motion for terminating sanctions against defendant Evyatar Hajaj is continued to June 18, 2024. The judge notes that defendant has shown no intention of participating in the case or obeying court orders, and that defendant's failure to oppose the motion is a shot across the bow indicating a lack of interest in litigating the case. The judge also notes that defendant did eventually provide responses, but they were insufficient and obviously so. The judge is not prepared to strike the answer, but will continue the matter to June 18, 2024, at 9:00 am to be heard with another motion.
