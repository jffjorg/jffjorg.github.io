 Case Number:  22SMCV02822    Hearing Date:   May 22, 2024    Dept:  I The motion is MOOT. 
Plaintiff does not oppose the request for a physical examination.  The issue plaintiff has is one of
scheduling.  Plaintiff asserts that
defendant has set the examination dates unilaterally rather than trying to get
a date upon which the parties can agree. 
The court would suggest that plaintiff provide not less than 10 days in the
near future that would work for an examination, and do so quickly.  Defendant should then pick one of those dates
within a few days of receipt.  That ought
to solve the problem.  The requests for
sanctions are DENIED.  Defendant asked
plaintiff to stipulate and did not get a speedy response, but never picked up
the phone.  Plaintiff says there was no
need for the motion, but did not respond to defendant’s formal request.  The bottom line is that the parties’ mutual failure
to meet and confer renders the opposing sanctions requests without merit.
