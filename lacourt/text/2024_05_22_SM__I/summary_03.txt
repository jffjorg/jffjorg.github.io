And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling addresses five causes of action brought by the plaintiff against the defendant, alleging bad faith denial of insurance benefits, breach of contract, breach of implied covenant, fraud, and negligent infliction of emotional distress. The defendant demurred, arguing that the issues raised in the complaint have been resolved through an arbitration already held. The court grants the defendant's request to take judicial notice of the underlying policy and the arbitration decision. The court sustains the demurrer as to the second and fourth causes of action, but overrules the demurrer as to the third cause of action. The court sustains the demurrer as to the fifth cause of action, granting leave to amend. The court notes that the plaintiff's theory of bad faith is plausible and that the arbitrator did not decide the bad faith issue in the arbitration.
