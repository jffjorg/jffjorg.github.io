And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling is that the motion is moot, as the parties have not been able to agree on a date for a physical examination. The judge suggests that the plaintiff provide a list of dates in the near future that would work for an examination, and the defendant can then choose one of those dates. The judge also denies the requests for sanctions, as both parties failed to meet and confer to resolve the scheduling dispute.
