And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of Connie Chung's motion for summary judgment. The case involves the death of Decedent Tok Hui Till, who was a resident at Eden Manor, an adult residential facility. Connie Chung was the owner of Eden Manor until May 2018, when she sold it to Los Angeles Centers for Alcohol and Drug Abuse, Inc. (LA CADA). LA CADA assumed exclusive ownership, managerial, administrative, and operational control of Eden Manor in May 2018.

The judge found that Connie Chung was not involved in the operation of Eden Manor after May 2018 and that LA CADA was responsible for supervising, training, and disciplining employees. The judge also found that Connie Chung did not owe any duty to Decedent at the time of her death.

The judge rejected the plaintiffs' contention that Connie Chung remained in control of Eden Manor after the Management Agreement took effect and that she is personally liable for Decedent's death. The judge noted that the plaintiffs did not submit any evidence to show that Connie Chung remained in control of Eden Manor after May 2018, and that Connie Chung is not personally liable for Decedent's death.

The judge granted Connie Chung's motion for summary judgment, finding that the plaintiffs have not submitted any evidence that would establish Connie Chung's personal liability for Decedent's death.
