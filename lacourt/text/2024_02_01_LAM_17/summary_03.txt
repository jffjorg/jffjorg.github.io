And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the defendant's motion to transfer the case to another court. The defendant, who is representing herself, sought to transfer the unlawful detainer action to a different court, citing the inconvenience of three witnesses who are located in Northern and Southern California. However, the judge found that the case must be heard in Los Angeles County, as it concerns real property located in that county. Additionally, the judge determined that the defendant has not shown that the interests of justice would be served by transferring the case to provide a more convenient location for the witnesses. As a result, the judge denied the defendant's motion to transfer.
