Summary:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion for summary judgment in this medical malpractice case. The defendant, Providence Health System – Southern California, argued that its conduct fell within the standard of care, and the court agrees. The court finds that the defendant's expert witnesses, Dr. Pitchon and Dr. Kelly, have established that the defendant's conduct was reasonable and that the plaintiff, Ruma Barua, was predisposed to developing an infection due to her underlying health conditions. The court also finds that the plaintiff's expert witness, Dr. Fitzgibbons, is not qualified to opine on nursing care and that his testimony is therefore inadmissible. As a result, the court grants the defendant's motion for summary judgment as to the first cause of action for medical malpractice. The court also grants the defendant's motion for summary judgment as to the second cause of action for loss of consortium, as the loss of consortium claim is dependent on the existence of a cause of action for tortious injury to a spouse, which does not exist in this case.
