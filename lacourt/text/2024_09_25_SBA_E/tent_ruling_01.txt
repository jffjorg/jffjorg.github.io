BACKGROUND
 
            On
December 1, 2023, Plaintiff Anna Crossley filed the Complaint alleging causes
of action for breach of express warranty in violation of the Song-Beverly Act,
breach of implied warranty in violation of the Song-Beverly Act, and Violation
of Section 1739.2 of the Song-Beverly Act against Defendant Jaguar Land Rover
North America LLC.
 
            On January 17, 2024,
Plaintiff served the Request for Documents, Set One on Defendants. (Kohanoff
Decl. ¶ 16.)
 
            On February 20, 2024,
Defendant responded to the Request for Documents, Set One. (Kohanoff Decl. ¶ 16.)
 
            On July 9, 2024,
Defendant served supplemental responses to Plaintiff’s Request for Documents,
Set One.
            
LEGAL STANDARD
 
            The propounding party
may file motions to compel further responses to requests for production if it
believes the responses received are (1) evasive, (2) incomplete, or (3) if the
objections raised are meritless or overly general. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310,
subd. (a).) In response to a motion to compel further responses, the respondent
bears the burden of justifying any objections. (Fairmont Ins. Co. v.
Superior Court (2000) 22 Cal.4th 245, 255.)
 
DISCUSSION 
 
The Court finds
that Plaintiff satisfied the meet and confer requirements as evidenced by
Plaintiff’s counsel’s declaration, wherein he states that he met and conferred
with Defendant on February 23, 2024, and March 5, 2024, regarding the Request for
Documents, Set One, and received
no response. (Kohanoff Decl. ¶ 21.)
 
 Plaintiff
alleges that Defendant breached the express written warranty, the implied
warranty of merchantability, and violated California’s Song-Beverly Consumer
Warranty Act by failing to repair Plaintiff’s 2020 Land Rover Ranger Rover
Evoque (“Subject Vehicle”) despite repeated attempts, specifically regarding
USB and connectivity issues. Plaintiff claims Defendant knew about these
defects and its inability to repair them but willfully refused to repurchase
the vehicle, thus violating the Act.
 
On January
17, 2024, Plaintiff propounded
RFP, Set One. Plaintiff requested several categories of documents, including:
 
1.     Documents related to the subject vehicle (RFP’s
1-14).
2.     Documents related to Defendant’s warranty and
repurchase policies, procedures, and practices (RFP’s 15-29).
3.     Documents related to Defendant’s knowledge of the
same or similar defects in other vehicles of the same year, make, and model
(RFP’s 30-31).
 
Plaintiff argues
that Defendant has not complied with California’s discovery rules in responding
to the RFP’s by using nearly identical boilerplate objections for the vast
majority of requests, which Plaintiff claims do not meet the specificity
requirements in the Code of Civil Procedure. (Motion to Compel “MTC” 7; Code
Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (a); see Korea Data Sys. Co. v. Super. Ct.
(1997) 51 Cal.App.4th 1513, 1516.) The objections can
be summarized as follows: 
 
Defendant argues
that Plaintiff is requesting documents irrelevant to the key issue: whether the
vehicle in question met specifications and whether Defendant repaired it. The
defendant contends that requests for documents related to other customers'
vehicles or complaints are excessive and unnecessary. Additionally, Defendant
has agreed to produce certain policies and procedures under a protective order
but objects to the broader scope of requests. Defendant also contends that
Plaintiff’s requests are vague and ambiguous.
 
Furthermore,
Defendants argue that Plaintiff is requesting documents that are subject to
attorney work product doctrine and/or contain trade secrets and/or proprietary,
confidential business information. Last, Defendant argues that Plaintiff is
requesting Documents which are equally available to both parties.
 
Plaintiff argues
that Defendant’s objections, claiming the discovery requests are
"overbroad," "equally available," or "unduly
burdensome," lack merit. Plaintiff points out that the defendant has not
provided specific evidence to support these objections and that the discovery
requests are limited to Defendant’s internal policies, procedures, and
guidelines concerning vehicle repurchase or compensation under the Song-Beverly
Consumer Warranty Act. (Separate Statement p. 7; Josephs v. Harris Corp. (1982) 677 F.2d 985, 992.)  Regarding the "equally available"
objection, the plaintiff contends that it only applies when the requested
information can be obtained from third-party sources, which is not the case
here, as the requests involve the defendant’s internal, non-public documents.
(Separate Statement p. 7.) As for the "unduly burdensome" objection, Plaintiff
notes that such claims must be supported by evidence showing the specific tasks
and hours required to respond, general statements about burden or expense are
insufficient. (Separate Statement p. 8; Coriell v. Super. Ct. (1974) 39
Cal.App.3d 487, 492-493.)
 
Plaintiff also
argues that Defendant’s objections, claiming the discovery requests are “vague
and ambiguous,” are without merit. Plaintiff asserts that the documents
requested have been clearly identified, and if there was any confusion,
Defendant should have sought clarification during the meet and confer process.
(Separate Statement 8; Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 771, 783.)
 
Furthermore,
Plaintiff argues that Defendant's objection based on confidentiality is
improper because Plaintiff’s counsel typically provides the Los Angeles
Superior Court Confidential Protective Order for execution. If Defendant
believes that the requested information is confidential, proprietary, or a
trade secret, the proper response would have been to file a motion for a
protective order under the Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.060,
subdivision (b), rather than objecting on confidentiality grounds. Additionally, Defendant has not
provided any justification for why the requested documents involve confidential
or proprietary information. (Separate Statement p. 10.)
 
Last, Plaintiff
argues that Defendant's objections based on Attorney-Client Privilege or Work
Product Doctrine are deficient because Defendant has failed to provide any
facts that would allow other parties or the court to evaluate the merit of its
claim. (Separate Statement p. 11; Korea Data Systems Co. v. Superior Court,
supra, 51 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1516-1517.)
 
In opposition, Defendant
argues that Plaintiff has not met the legal requirement to show "good
cause" for their discovery requests, as mandated by the Code of Civil
Procedure section 2031, subdivision (b)(1). Defendant claims Plaintiff’s
requests are overly broad and seek irrelevant information, specifically
documents unrelated to whether Defendant properly repaired Plaintiff's vehicle
within a reasonable number of opportunities. (Opposition p. 4.) Defendant argues that
Plaintiff’s requests are irrelevant, as they pertain to other vehicles or
customer complaints, which are not mentioned in Plaintiff’s complaint.
(Opposition p. 8; Calcor Space Facility, Inc. v. Sup. Ct. (1997) 53
Cal.App.4th 216, 225-226.) Defendant agrees to provide documents related to
policies and procedures related to how Defendant handles customer complaints
and repurchase requests but only under a protective order. (Opposition p. 6.)
 
Furthermore,
Defendant argues that the cases Plaintiff cites for sufficiency of evidence do
not address discovery or whether documents related to other vehicles or
repurchase policies were sought during discovery. Therefore, these cases are
irrelevant to the current discovery dispute. (Opposition pp. 7-8.)   Plaintiff
further cites cases to argue that discovery of documents related to defects in
other vehicles is relevant. However, Defendant notes that these cases do not
show that the manufacturer raised any relevancy objections during discovery.
Defendant argues that if relevancy objections had been timely raised in these
cases, the outcomes could have been different, but courts do not speculate on
unraised issues. (Opposition pp. 8-9.)
 
Last, Defendant
argues that its objections based on privacy and proprietary information are
valid, as Plaintiff's complaint does not mention other vehicles or purchasers.
Defendant highlights the intrusive nature of Plaintiff's requests, specifically
Request No. 30, which seeks all documents related to similar customer
complaints about other 2020 Land Rover Range Rover Evoque vehicles. These
documents would likely include personal information, such as addresses and
phone numbers, of unrelated individuals. Defendant contends that Plaintiff has
no legitimate claim to such private information, and their interest in
assessing vehicle repairs does not outweigh the privacy rights of other
customers, especially since the complaint only involves Plaintiff's vehicle.
(Opposition p. 10.)
 
  The Court finds that discovery requests
related to repair orders, invoices, and communications between the dealer, factory
representative, or call center regarding the subject vehicle are entitled to
further response. This includes requests 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and
31. In Donlen and Kwan, the Court of Appeal found that
information regarding the vehicle at issue is admissible as it is necessary to
prove Defendant’s knowledge of a defect and attempts to repair the defects. Repair orders, invoices, and communications between
the dealer,
factory representative, or call center fall squarely within the information
found admissible in these cases. (See Donlen v. Ford Motor Co. (2013)
217 Cal.App.4th 138, 154-155;
Kwan
v. Mercedes Benz of North America, Inc. (1995) 23 Cal.App.4th 174, 185.) While the
defense argues that these cases go to admissibility and not relevance, for a
fact to be admissible, it must first be relevant. (Evid. Code, § 350.)
 
The Court finds that all discovery requests related to the warranty
policy and procedure manual published by Defendant and provided to its
authorized repair facilities within the State of California from the date of
purchase of the subject vehicle to the present are entitled to further
responses. This includes requests 5, 8, 23, 24, 25, 28, and 29. This
information has been found relevant to cases under the Song-Beverly Act to show
whether the decision to repair or repurchase the vehicle was made in good faith.
(See Kwan, supra, 23 Cal.App.4th at p. 186; Oregel v. American Isuzu
Motors, Inc. (2001)
90 Cal.App.4th 1094, 1104-1105.) Again, while Defendant argues that these cases go to admissibility and
not relevance, for a fact to be admissible, it must first be relevant. (Evid.
Code, § 350.)
 
Last,
the Court finds all discovery requests related to policies and procedures used
to evaluate customer complaints relating to defects alleged in Plaintiff's
complaint in vehicles purchased in California of the same year, make and model
as the subject vehicle, and policies and procedures used to evaluate customer requests for
repurchase pursuant to the Song-Beverly Consumer Warrant Act, from the date of
purchase to the present. This includes requests 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, and 22.
Courts have found this information to be relevant for finding whether Defendant
lacked good faith and responded to requests to repair or repurchase the subject
vehicle. (See Kwan, supra, 23 Cal.App.4th at p. 186; Oregel, supra, 90
Cal.App.4th at pp. 1104-1105.) The requests were neither vague nor ambiguous
because all requests were understandable, and any confusion could have been
worked out during a meet and confer. Furthermore, Defendant has provided no
evidence to show that any request would be protected by any privilege or trade
secret, nor has Defendant proven that any request is available to Plaintiff.
 
However, the Court
finds requests 2 and 30 to be overly broad in that they seek information beyond
what is necessary or relevant to the specific claims at issue. Request 2 seeks
any information relating to any affirmative defense raised by Defendant, which
is overly broad, and Request 30 seeks any electronic information regarding
similar defects in 2022 Volkswagen Atlas vehicles, which are not at issue here.

 
Thus, the Court
GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion to compel further responses to requests 1, 3, 4, 5,
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26,
27, 28, 29, and 31 and DENIES as to requests 2 and 30.
