And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the defendants' motion to quash service of summons for lack of personal jurisdiction regarding three foreign companies: Beauty and Beyond Galleria, Inc., Beauty Bargains, Inc., and Beauty Bargains, Inc. These companies are incorporated in Alabama, Louisiana, and Texas, respectively, and have no contacts with California, including no employees, offices, or business operations in the state. The companies do not solicit business, sell products or services, or own any property in California, and have no plans to leave their respective states of incorporation. The court finds that it does not have specific or general jurisdiction over these companies, and therefore grants the motion to quash service of summons.
