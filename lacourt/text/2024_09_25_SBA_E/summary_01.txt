Summary of the tentative ruling:

The court has granted plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to most of the requests for production of documents, finding that defendant's objections lack merit. The court has denied the motion as to requests 2 and 30, finding them to be overly broad. The court has found that plaintiff satisfied the meet and confer requirements and that defendant's objections to the discovery requests are unfounded. The court has also found that defendant's objections based on confidentiality are improper. The court has ordered defendant to provide further responses to the discovery requests, which will aid in the discovery of relevant information for the case.
