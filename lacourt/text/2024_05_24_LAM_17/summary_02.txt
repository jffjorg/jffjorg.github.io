And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the defendants' demurrer is overruled as to the first and second causes of action, but sustained, without leave to amend, as to the third cause of action. The plaintiff alleges that the defendants failed to provide medical records, which is a recognized cause of action under Health and Safety Code Section 123110 (k)(1) and (b)(1). The defendants argue that there is no recognized cause of action for failure to provide medical records, but the court finds that the defendants' motion does not contain any substantive legal analysis to support this argument. The court also finds that the plaintiff's intentional infliction of emotional distress cause of action is procedurally improper and insufficiently pled, and therefore sustains the demurrer to this cause of action.
