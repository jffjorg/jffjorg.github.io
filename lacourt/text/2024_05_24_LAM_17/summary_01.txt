Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has sustained the demurrers of the Meier Defendants and LA Peer Surgery Defendants, with 15 days leave to amend. The court has also struck the IIED claim from the First Amended Complaint (FAC). The court finds that the Plaintiff has failed to comply with the mandatory statute CCP §377.32 and has failed to allege sufficient facts to show he has standing to pursue this claim as a representative of the Estate of Mahzar Sedghi. The court also finds that the Plaintiff's allegations are insufficient to support the claims against LA Peer Surgery. The court notes that the Plaintiff's allegations are sufficient to state a claim as to the first and second causes of action against the Meier Defendants, but the Plaintiff must allege facts which could show he has standing to pursue this claim.
