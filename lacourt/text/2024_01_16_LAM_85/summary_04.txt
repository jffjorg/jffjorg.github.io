And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

This tentative ruling addresses various issues raised by LEAP and DOE in their filings. Specifically, the judge notes that LEAP failed to lodge a courtesy copy of its opposition, in violation of the Presiding Judge's First Amended General Order. Furthermore, the judge finds that LEAP's Petition contains a typographical error and that LEAP failed to request judicial notice of a relevant webpage.

The judge also addresses LEAP's demurrer to DOE's demurrer, finding that LEAP's failure to exhaust its administrative remedies bars its contention that it substantially complied with the agreement. Additionally, the judge notes that DOE's calculation of the appeal delay was incorrect and that LEAP's breach of contract claim may be subsumed by its appeal and reimbursement claim.

Finally, the judge rules that LEAP's untimely administrative appeal bars its appeal and reimbursement claim, and that the court need not address whether LEAP's claim of substantial contract compliance must be made in an administrative appeal. The judge notes that these issues may be resolved in a future hearing.
