And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the case and has made some preliminary findings. The case involves Mars, who performed during the Stadium Tour, and Respondents RWC, Cruefest, Records, and Masters 2008. Mars argues that the License Agreement stripped him and Respondent RWC of the remaining economic benefit of the Touring Agreement. The judge has reviewed declarations from band assistants and sound engineers, which suggest that Mars' preparation and performance during the tour were inconsistent and that he complained about efforts to cover his mistakes using tracks. The judge has also ordered the entities MCT, MCI, and Masters 2000 to arbitration, and they are no longer part of the case. The judge intends to continue reviewing the case and will make a final ruling after considering all the evidence.
