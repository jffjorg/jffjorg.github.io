  Case Number:  23STCP01055    Hearing Date:   January 16, 2024    Dept:  85 
Mick Mars v. Mötley
Crüe Touring, Inc. et al, 23STCP01055


Tentative decision on petition for a writ of mandate:
denied as moot; Mars entitled to attorney fees



            
 
            Petitioner
Mick Mars (“Mars”) seeks a writ of mandate compelling Respondents Red, White
& Crue, Inc. (“RWC”), Cruefest limited liability company (“LLC”)
(“Cruefest”), Mötley Records, LLC (“Records”), and Masters 2008, LLC (“Masters
2008”) to produce records.
            The
court has read and considered the moving papers, opposition, and reply, and renders
the following tentative decision. 
            
            A. Statement
of the Case
            1. Petition
            On April 4, 2023, Petitioner Mars filed
the Petition against Cruefest, Records, Masters 2008 (collectively “Respondent
LLCs”), RWC, Mötley Crüe Touring, Inc. (“MCT”), Mötley Crüe, Inc. (“MCI”), and Masters
2000, Inc. (“Masters 2000”).  Mars alleged
a cause of action for traditional mandamus under Corporations Code sections
1603(a) and 17704.10(f).  The verified Petition
alleges in pertinent part as follows.
            Mars was a founding member, lead
guitar player, and backing vocalist for the band Mötley Crüe.  Pet. at ¶¶ 1, 23-26.  He is a 25% member of each of the Respondent entities,
through which the Mötley Crüe does business. 
Pet. at ¶¶ 5, 9, 14-16.
Nikki Sixx (“Sixx”)
is the only Mötley Crüe member besides Mars who has been a member throughout the
band’s existence.  Pet. at ¶25.  Sixx often made band decisions without
consent or knowledge of the other members. 
Pet. at ¶33.  He would send
documents with instructions to “sign immediately” and the false assertion that
the other band members had already signed their copies.  Pet. at ¶34. 

 
            a. Mars’ Final Tour
             Throughout his professional career, Mars has suffered
from Ankylosing Spondylitis (“AS”), which debilitated his body over time.  Pet. at ¶¶ 35-37.  Sixx “gaslighted” Mars by saying that he had
some cognitive dysfunction, his guitar playing was subpar, and he was
forgetting chords and playing the wrong songs. 
Pet. at ¶38.
            In 2022, Mötley Crüe signed an
agreement to do a U.S. stadium tour (“Stadium Tour”), followed by a world tour with
other artists (“World Tour”).  Pet. at
¶39.  Mars advised management that,
because of complications from his AS and the rigors of the road, the Stadium
Tour would be his last tour.  Pet. at
¶40.  He would not retire from the Mötley
Crüe and would remain available for recording and other band activities.  Pet. at ¶40. 
Management replied that it understood and that fans would be informed
with dignity.  Pet. at ¶41.
            The Stadium Tour lasted through
September 9, 2022, and included triple the planned number of stadiums.  Pet. at ¶¶ 42, 48.  During this tour, Sixx gaslighted Mars more
than ever.  Pet. at ¶43.  He repeatedly told Mars that he was playing
the wrong chords and that fans were complaining about his playing.  Pet. at ¶43. 
Mars did play the wrong chords, but only because his in-ear monitors
malfunctioned and kept him from hearing his chords.  Pet. at ¶46. 
Sixx’s comments suggest that he plotted to force Mars out of Mötley Crüe
and take his shares in the relevant Respondent entities.  Pet. at ¶43.
            Sixx did not play a single note on his
bass during the tour.  Pet. at ¶44.  He fist-pumped with his strumming hand the
entire time, with recordings replacing his live playing.  Pet. at ¶44. 
Significant portions of the other two band members’ parts also were pre-recorded,
and some fans noticed that Tommy Lee’s (“Lee”) drum part began while he was
still walking to the drum set.  Pet. at ¶45.  Mars received the least online criticism of
all the band members for their performances. 
Pet. at ¶47.
 
            b. Post-Stadium Tour MCI
Meeting
            On October 14, 2022, between the Stadium
Tour and the World Tour, Mars’ attorney received a draft Separation and Release
Agreement from an attorney who purported to represent RWC and MCI.  Pet. at ¶49. 
The proposal acknowledged that Mars is an officer, director, and
shareholder of the Respondent entities. 
Pet. at ¶49.  It erroneously
stated that Mars no longer desires to perform in Mötley Crüe and that he was resigning
as an officer and director of all Respondent entities.  Pet. at ¶49. 

            The separation proposal stated that
Mars’ share of touring profits would decrease from 25% to 5% for the rest of
the current tour and to 0% for any future tours.  Pet. at ¶50. 
His share of merchandise profits would decrease from 25% to 5% for any
merchandise with the Mötley Crüe’s name or related logos and to 0% for any
merchandise that featured the guitar player the Mötley Crüe hired to replace
Mars on tour, John 5.  Pet. at ¶51.  In exchange, Mars would transfer to MCI all
right, title, and interest in Mötley Crüe assets.  Pet. at ¶52. 
Mötley Crüe could continue to use his name and likeness.  Pet. at ¶53. 
Mars would also release Mötley Crüe from any liability.  Pet. at ¶54. 

            Mars did not sign this one-sided separation
proposal.  On October 25, 2022, he
received notice that Sixx had scheduled a Zoom meeting of MCI shareholders for
November 4, 2022.  Pet. at ¶55.  The stated purpose of the meeting was to
accept Mars’ resignation and terminate him as officer and director of MCI.  Pet. at ¶56.
            On October 26, 2022, Mars issued a
press release announcing that he was no longer touring with the band because of
his AS but was otherwise still a band member. 
Pet. at ¶57.  Within 24 hours, the
rest of Mötley Crüe released a statement that Mars was retiring from the band
and that he was being replaced by John 5. 
Pet. at ¶58.  
            On November 2, 2022, Mars wrote to
MCI that he was not quitting Mötley Crüe or resigning as an officer or director
of the Respondent entities.  Pet. at ¶59.  He could not join Mötley Crüe on tours but
otherwise remained a member.  Pet. at
¶60.  He also asked for permission to
have his manager and counsel attend. 
Pet. at ¶61.  
            The
next day, MCI’s counsel responded that the separation proposal’s 5% offer was generous,
given that the last band member who retired received nothing.  Pet. at ¶62. 
MCI’s counsel added that, if Mars refused this offer, the other MCI
members would force him to sell them his MCI shares at book value with no value
assigned to the Mötley Crüe name.  Pet.
at ¶62.  This effectively meant that Mars
would receive nothing.  Pet. at ¶63.  MCI’s counsel also declared that the November
4, 2022 meeting would not be recorded, Mars’ manager could not attend, and
Mars’ counsel could only attend as an observer. 
Pet. at ¶69.  
            At the November 4, 2022 meeting,
Sixx made clear that he believed the separation proposal was generous and that Mötley
Crüe would never agree to give Mars a share of the World Tour profits.  Pet. at ¶¶ 74-75.  Sixx further severely criticized Mars’ performances
during the Stadium Tour.  Pet. at
¶76.  The other Mötley Crüe members voted
to rescind the separation proposal, oust Mars, and buy his shares for book
value, which they asserted was worth close to nothing.  Pet. at ¶78. 
They agreed to postpone the decision for two weeks pending further discussion
between the parties.  Pet. at ¶78.
 
            c. Revised Settlement Offers
            MCI provided a redlined draft
agreement that raised Mars’ share of profits from 5% to 7.5% for the World Tour.  Pet. at ¶80. 
Changes to other provisions in the draft agreement made it difficult to
ascertain if this change would increase Mars’ revenue.  Pet. at ¶80. 
The revised proposal also required Mars to divest his interest in MCI,
RWC, and five other entities, some of which Mars did not recognize.  Pet. at ¶81. 
Mars felt that he needed to have a corporate attorney review all the
corporate documents associated with those companies and requested time to do so
on January 13, 2023.  Pet. at ¶¶ 82, 84.  Mötley Crüe’s counsel responded that, if Mars
did not finalize the revised proposal by January 20, 2023, Mötley Crüe would
proceed with Mars’ termination.  Pet. at
¶85.  
            On January 20, 2023, Mars offered to
resolve the matter if Mötley Crüe agreed to his original proposal under which
he would receive 15% of the Mötley Crüe’s profits and a percentage of touring
profits beyond the World Tour.  Pet. at
¶88.
 
            d. Request for Documents
            As of February 7, 2023, MCI had not
responded to Mars’ offer.  Pet. at ¶¶
88-89.  The next day, Mars sent separate
requests to each Respondent for specific Respondent corporate and LLC documents
(“Requests”).  Pet. at ¶¶ 89, 100.
            Seven days later, Mötley Crüe’s
attorney sent a Demand for Arbitration. 
Pet. at ¶90.  Mötley Crüe
essentially is suing Mars to establish that he is no longer an MCI officer,
director, or shareholder.  Pet. at ¶90.  To date, Respondents have not responded to Mars’
demand for documents.  Pet. at ¶101.
 
            e. Prayer for Relief
            Mars seeks a writ of mandate
directing Respondents to allow him to inspect and make copies of all their business
records from inception to present day, or for an order to show cause as to why
a writ of mandate to that effect should not issue.  Pet. Prayer for Relief at ¶1.  Mars also seeks attorney’s fees and
costs.  Pet. Prayer for Relief at ¶¶ 2-3.
 
            2.
Course of Proceedings
            On
April 20, 2023, Mars served Respondents MCI, RWC, Masters 2000, Masters 2008,
Records, and Cruefest with the Petition.
            On
April 24, 2023, Mars served MCT with the Petition.
            On
September 7, 2023, the court granted in part Respondents’ motion to
strike.  The court also granted a motion
to compel arbitration as to MCT, MCI, and Masters 2000, but denied the motion
as to RWC, Cruefest, Records, and Masters 2008.
            On
September 19, 2023, RWC, Cruefest, Masters 2008, and Records filed an Answer.
            On
November 17, 2023, pursuant to Mars’ request, the court dismissed the action as
to MCT, MCI, and Masters 2000.
 
            B. Standard of Review
            A party may seek to set aside an
agency decision by petitioning for either a writ of administrative mandamus
(CCP §1094.5) or of traditional mandamus. 
CCP §1085.    
            “A writ of mandate may be issued by
any court to any inferior tribunal, corporation, board, or person, to compel
the performance of an act which the law specially enjoins, as a duty resulting
from an office, trust, or station, or to compel the admission of a party to the
use and enjoyment of a right or office to which the party is entitled, and from
which the party is unlawfully precluded by such inferior tribunal, corporation,
board, or person.”  CCP §1085(a).
            A traditional writ of mandate under
CCP section 1085 is the method of compelling the performance of a legal,
ministerial duty.  Pomona Police
Officers’ Assn. v. City of Pomona, (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 578, 583-84.  Generally, mandamus will lie when (1) there
is no plain, speedy, and adequate alternative remedy, (2) the respondent has a
duty to perform, and (3) the petitioner has a clear and beneficial right to
performance.  Id. at 584 (internal
citations omitted).  Whether a statute
imposes a ministerial duty for which mandamus is available, or a mere
obligation to perform a discretionary function, is a question of statutory
interpretation.  AIDS Healthcare
Foundation v. Los Angeles County Dept. of Public Health, (2011) 197
Cal.App.4th 693, 701.
            No administrative record is required
for traditional mandamus to compel performance of a ministerial duty or as an
abuse of discretion. 
 
            C. Governing Law  

            1. Shareholder or Director Inspection
of Corporate Records
            A corporation shall keep adequate
and correct books and records of account and shall keep minutes of the
proceedings of its shareholders, board and committees of the board.  Corporations Code §1500.[1]  It
shall also keep at its principal office, or the office of its transfer agent or
registrar, a record of the names and addresses of all shareholders and the
number and class of shares each one holds. 
Id.
            The board shall cause an annual
report to be sent to the shareholders not later than 120 days after the close
of the fiscal year.  §1501(a)(1).  The report shall contain a balance sheet as
of the end of that fiscal year; an income statement and a statement of
cashflows for that fiscal year; and any report thereon of independent
accountants or, if there is none, the certificate of an authorized officer of
the corporation that the statements were prepared without audit from the books
and records of the corporation.  Id.
            The accounting books, records, and
minutes of proceedings of the shareholders, board, and board committees of any
domestic corporation shall be open to inspection at the corporation’s principal
office in California upon the written demand on the corporation of any
shareholder or holder of a voting trust certificate at any reasonable time
during usual business hours, for a purpose reasonably related to the holder’s
interests as a shareholder or as the holder of a voting trust certificate.  §1601(a)(1). 
The inspection may be in person or by agent or attorney.  §1601(b). 
The right to inspect includes the right to copy and make extracts.  Id. 
This right may not be limited by the articles or bylaws.  Id.
            Every director shall have the
absolute right at any reasonable time to inspect and copy all books, records
and documents of every kind and to inspect the physical properties of the
corporation and any subsidiaries.  §1602.
            Upon refusal of a lawful demand for
inspection from a corporation’s member, the superior court of the proper county
may enforce the right of inspection with just and proper conditions or may, for
good cause shown, appoint one or more competent inspectors or accountants to
audit the books and records kept in this state and investigate the property,
funds and affairs of any domestic corporation or any foreign corporation
keeping records in this state and of any subsidiary corporation thereof,
domestic or foreign, keeping records in this state and to report thereon in
such manner as the court may direct. 
§1603(a).  
            If the court finds the corporation’s
failure to comply with a proper demand for inspection was without
justification, the court may award an amount sufficient to reimburse the
shareholder or holder of a voting trust certificate for reasonable expenses
incurred in the action, including attorney’s fees.  §1604.
 
            2. Member Inspection of LLC

liability company, if any, for the six most recent fiscal years.
(7)  
The books and records of the limited liability company

            A member of a limited liability
company has a right, upon reasonable request and for purposes reasonably
related to the interest of that person as a member, to inspect and copy certain
information and financial statements of the company.  §17704.10(b). 
A member has recourse to the courts if the company does not comply with
a lawful demand for inspection of corporate records.  §17704.10(f). 
The court may also extend the time for compliance with the demand for
good cause shown.  Id.  A court may award reasonable expenses including
attorneys’ fees against a company where a member must resort to court action as
a result of the company’s unjustified failure to comply with a proper
demand.  §17704.10(g).
 
            D. Statement of Facts

            1.
Mars’ Evidence
            a.
Background
            Mars
founded the band Mötley Crüe in 1981 along with Sixx, Lee, and Vince Neil
(“Neil”).  Mars Decl., ¶2.  The Respondent entities conduct the band’s
various business activities, but Mars does not know all their functions.  Mars Decl., ¶¶ 3, 5.  Mars and the other band members are each a
25% shareholder, officer, and director or member of most of the entities.  Mars Decl., ¶¶ 3-4.  Mars is only a 20% member of Cruefest, the
same percentage as Mötley Crüe manager Allen Kovac.  Mars Decl., ¶4.
            Mars
was diagnosed with AS when he was 27 years old. 
Mars Decl., ¶5.  AS is a chronic
inflammatory form of arthritis that mainly affects the spine and pelvis.  Mars Decl., ¶5.  This has caused Mars severe pain throughout
his career.  Mars Decl., ¶5.  He began to lose the ability to turn his head
in the 1990s.  Mars Decl., ¶5.  By 2000, he lost his ability to drive because
of his frozen neck.  Mars Decl., ¶5.  He can no longer move his head in any
direction, and he is completely frozen above the pelvis.  Mars Decl., ¶5.  
 
            b.
Mars’ Plan for Partial Separation
            RWC
handles the band’s touring business.  Mars
Decl., ¶6.  In August 2019, RWC entered
an agreement with Live Nation for a multi-show concert tour to begin in
2020.  Mars Decl., ¶6.  This tour was postponed in 2020 and 2021
because of the COVID-19 pandemic.  Mars
Decl., ¶6.  On June 2, 2020, RWC and Live
Nation entered into a new touring agreement for a multi-year concert tour
(“Touring Agrement”).  Mars Decl., ¶7.  The tour would begin June 2022 with a Stadium
Tour in the U.S. and Canada, followed by a World Tour.  Mars Decl., ¶7.  
            Before
the Stadium Tour started, Mars advised the band’s management it would be his
last tour because the rigors of the road took too high a toll on his
AS-afflicted body.  Mars Decl., ¶8.  Mars made it clear that he was only retiring
from touring, not from the band altogether. 
Mars Decl., ¶8.  He would remain
available for recording and other band activities.  Mars Decl., ¶8.  
 
            c.
Post-Tour Negotiations
            On
October 16, 2022, a month after the Stadium Tour ended, counsel for RWC and MCI
sent Mars a draft Separation and Release Agreement.  Mars Decl., ¶9, Ex. 1.  This attorney had previously represented Mars
personally in some cases and had represented the band with Mars as a member in
other cases.  Mars Decl., ¶9.
            The
draft Separation and Release Agreement acknowledged that Mars is an officer,
director, and shareholder of RWC and MCI. 
Mars Decl., ¶9, Ex. 1.  It
asserted that he no longer desires to perform in Mötley Crüe and that he was resigning
as an officer and director of both RWC and MCI. 
Mars Decl., ¶9, Ex. 1.  Mars would
receive 5% of touring profits from the rest of the events under the Touring
Agreement, and 0% of profits from subsequent tours.  Mars Decl., ¶9, Ex. 1.  He would still receive 25% of merchandising
net profits solely in connection with merchandise using his likeness together
with the band, the Mötley Crüe name, or any such logo.  Mars Decl., ¶9, Ex. 1.  He would only receive 5% of merchandising net
profits from merchandise with the band name, related logo, and the likeness of
any guitarist other than Mars.  Mars
Decl., ¶9, Ex. 1.  Other than these shares
of band profits, the draft Separation and Release Agreement required Mars to transfer
all his rights, title, and interest in Mötley Crüe assets, income, tradenames, or
goodwill to MCI.  Mars Decl., ¶9, Ex. 1.
            Mars
did not sign this separation proposal because he found it hideously one-sided.  Mars Decl., ¶10.  He spent 41 years working with the other band
members to build the goodwill of the Mötley Crüe name.  Mars Decl., ¶10.  The band was set to make a lot of money on
the World Tour, and it did so.  Mars
Decl., ¶10.  Mars believed the proposed
terms were intended to enable the other members to make more money by taking
his share from him.  Mars Decl.,
¶10.  
            On
October 25, 2022, Mars received notice that MCI CEO Sixx had scheduled a Zoom
meeting of MCI shareholders for November 4, 2022.  Mars Decl., ¶11, Ex. 2.  The stated purpose of the meeting was to
accept Mars’ resignation, terminate him as officer and director of MCI,
purchase his shares, and hire a replacement guitarist for him.  Mars Decl., ¶11, Ex. 2.
            On
October 26, 2022, Mars issued a press release announcing that he was no longer
touring with the Mötley Crüe because of his AS. 
Mars Decl., ¶12, Ex. 3.  He would
remain a band member but could no longer handle the rigors of the road.  Mars Decl., ¶12, Ex. 3.  Within 24 hours, the rest of Mötley Crüe
released a statement that Mars was retiring from the band and being replaced by
John 5.  Mars Decl., ¶12, Ex. 4.  
            On
November 2, 2023, Mars sent a counteroffer to MCI and RWC.  Mars Decl., ¶13.  They rejected it the next day without a
counter proposal.  Mars Decl., ¶13.
            Mars
attended the November 4, 2022 Zoom meeting of MCI shareholders which his
business manager was forbidden from attending. 
Mars Decl., ¶14.  Neil was absent
but had given his proxy to Sixx.  Mars
Decl., ¶14.  Sixx, Lee, and Neil voted by
proxy to accept Mars’ resignation from the band, which he never had given.  Mars Decl., ¶14.  They also voted to terminate him as an MCI
officer and director based on allegations that he engaged in “other conduct
constituting legal cause” under section 1(g) of MCI’s 1987 shareholder
agreement (“MCI Agreement”).  Mars Decl.,
¶14; McPherson Decl., ¶5, Ex. 7.  They
then voted to purchase his shares in MCI for book value, which Mars previously had
been advised was worth essentially nothing. 
Mars Decl., ¶14.
            At
Mars’ request, the other band members agreed to defer his termination and share
purchase for two weeks to try and reach some agreement.  Mars Decl., ¶14.  
            On
December 7, 2022, the band’s counsel sent Mars a redlined draft Separation and
Release Agreement.  Mars Decl., ¶15, Ex.
5.  Whereas the original only referred to
MCI and RWC, this draft added the other Respondent entities and required Mars
to sell his interest in all of them.  Mars
Decl., ¶15, Ex. 5.  Mars did not even know
what some of these entities did.  Mars
Decl., ¶15.  Mars made a counteroffer to
this proposal on January 20, 2023.  Mars
Decl., ¶15.
 
            d. Mars’s Requests for Documents
            On February 8,
2023, Mars sent the Requests to each Respondent.  McPherson Decl., ¶4, Ex. 6.  He wanted basic financial, organizational,
and internal governance information about all the Respondent entities.  McPherson Decl., ¶4.  The Requests asserted his right to inspect
and copy records of all Respondent corporations under sections 1600-02 and the
records of all Respondent LLCs under sections 17704.10 et. seq.  McPherson Decl., ¶4, Ex. 6.
            The
Requests sought (1) copies of all executed minutes of shareholder and director
meetings for any Respondent corporation, along with all executed actions taken
by written consent in lieu of such meetings; (2) copies of the articles of
incorporation and bylaws for a Respondent corporation and any amendments or
restatements thereto; (3) copies of the articles of organization for a
Respondent LLC and any amendments or restatements thereto; (4) the operating
agreement and amendments thereto for each Respondent LLC, with any power of
attorney by which the agreement or amendments were executed; (5) if a
Respondent LLC’s written operating agreement was not executed, the most recent
draft of the operating agreement and the named of those who received a copy;
(6) the names and addresses of all managers and members of a Respondent LLC; (7)
each Respondent’s general ledger in electronic format and in the same form and
manner as such ledger is regularly kept by that Respondent and its accountants
or bookkeepers; (8) copies of all financial statements, including but not
limited to pro forma financial statements, income projections, and other similar
and related documents for the annual periods ending on the last days of 2020,
2021, and 2022; (9) all federal, state, and local income tax returns and
amendments thereto for 2020-2022, including the latest draft of such returns
for the year ending December 31, 2022 if the return has not been filed in a jurisdiction
for which the Respondent must file one; and (10) contracts, agreements, or
other evidence of payment of consideration exceeding $25,000 between each
Respondent and either third parties or the entity’s officers, directors, or
shareholders that was in effect at any time between 2020 and 2023, including
written or oral contracts concerning activities and arrangements either not finalized
or in effect, currently in effect, or anticipated for the future.  McPherson Decl., ¶4, Ex. 6.
            
            e.
Demand for Arbitration
            On
February 15, 2023, MCI filed a Demand for Arbitration.  McPherson Decl., ¶5, Ex. 7.  It sought to establish that Mars was
terminated as an MCI officer and director under section 1(g) of the MCI
Agreement.  McPherson Decl., ¶5, Ex.
7.  He therefore was required to sell his
shares with no value being assigned to the band name “Mötley Crüe.”  McPherson Decl., ¶5, Ex. 7.  MCI prayed for an order compelling such
sale.  McPherson Decl., ¶5, Ex. 7.  
            MCI
further argued that, under a 2008 amendment to the MCI Agreement, Mars was not entitled
to receive any revenue from live performances. 
McPherson Decl., ¶5, Ex. 7.  He
was also entitled to only half his original share of merchandising revenue
using his name, likeness, or photograph.  McPherson Decl., ¶5, Ex. 7.  
            On
September 26, 2023, Sixx, Lee, and Neil as MCI shareholders passed a resolution
approving the repurchase of Mars’ MCI stock. 
McPherson Decl., ¶22, Ex. 13.  The
resolution calculated the purchase price of this stock as $505,737 as of
January 25, 2023.  McPherson Decl., ¶22,
Ex. 13.  The band had received a $7
million advance from Live Nation, and Mars had received $1.5 million of that
advance.  McPherson Decl., ¶22, Ex. 13.  Because Mars only earned $391,304 of this advance
based on the number of shows he performed during the Stadium Tour, he owed $1,108,696
to the band.  McPherson Decl., ¶22, Ex.
13.  Instead of paying Mars $505,737 for
his shares, MCI would deduct that amount from the $1,108,696 he owed.  McPherson Decl., ¶22, Ex. 13.  It would then credit any future royalties Mars
earns from the balance.  McPherson Decl.,

The Production of Documents
            (1).
Pre-November 2023 Production
            On
February 16, 2023, Respondent entities produced 237 pages of documents in
response to the Requests.  McPherson
Decl., ¶6.  The produced documents should
have been available at the push of a button to the band’s business managers,
who have prepared the band’s financial documents for over 20 years.  McPherson Decl., ¶6.  The production included three copies of the
MCI Agreement, two copies of Masters 2000’s 1999 shareholders agreement, and two
copies of MCI’s 1986 shareholder agreement. 
McPherson Decl., ¶6.  The
production did not include any accounting records or statements.  McPherson Decl., ¶6.  
            On
May 2, 2023, four weeks after Mars filed the Petition, Respondent entities
produced another 2223 pages of documents. 
McPherson Decl., ¶¶ 8-9.  One
produced document was the superseded Live Nation touring agreement from 2019.  McPherson Decl., ¶10.  Another was an MCI shareholder resolution
from January 25, 2023 terminating Mars as an officer and director.  McPherson Decl., ¶10.  The remaining documents were Statements of
Assets and Liabilities, Ledger Reports, Statements of Income Expense, and tax
returns for each Respondent entity from 2020 and 2021, as well as the draft of
each document for 2022 (collectively “Accounting Records”).  McPherson Decl., ¶10, Ex. 8.  
            Almost
every Accounting Record had a timestamp showing that it was prepared on
February 23, 2023.  McPherson Decl., ¶10,
Ex. 8.  These records were easy to
assemble and generate.  McPherson Decl.,
¶11.  The Colony Group, the company that
prepared the Accounting Records, advertises itself as a sophisticated wealth
management company.  McPherson Decl., ¶11.  Colony Group has not explained why it did not
produce the Accounting Records until after Mars filed the Petition.  McPherson Decl., ¶11.
            On
June 9, 2023, Respondents produced another 673 pages.  McPherson Decl., ¶14.  This production included four contracts
between MCI and Global Merchandising Services Limited from July 2019 to June
2020.  McPherson Decl., ¶14.  The remainder consisted of transactional
documents related to a purchase of the band’s master recordings by BMG Rights
Management (U.S.) LLC pursuant to a 2021 agreement.  McPherson Decl., ¶14.  Respondents have not explained why they did
not produce these documents more than two months after Mars filed the
Petition.  McPherson Decl., ¶14.  
 
            (2).
November 2, 2023 Production
            On
November 2, 2023, Respondents produced another 5,565 pages of documents.  McPherson Decl., ¶15.  Only 476 of these pages were responsive to
the Requests, and most were readily available when Mars made the Requests.  McPherson Decl., ¶15.  The remaining pages consisted of a duplicate
copy of the Accounting Records already produced, RWC agreements from 2015 or
earlier, and documents relating to a transaction between 11-7 Recording Corp.
and RCM Music Catalog L.P.  McPherson
Decl., ¶16.
            Documents
from this round of production indicate that Sixx, Lee, and Neil have taken
steps since May 2022 to misappropriate the economic value of the Touring
Agreement without Mars’ knowledge. 
McPherson Decl., ¶18.  The three
band members are directors and officers of Nu Crüe, Inc. (“Nu”), a California
corporation that filed its articles of incorporation on May 8, 2023.  McPherson Decl., ¶18.  
The November 2 production included a set of resolutions
Sixx, Lee, and Neil adopted as RWC directors and shareholders on June 22, 2023
that terminated Mars’ employment with RWC and authorized an assignment of its
rights under the Touring Agreement to Nu (“Assignment”).  McPherson Decl., ¶19, Ex. 10.  The production also included a copy of the Assignment,
effective June 22, 2023.  McPherson
Decl., ¶19, Ex. 10.  Mars has no interest
in Nu, and he received no notice of these resolutions before they were passed.  McPherson Decl., ¶19, Ex. 10.  
            Also
on June 22, 2023, Sixx, Lee, and Neil as MCI directors passed a resolution
terminating the oral license MCI had given RWC to use its intellectual
property.   McPherson Decl., ¶20, Ex. 11.  They also passed a resolution authorizing MCI
to enter a non-exclusive trademark and copyright license agreement with Nu
(“License Agreement”).  McPherson Decl.,
¶20, Ex. 11.  The License Agreement granted
Nu a non-exclusive and fully revocable license for the trademark to the name “Mötley
Crüe” and any copyrighted works related to the band and its musicians.  McPherson Decl., ¶20, Ex. 11.  The November 2, 2023 production included the
resolutions and the License Agreement.  McPherson
Decl., ¶20, Ex. 11.  
            On
September 23, 2023, RWC and Nu amended the Assignment to have an effective date
of January 25, 2023, before the World Tour began.  McPherson Decl., ¶21, Ex. 12.  This was the date MCI asserts Mars was
terminated as an MCI officer and his shares repurchased.  McPherson Decl., ¶21.   Mars did not receive prior notice of this amendment.  McPherson Decl., ¶21.  
             
            g.
Outstanding Documents
            On
November 6, 2023, Respondents asserted that the four productions reflected all
documents in their possession, custody, and control that were responsive to the
Requests.  McPherson Decl., ¶17, Ex. 9.  This was false because, as of November 20,
2023, Respondents have not produced some documents whose existence is required
by law.  McPherson Decl., ¶17.
            As
to RWC, Respondents have not produced any copies of (1) articles of
incorporation and amendments thereto, (2) executed minutes of shareholder or
director meetings, and (3) the final 2022 state and federal income tax returns.  McPherson Decl., ¶23, Ex. 14.
            As
to Cruefest, Respondents have not produced any copies of (1) agreements with
either third parties or Cruefest members or managers that involve payment of
over $25,000 and were in effect at any time between 2020 and 2023; (2) written
and executed or non-executed operating agreements, with amendments thereto and
any related power of attorney; (3) articles of organization, with amendments
and restatements thereof; (4) a list of the names and addresses of all managers
and members; and (5) the final 2022 state and federal income tax returns.  McPherson Decl., ¶23, Ex. 14.
            As
to Records, Respondents have not produced any copies of (1) written and
executed or non-executed operating agreements, with amendments thereto and any
related power of attorney; (2) articles of organization, with amendments and
restatements thereof; and (3) a list of the names and addresses of all managers
and member.  McPherson Decl., ¶23, Ex.
14.  It has only provided draft copies of
2022 income tax returns, not the final returns. 
McPherson Decl., ¶23, Ex. 14.  As
to agreements with either third parties or Cruefest members or managers that
involve payment of over $25,000, Records has produced only one agreement
relating to the sale of the band’s catalog. 
McPherson Decl., ¶23, Ex. 14.  
            As
to Masters 2008, Respondents have not produced any copies of (1) written and
executed or non-executed operating agreements, with amendments thereto and any related
power of attorney; (2) articles of organization, with amendments and
restatements thereof; (3) a list of the names and addresses of all managers and
member; and (4) the final 2022 state and federal income tax returns.  McPherson Decl., ¶23, Ex. 14.  As to agreements with either third parties or
Cruefest members or managers that involve payment of over $25,000, Masters 2008
has produced only one agreement relating to the sale of the band’s
catalog.  McPherson Decl., ¶23, Ex.
14.

Respondents’ Evidence
            a.
Respondent Entities’ Background
            Lee,
Mars, Sixx, and Neil formed Mötley Crüe in 1981.  Sixx Decl., ¶2.  
MCI was formed in 1984. 
Malek Decl., ¶3.  It is the
primary company responsible for conducting the band’s business, and it owns the
rights to the band’s name and trademarks. 
Malek Decl., ¶3.  
            MCT
was incorporated in 1986 to own the rights to the band’s live
performances.  Malek Decl., ¶4.  It no longer conducts business.  Malek Decl., ¶4.  
RWC was incorporated in 2005 to succeed MCT as administrator
of touring activities.  Malek Decl.,
¶6.  
            Masters
2000 was incorporated in 1998 to hold the band’s master recordings and the
rights thereto.  Malek Decl., ¶5.  Masters 2008 was formed in 2008 to hold the
rights to two of the band’s albums, but it later sold those rights to Masters
2000.  Malek Decl., ¶9.  Masters 2000 sold all its assets in 2021.  Malek Decl., ¶¶ 5, 9.  
            Cruefest
was formed in 2008 to hold the rights to the band’s live DVD “Crue Fest.”  Malek Decl., ¶7.  Cruefest does not currently conduct any
business.  Malek Decl., ¶7.  
            Records
was formed in 2008 to hold certain band recordings.  Malek Decl., ¶8.  It has no current financial activities.  Malek Decl., ¶8.  
            RWC
is an “S-Corporation,” while Cruefest, Masters 2008, and Records are LLCs.  Malek Decl., ¶10.  All four entities are “pass-through” entities
for tax purposes.  Malek Decl., ¶10.  A Schedule K-1 is prepared for each member or
shareholder of the four entities, and all band members receive all four
Schedule K-1s annually.  Malek Decl.,
¶10.  If Mars or his business advisors
ever requested tax returns or any other financial information, Colony Group
Managing Director Pam Malek (“Malek”) would provide it.  Malek Decl., ¶10.  Malek has provided the band with management,
accounting, and tax services since 2002. 
Malek Decl., ¶2.
            
            b.
Mars’ Separation
            When
rehearsals for the Stadium Tour began in April 2022, Mars had difficulties
remembering chords and songs.  Sixx
Decl., ¶3.  He would also sometimes leave
rehearsals without telling anyone.  Sixx
Decl., ¶3.[2]  
            In
2022, Mars informed the band and management that he was resigning.  Sixx Decl., ¶4.  The band and its management tried to handle
the situation amicably in honor of Mars’ legacy.  Sixx Decl., ¶4.  Although the Respondent entities’ agreements
did not entitle Mars to further compensation, the band offered him a generous severance
package.  Sixx Decl., ¶4.  Mars at first accepted the offer.  Sixx Decl., ¶4.  
            After
Mars obtained new counsel, he changed his mind. 
Sixx Decl., ¶4.  He began to
demand payment in perpetuity for everything the band would do, even though he
would not perform with the band anymore. 
Sixx Decl., ¶4.  
            On
January 25, 2023, MCI shareholders passed a resolution terminating Mars as an
officer and director.  Sixx Decl., ¶5,
Ex. 1.  It asserted that Mars had engaged
in conduct constituting legal cause for termination under section 1(g) of the
MCI Agreement.  Sixx Decl., ¶5, Ex.
1.  The resolution also stated that MCI would
repurchase Mars’ shares and accept his resignation from the band.  Sixx Decl., ¶5, Ex. 1.  Thereafter, Mars was no longer entitled to
receive monies attributable to live performances.  Sixx Decl., ¶5, Ex. 1.  He also would receive only 50% of his previous
share of revenue from merchandise using his name, likeness, or photograph.  Sixx Decl., ¶5, Ex. 1.  
            
            c.
Document Productions
            The
Requests made by Mars on February 8, 2023 were extensive.  Neach Decl., ¶¶ 2, 5.  They sought corporate and LLC documents going
back several years, pro forma financial statements and income projections, all
agreements with each entity involving consideration of greater than $25,000, all
federal and state tax returns for each entity going back to 2020, and draft
returns to the extent final ones did not exist. 
Neach Decl., ¶2.  Some of the Respondent
entities were no longer operating as businesses.  Neach Decl., ¶5.  Respondents needed substantial time to collect
and gather all the requested documents, review the documents, and address
privilege concerns.  Neach Decl., ¶5.
            Respondents
produced 237 pages of documents on February 16, 2023.  Neach Decl., ¶3.  They informed Mars via letter that they were
still locating records and anticipated further production on a rolling
basis.  Neach Decl., ¶4, Ex. 1.  At no point did they refuse to produce any of
the requested documents.  Neach Decl.,
¶4.  
            Cruefest
filed its final 2022 federal and state tax returns in February 2023.  Malek Decl., ¶11.  The Colony Group sent the corresponding Cruefest
Schedule K-ls to each band member shortly thereafter.  Malek Decl., ¶11.
            After
the third round of production on June 9, 2023, Respondents believed they had
complied with the Requests and Mars had not sent any communication that would
lead them to think otherwise.  Neach
Decl., ¶9.  
            The
2022 tax returns for RWC, Masters 2008, and Records had a filing deadline of September
15, 2023.  Malek Decl., ¶11.  The Colony Group prepared these returns
shortly before the deadline and sent Mars the corresponding Schedule K-1s on September
19, 2023.  Malek Decl., ¶11.  
            When
this court ruled on the motions to strike and compel arbitration on September
7, 2023, it also ordered the parties to meet and confer on the briefing
schedule.  Neach Decl., ¶10.  The parties set a meet and confer date via
Zoom for September 21, 2023.  Neach
Decl., ¶11.  
 
            d.
The September 19, 2023 Email
            On
September 19, 2023, Mars’ counsel sent an email with a list of documents Mars
was seeking through the Petition.  Neach
Decl., ¶11, Ex. 2.  For all seven
Respondent entities, the email sought copies of contracts, agreements or other
evidence of payment of consideration of greater than $25,000 with either a
third party or the entity’s officers, directors and/or shareholders.  Neach Decl., ¶11, Ex. 2.  The email applied to such agreements in
effect at any time during the years 2020, 2021, 2022, or 2023.  Neach Decl., ¶11, Ex. 2.  
            Mars
also still sought copies of (1) executed minutes of shareholder and director meetings
for Respondent corporations; (2) all executed actions taken by written consent
in lieu of such meetings; (3) articles of incorporation and bylaws for each
Respondent corporation except MCI, with amendments and restatements thereof;
(4) Records' final 2022 balance sheet, income/expense statement, federal and
income tax returns, and statements of cash flow and retired earnings; and (5)
Records’ final ledger reports for 2020-2022. 
Neach Decl., ¶11, Ex. 2.
            Unlike
the Requests, the September 2023 email had no date limit on the requested
documents.  Neach Decl., ¶12.  Respondents therefore made further inquiries
for documents going further back in time.  Neach Decl., ¶12.  This required additional time for searches by
accountants, business managers, and attorneys. 
Neach Decl., ¶12.  
            Respondents’
5,576-page production on November 6, 2023 consisted mostly of agreements
involving Respondent entities.  Neach
Decl., ¶13.  It included a more complete
version of the transactional documents related to the asset sale documents the
Respondent entities had already produced on June 9, 2023.  Neach Decl., ¶13.  Respondents believed this production included
all the documents Mars had claimed were still outstanding in the Requests and in
the September 2023 Email.  Neach Decl.,
¶13, Ex. 3.  The accompanying cover
letter therefore asked him to dismiss this action to avoid the expense of
briefing.  Neach Decl., ¶13, Ex. 3.  
 
            e.
The November 20, 2023 Chart and December 8, 2023 Production
            Respondents
did not hear from Mars again until he served his opening brief on November 20,
2023.  Neach Decl., ¶14.  The accompanying chart was the first time he
asserted documents were still missing. 
Neach Decl., ¶14.  
            The
tax returns of three of the four Respondents at issue, RWC, Masters 2008, and
Records, were only filed recently, shortly before the September 15, 2023
deadline.  Neach Decl., ¶16.  Cruefest filed its final tax return for 2022
in February 2023.  Neach Decl., ¶16.  Respondents believed that Mars had received
the K-1 schedules for all four entities. 
Neach Decl., ¶16.  
            On
December 8, 2023, Respondents produced another 1,372 pages of documents.  Neach Decl., ¶17, Ex. 4.  The cover letter explained that the
production included the 2022 federal and state returns for the four Respondent
entities and that Mars already has the K-1 schedules for each.  Neach Decl., ¶17, Ex. 4.  The production also included the articles of
incorporation or organization for each entity, a list of Records’ members, and statements
of information listing Cruefest and Masters 2008’s members.  Neach Decl., ¶17, Ex. 4.  
            Respondents
also confirmed they did not have any other documents responsive to the Requests
Mars listed as outstanding in his opening brief.  Neach Decl., ¶18, Ex. 4.  This was in large part because Cruefest,
Records, and Masters 2008 no longer conduct business.  Neach Decl., ¶18.  Respondents advised Mars that the production rendered
the Petition moot.  Neach Decl., ¶18, Ex.
4.
 
            3.
Reply Evidence
            a.
Arbitration
            On
March 31, 2023, Mars responded to MCI’s Demand for Arbitration.  McPherson Reply Decl., ¶2, Ex. 15.  In the arbitration proceeding, Mars has asked
MCI to produce MCI and Masters 2000 accounting records that somewhat overlap
with the accounting records listed in the Requests.  McPherson Reply Decl., ¶3.
 
            b.
Tax Documents
            Colony
Group mailed Cruefest and Masters 2008 their 2022 partnership tax returns on February
28, 2023, and Colony Group mailed Records its 2022 partnership tax returns on
March 1, 2023.  McPherson Reply Decl.,
¶4, Ex. 16.  Colony Group mailed RWC its
2022 S Corporation tax returns on September 4, 2023.  McPherson Reply Decl., ¶4, Ex. 16.  
 
            c.
Valuation Report
            On
September 28, 2023, Respondents sent Mars a valuation report prepared by Neumeister
& Associates with respect to Mars’ shares in MCI.  McPherson Reply Decl., ¶5.  The list of documents Neumeister &
Associates considered for the report included general ledgers and balance
sheets for MCI, RWC, MCT, Masters 2000, and Masters 2008 as of January 25,
2023.  McPherson Reply Decl., ¶5, Ex. 17.        Tabs
E-H to the valuation report included ledger reports for MCI and RWC printed
between May and August 2023.  McPherson
Reply Decl., ¶6, Ex. 18.  These reports
include entries as late as January 25, 2023. 
McPherson Reply Decl., ¶6, Ex. 18. 

 
            E. Analysis
Petitioner Mars seeks a writ of mandate compelling
Respondents RWC, Cruefest, Records, and Masters 2008[3] to
produce records and for an award of attorney fees.
 
1. Mars’ Claims Are Moot
“Although a case may originally present an existing
controversy, if before decision it has, through the acts of the parties or
other cause, occurring after commencement of the action, lost that essential
character, it becomes a moot case or question which will not be considered by
the court.”  Wilson v. Los Angeles
County Civil Service Com., (1952) 112 Cal.App.2d 450, 453; Colony Cove Props., LLC v. City of Carson,
(2010) 187 Cal.App.4th 1487, 1509. 
"The pivotal question in determining if a case is moot is []
whether the court can grant the plaintiff any effectual relief."  Giles
v. Horn, (2002) 100 Cal.App.4th 206, 227 (claim that county failed to make
required findings to approve contracts rendered moot by contract extensions
which were the operative agreements); Eye Dog Foundation v. State Bd. of Guide Dogs
for the Blind, (“Eye Dog Foundation”) (1967) 67 Cal. 2d 536,
541.     
A court should not dismiss a case as moot if a substantial issue
remains. Terry v. Civil Serv. Comm’n, (1952)
108 Cal. App. 2d 861.  A case is
not moot where, despite the happening of a subsequent event, there remain
material questions for the court’s determination that impact a party’s future
and contingent legal rights.  Eye Dog
Foundation, supra, 67 Cal.3d at 541. 
In other words, a case is moot only where the disposition of the case is
“a matter of indifference to the parties” -- where disposition of the case will
neither benefit the plaintiff nor harm the defendant.  Turner v. Markham, (1909) 156 Cal.
68, 69.  
Respondents argue that the documents sought by Mars have
been provided or simply do not exist.  As
a result, there is no relief the court can provide, and the Petition should be denied as moot.  Opp. at 12.
Mars replies that the case is not moot because production is
not complete.  Ledger reports showing
2023 financial activity are readily accessible and available to
Respondents.  Only one ledger report has
ever been produced for 2023, and that ledger report for RWC has minimal 2023
entries.  The ledger reports for all
seven Respondent Entities for the years 2020-2022 were generated in about an
hour on February 23, 2023.  Presumably,
Respondents do not want to produce full 2023 general ledger entries in order to
conceal what happened to the tens of millions of dollars in touring revenue
earned through the World Tour after RWC’s touring agreement with Live Nation
was secretly assigned to Nu and then backdated to January 25, 2023.  Reply at 10.
Mars’ argument that 2023 ledger reports are missing from
production is not well taken.  His
Requests are limited in scope by their plain language, which merely asked for
each Respondents “general ledger” in the form in which it is kept and
maintained.  Ex. 6.  It is unclear whether the Requests, which
were dated February 3, 2023, included ledger material generated after that
date.  
Mars clarified the scope of the Requests in his opening
brief, which responded to Respondents’ November 6, 2023 assertion that they had
produced all responsive documents in their possession, custody, and
control.  McPherson Decl., ¶17, Ex.
9.  As part of Mars’ opening brief, his
counsel provided “[a] complete chart of the documents that remain to be
produced by Respondents”.  McPherson
Decl., ¶23, Ex. 14.  The 2023 ledger reports
are not listed in the chart of missing documents.  Ex. 14. 
Respondents addressed Mars’s chart by either producing each of the
listed documents or confirming that they did not have the them, in large part
because Cruefest, Records, and Masters 2008 no longer conduct business.  Neach Decl., ¶¶ 17, 18, Ex. 4.  Mars cannot now contend that any more
documents are missing.  The Petition’s merits
are moot.
Mars argues that, even if Respondents mooted the Petition shortly
before hearing, the court has discretion to hear the Petition’s merits if it
“presents an issue of substantial and continuing public interest.”  Fowler v. Golden Pacific Bancorp, Inc.,
(2022) 80 Cal.App.5th 205, 216 (section 1602 claim heard despite mootness
because there is a substantial public interest in determining when a director's
absolute right of inspection may be curtailed). 
He contends that there is a substantial and continuing public interest in
determining whether a shareholder or member (or director) is entitled to be
reimbursed pursuant to section 1604 or 17704.10(g) for attorney fees when a
corporation or LLC fails and refuses to comply with requests for production
without justification for months at a time, only does so after a mandate petition
is filed, rolls out documents that it withheld in a document dump over a period
of ten months, and then arrives at the courthouse steps and says “I’ve
complied; no harm, no foul.”  Reply at 10-11.
Mars’ argument about the public interest does not concern the
Petition’s merits, but rather attorney fees. 
The Petition’s merits are moot but that does not mean that Mars cannot
seek attorney fees for a mooted case.  See
Zuehlsdorf v. Simi Valley Unified Sch. Dist. (2007) 148 Cal. App.
4th 249, 257-258 (upholding award of attorneys’ fees under Govt. Code section
800 where mandamus petition was dismissed as moot, but petitioner nonetheless
the prevailing party based on a practical level).  This issue is addressed post.
 
2. Attorney Fees
Although the merits
are moot, Respondents argue that Mars could not have prevailed on his claims
anyway because he has not satisfied the statutory requirements for shareholder
and member relief.  The court must
address this issue before considering whether Mars is entitled to an award of attorney
fees.
 
a. Whether RWC
Refused to Produce Documents and Whether Mars Sought Production Reasonably
Related to His Interest as a Member
Respondent RWC is a
corporation.  Section 1603(a) provides
that, “[u]pon refusal of a lawful demand for inspection, the superior
court of the proper county, may enforce the right of inspection with just and
proper conditions….”  (emphasis
added).  
Respondents Cruefest, Records, and Masters 2008 are LLCs.  Section 17704.10(a) provides:  “Upon the request of a member . . . ,
for purposes reasonably related to the interest of that person as a member . . .
, a manager . . . shall promptly deliver, in writing,
to the member . . . a copy of the information required to
be maintained by paragraphs (1), (2), and (4) of subdivision (d) of Section
17701.13, and any written operating agreement of the limited liability company.”  (Emphasis added.)  In addition, “[e]ach
member . . . has the right, upon reasonable request, for
purposes reasonably related to the interest of that person as a member, . . . :
[t]o inspect and copy during normal business hours any of the records required
to be maintained pursuant to Section 17701.13” and “[t]o obtain in writing from
the limited liability company, promptly after becoming available, a copy of the
limited liability company’s federal, state, and local income tax returns for
each year.”  (emphasis added.)  
Respondents contend that
RWC did not refuse to provide documents. 
In fact, Mars claims that RWC and the other Responding Entities provided
too many documents.  Without a refusal,
there would be no basis for the court to issue a writ of mandate.  In addition to being moot, the Petition
should be denied with respect to RWC on this ground.  Opp. at 13.
This argument requires
interpretation of section 1603(a).  In
construing a statute, a court must ascertain the intent of the legislature so
as to effectuate the purpose of the law. 
Brown v. Kelly Broadcasting Co., (1989) 48 Cal.3d 711, 724.  The statutory language must be harmonized with
provisions relating to the same subject matter to the extent possible.  Orange County Employees Assn. v. County of
Orange, (1991) 234 Cal.App.3d 833, 841. 
As Mars argues (Reply at 11), the word “refusal” in section 1603(a) must
be interpreted in context with section 1604, which provides that an award of
attorney fees is appropriate if the court finds that the corporation failed to comply
with a proper demand without justification. 
In other words, a corporation refuses to comply with an inspection
demand when it fails to comply without justification.  The Oxford dictionary defines “refuse” as “to
express or show determination not to do something.”  See Gertridge v. State Capital Co.
(1933) 129 Cal.App. 86, 87 (words in statutes are interpreted according to
common acceptance).  Thus, the refusal required
under section 1603(a) need not be expressly made and may be shown by action or inaction.  
The chronology of pertinent evidence is as follows.  In the Fall of 2022, the parties disagreed on
Mars’ status in the band.  At a November
4, 2022 Zoom meeting of MCI shareholders, Sixx, Lee, and Neil voted by proxy to
accept Mars’ resignation from the band, terminate him as an MCI officer and
director, and to purchase his shares in MCI for book value.  Mars Decl., ¶14.  
On February 8, 2023, Mars sent the Requests to each
Respondent under sections 1600-02 and to all Respondent LLCs under sections
17704.10 et. seq.  McPherson
Decl., ¶4, Ex. 6.  He wanted basic financial,
organizational, and internal governance information about all the Respondent entities.  McPherson Decl., ¶4.  
A week later, on February 15, 2023, MCI filed a Demand for
Arbitration seeking to establish that Mars was terminated as an MCI officer and
director and is required to sell his shares. 
McPherson Decl., ¶5, Ex. 7.  
The next day, February 16, 2023, the Respondent entities[4]
produced 237 pages of documents in response to the Requests.  McPherson Decl., ¶6.  The production did not include any accounting
records or statements.  McPherson Decl.,
¶6. Respondents informed Mars via letter that they were still locating records
and anticipated further production on a rolling basis.  Neach Decl., ¶4, Ex. 1.  At no point did Respondents refuse to produce
any of the requested documents.  Neach
Decl., ¶4.  
Mars filed the Petition on April 4, 2023.  On May 2, 2023, four weeks after Mars filed
the Petition, the Respondent entities produced another 2223 pages of
documents.  McPherson Decl., ¶¶ 8-9.  Among the documents produced were the
Accounting Records (Ledger Reports, Statements of Income Expense, and tax
returns for each Respondent entity from 2020 and 2021, as well as the draft of
each document for 2022).  McPherson
Decl., ¶10, Ex. 8.  Almost every
Accounting Record had a timestamp showing that it was prepared on February 23,
2023.  McPherson Decl., ¶10, Ex. 8.  
            On
June 9, 2023, Respondents produced another 673 pages, consisting mostly of Respondents’
contracts with third parties.  McPherson
Decl., ¶14. After this third round of production, Respondents believed they had
complied with the Requests; Mars had not sent any communication that would lead
them to think otherwise.  Neach Decl.,
¶9.  
Respondents filed a motion to compel arbitration on May 31,
2023, asking the court to stay the Petition pending the arbitration’s
completion.  McPherson Decl., ¶13.  The motion was not decided until September 7,
2023.  Id.  When the court ruled on the motion, it
ordered the remaining parties to meet and confer on the briefing schedule for
the Petition.  Neach Decl., ¶10.  The parties set a meet and confer date via
Zoom for September 21, 2023.  Neach
Decl., ¶11.  
On September 19, 2023, less than two weeks after the motion to
compel arbitration was decided, Mars’s attorney sent an email to Respondents’
counsel seeking the production of missing documents.  Neach Decl., ¶11, Ex. 2. Unlike the Requests,
the September 2023 email had no date limit on the requested documents.  Neach Decl., ¶12.  Respondents therefore made further inquiries
for documents going back further in time.  Neach Decl., ¶12.  This required additional time for searches by
accountants, business managers, and attorneys. 
Neach Decl., ¶12.  
On November 2, 2023, Respondents produced another 5,565
pages of documents.  McPherson Decl., ¶15.  The production consisted mostly of agreements
involving the Respondent entities.  Neach
Decl., ¶13.  The production included a
set of resolutions adopted on June 22, 2023 terminating Mars’ employment with
RWC and authorizing an assignment of RWC’s rights under the Touring Agreement
to Nu, as well as the Assignment itself. 
McPherson Decl., ¶19, Ex. 10.  The
production also included June 22, 2023 resolutions terminating MCI’s oral
license with RWC to use its intellectual property and authorizing MCI to enter into
the License Agreement with Nu.  McPherson
Decl., ¶20, Ex. 11.[5]  
            On
November 6, 2023, Respondents asserted that the four productions reflected all
documents in their possession, custody, and control that were responsive to the
Requests.  McPherson Decl., ¶17, Ex. 9.  
Respondents did not hear from Mars again until he served his
opening brief on November 20, 2023. 
Neach Decl., ¶14.  The chart accompanying
the opening brief was the first time Mars asserted that documents were still
missing.  Neach Decl., ¶14.  
            On
December 8, 2023, Respondents produced a final 1,372 pages of documents.  Neach Decl., ¶17, Ex. 4.  Respondents confirmed they did not have any
other responsive documents listed by Mars in his opening brief.  Neach Decl., ¶18, Ex. 4.  This was in large part because Cruefest,
Records, and Masters 2008 no longer conduct business.  Neach Decl., ¶18.  Respondents advised Mars that the production
rendered the Petition moot.  Neach Decl.,
¶18, Ex. 4.
From these facts, Mars concludes that his Requests triggered
statutory duties that Respondents initially violated for eight weeks -- from
the February 8, 2023 Requests until after the Petition was filed on April 6,
2023 -- and that violation continued for another seven months.  
 Respondents contend that they never
refused to produce the requested documents. 
The Requests were extensive, some of the Respondents were no longer
operating, and they needed substantial time to collect and gather all the
requested documents, review the documents, and address privilege concerns.  Neach Decl., ¶¶ 2, 5.  There were three rounds of production by June
9, 2023.
Mars replies that Respondents’ claim that it took
substantial time to collect documents from business managers, accountants, and
attorneys and to review for privilege concerns is absurd.  Respondents provide no names of the business
managers, accountants, and attorneys from whom documents were gathered except Malek,
who appears to be the only business manager for these entities.  Malek Decl. ¶¶ 2.  Mars also is a shareholder and director of
each Respondent and there was no privilege issue with respect to agreements
with third parties, shareholder resolution, or financial records, including tax
returns.  Reply at 7-8.
The court agrees with Mars that the Requests are not
extensive and that Respondents provide no detail about the collection effort or
why a privilege would apply.  These
documents could be easily gathered, and most were gathered by February 2023.  Nonetheless, the delay between the February 8
2023 Requests and the second and third productions on May 2 and June 9, 2023 is
not particularly significant.  The delay
after June 9, however, is significant.
Respondents argue that Mars went silent after the June 9
production until this court prompted action by ordering the parties to meet and
confer, which the parties set for September 21, 2023.  Neach Decl., ¶11.  Given that three months went by after June 9,
Respondents had every reason to believe that Mars was satisfied with the
documents he received.  Opp. at 15.
Mars correctly argues that he had no need to demand
additional documents between June 9 and the court’s September 21 ruling on the
motion to compel arbitration.  Reply at
6-7.  It would not make sense to do so
while the arbitration issue was outstanding, and Respondents could not reasonably
rely on his silence during that period.  
More important, on September 19, 2023, less than two weeks after the
motion was decided, Mars’s attorney sent an email to Respondents’ counsel
seeking the production of missing documents. 
Neach Decl., ¶11, Ex. 2.  Yet,
Respondents did not produce anything until November 2, 2023.  
Respondents contend that, unlike the Requests, the September
2023 email had no date limit on the requested documents.  Neach Decl., ¶12.  Respondents therefore made further inquiries
for documents going further back in time.  Neach Decl., ¶12.  This required additional time for searches by
accountants, business managers, and attorneys. 
Neach Decl., ¶12.
Mars refutes this claim. 
Mars notes that the September 19, 2023 email states that only
“contracts, agreements [...] greater than $25,000.00 . . . in effect at any
time during the years 2020, 2021, 2022, or 2023” were being sought.  Neach Decl., Ex. 2.  Additionally, Mars could not lawfully expand
the Requests in the email and Respondents should have inquired if they thought
he was doing so.
Respondents produced some requested documents on November 2,
2023, asserting a few days later that this was all of the responsive
documents.  They proved to be wrong, as
reflected in the chart attached to Mars’ opening brief.  Ex. 14. 
This chart included basic documents such as articles of incorporation, shareholder/director
minutes, operating agreements, articles of incorporation, and income tax
returns.  Id.  These documents should have been produced without
the need for prodding by Mars.  He notes
that these documents were not produced until December 8, 2023, ten months after
the Requests and after his opening brief had been filed.  See Neach Decl., ¶17.  Whatever Respondents’ position about a rolling
production, RWC’s failure to produce the documents earlier than December 8 amounts
to a refusal.  Respondent LLCs’ failure
to produce these documents also was without justification.
With respect to the inspection rights of a LLC member under sections 17701.13(d) and 17704.10(b), Respondents argue that the phrase “purposes
reasonably related to the interest of that person as a member” has received
little attention.  One commentator on
California corporate law stated: “Presumably, the person desiring to exercise
the right of inspection would have to show that there was at least some reason
to believe that the corporation had not been making full and accurate reports
to the shareholders of the financial condition and results of operation of the
corporation.”  Marsh’s Cal. Corp. Law,
(2015) §15.09.  While this passage
speaks to corporations, there is no reason to believe that the “purposes
reasonably related” phrase is any different for a limited liability company.  Mars does not claim that any of the
Respondents did not provide “full and accurate” reports to him.  For years, Mars received Schedule K-1’s.  Malek Decl., ¶10.  Only after he realized that he could not come
to agreement with his former bandmates, and that litigation was imminent, did his
attorney serve the Requests.  In short, Respondents
contend that the evidence and chronology evince that the Requests serve no
purpose reasonably related to Mars’ interest in the limited liability
company Respondents.  Opp. at 14.
A petitioner need have only one sufficient basis for demand
for inspection of corporate records that is reasonably related to her interest
as a shareholder.  See Homestake
Mining Co. v. Superior Court of City & County of San Francisco, (“Homestake”)
(1936) 11 Cal.App.2d 488, 497.  A request to inspect corporate records to
ascertain the value of the stock can be reasonably related to an interest as a
shareholder.  Schnabel v. Superior
Court (1993) 5 Cal.4th 704, 715; Homestake, supra, 11
Cal.App.2d at 496.  The burden of proving
a proper purpose is on the shareholder seeking inspection.  Id. at 715-23.  This reasoning should also apply to a limited
liability company.
Mars’ motivation in seeking to inspect the limited liability
company Respondents’ books and records was to understand the economic interests
that he was being asked to give up in consideration for withdrawing from the
band.  He was not even aware of the
function of all the Respondents from which he was being asked to resign.  This is a sufficient purpose reasonably
related to his interest as a member in Respondent LLCs.
 
b.
Whether Respondents Failed to Comply Without Justification
For a corporate
respondent, in “any action or proceeding under Section 1600 or Section 1601, if
the court finds the failure of the corporation to comply with a proper demand
thereunder was without justification, the court may award an amount
sufficient to reimburse the shareholder . . . for the reasonable expenses
incurred by such holder, including attorneys’ fees, in connection with such
action or proceeding.” §1604 (emphasis added).
For a limited liability company respondent, “in any action
under…Section 17713.07, if the court finds the failure of the limited liability
company to comply with the requirements of this section is without
justification, the court may award an amount sufficient to reimburse the
person bringing the action for the reasonable expenses incurred by that person,
including attorney’s fees, in connection with the action or proceeding.”
§17704.10(g) (emphasis added).
Under section 1604, a respondent’s action is justified if it
is “well grounded in both law and fact.” 
Farnum v. Iris Biotech. Inc., (2022) 86 Cal.App. 5th 602, 611.  The court must examine all of the
circumstances of a given case to determine whether awarding fees under the
statute would be unjust, with the burden of showing such inequity resting on
the defendant.  Id.  Some considerations that the court should
consider in exercising its discretion include the necessity for the lawsuit and
the likelihood that the problem would have been solved by other means.  Id. at 612.  The trial court has considerable discretion
on this issue.  See id. at 69.  The same evaluation should apply to the same
language in section 17713.07.  
Mars argues that Respondents have offered no justification
for failing to produce readily available documents that they were statutorily
and contractually obligated to provide prior to this litigation.  Nor have they offered any justification for
the delay in production for months after the Petition was filed when all such
documents were maintained by the same business manager for over 20 years.  Pet. Op. Br. at 16.
According to Mars, the only reasonable conclusion that can
be drawn is that Respondents intentionally caused Petitioner to incur
unnecessary legal fees by withholding the vast majority of documents until
after the Petition was filed, dragging out their production over nine months,
filing a petition to compel arbitration after already having produced the Accounting
Records with very few documents left to be delivered, filing a motion to strike
important context allegations which was largely denied, and ultimately producing
thousands of documents that were never requested.  Respondents intended all along to do
everything possible to ensure that Mars spends as much money as possible, so
that he will be “starved out” of the fight and give up the fruits of his life’s
work.  Pet. Op. Br. at 17-18.
The court need not agree with Mars to conclude that
Respondents acted without substantial justification.  The analysis above concerning Respondents’
refusal applies equally to their failure to produce documents without
justification.  The Requests were not
burdensome.  Yet, Mars was compelled to
file suit and it appears plain that production would not have occurred without
it.  Mars is entitled to attorney fees.
 
F. Conclusion
The Petition against Respondents is denied as moot on its
merits.  However, Mars is entitled to
reasonable attorney fees.  He may make a
noticed motion for the award of reasonable fees.  Counsel are directed to meet and confer on
the amount of reasonable fees before such a motion is filed.
Mars’s counsel is ordered to prepare a proposed judgment,
serve it on Respondents’ counsel for approval as to form, wait ten days after
service for any objections, meet and confer if there are objections, and then
submit the proposed judgment along with a declaration stating the
existence/non-existence of any unresolved objections.  An OSC re: judgment is set for March 26, 2024
at 1:30 p.m.  This date is subject to
change if a motion for attorney fees is heard.
