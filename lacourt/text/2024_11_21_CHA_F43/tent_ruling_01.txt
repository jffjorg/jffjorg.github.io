RELIEF
REQUESTED
Attorney for Plaintiff
is requesting to be relieved as counsel
 
RULING: Motion
to be relieved as counsel is granted.
 
Gregg A.
Martin, Esq. and Emily G. Avazian, Esq. of Greenberg Glusker Fields Claman
& Machtinger LLP, counsel of record for plaintiff Star Floors, Inc., seek
to be relieved as counsel for that party.  Counsel filed a motion with the required Forms
MC-051, MC-052 and MC-053.  Counsel’s
declaration states that there is a complete breakdown in the attorney-client
relationship such that continuing representation would be unfair to both client
and counsel.
 
Absent a
showing of resulting prejudice, an attorney’s request for withdrawal should be
granted.¿ (People v. Prince¿(1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398, 406.)  There is no showing of prejudice, and the
motion complies with California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1362.
 
Motion to be
relieved as counsel is granted.
 
Moving party to
give notice.
