And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge granted a protective order limiting the number of requests for admissions from the plaintiff. The plaintiff had propounded 55 requests for admissions, but the defendant objected to the number, arguing that it was excessive and not justified by the complexity or quantity of issues in the case. The court found that the plaintiff's declaration for additional discovery was insufficient and failed to provide specific facts supporting the need for excessive requests for admissions. The court ordered the plaintiff to propound requests for admissions again, but limited to 35 of his choosing.

The court also imposed monetary sanctions on the plaintiff in the amount of $662.28, payable within 20 days of the order. The sanctions were for the defendant's counsel's time and expenses incurred in responding to the requests for admissions and preparing and filing the motion for protective order. The court denied the plaintiff's request for sanctions.
