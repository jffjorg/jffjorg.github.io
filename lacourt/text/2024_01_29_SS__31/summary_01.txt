And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the plaintiff's request for default judgment against the defendant. The plaintiff, Lekesha Hawes, filed the action against the defendant, Kennedy Gordy, alleging that the defendant hit the plaintiff with a chair. The plaintiff has properly dismissed all other defendants. However, the Judge finds that the services of the Statement of Damages are defective, and therefore, the plaintiff has not demonstrated that the defendant was properly served with the statement. Additionally, the Judge notes that the proposed judgment and declaration have defects, including inconsistencies in the amount of damages sought and lack of personal knowledge by the plaintiff's counsel. The Judge orders the plaintiff to correct these defects and submit a new default judgment package within a certain timeframe. Failure to do so may result in sanctions, including monetary sanctions and/or dismissal.
