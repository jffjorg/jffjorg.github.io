And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding a motion for leave to amend the complaint. The plaintiff, Jason Gray, was injured by a sidewalk on September 26, 2020, and filed a First Amended Complaint against the City of Rancho Palos Verdes, City of Rolling Hills Estates, and Palos Verdes Peninsula Unified School District. The plaintiff then filed a motion to add Palos Verdes Peninsula Unified School District as a defendant and to plead additional allegations. However, the court sustained Palos Verdes Peninsula Unified School District's demurrer on December 20, 2023, finding that the plaintiff untimely presented his government tort claim to Palos Verdes Peninsula Unified School District. The court finds that the motion is now moot and takes it off calendar. The parties are encouraged to meet and confer to reach an agreement, and if they do not, they should be prepared to appear remotely or in person for oral argument.
