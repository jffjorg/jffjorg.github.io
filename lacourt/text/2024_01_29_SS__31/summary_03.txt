Summary in English:

The Judge's tentative ruling is a proposed decision on a petition to approve a compromise of a pending action of a minor (Carlos Alvarado and Eduardo Alvarado). The Court excuses the personal appearance of the claimants and their guardian ad litems, and allows counsel to appear by telephone or video conference. The parties have agreed to settle the wrongful death matter for $1 million, with $300,000 apportioned to each minor claimant. The Court grants the petition for Dalary Alvarado, but denies the petition for Carlos and Eduardo due to a lack of clarity regarding the proposed real estate transaction. The Court requires the petitioner to submit a new petition curing this issue.
