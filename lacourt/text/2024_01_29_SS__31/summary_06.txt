And here is the English-text summary:

The [Tentative] Order Denying Request for Judicial Notice is issued by Judge Michelle C. Kim. The Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (LACMTA) requests the court to take judicial notice of four documents related to a case involving Santino Anthony Mitchell, including a Felony Abstract of Judgment, Reporter's Transcript, Felony Sentencing Memorandum, and Amended Felony Complaint. The defendants, Jonathan and Santino Mitchell, oppose the request. The judge denies the request because, according to California law, any matter to be judicially noticed must be relevant to a material issue, and the requested documents are not relevant. The parties are encouraged to meet and confer to reach an agreement or submit to the tentative ruling, and if they do not, they should appear remotely or in person for oral argument.
