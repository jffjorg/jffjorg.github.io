The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Benjamin Gonzalez vs. City of Los Angeles, et al. regarding a motion to compel production of documents. Defendant Kathryn M. Balsamo propounded a request for production of documents on July 12, 2023, and Plaintiff Benjamin Gonzalez failed to serve responses on or before August 13, 2023. Despite multiple requests and follow-up emails, Plaintiff did not serve responses until October 29, 2023. The judge finds the motion to compel moot due to the responses served prior to the hearing. However, the judge awards sanctions to Defendant Balsamo in the amount of $300, to be paid by Plaintiff and/or Plaintiff's counsel within 20 days. The judge also awards costs of $240 and a motion filing fee of $60. The parties are encouraged to meet and confer to reach an agreement, and if a party intends to submit on the tentative ruling, they must send an email to the court with the required information.
