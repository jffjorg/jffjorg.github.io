 Case Number:  21STCV17331    Hearing Date:   January 29, 2024    Dept:  31 SUPERIOR COURT OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA  FOR THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES - CENTRAL DISTRICT  JASON GRAY, by and through his Guardian ad Litem, GREGORY GRAY,¿  Plaintiff(s),¿¿  vs.¿  ¿CITY OF RANCHO PALOS VERDES, ET AL.,¿¿  Defendant(s).¿ ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) )       CASE NO: 21STCV17331  [TENTATIVE] ORDER TAKING MOTION FOR LEAVE TO AMEND OFF CALENDAR  Dept. 31 1:30 p.m. January 29, 2024  On October 6, 2023, Plaintiff Jason Gray, by and through his Guardian ad Litem, Gregory Gray (“Plaintiff”) filed his First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) action against Defendants City of Rancho Palos Verdes, City of Rolling Hills Estates, and Palos Verdes Peninsula Unified School District (“PVPUSD”) for injuries caused by a sidewalk, which Plaintiff alleges ejected him from his bicycle and caused him injury on September 26, 2020.    On September 18, 2023, Plaintiff filed the instant motion for leave to file an amended complaint to add PVPUSD as a defendant to this action and to plead additional allegations against PVPUSD.  However, on December 20, 2023, the Court sustained PVPUSD’s demurrer without leave to amend, on the grounds that Plaintiff untimely presented his government tort claim to PVPUSD, and that no amendment would cure the defect. (Min. Order, Dec. 20, 2023.) The timely presentation of a claim under the Tort Claims Act is not merely a procedural requirement but is an actual “element of the plaintiff's cause of action.” (Creighton v. City of Livingston (2009) 628 F. Supp. 2d 1199, 1225.) “The failure to timely present a proper claim … bars a plaintiff from filing a lawsuit against that entity. [Citation.]”  (Gong v. City of Rosemead (2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 363, 374.)  Since then, no party has filed anything additional relating to the motion. The Court finds the motion moot as a result of the December 20, 2023 ruling, and therefore Plaintiff’s motion for leave to amend is taken off-calendar.    Moving party is ordered to give notice.   PLEASE TAKE NOTICE: Parties are encouraged to meet and confer after reading this tentative ruling to see if they can reach an agreement. If a party intends to submit on this tentative ruling,¿the party must send an email to the court at¿sscdept31@lacourt.org¿with the Subject line “SUBMIT” followed by the case number.¿ The body of the email must include the hearing date and time, counsel’s contact information, and the identity of the party submitting.¿¿ Unless¿all¿parties submit by email to this tentative ruling, the parties should arrange to appear remotely (encouraged) or in person for oral argument.¿ You should assume that others may appear at the hearing to argue.¿¿ If the parties neither submit nor appear at hearing, the Court may take the motion off calendar or adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the Court.¿ After the Court has issued a tentative ruling, the Court may prohibit the withdrawal of the subject motion without leave.¿  Dated this 26th day of January 2024      Hon.
