```

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted Pasaca Capital, Inc.'s motion to seal certain portions of Sean E. Rogers' supplemental declaration. The motion was unopposed. The court found that Pasaca has shown that the confidential financial information contained in the declaration is sensitive and could be used to harm Pasaca's business interests if it were made public. The court also noted that the public interest in the information is low because it is not relevant to the merits of Pasaca's motion for a stay. The sealed information includes page 2, lines 21-27, and Exhibit A of the supplemental declaration.
