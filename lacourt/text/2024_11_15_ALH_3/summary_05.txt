This tentative ruling is about a hearing on November 15, 2024, regarding an application for a default judgment against G&P Hospitality, LLC. Plaintiff Perla Mageno seeks a default judgment, which includes statutory damages and injunctive relief. The only proposed judgment filed was rejected on July 16, 2024, so the hearing is continued to December 6, 2024, to allow Plaintiff to submit a new proposed judgment. The proposed judgment must be filed at least 5 court days before the hearing. If parties intend to submit to the tentative ruling, they must email the court by November 10, 2024. The judge, William A. Crowfoot, notes that if a party submits to the tentative but does not appear at the hearing, the opposing party may still appear and argue the matter. If no parties submit to the tentative and no one appears at the hearing, the court may adopt the tentative as the final order or remove the motion from the calendar.
