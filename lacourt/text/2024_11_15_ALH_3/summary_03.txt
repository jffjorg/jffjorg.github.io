Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has reviewed the motion for summary judgment filed by the defendant, East West Bank, and has granted the motion. The plaintiff, Renyong Dong, alleges that on December 13, 2022, she tripped on an uneven brick area located at or near East West Bank in Monterey Park. However, the Court has found that the defendant has met its burden of showing that the plaintiff cannot establish a dangerous condition existed at the time of the incident. The Court has considered the evidence presented, including photographs and measurements of the area where the plaintiff tripped, and has concluded that the height differential between the sidewalk and the walkway was minor and trivial. Additionally, the Court has noted that there were no complaints or requests for repair of the sidewalk in the 10 years prior to the plaintiff's incident, and that the first notice received by the defendant about any alleged defect in the sidewalk was in February 2023, after the plaintiff's incident. As a result, the Court has found that the plaintiff has failed to raise a triable issue of material fact and has granted the motion for summary judgment.
