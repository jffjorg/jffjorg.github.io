Plaintiffs Rose Lee Chun Huang, individually
and as successor in-interest of David Huang (“Huang”), Michael Huang, and
Evelyn Huang (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) move for orders compelling defendant
Aurora Las Encinas, LLC (“Defendant”) to serve further responses to Requests
for Production of Documents (Set Three), RFP Nos. 98, 100, 102, 104-107,
109-11, and 115, and Requests for Production of Documents (Set Four), RFP Nos. 128-129,
132-133, 135, and 137-139. 
 
RFP Set Three
Request Nos. 98, 100, 115 request all
videos depicting the area where Huang died. Defendant agreed to produce all the
videos in its possession and only produced a few videos. Defendant has since provided
further responses to these requests stating that responsive videos were
“recorded over in the ordinary course of business.” (Opp., pp. 5-6.) These
responses are Code-Compliant and the Court cannot compel Defendant to produce
evidence it does not have. Accordingly, the motion is DENIED as to RFP Nos. 98,
100, and 115.
RFP No. 102 seeks Defendant’s “governing
board minutes” from January 1, 2021, through January 1, 2024 (which is 2 years before
and 2 years after Huang’s death on March 22, 2022). Plaintiffs contend the
meeting minutes are discoverable because they could show if hospital
administration had knowledge of the problems related to rounding and violence
in the Mariah West Unit (where Huang was kept), or had knowledge of their
employees’ unfitness, authorized or ratified the wrongful conduct, or was
personally guilty of oppression, fraud or malice. 
Request Nos. 104-107, and 109-111 demand
documents related to Defendant’s history of patient-on-patient and patient-on-staff
violence. Plaintiffs state that the Department of Health Care Services (DHCS)
investigation into Huang’s death included a review of various materials related
to a concerning number of violent incidents at the hospital, including projects,
a binder, and other materials related to a Quality Assurance and Performance
Improvement (QAPI) project undertaken to address patient violence at the
facility. 
Defendant argues in opposition that the
board minutes and documents regarding hospital operations are immune from
discovery pursuant to Evidence Code section 1157. Section 1157 states, in
relevant part:
Neither the proceedings nor the records
of organized committees of medical … staffs in hospitals, or of a peer review
body, as defined in Section 805 of the Business and Professions Code, having
the responsibility of evaluation and improvement of the quality of care
rendered in the hospital, or for that peer review body . . . shall be subject
to discovery.
 
As the party claiming immunity from
discovery, Defendant carries the burden of showing that the evidence it seeks
to suppress is within the terms of the statute it relies upon. (Santa Rosa
Memorial Hospital v. Superior Court (1985) 174 Cal.App.3d 711, 727.) Defendant
only submits the declaration of Texanna Darrow, R.N., BSN, its director of
nursing, who states that she is “involved in quality assurance measures” and
states that the documents sought by Plaintiffs are part of “quality assurance
activities [which are] performed in order to improve the quality of patient
care.” (Opp., Darrow Decl., ¶¶ 1, 6.) This cursory statement is insufficient to
show that Evidence Code section 1157 applies. “Information developed or
obtained by hospital administrators or others which does not derive from an
investigation into the quality of care or the evaluation thereof by a medical
staff committee, and which does not disclose the investigative and evaluative
activities of such a committee, is not rendered immune from discovery under
section 1157 merely because it is later placed in the possession of a medical
staff committee or made known to committee members; and this may be so even if
the information in question may be relevant in a general way to the
investigative and evaluative functions of the committee.” Nurse Darrow’s
declarations of “quality assurance” and Defendant’s claim that quality
improvement activities could not be performed “if hospitals had to fear their
use in subsequent litigation” does not establish that the materials were part
of an investigation by an organized committee “having the responsibility of
evaluation and improvement of the quality of care rendered in the hospital.” A
medical staff committee is a specific organized body and does not encompass
general “quality assurance measures.”. As stated by the Court of Appeal in Santa
Rosa Memorial Hospital, Evidence Code section 1157 “does not shield from
discovery administrative activities which, while related to, are independent of
the investigative and evaluative activities of medical staff committees.” (Santa
Rosa Memorial Hospital, supra, 174 Cal.App.3d at p. 726.) “The
medical staff immunity described in section 1157 ... does not embrace the files
of the hospital administration (as distinguished from staff).” (Ibid.
[citing Matchett v. Superior Court (1974) 40 Cal.App.3d 623, 628.) 
Accordingly, Plaintiffs’ motion to
compel further responses to RFP Nos. 102, 104-107, and 109-111 is GRANTED. 
RFP Set Four
Plaintiffs seek further responses to
RFP Nos. 128-129, 132-133, 135, and 137-139. Defendant claims it served further
responses on October 17, 2024, agreeing to provide documents responsive to RFP
Nos. 128, 132, and 133. Accordingly, the motion is DENIED as to these RFPs. 
Request No. 129 asks for the Plan of
Correction that was submitted to the Department of Public Health issuing a
Statement of Deficiencies regarding Huang’s death. Defendant argues that this
is an improper request because Plaintiffs originally sought this information as
RFP No. 36 and waived their ability to seek a further response because they did
not file this motion within 45 days of receiving Defendant’s objections to RFP
No. 36. This argument is unpersuasive because Plaintiffs did in fact file a
motion to compel further with respect to RFP No. 36, but withdrew it upon
Defendant’s representation that the file was publicly available. Plaintiffs
later discovered that Defendant’s Plan of Correction was not in the public
record and thus served RFP No. 129. Because Plaintiffs previously filed a
motion to compel a further response to RFP No. 36, the Court does not find that
Plaintiffs have waived their right to enforce their inspection demand for the
Plan of Correction as reiterated in RFP No. 129. 
Defendant also argues that the Plan of
Correction should not be produced because it is confidential and cannot be used
as an admission against Defendant. (Health and Safety Code, § 1280, subd. (f).)
However, subdivision (e) of section 1280 states that the plan shall be open to
public inspection, undercutting Defendant’s claim of confidentiality. And, in
any event, any concerns of confidentiality should be a nonissue since a
protective order is in place in this action. Furthermore, “any party may obtain
discovery regarding any matter, not privileged, that is relevant to the subject
matter…, if the matter either is itself admissible in evidence or appears
reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2017.010.) Plaintiffs state the plan will “show whether it was
feasible for Defendants’ management to have taken steps to prevent [Huang]’s
death and yet, had chosen not to.” Therefore, even if the plan itself is not
admissible as an admission, it is admissible for feasibility. (Alcaraz v.
Vece (1997) 14 Cal.4th 1149, 1169.) Plaintiffs’ motion to compel a further
response to RFP No. 129 is GRANTED.
Next, RFP Nos. 135, 137, and 138 demand
complaints filed by patients as well as weekly reports and mock surveys.
Defendant objects on the grounds that these documents are protected by Evidence
Code section 1157. Plaintiffs argue that these routine documents are not part
of any protected investigation by a medical staff or peer review committee, but
as per Defendant’s PMK, were performed on a routine basis by Defendant’s parent
company, Signature Healthcare Services, LLC, which is an administrative entity.
Defendant’s only evidence that these documents are protected by Evidence Code
section 1157 is the declaration of Texanna Darrow, which, as discussed above,
is insufficient. Therefore, Plaintiffs’ motion to compel a further response to
RFP Nos. 135, 137, and 138 is GRANTED. 
Last, Plaintiffs’ RFP No. 139 demands
video footage of the Mariah West Unit from the date of Huang’s death with
Huang’s roommate’s face and body unblurred. Defendant objected to this request
on the grounds that it violated the roommate’s privacy rights and the video was
protected by the healthcare provider-patient privilege. The Court overrules
these objections and GRANTS Plaintiffs’ motion to compel a further response to
RFP No. 139, as consistent with its prior rulings on the discoverability of
information about Huang’s roommate. (See McGovern v. BHC Fremont Hospital,
Inc. (2022) 87 Cal.App.5th 181, 205.) 
Conclusion
Plaintiffs’ Motion to Compel Further
Responses to Request for Production of Documents (Set Three) is DENIED as to
RFP Nos. 98, 100, and 115 and GRANTED as to RFP Nos. 104-107, and 109-111.
Plaintiffs’ Motion to Compel Further
Responses to Request for Production of Documents (Set Four) is DENIED as to RFP
Nos. 128, 132, and 133 and GRANTED as to RFP Nos. 129, 135, and 137-139.
Further responses, without objections,
and responsive evidence must be produced by November 21, 2024.
