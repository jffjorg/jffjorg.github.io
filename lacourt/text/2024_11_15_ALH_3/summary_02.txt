Summary:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses a motion to compel further responses to Requests for Production of Documents (RFPs) by the plaintiffs, David Huang, et al. The motion seeks additional information and documents related to the death of David Huang, including videos, governing board minutes, and documents related to hospital operations. The defendant, Aurora Las Encinas, LLC, objects to the motion, claiming that some of the documents are protected by Evidence Code section 1157 and that others are confidential and privileged.

The judge grants the motion to compel further responses to RFP Nos. 104-107, 109-111, and 129-139, finding that the documents are discoverable and not protected by Evidence Code section 1157. The judge denies the motion as to RFP Nos. 98, 100, and 115, finding that the defendant has produced all responsive videos and has provided sufficient explanations for not producing other documents. The judge also grants the motion to compel a further response to RFP No. 139, which seeks video footage of the Mariah West Unit from the date of Huang's death.

The judge orders the defendant to produce further responses to the RFPs without objections by November 21, 2024.
