Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling grants Plaintiff's motion to compel further discovery responses in part, as to RFP Nos. 9, 15, 17, 20-21, 26, 32, 38, 40, 43-44, 49, 55, 61, 63, 66-67, and 72. The motion is denied as to all other requests. The Court finds that certain requests for production are overly broad or unintelligible, and that Defendant has already provided Code-compliant responses to certain requests. The Court also finds that Defendant is not required to produce documents that do not exist. The ruling is based on the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act and California Civil Code. The Court notes that Plaintiff's definitions of "Electrical Defects" and "Structural Defects" are overly broad and include symptoms that were not alleged in the Complaint. The Court also notes that Plaintiff's requests for production are not relevant to the issues in the case.
