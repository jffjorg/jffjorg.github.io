Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by the Montebello Unified School District (Defendant) to the complaint filed by Jane Doe (B.U.) and S.V. (Plaintiffs). The Plaintiffs allege that they were minor students at Bella Vista Elementary and were sexually assaulted and molested by Edward Portillo, a teacher, in 2004 and 2005.

The Defendant argues that the Plaintiffs did not present a timely pre-litigation claim and that the Legislature's retroactive elimination of the claim presentation element through AB 218 is unconstitutional and violates the Gift Clause of the California Constitution. The Defendant also argues that each of the Plaintiffs' causes of action fails to state sufficient facts and is uncertain.

The Court finds that AB 218's exemption to the claims presentation requirement does not create substantive liability where none previously existed. The Court also finds that the Defendant's demurrer is overruled on the ground that AB 218's retroactive waiver is not a gift of public funds.

The Court sustains the Defendant's demurrer as to the First Cause of Action for sexual harassment and overrules the demurrer as to the remaining causes of action. The Court finds that the Plaintiffs' allegations, if proven true, would show that the Defendant had constructive notice of Portillo's dangerous propensities and therefore, the demurrer is overruled.

The Court will issue a final ruling after considering submissions from the parties and hearing argument at the scheduled hearing date.
