Case

Analysis
 
1200 Management
LLC (Plaintiff) demurs to Liron
Shvartz and Black Rock Market Café, Inc.’s (Defendants) thirty-two affirmative defenses
contained in their answer. Plaintiff’s demurrer is overruled.
 
A.    Legal Standard
 
A demurrer is
sustained where “[t]he pleading does not state facts sufficient to constitute a
cause of action.” (Code Civ. Proc., 430.10, subd. (e).) “A demurrer tests the
legal sufficiency of the factual allegations in a complaint.” (Yalung v.
State (2023) 98 Cal.App.5th 71, 80.) In reviewing a complaint’s legal
sufficiency, a court will treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts
properly pleaded, but not contentions, deductions or conclusions of law. (Esparza
v. Kaweah Delta Dist. Hospital (2016) 3 Cal.App.5th 547, 552.) It is well
settled that a “demurrer lies only for defects appearing on the face of the
complaint[.]” (Stevens v. Superior Court
(1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 594, 601.) “We not only treat the demurrer as admitting
all material facts properly pleaded, but also give the complaint a reasonable
interpretation, reading it as a whole and its parts in their context.” (Guclimane Co. v. Stewart Tit. Guaranty Co.
(1998) 19 Cal.4th 26, 38.) For purposes of ruling on a demurrer, the complaint
must be construed liberally by drawing reasonable inferences from the facts
pleaded. (Wilner v. Sunset Life Ins. Co.
(2000) 78 Cal.App.4th 952, 958.)
 
When ruling
on a demurrer, a court may only consider the complaint’s allegations or matters
which may be judicially noticed. (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d
311, 318.) The Court may not consider any other extrinsic evidence or judge the
credibility of the allegations pleaded or the difficulty a plaintiff may have
in proving his allegations. (Ion Equipment
Corporation v. Nelson (1980) 110 Cal.App.3d 868, 881.) A demurrer is
properly sustained when the complaint, liberally construed, fails to state
facts sufficient to constitute any cause of action. (Kramer v. Intuit Inc. (2004) 121 Cal.App.4th 574, 578.) Demurrer is
also appropriate where the pleading is uncertain, ambiguous, or unintelligible.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (f).)
 
A party may
demur to an answer when “[t]he answer does not state facts sufficient to
constitute a defense.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.20, subd. (a).) The answer must
include facts supporting any defenses “as carefully and with as much detail as
the facts which constitute the cause of action and which are alleged in the
complaint.” (FBI Development, Inc. v. Nakashima (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d
367, 384.) However, in pleading a defense under the statute of limitations, it
is not necessary to state specific facts showing the defense. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 458.) If not raised in the answer at all, matters constituting an affirmative
defense are irrelevant at trial. (Carranza v. Noroian (1966) 240 Cal.App.2d
481, 488.) However, a defense that is defectively pleaded may still be allowed
if the pleading gives the plaintiff sufficient notice to prepare a defense. (Harris
v. City of Santa Monica (2013) 56 Cal.4th 203, 240.) 
 
When a
demurrer is sustained, the Court determines whether there is a reasonable
possibility that the defect can be cured by amendment. (Blank, supra,
39 Cal.3d at p. 318).  When a plaintiff “has pleaded the general set of
facts upon which his cause of action is based,” the court should give the plaintiff
an opportunity to amend his complaint, since plaintiff should not “be deprived
of his right to maintain his action on the ground that his pleadings were
defective for lack of particulars.” (Reed v. Norman (1957) 152
Cal.App.2d 892, 900.) The Court may grant leave to amend an answer so long as
there is no prejudice to the plaintiff. (Hong Sang Market, Inc. v. Peng
(2018) 20 Cal.App.5th 474, 488.)
 
B.     Discussion
 
Plaintiff demurs to Defendants’
affirmative defenses contained in their answer on the ground that Defendants
have failed to state facts sufficient to constitute those defenses. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 430.20, subd. (a).) As a threshold matter, “[e]ach ground of demurrer
must be in a separate paragraph and must state whether it applies to the entire
complaint, cross-complaint, or answer, or to specified causes of action or
defenses.” (Rules of Court, rule 3.1320(a).) A demurrer may be disregarded if
it fails to distinctly specify any of the grounds upon which objections to the
answer are taken. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.60.) 
 
Here, in a single
paragraph, Plaintiff demurs to every affirmative defense alleged by Defendants
because they fail to state sufficient facts. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.20, subd.
(a).) Thus, Plaintiff demurs to each affirmative defense separately rather than
the answer as a whole, yet fails to set out the specific grounds as to each
defense in a separate paragraph. Plaintiff having violated the California Rules
of Court, the Court may disregard its demurrer. Moreover, while the affirmative
defenses may be in some cases standard boilerplate, the Court believes in
general they do allege sufficient ultimate facts to withstand demurrer.  A better, more efficient way to proceed in
this case is for Plaintiff to propound discovery asking for supporting
evidentiary facts.
 
Nevertheless, the
Court will address the one defense for which Plaintiff offers actual argument.
.Plaintiff argues that Defendants’ twentieth affirmative defense under the
statute of frauds is insufficiently pled. Defendants assert that Plaintiff’s
claim for breach of contract is barred by the statute of frauds. (Answer ¶ 20.)
The statute of frauds applies to contracts regarding the lease of real property
for longer than one year. (Civ. Code, § 1624, subd. (a)(3).) The lease at issue
in the present case is for a period longer than one year. (Compl., Ex. B.) Thus,
this is a potentially applicable defense. Accordingly, Plaintiff’s demurrer is
overruled.
 
C.    
 Conclusion
 
The Court overrules
Plaintiff’s demurrers to the Answer.
