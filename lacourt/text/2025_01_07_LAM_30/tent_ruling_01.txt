BUCHANAN vs BENECIA DIONIDO BUCHANAN, et al.
Case # 23STCV26521
            
MOTION
TO COMPEL DISCOVERY 
 
On September
23, 2024, Defendant noticed the deposition of Plaintiff for October 15, 2024. (Id.
¶ 2.) Plaintiff sat for deposition on October 15 after objecting to the
attendance of a third party who left of their own accord, but the deposition
concluded early because of a medical emergency for Plaintiff’s counsel. (Id.
¶ 3–4; Passman Decl. ¶ 3.) Defendant continued the deposition until October 31,
2024. (Chamberlin Decl. ¶ 5.) Plaintiff refused to attend the continued
deposition, objecting to the presence of the third party. (Id. ¶ 7.)
Defendant filed the present motion to compel on November 15, 2024. Plaintiff
filed an opposition on December 5. Defendant filed a reply on December 12.
            A
deposition notice served on the deponent is effective to require any person who
is a party to the action to attend and testify. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.280,
subd. (a).) “If, after service of a deposition notice, a party to the action .
. . without having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails to
appear for examination . . . the party giving the notice may move for an order
compelling the deponent’s attendance and testimony.” (Id. § 2025.450,
subd. (a).) 
 
            Here,
Defendant has properly noticed Plaintiff’s deposition. (Chamberlin Decl. ¶¶ 2, 5.)
Plaintiff must serve a valid objection to defeat the present motion to compel. Defendant
is not a native English speaker and has requested the presence of her CPA and
friend, Frederico Quinto, to help her understand the proceedings.  Plaintiff argues that Defendant is required
to make a showing of good cause to allow for the attendance of Mr. Quinto,
citing Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.420. However, that section instead
allows for the imposition of a protective order excluding certain persons from
a deposition upon a showing of good cause by the objecting party. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2025.420, subd. (b)(12).) Plaintiff has not moved for such a
protective order, and section 2025.420 does not place a burden on Defendant to
justify every attendee at a deposition. Thus, Plaintiff’s objection is not
well-taken. Accordingly, the Court will grant Defendant’s motion.
 
            Defendant
requests monetary sanctions. If a motion to compel deposition is granted, “the
court shall impose a monetary sanction . . . in favor of the party who noticed
the deposition and against the deponent or the party with whom the deponent is
affiliated, unless the court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust.” (Id., § 2025.450, subd. (g)(1).) Here,
Plaintiff not having lodged a proper objection, the Court does not find that Plaintiff
acted with substantial justification. Thus, sanctions are warranted. 
 
Defendant’s counsel alleges an hourly rate of $200 and 10.2
hours of work in connection with the present motion, totaling $2,040 in
attorney’s fees. (Chamberlin Decl. ¶ 12(a).) Defendant’s counsel additionally
alleges 3.5 hours of work in connection with the present motion from the lead
paralegal with an hourly rate of $210, totaling $735 in fees. (Id. ¶
12(b).) Lastly, Defendant’s counsel alleges a $61.65 filing fee for the present
motion. (Id. ¶ 12(c).) Accordingly, the Court awards $2,836.65 in
sanctions ([$200 per hour] x [10.2 hours] + [$210 per hour] x [3.5 hours] +
[$61.65] = [$2,836.65]).
 
Conclusion:
 
            The Court grants
Defendant’s motion to compel and awards $2,836.65 in sanctions to Defendant.  Plaintiff shall make himself available to
conclude the deposition within 15 days. 
Sanctions to be paid within 30 days.
