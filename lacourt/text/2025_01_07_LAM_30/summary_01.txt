And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the defendant's motion to compel the plaintiff's deposition. The defendant properly noticed the deposition, but the plaintiff refused to attend the continued deposition, citing an objection to the presence of a third party. The court finds that the plaintiff did not serve a valid objection to defeat the motion to compel, and therefore grants the motion. The court also awards the defendant $2,836.65 in sanctions for the plaintiff's refusal to comply with the deposition notice. The plaintiff is required to make himself available to conclude the deposition within 15 days, and the sanctions must be paid within 30 days.
