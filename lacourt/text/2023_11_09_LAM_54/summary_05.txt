Here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the defendants' motion to compel arbitration, pending a court hearing on November 9, 2023. The defendants had sought to compel arbitration based on a Dispute Resolution Agreement executed by the plaintiff on September 6, 2022. However, the judge found that the agreement is not enforceable under the Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Act (EFASASHA) because all of the plaintiff's causes of action relate to alleged sexual harassment and Labor Code violations. The judge noted that while the defendants had met their burden to establish an agreement to arbitrate, the plaintiff had raised a valid defense to enforcement under EFASASHA.
