Hearing Date: November 9, 2023
Department 54, Judge Maurice A. Leiter
(2) Petitions for Minor/Person with a
Disability’s Compromise
Moving Party: Minor Plaintiff Brandon Diaz and
Disabled Plaintiff Yeni Reyes
Responding Party: None
 
T/R:     THE PETITIONS ARE GRANTED ON THE
CONDITIONS DISCUSSED BELOW.
 
PLAINTIFFS TO NOTICE.
 
If the parties wish to submit on the tentative, please
email the courtroom at SMCdept54@lacourt.org with
notice to opposing counsel (or self-represented party) before 8:00 am on the
day of the hearing. 
 
The Court considers the moving papers.
No opposition has been received.
 
Compromises of disputed claims brought by minors are governed in part by
CCP § 372. The statute allows a guardian ad litem to appear in court on behalf
of a minor claimant and gives the guardian ad litem the power to compromise the
minor’s claim “with the approval of the court in which the action or proceeding
is pending.”  A petition for court
approval of a compromise must be verified by the petitioner and must contain a
full disclosure of all information that has any bearing upon the reasonableness
of the compromise or covenant.  (CRC Rule
7.950.)
 
CRC Rule 7.952(a) requires the attendance of the petitioner and claimant
at the hearing on the compromise of the claim unless the court for good causes
dispenses with their personal appearance.
 
“Neither section 372 nor the California Rules of Court (rules 7.950
& 7.952) contemplates a noticed motion and adversary hearing when court
approval of a minor's compromise is sought. Although we need not decide the
question, it would appear that a petition to approve or disapprove a minor's
compromise may be decided by the superior court, ex parte, in chambers.”  (Pearson v. Superior Court (2012) 202
Cal. App. 4th 1333, 1337.)  
 
Claimants move for approval of a settlement with Defendants Shlomo
Botach and S. Botach Management in which claimants each would receive $12,429.00
out of a total settlement of $87,000.00. Attorneys’ fees of $4,971.00 and costs
of $843.00 will be deducted from disabled claimant Reyes’ settlement amount and
attorneys’ fees of $3,728.00 and costs of $843.00 will be deducted from minor
claimant Diaz’s settlement.  Disabled
claimant's net proceeds are $6,615.00 Minor claimant’s net proceeds are $7,858.00.
The settlement funds will be deposited into blocked accounts.
 
This is a landlord-tenant action. The Court finds that the individual
settlements are fair in light of the alleged injuries sustained by claimants. But
the Court finds that a 40% contingency fee on disabled claimant's settlement is
excessive. Counsel’s declaration stating “a lot of legal work was performed”
does not justify a 40% fee for disabled claimant, when minor Plaintiff’s fee is
only 30%. Counsel may recover a 30% fee for disabled claimant.
