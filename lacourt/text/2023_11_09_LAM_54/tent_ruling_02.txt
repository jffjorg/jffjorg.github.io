The Court considers the moving papers, oppositions,
and replies.
 
A. Plaintiffs’
Motion for Attorney’s Fees
 
Plaintiffs move for an award of attorney’s fees under Labor Code §§ 1194,
218.5 and 2802. Plaintiffs seek
$622,121.50, inclusive of a 1.3 multiplier.
 
 
 
 
1.    Reasonableness of Fees
 
Plaintiffs’ counsel
represents that they spent 950.6 hours (including 7.3 hours to draft the reply
and attend the hearing on this motion) prosecuting this action. Counsel’s
hourly rates range from $900.00 to $125.00. In opposition, Defendants argue that
counsel’s hourly rates are unreasonable and the number of hours is excessive.
Defendants assert Plaintiffs should not recover for clerical or duplicative
tasks and should not recover for time spent on the claims for failure to
provide meal and rest breaks. The Court has reviewed counsel’s hours in this
action and finds them reasonable. This action lasted three years and included
motion work and a multi-day bench trial. The Court does not take issue with
counsel’s hourly rates.
 
2.    Multiplier
 
Plaintiffs request that the Court apply a 1.3 multiplier to counsel’s
fees. The Court is permitted, but not required, to apply a multiplier to an
award for attorney’s fees if, among other factors, there was contingent risk or
exceptional skill displayed by the attorneys. (Ketchum v. Moses (2001)
24 Cal.4th 1122, 1138.) In applying a multiplier for
contingent risk, “the trial court should consider whether, and to what
extent, the attorney and client have been able to mitigate the risk of
nonpayment…” (Id.) The Court declines to award a multiplier. Though
there was contingency risk, the action was not so complicated to justify a 30%
increase in fees.
 
3.    CCP § 998 Offer
to Compromise
 
Defendants assert Plaintiff Lamm cannot recover fees incurred after
rejecting Defendants’ 998 offer for $75,000.00. Courts have held that section
998 does not alter costs and fees awarded under one-way cost shifting
provisions like Labor Code § 1194. (See Cruz
v. Fusion Buffet, Inc. (2020) 57
Cal.App.5th 221, 239-242.) Section 998 is not applicable here.
 
Plaintiffs’ motion for
attorney’s fees is GRANTED in the reduced amount of $478,555.00 (plus time
spent on the reply for this motion and attendance of the hearing).
 
B. Plaintiffs’
Motion to Tax Costs
 
Except as otherwise expressly provided
by statute, “a prevailing party is entitled as a matter of right to recover
costs in any action or proceeding.”  (CCP
§ 1032(b).)  “Allowable costs shall be
reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation rather than merely
convenient or beneficial to its preparation.” 
(CCP § 1033.5(c)(2).)  “If the
items appearing in a cost bill appear to be proper charges, the burden is on
the party seeking to tax costs to show that they were not reasonable or
necessary.”  (Ladas v. California
State Auto. Assn. (1993) 19 Cal. App. 4th 761, 774.)  “On the other hand, if the items are properly
objected to, they are put in issue and the burden of proof is on the party
claiming them as costs.”  (Ibid.)
 
Plaintiffs move to tax Defendants’ costs on the ground that they cannot
recover costs under the one-way cost shifting provisions of Labor Code §§ 1194
and 218.5 and because section 998 does not apply when Labor Code §§ 1194 and
218.5 are implicated. Plaintiffs also argue that Defendants Scott and McGuire
cannot recover any costs because Defendants have failed to apportion costs
between them.
 
After trial, the Court found
for Plaintiffs and against Defendants Bedrock Protection Agency, LLC and Paul
Nelson on the second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth causes of action, and
against Defendant Bedrock Protection Agency, LLC on the eighth cause of action.
The Court found for all Defendants on the first and seventh causes of action.
Finally, the Court ordered judgment in favor of Defendants Scott and McGuire
against Plaintiffs on all causes of action. 
 
Under this judgment,
Defendants Bedrock Protection Agency, LLC and Paul Nelson are not entitled to
recover their costs. Plaintiffs received a net monetary recovery and are the
prevailing parties against these Defendants. Labor Code § 218.5 allows an employer to recover costs only if
Plaintiff brought the claim in bad faith. There is no evidence showing bad
faith. Additionally, as stated above, Courts have held that section 998 does
not alter costs and fees awarded under one-way cost shifting provisions like
Labor Code § 1194. (See Cruz v. Fusion Buffet, Inc. (2020) 57
Cal.App.5th 221, 239-242.)
 
 Defendants Scott and McGuire may
be entitled to some costs as they prevailed on all causes of action against
Plaintiffs. Defendants, however, have failed to make any effort to apportion their
costs. 
 
Plaintiffs’ motion to tax costs is GRANTED.
 
C. Defendants’
Motion to Tax Costs
 
Defendants assert that Plaintiffs’ costs must be reduced because
Plaintiff Lamm rejected Defendants’ 998 offer and because Plaintiffs did not prevail
against Defendants Scott and McGuire. Section 998 does not apply here.
Plaintiffs cannot recover costs against Scott and McGuire. Defendants are not
entitled to an apportionment on these grounds.
 
Defendants also take issue with entries not explicitly allowable by
statute, including travel expenses, messenger and service fees, transcript
costs, expert fees, and postage costs. The Court will allow Plaintiffs to
recover travel expenses (other than those withdrawn by Plaintiffs in
opposition) and messenger fees as they were reasonably necessary to conduct
litigation. The Court strikes Plaintiff’s expert costs, transcript costs and
FedEx postage costs as they are not statutorily recoverable.
 
Defendants’ motion to tax costs is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part.
