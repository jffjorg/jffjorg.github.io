And here is the English-text summary:

Judge Maurice Leiter's tentative ruling in Case No. 20STCV08408 grants the Plaintiffs' Motion for Attorney's Fees in the amount of $478,555.00, plus time spent on the reply for this motion and attendance of the hearing. The Court also grants the Plaintiffs' Motion to Tax Costs. The Defendant's Motion to Tax Costs is granted in part and denied in part. The Court finds that the Plaintiffs are the prevailing parties against the Defendants Bedrock Protection Agency, LLC and Paul Nelson, and therefore are entitled to recover their costs. The Court also allows the Plaintiffs to recover travel expenses and messenger fees, but strikes other costs as not statutorily recoverable.
