And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of Defendant Robert McFarlane's motion to set aside the October 2, 2023 order awarding evidence, issue, and monetary sanctions against him. The order was set aside in its entirety due to excusable neglect on the part of Defendant's counsel, who did not receive notice of the motions for sanctions. The judge found that the neglect was due to Plaintiff's counsel sending the moving papers to the wrong email address, which was flagged as spam. The judge also noted that Defendant's counsel provided the correct email for service in 2021. The judge will grant the motion, and if the parties wish to submit on the tentative, they must email the courtroom by 8:00 am on the day of the hearing.
