TENTATIVE RULINGS – COMPEL RESPONSES
BACKGROUND
Plaintiffs, Gabriela Ramirez Cuenca and David Christopher Gemus, filed a
Complaint on 06/16/2023 alleging three causes of action for: (1) Violation of
Song-Beverly Act – Breach of Express Warranty, (2) Violation of Song-Beverly
Act – Breach of Implied Warranty, and (3) Violation of Song-Beverly Act Section
1793.2.
 
MOTION 1 - RELIEF REQUESTED¿ 
“Plaintiffs, GABRIELA RAMIREZ CUENCA
and DAVID CHRISTOPHER GEMUS (hereinafter “Plaintiffs”), will, and hereby do, move
for an order to compel responses, without objections, to Plaintiffs’ Form and
Special Interrogatories, Set One (“Interrogatories”). Plaintiffs’
Interrogatories were initially served and propounded on Defendant by Plaintiffs
on August 16, 2023.
 
This Motion is made pursuant to
California Code of Civil Procedure, sections 2033.280, subdivision (a), and
2033.280, subdivision (b), on the grounds that Defendant FCA US LLC
(“Defendant”) has failed to provide any responses to Plaintiffs’ Interrogatories,
which seek information directly relevant to their claims under the Song-Beverly
Consumer Warranty Act. Thus, Plaintiffs seek an order compelling Defendant to
produce responses, without objections, within 10 calendar days of the Court’s
order. 
 
The Motion is based upon this
Notice, the following Memorandum of Points and Authorities, the Declaration of
Gregory Sogoyan, the pleadings, and papers on file herein, and upon any other

LEGAL
STANDARD – COMPEL RESPONSES, INSPECTION DEMANDS
Within
30 days after service of a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or
sampling, the party to whom the demand is directed shall serve the original of
the response to it on the party making the demand, and a copy of the response
on all other parties who have appeared in the action, unless on motion of the
party making the demand, the court has shortened the time for response, or
unless on motion of the party to whom the demand has been directed, the court
has extended the time for response. (CCP § 2031.260(a).)
If a party to whom a demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling is directed fails to serve a timely response to it, the
party making the demand may move for an order compelling response to the
demand. (CCP § 2031.300(b).)
If a party to whom a demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling is directed fails to serve a timely response to it, the
party to whom the demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is
directed waives any objection to the demand, including one based on privilege
or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section
2018.010). (CCP § 2031.300(a).) “The court, on motion, may relieve that
party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following conditions
are satisfied: (1) The party has subsequently served a response that is in
substantial compliance with Sections 2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230, 2031.240,
and 2031.280. (2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response was the result
of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.” (CCP § 2031.300(a)(1)-(2).)
Unlike a motion to compel further responses, a motion
to compel responses is not subject to a 45-day time limit, and the propounding
party does not have to demonstrate either good cause or that it satisfied a
“meet and confer” requirement. (Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v.
Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 404
citing Weil and Brown, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (The
Rutter Group 2006) ¶¶ 8:1137 to 8:1144, pp. 8F-59 to 8F-60, ¶¶ 8:1483 to
8:1489, pp. 8H-29 to hH-30 (Weil & Brown).)
LEGAL STANDARD –REQUEST TO DEEM ADMISSIONS ADMITTED
“Within 30 days after service of requests for
admission, the party to whom the requests are directed shall serve the original
of the response to them on the requesting party, and a copy of the response on
all other parties who have appeared, unless on motion of the requesting party
the court has shortened the time for response, or unless on motion of the
responding party the court has extended the time for response.” (CCP § 2033.250(a).)
 
If a party to whom
requests for admission are directed fails to serve a timely response, the
requesting party may move for an order that the genuineness of any documents
and the truth of any matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted, as
well as for a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010). (CCP § 2033.280(b).) 
Further, “If
a party to whom requests for admission are directed fails to serve a timely
response, the following rules apply: (a) The party to whom the requests for
admission are directed waives any objection to the requests, including one
based on privilege or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4
(commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that
party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following
conditions are satisfied: (1) The party has subsequently served a response
that is in substantial compliance with Sections 2033.210, 2033.220, and
2033.230. (2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response was the
result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.” (CCP § 2033.280(a).)
“The court shall
make this order, unless it finds that the party to whom the requests for
admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a
proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial
compliance with Section 2033.220.” (CCP § 2033.280(c).)
LEGAL
STANDARD – COMPEL RESPONSES, INTERROGATORIES
Within 30 days after service of interrogatories, the party to whom the
interrogatories are propounded shall serve the original of the response to them
on the propounding party, unless on motion of the propounding party the court
has shortened the time for response, or unless on motion of the responding
party the court has extended the time for response. (CCP § 2030.260(a).)
If
a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to serve a timely response,
the party propounding the interrogatories may move for an order compelling
response to the interrogatories. (CCP § 2030.290(b).)
“The
party to whom the interrogatories are directed waives any right to exercise the
option to produce writings under Section 2030.230, as well as any objection to
the interrogatories, including one based on privilege or on the protection for
work product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on
motion, may relieve that party from this waiver on its determination that both
of the following conditions are satisfied: (1) The party has subsequently
served a response that is in substantial compliance with Sections 2030.210,
2030.220, 2030.230, and 2030.240. (2) The party’s failure to serve a timely
response was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.” (CCP §
2030.290(a).)
Unlike
a motion to compel further responses, a motion to compel responses is not
subject to a 45-day time limit, and the propounding party does not have to
demonstrate either good cause or that it satisfied a “meet and confer”
requirement. (Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 404 citing Weil and
Brown, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter Group
2006) ¶¶ 8:1137 to 8:1144, pp. 8F-59 to 8F-60, ¶¶ 8:1483 to 8:1489, pp. 8H-29 to
hH-30 (Weil & Brown).)

TENTATIVE RULING 
Plaintiffs lumped what
should have been four motions into three motions.
A motion must be brought separately as to each
discovery method at issue. The instant three motions should have been filed as four
separate motions and four filing fees paid. Plaintiffs’ Motion 1 lumped
compelling responses to Form and Special Interrogatories, Set One, into one
motion when it should have been filed as two separate motions, i.e., one motion
for FROGs and one motion for SROGs. “[P]ayment of filing fees is both mandatory
and jurisdictional.” (Hu vs. Silgan Containers Corp. (1999) 70 Cal. App.
4th 1261, 1269.)  
If
Plaintiffs want these four motions to be heard, they can pay the additional
filing fee to the Court before the hearing and show proof of payment of the
additional filing fee before the hearing.
Alternatively,
Plaintiffs are welcome to request the Court to advance and continue the instant
hearings to a date that all four motions will be scheduled for; however,
Plaintiffs are warned that all motions must provide sufficient notice to
Defendant. Further, the Plaintiffs would need to clarify which discovery method
Motion 1 will pertain to on the future hearing date, i.e., will Motion 1
pertain to special interrogatories or form interrogatories. Presumably, the
additional motion filed will clearly indicate what individual discovery method
it pertains to, i.e. FROGs or SROGs.
As
to the merits of these motions, on August 16, 2023, Plaintiffs served Form
Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, Requests for Production of Documents,
and Requests for Admissions, Set One, on Defendant. (Sogoyan Decl. ¶ 8.)
As
of the date of the Sogoyan Declaration [April 8, 2024], Defendant had failed to
provide any responses to the discovery served on August 29, 2023. (See Sogoyan
Declarations ¶ 15 FROGs/SROGs, ¶ 13 RPDs, ¶ 13 RFAs. Therefore, Defendant did
not provide timely responses.
On
5/15/2024, Defendant submitted Oppositions to the instant motions. These
Oppositions are untimely; however, the Court will utilize its discretion and
consider the untimely Oppositions.
The
Oppositions indicate that on May 15, 2024, Defendant provided verified
responses to the instant discovery. (See Dao Decl. ¶ 4.)
The
Court notes that although Defendant’s counsel indicates that the untimely
responses were verified, the Court does not see verifications with the
Oppositions.
All
three Oppositions are identical to each other. 
As
to the Oppositions to the SROGs/FROGS and RPDs, Defendant argues that it didn’t
waive objections because it served responses that were substantially compliant
and the failure to timely respond was due to mistake, inadvertence, or
excusable neglect. 
Those
arguments are unavailing. Whether Defendant served substantially compliant
responses, or whether the untimely responses were due to mistake, inadvertence,
or excusable neglect, is irrelevant for compelling initial responses to
interrogatories and RPDs at this hearing. That standard is only relevant if
Defendant files a motion to be relieved from waiver of objections. Defendant
has not filed a motion to be relieved from waiver of objections, and the
Oppositions are not considered motions to be relieved from waiver of
objections. 
As
to Motions 1 and 2, because responses were untimely served, but served before
the hearing, Plaintiffs’ Motions 1 and 2 are DENIED as moot. 
However,
Defendant waived objections because it didn’t timely provide responses. A
motion to be relieved from waiver of objections has not been filed.
Therefore,
Defendant’s arguments that the untimely responses were served in substantial
compliance and were due to mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect are not
before this Court
The
Court will hear argument as to Motion 3. 
Under
§ 2033.280(c) it appears as if the RFAs should not be deemed admitted if they
were served in substantial compliance with § 2033.220. “The court shall make
this order, unless it finds that the party to whom the requests for admission
have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed
response to the requests for admission that is in substantial compliance with Section
2033.220.” (CCP § 2033.280(c).)
Here,
Defendant’s untimely responses appear to be substantially compliant under § 2033.220,
and they were provided before the hearing. Therefore, under § 2033.280(c) it
appears as if Motion 3 should be denied as moot. 
However,
on the other hand, it could be argued that, under St. Mary v. Superior Court
(2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 762, 782, the untimely responses that were served
before the hearing are not considered to be substantially compliant for not
being verified. 
Further,
what is unclear when reading §§ 2033.280(a) & 2033.280(c) is the following:
§ 2033.280(a) makes it clear that Defendant needs to file a motion to be
relieved from waiver of objections if Defendant did not want to waive its
objections to RFAs due to untimely responses. 
Here,
Defendant has not filed a motion for relief from waiver of objections. “If a
party to whom requests for admission are directed fails to serve a timely
response, the following rules apply: (a) The party to whom the requests
for admission are directed waives any objection to the requests, including one
based on privilege or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4
(commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that
party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following
conditions are satisfied: (1) The party has subsequently served a response
that is in substantial compliance with Sections 2033.210, 2033.220, and
2033.230. (2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response was the
result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.” (CCP § 2033.280(a).)
However,
§ 2033.280(c) makes clear that the court is not to deem the RFAs admitted if
responses are served in substantial compliance before the hearing. 
The
uncertainty is that if the Court rules the untimely responses are substantially
compliant, despite there being no verifications, there is a question as to
whether objections been waived since no motion for relief from wavier of
objections has been filed.
“The
RFA device is not intended to provide a windfall to litigants. Nor is the RFA
procedure a ‘gotcha’ device in which an overly aggressive propounding
party—who rejects facially reasonable requests for a short discovery extension
and thereafter files the wrong discovery motion after service of a slightly
tardy proposed RFA response that is substantially code-compliant—may obtain a
substantive victory in the case by having material issues deemed admitted. RFAs
are not to be deemed admitted unless the party to whom RFAs are propounded
fails to respond prehearing to RFAs in a manner that is substantially
code-compliant (§ 2033.280, subd. (c)), or he or she is recalcitrant and
violates a court order compelling further responses that are deficient (§
2033.290, subd. (e)). Furthermore, the order deeming admitted the 41 RFAs, to
the extent that it may substantially impact St. Mary's ability to prove her
case, undermines public policy that promotes controversies being resolved
through trials on the merits. (See New Albertson's, Inc., supra, 168
Cal.App.4th at pp. 1420–1421, 86 Cal.Rptr.3d 457 [court's discretion under
§ 2033.300 to grant party leave to withdraw or amend RFA responses based upon
“mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect” must be exercised consistently
with “the spirit of the law and in a manner that serves the interests of
justice”; policy favoring trial on the merits dictates that any doubts be
resolved in favor of party seeking relief].)”
(St.
Mary v. Superior Court (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 762, 783-784.)
The
Court will hear argument.

Sanctions - Inspection Demands
In relevant part, 2031.300(c) states as follows:
Except as provided
in subdivision (d), the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to a demand for inspection,
copying, testing, or sampling, unless it finds that the one subject to the
sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make
the imposition of the sanction unjust.
 
(CCP §
2031.300(c).)
 
Sanctions –
Requests for Admission
“It is mandatory that the court impose a monetary
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) on the party or
attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a timely response to requests for
admission necessitated this motion.” (CCP § 2033.280(c).) 
Sanctions – Interrogatories
CCP
§ 2030.290 states in relevant part:
The court shall
impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010)
against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a
motion to compel a response to interrogatories, unless it finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.
 
(CCP §
2030.290(c).)



Sanctions Ruling
“The
court may award sanctions under the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files
a motion to compel discovery, even though no opposition to the motion was
filed, or opposition to the motion was withdrawn, or the requested discovery
was provided to the moving party after the motion was filed.” (Cal. Rules of
Court, Rule 3.1348(a).) 
 
The Court will
discuss the sanctions issue with the parties.
