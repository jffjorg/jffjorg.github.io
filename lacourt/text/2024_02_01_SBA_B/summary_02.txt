And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to continue the trial date and all related dates. The motion was filed by the defendants, Armando Solares and Maria Solares, and requested that the trial date be continued to no earlier than April 15, 2024. However, the judge notes that the trial date was already continued to April 15, 2024 at an ex parte hearing on January 5, 2024, and therefore the motion is "moot" and denied. The judge cites California Rule of Court 3.1332, which sets forth the procedures for requesting a continuance of a trial date, and notes that continuances are disfavored and must be granted only on an affirmative showing of good cause.
