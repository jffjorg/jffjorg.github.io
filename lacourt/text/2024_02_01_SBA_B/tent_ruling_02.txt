BACKGROUND
On August 3, 2021, plaintiff Maria
De Jesus Olmedo filed a complaint against Armando Solares, Maria Solares, and
Armando Solares Jr. for (1) violation of LACC 8.52.130 et seq. (retaliatory
eviction and anti-harassment), (2) violation of Civil Code §1940.2, (3)
violation of IMC 8-133 et seq. (Inglewood Rent Stabilization Ordinance), (4)
violation of Civil Code §1941.1, and (5) violation of Bus. & Prof. Code
§17200. 
On December 8, 2021, plaintiff
filed a request for dismissal as to Armando Solares, Jr. 
On April 14, 2023, pursuant to
stipulation and order, the trial date and all related dates was continued from
May 3, 2023 to August 16, 2023.
On August 1, 2023, pursuant to
stipulation and order, the trial date and all related dates was continued to
February 14, 2024. 
On January 5, 2024, at an ex parte
hearing, the court continued the trial date to April 15, 2024. 
LEGAL AUTHORITY
Pursuant to CRC Rule 3.1332, “(a)
To ensure the prompt disposition of civil cases, the dates assigned for a trial
are firm.  All parties and their counsel
must regard the date set for trial as certain. 
(b) A party seeking a continuance of the date set for trial, whether
contested or uncontested or stipulated to by the parties, must make the request
for a continuance by a noticed motion or an ex parte application under the
rules in chapter 4 of this division, with supporting declarations.  The party must make the motion or application
as soon as reasonably practical once the necessity for the continuance is
discovered.  (c) Although continuances of
trials are disfavored, each request for a continuance must be considered on its
own merits.  The court may grant a
continuance only on an affirmative showing of good cause requiring the
continuance. . . .”   
            CRC Rule 3.1332(d) sets forth other
factors that are relevant in determining whether to grant a continuance.
DISCUSSION
            Defendants
request that the court continue the February 14, 2024 trial date to no earlier
than April 15, 2024.
As stated
above, at an ex parte hearing, the court continued the trial date to April 15,
2024.
Thus, the
motion is MOOT.
            Defendants
are ordered to give notice of the court’s ruling.
