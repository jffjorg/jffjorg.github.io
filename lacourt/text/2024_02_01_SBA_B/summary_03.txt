Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling is a continuation of the motion for summary judgment and summary adjudication filed by defendant Zane Consulting. The court notes that the parties have been working diligently to resolve discovery disputes, but the discovery process remains incomplete. The plaintiff requests a continuance to complete discovery, citing outstanding issues and unresolved disputes. The court grants the continuance and orders the motion to be continued to a later date. The judge finds that a continuance is warranted due to the ongoing discovery disputes and the need for additional time to obtain necessary facts.
