And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling denying the motion to stay filed by defendants Meis Design Studio, LLC and Perkins Eastman Architects, DPC. The defendants had argued that New York was a suitable alternative forum for the action and that the balance of private and public interest factors favored staying the action and transferring it to New York.

The court found that, while a suitable alternative forum did exist in New York, the private and public interest factors did not weigh heavily in favor of staying the action. The court noted that the plaintiff, Dan Meis, was a California resident and that the action involved interests concerning California courts and juries. The court also found that remote appearances would be permitted, which would mitigate some of the prejudice that the defendants would suffer in defending the action in California.

As a result, the court denied the motion to stay and will proceed with the action in California.
