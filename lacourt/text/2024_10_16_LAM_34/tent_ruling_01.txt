Judgment on The Pleadings is DENIED. 
 
2.         Defendant/Cross-Complainant Gohar Babazadeh’s Motion for

Background
On May 3, 2023 Jila Babazadeh-Shraga (“Jila”)
filed a Complaint against Gohar Babazadeh (“Gohar”), Elizabeth Babazadeh as
Executor of The Estate of Louise Babazadeh, Elizabeth Babazadeh, as Trustee of
The Babazadeh Family Trust (“Elizabeth”), Shalom Brothers Enterprises, L.P.
(“Shalom”); Hayem’s Daughters, Inc. (“Hayem”); and all persons unknown claiming
any legal or equitable right, title, estate, lien or interest in the property
described in the complaint adverse to Jila’s title, or any cloud on Jila’s title.
The caption of the complaint lists seven causes of
action; however, the body of the complaint only alleges four: (1) winding down
and liquidation of Shalom against Shalom, Gohar, and Elizabeth; (2) judicial
dissolution of Hayem against Hayem, Gohar, and Elizabeth; (3) partition of 2207
Veteran Avenue, Los Angeles, California 90064 (“Veteran Property”) against
Gohar and anyone unknown persons claiming an interest in the Veteran Property;
and (4) declaratory relief against Gohar and Elizabeth.
The complaint stems from allegations that a
partnership is being continued contrary to its governing documents. Shalom is a
limited partnership in which Jila owns 33.33%. (Complaint, ¶ 1.) Jila’ sister
Gohar also owns 33.33% of Shalom, while Ebrahim Babazadeh (“Ebrahim”) was the
General Partner. (Id. at ¶ 2.) Pursuant to the Partnership Agreement
(“PA”) that governed Shalom, the death of a General Partner triggered the
winding down of Shalom. (Id., Exh. 1, ¶ 2.6.) Ebrahim died on June 5,
2010. However, the complaint alleges Gohar seized control of Shalom and has
continued to operate Shalom for 13 years as a limited partner. (Complaint,
¶10.) Jila then filed suit requesting (1) the wind up and liquidation of
Shalom, (2) the dissolution and wind up of Hayem, a corporation where both
sisters own 33.33% of stock, and (3) the partition by sale of real property
located at 2207 Veteran Avenue, Los Angeles, California 90034 (the “Veteran
Property”) jointly owned by Jila and Gohar.
On June 22, 2023, Gohar filed a cross-complaint alleging
causes of action against Jila and Roes 1-25 for:
1.              
Winding Down and
Liquidation of Shalom Brothers Enterprise, L.P.; and
2.              
Partition. 
On September 11, 2024, the court granted Jila’s
Motion for Summary Judgment and ordered to (1) terminate, wind down, and
liquidate Shalom in accordance with the PA that governed Shalom; (2) order a
judicial dissolution of Hayem and grant judicial supervision of the winding up
of Hayem, and (3) order a sale and partition of the Veteran Property, with
proceeds of the sale to be divided in accordance with the ownership of the
Veteran Property which is 50% each to Jila and Gohar. 
On September 12, 2024, Jila filed their Motion for
Judgement on the Pleadings. On September 30, 2024, Gohar filed their opposition
to Jila’s motion. On September 30, 2024, Jila filed their reply to Gohar’s
opposition. 
On September 18, 2024, Gohar filed their Motion
for Judgment on the Pleadings. On October 3, 2024, Jila filed their opposition
to Gohar’s motion. As of October 8, 2024, Gohar has not filed a reply to Jila’s
opposition.

against that defendant.
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 438, subd. (c)(1)(B).)

only defects disclosed on the face of the pleadings or by matters that 
can be judicially noticed.” (Cloud
