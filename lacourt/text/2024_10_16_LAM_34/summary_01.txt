Summary:
The Judge issues a tentative ruling on the motions for judgment on the pleadings filed by Jila Babazadeh-Shraga and Gohar Babazadeh. Jila's motion is denied because the court's previous order granting her motion for summary judgment renders her motion moot. Gohar's motion is granted because the court's previous order granting Jila's motion for summary judgment also grants the relief requested in Gohar's cross-complaint.
