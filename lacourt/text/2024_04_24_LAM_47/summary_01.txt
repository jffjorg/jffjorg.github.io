And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants Plaintiff's motion to rescind the settlement agreement. The agreement was improperly procured by duress, menace, and undue influence. The court concludes that there was actual duress, finding Haghshenas's general denials to be less credible than Plaintiff's detailed testimony of the discussions which took place. The court also finds that the agreement was secured by fraudulent inducement through Haghshenas's misrepresentation that Plaintiff's counsel had not conveyed prior settlement offers to him. The court rescinds the settlement agreement and restores the parties to their pre-settlement positions.
