Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the defendant's motion to set aside the default and default judgment. The defendant, Steven Schultz, contends that he was not properly served with the summons and complaint because the service was made at the subject property, which was closed and locked at the time. The plaintiff, Steven R. Glatts, attempted to serve the defendant four times at the subject property, but the defendant was not personally served. The defendant provided evidence that the mailed documents were never delivered. The judge finds that the defendant has met his burden to produce evidence demonstrating that he was not properly served and that the plaintiff's multiple unsuccessful attempts at personal service followed by ineffective service via posting and mailing fail to establish proper notice to the defendant. The judge grants the defendant's motion and orders him to file his answer within 10 days of the order.
