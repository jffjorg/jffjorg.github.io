And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the defendants' motion to strike the plaintiff's claim for punitive damages. The plaintiff, Martina A. Silas, alleges that she sustained an injury from using the QuietOn Active Noise Cancelling Earbuds, which she purchased from defendant The Grommet. The defendants argue that the plaintiff's claim for punitive damages is based solely on two 1-star reviews for the Earbuds, which do not mention any injury from the product. The judge finds that the plaintiff's allegations of corporate liability for punitive damages are sufficient, despite the defendants' argument that the plaintiff fails to plead specific facts establishing corporate liability. The judge also finds that the plaintiff's allegations of defendant knowledge of earlier complaints and failure to take action to investigate or remove the product from the market are sufficient to support a claim for punitive damages. The motion to strike is denied.
