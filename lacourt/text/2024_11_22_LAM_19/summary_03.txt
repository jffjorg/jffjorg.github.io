Significant Statements:
  - The Court finds that the plaintiff has already received a judicial determination that they are entitled to a judgment in their favor for the $300,000.00 "Held Back Funds"
  - The Court denies the motion for summary judgment as it would result in the plaintiff receiving a double recovery for the same $300,000.00 "Held Back Funds"
  - The Court finds that the plaintiff's arguments in their supplemental brief do not compel a different conclusion
  - The Court agrees with the plaintiff that the judgment entered on September 5, 2018 only concerned the settlement with Wilshire Escrow regarding the $372,705.00 "Escrow Funds", but the Order constitutes a determination that the plaintiff is entitled to judgment for the $300,000.00 "Hold Back Funds" at issue here.
