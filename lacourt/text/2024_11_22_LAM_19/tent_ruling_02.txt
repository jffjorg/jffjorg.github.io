STATEMENT OF THE CASE 
On July 21,
2021, Petitioner Cynthia Medina initiated the instant action by filing her
“Petitioner For Assignment Of Case Number In Arbitration Proceeding” (the
“Petition”) and naming Respondent BAH California, Inc. dba Church’s Chicken as
the sole respondent. 
 The Petition
seeks the assignment of a case number pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 1281.98. 
The Petition itself
does not contain any factual allegations, but attached to the Petition is the
declaration of Mitch Rosensweig. In the declaration, Mr. Rosensweig indicates
that an arbitration was initiated with JAMS in June 2018. (Mitch Rosensweig Decl.,
¶ 2.) Mr. Rosensweig attests that the parties entered into a settlement
agreement, namely, the “Confidential Settlement Agreement, General Release Of
All Claims, And Stipulation For
Execution Of Arbitration Award” attached to the declaration as Exhibit A
(hereafter, the “Settlement Agreement”). (Id. at ¶ 3, Ex. A [the
Settlement Agreement].) Mr. Rosensweig attests that “Respondent is currently in default
under the terms of the Settlement Agreement.” (Id.) 
The Settlement Agreement provides
that, in the event of a default, Petitioner is entitled to the execution by the
arbitrator of the Arbitration Award attached to the Settlement Agreement as
Exhibit B and “shall also be immediately entitled to bring a motion to have
attorney’s fees and costs determined by the arbitrator as set forth in Section
3(b)(2)” (Id. at ¶ 3, Ex. A at § 5(b).) 
Mr. Rosensweig attests
that Petitioner “filed with JAMS her Motion for Attorneys’ Fees and Costs and
Stipulated Arbitration Order and Award,” (id. at ¶ 4), but that
Respondent failed to pay the JAMS invoice for the required arbitrator
compensation deposit, thereby defaulting on the arbitration proceedings. (Id.
at ¶ 6.) 
On December 10,
2021, Respondent filed a Notice of Stay of Proceedings due to the initiation of
bankruptcy proceedings for Respondent. 
On June 28,
2022, the stay was lifted. (See June 28, 2022 Minute Order, p. 1.) On December
9, 2022, Respondent filed a Notice of Termination of Stay. 
On March 6,
2024, Petitioner filed the instant Motion to Enter Judgment and Award Attorney’s Fees and Sanctions Against
Respondent BAH California, Inc., dba Church’s Chicken In The Amount Of
$546,652.56 Pursuant To C.C.P. §§ 1281.98 And 1281.99 (the “Motion”). 
GROUNDS FOR MOTION 
Pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure sections 1281.98 and 1281.99, Petitioner moves for an order entering ¿ judgment and awarding
monetary sanctions, including attorney’s fees and costs in the amount of
$546,652.56, against Respondent on the ground that Respondent breached the
terms of the Settlement Agreement. 
Petitioner alternatively moves
for an award of attorney’s fees pursuant to Government Code section 12965. 
DISCUSSION 
Petitioner moves for  the following relief: (1) entry of judgment;
(2) an award of attorney’s fees and costs pursuant to both Code of Civil
Procedure sections 1281.98 and 1281.99 and Government Code section 12965; and
(3) prejudgment interest. (See Motion, pp. 3, 6-9.) 
I.              
ENTITLEMENT TO RELIEF REQUESTED 
As an initial matter, Respondent
has not appeared in the action and has not filed an opposition to the Motion,
effectively consenting to the Court granting the requested relief. (See Cal. R.
Ct., 8.54(c) [“A failure to oppose a motion may be deemed a consent to the
granting of the motion.”]; Sexton v. Superior Court (1997) 58
Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410.) 
A.   
Legal Standards 
Code of Civil Procedure section
1281.98 provides that: 
(a) (1) In an
employment or consumer arbitration that requires, either expressly or through
application of state or federal law or the rules of the arbitration provider,
that the drafting party pay certain fees and costs during the pendency of an
arbitration proceeding, if the fees or costs required to continue the
arbitration proceeding are not paid within 30 days after the due date, the
drafting party is in material breach of the arbitration agreement, is in
default of the arbitration, and waives its right to compel the employee or consumer
to proceed with that arbitration as a result of the material breach.
 
(2) The arbitration
provider shall provide an invoice for any fees and costs required for the
arbitration proceeding to continue to all of the parties to the arbitration.
The invoice shall be provided in its entirety, shall state the full amount owed
and the date that payment is due, and shall be sent to all parties by the same
means on the same day. To avoid delay, absent an express provision in the
arbitration agreement stating the number of days in which the parties to the
arbitration must pay any required fees or costs, the arbitration provider shall
issue all invoices to the parties as due upon receipt. Any extension of time
for the due date shall be agreed upon by all parties. Once the invoice has been
paid, the arbitration provider shall provide to all parties a document that
reflects the date on which the invoice was paid.
 
(b) If the drafting
party materially breaches the arbitration agreement and is in default under
subdivision (a), the employee or consumer may unilaterally elect to do any of
the following:
(1) Withdraw the
claim from arbitration and proceed in a court of appropriate jurisdiction. If
the employee or consumer withdraws the claim from arbitration and proceeds with
an action in a court of appropriate jurisdiction, the statute of limitations with
regard to all claims brought or that relate back to any claim brought in
arbitration shall be tolled as of the date of the first filing of a claim in
any court, arbitration forum, or other dispute resolution forum.
 
(2) Continue the
arbitration proceeding, if the arbitration provider agrees to continue
administering the proceeding, notwithstanding the drafting party’s failure to
pay fees or costs. The neutral arbitrator or arbitration provider may institute
a collection action at the conclusion of the arbitration proceeding against the
drafting party that is in default of the arbitration for payment of all fees
associated with the employment or consumer arbitration proceeding, including
the cost of administering any proceedings after the default.
 
(3) Petition the
court for an order compelling the drafting party to pay all arbitration fees
that the drafting party is obligated to pay under the arbitration agreement or
the rules of the arbitration provider.
 
(4) Pay the
drafting party’s fees and proceed with the arbitration proceeding. As part of
the award, the employee or consumer shall recover all arbitration fees paid on
behalf of the drafting party without regard to any findings on the merits in
the underlying arbitration.
 
(c) If the employee
or consumer withdraws the claim from arbitration and proceeds in a court of
appropriate jurisdiction pursuant to paragraph (1) of subdivision (b), both of
the following apply:
(1) The employee or
consumer may bring a motion, or a separate action, to recover all attorney’s
fees and all costs associated with the abandoned arbitration proceeding. The
recovery of arbitration fees, interest, and related attorney’s fees shall be
without regard to any findings on the merits in the underlying action or
arbitration.
 
(2) The court shall
impose sanctions on the drafting party in accordance with Section 1281.99.
 
(d) If the employee
or consumer continues in arbitration pursuant to paragraphs (2) through (4) of
subdivision (b), inclusive, the arbitrator shall impose appropriate sanctions
on the drafting party, including monetary sanctions, issue sanctions, evidence
sanctions, or terminating sanctions.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1281.98.) 
Code of Civil Procedure section
1281.99 provides that:
 
(a) The court shall
impose a monetary sanction against a drafting party that materially breaches an
arbitration agreement pursuant to subdivision (a) of Section 1281.97 or
subdivision (a) of Section 1281.98, by ordering the drafting party to pay the
reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees and costs, incurred by the
employee or consumer as a result of the material breach.
(b) In addition to
the monetary sanction described in subdivision (a), the court may order any of
the following sanctions against a drafting party that materially breaches an
arbitration agreement pursuant to subdivision (a) of Section 1281.97 or subdivision
(a) of Section 1281.98, unless the court finds that the one subject to the
sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make
the imposition of the sanction unjust.
(1) An evidence
sanction by an order prohibiting the drafting party from conducting discovery
in the civil action.
 
(2) A terminating
sanction by one of the following orders:
 
(A) An order
striking out the pleadings or parts of the pleadings of the drafting party.
 
(B) An order
rendering a judgment by default against the drafting party.
 
(3) A contempt
sanction by an order treating the drafting party as in contempt of court.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1281.99.)
 
In the event of a default
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1281.98, Code of Civil Procedure
section 1281.99 sets forth sanctions that are both mandatory, (see Code Civ.
Proc., § 1281.99(a)), and discretionary. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 1281.99(b).) 
Code of Civil Procedure section
1280, subdivision (e) provides that: 
“Drafting party”
means the company or business that included a predispute arbitration provision
in a contract with a consumer or employee. The term includes any third party
relying upon, or otherwise subject to the arbitration provision, other than the
employee or consumer.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1280(3).) 
B.   
Analysis
 
For the following reasons, the
Court finds, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 1281.98 and 1281.99, that
Petitioner is entitled to (1) entry
of judgment; (2) prejudgment interest; and (3) reasonable attorney’s fees and
costs pursuant to both Code of Civil Procedure sections 1281.98 and 1281.99.
 As set forth in the declaration
of Mitch Rosensweig attached to the Petition and in the declaration of Michael
Schwimer attached to the Motion, the arbitration between Petitioner and
Respondent commenced in June 2018 and resulted in the June 2020 execution of
the Settlement Agreement. (Rosensweig Decl. at ¶¶ 2-3; Michael Schwimer Decl.,
¶¶ 2-5.) 
The Settlement Agreement provides
that, as consideration for Petitioner releasing Respondent from the claims
asserted in the arbitration, Respondent agrees to pay to Petitioner $75,000.00
as compensatory damages for Petitioner’s alleged damages, paid in four (4)
equal installments. (Rosensweig Decl. at ¶ 3, Ex. A at § 3(a).) 
In addition, the Settlement
Agreement provides that: 
Respondent will
pay Claimant reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs incurred on behalf of
Claimant to the date of the execution of this agreement pursuant to the
following procedure:
(1) By the date set
forth in Section 5(a)(1), Claimant shall set forth in writing to Respondent the
amount of attorney’s fees and costs Claimant has incurred. Respondent shall
then have until the date set forth in Section 5(a)(3) to pay said amount or pay
such other amount as Claimant is willing to accept in full satisfaction of the
attorney’s fees and costs claimed.
 
(2) If Respondent
has failed to satisfy the attorney’s fees and costs claimed by Claimant by the
date set forth in Section 5(a)(3), Claimant shall have until the date set forth
in Section 5(a)(4) to file a motion for the arbitrator to determine the amount
of reasonable fees and costs to award. Thereafter, the arbitrator shall set a
briefing schedule and hearing date not to exceed 30 days from the date of the
filing of the motion (or as soon thereafter as the arbitrator’s schedule will
permit). The arbitrator’s decision shall conform to applicable California
statutory and case law including without limitation California Government Code
section 12965(b) and for the purposes of ruling on the motion only, Claimant
shall be considered the “prevailing party” in this action as that term is used
in the applicable statutory and case law.
(Id. at § 3(b).)
 
Thus, the Settlement Agreement
provides that, if Respondent does not agree to or otherwise pay the attorney’s
fees and costs claimed by Petitioner, then the arbitrator shall make a final
determination of the amount of attorney’s fees and costs that Respondent must
pay to Petitioner as consideration for the release. (Id.; see Schwimer Decl., ¶ 5.) 
By way of the instant Motion,
Petitioner argues that Respondent defaulted on its obligation to pay the
$75,000.00 in compensatory damages, and therefore seeks entry of judgment for
the $75,000.00 plus prejudgment interest and monetary sanctions, including
attorney’s fees and costs. (Motion at pp. 3-4, 7, 12; Schwimer Decl. at ¶ 5.) 
Section 5, subdivision (a) of the
Settlement Agreement provides that:
 
¿Provided Claimant does not
revoke this Settlement Agreement within the allotted time and that Jackson
Lewis P.C. (“Respondent’s Counsel”) has received all of the following: (i) the
Settlement Agreement bearing the dates and signatures of Claimant; (ii) an
updated Employee’s Withholding Allowance Certificate (IRS Form W-4) for
Claimant; (iii) fully executed Requests for the Taxpayer Identification Number
and Certification (IRS Form W-9) for both Claimant and Claimant’s Counsel; and
(iv) an original letter from Claimant in the form attached as Exhibit “A” and
signed and dated at least eight (8) days after Claimant’s execution of this
Settlement Agreement, Respondent, through Respondent’s Counsel, shall make
available to Claimant’s Counsel the sums described more fully in Sections 3(a)
and (b) above as follows:
 
(1) The sums set
forth in Section 3(a)(1) by October 1, 2020;
(2) The sum of
$11,250.00 set forth in Section 3(a)(2) by October 1, 2020;
(3) The first sum
of $18,750.00 set forth in Section 3(a)(2) by November 2, 2020;
(4) The second sum
of $18,750.00 set forth in Section 3(a)(2) by December 1, 2020;
(5) The third sum
of $18,750.00 set forth in Section 3(a)(2) by January 4, 2021; and
(6) If the
attorney’s fees and costs are determined by the arbitrator pursuant to Section
3(b)(2), said amount shall be paid in full within 30 days of the arbitrator
providing electronic notice of the amounts so determined.
(Rosensweig Decl. at ¶ 3, Ex. A
at § 5(a).) 
Section 5, subdivisions (b)
through (d) of the Settlement Agreement governs the event of a default and
provides that: 
(b) In the event
Respondent fails to timely make any payment as set forth in Section 5(a),
Claimant shall provide written notice to Respondent’s Counsel by sending an
email to Leonora.Schloss@JacksonLewis.com. Respondent’s failure to cure any
such missed payment within five (5) calendar days after receipt of the
aforementioned written notice shall constitute an Event of Default. There is no
cure period for the initial payments set forth in Sections 5(a)(1) and (2).
Additionally, an Event of Default shall occur in the event Respondent or any of
them are the subject of a petition or action for relief that is brought by or
against such person or entity, pursuant to the United States Bankruptcy Code
(Title 11, U.S. Codes) in effect
from time to time (excluding, however, involuntary petitions or actions brought
under the United States Bankruptcy Code that are dismissed within one hundred
twenty (120) days of filing). Upon an Event of Default, Claimant shall be
immediately entitled to the full amount set forth in Section 3(a) less any
payments actually received by Claimant prior to the Event of Default. Claimant
shall also be immediately entitled to bring a motion to have attorney’s fees
and costs determined by the arbitrator as set forth in Section 3(b)(2).
 
(c) By signing this Agreement, the
Parties stipulate to the execution by the arbitrator of the Arbitration Award
attached hereto as Exhibit B. The arbitrator shall enter amounts in the blank
spaces corresponding to the attorney’s fees and costs, respectively, determined
by the arbitrator or otherwise agreed to by Claimant and Respondent. The
original Arbitration Award shall be held by Claimant, and in the Event of
Default, Claimant shall be entitled to immediately petition any court of
competent jurisdiction to confirm the award, obtain a judgment thereon,
and execute upon the judgment so obtained, and Respondent waives any right to
petition to correct or vacate any such confirmed award. Provided however, that
upon Respondent’s complete satisfaction of the payments specified in Section
5(a), Claimant shall return the original Arbitration Award to Respondent and
destroy any copies thereof, and within ten (10) days of the receipt of the last
payment, Claimant shall cause this arbitration to be dismissed (or the
equivalent thereof).
 
(d) If the date by
which any payment required herein is to be made available to Claimant’s Counsel
falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday in the State of California, then
the date said payment shall be made available to Claimant’s Counsel shall be
the next following day which is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday in the
State of California.
(Id. at § 5(b)-(f).)
 
The Court finds that Petitioner
demonstrates that she timely complied with the provisions of the Settlement
Agreement, but that Respondent failed to make the first installment payment.
(Schwimer Decl. at ¶ 6.) The Court finds that Petitioner demonstrates that she
complied with the written notice requirements in by Section 5, subdivision (b).
(Id. at ¶ 6, Ex. B.) 
The Court finds that Petitioner demonstrates that she
sought to obtain the arbitration award and her attorney’s fees and costs from
the arbitrator as stipulated by the parties in the Settlement Agreement, but
that the proceeding could not proceed because Respondent failed to pay the
March 26, 2021 JAMS invoice for fees billed to Respondent by JAMS. (Id.
at ¶ 7, Ex. C.)  
Accordingly, the Court finds that Respondent
materially breached the Settlement Agreement. 
As such, pursuant to Section 5,
subdivision (b) of the Settlement Agreement, the Court finds that Petitioner is
entitled to have a judgment entered for the full $75,000.00. 
Further, the Court finds that,
pursuant to Civil Code sections 3287 and 3289, subdivision (b) and Section 5 of
the Settlement Agreement, Petitioner is also entitled to prejudgment interest
on the $75,000.00 at a rate of ten percent (10%) per annum, or $20.55 per diem,
beginning October 1, 2020, (Settlement Agreement at § 5(a)(1); see id.
at § 5(b)), through the date of entry of judgment. 
Additionally, the Court also finds that, pursuant to Code
of Civil Procedure sections 1281.98 and 1281.99 and Section 3, subdivision (b)
and Section 5 of the Settlement Agreement, Petitioner is also entitled to
recover reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees and costs, incurred by
Petitioner “to the date of execution” of the Settlement Agreement, (Settlement
Agreement at § 3(b)), and as a result of Respondent’s breach. (Id. at §§
3(b), 5(a); Code Civ. Proc., § 1281.98(c), 1281.99(a).) 
The Court rejects Petitioner’s contention that “CCP §§
1281.98 and 1281.99 contain no ‘reasonableness’ standard…,” and that she is
entitled to “all attorney’s fees and all costs associated with the abandoned
arbitration proceeding” regardless of whether they were reasonably incurred.
(Motion at p. 9.) Code of Civil Procedure section 1281.99 provides for “the
reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees and costs, incurred by the
employee or consumer as a result of the material breach,” (Code Civ. Proc., §
1281.99(a)), and the Settlement Agreement provides that “Respondent will pay
Claimant reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs incurred on behalf of Claimant to
the date of the execution of this agreement pursuant to” the procedure in
Section 3(b). (Settlement Agreement at § 3(b).) 
Thus, the Court finds that, while Petitioner is entitled
to recover attorney’s fees and costs “to the date of execution” of the
Settlement Agreement, (Settlement Agreement at § 3(b)), and as a result of
Respondent’s breach, (id. at §§ 3(b), 5(a)), such fees and costs must
still be “reasonable” in order to be recovered. 
Given that the Court finds that
Petitioner is entitled to the requested relief pursuant to the terms of the
Settlement Agreement and Code of Civil Procedure sections 1281.98 and 1281.99,
the Court need not and does not address Petitioner’s alternative request for an
award of attorney’s fees pursuant to Government Code section 12965. 
II.           
CALCULATIONS
 
A.   
Prejudgment Interest 
As stated above, the Court finds
that Petitioner is entitled to prejudgment interest on the $75,000.00 at a rate
of ten percent (10%) per annum, or $20.55 per diem, beginning October 1, 2020,
through the date of entry of judgment, November, 22, 2024. The Court calculates
that there are 1514 days from and including 10/01/2020 to and including
11/22/2024. The Court calculates that 1514 x $20.55 = $31,112.70 
Accordingly, the Court awards
Petitioner $31,112.70 in prejudgment interest. 
 B.   
Attorney’s Fees 
1.    
Legal Standards
 
As explained by the Court of Appeal in Christian
Research Institute v. Alnor (2008) 165 Cal.App.4th 1315:
 
A trial court assessing attorney fees
begins with a touchstone or lodestar figure, based on the careful compilation
of the time spent and reasonable hourly compensation of each attorney ...
involved in the presentation of the case. The court tabulates the attorney fee
touchstone, or lodestar, by multiplying the number of hours reasonably expended
by the reasonable hourly rate prevailing in the community for similar work.
[T]he lodestar figure may be increased or decreased depending on a variety of
factors, including the contingent nature of the fee award. …absent
circumstances rendering the award unjust, an attorney fee award should
ordinarily include compensation for all the hours reasonably spent, including
those relating solely to the fee. … ‘padding’ in the form of inefficient or
duplicative efforts is not subject to compensation. 
(Id. at 1321 (internal citations and quotations
omitted). 
A party requesting a fee award “‘is not necessarily
entitled to compensation for the value of attorney services according to [his]
own notion or to the full extent claimed by [him].’” (Levy v. Toyota
Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc. (1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 807, 816 (quoting Salton
Bay Marina, Inc. v. Imperial Irrigation Dist. (1985) 172 Cal.App.3d
914, 950) (internal citation omitted).) 
The party seeking attorney fees and costs “bear[s] the
burden of establishing entitlement to an award and documenting the appropriate
hours expended and hourly rates” to show that the fees incurred were allowable
and reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation. (Christian Research
Institute, supra, 165 Cal.App.4th at 1320 (internal citations and
quotations omitted); see Levy, supra, 4 Cal.App.4th at 816.)  “To that end, the court may require [a]
defendant[ ] to produce records sufficient to provide a proper basis for
determining how much time was spent on particular claims.” (Ibid.) “The
court also may properly reduce compensation on account of any failure to
maintain appropriate time records.” (Id. (internal citation omitted)
(quoting ComputerXpress, Inc. v. Jackson (2001) 93 Cal.App.4th 993, 1020).)
“The evidence should allow the court to consider whether the case was
overstaffed, how much time the attorneys spent on particular claims, and
whether the hours were reasonably expended.” (Id. (citing ComputerXpress,
Inc., supra, 93 Cal.App.4th at 1020).) 
A trial court has broad discretion to award attorney fees
in an amount that is less than the lodestar amount and, to discourage claimants
from making an unreasonable demand, may deny altogether a fee request that
appears unreasonably inflated. (Id. at 1321-1322; see Serrano v.
Unruh (1982) 32 Cal.3d 621, 635.) 
“The basis for the trial court's calculation must be the
actual hours counsel has devoted to the case, less those that result from
inefficient or duplicative use of time.” (Horsford v. Board Of Trustees Of
California State University (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 359, 395.) “The law is
clear, however, that an award of attorney fees may be based on counsel's
declarations, without production of detailed time records.” (Raining Data
Corp. v. Barrenechea (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 1363, 1375.) “[T]he verified
time statements of the attorneys, as officers of the court, are entitled to
credence in the absence of a clear indication the records are erroneous.” (Horsford,
supra at 396; City of Colton v. Singletary
(2012) 206 Cal.App.4th 751, 785 (same).)
“‘In
challenging attorney fees as excessive because too many hours of work are
claimed, it is the burden of the challenging party to point to the specific
items challenged, with a sufficient argument and citations to the evidence.
General arguments that fees claimed are excessive, duplicative, or unrelated do
not suffice. Failure to raise specific challenges in the trial court forfeits
the claim on appeal.’” (Lunada Biomedical v. Nunez (2014) 230
Cal.App.4th 459, 488 (quoting Premier Medical Management Systems, Inc. v.
California Ins. Guarantee Assn. (2008) 163 Cal.App.4th 550, 564).) 
“[T]he trial court is in the best
position to value the services rendered by the attorneys in his or her
courtroom, and this includes the determination of the hourly rate that will be
used in the lodestar calculus.” (569 East County Boulevard LLC v.
Backcountry Against the Dump, Inc. (2016) 6 Cal.App.5th 426, 436-437
(internal citation omitted); see, e.g., Wilkerson v. Sullivan (2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 443, 448 [“The reasonableness of
attorney fees is within the discretion of the trial court, to be determined from
a consideration of such factors as the nature of the litigation, the complexity
of the issues, the experience and expertise of counsel and the amount of time
involved. The court may also consider whether the amount requested is based
upon unnecessary or duplicative work.”]; Christian Research
Institute, supra, 165 Cal.App.4th at 1321-1322 [ascertaining the amount of
attorney’s fees to be awarded is left to the sound discretion of the trial
court and the trial court need not simply award the sum requested].) 
In setting the hourly rate
for an attorney fees award, courts are entitled to consider the rate of “fees
customarily charged by that attorney and others in the community for similar
work.” (Bihun v. AT&T Information Systems, Inc. (1993) 13 Cal. App.
4th 976, 997 [affirming rate of $450 per hour], overruled on other grounds by Lakin
v. Watkins Associated Indus. (1993) 6 Cal. 4th 644, 664; see also Heritage
Pacific Financial, LLC v. Monroy (2013) 215 Cal.App.4th 972, 1009 [“[R]ate
determinations in other cases, particularly those setting a rate for the
plaintiffs' attorney, are satisfactory evidence of the prevailing market
rate.”].) “In making its calculation, the court may rely on its own
knowledge and familiarity with the legal market, as well as the experience,
skill, and reputation of the attorney requesting fees, the difficulty or
complexity of the litigation to which that skill was applied, and affidavits
from other attorneys regarding prevailing fees in the community and rate
determinations in other cases.” (569 East County Boulevard LLC, supra, 6
Cal.App.5th at 437 (internal citations omitted).) 
2.    
Analysis 
Petitioner requests a lodestar of
$266,497.03 plus a 2x multiplier, for a total of $532,994.06 in attorney’s

Michael
Schwimer (attorney) – 5.5hrs @ $850/hr = $4,675.00
·      
Christina
Arreola (paralegal) – 3.25hrs @ $150/hr = $485.50
·      
$324.93
in costs

As explained by the Court in its
October 23, 2024 Minute Order: 
…the submissions
filed by Petitioner are insufficient to determine whether the requested hourly
compensation for each attorney is reasonable. There is no information provided
regarding the background and experience of each billing attorney, or past hourly
rate awards by other courts.
(October 23, 2024 Minute Order,
p. 1.) 
On November 14, 2024, in response
to the Court’s October 23, 2024 Minute Order, Petitioner filed the supplemental
declaration of Michael Schwimer. 
After consideration of the
supplemental declaration of Michael Schwimer, and relying on its own knowledge
and familiarity with the legal market, the Court approves the hourly rates as requested. 
b.    
Hours Billed
 
i.              
Hours Requested Up to Filing of Motion 
Given Respondent’s failure to
file any opposition to the Motion, the Court finds that Respondent fails to
sustain its burden to challenge any of the fees requested as excessive. 
Nonetheless, after a careful review of the billing
records, the Court makes the following reductions: (1) the Court does not award
the 5.5 hours billed by ZW on 12/12/2017, which total $4,675.00, on the basis that it is duplicative
and excessive since MS also billed 5.5 hours on 12/17/2017 for case strategy
and document review; (2) the Court does not award the 1.5 hours billed by JT on
08/29/2018, which totals $742.50,
on the basis that it is duplicative and excessive since ZW and MS also billed
1.5 hours each for a meeting regarding “file transfer to arbitration”; (3) the
Court does not award the 10 hours billed by MS on 06/25/2019, totaling $8,500.00, because MR also
billed 9.25 hours to attend the mediation, MR billed substantial time to
prepare the mediation brief, and the Court finds that MS did not also need to
bill to attend the mediation; (4) the Court does not award the 2.75 hours
billed by MS on 10/26/2020, totaling $2,337.50, or the .5 hours billed by MS on 10/27/2020, totaling $425.00, in connection with
the fee motion since MR also billed substantial hours on 10/21/2020 and
10/26/2020 to prepare the fee motion; (5) the Court similarly does not award 4
of the 6.25 hours billed by MR on 10/26/2020, totaling $2,780.00, or 2.0 of the 5.25 hours billed by
MR on 11/30/2020, totaling $1,390.00,
because the Court finds that 19.00 hours billed by MR between 10/21/2020 and
11/30/2020 on the fee motion is excessive and unsupported, especially in light
of the 6.5 hours billed on 03/16/2021 to update and finalize the fee motion;
(6) the .25 hours billed by MS on 02/02/2021, totaling $212.50, because the description is completely
redacted; and (7) the 0.1 hours billed by MS on 03/01/2022, totaling $85.00, because the
description is completely redacted.
The reductions total $21,147.50,which sum is deducted
from the $266,497.03 requested (before a multiplier.) 
As such, the Court reduces the requested lodestar by
$21,147.50, for a final lodestar of $245,349.53.
 
ii.             
Additional Hours Requested In Supplemental Declaration Filed 11/14/2024 
In the supplemental declaration of Michael Schwimer,
Petitioner requests that the Court award the following additional attorney’s
fees incurred since the Motion was filed, (Schwimer Supp. Decl. at ¶ 16):
·      
Michael
Schwimer (attorney) – 5.5hrs @ $850/hr = $4,675.00
·      
Christina
Arreola (paralegal) – 3.25hrs @ $150/hr = $485.50
The Court DENIES Petitioner’s request for additional
attorney’s fees. 
First, the Court does not find that Respondent has been
given sufficient notice of Petitioner’s request for additional fees. The
request was made by way of the supplemental declaration that was filed and
served on November 14, 2024, which is only six (6) court days before the
continued hearing date. Code of Civil Procedure section 1005, subdivision (b)
requires that “all moving and supporting papers shall be served and filed at
least 16 court days before the hearing,” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1005(b)), and the
Court finds that late filing of the supplemental declaration failed to give
Respondent sufficient notice and a proper opportunity to respond to the
request. 
Second, the Court finds that Petitioner fails to provide
a sufficient basis to determine whether these requested additional fees are
allowable and reasonably necessary. 
Mr. Schwimer attests that these fees were incurred in
“attending three hearings, preparing/filing/serving notices of
rulings, preparing/filing/serving proofs of service, preparing/filing/serving
supplemental papers such as the instant declaration, and effectuating service
as ordered by the Court.” (Schwimer Supp. Decl. at ¶ 16.) 
However, a review of the record will demonstrate that
much of the work expended was due to Petitioner’s failure to properly
effectuate service of the Petition on Respondent. (See, e.g., April 2, 2024,
July 15, 2024, and September 17, 2024 Minute Orders; Michael Schwimer Decl.
filed 07/10/2024.) If Petitioner properly reviewed the applicable statutory
provisions and case law concerning service of the Petition and proper proof of
service of the Petition, and provided sufficient evidence to support the hourly
rates requested in the Motion, (see October 23, 2024 Minute Order, p. 1), then
Petitioner would not have needed to incur additional fees to attend the
multiple hearings on the instant Motion, to serve notices of the rulings
whereby the Court explains the problems with the Petition and Motion, and to
cure such problems. The Court does not find that it is appropriate to require
Respondent to reimburse Petitioner for additional fees incurred to cure counsel
for Petitioner’s mistakes or oversights. 
Moreover, Petitioner fails to provide a sufficient
evidentiary basis to conclude that 5.5 hours expended by Mr. Schwimer and 3.25
hours expended by Ms. Arreola are reasonable. 
For these reasons, the Court DENIES Petitioner’s request
for additional attorney’s fees. 
c.    
Multiplier 
Petitioner requests a lodestar
multiplier of 2x. (Motion at pp. 10-12.) 
As explained by the California
Supreme Court in Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122:
 
…the lodestar is the
basic fee for comparable legal services in the community; it may be adjusted by
the court based on factors including… (1) the novelty and difficulty of the
questions involved, (2) the skill displayed in presenting them, (3) the extent
to which the nature of the litigation precluded other employment by the
attorneys, (4) the contingent nature of the fee award. The purpose of such
adjustment is to fix a fee at the fair market value for the particular action.
In effect, the court determines, retrospectively, whether the litigation
involved a contingent risk or required extraordinary legal skill justifying
augmentation of the unadorned lodestar in order to approximate the fair market
rate for such services. The experienced trial judge is the best judge of the
value of professional services rendered in his court, and while his judgment is
of course subject to review, it will not be disturbed unless the appellate
court is convinced that it is clearly wrong.
 
… [a] contingent fee
contract, since it involves a gamble on the result, may properly provide for a
larger compensation than would otherwise be reasonable. The purpose of a fee
enhancement, or so-called multiplier, for contingent risk is to bring the financial
incentives for attorneys enforcing important constitutional rights, such as
those protected under the anti-SLAPP provision, into line with incentives they
have to undertake claims for which they are paid on a fee-for-services basis.
(Id. at 1132 (internal
citations and quotations omitted).) 
With respect to enhancements for
contingency cases, the California Supreme Court in Ketchum further
explained that: 
The economic
rationale for fee enhancement in contingency cases has been explained as
follows: A contingent fee must be higher than a fee for the same legal services
paid as they are performed. The contingent fee compensates the lawyer not only
for the legal services he renders but for the loan of those services. The
implicit interest rate on such a loan is higher because the risk of default
(the loss of the case, which cancels the debt of the client to the lawyer) is
much higher than that of conventional loans. A lawyer who both bears the risk
of not being paid and provides legal services is not receiving the fair market
value of his work if he is paid only for the second of these functions. If he
is paid no more, competent counsel will be reluctant to accept fee award cases.
 
Such fee
enhancements are intended to compensate for the risk of loss generally in
contingency cases as a class. In cases involving enforcement of constitutional
rights, but little or no damages, such fee enhancements may make such cases
economically feasible to competent private attorneys.
[M]ost lawyers of this quality do seem to consider the prospects of
success and the fee recoverable before adding to their crowded calendars a case
in which payment is contingent.
(Id. at 1132-1133
(internal citations and quotations omitted); see id. at 1138
[multiplier/fee enhancement “is intended to approximate market-level
compensation for such services, which typically includes a premium for the risk
of nonpayment or delay in payment of attorney fees.”]
 
The California Supreme Court
further explained that: 
Of course, the trial
court is not required to include a fee enhancement to the basic lodestar figure
for contingent risk, exceptional skill, or other factors, although it retains
discretion to do so in the appropriate case; moreover, the party seeking a fee
enhancement bears the burden of proof. In each case, the trial court should
consider whether, and to what extent, the attorney and client have been able to
mitigate the risk of nonpayment, e.g., because the client has agreed to pay
some portion of the lodestar amount regardless of outcome. It should also
consider the degree to which the relevant market compensates for contingency
risk, extraordinary skill, or other factors…. We emphasize that when
determining the appropriate enhancement, a trial court should not consider
these factors to the extent they are already encompassed within the lodestar.
The factor of extraordinary skill, in particular, appears susceptible to improper
double counting; for the most part, the difficulty of a legal question and the quality
of representation are already encompassed in the lodestar. A more difficult
legal question typically requires more attorney hours, and a more skillful and
experienced attorney will command a higher hourly rate. Indeed, the reasonable
hourly rate [used to calculate the lodestar] is the product of a multiplicity
of factors ... the level of skill necessary, time limitations, the amount to be
obtained in the litigation, the attorney's reputation, and the undesirability
of the case. Thus, a trial court should award a multiplier for exceptional
representation only when the quality of representation far exceeds the quality
of representation that would have been provided by an attorney of comparable
skill and experience billing at the hourly rate used in the lodestar
calculation. Otherwise, the fee award will result in unfair double counting and
be unreasonable. Nor should a fee enhancement be imposed for the purpose of
punishing the losing party.
(Id. at 1138-1139
(internal citations and quotations omitted).) 
The Court does not find that a
multiplier is warranted under the circumstances. 
Although the Motion indicates
that there is a contingency fee agreement, (see Motion at pp. 10-11), none of
the evidence filed by Petitioner indicates that there is indeed a contingency
fee agreement. In any event, assuming there is a contingency fee agreement, the
Court finds that a multiplier is not appropriate under the circumstances. The
Settlement Agreement provides for the payment by Respondent to Petitioner of
reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs incurred on behalf of Petitioner through
the date of the execution of the agreement, (Settlement Agreement at § 3(b)), and there is no indication that
litigating the action involved any novel or difficult questions warranting a
multiplier, or that the litigation precluded other employment. The Court does
not find that the action involved enforcement of constitutional rights. Respondent
failed to appear in the instant action. The Court finds that counsel will be
properly and sufficiently compensated for their work without a fee enhancement. 
Thus, Petitioner’s request to award a multiplier
is DENIED. 
Accordingly, based on all the foregoing, the Court awards
$245,349.53 in attorney’s fees. 
d.     Costs 
The Court finds that Petitioner’s
evidence sufficiently supports Petitioner’s request for $13,658.50 in costs,
(Schwimer Decl. at ¶ 10, Ex. E at pp. 73-74), and the Court awards Petitioner
$13,658.50 in costs. 
In the supplemental declaration of Michael Schwimer,
Petitioner requests an additional $324.93 in costs incurred since the filing of
the instant Motion. (Schwimer Supp. Decl. at ¶ 16.) The Court DENIES this
request for the same reasons discussed above with respect to Petitioner’s
request for additional attorney’s fees. Moreover, Petitioner does not provide
any evidence as to what these costs are for, and the Court cannot determine if
they are recoverable. 
Thus, the Court only awards the $13,658.50 in costs originally
requested. 
In sum, the Court GRANTS the motion and awards Petitioner
attorney fees in the amount of $245,349,53, and costs of $13,658.50. 
Petitioner is to give notice.
