  Case Number:  21STCP01430    Hearing Date:   November 22, 2024    Dept:  19 SOLEIMANI &
ASSOCIATES V. HAIM MOROVATI 
TENTATIVE RULING 
After consideration of the briefing filed and oral
argument at the hearing, Petitioner Soleimani & Associates,
APLC’s Petition to Confirm Attorney-Client Fee Arbitration Award is GRANTED. 
Accordingly, after accounting
for payments received by Respondent and for the reasons discussed below, the
Court finds that Petitioner is entitled to entry of judgment in the total
amount of $29,927.03. 
However, Petitioner failed to
file a proposed judgment. Counsel for Petitioner is ordered to file a proposed
judgment by December 4, 2024. 
The Court sets a
Non-Appearance Case Review Re: Proposed Judgment ON December 6, 2024, at 8:30
a.m., in Department 19 of the Stanley Mosk Courthouse. 
Respondent has not appeared
and therefore no notice is required under the circumstances. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 1010.) 
 
STATEMENT OF THE CASE 
In the instant Petition to Confirm Attorney-Client Fee
Arbitration Award (the “Petition”), Petitioner Soleimani &
Associates, APLC (“Petitioner”) seeks to confirm the binding $100,000.00
arbitration award dated June
29, 2020 (the “Arbitration Award”) issued in Los Angeles County Bar Association
Attorney Client Mediation & Arbitration Services Case No. M-072-19-JB in
favor of Petitioner and against Respondent Haim Morovati (“Respondent”). 
GROUNDS FOR PETITION 
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1285 et seq.,
Petitioner requests that the Court confirm the Arbitration Award and enter
judgment accordingly.
  
DISCUSSION 
I.              
Procedural Requirements
 
The Mandatory Fee Arbitration Act
(the “MFAA”), codified at Business and Professions Code section 6200 et seq.,
“permits a party to petition to confirm an arbitration award in the same manner
that arbitration awards may be confirmed under section 1285 et seq.” (Perez
v. Grajales (2008) 169 Cal.App.4th 580, 585, 588.) 
“Any party to an arbitration in
which an award has been made may petition the court to confirm, correct or
vacate the award…. The petition shall name as respondents all parties to the
arbitration and may name as respondents any other persons bound by the
arbitration award.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1285.) A party may seek to confirm the
arbitration award at least ten days, but no more than four years, after service
of the award. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1288, 1288.4.) A court has authority to
entertain any petition concerning arbitration so long as a minimum of 10 days of
notice was provided. (Code Civ. Proc. § 1290.2.) 
A petition made pursuant to Code
of Civil Procedure section 1285 et seq. must: (a) “[s]et forth the substance of
or have attached a copy of the agreement to arbitrate unless the petitioner
denies the existence of such an agreement”; (b) set forth the names of the
arbitrator or arbitrators; and (c) “[s]et forth or have attached a copy of the
award and the written opinion of the arbitrators, if any.” (Code Civ. Proc.,
1285.4.) 
“A petition to confirm an award
shall be served and filed not later than four years after the date of service
of a signed copy of the award on the petitioner.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1288.) 
Code of Civil Procedure section
1290.6 provides that: 
A response
shall be served and filed within 10 days after service of the petition except
that if the petition is served in the manner provided in paragraph (2) of
subdivision (b) of Section 1290.4, the response shall be served and filed
within 30 days after service of the petition. The time provided in this section
for serving and filing a response may be extended by an agreement in writing
between the parties to the court proceeding or, for good cause, by order of the
court.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1290.6.) 
Here, the Petition was brought
within four (4) years after the date of service of a signed copy of the Arbitration
Award on Petitioner and therefore the Petition is timely. The Petition , names
as respondent the only other party to the arbitration, i.e., Respondent, and
sets forth the information required by Code of Civil Procedure section 1285.4
et seq. 
No response to the Petition was
filed. Per the Proof of Personal Service filed on November 12, 2024, the Court
is satisfied that Respondent was given proper notice of the continued hearing
on the Petition. 
II.           
Analysis
 A.    Entry
of Judgment 
Until an arbitration award is
confirmed by court judgment, it has only the effect of a contract between the
parties. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1287.6.) But “[i]f an award is confirmed, judgment
shall be entered in conformity therewith.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1287.4.) If a
petition or response requesting confirmation is duly filed and served, the
court must confirm the award as made, unless it corrects or vacates the award
or dismisses the proceeding. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1286; see Pacific Law
Group: U.S.A. v. Gibson (1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 577, 580; Horn v. Gurewitz
(1968) 261 Cal.App.2d 255, 258-259.) Statutes set forth specific grounds upon
which an arbitrator’s award may be vacated. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 1286.2.)
Except on these grounds, arbitration awards are immune from judicial review in
proceedings to challenge or enforce the award. (Moncharsh v. Heily &
Blase (1992) 3 Cal.4th 1, 12–13.) Moreover, a court may not correct an
award unless, among other requirements, a petition or response requesting that
the award either be corrected or vacated is duly served and filed. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1286.8.) 
Thus, courts will not review the
sufficiency of the evidence to support the award. (Morris v. Zuckerman (1968)
69 Cal.2d 686, 691.) Nor will courts pass upon the validity of the arbitrator’s
reasoning. (Id.) The court simply may not substitute its judgment for
that of the arbitrator. (Id.) Further, errors of fact or law
committed by the arbitrator, no matter how egregious, are not grounds for
challenging the arbitrator’s award under California law. (Moncharsh, supra,
3 Cal.4th at p. 11.) 
Business and Professions Code
section 6204 provides, in relevant part, that: 
(a)
The parties may agree in writing to be bound by the award of arbitrators
appointed pursuant to this article at any time after the dispute over fees,
costs, or both, has arisen. In the absence of such an agreement, either party
shall be entitled to a trial after arbitration if sought within 30 days…. 
(b)
If there is an action pending, the trial after arbitration shall be initiated
by filing a rejection of arbitration award and request for trial after
arbitration in that action within 30 days after service of notice of the award.
[….]
(Bus. & Prof. Code, § 6204(a)-(b).)
 
Business and Professions Code
section 6203, subdivision (b) provides, in relevant part, that: 
Even
if the parties to the arbitration have not agreed in writing to be bound, the
arbitration award shall become binding upon the passage of 30 days after
service of notice of the award, unless a party has, within the 30 days, sought
a trial after arbitration pursuant to Section 6204.
(Bus. & Prof. Code, § 6204(b).) 
Here, the Petition and Arbitration
Award indicate that the Arbitration Award was mailed to Respondent on July 15,
2020. (Petition, § 7; id. at § 6, Attachment 6(c) at p. 9; see Shahram
Soleimani Decl., ¶ 3, Ex. A.) There is no indication that Respondent sought a
trial within thirty (30) days after such service of notice of the Arbitration
Award. No response requesting the Court to dismiss the Petition or to confirm,
correct or vacate the Arbitration Award has been filed. (See Code Civ. Proc.,
§§ 1285.2, 1285.6, 1285.8, 1286.2, 1286.4-1287.) 
Thus, the Court finds that
Petitioner is entitled to entry of judgment in conformity with the Arbitration
Award. 
B.    Calculations 
The Arbitration Award awarded
Petitioner “$100,000.00 plus interest in the amount of the prevailing legal
rate per annum from the 30th day after the date of service of this award.”
(Petition at Attachment 6(c), p. 6.) 
Petitioner provides evidence that
he did not receive any payment from Respondent until October 15, 2022, when
Respondent paid $48,000.00, and that after additional payments of $12,000.00 on
March 13, 2023 and $10,000.00 payments on May 5, 2023, May 24, 2023, September
6, 2023, and October 18, 2023, Respondent has paid the $100,000.00 award in
full. (Soleimani Decl. at ¶¶ 5-6.) 
Thus, except for “reasonable fees
and costs incurred in obtaining confirmation,” (Bus. & Prof. Code, §
6203(b)), which the Court discusses below, the Court finds that Petitioner is
entitled to judgment only for the prejudgment interest that accrued due to
Respondent’s failure to pay the Arbitration Award within thirty (30) days after
the June 15, 2020 service. 
1.     Interest
 The thirtieth (30th) day after
July 15, 2020 is August 14, 2020. Thus, per the terms of the Arbitration Award,
interest began accruing at a rate of ten percent (10%) per annum, (Civ. Code, §
3289(b)), or $27.40 per diem, beginning August 14, 2020, not July 29, 2020 as
stated in the declaration of Shahram Soleimani. (Soleimani Decl. at ¶ 5.) 
Thus, the Court awards interest in
the reduced amount of $25,232.27 to account for the fact that interest did not
begin to accrue until August 14, 2020. 
2.     Fees
and Costs 
The Court also finds that
Respondent is also entitled to recover reasonable fees and costs incurred in
obtaining confirmation of the Arbitration Award. (Bus. & Prof. Code, §
6203(b).) 
i.              
Attorney’s Fees 
Respondent requests $5,560.00 in
attorney’s fees which Respondent contends reflects eight (8) hours of work
reasonably expended at a rate of $695.00 per hour. 
As explained by the Court of Appeal in Christian
Research Institute v. Alnor (2008) 165 Cal.App.4th 1315: 
A trial court assessing attorney fees
begins with a touchstone or lodestar figure, based on the careful compilation
of the time spent and reasonable hourly compensation of each attorney ...
involved in the presentation of the case. The court tabulates the attorney fee
touchstone, or lodestar, by multiplying the number of hours reasonably expended
by the reasonable hourly rate prevailing in the community for similar work.
[T]he lodestar figure may be increased or decreased depending on a variety of
factors, including the contingent nature of the fee award. …absent
circumstances rendering the award unjust, an attorney fee award should
ordinarily include compensation for all the hours reasonably spent, including
those relating solely to the fee. … ‘padding’ in the form of inefficient or
duplicative efforts is not subject to compensation. 
(Id. at 1321 (internal citations and quotations
omitted). 
A party requesting a fee award “‘is not necessarily
entitled to compensation for the value of attorney services according to [his]
own notion or to the full extent claimed by [him].’” (Levy v. Toyota
Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc. (1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 807, 816 (quoting Salton
Bay Marina, Inc. v. Imperial Irrigation Dist. (1985) 172 Cal.App.3d
914, 950) (internal citation omitted).) 
The party seeking attorney fees and costs “bear[s] the
burden of establishing entitlement to an award and documenting the appropriate
hours expended and hourly rates” to show that the fees incurred were allowable
and reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation. (Christian Research
Institute, supra, 165 Cal.App.4th at 1320 (internal citations and
quotations omitted); see Levy, supra, 4 Cal.App.4th at 816.)  “To that end, the court may require [a]
defendant[ ] to produce records sufficient to provide a proper basis for
determining how much time was spent on particular claims.” (Ibid.) “The
court also may properly reduce compensation on account of any failure to
maintain appropriate time records.” (Id. (internal citation omitted)
(quoting ComputerXpress, Inc. v. Jackson (2001) 93 Cal.App.4th 993, 1020).)
“The evidence should allow the court to consider whether the case was
overstaffed, how much time the attorneys spent on particular claims, and
whether the hours were reasonably expended.” (Id. (citing ComputerXpress,
Inc., supra, 93 Cal.App.4th at 1020).) 
A trial court has broad discretion to award attorney fees
in an amount that is less than the lodestar amount and, to discourage claimants
from making an unreasonable demand, may deny altogether a fee request that
appears unreasonably inflated. (Id. at 1321-1322; see Serrano v.
Unruh (1982) 32 Cal.3d 621, 635.) 
“The basis for the trial court's calculation must be the
actual hours counsel has devoted to the case, less those that result from
inefficient or duplicative use of time.” (Horsford v. Board Of Trustees Of
California State University (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 359, 395.) “The law is
clear, however, that an award of attorney fees may be based on counsel's
declarations, without production of detailed time records.” (Raining Data
Corp. v. Barrenechea (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 1363, 1375.) “[T]he verified
time statements of the attorneys, as officers of the court, are entitled to
credence in the absence of a clear indication the records are erroneous.” (Horsford,
supra at 396; City of Colton v. Singletary
(2012) 206 Cal.App.4th 751, 785 (same).)
“‘In
challenging attorney fees as excessive because too many hours of work are
claimed, it is the burden of the challenging party to point to the specific
items challenged, with a sufficient argument and citations to the evidence.
General arguments that fees claimed are excessive, duplicative, or unrelated do
not suffice. Failure to raise specific challenges in the trial court forfeits
the claim on appeal.’” (Lunada Biomedical v. Nunez (2014) 230
Cal.App.4th 459, 488 (quoting Premier Medical Management Systems, Inc. v.
California Ins. Guarantee Assn. (2008) 163 Cal.App.4th 550, 564).) 
“[T]he trial court is in the best
position to value the services rendered by the attorneys in his or her
courtroom, and this includes the determination of the hourly rate that will be
used in the lodestar calculus.” (569 East County Boulevard LLC v.
Backcountry Against the Dump, Inc. (2016) 6 Cal.App.5th 426, 436-437
(internal citation omitted); see, e.g., Wilkerson v. Sullivan (2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 443, 448 [“The reasonableness of
attorney fees is within the discretion of the trial court, to be determined from
a consideration of such factors as the nature of the litigation, the complexity
of the issues, the experience and expertise of counsel and the amount of time
involved. The court may also consider whether the amount requested is based
upon unnecessary or duplicative work.”]; Christian Research
Institute, supra, 165 Cal.App.4th at 1321-1322 [ascertaining the amount of
attorney’s fees to be awarded is left to the sound discretion of the trial
court and the trial court need not simply award the sum requested].) 
In setting the hourly rate
for an attorney fees award, courts are entitled to consider the rate of “fees
customarily charged by that attorney and others in the community for similar
work.” (Bihun v. AT&T Information Systems, Inc. (1993) 13 Cal. App.
4th 976, 997, overruled on other grounds by Lakin v. Watkins Associated
Indus. (1993) 6 Cal. 4th 644, 664; see also Heritage Pacific Financial,
LLC v. Monroy (2013) 215 Cal.App.4th 972, 1009 [“[R]ate determinations in
other cases, particularly those setting a rate for the plaintiffs' attorney,
are satisfactory evidence of the prevailing market rate.”].) “In making
its calculation, the court may rely on its own knowledge and familiarity with
the legal market, as well as the experience, skill, and reputation of the
attorney requesting fees, the difficulty or complexity of the litigation to
which that skill was applied, and affidavits from other attorneys regarding
prevailing fees in the community and rate determinations in other cases.” (569
East County Boulevard LLC, supra, 6 Cal.App.5th at 437 (internal citations
omitted).) 
Here, after consideration of the
evidence submitted, the Court finds the $5,560.00 requested by Petitioner to be
excessive. The instant action is a summary proceeding, (Code Civ. Proc., §
1290.2), is not difficult or complex, does not involve novel issues, and does
not require special skill. 
Given the experience of Mr.
Soleimani and the evidence that he is a solo practitioner, (Soleimani Decl. at
¶¶ 1, 6), and relying on its own knowledge and familiarity with the legal
market, the Court awards the requested $695.00 hourly rate. 
However, the instant action was commenced by
way of filling out and filing Judicial Council form ADR-103, which is a simple,
three (3) page form. The Court does not find that more than two (2) hours could
be reasonably expended in filling out the form and attaching the Arbitration
Award. The Court also finds that no more than four (4) hours could be
reasonably expended in drafting and filing the Notice of Motion, the memorandum
of point and authorities, which is less than two (2) pages, and the declaration
of Shahram Soleimani. 
Thus, the Court awards six (6)
hours at a rate of $695.00, for a total attorney fee award of $4,170.00. 
ii.             
Costs 
Petitioner also requests $524.76
in costs. (Soleimani Decl. at ¶ 7.) The Court finds that Petitioner
sufficiently establishes entitlement to these costs, (id. at Ex. B), and
the Court awards Petitioner $524.76 in costs. 
Accordingly, for all the foregoing
reasons, the Court GRANTS the Petition and confirms the Arbitration Award for a
total judgment of $29,927.03.
