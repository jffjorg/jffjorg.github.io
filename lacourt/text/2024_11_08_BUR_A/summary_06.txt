And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel the deposition of Vilma M. Baquir, Jr. The motion was brought by the Plaintiffs, Sosy and Harout Sandaljian, against the Defendants, Vilma M. Baquir and Emiliano D. Baquir, Jr. The Plaintiffs allege that the Defendants capped a drainpipe on their property, causing water to pool under their home, and impeded access to the drain pipe.

The court notes that the Defendants failed to oppose the motion, which is an indication that the motion has merit. The court finds that the Plaintiffs have demonstrated that Vilma M. Baquir, Jr. failed to proceed with the duly noticed deposition despite multiple attempts to meet and confer with the Plaintiffs' counsel regarding the nonappearance.

The court grants the Plaintiffs' motion to compel the deposition of Vilma M. Baquir, Jr. and orders that the deposition shall take place within the next 30 days. The court also grants the motion for sanctions against Joseph Kang, the former counsel for the Defendants, in the amount of $933.00. The court notes that this is the second time it has imposed sanctions against Joseph Kang and that the court is uncertain whether the previous sanctions were paid.
