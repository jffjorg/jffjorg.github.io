And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Gary Carrington's motion to set aside/vacate the default judgment entered in favor of Lendora Capital, LLC. The motion was filed on January 5, 2024, which is more than six months after the entry of the default judgment on November 14, 2022. The judge found that the motion was untimely and did not meet the requirements of California Code of Civil Procedure § 473(b). The judge also noted that the motion did not contain a proposed responsive pleading as required by the statute. The judge did not consider the merits of the motion because it was denied as untimely. The judge suggested that relief from default may be obtainable through other statutes, but the motion did not provide enough information for the court to determine that. The motion is denied without prejudice, which means that Gary Carrington can refile the motion if he meets the requirements of the statute.
