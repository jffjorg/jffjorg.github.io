```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to set aside the default judgment. The motion was filed by the defendant, Ka San, who claims that he was never served with the summons and complaint and therefore had no notice of the lawsuit. The defendant also claims that he did not receive any paperwork related to the litigation and only became aware of the lawsuit when he noticed a debit transaction on his account associated with the plaintiff's levy.

The judge has found that the defendant has demonstrated that he was never served with the summons and complaint and that he has a meritorious case. The judge has also found that the defendant has demonstrated a satisfactory excuse for not defending the original action and has shown diligence in seeking to vacate the judgment.

The judge has granted the motion to set aside the default judgment and has ordered the defendant to file a responsive pleading within 10 days. The judge has also set a case management conference for February 25, 2025, and has ordered the defendant to give notice.
