ALLEGATIONS: 
 
On June 2,
2016, the Court entered Default Judgment as against Ka San (Defendant) and Golden Supermarket, Inc in favor of
International Collection Corp. (Plaintiff). The initial judgment was for a
total of $51,470.16, although Plaintiff’s most recent statement of its costs
after judgment shows interest has accumulated in the amount of $ 39,131.39. 
 
Before the Court is
motion by Defendant to vacate the judgment against him on various grounds. Defendant
maintains that he was never served and never received actual notice of this
action until recently. Defendant asks the Court to vacate the judgment and
allow him to file a responsive pleading. 
 
The Court notes that
no opposition was received.   A failure
to oppose a motion may be deemed a consent to the granting of the motion.  Failure to file an opposition to the motion
indicates the other parties' acquiescence that the motion is meritorious. CRC

ANALYSIS: 
 
I.                   
LEGAL STANDARD 
 
A defendant against whom a
default judgment has been entered has three basis for relief: first, the party
can obtain relief under C.C.P. §473 and 473.5; second, the party can show that
extrinsic fraud or mistake exists; and third, the party can show that the
default judgment was facially void.  (Trackman
v. Kenney (2010) 187 Cal.App.4th 175, 181.)
 
C.C.P. § 473(b) 
 
Under C.C.P. § 473(b), an application for
relief must be made no more than six months after entry of the judgment,
dismissal, order, or other proceeding from which relief is sought and must be
accompanied by an affidavit of fault attesting to the mistake, inadvertence,
surprise or neglect of the moving party or its attorney. (C.C.P. § 473(b); English
v. IKON Business Solutions (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 130, 143.)
 
C.C.P. § 473.5
 
CCP § 473.5(a) provides that a party who has
not received timely actual notice may file a notice of motion to set aside the
default judgment: “When service of a summons has not resulted in actual notice
to a party in time to defend the action and a default or default judgment has
been entered against him or her in the action, he or she may serve and file a
notice of motion to set aside the default or default judgment and for leave to
defend the action.” 
 
A motion seeking relief under CCP § 473.5
must be served and filed within a reasonable time but in no event later than
two years after the entry of default judgment or 180 days after service of
written notice that default or default judgment has been entered, whichever is
earlier. (C.C.P. § 473.5(c).) 
 
C.C.P. § 473(d) 
 
Where a party moves under C.C.P. 473(d) to
set aside a judgment that, though valid on its face, is void for lack of proper
service, the courts have adopted by analogy the statutory period for relief
from a default judgment provided by C.C.P. § 473.5, that is, 2 years after
entry of default. (Rogers v. Silverman (1989) 216 Cal. App. 3d 1114,
1120-1124; Schenkel v. Resnik (1994) 27 Cal. App. 4th Supp. 1, 3-4; Gibble
v. Car-Lene Research, Inc. (1998) 67 Cal. App. 4th 295, 301, fn. 3; Trackman
v. Kenney (2010) 187 Cal. App. 4th 175, 180.) 
 
Extrinsic Fraud 
 
A trial court has an inherent equity power
under which, apart from statutory authority, it may grant relief from a default
judgment obtained through extrinsic fraud or mistake. (In re Marriage of
Coffin (1976) 63 Cal.App.3d 139, 148-149 [internal quotations and citations
omitted].) 
 
“To set aside a judgment based upon extrinsic
mistake one must satisfy three elements. First, the defaulted party must
demonstrate that it has a meritorious case. Second, the party seeking to set
aside the default must articulate a satisfactory excuse for not presenting a
defense to the original action. Last, the moving party must demonstrate
diligence in seeking to set aside the default once ... discovered.” (Rappleyea
v. Campbell (1994) 8 Cal.4th 975, 982 [internal quotes and citations
omitted].)
 
II.                
MERITS 
 
The Court begins by noting
that Defendant’s request for relief pursuant to C.C.P. § 473(b) is untimely.
Motions brought pursuant to this section must be brought within six months of
the entry of judgment. Here, judgment was entered on June 2, 2016. Defendant
therefore cannot seek relief under either provision of C.C.P. § 473(b). The
same can be said of Defendant’s request for relief under C.C.P. §§ 473.5 and
473(d). These statutes require relief be sought within two years of entry of
default. 
 
Given the foregoing,
Defendant’s sole remaining avenue for relief is to demonstrate that the
judgment was obtained through extrinsic fraud. As will be explained below, the
Court finds Defendant has adequately demonstrated this to be the case. 
 
To begin, the Court finds Defendant has
sufficiently demonstrated the existence of a meritorious case as they have
included a proposed Answer as Exhibit D to this motion. 
 
The Court also finds Defendant has
demonstrated a satisfactory excuse for not defending the original action.
Findings of extrinsic fraud in the context of relief from default do not mirror
the stringent requirements of proving common law fraud. Extrinsic fraud is a
broad concept that “tend[s] to encompass almost any set of extrinsic
circumstances which deprive a party of a fair adversary hearing.” (Marriage
of Park (1980) 27 Cal.3d 337, 342; County of San Diego v. Gorham
(2010) 186 Cal.App.4th 1215, 1229 [default judgment obtained by false proof of
service constitutes extrinsic fraud].) 
 
Here, the proofs of service reflect that the
summons and complaint were left with Joan Huang (Huang) on February 6, 2016 at
7:39 a.m. (Exh. A.) In his declaration Defendant explains that he and his wife
Huang did live at the address of service, 864 Sierra Madre Blvd. San Marino, CA
91108, at the time of purported service. (San Decl. ¶ 3.) However, Defendant
states that he was out of the country at the time that service occurred, as he
frequently travels to China for business. (San Decl. ¶ 4.) Defendant maintains
that he never received any paperwork related to this litigation, either in
person or by mail. (San Decl. ¶¶ 7-8.) Huang, the person purportedly
served, also denies having ever received service. Huang states that she never
received any documents related to this litigation either in person or through
mail. (Huang Decl. ¶¶ 3-4.) 
 
Here, the Court finds that Defendant has
demonstrated fact sufficient to establish that Huang never received notice of
the pending litigation. Defendant has provided sufficient testimony to rebut
the presumption of effective service arising from the process server’s
affidavit. (See American Express
Centurion Bank v. Zara (2011) 199¿Cal.App.4th 383, 390 [internal citation
omitted]; Evid. Code § 647.) The Court notes that because it is the policy of
the law to favor a hearing on the merits, very slight evidence is required to
justify a trial court’s order setting aside a default. (Ramos v. Homeward
Residential, Inc. (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 1434, 1444.)
 
Lastly, the Court finds
that Defendant has sufficiently demonstrated diligence in seeking to vacate the
judgment. Both Defendant and Huang testify that they had no knowledge of this
suit until May 2024, when they noticed a debit transaction on their accounts
associated with Plaintiff’s levy. (San Decl. ¶ 10, Huang Decl. ¶ 7.)
Defendant thereafter retained counsel and filed this motion on September 9,
2024. The Court notes that Defendant provides no explanation for the several
month gap between becoming aware of the levy and filing this motion.
Regardless, the Court is sensitive to the fact that obtaining legal
representation and filing such a motion does take time. While Defendant’s
response may not have been as prompt as it could have, the Court does not find
this warrants denial of relief. 
 
The Court also notes that
it received no opposition.  A failure to
oppose a motion may be deemed a consent to the granting of the motion.  Failure to file an opposition to the motion
indicates the other parties' acquiescence that the motion is meritorious. CRC
Rule 8.54(c).   Given the lack of
opposition and what was discussed above the Court finds that the moving party
has met its burden to vacate the judgment which was not opposed.
 
Accordingly, the Motion to
Vacate Default Judgment/Set Aside Default is GRANTED.
