And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendants' motion to compel the deposition of Perry Moore, the plaintiff. The defendants had sought to resume the deposition to ask Perry Moore about the video of the incident and his medical treatment. The judge found that the answers sought are subject to discovery and that the defendants' motion was properly brought under California Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.480. The judge also ordered the parties to meet and confer on a mutually acceptable date for the deposition to resume within the next 30 days.

The judge declined to award sanctions against either party, finding that Perry Moore's opposition to the motion was not without substantial justification due to the ambiguity surrounding the production of the video. The judge also noted that California law does not require the disclosure of later-obtained information unless a party requests it via supplemental discovery.
