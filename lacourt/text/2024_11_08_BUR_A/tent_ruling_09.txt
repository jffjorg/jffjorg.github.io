ALLEGATIONS: 
 
Britecap Financial,
LLC (Plaintiff) brings this action against AGCO Construction, LLC (AGCO) &
Donald J. Aguillard (Aguillard) (collectively Defendants). Plaintiff alleges
that Defendants are indebted to them in the amount of $52,325.97 as Defendants
failed to make payments pursuant to a May 9, 2023 Loan Agreement. Plaintiff
alleges this Loan Agreement was personally guaranteed by Aguillard, who is
listed as on the Agreement as the owner of ACGO. 
 
On April 15, 2024
Aguillard filed a General Denial in pro per. On October 25, 2024,
default was entered against AGCO.
 
Before the Court is
Plaintiff’s Motion to Deem Matters in their Request for Admissions (RFA)
admitted. Plaintiff states this motion has resulted from Augillard’s failure to
respond to their RFA demands. Aguillard has not opposed this motion. The Court
notes that, pursuant to C.R.C. Rule 8.54(c), a
failure to oppose a motion may be deemed consent to its being granted.  
  
ANALYSIS: 
 
I.                   
LEGAL
STANDARD 
 
If a party fails to respond
to requests for admission in a timely manner, the requesting party may move for
an order that the matters be deemed admitted. (C.C.P. § 2033.280(b).) The requesting party’s motion must be
granted by the court unless the party to whom the requests for admission have
been directed has served a proposed response to the requests for admission that
is in substantial compliance with C.C.P. § 2033.220 prior to the hearing. 
(C.C.P. § 2033.280(c).)  By failing
to timely respond, the party to whom the requests are directed waives any
objection to the requests, including one based on privilege or work
product.  (C.C.P. §
2033.280(a).) 
 
II.                
MERITS 
 
Request to Deem RFA Matters
Admitted  
 
On May 8,
2024, Plaintiff served their first set of discovery demands on Aguillard, which
included RFA Set One and Form Interrogatories Set One. (Blanda Decl. ¶ 2.)
In reviewing Plaintiff’s submissions, the Court notes that Plaintiff does not
attach the Proof of Service for these discovery demands. Plaintiff’s Exhibit A,
which appears to be a copy of the discovery demands, does not contain a Proof
of Service. Nor was a Proof of Service independently filed. Further, the
declaration of Plaintiff’s counsel does not describe the method of service.
 
Given
Plaintiff has filed Proofs of Service for the continuance of Case Management
Conferences and for the instant motion, the Court presumes this was an
inadvertent omission. As such, the Court intends to continue this motion a
short time to allow Plaintiff the opportunity to file the Proof of Service. Should
Plaintiff file this Proof of Service, the Court would be inclined to grant
their unopposed motion. 
 
Sanctions

 
The Court
elects to not assess sanctions against Aguillar as Plaintiff has not requested
them in connection with this motion.

entered into the court’s records.
