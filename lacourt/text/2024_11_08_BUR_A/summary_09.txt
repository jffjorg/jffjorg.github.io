And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on November 8, 2024, regarding a motion to deem matters in a Request for Admissions (RFA) admitted. The motion was brought by Britecap Financial, LLC (Plaintiff) against AGCO Construction, LLC & Donald J. Aguillard (Defendants) due to the Defendants' failure to respond to the RFA demands. The Court notes that the Plaintiff failed to provide proof of service for the discovery demands, but presumes this was an inadvertent omission. The Court intends to continue the motion to allow the Plaintiff to file the proof of service. If the proof of service is filed, the Court would be inclined to grant the unopposed motion. The Court also elects not to assess sanctions against Aguillard. The motion is continued to November 22, 2024, at 9:00 a.m., with the Plaintiff to provide notice.
