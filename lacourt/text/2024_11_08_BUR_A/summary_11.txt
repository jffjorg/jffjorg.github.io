And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to correct a clerical error in a judgment held by Douglas Villalpando (Judgment Creditor) against Ramsey S. Mora (Judgment Debtor). The error occurred when Judgment Creditor's previous attorney filed a Renewal of Judgment on December 10, 2023, incorrectly designating the judgment as being related to a personal debt. Judgment Creditor argues that this error is significant because judgments related to personal debt are subject to a 5% annual interest rate, while judgments not related to personal debt are subject to a 10% annual interest rate.

The judge finds Judgment Creditor's arguments persuasive and grants the motion to correct the clerical error. The judge rules that the judgment is not for a personal debt because it includes a cause of action for fraud, which is not related to personal debt. The judge orders Judgment Creditor to file a proposed order within the next 15 calendar days.
