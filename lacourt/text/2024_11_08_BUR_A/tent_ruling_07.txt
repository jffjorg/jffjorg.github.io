ALLEGATIONS/HISTORY: 
 
On January 5, 2024,
Interinsurance Exchange of the Automobile Club (Petitioner) successfully
petitioned this Court to obtain a Superior Court Case Number. This petition was
submitted in connection with an uninsured motorist arbitration with
Petitioner’s insured Matliouba Katsnelson
and Irina Zerev (Respondents). Petitioner obtained a case number so they could
request the Court’s assistance is adjudicating a number of discovery disputes. 
 
Before the Court is a
motion for terminating sanctions brought by Petitioner. Petitioner argues that
terminating sanctions should issue as the result of Respondents’ repeated
noncompliance with the Court’s order compelling discovery. Respondents have not
opposed the motion. The Court notes that, pursuant to
C.R.C. Rule 8.54(c), a failure to oppose a motion may be deemed consent to its
being granted.  
 
ANALYSIS: 
 
Where a party fails
to obey an order compelling answers to discovery, “the court may make those
orders that are just, including the imposition of an issue sanction, an
evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction.” (C.C.P. §§ 2030.290(c),
2023.010(c); R.S. Creative, Inc. v. Creative Cotton, Ltd. (1999) 75 Cal.
App. 4th 486, 495.) Terminating sanctions are appropriate when a party persists
in disobeying the court’s orders. (Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) 84
Cal.App.3d 771, 795-796.) 
 
A terminating
sanction is a “drastic measure which should be employed with caution.” (Deyo
supra, 84 Cal. App. 3d at 793.) “A decision to order terminating sanctions
should not be made lightly. But where a violation is willful, preceded by a
history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not
produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial court is justified in
imposing the ultimate sanction.” (Mileikowsky v. Tenet Healthsystem
(2005) 128 Cal. App. 4th 262, 279-280.) 
 
While the court has
discretion to impose terminating sanctions, these sanctions “should be
appropriate to the dereliction and should not exceed that which is required to
protect the interests of the party entitled to but denied discovery.” (Deyo
supra, at 793.) “[A] court is empowered to apply the ultimate sanction
against a litigant who persists in the outright refusal to comply with his
discovery obligations.” (Id.) 
 
LEGAL STANDARD: 
 
The Court begins by
noting that this motion occurs in the context of an arbitration matter and not
a filed lawsuit. In making this motion, Petitioner asks that the Court award
terminating sanctions dismissing the arbitration matter with prejudice pursuant
to C.C.P. §2023.030(d)(3). 
 
The Insurance Code
adopts the Civil Discovery Act in its entirety and “grants the superior court
the exclusive jurisdiction to hear discovery matters arising under uninsured
motorist arbitrations,” including motions for terminating sanctions. (Miranda
v. 21st Century Ins. Co. (2008) 117 Cal.App.4th 913, 926 [citing Insurance
Code section 11580.2, subd. (f).) Where a party fails to obey an order
compelling answers to discovery, “the court may make those orders that are
just, including the imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a
terminating sanction." (C.C.P. §§ 2030.290 (c), 2023.010 (c); R.S.
Creative, Inc. v. Creative Cotton, Ltd. (1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 486, 495.)
 
On March 15,
2024, the Court granted Petitioner’s motions to compel Respondents’ discovery
responses. This included Petitioner’s Form Interrogatories and Request for the Production
of Documents (RFP). These motions were unopposed by Respondents. Respondents
were to serve their discovery responses within 30 days of the entry of the
order. 
 
Petitioner represents
to the Court that Respondents have not complied with this order. (Trafton Decl.
¶ 4.) Petitioner states that despite sending notice of the Court’s order
to Respondent, they have still yet to receive the discovery responses. (Trafton
Decl. ¶ 5, Exh. 1.) 
 
When deciding whether
to impose terminating sanctions, courts generally weigh three factors: (1)
whether the party subject to the sanction acted willfully, (2) the detriment to
the party seeking discovery, and (3) the number of formal and informal unsuccessful
attempts to obtain discovery. (Creed-21 v. City of Wildomar (2017) 18
Cal.App.5th 690, 702; Lang v. Hochman (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 1225, 1246.)
Further, willful disobedience of a court order is a prerequisite to the imposition
of nonmonetary sanctions. (New Albertsons, Inc. v. Superior Court (2008)
168 Cal.App.4th 1403.)
 
Here, the Court finds
Petitioner has demonstrated the required willful behavior to warrant
terminating sanctions. “Lack of diligence may be deemed willful in the sense
that the party understood his obligation, had the ability to comply, and failed
to comply.” (Deyo supra, at 787.) Despite the fact that Respondents have
been in receipt of these discovery demands since July 2023, Petitioner remains
without responses. Not only have these responses been outstanding for more than
a year, but they have also been the subject of an order from this Court. The
Court ordered these responses served several months ago and Respondents have
demonstrated no effort to comply. 
 
Further, the evidence
before the Court indicates that a lesser sanction would be ineffective in
producing Respondents’ responses. Respondent failed to oppose Petitioner’s
motions to compel and the instant motion for terminating sanctions. Despite the
fact that Respondents demanded arbitration in July 2023, no arbitrator has been
selected. (Trafton Decl. ¶ 3.) Respondents did not respond to any of Petitioner’s
informal meet and confer efforts regarding the discovery and have never filed
any response under this case number. (Trafton Decl. ¶ 4.) In short, Respondents
have “show[n] no interest in taking part in the case or in following orders of
the court.” (Del Junco v. Hufnagel (2007) 150 Cal.App.4th 789, 799-800.)

 
Accordingly, the
motion for terminating sanctions is GRANTED and Respondents’ uninsured motorist
arbitration proceeding is dismissed with prejudice pursuant to C.C.P. §2023.030(d)(3).
