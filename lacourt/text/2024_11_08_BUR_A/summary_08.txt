**Summary**

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the plaintiff's motion to enforce a settlement agreement. The plaintiff alleged that Kia Motors America, Inc. failed to comply with a settlement agreement reached in writing by their counsel. The judge found that the email exchange between the parties did not constitute a signed agreement under California Code of Civil Procedure Section 664.6, as there was no evidence that Kia's counsel intended to enter into a binding agreement.

**Key Points**

* The plaintiff brought a motion to enforce a settlement agreement reached in writing by their counsel and Kia Motors America, Inc.'s counsel.
