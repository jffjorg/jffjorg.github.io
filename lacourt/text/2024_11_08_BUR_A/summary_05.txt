Here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Court has reviewed the demurrers of the defendants and has determined that they are sustained without leave to amend. The Court finds that the plaintiffs' claims arise from or relate to the administration of Remdesivir and Dexamethasone, which are covered countermeasures under the Federal Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act (PREP Act). The PREP Act provides immunity from liability for claims of loss caused, arising out of, relating to, or resulting from administration or use of countermeasures to disease, threats, and conditions. The Court concludes that the plaintiffs' claims are barred by the PREP Act and that this Court lacks jurisdiction over those claims.
