The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion by the plaintiff, Diana Escoto, to compel the deposition of General Motors, LLC's Person Most Knowledgeable (PMK) regarding a variety of categories. The plaintiff alleges that General Motors, LLC sold her a defective 2023 Chevrolet Corvette and refused to repurchase the vehicle in violation of the Song-Beverly Act. The judge finds that the plaintiff's meet and confer efforts were insufficient and deny the motion to compel deposition. The judge orders the parties to further meet and confer regarding the deposition in this case specifically. If the plaintiff is still unable to take the deposition of General Motors, LLC's PMK, the judge invites the plaintiff to refile the motion.
