Here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling issued by Judge Hon. Jill Feeney on November 3, 2023, in the case of MURAL MEDIA, LLC 401K PLAN v. LINDA J. MAULTSBY, et al (Case No. 23STCV21442). The case involves an action for unlawful detainer, where Plaintiff MURAL MEDIA, LLC 401K PLAN seeks to evict Defendant LINDA J. MAULTSBY from a subject property in Los Angeles.

Defendant Maultsby had moved to quash service of summons, arguing that the service was defective. However, the Court finds that the process server's declaration of service is sufficient to meet Plaintiff's burden of proving the facts requisite to effective service. The process server informed the person at the residence of the general nature of the papers, left the papers outside of the front door, and mailed the papers on the same date. The Court denied Defendant Maultsby's motion to quash service of summons.

The parties are ordered to appear at the hearing to set a trial date, and Plaintiff is required to provide notice and file proof of service of such notice within five court days after the date of this order.
