 Significant Statements:
  - "A defendant moving for summary judgment has met his or her burden of showing that a cause of action has no merit if the party has shown that one or more elements of the cause of action . . . cannot be established." (Code Civ. Proc., section 437c(p)(2).)
  - "Once the defendant . . . has met that burden, the burden shifts to the plaintiff . . . to show that a triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to the cause of action or a defense thereto." (Code Civ. Proc., section 437c(p)(2).)
  - "A possible cause only becomes 'probable' when, in the absence of other reasonable causal explanations, it becomes more likely than not that the injury was a result of its action." (Jones v. Ortho Pharmaceutical Corp. (1985) 163 Cal.App.3d 396, 403.)
```

The judge's tentative ruling is that Defendant Yamazaki's motion for summary judgment is denied. The judge finds that a triable issue of material fact remains over whether Yamazaki's conduct fell below the standard of care and whether her conduct caused Plaintiff's injury. The judge overruled Yamazaki's objections to the expert testimony of Dr. Antoin, and concludes that Plaintiff's evidence shows that Yamazaki's conduct fell below the standard of care because she should have noted that Plaintiff's leg was already swollen and that anesthetic was previously administered in the area less than one month before Plaintiff's second procedure.
