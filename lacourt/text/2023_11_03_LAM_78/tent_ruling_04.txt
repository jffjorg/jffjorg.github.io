MAULTSBY, et al.Defendants.  Case No.:  23STCV21442 Hearing Date:  November 3, 2023    [TENTATIVE] RULING RE:  DEFENDANT MAULTSBY’S MOTION TO QUASH SERVICE OF SUMMONSDefendant Maultsby’s motion to quash service of summons is DENIED.Defendant’s time to file and serve a responsive pleading is five days after Defendant is served with a written notice of entry of this order denying the motion to quash. (CCP Section 1167.4(b).)The parties should appear at the hearing to set a trial date. Plaintiff to provide notice and to file proof of service of such notice within five court days after the date of this order.FACTUAL BACKGROUND   This is an action for unlawful detainer. Plaintiff alleges that on May 9, 2023, it acquired the subject property at a trustee’s sale after Maultsby defaulted on a loan secured by the property. (Compl., ¶9.) Defendant remains in possession of the property despite being served with a three day notice to quit. (Compl., ¶¶11-13.)PROCEDURAL HISTORY On September 1, 2023, Plaintiff filed its complaint against Defendant Linda Maultsby.On September 29, 2023, Defendant filed the instant motion to quash service of summons.DISCUSSION Defendant Linda Maultsby moves to quash service of summons under Code Civ. Proc., section 418.10 on the grounds that service was defective. “A defendant . . . may serve and file a notice of motion for one or more of the following purposes:  (1) To quash service of summons on the ground of lack of jurisdiction of the court over him or her. . . .” (Code Civ. Proc., § 418.10(a).) The motion must be filed on or before the last day on which the defendant must plead or within any further time that the court may for good cause allow. (Id.)“[C]ompliance with the statutory procedures for service of process is essential to establish personal jurisdiction. [Citation.]” (Dill v. Berquist Construction Co. (1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 1426, 1444.) “[T]he filing of a proof of service creates a rebuttable presumption that the service was proper” but only if it “complies with the statutory requirements regarding such proofs.” (Id. at 1441-1442.) When a defendant moves to quash service of the summons and complaint, the plaintiff has “the burden of proving the facts that did give the court jurisdiction, that is the facts requisite to an effective service.” (Coulston v. Cooper (1966) 245 Cal.App.2d 866, 868.) “A court lacks jurisdiction over a party if there has not been proper service of process.” (Ruttenberg v. Ruttenberg (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 801, 808.)Code Civ. Proc. section 415.20 provides that “[i]f a copy of the summons and complaint cannot with reasonable diligence be personally delivered to the person to be served . . . a summons may be served by leaving a copy of the summons and complaint at the person’s dwelling house, usual place of abode, usual place of business, or usual mailing address . . . in the presence of a competent member of the household . . . at least 18 years of age, who shall be informed of the contents thereof, and by thereafter mailing a copy of the summons and of the complaint by first-class mail…to the person to be served at the place where a copy of the summons and complaint were left . . . .” (Code Civ. Proc., section 415.20(b).) Service of a summons in this matter is deemed complete on the 10th day after the mailing. (Id.)As long as the process server identifies himself or herself and tells the reluctant defendant that he or she is being served with process and leaves the papers as close as possible to the defendant, service is valid notwithstanding the defendant's refusal to accept. (Trujillo v. Trujillo (1945) 71 CA2d 257, 260.)“Evidence Code section 647 provides that a registered process server’s declaration of service establishes a presumption affecting the burden of producing evidence of the facts stated in the declaration.” (American Express Centurion Bank v. Zara (2011) 199 Cal.App.4th 383, 390; Evid. Code § 647.)Here, Plaintiff’s proof of service filed on September 25, 2023 shows that on September 10, 2023, Plaintiff’s process server served the summons and complaint at 2759 S. Mansfield Ave., Los Angeles, CA 90016 on an African American male in his sixties with a bald head who was 5’10 and stocky. He would not give his name, closed the door, and sat back down by his desk a few feet from the door. The process server informed the man of the general nature of the papers. The process server mailed the papers via first class mail on September 14, 2023.Defendant testifies that on September 15, 2023, she found a copy of the summons and complaint outside her door. (Maultsby Decl., ¶2.) The Court finds that the process server’s declaration is sufficient to meet Plaintiff’s burden of proving the facts requisite to effective service. Plaintiff’s process server informed the man at the residence of the general nature of the papers, left the papers outside of the front door, and mailed the papers on the same date. Plaintiff does not dispute that there was a man at the address who could have been the person served and does not dispute that the papers were mailed. Although Plaintiff argues there were no orders from the court directing service through posting and mailing, no orders were necessary because Plaintiff affected substituted service, which is expressly permitted under Code Civ. Proc., section 415.20.Plaintiff’s motion to quash service of summons is denied.DATED: November 3, 2023 ____________________________Hon. Jill Feeney Judge of the Superior Court
