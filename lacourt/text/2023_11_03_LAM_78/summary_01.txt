And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Plaintiff Frances Falco's motion for leave to file a second amended complaint. The judge finds that the Plaintiff failed to provide a reasonable explanation for not seeking leave to amend at an earlier point, and that all the facts supporting the new causes of action have been known since the start of the case. The judge concludes that the causes of action should have been added regardless of whether the case would be tried by jury or judge. The judge also finds that the defendants would be prejudiced by the substantial delay in the trial that would be necessary to allow for the filing of demurrer and/or motion for summary adjudication on the new causes of action. The judge orders the moving party to provide notice.
