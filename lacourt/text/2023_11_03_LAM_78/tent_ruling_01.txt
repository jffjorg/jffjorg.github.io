  Case Number:  21STCV09973    Hearing Date:   November 3, 2023    Dept:  78 Superior Court of California County of Los Angeles Department 78  FRANCES FALCO, Plaintiff,  vs. CLIFFORD S. NEFSKY, et al., Defendants.  Case No.:  21STCV09973  Hearing Date:  November 3, 2023    [TENTATIVE] RULING RE:  PLAINTIFF FRANCES FALCO’S MOTION FOR LEAVE TO FILE A SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINTPlaintiff’s motion for Leave to File a Second Amended Complaint is DENIED.   Here, Plaintiff does not provide a reasonable explanation for the failure to seek to leave to amend at an earlier point. All the facts supporting the new causes of action have been known from the start. The causes of action should have been added regardless of whether the case was to be tried by jury or judge. Additionally, Defendants would be prejudiced by the substantial delay of the trial that would be necessary to allow time for the filing of a demurrer and/or a motion for summary adjudication as to the new causes of action.  Moving party to provide notice.DATED: November 3, 2023 ________________________Hon.
