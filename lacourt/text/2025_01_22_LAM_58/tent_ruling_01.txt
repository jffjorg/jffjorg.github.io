Background
 
            On April 14, 2023, Plaintiff Monet Sterling, individually and behalf of all aggrieved employees, filed a
representative action complaint against Defendant Dothan Security, Inc
(Defendant DSI). The Complaint alleges a violation of the California Labor Code
Private Attorneys General Act (PAGA) based on allegations that Defendant DSI violated
various wage and hour laws. The Complaint was later amended to add Plaintiffs Miguel
Ruiz, Andrew Tarigan, Carlton McGee, and Ricardo Wendell. 
 
            On December
23, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a motion to approve a settlement under PAGA. The
Settlement Agreement defines “aggrieved employees” as “all current and former
nonexempt employees employed by [Defendant] in California during the PAGA
Period.” (Ardestani Decl., Ex.
1 [PAGA Settlement Agreement], ¶ 1.4.) The “PAGA Period” is
defined as “means the period from February 7, 2022 through June 11, 2024 (or 8
weeks after the date of the mediation on April 16, 2024 ).” (Ardestani Decl., Ex. 1 [PAGA Settlement
Agreement], ¶ 1.19.) The breakdown of the settlement is
as follows: 
 
Gross Settlement Amount:                                         $830,000.00  
Plaintiff’s Counsel’s Fees:                                          $276,666.67 (33%)
Plaintiff’s Counsel’s Litigation Costs:                       $27,653.56
Plaintiff’s Service Award:                                          $2,500.00
(Each)  
Settlement Administration Costs:                               $4,000.00  
Net Settlement Amount (PAGA Penalties):               $509,179.77
 
Labor Workforce Development Agency (75%):             $381,884.83
Aggrieved Employees (25%):                                    $127,294.94
 
            Plaintiffs now seek court approval
of the PAGA settlement.  
 
Legal Standard
 
            The Private Attorneys General Act is
“a procedural statute allowing an aggrieved employee to recover civil
penalties—for Labor Code violations—that otherwise would be sought by state
labor law enforcement agencies.”  (Amalgamated
Transit Union, Local 1756, AFL-CIO v. Superior Court (2009) 46 Cal.4th 993,
1003.)  The statute provides a mechanism
for private enforcement of Labor Code violations for the public benefit.  (See Arias v. Superior Court (2009) 46
Cal.4th 969, 986.) The statute incentivizes aggrieved employees by providing 25
percent of the recovered civil penalties, while the remaining 75 percent is
distributed to the Labor and Workforce Development Agency (LWDA) “for
enforcement of labor laws…and for education of employers and employees about
their rights and responsibilities under [the Labor Code].”  (Lab. Code, § 2699, subd. (i).)  
 
            “The superior court shall review and
approve any settlement of any civil action filed pursuant to this part [Labor
Code Private Attorneys General Act of 2004].” (Lab. Code, § 2699, subd. (l)(2).)

 
            “[A] trial court should evaluate a
PAGA settlement to determine whether it is fair, reasonable, and adequate in
view of PAGA’s purposes to remediate present labor law violations, deter future
ones, and to maximize enforcement of state labor laws.”  (Moniz v. Adecco USA, Inc. (2021) 72
Cal.App.5th 56, 77.) A court should consider factors used in evaluating class
action settlements, such as the strength of the plaintiff’s case, the risk, the
stage of the proceeding, the complexity and likely duration of further
litigation, and the settlement amount. (Ibid.) Other factors that may be
useful in determining fairness include whether (1) the settlement is the result
of arm’s length bargaining, (2) investigation and discovery are sufficient to
allow counsel and the court to act intelligently, (3) counsel is experienced in
similar litigation, and (4) the percentage of objectors is small.  (Nordstrom Com. Cases (2010) 186
Cal.App.4th 576, 581; Wershba v. Apple Computer, Inc. (2001) 91
Cal.App.4th 224, 245.)  In considering
the amount of settlement, the court is mindful that compromise is inherent and
necessary in the settlement process.  (Wershba,
supra, 91 Cal.App.4th at p. 250.) 
 
Discussion
 
Service on the Labor and Workforce Development Agency
 
            Plaintiffs assert that the proposed
settlement was electronically served on the Labor and Work Force Development
Agency. (Ardestani Decl., ¶ 33, Ex. 5.)
 
Fair, Reasonable & Adequate
 
            The Court finds the proposed
settlement is fair, reasonable, and adequate to all concerned parties and is not
the product of fraud, collusion, or overreaching.
 
            Here, the parties attended a
full-day, private mediation, with Gig Kyriacou, Esq, an experienced mediator
with wage-and-hour class and representative actions. (Ardestani Decl., ¶ 15;
Tran Decl., ¶9.)  Prior to the
mediation, the parties exchanged informal discovery. (Ardestani Decl., ¶ 14.)
This discovery included the number of alleged aggrieved employees, the number
of aggregate pay periods, payroll information and time records for a sampling
of alleged aggrieved employees, employee handbooks and manuals, and other
policy documents regarding Defendant’s timekeeping and reporting policies. (Ardestani
Decl., ¶ 14.) The matter settled at mediation as the parties were able to reach
an arms-length settlement following extensive negotiations, by and through the
mediator. (Ardestani Decl., ¶ 15.) This satisfies the requirement that the
settlement was a result of arms-length bargaining.
 
            Plaintiffs’ counsel also avers that
he thoroughly investigated the facts and risks associated with the case. He concedes
the risks with the case. (Ardestani Decl., ¶¶ 15, 20-31, 36.)  Specifically, Defendant, at all times, denied
the claims. (Ardestani Decl., ¶ 21.) Additionally, with respect to the meal
periods claims, Defendant argues that Plaintiffs and the alleged Aggrieved
Employees were security guards, a position that is generally exempted from
off-duty meal periods. (Ardestani Decl., ¶ 25.) Defendant also asserted that
even to the extent any late or short meal periods occurred, such were outliers,
merely the result of human error and/or the employee’s choice, and in violation
of company policy. (Ardestani Decl., ¶ 26.) As to the reimbursement claim,
Defendant argues that the phone reimbursement claim was without merit because
the phones used were for personal convenience and was neither required nor
necessary to perform their job duties; similarly, Defendant argue that uniforms
were provided to Plaintiffs. (Ardestani Decl., ¶ 28.) 
 
            Plaintiff also provides a detailed
breakdown of the potential exposure. Defendant estimated there were 928
non-exempt employees during the applicable PAGA period, and these individuals
worked approximately 30,000 pay periods during that time. Based on the data and
information provided, Plaintiffs estimated Defendant’s maximum PAGA exposure at
approximately $15,069,500. (Ardestani Decl., ¶¶ 23-24.) 
 
The Court finds that Plaintiffs’ counsel has conducted
adequate investigation and use of discovery. Based on the risks of establishing
the case on the merits, the amount offered in settlement is reasonable.
 
Payment Procedures
 
            Within 30 days of the effective
date, Defendant shall pay the $830,000 with the Settlement Administrator. (Ardestani
Decl., ¶ 18, Ex. 1, ¶ 4.3.) Within 14 days of receiving the gross amount, the
Settlement Administrator will mail a Notice and settlement check to all
Aggrieved Employees via regular First-Class U.S. Mail, using the most current,
known mailing addresses identified in Defendant’s records. (Ardestani Decl., ¶
18, Ex. 1, ¶ 4.4.) Checks will be valid for 180 days and any uncashed amount
will be sent to the Unclaimed Property division of the California State
Controller’s office in the name of the aggrieved employee. (Ardestani Decl.,
Ex. 1, ¶¶ 4.4.1, 4.4.4)
 
            The Settlement Administrator will
issue IRS Form 1099s for each settlement payment.  (Ardestani Decl., Ex. 1, ¶ 3.2.3.2.)
 
Experience of Counsel
 
            All of Plaintiffs’ respective counsel are experienced
class and representative action litigators, and have achieved several approved
PAGA settlements. (Ardestani
Decl., ¶¶ 37-46; Tran Decl., ¶¶ 3-7; Marquez Decl, ¶¶ 13-17; Young Decl., ¶¶
10-15.)     
 
Attorney’s Fees and Litigation Costs
 
            Plaintiff requests $276,666.67in
attorney’s fees and $27,653.56 in costs.
 
            Labor Code section 2699, subdivision
(g)(1) provides “[a]ny employee who prevails in any action shall be entitled to
an award of reasonable attorney’s fees and costs . . . .” (Lab. Code, §
2699(g)(1).)
 
            The Court finds that Plaintiffs were
represented by experienced counsel and that the requested attorney fee award is
fair, adequate, and reasonable. The fee requested, $276,666.67, represents one-third
of the gross settlement, an amount routinely awarded in California courts in
class and PAGA actions. (Chavez v. Netflix, Inc. (2008) 162 Cal.App.4th
43, 66, fn. 11.) None of the parties have objected to this amount. Further,
Plaintiffs’ counsel submit its lodestar hours showing they incurred 386.1 total
attorney hours litigating the case – resulting in a $271,493.40 in attorney fees.
(Ardestani Decl., ¶¶ 37-51.) The Court finds that $276,666.67in attorney’s fees
is appropriate.
 
            As to costs, the Settlement
Agreement authorizes litigation costs not to exceed $32,000. The total incurred
was $27,653.56, which includes cost incurred in the amount of $11,690.05 for
Crosner Legal, PC, $6,565.75 for Lavi & Ebrahimian, LLP, $3,385.71 for
Wilshire Law Firm, and $6,012.05 for Mahoney Law Group. (Ardestani Decl., ¶¶
53-54; Tran Decl., ¶ 19; Marquez Decl., ¶ 9, Ex. A;
Young Decl., ¶ 9, Ex. B.)
 
Plaintiff’s Service Award
 
            Plaintiffs also each request $2,500 as
a service award for the time and effort they exerted on behalf of the aggrieved
employees. Plaintiffs assert that they have been actively involved in the case
by engaging in regular communication with their attorneys by discussing
litigation strategy, witnesses, and updates. (Sterling Decl., ¶¶ 2-11; Ruiz
Decl., ¶¶ 2-9; Tarigan Decl., ¶¶ 2-14;
McGee Decl., ¶¶ 2-16; Wendell Decl., ¶¶ 2-15.) The Court finds that this amount
is reasonable in exchange for a general release of claims. 
 
Settlement Administration Costs
 
            The parties have agreed to engage Simpluris,
Inc. as the third-party settlement administrator and requests court approval of
$4,000.00 for administration costs.  (Ardestani Decl., ¶ 18.) Plaintiffs submits Simpluris’ bid for settlement
administration, which contains an itemized statement of the various tasks that Simpluris
will undertake; Simpluris will conduct data analysis, perform skip-tracing
as necessary, calculate and disburse payments, provide tax reporting, re-issue
checks, and perform other administrative tasks. (Springer Decl., ¶¶ 6, 9, Ex. C.)
 
            The Court approves the requested $4,000.
 
Release
 
            The Court finds the release under
the Settlement Agreement is fair and reasonable.  (Ardestani Decl., ¶ 19, Ex. 1, ¶ 5.)  
 
Conclusion 
 
            The motion to approve settlement of
claims brought under the Private Attorneys General Act is granted.
