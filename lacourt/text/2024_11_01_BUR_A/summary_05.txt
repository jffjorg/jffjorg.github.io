And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (LACMTA) in their motion to compel discovery responses from Grigor Aghekyan, the plaintiff. The LACMTA had served discovery requests on Aghekyan, including interrogatories, special interrogatories, and requests for production of documents, but Aghekyan had failed to respond. The judge notes that Aghekyan's failure to respond is deemed acquiescence to the merits of the motion, and therefore the motion is granted. The judge orders Aghekyan to submit further responses to the discovery requests within 30 days. The LACMTA is also ordered to give notice. The judge declines to award sanctions to the LACMTA, as they did not request any.
