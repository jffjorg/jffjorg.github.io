And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on two motions filed by Garfield Beach CVS, LLC (CVS) seeking leave to file cross-complaints against co-defendants Cultured Investments, LLC and Abstract Holdings, LLC. The motions are unopposed, and the judge notes that a failure to oppose a motion may be deemed acquiescence to the merits of the motion.

The judge analyzes the legal standards for compulsory and permissive cross-complaints, citing relevant California statutes and case law. The judge concludes that the cross-complaints would serve the interests of justice by preventing duplicative litigation and reducing the multiplicity of actions resulting from the singular incident.

The judge grants the motions for leave to file the cross-complaints, allowing CVS to file its cross-complaints against Cultured and Abstract within 15 days. The judge also orders CVS to give notice to the parties and the court.

The judge's ruling is subject to change if any party requests oral argument or submits written opposition to the tentative ruling.
