  Case Number:  22PSCV01736    Hearing Date:   November 7, 2024    Dept:  O Tentative Ruling
 
(1)   PLAINTIFF’S
MOTION FOR ATTORNEYS’ FEES AND COSTS is GRANTED but in the reduced
amount of $17,748.32 ($14,000 in attorney fees + $3,748.32 in costs). The
court request Plaintiffs file a new proposed order. 
 
(2)   GENERAL MOTORS LLC’S NOTICE OF
MOTION AND MOTION TO STRIKE COUNSEL’S MEMORANDUM OF COSTS is DENIED. 
 
Background
 
This is a lemon law case. 
 
On November 8, 2022, Plaintiffs JOHNNY LABARTA and
JENNIFER ROSE LABARTA filed suit against Defendant General Motors, LLC for
various defects in their leased 2021 Cadillac Escalade. 
 
On December 14, 2022, Defendant filed its answer.
 
On June 20, 2024, the parties filed a notice of
settlement. 
 
On August 5, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a motion for attorney
fees. 
 
On August 15, 2024, Defendant filed the instant motion to
tax
 
On September 17, 2024, the court held oral argument on
the matter. The court continued the matter because the motion inadvertently
included only the audited billing records for Plaintiffs’ counsel, Julian
Moore, and included the correct audited billing record in reply. The minute
order required that Defendant
to file an opposition on or before October 18, 2024 and Plaintiffs to file
their Reply on or before October 31, 2024.
 
 
Legal Standard Re: Attorney Fees 
 
Plaintiff brings forth the
motion pursuant to Civil Code section 1794 subdivision (d). (Motion p. 7.) In
turn, the statute provides the following:
 
If the buyer prevails in an
action under this section, the buyer shall be allowed by the court to recover
as part of the judgment a sum equal to the aggregate amount of costs and
expenses, including attorney’s fees based on actual time expended, determined
by the court to have been reasonably incurred by the buyer in connection
with the commencement and prosecution of such action. (Civ. Code §1794(d)
(emphasis added).) 
 
As for
determining the “reasonableness” of attorney costs incurred in fee shifting
cases, the inquiry in California ordinarily begins with the “lodestar” method
which embraces a two-step method. (See also Motion p. 7.)
 
The first
step requires a trial court to multiply the time reasonably spent by Plaintiff
counsel on the case by a reasonable hourly rate. A computation of time spent on
a case and the reasonable value of that time is fundamental to a determination
of an appropriate attorneys’ fee award. 
 
The second step allows a trial court
to adjust or enhance the lodestar by applying a multiplier to consider the
contingent nature and risk associated with the action, as well as other
factors, such as degree of skill required, ultimate success achieved, and
“extraordinary legal skill.” (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122,
1130, 1132, 1137; see also Serrano v. Priest
(1977) 20 Cal.3d 25, 49 (Serrano III) [identifies seven factors that a
trial court properly considers in its decision to augment the lodestar
calculation].) The factors considered in
determining the modification of the lodestar include the nature and difficulty
of the litigation, the amount of money involved, the skill
required and employed to handle the case, the attention given,
the success or failure, and other circumstances in the case. (EnPalm,
LLC v. Teitler Family Trust (2008) 162 Cal. App. 4th 770, 774, emphasis
added and underline added).) A negative modifier was appropriate when
duplicative work had been performed. (Thayer v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.
(2001) 92 Cal.App.4th 819.) The amount of the
multiplier lies within the court’s sound discretion. (Ketchum, supra, 24
Cal.4th 1122, 1138 [“To the extent a
trial court is concerned that a particular award is excessive, it has broad
discretion to adjust the fee downward or deny an unreasonable fee
altogether.”], see also Motion p. 8:11-12.)
 
After the
trial court has performed the lodestar calculations, it shall consider whether
the total award so calculated under all
of the circumstances of the case is more than a reasonable amount and, if
so, shall reduce the award so that it is a reasonable figure.  (PLCM
Group v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095-96.) 
 
Discussion Re: Attorney Fees 
 
Plaintiff moves the court to issue an
Order awarding Plaintiff attorneys’ fees and costs in the amount of (1) $41,098.32. Such amount consists of a) $32,350.00
in attorney fees and $3,748.32 in recoverable costs and expenses for Consumer
Law Experts, P.C.; and reservation for an additional $5,000.00 for Plaintiffs
counsel to review Defendant's Opposition, draft the Reply brief, and attend the
hearing on this issue. (Motion p. 2.) (Plaintiffs claim 70 hours were
billed + 9.5 hours for this motion for a total of 79.5 hours). 
 
The court agrees with Defendant
that the hours expended are unreasonable as this is a standard, non-complex
lemon law matter that was settled within the statutory limits, without any
dispositive motions and without a trial. Additionally, the court reduces the
hourly rate to $350/hour. 
 
1.    
Hours Expended 
 
Plaintiffs’
Counsel claims to have spent 40.2 hours ($19,057.50) in preparing the following
template documents and motions: Complaint (.8 hours); Discovery Responses (3.7
hours); Motion to Compel PMK (5.2 hours); Motion to Compel Compliance (3.9
hours); Deposition Notices and Subpoenas to Non-Parties (6.9 hours); Fee Demand
(19.7 hours). The court agrees with Defendant that these time entries are
unreasonable namely as this case is similar to almost any other the last 94
cases filed by the firm. 
 
With respect to
this argument—the use of templated documents warrants a reduction in hours—Plaintiffs concede that they
involved same legal support. (See Reply p. 1:24-27 [“Initially,
Defendant calls all of the documents templated, including a Motion to Compel
Compliance, which relied on unique facts and circumstances and though
relying on similar arguments and the same legal support as many other
motions, was wholly necessary due to Defendant’s failure to comply with
this Court’s Order.”], emphasis added.) 
 
With
respect to the discovery, Plaintiffs aver that “the vehicle and its
symptomology are unique.” (Opp. p. 2.) This argument is unavailing plaintiff’s
firms in lemon law cases generally rely upon the manufacturer’s alleged
knowledge and concealment of defects based upon complaints posted on the
National Highway Transportation Safety Administration or TSBs that pertain to other
makes and models. 
 
To the extent
that Plaintiffs argue that verified time records are afforded a presumption of credibility
(i.e., time records are entitled to credence in the absence of a clear
indication the records are erroneous), that is true, but a trial court may deny
compensation for “inefficient or duplicative” work. (Opp. p. 6, citing Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1132, emphasis added.) Here, six
different timekeepers billed on this matter, and a general observation that
an attorney over litigated a case or submitted a padded bill would fully
justify a reduced fee recovery. (Opp. p. 6, citing Donahue v. Donahue (2010)
182 Cal.App.4th 259, 271; Guckenberger v. Boston Univ. (D.Mass. 1998) 8
F.Supp.2d 91, 101) [“[J]ust as there can be too many cooks in the kitchen,
there can be too many lawyers on a case.”].) For one, as noted by Defendant,
the lemon law cases are similar in nature, process/procedure, and outcome;
thus, “[r]ather than work toward settling the matter to the best interest of
its client, Counsel chose to follow its standard playbook and serve these
motions to increase their fees.” (Opp. pp. 5-6.) Additionally, the billing
entries largely show the attorneys “reviewing” documents or performing clerical
work like “coordinating deposition(s)” or “confirming depositions.” In
short, the billing entries look so similar to suggest task padding. Therefore,
contrary to Plaintiffs’ contention that Defendant has not proffered evidence of
unreasonable hours expended, the billing entries themselves strongly suggest
duplicative billing. 
 
Therefore,
the court finds 35 hours reasonable on this case. 
 
2.     Hourly
Rate[1]
 
In their
motion, Plaintiffs contend that the reasonable hourly rates for the attorneys
who worked on this case is $515.00 for partner Julian Moore and $350.00 for
associates Joseph Kowalski and Arbre Kornely. But a review of the billable
hours indicates that Moore bills at $530/hour and Kornely at $400. The
billing hours do not reflect that Kowalski worked on this matter; Cesar
Utuy, Sean Crandall, Jessica Anvar, and Joshua Fennel were the other attorneys
who worked on the case. 
 
Therefore,
as lemon law cases can typically be handled by associates, the hourly rates are
reduced to $350/hour. 
 
Thus, the
court awards 40 hours (including this motion) x $350/hour = $14,000. 
 
B.
Motion to Tax Costs
Legal Standard re: Motion to Strike Counsel’s
Memorandum of Costs[2]

Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) section
1032 subdivision (b), “a prevailing party is entitled as a matter of right to
recover costs in any action or proceeding.” The non-prevailing party may
dispute any or all of the items in the prevailing party’s costs memorandum by a
motion to tax costs. (CRC 3.1700(b).)
Costs recoverable under the statute are restricted
to those that are both: (i)
reasonable in amount and (ii) reasonably necessary to the conduct of
litigation. (CCP section 1033.5(c)(2) & (3).) But costs that are “merely
convenient or beneficial” are disallowed. (Id. at (c)(2); see also Ladas
v. California State Automobile Association (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 761, 774.)
Whether a cost item was reasonably necessary to the litigation presents a
question of fact for the trial court and its decision is reviewed for abuse of
discretion. (Ibid.) “If the items appearing in a cost bill appear to be proper
charges, the burden is on the party seeking to tax costs to show that they were
not reasonable or necessary. On the other hand, if the items are properly
objected to, they are put in issue and the burden of proof is on the party
claiming them as costs.” (Ibid, emphasis added.)
Plaintiffs’
Counsel seeks $3,748.32, but Defendant asks for a reduction of $2,338.73 for a
total recovery of $1,409.59 in costs. The costs include the following: 
 
-       
$217.11
for the “Case Management Statement” and “Notice of posting jury fees” 
-       
$74.04
in “Notice of Name Extension
-       
$12.34
in “Notice of Change of Address”
-       
$25.04
in filing costs associated with the “Notice of Continuance and Notice of
Settlement”
-       
$86.94
for costs associated with filing Plaintiffs’ “Motion to Compel Further
Discovery and IDC
-       
$576.80
for “service of process” and $744.25 in “[d]eposition costs” related to the
depositions of non-party dealership Cadillac of Las Vegas West’s PMQ and its
service technicians
-       
$602.21
in the category “Other” for “Notice of CMC and OSC and Mediation” costs
 
Defendant argues that much of these costs are vague,
overhead costs/unrelated to litigation, administrative costs, and or otherwise
unnecessary. 
 
Here, Plaintiffs adequately met their burden to show that
their costs were necessary, and Defendant does not otherwise squarely
address those points in reply. (The reply is largely identical to the
motion.) 
 
For one, some costs (for notice of settlement, notice of
continuance, and notice of change of address) are required by the
court or the California Rules of Court. Next, with respect to depositions, it is relevant and necessary to
depose the repairing dealerships and technicians as percipient third-party
witnesses to authenticate the repair orders (or any other documents these
dealerships may produce), and to discuss the steps that were taken by each
dealership to eradicate the defects in the subject vehicle. Additionally, with
respect to the discovery motion, Plaintiffs’ Counsel explains that the costs
were necessary because of “Defendant’s failure to communicate with
Plaintiffs, refusal to provide relevant and necessary discovery, and
non-compliance with a Court Order.” (Opp. p. 5:21-23.) 
 
Therefore,
Defendant has failed to meet its burden to challenge Plaintiffs’ claimed costs.

 
Conclusion
 
Based on
the foregoing, Plaintiffs may recover the entirety of their costs.
