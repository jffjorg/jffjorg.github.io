[1] Defendant does not appear to take issue with the hourly
rates, but the hourly rate Defendant is using in its calculation is also
unclear. Generally, this court awards between $250 to $300 in lemon law cases;
however, absent a clear argument for a reduction of hours, the court reduces
the hourly rate to $350. 
 


[2] Though the motion is captioned as a ‘motion to strike,’
the motion’s substantive language and relief seeks to tax costs.
