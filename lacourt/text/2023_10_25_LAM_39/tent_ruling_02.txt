Case No.
23STCV09873
Demurrer and
Motion to Strike
 
            Plaintiffs
Barry C. Woods and Lashay B. Woods (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) filed this
action against Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC (“Defendant”).  Now, Defendant demurs to the Song-Beverly
Consumer Warranty Act claims and moves to strike the prayer for relief to the
extent Plaintiffs seek to recover the entire purchase price of the vehicle, the
diminution in value, and civil penalties. 
The Court orders as follows:
 
            1.         The Court overrules the demurrer, as
the allegations are sufficient.  
 
            2.         The Court denies the motion to strike,
as Plaintiff is entitled to seek revocation of acceptance of the vehicle,
recission, reimbursement, and/or restitution, i.e., the entire purchase price
of the vehicle.
 
            3.         Defendant’s counsel shall provide
notice and file proof of such with the Court.
