And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer and motion to strike filed by Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC against Barry C. Woods and Lashay B. Woods. The plaintiffs had filed an action against the defendant under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act, seeking to recover the entire purchase price of the vehicle, the diminution in value, and civil penalties. The defendant had demurred to the claims and moved to strike the prayer for relief. The judge has overruled the demurrer, finding that the allegations are sufficient to support the claims. The judge has also denied the motion to strike, holding that the plaintiffs are entitled to seek revocation of acceptance of the vehicle, recission, reimbursement, and/or restitution, including the entire purchase price of the vehicle. The judge has ordered the defendant's counsel to provide notice and file proof of such with the court.
