  Case Number:  22STCV27676    Hearing Date:   October 25, 2023    Dept:  39 Snyder Langston
Residential, LLC v. Senator 2015 L.P.
Case No.
22STCV27676
Motion To Be
Relieved
 
            Counsel for
Senator 2015 L.P. moves to be relieved. 
Good cause having been shown, the Court orders as follows:
 
            1.         The Court grants Counsel’s motion conditional
on Counsel complying with this order.
 
            2.         Because Senator 2015 L.P. cannot appear
as a self-represented party, the Court issues an Order to Show Cause why the
answer should not be stricken, and why the cross-complaint should not be
dismissed, for lack of representation. 
The OSC hearing shall be held on December 11, 2023, at 8:30 a.m. at the
following location:
 
            Stanley
Mosk Courthouse
            111 North
Hill Street
            Department
#39 (Goorvitch, J.)
            Los
Angeles, California 90012
 
The parties may appear remotely or in-person.  The Court provides notice: If Senator 2015
L.P. does not retain counsel in advance of the OSC date, absent good cause, the
Court will strike the answer (which would permit Plaintiff to seek entry of
default and default judgment) and the Court will dismiss the
cross-complaint.  The Court authorizes a
prospective attorney to appear on that date/time to request a continuance in
order to finalize the representation.
 
            3.         The Court orders Counsel for Senator
2015 L.P. to serve a copy of this minute order, as well as the signed order,
upon all parties, including his former client. 
 
            4.         The Court orders Counsel for Senator
2015 L.P. to file a proof of service indicating that BOTH this minute order and
the signed order were served on his former client.
 
            5.         Once Counsel for Senator 2015 L.P.
complies with Item #4 and Item #5 in this order, he shall be automatically
relieved.
 
            6.         Counsel for Senator 2015 L.P. shall
provide notice and file proof of such with the Court.
