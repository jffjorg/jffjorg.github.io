The judge has granted Counsel's motion to be relieved from representing Senator 2015 L.P., but has done so conditionally. The judge has also ordered Senator 2015 L.P. to appear at an Order to Show Cause hearing on December 11, 2023, to explain why the answer should not be stricken and the cross-complaint should not be dismissed due to lack of representation. If Senator 2015 L.P. does not retain counsel by the hearing date, the judge will strike the answer and dismiss the cross-complaint, allowing the plaintiff to seek default judgment. The judge has authorized a prospective attorney to appear on behalf of Senator 2015 L.P. to request a continuance to finalize representation.
