The judge found that some of the Defendant's costs, specifically those related to service of process for Kevin Paulson and certain depositions, were not "reasonably necessary" to the case and were therefore disallowed.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the plaintiff's motion to tax costs in the case of Amco Insurance Company vs. Southern California Gas Co. The defendant had filed a Memorandum of Costs seeking to recover $26,358.66 in costs, but the plaintiff challenged certain costs, totaling $14,113.97. The judge has taxed (i.e., disallowed) only $468.65 of the costs, which were for serving a subpoena on Kevin Paulson at a second address. The judge found that the other challenged costs, including deposition costs, Service of Process costs, electronic filing or service fees, and Subpoena fees, were reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation and therefore allowable. The judge cited relevant laws and case citations, including Code of Civil Procedure §1033.5 and Perko's Enterprises, Inc. v. RRNS Enterprises, to support the ruling.
