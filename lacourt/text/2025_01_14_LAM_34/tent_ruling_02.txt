Legal
Standard
 
A party who originally made an
application for an order which was refused in whole or part, or granted
conditionally or on terms, may make a subsequent application for the same order
upon new or different facts, circumstances, or law, in which case it shall be
shown by affidavit what application was made before, when and to what judge,
what order or decisions were made, and what new or different facts,
circumstances, or law are claimed to be shown. For a failure to comply with
this subdivision, any order made on a subsequent application may be revoked or
set aside on ex parte motion. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1008, subd. (b).)¿ 
 
For renewed motion purposes, a moving
party must provide not only new evidence but also a satisfactory explanation
for the failure to produce that evidence at an earlier time. (See California
Correctional Peace Officers Assn. v. Virga (2010) 181 Cal.App.4th 30, 46-48
(Virga) [affirming trial court order denying what amounted to a renewed
motion for attorney fees “in the absence of a sufficient explanation why
appellants did not rely on the federal statute [new law] in their original
motion”]; accord. Baldwin v. Home Savings of America (1997) 59
Cal.App.4th 1192, 1198, 1200-1201 (Baldwin) [reversing trial court order
granting motion for reconsideration of an attorney fees award where “[c]ounsel
[asking for reconsideration] made no effort whatsoever to explain the failure
to previously present the case, then two years old, or the principle for which
it stands, as an alternative basis for denial of appellants’ motion for
attorney fees” pursuant to Code Civ. Proc., § 1008, subd. (a)].)¿ 
 
Renewed motions under section 1008,
subdivision (b) differ in substance and procedures from motions for
reconsideration under section 1008, subdivision (a). (Tate v. Wilburn
(2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 150, 160.) Unlike a motion for reconsideration, a
renewed motion does not ask the court to modify, amend, or revoke the prior
order, but instead it is a pure renewal of the first motion. (California
Correctional Peace Officers Assn. v. Virga (2010) 181 Cal.App.4th 30,
42-43). A renewal motion is proper even if the moving party concedes that the
court’s initial ruling was correct but is now erroneous in light of changed
circumstances. (Deauville Restaurant, Inc. v. Superior Court (2001) 90
Cal.App.4th 843, 848 (Deauville Restaurant).)¿ 
 
Other key differences between a motion
for reconsideration and a renewed motion is that a renewed motion can only be
brought by the party whose original motion was denied in whole or in part, has
no time limit for filing, and need not be considered by the same judge who
denied the original motion. (Deauville Restaurant, supra, 90
Cal.App.4th at p. 851.) However, statutory or jurisdictional deadlines
attached to the underlying motions remain applicable. (See, e.g., Kunysz v.
Sandler (2007) 146 Cal.App.4th 1540, 1543 [motion to renew an anti-SLAPP
motion, brought nine months after the first amended complaint was filed, was
untimely because it was outside the 60-day statutory period for filing an
anti-SLAPP motion]; see also Code Civ. Proc., § 660 [court cannot reconsider an
order denying a motion for new trial after the jurisdictional 60-day period for
the court to grant or deny that motion has passed]; Jones v. Sieve
(1988) 203 Cal.App.3d 359, 370 [“the power of a trial court to rule on a motion
for a new trial is constrained by the jurisdictional 60–day limitation period
of section 660, which is a specific statute, and cannot be extended or expanded
by the procedural device of moving under section 1008, a general statute, for
reconsideration of an order granting or denying a new trial motion, which
necessarily involves a request to correct judicial error”].)¿ 
 
Discussion
 
            Defendants seek leave of court
to file a renewed and amended anti-SLAPP motion pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 1008, subdivision (b), based on what Defendants consider is a
recent change in the law. As an initial matter, under Code of Civil Procedure
section 425.16(f), an anti-SLAPP motion must be filed within 60-days of the
service of the complaint, or at a later time as deemed proper by the court. (Code Civ. Proc., § 425.16, subd. (f).)
Such statutory deadline must be imposed on Defendants’ renewal motion even if section
1008(b) does not impose a time limit for filing. (Kunysz, supra, 146
Cal.App.4th 1543.) It is undisputed that Defendants’
present motion was not filed within the 60-day statutory period imposed by
section 425.16(f). 
 
            Defendants contend that the decision
reached in Norman v. Ross (2024) 101 Cal.App.5th 617 has changed the law
on the application of the anti-SLAPP statutes in the present case and expressly
rejected the reasoning found in Jordan-Benel v. Universal City Studios, Inc.
(9th Cir. 2017) 859 F.3d 1184, which Defendants argue was the basis for this
court’s denial of Defendants’ first anti-SLAPP motion and the Appellate Court’s
decision affirming the denial. (Motion, at p. 4.) 
 
            The court notes that “[t]he law of
the case doctrine holds that when an appellate opinion states a principle or
rule of law necessary to the decision, that principle or rule becomes the law
of the case and must be adhered to through its subsequent progress in the lower
court and upon subsequent appeal. [Citations.]” (People v. Cooper (2007)
149 Cal.App.4th 500, 524.) For the doctrine to apply, several conditions must
be met: the point of law must have been necessary to the prior decision, it
must have been actually presented and determined by the court, and applying the
doctrine must not result in an unjust decision. (Ibid.) 
 
            Upon review of the rulings of this
court and the Court of Appeals, the threshold issue determined in the instant
case to deny Defendants’ initial anti-SLAPP motion was that Defendants failed
to carry their burden in proving that Plaintiff’s claims were based on a
protected activity. Such determination was both necessary, actually presented,
and determined by the Appellate Court’s decision to affirm this court’s ruling.

 
            Moreover, applying the reasoning
used by the Appellate Court’s decision in Norman to determine a
subsequent anti-SLAPP motion filed by Defendants would be unjust. While Norman
expressly disagrees with the analysis in Jordan-Benel, it does not
overrule or abrogate the decision in Jordan-Benel as “there is no
horizontal stare decisis in the California Court of Appeal.” (Sarti v. Salt
Creek Ltd. (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 1187, 1193.) Unlike other cases in which a
decision relied on was later abrogated or overturned, Jordan-Benel remains
in effect. Norman presents merely a conflict in law, not a material
change in law that makes reliance on Jordan-Benel improper. As such, the
court does not deem that there are proper grounds for allowing Defendants to
file a renewed anti-SLAPP motion past the statutory deadline imposed by section
425.16(f). 
 
            Additionally, while Defendants do
not cite to section 1008(c) to provide authority for Defendants to bring their
renewal motion, the court nevertheless addresses the inherit power to reconsider
a prior ruling based on a “change of law” on its own motion. 
 
            “If a court at any time determines
that there has been a change of law that warrants it to reconsider a prior
order it entered, it may do so on its own motion and enter a different order.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1008, subd. (c).) As “change of law” is not defined in Code
of Civil Procedure section 1008, subdivision (c), the court has “very broad
power” to determine if a change of law warrants an exercise of its discretion.
(Farmers Ins. Exchange v. Superior Court (2013) 218 Cal.App.4th 96,
106.) In doing so, courts “may consider a number of factors in determining
whether to exercise its discretion, including the importance of the change of
law, the timing of the motion, and the circumstances of the case.” (Id.,
at p. 107.) 
 
            For the reasons mentioned above, the
court does not find that the decision in Norman constitutes a change in
the law. However, even if the court considered Norman to constitute a
change in the law, other factors militate against reconsidering the court’s
prior order denying Defendants’ anti-SLAPP motion. Nearly six months have
passed between Defendants filed this 1008(b) motion and when Norman was
decided. While the statutory limit imposed by section 1008(b) does not limit
the court’s discretion under section 1008(c), the court nonetheless finds it
problematic for parties to seek reconsideration of rulings based on a new
appellate decision months after the ruling unless that appellate decision
abrogates the authorities the court had previously relied on. Where, as here,
the appellate decision came months later and did not completely remove the
legal support for the court’s ruling, the court will decline to exercise its
discretion to reconsider the decision already affirmed by the appellate court. 
 
            Additionally, the court recognizes
that even without a change of law, a trial court may exercise its inherent
jurisdiction to reconsider an interim ruling.¿(Le Francois v. Goel
(2005) 35 Cal.4th 1094, 1096-1097.) As such, section 1008 limits the parties’
ability to file repetitive motions to reconsider but does not limit the court’s
ability to reconsider its prior interim orders to correct its own
errors. (Id., at p. 1109.) 
 
            As the court previously noted, Norman
did not overrule Jordan-Benel but created a split of authority.
Under the doctrine of stare decisis, superior courts are bound by all published
decisions of the Court of Appeal, but where there is a split in authority, the
superior court may choose which appellate decision to follow. (Auto Equity
Sales, Inc. v. Superior Court (1962) 57 Cal.2d 450, 456.) The court concludes
that it should not allow Defendants to file a renewed anti-SLAPP motion for the
court to reconsider using the Norman decision when Jordan-Benel is
still an appropriate basis for the court to deny Defendants’ motion and such
decision was affirmed by the Appellate Court. 
 
            Based on the foregoing, Defendants’
motion is denied.

Defendants NBCUniversal Media LLC,
Working Title Group LLC, Focus Features LLC, Douglas Management LTD, Gary
Oldman, Douglas Urbanski, and Jim Osborne’s Motion for Leave to File Renewed
and Amended Anti-SLAPP Motion is DENIED.
