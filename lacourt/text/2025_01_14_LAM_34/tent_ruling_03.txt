Legal
Standard
 
1.    
Motion to Compel Responses to Form
Interrogatories and Requests for Production
 
            California
Code of Civil Procedure requires a response from the party to whom form
interrogatories, special interrogatories, and demand requests are propounded
within 30 days after service of the requests, unless the time is extended by
agreement of the parties. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.260, subd. (a), 2030.270,
subd. (a), 2031.260, subd. (a), 2031.270, subd. (a).)
If a party fails to serve timely responses, "the party making the demand
may move for an order compelling response to the demand.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.300, subd. (b).) By failing to respond, the offending party waives any
objection to the demand. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).) 
 
            For a
motion to compel, all a propounding party must show is that it properly served
its discovery requests, that the time to respond has expired, and that the
party to whom the requests were directed failed to provide a timely response.
(See Leach v. Super. Ct. (1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 902, 905, 906.) Indeed,
"[o]nce [a party] 'fail[ed] to serve a timely response,' the trial court
had authority to grant [opposing party's] motion to compel responses." (Sinaiko
Healthcare Counseling, Inc. v. Pac. Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 390, 405.) 
 
            The court
shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes a motion to compel motions for interrogatories or requests for
production, unless the court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust. If a party then fails to obey an order compelling
answers, the court may make those orders that are just, including the
imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in
addition to that sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290,
subd. (c), 2031.300, subd. (c).) 
 
2.    
Motion to Deem Requests for Admissions
Admitted
 
When a party fails to serve a timely response to
a request for admission, the party propounding the request for admission may
move for an order to deem the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any
matters specified in the requests admitted. (Code Civ. Proc., §¿2033.280, subd.
(b).) A party who fails to provide a timely response waives any objection,
including one based on privilege or work product. (Id., § 2033.280,
subd. (a).) “The court shall make this order, unless it finds that the party to
whom the requests for admission have been directed has served, before the
hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests for admission that
is in substantial compliance with Section  2033.220. It is mandatory that
the court impose a monetary sanction… on the party or attorney, or both, whose
failure to serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated this
motion.” (Id., § 2033.280, subd. (c).) 
 
Discussion
 
On September 10, 2024, Plaintiffs
propounded form interrogatories, request for production of documents, and
request for admissions, sets one, on Defendant Vincent Pham. (FROGs Motion, at
p. 3; RPDs Motion, at p. 3; RFAs Motion, at p. 3; Boortz Decl., ¶ 2.) Plaintiffs
contend that Vincent’s discovery responses were due by October 15, 2024. (FROGs
Motion, at p. 4; RPDs Motion, at p. 3; RFAs Motion, at p. 3; Boortz Decl., ¶ 2.)
 On November 12, 2024, the court held an
IDC ordering Vincent to meet and confer with Plaintiffs’ counsel and to respond
to Plaintiffs’ discovery requests by November 25, 2024. (FROGs Motion, at p. 4;
RPDs Motion, at p. 3; RFAs Motion, at p. 3; Boortz Decl., ¶ 7.) Plaintiffs’
counsel declares that Vincent has not responded to any of the discovery
requests. (Boortz Decl., ¶ 8.)  
 
Vincent does not oppose Plaintiffs’
discovery motions. Although Vincent has filed Proof of Service of his
responses, there is no evidence before the court that would indicate Vincent
propounded code-compliant responded to any of Plaintiffs’ discovery requests. 
 
As such, the court grants
Plaintiffs’ Motion to Compel Responses to Form Interrogatories and Request for
Production of Documents, Sets One, propounded on September 10, 2024. Vincent
shall provide initial responses, without objections, to the Form
Interrogatories and Request for Production of Documents, sets one, within
fourteen (14) days of the issuance of this order.  
 
            The court also
grants Plaintiffs’ Motion to Deem Request for Admissions Admitted. Request for
Admissions, set one, is deemed admitted. 
 
Moreover, Plaintiffs request
monetary sanctions in connection with these discovery motions. (FROGs Motion,
at p. 5; RPDs Motion, at p. 4; RFAs Motion, at p. 4.) The court does not have
evidence before it that would indicate there were timely responses, that there
is substantial justification for the failure to respond, or that there are
other circumstances that would make the imposition of a sanction unjust. Thus,
the court must impose monetary sanctions.   
 
            Plaintiffs seek $4,305.00 in
sanctions for attorney’s fees and costs associated with bringing these motions.
Plaintiffs’ counsel declares that he spent 2.25 hours, at $500.00 per hour,
preparing these motions (Boortz Decl., ¶ 9.) Plaintiffs also incurred a filing
fee of $60.00 per motion. (Ibid.) Since Plaintiffs’ motions are
unopposed, the court finds that Plaintiffs’ counsel did not require an
additional 3.00 hours to prepare reply papers. Additionally, the court will hear
all three motions at the same time, eliminating the need for 3.00 hours to
prepare and attend the hearing on these motions. The court will therefore award
Plaintiffs monetary sanctions in the reduced amount of $1,805.00, comprised of
$1,625.00 in attorney’s fees incurred for 2.25 hours spent preparing these
motions and one hour of counsel’s time to prepare and attend the hearing,
multiplied by the hourly rate of $500.00, plus a $60.00 filing fee per motion.
Said monetary sanctions must be paid by Defendant Vincent Pham within 30 days
of the court’s order.
