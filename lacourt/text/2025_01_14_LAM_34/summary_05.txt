And here is the summary in English text:

This tentative ruling grants Plaintiff Sonia Elizabeth Romero Martinez's motion to file a first amended complaint. The motion seeks to add two new causes of action for common carrier and product liability to the original complaint, which alleged negligence, premises liability, and products liability. The Plaintiff argues that further research has revealed that proprietors of buildings and servicers of elevators are common carriers, which gives rise to a heightened duty of care and allows the Plaintiff to allege these new causes of action.

The Defendant, Liftech Elevator Services Inc., opposes the motion, arguing that the Plaintiff failed to adequately explain when the facts giving rise to the amended allegations were discovered or why leave to amend was not sought earlier. Liftech also argues that the new causes of action fail as a matter of law and that it would be prejudiced by the amendment.

The Judge finds that the Plaintiff has complied with the requirements for amending the complaint and that the Defendants will not be prejudiced by the amendment. The Judge grants the motion and allows the Plaintiff to file a first amended complaint.
