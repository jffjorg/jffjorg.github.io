And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the motion of Plaintiffs Del Records Inc., Del Entertainment Inc., Del Publishing Inc., and Jose Angel Del Villar to approve a $1,000.00 bond. The bond is required pursuant to Labor Code section 1700.44(a), which allows for the stay of any award for money. The Labor Commissioner had issued a Determination of Controversy, which did not include an award for money, but instead ordered an accounting of the Plaintiffs' books and records. The Plaintiffs had appealed the determination and initiated a new case, which was consolidated with the original case. The court has approved the bond as requested by the Plaintiffs.
