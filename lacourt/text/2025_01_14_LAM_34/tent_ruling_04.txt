On April 22, 2024, Defendants
Theresa Fiallos and

On September 23, 2024, the court

On November 18, 2024, Plaintiffs’
counsel, Mark
Gomez (“Counsel”), filed respective: (1)
MC-051, Motion to be Relieved as Counsel; (2) MC-052, Declaration in Support of
Motion to be Relieved as Counsel; (3) MC-053, Proposed Order; and (4) Proof of

Legal Standard
 
“The attorney in an action or special
proceeding may be changed at any time before or after judgment or final
determination, as follows: 1. Upon the consent of both client and attorney,
filed with the clerk, or entered upon the minutes; 2. Upon the order of the
court, upon the application of either client or attorney, after notice from one
to the other.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 284.)
 
An attorney moving to be relieved as
counsel under California Code of Civil Procedure section 284(2) must meet the
requirements set out in California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362. 
 
To comply with rule 3.1362, the moving
party must submit the following forms: (1) Notice of Motion and Motion to be
Relieved as Counsel; (2) Declaration in Support of Attorney's Motion to be
Relieved as Counsel; and (3) Order Granting Attorney's Motion to be Relieved as
Counsel. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(a), (c), (e).) 
 
The moving party must serve the
aforementioned forms on the client and all other parties who have appeared in
the case. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(d).) Further, when the client is
served by mail, the attorney's declaration must show that the client's address
was confirmed within the last 30 days and how it was confirmed. (Ibid.)  
 
Absent a showing of resulting
prejudice, an attorney’s request for withdrawal should be granted.  (People v. Prince (1968) 268
Cal.App.2d 398, 406.) 
 
Discussion
 
Counsel’s Motions to be Relieved as
Counsel comply with the requirements of California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362,
in that Counsel provided notices of motion, motions to be relieved as counsel,
declarations in support of the motions to be relieved as counsel, and proposed
orders granting Counsel’s motions.  
 
            The declarations state that an
irreparable breakdown of the attorney-client relationship between Plaintiffs
and Counsel has occurred that makes it impossible for Counsel to continue the representation
of Plaintiffs. (MC-052, ¶ 2.)
 
            The court determines that the
requirements of Rules of Court Rule 3.1362 enumerated above have been
sufficiently met and will grant the requested withdrawals. 
 
Conclusion
 
            Plaintiffs Daniella Fiallos and Caesar
Hernandez ’ Counsel Mark Gomez’ Motions to be Relieved as Counsel are GRANTED, effective
upon the filing of proof of service showing service of the signed orders.
