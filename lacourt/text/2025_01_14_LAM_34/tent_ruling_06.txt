On October
14, 2024, Defendants Clarice Denmion, Shrikant Tamhane, and Hee Sung Kim filed
General Denials to Plaintiff’s complaint. 
 
On October

complaint. On November 1, 2024, Klein filed this Motion to Strike. No
opposition or other responsive pleading has been filed. 
 
1.    
Demurrer 
 
Legal Standard
 
            “The
party against whom a complaint or cross-complaint has been filed may object, by
demurrer or answer as provided in Section 430.30, to the pleading on any one or
more of” various grounds listed in statute. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10.)
 
            When considering demurrers, courts
read the allegations liberally and in context. In a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent
on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial notice. (Donabedian
v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) “A demurrer
tests the pleading alone, and not the evidence or facts alleged.” (E-Fab,
Inc. v. Accountants, Inc. Servs. (2007) 153 Cal.App.4th 1308, 1315.)
As such, the court assumes the truth of the complaint’s properly pleaded or
implied factual allegations. (Ibid.) The only issue a demurrer is
concerned with is whether the complaint, as it stands, states a cause of
action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.)
 
            Where
a demurrer is sustained, leave to amend must be allowed where there is a
reasonable possibility of successful amendment. (Goodman v. Kennedy
(1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.) The burden is on the plaintiff to show the court
that a pleading can be amended successfully. (Id.; Lewis v. YouTube, LLC
(2015) 244 Cal.App.4th 118, 226.) However, “[i]f there is any reasonable
possibility that the plaintiff can state a good cause of action, it is error to
sustain a demurrer without leave to amend.” (Youngman v. Nevada Irrigation
Dist. (1969) 70 Cal.2d 240, 245). 
 
Discussion 
 
            Klein
demurs, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 430.10, subdivisions (e)
and (f), to all causes of action in Plaintiff’s complaint, on the basis that
Plaintiff fails to state facts sufficient to constitute causes of action and
that it is uncertain. 
 
CCP § 430.10(f) – Uncertainty 
 
            Under
Code of Civil Procedure section 430.10, subdivision (f), a demurrer may be
sustained if a complaint is “uncertain.” Uncertainty exists where a complaint’s
factual allegations are confusing and do not sufficiently apprise a defendant
of the issues it is being asked to meet. (Williams v. Beechnut Nutrition
Corp. (1986) 185 Cal.App.3d 135, 139, fn. 2.) “A demurrer for uncertainty
is strictly construed, even where a complaint is in some respects uncertain,
because ambiguities can be clarified under modern discovery procedures.” (Khoury
v. Maly's of California, Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.) “The objection of
uncertainty does not go to the failure to allege sufficient facts.” (Brea v.
McGlashan (1934) 3 Cal.App.2d 454, 459.) “It goes to the doubt as to what
the pleader means by the facts alleged.” (Ibid.) “Such a demurrer should
not be sustained where the allegations of the complaint are sufficiently clear
to apprise the defendant of the issues which he is to meet.” (People v. Lim
(1941) 18 Cal.2d 872, 882.)
 
            Klein
argues that Plaintiff’s complaint is uncertain as to the claims Plaintiff
attempts to assert against Klein. (Demurrer, at p. 3.) Klein contends that as
pled, Plaintiff’s complaint makes it impossible for Klein to assert which
causes of action are alleged against Klein and makes no allegations regarding
Klein’s alleged role in Plaintiff’s tenancy. (Ibid.) Klein argues that
Plaintiff’s complaint lumps all Defendants together failing to differentiate
between the conduct of the numerous Defendants which does not allow for Klein
to reasonably determine what issues must be addressed. (Id., at p. 4.) 
 
            No
opposition has been filed.  
            The
court finds Plaintiff’s complaint is uncertain. Plaintiff’s allegations are
alleged against five different defendants but all under the same 11 general
allegations. (Complaint, ¶¶ 9-20.)  Plaintiff has not identified what causes of
action he is asserting against which Defendant and under which specific
allegations or conduct. Without specific identification of the types of claims
asserted against each Defendant, Klein cannot reasonably determine what issues
must be admitted or denied and respond to the complaint. Additionally,
Plaintiff’s action is brought against Klein both as an individual and as a Trustee
of the Thomas and Gloria Zee Trust. From a review of the complaint, the court
is unable to determine how Klein could be liable for the allegations made or in
what capacity. All causes of action are asserted against all Defendants without
clarifying the role each Defendant had in the alleged harm suffered by
Plaintiff. Accordingly, the demurrer is sustained. Nevertheless, the court
recognizes that such deficiencies in Plaintiff’s complaint are easily remediable
by granting
Plaintiff leave to amend. 
Moreover, as the demurrer
is sustained for uncertainty, the court need not address Klein’s additional
demurring arguments.
2.              
Motion to Strike 
 
Legal Standard
 
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section
436, “the court may, upon a motion made pursuant to Section 435, or at any time
in its discretion, and upon terms it deems proper: (a) Strike out any irrelevant,
false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading. (b) Strike out all or any
part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of this
state, a court rule, or an order of the court.” The grounds for a motion to
strike must “appear on the face of the challenged pleading or from any matter
of which the court is required to take judicial notice.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
437.)
 
Discussion 
 
            In
light of the court’s ruling on Klein’s Demurrer, Klein’s Motion to Strike is
denied as moot.

1.              
Defendant Lisa Klein’s Demurrer to Plaintiff
Radu Vlad’s Complaint is SUSTAINED. 
 
2.              
Defendant Lisa Klein’s Motion to Strike
Portions of Plaintiff Radu Vlad’s Complaint is DENIED as moot.
