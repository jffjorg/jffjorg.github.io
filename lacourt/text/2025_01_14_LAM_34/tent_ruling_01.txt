On May 9, 2019, the court found that

On May 23, 2019, the court

lead case.
On September 11, 2019, the court
overruled Defendants’ Demurrer.
On September 13, 2019, Defendants
filed an answer to Plaintiffs’ complaint. 
On October 10, 2019, the court granted
Plaintiffs’ Motion to Stay the proceedings pending a determination of the
controversy by the Labor Commissioner of issues arising under the Talent Agency
Act. 
On November 4, 2024, the court
consolidated cases 19STCV11614, 19STCV12816, and 24LBCP00341, designating
19STCV11614 as the lead case.

Legal Standard
 
            “In
cases of controversy arising under this chapter, the parties involved
shall refer the matters in dispute to the Labor Commissioner, who shall hear
and determine the same, subject to an appeal within 10 days after
determination, to the superior court where the same shall be heard de novo. To
stay any award for money, the party aggrieved shall execute a bond approved by
the superior court in a sum not exceeding twice the amount of the judgment. In
all other cases the bond shall be in a sum of not less than one thousand
dollars ($1,000) and approved by the superior court.
 
            The
Labor Commissioner may certify without a hearing that there is no controversy
within the meaning of this section if he or she has by investigation
established that there is no dispute as to the amount of the fee due. Service
of the certification shall be made upon all parties concerned by
registered or certified mail with return receipt requested
and the certification shall become conclusive 10 days after the date
of mailing if no objection has been filed with the Labor Commissioner during
that period.” (Cal. Lab. Code § 1700.44(a).)
 
Discussion
Plaintiffs
move the court for an order approving a bond in the amount of $1,000.00
pursuant to Labor Code section 1700.44(a). (Motion, at p. 4.) Plaintiffs
contend that the Labor Commissioner issued a Determination of Controversy of
the Petitions on October 1, 2024. (Ibid.) Plaintiffs then appealed the
determination and initiated case no. 24LBCP00341 on October 11, 2024. (Ibid.)
This court then granted the parties stipulation to consolidate cases 19STCV11614,
19STCV12816, and 24LBCP00341, designating 19STCV11614 as the lead case. (Minute
Order dated November 4, 2024.) Plaintiffs argue that as the Labor
Commissioner’s determination does not include an award for money and instead
orders an accounting of Plaintiffs’ books and records, Plaintiffs now seek the
approval of a bond. (Motion, at p. 4, Exh. A.) 
Plaintiffs motion is unopposed. 
The court grants Plaintiffs request to
approve a $1,000.00 bond as shown in Exhibit A of Plaintiffs’ motion pursuant
to Labor Code section 1700.44(a). 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiffs Del Records Inc., Del Entertainment
Inc., Del Publishing Inc., and Jose Angel Del Villar’s Motion to Approve Bond
is GRANTED.
