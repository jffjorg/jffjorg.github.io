And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiffs' motion to compel defendant to produce documents in response to a request for production of documents. The plaintiffs had requested that the defendant produce time records, including rounded time records, which the defendant had not included in its initial production. The defendant had objected to the request, claiming that it was overbroad and unduly burdensome. The judge found that the plaintiffs' motion was untimely, as it was filed more than 45 days after the defendant had provided its verified response. The judge noted that the defendant had produced time records, but not rounded time records, and that the plaintiffs had not met and conferred with the defendant to resolve the dispute before filing the motion.
