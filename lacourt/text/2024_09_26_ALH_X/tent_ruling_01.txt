  Case Number:  23AHCV00745    Hearing Date:   September 26, 2024    Dept:  X PLAINTIFF'S MOTIONS (4) TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES TO DISCOVERYPlaintiff moves to compel further responses to her form interrogatories,
requests for admissions, special interrogatories, and requests to produce
documents.
 
Plaintiff’s unopposed motions to
compel further responses are GRANTED. 
Sanctions are also awarded to Plaintiff in the amount of $800.00.
 
This
case arises out of Plaintiff’s claim that Defendant Modern Shaman, LLC failed
to design, construct, maintain, and operate its website to be fully accessible
to and independently usable by blind and visually impaired people.  Plaintiff alleges she is a visually impaired
and legally blind person who requires screen-reading software to read website
content while using a computer. 
 
On receipt of a
response to discovery requests, and pursuant to the Code of Civil Procedure, the
party requesting may move for an order compelling further responses to
interrogatories (§ 2030.300), requests for admission (§ 2033.290), and requests
for production (§ 2031.310).
 
Plaintiff served her discovery requests on January 26, 2024.  (Fitzgerald Decl., ¶ 2.)  Defendant served unverified, deficient
responses on June 7, 2024.  (Fitzgerald
Decl., ¶ 4.)  Plaintiff’s counsel sent a meet and confer letter
addressing Defendant’s unverified and deficient responses on June 17, 2024, and
offered additional time to provide verified supplemental responses. (Fitzgerald
Decl., ¶ 5.)  When that failed to
elicit responses, these motions followed. 
 
No oppositions have been filed by Defendant.  Accordingly, Plaintiff’s motion to compel
further responses is granted as to: (1) special interrogatory nos. 2-18, 20-21,
(2) request to produce documents nos. 1-22, 24, (3) form interrogatory nos. 1.1,
3.3, 15.1, 17.1, and (4) request for admissions nos. 1-2, 15-16, 19, 21-25.  Responses are due within 5 days, by October
1, 2024.
 
Plaintiff also seeks monetary sanctions for each motion to
compel further responses.  The Court
awards total sanctions in the total amount of $800.00 ($200.00 per motion).  Sanctions are awarded against Defendant,
Modern Shaman, LLC, and its counsel of record, Geragos & Geragos, APC,
jointly and severally, in favor of Plaintiff and are due within 30 days of
mailing of the notice of ruling.
 
Moving party is to give notice of the Court’s ruling
personally, electronically, or via overnight delivery.
