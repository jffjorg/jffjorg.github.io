And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the motion to compel arbitration filed by the petitioners and has granted the motion. The petitioners alleged that the respondent, Sega of America, Inc., is a video game development company that illegally targeted them with ads based on their gender and ages in violation of the Unruh Civil Rights Act. The petitioners contend that their claims are covered by the respondent's user agreement, which requires arbitration of disputes over game services.

The respondent opposed the motion, arguing that numerous petitioners are either non-existent or not bona fide players of the respondent's games. However, the court found that the respondent did not meet its burden to rebut the petitioners' evidence.

The court also found that the petitioners presented sufficient rebuttal evidence to demonstrate that an agreement to arbitrate exists. The petitioners submitted declarations from 10,468 petitioners confirming their existence and their standing to assert their claims.

As a result, the court granted the motion to compel arbitration and ordered the moving party to give notice of the ruling.
