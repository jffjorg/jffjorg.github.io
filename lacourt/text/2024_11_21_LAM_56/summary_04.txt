And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case where 19,517 individual petitioners are seeking to compel arbitration against a game company, Respondent. The petitioners filed a petition and included individualized declarations to establish grounds for arbitration. Respondent does not dispute the existence of an End User License Agreement (EULA) to arbitrate disputes, but disputes that all petitioners are bona fide players. The Judge notes that Respondent's reference to an unpublished case, L'Occitane, Inc. v. Simmerman Reed LLP, does not convince the Court otherwise, as the petitioners have included declarations from every petitioner supporting their grounds for arbitration. The Judge will make a final ruling based on this tentative ruling.
