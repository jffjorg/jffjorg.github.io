Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has considered the demurrer filed by the Defendant and the opposition and reply filed by the Plaintiffs. The Court finds that the demurrer is timely and that the Complaint is ambiguous, unintelligible, and uncertain. The Court sustains the demurrer with 30 days leave to amend and grants the Plaintiffs the opportunity to amend the Complaint. The Court warns the Plaintiffs that if they are unable to cure all of the major defects set forth above in a First Amended Complaint, and if the Defendant were to file another demurrer thereto, the Court would be inclined to sustain any such demurrer without leave to amend. The motion to strike is denied as moot since the demurrer has been sustained.
