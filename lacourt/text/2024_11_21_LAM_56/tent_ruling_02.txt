BACKGROUND
This
is a representative action arising from alleged wage and hour violations under
the California Labor Code. Plaintiff commenced this action against Defendants
Visual Data Media Services, LLC (“VDM”) and DOES 1 to 100, inclusive, for civil
penalties under California Labor Code Sections 2698 et seq, the Private
Attorneys General Act of 2004 (“PAGA”) on October 18, 2022. 
The
Complaint alleges Plaintiff was employed by Defendant VDM from September 2021
to December 17, 2021. (Comp., ¶1.) The Complaint further alleges Defendant VDM
failed to pay Plaintiff all wages at the applicable minimum wage for all hours
worked and overtime wages for all overtime hours worked. (Id. at ¶¶9-10,
12, 14, 16.)
 
On
December 22, 2022, Defendant VDM filed its Answer to Complaint. 
            
On
February 10, 2023, the Court issued an order on joint stipulation to stay case
pending the California Supreme Court’s decision in Adolph v. Uber
Technologies, Inc. (Stipulation 02/10/2023.) On July 17, 2023, the Supreme
Court of California issued its decision in Adolph v. Uber Technologies, Inc.
(2023) 14 Cal.5th 1104.
 
On
November 2, 2023, the Court granted Defendant VDM’s motion for stay of
proceedings pending arbitration of Plaintiff’s individual PAGA claims. 
 
On
August 23, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant motion for approval of PAGA
settlement. The motion is unopposed.      
 
DISCUSSION
            The Private Attorneys General Act is
“a procedural statute allowing an aggrieved employee to recover civil
penalties—for Labor Code violations—that otherwise would be sought by state
labor law enforcement agencies.”  (Amalgamated
Transit Union, Local 1756, AFL-CIO v. Superior Court (2009) 46 Cal.4th 993,
1003.)  The statute provides a mechanism
for private enforcement of Labor Code violations for the public benefit.  (See Arias v. Superior Court (2009) 46
Cal.4th 969, 986.) The statute incentivizes aggrieved employees by providing 25
percent of the recovered civil penalties, while the remaining 75 percent is
distributed to the Labor and Workforce Development Agency (LWDA) “for
enforcement of labor laws…and for education of employers and employees about
their rights and responsibilities under [the Labor Code].”  (Lab. Code, § 2699, subd. (m) formerly
cited as Lab. Code, § 2699, subd. (i).) 

 
            “The superior court shall review and
approve any settlement of any civil action filed pursuant to this part [Labor
Code Private Attorneys General Act of 2004].” (Lab. Code, § 2699, subd. (s)(2) formerly
cited as Lab. Code, § 2699, subd. (l)(2).) 
 
            “[A] trial court should evaluate a
PAGA settlement to determine whether it is fair, reasonable, and adequate in
view of PAGA’s purposes to remediate present labor law violations, deter future
ones, and to maximize enforcement of state labor laws.”  (Moniz v. Adecco USA, Inc. (2021) 72
Cal.App.5th 56, 77.) A court should consider factors used in evaluating class
action settlements, such as the strength of the plaintiff’s case, the risk, the
stage of the proceeding, the complexity and likely duration of further
litigation, and the settlement amount. (Ibid.) Other factors that may be
useful in determining fairness include whether (1) the settlement is the result
of arm’s length bargaining, (2) investigation and discovery are sufficient to
allow counsel and the court to act intelligently, (3) counsel is experienced in
similar litigation, and (4) the percentage of objectors is small.  (Nordstrom Com. Cases (2010) 186
Cal.App.4th 576, 581; Wershba v. Apple Computer, Inc. (2001) 91
Cal.App.4th 224, 245.)  In considering
the amount of settlement, the court is mindful that compromise is inherent and
necessary in the settlement process.  (Wershba,
supra, 91 Cal.App.4th at p. 250.) 
 
 
 
PAGA Settlement
            Plaintiff moves for an order
approving the proposed settlement on the terms and conditions set forth in the
PAGA Settlement Agreement (“Settlement Agreement”) between Plaintiff and
Defendant VDM. (Tran Decl., 19, Ex. 1.) The “settlement class” consists of 93
aggrieved employees. (Id. at ¶29.) The breakdown of the proposed
Settlement agreement is as follows:
Gross Settlement Amount:                                                     $134,250.00
            Plaintiff’s Counsel’s
Fees:                                                      $44,745.53 (33.333%)
            Plaintiff’s Counsel’s
Litigation Costs:                                   $10,000.00
            Plaintiff’s Service
Award:                                                      $1,000.00
            Settlement
Administration Costs:                                           $2,850.00
            Net Settlement Amount
(PAGA Penalties):                           $75,654.47
 
            PAGA Penalties:                                                                    $75,654.47
            Labor Workforce
Development Agency (75%):                    $56,740.85
            Aggrieved Employees
(25%):                                                $18,913.62
            
Service on the Labor and Workforce Development Agency
(“LWDA”)
            First, Plaintiff has attached the
email response from the LWDA confirming receipt of the proposed Settlement
Agreement on July 31, 2024, in compliance with Labor Code Section 2699, subdivision (s)(2).
(Tran Decl., ¶¶72, 75, Ex. 3.)
 
Fair, Reasonable & Adequate
            Next,
the parties engaged in an arms’ length settlement negotiations and mediation on
March 28, 2024 before ultimately reaching the Settlement Agreement at issue.
(Tran Decl., ¶¶16, 20-21.) Prior to mediation, the parties exchanged informal discovery,
which revealed Defendant VDM employed approximately 93 aggrieved employees
during 3,385 pay periods (“PAGA Period”). (Id. at ¶29.) This information
allowed Plaintiff to assess the maximum value of the PAGA claims to be
approximately $1,350,900.00. (Mot. at 8:13-15.) However, Plaintiff and her
counsel concede given the state of the case law in this area and Defendant
VDM’s purported compliance with Labor Code, the valuation used in Carrington
v. Starbucks (2018) 30 Cal.App.5th 504 could make Defendant VDM’s maximum
exposure only $338,500.00. (Tran Decl., ¶43.) Also, Plaintiff contends the
prospect of a potential summary adjudication ruling, defenses to the case,
potential appeal, and potential costs could be forced upon her if not
successful in litigating this matter. (Id. at ¶45.)
 
As such, Plaintiff has
demonstrated the overall proposed Settlement Agreement is fair, reasonable and
adequate to all concerned parties and is not the product of fraud collusion or
overreaching. 
 
Experience of Counsel
            Moreover,
William Tran attests to his and his firm’s experience in wage/hour class
actions on both the state and federal level since 2022. (Tran Decl.,¶5.)
Specifically, Counsel Tran avers to having been involved in numerous cases from
pre-filing to settlement including PAGA representative actions like the instant
case. (Id.) Likewise, Counsel Tran attests to the experience of the
partner assigned to this case, Joseph Lavi having been involved in several
class actions since 2000 with large settlements such as $6,510,000.00 in a case
against Kaiser Permanente. (Id. at ¶¶6-8.)
 
            Thus,
Plaintiff has shown her counsel was experienced in the matters of this case
including settlement. 
 
Attorney’s Fees and Litigation Costs
            Furthermore,
Counsel Tran seeks $44,745.53 in fees and litigation costs not to exceed
$10,000.00. Labor Code Section 2699, subdivision (k)(1) provides “[a]ny
employee who prevails in any action shall be entitled to an award of reasonable
attorney’s fees and costs . . . .” (Lab. Code, § 2699, subd. (k)(1) formerly
cited as Lab. Code, § 2699, subd. (g)(1).) As discussed above, Plaintiff is
represented by experienced counsel and the fees requested make up only 33.333%
of the gross settlement. As to the costs, Counsel Tran avers to incurring
$8,953.67 in costs so far related to filing motions, responses to pleadings,
court appearances, expert witnesses, depositions, and mediation, which is less
than the agreed upon amount of $10,000.00. 
 
            Therefore,
the Court awards the requested attorney’s fees and costs in the amount of
$8,953.67. 
 
Plaintiff’s Service Award
            Similarly,
Plaintiff requests $1,000.00 as a service award for her time and effort exerted
on behalf of the aggrieved employees. (Tran Decl., ¶71.) Specifically,
Plaintiff searched for and provided information related to her employment and
employment conditions to counsel; spent time in meeting with counsel discussing
her work environment and requirements; made herself available for mediation;
and reviewing and approving the proposed settlement. (Id.) 
 
            Given
the original net settlement amount for the entire class is $18,913.62, the Court finds that a $1,000.00 service award for time and
effort expended by Plaintiff in this action is reasonable under the
circumstances. 
 
Settlement Administration Costs
            Likewise,
the parties agreed to engage ILYM Group, Inc. (“ILYM”) as the third-party
settlement administrator and requests court approval of $2,850.00 for
administrator costs. (Tran Decl., ¶70, Ex. 8 – Lisa Mullins Declaration.) ILYM
will provide a mailing address and toll-free telephone number to receive
correspondence and inquiries from aggrieved employees. (Mullins Decl., ¶4.)
ILYM will upload the data file, which contains the aggrieved employees’ names,
last known addresses, and social security numbers to check for duplicates and
other discrepancies. (Id.) ILYM will also process this information
against the National Change of Address database and update accordingly before
preparing, administrating, and distributing the settlement checks. (Id.
at ¶¶5-6.) ILYM further attaches the initial quote for its services (Id.,
Ex. C.) The estimated quote reflects the amount requested, thus the Court
approves the settlement administrator costs in the amount of $2,850.00. 
 
Release
Finally, the release under the
Settlement Agreement is fair and reasonable. Plaintiff’s release states: “Plaintiff and his or her respective former and present spouses,
representatives, agents, attorneys (including PAGA Counsel), heirs,
administrators, trustees, executors, successors, and assigns generally release
and discharge Released Parties, and each of them, from any and all claims,
transactions, or occurrences that occurred during the PAGA Period, including,
but not limited to: (a) all claims that were, or reasonably could have been,
alleged, based on the facts and allegations contained in the Operative Complaint
and the PAGA Notice (Plaintiff’s Release). Plaintiff’s Release does not extend
to any claims or actions to enforce this Agreement, or to any claims for vested
benefits, unemployment benefits, disability benefits, social security benefits,
workers’ compensation benefits that arose at any time, or based on occurrences
outside the PAGA Period. Plaintiff acknowledges that Plaintiff may discover
facts or law different from, or in addition to, the facts or law that Plaintiff
now knows or believes to be true but agrees, nonetheless, that Plaintiff’s
Release shall be and remain effective in all respects, notwithstanding such
different or additional facts or Plaintiff’s discovery of them.” (Tran Decl.,
¶19, Ex. 1 – Settlement Agreement ¶5.1.)
 
            Therefore, the Court GRANTS
Plaintiff Teresa R. Fleming’s motion for approval of PAGA settlement. 
 
Moving
Party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.            
 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed
by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive an email
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off
calendar.
