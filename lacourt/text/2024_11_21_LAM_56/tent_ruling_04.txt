[1] According to the initially-filed
Petition, there are 19,517 individual petitioners. (Pet., ¶3.) On October 30,
2024, Petitioners filed a request for dismissal of Petitioners See Mee,
Alejandro Ramos, Hector Sanchez and Poop Smear, which the court entered. These
few individuals are identified in the Opposition as ones with “patently absurd
names.” (Opp., at p. 6:18.)


[2] Mr. Weir also attaches the End User License Agreement dated May 2, 2024,
and proactively argues it is inapplicable given the time frame of the
Petitioners’ play. (Weir Decl., ¶4 and Ex. B.) Respondent does not contend that
the 2024 Agreement covers the dispute between it and any of the Petitioners. “[Respondent]  does not dispute that its EULA creates an
enforceable agreement to arbitrate disputes between itself and players of its
games. What [Respondent] disputes is that all 19,517 Petitioners are bona fide
players.” (Opp., at pp. 9:27-10:01; see also Opp. at p. 4:08-10 [defining EULA
as the 2021 Agreement].)


[3] Respondent’s reference to the unpublished, nonbinding case of L’Occitane, Inc. v. Simmerman Reed LLP (2024) 2024 WL 2227182 (“L’Occitane”) does not convince the Court otherwise. In L’Occitane, the court concluded that the plaintiffs’ failure to include any
declarations that they had made purchases on the L’Occitane website or even visited the website meant they could not establish by
a preponderance of the evidence that they could compel arbitration. Here,
Petitioners have included an individualized declaration from every Petitioner
supporting that they have grounds to compel arbitration.
