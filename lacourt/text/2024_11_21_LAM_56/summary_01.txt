Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the motions filed by the plaintiffs to compel the deposition of Xiang Hao Cui and production of documents, and to compel the deposition of the person most qualified and production of documents. The plaintiffs have alleged that the defendants failed to produce requested documents and have moved for an order compelling their production.

The court finds that good cause exists to compel the production of the requested documents. The court notes that Xiang Hao Cui testified that he has responsive documents, including a copy of the signed purchase agreement and emails related to the subject premises. The court also finds that Defendant CIL failed to timely object to the deposition notice and failed to produce the requested documents.

The court grants the motions and orders Defendant Cui to produce the requested documents and to appear for a further session of his deposition. The court also orders Defendant CIL to produce its person most qualified and the requested documents for deposition.

Additionally, the court awards monetary sanctions against Defendant CIL in the amount of $1,297.50, to be paid to the plaintiffs within 20 days of the date of this order.

The court also notes that the parties who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the court as directed by the instructions provided on the court website.
