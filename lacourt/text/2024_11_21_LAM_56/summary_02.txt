And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has considered the moving papers and is granting the motion for approval of the PAGA settlement. The settlement agreement is fair, reasonable, and adequate to all concerned parties. The agreement provides for a gross settlement amount of $134,250.00, with $44,745.53 going to Plaintiff's counsel and $10,000.00 to Plaintiff's counsel's litigation costs. The settlement also includes a service award of $1,000.00 to Plaintiff and settlement administration costs of $2,850.00.

The Court finds that the release under the settlement agreement is fair and reasonable, and the agreement does not extend to any claims or actions to enforce this agreement or to any claims for vested benefits, unemployment benefits, disability benefits, social security benefits, workers' compensation benefits that arose at any time, or based on occurrences outside the PAGA period.

The Court awards the requested attorney's fees and costs in the amount of $8,953.67. The Court also approves the settlement administrator costs in the amount of $2,850.00.
