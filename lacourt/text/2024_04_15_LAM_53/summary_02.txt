And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has denied the plaintiff's ex parte application for an order shortening time for the hearing on their motion for court order compelling production of a written report. The court found that the plaintiff failed to make an affirmative factual showing of irreparable harm or immediate danger, as required by California Rules of Court. The court also denied the request to prescribe shorter times for the filing and service of papers. The court has ordered the parties' counsel to meet and confer to informally resolve the issue presented in the plaintiff's motion. The court has also ordered the plaintiff to give notice of this order.
