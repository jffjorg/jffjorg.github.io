And here is the English text summary:

The judge denied the plaintiff's motion for an order appointing a neutral to conduct the dissolution of Ocean Front Urgent Care P.C. The plaintiff, Jesika Yeroomian, argued that she had standing to bring the motion as a 50% owner of the corporation and as a creditor. However, the court found that the plaintiff did not have standing to bring the motion under Corporations Code sections 1904 and 1805. Even if the plaintiff had standing, the court found that she did not show that justice, equity, or good cause warranted the appointment of a neutral. The court also noted that the plaintiff did not present admissible evidence establishing that the defendant, Dr. Mostafa Rahimi, engaged in financial fraud or improperly took the corporation's assets.
