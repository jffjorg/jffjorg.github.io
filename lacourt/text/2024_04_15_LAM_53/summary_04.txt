And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling is a decision by Judge Robert B. Broadbelt III regarding a motion by plaintiff Romana Ortiz to set aside the dismissal of the action and reinstate the case. The plaintiff's counsel, Roger Haag, failed to file a Notice of Settlement, which resulted in the dismissal of the case. The court finds that the dismissal was caused by Haag's mistake, inadvertence, surprise, and neglect, but the motion is not in proper form because it did not include a copy of the proposed Notice of Settlement. The court continues the hearing to April 29, 2024, to allow the plaintiff to file a copy of the proposed Notice of Settlement.
