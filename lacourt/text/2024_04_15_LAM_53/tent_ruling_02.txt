 Case Number:  21STCV23853    Hearing Date:   April 15, 2024    Dept:  53 Garcia v. Lance Camper Mfg.
Corp.  21STCV23853 
Ex
Parte Application   4/15/24
The
court finds that plaintiff has not satisfied the requirement of California Rules
of Court, rule 3.1202, subdivision (c), that an applicant for an ex parte order
must make an affirmative factual showing in a declaration containing competent
testimony based on personal knowledge of irreparable harm, immediate danger, or
other statutory basis for granting relief ex parte.  
The
court does not find good cause to grant plaintiff’s request for an order
shortening time on the hearing on plaintiff’s motion for court order compelling
production of written report of Dr. Judy Ho pursuant to CCP § 2032.610 or to
prescribe shorter times for the filing and service of papers than the times
specified in Code of Civil Procedure section 1005, subdivision (b).  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1300, subd. (b).)
The
court therefore denies plaintiff’s ex parte application without prejudice to
seeking other appropriate relief, including filing an ex parte application to
continue trial and advance the hearing on plaintiff’s motion for court order
compelling production of written report of Dr. Judy Ho pursuant to CCP §
2032.610 based on regular notice.  
The
court orders plaintiff’s and defendant’s counsel to meet and conder no later
than April 16, 2024, to make a reasonable and good faith effort to informally
resolve the issue presented in plaintiff’s motion for court order compelling
production of written report of Dr. Judy Ho pursuant to CCP § 2032.610.  
The court
orders plaintiff to give notice of this order.
