And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge denied the defendant's motion to bifurcate the trial on the issue of licensure. The defendant had argued that if the plaintiffs were found to be unlicensed, all of their claims would fail, and therefore bifurcating the trial would be efficient and in the interests of judicial economy. However, the judge found that bifurcating the trial would actually lengthen the trial and would not promote judicial efficiency or economy. The judge also considered the plaintiffs' argument that if the court finds that the plaintiffs were properly licensed, the parties may call the same witnesses to testify in the second phase of the trial. The judge therefore denied the defendant's motion and ordered the plaintiffs and cross-defendants to give notice of this ruling.
