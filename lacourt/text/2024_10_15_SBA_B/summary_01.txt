And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is inclined to grant the petition to approve the compromise of the pending action on behalf of minor claimant Brody Kleinman. The compromise was reached between Brody and the defendant, We Rock The Spectrum Kid's Gym LLC, for $37,500. The settlement amount will be distributed as follows: $0 for medical expenses, $9,375 in attorney's fees, $3,972 in attorney expenses, and the balance of $24,153 to be invested in a single-premium deferred annuity subject to withdrawal only on authorization of the court. The judge finds that the settlement terms are fair and reasonable and that there is good cause to dispense with the appearance of the minor at the hearing due to his age and the amount in settlement.
