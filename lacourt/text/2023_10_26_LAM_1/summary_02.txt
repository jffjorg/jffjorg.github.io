And here is the summary in English text:

**Tentative Ruling:** The motion to transfer venue is denied.

The Court took judicial notice of various geographical facts and found that the parties failed to provide sufficient evidence to establish the proper filing location under Los Angeles Superior Court Local Rule 2.3(a)(1)(A). The parties were required to submit a supplemental declaration identifying the location of the collision and whether it occurred north or south of Manchester Avenue. However, they failed to do so in a timely manner. As a result, they failed to meet their burden as the moving parties to establish the proper filing location.

The Court notes that the Los Angeles Superior Court is only one court, despite being divided into districts. Therefore, there is no impediment to the case continuing in the Inglewood Courthouse where it is presently assigned.
