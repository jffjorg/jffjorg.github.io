 Case Number:  23TRCV00031    Hearing Date:   October 26, 2023    Dept:  1 23TRCV00031           CHERIDA
ABRAM vs HECTOR MORENO
Joint Motion [to] Transfer Venue
TENTATIVE RULING:       The
motion is DENIED.
On September 28, 2023, Department 1 issued an order on the
parties’ motion to transfer and continued the hearing to October 26, 2023.
In that order, which is hereby incorporated by reference,
the Court took judicial notice of various geographical facts and found the
parties failed to provide sufficient evidence to establish the proper filing
location under Los Angeles Superior Court Local Rule 2.3(a)(1)(A). The Court
continued the hearing to provide the parties an opportunity to respond to the
Court’s judicial notice pursuant to Evidence Code section 455(a) and “to submit
a supplemental declaration which more specifically identifies the location of
the collision and whether it occurred north or south of Manchester Avenue.” 
The Court’s order required the parties to submit their
supplemental declaration “no later than October 16, 2023.”
The parties did not timely file any supplemental documents.
Accordingly, the parties failed to meet their burden as the moving parties to
establish the proper filing location. 
The Los Angeles Superior Court is only one court, even
though it is divided into districts. (See generally Glade v. Glade (1995) 38
Cal.App.4th 1441, 1449 (“Even though a superior court is divided into branches
or departments, pursuant to California Constitution, article VI, section 4,
there is only one superior court in a county and jurisdiction is therefore
vested in that court, not in any particular judge or department. Whether
sitting separately or together, the judges hold but one and the same court.”).)
Accordingly, nothing prevents the case from continuing in the Inglewood
Courthouse where it is presently assigned.
