**Significant Statements**

"The constant suer becomes a serious problem to others than the defendant he dogs. By clogging court calendars, he causes real detriment to those who have legitimate controversies to be determined, and to the taxpayers who must provide the courts." - Taliaferro v. Hoogs, (1965) 237 Cal.App.2d 73, 74
"A party who repeatedly files baseless actions only to dismiss them is no less vexatious than the party who follows the actions through to completion. The difference is one of degree, not kind." - Tokerud v. Capitolbank Sacramento, (1995) 38 Cal.App.4th 775, 779
