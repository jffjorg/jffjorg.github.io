[1] Although
Defendant appears to argue that the purpose of the wall was to contain the
roots of the tree, maintain drainage, and prevent damage from the tree roots to
the adjacent building, Defendant does not establish an absence of a triable
issue of fact that it was not reasonably foreseeable that children would run
and play in that area in front of the school. (Motion at p. 7.) Similarly,
Defendantâ€™s evidence that students were dismissed in front of the school to an
authorized adult does not establish an absence of a triable issue of fact
regarding foreseeability. (Motion at p. 10.)
