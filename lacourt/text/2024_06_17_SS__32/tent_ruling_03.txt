Motion
  for Judgment on the Pleadings   




MOVING PARTY:


Defendant Los Angeles County Metropolitan
  Transportation Authority 




OPPOSING PARTY:


Plaintiff
  Enrique Garcia Pina



 
 
BACKGROUND
 
On
July 5, 2022, Plaintiff Enrique Garcia Pina (“Plaintiff”) filed a
complaint against Defendant Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation
Authority (“Defendant”) for injuries sustained on his bicycle. Plaintiff
alleges the injury took place on June 22, 2021. On September 19, 2022,
Defendant filed an answer. 
 
However, on September 7, 2022, Plaintiff filed a Petition for Order
from Relief from Claim Statute. This was assigned case number 22STCV29193. The
petition sought relief from the claims statute for Plaintiff’s claim that
accrued on June 22, 2021. This case was assigned to Department 30 in the Spring
Street Courthouse. Defendant filed an opposition on November 2, 2022. 
 
On December 11, 2023, Defendant filed a notice of related case in
department 32 for 22STCV29193. However, this was rejected because there was no
notice of related case filed in 22STCV29193. (Notice of Rejection, 12/11/23.) 
 
On March 6, 2024, Department 30 denied Plaintiff’s petition for
relief. 
 
In this Court, Defendant now moves for judgment on the pleadings,
arguing that after the ruling in Department 30, Plaintiff’s complaint fails to
state facts to constitute a cause of action. Plaintiff opposes and Defendant
replies. 
 
Since the filing of this motion, both cases are now pending in
Department 32. On June 11, 2024, the Court denied Plaintiff’s motion for relief
from the March 6, 2024 denial and the complaint in case number 22STCV29193 was
dismissed with prejudice. (Min. Order, 6/11/24.)
 
 
LEGAL
STANDARD 
 
The standard for ruling on a motion for judgment on the
pleadings is essentially the same as that applicable to a general demurrer,
that is, under the state of the pleadings, together with matters that may be
judicially noticed, it appears that a party is entitled to judgment as a matter
of law.  (Bezirdjian v. O'Reilly (2010) 183 Cal.App.4th 316, 321-322,
citing Schabarum v. California Legislature (1998) 60 Cal.App.4th 1205, 1216.) 
Matters which are subject to mandatory judicial notice may be treated as part
of the complaint and may be considered without notice to the parties. Matters
which are subject to permissive judicial notice must be specified in the notice
of motion, the supporting points and authorities, or as the court otherwise
permits. (Id.) The motion may not be supported by extrinsic evidence. (Barker
v. Hull (1987) 191 Cal.App.3d 221, 236.) 
 
When the moving party is a defendant, he must demonstrate
either of the following exist:  
                                           
i.The court has no jurisdiction of the subject of the cause of
action alleged in the complaint.  
 
                                         
ii.The complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a
cause of action against that defendant. (Code Civ. Proc., § 438, subd.
(c)(1)(B)(i)-(ii).)   
 
“[I]n order for judicial
notice to support a motion for judgment on the pleadings by negating an express
allegation of the pleading, the notice must be of something that cannot
reasonably be controverted…The same is true of evidentiary admissions or
concessions.” (Columbia Casualty Co. v. Northwestern Nat. Ins. Co.
(1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 457, 468.)   
 
MEET
AND CONFER
 
A
motion for judgment on the pleadings must be accompanied by a meet and confer
declaration demonstrating an attempt to meet and confer in person or by
telephone, at least five days before the date a motion for judgment on the
pleadings is filed. (Code Civ. Proc., § 439.) Here, the Declaration of Philip
C. Allen states that he emailed a meet and confer letter to Plaintiff’s counsel
discussing this motion, but Plaintiff did not respond. (Allen Decl. ¶ 1.)
Therefore, the meet and confer requirement has been met. 
 
JUDICIAL
NOTICE
 
The
Court on its own takes judicial notice that Defendant is a public entity as
defined by the California Government Code. (Gov. Code § 811.2 [“’Public entity
includes . . . a county city, district, public authority, public agency, and
any other political subdivision or public corporation in the State.”].) The
Court also takes judicial notice of the court record and filings in this case
and case number 22STCV29193. (Evid. Code § 452(d).) 
 
DISCUSSION

 
Government
Claims Act
 
Pursuant to the Government Claims Act, a party with a claim
for damages against a public entity must first timely present the claim
directly with that entity.¿ The party may file a lawsuit only if the public
entity denies or rejects the claim (either expressly or by operation of law).
(Gov. Code §§ 905, 945.4; City of Ontario v. Superior Court (1993) 12
Cal.App.4th 894.)¿ The claims presentation requirement provides the public
entity with an opportunity to evaluate the claim and decide whether to pay on
the claim.¿ (Roberts v. County of Los Angeles (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th
474.)¿¿¿ 
¿ 
A party must file a claim based on “a cause of action for
death or for injury to person” within six months. (Gov. Code, §§ 911.4, 911.2,
subd. (a).) A party may apply for leave to present an untimely claim (Govt.
Code § 911.4), which the board “shall grant or deny … within 45 days after it
is presented to the board. The claimant and the board may extend the period
within which the board is required to act on the application by written
agreement made before the expiration of the period.” (Gov. Code § 911.6(a).)
“The board shall grant the application if one of more of the following is
applicable: (1) The failure to present the claim was through mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect and the public entity was not
prejudiced in its defense of the claim by the failure to present the claim
within the time specified in Section 911.2.” (Gov. Code § 911.6(b).)¿¿  
 
“If the board fails or refuses to act on an application
within the time prescribed by this section, the application shall be deemed to
have been denied on the 45th day or, if the period within which the
board is required to act is extended by agreement pursuant to this section, the
last day of the period specified in the agreement.” (Gov. Code § 911.6(c).) “In
all circumstances, a late claim application is deemed denied after 45 days,
even though section 911.6(b)(2) would entitle the [individual] to relief if the
application had merit. By placing this limitation on the entity’s time to act,
the Legislature ensured that applications would not languish.” (J.M. v.
Huntington Beach Union High School Dist. (2017) 2 Cal.5th 648, 653.) 
 
“If an application for leave to present a claim is denied
or deemed to be denied pursuant to Section 911.6, a petition may be made to the
court for an order relieving the petitioner from Section 945.4.” (Gov. Code §
946.6(a).) The petition shall show each of the following: (1) the application
was denied or deemed denied, (2) the reason for the failure to present a timely
claim, and (3) information required in section 910. (Gov. Code § 946.6(b).)
“The applicant has six months to seek relief in court ‘after the application to
the [entity] is denied or deemed to be denied.’ The six-month period
‘operates as a statute of limitations. It is mandatory, not discretionary.’” (J.M.,
supra, 2 Cal.5th at 653 (alterations and emphasis in original, citations
omitted).) 
 
Analysis
 
Here Defendant argues that Plaintiff failed to present a timely tort
claim within six months after the date of the accident. Plaintiff ultimately
filed a petition with the Court for relief on September 7, 2022. However,
because the petition was not filed in the instant case, it was assigned a new
case number (22STCV29193). On March 6, 2024, Department 30 denied Plaintiff’s
petition, finding that Plaintiff did not address whether the late claim was
made in a reasonable time and did not meet his burden in showing excusable
neglect. (See 22STCV29193, Min. Order, 3/6/24.) 
 
Plaintiff argues there is no basis for determining the two cases are
related. (Opp., 1.)  However, based on
Plaintiff’s petition, these cases stem from the same plaintiff and the same
injury that occurred on June 22, 2021. Plaintiff’s petition also admitted that
a timely claim was not presented to Defendant within six months after the
accident.[1] Plaintiff
fails to point to any document subject to judicial notice that the claim was
timely filed.  
 
Additionally, Plaintiff’s motion for relief from the March 6, 2024
denial was denied on June 11, 2024 and the complaint in case number 22STCV29193
was dismissed with prejudice. 
 
Therefore, because the record shows that Plaintiff did not timely file
a claim, and his petition for relief was denied, the action is barred under
Government Code section 911.4. 
 
 
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
 
Accordingly, Defendant Los
Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority’s motion for judgment on the pleadings is GRANTED without leave to
amend. 
 
Defendant shall give notice of
the Court’s order and file a proof of service of such.
