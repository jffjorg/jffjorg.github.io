As for the English text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that Plaintiff Michele A. Dobson's Motion for Leave to File a First Amended Complaint is placed off calendar as moot. The Plaintiff originally filed a complaint for breach of contract against the Defendants, but a conditional settlement was reached. The Plaintiff then filed a motion to file a First Amended Complaint, citing the Defendant's breach of the settlement agreement. However, the Judge rules that the Plaintiff does not need to file a First Amended Complaint because the case has settled and no responsive pleadings have been filed.
