And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge's tentative ruling continues the motion to attach the wage earnings and other assets of Rotha Valdovinos, wife of defendant Cristian Valdovinos, to July 16, 2024, at 10:00 am in Department 26 of the Spring Street Courthouse. By July 1, 2024, the judgment creditor, Westlake Services, LLC, must file and serve a supplemental declaration demonstrating which earnings or assets are to be withheld. The court finds that Rotha Valdovinos is a spouse of Cristian Valdovinos and that an earnings withholding order may be issued against her earnings. However, the motion does not demonstrate that Rotha has earnings or other assets to withhold.
