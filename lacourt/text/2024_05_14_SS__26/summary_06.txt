And here is the English summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The court has denied the defendant's motion to dismiss the lawsuit due to the five-year deadline for bringing the case to trial. The lawsuit was filed on September 21, 2018, and the court ruled that the plaintiff's appeals did not affect the deadline for bringing the case to trial. The court took into account the COVID-19 pandemic and the extension of the deadline by six months. The defendant argued that the plaintiff's appeals stayed the proceedings, but the court ruled that the appeals did not affect the deadline for bringing the case to trial. The court recognized that the plaintiff's opposition was served late, but allowed the defendant to make a substantive reply.
