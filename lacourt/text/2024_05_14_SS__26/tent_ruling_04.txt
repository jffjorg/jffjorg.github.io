 Case Number:  23STLC06575    Hearing Date:   May 14, 2024    Dept:  26  Dobson v. Sunnyside Up Adventures, et al.LEAVE
TO AMEND PLEADING(CCP §§ 473(a), 576; CRC Rule 3.1324)
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Plaintiff Michele A. Dobson’s
Motion for Leave to File a First Amended Complaint is PLACED OFF CALENDAR AS
MOOT.
 
 
ANALYSIS:
 
Plaintiff Michele
A. Dobson (“Plaintiff”) filed the instant action for breach of contract against
Defendants Sunnyside Up Adventures, Bianka Brunson, Sabreen Wilkes, and Farmers
Insurance Exchange (“Defendants”) on October 13, 2023. On December 27, 2023, Plaintiff
filed a Notice of Settlement indicating that the action had settled
conditionally. 
 
Plaintiff filed
the instant Motion for Leave to File a First Amended Complaint on March 7,
2024. No opposition has been filed to date. 
 
Discussion
 
The Complaint alleges a single cause of action for breach of contract
based on Defendants’ failure to pay for legal services provided by Plaintiff.
(Compl., ¶¶15-19.)  Plaintiff now
moves for leave to file a First Amended Complaint on the grounds that
Defendants have breached the settlement agreement by depositing a check that
was not endorsed by her. The Motion is brought under Code of Civil Procedure
section 473, subdivision (a) and section 576. However, it also points out that
under Code of Civil Procedure section 472, “[a] party may amend its pleading
once without leave of the court at any time before the answer, demurrer, or
motion to strike is filed . . . .” Here, no responsive pleadings have been
filed such that leave of court is not required before Plaintiff files a First
Amended Complaint. 
 
Conclusion
 
Therefore, Plaintiff Michele A.
Dobson’s Motion for Leave to File a First Amended Complaint is PLACED OFF
CALENDAR AS MOOT.
 
 
Court clerk to give notice.
