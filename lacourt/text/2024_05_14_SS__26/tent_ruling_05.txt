ANALYSIS:
 
On December 14, 2023, Plaintiff Michael Long (“Plaintiff”)
filed the instant action against Defendants Pacific Coast Taco, Inc. (“Defendant
PCT”) and Nader Ashoori (“Defendant Ashoori”). When Defendants failed to file a
responsive pleading, Plaintiff obtained their default on February 13, 2024 and
default judgment on February 28, 2024. 
 
On April 19, 2024, Defendant Ashoori filed the instant
Motion to Vacate Default and Default Judgment. No opposition has been filed to
date. 
 
Discussion
 
Jodi Pais Montgomery and David Berrent, Temporary
Co-Conservators of the Estate and Person for Nader Ashoori and Temporary
Co-Trustees of the Nader Ashoori Trust, dated March 23, 2009, as amended and
restated (“Moving Parties”), move to vacate the entry of default
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b) and (d), and
section 473.5. 
 
Under Code of Civil
Procedure section 473, subdivision (b), an application for relief must be made
no more than six months after entry of the order from which relief is sought,
and must be accompanied by an affidavit of fault attesting to the mistake,
inadvertence, surprise or neglect of the moving party or its attorney. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b); English v. IKON Business Solutions (2001)
94 Cal.App.4th 130, 143.) The motion must also be accompanied by a copy of the
moving defendant’s proposed pleading. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b).) This
can be corrected if Defendant submits a proposed responsive pleading by the
hearing date. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b); Carmel, Ltd. v. Tavoussi
(2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 393, 403.) 
 
A request for relief
under the discretionary prong, based on party fault, must not only be made
within six months of entry of default but within a reasonable time. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 473, subd. (b).) The Motion was filed just two months after entry of
default, making its timely. The Motion also attaches a declaration demonstrating
that default was entered due to Defendant Ashoori’s excusable neglect. Specifically,
Moving Parties demonstrate that a conservatorship was established for Defendant
Ashoori on February 20, 2024 in LASC Case No. 24STPB01366. (Motion, Kim Decl.,
Exhs. E-G.) Upon being informed of the conservatorship on February 23, 2024,
Plaintiff’s counsel suggested stipulating to vacate the entry of default
against Defendant Ashoori. (Id. at Exh. C.) However, the Court entered
default judgment on February 28, 2024, before the parties had an opportunity to
prepare and file a stipulation. 
 
Finally, the Notice of
Motion indicates that it is accompanied by a proposed answer, but no such
answer is attached to the papers or otherwise filed. Moving Parties are to
submit a copy of the proposed answer by the time of the hearing. As the
requirements for relief from the default under Code of Civil Procedure section
473, subdivision (b) have been demonstrated, the Motion is granted.
 
Conclusion
 
Motion of Jodi Pais
Montgomery and David Berrent, Temporary Co-Conservators of the Estate and
Person for Nader Ashoori and Temporary Co-Trustees of the Nader Ashoori Trust,
dated March 23, 2009, as amended and restated, to Vacate Default and Default
Judgment Against Defendant Nader Ashoori is GRANTED. THE DEFAULT ENTERED ON
FEBRUARY 13, 2024 AND THE DEFAULT JUDGMENT ENTERED ON FEBRUARY 28, 2024 ARE
HEREBY VACATED.
 
 
Moving party to give notice.
