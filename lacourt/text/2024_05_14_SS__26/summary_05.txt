And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants the motion to vacate the default and default judgment against Defendant Nader Ashoori. The default was entered due to excusable neglect, as Defendant Ashoori's conservatorship was established on February 20, 2024, and Plaintiff's counsel suggested stipulating to vacate the default judgment. The motion was timely filed, and the requirements for relief from the default under Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b) have been demonstrated. The default entered on February 13, 2024, and the default judgment entered on February 28, 2024, are hereby vacated.
