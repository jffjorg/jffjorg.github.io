Williams
v. Hodge, Sr., et al.MOTION TO DISMISS FOR FAILURE TO
PROSECUTE(CCP §§ 583.310(a), 583.360(a)(2))
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Delbert Lindsey Hodge, Sr.’s Motion to Dismiss Action is
DENIED.
 
 
ANALYSIS:
 
On September 21, 2018, Plaintiff
Brian Williams (“Plaintiffs”) filed this action against
Defendant Delbert Lindsey Hodge, Sr. (“Defendant Hodge, Sr.”) and others. The
case was originally assigned to a personal injury courtroom and then
transferred to an independent calendar courtroom. (Minute Order, 09/23/20.)
Proofs of service of the Summons and Complaint were filed in October 2021. From
early 2022 to mid-2023, Defendants filed challenges to the pleadings, including
the Second and Third Amended Complaints. On May 11, 2023, the Court sustained
Defendants’ demurrer to the non-negligence causes of action without leave to
amend and set an order to show cause why the action should not be reclassified
to a court of limited jurisdiction. (Minute Order, 05/11/23.) On June 27, 2023,
the case was reclassified and transferred to the limited jurisdiction court. 
 
On August 2, 2023, Plaintiff filed
a Notice of Stay of Proceedings based on a writ of mandate filed on July 25,
2023 with respect to the reclassification order. Defendant filed an answer to
the Third Amended Complaint on August 10, 2023. On September 8, 2023, Plaintiff
filed another Notice of Stay of Proceedings based on an appeal of the court’s
denial of his motion for reconsideration of the order dismissing the Doe
defendants. A notice of default was issued with respect to that appeal on March
22, 2024, followed by a notice of non-compliance on April 19, 2024. 
 
Defendant Hodge, Sr. filed the
instant Motion to Dismiss on April 16, 2024. Plaintiff filed an opposition on
May 1, 2024 and Defendant Hodge, Sr. replied on May 8, 2024. The Court
recognizes that Plaintiff’s opposition was served late but finds Defendant
Hodge, Sr. was able to make a substantive reply. Therefore, the Court will
consider all the papers filed. 
 
Discussion
 
Defendant Hodge moves to dismiss the action pursuant to Code
of Civil Procedure section 583.310 and 583.360, which require that an action be
brought to trial within five years of commencement. 
 
An action which is not brought to trial within the prescribed period must
be dismissed. (§ 583.360, subd. (a).) These requirements are mandatory “and are
not subject to extension, excuse, or exception except as expressly provided by
statute.” (§ 583.360, subd. (b).) The purpose of the five-year dismissal
statute is to prevent the prosecution of stale claims where defendants could be
prejudiced by loss of evidence and diminished memories of witnesses. (Lewis v.
Superior  Court (1985) 175 Cal.App.3d
366, 375, 220 Cal.Rptr. 594.) The statute also protects defendants from the
annoyance of having unmeritorious claims against them unresolved for
unreasonable periods of time. (Ibid.) While the goals of the five-year limit
are somewhat analogous to those underlying statutes of limitation, the
five-year limit involves policy considerations that are somewhat less crucial
because once an action has been filed defendants can take steps to protect
their interests. (General Motors Corp. v. Superior Court of Los Angeles County
(1966) 65 Cal.2d 88, 91, 52 Cal.Rptr. 460, 416 P.2d 492.)
 
(Munoz v. City of
Tracy (2015) 238 Cal.App.4th 354, 358-259.) “In computing the time within
which an action must be brought to trial pursuant to this article, there shall
be excluded the time during which any of the following conditions existed: (a)
The jurisdiction of the court to try the action was suspended; (b) Prosecution
or trial of the action was stayed or enjoined; (c) Bringing the action to
trial, for any other reason, was impossible, impracticable, or futile.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 583.340.) The five-year deadline was extended by six months due
to the COVID-19 pandemic. (Cal. Rules of Court, appen. I, emergency rule
10(a).) 
 
Thie action was
commenced on September 21, 2018. On July 25, 2023—four years, ten months, and
four days later—Plaintiff filed an appeal of the Court’s order reclassifying
the action to the limited jurisdiction court. A notice of stay with respect to
the appeal was filed by Plaintiff on August 2, 2023 but incorrectly referred to
in the docket as a “bankruptcy stay.” That appeal, No. B330457, was closed on
August 2, 2023, with Plaintiff’s petition for review denied on September 27,
2023. Plaintiff filed another appeal on September 8, 2023, designated No.
23APLC00255, which is currently still
pending with the Appellate Division of the Superior Court.  
 
Defendant Hodge
argues that none of these stays have been sanctioned by the Court and in
support of this argument points to the order dated March 14, 2024. In that
order, the Court ruled that the case was stayed in error because there is no
bankruptcy. (Minute Order, 03/14/24.) It is true that there has been no
bankruptcy stay in this action and the designation of any stay as a “bankruptcy
stay” was incorrect. However, the Motion does not discuss the effect of
Plaintiff’s appeals on the time in which the case should be brought to trial.
As pointed out in Plaintiff’s opposition, Code of Civil Procedure section 916
states: “Except as provided in Sections 917.1 to 917.9, inclusive, and in
Section 116.810, the
perfecting of an appeal stays proceedings in the trial court upon the judgment
or order appealed from or upon the matters embraced therein or affected thereby, including enforcement of the judgment or
order, but the trial court may proceed upon any other matter embraced in the
action and not affected by the judgment or order.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 916,
subd. (a) [emphasis added].) 
 
Therefore, the
Motion has not demonstrated that the five-year plus six-month deadline has
passed when taking into account the appeals filed by Plaintiff. 
 
Conclusion
 
Delbert Lindsey Hodge,
Sr.’s Motion to Dismiss Action is DENIED.
 
 
 
Court clerk to give notice.
