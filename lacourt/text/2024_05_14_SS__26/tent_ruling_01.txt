Discussion
 
“An earnings withholding order may not be issued against the
earnings of the spouse of the judgment debtor except by court order upon
noticed motion.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 706.109.) Family Code section 903,
subdivision (a) provides that in the case of a contract, a debt is incurred “at
the time the contract is made” and subdivision (b) provides that in the case of
a tort, a debt is incurred “at the time the tort occurs.” (Fam. Code, § 903,
subds. (a)-(b).) Family Code section 910, subdivision (a) provides that
“[e]xcept as otherwise expressly provided by statute, the community estate is
liable for a debt incurred by either spouse before or during marriage,
regardless of which spouse had the management and control of the property and
regardless of whether one or both spouses are parties to the debt or to a
judgment for the debt.” (Fam. Code, § 910, subd. (a).) 
 
Judgment Creditor
contends that Judgment Debtor is married to Rotha Valdovinos (“Rotha”). Motion, Frischer Decl., ¶2 and Exhs. 1-2.) This
is supported by copies of a grant deed from the Fresno County Recorder
and a property detail report showing a transfer of property to Judgment Debtor
and Rotha as husband and wife in October 2023. (Ibid.) The Court finds
this evidence demonstrates the spousal relationship between Judgment Debtor and
Rotha prior to entry of the judgment in this action, such that an earnings
withholding order may be issued against Rotha’s earnings. However, the Motion
does not demonstrate that Rotha has earnings or other assets to withhold.
