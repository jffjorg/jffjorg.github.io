And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is issuing a tentative ruling regarding a petition filed by the petitioners. The petitioners do not challenge the decision not to conduct an historic review. The court would reach the same decision even if the petition was governed by Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5. The respondents represent that development or participation agreements are a relic of the City's former Redevelopment Agency, which was dissolved in 2011. The respondents also represent that the 52-Unit Development is made up entirely of two-bedroom units, but the court notes that the units in this project may actually be predominately three-bedroom units. The court finds that the unit sizes for the 52-Unit Development differ from the 102-Unit Development. The court takes no position on the City's compliance with CEQA concerning the 102-Unit Development, as this is not at issue in the case. The court's analysis only applies to the 52-Unit Development.
