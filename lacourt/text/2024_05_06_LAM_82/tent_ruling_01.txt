[Tentative] Order Denying Petition for
Writ of Mandate
 
 
INTRODUCTION 
 
            Petitioners
West Adams Heritage Association and Adams Severance Coalition (“Petitioners”) filed
this petition for writ of mandate directing Respondent City of Los Angeles (the
“City”) to set aside its approval of a 52-unit, multi-family residential
apartment building.  (the “52-unit development”
or the “Project”).  This project will be
located at 806 West Adams Boulevard in Los Angeles, California.  The Real Parties in Interest are Robert
Champion, Champion Real Estate Company, and 806 West Adams Property, LLC (the
“Real Parties”).      
 
Previously, the City approved the
Real Parties’ proposed 102-unit development project (the “102-unit
development”), which would be constructed on the parcel at issue in this case
(“Parcel One”) and an adjacent parcel (“Parcel Two”).  Petitioners filed a petition for writ of
mandate; the trial court (Brazile, J.) denied the writ; and the District Court
of Appeal reversed that decision, finding that the City improperly relied on
mitigation measures when concluding that the 102-unit project’s rooftop decks
would not cause significant noise impacts. 
The Real Parties subsequently petitioned for Supreme Court review, which
was granted on November 21, 2023, but the case has been stayed pending the Supreme
Court’s decision in another case.  In
addition, Petitioners filed a second petition for writ of mandate challenging
the City’s approval of the 102-Unit Development (Case Number 22STCP02210),
which also has been stayed.  Accordingly,
it may take many years to resolve the challenges to the 102-unit
development.  
 
In the alternative, the Real Parties
sought approval for the 52-unit development, which would sit on only one parcel
of land.  The City that the project is
statutorily exempt from the California Environmental Quality Act (“CEQA”) under
the exemption for “ministerial” projects, i.e., those in which the staff
exercises no discretion.  Now,
Petitioners challenge that decision, arguing that the City erred in relying on
the ministerial exemption because the project required two discretionary
reviews.  Petitioners also argue that the
Real Parties improperly “segmented” the 52-unit project from the 102-unit
project in order to circumvent CEQA.  The
City and the Real Parties (collectively, “Respondents”) oppose the petition,
arguing that the petition is untimely; the City correctly decided that CEQA was
not triggered by the ministerial project; and Petitioners fail to establish
unlawful piecemealing.  Following a
hearing, the court denied the petition.   


 
BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY
            
            A.        The
102-Unit Development 
 
            In or about 2018, the Real Parties submitted
a proposal to construct the 102-unit development on Parcel One (which is the
site of the 52-unit development) and Parcel Two (which is an adjacent
property).  (See Pet. RJN Exh. G, H and
Oppo. 12-13.)  In February 2020, City
approved discretionary zoning applications for the 102-Unit Development and
concluded that this project was exempt from environmental review pursuant to
the Class 32 urban infill exemption of CEQA. 
(Pet. RJN Exh. H.)  In approving
the 102-Unit Development, City described the project and site as follows: 
 
The proposed
project is located at 758 - 832 West Adams Boulevard & 2610 South Severance
Street and involves the construction and operation of an urban infill
residential development on an approximately 2.8-acre site in the University
Park neighborhood of the South Los Angeles Community Plan Area, less than one
mile from the University of Southern California (USC) campus. The
irregularly-shaped project site is located at the southeast corner of West
Adams Boulevard and Severance Street on a block that is also bordered by
Figueroa Street to the east, 28th Street to the south, and University Avenue to
the southeast….
 
The project will
demolish the existing on-site building and parking lot and construct 99 five bedroom
rental flats within six, three-story buildings over a single-level podium
parking structure, totaling four stories. Five of the units will be restricted
affordable units for Very Low Income households. An additional four-story
building provides a clubhouse that would include a variety of resident-serving
amenities. In total, the project will construct 183,150 square feet of new
floor area. The seven proposed buildings sit on a fully enclosed and screened
single-level, ground-floor parking structure providing a total of 259 vehicle
parking spaces for off-street parking….
 
The project
includes outdoor residential amenity spaces at the podium and building roof
levels. The podium-level amenity space would include landscaping, gathering
areas, paseos, outdoor cooking areas, and an outdoor swimming pool. Building
roofs contain additional private amenity spaces that would include landscaping
and outdoor lounge and cooking areas.
 
(Administrative
Record (“AR”) 283:3555.)  
 
Petitioners
filed a lawsuit challenging the zoning approvals and the City’s determination
that the 102-Unit Development was exempt from CEQA.   After
the trial court denied the writ petition, Petitioners appealed to the District Court
of Appeal, which reversed and found that the City improperly relied on
mitigation measures when concluding that the project’s rooftop decks would not
cause significant noise impacts.  (See West
Adams Heritage Association v. City of Los Angeles (2023) 2023 WL
5119275.)  The Real Parties petitioned
for review by the Supreme Court, and review was granted on November 21,
2023.  The parties represent that the
matter is pending before the Supreme Court and has been stayed pending
disposition of a different appeal.  (See OB
9 and Oppo. 12-13.) 
 
B.        The 52-Unit Development  
 
            In or about December 2021, the Real
Parties submitted an application for a building permit for the 52-Unit
Development, which is a standalone 52-unit, multi-family residential apartment
building that is 4-stories in height with 159,113 square feet of total building
area.  (AR 29:345, 358; see also AR
217:2924-45.) 
 
            In its administrative review of the Real
Parties’ application, the staff determined that a discretionary historic review
was not required because “[the] site is not identified as an eligible historic
resource & is not located in a potential historic district.”  (AR 26:300.)[1]  The staff determined that a discretionary “site
plan review” was not required because the project’s “base density minus
existing units on site equates to less than 50 new units.”  (Ibid.)  The staff also determined that a
discretionary Redevelopment Plan Project Compliance Review was not required
because the project complied with the Exposition/University Park Redevelopment
Plan (the “Redevelopment Plan”).  (Ibid.)  On November 1, 2022, after determining that
the 52-Unit Development required no discretionary approvals, the City issued
building permits for the Project.  (Pet.
RJN Exh. E.)   
 
In
February 2023, Petitioners asked the City how the 52-Unit Development could be
approved when the 102-Unit Development’s approvals were still pending.  (AR 14:50.) 
In response, the staff wrote Petitioner the following: 
 
The developer has
secured a building permit for the 52 unit project….  There was an RDP administrative review and
clearance issued for this project among other Planning clearances prior to
issuance of the building permit by LADBS. The 52 unit project is in no way
dependent on the approval of the larger project. [¶] There is no record from
City Planning to confirm that the larger project has been abandoned, although
building permits have not been issued. Planning approvals are typically not
terminated after the fact, although if not utilized, the Planning approval will
expire and no longer be valid.  
 
(AR
14:49.)  The staff also informed
Petitioners on February 22, 2023, that the 52-Unit Development was exempt from
CEQA environmental review because the building permit was approved
ministerially.  (AR 14:49.) 
 
C.        Writ Proceedings  
 
            On
April 27, 2023, Petitioner filed its original petition for writ of mandate
challenging the City’s ministerial approval of the 52-Unit
Development and the City’s determination that the Project was exempt from CEQA
review. 
On January 26, 2024, after a hearing, the court (Beckloff, J.) sustained
Respondents’ demurer to the petition with leave to amend.  On February 5, 2024, Petitioners filed the
operative, first amended petition (“FAP”), and the City and Real Parties filed
an answer on February 15, 2024.  On March
4, 2024, Petitioners filed their opening brief in support of the petition.  On April 2, 2024, Respondents filed their
joint opposition.  On April 16, 2024,
Petitioner filed their reply brief.    
 
EVIDENTIARY ISSUES
 
The court grants Respondents’
request for judicial notice, as there are no objections and the exhibits are
properly subject to judicial notice under Evidence Code section 452(c).  The court rules as follows on Petitioners’
request for judicial notice:
 
Exhibits A, C, D, E, G, H, I, and J
– GRANTED 
 
Exhibit B – GRANTED.  The Los Angeles Municipal Code section 13.12
is relevant to Petitioner’s arguments and subject to judicial notice under
Evidence Code section 452(b).  
 
Exhibit F – GRANTED.  The court overrules Respondents’ objections
because the Real Parties’ application to add one accessory dwelling unit
(“ADU”) is relevant to Petitioners’ arguments and subject to judicial notice
under Evidence Code section 452(c). 
Moreover, there was no administrative hearing at which Petitioner could
challenge the building permit, which was approved pursuant to the ministerial
exemption in CEQA.  Accordingly, Exhibit
F is admissible extra-record evidence. 
(See County of Mono v. City of Los Angeles (2022) 81 Cal.App.5th
657, 666-667 [“While extra-record evidence is largely inadmissible in
administrative mandamus cases, such evidence is admissible ‘in traditional
mandamus actions challenging ministerial or informal administrative actions if
the facts are in dispute.’”].)    
 
STANDARD OF REVIEW
 
            A.        Petition
for Writ of Traditional Mandate
 
            Pursuant to the
Local Rules that apply to petitions for writ of mandate, “[t]he opening and
opposition briefs must state the parties’ respective positions on whether the
petitioner is seeking traditional or administrative mandamus, or both.”  (Local Rule 3.231(i)(1).)  Petitioners and Respondents do not include sufficient
discussion of this issue in their briefing. 
The court finds that this action is one for an ordinary writ of mandate
because no administrative hearing was required for City to approve the Project
ministerially.  (See Bunnett v. Regents of University of
California (1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 843, 848 [“ordinary mandate is used to
review adjudicatory actions or decisions when the agency was not required to
hold an evidentiary hearing.”].)[2]  
 
There are two essential requirements for an ordinary writ of mandate
under Code of Civil Procedure section 1085: (1) a clear, present, and
ministerial duty on the part of the respondent, and (2) a clear, present, and
beneficial right on the part of the petitioner to the performance of that duty.
(California Ass’n for Health Services at
Home v. Department of Health Services (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 696, 704.)   “Generally, mandamus is available to compel a public agency’s
performance or to correct an agency's abuse of discretion when the action being
compelled or corrected is ministerial.”  (AIDS
Healthcare Foundation v. Los Angeles County Dept. of Public Health (2011)
197 Cal.App.4th 693, 700.)  An agency
is presumed to have regularly performed its official duties.  (Evid. Code § 664.)  Petitioner “bears the burden of proof in a
mandate proceeding brought under Code of Civil Procedure section 1085.”  (California
Correctional Peace Officers Assn. v. State Personnel Bd. (1995) 10 Cal.4th
1133, 1154.)  
 
An agency’s determination
that a project falls under the ministerial exemption from CEQA is reviewed for
abuse of discretion.  (Sierra Club v.
County of Sonoma (2017) 11 Cal.App.5th 11, 23.)  “When an agency concludes an activity is
exempt based on factual considerations, a court reviews for substantial
evidence.  If the agency’s determination
involves pure questions of law, we review those questions de novo.”  (Protecting Our Water and Environmental
Resources v. County of Stanislaus (2020) 10 Cal.5th 479, 495-96.)  However, whether an agency has improperly
segmented a project is generally a question of law, subject to de novo review.
(Banning Ranch Conservancy v. City of Newport Beach (2012) 211
Cal.App.4th 1209, 1224.)
 
B.        Rules of Statutory Interpretation 
 
On questions of
law arising in mandate proceedings, the court exercises independent
judgment.  (See Christensen v. Lightbourne (2017) 15 Cal.App.5th 1239, 1251.)  The interpretation of statute or regulation
is a question of law.  (See State Farm
Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Quackenbush (1999) 77 Cal.App.4th 65, 77.)   “The rules
governing statutory construction are well settled. We begin with the fundamental premise that the objective of statutory interpretation is
to ascertain and effectuate legislative intent. [Citations.]  To determine legislative intent, we turn first
to the words of the statute, giving them their usual and ordinary meaning.
[Citations.] When the language of a statute is clear, we need go no further.
However, when the language is susceptible of more than one reasonable
interpretation, we look to a variety of extrinsic aids, including the
ostensible objects to be achieved, the evils to be remedied, the legislative
history, public policy, contemporaneous administrative construction, and the
statutory scheme of which the statute is a part.”  (Nolan
v. City of Anaheim (2004) 33 Cal.4th 335, 340.)   
 
DISCUSSION 
 
            A.        Summary of the Issues   
 
            Petitioners challenge
the City’s determination that the 52-Unit Development is exempt from
environmental review under the ministerial exemption to CEQA.  “Ministerial projects are exempt from the
requirements of CEQA.”  (CEQA Guidelines
§ 15268; see Pub. Res. Code § 21080(b)(1).) 
No environmental review is required for a project that is exempt from
CEQA.  (McCorkle Eastside Neighborhood
Group v. City of St. Helena (2018) 31 Cal.App.5th 80, 89.)  “Issuance of building permits” are
“presumed to be ministerial” unless a “discretionary provision [is] contained
in the local ordinance.”  (Guidelines §
15268(b).)  “‘The statutory distinction between
discretionary and purely ministerial projects implicitly recognizes that unless
a public agency [is authorized to] shape the project in a way that would
respond to concerns raised in an EIR, or its functional equivalent,
environmental review would be a meaningless exercise.’ [Citation.]”  (Protecting Our Water, supra, 10
Cal.5th at 493-494.)
 
“Where a project
involves an approval that contains elements of both a ministerial action and a
discretionary action, the project will be deemed to be discretionary and will
be subject to the requirements of CEQA.” 
(CEQA Guidelines § 15268(d).)  “[A]
project cannot be divided into smaller parts that individually will not have a
significant effect on the environment…. [T]his rule is applicable even if one
of the smaller parts might require only ministerial, rather than discretionary,
approval.”  (Katzeff v. Department of
Forestry & Fire Protection (2010) 181 Cal.App.4th 601, 611; accord Orinda
Assn v. Board of Supervisors (1986) 182 Cal.App.3d 1145, 1171.) 
 
            Petitioner raises three arguments:
(1) The City erred in concluding that the discretionary Redevelopment Plan
Project Compliance review (the “Redevelopment Review”) was not required; it was
required under the Hoover/Exposition/University Park Redevelopment Plan (the
“Redevelopment Plan”); (2) The City erred in concluding that the discretionary
Site Plan Review was not required; the ADU put the project above the threshold;
and (3) The project has been improperly segmented.  Respondents argue that Petitioner’s claims
are untimely, but in the alternative, oppose the writ on the merits.  
 
            B.        Statute of Limitations  
 
Respondents argue
that Plaintiff’s claims are time-barred. 
The operative petition alleges that the ministerial exemption to CEQA is
not applicable because the City was required to undertake two discretionary reviews.  Respondents argue that the gravamen of this
case is a challenge to zoning decisions, which has a 90-day statute of
limitations under Government Code section 65901.  Petitioners argue that there is a 180-day
statute of limitations under CEQA for “action[s] or proceeding[s] alleging that
a public agency is carrying out or has approved a project that may have a
significant effect on the environment without having determined whether the
project may have a significant effect on the environment . . . .”  (Pub. Resources Code § 21167(a).)  The court need not resolve this issue because
assuming the petition was timely, Respondents prevail on the merits.  
 
C.         The City’s Redevelopment Plan
Determination 
 
            Petitioners argue that a
discretionary Redevelopment Review was required because the 52-Unit Development
exceeds the “49 unit land use density” allowed under the Redevelopment Plan,
which resulted from the City’s approval of three housing units under the State
Density Bonus Law and the City’s Density Bonus Ordinance. (OB 13-16.)  In ruling on the demurrer, Judge Beckloff rejected
this argument with respect to the discretionary Site Plan Review.  (See Court’s Order Sustaining Demurrer, dated
January 26, 2024, at 2-7.) 
 
On November 11,
2019, the City adopted an ordinance “to establish uniform citywide procedures,
standards, and criteria for reviewing and processing Redevelopment Plan
Projects” (“RDP Ordinance”). (Pet. RJN Exh. A [LAMC §11.5.14].)  The RDP Ordinance applies to “Redevelopment
Plan Projects,” defined as “any proposed development activity within a
Redevelopment Project Area with an Unexpired Redevelopment Plan that includes
the issuance of a building, grading, demolition, sign or change of use permit.”  (Id. § 11.5.14.C.)  The RDP Ordinance defines “Redevelopment
Regulations” as “the land use provisions of the Redevelopment Plans and design
for development guidelines adopted pursuant to such Redevelopment Plans.”  (Ibid.)  
 
            Petitioners contend that section
1306 of the Redevelopment Plan requires City to make four discretionary
findings for projects with more than 24 dwelling units per gross acre in areas
with the Low Medium II designation, which is 49 units in this case. (OB 15,
citing AR 269:3698.)  Section 1306 of the
Redevelopment Plan, titled “Residential Density Bonuses,” states in full:
 
In order to promote revitalization and after the
review and recommendation of the Project Area Committee, the Agency may, but is
not required to, subject to a development or participation agreement,
authorize new housing to be developed at higher densities than otherwise
permitted by Sections 1303, 1304, and 1305. The purpose is to achieve
flexibility in housing design, well-planned neighborhoods offering variety in
housing and environment to all socioeconomic groups, and to provide appropriate
land use through special methods of development. Agency approval of such development
shall:
 
1. Contribute to the revitalization goals of the Plan.

 
2. Contribute to a desirable residential environment,
neighborhood stability, and not adversely impact the neighboring environment. 
 
3. Provide units with adequate living area and avoid
excessively dense development. 
 
4. Provide appropriate parking.
 
(AR 269:3698 [bold
italics added].)  However, Petitioners do
not demonstrate that the three additional units were authorized through the
negotiation and adoption of a “development or participation agreement.”  Indeed, there is no procedure in the RDP
Ordinance for City to negotiate and adopt development or participation
agreements.  (Pet. RJN Exh. A.)[3]
 
            Instead, the City approved three
density bonus units for the Project pursuant to the State Density Bonus Law and
the City’s Density Bonus Ordinance.  (AR
26:300; AR 86:1145-1157.)  Government
Code section 65915, which is part of the State Density Bonus Law, states that
“[w]hen an applicant seeks a density bonus unit for a housing development . . .
th[e] local government shall comply with this section.”  (Gov. Code § 65915(a)(1).)  Specifically: “The granting of a density
bonus shall not require, or be interpreted, in and of itself, to require a
general plan amendment, local coastal plan amendment, zoning change, or
other discretionary approval.”  (Gov.
Code § 65915(f)(5), emphasis added.)  Similarly,
the City’s Density Bonus Ordinance states that “[a]pproval of Density Bonus
units shall not, in and of itself, trigger other discretionary
approvals required by the Code.” (Pet. RJN, Exh. C [LAMC § 12.22 A.25(c)(8)],
emphasis added.) 
 
            The State Density Bonus Law defeats
Petitioners’ argument.  In addition, the
City’s Density Bonus Ordinance controls over the RDP Ordinance.  The RDP Ordinance must be interpreted in
context of other relevant parts of the Los Angeles Municipal Code, including
the Density Bonus Ordinance.  (See Eskeland
v. City of Del Mar (2014) 224 Cal.App.4th 936, 947.)  Further, “[a]lthough statutory interpretation
is ultimately a judicial function, ‘the contemporaneous construction of a
statute by an administrative agency charged with its administration and
interpretation, while not necessarily controlling, is entitled to great weight
and should be respected by the courts unless it is clearly erroneous or
unauthorized [citations].’”  (City
of Monterey v. Carrnshimba (2013) 215 Cal.App.4th 1068, 1087, 1091.)  
 
The
City determined that the Project’s 52 units were “permitted within the
residential area per State Density Bonus (CA Govt Code Sec. 65915); therefore,
complies with the Exposition /University Redevelopment Plan.” (AR 26:300.)  Petitioners do not show that City’s
interpretation of the relevant ordinances was clearly erroneous.  The plain language of City’s code, which
includes the Density Bonus Ordinance, states that the addition of density bonus
units does not trigger discretionary approvals “required by the Code.”  The Density Bonus Ordinance further states
that its provisions apply to the grant of a density bonus for a housing
development project “[n]otwithstanding any provision of this Code to the
contrary.” (Pet. RJN Exh. C [LAMC, § 12.22 A.25(c)].)  Based on these provisions of City’s code,
City could reasonably conclude, as it did, that the grant of three density
bonus units under the Density Bonus Ordinance did not trigger a discretionary Redevelopment
Review.
 
Petitioners’
arguments to the contrary are not persuasive. 
Petitioners argue that the specific approvals listed in section
65915(f)(5) (i.e., general plan amendment, local coastal plan amendment,
zoning change) are all “legislative approvals” and that, under the maxim ejusdem
generis, non-legislative approvals, such as Redevelopment Plan Project
Compliance Review, are not included.  (OB
16.)  The plain language of this statute
is clear: “The granting of a density bonus shall not require, or be
interpreted, in and of itself, to require . . . other discretionary approval”
of such projects.  Therefore, the law is
clear: “If there is no ambiguity in the plain language of a statute, a court
presumes the lawmakers meant what they said, and the plain meaning of the
language governs.”  (Allen v.
Sully-Miller Contracting Co. (2002) 28 Cal.4th 222, 227.)  The principle of “ejusdem generis is
only an aid in getting the meaning and does not warrant confining the
operations of a statute within narrower limits than were intended.”  (Wishnev v. The Northwestern Mutual
Life Ins. Co. (2019) 8 Cal.5th 199, 213-14.)  Regardless, the legislative intent does not
support Petitioners’ argument.  “The
entire aim of Section 65915 is to provide incentives to developers to construct
housing for seniors and low-income families.” (Friends of Lagoon Valley v.
City of Vacaville (2007) 154 Cal.App.4th 807, 825.)  This legislative intent to promote the
construction of new affordable housing is also evident in the City’s Density
Bonus Ordinance, which was enacted “to establish procedures for implementing
State Density Bonus Law requirements, as set forth in Sections 65915-65918, and
to increase the production of affordable housing, consistent with City
policies.” (Pet. RJN Exh. C [LAMC § 12.22.A.25(a)].)  Petitioners’ narrow construction of section
65915(f) is inconsistent with the purposes of the State Density Bonus Law and the
City’s Density Bonus Ordinance.  Petitioners
also ignore the broad language of section 12.22.A.25(c)(8), of City’s Density
Bonus Ordinance, which states that “[a]pproval of Density Bonus units shall
not, in and of itself, trigger other discretionary approvals required by the
Code.”  (Pet. RJN Exh. C.)  
 
            Citing Government Code section
65915(j)(2), Petitioners argue that “[g]ranting a density bonus does not
require the City to waive these Redevelopment Plan findings because they do not
set a development standard.”  (OB
16.)  Section 65915(j)(2) provides, in
pertinent part, that “the granting of a density bonus shall not require or be
interpreted to require the waiver of a local ordinance or provisions of a local
ordinance unrelated to development standards.” 
(OB 16.)  To promote construction
of affordable housing, the State Density Bonus law requires agencies to “waive”
any zoning “development standard” such as height limits, setbacks, and floor
area ratios “that would physically preclude construction of that project as
designed.” (Gov. Code § 65915(e), (o)(2); see also Bankers Hill 150 v. City
of San Diego (2022) 74 Cal.App.5th 755, 775, 783.) Thus, in context,
subsection (j)(2) is reasonably interpreted to mean that local agencies are not
obligated to grant such waivers of local ordinance provisions that are not
development standards when granting a density bonus. (Gov. Code § 65915(j)(2).)  Subsection (j)(2) does not pertain to whether
the approval of density bonus units may trigger a discretionary approval.  
 
            Petitioners point out that Planning
Department staff initially found that discretionary Redevelopment Plan Project
Compliance was required for the Project. 
(OB 15, citing AR 113:1566.) 
However, as Petitioners acknowledge, City staff ultimately determined
that findings under section 1306 of the Redevelopment Plan were not required
because the three density bonus units were sought under the State Density Bonus
Law and the City’s Density Bonus Ordinance. 
(OB 15.)  The City was not bound
by the preliminary determination of the staff, and Petitioners do not show
legal error in the City’s final decision. 

 
            For the first time in reply,
Petitioners argue that City’s Redevelopment Regulations, including section 1306
of the pertinent Redevelopment Plan, “supersede” conflicting provisions from
the Density Bonus Ordinance.  (Reply
13.)  “The salutary rule is that points raised in a reply brief for the first
time will not be considered unless good cause is shown for the failure to
present them before.”  (Balboa Ins.
Co. v. Aguirre (1983) 149 Cal.App.3d 1002, 1010.)  Regardless, the argument is not persuasive
because section 1306 is not applicable.  Because
section 1306 of the Redevelopment Plan and the Density Bonus Ordinance provide
for additional density in different circumstances (i.e., section 1306
applies only when there is a development or participation agreement), there is
no conflict between the Redevelopment Regulations and the Density Bonus
Ordinance (and Government Code section 65915 would govern anyway).  
 
            Based upon the
foregoing, Petitioners do not demonstrate that the City erred in determining
that a discretionary Redevelopment Review was not required for the 52-Unit
Development.  Therefore, the petition for
writ of mandate is denied on this basis. 

 
            D.        The
City’s Site Plan Review Decision 
 
            Petitioners challenge the City’s
determination that a discretionary Site Plan Review was not required for the
52-Unit Development.  As discussed, Judge
Beckloff previously ruled that the approval of three additional units did not
trigger the requirement for a Site Plan Review. 
(See Court’s Order Sustaining Demurrer, dated January 26, 2024, at
2-7.)  Now, Petitioners argue that the
Real Parties applied to include one additional accessory dwelling unit on March
30, 2023, increasing the project to 53 units, necessitating a discretionary Site
Plan Review.  (OB 17-18.)  Petitioners’ argument fails for several
reasons.  
 
            First, this issue is not ripe.  “A basic prerequisite to judicial review of
administrative acts is the existence of a ripe controversy.”  (Santa Teresa Citizen Action Group v. City
of San Jose (2003) 114 Cal.App.4th 689, 708.)  “‘A decision attains the requisite
administrative finality when the agency has exhausted its jurisdiction and
possesses ‘no further power to reconsider or rehear the claim.’ …. Until a
public agency makes a ‘final’ decision, the matter is not ripe for judicial
review.”  (Cal. Water Impact Network v. Newhall County Water
Dist. (2008) 161 Cal.App.4th 1464, 1485.) 
Petitioners do not submit any evidence that the ADU permit has been
issued by the City.  Petitioners do not
argue, or show, that a pending application for an ADU permit determines
whether Site Plan Review is required.  Accordingly,
on this record, Petitioners’ claim based on the ADU application is not ripe.  
 
In the
alternative, assuming the claim is ripe, it would be untimely.  Petitioners did not raise this issue in the
original petition, which was filed almost two months after the real parties
submitted their ADU application. 
Instead, Petitioners first raised this issue over one year after the ADU
application, which would be untimely even assuming the 180-day statute of
limitations under CEQA governs this claim. 
The claim does not relate back to the filing of the original petition.   
 
Where the statute of limitations has expired before
the filing of an amended complaint, unless an amended complaint relates back to
a timely filed original complaint, the amended complaint will be time-barred.
Under the relation back doctrine, to avoid the statute of limitations bar, the
amended complaint must allege the same general set of facts, refer to the same
accident, same injuries, and refer to the same instrumentality as alleged in
the original complaint.  
 
(Fix the City,
Inc. v. City of Los Angeles (2024) 100 Cal.App.5th 363, 374, citations
omitted.)  “In determining whether the amended
complaint alleges facts that are sufficiently similar to those alleged in the
original complaint, the critical inquiry is whether the defendant had adequate
notice of the claim based on the original pleading.”  (See Pointe
San Diego Residential Community, L.P. v. Procopio, Cory, Hargreaves &
Savitch, LLP (2011) 195 Cal.App.4th 265, 277.)  “[D]ifferent acts
leading to distinct injuries are not part of
the ‘same general set of facts’ even though they may be part of the same
‘story.’”  (McCauley v. Howard Jarvis
Taxpayers Assn. (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 1255, 1262, emphasis in original.)  Simply, the real party’s new ADU application
is distinct from the claims raised in the original petition.   
 
Finally, reaching
the merits, Petitioners have not proven that an application for, or the
approval of, an ADU permit triggers discretionary Site Plan Review.  (See Oppo. 33-34; see Gov. Code § 66317(a) [“A
permit application for an accessory dwelling unit or a junior accessory
dwelling unit shall be considered and approved ministerially without
discretionary review or a hearing”]; Pet. RJN Exh. C at LAMC § 12.22.A.33(c)(2)
[“An ADU which complies with this subdivision shall not require a discretionary
planning approval.”].)  In the opening
brief, Petitioners failed to address this relevant language from the pertinent
statutes and from City’s code. 
Petitioners’ new arguments in reply are procedurally improper and also
unpersuasive on the merits.  (Reply 15-17.)

 
Based upon the
foregoing, the court finds that Petitioners’ claim that the Real Party’s ADU
application triggered the discretionary Site Plan Review is unripe or untimely,
and lacks merit.  Therefore, the petition
for writ of mandate is denied on this basis. 

 
E.         Segmenting/Piecemealing 
 
            Finally, Petitioners argue that the
real parties are “segmenting” or “piecemealing” the project in order to
circumvent CEQA.  As discussed, the real
parties initially intended to develop the 102-Unit Development (which is
tied-up in litigation) and now seek to develop the 52-Unit Development.  Petitioners argue that the 52-Unit Development “represents the first phase of the original
102-unit development.”  (OB 20.)  
 
CEQA prohibits “piecemeal” review of the significant environmental
impacts of a “project.”  (See Banning
Ranch Conservancy v. City of Newport Beach (2012) 211 Cal.App.4th 1209,
1222.)  Accordingly,
“an EIR must include an analysis of the environmental effects of future
expansion or other action if: (1) it is a reasonably foreseeable consequence of
the initial project; and (2) the future expansion or action will be significant
in that it will likely change the scope or nature of the initial project or its
environmental effects.”  (Laurel Heights Improvement Assn. v. Regents
of University of California (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 396.)  
 
A “project” is defined under CEQA as an “activity which may cause either
a direct physical change in the environment, or a reasonably foreseeable
indirect physical change in the environment....” (Pub. Resources
Code § 21065; see also CEQA
Guidelines § 15378.)  “Activity”
includes “[a]n activity directly undertaken by any public agency.” (§
21065(a).)  The term project is afforded
“a broad interpretation ... to maximize protection of the environment.’
[Citation.]  ‘Project’ refers to ‘the whole of an action….”  (Riverwatch v. Olivenhain Mun. Water Dist.
(2009) 170 Cal.App.4th 1186, 1203.) 
“This broad interpretation ensures CEQA’s requirements are not avoided
by chopping a proposed activity into bite-sized pieces which, when taken
individually, may have no significant adverse effect on the environment.”  (POET,
LLC v. State Air Resources Board (2017) 12 Cal.App.5th 52, 73.)  
 
            1.         The segmenting rule applies to
ministerial projects 
 
Respondents argue that CEQA does not apply to ministerial projects, so the
concept of segmenting is not applicable in this case.  However, Respondents do not establish that
the 102-Unit Development is subject to the ministerial exemption to CEQA.  It is well established that “a project cannot
be divided into smaller parts that individually will not have a significant
effect on the environment…. [T]his rule is applicable even if one of the
smaller parts might require only ministerial, rather than discretionary,
approval.”  (Katzeff v. Department of
Forestry & Fire Protection (2010) 181 Cal.App.4th 601, 611; accord Orinda
Assn v. Board of Supervisors (1986) 182 Cal.App.3d 1145, 1171.)  Therefore, the court will reach the merits of
Petitioners’ claim.     
 


 
            2.         Petitioners’
Segmenting/Piecemealing Claim is Speculative 
 
            The court considers
several factors in determining whether two projects are truly one project that
is being built in phases.  Where two activities are “part of a
coordinated endeavor” they may constitute a single project.  (County of Ventura
v. City of Moorpark
(2018) 24 Cal.App.5th 377, 385.)  In addition, “there may be improper piecemealing when the
purpose of the reviewed project is to be the first step toward future
development…. And there may be improper piecemealing when the reviewed project
legally compels or practically presumes completion of another action. … On
the other hand, two projects may properly undergo separate environmental review
(i.e., no piecemealing) when the projects have different proponents, serve
different purposes, or can be implemented independently.”  (Banning Ranch, supra, 211 Cal.App.4th
at 1223.)  
 
As applied here, Petitioners’ segmentation claim fails for several
reasons.  Most important, the real
parties cannot construct both projects because they cannot physically co-exist
on Parcel One.  (Compare AR 254:3583
[plans for 102-Unit Development]; AR 29:344-563 [plans for 52-Unit
Development].)  If the pending litigation
before the Supreme Court were to be resolved in the Real Parties’ favor and they
proceed with the 102-Unit Development, then they necessarily could not build
the 52-Unit Development.  Rather, the 52-Unit
Development and 102-Unit Development are alternatives to one
another that propose different developments on Parcel One of the subject
site.  (See AR 14:49.)  Thus, they are two different, independent
projects that cannot be subject to piecemealing.  (See Leonoff v. Monterey County Bd. of
Supervisors (1990) 222 Cal.App.3d 1337, 1358 [no piecemealing occurred
where “there were two separate projects].) 
Similarly, because the Real Parties cannot construct both the 52-Unit
Development and 102-Unit Development, neither project is a “reasonably
foreseeable consequence” of the other.  (Laurel Heights, supra, 47 Cal.3d at
396.)  
 
As Petitioners acknowledge, there are many design differences between
the 52-Unit Development and the 102-Unit Development (which would have been divided
into two phases).  (See OB 20:6-15; see
also Oppo. 13-14 and AR 22:154; 29:345, 358-360, 391; 49:647-651; 169:1974;
Pet. RJN, Exh. G at 122.)  For example,
the 52-Unit Development consists of all two- or three-bedroom units, while the
102-Unit Development consists primarily of five-bedroom units.  (See AR 29:344-563, 40:599-600; Pet. RJN Exh.
G at 122.)[4]  Respondents cite evidence, which Petitioners
do not refute, that there are many other differences between the two projects,
including (1) location of the buildings on the site; (2) the building types (i.e.,
the 52-Unit Development is slab on grade while the 102-Unit Development is a
podium project); (3) building footprints and layouts; (4) parking design; and (5)
open space design.  (See Oppo. 38, citing
record; Reply 7-8 [responding to certain design differences, but not
others].)  These design differences undermine
Petitioners’ assertion that one project is a “reasonably foreseeable
consequence” of the other.
 
There is no evidence in the record of any plans for future expansion of
the 52-Unit Development.  Nor is there
any evidence in the record concerning the Real Parties’ plans, if any, for
Parcel Two.  Instead, Petitioners’
segmentation claim is predicated heavily on the following contention: “[The] Real
Parties have continued to pursue 102 units of development on the whole of the
site by seeking review from the California Supreme Court, further demonstrating
the residential development across the whole of the site is the clear intent.”  (OB 20:25-27.)  However, Petitioners do not cite any evidence
in the record, or from their request for judicial notice, of any plans for
future expansion of the 52-Unit Development or for development of the adjacent
parcel.  Moreover, Petitioners ignore the
procedural history of this case and the related cases.  This is not a case in which the Real Parties
engaged in segmenting at the outset by submitting plans for the 52-Unit
Development and then attempted to develop Parcel Two.  Rather, the real parties proposed to
construct the 102-Unit Development in 2018, and the project was stalled by
objections and litigation.  Over three
years later, in December 2021, the Real Parties proposed to develop the smaller
project.  This procedural history does
not support Petitioners’ claim of segmenting.   

 
Petitioners’
remaining arguments are not persuasive.  Petitioners
assert that “[t]he 52-unit development would be developed in an area that
roughly corresponds to Phase 1 of the approved 102-unit development, with
Parcel 2 remaining available for future development similar to Phase 2 with
Buildings 6 and 7.”  (OB 10:23-25; see
also Id. 19-20.)  However, Petitioners
fail to show that the second phase of the 102-Unit Development is a viable,
standalone development project that would physically fit on Parcel 2.  (Oppo. 39-40.)  Respondents cite record evidence that, as
part of the 52-Unit Development, the Real Parties substantially reduced the
size of Parcel Two of the prior, larger 102-Unit Development site and legally
separated the lots with a termination of the existing lot tie covenant.  (Oppo. 39, citing AR 29:345, 358-360;
49:647-651; 169:1974.)  In reply, Petitioners
acknowledge that there was a “lot line adjustment” and they do not rebut
Respondents’ contention that the second phase of the larger project, as
originally planned, would not fit on Parcel Two.  (Reply 20, fn. 3.)
 
Further, Respondents
argue: “The 102-Unit Development was designed as a single project with multiple
buildings and a side-wide single-story parking podium that traverses Parcels 1
and 2; building only Phase 2 of the 102-Unit Development on Parcel 2 would
entail building only a portion of the larger garage and only a portion of the
two of the three proposed buildings in Phase 2.”  (Oppo. 39.) 
Respondents also show, with record citation, that “Phase 2 of the
102-Unit Development, alone, could not legally be built under City zoning
standards and its entitlements from the City.” 
(Oppo. 39-40.)  Petitioners do not
meaningfully respond in reply.  (Sehulster Tunnels/Pre-Con v. Traylor
Brothers, Inc. (2003) 111 Cal.App.4th 1328, 1345, fn. 16 [failure to
address point is “equivalent to a concession”].)  In fact, Petitioners concede that Real
Parties would need to modify the second of the 102-Unit Development “from what
was approved.”  (Reply 20:23-24.)  
 
Petitioners cite Arviv
Enterprises, Inc. v. South Valley Area Planning Com. (2002) 101 Cal.App.4th
1333, but that case is distinguishable. 
In Arviv, “over a short period of time, a housing developer
managed to secure among other things (1) a series of permits to build five
houses downslope from Mulholland Drive; (2) a categorical environmental
exemption to build two additional houses across the street; (3) a mitigated
negative declaration to build 14 additional houses on an adjacent street; and
(4) a variance for one of the five houses built over height.”  (Id. at 1336.)  The evidence showed that the developer,
“never intended a two or three house project. As he admitted at the hearing
before the Commission, he always envisioned a 21-house development.”  (Id. at 1346.)  Accordingly, the Court of Appeal found no abuse
of discretion in City’s determination that “ the cumulative effects from
what was in reality a development project for 21 hillside houses required an
environmental review of the project as a whole.”  (Id. at 1336.)  By contrast, in the instant case, there are
two alternative development proposals that, as a result of occupying the same
physical space, cannot both be built, and the second one was proposed only
after the first one became mired in legal challenges.  
 
Petitioners also
cite Laurel
Heights Improvement Assn. v. Regents of University of California (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, but that case does not suggest there was improper
segmentation in the instant case.  In Laurel
Heights, the
“[t]he
draft EIR acknowledged that UCSF will occupy the entire Laurel Heights facility
when the remainder of the space becomes available.”  Further, “UCSF explained that it intends to
use the facility for the School of Pharmacy's basic science group and UCSF’s
Office of the Dean. The EIR even estimated the number of faculty, staff, and
students that will occupy the facility until 1995 (a total of 460 persons) and
then afterward when the entire facility becomes available (860 persons).”  (Laurel Heights, supra, 47 Cal.3d at
396.)  Thus, based on the record before
the Court, it was “indisputable that the future expansion and general type of
future use is reasonably foreseeable.”  (Ibid.)  By contrast, in the instant case, there is no
evidence how the Real Parties would use or develop Parcel Two if it abandons
the 102-Unit Development and opts to construct the 52-Unit Development.  Without evidence of how Parcel Two might be
developed, it cannot be determined that “the future expansion or action will be
significant in that it will likely change the scope or nature of the initial
project or its environmental effects.”  (Laurel
Heights, supra, 47 Cal.3d at 396.)   
 
In sum, the court finds that there has been no segmenting in this case
because: (1) Both projects cannot be built; (2) There are significant design
differences between the two projects; (3) There is no evidence in the record of
any coordinated or future development of the adjacent parcel; and (4) The
procedural history does not support any claim of segmenting.  At heart, Petitioners’ claim is based
entirely on speculation about what might occur if the 52-Unit Development is
constructed and the Real Parties abandon the 102-Unit Development.  The courts have made clear that speculation
about future development is insufficient to support a claim of improper
piecemealing.  (See Aptos Council v.
County of Santa Cruz (2017) 10 Cal.App.5th 266, 294-295 [no piecemealing
where “the type of future development that will be proposed is purely
speculative at this point”]; Lucas Valley Homeowners Assn v. County of Marin
(1991) 233 Cal.App.3d 130, 162 [“The dreams of the rabbis and others for expansion, and past
outreach efforts, are not substantial evidence that future expansion of the
project, as presented to the Board, is
reasonably foreseeable.”]; El Dorado County Taxpayers for Quality Growth v.
County of El Dorado
(2004) 122 Cal.App.4th 1591, 1600 [additional mining was not a reasonably
foreseeable consequence of reclamation plan because it was dependent on many
outside factors, including federal approval and environmental, social, and
political factors].)  Therefore,
Petitioners’ claim fails.
 


 
            3.         Petitioners’
Segmenting/Piecemealing Claim is Premature 
 
At heart,
Petitioners’ segmenting claim is premature. 
The appropriate time to raise this claim would be when, if ever, the
Real Parties attempt to develop Parcel Two. 
At that point, the court can evaluate the two projects together to
determine whether they are part of a coordinated endeavor and truly constitute
one project.  Petitioners argue: “The
City’s segmentation of the project is extremely prejudicial.”  (OB 22.) 
The court disagrees.  If the Real
Parties prevail in the litigation before the California Supreme Court and elect
to proceed with the 102-Unit Development, the City will conduct an
environmental review if it is required.[5]  In the alternative, if the Real Parties elect
to proceed with the 52-Unit Development and then attempt to develop Parcel Two,
any required environmental review would consider the impacts of that
development.
