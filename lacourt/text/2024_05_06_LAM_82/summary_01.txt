**Case Summary**

The case is a tentative ruling on a petition for writ of mandate filed by the West Adams Heritage Association and the Adams Severance Coalition against the City of Los Angeles and others. The petitioners challenge the city's approval of the 52-unit development project at 806 West Adams Boulevard, arguing that the project is not exempt from environmental review under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).

The court's tentative ruling denies the petition for writ of mandate on several grounds. 

1. **Ministerial Exemption**: The court concludes that the 52-unit development project is exempt from CEQA under the ministerial exemption, as it does not require discretionary approval.
2. **Redevelopment Plan**: The court finds that the project's compliance with the Redevelopment Plan's density bonus provisions does not require a discretionary Redevelopment Plan Project Compliance Review.
3. **Site Plan Review**: The court holds that the addition of one accessory dwelling unit does not trigger a discretionary Site Plan Review.

The court's reasoning is based on the plain language of the relevant statutes and ordinances, including the State Density Bonus Law and the City's Density Bonus Ordinance. The court also considers the legislative intent behind these laws and ordinances, which is to promote the construction of affordable housing.

In reaching its conclusions, the court rejects several arguments made by the petitioners, including their contention that the city's Redevelopment Plan Project Compliance Review is required and that the addition of one accessory dwelling unit triggers a discretionary Site Plan Review.
