[1] Petitioners do not challenge the
decision not to conduct an historic review. 



[2] The court would reach the same
decision even if this petition was governed by Code of Civil Procedure section
1094.5.  


[3] Respondents represent that such
development or participation agreements are “a relic of the City’s former
Redevelopment Agency, which was dissolved by statute in 2011.”  (Oppo. 28-29.)  Petitioners do not dispute that
representation.    


[4] Respondents represent that the
52-Unit Development “is made up entirely of two-bedroom units” (Oppo. 38:10), but
they do not explain evidence stating that the units in this Project are predominately
three bedrooms.  (See AR 29:344-563,
40:599-600.)  In any event, whether the 52-Unit Development is made up of
two- or three-bedroom units, or some combination thereof, is not
dispositive.  The unit sizes for the
52-Unit Development clearly differ from the 102-Unit Development.  


[5] The City’s compliance with CEQA
concerning the 102-Unit Development is not at issue in this case, so the court
takes no position on that issue.  The
court’s analysis applies only to the 52-Unit Development.
