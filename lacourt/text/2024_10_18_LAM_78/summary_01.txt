Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on two motions: a motion to transfer venue from Los Angeles County to Orange County, and a motion to quash service of summons on Hochiki Corporation.

Regarding the motion to transfer venue, the judge grants the motion and orders the case to be transferred to Orange County. The judge finds that Hochiki America Corporation, the company employing the plaintiff, has its principal office and records in Orange County, and that the case does not have any nexus to Los Angeles County.

Regarding the motion to quash service of summons, the judge denies the motion. The judge finds that Hochiki Corporation has purposefully availed itself of the privilege of conducting activities in California through its involvement in the management of Hochiki America Corporation, and that the exercise of jurisdiction over Hochiki Corporation is reasonable.

The judge also addresses the issue of service of process on Hochiki Corporation, finding that service was properly made on the company's registered agent in California, and that the Hague Service Convention is not implicated in this case.

Finally, the judge notes that the parties are encouraged to meet and confer to reach an agreement, and that the parties should assume that others may appear at the hearing to argue.
