And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion by Cross-Complainant Judy Chou Wang to extend the deadline to file an amended cross-complaint. The motion was filed on February 26, 2024, and the deadline to file the amended cross-complaint was originally set for February 26, 2024. However, Cross-Complainant recently retained an attorney and is requesting an extension of 30 days to file the amended cross-complaint. The judge has reviewed the motion and has determined that Cross-Complainant has demonstrated good cause for an extension. Therefore, the judge is granting the motion and ordering Cross-Complainant to file the amended cross-complaint within 10 days of the date of this order.
