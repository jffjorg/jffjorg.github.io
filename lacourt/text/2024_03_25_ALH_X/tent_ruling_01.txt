RELIEF
REQUESTED 
 
             Cross-Complainant moves for an
order extending the time to file an amended cross-complaint. 
 
BACKGROUND
 
             This case arises out of Plaintiff Dolly
Hwang’s (“Plaintiff”) claim that Defendants Judy Chou Wang (“Judy”) and her son
Pod John Michael Wang (“John”) convinced her to invest $200,000 pursuant to a
promissory note but failed to pay Plaintiff back under the agreement. 
 
            Plaintiff filed a first amended
complaint (“FAC”) on August 3, 2022, alleging seven causes of action for (1)
breach of written contract, (2) fraud and intentional misrepresentations, (3)
civil conspiracy, (4) elder abuse for damages, (5) intentional infliction of
emotional distress, (6) promissory estoppel, and (7) unjust enrichment. 
             
TENTATIVE RULING
             
            Cross-Complainant’s
motion to extend the deadline to file the second amended cross-complaint is
GRANTED. Cross-Complainant is ordered to file the SACC within 10 days of the
date of this order.
 
DISCUSSION
 
Cross-Complainant moves for an order extending the time to file an
amended cross-complaint. Cross-Complainant filed an amended cross-complaint on
October 20, 2023. Plaintiff demurred to the amended cross-complainant. At
hearing on January 25, 2024, this court sustained Plaintiff’s demurrer with 30
days leave to amend. According to the order, Cross-Complainant was required to
file a second amended cross-complaint by February 26, 2024. On the same date,
Cross-Complainant filed the instant motion to extend time to file.
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 1054, subdivision (a), provides: “When an act to
be done, as provided in this code, relates to the pleadings in the
action, . . . may be extended, upon good cause shown, by the judge of the
court in which the action is pending, or by the judge who presided at the trial
of the action; but the extension so allowed shall not exceed 30
days, without the consent of the adverse party.”
 
Cross-Complainant provides that
she has experienced personal hardship and recently retained an attorney.
Cross-Complaint provides she retained an attorney on February 21, 2024, 5 days
prior to the deadline to file the amended cross-complaint. Cross-Complainant
has demonstrated good cause for an extension.
 
 
            Cross-Complainant’s
motion to extend the deadline to file the second amended cross-complaint is
granted. 
 
CONCLUSION
 
            Cross-Complainant’s
motion to extend the deadline to file the second amended cross-complaint is
GRANTED. Cross-Complainant is ordered to file the SACC within 10 days of the
date of this order.
