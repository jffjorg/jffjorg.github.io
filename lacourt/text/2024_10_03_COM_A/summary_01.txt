And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the plaintiff's motion for relief from waiver of trial by jury. The plaintiff had posted jury fees on June 20, 2023, but did not file a Demand for Jury Trial until August 8, 2024, which the plaintiff's counsel asserts was an inadvertent mistake. The court has discretion to allow a jury trial despite a waiver, and relief from waiver may be granted where there has been no prejudice to the other party or to the court. The court has found that the plaintiff's failure to timely pay jury fees was an inadvertent mistake and has granted the motion.
