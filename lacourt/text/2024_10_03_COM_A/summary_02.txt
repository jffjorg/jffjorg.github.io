And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to stay discovery as to Defendant Agustin Ramirez. Ramirez, who is employed by Pearce Tank Line, Inc. and was driving a tractor trailer at the time of the incident, has been charged with vehicular manslaughter in a related criminal case. Ramirez argues that he should not be compelled to answer questions in discovery that may incriminate him, while the plaintiffs argue that they will suffer prejudice if discovery is stayed. The court has granted the motion to stay discovery as to Ramirez pending the outcome of the criminal prosecution, but has also allowed discovery to continue with respect to claims against Pearce Tank Line, Inc. that are not clearly implicated by Ramirez's Fifth Amendment rights.
