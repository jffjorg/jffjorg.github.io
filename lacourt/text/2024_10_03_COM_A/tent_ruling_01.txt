[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFF’S
 MOTION FOR RELIEF FROM WAIVER OF TRIAL BY JURY
 
      Plaintiff
had earlier posted jury fees on June 20, 2023 but did not file a Demand for
Jury Trial until August 8, 2024, which Plaintiff’s counsel asserts was an
inadvertent mistake. 
      A party
waives jury trial by failing to timely pay the jury fee. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 631 (f) (5).) 
The court has discretion to allow a jury
trial although there may have been a waiver. (Code Civ. Proc., § 631 (g).) Relief from waiver may be granted where there
has been no prejudice to the other party or to the court from an inadvertent
waiver. (Wharton v. Superior Court (1991)
231 Cal.App.3d 100, 104.)
Because the right to jury trial is fundamental, doubts are resolved in favor of
allowing a jury trial. (Tesoro del Valle Master Homeowners
Assn. v. Griffin (2011) 200 Cal.App.4th 619, 638.)
      No
opposition has been filed. Accordingly, the motion is GRANTED.
