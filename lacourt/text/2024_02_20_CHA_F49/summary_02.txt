Here is the English text summary of the tentative ruling:

The Court has granted the Motion to Expunge Lis Pendens filed by Defendant Brian Horvoth. The Court finds that the Notice of Pendency of Action (Lis Pendens) was improperly served and is therefore void under Code of Civil Procedure section 405.23. Additionally, the Court concludes that Plaintiff Agustin Heredia has not alleged a real property claim, rendering the recording of a lis pendens impermissible.

The Court has awarded Defendant Horvoth reasonable attorney fees and costs in the amount of $1,060.00, which includes $1,000.00 in attorney fees and $60.00 in costs. The Court has also ordered Plaintiff to pay this amount within 10 days of issuance of the order.

The Court's decision is based on its review of the records and the parties' submissions, including the Complaint, Notice of Pendency of Action, Application for Publication, and Motion to Expunge Lis Pendens. The Court's analysis is guided by the relevant statutes, including Code of Civil Procedure sections 405.20-405.32, and California Rules of Court, rule 3.1300(c).
