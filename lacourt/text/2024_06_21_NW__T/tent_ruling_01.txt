Perkins v Bustamante
Tentative
ruling: Motion to withdraw
Continue.  There is no evidence that plaintiff was
served.  The papers were served by
certified mail, return receipt, when they only needed to be served by mail and,
perhaps, email.  There is no return
receipt showing that it was delivered or attempted to be delivered.  In the absence of something showing actual
receipt by plaintiff, the court will continue the hearing and order that the
plaintiff be served by regular US mail, and to each email address known to be
used by plaintiff, and then a proof of service filed.
The matter

Notice by plaintiff’s counsel.
