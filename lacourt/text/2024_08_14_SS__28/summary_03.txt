And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled on the motion to enforce the settlement and the motion to dismiss the case. The parties settled the case in February 2023 for $50,000.00, but the settlement is conditioned on the approval of a minor's compromise. The release signed by the parties is dependent on the Court's approval of the minor's compromise, and the Court has not received or granted a petition to approve the minor's compromise. Therefore, the Court cannot enforce the settlement agreement. The Court denies the motion to enforce the settlement and, in the alternative, to dismiss the case. However, the Court orders the plaintiff to file a petition to approve the minor's compromise and notice of settlement within 30 days.
