The judge finds that the deemed admissions were the result of the plaintiff's counsel's mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. The judge also grants the intervenor's request to continue the trial, allowing the intervenor time to pursue additional discovery related to the matter involved in the withdrawn or amended admission. The trial is continued to January 2, 2025, or the next available date.
