D.   This motion 
On July

mental examination.  The motion was set
for hearing on August 14, 2024.  On July
31, 2024, Gregorio filed an opposition.  On August 7, 2024, Windom filed a reply.  
PARTIES’ REQUESTS 
Windom asks the Court to compel Gregorio to attend an
independent neuropsychological examination with Anita Hamilton, Ph.D., ABPP-CN,
a board-certified clinical neuropsychologist, on September 11, 2024 at 9:30
a.m. at Dr. Hamilton’s clinic, located at 3020 Old Ranch Parkway, Suite 306,
Seal Beach, CA 90740. 
Gregorio, by her guardian ad litem Jazmin
Torres Novoa, asks the Court to deny the motion. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
Code of Civil Procedure section 2032.310 provides: 
“(a) If any
party desires to obtain discovery by a physical examination other than that
described in Article 2 (commencing with Section 2032.210), or by a mental
examination, the party shall obtain leave of court. 
“(b) A motion
for an examination under subdivision (a) shall specify the time, place, manner,
conditions, scope, and nature of the examination, as well as the identity and
the specialty, if any, of the person or persons who will perform the
examination. The motion shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration
under Section 2016.040. 
“(c) Notice
of the motion shall be served on the person to be examined and on all parties
who have appeared in the action.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2032.310.) 
Code of Civil Procedure section 2032.320 provides in
part: 
“(a) The
court shall grant a motion for a physical or mental examination under Section
2032.310 only for good cause shown. 
“(b) If a
party stipulates as provided in subdivision (c), the court shall not order a
mental examination of a person for whose personal injuries a recovery is being
sought except on a showing of exceptional circumstances. 
“(c) A
stipulation by a party under this subdivision shall include both of the
following: 
“(1) A
stipulation that no claim is being made for mental and emotional distress over
and above that usually associated with the physical injuries claimed. 
“(2) A
stipulation that no expert testimony regarding this usual mental and emotional
distress will be presented at trial in support of the claim for damages. 
“(d) An order
granting a physical or mental examination shall specify the person or persons
who may perform the examination, as well as the time, place, manner, diagnostic
tests and procedures, conditions, scope, and nature of the examination. . . .” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2032.320, subds. (a), (b), (c), (d).) 
DISCUSSION 
Windom asks the Court to grant his motion to compel
Gregorio’s mental examination because Gregorio is asserting “emotional and
psychological injuries (e.g., brain injury and the decrease in [Gregorio’s]
mental processing speed), in addition to [Gregorio] still requiring extra help
at school through [an] IEP.”  (Motion p. 5.) 
In response, Gregorio argues (1) Windom did not satisfy
the statutory meet and confer requirement, and (2) “There is no explanation in
the motion why a mental examination is required where Plaintiff has since
offered to stipulate that she has the normal sequelae of damages from her head
injury, and so the motion should be denied. The intrusion to Plaintiff Gregorio’s
privacy and that of her G.A.L., Plaintiff Novoa, simply cannot be justified."  (Opposition p. 2.) 
The Court has reviewed the emails attached to Windom’s
reply and finds that Windom’s counsel has sufficiently met and conferred with
Gregorio’s counsel. 
The emails also show that the parties’ counsel have
discussed whether Gregorio will provide a stipulation under Code of Civil
Procedure section 2032.320, subdivision (c). 
On July 10, 2024, Gregorio’s counsel emailed: “plf will be stipulating
under ccp 2032(b) and (c).”  (The Court
assumes that Gregorio’s counsel was referring to Code of Civil Procedure
section 2032.320.)  On July 11, 2024,
Windom’s counsel stated that if Gregorio “stipulates that she is not claiming
on-going psychological injuries—besides the normal pain and suffering—then we
will forego the mental exam with Dr. Hamilton.” 
Gregorio’s counsel responded that Gregorio “does not waive a claim for
past or future psychological injuries.” 
It appears that Windom’s counsel wants Gregorio to
stipulate not only to the terms included in Code of Civil Procedure section
2032.320, subdivision (c), but also that she is “not claiming
on-going psychological injuries—besides the normal pain and suffering.”  Windom has not explained why the statute should be construed to require
this additional stipulation. 
Because Gregorio’s counsel has agreed to stipulate to
the terms of Code of Civil Procedure section 2032.320, subdivisions (b) and (c),
Windom was required to show “exceptional circumstances” to support a request
for an order compelling a mental examination. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2032.320, subd. (b).)  Windom has not made this showing.  Therefore, the Court denies the motion. 
CONCLUSION 
The Court DENIES Defendant Franklin Windom’s motion to
compel Plaintiff Ashley Gregorio’s mental examination. 
Moving party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Moving party is ordered to file the proof of service
of this ruling with the Court within five days.
