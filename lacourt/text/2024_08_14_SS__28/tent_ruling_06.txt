 Case Number:  23STCV05504    Hearing Date:   August 14, 2024    Dept:  28 Having  considered the petitioning papers, the Court rules as follows.  BACKGROUND  On  March 13, 2023, Plaintiffs Jose Luis Espinosa-Rodriguez and Daniel Espinosa, a  minor by and through his guardian ad litem Ma Luisa Huerta-Rangel, filed this  action against Defendants Kasey Williams and Does 1-25 for negligence.  On  April 13, 2023, the Court appointed Ma Luisa  Huerta-Rangel to serve as guardian ad litem for Plaintiff Daniel Espinosa.  On  May 3, 2024, Petitioner Ma Luisa Huerta-Rangel (“Petitioner”)  filed a petition to approve the compromise of minor Plaintiff Daniel Espinosa’s claims.  The petition was set for hearing on June 7, 2024.  The Court continued the hearing to August 14,  2024.  PETITIONER’S REQUEST  Petitioner  asks the Court to grant the petition to approve the compromise of the action of  minor Plaintiff Daniel Espinosa (“Plaintiff”).  DISCUSSION            The petition contains the following information:  Gross settlement amount:                                                  $15,000.00 Total medical expenses:                                                     $37,978.05 Medi-Cal lien:                                                                    $1,813.56 Attorney’s fees:                                                                 $3,579.20 Costs:                                                                                $607.24 Net settlement amount:                                                      $9,000.00   Petitioner  has submitted the petition using a superseded version of Judicial Council Form  MC-350.  Petitioner should resubmit the  petition using the current version of the form.  Section  13b(1) of the petition appears to state that Petitioner paid $1,813.56 of  Plaintiff’s medical expenses and will be reimbursed for this payment from the  settlement proceeds.  Section  13b(2) of the petition states that a non-ERISA insured plan paid $2,690.80 of Plaintiff’s  medical expenses.  Due to a negotiated  reduction of $877.24, the non-ERISA insured plan will be reimbursed $1,813.56  from the settlement proceeds.  Section  12b(4) of the petition states that Medi-Cal paid $2,690.80 of Plaintiff’s medical  expenses and has agreed to accept reimbursement of $1,813.56.  Petitioner  has not filled out Section 15 of the petition.  In  the petition’s summary section, Section 17a states that $1,813.56 in medical  expenses will be paid from the settlement proceeds.  The statement appears to conflict with  Sections 13b(1), 13b(2), and 13b(4), which state (or appear to state) that  Petitioner, a non-ERISA insured plan, and Medi-Cal each have separate claims to  $1,813.56 in reimbursement (totaling $5,440.68). In addition, the Court cannot approve a petition unless it shows that all medical expenses that have not been waived or reduced will be paid or reimbursed from the settlement proceeds.  Here, the petition does not show that the total medical expenses of $37,978.05 have been waived or reduced or will be paid or reimbursed from the settlement proceeds.   Petitioner  should resubmit the petition on the current version of Judicial Council Form  MC-350 (https://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/mc350.pdf),  clarify the apparent inconsistencies, and complete the applicable portions of  the form.  The  Court denies the petition without prejudice.  CONCLUSION  The  Court DENIES without prejudice the petition to approve the compromise of minor  Plaintiff Daniel Espinosa’s claims filed by Petitioner Ma Luisa Huerta-Rangel.  Petitioner  is ordered to give notice of this ruling.  Petitioner  is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court within  five days.
