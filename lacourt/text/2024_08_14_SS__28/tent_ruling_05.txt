 Case Number:  22STCV39295    Hearing Date:   August 14, 2024    Dept:  28 Having  considered the petitioning papers, the Court rules as follows.  BACKGROUND  On December  19, 2022, Plaintiff Carla Gipson as guardian ad litem for minor Alex Polk filed  this action against Defendants City of Los Angeles (“Defendant”) and Does 1-10  for premises liability.  On May  30, 2023, Defendant filed an answer.  On May  16, 2024, Plaintiff filed a notice of settlement.  On  July 10, 2024, Petitioner Carla Gipson (“Petitioner”)  submitted a petition for expedited approval of the compromise of minor  Plaintiff Alex Polk’s claims.   PETITIONER’S REQUEST  Petitioner  asks the Court to grant the petition for expedited approval of the compromise  of the action of minor Plaintiff Alex Polk (“Plaintiff”).  DISCUSSION            The petition contains the following information:  Gross settlement amount:                                                  $15,000.00 Medi-Cal lien:                                                                    $242.44 Attorney’s fees:                                                                 $3,750.00 Non-medical costs:                                                           $545.00 Net settlement amount:                                                      $10,462.56   Section  1 of the petition states that Carla Gipson is Plaintiff’s guardian ad  litem.  However, on December 21, 2022,  the Court denied an application to appoint Carla Gipson as Plaintiff’s guardian  ad litem and Plaintiff did not file another application. Petitioner  has not filled out Section 13a of the petition, suggesting that Plaintiff incurred  no medical expenses.  However, counsel’s  declaration states that “[t]he settlement amount is triple the medical bills,”  suggesting Plaintiff incurred $5,000.00 in medical expenses.  In addition, in Section 13c(2), Petitioner  states that Medi-Cal paid for some or  all of Plaintiff’s medical expenses.  Section  8 of the petition states that Plaintiff received care and treatment at  Orthopedic Institute for the Children and St. John's Well Child & Family  Center.  Petitioner  must provide the information requested in Section 13a as well as supporting medical  records and medical bills.  The Court  cannot approve a petition unless it shows that all medical expenses that have  not been waived or reduced will be paid or reimbursed from the settlement proceeds.  The  Court denies the petition without prejudice.  CONCLUSION  The  Court DENIES without prejudice the petition for expedited approval of the compromise of minor Plaintiff Alex Polk’s claims filed by Petitioner Carla  Gipson.  Petitioner  is ordered to give notice of this ruling.  Petitioner  is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court within  five days.
