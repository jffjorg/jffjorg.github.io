 Case Number:  21STCV34149    Hearing Date:   August 14, 2024    Dept:  28 Having
considered the moving papers, the Court rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On September
16, 2021, Plaintiff Artur Yeghiazaryan, by and through his guardian ad litem
Davit Yeghiazaryan, filed this action
against Defendants Haroutyoun Harry Khardalyan (“Defendant”) and Does 1-20 for
motor vehicle tort and general negligence. 
On
October 12, 2021, the Court appointed Davit Yeghiazaryan as guardian ad litem
for Plaintiff Artur Yeghiazaryan. 
On May
10, 2022, Defendant filed an answer. 
At a
final status conference on March 2, 2023, counsel informed the Court that the
case had been settled.  However,
Plaintiff has not filed a notice of settlement. 
On
November 14, 2023, and April 9, 2024, the Court granted Plaintiff’s counsel’s
requests for a continuance to file a petition for minor’s compromise.  Plaintiff has not yet filed a petition for
minor’s compromise. 
On
June 17, 2024, Defendant filed a motion to enforce the settlement under Code of
Civil Procedure section 664.6 or, in the alternative, to dismiss the action
with prejudice.  The motion was set for
hearing on August 14, 2024.  Plaintiff
has not filed an opposition. 
On
July 11, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel asked for more time to file the petition to
approve minor’s compromise, saying he was having trouble communicating with
his client.  The Court set an order to
show cause re: dismissal (settlement) on October 15, 2024. 
PARTY’S REQUESTS 
Defendant
asks the Court to enforce the settlement under Code of Civil Procedure section
664.6 or, in the alternative, to dismiss the action with prejudice. 
LEGAL STANDARD                   
Code
of Civil Procedure section 664.6 provides in part: 
“(a) If parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a
writing signed by the parties outside of the presence of the court or orally
before the court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon
motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement. If
requested by the parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties to
enforce the settlement until performance in full of the terms of the
settlement. 
“(b) For purposes of this section, a writing is signed
by a party if it is signed by any of the following: 
“(1) The party. 
“(2) An attorney who represents the party. 
“(3) If the party is an insurer, an agent who is
authorized in writing by the insurer to sign on the insurer’s behalf.” 
(Code
Civ. Proc., § 664.6, subds. (a), (b).) 
In
deciding motions made under Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6, courts “must
determine whether the parties entered into a valid and binding
settlement.”  (Kohn v. Jaymar-Ruby
(1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 1530, 1533.)  On a
motion to enforce a settlement under Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6,
courts have the power to decide disputed facts and to interpret the
agreement.  (Fiore v. Alvord
(1985) 182 Cal.App.3d 561, 566; L. Edmon & C. Karnow, Cal. Practice Guide:
Civil Procedure Before Trial (Rutter 2023) ¶¶ 12:977–12:978.5, pp. 12(ll)-139
to 12(ll)-140.) Courts may receive evidence, determine disputed facts including
the terms the parties previously agreed on, and enter the terms of a settlement
agreement as a judgment, but they may not create new material terms. (Osumi
v. Sutton (2007) 151 Cal.App.4th 1355, 1360.) 
DISCUSSION 
A.   Motion to enforce settlement 
In
February 2023, the parties settled this matter for $50,000.00.  The settlement was conditioned on the Court’s
approval of a petition to approve minor’s compromise, which Plaintiff’s counsel agreed
to prepare.  The parties signed the
settlement agreement and release. 
The
release provides in part: 
“Releasers understand and agree that this Release is
dependent and binding upon the Court's approval of the petition for minors
compromise of ARTUR YEGHIAZARYAN of which counsel for ARTUR YEGHIAZARYAN will
prepare. Counsel for ARTUR YEGHIAZARYAN will provide all parties with the Order
approving the compromise of the minor. Payments will be made pursuant to the
instructions set forth in the Order approving the compromise of the minor.  Settlement proceeds will not be distributed
until the minors compromise of ARTUR YEGHIAZARYAN is approved by the Court.  Should the Court fail to approve the minors
compromise of ARTUR YEGHIAZARYAN, this Release is null and void.” 
By
its terms, the release is unenforceable until the Court approves the minor’s
compromise.  The Court has not received
or granted a petition to approve minor’s compromise.  Therefore,
the Court cannot enforce the settlement agreement.  The Court denies the motion to enforce the
settlement agreement. 
B.   Request to dismiss case 
In
the alternative, Defendant asks the Court to exercise its discretion to dismiss
the case for failure to prosecute.  The
Court declines to dismiss the case. 
However, the Court orders Plaintiff, within 30 days, to file (1) a
notice of settlement and (2) a petition to approve minor’s compromise. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court DENIES Defendant Haroutyoun Harry Khardalyan’s motion to enforce settlement
or, in the alternative, to dismiss the case. 
The
Court ORDERS Plaintiff Artur Yeghiazaryan, by and through his guardian ad litem
Davit Yeghiazaryan, to file a petition to approve minor’s compromise and notice
of settlement within 30 days of this order. 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Moving
party is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court
within five days.
