And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling is that the petition to approve the compromise of minor Plaintiff Daniel Espinosa's claims is denied without prejudice. The petition was filed by Petitioner Ma Luisa Huerta-Rangel, who is also the guardian ad litem for minor Plaintiff Daniel Espinosa. The petition was set for hearing on June 7, 2024, but the Court continued it to August 14, 2024.

The Court found that the petition contains several issues, including the use of a superseded version of Judicial Council Form MC-350, incomplete information, and apparent inconsistencies. The petition does not show that all medical expenses that have not been waived or reduced will be paid or reimbursed from the settlement proceeds.

The Court ordered Petitioner Ma Luisa Huerta-Rangel to resubmit the petition on the current version of Judicial Council Form MC-350, clarify the apparent inconsistencies, and complete the applicable portions of the form. The Court also denied the petition without prejudice, meaning that Petitioner may re-file the petition once the issues are addressed.
