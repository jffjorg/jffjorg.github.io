And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers in this case and rules as follows. The case involves a motor vehicle tort and exemplary damages lawsuit filed by Jazmin Torres Novoa and Ashley Gregorio against Franklin Windom and others. Windom filed a motion to compel Gregorio's attendance at an independent mental examination, which Gregorio opposes.

The judge finds that Windom has not shown exceptional circumstances to support the request for a mental examination, as required by Code of Civil Procedure section 2032.320. Although the parties have agreed to stipulate to the terms of Code of Civil Procedure section 2032.320, subdivisions (b) and (c), Windom has not explained why the statute should be construed to require an additional stipulation.

Therefore, the judge denies Windom's motion to compel Gregorio's mental examination. The judge orders Windom to give notice of this ruling and to file proof of service of this ruling with the Court within five days.
