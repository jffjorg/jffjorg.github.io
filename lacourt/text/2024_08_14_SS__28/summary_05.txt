And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has considered the petition for expedited approval of the compromise of minor plaintiff Alex Polk's claims. The petition was filed by Carla Gipson, the guardian ad litem for Alex Polk, and seeks approval of a settlement amount of $15,000.00. However, the Court notes that the petition lacks certain information, including a completed Section 13a, which suggests that Alex Polk incurred no medical expenses. The Court also notes that the settlement amount is triple the medical bills, which suggests that Alex Polk incurred $5,000.00 in medical expenses. Additionally, the petition states that Medi-Cal paid for some or all of Alex Polk's medical expenses. The Court cannot approve a petition unless it shows that all medical expenses that have not been waived or reduced will be paid or reimbursed from the settlement proceeds. Therefore, the Court denies the petition without prejudice, ordering Petitioner to provide the requested information and supporting medical records and medical bills.
