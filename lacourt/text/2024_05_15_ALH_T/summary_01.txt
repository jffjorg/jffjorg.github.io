Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the motion for summary judgment filed by the California Highway Patrol (CHP) and granted the motion. The court finds that the plaintiff's case rests entirely on proving that CHP employed the tow truck driver involved in the subject vehicle collision, and that the plaintiff cannot prove this as a matter of law or by operation of law under California's Freeway Service Patrol program. The court notes that CHP has no contract with the tow truck driver and that there is no evidence to conclude that CHP was the tow truck driver's general employer. The court also relies on State ex rel. Dept. of California Highway Patrol v. Superior Court (2015) 60 Cal.4th 1002, 1007, which held that the language of the Freeway Service Patrol statutory scheme alone does not support a finding that CHP was a special employer of FSP tow truck drivers. The court finds that the plaintiff has failed to allege a special employment relationship and that there is no evidence showing that CHP overstepped its role as established by the Freeway Service Patrol and thereby created a special employment relationship with Kenny's Auto and/or its driver. The court concludes that the plaintiff has failed to create a triable issue of material fact and the motion for summary judgment is granted.
