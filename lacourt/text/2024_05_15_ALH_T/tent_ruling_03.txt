Judgment
MOVING PARTY:                Defendant Anthony Pesce
RESPONDING PARTY:       None.
TENTATIVE RULING:        Greant
The court
considered the moving papers. No opposition papers have been received.
BACKGROUND
            Plaintiff Eddie Hernandez, a minor by and through his
guardian ad litem Alyssa Lyn Welch, (“Plaintiff”) initiated this action on
December 10, 2021 against Defendants Anthony Pesce (“Pesce”), Livia Tuberosi,
Victor Tuberosi (jointly, the “Tuberosis”), the Tuberosi Family Child Care
(“TFCC”) (collectively, “Defendants”), and Does 1 to 100, alleging the
following causes of action: (1) general negligence against Defendants; (2)
premise liability against Defendants; and (3) battery against Does 51-74
only.  As alleged in the complaint,
Plaintiff was injured on January 14, 2021 by another child while at child care
when he was struck in the eye with a beaded necklace. It is further alleged
that the Defendants failed to use reasonable care to prevent the harm that
occurred and did not comply with Health and Safety Code §§ 1597.30-1597.622.
Additionally, Defendants are alleged to have negligently owned and operated the
subject premises by failing to properly survived the children that attended the
day care. 
            On August 19, 2022, Plaintiff filed Amendments to
Complaint and added Frankie Vuoso, Jimmy Vuoso, and Nubia Dilorio as named
defendants. 
            On February 22, 2024, Pesce filed the instant motion for
summary judgment. No opposition has been received by the court. 
LEGAL STANDARD
A motion for summary judgment or adjudication
provides “courts with a mechanism to cut through the parties’ pleadings in
order to determine whether, despite their allegations, trial is in fact
necessary to resolve their dispute.”  (Aguilar
v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.)  It must be granted “if all the evidence
submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence’ and
uncontradicted by other inferences or evidence, show that there is no triable
issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment
as a matter of law.”¿ (Adler v. Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7
Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119, quoting Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (c).)  
A defendant moving for summary judgment
carries the initial “burden of showing that a cause of action has no merit” by
proving that “one or more elements of the cause of action, even if not
separately pleaded, cannot be established, or that there is a complete defense
to the cause of action.”  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 437c, subd. (p).)  “Once the
defendant . . . has met that burden, the burden shifts to the plaintiff . . .
to show that a triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to the
cause of action or a defense thereto.”  (Ibid.)  To establish a triable issue of material
fact, the opposing party must produce substantial responsive evidence.  (Sangster v. Paetkau (1998) 68
Cal.App.4th 151, 166.)  Courts “liberally
construe the evidence in support of the party opposing summary judgment and
resolve doubts concerning the evidence in favor of that party.”¿ (Dore v.
Arnold Worldwide, Inc. (2006) 39 Cal.4th 384, 389.)¿ 
DISCUSSION
            Pesce moves for summary judgment
against Plaintiff’s complaint on the ground Plaintiff is unable to present
evidence to support the elements of duty, breach and causation in order to
maintain his claims for negligence and premises liability against Pesce. (See
Notice of Motion at pg. 2.) 
A.   
Undisputed Material Facts
On January 14, 2021, Plaintiff was three
years old and attending the daycare, Tuberosi Family Care Center. (UMF No. 6;
Meininger Decl. ¶ 4, Exh. C, Plaintiff’s Response to Form Interrogatories No.
2.2; Meininger Decl. ¶ 5, Exh. D, Plaintiff’s Response to Special
Interrogatories, No. 4.) At the time of the incident, Defendant Frankie Vuoso
(“Frankie”) had struck Plaintiff in the eye with a beaded necklace. (UMF No. 7,
Meininger Decl. ¶ 5, Exh. D, Plaintiff’s Response to Special Interrogatories
Nos. 8, 12; Meininger Decl. ¶ 6, Exh. E, Defendant TFCC’s Response to Form
Interrogatories, Nos. 12.1, 12.6.) 
No one had witnessed the incident, and
Defendant Livia Tuberosi only became aware of Plaintiff’s injury when he
approached her in discomfort. (UMF Nos. 8-9; Meininger Decl. ¶ 5, Exh. D,
Plaintiff’s Response to Special Interrogatories Nos. 8, 12; Meininger Decl. ¶
6, Exh. E TFCC’s Response to Form Interrogatories, Nos. 12.1, 12.6; Meininger
Decl., ¶ 7, Exhibit F, the Tuberosis’ response to Form Interrogatories, Nos.
12.1, 12.6 Meininger Decl. ¶ 8, Exh. G, the Tuberosis’ response to Special
Interrogatories, Nos. 4-7.) 
Frankie’s parents, Defendants James Vuoso and
Nubia Dilorio, had dressed Frankie with the subject necklace, but Defendant
Livia Tuberosi did not see the subject necklace on Frankie when he arrived at
the daycare. (UMF No. 10-12; Meininger Decl. ¶ 5, Exh. D, Plaintiff’s Response
to Special Interrogatories, No. 8; Meininger Decl., ¶ 6, Exhibit E, TFCC’s
response to Form Interrogatories, No.16.1; Meininger Decl. ¶ 8, Exh. G, the
Tuberosis’ Response to Special Interrogatories, Nos. 1-2.) 
The subject daycare is located at 836 11th
Street in San Pedro, California, and it shares the same lot as a residence
located at 838 11th Street. (UMF No. 13; Meininger Decl. ¶ 9, Exh. H, Pesce
Depo, at pp. 5:22-7:11, 42:13-14.) Both residences are detached from one
another and separated by a gate. (UMF No. 14, Meininger Decl. ¶ 9, Exh. H,
Pesce Depo, at pp. 5:22-7:11.) Pesce has owned these properties since 1990.
(UMF No. 15; Pesce Decl. ¶2; Meininger Decl. ¶ 8, Exh. G, Pesce Depo at pp.
6:1-7:11.) Beginning in 2019, Pesce entered into an oral agreement with his
nephew, Defendant Victor Tuberosi wherein his nephew was permitted to use the 836
11th Street property without rent in exchange for taking care of Pesce in his
old age. (UMF Nos. 16-17; Pesce Decl. ¶ 3; Meininger Decl. ¶ 8, Exh. G, Pesce
Depo at pp. 7:12-25, 8:9-11, 12:23-13:3.) 
TFCC is owned and operated by Defendant Livia
Tuberosi, and she is responsible for maintaining the subject daycare. (UMF Nos.
18-19; Meininger Decl. ¶ 6, Exh. E, TFCC’s Response to Form Interrogatories No.
3.6; Meininger Decl. ¶ 8, Exh. G, the Tuberosis’ Response to Special
Interrogatories Nos. 4-7; Pesce Decl. ¶¶ 3-8.) Pesce is currently disabled and
spends most of his time in his home. (UMF No. 20; Meininger Decl., ¶ 9, Exhibit
H, Pesce Depo., at pp.  10:10- 11:21;
13:6-14:12.) 
Pesce is not involved with the operations of
the subject daycare and lacks knowledge of its affairs or who attends. (UMF
Nos. 21-24; Pesce Depo at pp. 12:10-14, 24:16-25:1, 24:16- 25:4; 26:12-28:1,
28:21-29:20, 29:25-30:5, 35:16-24, 36:2-4; Pesce Decl. ¶¶ 3-10.) Pesce knew of
Defendants Jimmy Vuoso and Nubia Diloria, but had not spoken to then in 10
years. (UMF No. 27; Meininger Decl., ¶ 9, Exhibit H, Pesce Depo., at pp. 24:2-14,
30:1-23, 33:2-34:10.) Prior to the incident, Pesce did not know of Frankie or that
he had any alleged behavior issues, assaultive propensities, or prior
altercations. (UMF Nos. 27, 29; Pesce Decl. ¶¶8-12.) Additionally, he had never
received complaints regarding Frankie or observe Frankie engage in any
altercations. (UMF Nos. 30-31; Pesce Decl. ¶¶ 8-12.) Pesce also did not supply
Frankie with the necklace, and he only learned of the incident from his nephew.
(UMF Nos. 32-33; Pesce Decl. ¶¶ 13-14; Meininger Decl., ¶ 9, Exhibit H, Pesce
Depo., 25:9-25.) 
B.    
Lack of Duty
Pesce moves for
summary judgment against Plaintiff’s claims for negligence and premises
liability on the ground that there are no triable issues of material fact
establishing he had duty to protect Plaintiff from the harm that occurred. 
The elements of a
cause of action for premises liability are the same as those for negligence:
duty, breach, causation, and damages.  (Castellon
v. U.S. Bancorp (2013) 220 Cal. App. 4th 994, 998.)  “Whether
a duty exists is a question of law to be resolved by the court.” (Brown v.
USA Taekwondo (2021) 11 Cal. 5th 204, 213; see Regents v. University of California v. Superior Court (2018) 4 Cal.5th 608, 620 [“The
determination whether a particular relationship supports a duty of care rests
on policy and is a question of law.”].)  “If there is no duty, there can be no
liability, no matter how easily one may have been able to prevent injury to
another.” (Margaret W. v. Kelley R. (2006) 139 Cal.App.4th 141, 150.)
“Under some circumstances, a defendant may have an affirmative duty to
protect the plaintiff from harm at the hands of a third party, even though the
risk of harm is not of the defendant's own making.” (Brown, supra, 11 Cal. 5th at 215.) “In particular, a person may
have an affirmative duty to protect the victim of another's harm if that person
is in what the law calls a ‘special relationship’ with either the victim or the
person who created the harm.” (Id. at 215.)
“In Brown the Supreme Court established a two-step inquiry to determine whether
a defendant has a legal duty to take action to protect a plaintiff from
injuries caused by a third party: ‘First, the court must determine whether
there exists a special relationship between the parties or some other set of
circumstances giving rise to an affirmative duty to protect. Second, if so, the
court must consult the factors described in [Rowland v. Christian (1968) 69 Cal.2d 108, 70
Cal.Rptr. 97, 443 P.2d 561 (Rowland)] to determine whether relevant policy considerations counsel limiting
that duty’.” (Doe v. Roman Cath. Archbishop of Los Angeles, 70 Cal. App. 5th 657, 670
[citing Brown,
supra, 11
Cal.5th at p. 209 and Regents, supra, 4 Cal.5th at p. 627 (special relationship
doctrine is an exception to the general rule that there is no duty to protect
others from the conduct of third parties)].)
Here, Pesce first
argues that there is no special relationship between him and the plaintiff
because he had no custody or control over the subject daycare where the
incident occurred.  (Motion at pg. 13;
UMF Nos. 14-19, 21-23.) Pesce concedes that he was the owner of the property
where the subject daycare is located. (UMF No. 15.) Those who own, possess, or
control property generally have a duty to exercise ordinary care in managing
the property in order to avoid exposing others to an unreasonable risk of
harm.  (Alcaraz v. Vece (1997) 14
Cal.4th 1149, 1156.) Nevertheless, based on the evidence presented by Pesce, the
inference has been created that Pesce has relinquished control of the residence
where the subject daycare operated from, which precludes the finding that he
owed a duty to a childcare attendee. (Nally v. Grace Community Church
(1988) 47 Cal.3d 278, 293 [determining that there is no duty “in the absence of
a special relationship of custody or control.”].)  For instance, Pesce is disabled, spending most
of his time in his private residence. (UMF No. 20.) Also, he has permitted his
nephew to use the residence located at 836 11th Street since 2019. (UMF No.
16.) Lastly, Pesce is not involved with the affairs of the subject daycare,
which is controlled by Defendant Livia Tuberosi. (UMF No. 18-19, 21-24.) Based
on this evidence, the court finds that there are no trial issues of material
fact to suggest there is a special relationship between Pesce and Plaintiff. 
Second, Pesce
argues that, even if Plaintiff could establish a special relationship, he would
still not owe a duty to Plaintiff because Pesce lacked actual knowledge of
Frankie’s alleged dangerous or violent propensities to show that the incident
was foreseeable. (Motion at pg. 14.) In this regard, Pesce has presented
evidence to show that he does not know Plaintiff or Frankie, and he had never
observed Frankie act aggressively towards others. (UMF Nos. 24, 26-27.)
Furthermore, he asserts that he had never heard a complaint regarding Frankie’s
behavior. (UMF No. 30.) 
Upon review of the
evidence, the court finds that Pesce has met his burden on this basis as well
to undermine the element of duty. In addition to establishing that a special
relationship exists, facts must be presented to show the defendant had actual
knowledge of the third-party’s propensity to cause harm. (Doe, supra, 37
Cal.App.5th at 682-683.) “Foreseeability, when analyzed to determine the existence
or scope of a duty, is a question of law to be decided by the court.” (Ann
M. v. Pacific Plaza Shopping Center (1993) 6 Cal.4th 666, 678.) In this
instance, the evidence presented by Pesce creates the inference that he lacked
actual knowledge of Frankie’s assaultive propensities.
Because Pesce has
met his burden in establishing that there are no triable issues of material
facts regarding whether there is a special relationship between the parties or
whether Pesce had actual knowledge of Frankie’s propensity to cause harm, the
burden now shifts to Plaintiff. (Code Civ. Proc. § 437c(p)(2).) However,
because Plaintiff has failed to file an opposition, he is unable to meet this
burden. 
Accordingly,
because Plaintiff is unable to establish the element of duty, Pesce’s motion
for summary judgment is granted on this ground. In the interest of judicial
economy, the court declines to address the remaining arguments presented in the
instant motion. 
CONCLUSION

Based on the
foregoing, the court GRANTS Defendant Anthony Pesce’s motion for summary
judgment. 
Defendant
Anthony Pesce is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO
ORDERED.
