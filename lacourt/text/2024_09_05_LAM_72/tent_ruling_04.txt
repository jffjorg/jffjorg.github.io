Defendant Board of Parole Hearings (“Defendant”) demurs to
the Complaint filed by Plaintiff Albert J Hamilton (“Plaintiff”).
 
The Court SUSTAINS the demurrer WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND.
 
Background
 
The Complaint appears to allege that, in 2003, Plaintiff was
treated as having a conviction for kidnapping under Penal Code, section 207. Plaintiff
alleges that he had no knowledge of such a conviction in 2003. Plaintiff
alleges that he did not learn that he had such a conviction until 2014.
Plaintiff appears to allege that there is no evidence supporting the kidnapping
conviction. Plaintiff alleges that he was assigned 14 points by Defendant in
determining his custody level. Materials submitted for judicial notice appear
to indicate that Defendant revoked Plaintiff’s parole due to the erroneous
kidnapping charge. (Defendant’s Request for Judicial Notice, Ex. 4 at p. 4.)
 
Plaintiff appears to allege that Defendant changed the
counts given by the Los Angeles District Attorney (“DA”) from Penal Code
sections 245(a) and 422 to Penal Code section 207.
 
Plaintiff filed this action on May 9, 2024. The form
complaint contains two pages dedicated to causes of action. The first cause of
action page is for negligence, wherein Plaintiff alleges that he was
erroneously convicted. The second cause of action page is for an intentional
tort and appears to be a claim for violation of Penal Code, section 4900 for an
incorrect conviction. The caption page of the Complaint also references the 8th
Amendment and the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution, which the
Court interprets as additional causes of action arising out of the same facts.
 
Request for Judicial Notice
 
The Court grants Plaintiff’s requests for judicial notice.
The Court takes notice of the Penal Code, section 4900 as a legislative
enactment of the State of California. The Court takes notice of the remaining
requested materials as public records. 
 
The Court grants Defendant’s request for judicial notice and
takes notice of the requested materials as public records.
 
Legal Standard
 
“The party against whom a complaint or cross-complaint has
been filed may object, by demurrer or answer as provided in Section 430.30, to
the pleading on any one or more of the following grounds:
 
(a) The court has
no jurisdiction of the subject of the cause of action alleged in the pleading.
(b) The person who filed the pleading does not have the
legal capacity to sue.
(c) There is
another action pending between the same parties on the same cause of action.
(d) There is a defect or misjoinder of parties.
(e) The pleading does not state facts sufficient to
constitute a cause of action.
(f) The pleading is
uncertain. As used in this subdivision, “uncertain” includes ambiguous and
unintelligible.
(g) In an action
founded upon a contract, it cannot be ascertained from the pleading whether the
contract is written, is oral, or is implied by conduct.
(h) No certificate was filed as required by Section 411.35.”
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10.)
 
As a general matter, in a demurrer proceeding, the defects
must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial
notice. (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins.
Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) “A demurrer tests the pleading
alone, and not the evidence or facts alleged.” (E-Fab, Inc. v. Accountants,
Inc. Servs. (2007) 153 Cal.App.4th 1308, 1315.) The court assumes the truth
of the complaint’s properly pleaded or implied factual allegations. (Ibid.) The only issue a demurrer is
concerned with is whether the complaint, as it stands, states a cause of
action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.)
 
Where a demurrer is sustained, leave to amend must be
allowed where there is a reasonable possibility of successful amendment. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335,
348.) The burden is on the plaintiff to show the court that a pleading can be
amended successfully. (Ibid.;
Lewis v. YouTube, LLC (2015) 244 Cal.App.4th 118, 226.) However, “[i]f
there is any reasonable possibility that the plaintiff can state a good cause
of action, it is error to sustain a demurrer without leave to amend.” (Youngman v. Nevada Irrigation Dist.
(1969) 70 Cal.2d 240, 245).
 
Discussion
 
Statute of Limitations as to Constitutional Claims
 
Defendant argues that Plaintiff’s claims are barred by the
statute of limitations.
 
The Court first analyses the statute of limitations with
respect to Plaintiff’s federal constitutional claims. 42 U.S.C. section 1983
authorizes civil actions for the deprivation of any rights secured by the
Constitution. (42 U.S.C. § 1983.) “Federal courts borrow from state law to
determine any applicable statute of limitations for § 1983 claims, including
tolling provisions.” (Lockett v. County of Los Angeles (9th Cir. 2020)
977 F.3d 737, 740.) Federal courts have determined that California’s 2-year
statute of limitations for personal injury actions applies to section 1983
claims. (Ibid, see also Code Civ. Proc., § 335.1.)
 
The Code of Civil Procedure provides for up to two years of
tolling for time when a person entitled to bring a claim is imprisoned on a
criminal charge or in execution of a sentence. (Code Civ. Proc., § 352.1.)
 
Plaintiff appears to allege that the underlying wrong
occurred in 2003. Plaintiff was released from custody on April 19, 2009.
(Complaint, Ex. J4.) Plaintiff alleges that he discovered the incorrect
conviction record in 2014.
 
Even allowing for a two-year tolling and a statute of
limitations running from 2014, Plaintiff’s constitutional claims are time
barred. At the very latest, Plaintiff would have had to file his claims by
2018. Plaintiff filed this action On May 9, 2024.
 
Plaintiff also argues that there is no statute of
limitations for the crime of kidnapping. However, this is not a criminal case
where the defendant is charged with kidnapping. This is a civil case where
Plaintiff alleges that his underlying kidnapping conviction was wrongful. The
statute of limitations for kidnapping is not controlling in this case.
 
 
 
The Court therefore sustains the demurrer without leave to
amend as to Plaintiff’s 8th Amendment and 14th Amendment claims.  Plaintiff has not demonstrated that he can solve
the statute of limitations problem by amendment.
 
Statute of Limitations as to Section 4900 Claim
 
The Court next analyzes Plaintiff’s claim under Section
4900.  “A claim under Section 4900,
accompanied by a statement of the facts constituting the claim, verified in the
manner provided for the verification of complaints in civil actions, is
required to be presented by the claimant to the California Victim Compensation
Board within a period of 10 years after judgment of acquittal, dismissal of
charges, pardon granted, or release from custody, whichever is later.” (Penal
Code, § 4901, subd. (a).)
 
The Court does not sustain the demurrer on statute of
limitations grounds with respect to Plaintiff’s section 4900 claim. That claim
has a 10-year statute of limitations which would end sometime in 2024.
Plaintiff does not allege when in 2014 he discovered that he was incorrectly
assigned a kidnapping conviction. The Court therefore cannot determine from the
face of the Complaint whether Plaintiff’s section 4900 claim is time-barred.
However, as discussed below, the Court finds that the section 4900 claim must
be brought in front of the California Victim Compensation Board, rather than
the Court.
 
Section 4900 Claim Generally
 
As stated above, “[a] claim under Section 4900, accompanied
by a statement of the facts constituting the claim, verified in the manner
provided for the verification of complaints in civil actions, is required to be
presented by the claimant to the California Victim Compensation Board within a
period of 10 years after judgment of acquittal, dismissal of charges, pardon
granted, or release from custody, whichever is later.” (Penal Code, § 4901,
subd. (a).)
 
Section 4900 does not state that a claimant has a right of
civil action. Rather, it provides that a wrongfully imprisoned person may
present a claim to the California Victim Compensation Board. Plaintiff must
therefore seek relief from the California Victim Compensation Board, rather
than from the Court.
 
The Court therefore sustains the demurrer to Plaintiff’s
section 4900 claim without leave to amend. Because the Court sustains the
demurrer to Plaintiff’s underlying section 4900 claim and constitutional
claims, it sustains the demurrer to Plaintiff’s negligence and intentional tort
claims without leave to amend.  Plaintiff
has not shown he can solve the problem of lack of a private cause of action by
amendment.
