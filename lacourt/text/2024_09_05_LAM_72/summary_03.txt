And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Petitioner, Pepe's Inc. DBA Pepe's Towing, is seeking an order to conduct discovery to preserve evidence relating to the medical records and employment records of the Respondent, Martin Alejandro Bernal Garcia. The Petitioner expects to be a defendant in an action relating to an automobile collision that occurred on December 23, 2023, and believes that the Respondent will be the adverse party in the litigation.

The Petitioner's counsel has attempted to meet and confer with the Respondent's counsel, but has been unable to obtain information about the Respondent's injuries and the scope and cost of medical treatment. The Petitioner has also requested that the Respondent provide a Medical Release Form/Authorization to obtain the relevant medical records, but this has not been provided.

The Court has reviewed the Petitioner's petition and has determined that the discovery sought is not necessary to prevent a failure or delay of justice. The Court notes that the State of California requires that medical records be retained for a minimum of 7 years and that employment records, including payroll records, be retained for at least 3 years. Additionally, the Court notes that the Petitioner has not provided adequate reasons for desiring to perpetuate testimony or preserve evidence before an action has been filed.

Therefore, the Court denies the Petitioner's petition for discovery.
