And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court is considering a petition to approve a compromise settlement of a habitability case on behalf of 59 plaintiffs, including 17 minors. The settlement amount is $2.95 million, with each plaintiff receiving $50,000 before attorney's fees and costs. Plaintiffs' counsel seeks a 45% contingency fee on the recovery of each minor plaintiff, but the court declines to approve this amount. Instead, the court is willing to approve a 30% contingency fee for each minor plaintiff. The court finds that the terms of the compromise are fair to the minors, except for the attorney's fees. Therefore, the court denies the request to approve the minors' compromise under the current terms.
