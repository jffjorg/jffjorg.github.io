Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has tentatively ruled that the demurrer filed by the Board of Parole Hearings (Defendant) is sustained without leave to amend. The Plaintiff, Albert J Hamilton, alleges that he was wrongly convicted of kidnapping in 2003 and that he did not learn of the conviction until 2014. The Judge finds that the Plaintiff's claims are barred by the statute of limitations for constitutional claims, and that the Plaintiff must seek relief from the California Victim Compensation Board rather than from the Court.

The Judge also finds that the Plaintiff's claim under Penal Code section 4900 is not properly brought in this Court, as it must be presented to the California Victim Compensation Board within 10 years of the underlying event. The Judge sustains the demurrer to the Plaintiff's section 4900 claim without leave to amend.

The Judge does not allow leave to amend the Plaintiff's complaint, as the Plaintiff has not demonstrated that he can overcome the statute of limitations issues or demonstrate a private cause of action. The case is set for a hearing on September 5, 2024.
