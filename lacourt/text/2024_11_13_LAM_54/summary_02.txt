And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion for monetary sanctions in the amount of $8,500.00 against the defendant, Shlomo Rechnitz. The defendant has repeatedly failed to appear for deposition, and the plaintiff has been inconvenienced as a result. The defendant has been ordered to appear for deposition within 15 days of notice of the ruling. The court has also awarded monetary sanctions against the defendant due to his abuse of the deposition process. The defendant will be given one more chance to appear for deposition, but if he fails again, the plaintiff may move for terminating sanctions.
