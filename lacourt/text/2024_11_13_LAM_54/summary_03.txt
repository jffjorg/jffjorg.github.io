And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the petitions filed by Hi Point Neighbors Association against the City of Los Angeles are dismissed as moot. The City had abandoned and voided the development approvals that were challenged in the petitions. The judge considered the arguments made by both sides, including the City's argument that the petitions are moot because there is no longer a controversy to be decided, and the Petitioner's argument that the City's practices are likely to reoccur and involve a broad public interest. The judge found that the Petitioner had not adequately shown that the issues in the petitions are likely to recur generally, and therefore dismissed the petitions.
