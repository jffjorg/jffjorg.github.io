And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has reviewed the petitions challenging the development approvals granted by the City of Los Angeles. The City has abandoned and voided the approvals, making the petitions moot. The Court has considered the arguments presented by both parties and has decided to dismiss the petitions. The Court agrees with the City that there is no longer a controversy to be decided and that any ruling would be hypothetical and theoretical. The Court finds that the Petitioner has not shown that the issues in these actions are likely to recur generally or that the issues will recur with this Real Party. Any decision in these cases would be pure advisory and limited to the facts of these petitions.
