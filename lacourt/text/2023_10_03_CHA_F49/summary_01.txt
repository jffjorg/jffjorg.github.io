The court finds that the proof of service is invalid and grants the motion to quash service.

## English Summary

This tentative ruling addresses a motion to quash service filed by attorneys Jennifer Morgan Craig-Ford and Suzanna Abrahamian in a lawsuit brought by Margarita Carranza.  

Carranza alleges that these attorneys, who represented her in a prior case against the County of Los Angeles, deducted unauthorized expenses from her settlement, leaving her with significantly less than she expected. She has filed multiple lawsuits against them alleging breach of contract, attorney misconduct, and fraud.

The attorneys argue that service of the lawsuit on them was improper. The court agrees, finding that the plaintiff's proofs of service did not demonstrate reasonable diligence in attempting to serve the attorneys before resorting to substituted service. 

Therefore, the court grants the motion to quash service, meaning the lawsuit against these specific defendants will be dismissed unless the plaintiff can properly serve them.

The judge finds that the plaintiff failed to establish valid service and grants the motion to quash service.
