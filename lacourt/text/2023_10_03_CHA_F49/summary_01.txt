Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the motion to quash service of the summons and complaint filed by defendants Jennifer Craig-Ford and Suzanna Abrahamian. The defendants, both attorneys, were added to the lawsuit through the second amended complaint. The plaintiff, Margarita Carranza, failed to establish valid statutory service of the summons and complaint. The proof of service lacks any indication of prior attempts to serve the defendants, and substituted service via service on the corporate entity, Martinian & Associates, was not properly executed. The court finds that the proof of service is invalid and grants the motion to quash service.
