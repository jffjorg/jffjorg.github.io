RESPONDING PARTY: Unoppsed/Plaintiff, Margarita Carranza,
pro per
 
RELIEF REQUESTED
Motion to Quash Service of the Summons and Complaint
 
SUMMARY OF ACTION
Defendants Martinian & Associates, et al. represented
Plaintiff Margrarita Carranza in an action against the County of Los Angeles,
et al. for Negligence, Government Tort Liability, and Premises Liability
(19STCV05567). According to Plaintiff the case settled for $50,000, which led
to a (contingency recovery) fee of $25,000. Plaintiff expected a net payment of
$25,000, but when presented with the final check, additional “expenses” were
also deducted, thereby leading to a net payment of “20K.” The expenses included
medical “liens,” which Plaintiff contends were never “authorized.” 
 
On September 29, 2022, Plaintiff, in pro per, filed a
complaint for Breach of Contract and General Negligence. On January 12, 2023,
Plaintiff, in pro per, filed a first amended complaint for “Attorney
Misconduct.” The first amended complaint contains a conformed copy of a
December 8, 2022, filed “Request to Re-Open Complaint,” as well as a Breach of
Contract, General Negligence, and Fraud attachments. 
 
On March 15, 2023, the court sustained the demurrer of
defendants to the first amended complaint for “Attorney Misconduct” with 30
days leave to amend. On May 12, 2023, Plaintiff, in pro per, filed a second
amended complaint for Fraud though the caption identifies additional causes of
action. On May 18, 2023, Plaintiff, in pro per, filed an “addendum” to the
second amended complaint again with only the fraud cause of action attachment
and additional exhibits, plus new allegations. 

 
On July 6, 2023, Plaintiff filed eight (8) requests for
dismissals for the following defendants: Robert Yaspan, Brian Kuhn, Fennia
Hakobyan, Sevana Vatazarian, Philip Craft, Ronald Whittaker, Jonathan Berger,
and D.A. Lucas.
 
RULING: Granted.
Defendants Jennifer Morgan Craig-Ford and Suzanna Abrahamian
move to quash service of the summons. Defendants, both identified as attorneys,
were both added to the action in the second amended complaint, though Suzanna
Abrahamian was initially identified in the first amended complaint albeit with
a hand interlineated strikethrough of the name.
 
Defendants move to quash on grounds of improper service.
Plaintiff filed two proofs of service on June 15, 2023, indicating substituted
service via service on the corporate entity, defendant Martinian &
Associates on the same date. On September 20, 2023, Plaintiff again filed two
proofs of service with copies of the June 15, 2023, filed proof of service
indicating service on June 15, 2023. 
 
A plaintiff has the initial burden to establish valid
statutory service of a summons and complaint. (Summers
v. McClanahan (2006) 140 Cal.App.4th 403,
413; Dill v. Berquist Const. Co.,
Inc. (1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 1426, 1439-40; Floveyor Internat. v. Sup. Ct. (1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 789, 794.) The
business address remains undisputed. Nevertheless,
the execution of substituted requires a showing reasonable diligence before
effectively executing substituted service. (Code Civ. Proc., 415.20, subd.
(b).) The proof of service lacks any indication of prior attempts. 
 
The proof of service is invalid.
The motion is granted.
 
No other scheduled items currently appear on the court
docket.
 
Moving parties to give notice.
