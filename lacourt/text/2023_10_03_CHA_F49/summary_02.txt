The settlement amounts are $9,000 for Bassam and $8,650 for Mram. After deducting medical expenses and attorney fees, the net balances are $4,122.89 for Bassam and $3,960.39 for Mram. Since the balances are below $5,000, they are payable to the parents. The judge orders the moving party to give notice of the ruling.
