## English Summary

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the plaintiff's petitions for approval of minors' compromises in this negligence case. 

The plaintiff, Nabil Khalil, is seeking approval for two separate settlements on behalf of his minor children, Bassam (16) and Mram (13), who were injured in a car accident with the defendant, Riley Runyon. 

The judge found that because the settlements for both minors are below $5,000, they can be paid directly to the parent, Nabil Khalil, according to California Probate Code.

The judge granted both petitions and ordered the moving party (the plaintiff) to provide notice.
