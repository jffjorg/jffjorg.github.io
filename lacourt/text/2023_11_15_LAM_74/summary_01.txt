And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the moving papers, opposition, and reply in the case of Rima Badalyan v. Starbucks Coffee Company, a motion to dismiss for delay in prosecution. The court denies the motion because it is untimely. A dismissal motion for delay in prosecution requires a special 45-day notice of hearing requirement, which was not met in this case. The proof of service indicates that the defendant waited until October 18, 2023, to serve the plaintiff with the notice of motion and motion, which exceeds the 45-day timeline. Therefore, the court denies the motion and orders the defendant to give notice of this ruling.
