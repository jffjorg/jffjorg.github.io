Motion to Dismiss

action arises from an employment dispute.
            On

Defendant Starbucks Coffee Company (Defendant). The complaint alleges
discrimination, failure to provide reasonable accommodation, failure to enter
into an interactive process, unlawful discharge, and wrongful termination in
violation of public policy.
            On
October 18, 2023, Defendant filed this motion to dismiss for delay in

date of this hearing is November 15, 2023. But the proof of service indicates
that Defendant waited until October 18, 2023, to serve Plaintiff with the
notice of motion and motion.
CONCLUSION 
Based
on the foregoing, the court denies this motion.
Defendant
shall give notice.
