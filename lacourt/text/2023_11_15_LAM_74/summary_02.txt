And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on Anabi Oil Corporation's demurrer to the 10th cause of action for declaratory relief in the cross-complaint filed by Huoy Quoc Dang and D.S. Dang, LLC. The judge has sustained the demurrer without leave to amend, finding that Dang's declaratory relief claim is unnecessary because it duplicates issues raised in the operative complaint and Dang's answer. The judge has concluded that the court's resolution of Anabi Oil Corporation's breach of contract claim will dispose of the issue of Dang's liability under the incentive agreement, making the declaratory relief claim redundant.
