  - Plaintiffs: filing a complaint and demurrers
  - Defendants: filing demurrers and a motion to strike
Significant Statements:
  - The Court previously sustained a demurrer to the first cause of action on the ground that Plaintiffs' constructive fraud claim consisted of conclusory and general statements of conduct by Defendants generally without alleging any specific fraud by the doctors or PSJHC providers.
  - Plaintiffs do not allege anything more specific here; again, their allegations simply take issue with the doctors' medical choices, which does not support a claim for constructive fraud.
  - The Court will allow Plaintiffs one final opportunity to plead a valid claim against Defendants.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrers filed by the defendants and the motion to strike filed by Dr. Beggs. The defendants have demurred to the first cause of action, alleging constructive fraud, and the judge has sustained their demurrers with 20 days' leave to amend. The judge has also denied Dr. Beggs' motion to strike as moot.

The judge has found that the plaintiffs have not alleged any specific fraud by the doctors or PSJHC providers, but rather have simply taken issue with the doctors' medical choices, which does not support a claim for constructive fraud. The judge has also found that the plaintiffs' claims are barred by the Federal Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act (PREP Act), which provides immunity to covered persons, including the defendants, for claims arising out of the administration of countermeasures to COVID-19.

The judge has given the plaintiffs one final opportunity to plead a valid claim against the defendants, and has allowed them 20 days to amend their complaint. The judge's ruling is subject to change after the defendants have had an opportunity to respond and the court has considered the matter further.
