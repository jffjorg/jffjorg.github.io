MOVING
PARTY:  Defendants B&B Stables;
Robert D. Buell and Mary D. Buell (“Ms. Buell”), (collectively, “Defendants”)
RESPONDING PARTY: Plaintiff
Ronda Jones (“Plaintiff”)
 
            The Court has considered the moving,
opposition and reply papers. 
 
BACKGROUND
            This is a civil rights and
discrimination action in which Plaintiff alleges she was treated differently
based on her race and was evicted from a stable despite tendering full monthly
payment of her stable rent. Plaintiff filed this action on September 6, 2023. On
August 19, 2024, Plaintiff filed the operative first amended complaint (the
“FAC”) alleging cause of action for: (1) Violation of Civil Rights [Unruh Act,
Civil Code § 51]; (2) Violation of the Business and Professions Code [§17200,
et seq.]; (3) Breach of Contract; and (4) Intentional Infliction of Emotional
Distress.  
 
            On
October 1, 2024, Defendants filed the instant demurrer (the “Demurrer) to each
of the four causes of action stated in the FAC on the grounds that they fail to
state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, are uncertain and/or
are barred by the statute of limitations.  
 
            On December 10, 2024, Plaintiff
filed an opposition to the Demurrer (the “Opposition”). On December 16, 2024, Defendants
filed a reply (the “Reply”). 
 
EVIDENTIARY
OBJECTIONS 
            Defendants
object to the Declaration of Ronda Jones which was filed in support of
Plaintiff’s Opposition. 
 
            Defendants’
objections are SUSTAINED. The defects in a complaint are not properly cured by
a declaration in opposition to a demurrer. (Allred v. Bekins Wide World Van
Services (1975) 45 Cal.App.3d 984, 993.) 
 
JUDICIAL NOTICE 
             The Court can only take judicial notice of the
matters specified under Evidence Code section 452 or required under Evidence
Code section 451. (Evidence Code (“Evid. Code”), §§ 450-452.) 
 
To the extent an item is judicially
noticeable, the Court may not take judicial notice of the truth of the contents
of the documents. (Herrera v. Deutsche Bank National Trust Co. (2011)
196 Cal.App.4th 1366, 1375.) Documents are only judicially noticeable to show
their existence and what orders were made such that the truth of the facts and
findings within the documents are not judicially noticeable. (Lockley v. Law
Office of Cantrell, Green, Pekich, Cruz & McCort (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th
875, 885.)      
 
            Pursuant to Defendants’ request, the
Court takes judicial notice of the California Secretary of State filing of the
Articles of Organization for Young Voices Making Choices LLC. (Defendants’
Request for Judicial Notice (“RJN”) No. 5; Evid. Code 452 subd. (h).) The Court
takes judicial notice only to the extent of the document’s existence. 
 
            The Court does not take judicial
notice of Defendants’ remaining requests or of Plaintiff’s request, because
none of the matters are judicially noticeable under Evidence Code sections 451
or 452. (see Defendants’ RJN Nos. 1-4; Plaintiff’s RJN; Evid. Code §§ 451-452.)
 
MEET AND CONFER 
             The parties have satisfied the meet and confer
requirement. 
 
DISCUSSION
            A demurrer for sufficiency tests
whether the complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007)
147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747; see Code of Civil Procedure (“CCP”) § 430.10, subd.
(e).) 
 
To sufficiently allege a cause of action,
a complaint must allege all the ultimate facts—that is, the facts needed to
establish each element of the cause of action pleaded. (Committee on
Children’s Television, Inc. v. General Foods Corp. (1983) 35 Cal.3d 197,
212, superseded by statute as stated in Branick v. Downey Savings & Loan
Assn. (2006) 39 Cal.4th 235, 242.) “[E]ach evidentiary fact that might
eventually form part of the plaintiff’s proof need not be alleged.” (C.A. v.
William S. Hart Union High School Dist. (2012) 53 Cal.4th 861, 872.) 
 
In testing the sufficiency of the cause of
action, the demurrer admits the truth of all material facts properly pleaded. (Aubry
v. Tri-City Hospital Dist. (1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 966-67.) Courts read the
allegations liberally and in context. (Taylor v. City of Los Angeles Dept.
of Water and Power (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1228, disapproved on other
grounds, Jones v. Lodge at Torrey Pines Partnership (2008) 42 Cal.4th
1158, 1162.) A demurrer, however, “does not admit contentions, deductions or
conclusions of fact or law.” (Daar v. Yellow Cab Co. (1967) 67 Cal.2d
695, 713.)  
 
A demurrer for uncertainty lies where the
pleading is uncertain, ambiguous, or unintelligible. (CCP, § 430.10, subd.
(f).)
 
“A demurrer for uncertainty is strictly
construed, even where a complaint is in some respects uncertain, because
ambiguities can be clarified under modern discovery procedures.” (Khoury v.
Maly’s of California, Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616, disapproved on
other grounds in Quelimane Co. v. Stewart Title Guar. Co. (1998) 19
Cal.4th 26, 46 [holding claims for unfair business practices need not be pled
specifically, impliedly disapproving Khoury].) As a result, a special
demurrer for uncertainty is not intended to reach failure to incorporate
sufficient facts in the pleading but is directed only at uncertainty existing
in the allegations already made. (People v. Taliaferro (1957) 149
Cal.App.2d 822, 825, disapproved on other grounds in Jefferson v. J.E.
French Co. (1960) 54 Cal.2d 717, 719-720 [statute of limitations
question].) 
 
Where a complaint is sufficient to state a
cause of action and to apprise a defendant of issues he is to meet, it is not
properly subject to a special demurrer for uncertainty. (Gressley v.
Williams (1961) 193 Cal.App.2d 636, 643 [“A special demurrer [for
uncertainty] should be overruled where the allegations of the complaint are
sufficiently clear to apprise the defendant of the issues which he is to
meet”].) 
 
First Cause of
Action – Violation of Unruh Act Civil
Code § 51
A discrimination claim under the Unruh Civil
Rights Act (“UCRA”) must be brought within two years of the alleged
discrimination. (Gatto v. County of Sonoma (2002) 98 Cal.App.4th
744, 760; Code of Civil Procedure (“CCP”) § 335.1.) Plaintiff alleges that she
began stabling her horse with Defendants in June 2020 and was wrongfully
evicted “within another few weeks” or “relatively soon after” May 2021.  (FAC ¶¶ 10, 16, 19, 22) Plaintiff filed this
action on September 6, 2023. Although the exact date of Plaintiff’s alleged
wrongful eviction is not clear, from the face of the FAC, it appears that it was
more than two years prior to Plaintiff filing this action. Thus, Plaintiff’s
UCRA cause of action pertaining to alleged discrimination during her tenancy at
the stables appears to be barred by the statute of limitations. 
 
Accordingly, Defendants’ Demurrer to the
first cause of action is SUSTAINED, with thirty days leave to amend. 
 
Second
Cause of Action – Violation of
Business and Professions Code §§ 17200, et seq.
The Unfair Competition
Law (“UCL”) prohibits “any unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business act or
practice.” (Business and Professions Code (“Bus. & Prof. Code”) § 17200; Clark v. Superior Court (2010) 50 Cal.4th 605, 610.) 
“An unlawful business practice or act is an act or practice, committed
pursuant to business activity, that is at the same time forbidden by law.” (Klein v. Earth Elements, Inc. (1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 965, 969.) A violation of other laws is deemed
independently actionable under the UCL. (Law
Offices of Mathew Higbee v. Expungement Assistance Services (2013) 214 Cal.App.4th 544, 554.) 
 
Plaintiff states
that Defendants’ violations of the UCRA “serve as the borrowed statute to which
Plaintiff brings forth her UCL claim.” (Opp. p. 12:21-24.)  Thus, Plaintiff must establish each element of
the UCRA in order to state facts sufficient to allege her UCL claim. 
 
The necessary
elements for a discrimination claim under the UCRA are: (1) that the defendant
was a business establishment; (2) that the defendant intentionally denied the
plaintiff full and equal accommodations, advantages, facilities, privileges, or
services; and (3) that the denial was based on the plaintiff’s sex, race,
color, religion, ancestry, national origin, disability, medical condition,
marital status, or sexual orientation.  (Civil Code (“Civ. Code”), § 51 subd. (b); Payne v. Anaheim
Memorial Medical Center, Inc. (2005) 130 Cal.App.4th 729, 746.) 
 
Plaintiff
alleges that during her initial tour of the stables, Ms. Buell stated that she
has “an affinity toward Blacks” which Plaintiff argues was said “to conceal
what was in fact an animus toward African-Americans.” (FAC ¶ 11) Plaintiff
alleges that Defendants’ “animus toward African-Americans was demonstrated in
its discriminatory naming of different areas of the stables to reflect racially
stereotypical neighborhoods according to race” and that she and her daughter were
told they had to wash their horses in the “South Central” wash area of the
stables. (FAC ¶¶ 12-14) Plaintiff alleges that Defendants “did not like the
fact that [Plaintiff], an African-American woman, now owned the most valuable
horse at B&B and sought to taker her horse and end her tenancy at B&B.”
(FAC ¶ 18) Plaintiff also alleges that Defendants told Plaintiff’s daughter
that they were in ‘trouble’ and would be evicted soon and that they were
subsequently wrongfully evicted. (FAC ¶¶ 19, 22)
 
The Court
disagrees with Plaintiff that this is sufficient to show that Defendants
engaged in discrimination. Plaintiff does not allege that other tenants who are
similarly situated but are not African-American were told they could use the
other wash areas of the stable or were otherwise treated differently. As to
Plaintiff’s allegations that Defendants did not like that she owned ‘the most
valuable horse at B&B’ and implied that she should not be able to afford a new
truck because of her race, this is insufficient to constitute actionable
discrimination under the UCRA. Plaintiff does not show that her eviction from
the stables was on account of her race. Plaintiffs merely allege, in a
conclusory way, that her eviction from the stables was motivated by Defendants’
perception of her race. This, without more, is insufficient to state a UCRA
cause of action, and thus, her UCL claim fails as well. 
 
Moreover, if
the UCRA claim is barred by the statute of limitations, because it is the sole
basis for the alleged UCL claim, this UCL claim lacks an actionable basis. 
 
Accordingly, Defendants’ Demurrer to the
second cause of action is SUSTAINED, with thirty days leave to amend. 
 
Third Cause of
Action – Breach of Contract
“To establish a
cause of action for breach of contract, the plaintiff must plead and prove (1)
the existence of the contract, (2) the plaintiff’s performance or excuse for
nonperformance, (3) the defendant’s breach, and (4) resulting damages to the
plaintiff.  [Citation.]” (Maxwell v. Dolezal (2014) 231
Cal.App.4th 93, 97-98.) “If the action is based on an alleged breach of a
written contract, the terms must be set out verbatim in the body of the
complaint or a copy of the written agreement must be attached and incorporated
by reference.” (Harris v. Rudin, Richman & Appel (1999) 74 
Cal.App.4th 229, 307.) “A written contract may be pleaded either by its terms –
set out verbatim in the complaint or a copy of the contract attached to the
complaint and incorporated therein by reference – or by its legal effect.
[Citations.] In order to plead a contract by its legal effect, plaintiff must
‘allege the substance of its relevant terms. This is more difficult, for it
requires a careful analysis of the instrument, comprehensiveness in statement,
and avoidance of legal conclusions.’ [Citation.]” (McKell v. Washington
Mutual, Inc. (2006) 142 Cal.App.4th 1457, 1489.) “The elements of a breach
of oral contract are the same as those for breach of a written contract.
[Citations.]” (Stockton Mortgage, Inc. v. Tope (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th
437, 453.
 
Plaintiff
states that “around June 2020, [she] entered into a contract with Defendants to
stable her and her daughter’s horses at B&B Stables for a set monthly
rate.” (FAC ¶ 34) Plaintiff neither attaches a copy of this contract to the FAC
nor sets out the substance of the contract’s relative terms in the FAC. To the
extent Plaintiff seeks to submit the alleged contract through her request for
judicial notice, the Court notes that this is procedurally improper, as
judicial notice is limited to matters explicitly identified in the Evidence
Code, which does not include disputed contracts. The Court further notes that
even had the alleged contract been properly before the Court, the Court is not
convinced that it is evidence of the necessary elements of an enforceable
contract or that the alleged breach constitutes an enforceable breach of that
alleged contract.  
 
Thus, among
other things, Plaintiff’s breach of contract cause of action fails to state a
valid cause of action and is impermissibly vague and uncertain, leaving
Defendants unable to determine which specific provisions or terms of the
contract are alleged to have been breached. 
Accordingly, Defendants’ Demurrer to the
third cause of action is SUSTAINED, with thirty days leave to amend. 
 
Fourth Cause of
Action – Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress 
“A cause of
action for intentional infliction of emotional distress exists when there is
‘(1) extreme and outrageous conduct by the defendant with the intention of
causing, or reckless disregard of the probability of causing, emotional
distress; (2) the plaintiff’s suffering severe or extreme emotional distress;
and (3) actual and proximate causation of the emotional distress by the
defendant’s outrageous conduct.’ A defendant’s conduct is ‘outrageous’ when it
is so ‘extreme as to exceed all bounds of that usually tolerated in a civilized
community.’ And the defendant’s conduct must be ‘intended to inflict injury or
engaged in with the realization that injury will result.’” (Hughes v. Pair (2009) 46
Cal.4th 1035, 1050-1051.) 
 
            The
actions of Defendants, as summarized above, fail to meet the threshold of extreme
or outrageous conduct. Moreover, Plaintiff has not presented facts
demonstrating that Defendants acted with the intent to cause emotional distress
or with reckless disregard for the likelihood of causing such distress.
Additionally, Plaintiff has only made conclusory assertions, without supporting
facts, that she has suffered severe or extreme emotional distress.
 
            In
addition, the Court notes that the statute of limitations for a cause of action
for intentional infliction of emotional distress is two years (CCP §335.1) and
therefore it appears that this cause of action may also be barred by the
statute of limitations.
 
Accordingly, Defendants’ Demurrer to the
fourth cause of action is SUSTAINED, with thirty days leave to amend. 
ORDER
            Defendants’ Demurrer to the FAC’s
first through fourth causes of action are SUSTAINED with thirty days leave to
amend.
