MOVING PARTY:  Plaintiff Jose Oliveras (“Plaintiff”) 
RESPONDING PARTY: None

 
            The Court has considered the moving papers.
No opposition or reply has been filed. 
 


 
BACKGROUND
            This is an unlawful detainer action.
 On September 9, 2024, Plaintiff filed
the operative complaint (“Complaint”) against defendants Felipe Pena and
Griselda Pena, (collectively “Defendants”). 
 
            On October 14, 2024, Plaintiff
filed: (1) a motion to compel responses to special interrogatories (“SIs”); (2)
a motion to compel responses to requests for inspection and copying (“RFPs”);
and (3) a motion to deem requests for admissions admitted (“RFAs”)
(collectively, the “Motions”). 
 
PROCEDURAL
DEFICIENCIES
            The Court
notes that the Motions are procedurally defective because they are directed to
both Defendants. Motions to compel should be submitted as separate motions for
each discovery device and directed separately to each defendant. Plaintiff has
improperly joined six motions into three. The Court elects not to deny the
Motions on this ground alone but requires Plaintiff’s counsel to pay the
additional filing fees ($60.00 per each unfiled motion, for a total of $180.00)
to the Court. Counsel is cautioned against misjoinder in the future.  
 
DISCUSSION
A motion to compel an initial response can
be made on the ground that a party did not serve a timely response to
interrogatories or a demand to produce. (Code Civil Procedure “CCP”) §§
2030.290, subd. (a) [interrogatories], 2031.300, subd. (a) [demand to produce];
Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants
(2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 404.)  The
discovering party can also make a motion to deem as admitted any unanswered
requests for admission or any requests answered in a late or unverified
response. (CCP § 2033.280, subd. (b); CCP, § 2033.240, subd. (a) [RFA responses
must be signed by responding party under oath]; Appleton v. Superior Court
(1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 632, 636 [unsworn response to RFAs is treated like no
response].) These requests are not automatically deemed admitted; the discovering
party must make the motion. (CCP § 2033.280, subd. (b).)
 
To establish this ground, a movant must
show:
(1) Proper service (CCP §§ 2030.080, subd.
(a) [interrogatories], 2031.040 [demand to produce]); § 2033.070 [requests for
admission])
(2) Expiration of the deadline for the
initial response 5 days after service or on date agreed to by parties (CCP §§
2030.260, subds. (a), (b) [interrogatories], 2031.260, subds. (a), (b) [demand
to produce] 2033.250, subds. (a), (b) [requests for admission]); and
(3) No timely response. (CCP §§ 2030.290
[interrogatories], 2031.300 [demand to produce] § 2033.280, subd. (b) [requests
for admission])
 
A court must deny a motion to compel initial
discovery where the discovery sought is outside the scope of discovery. (CBS,
Inc. v. Superior Court (1968) 263 Cal.App.2d 12, 19; CCP § 2017.010 [scope
of discovery].)
 
            The SIs, RFPs and RFAs were served
via FedEx overnight on September 25, 2024. (All Mots., Block Decl. ¶ 2, Exs. 1-2.)
The deadline to respond was 5 days after service, plus two court days for overnight
mail. (CCP §§ 2030.260 subd. (b), 2031.260 subd. (b), 2033.250, subd. (b) [discovery
responses due 5 days from the date of service in unlawful detainer actions], CCP
§ 1013 subd. (a)(3)(B) [2 court days for overnight mail].) Thus responses to
the discovery were due on October 2, 2024. As of the date of the hearing on
these motions, there is no evidence before the Court that Defendants have
responded to the discovery requests. Thus, the Motions are GRANTED. 
 
Request for
Sanctions 
The Court must impose monetary sanctions
against anyone—party, nonparty, or attorney—who unsuccessfully makes or opposes
the motion, unless it finds that the person to be sanctioned acted with
substantial justification or other circumstances make the imposition of the
sanctions unjust. (CCP §§ 2030.290, subd. (c) [interrogatories], 2031.300,
subd. (c) [demand to produce]; Sinaiko, supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at
404 [interrogatories and demand to produce].)
 
The Court must award sanctions when a
party’s response to request for admissions is untimely, and the discovering
party makes a motion to deem the requests admitted. (CCP, § 2033.280, subd.
(c); Appleton, supra, 206 Cal.App.3d at 635-636 [sanctions are
mandatory].)
 
The court may award sanctions under the
Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery, even
though no opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to the motion was
withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party after
the motion was filed. (Rules of Court, rule 3.1348, subd. (a).)
 
Even after a party provides discovery
responses, a party can keep its motion on calendar and the court has authority
to grant sanctions, even if it denies the motion to compel responses “as
essentially unnecessary, in whole or in part.” (Sinaiko, supra, 148
Cal.App.4th at 409.)
 
             Plaintiff
requests sanctions for the motion to compel responses to SIs against Defendants
in the total amount of $960.00 based upon counsel’s rate of $450/hour for: (1)
1.0 hour to prepare the motion; (2) 1.0 hour to appear at the hearing; and (3)
$60.00 in filing fees. (All Mots., Sales Decl. ¶ 8.) The request for sanctions
is GRANTED in the total amount of $960.00.
 
            Plaintiff requests sanctions for the motion
to compel responses to RFPs against Defendants in the total amount of $960.00
based upon counsel’s rate of $450/hour for: (1) 1.0 hour to prepare the motion;
(2) 1.0 hour to appear at the hearing; and (3) $60.00 in filing fees. (All
Mots., Sales Decl. ¶ 8.) As the time spent to appear at the hearing for this
motion is duplicative of the other motions, a 1.0 hour reduction is
appropriate. Thus, the request for sanctions is GRANTED in the reduced amount
of $510.00.
 
Plaintiff requests sanctions for the motion
to deem RFAs admitted against Defendants in the total amount of $960.00 based
upon counsel’s rate of $450/hour for: (1) 1.0 hour to prepare the motion; (2)
1.0 hour to appear at the hearing; and (3) $60.00 in filing fees. (All Mots.,
Sales Decl. ¶ 8.) As the time spent to appear at the hearing for this motion is
duplicative of the other motions, a 1.0 hour reduction is appropriate. Thus,
the request for sanctions is GRANTED in the reduced amount of $510.00.
