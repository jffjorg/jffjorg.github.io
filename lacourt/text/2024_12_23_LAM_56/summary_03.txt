Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the plaintiff's motions to compel responses to special interrogatories, requests for production of documents, and requests for admissions. The plaintiff has filed three motions, which are procedurally defective because they are directed to both defendants. However, the judge elects not to deny the motions on this ground alone and instead requires the plaintiff's counsel to pay the additional filing fees.

The judge grants the motions to compel responses to discovery requests and requests for admissions, finding that the defendants have not responded to the discovery requests. The judge orders the defendants to serve full, Code-compliant, verified responses, without objections, within 20 days.

The judge also orders the defendants to pay sanctions to the plaintiff in the total amount of $1,980.00 within 20 days. Additionally, the judge orders the plaintiff to pay the outstanding filing fees of $180.00 to the Court within 20 days.

The judge's tentative ruling is subject to change based on any opposition or reply that may be filed by the parties.
