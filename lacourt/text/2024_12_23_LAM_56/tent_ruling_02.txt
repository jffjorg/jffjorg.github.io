  CASE NO.:  23STCV25701
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER RE: 
MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES TO
  REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS
 
Date: December 23, 2024
Time: 8:30 a.m.
Dept. 56
 
 



 
MOVING PARTY:  Defendant Djavid Hakakian (“Defendant”) 
RESPONDING PARTY: Plaintiff
Avraham Hassid (“Plaintiff”) 
 
            The Court has considered the moving,
opposition and reply papers. 
 
BACKGROUND
            This is a breach of contract action.
On October 20, 2023, Plaintiff filed a complaint against Defendant and Does 1
through 50. Plaintiff filed the operative first amended complaint (the “FAC”)
on February 20, 2024 alleging causes of action for: (1) breach of contract; and
(2) promissory estoppel. 
 
            On November 4, 2024, Defendant filed
the instant motion to compel further responses to requests for production of
documents (“RFPs”) and request for monetary sanctions (the “Motion”). On
December 10, 2024, Plaintiff filed an opposition to the Motion (the
“Opposition”) and on December 16, 2024, Defendant replied (the “Reply”).  
 
            Defendant also filed a Supplemental
Declaration on December 16. The Court declines to consider it, as it
constitutes improperly submitted new arguments on reply, thereby violating the
Plaintiff’s due process right to respond.
 
MEET AND CONFER 
             The parties satisfied the meet and confer
requirement. 
 
DISCUSSION
            A motion to compel a further response
is used when a party gives unsatisfactory answers or makes untenable objections
to interrogatories, demands to produce, or requests for admission. (Code of Civil
Procedure (“CCP”), § 2031.310, subd. (a); Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting,
Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 403.)
 
To request further production, a movant
must establish: (1) good cause for the production (CCP, § 2031.310, subd.
(b)(1); Sinaiko, supra, at p. 403); and (2) that a further
response is needed because (a) the responding party’s statement of compliance
with the demand to produce is incomplete CCP, § 2031.310, subd. (a)(1)), (b)
the responding party’s representation that it is unable to comply is
inadequate, incomplete, or evasive (CCP, § 2031.310, subd. (a)(2)), (c) the
responding party’s objection in the response is without merit or is too general
(CCP, § 2031.310, subd. (a)(3); Catalina Island Yacht Club v. Superior Court
(2015) 242 Cal.App.4th 1116, 1127), or (d) if the responding party objected to
the production of ESI on the ground that it is not reasonably accessible the
movant can show that the (i) ESI is reasonably accessible or (ii) there is good
cause for production of the ESI regardless of its accessibility (CCP, §
2031.310, subd. (e)).
 
            Defendant
seeks to compel further response to RFPs, set one, Nos. 4, 5, 8, 10, 11 and 12.
Specifically, Defendant seeks to compel Plaintiff to provide a settlement
agreement between Plaintiff and third-party Abraham Assil (the “Settlement Agreement”).
Plaintiff and Defendant entered into an agreement to settle litigation which
included a provision in which Defendant agreed to deposit certain funds with a mutual
friend. (FAC ¶ 7) Plaintiff alleges that in reliance on that promise, he
entered into the Settlement Agreement with Assil. (FAC ¶ 8) Defendant argues
that the Settlement Agreement and related communications pertaining to it, are therefore
relevant discovery to which they are entitled. (Mot. p. 4:17-28)
 
            In opposition, Plaintiff argues that
the Settlement Agreement was made pursuant to a confidential mediation and contains
a confidentiality clause. (Opp. p. 1:6-8.) Plaintiff asserts that he cannot
disclose the Settlement Agreement or any related communications without the
consent of the third-party signatories, who have not consented to the
disclosure. (Opp. p. 1:8-13.)
 
            In this case, the Court agrees that
the Settlement Agreement is relevant because the Plaintiff alleges in the FAC
that he only entered into the Settlement Agreement based upon Defendant's
promise to deposit potential settlement funds with a mutual friend. Thus, the
amount, terms and conditions of the Settlement Agreement are relevant to Plaintiff’s
contention. Considering the compelling privacy rights of the other parties to
the Settlement Agreement, who are not parties to this litigation, the Court
will grant Defendant’s motion to produce the Settlement Agreement with the
condition that the parties submit a confidentiality stipulation that the
Settlement Agreement shall only be used in this action. 
 
            Thus, Defendant’s Motion to compel
further responses is GRANTED as to RFP Nos. 8, 10, 11, and 12. The Motion is
DENIED, as moot, as to RFP Nos. 4 and 5. 
 
Request for
Sanctions
Except in certain circumstances involving
electronic stored information, the court must impose a monetary sanction under Chapter
7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel further response to a
demand, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust. (CCP, § 2031.310, subd. (h).)
 
The court may award sanctions under the
Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery, even
though no opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to the motion was
withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party after
the motion was filed. (Rules of Court, rule 3.1348, subd. (a).)
 
Defendant requests sanctions for the
motion to compel further responses to RFPs against Plaintiff in the total
amount of $11,425.76 based upon counsel’s rate of $550/hour for: (1) 2.9 hours
meeting and conferring with opposing counsel; (2) 1.4 hours for the Informal
Discovery Conference (“IDC”); (3) 14.8 hours drafting the instant Motion and
accompanying documents; (4) 1.5 hours preparing for and attending the hearing
on this matter; and (5) $95.76 in filing fees for the IDC and Motion. (Mot., Lebedev
Decl. ¶ 27.) The Court does not award sanctions based upon either meet and
confer efforts or participation in an IDC and finds the amount of time claimed
to have been consumer in preparing this Motion is excessive, and that the time
to attend the hearing is also excessive. 
The Court also only awards the actual Court filing fee of $60 for the
Motion.  The Court therefore finds reasonable
sanctions to be in the amount of four hours at $550 per hour, plus the $60
filing fee, for a total of $2,260 and the request for sanctions is GRANTED in
the reduced amount of $2,260.00. 
 
            Thus, Defendant’s Motion to compel
further responses is GRANTED as to RFP Nos. 8, 10, 11, and 12. The Motion is
DENIED, as moot, as to RFP Nos. 4 and 5. The parties shall submit a stipulated
Protective Order in the form for Confidential Documents on the Court’s website
within twenty days of the date of this order. 
Once the stipulated Protective Order is submitted to the Court, the
parties are to so inform the Court of its submission so that the Court can sign
it as soon as possible after submission. 
The documents ordered to be served as set forth above shall be produced
within ten days of the date of the signing of the Protective Order.  
 
            Defendant is ordered to pay
sanctions in the total amount of $2,260.00 to Plaintiff within 20 days of this
order. 
 
Moving
Party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.            
 


 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed
by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive an email
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off
calendar.
 
Dated this 23rd day of December 2024
