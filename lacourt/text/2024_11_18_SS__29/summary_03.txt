And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to compel the deposition of the plaintiff's expert witness, Colin Smith. The plaintiff had designated Smith as an expert witness, but failed to produce him for deposition despite multiple attempts by the defendant to schedule the deposition. The defendant tendered the required expert witness fee and showed that it had given proper notice of the deposition. The plaintiff's objections to the deposition were untimely and not served in a timely manner. The judge finds that the defendant has shown good cause for the production of the expert witness and orders the plaintiff to produce Smith for deposition within 10 days of notice.
