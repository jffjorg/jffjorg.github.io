The judge has granted the defendant's motion to compel the plaintiff to respond to supplemental interrogatories and request for production of documents. The plaintiff failed to respond to the discovery requests despite multiple extensions of the discovery deadlines. The judge ruled that the plaintiff's failure to respond waived all objections and denied the request for sanctions. The judge also noted that the deadline to hear motions relating to written discovery was October 1, 2024, and the motion was filed on October 14, 2024, which was after the deadline.
