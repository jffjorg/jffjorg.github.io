21STCV40336
Defendant’s Motion to Compel Plaintiff to Respond to Supplemental Interrogatories
and Supplemental Request for Production
Tentative
The motion to compel is granted.
The request for sanctions is denied.
Background 
On November 2, 2021, Charles Ervont Grays
(“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against City of Pasadena (“Defendant”), County
of Los Angeles, California Department of Transportation, Ameesa Corporation,
and Does 1 through 50. The complaint arises from an alleged trip and fall
incident on December 27, 2020, at or near 216 S. Madison Avenue in the City of
Pasadena. 
Defendant filed an answer on April 15, 2022.
Plaintiff requested dismissal of California
Department of Transportation on June 14, 2022, and of Ameesa Corporation on
July 5, 2022. 
On October 14, 2024, Defendant filed this
motion to compel Plaintiff to respond to supplemental written discovery. 
 
No opposition has been filed.
 
Legal Standard
A party must
respond to interrogatories within 30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.260, subd.(a).) If a party to whom interrogatories are directed does not
provide a timely response, the propounding party may move for an order
compelling response to the interrogatories. (Id., § 2030.290, subd. (b).) There
is no time limit for a motion to compel initial responses, and no meet and
confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2030.290; Sinaiko Healthcare
Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390,
411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who
fails to provide a timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).) 
“In addition to
the number of interrogatories permitted by Sections 2030.030 and 2030.040, a
party may propound a supplemental interrogatory to elicit any later acquired
information bearing on all answers previously made by any party in response to
interrogatories.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.070, subd. (a).)
When a party
moves to compel initial responses to interrogatories, “the court shall impose a
monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against
any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the
motion], unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2030.290, subd. (c).)
A party must
respond to requests for production of documents within 30 days after service.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260, subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests for
production of documents are directed does not provide timely responses, the
requesting party may move for an order compelling response to the demand. (Id.,
§ 2031.300, subd. (b).) There is no time limit for a motion to compel initial
responses, and no meet and confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2031.300;
Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007)
148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules
of Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In
addition, a party who fails to provide a timely response generally waives all
objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.300, subd. (a).) 
“In addition to
the demands for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling permitted by this
chapter, a party may propound a supplemental demand to inspect, copy, test, or
sample any later acquired or discovered documents, tangible things, land or
other property, or electronically stored information in the possession,
custody, or control of the party on whom the demand is made.” (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2031.050, subd. (a).)
When a party
moves to compel initial responses to requests for production, “the court shall
impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010)
against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the
motion], unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2031.300, subd. (c).) 
In Chapter 7 of
the Civil Discovery Act, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010, subdivision
(d), defines “[m]isuses of the discovery process” to include “[f]ailing to
respond to or to submit to an authorized method of discovery.”  Where a party or attorney has engaged in
misuse of the discovery process, the court may impose a monetary sanction in
the amount of “the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by
anyone as a result of that conduct.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.020, subd. (a).)
"Except as
otherwise provided in this chapter, any party shall be entitled as a matter of
right to complete discovery proceedings on or before the 30th day, and to have
motions concerning discovery heard on or before the 15th day, before the date
initially set for the trial of the action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2024.020, subd.
(a).) 
Discussion
Defendant moves
for an order compelling Plaintiff to respond to Supplemental Interrogatories
and Supplemental Request for Production of Documents. 
On August 5,
2024, Defendant propounded the written discovery in question on Plaintiff. (Torrez
Decl., ¶ 4; see also Exhs. 2 & 3.) Plaintiff failed to respond to discovery.
(Id., ¶ 9.) 
On October 14,
2024, Defendant filed this motion to compel.
The Court denies
the motion as untimely.
When the
complaint was filed, the Court assigned a trial date of May 2, 2023.  
On February 16, 2023,
the Court granted Defendant’s motion, continued the trial date to February 13,
2024, and extended all discovery deadlines based on the new trial date.
On January 29, 2024,
on the stipulation of the parties, the Court continued the trial date to May 9,
2024, and extended all discovery deadlines based on the new trial date.
On April 24, 2024,
on the stipulation of the parties, the Court continued the trial date to October
16, 2024, and extended all discovery deadlines based on the new trial date.
On September 19,
2024, on the stipulation of the parties, the Court extended the deadline for
discovery for the limited purpose of allowing the parties to conduct
depositions of certain identified percipient and expert witnesses.  There was no extension of the deadlines for
written discovery.
On September 23,
2024, on the stipulation of the parties, the Court continued the trial date to
January 16, 2025.  The Court again stated
that it was extending the deadline for discovery for the limited purpose of
allowing the parties to conduct depositions of certain identified percipient and
expert witnesses.  There was no extension
of the deadlines for written discovery.
Accordingly, the
deadline to hear motions relating to written discovery was, under Code of Civil
Procedure section 2024.020, subdivision (a), October 1, 2024 – 15 days before (previous)
trial date of October 16, 2024.
The motion is
denied.
Conclusion
The
Court DENIES the motion of Defendant City of Pasadena to compel Plaintiff Charles
Ervont Grays to respond to Supplemental Interrogatories and Supplemental
Request for Production of Documents. 
 
Moving Party is to
provide notice.
