Los Angeles 
22STCV11798
Motion to Compel Deposition of Plaintiff’s Expert Witness Colin Smith
Tentative
The motion is granted.
Background
On April 7, 2022, Quang Wong (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint
against City of Los Angeles (“Defendant”) for dangerous condition of public
property cause of action arising out of Plaintiff’s fall from his skateboard occurring
on July 25, 2021.
 
On September 15, 2023, Defendant filed an answer and
cross-complaint against Roes 1 to 10.
 
On October 17, 2024, Defendant filed
this motion to compel the deposition of Plaintiff’s Expert Witness, Colin
Smith. No opposition has been filed.
 
Legal Standard
“On receipt of an expert
witness list from a party, any other party may take the deposition of any
person on the list. The procedures for taking oral and written depositions set
forth in Chapters 9 (commencing with Section 2025.010), 10 (commencing with
Section 2026.010), and 11 (commencing with Section 2028.010) apply to a
deposition of a listed trial expert witness except as provided in this
article.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2034.410.)  
 
“An expert described
in subdivision (b) of Section 2034.210 whose deposition is noticed pursuant to
Section 2025.220 shall, no later than three business days before his or her
deposition, produce any materials or category of materials, including any
electronically stored information, called for by the deposition notice.” (Code
Civ. Proc. § 2034.415.)  
 
“The service of a
proper deposition notice accompanied by the tender of the expert witness fee
described in Section 2034.430 is effective to require the party employing or
retaining the expert to produce the expert for the deposition.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2034.460, subd. (a).)
 
Section
2025.410, subdivision (a), requires any party to serve a written objection at
least three days before the deposition if the party contends that a deposition
notice does not comply with the provisions of sections 2025.210 through
2025.280.
Section
2025.450, subdivision (a), provides:
“If,
after service of a deposition notice, a party to the action or an officer,
director, managing agent, or employee of a party, or a person designated by an organization
that is a party under Section 2025.230, without
having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails to appear for
examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for¿inspection any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the
deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move for an order compelling
the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the production for inspection of
any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in
the deposition notice.”  
Any
such motion to compel must show good cause for the production of documents and,
when a deponent has failed to appear, the motion must be accompanied “by a
declaration stating that the petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire
about the nonappearance.”  (Id.,
subd. (b).) 
 
Discussion
Plaintiff designated his expert witnesses on September
9, 2024. (Zuckerman Decl., ¶ 2 & Exh. A.) Defendant initially a notice for
the deposition of Plaintiff’s expert witness Colin Smith on September 23.  (Id., ¶ 3 & Exh. B.)  Plaintiff served an objection on September
19, stating that the witness was not available. 
(Id., ¶ 4 & Exh. C.)  
After an unsuccessful attempt to obtain alternative
dates from Plaintiff, Defendant sent a new notice for the deposition of Mr.
Smith on October 11.  (Id., ¶ 6
& Exh. E.)  Plaintiff served an untimely
objection on October 9, stating that the witness was not available.  (Id., ¶ 7 & Exh. F.)
Defendant followed up but was not provided
with alternate deposition dates.  (Id.,
¶ 8 & Exh. G.)  Defendant tendered
the required expert witness fee.  (Id.,
¶ 9 & Exh. H.)
Defendant
has shown that it noticed the deposition of Plaintiff’s expert, that it
tendered the required fee, that Plaintiff failed to serve a timely objection,
and that Plaintiff did not produce the expert witness for deposition.
 
The
motion to compel is granted. 
 
Conclusion
 
The Court GRANTS Defendant’s motion
to compel.
The Court ORDERS Plaintiff to produce expert
witness Colin Smith for deposition within 10 days of notice.
Moving party is ORDERED to
give notice.
