[1]
Plaintiff appears to suggest that opposing counsel may have done so, stating
that she gave her signature in discovery. Although not in Defendant’s separate
statement, Defendant has presented evidence of testimony by Fitness employees
regarding the custom and practice of requiring customers to sign the waiver.
(See Park Decl., Exh. 1 (Lozano Dep. Pgs. 20-21); Exh. 2 (Castiglione Dep.
8:15-21.)


[2] This
argument is not clearly presented. Plaintiff appears to be arguing that the
Dance Act applies here, but also argues that the waiver is not a
contract for health studio services. (Opp. at pg. 3.) To the extent that there
is a different agreement that is purportedly covered by the Dance Act and
allegedly is void for failure to provide a copy to Mirano, such agreement has
not been presented to the Court and is not the subject of this motion.


[3] In light
of the Court’s ruling, the Court declines to reach Defendant’s alternative
argument that it had no actual or constructive notice of the dangerous
condition.
