**Case Summary**

This is a tentative ruling on a motion for summary judgment filed by Fitness International, LLC (Fitness) against Berta Mirano and Guillermo Munoz Mirano (Plaintiffs). The motion was filed in response to the Plaintiffs' complaint filed on April 30, 2021, alleging negligence and premises liability claims. Fitness argues that the Plaintiffs' executed waiver and assumption of risk form is a valid release of liability, and therefore, there are no triable issues of material fact.

**Facts**

The Plaintiffs contend that they did not read or understand the waiver, and that the signature on the waiver was illegally transposed. However, Fitness argues that the waiver is clear, unambiguous, and explicit in expressing the intent of the parties to exculpate Fitness from future negligence. The Court finds that the waiver is valid and that the Plaintiffs have not met their burden to establish that there are triable issues of material fact.

**Legal Analysis**

The Court applies the legal standards for summary judgment and finds that the waiver is a valid release of liability. The Court also finds that the Plaintiffs' loss of consortium claim is barred because it is dependent on the negligence and premises liability claims, which are being dismissed.

**Order**

Based on the foregoing, the motion for summary judgment is GRANTED.

The judge is recommending a summary judgment in favor of Defendant Fitness International, LLC  based on the following reasoning:

**Plaintiff's argument that she didn't understand the waiver is rejected because it's generally accepted that a person signing a contract is deemed to assent to its terms even if they don't read it.

**Plaintiff's argument that the waiver is void under California's Dance Act is rejected because it doesn't apply to the situation.

**Plaintiff's argument that the waiver doesn't apply because it doesn't address the type of injury is rejected because the injury is not outside the scope of the waiver.

**Plaintiff's argument that her husband's loss of consortium claim is rejected because it depends on the main negligence claim.
