And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling is issued by Judge [Judge's Name] in Department 32 on September 28, 2023, in the case of Maria Susana Gallegos vs. Los Angeles County Development Authority (Case Number 21STCV15870). The case involves a demurrer to the plaintiff's complaint alleging negligence and premises liability. The defendant, Los Angeles County Development Authority, argues that the complaint fails to state a cause of action because it does not allege a statutory basis for liability and does not identify a defective aspect of the physical condition of the property. The plaintiff, Maria Susana Gallegos, claims that the defendant failed to properly maintain the property, which caused a flood that resulted in her injuries.

The court has taken judicial notice that the defendant is a public entity as defined by the California Government Code. The court has also taken judicial notice that the plaintiff's complaint alleges causes of action for general negligence and premises liability without stating a specific statutory basis. The court has further taken judicial notice that the complaint does not plead the necessary elements with particularity to state a cause of action under Government Code section 835.

Based on the law, the court has sustained the defendant's demurrer to the plaintiff's complaint with leave to amend. The plaintiff is ordered to file an amended complaint within 30 days. The defendant shall provide notice of the court's ruling and file a proof of service of such.
