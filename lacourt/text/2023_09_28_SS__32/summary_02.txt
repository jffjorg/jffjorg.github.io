This tentative ruling is issued by Judge [Judge's Name] in Department 32 on September 28, 2023, in the case of Maria Susana Gallegos vs. Los Angeles County Development Authority (Case Number 21STCV15870). The case involves a demurrer to the plaintiff's complaint alleging negligence and premises liability. The defendant, Los Angeles County Development Authority, argues that the complaint fails to state a cause of action because it does not allege a statutory basis for liability and does not identify a defective aspect of the physical condition of the property. The plaintiff, Maria Susana Gallegos, claims that the defendant failed to properly maintain the property, which caused a flood that resulted in her injuries.

The court has taken judicial notice that the defendant is a public entity as defined by the California Government Code. The court has also taken judicial notice that the plaintiff's complaint alleges causes of action for general negligence and premises liability without stating a specific statutory basis. The court has further taken judicial notice that the complaint does not plead the necessary elements with particularity to state a cause of action under Government Code section 835.

Based on the law, the court has sustained the defendant's demurrer to the plaintiff's complaint with leave to amend. The plaintiff is ordered to file an amended complaint within 30 days. The defendant shall provide notice of the court's ruling and file a proof of service of such.

**English-Text Summary:**

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the Defendant, Los Angeles County Development Authority, in a case brought by Maria Susana Gallegos.  

The judge found that Gallegos's complaint, which alleges negligence and premises liability, fails to state a valid legal claim against a public entity like the Defendant.  Specifically, the complaint lacks a specific statutory basis for the claims and does not adequately describe the dangerous condition that allegedly caused Gallegos's injuries.

The judge has allowed Gallegos to amend her complaint to address these deficiencies. If she does so within 30 days, the case will continue. Otherwise, the Defendant's demurrer will be granted, and the case will be dismissed.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a demurrer filed by the defendant, Los Angeles County Development Authority, to the complaint filed by the plaintiff, Maria Susana Gallegos. The plaintiff alleges that the defendant is liable for negligence and premises liability due to a flood that occurred on May 16, 2020, at the Foothill Villa property. The defendant argues that the complaint fails to state a statutory basis for liability, as it does not plead the necessary elements of a cause of action for government tort liability. The judge agrees with the defendant and sustains the demurrer, giving the plaintiff leave to amend the complaint. The judge orders the plaintiff to file an amended complaint within 30 days.
