Defendant demurs to Plaintiff’s complaint in that (1) it fails to  assert a statutory basis for negligence and premises liability since Defendant  is a public entity; (2) fails to identity any defective aspect of the physical  condition on the property; and (3) fails to allege notice.  No opposition was filed.    LEGAL  STANDARD   The primary function of a pleading is to give the other party notice  so that it may prepare its case [citation], and a defect in a pleading that otherwise  properly notifies a party cannot be said to affect substantial rights.” (Harris  v. City of Santa Monica (2013) 56 Cal.4th 203, 240.) “A demurrer tests the legal  sufficiency of the factual allegations in a complaint.” (Ivanoff v. Bank of America, N.A. (2017) 9  Cal.App.5th 719, 725.) It raises issues of law, not fact, regarding the form or  content of the opposing party's pleading (complaint, answer or  cross-complaint).  (Code Civ. Proc. §§  422.10, 589; see Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th  968, 994.)  It is not the function of the  demurrer to challenge the truthfulness of the complaint; and for purposes of  the ruling on the demurrer, all facts pleaded in the complaint are assumed to  be true.  (Donabedian, 116  Cal.App.4th at 994.)   A demurrer can be used only to challenge defects that appear on the  face of the pleading under attack; or from matters outside the pleading that  are judicially noticeable.  (Blank v.  Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318; Donabedian, supra, 116 Cal.App.4th  at 994.)  No other extrinsic evidence can  be considered.  (Ion Equip. Corp. v.  Nelson (1980) 110 Cal.App.3d 868, 881 [error for court to consider facts  asserted in memorandum supporting demurrer]; see also Afuso v. United States  Fid. & Guar. Co. (1985) 169 Cal.App.3d 859, 862 [disapproved on other  grounds in Moradi-Shalal v. Fireman’s Fund Ins. Cos. (1988) 46 Cal.3d  287] [error to consider contents of release not part of court record].) A  demurrer can be utilized where the “face of the complaint” itself is incomplete  or discloses some defense that would bar recovery.  (Guardian North Bay, Inc. v. Superior  Court (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 963, 971-72.)        MEET  AND CONFER   Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41 requires that “[b]efore filing a demurrer pursuant to this  chapter, the demurring party shall meet and confer in person or by telephone  with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the  purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve  the objections to be raised in the demurrer.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd.  (a).) The parties are to meet and confer at least five days before the date the  responsive pleading is due. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a)(2).)  Thereafter, the demurring party shall file and serve a declaration detailing  their meet and confer efforts. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a)(3).)   Defendant’s counsel, Caroline  Park, submits a proper declaration that a meet and confer took place by  telephone. (Park Decl. ¶ 3–5.) Therefore, the meet and confer requirement is  satisfied.    ANALYSIS   Government Code section 815 provides that “[a] public entity is not  liable for an injury, whether such injury arises out of an act or omission of  the public entity or a public employee or any other person” except as provided  by statute. (Gov. Code, § 815, subd. (a); see Hoff v. Vacaville Unified  School Dist. (1998) 19 Cal.4th 925, 932.) “[D]irect tort liability of  public entities must be based on a specific statute declaring them to be  liable, or at least creating some specific duty of care, and not on the general  tort provisions of Civil Code section 1714. Otherwise, the general rule of  immunity for public entities would be largely eroded by the routine application  of general tort principles.” (Eastburn v. Regional Fire Protection Authority  (2003) 31 Cal.4th 1175, 1183.) Consequently, “public  entities may be liable only if a statute declares them to be liable.”  (Tuthill  v. City of San Buenaventura (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 1081, 1088 (emphasis in  the original). It has been recognized that it is impermissible to sue a public  entity for common law negligence. (Torres v. Department of Corrections and  Rehabilitation (2013) 217 Cal.App.4th 844, 850.)      Moreover, to state a cause of action [for government tort  liability] every fact essential to the existence of statutory liability must be  pleaded with particularity, including the existence of a statutory duty.”   (Searcy v. Hemet Unified School Dist. (1986) 177 Cal.App.3d 792,  802.)      As an initial matter, the Court on  its own motion takes judicial notice that Defendant is a public entity as  defined by the California Government Code.  (Gov. Code § 811.2 [“’Public  entity includes . . . a county city, district, public authority,  public agency, and any other political subdivision or public corporation in the  State.”].)   Here, the complaint alleges that on May 16,  2020, Plaintiff was ordered by a firefighter to evacuate her unit because of a  water flood. She describes that as she was evacuating, she slipped and fell,  causing injuries. Then, she alleges: “[a]s for Defendant Los Angeles  County Development Authority and Foothill Villa Management Office, they failed  to properly maintain the property that caused the pipes to leak and cause a  flood. Plaintiff suffered injuries to her head, legs, hips, feet, aims and  buttocks. Plaintiff is still undergoing treatment for her injuries.” (Complaint,  5, 6.)   Here, the  complaint alleges causes of action for general negligence and premises  liability without stating a specific statutory basis. Since Defendant is a public  entity, all tort claims must be based on statute.   Additionally, if  Plaintiff were to assert a claim under Government Code section 835, the Complaint  pleads insufficient facts. Government Code  section 835  states:¿“Except as provided by statute, a public entity is liable for injury  caused by a dangerous condition of its property if the plaintiff establishes  that the property was in a dangerous condition at the time of the injury, that  the injury was proximately caused by the dangerous condition, that the  dangerous condition created a reasonably foreseeable risk of the kind of injury  which was incurred, and either:¿    (a) A  negligent or wrongful act or omission of an employee of the public entity  within the scope of his employment created the dangerous condition; or¿¿    (b) The  public entity had actual or constructive notice of the dangerous condition  under Section 835.2  a sufficient time prior to the injury to have taken measures to protect against  the dangerous condition.”¿¿    Here,  the Complaint generally alleges that Defendant failed to properly manage its  property. However, it does not plead the necessary elements with particularity.   CONCLUSION AND ORDER   Therefore, the Court sustains Defendant’s demurrer to Plaintiff’s complaint  with leave to amend.  Plaintiff to file an amended complaint within 30 days. Defendant shall provide notice of the Court’s ruling and file a proof  of service of such.
