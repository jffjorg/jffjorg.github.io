The judge has granted KFHP's motion for summary judgment.

## Tentative Ruling Summary:

**Case Number:** 19STCV07622

**Hearing Date:** September 28, 2023

**Parties:** 

* **Plaintiffs:** Edma Kizirian, Taline Boyamian, Armand Kizirian, and Estate of Sebouh Kizirian
* **Defendant:** Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, Inc.

**Background:**

This case involves a wrongful death lawsuit stemming from the death of Sebouh Z. Kizirian following two surgeries. Plaintiffs allege medical malpractice and loss of consortium. Defendant Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, Inc. (KFHP) moves for summary judgment, arguing it cannot be held vicariously liable for the alleged negligence of contracted medical providers.

**Legal Standard:**

The Knox-Keene Health Care Service Plan Act (Knox-Keene) bars claims against health care service plans for vicarious liability for the acts of providers. KFHP argues it falls under this protection and is not directly liable for the alleged negligence.

**Defendant's Argument:**

KFHP states:

* It is a health care service plan licensed under Knox-Keene.
* It does not provide healthcare services, operate hospitals, or manage provider care.
* All care provided to the decedent was provided by contracted providers, not KFHP.
* Plaintiffs' claims focus on the actions of other Kaiser entities (Kaiser Foundation Hospitals and Southern California Permanente Medical Group) and not on KFHP itself.

**Plaintiffs' Argument:**

Plaintiffs argue that KFHP, Kaiser Foundation Hospitals, and Southern California Permanente Medical Group operate as each other's agents and are joint employers of the physicians involved, creating a unified enterprise. They cite evidence of shared leadership, physical addresses, and a website statement describing their interconnectedness. However, they do not directly address the Knox-Keene bar on vicarious liability.

**Court's Ruling:**

The Court grants Defendant KFHP's motion for summary judgment. 

The Court finds:

* Plaintiffs have not established a triable issue of fact regarding KFHP's direct involvement in the decedent's care.
* Even if an integrated enterprise theory were viable, Knox-Keene prevents vicarious liability between health plans and providers.
* Plaintiffs' request for a continuance to depose a witness is denied due to lack of diligence and relevance to the main issue of KFHP's liability.



**Key Takeaways:**

*  Knox-Keene Act strongly protects health care service plans from vicarious liability for provider negligence.
*  Plaintiffs must demonstrate direct involvement by the health plan to overcome this protection.
*  "Integrated enterprise" theories may not be sufficient to establish liability under Knox-Keene.

Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for summary judgment filed by Defendant Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, Inc. The motion seeks to determine whether Defendant can be held vicariously liable for the alleged negligent acts or omissions of contracted health care providers. The Court finds that Defendant is a health care service plan licensed by the California Department of Managed Health Care and that it does not provide health care services, operate hospitals, or render medical care or treatment. The Court also finds that all medical care and treatment of decedent was provided through membership with Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, Inc.

The Court concludes that Defendant Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, Inc. cannot be held vicariously liable for the alleged negligent acts or omissions of contracted health care providers. The Court relies on the Knox-Keene Act, which bars claims against a plan for vicarious liability, and Health and Safety Code section 1371.5, which provides that a plan, any entity contracting with a plan, and providers are each responsible for their own acts or omissions, and are not liable for the acts or omissions of, or the costs of defending, others.

The Court grants Defendant's motion for summary judgment and denies Plaintiff's request for continuance. The Court finds that Plaintiff has failed to establish a triable issue of fact and that Defendant has met its burden to demonstrate that there are no triable issues of material fact.
