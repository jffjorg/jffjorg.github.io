Summary:
The judge is considering a motion for summary judgment filed by Defendant Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, Inc. (KFHP) in a lawsuit brought by Plaintiffs Edma Kizirian, Taline Boyamian, Armand Kizirian, and Estate of Sebouh Kizirian. The lawsuit stems from the death of Sebouh Z. Kizirian, who died after receiving medical treatment. KFHP argues that it is a health care service plan under the Knox-Keene Act and therefore cannot be held vicariously liable for the acts of providers. The judge has reviewed the evidence and has concluded that KFHP has met its burden to demonstrate that there are no triable issues of material fact. The judge has granted KFHP's motion for summary judgment.
