**English Summary:**

The tentative ruling addresses two motions filed by Defendant Palisades Village Center Associates against Plaintiff Adelmo Rivera: a motion to compel an independent medical examination and a motion to compel Plaintiff's deposition.

The court finds that the motions are procedurally defective because Plaintiff remains represented by counsel who has not been officially relieved by the court, despite previous attempts to withdraw. As such, the motions are denied without prejudice, meaning the Defendant can refile them after properly notifying the court and Plaintiff's counsel.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel an independent medical examination and deposition of the plaintiff, Adelmo Rivera. The defendant, Palisades Village Center Associates, had moved to compel the examination and deposition, citing the plaintiff's self-representation and failure to respond to authorized methods of discovery. However, the judge has denied the motions as procedurally defective, without prejudice, due to the fact that the plaintiff's counsel has not been relieved by the court and has not received notice of the hearing. The judge has also noted that the plaintiff is currently a self-represented litigant and that the defendant's motions were made without opposition. The court's ruling does not address the merits of the motions, but rather addresses the procedural issues surrounding the hearing.
