The judge is reviewing a motion and has made some observations and decisions. The plaintiff claims that the defendant's counsel may have signed a waiver, but the defendant has presented evidence of a custom and practice of requiring customers to sign the waiver. The plaintiff's argument about the Dance Act is unclear and the judge is not convinced. The judge is declining to consider the defendant's alternative argument that they did not have actual or constructive notice of a dangerous condition.
