## English Summary

The Judge is considering a motion filed by the Plaintiff, Mirano, who alleges a violation of the Dance Act.  Mirano claims that Defendant, Fitness, did not provide a copy of an agreement to them. Fitness argues that Mirano signed a waiver, and provides evidence from employee testimonies stating that it's their standard practice to have customers sign waivers. 

The Judge notes that Mirano's argument about the Dance Act is unclear, as they seem to be suggesting it applies to both the waiver and a separate, unspecified agreement.

The Judge does not rule on Fitness's argument that they had no notice of a dangerous condition, as this is not necessary for their current decision.


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any specific point.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion and has made some initial thoughts based on the information presented. The plaintiff argues that the waiver is not a contract for health studio services, but also suggests that it is covered by the Dance Act. However, the court is unclear on the plaintiff's argument and notes that a different agreement that is purportedly covered by the Dance Act has not been presented to the court. The judge also declines to consider the defendant's alternative argument that they had no actual or constructive notice of the dangerous condition. The court is also aware of testimony from Fitness employees regarding the custom and practice of requiring customers to sign the waiver.
