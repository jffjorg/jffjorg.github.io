And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied the Plaintiff's motion to strike the Memoranda of Costs filed by the Defendants. The Judge finds that the Defendants are prevailing parties because the Plaintiff dismissed them without securing a settlement or obtaining any relief against them. The Judge also finds that the costs claimed by the Defendants are reasonable and necessary for the litigation, as they are allowable by statute or by the CC&Rs. Additionally, the Judge notes that there is no evidence on the record that shows the Defendants refused to participate in alternative dispute resolution prior to the commencement of the lawsuit.
