MOTION:                  Motion
to Tax/Strike Costs
HEARING DATE:   10/18/2024

 
Legal
Standard
 
In general, the “prevailing party” is entitled as a matter
of right to recover costs for suit in any action or proceeding. (CCP § 1032(b);
Santisas v. Goodin (1998) 17 Cal.4th 599, 606.) “Prevailing party”
includes the party with a net monetary recovery, a defendant in whose favor a
dismissal is entered, a defendant where neither plaintiff nor defendant obtains
any relief, and a defendant as against those plaintiffs who do not recover any
relief against that defendant. (CCP § 1032 (a)(4).) 
 
“Allowable costs shall be reasonably necessary to the
conduct of the litigation rather than merely convenient or beneficial to its
preparation.” (CCP § 1033.5(c)(2).) “If the items appearing in a cost bill
appear to be proper charges, the burden is on the party seeking to tax costs to
show that they were not reasonable or necessary.” (Ladas v. California State
Auto. Assn. (1993) 19 Cal. App. 4th 761, 774.) On the other hand, if the
items are properly objected to, they are put in issue and the burden of proof
is on the party claiming them as costs. (Id.) 
 
Analysis
 
Plaintiff Lani Hay moves to strike the
Memoranda of Costs filed by Defendants 1012 2nd Street LLC, Saeed Babaeean, and
Soheil Mehrabanian.  Plaintiff argues
that Defendants are not “prevailing parties.” As discussed at the prior hearing
on the motion for attorneys’ fees, Defendants are prevailing parties because
Plaintiff dismissed them without securing a settlement or obtaining any relief
against them. Likewise, based upon the record before the Court, the Court does
not find that Defendants are the alter egos of the HOA Defendants, such that
Plaintiff’s settlement with the HOA would apply to Defendants. Critically, no
injustice will occur, since Plaintiff has already secured her litigation
objectives against the HOA. Allowing separate, dismissed Defendants to recover
costs as allowed by statute would not be an injustice.
 
Plaintiff asserts
that costs should be denied because Defendants refused to participate in an
alternative dispute resolution. Civil Code § 5960 states: “In an enforcement
action in which attorney's fees and costs may be awarded, the court, in
determining the amount of the award, may consider whether a party's refusal to
participate in alternative dispute resolution before commencement of the action
was reasonable.” Plaintiff alleged that on February 11, 2021,
Plaintiff sent a letter to the HOA (not Defendants) requesting that the parties
engage in an alternative dispute resolution in an attempt to resolve this
lawsuit prior to filing. (Compl., ¶ 49.) Otherwise, the court observes no
evidence on the record that would show Defendants (Mehrabanian,
Babaeean, and the LLC) refused to participate in any ADR prior to commencement
of suit.  
 
Defendant
Mehrabanian claimed $615.41 in motion filing fees. Defendant 1012 2nd
Street LLC claimed $460.98 in costs, including $435.00 in
motion filing fees, $150 in jury fees, and $30.41 in electronic filing fees. Defendant
Babaeean claimed $3,738.06 in fees, which included $2,684.50 in
mediation fees allowable under the CC&Rs.
banian Each of
these items of costs are expressly allowable by statute or by the CC&Rs. (CCP
§1033.5.) Such fees for motions and other costs,
required by the Court, are reasonable and necessary for litigation. 
 
Accordingly, the motions are DENIED.
