And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the moving, opposing, and reply papers and rules as follows. The plaintiff, Justin Ybarra, filed an action against several defendants, including Greystar California, Inc., for assault, battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress, false imprisonment, and negligence. The court previously granted Greystar's motion to strike the punitive damage claim and related allegations from the complaint, but the plaintiff amended the complaint to include a new allegation.

Greystar has now filed a motion to strike the punitive damage allegations from the first amended complaint, arguing that the plaintiff has failed to plead facts showing that a managing agent, officer, or director of Greystar authorized or ratified the wrongful conduct for which the plaintiff seeks punitive damages. The court agrees with Greystar and grants the motion to strike.

The court finds that the plaintiff's first amended complaint fails to plead ultimate facts showing that an officer, director, or managing agent of Greystar had advance knowledge of the unfitness of Doe Defendant 1 and employed him with a conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others or authorized or ratified the wrongful conduct or was personally guilty of oppression, fraud, or malice. As a result, the court strikes paragraphs 30, 35, 42, 47, and 60 and the prayer for punitive damages from the first amended complaint with 30 days leave to amend.
