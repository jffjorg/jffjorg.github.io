BACKGROUND 
On
April 23, 2021, Plaintiff Helen Wang filed this action against Defendants
Chihling Wu, Sung Hao Nien, and Does 1-15 for motor vehicle tort and general
negligence. 
On
May 27, 2021, Defendants Chihling Wu and Sung Hao Nien filed an answer. The
same day, Defendant and Cross-Complainant Chihling Wu and Cross-Complainant Jiaxin
Nien, a minor by and through her guardian ad litem Chihling Wu, filed a
cross-complaint against Cross-Defendants Helen Wang and Does 1-50 for
apportionment of fault, indemnification, motor vehicle tort, and general
negligence.  On June 25, 2021, Plaintiff
and Cross-Defendant Helen Wang filed an answer. On July 23, 2021, the Court
dismissed the cross-complaint’s first cause of action for indemnification
without prejudice based on the parties’ stipulation. 
On
March 7, 2023, the Court dismissed Plaintiff Helen Wang’s complaint without
prejudice at her request. 
On
April 26, 2023, Cross-Complainants Chihling Wu and Jiaxin Nien (“Cross-Complainants”)
filed a notice of conditional settlement. 
On
April 27, 2023, the Court dismissed the “complaint of Chihling Wu against all
defendants” “as to only Cross-complaint of Chihling Wu” with prejudice at
Cross-Complainants’ request. 
On

approve minor’s compromise. 
No
trial date is currently scheduled. 
PETITIONER’S REQUEST 
Petitioner
asks the Court to approve the compromise of the pending action of Claimant

LEGAL STANDARD 
“‘[W]ithout
trial court approval of the proposed compromise of the ward’s claim, the
settlement cannot be valid. [Citation.] [¶] Nor is the settlement binding [on

Court (2012) 202 Cal.App.4th 1333, 1338; see Prob. Code, §§ 3500, 3600, et
seq.; Code Civ. Proc., § 372.) 
To
obtain court approval of the settlement of a minor’s claims, the petitioner
must file a complete and “verified petition for approval of the settlement and
must disclose ‘all information that has any bearing upon the reasonableness of
the compromise.’ [Citations.]” (Barnes v. Western Heritage Ins. Co.
(2013) 217 Cal.App.4th 249, 256; see Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.950.)
