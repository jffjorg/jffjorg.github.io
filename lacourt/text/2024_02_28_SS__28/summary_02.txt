And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling is about a motion to strike portions of the cross-complaint filed by the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (Metro) against the Cross-Defendants, Carmen Beatriz Rivera and Patricia Sarmiento. The motion was filed in response to Metro's cross-complaint, which alleges that the Cross-Defendants were responsible for the accident that caused personal injuries and property damage to Metro's vehicle. The Court denied the motion to strike the cross-complaint's fourth cause of action for negligence and property damage, but granted the motion to strike Metro's request for attorneys' fees. The Court ruled that the property damage issue has been resolved and that Metro's cross-complaint does not allege the existence of a contract or assert claims for which a statute authorizes fees.
