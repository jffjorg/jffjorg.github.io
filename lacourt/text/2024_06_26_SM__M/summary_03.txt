Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge denied the plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction, holding that the plaintiff failed to demonstrate a probability of prevailing on the merits. The plaintiff, BOBS LLC, alleged that defendant Quality Loan Service Corporation failed to provide sufficient notice prior to a nonjudicial foreclosure sale, but the court found that Quality complied with the statutory notice requirements. The court also found that the plaintiff failed to demonstrate equitable estoppel, as there was no evidence that Quality agreed to a new notice procedure or that the plaintiff relied on Quality's actions to its detriment. The court further held that the plaintiff's claims were barred by the statute of limitations and that the plaintiff failed to show actual injury or damage as a result of Quality's actions.
