Roles:
  - Judge
  - Plaintiff (Jeffrey Soler)
  - Defendant (General Motors LLC)
Significant Statements:
  - "A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters."
  - "A plaintiff need only allege ultimate facts sufficient to apprise the defendant of the factual basis for the claim against him."
  - "A fraud claim must be specifically pleaded, but less specificity as to fraud claims is required if it appears from the nature of allegations that defendant must necessarily possess full information, or if the facts lie more in the knowledge of opposing parties."
  - "The fraudulent prong of a UCL claim is less rigorous than common law fraud, as common law fraud requires allegations of actual falsity and reasonable reliance while fraud under UCL does not."
```

The judge's tentative ruling is that the demurrer to the first cause of action for fraud by concealment is OVERRULED, and the demurrer to the second cause of action for violation of Business and Professions Code section 17200 is also OVERRULED. The motion to strike the request for punitive damages and related allegations is DENIED.
