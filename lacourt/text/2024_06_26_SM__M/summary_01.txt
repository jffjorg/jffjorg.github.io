English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the Plaintiff's motion to continue the trial date from August 5, 2024 to February 10, 2025 or any date thereafter. The Plaintiff failed to show good cause for the continuance, as required under California Rules of Court Rule 3.1332. The Plaintiff argued that further discovery, expert depositions, and settlement negotiations were needed, but did not provide any evidence of an excused inability to obtain essential discovery. The Court also noted that the parties were ordered to complete a settlement conference or mediation by July 5, 2024, and their failure to do so would justify sanctions, but not a trial continuance.
