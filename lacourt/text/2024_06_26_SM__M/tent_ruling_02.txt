MOTION:                     Demurrer to the First Amended
Complaint  
HEARING DATE:   6/26/2024
 
LEGAL STANDARD 
 
A demurrer for sufficiency tests whether
the complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147
Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) When considering demurrers, courts read the allegations
liberally and in context. In a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be
apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial notice. (Donabedian
v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) A demurrer tests the
pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters. Therefore, it
lies only where the defects appear on the face of the pleading or are
judicially noticed. (CCP §§ 430.30, 430.70.) At the pleading stage, a plaintiff
need only allege ultimate facts sufficient to apprise the defendant of the
factual basis for the claim against him. (Semole v. Sansoucie (1972) 28
Cal. App. 3d 714, 721.) A “demurrer does not, however, admit contentions,
deductions or conclusions of fact or law alleged in the pleading, or the
construction of instruments pleaded, or facts impossible in law.” (S. Shore
Land Co. v. Petersen (1964) 226 Cal.App.2d 725, 732, internal citations
omitted.) 
 
A special demurrer for uncertainty is
disfavored and will only be sustained where the pleading is so bad that
defendant cannot reasonably respond—i.e., cannot reasonably determine what
issues must be admitted or denied, or what counts or claims are directed
against him/her. (CCP § 430.10(f); Khoury v. Maly’s of Calif., Inc.
(1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.) Moreover, even if the pleading is somewhat
vague, “ambiguities can be clarified under modern discovery procedures.” (Ibid.)  
 
Any party, within the time allowed to
respond to a pleading may serve and file a notice of motion to strike the whole
or any part thereof. (CCP § 435(b)(1); Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1322(b).)
The court may, upon a motion or at any time in its discretion and upon terms it
deems proper: (1) strike out any irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted
in any pleading; or (2) strike out all or any part of any pleading not drawn or
filed in conformity with the laws of California, a court rule, or an order of
the court. (CCP §§ 436(a)-(b); Stafford v. Shultz (1954) 42 Cal.2d 767,
782 [“Matter in a pleading which is not essential to the claim is surplusage;
probative facts are surplusage and may be stricken out or disregarded”].) 
 
“Liberality in permitting amendment is
the rule, if a fair opportunity to correct any defect has not been given.” (Angie
M. v. Superior Court (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1217, 1227.) It is an abuse of
discretion for the court to deny leave to amend where there is any reasonable
possibility that plaintiff can state a good cause of action. (Goodman v.
Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 349.) The burden is on plaintiff to show¿in
what manner¿plaintiff can amend the complaint, and¿how¿that
amendment will change the legal effect of the pleading.¿(Id.) 
 
ANALYSIS 
 
Defendant General Motors demurs to the
first, second and third causes of action of the First Amended Complaint (FAC) and
moves to strike the request for punitive damages and related allegations.
 
First Cause of Action for Concealment
 
Defendant argues that the first cause of
action for fraud by concealment fails to allege facts in support with the
requisite specificity, and only alleges the elements in a conclusory manner.  “‘[T]he
elements of an action for fraud and deceit based on concealment are: (1) the
defendant must have concealed or suppressed a material fact, (2) the defendant
must have been under a duty to disclose the fact to the plaintiff, (3) the
defendant must have intentionally concealed or suppressed the fact with the
intent to defraud the plaintiff, (4) the plaintiff must have been unaware of
the fact and would not have acted as he did if he had known of the concealed or
suppressed fact, and (5) as a result of the concealment or suppression of the
fact, the plaintiff must have sustained damage.’ [Citations.]” (Blickman Turkus, LP v. MF Downtown Sunnyvale, LLC (2008) 162
Cal.App.4th 858, 868.)  
 
Failure to disclose a material fact can
constitute actionable fraud where there is a duty to disclose. (Collins v.
eMachines, Inc. (2011) 202 Cal.App.4th 249, 255, 259.) A duty to disclose
material facts arises in four discrete circumstances: (1) when the defendant is
in a fiduciary relationship with the plaintiff (2) when the defendant had
exclusive knowledge of material facts not known to the plaintiff; (3) when the
defendant actively conceals a material fact from the plaintiff; and (4) when
the defendant makes partial representations but also suppresses some material
facts. (LiMandri v. Judikins (1997) 52 Cal. App. 4th 326, 336; see Warner
Constr. Corp. v. City of Los Angeles¿(1970) 2 Cal.3d 285, 294 [a duty to
disclose may arise when “the facts are known or accessible only to defendant,
and defendant knows they are not known to or reasonably discoverable by the
plaintiff.”] For example, a manufacturer’s omission from its customers regarding
a safety risk may breach this duty. (Jones v. ConocoPhillips (2011) 198
Cal.App.4th 1187, 1198-99 [stating that the general rule that “ ‘manufacturers
have a duty to warn consumers about the hazards inherent in their products’ ”
is “equally pertinent to the scope of the defendants’ duty to
disclose”].)  
 
Generally, a fraud claim must be
specifically pleaded, but less specificity as to fraud claims is required if it
appears from the nature of allegations that defendant must necessarily possess
full information, or if the facts lie more in the knowledge of opposing
parties. (Alfaro v. Community Housing Improvement System & Planning
Assn., Inc. (2009) 171 Cal.App.4th 1356, 1384-1385; see Bushell v.
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (2013) 220 Cal.App.4th 915, 931 [“plaintiffs did
not have to specify the … personnel who prepared these documents because that
information is uniquely within … [defendant’s] knowledge”].) “‘[T]he courts
should not ... seek to absolve the defendant from liability on highly technical
requirements of form in pleading. Pleading facts in ordinary and concise
language is as permissible in fraud cases as in any others, and liberal
construction of the pleading is as much a duty of the court in these as in
other cases.’” (Appollo Capital Fund, LLC v. Roth Capital Partners, LLC
(2007) 158 Cal.App.4th 226, 242.) The rule of specificity of pleading is
intended to apply only to affirmative representations and not to fraud by
concealment. (Alfaro, supra, 171 Cal.App.4th at 1384.) As the Alfaro
court observed: “it is harder to apply [the requirement of specificity] to a
case of simple nondisclosure. ‘How does one show “how” and “by what means”
something didn't happen, or “when” it never happened, or “where” it never
happened?’”]; see Jones, supra, 198 Cal.App.4th 1187, 1200 [concealment
is sufficiently pled when the complaint as a whole provides sufficient notice
of the claims against defendants].)
 
With the above standards in mind, the FAC
establishes the elements of fraud by omission with the requisite specificity. Plaintiff
alleges an intentional non-disclosure of a material fact by GM regarding the
pled battery defect which posed safety risks. On February 19,
2021, Plaintiff Jeffrey Soler leased
a model year 2021 Chevrolet Bolt EV, VIN 1G1FW6SOXL4130270 (the “Subject
Vehicle”), from a dealership with certain manufacturer warranties. (FAC ¶¶
7-9.) However, the subject vehicle was delivered to Plaintiff with material and
serious defects, including defects in the seatbelt pretensioner, and with the
EV battery module which limited the vehicle’s range and posed a risk of a high
voltage battery fire. (¶¶ 10-11, 31.) GM knew that the Vehicle was being
advertised and sold without disclosure of the limited range and risk of fire
posed by the defective batteries. (¶ 26.) Moreover, GM suppressed such facts in
order “to sell additional vehicles”, “avoid the cost of repair or replacement”,
and “encourage Plaintiff to purchase the defective vehicle.” (¶¶ 33-34.) Thus,
GM intended Plaintiff rely on the omissions regarding the material battery
defects in purchasing the Vehicle. Plaintiff never would have leased the
vehicle if he knew or was advised of the risk of fire posed by the battery. (¶¶
12, 28.)
 
Plaintiff
alleges a duty to disclose the truth of the material facts by establishing
facts showing GM’s exclusive knowledge of the battery defect. This battery
defect was known by GM as evidenced by numerous recalls and fixes. (¶¶ 11-24.) GM
intentionally and knowingly concealed the presence of the defective high
voltage battery pack in the Vehicle. (¶¶ 30-31.) GM knew (at the time of lease
and thereafter) that the Vehicle contained the battery defect, concealed the
defect, and never intended to replace the battery defect during the relevant
warranty periods. (¶ 32.) Thus, GM possessed “superior and exclusive knowledge”
regarding the defect. (¶ 33.) This establishes, as a
matter of ultimate fact, that Defendant “had exclusive knowledge of material
facts not known to the plaintiff[s]” which imposes a duty to disclose. (Judikins,
supra, 52 Cal. App. 4th at 337.) 
Therefore, the demurrer is OVERRULED as to the first cause of action.
 
Second Cause
of Action for UCL
 
            As an initial matter, both parties
fully briefed a demurrer to the second cause of action for negligent misrepresentation.
There is no cause of action in the FAC for negligent misrepresentation.  
 
In the FAC, the second cause of action is
for a violation of Business & Professions Code section 17200. Defendant demurs
to this cause of action, which it inaccurately labels as the third cause of
action. The true third cause of action of the FAC is for a breach of express
warranty under the Song-Beverly Act, which is not challenged by the demurrer. Considering
the arguments presented in the moving papers, the Court will consider
Defendant’s challenge to the second cause of action under section 17200.
 
Business and Professions Code section
17200 prohibits “any unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business act or practice.”
(Bus. & Prof. Code § 17200; see Clark v. Superior Court (2010) 50
Cal.4th 605, 610.) “An unlawful business practice or act is an act or practice,
committed pursuant to business activity, that is at the same time forbidden by
law.” (Klein v. Earth Elements, Inc. (1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 965, 969; see
Law Offices of Mathew Higbee v.
Expungement Assistance Services (2013)
214 Cal.App.4th 544, 554[ “Virtually any law—federal, state or local—can serve
as a predicate for a section 17200 action”].) To establish the fraud prong, plaintiff
must show that members of the public are likely to be deceived. (West v.
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (2013) 214 Cal.App.4th 780, 806.) 
 
Defendant
contends that the FAC fails to allege facts showing the unfairness or unlawfulness
of GM’s conduct. However, the FAC expressly alleges that GM’s conduct is
unlawful because it violates the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act and the
Consumer Legal Remedies Act, among other laws. (FAC ¶39.) Defendant does not
challenge or explain why the FAC fails to state a violation of such laws. (See
FAC ¶¶47-86.) Thus, the claim is well-pled.
 
Alternatively,
the FAC also states a claim under the fraud prong. Defendant asserts that the
FAC fails to establish the fraud alleged with the requisite specificity. However,
Defendant offers no authority that the UCL claim must be stated to the same
specificity as a common law fraud claim. To the contrary, the fraudulent prong of a UCL claim is
less rigorous than common law fraud, as common law fraud requires allegations
of actual falsity and reasonable reliance while fraud under UCL does not. (Morgan
v. AT&T Wireless Services, Inc. (2009) 177 Cal.App.4th 1235, 1256.) As discussed above, Plaintiff alleges
fraudulent conduct which may be fairly described as a business practice as
liberally defined by section 17200. 
 
Defendant lastly contends that Plaintiff
does not have standing to recover under the UCL. 
Defendant claims
that there are no facts supporting an injury in fact or a loss of money or
property. A private party has standing to bring a UCL claim if he or she has
suffered injury in fact and has lost money or property as a result of
Defendant’s unfair competition. (Law Offices of Mathew Higbee v. Expungement
Assistance Services (2013) 214 Cal.App.4th 544, 555-56.) “[A]n identifiable
trifle [of injury] is enough for standing . . . .” (Id. at 561.) The FAC
alleges an identifiable injury. Plaintiff alleges that the fraudulent and
unlawful conduct caused Plaintiff to lease the defective vehicle in exchange
for money. (FAC ¶¶ 27, 40-44.) Thus, Plaintiff lost money as a result of
the UCL violation. This is sufficient for standing.
 
Accordingly,
the demurrer is OVERRULED.
 
Motion
to Strike - Punitive Damages
 
First, Defendant argues that Plaintiff cannot recover punitive
damages pursuant to the Song-Beverly causes of action. However,
Plaintiff has not claimed punitive damages pursuant to those causes of action.
(See FAC ¶¶ 58-61; 69-73; 81-86.) Moreover, Defendant has identified no
portions of these causes of action to strike. Thus, there is nothing to strike.
 
Otherwise,
Defendant retreads the arguments on demurrer regarding the fraud cause of
action. Defendant reasons that without a viable fraud of claim, Plaintiff
cannot demand punitive damages. The punitive damages statute defines “Fraud” as
“an intentional misrepresentation, deceit, or concealment of a material fact
known to the defendant with the intention on the part of the defendant of
thereby depriving a person of property or legal rights or otherwise causing
injury.” (Civ. Code § 3294(c)(3).) As discussed above, the FAC establishes that
GM omitted known material facts regarding the battery defect. GM intended that Plaintiff
and others rely on the omission to induce sales, knowing it was selling
vehicles with the battery defect. Thus, the FAC establishes facts showing that
the GM intended to deprive Plaintiff of property rights or otherwise cause
injury through its omission. Therefore, fraud is established as defined by
section 3294.
 
Accordingly,
the motion is DENIED.
