BACKGROUND
 
On July 5, 2022,
Plaintiff Kayla Alvarez, in her representative capacity, filed a Complaint
against Defendants Amsurg and Pacific Surgery Center as a Private Attorneys
General Act (“PAGA”) representative action. Plaintiff alleges wage and hour violations based upon various
California Labor Codes including the following: (1) Failure to provide meal
breaks (Cal. Lab. Code 226.7, 512; (2) Failure to provide rest breaks (Cal.
Lab. Code 226.7, 515); (3) Failure to pay overtime wages (Cal. Lab. Code 510,
1194 et.seq and 1198); (4) Failure to Pay All Earned Wages (Cal. Lab. Code 221,
223); and (5) Violation of wage statement and record keeping requirements (Cal.
Lab. Code 226).
 
On July 16,
2024, Plaintiff filed the instant Motion to Approve PAGA Settlement. No
opposition was filed.
 
ANALYSIS
 
A.     
Legal
Standard
Labor Code,
section 2699 states, in pertinent part, as follows: 
“(a)
Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any provision of this code that
provides for a civil penalty to be assessed and collected by the Labor and
Workforce Development Agency or any of its departments, divisions, commissions,
boards, agencies, or employees, for a violation of this code, may, as an
alternative, be recovered through a civil action brought by an aggrieved
employee on behalf of himself or herself and other current or former employees
pursuant to the procedures specified in  
Section
2699.3… 
(i) Except as
provided in subdivision (j), civil penalties recovered by aggrieved employees
shall be distributed as follows: 75 percent to the Labor and Workforce
Development Agency for enforcement of labor laws, including the administration
of this part, and for education of employers and employees about their rights
and responsibilities under this code, to be continuously appropriated to
supplement and not supplant the funding to the agency for those purposes; and
25 percent to the aggrieved employees… 
(l)(1) For
cases filed on or after July 1, 2016, the aggrieved employee or representative
shall, within 10 days following commencement of a civil action pursuant to this
part, provide the Labor and Workforce Development Agency with a file-stamped
copy of the complaint that includes the case number assigned by the
court. 
(2) The
superior court shall review and approve any settlement of any civil action
filed pursuant to this part. The proposed settlement shall be submitted to the
agency at the same time that it is submitted to the court…” 
The Private
Attorney General Act (PAGA) allows an aggrieved employee to bring forth a
representative action to recover penalties for California labor law violations
payable to California and other aggrieved employees. (Arias v. Superior
Court (2009) 46 Cal. 4th 969, 985-86.) An action under PAGA “
‘is fundamentally a law enforcement action’ ” and relief is “ ‘designed to
protect the public and not to benefit private parties.’ ” (Id. at p.
986.) 
Once an aggrieved
employee files a PAGA lawsuit, the employee may settle that lawsuit on behalf
of the state. but such the employee must submit the proposed settlement with
the court for approval. The proposed settlement must be submitted to both the
court and the Labor and Workforce Development Agency, concurrently. (Lab. Code,
§ 2699, subds. (a) & (l)(2).)¿ 
The court has
a duty to review and approve settlements in a civil action filed under PAGA.
(Lab. Code, § 2699(l)(2).)¿However, there is no set standard that a court must
follow in reviewing a PAGA settlement. Instead, the court may exercise its
discretion to approve a settlement that is not unjust, arbitrary and
oppressive, or confiscatory. (See¿Nordstrom Com. Cases¿(2010) 186
Cal.App.4th 576, 589; see also Gov. Code, § 12652, subd. (e)(2)(B)
[standard for approval of government settlement over qui tam plaintiff’s
objection is whether the settlement is “fair, adequate, and reasonable under
all the circumstances.”].) 
The
requirement of court approval serves to prevent fraud, collusion, unfairness,
and to protect unnamed class members “whose rights may not have been given due
regard by the negotiating parties.” (Dunk v. Ford Motor Co. (1996) 48
Cal.App.4th 1794, 1800–1801.) In this role, the trial court conducts an
“independent assessment of the adequacy of the settlement terms,” which
requires that the court have before it a record from which it can discern
sufficient information about the amount in controversy and the realistic range
of outcomes. (Kullar v. Foot Locker Retail, Inc.¿(2008) 168
Cal.App.4th 116, 120, 132; Munoz v. BCI Coca-Cola Bottling Co. of Los
Angeles (2010) 186 Cal.App.4th 399, 409.)  
The court is
vested with a broad discretion in making its determination, and it may consider
a number of non-exhaustive factors in its analysis, including “the strength of
plaintiffs’ case, the risk, expense, complexity and likely duration of further
litigation, the risk of maintaining class action status through trial, the
amount offered in settlement, the extent of discovery completed and the stage
of the proceedings, the experience and views of counsel, the presence of a
governmental participant, and the reaction of the class members to the proposed
settlement.”(Dunk, supra, 48 Cal.App.4th at 1801.) 
Moreover,
given PAGA’s purpose to protect the public interest, a trial court should
evaluate a PAGA settlement to determine whether it is fair, reasonable, and
adequate in view of PAGA's purposes to remediate present labor law violations,
deter future ones, and to maximize enforcement of state labor laws.¿(Moniz
v. Adecco USA, Inc.¿(2021) 72 Cal.App.5th 56, 77; Lab. Code, §
2699(l)(2).)  
B.     
Discussion 
 
Plaintiff reached a settlement with Defendant Pacific Surgery
Center (“Defendant”). Defendant Amsurg filed for bankruptcy and has not emerged
from those proceedings. Plaintiff
and Defendant Pacific Surgery Center proceeded to litigate the claim and the
parties have agreed on the terms of a settlement.  
 
a.      
Summary of
Settlement
 
The parties
have agreed to settle the matter for the gross amount of $200,000. (Boulaev Decl.,
Ex. 1, ¶ 3.1.) The Settlement Agreement provides that a PAGA Penalty Fund of
$111,465.63 shall be paid from the $200,000 Gross Settlement Amount. The PAGA
Payment shall be distributed as follows: Seventy-five percent of the PAGA
Payment ($83,599) will be paid to the State of California LWDA. The remaining
25% of the PAGA Payment ($27,866.63) will be distributed to aggrieved
employees. (Boulaev Decl., Ex. 1, ¶ 3.2.)
 
The
Settlement Agreement also provides that (1) $66,666.66 be paid to PAGA Counsel
for payment of attorneys’ fees; (2) $1,117.71 be paid to PAGA Counsel for
payment of costs incurred; (3) $15,000 be paid to Plaintiff Kayla Alvarez as a
service award and (4) $5,750 be paid to the Phoenix Class Action Administration
Solutions for the cost of administration of the settlement. (Ibid.)
 
b.     
Notice to the
LWDA
 
Labor Code
section 2699(l)(2) requires that the settlement be provided to the Labor
Workforce Development Agency (LWDA) at the same time it is presented to the
Court. Plaintiff’s counsel declares that the settlement has been served on the
LWDA and that confirmation was received from the LWDA of the filing of the
proposed PAGA settlement through their online system. (Boulaev Decl., ¶ 6, Ex.
2.) The LWDA has not opposed the settlement. "[PAGA] authorizes a
representative action only for the purpose of seeking statutory penalties for
Labor Code violations (Lab. Code, § 2699, subds. (a), (g)), and an action to
recover civil penalties is fundamentally a law enforcement action designed to
protect the public and not to benefit private parties." (Arias v.
Superior Court (2009) 46 Cal.4th 969, 986.) There are no objections from
any aggrieved employees or others. 
 
c.      
Division of
Civil Penalties
 
"[C]ivil
penalties recovered by aggrieved employees shall be distributed as follows: 75
percent to the Labor and Workforce Development Agency for enforcement of labor
laws, including the administration of this part, and for education of employers
and employees about their rights and responsibilities under this code, to be
continuously appropriated to supplement and not supplant the funding to the
agency for those purposes; and 25 percent to the aggrieved employees."
(Lab. Code, § 2699, subd. (i).) 
 
As shown
above, the settlement properly divides the net amount of civil penalties
between the LWDA and aggrieved employees.
 
d.     
Breadth of
Release 
 
The release
in the settlement agreement is as follows: 
 
“5.2. Release by Aggrieved Employees: All Aggrieved Employees are
deemed to release, on behalf of themselves and their respective former and
present representatives, agents, attorneys, heirs, administrators, successors,
and assigns, the Released Parties from all claims for PAGA penalties that were
alleged, or reasonably could have been alleged, based on the PAGA Period facts
stated in the Operative Complaint and the PAGA Notice.” (Boulaev Decl., Ex. 1,
¶ 5.2.) 
 
The
settlement agreement's release as to absent aggrieved employees is
appropriately limited to claims for PAGA penalties based on the facts in the
complaint and does not include any individual non-PAGA claims. This is an
appropriately limited release.  
 
The scope of
Plaintiff's individual release is as follows: 
 
“5.1. Plaintiff’s Release. As of the Effective Date, and in
exchange for the PAGA Representative Service Payment to Plaintiff in an amount
not to exceed $15,000.00, and in recognition of her work and efforts in
obtaining the benefits for the LWDA and Aggrieved Employees and undertaking the
risk for the payment of costs in the event his matter had not successfully
resolved, Plaintiff hereby provides a general release of claims for herself and
any respective spouse, heirs, successors and assigns, and forever releases,
remises, and discharges the Released Parties from any and all charges,
complaints, claims, liabilities, obligations, promises, agreements,
controversies, damages, actions, causes of action, suits, rights, demands,
costs, losses, debts, penalties and expenses of any nature whatsoever, arising
from the beginning of time through the Effective Date, known or unknown,
suspected or unsuspected, whether in tort, contract, equity, or otherwise, for
violation of any federal, state or local statute, rule, ordinance or
regulation, including but not limited to all claims arising out of, based upon,
or relating to her employment with Defendants or the renumeration for, or
termination of, such employment. Plaintiff’s general release of claims includes
a waiver of California Civil Code Section 1542, set forth below. 
 
5.1.1 Plaintiff’s Waiver of Rights Under California Civil Code
Section 1542. For purposes of Plaintiff’s Release, Plaintiff expressly waives
and relinquishes the provisions, rights, and benefits, if any, of section 1542
of the California Civil Code, which reads: A general release does not extend to
claims that the creditor or releasing party does not know or suspect to exist
in his or her favor at the time of executing the release, and that if known by
him or her would have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor
or Released Party.” (Boulaev Decl., Ex. 1, ¶¶¿5.1, 5.1.1.) 
 
The Court
finds this release is likewise acceptable. 
 
e.     
Fair,
Reasonable and Adequate
 
Plaintiff
argues that the settlement should be found to be fair and reasonable.
 
Under Dunk
v. Ford Motor Co. (1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 1794, a presumption of fairness
exists where "(1) the settlement is reached through arm's-length
bargaining; (2) investigation and discovery are sufficient to allow counsel and
the court to act intelligently; (3) counsel is experienced in similar
litigation; and (4) the percentage of objectors is small." (Id. at
1802.) 
 
First, the
settlement appears to have been reached through arm's-length bargaining. Plaintiff
contends the parties engaged in informal exchanges of information and documents
and negotiations for settlement up until late January, early February 2024 at
which time they agreed upon settlement of the claim. (Boulaev Decl., ¶¶¿5-6.) As
part of informal discovery production, Defendant produced, among other things,
information about the total number of allegedly aggrieved employees, the total
pay periods at issue, and a sampling of timecards and wage statements. (Ibid.)
Defendant denies all of the allegations made by Plaintiff in the action and
denies that it is liable or owes damages or other compensation or remedies to
anyone with respect to this action. (Ibid.) Plaintiff's counsel has
extensive experience with this type of litigation. (Boulaev Decl., ¶ 3.) There
are no objectors. Plaintiff complied with the necessary Labor Code
administrative requirements, the settling parties reached a compromise through
arms-length negotiations, there was sufficient investigation and discovery by
experienced counsel to act competently in negotiating settlement, the
settlement is reasonable in light of the parties' legal positions, the risk of
continued litigation, and the underlying purpose of the PAGA. 
 
Thus, the
Court finds the settlement is therefore presumptively fair. 
 
f.       
Attorney Fees,
Costs and Service Award
 
Here,
Plaintiff requests attorney fees in the amount of $66,666.66 (33.33% of the
gross settlement amount) and litigation costs in the amount of $1,117.71. (Boulaev
Decl., ¶ 12.) The Court finds the requested attorney’s fees and costs are
reasonable.¿ Plaintiff’s counsel has sufficiently justified the $1,117.71. sought
in litigation costs.¿ (Boulaev Decl., ¶ 12.) As for the requested attorney’s
fees, Plaintiff’s counsel has set forth counsel’s experience and Plaintiff asserts
the requested fees of one third of the gross settlement amount is also
consistent with awards obtained in similar PAGA cases. (Boulaev Decl., ¶¶ 10-11;
Motion, pp. 10-11.) The Court finds the requested attorney’s fees is reasonable
and proper in this case after accounting for counsel’s experience and the
results achieved by this litigation.¿ 
 
The
settlement agreement awards Plaintiff a service award of $15,000.00. (Boulaev Decl.,
Ex. 1, ¶ 3.1.) Considering the Plaintiff’s involvement and risk taken, the
Court finds the service award of $15,000.00 to be reasonable. 
 
g.      
Settlement
Administration and Costs 
 
The Court
finds the $5,750 in settlement administration costs is reasonable.¿ Plaintiff’s
counsel has submitted a declaration sufficient to justify the $5,750 for the
settlement administrator, Phoenix Class Action Administration Solutions, to
send aggrieved employees notice and settlement checks pursuant to the PAGA
Settlement Agreement.¿(Boulaev Decl., ¶¶ 13-15, Exs. 3-4.)¿¿ 
 
Lastly, the
Court notes that no objections to the proposed settlement appear in Plaintiff’s
papers and none have been filed with the Court. The Court thus finds that the
proposed settlement is fair, reasonable, and adequate to all concerned. 
 
Based on the
foregoing, the Court GRANTS the motion and approves the PAGA settlement as set
forth in the Settlement Agreement. In sum, the Court approves and awards the
following: (1) $66,666.66 for attorney fees to Plaintiff’s counsel; (2) $1,117.71
in costs to Plaintiff’s counsel; (3) a service award in the amount of $15,000.00
to Plaintiff Kayla Alvarez; (4) $5,750 in
settlement administration costs to be paid to the Phoenix Class Action
Administration Solutions; (5) no less than $83,599 (75% of the PAGA Payment) to
LWDA; and (6) no less than $27,866.63 (25% of the PAGA Payment) to aggrieved
employees.
