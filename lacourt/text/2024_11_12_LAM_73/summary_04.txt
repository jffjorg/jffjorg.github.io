And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to compel the defendant's responses to requests for production of documents and requests for admission. The defendant, FCA US LLC, is ordered to provide verified, objection-free responses to the plaintiff's requests for production of documents within 20 days of the order. Additionally, the court deems the requests for admission to be admitted. The plaintiff, Merik Migliore, had filed the motion on September 4, 2024, and the defendant failed to respond. The court found that the defendant's failure to respond waived any objections to the requests for admission, and the court granted the plaintiff's motion to deem the requests admitted.
