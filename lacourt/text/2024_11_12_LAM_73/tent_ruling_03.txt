II.
ANALYSIS
 
A.      Legal
Standard
 
California
Rules¿of Court,¿rule 3.1362 (Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel) requires (1)
notice of motion and motion to be directed to the client (made on the Notice of
Motion and Motion to be Relieved as Counsel—Civil¿form (MC-051)); (2) a
declaration stating in general terms and without compromising the
confidentiality of the attorney-client relationship why a motion under Code of
Civil Procedure section 284(2) is brought instead of filing a consent under
Code of Civil Procedure section 284(1) (made on the Declaration in Support of
Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil¿form (MC-052)); (3) service
of the notice of motion and motion and declaration on all other parties who
have appeared in the case; and (4) the proposed order relieving counsel (prepared
on the Order Granting Attorney’s Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil¿form
(MC-053)).¿ 
 
The¿court has discretion
to allow an attorney to withdraw, and such a motion should be granted¿provided
that¿there is no prejudice to the client, and it does not disrupt the orderly
process of justice.¿¿(See¿Ramirez v.¿Sturdevant¿(1994) 21 Cal.App.4th
904, 915.)¿ 
 
B.      Discussion
Here,
Defendants’ counsel, Ilana Kaufman, seeks relief under Code of Civil Procedure,
Section 284(2). Counsel correctly completed and filed the notice (Form MC-051)
and declaration (MC-052). (Code Civ. Proc., § 284(2); Cal. Rules Court, rule
3.1362, subds. (a) & (c).) In the declarations, counsel sufficiently
explains that the motions are being brought under Section 284(2) instead of
284(1) because irreconcilable differences have arisen between the clients and
attorney making it unreasonably difficult to continue the relationship
effectively. Counsel also states there has been a breakdown in of the
attorney-client relationship and among other things, the clients have breached
their obligations under the attorney-client agreement. 
Counsel
served the notice (MC-051), the declaration (MC-052), and the proposed order
(MC-053) on Defendants. 
The
Court finds all the requirements for relief have been completed. Additionally,
trial is not scheduled in this case until December 15, 2025. Defendants have a
reasonable amount of time to obtain new counsel, such that they should not be
prejudiced by the withdrawal. Thus, the Court GRANTS the Motions to be Relieved
as Counsel to Defendants Calitex, LLC and Elias Shokrian.
 
III. DISPOSITION
 
The Motions to be
Relieved as Counsel as to Defendants Calitex, LLC and Elias Shokrian is
GRANTED.
