TENTATIVE
RULING 
 
The petition for approval of structured settlement payments is GRANTED.
 
I. BACKGROUND
 
On August 20 2024, Petitioner J.G. Wentworth Originations, LLC
(“Petitioner”) filed a petition for approval of transfer of payment rights. Petitioner
brings this petition on behalf of third party in interest, A.A. (“Payee”),
pursuant to Insurance Code §§10134 et seq. 
 
On September 9, 2024, Petitioner filed a First Amended Verified
Petition for Approval of Transfer of Payment Rights. Petitioner seeks court
approval of a proposed transfer of structured settlement payments.¿
 
No opposition was filed.
II.
DISCUSSION
 
A
direct or indirect transfer of structured settlement payment rights is not
effective unless the transfer has been approved by a court order
finding:¿¿ 
¿ 
(1) The transfer is in the best interest of the payee, considering
the welfare and support of the payee’s dependents.¿ 
(2) The payee has been advised in writing by the transferee to seek independent
professional advice regarding the transfer and has either received that advice
or knowingly waived, in writing, the opportunity to receive the advice. ¿ 
(3) The transferee has complied with the notification requirements pursuant to
paragraph (2) of subdivision (f), the transferee has provided the payee with a disclosure
form that complies with Section 10136, and the transfer agreement complies with
Sections 10136 and 10138. ¿ 
(4) The transfer does not contravene any applicable statute or the
order of any court or other government authority.¿ 
(5) The payee understands the terms of the transfer agreement, including the
terms set forth in the disclosure statement required by Section 10136. ¿ 
(6) The payee understands and does not wish to exercise the
payee’s right to cancel the transfer agreement.¿¿ 
¿ 
(Ins. Code § 10139.5(a).)¿ 
 
As a result of a personal injury settlement entered into when she
was a minor, Payee A.A. became entitled to certain structured settlement
payments. (Petition, Exh. C.)¿ 
 
The settlement agreed to by the Payee provides for the following periodic
structured payments: A) 1 payment of $40,000.00 on June 8, 2026, and B) 1
payment of $5,000.00 on June 8, 2030. Payee will be receiving $28,112.23 from this transaction. Payee
has agreed to sell, and Petitioner has agreed to purchase these lump sum
payments. 
 
The discounted present value of the amount being sold is $40,228.12,
calculated by applying the 5.2% applicable federal interest rate most recently
published by the Internal Revenue Service. (Petition, Exh. B.) Based on the
net amount that Payee will receive from Petitioner and the amounts and timing
of the structured settlement payments that Payee is turning over to Petitioner,
she will, in effect, be paying interest at a rate of 24.99% per year. (Ibid.)¿ 
¿
All of this information has been properly disclosed to Payee by
way of the disclosure form in compliance with Insurance Code § 10136, as
required by § 10139.5(a)(3). (Petition, Exh. B.) Payee was advised in writing
to seek independent professional advice, both legal and financial. (Ibid.)
Payee chose not to seek an independent professional’s advice. (Petition, Exh. D.)
Thus, Petitioner has complied with the statutory disclosure requirements. (Ins.
Code § 10139.5(a)(2).)¿ 
¿ 
The transfer agreement also complies with Insurance Code §§ 10136
and 10138 as required by § 10139.5(a)(3). It does not contravene any applicable
statute or order of any court or other governmental authority. (Ins. Code §
10139.5(a)(4).)¿¿ 
¿ 
Ins. Code § 10139.5(f)(2)(E)-(G) requires copies of the annuity
contract, qualified assignment agreement, and underlying structured settlement
agreement to be submitted with the Petition.
 
Here, Petitioner attached a copy of the proposed transfer
agreement. (Petition, Exh. A.) Payee states in her declaration that she was
unsuccessful in locating the Annuity Contract and the Qualified Assignment
Agreement. (Declaration of A.A., ¶¶ 8-10.) She states that she represented to
Petitioner that she does not have a record or copy of these documents. (Ibid.)
She also states that she is unaware of any provision in the documents that
would prohibit her from entering into a transaction to assign the rights to
receive the proposed future payments due. (Ibid.)
 
A.     
Information About Transferor¿ 
¿ 
Payee has indicated in her declaration that she resides in Los
Angeles County, California. (Declaration of A.A., ¶ 1.) 
 
The Court notes that Payee’s declaration does not provide the
information required by Insurance Code § 10139.5(c). However, this information
is provided in the Petition, which states that Payee is 19 years old, single
and expecting a baby. (Petition, p. 4.) Payee is currently unemployed. If
approved, Payee will receive $28,112.23 from this transaction. Payee feels it
is in their best interest to enter into this transaction with the Petitioner
and sell a portion of their underlying annuity payments so that they can have
the financial means to help prepare for their newborn. (Ibid.) Payee has
no court-ordered child support or maintenance obligations. (Petition, pp. 7-9.)
Payee has not attempted previous transactions involving the payee’s structured
settlement payments that were denied, or that were dismissed or withdrawn.
The future
periodic payment(s) that are the subject of the proposed transfer were not
intended to provide for medical care and treatment or necessary living expenses.
(Ibid.)
 
 
 
Given the foregoing, the
Court finds that the transfer is fair, reasonable and in the best interest of
Payee. (Insurance Code § 10139.5(a)(1) & (b)(1)-(15).)¿ The Payee
understands the terms of the transfer agreement, including those set forth in
the § 10136 disclosure statement, as required by Insurance Code §
10139.5(a)(5). In signing the Disclosure Statement, Payee has evidenced an
understanding of the right to cancel and election not to cancel the transfer
agreement, as required by Insurance Code § 10139.5(a)(6).¿ 
¿ ¿ 
Accordingly, the petition
for approval of structured settlement payments is GRANTED. 
 
III. DISPOSITION
 
The petition for approval of structured settlement payments is GRANTED
