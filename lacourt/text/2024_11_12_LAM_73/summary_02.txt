And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the petition for approval of the transfer of structured settlement payments. The petition was filed by J.G. Wentworth Originations, LLC on behalf of A.A., the payee, who is seeking to transfer her rights to receive structured settlement payments. The payments are part of a personal injury settlement that A.A. received when she was a minor. The settlement provides for periodic payments of $40,000 and $5,000, respectively, on June 8, 2026 and 2030.

The judge found that the transfer is fair, reasonable, and in the best interest of the payee, considering the welfare and support of her dependents. The payee was advised in writing to seek independent professional advice, but chose not to do so. The transfer agreement complies with the statutory disclosure requirements and does not contravene any applicable statute or court order.

The payee will receive $28,112.23 from the proposed transaction and will pay interest at a rate of 24.99% per year. The judge granted the petition, finding that the transfer is fair and reasonable and in the best interest of the payee.
