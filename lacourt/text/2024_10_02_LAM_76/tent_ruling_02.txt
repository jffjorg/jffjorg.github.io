[1]  “Absent success in a prior proceeding, a
party's later inconsistent position introduces no ‘risk of inconsistent court
determinations,’ ... and thus poses little threat to judicial integrity.”  (Jogani v Jogani (2006) 141
Cal.App.4th 158, 171 (quoting New Hampshire v. Maine (2001) 532 U.S.
742, 750-751, 121 S.Ct. 1808, 1814).)

Court may take judicial notice of “[f]acts and propositions that are not
reasonably subject to dispute and are capable of immediate and accurate
determination by resort to sources of reasonably indisputable accuracy.” (Evid.
Code § 452(h).)
