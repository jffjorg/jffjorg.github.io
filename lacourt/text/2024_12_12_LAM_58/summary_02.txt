Summary:

The Judge's Tentative Ruling grants the motion for summary judgment filed by Defendant Joseph Raymond Markowitz. The ruling is based on the Judge's determination that the termination of the Underlying Action was not a "favorable termination" for purposes of malicious prosecution. The Underlying Action was terminated based on the trial court's determination that Joseph's allegations were untrue and were intended to overcome a statute of limitations defense. The Judge found that Joseph's conduct was egregious, but did not make a determination on the merits of the claim. Therefore, the Judge held that the termination of the Underlying Action did not constitute a "favorable termination" reflecting on the merits of the action.
