  - "A refusal to comply with an order for the production of evidence is tantamount to an admission that the disobedient party really has no meritorious claim." (Hahn v. Kahn)

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the petition of State Farm Automobile Insurance Co. (Petitioner) to terminate sanctions against Mariam Ahmadi (Respondent) and order the dismissal of her demand for arbitration. The Respondent failed to comply with multiple court orders to provide discovery responses, despite being served with written discovery and having motions to compel responses granted. As a result, the Petitioner is entitled to an order granting terminating sanctions against the Respondent.

Additionally, the judge grants the Petitioner's request for monetary sanctions against the Respondent and her counsel of record in the reduced amount of $560.00. This amount is calculated based on the Petitioner's counsel's hourly rate and the time spent preparing and filing the instant motion.

The sanctions are payable within 20 days, and the Petitioner is ordered to give notice of the sanctions.
