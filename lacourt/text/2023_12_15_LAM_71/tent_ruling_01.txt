 Hearing Date:  December 15, 2023



 
Petitioner State Farm Automobile Insurance Co.’s unopposed
motion for terminating sanctions to dismiss and further bar Respondent Navid
Faizi’s Demand for Arbitration is granted.
 
Petitioner’s request for monetary sanctions against Respondent Navid
Faizi and his counsel of record is granted in the reduced amount of $560.00.  Sanctions are payable within 20 days.
 
          Petitioner State Farm Automobile Insurance Co. (“State
Farm”) (“Petitioner”) moves unopposed for terminating sanctions to
dismiss and further bar Respondent Navid Faizi’s (“Faizi”) (“Respondent”)
demand for arbitration.  (Notice of
Motion, pg. 2.)  Petitioner further moves
for monetary sanctions in the amount of $825.00 against Respondent and his
counsel of record as a result of Respondent’s failure to comply with this
Court’s 3/15/23 Ruling to serve responses to Petitioner’s discovery consisting
of form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and requests for production
within 20 days of notice of the order and other abuses of the discovery process.  (Notice of Motion, pg. 2; C.C.P §§2023.010,
2023.030, 2030.290, 2031.320.)
 
Background
On August 26, 2022,
Petitioner served written discovery on Respondent.  Petitioner never received responses to
discovery from Respondent, and on March 15, 2023, Petitioner’s motions to
compel responses to form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and requests
for production were granted by this Court. 
(3/15/23 Minute Order.) 
Respondent was also ordered to pay $825.00 in sanctions within 20 days
of the notice of the Court’s ruling.  To
date, Petitioner has not received discovery responses from Respondent or paid
the sanctions.  (Decl. of Weilbacher ¶6.)
On October 30, 2023,
Petitioner filed the instant motion. As of the date of this hearing Respondent
has not filed an opposition.
 
 Terminating Sanctions
The Court, “after
notice to any affected party . . . and after opportunity for hearing,” may
impose terminating and/or monetary sanctions for misuses of the discovery
process.  (C.C.P. §2023.030(a) and
(d).)  Misuses of the discovery process
include failing to respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery
and disobeying a court order to provide discovery.  (C.C.P. §§2023.010(d), (g).)  
“A decision to order
terminating sanctions should not be made lightly. But where a violation is
willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less
severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the
trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction.”  (Mileikowsky v. Tenet Healthsystem (2005)
128 Cal.App.4th 262, 279-280.)  When
deciding whether to impose terminating sanctions, courts generally weigh three
factors: (1) whether the party subject to the sanction acted willfully, (2) the
detriment to the party seeking discovery, and (3) the number of formal and
informal unsuccessful attempts to obtain discovery.  (Creed-21 v. City of Wildomar (2017) 18
Cal.App.5th 690, 702; Lang v. Hochman (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 1225, 1246.)  Nonmonetary sanctions require evidence of
willful violations of discovery orders or a history of egregious abuses of
discovery.  (R.S. Creative, Inc. v.
Creative Cotton, Ltd. (1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 486.)  A prerequisite to the imposition of
nonmonetary sanctions is willful disobedience of a court order.  (New Albertsons, Inc. v. Superior Court
(2008) 168 Cal.App.4th 1403.)  By
requiring a violation of a discovery order before imposing nonmonetary
sanctions, California courts can be sure that the offending party does not
intend to comply with the discovery request.  (Ruvalcaba v. Government Employees Insurance
Co. (1990) 222 Cal.App.3d 1579, 1581.) 
“[A] terminating sanction issued solely because of a failure to pay a
monetary discovery sanction is never justified.”  (Newland v. Superior Court (1995) 40
Cal.App.4th 608, 615.)
          Petitioner moves for terminating sanctions on the grounds Respondent
has failed to produce discovery responses in violation of this Court’s order,
and such a failure to produce responses has prevented Petitioner from preparing
for arbitration or defend against Respondent’s claims.  (Decl. of Weilbacher ¶7; Motion, pg. 9; Creed-21,
18 Cal.App.5th at pg. 702.)
          The Court finds Petitioner is entitled to an order granting
terminating sanctions against Respondent.  Respondent has failed to timely provide
complete responses to Petitioner’s discovery even after Respondent was ordered
by this Court to provide discovery responses. 
A refusal to comply with an order for the production of evidence is
tantamount to an admission that the disobedient party really has no meritorious
claim.  (Hahn v. Kahn (1977) 68 Cal.App.3d
372, 382.)
Based on the foregoing,
Petitioner’s motion for terminating sanctions is granted.        
 
Monetary
Sanctions
In
addition to or in lieu of any other sanction, the court may order the
disobedient party or counsel responsible or both to pay the reasonable
expenses, including attorney fees, incurred as a result of the failure to obey
(including fees on the sanctions motion).  (C.C.P. §2023.030(a); see Marriage of
Niklas (1989) 211 Cal.App.3d 28, 37-38 [holding declarations did not show
fees were for services related to opposing party’s failure to comply with prior
orders].)
Petitioner
requests monetary sanctions in the amount of $825.00 against Respondent and
his counsel of record incurred from reasonable expenses, attorneys’ fees, and
costs in connection with the preparation, filing, and service of the instant
motion.  Petitioner’s counsel declares
“reasonable compensation is $250.00 per hour,” which the Court interprets as
counsel’s declaration of their hourly rate, and that counsel spent 2 hours in
preparation of this motion, in addition to the filing fee of $60.00.  (Decl. of Weilbacher ¶8.)  The Court determines Petitioner’s counsel’s
hourly rate is reasonable based on the experience of the Court.  Petitioner’s request for monetary sanctions
is granted in the reduced amount of $560.00 ([$250/hour x 2 hours] + $60.00).
Based on the foregoing,
Petitioner’s motion for monetary sanctions against Respondent and her counsel
of record is granted in the reduced amount of $560.00.  Sanctions are payable within 20 days.
