Plaintiff The People of the State of California,
acting by and through the California Department of Transportation (“State”) (“Plaintiff”)
moves unopposed for an order for possession of the property designated
in the complaint on file in this proceeding as Parcel 81710-1.  (Notice of Motion, pg. 2; C.C.P. §1255.410.)  Plaintiff requests this Court immediately issue
an order for possession of Parcel 81710-1, authorizing Plaintiff to take possession
of Parcel 81710-1 on Tuesday, January 30, 2024, or on the thirtieth (30th) day following
the date of service of the order, whichever is later.  (Notice of Motion, pg. 2.)
 
Background
Plaintiff is currently engaged in a project
on Pacific Coast Highway/State Route (SR)-1 from Paseo De Las Delicias in
Redondo Beach to Dewey Street in Santa Monica (“Project”) in order to preserve
and extend the life of the existing pavement adjacent too SR-1 and to improve
ride quality (e.g., Caltrans is upgrading existing curb ramps to bring them
into compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), repairing
concrete pavement, reconstructing bus pads, etc.).  (Decl. of Dan Murdoch ¶4.)
Defendant Lincoln Inn, LLC, is the record
owner of real property at 2447 Lincoln Blvd, Venice, CA 90291 (“Subject
Property”). The right of way required from the Subject Property consists of 175
square feet in Highway Easement. The larger parcel is located within the Venice
neighborhood in the city of Los Angeles. It comprises 16,492 square feet of land and is improved
with a motel, The Lincoln Inn.  (Decl. of Dan Murdoch ¶6.)
Plaintiff filed the operative complaint in
Eminent Domain on June 1, 2023, seeking to acquire by eminent domain of Parcel
81710-1.  Parcel 81710-1 is described as
follows:
For State Highway purposes, a Highway Easement, in, to, over and across
that portion of Lot 7 of Tract No. 1112, in the City of Los Angeles, County of
Los Angeles, State of California, as shown on a map recorded in Book 17, Page
120 of Maps in the Office of the County Recorder of said Los Angeles County,
lying southeasterly and northeasterly from the following described line:
 
COMMENCING at the intersection of the centerline of Lincoln Boulevard
with the centerline of Coeur D’Alene Avenue as shown on Tract No. 18591, filed
in Book 529, Pages 1 and 2 of Maps in said Office of the County Recorder of Los
Angeles County; thence along said centerline of Lincoln Boulevard North
59°40'23" West 41.89 feet; thence leaving said centerline at a right angle
South 30°19'37" West 50.00 feet to a point on the southwesterly right-of-way

Avenue noted herein refer to centerlines re-established per Caltrans SR 18084.
 
(Complaint ¶3.)
Plaintiff filed the instant motion on September
15, 2023.  On December 7, 2023, Plaintiff
filed a notice of non-opposition.  As of
the date of this hearing no opposition has been filed.
 
Legal Standard
C.C.P. §1255.410(a) provides, as
follows:
At the time of filing
the complaint or at any time after filing the complaint and prior to entry of
judgment, the plaintiff may move the court for an order for possession under
this article, demonstrating that the plaintiff is entitled to take the property
by eminent domain and has deposited pursuant to Article 1 (commencing with
Section 1255.010) an amount that satisfies the requirements of that article.
 
The motion shall
describe the property of which the plaintiff is seeking to take possession,
which description may be by reference to the complaint, and shall state the
date after which the plaintiff is seeking to take possession of the property.
The motion shall include a statement substantially in the following form: “You
have the right to oppose this motion for an order of possession of your
property. If you oppose this motion you must serve the plaintiff and file with
the court a written opposition to the motion within 30 days from the date you
were served with this motion.” If the written opposition asserts a hardship, it
shall be supported by a declaration signed under penalty of perjury stating
facts supporting the hardship.
 
(C.C.P. §1255.410(a).)
 
          “The plaintiff shall serve a copy of
the motion on the record owner of the property and on the occupants, if any.
The plaintiff shall set the court hearing on the motion not less than 60 days
after service of the notice of motion on the record owner of unoccupied
property. If the property is lawfully occupied by a person dwelling thereon or
by a farm or business operation, service of the notice of motion shall be made
not less than 90 days prior to the hearing on the motion.”  (C.C.P. §1255.410(b).)
          “If the motion is not opposed within
30 days of service on each defendant and occupant of the property, the court
shall make an order for possession of the property if the court finds each of
the following: (A) The
plaintiff is entitled to take the property by eminent domain. (B) The plaintiff has deposited
pursuant to Article 1 (commencing with Section 1255.010) an amount that
satisfies the requirements of that article.” 
(C.C.P. §1255.410(d)(1).)  
 
Discussion
Plaintiff
established that it is entitled to take the property by eminent domain.  (C.C.P. §1255.410(d)(1)(A).)  Plaintiff is a public entity with
condemnation authority pursuant to C.C.P. §§1230.010-1273.050 (particularly
C.C.P. §§1240.510 and 1240.610) (“Eminent Domain Law”), and Article 1, Section
19 of the California Constitution.
A
public entity may not commence an eminent domain proceeding until its governing
body has adopted a Resolution of Necessity (“RON”).  (C.C.P. §1245.220.)  The governing body for the State of
California, Department of Transportation, is the California Transportation
Commission.  (C.C.P. §1245.210(e).)
On
March 23, 2023, at a meeting held in Los Angeles, California, the California Transportation
Commission passed and adopted RON No. C-22252, declaring that the property that
is the subject of this proceeding is necessary for state highway purposes.  (Decl. of Farr ¶7, Exh. A.)  A resolution adopted by the governing body of
the public entity pursuant to the Eminent Domain Law conclusively establishes
that the parcel described is necessary for the construction of a necessary
public project.  (C.C.P. §1245.250.)
Plaintiff
has also established it made a deposit of the probable amount of just
compensation.  (C.C.P. §§1255.410(d)(1)(B),
(d)(2)(B).)  On May 26, 2023, Plaintiff
deposited with the State Treasurer the sum of $17,000 pursuant to C.C.P.
§1255.010(a), representing the probable amount of compensation for the taking
of Parcel 81710-1.  (Decl. of Romero ¶3,
Exh. A.)
Assuming,
arguendo, the motion is opposed, Plaintiff can establish that it has an
overriding need to possess the subject property prior to the issuance of final
judgment in the case, and that the State will suffer a substantial hardship if the
application for possession is denied or limited.  (C.C.P.
§1255.410(d)(2)(C).)  Plaintiff
has established that acquisition of the subject parcel is necessary for the
construction of a necessary public project because (a) the California
Transportation Commission passed and adopted RON No. C-22252, declaring that
the property that is the subject of this proceeding is necessary for state
highway purposes, and (b) a resolution adopted by the governing body of the
public entity pursuant to the Eminent Domain Law conclusively establishes that
the parcel described is necessary for the construction of a necessary public
project.  (C.C.P. §1245.250.)
Plaintiff
has an overriding need for prejudgment possession of Parcel 81710-1 because the
construction of the Project as a whole will be delayed without it, as timely
construction on the subject property is critical and necessary to the timely
completion of the Project.  (Decl. of Murdoch
¶8.)  Plaintiff seeks to acquire a
highway easement over 175 square feet from the subject parcel, encompassing
existing sidewalk and curb adjacent to SR-1.  (Decl. of Murdoch ¶¶4-5.)  Said acquisition is part of the Project, a
public project which mainly seeks to upgrade existing curb ramps to
comply with the ADA and to repair concrete pavement adjacent to SR-1.  (Decl. of Murdoch ¶4; Decl. of Farr ¶5.)
Plaintiff’s
Deputy District Director for the Division of Design for District 7 of the State
of California, Department of Transportation, Gregory Farr (“Farr”), declares
that work on the Project will be carried out in sequences according to Project
sections, or corridors.  (See Decl.
of Farr ¶8.)  Farr declares this in part
explained by Plaintiff’s contractual requirement to obtain prejudgment
possession of all parcels within a Project section to ensure its contractors
have concurrent access to all of them.  (Decl.
of Farr ¶6.)  Plaintiff’s contractors
require concurrent access to several parcels of land in a given Project section
in order to work on their final design, acquisition, and construction in
parallel/synchrony.  (Decl. of Farr ¶8.)  Only through concurrent access to all parcels
in a given Project section can the State’s contractors timely complete
construction of a given section and the Project, overall.  (Decl. of Farr ¶8.)
Here,
Plaintiff’s Right of Way Division has determined that pre-judgment possession
of Parcel 81710-1 is needed to complete Projected-related construction on that
parcel, as well as all other parcels that encompass the Project section
concerned.  (Decl. of Murdoch ¶6; Decl.
of Farr ¶6.)  Thus, the sequenced
construction on the subject property will need to be carried out well before
trial of the underlying action. However, if Plaintiff cannot obtain prejudgment
possession of the subject property, then construction for the affected Project
section will be delayed, which in turn will delay construction/progress of the
overall Project. (Decl. of Murdoch ¶8; Decl. of Farr ¶9.)
In
addition, Plaintiff has an overriding need for prejudgment possession of the
subject property to mitigate its liability/losses and to ensure funding for the
Project. Only through prejudgment possession of the subject parcel can the
State avoid construction delays, promptly advance construction of the Project,
and ensure continued funding necessary to construct the Project.  (Decl. of Farr ¶9.)  Therefore, Plaintiff can establish that it
has an overriding need to possess the subject property prior to the issuance of
final judgment in the case.
Plaintiff
can also establish that it will suffer a substantial hardship if the instant application
for prejudgment possession is denied or limited in that (1) construction of the
Project will be delayed and costs will increase (i.e., costs of labor and
material) because (a) the Project for which this parcel is being acquired must
be advertised for construction by a certain date, (b) the selected contractor
will need concurrent access to multiple parcels of the affected corridor,
including the subject parcel, to complete the Project, or else the State will have
to suspend the Project, leading to continued difficulties and safety concerns
for the motoring public, and (c) the State will have to pay delay damages to
the contractor in the amount of $16,000 per workday. (Decl. of Murdoch ¶8;
Decl. of Farr ¶10.)
Finally,
the hardship to the State if prejudgment possession is denied or limited
outweighs any arguable hardship to the defendants. First, delays in acquiring
the subject property will immediately delay construction in the Project section
concerned and will affect the overall construction of the Project, which will
lead to increased costs in labor and services. (Decl. of Farr ¶10.)  Plaintiff could also lose millions of dollars
already invested in the Project and it could be exposed to abandonment costs, as
well.  (Decl. of Murdoch ¶8; Decl. of
Farr ¶10.)
In
contrast, the appraised value of the subject property that the State seeks to
acquire is $17,000.  (See Decl. of
Romero ¶3, Exh. A.)  The current property
owner will receive at minimum this amount as just compensation in condemnation.
Further, the State previously negotiated in an effort to reach a resolution for
possession with the property owner, but to no avail.  (Decl. of Murdoch ¶10.) The defendant owner
has made no allegations tending to show it will suffer any hardship if it
receives the just compensation sooner, upon an order of pre-judgment possession,
rather than later, after final judgment.
Based
on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s unopposed motion is granted.
 
Conclusion
Plaintiff’s unopposed motion for an
order for possession of the property designated in the complaint on file in
this proceeding as Parcel 81710-1 is granted. 
Plaintiff is authorized to take possession of Parcel 81710-1 on Tuesday,
January 30, 2024.
Moving Party to give notice.
