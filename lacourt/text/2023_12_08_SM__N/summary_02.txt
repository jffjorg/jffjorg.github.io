And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling by the judge in a case between David Weijian Su (Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant) and Qian "Caroline" Wang (Defendant/Cross-Complaint). The judge sustains the defendant's demurrer to the first cause of action without leave to amend, which means that the defendant does not have to respond to the plaintiff's breach of contract claim. The judge also orders the plaintiff to strike the second cause of action (partition) and the third cause of action (declaratory relief) from the complaint, as they were not authorized by the court's previous orders. The plaintiff is also ordered to file and serve an answer to the remaining causes of action within 10 days of entry of the order.
