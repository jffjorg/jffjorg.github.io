```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to release the property from the mechanic's lien. The defendant, Nobel Benedict LLC, claimed that the lien was invalid because the plaintiff's assignor, Sabby Aquascapes Design Group, Inc., failed to provide timely 20-day preliminary notice before recording the lien. The judge found that Sabby failed to provide the required notice, and therefore, the plaintiff cannot demonstrate the probable validity of its lien. The judge relied on Civil Code sections 8200, 8410, and 8204, as well as case law, to support its decision. The defendant's motion is granted, and it is ordered to give notice.
