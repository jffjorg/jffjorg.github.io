The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the defendants' motion to compel arbitration. The court finds that the parties did not exempt claims for injunctive relief from arbitration. The arbitration agreement does not explicitly carve out claims for injunctive relief, and the court concludes that the parties did not intend to exempt such claims. As a result, the court orders that the action be stayed pending completion of binding arbitration. A status conference to discuss the arbitration is scheduled for November 15, 2024.
