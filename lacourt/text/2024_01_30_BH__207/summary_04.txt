And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case. The Defendant intends to erect temporary chain link fencing during the construction of a new security wall, but it is unclear whether this will adequately protect children from the pool. The Plaintiff contends that if the wall fence is removed, there will be no safety barrier between their backyard pool and the children attending the Defendant's schools, posing a threat to their safety. However, the Judge finds that this danger can be rectified by the Plaintiff erecting a fence around their pool within their own property line, and does not require an exclusive easement over the disputed area. The Judge concludes that there is a reasonable probability that the Plaintiff will prevail on the merits of the second cause of action, and therefore does not analyze the remaining causes of action.
