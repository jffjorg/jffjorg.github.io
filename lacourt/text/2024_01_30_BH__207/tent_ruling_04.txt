[1] Defendant has indicated it intends to erect temporary
chain link fencing during the construction of the new security wall, but it is
unclear whether such temporary fencing will adequately protect children from
the pool.


[2] Plaintiffs do contend that if the wall fence is
removed, there will be no safety barrier between Plaintiffs’ backyard pool and
the children attending Defendant’s schools, posing a threat to their
safety.  However, this danger can be
rectified by Plaintiffs erecting a fence around their pool within their own
property line, and does not require that Plaintiffs have an exclusive easement
over the disputed area.


[3] Because the Court finds a reasonable probability that
Plaintiff will prevail on the merits of the second cause of action, it does not
analyze the remaining causes of action.
