Plaintiff Pacific Carpets, LLC



 
BACKGROUND
 
On August 10, 2023, the Court
granted Plaintiff Pacific Carpets, LLC’s (“Plaintiff” or “Pacific”) motion for
summary adjudication.  (See August 10,
2023 Minute Order.)  Pacific subsequently
dismissed the remaining causes of action, and judgment was entered in favor of Pacific
on November 20, 2023.  (See November 20,
2023 Judgment.)  On December 18, 2023, Pacific
filed a memorandum of costs, seeking $1,435.00 in filing and motion fees; $244.27
for service of process; $6,129.00 in surety bond premiums, and $859.20 for
“Case Anywhere Pro-Rata Fees Mandated by Court Order.”  (MC-025.) 

 
Defendant PPF AMLI 4242 Via Marina,
LLC (“AMLI” or “Defendant”) has moved to strike, or in the alternative tax $500
in filing and motion fees associated with Pacific’s unsuccessful first Motion
for Summary Judgment and the entire $6,129 in surety bond premiums.  
 
Pacific opposes the motion and AMLI
replies.  
 
DISCUSSION
 
I.                  
Motion to Tax Costs
 
“Except as otherwise expressly
provided by statute, a prevailing party is entitled as a matter of right to
recover costs in any action or proceeding.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1032, subd. (b).) 
“Prevailing party” includes, among other things, “a defendant where
neither plaintiff nor defendant obtains any relief, and a defendant as against
those plaintiffs who do not recover any relief against that defendant.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1032, subd. (a)(4).)
 
Code of Civil Procedure section
1033.5, subdivision (a) sets forth items that are allowable as costs. Allowable
costs under Section 1033.5 must be “reasonably necessary to the conduct of this
litigation rather than merely convenient or beneficial to its preparation” and
“reasonable in amount.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subds. (c)(2), (3).) “Items
not mentioned in [Section 1033.5] and items assessed upon application may be
allowed or denied in the court’s discretion.” (Id., subd. (c)(4).)
 
On a motion to tax, “[i]f the items
appearing in a cost bill appear to be proper charges, the burden is on the
party seeking to tax costs to show that they were not reasonable or necessary.
On the other hand, if the items are properly objected to, they are put in issue
and the burden of proof is on the party claiming them as costs. Whether a cost
item was reasonably necessary to the litigation presents a question of fact for
the trial court and its decision is reviewed for abuse of discretion. However, because
the right to costs is governed strictly by statute a court has no discretion to
award costs not statutorily authorized.” (Ladas v. California State Auto.
Assn. (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 761, 774, internal citations omitted.) “The
court’s first determination, therefore, is whether the statute expressly allows
the item, and whether it appears proper on its face. If so, the burden is on
the objecting party to show them to be unnecessary or unreasonable.” (Nelson
v. Anderson (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 111, 131, internal citations omitted.)
The objecting party does not meet this burden by arguing that the costs were
not necessary or reasonable, but must present evidence and prove that the costs
are not recoverable. (Litt v Med. Ctr. (2015) 237 Cal.App.4th 1217,
1224; Seever v. Copley Press, Inc. (2006) 141 Cal.App.4th 1550, 1557.)
 
The parties do not dispute that
Plaintiff is the “prevailing party” as the party in whose favor judgment was
entered, following Plaintiff’s successful motion for summary adjudication.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1032.)  Thus, in general, Plaintiff is entitled to
its costs.  AMLI disputes Pacific’s claim
for (1) the $500 in filing and motion fees associated with Plaintiff’s first
unsuccessful motion for summary judgment; and (2) the entire $6,129.00 claimed
in surety bond premiums.             
 
1.      Unsuccessful
Motion for Summary Judgment
 
            Prior to
filing what ended up being Pacific’s successful motion for summary judgment or
in the alternative adjudication, Pacific initially filed           an unsuccessful motion for summary judgment, which was
denied due to Pacific’s failure to include a certified copy of its licensure
history.  (See March 7, 2023 Minute
Order.)
 
            Pacific
subsequently filed a substantially similar motion for summary judgment/adjudication,
with licensure history included, and which affirmatively addressed some of the
points AMLI raised in opposition to the original motion.  The Court granted summary adjudication in
Pacific’s favor as to most of Pacific’s causes of action.  (See August 10, 2023 Minute Order.)
 
            Code of
Civil Procedure section 1033.5, subd. (c)(2) provides, “Allowable costs shall
be reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation rather than merely
convenient or beneficial to its preparation.”
 
            AMLI
contends Pacific is not entitled to recover the $500 in filing and motion fees
associated with the first unsuccessful motion for summary judgment, because
they were “merely convenient” but “not reasonably necessary” to the conduct of
the litigation.
 
            In
opposition, Pacific points out that there is no authority supporting the
proposition that unsuccessful motions are excluded from allowable costs.  In support, Pacific cites to Akins, v.
Enter. Rent-A-Acar Co. of San Francisco (2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 1127, 1133-1134,
which held, in the context of attorneys’ fees, that fees incurred making
unsuccessful attacks are recoverable “to the extent that those attacks led to a
successful claim.”
 
            Pacific
also argues that because the first motion “ferreted out” AMLI’s defenses,
Pacific was able to address those arguments more fully in the second motion,
which ultimately prevailed.
 
            The Court
agrees with Pacific.  AMLI has provided
no authority that requires the Court to exclude filing fees and costs
associated with a prior, unsuccessful motion. 
Under the circumstances, Pacific’s first unsuccessful motion for summary
judgment was “reasonably necessary” to the conduct of the litigation.
 
2.      Surety
Bond Premiums
 
             AMLI next argues that it should not be
responsible for the $6,129.00 in surety bond premiums because the bonds were
not necessary, as there was no lender involved here.
 
            Pacific
counters in opposition that AMLI should be responsible for the surety bond
premiums because: (1) at the time Pacific obtained the surety bonds, Pacific
was not privy to AMLI’s corporate structures, how the project was being funded,
or the interrelationship among the various AMLI entities and whether they acted
as a lender, because Pacific had no direct relationship with AMLI; (2) the
bonds were reasonably necessary both to ensure compliance and to protect
Pacific in the event of non-compliance; (3) Code of Civil Procedure section
1033.5, subd. (a)(6) expressly authorizes recovery of premiums on necessary
surety bonds; and (4) AMLI’s refusal to pay Pacific was the direct and
proximate cause of Pacific obtaining the bond and serving the stop notice 
 
            The Court
agrees with Pacific that while the surety bonds may have turned out, in
hindsight, not to be strictly necessary, they were “reasonably” necessary to
incur for Pacific to pursue all its rights to be paid for the work it
performed.  
 
II.               
Motion to Strike
 
Any party, within the time allowed
to respond to a pleading, may serve and file a motion to strike the whole
pleading or any part thereof.  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 435, subd. (b)(1); Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1322(b).)  On a motion to strike, the court may: (1)
strike out any irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading;
or (2) strike out all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in
conformity with the laws of California, a court rule, or an order of the
court.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 436, subd.
(a)-(b); Stafford v. Shultz (1954) 42
Cal.2d 767, 782.)  
 
Here, AMLI has not identified any
pleading containing irrelevant, false, or improper matter or not drawn in
conformity with the laws of California, a court rule, or an order of the court.
 
CONCLUSION AND
ORDER
 
Therefore, the Court denies AMLI’s
motion to strike/tax costs in its entirety. 
 
AMLI shall provide notice of the
Court’s ruling and file a proof of service regarding the same.
