 Case Number:  23SMCV03651    Hearing Date:   May 8, 2024    Dept:  205 HEARING DATE:  March 8, 2024 JUDGE/DEPT:  Moreton/Beverly Hills, 205 CASE NAME: Creditors Adjustment Bureau, Inc. v. The Contractor GAL, et al.  CASE NUMBER:  23SMCV03651  COMP. FILED:  August 8, 2023    PROCEEDINGS:  REQUEST FOR ENTRY OF DEFAULT JUDGMENT MOVING PARTY:  Creditors Adjustment Bureau, Inc. RESPONDING PARTY: The Contractor GAL   BACKGROUND This case arises from the failure to pay insurance premiums.  The State Compensation Insurance Fund entered into a written agreement with Defendant The Contractor GAL to provide two policies for workers compensation insurance, Policy No. 9247285-21 and 9247285-22.  Defendant breached the policies by failing to pay premiums in the amount of $89,770.36 as to Policy No. 9247285-21 and $1,580 as to Policy No. 9247285-22.  The State Compensation Insurance Fund assigned its claims to Plaintiff Creditors Adjustment Bureau Inc.       On August 8, 2023, Plaintiff filed a Complaint against Defendant.  The Complaint alleges four claims for (1) breach of contract, (2) open book account, (3) account stated, and (4) reasonable value.  The Complaint seeks $91,350.36 in damages plus interest at the statutory rate of 10% per annum.    Plaintiff filed a proof of service showing Defendant was served by substitute service on September 19, 2023.  Defendant was obligated to respond within 30 days. Defendant did not do so. Plaintiff successfully requested the entry of Defendant’s default, which was entered by the Clerk’s Office on November 27, 2023.  Plaintiff requested a default judgment on December 28, 2023. Plaintiff served Defendant by mail with both the Request for Entry of Default and Request for Default Judgment.  Defendant has not appeared.  RELIEF REQUESTED  Default judgment against Defendant for a total of $104,604.88, which is comprised of: (1) $91,350.36, for damages, (2) $11,416.08 for interest, (3) $1,200 for attorneys’ fees and (4) $638.44 for costs.   ANALYSIS  Code of Civil Procedure section 585 sets forth the two options for obtaining a default judgment. First, where the plaintiff’s complaint¿seeks compensatory damages only, in a sum certain which is readily ascertainable from the allegations of the complaint or statement of damages, the clerk may enter the default judgment for that amount. However, if the relief requested in the complaint is more complicated, consisting of either nonmonetary relief, or monetary relief in amounts which require either an accounting, additional evidence, or the exercise of judgment to ascertain, the plaintiff must request entry of judgment by the court. In such cases, the plaintiff must affirmatively establish his entitlement to the specific judgment requested.¿ (Kim v. Westmoore Partners, Inc. (2011) 201 Cal.App.4th 267, 287.)  Section 585 also allows for interest, costs and attorney fees, where otherwise allowed by law. (Code of Civ. Proc. § 585(a).)  Multiple specific documents are required, such as: (1) form CIV 100, (2) a brief summary of the case; (3) declarations or other admissible evidence in support of the judgment requested; (4) interest computations as necessary; (5) a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (6) a proposed form of judgment; (7) a dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application for separate judgment under Code Civ. Proc. § 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment; (8) exhibits as necessary; and (9) a request for attorneys’ fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.  (CRC Rule 3.1800.)  Here, Plaintiff has properly complied with all the substantive and procedural requirements for a default judgment. Substantively, Plaintiff declares via declaration that there have been damages in the amount of $91,350.36.  A memorandum of costs in the amount of $638.44 is set forth in Item 10 of the CIV-100 form.  Attorneys’ fees are allowed under Civ. Code 1717.5, and Plaintiff has submitted a declaration calculating the amount of fees sought (of $1,200).  Plaintiff has also submitted a declaration calculating the amount of interest sought, at the legal rate of 10% per annum (or $11,416.08).  The evidence submitted is authenticated by further declaration.  Procedurally, Plaintiff properly served Defendant more than 30 days prior to requesting entry of default and default judgment, correctly completed JC Form CIV-100 in a manner that would not void or put at issue the entry of default, provided a declaration of non-military status, requested damages in amounts supported by the filings and not in excess of the amount stated in the Complaint, and filed a proposed judgment (JUD-100).   As default has already been entered and there has been no appearance or filing whatsoever from Defendant, default judgment is appropriate here.  CONCLUSION AND ORDER   For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff Creditors Adjustment Bureau, Inc.’s Request for Default Judgment against Defendant The Contractor GAL is GRANTED.  Judgment is awarded in favor of Plaintiff in the amount of $104,604.88.
