And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Court grants in part and denies in part the motion to enforce the deposition subpoena and for sanctions. The Court grants the motion to compel as to categories 12-13, as limited to the period on or after April 26, 2015, when Mrs. Pearlman died. The Court denies the motion for sanctions as the County Assessor did not oppose the motion in bad faith or without substantial justification. The Court rules in favor of the County Assessor as to categories 9-11 and substantially narrows the scope of categories 12-13. The Court finds that the documents are relevant and there is no law preventing their disclosure. The Court grants the motion to enforce categories 12-13 of the deposition subpoena.
