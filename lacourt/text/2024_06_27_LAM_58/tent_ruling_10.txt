[1]           On May 24, 2024, Plaintiff
filed “Plaintiff
[sic] Answer Motion to Dismiss with Prejudice.” On June 11,
2024, Plaintiff also filed a “Motion for leave to file Amended Complaint” and declaration.
Both filings appear to act as oppositions to the anti-SLAPP. While the filings
both clearly violate California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1113, the Court will,
nonetheless, consider all the “opposition” papers.
