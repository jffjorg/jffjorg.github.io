And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendants, Anthony Lazo and Yvette Lazo, have moved to strike the complaint filed by the plaintiff, Alejandro Rios, as a strategic lawsuit against public participation (SLAPP). The plaintiff alleged that the defendants made false statements accusing him of sending inappropriate text messages while he was working as a Lyft driver. The defendants argued that their statements were made in connection with a judicial proceeding and are therefore protected by the litigation privilege.

The court found that the defendants' statements were indeed made in connection with a judicial proceeding, specifically in the context of a request for a restraining order in the San Bernardino Superior Court. The court also found that the plaintiff's claims have no merit and are therefore subject to being stricken as a SLAPP.

The court granted the defendants' motion to strike the complaint and ordered the plaintiff to pay the defendants' reasonable attorneys' fees and costs. The court also noted that the plaintiff may not frustrate the hearing of the anti-SLAPP motion by amending the complaint.
