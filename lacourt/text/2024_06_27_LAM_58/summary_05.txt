And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a demurrer filed by the plaintiff, a foreign corporation, and is determining whether the plaintiff is qualified to bring an action. The judge notes that if the plaintiff is required to comply with Corporations Code section 2105, the matter may be stayed or dismissed without prejudice if the plaintiff fails to comply. The judge also rules that evidence may be considered on demurrer and that the plaintiff may be required to pay fees, penalties, and taxes. The judge's ruling is tentative and is not intended to be a final decision, but rather to determine that the plaintiff appears to be a party to the Furniture Agreement at the pleading stage.
