 
            This is a defamation action.
Plaintiff Alejandro Rios (Plaintiff) sued Defendants Anthony Lazo and Yvette
Lazo (Defendants) for their statements falsely accusing Plaintiff of sending
inappropriate text messages to Defendants in Plaintiff’s capacity as their Lyft
driver. The Complaint alleges causes of action for (1.) defamation, and (2.) defamation
“based on lack of identity.” 
 
            On April 26, 2024, Defendants filed
a Special Motion to Strike the Complaint pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 425.16 (anti-SLAPP motion). Plaintiff opposed the anti-SLAPP motion.[1]
 
            The special motion to strike
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16 is granted.
 
Legal
Standard
 
“A cause of action against a person
arising from any act of that person in furtherance of the person’s right of
petition or free speech under the United States Constitution or the California
Constitution in connection with a public issue shall be subject to a special
motion to strike, unless the court determines that the plaintiff has
established that there is a probability that the plaintiff will prevail on the
claim.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 425.16, subd. (b)(1).) The purpose of the statute
is to identify and dispose of lawsuits brought to chill the valid exercise of a
litigant’s constitutional right of petition or free speech. (Code Civ. Proc., §
425.16, subd. (a); Sylmar Air
Conditioning v. Pueblo Contracting Services, Inc. (2004) 122 Cal.App.4th
1049, 1055-1056.)
 
Courts employ a two-step process to
evaluate special motions to strike strategic lawsuits against public
participation (SLAPP). (Equilon
Enterprises v. Consumer Cause, Inc. (2002) 29 Cal.4th 53, 61.)  First, the defendant must show that the
challenged lawsuit arises from protected activity, such as an act in
furtherance of the right of petition or free speech. (Ibid.) “The moving defendant bears the burden of identifying all
allegations of protected activity, and the claims supported by them.” (Baral
v. Schmitt (2016) 1 Cal.5th 376, 396.) In the second step, it “
‘is then up to the plaintiff to rebut the presumption by showing a reasonable
probability of success on the merits.’ ” (Equilon,
supra, 29 Cal.4th at p.
61.) In determining whether the plaintiff has carried this burden, the
trial court considers “the pleadings, and supporting and opposing affidavits
stating the facts upon which the liability or defense is based.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 425.16, subd. (b)(2); see Soukup
v. Law Offices of Herbert Hafif (2006) 39 Cal.4th 260, 291 (Soukup).)
 
“Analysis of an anti-SLAPP motion is
not confined to evaluating whether an entire cause of action, as pleaded by the
plaintiff, arises from protected activity or has merit. Instead, courts should
analyze each claim for relief—each act or set of acts supplying a basis for
relief, of which there may be several in a single pleaded cause of action—to
determine whether the acts are protected and, if so, whether the claim they
give rise to has the requisite degree of merit to survive the motion.” (Bonni
v. St. Joseph Health System (2021) 11 Cal.5th 995, 1010.) 
 
Discussion
 
I.              
Arising
from Protected Activity
 
As outlined above, in the first step
of the analysis, Defendants must demonstrate that Plaintiff’s claims arise from
one of four categories of protected activity. An “ ‘act in furtherance of a
person’s right of petition or free speech under the United States or California
Constitution in connection with a public issue’ includes: (1) any written or
oral statement or writing made before a legislative, executive, or judicial
proceeding, or any other official proceeding authorized by law, (2) any written
or oral statement or writing made in connection with an issue under
consideration or review by a legislative, executive, or judicial body, or any
other official proceeding authorized by law, (3) any written or oral statement
or writing made in a place open to the public or a public forum in connection
with an issue of public interest, or (4) any other conduct in furtherance of
the exercise of the constitutional right of petition or the constitutional
right of free speech in connection with a public issue or an issue of public
interest.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 425.16,
subd. (e).)
 
“As our Supreme Court has
recognized, ‘the “arising from” requirement is not always easily met.’
[Citation.] ‘[T]he mere fact that an action was filed after protected activity
took place does not mean the action arose from that activity for the purposes of
the anti-SLAPP statute. [Citation.] Moreover, that a cause of action arguably
may have been “triggered” by protected activity does not entail that it is one
arising from such.’ [Citation.] ‘A claim arises from protected activity when
that activity underlies or forms the basis for the claim. [Citations.]  Critically, “the defendant’s act underlying
the plaintiff’s cause of action must itself have been an act in furtherance of
the right of petition or free speech.” [Citations.]’ [Citation.] ‘[I]n ruling
on an anti-SLAPP motion, courts should consider the elements of the challenged
claim and what actions by the defendant supply those elements and consequently
form the basis for liability.’ [Citation.] Put another way, courts should first
identify ‘the allegedly wrongful and injury-producing conduct that provides the
foundation for the claims,’ and then determine whether that conduct itself
constitutes protected activity. [Citations.]” (Callanan v. Grizzly Designs,
LLC (2022) 81 Cal.App.5th 517, 526 (Callanan) [citing Park v.
Board of Trustees of California State University (2017) 2 Cal.5th 1057,
1062-1063].) 
 
            In their
moving papers, Defendants argue that both
of Plaintiff’s claims arise from protected activity under Code of Civil Procedure
section 425.16 because the allegations arise from statements made by Defendants
in connection with a judicial proceeding. 
 
            The
Complaint’s allegations are convoluted. Despite their near unintelligibility,
the allegations are sufficiently clear for the Court to find that Plaintiff’s defamation
claims are based on Defendants seeking a restraining order in the San
Bernardino Superior Court, case number CIVSB2320392, in an effort to stop
“inappropriate text messages” that Defendants claim Plaintiff was sending.
(Compl., ¶¶ 24, 36.) The Complaint further alleges that Defendants’ accusations
were false and caused damage to Plaintiff. 
 
            As pertinent here, an analysis of whether a cause of action arises from
statements or writings “made in connection with an issue
under consideration or review by a ... judicial body” under Code of
Civil Procedure section 425.16, subd. (e)(2) may
“be broken down into three components: (a) was there an ‘issue under
consideration or review by a ... judicial body’; (b) were [Defendant’s]
statements [or writings] made ‘in connection with’ this issue; and (c) did the
cause of action pleaded by [Plaintiff] ‘aris[e] from’ [Defendant’s] statements
[or writings]?” (City of Costa Mesa v. D'Alessio Investments, LLC (2013)
214 Cal.App.4th 358, 372-373.) A statement or writing is “in
connection with” litigation if it “relates to the substantive issues in the
litigation and is directed to persons having some interest in the litigation.”
(Seltzer v. Barnes (2010) 182 Cal.App.4th 953,
962; Neville v. Chudacoff (2008) 160 Cal.App.4th 1255.)  
 
            Here,
the alleged defamatory statements were made for the purposes of litigation as
they were specifically made to the court to obtain a restraining order and,
thus, clearly satisfy Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16, subdivision (e)(2). 
 
Statements
made to Lyft reporting the allegedly improper conduct also constitutes
protected activity. That is, courts have routinely held that “communications in
connection with anticipated litigation are considered to be ‘under
consideration or review by a ... judicial body’ ” under section 425.16,
subdivision (e)(2). (Neville v. Chudacoff (2008) 160 Cal.App.4th
1255, 1263; see also Dove Audio, Inc. v. Rosenfeld, Meyer & Susman (1996)
47 Cal.App.4th 777, 784 [prelitigation letter covered as communication
“preparatory to or in anticipation of the bringing of an action or other
official proceeding”]; Gallanis–Politis v. Medina (2007) 152
Cal.App.4th 600, 612 [protecting investigation and report prepared by employee at request of counsel]; Briggs v. Eden
Council for Hope & Opportunity (1999) 19 Cal.4th 1106, 1115; Salma
v. Capon (2008) 161 Cal.App.4th 1275, 1285.) 
 
For
example, in Neville v. Chudacoff (2008) 160 Cal.App.4th 1255, defendant
employer sued its former employee for misappropriating customer lists and
starting a competing business. (Neville, supra, 160 Cal.App.4th at
p. 1259.) Four months before the litigation commenced, an attorney for
the employer sent a letter to its customers accusing
the employee of misconduct.
(Ibid.) The employee sued the employer and the attorney for defamation. (Ibid.) The Court of Appeal affirmed
the grant of the attorney’s anti-SLAPP motion, holding that the statute
protects statements made “in connection with” litigation where the statement
“relates to the substantive issues in the litigation and is directed to persons
having some interest in the litigation.” (Id. at p. 1266.) “ ‘[C]ourts have adopted “a fairly expansive view of what constitutes
litigation-related activities within the scope of section 425.16” [Citation.]’
” The court concluded that the statement was made “in anticipation of
litigation ‘contemplated in good faith and under serious consideration’ ” and
was therefore protected. (Id. at p. 1268.)


Courts regularly apply the anti-SLAPP statute to protect non-attorney
conduct as well. (See, e.g., Contemporary Services Corp. v. Staff Pro Inc.
(2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 1043 [email sent by company president to clients
regarding litigation with competitor]; Coretronic Corp. v. Cozen O'Connor
(2011) 192 Cal.App.4th 1381, 1388 [anti-SLAPP statute protects both litigants
and “their attorneys’ litigation-related statements”]; Gallanis–Politis v.
Medina, supra, 152 Cal.App.4th at p. 612.)


Thus, all
the allegations in the Complaint arise from Defendants’ protected conduct.] 
 
Accordingly, Defendants have met their
burden of showing that Plaintiff’s claims arise from protected activity. Thus,
the first prong of Section 425.16 has been satisfied. 
 
II.           
Demonstrating Minimal Merit 
 
As noted, in the second step, Plaintiff must show a
reasonable probability of success on the merits.  In this second component of the analysis,
courts employ a “summary-judgment-like” procedure, “accepting as true the
evidence favorable to the plaintiff and evaluating the defendant’s evidence
only to determine whether the defendant has defeated the plaintiff’s evidence
as a matter of law.” (Gerbosi v. Gaims,
Weil, West & Epstein, LLP (2011) 193 Cal.App.4th 435, 444.) The Court
does not assess credibility, and the plaintiff is not required to meet the
preponderance of the evidence standard. The Court accepts as true the evidence
favorable to the plaintiff, who need only establish that his or her claim has
“minimal merit” to avoid being stricken as a SLAPP. (Soukup, supra, 39 Cal.4th at p. 291.) Plaintiff must demonstrate
that the complaint is both “ ‘legally sufficient and supported by a sufficient
prima facie showing of facts to sustain a favorable judgment if the evidence
submitted by the plaintiff is credited.’ ” (Ibid.)
 
Here, the Court must determine whether Plaintiff has met his
burden of demonstrating minimal merit for the defamation causes of action. “Defamation
is the intentional publication of a statement of fact that is false,
unprivileged, and has a natural tendency to injure or that causes special
damage.” (Grenier v. Taylor (2015) 234 Cal.App.4th 471, 486.)
 
In arguing that Plaintiff’s claims have no merit, Defendants
contend that all the claims are barred by the litigation privilege. 
 
“Civil Code section 47, subdivision (b) defines what
is commonly known as the ‘litigation privilege.’ ” (Kashian v. Harriman
(2002) 98 Cal.App.4th 892, 912.) The privilege typically “applies to any
communication (1) made in judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings; (2) by
litigants or other participants authorized by law; (3) to achieve the objects of the litigation; and (4) that
have some connection or logical relation to the action.” (Silberg v.
Anderson (1990) 50 Cal.3d 205, 212.) “Thus, ‘communications with “some
relation” to judicial proceedings’ are ‘absolutely immune from tort liability’
by the litigation privilege.” (Rusheen v. Cohen (2006) 37 Cal.4th 1048,
1057.) 
 
“Many cases have explained that [Civil Code] section
47(b) encompasses not only testimony in court and statements made in pleadings,
but also statements made prior to the filing of a lawsuit, whether in
preparation for anticipated litigation or to investigate the feasibility of
filing a lawsuit.” (Hagberg v. California Federal Bank (2004) 32 Cal.4th
350, 361; see Briggs v. Eden Council for Hope & Opportunity (1999)
19 Cal.4th 1106, 1115 [“ ‘communications preparatory to or in anticipation of
the bringing of an action ... are within the litigation privilege’ ”].) 
 
The privilege presents “a substantive defense a
plaintiff . . . must overcome to demonstrate a probability of prevailing.” (Flatley
v. Mauro (2006) 39 Cal.4th 299, 323.)
 
Here, the allegations in the Complaint were made
during the judicial proceeding itself. The allegations regarding reporting the
alleged misconduct to Lyft – Plaintiff’s employer -- occurred days before the
filing of the request for a restraining order. (5/24/24 Opp., Exs. [Request for
Civil Harassment Restraining Orders filed on August 28, 2023], [Lyft Email on
August 19, 2023, notifying Plaintiff that Lyft was investigating a complaint
against brought against Plaintiff].) 
 
Moreover, “communications made in connection with
litigation do not necessarily fall outside the privilege simply because they
are, or are alleged to be, fraudulent, perjurious, unethical, or even illegal.”
(Kashian v. Harriman (2002) 98 Cal.App.4th 892, 920.) Thus, to the
extent that Plaintiff argues that Defendants knew the text messages did not
originate from Plaintiff, Defendants’ statements are still protected by the
privilege. 
 
            Plaintiff
does not address the litigation privilege argument. Thus, Plaintiff fails to
meet his burden of showing minimal merit with respect to the defamation claims.
Accordingly, Plaintiff has failed to make a bare minimum prima facie showing
for his claims and, therefore, has not met his burden on the second prong. 
 
Conclusion
 
The special motion to
strike pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16 is granted.  Plaintiff’s motion for leave to amend the Complaint
is taken off calendar. Plaintiff may not frustrate the hearing of the
anti-SLAPP motion by amending the complaint. (Simmons v. Allstate Ins. Co.
(2001) 92 Cal.App.4th 1068, 1073.)  Defendants are entitled to reasonable
attorneys’ fees and costs and may file a separately noticed motion seeking
fees.
