later motion it is determined that Plaintiff is qualified and must comply with
Corporations Code section 2105, then “[o]rdinarily, the matter should be stayed
to permit the foreign corporation to comply. If the foreign corporation
plaintiff complies with section 2203, subdivision (c), by qualifying and paying
fees, penalties and taxes, it may maintain the action. If the foreign
corporation fails to comply, the matter should be dismissed without prejudice.
A plaintiff whose action is dismissed on procedural grounds, such as
noncompliance with statutory requirements, is not precluded by the doctrine of
res judicata from bringing a second action, subject to the applicable statute
of limitations, after compliance with the statute.” (United Medical
Management Ltd. v. Gatto (1996) 49 Cal.App.4th 1732, 1740.) 


[2]           Plaintiff also
argues that this evidence is not properly considered on demurrer. (Opp.,

a demurrer. 
 


[3]           Of course, this ruling is
not intended to definitively decide this issue, but merely to determine that at
