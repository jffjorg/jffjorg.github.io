And here is the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

**Tentative Ruling**

This court GRANTS the Motion to Compel Deposition Attendance and Testimony. The court also awards monetary sanctions against Defendant in the amount of $2,846.26.

**Background**

Plaintiff leased a Cadillac Escalade from Casa de Cadillac in 2021. Defendant failed to appear for deposition notices in 2023. Plaintiff filed a motion to compel deposition attendance and testimony in 2024. Defendant filed an opposition to the motion in 2024.

**Legal Standard**

California Code of Civil Procedure sections 2025.230 and 2025.450 govern deposition notices and the compulsion of deposition attendance and testimony. The court must consider the reasonableness of the requested discovery and the potential relevance of the requested information.

**Discussion**

Plaintiff's motion to compel deposition attendance and testimony is granted. Defendant's objections to the deposition notices are untimely and have been waived under California Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.410, subdivision (a). Plaintiff has set forth specific facts showing good cause justifying the production of documents requested in the August 11 deposition notices.

**Sanctions**

The court awards monetary sanctions against Defendant in the amount of $2,846.26, which represents the reasonable expenses incurred by Plaintiff in preparing and filing the motion to compel.

**Order**

This tentative ruling is subject to change after considering any written objections or further briefing. The court will issue a final ruling after considering any written objections or further briefing.
