**Tentative Ruling**

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendants' motions in limine. The defendants moved to exclude various types of evidence, including compliance with OSHA labeling regulations, working conditions at their facilities, references to their products as "asbestos-containing", and certain words and phrases.

The Judge denied most of the motions, finding that they were too vague or that the evidence could be relevant. However, the Judge granted two motions, one to exclude a document published by the Joint Policy Committee of the Societies of Epidemiology, and another to exclude references to foreign bans on the importation of chrysotile asbestos.

The Judge also denied motions to bifurcate punitive damages and to require all evidence to be disclosed 72 hours in advance, finding that these motions were not proper motions in limine.

Overall, the Judge's ruling allows most of the evidence to be admitted at trial, while denying certain motions to exclude evidence that is deemed too vague or irrelevant.
