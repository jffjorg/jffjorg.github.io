BACKGROUND
            On August 23, 2023, Plaintiffs Hasan
Sachdev (“Sachdev”) and Prerna Chawla (“Chawla”) filed an action against
Defendants Masahiro Shimada (“Shimada”), Makoto Kabasawa (“Kabasawa”), The
Oneplusone Family, Inc. (“Oneplusone”), and Does 1 through 20 for (1) nuisance,
(2) public nuisance, and (3) negligence. 
Plaintiffs filed a First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) on October 19,
2023.  Plaintiffs alleges that
Defendants’ abandonment and neglect of the neighboring property, which
Defendants own, has created a nuisance due to the prevalence of trespassers and
squatters and several incidents of fires on the property.  As a result, Plaintiffs’ property and the
surrounding community have been adversely impacted.
            On April 10, 2024, default was
entered against Defendants Shimada, Kabasawa, and Oneplusone.
            On September 18, 2024, the Court
denied Plaintiffs’ Default Judgment Application without prejudice.  On September 30, 2024, Plaintiffs filed the
instant Default Judgment Application. 
DISCUSSION
            Code of Civil Procedure section 585
permits a default judgment after a defendant’s default has been entered.  California Rules of Court, rule 3.1800(a)
requires a party seeking default judgment by court judgment to use the
mandatory Request for Entry of Default (Application to Enter Default) (form
CIV-100) and to file: “(1) Except in unlawful detainer cases, a brief summary of the case
identifying the parties and the nature of plaintiff's claim; (2) Declarations
or other admissible evidence in support of the judgment requested; (3) Interest
computations as necessary; (4) A memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) A
declaration of nonmilitary status for each defendant against whom judgment is
sought; (6) A proposed form of judgment; (7) A dismissal of all parties against
whom judgment is not sought or an application for separate judgment against
specified parties under Code of Civil Procedure section 579, supported by a
showing of grounds for each judgment; (8) Exhibits as necessary; and (9) A
request for attorney fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the
parties.”
            On September 18, 2024, the Court denied Plaintiffs’
Default Judgment Application as Plaintiffs requested $323,927.27 in economic
damages and $647,927.54 in noneconomic damages, which surpassed the amount
requested in the FAC.  The Court
instructed Plaintiffs to either accept the $448,554.27 in damages, as presented
in the FAC, or to amend the FAC.
            On September 30, 2024, Plaintiffs filed the instant
Default Judgment Application.  Plaintiffs request a total judgment
of $452,331.33, consisting of the demand of the FAC in the amount of $448.554.27
and costs of $3,777.06.  Plaintiffs used
mandatory form CIV-100 (which includes a memorandum of costs and disbursements
(¶7) and declaration of nonmilitary status (¶8)) and complied with the
requirements of CRC, rule 3.1800(a) (see Summary of Case,
Exhibit List, Sachdev Declaration, Request for Dismissal of Does 1 through 20 (entered
on October 10, 2024).)  Plaintiffs also
submitted a proposed judgment on Form JUD-100.
            The Court finds that Plaintiffs have
complied with all requirements for the Application.  Thus, Plaintiffs’ Request for
Default Judgment is GRANTED.
CONCLUSION
Plaintiffs Hasan Sachdev and Prerna
Chawla’s Request for Default Judgment is GRANTED in the amount of $452,331.33.
Plaintiffs to give notice.
