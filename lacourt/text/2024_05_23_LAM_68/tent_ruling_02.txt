SUMMARY
OF ACTION
In
June 2016, Plaintiffs Ilanit Shavalian and Ilan Shavalian, and Defendants Kourosh
Shavalian, Ramin Kohanim, and Sami Kohanim entered into a joint venture for the
development of “five small lot residences” in Highland Park, Los Angeles. The
parties “formed” Defendant Prime LA Ventures LLC for purposes of conducting the
demolition and development. Each member contributed $30,000. 
 
On
June 23, 2026, Plaintiff Parvis Shavalian loaned Prime LA Ventures LLC $200,000
pursuant to a 48 month promissory note. On June 29, 2016, Prime LA Ventures LLC
purchased the subject property for $628,000 using the $200,000 plus a separate
$425,000 “private lender” loan. On April 9, 2018, Parvis loaned an additional
$100,000 to Prime LA Ventures LLC.
 
In
2020, the Shavalian parties “discovered” two additional loans for $475,000 were
taken out on the property without their knowledge or consent. The Kohanims
purportedly admitted to taking out said loans, and “diverted the funds” to
other “unrelated” projects. Following the admission, the Kohanims agreed to
“take responsibility” for the two loans. The loans were never repaid. 
 
The
developed property sold, but the loan dispute remained outstanding. On January
7, 2022, all parties agreed that the Kohanims would “surrender any interest in
Prime LA Ventures, LLC” held, and the Kohanims would pay an additional $400,000
within six months of the execution of the agreement by December 21, 2022. No
payment was made. 
 
On
January 12, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a complaint for 1. Fraud; 2. Unjust
Enrichment; 3. Breach of Fiduciary Duty—Individual Claims; 4. Breach of
Fiduciary Duty—Derivative Claims; 5. Breach of Promissory Note; 6. Breach of
Contract–Settlement Agreement; 7. Intentional Interference with Contractual
Relations; and 8. Financial Elder Abuse. On March 27, 2023, the clerk entered a
default against Prime LA Ventures, LLC. On March 21, 2023, Sami Kohanim
answered the complaint.
 
On
September 18, 2023, the court granted Plaintiffs leave to file a first amended
complaint. On September 26, 2023, Plaintiffs filed their first amended
complaint for 1. Fraud; 2. Unjust Enrichment; 3. Breach of Fiduciary Duty—Individual
Claims; 4. Breach of Fiduciary Duty—Derivative Claims; 5. Breach of Promissory
Note; 6. Breach of Contract – Settlement Agreement; 7. Intentional Interference
with Contractual Relations; 8. Financial Elder Abuse; 9. Professional
Negligence; and10. Breach Of Fiduciary Duty—Real Estate Broker. On October 23,
2023, Sami Kohanim answered the first amended complaint. On February 23, 2024,
the clerk entered a default against Ramin Kohanim.

Evidentiary
Objections to the Declaration of Ilanit
Shavalian:
Overruled/Not Relied Upon in Support of the Motion
 
Evidentiary Objections to the Declaration of Vadim
Frish: Overruled (Code Civ. Proc., § 36.5)
 
Plaintiff
Parvis Shavalian moves for trial preference on grounds that plaintiff is 79
years old, with an untreatable brain tumor. Defendant Sami Kohanim in
opposition challenges the lack of any evidentiary showing of a deteriorating
condition and impacts to trial from the brain tumor. Defendant also challenges
the right of the other parties to seek preference given only Parvis moves for
preference. Defendants finally contend significant prejudice as a result of any
preference. The court electronic filing system shows no reply prior to the time
of the tentative ruling publication cutoff.
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 36 subdivision (a)
states in relevant part: “A party to a civil action who is over 70
years of age may petition the court for a preference, which the court shall
grant if the court makes both of the following findings: (1) The party has
a substantial interest in the action as a whole. (2) The health of the
party is such that a preference is necessary to prevent prejudicing the party’s
interest in the litigation.”
 
Parvis
and Ilanit Shavalian submit declarations representing the existence of the
brain tumor though the imaging referral slip attached to the declaration, which
only seems to order a brain scan with possible “DSA for super sagittal sinus
thrombosis.” The motion otherwise lacks any
declaration of support from any treating physician, and the parties admittedly remain
unsure about life expectancy notwithstanding the implied terminal prognosis.
The court however can accept the showing of counsel for purposes of
establishing age and medical condition impacting the trial. [Declaration of Vadim
Frish.] (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 36, subd. (a), (c)(1), (e), 36.5.) Attorney Frish
represents the declining capacity of Parvis “related to memory loss and
difficulties communicating” as a result of the brain tumor. The court finds the
declaration sufficient for establishing a prejudicial impact to Parvis, thereby
entitling Parvis to preference.
 
The court however agrees that Plaintiffs lack any
address of trial preference relative to their own case. Parvis was only a
lender of funds, though the first amended complaint identified Parvis as a
party to all causes of action except for the Breach of Fiduciary Duty – Real
Estate Broker, with Parvis exclusively identified in the intentional inference
with contractual relations and financial elder abuse claims. 
 
 
The challenge however also lacks any legal support
regarding the right to advance all intertwined claims, and simply relies on
previously unchallenged distinctions of the parties’ claims. The court declines
to consider any substantive challenges to the complaint.
 
The court also shows no material prejudice. The current trial date was continued
from July 12, 2024 to October 28, 2024. A 120-day setting window from the
hearing date is Friday September 20, 2024. Given the court sets its trials for
Mondays, the starting date of September 16, 2024, would comply with both the
setting window and court policy. The date may be advanced for a further 15-day
window (plus four additional days) continuance, if necessary, thereby leading
to a trial date as late as September 30, 2024. Given the default against Rami,
and the appearance of all other defendants, the court finds no material
prejudice from advancing the trial by four (4) total weeks based on the
necessity of conducting discovery amongst the parties. 
 
The motion is therefore granted. “Upon the granting of such a motion for preference, the court
shall set the matter for trial not more than 120 days from that date and there
shall be no continuance beyond 120 days from the granting of the motion for
preference except for physical disability of a party or a party’s attorney, or
upon a showing of good cause stated in the record. Any continuance shall be for
no more than 15 days and no more than one continuance for physical disability
may be granted to any party.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 36, subd. (f).) 
 
The court notes Defendants’ right to a motion for summary
judgment, if sought, but cannot shorten the 75-day filing deadline. (See Polibrid Coatings, Inc. v. Superior Court (2003) 112
Cal.App.4th 920, 923; Mediterranean Const. Co. v. State Farm Fire & Cas. Co. (1998)
66 Cal.App.4th 257, 262.) 
 
The court orders the parties to cooperate in the expedited setting
of the depositions of witnesses, experts and parties. Depositions can occur via
video or telephonic means, due to distance, Covid or other health concerns
and/or in the interests of efficiently expediting discovery should the
individual plaintiff or witness(es) require accommodation, as well. The court
also advises the parties that any extensive discovery disputes may be referred
to a referee via expedited schedule. 
 
Plaintiff to give notice.
