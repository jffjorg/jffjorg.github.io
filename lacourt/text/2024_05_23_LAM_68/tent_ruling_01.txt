SUMMARY
OF ACTION 
Plaintiff
Law Offices of L.A. Law Inc. alleges Defendant Shahrzad Shahili failed to pay
for outstanding legal services rendered in association with a marital
dissolution. Plaintiff alleges an outstanding balance of $32,555.57. 
 
On
July 21, 2022, Plaintiff filed a complaint for Breach of Contract, Quantum
Meruit for Services Rendered, Account Stated, Book Account, and Fraud.
Defendant answered the complaint on October 17, 2022, and filed a
cross-complaint against F. Bari Nejadpour, Susan Winchester, and Law Offices of
L.A. Law, Inc. on October 18, 2022, for Professional Negligence Legal
Malpractice, Breach of Fiduciary Duty, Fraud and Deceit, Breach of Contract,
Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress, and Negligent Infliction of
Emotional Distress. 
 
On
December 15, 2022, the court denied the motion to
strike the one day after the answer filed cross-complaint. On January 30, 2023,
the court sustained the demurrer to the cross-complaint with leave to amend. A
first amended cross-complaint for Professional
Negligence Legal Malpractice, Breach of Fiduciary Duty, Fraud and Deceit, Breach
of Contract, Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress, and Negligent
Infliction of Emotional Distress, was filed on February 27, 2023. 
 
On April 20, 2023,
the court struck the demurrer to the first amended cross-complaint. On May 30,
2023, the court sustained the demurrer to the first amended cross-complaint.
 
On June 20, 2023,
the second amended cross-complaint for Professional
Negligence Legal Malpractice, Breach of Fiduciary Duty, Fraud and Deceit, Breach
of Contract, and Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress was filed. On
September 21, 2023, the court overruled the demurrer to the third and fourth
causes of action, and sustained the demurrer to the second amended cross-complaint
for the first, second and fifth causes of action. 
 
On November 20,
2023, the third amended cross-complaint for Professional
Negligence Legal Malpractice, Breach of Fiduciary Duty, Fraud and Deceit, and Breach
of Contract, was filed. On January 16, 2024, the court sustained the demurrer
to the Professional Negligence Legal
Malpractice, Breach of Fiduciary Duty, and Breach of Contract, causes of action
without leave to amend, and overruled the demurrer to the fourth cause of
action for fraud and deceit. Cross-Defendants answered the third amended
cross-complaint on February 15, 2024. 
 
RULING:
Granted as to Issue Sanctions Only.
Evidentiary
Objections to the Supplemental Declaration of William Silverstein: Sustained.
·        
The corrected
declaration was filed and served less than 16 court days from the date of the
hearing, and will not be considered by the court.
 
Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant,
Law Offices of L.A. Law Inc. (LA Law) presents a motion for issue and $1,000 in monetary sanctions against
Defendant/Cross-Complainant, Shahrzad Shahili. Counsel for Shahili only submits
a one day late declaration in opposition attesting to health problems. The
declaration contains a declaration from a treating physician as well. On the
merits, counsel represents a failure of moving party to produce certain
documents, and the lack of clarity on the sanctions request itself. The court
electronic filing system shows no reply on file at the time of the tentative
ruling publication cutoff. Plaintiff in reply reiterates the lack of sufficient
responses, or opposition justifying said conduct. Plaintiff also dedicates
significant argument rebuffing claims of English language comprehension as a
form of justification for the course of the subject discovery dispute.
 
LA
Law presents the motion due to the failure of Shahili to fully comply with the
order for production of documents at deposition, specifically insufficiently
produced employment or school records. LA Law concedes to the production of a
document either constituting or referencing completion of a program with West
Coast Ultrasound Institute, and a November 19, 2023, dated employment
verification letter. LA Law contends additional records exist and intentionally
withheld. 
 
“Discovery sanctions ‘should be
appropriate to the dereliction, and should not exceed that which is required to
protect the interests of the party entitled to but denied discovery.’” (Young
v. Rosenthal (1989) 212 Cal.App.3d 96, 118-119 citing Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978)
84 Cal.App.3d 771, 793; Newland v. Superior Court (1995) 40
Cal.App.4th 608, 613.) A prerequisite to the imposition of the dismissal
sanction is that the party has willfully failed to comply with a court order. (Mileikowsky v.
Tenet Healthsystem (2005)
128 Cal.App.4th 262, 279-280; Laguna Auto Body v. Farmers Ins. Exchange (1991)
231 Cal.App.3d 481, 487 overruled on other grounds in Garcia
v. McCutchen (1997) 16 Cal.4th 469, 478, fn. 4.); Young
v. Rosenthal (1989) 212 Cal.App.3d 96, 114.) 
 
Evidence or issue sanctions may be imposed
only after parties violated discovery orders compelling further responses,
except in exceptional circumstances, including where there was sufficiently
egregious misconduct regarding a failure to respond to discovery, or a prior
discovery order would be futile. (New Albertsons, Inc. v. Sup. Ct. (2008)
168 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1428.) “The discovery statutes thus ‘evince an incremental approach to
discovery sanctions, starting with monetary sanctions and ending with the ultimate sanction of termination.’ (Citation.) Although in extreme cases a court has the authority to order a
terminating sanction as a first measure (Citations), a terminating sanction
should generally not be imposed until the court has attempted less severe
alternatives and found them to be unsuccessful and/or the record clearly shows
lesser sanctions would be ineffective.” (Lopez v. Watchtower Bible & Tract Society of New York, Inc. (2016) 246 Cal.App.4th 566, 604.) To avoid
sanctions, the burden of proving that a discovery violation was not willful is
on the party on whom the discovery was served. (Cornwall v. Santa Monica
Dairy Co. (1977) 66 Cal.App.3d 250, 252- 253.)
 
The motion lacks a separate statement is
statutorily required under California Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(a)(7). The
court finds the missing statement in no way precludes or inhibits consideration
of the subject matter. The court therefore addresses the substance of the
requested relief.
 
On October 24, 2023, the court granted the
motion compelling production of documents “responsive” to the deposition
notice. [Declaration of William Silverstein, Ex. C.] The deposition notice
itself listed the following documents:
 
1.

all DOCUMENTS illustrating all payments made by Shahili to L.A. Law Inc. and/or

[Silverstein Decl., Ex. B.]
 
While on the fraud claim remains at issue in the complaint,
LA Law seeks said issue sanctions on the basis that “Defendants willfully
suppressed documents that could show that she had difficulties or issues with
English in her years of employment or her 2160 hours of instructions at the
West Coast Ultrasound Institute, located in Beverly Hills.” The court assumes
said argument applies to the damages claim, and therefore accepts the potential
material impact from the withheld information. 
 
The motion however lacks any statement of proposed
sanctions. “The court may impose an issue sanction
ordering that designated facts shall be taken as established in the action in
accordance with the claim of the party adversely affected by the misuse of the
discovery process. The court may also impose an issue sanction by an order
prohibiting any party engaging in the misuse of the discovery process from
supporting or opposing designated claims or defenses.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
2023.030, subd. (b).) The court finds the standard only requires notice of the
sought after sanction without specific articulation and every proposed
sanction. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.040.) Nevertheless, an order granting
sanctions still requires eventual identification, which presumably will come at
the time of the adjudication of the claims on the merits before a jury or a
bench trial currently set for September 23, 2024. (See Vallbona v. Springer (1996)
43 Cal.App.4th 1525, 1547.) 
 
The court therefore grants the motion on grounds of a
finding of a violation of the order, but in no way determines the scope of any
issue only sanction relative to the remaining claim for fraud. The scope of any
such order remains to be determined upon further clarification by Moving Party
at the time of adjudication.
 
The request for $1,000 in monetary sanctions is DENIED. A
court can impose additional monetary sanctions for the costs associated with a
valid motion. (Manlin v. Milner (2022) 82 Cal.App.5th 1004, 1025 [“For a trial court to
decline to award any amount of monetary sanctions when it finds discovery
misconduct has occurred is arbitrary and an abuse of discretion”].) 
 
Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant, a law firm, is a party to the
action and self represents itself in the instant motion. Counsel presents no
proof of actual payment or even identification of other outside counsel
referred, and otherwise fails to provide a separate breakout of costs. The
court therefore denies any recovery of sanctions as a form of recovery of legal
fees expended on the instant motion. (Trope v. Katz (1995) 11 Cal.4th
274, 292; Kravitz
v. Superior Court (2001) 91
Cal.App.4th 1015, 1020; Argaman v. Ratan (1999)
73 Cal.App.4th 1173, 1180.)
 
The court notes the prior oral
argument representation of employment with a separate law firm. The court again
notes the declaration of counsel continue to lack any statement under PENALTY
OF PERJURY attesting to this arrangement. The submitted invoice from
Silverstein in fact identifies “LA LAW INC” as the billing entity. [Silverstein
Decl., Ex. F.] 
 
Again, the court declines to
consider any corrected declaration, as both untimely filed and failing to
properly establish compliance at the time of the filing. (Code Civ. Proc.,
2023.040.) The court also declines to consider any potential counter oral
representation at the time of the hearing possibly arising from the executed
substitution of counsel filed on May 14, 2024. Sanctions remain DENIED. Notwithstanding,
the court can award costs, but the motion lacks any identified costs.
