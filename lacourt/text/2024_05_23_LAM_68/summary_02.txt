And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling is about a motion for trial preference filed by the plaintiff, Parvis Shavalian, who is 79 years old and has an untreatable brain tumor. The plaintiff seeks preference due to their age and medical condition, which the court grants. The court finds that the plaintiff is entitled to preference because their health is such that a preference is necessary to prevent prejudicing their interest in the litigation. The court also finds that the plaintiff lacks any address of trial preference relative to their own case, but notes that the plaintiff was only a lender of funds. The court sets the matter for trial not more than 120 days from the date of the granting of the motion for preference, and orders the parties to cooperate in the expedited setting of depositions.
