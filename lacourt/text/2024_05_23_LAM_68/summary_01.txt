```

And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the motion for issue sanctions, but denied the request for $1,000 in monetary sanctions. The court finds that the defendant failed to comply with discovery orders and withheld documents showing difficulties with English. The court notes that the plaintiff's motion lacks a separate statement, but finds that the missing statement does not preclude consideration of the subject matter. The court grants the motion for issue sanctions, but the scope of the sanction remains to be determined. The court also denies the request for monetary sanctions, as the plaintiff failed to provide proof of actual payment or identification of other outside counsel referred. The court notes that the defendant's counsel failed to provide a separate breakout of costs, and the court declines to consider the corrected declaration, as it was filed untimely.
