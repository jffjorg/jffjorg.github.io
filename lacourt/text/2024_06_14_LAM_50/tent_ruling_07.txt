  ORDER RE:
 
DEMURRER TO
  COMPLAINT; 
 
MOTION TO STRIKE
  COMPLAINT FOR UNLAWFUL DETAINER



 
Background
Plaintiffs Northland THEA LLC; Northland THEA Portfolio LLC; Northland
THEA Portfolio II LLC; Northland THEA Portfolio III LLC; and Northland THEA IV
LLC (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) filed this action on December 15, 2023 against
Defendants Ashley Wynn and Chelsea Wynn (jointly, “Defendants”). The Complaint
alleges one cause of action for breach of lease. 
Defendants appear to demur to the Complaint. Defendants also appear to
move to strike the Complaint.[1]
Plaintiffs oppose both. 
Demurrer 
A.    Legal Standard
A demurrer can be used
only to challenge defects that appear on the face of the pleading under attack
or from matters outside the pleading that are judicially noticeable. (Blank
v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311,
318.) “To survive a demurrer, the complaint
need only allege facts sufficient to state a cause of action; each evidentiary
fact that might eventually form part of the plaintiff’s proof need not be
alleged.” (C.A. v. William S. Hart Union
High School Dist. (2012) 53
Cal.4th 861, 872.) For the purpose of testing the
sufficiency of the cause of action, the demurrer admits the truth of all material facts properly pleaded. (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital Dist. (1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 966-967.) A demurrer “does not admit contentions, deductions or conclusions
of fact or law.” (Daar v. Yellow Cab Co. (1967) 67 Cal.2d 695, 713.) 
B.    Allegations of the
Complaint  
In the Complaint, Plaintiffs allege that they “own an apartment
complex located at 1000 W. 8th Street, Los Angeles, CA 90017 (‘Thea’).”
(Compl., ¶ 11.) “On or about August 27, 2021, Defendants Ashley Wynn and
Chelsea Wynn (together, ‘Defendants’), as tenants, and Plaintiffs’ predecessor
in interest, Greenland LA Metropolis Development III LLC, DBA ‘Thea at
Metropolis,’ as landlord, entered into a 13-month lease (the ‘Lease”) for Unit
1128 of Thea, more specifically described as 1000 W. 8th Street, Unit 1128, Los
Angeles, CA 90017 (the ‘Premises’).” (Compl., ¶ 12.) “When the Lease expired on
September 29, 2022, it converted to a month-to-month tenancy.” (Compl., ¶ 13.)
“Section 6 of the Lease provided that Defendants
would pay $3,934.00 per month for rent.” (Compl., ¶ 14.) 
“In or about May 2022, Defendants stopped paying rent, but continued
to occupy the Premises.” (Compl., ¶ 15.) “On or about June 15, 2023, Plaintiffs
served Defendants with a Three-Day Notice to Pay Rent or Quit for non-payment
of rent from April 2023 to June 2023.” (Compl., ¶ 16.) “On or about June 28,
2023, after Defendants did not pay rent or quit within the three-day notice
period, Plaintiffs brought an unlawful detainer action against Defendants
seeking, inter alia, forfeiture of the Lease, possession of the Premises, and
past-due rent due from April 2023, onward (the ‘Unlawful Detainer Action’).”
(Compl., ¶ 17.)
“On October 26, 2023, the Court in the Unlawful Detainer Action
entered judgment against Defendants and ordered that, inter alia, (i) the Lease
was forfeited, (ii) Defendants were to pay Plaintiffs past-due rent from April
2023 to June 2023 plus holdover damages, and (iii) Defendants were to return
the Premises to Plaintiffs.” (Compl., ¶ 18.) Plaintiffs allege that “[i]n
addition to the damages awarded to Plaintiffs in the Unlawful Detainer Action,
Defendants are liable for the full amount of Plaintiffs’ damages accrued
through March 2023, including at least $43,274.00 in past-due rent.” (Compl., ¶
19.) 
C.    Demurrer 
In the demurrer, Defendants argue that “[t]he Unlawful Detainer
Complaint filed by Plaintiff incorporates and alleges a three-day notice to pay
rent or quit which, although previously legal, is no longer valid, thus the
Complaint alleges and incorporates a facially defective three-day notice. This
is due to the fact that Code of Civil Procedure §
1161(2) now requires a three-day notice to pay or quit to have certain
payment information. That information is absent from the three-day notice
attached to the Complaint herein.” (Demurrer at p. 4:5-12.) 
As
an initial matter, as discussed, above, an “Unlawful Detainer Complaint” was
not filed in this action. Rather, the Complaint in this action alleges one
cause of action for breach of lease.
            Defendants also argue that “[t]he
three-day notice alleged in the Complaint overstates the amount of rent due,
thus it is fatally defective and will not support and Unlawful Detainer
action.” (Demurrer at p. 6:11-13.) In addition, Defendants argue that “[t]he
three-day notice alleged in the Complaint was served before the stated rent
amount became due, thus it is fatally defective and will not support an
Unlawful Detainer action.” (Demurrer at p. 6:18-20.) However, as discussed, the
instant case is not an unlawful detainer action. As noted by Plaintiffs, Defendants’
demurrer does not appear to address any of the allegations in the Complaint in
this case. 
In light of the foregoing, the Court does not find that Defendants
have demonstrated that Plaintiffs’ cause of action for breach of lease fails to
state facts sufficient to
constitute a cause of action. Thus, the Court overrules Plaintiffs’
demurrer.  
Motion to Strike 
A court may strike any “irrelevant,
false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading” or any part of
a pleading “not drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of this state, a
court rule, or an order of the court.” (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 436.) “The grounds for a motion to strike shall appear on the face of the
challenged pleading or from any matter of which the court is required to take
judicial notice.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 437.) 
In the motion to strike, Defendants state that they “move for an order
from the court striking the Complaint for Unlawful Detainer…in this action.”
(Mot. at pp. 1:26-2:1.) Defendants assert that “when Plaintiff’s counsel
verified the Complaint for Unlawful Detainer, he neglected to include the
affidavit mandated by Code of Civil Procedure § 446(a).”
(Mot. at p. 3:23-25.) 
As discussed, a “Complaint for Unlawful Detainer” was not filed in
this action. The Complaint in the instant action contains one cause of action
for breach of lease. Moreover, the Complaint in the instant action is not
verified. Thus, it is unclear what “Verification” Defendants are referring to
in the motion to strike. As noted by Plaintiffs, the motion does not address the
allegations of the Complaint in this case.
Thus, to the extent Defendants move to strike the Complaint in the
instant action, the Court does not find that Defendants have demonstrated
grounds to do so. Accordingly, the Court denies Defendants’ motion to strike. 
Conclusion
Based on the
foregoing, the Court overrules Defendants’ demurrer in its entirety. The Court
denies Defendants’ motion to strike.  
The Court orders
Defendants to file and serve their answer to the Complaint within 10 days of
the date of this order.¿¿

Plaintiffs are ordered to give notice of this Order.
