[TENTATIVE] ORDER RE:
MOTION TO BE RELIEVED AS COUNSEL 




AND RELATED CROSS-ACTION


 



 
Gloria P.
Martinez-Senftner of Martinez Law Group, PC (“Counsel”)
moves to be relieved as counsel for Defendant Vidala Aaronoff. 
Although Counsel has provided sufficient reason for
withdrawal, the Court notes a few defects with the motion.  
First, it does not appear
that any “Declaration in Support of Attorney’s Motion to Be Relieved as
Counsel—Civil” (Form MC-052) was filed in connection with the motion.
Pursuant to California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, subdivision (c), “[t]he motion to be relieved as counsel must be
accompanied by a declaration on the Declaration in Support of Attorney’s Motion to Be Relieved as
Counsel--Civil (form MC-052). The declaration must state in general terms
and without compromising the confidentiality of the attorney-client
relationship why a motion under Code of Civil
Procedure section 284(2) is brought instead of filing a consent under Code of Civil Procedure section 284(1).” 
Second, the proof of service of the
“Notice of Motion and Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel (Civil)” does not appear
to show that the notice of motion and motion were served on Counsel’s client.
Pursuant to California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, subdivision (d), “[t]he notice of motion and motion, the
declaration, and the proposed order must be served on the client and on all
other parties who have appeared in the case. The notice may be by personal
service, electronic service, or mail.” 
Third, Items 3 and 5 of the proposed
order (Form MC-053) are blank. 
Fourth, the proposed order does not
reference the upcoming hearings in this matter scheduled for June 17, 2024,
July 16, 2024, and October 9, 2024. Pursuant to California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, subdivision (e), “[t]he proposed order relieving
counsel…must specify all hearing dates scheduled in the action or proceeding,
including the date of trial, if known.” 
In light of the foregoing, the Court denies the motion
without prejudice. Counsel is ordered to give notice of this order.
