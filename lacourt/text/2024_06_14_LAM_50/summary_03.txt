Here is the English-text summary:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in this case, which includes a minute order from December 13, 2023. The court has sustained Runway's demurrer to the sixth and eighth causes of action in the complaint, which means that the motion to strike the request for punitive damages related to those causes of action is denied as moot. The court's ruling is based on California Civil Code section 3294, subdivision (b), which sets out the conditions under which an employer can be liable for damages caused by an employee's wrongful conduct. The code section states that an employer is only liable if the employer had advance knowledge of the employee's unfitness and employed the employee with a conscious disregard for the rights or safety of others, or authorized or ratified the employee's wrongful conduct. The ruling suggests that the court will not hold Runway liable for damages caused by the employee's wrongful conduct unless the court finds that Runway had advance knowledge of the employee's unfitness and employed the employee with a conscious disregard for the rights or safety of others, or authorized or ratified the employee's wrongful conduct.
