And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The judge is considering a motion to continue hearings scheduled in Department 69, but since the case was transferred to Department 50, the hearings were removed from the calendar. The plaintiff, Vincent Bowman, is requesting a continuance of the hearings scheduled for May 6, 2024, and April 16, 2024. The motion is unopposed. The judge notes that any discovery motions should not be filed until the parties have participated in an informal discovery conference (IDC) with the court. The IDC is a further form of meeting and conferring. The judge also denies the plaintiff's request for sanctions in the amount of $1,000.00 without identifying the party or parties against whom the sanctions are sought, and without citing any legal authority in support of the request.
