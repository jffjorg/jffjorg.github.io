And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge Teresa A. Beaudet of the Los Angeles Superior Court, denying a motion by Gloria P. Martinez-Senftner, counsel for defendant Vidala Aaronoff, to be relieved as counsel. The court notes several defects with the motion, including the lack of a required declaration in support of the attorney's motion, failure to serve the notice of motion and motion on the client and other parties, and incomplete proposed order. As a result, the court denies the motion without prejudice and orders counsel to give notice of this order.
