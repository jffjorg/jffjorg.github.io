And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The tentative ruling is a summary of the court's decision regarding the demurrer and motion to strike filed by the defendants. The court overrules the defendants' demurrer in its entirety, meaning that the plaintiffs' complaint alleging breach of lease is sufficient to state a cause of action. The court also denies the defendants' motion to strike the complaint, finding that the defendants have not demonstrated grounds to do so. The court orders the defendants to file and serve their answer to the complaint within 10 days of the date of the order.
