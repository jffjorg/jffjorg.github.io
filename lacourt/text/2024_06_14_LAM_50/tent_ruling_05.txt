[1]On
May 13, 2024, Defendant’s counsel filed a supplemental declaration stating, inter
alia, that “[o]n May 9, 2023 I
met telephonically with Plaintiff’s counsels Ariel Vento and Justin Hanassab to
meet and confer per the Court’s order. During this call I requested that
Plaintiff withdraw his plea for punitive damages against Defendant for the
reasons outlined in Defendant’s memorandum of points an authorities in support
of its Motion to Strike parts of Plaintiff’s Complaint. Plaintiff’s counsel
confirmed that they would not amend their complaint to remove the … plea for
punitive damages.” (Suppl. Chavez Decl., ¶ 2.) 
 
 


[2]The Court also
notes that Plaintiff’s amended opposition filed on May 30, 2024 does not appear
to address the Scott case. 


[3]Defendant argues
for the first time in the reply that “Plaintiff has not sufficiently alleged
any officer, director, or managing agent of Dongalen perpetrated, authorized or
ratified unlawful conduct.” (Reply at p. 5:8-9.) The Court notes that “¿[p]oints raised
for the first time in a reply brief will ordinarily not be considered,
because such consideration would deprive the respondent of an opportunity to
counter the argument.¿” (American Drug Stores, Inc. v. Stroh (1992) 10 Cal.App.4th 1446, 1453¿.) Thus, the
Court declines to consider the arguments raised for the first time in
Defendant’s reply.
