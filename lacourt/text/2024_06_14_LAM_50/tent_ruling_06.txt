[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER RE:  
 
MOTION TO
  CONTINUE HEARINGS CALENDARED IN DEPT 69 AND REMOVED WHEN CASE TRANSFERRED TO
  DEPT 50 




AND RELATED CROSS-ACTIONS


 



 
Plaintiff Vincent Bowman
(“Bowman”) filed a “Complaint for Breach of Contract” in this action on August
18, 2023 against Defendants Baldwin Hills Multifamily LLC and WinnResidential. 
On October 10, 2023, WinnResidential
California, L.P. erroneously sued and served as WinnResidential filed a
Cross-Complaint against Bowman,
alleging seven causes of action. 
On October 13, 2023, Baldwin
Hills Multifamily, LLC filed a Cross-Complaint against Bowman, alleging eight
causes of action. 
On April 10, 2024, the Court issued a minute order in this action
providing, inter alia, that “[t]he Court finds that the following cases,
22STCV06811 and 23STCV19802, are related within the meaning of California Rules
of Court, rule 3.300(a). 22STCV06811 is the lead case. For good cause shown,
said cases are assigned to Judge Teresa A. Beaudet in Department 50 at Stanley
Mosk Courthouse for all purposes. All hearings in cases other than the lead
case are advanced and taken off calendar. This order is made without prejudice
to the parties making a motion to consolidate in the newly assigned department.
The moving party is ordered to serve notice of this order (including hearings
vacated, if necessary) by mail forthwith on all interested parties within ten (10)
days of the receipt of this minute order. Trial Setting Conference is scheduled
for 05/17/24 at 10:00 AM in Department 50 at Stanley Mosk Courthouse…” 
Bowman now moves “for a
Continuance [sic] hearings scheduled in Dept. 69 but, because the case was
transferred to Dept[.] 50 was taken off the court’s calendar. The hearings are
as follows: Motions to Compel Responses to Discovery scheduled on May 6, 2024
at 9:30 am, and, Motion For Protective Order scheduled for April 16, 2024 at
9:30 am.” The motion is unopposed.
As indicated at the Case Management Conference in this case, any
discovery motions should not be filed until the parties have participated in an
informal discovery conference (“IDC”) with this Court. The IDC is a further
form of meeting and conferring. It appears that Plaintiff has reserved an IDC
on July 11, 2024. Most IDCs resolve the discovery issues; however, if the IDC
does not resolve the issues, the Court will then set a new date for the
discovery motions. 

Lastly, Bowman appears to request sanctions
in the amount of $1,000.00. The request is in the Declaration and not the notice.
Additionally, the party or parties against whom Bowman seeks sanctions do not
appear to be identified in the motion. Also, Bowman does not cite any legal
authority in support of his request for sanctions. Thus, the Court denies the
request.
Bowman is ordered to provide notice
of this ruling.
