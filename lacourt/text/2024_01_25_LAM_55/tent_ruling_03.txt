 Case Number:  22STCV38810    Hearing Date:   January 25, 2024    Dept:  55 NATURE OF PROCEEDINGS:
 Plaintiff’s Motion To Compel Further
Responses And Production Of Documents From Defendant NAI HIFFMAN Pursuant To
Plaintiff’s Requests For Production Of Documents, Set One; Request For Sanctions;
Plaintiff’s Motion To Compel Further Responses And Production Of Documents From
Defendant HIFFMAN NATIONAL OF CALIFORNIA, INC. Pursuant To Plaintiff’s Requests
For Production Of Documents, Set One; Request For Sanctions
 
Both motions are granted.
On or before 2/26/24, Defendant NAI HIFFMAN and
Defendant HIFFMAN NATIONAL OF CALIFORNIA, INC. shall serve further responses,
and produce documents, without objections, and in full compliance with the
California Discovery Act, CCP §2016.010 et seq., as to the requests for
documents served by Plaintiff KELLEY CLOUD.
On or before that same date, Defendant NAI HIFFMAN and
Defendant HIFFMAN NATIONAL OF CALIFORNIA, INC. shall each pay discovery
sanctions in the sum of $735 to Plaintiff KELLEY CLOUD, jointly and severally
with counsel Gordon Rees Scully Mansukahani, LLP, the Court finding the absence
of substantial justification.    E.g.,
CCP   § 2023.030. 
The opposing requests for monetary sanctions are
denied, the motions having been granted.
Defendants’ motion to compel arbitration is advanced
from 2/28/24 and continued to 3/28/24, to allow Plaintiff the opportunity to
include the ordered discovery responses in opposition to the arbitration
motion.
Background
In this case, Plaintiff KELLEY CLOUD (“Plaintiff”) seeks
damages based on allegations that defendants, including Defendants NAI HIFFMAN
and HIFFMAN NATIONAL OF CALIFORNIA, INC. (“Defendants”) discriminated and
harassed Plaintiff and wrongfully terminated Plaintiff’s employment, because of
Plaintiff’s cancer-related disability and/or medical condition.
Plaintiff has filed two motions to compel further
responses and production of documents against Defendants. The motions seek
further responses and production of documents for the twelve document requests
in Plaintiff’s Requests for Production of Documents, Set One (“Requests for
Production”), and monetary sanctions. Defendants oppose the motions and seek
sanctions against Plaintiff. 
Analysis
Plaintiff’s Requests for Production seek documents related
to the motion to compel arbitration filed by Defendants, including agreements between
Plaintiff and Defendants, Defendants’ acquisition of Plaintiff’s former
employer NAI Capital Management, Inc., and any arbitration agreements between Plaintiff
and NAI Capital Management. Plaintiff served the Requests for Production on
6/22/23 by email, and Defendants served objections only on 8/4/23. Plaintiff
contends Defendants’ responses are untimely and therefore they have waived
their objections. See CCP § 2031.300(a). While Defendants deny receiving
the Requests for Production, the emails attached to the declarations filed by
Plaintiff’s counsel support her argument that Defendants received them on
6/22/23, which would make the 8/4/23 responses untimely. See Rogal
Decl., Ex. 1; Suppl Rogal Decl., Ex. A.
Even assuming that Defendants’ responses were timely,
however, they are deficient. Defendants objected to each of the Requests for
Production on the grounds that the case is subject to private mediation
pursuant to a written arbitration agreement, and that Defendants have filed a
motion to compel arbitration. Defendants also cite to Adolf v Coastal Auto
Sales, Inc. (2010) 184 Cal. App. 4th 1443, 1451-52 and Augusta v. Keehn
& Assoc. (2011) 193, Cal. App. 4th 331, 339-40. Defendants did not
include code-compliant responses to the Requests for Production pursuant to CCP
§§ 2031.210(a), 2031.220, 2031.280.
A party opposing a motion to compel arbitration under
CCP § 1281.2 has “discovery rights under the Civil Discovery Act, subject to
the relevancy requirement and other provisions limiting the scope and timing of
that discovery.”  Bouton v. USAA
Casualty Ins. Co. (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 412, 427. Thus, the fact that
Defendants have filed a motion to compel arbitration does not constitute a
valid objection and refusal to respond to the Requests for Production with
code-complaint responses. Neither of the cases cited by Defendants in their objections
holds otherwise.
The burden to show good cause for production “is met
simply by a fact-specific showing of relevance.” Tbg Ins. Servs. Corp. v.
Sup. Ct. (2002) 96 Cal. App. 4th 443, 448. “[E]ven when no . . . supporting
affidavits are filed . . .good cause may be found in the pleadings theretofore
filed in the action."  Greyhound
Corp.  v. 
Sup.  Ct.  (1961) 56 Cal.2d 355, 389, superseded by statute on other grounds as
stated in  Dowden v. Sup. Ct.
(1999) 73 Cal. App. 4th 126, 132.
Here, the documents sought in the Requests for Production
are plainly relevant to the arbitration motion. Defendants’ motion to compel
arbitration, filed 6/28/23, seeks to enforce an arbitration agreement with
Plaintiff and it places in issue the enforceability of that agreement, and the
relationships between the defendants (e.g., Mot., 3:14-15  (“ ‘The Agreement defines “Client Company” as
Hiffman, and “Covered Persons” to include Hiffman, as well as its “officers,
directors, employees, affiliates or agents.” ’ ”)). The arbitration agreement
contains a provision stating that if Plaintiff has a separate agreement with “Client
Company” for arbitration, that agreement controls. (Assoian Decl., ISO Mot.,
Ex. A, Para. 6.) And the motion references the fact that Plaintiff used to work
for NAI Capital Management, Inc., which Defendant Hiffman acquired in 2021. (Mot.
at 2.) Document requests regarding the acquisition of NAI Capital Management and
any arbitration agreements NAI had with Plaintiff are relevant to Defendants’
motion.
Generally, monetary sanctions are mandatory as to
parties losing discovery motions, unless courts find substantial justification
or other injustice.  E.g.,  Foothill Properties v. Lyon/Copley
Corona Assocs., L.P. (1996) 46 Cal.App.4th 1542, 1557-58.  “‘[S]ubstantial justification” has been
understood to mean that a justification is clearly reasonable because it is
well-grounded in both law and fact.”  Doe
v. U.S. Swimming, Inc. (2011) 200 Cal.App.4th 1424, 1434.  “If the party seeking a monetary sanction
meets its burden of proof, the burden shifts to the opposing party attempting
to avoid a monetary sanction to show that it acted with ‘substantial
justification.’”  Doe v. U.S.
Swimming, Inc. (2011) 200 Cal.App.4th 1424, 1435. Defendants do not have
substantial justification for refusing to provide code-complaint responses and
insisting on serving objections only when they responded to the requests late. 
The Court therefore grants the motion and requests
sanctions against Defendants. Defendants’ request for sanctions is denied.
