And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling states that the motion to strike the answer in its entirety, or alternatively, portions of the answer to the complaint, is moot. This is because the defendants have complied with the law by filing a verified answer in response to the plaintiff's verified complaint. As a result, the court takes the motion off-calendar and the case will proceed with the verified answer filed by the defendants.
