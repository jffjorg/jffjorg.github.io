And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling on two motions: Plaintiff's Motion to Compel Further Responses and Production of Documents and Plaintiff's Request for Sanctions. The Court grants both motions and orders the defendants to serve further responses and produce documents without objections by February 26, 2024. The Court also orders the defendants to pay discovery sanctions in the amount of $735 to the Plaintiff, jointly and severally with counsel Gordon Rees Scully Mansukahani, LLP.

The Court's decision is based on the fact that the defendants' responses to the Plaintiff's requests for production of documents were untimely and incomplete. The Court finds that the defendants do not have substantial justification for refusing to provide code-compliant responses and insists on serving objections only when they responded to the requests late. The Court also finds that the documents sought in the requests for production are plainly relevant to the defendants' motion to compel arbitration.

The Court denies the defendants' request for sanctions and grants the Plaintiff's motion to compel further responses and production of documents. The Court's decision is effective as of the date of the ruling, and the parties are advised to comply with the orders within the specified timeframes.
