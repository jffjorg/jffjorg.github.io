And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling denies the Defendant's motion to stay proceedings pending the outcome of an administrative proceeding before the Los Angeles County Civil Service Commission. The Plaintiff alleges discrimination and retaliation by the County of Los Angeles, and the Defendant seeks to stay the action pending the outcome of the administrative proceeding. The Judge notes that the administrative proceeding is still pending and there is no clarity on when it will conclude, and therefore the Court seeks to avoid excessive delay in reaching a resolution of the Plaintiff's matters.
