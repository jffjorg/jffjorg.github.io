 Case Number:  23STCV04079    Hearing Date:   January 25, 2024    Dept:  55  
NATURE OF PROCEEDINGS:  Motion To Strike The Answer In Its Entirety,
Or Alternatively, Portions Of Answer To Complaint; Request For Entry  Of Default.
Plaintiff CRAIG ISMAEL’s verified Complaint seeks damages
against defendants for alleged uninhabitable conditions in his apartment. In
August 2023, Plaintiff filed a motion to strike the unverified Answer and enter
the defaults of defendants SBDTLA 1, LLC.; |SBDTLA 2, LLC.; SBDTLA 3, LLC.;
SBDTLA 4, LLC.; and GREYSTAR CALIFORNIA, INC. (“Defendants”). On 10/13/2023, Defendants
filed and served a verified Answer. Because Defendants have complied with the
law requiring a defendant to file a verified Answer in response to a verified
Complaint, the motion to strike is moot and the Court takes the motion
off-calendar.
