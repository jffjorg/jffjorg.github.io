And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The ruling denies the motion to set aside the default. The court initially inclined to grant the motion, but the opposition changed its mind. The court finds that the dismissal was not a mistake, but rather a deliberate decision by the plaintiffs to dismiss the case. The evidence presented suggests that the plaintiffs changed their minds and wanted to dismiss the case. The court concludes that the dismissal will stand, as the decision to dismiss the defendants was deliberate.
