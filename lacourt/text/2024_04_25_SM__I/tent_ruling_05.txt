 Case Number:  24SMCV00401    Hearing Date:   April 25, 2024    Dept:  I The court is inclined to GRANT the application and advance
the hearing.  The court will discuss
dates with the parties.  The court notes
that defendant scheduled the hearing in a manner not consistent with the Code
of Civil Procedure, which requires scheduling no more than 30 days from filing
unless the court’s calendar is such that it is not possible to do that.  The court is not sure, but believes that its
calendar allowed for hearings before the 60 days that defendant chose.
