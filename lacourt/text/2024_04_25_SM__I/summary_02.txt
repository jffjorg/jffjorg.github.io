And here is the English-text summary:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of 22STCV35303. The court has set the trial for May 20, 2024, but due to scheduling conflicts with other cases, the trial will likely be continued. The court has also extended the discovery cut-off by six weeks for discovery that was timely noticed and motions related to it. The motion to advance the discovery hearings is moot. The court notes that the defendant's failure to complete discovery until the last minute has put them at risk of having their motion denied.
