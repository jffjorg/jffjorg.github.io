```

And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

"The judge has tentatively denied Horne's motion to compel arbitration. The judge believes that the question of whether Horne's work and HCVT's work constituted the same transaction or series of transactions and whether there is a possibility of conflicting rulings on a common question of law or fact is a close one. However, the judge concludes that the law and facts tilt in NextHome's favor. The court finds that the risk of substantive prejudice outweighs the risk of procedural differences, and therefore the motion is denied."
