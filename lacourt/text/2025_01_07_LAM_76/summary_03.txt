Summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling:

The Judge has tentatively ruled that the City of Los Angeles' demurrer to the Plaintiff's entire complaint is sustained with leave to amend. The Plaintiff alleges that the City of Los Angeles is liable for emotional distress and other damages resulting from various issues, including parking tickets, potholes, and school shootings. The Judge finds that the Complaint does not set forth a statutory basis for liability against the City, and therefore the City's sovereign immunity bars the suit. The Judge gives the Plaintiff 30 days to amend the Complaint.
