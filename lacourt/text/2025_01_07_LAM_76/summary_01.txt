And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to enforce a settlement agreement between the plaintiff, Robyn Pearlman, and the settling defendants, Alex Nelson and 1st Point Lending. The defendant, UMRO Realty Corp., dba The Agency, is seeking to extend the settlement agreement to non-signatories, including April Lopez and UMRO Realty, Inc. The judge has ruled that the motion is a disguised Civil Procedure Code section 1008 motion and is therefore denied. The judge has also ruled that it no longer has the power to reconsider its prior ruling denying the motion to enforce the settlement agreement, as judgment was entered on July 9, 2024.
