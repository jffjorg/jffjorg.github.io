  Case Number:  19STCV09548    Hearing Date:   January 7, 2025    Dept:  76 Plaintiff
alleges that Defendants advised Plaintiff and her mother to represent that the
underlying loan was a commercial mortgage, even though it was a consumer credit
transaction, which rendered the Truth in Lending Act inapplicable to the loan. Defendants
allegedly knew Plaintiff did not qualify and could not afford the loan, which
was for 11 months of interest only payments with a final balloon payment of
$705,250.

TENTATIVE RULING

motion to enforce the settlement agreement, which is a disguised Civ. Proc.
Code, § 1008 motion, is DENIED.
 
ANALYSIS
 
Motion To Enforce Settlement
 
Defendant
UMRO Realty Corp., dba The Agency moves pursuant to CCP § 664.6 to enforce the
settlement agreement between Plaintiff Robyn Pearlman and the Settling
Defendants Alex Nelson and 1st Point Lending to extend to
non-signatories to the settlement agreement, Defendant April Lopez and UMRO
Realty, Inc.
 
Defendant
previously brought this motion, which the Court previously denied in its
October 20, 2022 order. As such, the instant motion is a motion for
reconsideration of that order or, alternatively, a renewed motion. Under Civ.
Proc. Code, § 1008(a) & (b), Defendant was required to set forth new or
different facts, circumstances, or law. Although Defendant does not acknowledge
§ 1008, arguably Defendant has identified new or different facts by virtue of the
Court’s determination that Lopez was acting as a mortgage originator with
regard to Plaintiff and also “that payment [from 1st Point Defendants] was
remuneration for Lopez’s placing and assisting in the completion of the loan.” (Statement
of Decision, dated 5/24/24, Page 13:9-14:10.)
 
However,
the Court no longer has power to reconsider its prior ruling denying the motion
to enforce the settlement because judgment was entered on July 9, 2024. Indeed,
Defendant did not even file the instant motion until September 25, 2024.
 
 Moreover, the court was correct that, once
it had entered judgment, it had no authority to rule on his motion.  “ ‘A court may reconsider its order granting
or denying a motion and may even reconsider or alter its judgment so long as
judgment has not yet been entered. Once judgment has been entered, however, the
court may not reconsider it and loses its unrestricted power to change the
judgment. …’ [Citation.]” (APRI Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (1999) 76
Cal.App.4th 176, 181 [90 Cal. Rptr. 2d 171].) Finally, Husband cites no
authority for the proposition that this court must reverse the judgment and
order the trial court to rule on his motion before again entering judgment. It
is Husband's burden, as appellant, to show reversible error. (Virtanen v.
O'Connell, supra, 140 Cal.App.4th at p. 710.) He has not done so.  


(G.R. v. Intelligator (2010) 185 Cal.App.4th
606, 622.)
 
As such,
the motion to enforce settlement, which is a disguised Civ. Proc. Code, § 1008
motion, is DENIED.
