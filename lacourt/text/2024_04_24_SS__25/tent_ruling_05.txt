BACKGROUND 
 
On
May 15, 2023, Respondent David Aragon dba Progressive Home Remodeling, Inc.
recorded a Mechanic’s Lien against Petitioners Joseph Lo Bue and Anthony Marciona’s real
property located at 3359 Larga Ave, Los Angeles for work performed on
Petitioners’ roof. 
 
On December 20, 2023, Petitioners filed
the instant Petition for Expungement of Mechanic’s Lien on the basis that Respondent
failed to show proper service to the owner and to show that the Mechanic’s Lien
was property addressed to the owners’ residence. Further, Respondent failed to
comply with the requirement of commencing an action to enforce the Mechanic’s
Lien within 90 days of recordation. 
 
Petitioners’ Order for Publication was
rejected on April 11, 2024. 
 
No opposition or reply papers have been
filed. 
 
 
ANALYSIS 
 
I.          Legal Standard
 
After a mechanic’s lien has been recorded, “[t]he owner of
property or the owner of any interest in property subject to a claim of lien
may petition the court for an order to release the property from the claim of
lien if the claimant has not commenced an action to enforce the lien within the
time provided in Section 8460.”¿ (Civ. Code, § 8480(a).)¿ A claimant must
commence an action to enforce a lien within 90 days of recording the lien,
otherwise, “the claim of lien expires and is unenforceable.”¿ (Civ. Code, §
8460(a).)¿ However, the 90-day time limit to commence an action to enforce a
lien does not apply if there was an agreement to extend credit and a notice of
that fact was recorded within 90 days after recordation of the claim of lien or
more than 90 days after recordation of the claim of lien but before a purchaser
or encumbrancer for value and in good faith acquires rights in the property.¿
(Civ. Code, § 8460(b).)¿ 
 
At least 10 days prior to
filing the petition to release the lien, the moving party must demand in
writing that the claimant execute and record a release of the lien and set
forth the grounds for that demand.  (Civ.
Code, § 8482 (see also § 8100).)  The
petition must be verified, attach a certified copy of the lien, and allege,
among other things, details regarding the subject property, and the lien’s
recording as specified in Civil Code § 8484. 
The petition and notice of hearing must be served at least 15 days
before the hearing and in the same manner as service of summons (or by
certified or registered mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested).  (Civ. Code., § 8486.)  The petitioner has the initial burden of
proof to show compliance with the service and hearing date requirements, and
the claimant has the burden of proof as to the validity of the lien.  (Civ. Code, § 8488.)  If the petitioner prevails, the court shall
order the property released from the lien. 
(Id.)  The prevailing party is entitled to recover reasonable
attorney fees.  (Id.) 
¿ 
II.        Discussion 
 
Here, Petitioners
have not met their initial burden of proof to show compliance with the service
and hearing date requirements. 
 
The Petition
provides that, on October 25, 2023, Petitioners sent Respondent a demand letter
by certified mail, pursuant to Civil Code § 8482, demanding that Respondent remove the Mechanic’s Lien, but
Respondent did not respond.  (Pet. ¶ 12.)  Petitioners then filed their Petition on December
20, 2023.  As such, it appears that Petitioners
have complied with the requirements of demanding a release of the Mechanic’s Lien
at least 10 days prior to filing their Petition.  However, no demand letter is provided by
Petitioners even though the Petition states it is attached as Exhibit C.  In fact, no exhibit is attached to the
Petition.  Consequently, Petitioners have
failed to attach a certified copy of the claim of lien pursuant to Civil
Code § 8484, which Petitioner
states is attached as Exhibit B. 
Moreover, it does not appear that the petition and notice of hearing were served at
least 15 days before the April 24, 2024, hearing and in the same manner as
service of summons pursuant to Civil
Code § 8486.  Finally, the Petition is
not verified.
 
II.        Conclusion 
 
Accordingly, the Petition to Expunge Mechanic’s Lien filed by
Petitioners Joseph Lo Bue and Anthony Marciona is DENIED. 
 
Moving party is ordered to give notice.
