[1] The
Court notes that counsel’s declaration only specifically references Defendant
Benbaroukh; however, Exhibit A attached to counsel’s declaration shows that a
deposition notice with a request for production of documents was also propounded
on Defendant Shokrian. Based on a review of the declarations in support of the
Motions, Plaintiff is using the same declaration in support of both motions.
