No reply has been filed as of April 19, 2024. 
 
 
ANALYSIS 
 
I.                  
Legal Standard
 
Regardless of the particular relief granted, any arbitrator's award is
enforceable only when confirmed as a judgment of the superior court.”¿ (O'Hare
v. Municipal Resource Consultants¿(2003) 107 Cal.App.4th 267, 278.)¿ “Once a petition to confirm an award is filed, the
superior court must select one of only four courses of action: it may confirm
the award, correct and confirm it, vacate it, or dismiss the petition.”¿ (EHM
Productions, Inc. v. Starline Tours of Hollywood, Inc.¿(2018) 21
Cal.App.5th 1058, 1063.)¿ “It is well settled that the scope of judicial review
of arbitration awards is extremely narrow.”¿ (California Faculty
Assn. v. Superior Court¿(1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 935, 943.)¿ “Neither the trial court, nor the appellate court, may
‘review the merits of the dispute, the sufficiency of the evidence, or the
arbitrator's reasoning, nor may we correct or review an award because of an
arbitrator's legal or factual error, even if it appears on the award's face.¿
Instead, we restrict our review to whether the award should be vacated under
the grounds listed in section 1286.2.¿ [Citations.]’”¿ (Id.)¿ 
¿ 
Code of
Civil Procedure section 1286.2, subdivision (a), states, in pertinent
part:¿¿ 
¿ 
Subject
to Section 1286.4, the court shall vacate the award if the court determines any
of the following:¿ 
¿ 
(1) The
award was procured by corruption, fraud or other undue means.¿ 
(2)
There was corruption in any of the arbitrators.¿ 
(3) The
rights of the party were substantially prejudiced by misconduct of a neutral
arbitrator.¿ 
(4) The
arbitrators exceeded their powers and the award cannot be corrected without
affecting the merits of the decision upon the controversy submitted.¿ 
(5) The
rights of the parties were substantially prejudiced by the refusal of the
arbitrators to postpone the hearing upon sufficient cause being shown therefor
or by the refusal of the arbitrators to hear evidence material to the
controversy or by other conduct of the arbitrators contrary to the provisions
of this title.¿ 
(6) An
arbitrator making the award¿ . . . (B) was subject to disqualification upon
grounds specified in Section 1281.91 but failed upon receipt of timely demand
to disqualify himself or herself as required by that provision. . . .¿ 
¿ 
(Code
Civ. Proc., § 1286.2, subd. (a).)¿ 
¿ 
Only
where both (1) the arbitrator abused his or her discretion and (2) there was
resulting prejudice, can a trial court properly vacate an arbitration award. (SWAB
Financial, LLC v. E*Trade Securities, LLC (2007) 150 Cal.App.4th 1181,
1198.)¿ 
 
 
II.        Discussion 
 
Petitioner
petitions this Court to vacate the award issued by Arbitrator Leslie Steven
Marks of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) on November 15, 2023.  Petitioner contends the award should be
vacated for two reasons.  First, Petitioner
contends that the Arbitrator exceeded her powers in denying Petitioner’s
request for oral argument.  Second, Petitioner
contends the award was procured through fraud or other undue means since the
matter consisted of more than 500 pages of documents submitted to the
Arbitrator. 
 
In
opposition, Respondents make numerous arguments including: (1) there is no
evidence that the award was procured through undue means or caused substantial
prejudice to Petitioner; (2) AAA rules provides disputes in cases such as this
matter shall be resolved by submission of documents; (3) the Arbitrator
followed the rules of the AAA; and (4) the total page count was 118 pages. 
 
Here,
Petitioner’s petition is without merit.  
 
Petitioner’s
first argument that the Arbitrator exceeded her powers in denying Petitioner’s
request for oral argument is meritless. The final award issued by the
Arbitrator on November 15 was administered under the AAA Fast Track Procedures
of the Construction Industry Arbitration Rules. 
(Declaration of David K. Dorenfeld; ¶ 11; Ex. “I.”)  Petitioner does not provide any evidence that
the Arbitrator exceeded her powers in accordance with the Rules of the AAA.  Further, by not filing a reply, Petitioner has
failed to address Respondent’s argument that the Rules of the AAA require cases
involving disputes of less than $25,000 to be resolved by submission of
documents and that the arbitrator shall decide whether a formal hearing, via
telephone or in person is necessary.  
 
Next,
Petitioner’s second argument that the award was procured through fraud or other
undue means since the matter consisted of more than 500 pages of documents
submitted to the Arbitrator is meritless. 
Petitioner submits the declaration of its attorney, David K. Dorenfeld,
to support the voluminous documentation argument, however, Dorenfeld’s
declaration does not actually demonstrate such because the attached email
exhibits merely contain a download link. Also, Petitioner does not address
Respondents’ argument that the total page count was actually 118 pages. 
 
 
II.        Conclusion 
 
Accordingly, the Petition to Vacate or Alter Arbitration
Award filed by Petitioner McCulloch Builders,
Inc. is DENIED.
 
Moving party is ordered to give notice.
