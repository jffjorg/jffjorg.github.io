BACKGROUND
            Some time prior to May 20, 2022,
Lester Arturo Solares (Plaintiff) searched online with the intent to find and
purchase a new vehicle. (Complaint, ¶ 13.) After browsing the webpage of UAG
Southbay, LLC dba Penske Cadillac Buick GMC of Southbay (Defendant), Plaintiff
found a new vehicle (the Subject Vehicle) on Defendant’s website advertised for
$78,680.00 (Id., at ¶ 15.) On May 20, 2022, Plaintiff visited
Defendant’s place of business with the intent to purchase the Subject Vehicle
for $78,680.00. (Id., at ¶ 16.) However, Plaintiff alleges that upon
arrival, Defendant’s representatives made several misrepresentations, including
the price of the Subject Vehicle, which was advertised for $78,680.00, but was
being sold at the dealership for a cash price of $86,180.00. (Id., at ¶
23.)
            Plaintiff alleges that the sale
price listed on Defendant’s website was misleading, and that the change in
price was false and deceptive conduct. (Id., at ¶ 27.) The Retail
Installment Sales Contract (RISC) showed that that the cash price was $7,500.00
more than the advertised price. Additionally, Plaintiff was charged for
optional products that totaled $3,085.00 (Id., at ¶ 29), this brough the
final price to $97,689.70. Plaintiff alleges that, had they known of the
misrepresentations they would have not purchased the vehicle. Plaintiff filed
suit on July 24, 2023.
            The Complaint alleges six causes of
action: 
1.      Fraud and Deceit
2.      Breach of Implied Covenant of Good
Faith and Fair Dealing
3.      Selling Automobile Above the
Advertised Price (Cal. Veh. Code § 11713.1(e))
4.      Violation of Business and
Professions Code § 17200, et seq.
5.      Violation of Business and
Professions Code § 17500, et seq.
6.      Violation of California Consumer
Legal Remedies Act
            
            Plaintiff alleges all six causes of
action against Roger Searle Penske Jr. and UAG Southbay, LLC dba Penske
Cadillac Buick GMC of Southbay (Defendant). The motion now before the Court is
Defendant’s Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings (the Motion). Plaintiff files
an opposition, and Defendant files a reply. 
            
DISCUSSION
Legal Standard
      “The
grounds for a motion for judgment on the pleadings must appear on the face of
the complaint or from a matter of which the court may take judicial notice.” (Richardson-Tunnell
v. School Ins. Program for Employees (2007) 157 Cal.App. 4th
1056, 1061, disapproved on other grounds by Quigley v. Garden Valley Fire
Prot. Dist. (2019) 7 Cal. 5th 798, 815 n.8. Accord  Bufil v. Dollar Financial Group, Inc. (2008) 162 Cal.App.4th
1193, 1202,  disapproved on other
grounds by Noel v. Thrifty Payless, Inc. (2019) 7 Cal. 5th 955, 986;
Saltarelli & Steponovich v. Douglas (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th
1, 5.) 
      A motion
for judgment on the pleadings involves the same type of procedures that apply
to a general demurrer. (Richardson-Tunnell v. School Ins. Program for
Employees (2007) 157 Cal.App. 4th 1056, 1061,  disapproved on other grounds by  Quigley v. Garden Valley Fire Prot. Dist.
(2019) 7 Cal. 5th 798, 815 n.8; Burnett v. Chimney Sweep (2004) 123 Cal.
App. 4th 1057, 1064.) In considering a motion for judgment on the pleadings,
courts consider whether properly pled factual allegations, assumed to be true
and liberally construed, are sufficient to constitute a cause of action. (Stone
Street Capital, LLC v. Cal. State Lottery Com'n (2008) 165 Cal.App.4th 109,
116; Fire Ins. Exchange v. Sup. Ct. (2004) 116 Cal. App. 4th 446,
452-53.) A motion for judgment on the pleadings does not lie as to only part
of a cause of action. (Fire Ins. Exch. v. Sup. Ct. (2004) 116
Cal.App.4th 446, 452.) “[A] motion for judgment on the pleadings performs the
office of a general, not a special, demurrer...” Fabbro v. Dardi & Co.
(1949) 93 Cal. App. 2d 247, 252.)
 
Analysis
             
a)      First
Cause of Action: Fraud and Deceit
            “The
elements of fraud are (a) a misrepresentation (false representation,
concealment, or nondisclosure); (b) scienter or knowledge of its falsity; (c)
intent to induce reliance; (d) justifiable reliance; and (e) resulting damage.”
(Hinesley v. Oakshade Town Ctr.
(2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 289, 294.) The facts constituting the alleged fraud must
be alleged factually and specifically as to every element of fraud, as the
policy of “liberal construction” of the pleadings will not ordinarily be
invoked. (Lazar v. Superior Court (1996)
12 Cal.4th 631, 645.)
To properly allege fraud against a corporation, the plaintiffs must plead the
names of the persons allegedly making the false representations, their authority
to speak, to whom they spoke, what they said or wrote, and when it was said or
written. (Tarmann v. State Farm Mut.
Auto. Ins. Co. (1991) 2 Cal.App.4th 153, 157.)
            Defendant’s first argument is that
because Plaintiff signed the RISC, which presented the terms explicitly,
including the price, there has been no misrepresentation. The Court agrees. 
            Plaintiff asserts three different
theories of fraud in their Complaint: (1) intentional misrepresentation, (2)
concealment, and (3) false promise. (Complaint, ¶ 63.) However, all are
defeated by the existence of the RISC (Complaint, Exh. A). Each theory demands
that either misrepresentation or concealment be a satisfied element in order
for the cause of action to stand. (See Hinesley, supra, at 294; see
generally Tarmann; and see Hambrick v. Healthcare Partners Medical
Group, Inc. (2015) 189 Cal.Rptr.3d 31, at 36, citing Graham v. Bank of
America, N.A., supra, 226 Cal.App.4th at p. 606, 172 Cal.Rptr.3d 218.) 
            Here, Defendant points to the RISC
which contains the pricing, explicitly stating the cash price at $86,180.00.
Moreover, Defendant points out that the RISC also lists the optional products
including the PDH Products, the service contract, and the debt cancellation
agreement, which amounted to an additional total of $3,085.00. The very terms
Plaintiff argues were concealed and misrepresented are clear and concise within
the signed RISC. Finally, the signature line displays the following:
 
            “YOU AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS CONTRACT.
YOU CONFIRM THAT BEFORE YOU SIGNED THIS CONTRACT, WE GAVE IT TO YOU, AND YOU
WERE FREE TO TAKE IT AND REVIEW IT. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ BOTH SIDES
OF THIS CONTRACT, INCLUDING THE ARBITRATION PROVISION ON THE REVERSE SIDE,
BEFORE SIGNING BELOW. YOU CONFIRM THAT YOU RECEIVED A COMPLETELY FILLED-IN COPY
WHEN YOU SIGNED IT.”
 
            Plaintiff argues that while at
Defendant’s place of business, Plaintiff was compelled to agree to the cash
price of the Subject Vehicle. However, there are no details within the
Complaint of coercion nor oppression. Nothing in the Complaint indicates to the
Court that Plaintiff was not free to either take the RISC home for further
review, or simply walk away from the dealership. Without misrepresentation, the
first cause of action fails.       
 
b)      Second
Cause of Action: Breach of Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing
            “A breach of the implied covenant of
good faith and fair dealing involves something beyond breach of the contractual
duty itself and it has been held that bad faith implies unfair dealing rather
than mistaken judgment.” (Careau &
Co. v. Security Pacific Business Credit, Inc. (1990) 222 Cal.App.3d 1371,
1394.) “If the allegations do not go beyond the statement of a mere contract
breach and, relying on the same alleged acts, simply seek the same damages or
other relief already claimed in a companion contract cause of action, they may
be disregarded as superfluous as no additional claim is actually stated … [T]he
only justification for asserting a separate cause of action for breach of the
implied covenant is to obtain a tort recovery.” (Id. at pp. 1394-1395.) To recover in tort for breach of the implied
covenant, the defendant must “have acted unreasonably or without proper cause.”
(Id. at p. 1395, citations and
italics omitted.)
            Here,
the Complaint fails to show any breach. Plaintiff argues upon opposition that
the price advertised on the Defendant’s website constitutes a legally binding
offer. (Opposition Papers, 2:20-22.) An advertisement disseminated to the
public at large generally does not constitute an offer, but rather is presumed
to be an invitation to consider, examine, and negotiate. (Donovan v. RRL
Corp. (2001) 26 Cal.4th 261, 271.) “An offer is the
manifestation of willingness to enter into a bargain, so made as to justify
another person in understanding that his assent to that bargain is invited and
will conclude it. [Citations.] The determination of whether a particular
communication constitutes an operative offer, rather than an inoperative step
in the preliminary negotiation of a contract, depends upon all the surrounding
circumstances. [Citation] The objective manifestation of the party's assent
ordinarily controls, and the pertinent inquiry is whether the individual to
whom the communication was made had reason to believe that it was intended as
an offer.” (Id.) In their opposition papers, although there are
exceptions to the general rule that advertisements do not constitute offers,
Plaintiff fails to detail the reasons why this advertisement is considered an
offer and not a mere invitation to make an offer. No promise is alleged, no
certain and definite terms are outlined, and although Plaintiff identifies
themselves as an offeree, so was the general public. Moreover, the terms of
acceptance are not delineated in the Complaint nor in the opposition papers. Accordingly,
the second cause of action falls to the Motion.   
 
Leave to Amend – 
 
Legal Standard & Analysis for Leave to Amend
             Leave to amend must be allowed where there is
a reasonable possibility of successful amendment. (See Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 349 [court shall not
“sustain a demurrer without leave to amend if there is any reasonable
possibility that the defect can be cured by amendment”]. As there is reasonable
possibility of successful amendment, Plaintiff is granted 20 days leave to
amend. 
 
CONCLUSION
            Accordingly, the Motion for Judgment
on the Pleadings by Defendant UAG Southbay, LLC dba Penske Cadillac Buick GMC
of Southbay is GRANTED as to the second and third causes of
action. Plaintiff is granted 20 days leave to amend.
            Prevailing
party on motion is ordered to give notice of ruling.
