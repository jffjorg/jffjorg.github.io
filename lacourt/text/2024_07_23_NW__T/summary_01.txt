And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling granting the defendant's motion to compel arbitration and stay the action. The defendant, Mercedes Benz USA, LLC, sought to enforce an arbitration agreement in a motor vehicle lease agreement between the plaintiffs, Hany Michael and Michel Michael, and a non-party lessor, Mercedes Benz of Beverly Hills. The court found that the defendant had standing to enforce the arbitration agreement as a third-party beneficiary, as the agreement explicitly named the defendant as a person who could enforce the agreement. The court also found that the scope of the arbitration agreement included any claims or disputes arising out of the credit application, lease, or resulting transactions. The court granted the defendant's motion to compel arbitration and stay the action pending the arbitration, as the defendant had met its burden of showing the existence of an arbitration agreement and the plaintiff's opposition failed to show a defense.
