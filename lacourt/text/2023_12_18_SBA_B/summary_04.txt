And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the demurrer filed by Margaret M. Lindsey, et al. (the defendants) is overruled. The defendants had argued that the foreclosure sale was not lawful and that they were not properly served with a 30-day notice to quit. However, the judge found that the plaintiff, Norwest Management, LLC, has adequately pled all the essential elements of an unlawful detainer action, including the facts that the defendants failed to vacate the premises after defaulting on their loan and losing their property to foreclosure. The judge also noted that whether the defendants were or were not served with the 30-day notice is a question of fact that is not proper for resolution with a demurrer. Similarly, whether the underlying foreclosure sale was or was not lawful constitutes an issue of fact that is not appropriate for resolution with a demurrer. The judge ordered the defendants to file an answer within five days of the date of the ruling and ordered the plaintiff to give notice of the ruling.
