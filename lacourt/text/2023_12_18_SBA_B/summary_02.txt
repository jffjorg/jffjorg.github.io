And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motions for protective order filed by defendants Toh The and Annick M. Oulai. The defendants had requested that the court limit the number of special interrogatories propounded by the plaintiffs to 35 each, and the court has granted this request. The court found that the number of special interrogatories propounded by the plaintiffs, 167 each, was excessive and unwarranted, and that the discovery sought was unreasonably cumulative or duplicative.

The court also granted the defendants' request for monetary sanctions in the amount of $942.18 each against the plaintiffs and their attorneys. The court ordered the plaintiffs to pay the sanctions within 30 days of the ruling.

The judge's decision is based on the Code of Civil Procedure sections 2030.040, 2030.090, and 2016.040, which provide for the court to limit discovery and grant protective orders in certain circumstances. The court also considered the meet and confer declarations submitted by the defendants and the plaintiffs' failure to meet the burden of justifying the number of special interrogatories propounded.
