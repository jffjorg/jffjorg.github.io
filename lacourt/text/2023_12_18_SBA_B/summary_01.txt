Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to seal exhibits and the application to appear as counsel pro hac vice. The motion to seal exhibits is granted, and the judge has ordered that the following documents be sealed: the unredacted version of the Declaration of Keith Victorine, the Product Analysis Report for Decedent Kenneth Ravizza's Durata Model 7121Q lead, the Traveler for Decedent's Durata Model 7121Q lead, certain medical records produced by Plaintiffs, the unredacted version of Defendants' Memorandum of Points and Authorities, and the unredacted version of Defendants' Separate Statement of Undisputed Material Facts. The judge finds that the overriding interest of preserving trade secrets supports sealing the documents and that there is a probability that the parties' interests will be prejudiced if the documents are made public.

The application to appear as counsel pro hac vice is also granted, and Gina Aiello Jordt is admitted as counsel pro hac vice in the pending matter. The judge has ordered that Defendants give notice of this ruling.
