And here is the English-text summary:

The Honorable Judge Maurice A. Leiter has issued a tentative ruling regarding a motion to bifurcate the trial in the case of Nicolle DeSanto v. Lynda Medof Levin, et al. The defendants are seeking to have the trial bifurcated to hear their cross-complaint for specific performance of a settlement agreement before the plaintiff's claims. The defendants argue that this will eliminate the need for a jury trial on the plaintiff's claims, while the plaintiff asserts that bifurcation could take away their right to a jury trial and that the cross-complaint lacks merit.

The court finds that bifurcation is appropriate, citing Code of Civil Procedure section 598, which allows for the trial of issues to be bifurcated to promote convenience of witnesses, the ends of justice, and the economy and efficiency of handling litigation. The court also notes that equitable issues are often tried before legal issues, and that bifurcation does not deprive the plaintiff of their right to a jury trial, as the trial on the cross-complaint would not be by jury.

The court will address the merits of the cross-complaint when the plaintiff's demurrer is heard. The defendants' motion to bifurcate is granted.
