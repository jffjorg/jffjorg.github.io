And here is a summary in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the motions filed by the parties in this case. The Court grants the Cross-Complainants' motion for leave to file a first amended cross-complaint, which seeks to correct a Cross-Defendant's name and add four new causes of action. The Court finds that the amendment is in the interests of justice, as the additional causes of action arise from the same underlying facts central to this action.

The Court denies the Plaintiff's motion to strike the Defendant W1's cross-complaint and answer to the complaint, which was filed on the ground that W1 is an unrepresented corporation. However, W1 has since filed a substitution of attorney and is now represented by counsel, and the Court finds no prejudice to the Plaintiff.

The Court's ruling is based on the case law cited in the document, including Posz v. Burchell and Higgins v. Del Faro. The Court's decision is intended to ensure that the parties are prepared for the trial and that the amendment does not prejudice the Plaintiff.
