And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling denies the defendant's motion to compel Dr. Ghalili's compliance with the deposition subpoena. The court finds that the motion contains defects, including a lack of a meet and confer declaration and failure to personally serve Dr. Ghalili with the motion. The court also notes that the applicable statute is CCP § 2025.480, not CCP § 2025.450. The court denies the motion without prejudice, allowing the parties to refile the motion with the necessary corrections.
