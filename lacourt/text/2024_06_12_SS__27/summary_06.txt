And here is the English text to summarize the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge has denied the Plaintiff's motion to compel further responses from the Defendant, finding that the motion is untimely. The Judge notes that the Defendant served its responses on February 21, 2024, and the deadline to file a motion to compel further responses was April 9, 2024. The Plaintiff filed the motion on May 13, 2024, which is outside the 45-day deadline. The Judge also notes that the responses were unverified, but this does not affect the timeliness of the motion. The Judge finds that the Plaintiff's arguments that the 45-day clock begins to run when the responses are verified are not persuasive, and that the closest relevant case, Golf & Tennis Pro Shop, Inc. v. Superior Court, 84 Cal.App.5th 127, 136, does not support the Plaintiff's position. The Judge concludes that the motion to compel further responses is untimely and is therefore denied.
