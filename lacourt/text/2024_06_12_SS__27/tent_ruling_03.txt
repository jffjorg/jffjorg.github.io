Legal Standard
CCP § 2020.010 permits discovery of non-party
witnesses through oral and written depositions. (See CCP § 2020.010(a)(1), (2);
Hawkins v. TACA International Airlines, S.A. (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 466,
476.) A deposition subpoena may command the attendance and testimony of the
deponent, the production of business records, or both. (CCP § 2020.020.)
Additional requirements regarding notification and a right to object are in place
where the records sought are consumer records, including personal medical
records. (See CCP § 1985.3.)  
CCP § 2025.480(a) similarly provides that “[i]f a deponent fails
to answer any question or to produce any document, electronically stored
information,¿or tangible thing under the deponent's control
that is specified in the deposition notice or a deposition subpoena, the party
seeking discovery may move the court for an order compelling that answer or
production.” Unlike CCP § 1987.1, CCP § 2025.480 also includes a time
limit (“[t]his motion shall be made no later than 60 days after the completion
of the record of the deposition”) and a meet and confer requirement (“[t]his motion . . . shall
be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040”).
(CCP § 2025.480(b).) Finally, CCP § 2025.480(c) requires that notice of the
motion be given to all parties and to the deponent. 
Discussion
On April 4, 2024, Defendant served a deposition
subpoena on Dr. Ghalili, Plaintiff's primary physician. Dr. Ghalili did not
produce documents or appear for his deposition scheduled for April 30, 2024.
Now, Defendant moves the Court to compel Dr. Ghalili’s compliance with the
deposition subpoena.
The motion contains several defects. First, the
motion is brought under CCP Section 2025.450, but that statute applies to the
deposition of a party. Dr. Ghalili is a non-party; therefore, the applicable
statute is Section 2025.480. Nonetheless, both Sections 2025.450 and 2025.480
require the motion to contain a meet and confer declaration, which is missing.
Second, "a written notice and all moving
papers supporting a motion to compel an answer to a deposition question or to
compel production of a document or tangible thing from a nonparty deponent must
be personally served on the nonparty deponent unless the nonparty deponent
agrees to accept service by mail or electronic service at an address or
electronic service address specified on the deposition record."
(California Rules of Court, rule 3.1346; see Code Civ. Proc., § 1010.6.) The
proof of service showed that the motion was not personally served on Dr.
Ghalili, and the moving party did not provide any evidence that Dr. Ghalili
agreed to accept service by mail or email. 
Thus, the present motion is denied without
prejudice.
