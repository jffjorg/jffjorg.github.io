CASE
NO./NAME: 23STCV03080 Roberto Mendoza v. John Doe
Moving Party: Plaintiff’s Counsel
Jennifer Bagosy  
Responding Party: Unopposed  
Notice: Sufficient  
Ruling: MOTION TO BE RELIEVED AS COUNSEL 
  
Background 
 
Attorney Jennifer Bagosy
represents Plaintiff. Bagosy moves to be relieved as counsel, citing an
irremediable breakdown of attorney-client relationship. No opposition has been
filed. 
 
Legal Standard¿ 
¿ 
The Court has discretion to allow
an attorney to withdraw, and such a motion should be granted provided that
there is no prejudice to the client and it does not disrupt the orderly process
of justice. (See Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915; People
v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398, 403-407.) 
¿ 
A motion to be relieved as counsel
must be made on Judicial Council Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion),
MC-052 (Declaration), and MC-053 (Proposed Order). (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362, subds. (a), (c), (e).) The requisite forms must be served “on the
client and on all parties that have appeared in the case.” (Cal. Rules of
Court, Rule 3.1362, subd. (d).) 
¿ 
Analysis and Conclusion¿ 
¿ 
Bagosy has filed Judicial Council
Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion), MC-052 (Declaration) and MC-053
(Proposed Order). Bagosy seeks to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff on the
grounds that there has been a breakdown of trust in the attorney-client
relationship. The Court finds this to be proper grounds for withdrawal. (See
Estate of Falco (1987) 188 Cal.App.3d 1004, 1014 (a breakdown in the
attorney-client relationship is grounds for allowing the attorney to
withdraw).) On May 7, 2024, Counsel personally served Plaintiff the
motion papers.
 
The Court
notes that the next hearing is an FSC set for 11/22/24, which
should be sufficient time for Plaintiff to retain new counsel. Alternatively,
if Plaintiff or new counsel needs additional time to prepare for trial,
sufficient time exists for Plaintiff to take action to seek a continuance of
the trial. Thus, the present motion to be relieved as counsel is GRANTED
effective upon service of the order on the motion on Plaintiff.
