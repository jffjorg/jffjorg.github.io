And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the defendant's motion to continue the trial and all related dates to July 22, 2024. The defendant argued that he needs more time to complete discovery, and the court found good cause to continue the trial based on the scheduled private mediation and the fact that the defendant entered the case in December 2023. The court also noted that the plaintiffs would not be prejudiced by a brief continuance to July 22, 2024. The final status conference is continued to July 8, 2024, and the trial is continued to July 22, 2024.
