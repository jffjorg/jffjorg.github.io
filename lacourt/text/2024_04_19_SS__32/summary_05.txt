**Tentative Ruling**

The Court has considered the motions to compel responses to demands for production, special interrogatories, and form interrogatories, as well as the request for monetary sanctions. The Defendant, Tamara Komashko, served the demands on the Plaintiffs, Anthony Raymond Covarrubias and Isaac Lopez, on January 4, 2023. Despite the demands, no responses were served. The Court finds that the Plaintiffs' failure to respond warrants the granting of the motions to compel. The Court also finds that the Plaintiffs' failure to respond justifies the imposition of monetary sanctions. The Court awards sanctions in the amount of $1,380.00 to the Defendant.

The Court grants the Defendant's motions to compel responses to demands for production, special interrogatories, and form interrogatories. The Plaintiffs are to provide verified responses, without objection, within 30 days. The Defendant is to receive monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,380.00.
