And here is the English-text summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Court has tentatively ruled to grant the Plaintiff's motion to set aside the dismissal of the case. The Plaintiff, Dexter Fuentes, filed a complaint against Defendant 3 Alameda Plaza LLC, which was served but did not file an answer. The Plaintiff obtained an entry of default, but the request for default judgment was denied. The Plaintiff failed to re-file a new default judgment request, and the case was subsequently dismissed. The Plaintiff has now moved to set aside the dismissal, citing excusable neglect by their counsel. The Court finds that the Plaintiff's counsel failed to re-submit the default judgment package due to excusable neglect, and therefore grants the motion. The matter is set for an Order to Show Cause re: Dismissal and/or Monetary Sanctions for Failure to Enter Default Judgment on May 20, 2024.
