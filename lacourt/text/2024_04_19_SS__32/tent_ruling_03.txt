OPPOSING PARTY:


Plaintiff
  Charles Edward Andrade



 
BACKGROUND
 
On September 30, 2021, Plaintiff Charles Edward Andrade (“Plaintiff”)
filed a complaint against Defendants Alexis Weng and Does 1 to 50 for negligence
related to a motor vehicle accident. Defendant Alexis Weng (“Defendant”) filed
an answer on February 25, 2022. 
 
On November 16, 2023, the Court granted Plaintiff’s unopposed motions
to compel Defendant’s responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One and to deem
admitted the Request for Admissions, Set One, served on Defendant. (Min. Order,
11/16/23.) The Court also imposed $800 in monetary sanctions against Defendant.
Plaintiff served electronic notice of the ruling on December 6, 2023. 
 
Plaintiff had also filed a motion to compel responses to Requests for
Production of Documents, Set One, but on the date of the hearing, there were no
appearances by either party and the motion was taken off calendar. (Min. Order,
11/21/23.) 
 
Defendant now moves to vacate these orders, along with the granting of
monetary sanctions. Plaintiff opposes. 
 
ANALYSIS
 
I.
Vacate Under Section 473(b)
 
Under Code
of Civil Procedure section 473(b), the Court may relieve a party from an order taken
against him through his mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable
neglect.  This application must be filed
no more than six months after entry of the order from which relief is sought,
and must contain an affidavit of fault demonstrating the moving party’s
mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. 
 
A mistake
is a basis for relief under section 473 when by reason of the mistake a party
failed to make a timely response.  Surprise occurs when a party is
unexpectedly placed in a position to his injury without any negligence of his
own. Excusable neglect is a basis for relief when the party has shown some
reasonable excuse for the default.  (Credit Managers Association of
California v. National Independent Business Alliance (1984) 162 Cal.App.3d
1166, 1173; Davis v. Thayer (1980) 113 Cal.App.3d 892, 905.)  Under
Code of Civil Procedure section 473, the moving party bears the burden of
demonstrating an excusable ground, such as fraud or mistake, justifying a
court’s vacating a judgment.  (Basinger v. Roger & Wells (1990)
220 Cal.App.3d 16, 23–24.)   
 
Relief under
this section is mandatory when based on an attorney affidavit of fault;
otherwise, it is discretionary. (Id.) However mandatory relief is only
available when a party fails to oppose a dismissal motion (“which are
procedurally equivalent to a default”). (Leader v. Health Industries of America, Inc. (2001) 89
Cal.App.4th 603, 620.) The mandatory relief provision
does not apply to dismissals for “failure to prosecute [citations omitted], dismissals
for failure to serve a complaint within three years [citations omitted],
dismissals based on running of the statute of limitations [citations omitted],
and voluntary dismissals entered pursuant to settlement [citations omitted].” (Id.)

 
            Here,
Defendant argues the order compelling Form Interrogatories, Set One should be
vacated under the discretionary and mandatory provisions of section 473(b). 
 
Procedurally, the present motion is
timely because it was filed on January 22, 2024, within six months after the subject
order on November 16, 2023. However, the mandatory provision does not apply.
Therefore, this motion is only subject to discretionary relief. 
 
Plaintiff propounded discovery on
June 30, 2022. Here, Defendant’s counsel (“Counsel”) declares that the
discovery was overlooked due to the high turnover of his office staff. (Liebhaber
Decl. ¶ 11–12.) Counsel argues that he did not receive notice of the motion to
compel, which was filed on October 19, 2023. Notice of the motion was served on
four email addresses, including his own. He declares that the other three
addresses belonged to people who left the company in August and September 2023.
(Id. ¶ 13.) He states that Plaintiff’s counsel should have seen that
these email addresses did not go through. (Id. ¶ 14.) Nevertheless,
Counsel declares: “I have been diligently checking my e-mail all this time and
did not receive Plaintiff’s Motions to Compel e-served on October 19, 2023 or
any time thereafter. Also, on December 12, 2023, I reviewed my emails from the
dates indicated in the proofs of service of the motions and I did not receive
any of the motions to compel. Consequently, my office did not provide
responses, file opposition to the motions, and did not appear on November 16,
2023 for the hearings on Motions to Compel and to Deem Requests for Admission
Admitted.” (Id. ¶ 16–17.) 
 
Counsel states he learned of the
motions on December 6, 2023, once the notice of the ruling was served on a
proper email address. (Id. ¶ 18.) 
 
In opposition, Plaintiff does not
address the issue of notice but asserts that on December 15, 2022, he informed
Defendant’s counsel that he would not grant further discovery extensions.
(Padua Decl. ¶ 6, Exh. 1.)  
 
The Court finds sufficient evidence
that counsel for Defendant did not receive notice of the motions. Even though Defendant’s
counsel does not argue that his email address was printed incorrectly on the proofs
of service, he declares, under penalty of perjury, that he was monitoring his
email and did not receive the notice. He also declares that the other three
attorneys who were given notice of the motion were no longer with the company
when it was served. 
 
Therefore, Defendant’s motions to
vacate the order to compel Form Interrogatories, Set One, and to Deem Admitted
Requests for Admissions, Set One, is granted. The Court denies as moot
Defendant’s motion to vacate compelling Request for Production of Documents,
Set One, since that motion was taken off calendar and no order exists. (See
Min. Order, 11/21/23.)
 
II. Relief from Waiver
 
If a party fails to timely serve a
response to interrogatories, “[t]he party to whom the interrogatories are
directed waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings under
Section 2030.230, as well as any objection to the interrogatories, including
one based on privilege or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4
(commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that
party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following
conditions are satisfied:
 
(1) The party has subsequently served a response that is in
substantial compliance with Sections 2030.210, 2030.220, 2030.230, and
2030.240.
(2) The party's failure to serve a timely response was the
result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.” (Code Civ. Proc. §
2030.290(a).) 
 
            Defendant
appears to seek relief under this provision. (Motion, 7.) Defendant only argues
that the discovery responses were “overlooked” due to a high turnover of staff.
(Liebhaber Decl. ¶ 12.) Based on this limited information, Defendant has not
shown that failure to serve the timely response was due to mistake,
inadvertence, or excusable neglect. Additionally, while Defendant asserts he
has served complete and verified responses, he has not attached copies of the
responses for the Court to determine substantial compliance. The Court may not
apply section 473 to grant relief from the waiver of objections. (See Zellerino
v. Brown (1991) 235 Cal.App.3d 1097, 1107 [“Relief under section 473 is
unavailable when the discovery act provides analogous, if more limited
relief.”].) Therefore, the motion for relief from waiver is denied. 
 
CONCLUSION AND
ORDER
 
Therefore, the Court GRANTS Defendant’s motion vacate the Court’s November 16, 2023 order granting
Plaintiff’s motion to compel Form Interrogatories and deeming Requests for
Admission admitted. 
 
The Court DENIES Defendant’s
request for relief from waiver of objections to Form Interrogatories, Set One
under 2030.290(a).

 
Defendant to provide notice and file a proof of service of such.
