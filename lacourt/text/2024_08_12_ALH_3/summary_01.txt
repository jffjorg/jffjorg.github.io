And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case brought by Maritsa Herrera against American Honda Motor Company, Inc. regarding a defective 2021 Honda Pilot. The plaintiff has requested that the defendant produce further responses and documents related to the defects in the vehicle, including emails from engineers and other documents. The defendant has objected to producing these documents, claiming that it would be overly burdensome and costly. The judge has overruled the defendant's objections and granted the plaintiff's motion. The defendant is ordered to serve further responses to the plaintiff's requests for production of documents and produce all responsive documents within 20 days. The judge notes that the defendant's objections were too general and failed to provide concrete evidence of the alleged burden and cost of producing the documents.
