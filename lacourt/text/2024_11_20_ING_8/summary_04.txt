Significant Statements:

  - "A demurrer for uncertainty may lie if the failure to label the parties and claims renders the complaint so confusing defendant cannot tell what he or she is supposed to respond to."
  - "With respect to questions of substantive law, there is no distinction between ordinary negligence and professional negligence because 'a defendant has only one duty, measured by one standard of care, under any given circumstances.'"
  - "The legislative intent is to require the plaintiff to make a motion, supported by admissible evidence after sufficient discovery has been undertaken in the case so the Court can act as a gatekeeper to screen garden variety medical malpractice claims from those suits where 'there is a substantial probability that plaintiff will prevail' on her or his claim of malice, oppression, or fraud."

And here is a summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to demurrer and strike the punitive damages allegations in a medical malpractice case. The plaintiff, Sylvia Lee Senegal King, filed a complaint against Torrance Memorial Medical Center and others, alleging causes of action for negligent medical malpractice, medical malpractice, and professional negligence. The defendant filed a demurrer and motion to strike, arguing that the plaintiff's allegations were insufficient and duplicative.

The judge sustained the demurrer, finding that the plaintiff's causes of action for medical malpractice and professional negligence were duplicative and that the punitive damages allegations were premature. The judge granted the motion to strike the punitive damages allegations, finding that it was premature for the plaintiff to include them in the pleading.

The judge gave the plaintiff 20 days to amend the pleading to consolidate the allegations of medical malpractice and professional negligence into a single cause of action. The judge also ordered the defendant to give notice of the ruling. The judge's ruling is based on California Code of Civil Procedure sections 430.10, 435, 436, and 437, as well as Civil Code section 3294.
