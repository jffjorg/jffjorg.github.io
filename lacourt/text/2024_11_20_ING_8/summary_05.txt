```

And here is a brief summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the motion for interpleader, which means that the funds from the settlement agreement will be held by the court until the competing claims against the settlement funds can be resolved. The court has also overruled the demurrer filed by defendant-in-intervention LaToya S. Redd dba Redd Law, finding that the complaint-in-intervention states facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action for declaratory relief. The court has ruled that the motion to strike is MOOTED, as it is no longer necessary since the demurrer has been overruled. The court will discuss with counsel what mechanism will be used to enable Liberty Mutual to interplead the funds and to have the competing claimants against the settlement funds to resolve their claims.
