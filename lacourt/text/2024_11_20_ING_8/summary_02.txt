And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to compel further responses to the plaintiff's discovery requests. The defendant had argued that the plaintiff's responses were evasive and incomplete, particularly with regard to dashcam footage from the plaintiff's Tesla vehicle. The judge found that the plaintiff had provided a Code-compliant response, stating that it had produced all responsive documents in its possession, custody, or control. The judge noted that the plaintiff's opposition indicated that it had produced a screenshot/photo, which is the only responsive document in its possession. The judge also found that the defendant's meet and confer efforts were sufficient, but that they took place prior to the serving of the plaintiff's supplemental responses. Finally, the judge noted that any third-party discovery to Tesla or the owner of the car would be required to secure a copy of the video.
