And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion to strike certain allegations in the cross-complaint filed by Jay and Thomas Zimmerman against David Zimmerman. The motion seeks to strike allegations dating back to 1994 and a request for declaratory relief regarding a property called Bayberry.

The judge grants the motion to strike the allegations dating back to 1994, finding that they are barred by the statute of limitations. The judge also grants the motion to strike the request for declaratory relief regarding Bayberry, finding that Jay and Thomas Zimmerman have failed to plead or argue in their opposition how the statute of limitations does not bar this claim.

The judge is concerned that it may be premature to include valuation of derivative claims in the appraisal reports, and suggests two alternative processes: (1) valuing the businesses now without including figures for uncertain and undetermined claims, or (2) deferring the appraisers' assessments until after an evidentiary hearing or the trial.

The judge orders David Zimmerman to give notice and sets a hearing date for November 20, 2024. The judge also notes that the parties will need to discuss the status of derivative claims and how they will be included in the appraisal reports.
