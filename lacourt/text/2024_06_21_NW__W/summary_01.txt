Significant Statements:

Here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has tentatively ruled that the defendant's demurrer to the fifth cause of action for negligent misrepresentation is overruled. The court finds that the plaintiff has sufficiently alleged that the defendant misrepresented the safety of the fried rice. The court also denied the defendant's motion to strike certain paragraphs of the complaint. The court noted that the plaintiff has failed to remove a request for attorney fees and that the allegations against the defendant Christine Doe are still lacking. The court struck the request for attorney fees and denied the motion to strike.
