And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling on a product liability action brought by Carlos Aguilar against P.F. Chang's III, LLC and Christine Doe. The case arises from Aguilar consuming fried rice from a P.F. Chang's restaurant in Sherman Oaks on August 4, 2021, and biting into a metal object, resulting in injuries. Aguilar alleges that Christine Doe, the supervisor/manager of the restaurant, made misrepresentations about the safety of the food. The court has previously sustained a demurrer to the fifth cause of action, alleging negligent misrepresentation, but Aguilar has now alleged sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action. The court denies the demurrer and overrules the demurrer. The court also denies the defendant's motion to strike certain allegations, including requests for attorney fees. The case will proceed to a hearing on June 21, 2024.
