And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the complaint and finds it unclear, particularly in regards to the alleged abuse and the relevance of the plaintiff being in a video. The plaintiff alleges that the school failed to protect them and ensure a safe environment, but the complaint lacks specific details and events. The only other alleged event of abuse mentioned is the high frequency of fights at the school and Escobedo's propensity for violence. The judge notes that it is unclear how the plaintiff can claim ignorance of a doe defendant's identity when Escobedo is identified as one of the students who physically assaulted the plaintiff. Overall, the judge has not made a final ruling and is seeking further clarification on these issues.
