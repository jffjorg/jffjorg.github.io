[1] Admittedly, the
complaint is unclear namely as it largely asks questions (see e.g., “Why wasn’t
everyone enrolled in Period 7 PE brought in together to find out who the second
video was taken by? Why did SCHOOL not do their job to protect PLAINTIFF and
ensure a safe environment?” (¶20).) There
is then another allegation stating that “On April 26, 2023, Plaintiff was on
SnapChat with the baseball team from 2021.” (¶21.) The relevancy of Plaintiff being in a video is unclear.  
 


[2] No other events of
abuse are articulated aside from the fact that the school experiences a high
frequency of fights (¶25) and that Escobedo
has a propensity for violence (¶28.) 


[3] It is unclear how
Plaintiff is truly ignorant of a doe defendant’s identity when Escobedo is
identified as one of the students physically assaulting Plaintiff. (Complaint
p. 12.)
