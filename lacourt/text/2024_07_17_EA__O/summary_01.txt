Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the defendant's motion to strike punitive damages from the complaint. The motion was made on the grounds that punitive damages are prohibited by Code of Civil Procedure section 425.14, which requires a court order before a plaintiff can seek punitive damages against a religious organization. The judge found that the plaintiff failed to provide any analysis or evidence to support their claim for punitive damages, and therefore the motion is granted. The judge also noted that even if the statute is unconstitutional, the plaintiff failed to raise any argument or cite any authority to support their claim, and therefore the issue is waived. Leave to amend the complaint is pending.
