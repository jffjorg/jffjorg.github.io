CITY OF LOS ANGELES; et al.,

  Case No.:  23STCV02179 
  Hearing Date:  January 13, 2025
 
     [Tentative] order RE:
PLAINTIFF’S MOTION for attorney fees,
  costs and expert fees
 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            Plaintiff Lee Newson (“Plaintiff”)
commenced this action against Defendant City of Los Angeles (“Defendant”) on February
1, 2023.  Plaintiff asserted causes of
action for (1) Disability Discrimination; (2) Work Environment Harassment; (3)
Retaliation; and (4) Failure to Prevent Harassment, Discrimination, and
Retaliation.  
After a jury trial, the jury found in
favor of plaintiff.  The jury awarded
plaintiff $1,500,000.00 in  damages. 
LEGAL
STANDARD
Under California law, attorney fees are
recoverable from the opposing party only as specifically provided by statute or
contract. (See, California Code of Civil
Procedure, Section 1021.)  Because
plaintiff proved a violation of FEHA, she is entitled to seek an award of
reasonable attorney fees.   (See, California Labor Code, Section
12965(b).) Although the statute states that the court “may” award fees, a
prevailing plaintiff is entitled to fees “absent circumstances that would
render the award unjust.” (Stephens v.
Coldwell Banker (1988) 199 CA3d 1394, 1406; Horsford v. Board of Trustees of Calif. State Univ. (2005) 132
CA4th 359, 394.)
“The verified time statements of the
attorneys, as officers of the court, are entitled to credence in the absence of
a clear indication the records are erroneous.” 
(Horsford v. Board Of Trustees Of
California State University (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 359, 396.)  If the motion is supported by evidence, the
opposing party must respond with specific evidence showing that the fees are
unreasonable.  (Premier Med. Mgmt. Sys. v. California Ins. Guarantee Ass’n (2008)
163 Cal.App.4th 550, 560-63.)  The Court
has discretion to reduce fees that result from inefficient or duplicative use
of time.  (Horsford, supra, 132
Cal.App.4th at 395.)  
The most widely accepted approach for
determining a “reasonable” fee award is the “lodestar” method.  The lodestar figure is calculated using the
reasonable rate, multiplied by the reasonable number of hours spent on the
case. (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24
C4th 1122, 1131-1132.)
OBJECTIONS
Plaintiff’s objections to the opinion of
Karelis are OVERRULED.
ANALYSIS
            Plaintiff moves for an award of
attorney fees in the amount of $2,888,850.00.   
            A.
Entitlement to Attorney Fees
As stated previously, the jury awarded
plaintiff $1,500,000.00 in  damages. As
such, Plaintiff is the prevailing party in this action, and as prevailing party
in this action, Plaintiff is entitled to a reasonable amount of attorney fees.
The issue to be addressed is the reasonableness of the requested amount of
attorney fees, costs, and expenses.
B.
Reasonableness of Fees
1. Reasonable Hourly Rates
Plaintiff retained the law firm of L &
B Law Group for this action.  A total of five
 attorneys and/or paralegals worked on
this action from L & B Law Group.  The
hourly rates claimed by L & B Law Group attorneys and/or paralegals who
worked on this case are: (1) Yuk Law, Esq. $950.00/hr.;
(2) Kent Brandmeyer, Esq. $950.00/hr.; (3) Kevin Miller, Esq. $650.00/hr.; (4)
Lyla Stone, Esq. $450.00/hr.; (5) paralegal Amber Carlton $225.00/hr.
 “In determining hourly rates, the court
must look to the ‘prevailing market rates in the relevant community.’”  (Heritage
Pacific Financial, LLC v. Monroy (2013) 215 Cal.App.4th 972, 100.)  In making this determination, “[t]he court
may rely on its own knowledge and familiarity with the legal market.”  (Ibid.) 

The Court finds that the reasonable hourly
rate in this case for L & B Law Group attorneys and paralegals who worked
on this case are: (1) Yuk Law, Esq. $700.00/hr.; (2) Kent Brandmeyer, Esq. $700/hr.;
(3) Kevin Miller, Esq. $525.00/hr.; (4) Lyla Stone, Esq. $450.00/hr.; (5)
paralegal Amber Carlton $250.00/hr.
2. Hours Reasonably Expended
The hours claimed by L & B Law Group
attorneys and paralegals who worked on this case are: (1) Yuk Law, Esq. 393
hours; (2) Kent Brandmeyer, Esq. 504.0 hours; (3) Kevin Miller, Esq. 766.80
hours; (4) Lyla Stone, Esq. 193 hours; (5) paralegal Amber Carlton 27.10 hours.
            Defendant claims that the number of
hours billed is unreasonable.  
The Court finds that the reasonable hours
spent by L & B Law Group attorneys and paralegals who worked on this case
are: (1) Yuk Law, Esq. 390 hours; (2) Kent Brandmeyer, Esq. 490 hours; (3) Kevin
Miller, Esq. 700 hours; (4) Lyla Stone, Esq. 190 hours; (5) paralegal Amber
Carlton 25 hours.
In making this determination, the court
found that some of the billing was excessive, especially for attorneys as
experienced as plaintiff’s counsel. Plaintiff had five attorneys and paralegals
working on this case.  While plaintiff
has the right to have multiple attorneys, the court finds that some of the
attorneys’ work were duplicative and redundant. 

C.
Multiplier 
Plaintiff requests a lodestar multiplier
enhancement.  
 The
Court finds that an upward adjustment to the lodestar is not warranted in this
action. While this matter was heavily litigated, it was a straightforward FEHA
action.  There is no evidence that
Plaintiff’s counsel was precluded from taking other cases. 
D. 
Expert Fees and Costs.
Plaintiff claims expert fees and costs in
the amount of $236,103.56.  Defendant
does not oppose this request.
 
CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing reasons,
Plaintiff’s motion for attorney fees is GRANTED.  The Court awards $1,075,250.00 in attorney
fees and $236,103.56 in expert fees and costs.
