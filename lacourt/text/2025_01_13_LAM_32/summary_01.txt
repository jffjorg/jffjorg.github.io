And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the plaintiff's motion for attorney fees, costs, and expert fees. The plaintiff, Lee Newson, is seeking an award of $2,888,850 in attorney fees, costs, and expert fees, based on the jury's award of $1,500,000 in damages.

The judge has determined that the plaintiff is entitled to attorney fees, as the jury found in her favor and she is the prevailing party. The issue is the reasonableness of the requested amount of attorney fees, costs, and expenses.

The judge has found that the reasonable hourly rate for the attorneys and paralegals who worked on the case is between $700 and $450 per hour, and that the reasonable number of hours spent on the case is between 390 and 700 hours. The judge has also determined that some of the billing was excessive and duplicative, and has reduced the number of hours claimed by the attorneys.

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion for attorney fees, but has reduced the award to $1,075,250. The judge has also awarded expert fees and costs in the amount of $236,103.56.

The judge has concluded that the plaintiff's motion for attorney fees is granted, and that the award of attorney fees, expert fees, and costs is fair and reasonable.
