Summary:

The tentative ruling grants the motion to compel the deposition of Karen Kashanian, a defendant's employee, who failed to appear for deposition despite proper notice. The court finds that Plaintiffs properly served Defendant with the Notice of Deposition and met and conferred regarding the deposition. Defendant's counsel offered alternative dates for the deposition, but there is no evidence that any deposition dates were actually provided to Plaintiffs' counsel. The court awards sanctions to Plaintiffs in the amount of $2,765.00, which includes the cost of reviewing the case file, preparing the motion, and appearing at the hearing, as well as the court reporter fee. Defendant is ordered to provide alternative deposition dates and pay the sanctions within 30 days.
