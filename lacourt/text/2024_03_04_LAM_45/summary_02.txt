Summary:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the motion to quash service of summons and dismiss the complaint against the defendants. The court finds that the plaintiffs have not proven by a preponderance of the evidence that the court has personal jurisdiction over the defendants. The defendants are a limited liability company registered in Arizona and New Mexico, and they have no local agent for service of process in California. The court also finds that the defendants' occasional contacts with California are not continuous and systematic, and therefore, the court does not have general jurisdiction over the defendants. The plaintiffs argue that the defendants have purposefully availed themselves of California by providing arms and ammunition for film sets, but the court finds that this is not sufficient to establish specific jurisdiction. The court notes that the defendants' contacts with California are unrelated to the alleged injuries and are therefore not sufficient to establish jurisdiction.
