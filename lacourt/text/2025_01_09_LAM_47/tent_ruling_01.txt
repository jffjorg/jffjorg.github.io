MOTION
TO BE RELIEVED AS COUNSEL

 
MOVING PARTY:               Attorney Sakeenah Redmond of SNR Law Group, PC,
Counsel for Plaintiff. 
 
RESPONDING PARTY(S): No response on
eCourt as of 01/06/25 
 
STATEMENT
OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
            This is an action for fraud that was filed on February 27, 2023. Plaintiff
alleges that a trust was established using his identity without his knowledge
or consent, and that a false death certificate was recorded bearing his name in
Illinois. 
 
Attorney Sakeenah Redmond of SNR
Law Group, PC, moves to be relived as counsel for Plaintiff. 
            
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Attorney Sakeenah Redmond of SNR
Law Group, PC, moves to be relived as counsel for Plaintiff. 
 
Moving counsel filed all three required forms (MC-051,
-052, and -053). However, no proof of service by mail or personal service was
filed. Further, although Moving Counsel’s Declaration Form MC-052 states that
Moving Counsel served the moving papers on Plaintiff by mail (MC-052 ¶ 3), the
moving papers provide no dates for the time service by mail was made, nor do
they specify the address at which service was made. The Court therefore cannot
presume that notice of this motion was properly given. 
 
            Accordingly,
Attorney Sakeenah Redmond of SNR Law Group, PC’s Motion to be
Relieved as Counsel for Plaintiff is CONTINUED to January 30, 2025 at 9:00 a.m.
 
 
Moving
Counsel is directed to give notice to all parties and file proof of service
with the Court. 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.

            Any party may submit on the
tentative ruling by contacting the courtroom via email at Smcdept47@lacourt.org by no later than 4:00 p.m. the day
before the hearing. All interested parties must be copied on the email. It
should be noted that if you submit on a tentative ruling the court will still
conduct a hearing if any party appears. By submitting on the tentative you
have, in essence, waived your right to be present at the hearing, and you
should be aware that the court may not adopt the tentative, and may issue an
order which modifies the tentative ruling in whole or in part.
