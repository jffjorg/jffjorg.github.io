And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, Lei Cheng, has moved for an order deeming the truth of matters stated in requests for admissions propounded to the plaintiff, Fernando Gonzalez, as admitted. The defendant has also requested sanctions against the plaintiff and his counsel, jointly and severally, in the amount of $462.50.

The court finds that the defendant is entitled to an order deeming the truth of the matters stated in the requests for admissions, as the plaintiff failed to respond to the requests. The court also grants the defendant's request for sanctions, but reduces the amount to $277.50, reflecting 1.5 hours of attorney time at $185.00 per hour.

The defendant's motion for an order deeming the truth of matters stated in requests for admissions as admitted is granted. The defendant's request for sanctions is granted in the amount of $277.50 against the plaintiff and his counsel, jointly and severally. Payment is to be made within 10 days of this order.
