And here is the English-text summary:

The judge, Theresa M. Traber, has issued a tentative ruling in a fraud case filed by Julian Parra against the Julian Parra Trust. The case alleges that a trust was established using Parra's identity without his knowledge or consent, and that a false death certificate was recorded in Illinois. Attorney Sakeenah Redmond of SNR Law Group, PC, moves to be relieved as counsel for Parra. However, the court cannot presume that notice of the motion was properly given due to the lack of proof of service by mail or personal service. Therefore, the motion is continued to January 30, 2025, and moving counsel is directed to give notice to all parties and file proof of service with the court.
