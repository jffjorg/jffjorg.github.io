Defendant’s Motion to Deem the

Plaintiff as Admitted is GRANTED.
 
            Defendant’s

DISCUSSION:
 
Defendant moves for an order
deeming the truth of matters stated in requests for admissions propounded to
Plaintiff as admitted, and for sanctions. 
 
 
 
Legal
Standard
 
When a party to
whom requests for admission are directed fails to respond, the party
propounding the requests may move for an order that the truth of any matters
specified in the requests be deemed admitted. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.280(b).)
“The court shall make this order [to deem the requests admitted], unless it
finds that the party to whom the request for admissions have been directed has
served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests
for admission that is in substantial compliance with section 2033.220.” (Code
Civ. Proc. § 2033.280(c).)
 
Analysis
 
            Defendant
served Plaintiff’s counsel with Defendant’s first set of Requests for
Admissions on October 16, 2024. (Declaration of Landon I. Crawl ISO Mot. ¶ 4.)
To date, no response has been received. (Id. ¶ 6.) Defendant is
therefore entitled to an order deeming the truth of the matters stated in these
requests.
 
Sanctions
 
Defendant also requests sanctions
against Plaintiff and his counsel, jointly and severally, in the amount of
$462.50. 
 
Failure to respond or submit to an
authorized method of discovery is a misuse of the discovery process for which
sanctions may be imposed. (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 2023.010(d); 2023.030(a).)
Sanctions are mandatory on the party or attorney or both whose failure to serve
a timely response to requests for admission necessitated a motion to deem
requests for admissions as admitted. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.280(c).)
 
Here, Defendant requests $462.50
against Plaintiff and his counsel, jointly and severally, arising from 1.5
hours of attorney time incurred at $185.00 per hour to prepare this motion, and
an additional anticipated hour to appear for the hearing on this matter. (Crawl
Decl. ¶ 7.) The Court declines to award attorney’s fees for anticipated hours
as such time has not actually been incurred. The Court therefore awards reduced
attorney’s fees in the amount of $277.50, reflecting 1.5 hours of
attorney time at $185.00 per hour. 
 
CONCLUSION:

 
            Accordingly,
Defendant’s Motion to Deem the Truth of Matters Stated in Requests for
Admissions (Set One) Propounded to Plaintiff as Admitted is GRANTED.
 
            Defendant’s
request for sanctions is GRANTED in the amount of $277.50 against
Plaintiff and his counsel, jointly and severally. Payment is to be made within
10 days of this order. 
 
            Moving
Party to give notice.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.

tentative ruling by contacting the courtroom via email at Smcdept47@lacourt.org by no later than 4:00 p.m. the day
before the hearing. All interested parties must be copied on the email. It
should be noted that if you submit on a tentative ruling the court will still
conduct a hearing if any party appears. By submitting on the tentative you
have, in essence, waived your right to be present at the hearing, and you
should be aware that the court may not adopt the tentative, and may issue an
order which modifies the tentative ruling in whole or in part.
