And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Peacock Homestead LLC, et al. v. Jeffrey Prang, as Assessor for the County of Los Angeles, and the County of Los Angeles. The case involves a dispute over whether property lines in the Portuguese Bend area are moving due to a slow-moving landslide and whether the Los Angeles County Assessor needs to reassess parcels annually. The court has sustained the demurrer filed by the defendants, finding that the complaint fails to plead an actual controversy and that the statutory procedures associated with assessment appeals connote that the central responsibility of county boards is to decide questions of valuation. The court has also found that Section 4807 of the California Revenue and Taxation Code bars the suit, as it would prevent the collection of a future tax. The court has given the parties leave to amend their complaint.
