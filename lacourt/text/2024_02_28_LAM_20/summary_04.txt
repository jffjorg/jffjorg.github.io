English-text summary:

The Judge denies the motions to strike the Complaint's prayer for punitive damages filed by the defendants, Henry Siegel and Bancroft Towers, LLC. The Judge finds that the plaintiffs have pleaded a conversion claim relating to pledge funds in the amount of $100,000 and an intent to injure, which satisfies the requirements for punitive damages. The Judge notes that the request for punitive damages is made only generally in the prayer for relief, but this is not a defect that can be addressed through a motion to strike. The Judge rules that the appropriate vehicle to address any defects in the cause of action would be a demurrer or motion for judgment on the pleadings.
