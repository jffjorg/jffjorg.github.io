And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the motion to compel plaintiff William West to comply with expert witness disclosure requirements is denied as moot. This is because plaintiff does not oppose the motion and is willing to prepare and serve an amended expert declaration with a brief narrative statement and produce discoverable reports and writings within 20 days. The moving parties are to give notice of this ruling. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, counsel are strongly encouraged to submit on the tentative or appear by LACourtConnect rather than in person.
