The Judge's tentative ruling grants in part the Plaintiff's motion to amend the judgment to add non-parties as judgment debtors. The Court grants the request to add MSP Properties, LLC, MSP Properties V, LLC, and MSP Properties VIII, LLC as judgment debtors, but denies the request to add Donna Michael as a judgment debtor. The Court also denies the request for attorneys' fees, filing fees, and service fees related to the motion.

The Court finds that adding the guarantors as judgment debtors is necessary to carry out the parties' intent and to prevent injustice to the Plaintiff.
