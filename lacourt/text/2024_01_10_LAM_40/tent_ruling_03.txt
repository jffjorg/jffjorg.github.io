Background
Plaintiff Orlando Garcia sues Defendants
Esperanza Molina (in individual and representative capacity as trustee of The
Esperanza Molina Revocable Trust - 1995 Executed September 6, 1995) (Molina), Samantha
L. Mejia (Mejia), and Does 1 through 50 pursuant to an August 2, 2023 Complaint
alleging claims of (1) Violation of the Unruh Civil Rights Act (Cal. Civ. Code
§§ 51-53) and (2) Violation of the California Disabled Persons Act (Cal. Civ.
Code § 54.1).
The claims arise from allegations
that in November 2022, Plaintiff Garcia—an individual suffering from cerebral
palsy who cannot walk and uses a wheelchair for mobility—visited Tamales
Alberto 2 (the Restaurant), a restaurant located at 1378 Sunset Blvd., Los
Angeles, California (the Property). Defendant Molina is alleged to have been
the Property’s owner in November 2022 and is alleged as the current owner of
the Property. Defendant Mejia is alleged to have been the owner of the
Restaurant in November 2022 and is alleged to be the owner of the Restaurant
currently. Plaintiff alleges that Defendants violated the Unruh Civil Rights
Act (the UCRA) by failing to comply with paths of travel and dining surface standards
set out by the Americans with Disability Act (ADA), which has been incorporated
into the UCRA. The paths of travel are alleged to have been too narrow, i.e.,
less than 36 inches in width, which was difficult for Plaintiff Garcia to
navigate in a wheelchair, particularly with a curb on one side of the path of
travel. The dining surfaces at the Restaurant are alleged to have not had
enough toe clearance under the indoor dining surfaces.
On August 2, 2023, Defendants
demurred to the Complaint’s two causes of action on sufficiency and uncertainty
in pleading grounds.
The demurrer is opposed and now
before the Court.
 
Demurrer
Demurrer
Sufficiency Standard
A
demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the complaint states a cause of action.
(Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747; see Code Civ. Proc., §
430.10, subd. (e).) This device can be used only to challenge defects that
appear on the face of the pleading under attack or from matters outside the
pleading that are judicially noticeable. (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39
Cal.3d 311, 318.) To sufficiently allege a cause of action,
a complaint must allege all the ultimate
facts—that is, the facts needed to establish each element of the cause of
action pleaded. (Committee on Children’s Television, Inc. v. General Foods
Corp. (1983) 35 Cal.3d 197, 212, superseded by statute as stated in Branick
v. Downey Savings & Loan Assn. (2006) 39 Cal.4th 235, 242.)
Thus, “[t]o survive a [general] demurrer, the complaint need only allege facts
sufficient to state a cause of action; each evidentiary fact that might
eventually form part of the plaintiff’s proof need not be alleged.” (C.A. v.
William S. Hart Union High School Dist. (2012) 53 Cal.4th 861, 872.) In
testing the sufficiency of the cause of action, the demurrer admits the truth
of all material facts properly pleaded. (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital Dist.
(1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 966-67.) A demurrer, however, “does not admit
contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law.” (Daar v. Yellow Cab
Co. (1967) 67 Cal.2d 695, 713.) When considering demurrers, courts read the
allegations liberally and in context. (Taylor v. City of Los Angeles Dept.
of Water and Power (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1228, disapproved on other
grounds, Jones v. Lodge at Torrey Pines Partnership (2008) 42 Cal.4th
1158, 1162.) The face of the complaint includes exhibits attached to the
complaint. (Frantz v. Blackwell (1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 91, 94.) If facts
appearing in the exhibits contradict those alleged, the facts in the exhibits
take precedence. (Holland v. Morse Diesel Intern., Inc. (2001) 86
Cal.App.4th 1443, 1447, superseded by statute on other grounds as stated in White
v. Cridlebaugh (2009) 178 Cal.App.4th 506, 521.)
Uncertainty
Legal Standard 
A
demurrer to a pleading lies where the pleading is uncertain, ambiguous, or
unintelligible. (Code Civ. Proc. § 430.10, subd. (f).) “A demurrer for
uncertainty is strictly construed, even where a complaint is in some respects
uncertain, because ambiguities can be clarified under modern discovery
procedures.” (Khoury v. Maly’s of California, Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th
612, 616, disapproved on other grounds in Quelimane Co. v. Stewart Title
Guar. Co. (1998) 19 Cal.4th 26, 46 [holding claims for unfair business
practices need not be pled specifically, impliedly disapproving Khoury].)
As a result, a special demurrer for uncertainty is not intended to reach
failure to incorporate sufficient facts in the pleading but is directed only at
uncertainty existing in the allegations already made. (People v. Taliaferro
(1957) 149 Cal.App.2d 822, 825, disapproved on other grounds in Jefferson v.
J.E. French Co. (1960) 54 Cal.2d 717, 719-720 [statute of limitations
question].) Where complaint is sufficient to state a cause of action and to
apprise defendant of issues he is to meet, it is not properly subject to a
special demurrer for uncertainty. (See ibid.; see also Gressley v.
Williams (1961) 193 Cal.App.2d 636, 643 [“A special demurrer [for
uncertainty] should be overruled where the allegations of the complaint are
sufficiently clear to apprise the defendant of the issues which he is to
meet”].)
Complaint,
First and Second Cause of Action, Violation of the Unruh Civil Rights Act (Cal.
Civ. Code §§ 51-53, 54.1): OVERRULED
The
first and second causes of action rely on the same factual pattern to support
violations of the UCRA and ADA: The ADA sets out certain standards for paths of
travel and dining surfaces in places of public accommodation, like the
Restaurant, which were violated by Defendants when, in November 2022, while
visiting the Restaurant on the Property, Plaintiff Garcia personally
experienced non-compliant paths of travel and dining surfaces, which made it
difficult for Plaintiff to navigate his wheelchair and to eat or drink (based
on toe clearance). The first cause of action relies on the ADA provisions and
their incorporation into Civil Code section 51, subdivision (f), and the second
cause of action relies on the ADA provisions and their incorporation into Civil
Code section 54.1, subdivision (d). (Complaint, ¶¶ 1-6, 10-18, 32-44, 45-48 [visit
in ¶¶ 10-18; ADA provisions in ¶¶ 13, 33; UCRA incorporation statutes in ¶¶ 42,
46].)
In
their demurrer, Defendants argue that (1) the paths and dining seats are and
were ADA compliant in November 2022, (2) this is a sham pleading because
Plaintiff never went to the restaurant, (3) Plaintiff lacks standing to allege
the first cause of action because he fails to allege that he experienced
discrimination in his enjoyment of services at the Restaurant, (4) the
Complaint does not allege a sufficient injury for the first cause of action
(though the demurrer provides no specifics as to how injuries were conclusory
alleged), and (5) the second cause of action fails for the same reasons as the
first cause of action. (Demurrer, pp. 4-8.)
The
Court finds in favor of Plaintiff.
Plaintiff
argues that the Complaint is sufficiently pled because each of the required
factual allegations for Title III of the ADA were made. (Opposition, p. 6.)
Moreover, Plaintiff argues that the Complaint addresses each of the
requirements under C.C.P. § 425.50(a). The Court agrees. Plaintiff has alleged
sufficient ultimate facts to allege that he visited a place of public
accommodation and that the paths of travel and dining surfaces at the
Restaurant on the Property were not ADA accessible, making it difficult for
Plaintiff to use the paths of travel and to eat and drink at the Restaurant,
with dining complicated by “toe clearance.” The specific inches alleged in the
Complaint regarding the path of travel (36 inches) are supported by ADA
Guidelines. (See 2010 ADA Standards for Accessible Design, § 403.5.1 (Sep.
15, 2010) U.S. Department of Justice <https://www.ada.gov/law-and-regs/design-standards/2010-stds/>
[as of Nov. 22, 2023].) So are the allegations regarding toe clearance. (2010
ADA Standards for Accessible Design, §§ 306-306.3.5 (Sep. 15, 2010) U.S.
Department of Justice <https://www.ada.gov/law-and-regs/design-standards/2010-stds/>
[as of Nov. 22, 2023].)
Defendants
argue in their reply that (1) Plaintiff lacks standing and (2) Plaintiff
attempts to circumvent the standing requirement. (Reply, pp. 2-4.) However, Defendants’
reliance on Martin v. Hotel & Transp. Consultants, Inc., Overlook
at Blue Ravine, and Strojnik v. Kapalua Land Co. Ltd. is immaterial
because these are unpublished cases. (Reply, pp. 4-6.)
The
Court thus finds that the Complaint sufficiently alleges ADA violations and
thus sufficiently alleges UCRA violations.
The
Court specifically notes that Defendants are not arguing that paths of travel
under 36 inches or that dining seats without sufficient knee and toe clearance
are not ADA and UCRA violations, but rather, that the evidence will show that
(1) the paths of travel and dining seats are ADA compliant and (2) Plaintiff
never visited the restaurant. Such arguments are better reserved for
evidence-based motions like summary judgment. Here, the Court is limited to the
pleadings.
Defendants’
demurrer is thus OVERRULED.
 
Motion to
Strike 
 
The court may, upon a motion, or at any time in its
discretion, and upon terms it deems proper, strike any irrelevant, false, or
improper matter inserted in any pleading. (Code Civ. Proc., § 436(a).) The
court may also strike all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in
conformity with the laws of this state, a court rule, or an order of the court.
(Id., § 436(b).) The grounds for a
motion to strike are that the pleading has irrelevant, false or improper
matter, or has not been drawn or filed in conformity with laws. (Id. § 436.) The grounds for moving to
strike must appear on the face of the pleading or by way of judicial notice. (Id. § 437.)
Additionally, “[i]n response to a motion
to strike and before the case is at issue, a pleading shall not be amended more
than three times, absent an offer to the trial court of additional facts to be
pleaded that … would result in a reasonable possibility that the defect can be
cured.”  (Code Civ. Proc. §435.5, subd. (e).) 
            Here, Defendants argue that the
motion to strike the entire Complaint should be granted because Plaintiff is a
high frequency litigant and had an improper motive. (Motion to Strike, pp.
4-5.) Plaintiff argues that the Court should deny/overrule Defendants’ Motion
to Strike in its entirety or grant Plaintiff leave to amend to cure any such
deficiencies. (Opposition, p.8.) Since the Court overruled the Defendants’
demurrer as to all causes of actions, the Complaint in its entirety cannot be
stricken. Thus, the Motion to Strike will be denied.
Conclusion
Defendants Esperanza Molina and
Samantha L. Mejia’s Demurrer to Complaint is OVERRULED and the Motion to Strike
is DENIED.
