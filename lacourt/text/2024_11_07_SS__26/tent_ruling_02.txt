to Vacate Default and Default Judgment is DENIED.
 
 
                                                                                                                                
ANALYSIS:
 
On May 18, 2023, Plaintiff Don Kim (“Plaintiff”) filed the
instant action against Defendant Jake Perez (“Defendant”). Plaintiff filed
proof of personal service of the Summons and Complaint on September 20, 2023.
Following Defendant’s failure to file a responsive pleading, the Court entered
their default on November 22, 2023 and default judgment on December 7, 2023. 
 
Defendant filed the first Motion to Vacate Default and
Default Judgment (“the first Motion”) on June 12, 2024. Plaintiff filed an
opposition on August 2, 2024 and Plaintiff replied on August 8, 2024. Plaintiff
filed a supplemental declaration on August 13, 2024. At the hearing on August
15, 2024, the Court took the first Motion under submission following oral
argument from Plaintiff. (Minute Order, 08/15/24.) Thereafter, the Court denied
the first Motion. (Ibid.) 
 
On August 19, 2024, Defendant filed the instant, renewed
Motion to Vacate Default and Default Judgment (“the Renewed Motion”). Plaintiff
filed an opposition on September 3, 2024 and Defendant replied on September 9,
2024. At the hearing on September 16, 2024, the Court continued the matter for
further consideration of the declaration filed on August 19, 2024 and whether
the requirements for a renewed motion have been satisfied. 
 
Discussion
 
Defendant again moves to vacate the entry of default and
default judgment pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 473.5, or on
equitable grounds. (Renewed Motion, p. 2:2-8.) Despite acknowledging that this
is renewed motion, Defendant did not seek relief pursuant to the
reconsideration/renewal statute, Code of Civil Procedure section 1008. (Ibid.)
Code of Civil Procedure
section 1008, subdivision (a) states in relevant part:
 
When an application for an order has been made to a judge, or
to a court, and refused in whole or in part, or granted, or granted
conditionally, or on terms, any party affected by the order may, within 10 days
after service upon the party of written notice of entry of the order and based
upon new or different facts, circumstances, or law, make application to the
same judge or court that made the order, to reconsider the matter and modify,
amend, or revoke the prior order. The party making the application shall state
by affidavit what application was made before, when and to what judge, what
order or decisions were made, and what new or different facts, circumstances,
or law are claimed to be shown.
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1008, subd.
(a).) The Court lacks the jurisdiction to reconsider a prior ruling, on motion
of a party, where the motion does not comply with the requirements of Code of
Civil Procedure section 1008. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1008, subd. (e); Le
Francois v. Goel (2005) 35 Cal.4th 1094, 1106.) Additionally, there is a
diligence requirement: “Courts have construed section 1008 to require a party
filing an application for reconsideration or a renewed application to show
diligence with a satisfactory explanation for not having presented the new or
different information earlier.” (Even Zohar Construction & Remodeling,
Inc. v. Bellaire Townhouses, LLC (2015) 61 Cal.4th 830, 839.) 
 
The Court now finds that the instant
Renewed Motion does not comply with the statutory requirements for renewal.
Counsel’s declaration filed on August 19, 2024 does state what application was
made before and what order or decisions were made. (See Abbott Decl., ¶¶2, 9.)
However, it does not show what new or different facts, circumstances, or law
are claimed to be shown. The declaration refers to the failure of Plaintiff’s
counsel, Joyce Ma, to file a substitution of attorney despite changing law
firms. (Id. at ¶¶3-8.) This is not new information, however, as defense
counsel concedes it was pointed out to the Court in Defendant’s reply to the
first Motion to Vacate. (Id. at ¶9.) Defendant’s argument in the instant
Renewed Motion—that Plaintiff’s opposition to the first Motion to Vacate was
improper due to Attorney Ma’s failure to file a substitution of counsel—was
already raised. The Court was aware of the reply to the first Motion to Vacate
at the time it issued its ruling on August 15, 2024. (Minute Order, 08/15/24,
p. 2.) 
 
Furthermore, even if this argument
is considered new information, the Renewed Motion offers no legal authority to
show that Attorney Ma lacked standing to file an opposition to the first Motion
to Vacate. (Renewed Motion, p. 4:7-25.) The lack of standing argument is
premised on the idea that Attorney Ma was required to file a substitution of
attorney form upon changing law firms. No authority is cited for either proposition.
(Ibid.) Accordingly, the Court finds the requirements for a renewed
motion under Code of Civil Procedure section 1008 are not satisfied. 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant Jake Perez’s Renewed Motion to Vacate Default and
Default Judgment is DENIED.
 
 
Court clerk to give notice.
