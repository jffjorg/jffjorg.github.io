And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiffs' motion to compel arbitration and stay proceedings. The plaintiffs filed an action against the defendants in August 2024, and then filed a motion to compel arbitration in September 2024. However, the defendants have not filed a responsive pleading, and the plaintiffs have not shown that the court has jurisdiction to do anything other than enter the defendants' default. As a result, the court will enter the defendants' default, and the plaintiffs' motion to compel arbitration is denied.
