And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Philadelphia Indemnity Insurance Company's motion for judgment on the pleadings against Latrice Sprewell. The court has taken judicial notice of the admissions made by Sprewell in response to Plaintiff's Requests for Admission, which contradict Sprewell's general denial and affirmative defenses. The admissions establish that Sprewell failed to drive with reasonable care, was the sole cause of the accident, and caused Plaintiff's insured to incur damages. As a result, the court finds that judgment on the pleadings is appropriate against Sprewell. The plaintiff is ordered to file and serve a proposed judgment within 20 days of this order.
