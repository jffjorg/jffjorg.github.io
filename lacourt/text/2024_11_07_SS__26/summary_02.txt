And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Defendant Jake Perez's renewed motion to vacate default and default judgment. The motion was filed on August 19, 2024, and argues that Plaintiff's opposition to the first motion to vacate was improper due to Attorney Ma's failure to file a substitution of counsel. The judge found that the motion does not comply with the statutory requirements for a renewed motion under Code of Civil Procedure section 1008. Specifically, the motion does not show what new or different facts, circumstances, or law are claimed to be shown, and the argument about Attorney Ma's lack of standing to file an opposition was already raised in the first motion to vacate. The judge concluded that the requirements for a renewed motion under Code of Civil Procedure section 1008 are not satisfied.
