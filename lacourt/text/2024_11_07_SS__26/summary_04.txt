And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the plaintiff's motion to compel discovery responses and request for sanctions is denied. The motion is defective in several respects, including a defective proof of service, the combination of multiple motions into one, and the lack of attachment of discovery requests and proofs of service. The judge also notes that the motion fails to cite current legal authority in support of the requests to compel responses. The motion is denied without prejudice to the plaintiff correcting the defects and refiling the motion.
