And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for summary adjudication filed by the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs are seeking to have the court determine whether the defendants owed a duty under the CC&Rs (Declaration of Establishment of Basis Protective Restrictions, Limitations, Conditions, Covenants and Reservations) and whether the defendants breached that duty.

The judge has denied the motion to the extent that it seeks adjudication of the elements of breach and causation. The judge has determined that there are triable issues of material fact as to whether the defendants breached their duty of care under the CC&Rs, whether that breach resulted in the alleged water damage to the plaintiffs' property, and whether alternative sources within the plaintiffs' bathroom contributed to the claimed damage.

The judge has also denied the motion to the extent that it seeks to adjudicate the elements of breach and causation in relation to the 1st cause of action (breach of governing documents), the 2nd cause of action (nuisance), and the 3rd cause of action (negligence).
