 Case Number:  23LBCV00857    Hearing Date:   July 16, 2024    Dept:  S25 Procedural BackgroundOn May 10, 2023, Plaintiff filed a complaint against Defendant alleging she was struck by Defendant’s vehicle on October 6, 2022. (Compl., ¶ 4.) As a result of the incident, Plaintiff claims she suffered physical injuries, the loss of her use of her vehicle, and incurred hospital and medical expenses. On August 14, 2023, Defendant filed an answer.Defendant propounded deposition subpoena for production of business records from the City of Long Beach Department of Public Works. (Elsheikh Decl., ¶ 4, Exh. A.) The subpoena directed to seeks: THE RECORDS REQUESTED ARE regardless of date FOR THE FOLLOWING TYPES OF RECORDS: ANY AND ALL EMPLOYMENT RECORDS, WAGE RECORDS, PERSONNELRECORDS, ATTENDANCE RECORDS, EMPLOYMENT APPLICATIONS, W-2'5, W-4'5, CONTRACTS, 10991S, RESUMES, PAYROLL RECORDS, VACATION SCHEDULE, SICK LEAVE, LEAVE OF ABSENCE RECORDS, INSURANCE RECORDS, BENEFITS, EVALUATIONS AND ANY OTHER RECORDS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY RECORDS/DOCUMENTS THAT MAY BE STORED DIGITALLY AND/OR ELECTRONICALLY PERTAINING TO THE EMPLOYMENT OF ERIKKA BAILEY, DOB: 2/6/1988, SS#: XXX-XX-4308.On April 29, 2024, Plaintiff filed a motion to quash and stay deposition subpoena of business records for the City of Long Beach Department of Public Works. On July 3, 2024, Defendant filed an opposition. On July 8, 2024, Plaintiff filed a reply.Legal Standard“If a subpoena requires . . . the production of . . . documents . . . before a court, or at the trial of an issue therein, or at the taking of a deposition, the court, upon motion reasonably made by any person . . . may make an order quashing the subpoena entirely, modifying it, or directing compliance with it upon those terms and conditions as the court shall declare, including protective orders.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1987.1, subd. (a).) In California, discovery statutes “must be construed liberally in favor of disclosure unless the request is clearly improper.” (Williams v. Superior Court (2017) 3 Cal.5th 531, 541.) “Under the discovery statutes, information is discoverable if it is unprivileged and is either relevant to the subject matter of the action or reasonably calculated to reveal admissible evidence.” (John B. v.Superior Court (2006) 38 Cal.4th 1177, 1186.) “Discovery may relate to the claim or defense of the party seeking discovery or of any other party to the action.” (Ibid.)Meet and ConferThe Court finds that that the parties met and conferred.DiscussionAn individual’s employment records lie within that individual’s right to privacy. (See Board of Trustees v. Superior Court (1981) 119 Cal. App. 3d 516, 524-526 [disapproved only to the extent it assumes, without conducting proper inquiry, that a compelling interest or compelling need is automatically required.]) The right to privacy extends to one’s confidential financial affairs. (Valley Bank of Nevada v. Superior Court (1975) 15 Cal.3d 652, 656.) Also, W-2 forms and state and federal income tax returns are privileged. (See, Rev. & Tax. Code, § 19542; Webb v. Standard Oil (1957) 49 Cal.2d 509, 513; Schnabel v. Superior Court (1993) 5 Cal.4th 704, 719-723.)Plaintiff argues Defendant’s subpoena is overbroad and seeks documents that are protected by Plaintiff’s constitutional right to privacy. Specifically, the subpoena calls for confidential and protected information, e.g., Plaintiff’s entire personnel file, W-2 forms, and state and federal income tax returns. (See Webb v. Standard Oil (1957) 49 Cal. 2d 509, 513 [ruling that discoverability of tax returns by private litigants is privileged.])Defendant asserts such records will lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. Defendant concedes, however, that the subpoena is overbroad. Defendant offers to limit the scope of records sought starting with the date of the accident, however, suggests an end date for the subpoena cannot be determined as Defendant is unable to ascertain the exact dates when Plaintiff was unable to work and if Plaintiff took additional time off due to injuries following the January 2023 accident, which is not the subject of this lawsuit. (See Kashani Decl., ¶¶ 4, 5, Exh. A [Form Interrogatory Nos. 8.1- 8.8]; Exh. B [March 25, 2024 Deposition of Erikka Bailey] at 18:5-12, 20:5-11.) Defendant seeks W-2 forms as well as state and federal income tax returns to obtain information pertaining to Plaintiff’s wages.The Court finds that Defendant’s subpoena is overbroad. There is no basis for the disclosure of ALL of Plaintiff’s employment records, placing no restrictions as to time, and requesting privileged W-2 forms and tax returns. (See Elsheikh Decl., ¶ 4, Exh. A.) While Defendant states a willingness to limit the scope of records sought in terms of time, there are other avenues to obtain that information. As suggested by Plaintiff’s counsel, information concerning wages received by Plaintiff and days of work missed due to this incident (October 6, 2022) and unrelated January 2023 accident could be propounded via written discovery. Plaintiff, of course, must respond to these requests sufficiently and provide the requested documentation. Plaintiff’s vague responses in her deposition ashow long she could not work or when she returned to work are deficient. (See Opposition, Ex. B (20:5-6; 20:7-11). If Plaintiff is unable to provide substantive responses, the Court would likely permit Defendant to seek that information through a more narrowly tailored subpoena on Plaintiff’s employer. The Court strongly encourages the parties to resolve requests for certain types of discovery informally.Tentative RulingPlaintiff’s Motion to Quash and Stay Deposition Subpoena of Business Records for City Long Beach Department of Public Works is GRANTED.Plaintiff Erikka Bailey’s Motion to Quash and Stay Deposition Subpoena of Business Records for National General Insurance CompanyProcedural BackgroundOn May 10, 2023, Plaintiff filed a complaint against Defendant alleging she was struck by Defendant’s vehicle on October 6, 2022. (Compl., ¶ 4.) As a result of the incident, Plaintiff claims she suffered physical injuries, the loss of her use of her vehicle, and incurred hospital and medical expenses. On August 14, 2023, Defendant filed an answer.On December 6, 2023, Judge Mark Kim granted Plaintiff’s prior motion to quash Defendant’s deposition subpoena for production of business records from Farmers Insurance Exchange and National General Insurance Company on the basis that Plaintiff has a right to privacy and insurance companies are barred from disclosure under Insurance Code, § 791.13. (December 6, 2023 Minute Order.)Subsequently, Defendant propounded deposition subpoena for production of business records from National General Insurance Company. (Elsheikh Decl., ¶ 4, Exh. A.) The subpoena directed to National General Insurance Company seeks: ANY AND ALL MEDICAL RECORDS RELATED TO DATE OF LOSS 1/18/2023, CLAIM NUMBER 230054375, POLICY NUMBER: 2017277042, RELATING TO THE FOLLOWING BODY PARTS: NECK, BACK AND LEFT SHOULDER, PERTAINING TO ERIKKA BAILEY, DOB: 2/6/1988, SS#: XXX-XX-4308. TO INCLUDE XRAYS, PATHOLOGY REPORTS, SIGN-IN SHEETS, BILLING RECORDS, BILLING R&N RECORDS, PHARMACY/PRESCRIPTION RECORDS AND INSURANCE RECORDS. (Ibid.)On April 29, 2024, Plaintiff filed a motion to quash and stay deposition subpoena of business records for National General Insurance Company. On July 3, 2024, Defendant filed an opposition. On July 8, 2024, Plaintiff filed a reply.Legal Standard“If a subpoena requires . . . the production of . . . documents . . . before a court, or at the trial of an issue therein, or at the taking of a deposition, the court, upon motion reasonably made by any person . . . may make an order quashing the subpoena entirely, modifying it, or directing compliance with it upon those terms and conditions as the court shall declare,including protective orders.” (Code Civ.

(Valley Bank of Nevada v. Superior Court (1975) 15 Cal.3d 652, 656.) Also, W-2 forms and state and federal income tax returns are privileged. (See, Rev. & Tax. Code, § 19542; Webb v. Standard Oil (1957) 49 Cal.2d 509, 513; Schnabel v. Superior Court (1993) 5 Cal.4th 704, 719-723.)Ins. Code, § 791.13, “prohibits an insurance company or its agents from disclosing any personal or privileged information about an individual collected or received in connection with an insurance transaction unless the disclosure is . . . [w]ith the written authorization of the individual . . . obtained one year or less prior to the date a disclosure is sought.” (Mead Reinsurance Co. v. Superior Court (1986) 188 Cal.App.3d 313, 321.) Privileged information “means any individually identifiable information that both: (1) Relates to a claim for insurance benefits or a civil or criminal proceeding involving an individual . . . [and] (2) Is collected in connection with or in reasonable anticipation of a claim for insurance benefits.” (Ins. Code, § 791.02, subd. (v)(1)-(2).) Personal information is defined as “any individually identifiable information gathered in connection with an insurance transaction from which judgments can be made about an individual’s character, habits, avocations, finances, occupation, general reputation, credit, health, or any other personal characteristics.” (Ins. Code, § 791.02, subd. (s).)Plaintiff argues Defendant’s subpoena is overbroad and seeks documents that are protected by Plaintiff’s constitutional right to privacy. Moreover, Plaintiff contends Ins. Code, § 791.13 as well as Judge Kim’s December 6, 2023 ruling, supports her position.Defendant asserts such records will lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. Defendant proclaims that the subpoena is narrowly construed and relates only to injuriesto Plaintiff’s head, neck and back as a result of the January 18, 2023 accident. (See Kashani Decl., ¶¶ 4, 5, Exh. B [March 25, 2024 Deposition of Erikka Bailey] at 30:14-23, 32:9-25, Exh. C [Form Interrogatory Nos. 10.3, 11.1].) Again, Defendant commits to limiting the subpoena to medical records and bills - conceding all property damage information is not relevant to this lawsuit and will not seek disclosure of such documents. (Opposition at p. 3:10-12.) Defendant makes no argument as to Ins. Code, § 791.13, and its statutory bar on an insurance company’s disclosure of personal or privileged information about an insurer without the insurer’s authorization.As stated in Judge Kim’s prior ruling, Plaintiff’s medical and billing records are relevant to the defense in this action, however, disclosure of such medical and billing records are barred under Ins. Code, § 791.13. However, as Defendant suggests, such subpoena may not be needed if Plaintiff provided the requested information in her response to Form Interrogatory Nos. 10.3 or 11.1. (See Kashani Decl., ¶ 5, Exh. C.)The Court strongly encourages the parties to resolve their discovery disputes informally by providing requested information in support of their claims or defenses.Tentative RulingPlaintiff’s Motion to Quash and Stay Deposition Subpoena of Business Records for National General Insurance Company is GRANTED.
