And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the motion for determination of good faith settlement submitted by Defendant San Fiesta, which settled with Plaintiff for $12,500.00. The settlement is contingent upon the entry of a final order from the Court granting Defendant San Fiesta's motion. The judge finds that Defendant San Fiesta has met its burden of showing that the settlement was made in good faith, as it has presented evidence that the settlement amount is within the ballpark of its liability for the plaintiff's injuries. The judge notes that the settlement was reached following arm's length negotiations during mediation and that there is no evidence of hidden terms, collusion, fraud, or misleading conduct meant to harm the interests of the non-settling parties.
