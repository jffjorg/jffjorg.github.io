And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the Plaintiff's motion to compel deposition of Defendant's Person Most Knowledgeable (PMK) with production of documents and monetary sanctions is proper. The Plaintiff argues that the Defendant failed to respond to the deposition notice and meet and confer attempts, and that the Defendant's counsel was deemed not eligible to practice law in California by the State Bar. The Judge notes that the Defendant's counsel, Vicent Quigg, was deemed not eligible to practice law in California as of March 30, 2024, and that it is unclear whether the client, AVA Auto Sales, has any knowledge of counsel's inability to practice law or this pending motion. The Judge sets a continued hearing for August 15, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. and orders that notice of the continued hearing and this ruling be sent to AVA Auto Sales.
