 Case Number:  23LBCV01603    Hearing Date:   July 16, 2024    Dept:  S25 BackgroundOn August 24, 2023, Plaintiff filed a form complaint against Defendants AVA Auto Sales, Inc. and Does 1 to 20, alleging general negligence, premises liability and strict liability for dog attack. Plaintiff alleges that on October 17, 2021 at 6432 Long Beach Blvd. in the City of Long Beach (the “premises”), he was attacked and chased by an off-leashed dog while on the premises. (Compl., p. 4.) On October 10, 2023, Defendant filed an answer. On June 11, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant motion to compel deposition of Defendant’s person most knowledgeable with production of documents and monetary sanctions. As of July 10, 2024, no opposition has been filed.Legal Standard“The service of a deposition notice…is effective to require any deponent who is a party to the action…to attend and to testify, as well as to produce any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing for inspection and copying.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.280, subd. (a).)“If, after service of a deposition notice, a party to the action or an officer, director, managing agent, or employee of a party, or a person designated by an organization that is a party under Section 2025.230, without having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails to appear for examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for inspection any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move for an order compelling the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the production for inspection of any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the deposition notice.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (a).) “The motion shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040, or, when the deponent fails to attend the deposition and produce the documents, electronically stored information, or things described in the deposition notice, by a declaration stating that the petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire about the nonappearance.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (b)(2).)“If a deponent fails to answer any question or to produce any document… under the deponent’s control that is specified in the deposition notice or a deposition subpoena, the party seeking discovery may move the court for an order compelling that answer or production.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.480, subd. (a).) Monetary sanctions are mandatory against an unsuccessful moving or opposing party unless they acted with substantial justification or imposition of sanctions would be unjust. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (g)(1).)Meet and ConferOn April 30, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel served by email to Defendant’s counsel a first amended notice of taking the Deposition of Defendant’s Person Most Knowledge (“PMK”) with Requests for Production, with the deposition scheduled for June 6, 2024 at 10:00 am. (Gerome Decl., ¶ 4, Exh. B.) Plaintiff counsel asserts no response was provided by Defense counsel and Plaintiff counsel followed up on June 3, 2024 with a second email to confirm the deposition. (Gerome Decl., ¶¶ 6, 7.) Defendant’s counsel again failed to respond to the second email and Plaintiff’s counsel called Defense counsel’s office, speaking to numerous employees who could not confirm whether the witness would be produced for the deposition. (Gerome Decl., ¶¶ 7, 8.) When neither defense counsel nor any witness appeared for the June 6, 2024 deposition, Plaintiff’s counsel called again but was unable to reach Defense counsel. (Gerome Decl., ¶ 8.) Plaintiff has fulfilled the meet and confer requirements.DiscussionPlaintiff argues that the instant motion is proper because (1) Defendant never responded to Plaintiff’s first amended notice of taking deposition of Defendant’s PMK with Requests for Production; (2) Defendant did not serve an objection to the first amended deposition notice; and (3) Defendant is not responding to Plaintiff’s attempts to meet and confer about the non-appearance. Plaintiff references the scheduled June 6, 2024 date on the first amended deposition notice as well as Plaintiff counsel’s multiple attempts to meet and confer with Defense counsel. (See Gerome Decl., ¶¶ 4, 6-8, Exh. B.) Plaintiff asks for $1,260.00 in monetary sanctions to be awarded to it against Defendant. Plaintiff argues that Defendant’s failure to respond to meet and confer attempts and refusal to comply with deposition notice constitutes misuse of the discovery process.Tentative RulingAs of March 30, 2024, defense counsel, Vicent Quigg, was deemed not eligible to practice law in California by the State Bar. Accordingly, no response from defense counsel is explainable. It is unclear whether the client, AVA Auto Sales, has any knowledge of counsel’s inability to practice law or this pending motion. On its own motion, the court continues Plaintiff’s motion to August 15, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. and will send notice of the continued hearing and this ruling to AVA Auto Sales.
