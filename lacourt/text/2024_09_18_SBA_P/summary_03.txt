And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled in favor of the motion to quash the service of the complaint filed by the County of Los Angeles. The County argued that the "Children and Family Services County of LA" is not a suable entity and that the purported service efforts are not effective as to any defendant. The other defendants joining in the motion also argued that the purported service efforts are not effective as to any defendant. The judge found that none of the proofs of service filed by the plaintiff show service of the summons and complaint on any defendant, and therefore, no defendant has been properly served. The judge also found that the plaintiff failed to oppose the motion and has not met her burden of showing that service was proper. As a result, the motion to quash the service of the complaint is granted.
