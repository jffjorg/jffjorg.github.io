 [TENTATIVE] RULING RE:
Defendants Rogelio
  Quezada and Erika Rivera’s Demurrer to Complaint.



 
I. Background
A. Pleadings
Plaintiff Paula Quezada
sues Defendants Rogelio Quezada (ex-spouse), Erika Rivera (Rogelio Quezada’s
girlfriend), Samuel Quezada (Rogelio Quezada’s brother), and Does 1 through 100
pursuant to a February 1, 2021, Second Amended Complaint (SAC) alleging claims
of: (1) Fraudulent Conveyance and (2) Conspiracy to Engage in Fraudulent
Conveyance against Rogelio Quezada and Erika Rivera; and (3) Fraud and (4)
Constructive Fraud against Samuel Quezada (constructive fraud inoperative based
on Jul. 22, 2021 ruling).
(The Court refers to
the parties by their first name based on the shared surname between many of the
parties. No disrespect is intended.)
The claims against
Rogelio and Erika arise from the following allegations.
Paula and Rogelio were
married for over 20 years.
On March 17, 2017, the
Los Angeles Superior Court issued a dissolution judgment for Paula and Rogelio.
As part of that judgment, the Superior Court awarded Paula full ownership of
the real property known as 3902 Santa Ana Street, South Gate, California 90280.
(The dissolution judgment is not attached to the SAC, though it was attached to
Plaintiff’s First Amended Complaint (FAC). A review of that judgment shows that
Paula was specifically awarded the former married couple’s community property
interest in the subject property, not “full ownership” over the property or
some similar language, as alleged in the SAC. However, because the SAC does not
clarify whether anyone beyond Paula and Rogelio owned an interest in the
subject property at the time of Paula and Rogelio’s dissolution, and because
the SAC alleges Paula’s full ownership of the property, the Court reads the SAC
as involving a judgment that conveyed Paula and Rogelio’s full community
property interest in the subject property to Paula, where the community’s
interest in the property was in fee simple, i.e., 100% ownership.)
Nevertheless, following
the judgment, Rogelio undertook several actions in violation of the March 17,
2017, judgment. Rogelio first caused the property to be transferred to a “Maria
Benitez,” who did not pay any consideration for the transfer and whose identity
is not otherwise elaborated in the pleadings. Rogelio caused this transfer to
be made to defraud Paula of the benefits and rights of the dissolution
judgment. Thereafter, Rogelio prepared all the paperwork so that Maria could
obtain a loan on the subject property. Maria was unaware that the loan was
being obtained in her name. On January 25, 2017, Maria obtained a $350,000 loan
that was secured by the property. Next, on January 26, 2017, Rogelio induced
Maria to transfer $98,894.41 of those monies from Maria’s personal account to
an account owned by Erika, Rogelio’s girlfriend at the time the SAC was filed.
Erika assisted Rogelio in taking these actions.
In relation to the
first and second causes of action—the claims stated against Rogelio and Erika, which
are based on the above allegations—Paula prays for, among other things, costs, an
order setting aside the conveyance of $98,894.41 from Maria to Erika, orders
restraining further conveyances of the $98,894.41 transferred by Maria to Erika,
and other relief deemed just and proper. However, the prayer does not seek an
order setting aside the conveyance of the subject property from Rogelio to
Maria or restraining further conveyances of the subject property.
B. Prior Procedural
History
On February 1, 2021, Paula
filed a proof of service purporting to reflect service of the SAC and its
summons on Rogelio, Erika, and Samuel on February 1, 2021. However, the proof
of service reflects the February 1, 2021, service of the SAC and its summons on
David D. Mortiel, counsel for Samuel Quezada. Rogelio, Erika, and Samuel are
not named in the proof of service itself. The Court notes that it appears David
Mortiel has only ever represented Samuel in this action, according to the file.
On March 8, 2021,
Samuel filed a demurrer and motion to strike against the SAC’s third and fourth
causes of action for fraud and constructive fraud, based on claims that Samuel induced
Plaintiff not to litigate title to another property (on Alameda Street) in the
dissolution case because Samuel was on title to that property.
On March 30, 2021,
Paula filed an updated proof of service for Samuel.
On April 1, 2021, the
Court held an order to show cause hearing, at which time the Court noted that
proof of service as to Rogelio and Erika had not been filed.
On July 20, 2021,
Samuel filed a notice of non-opposition by Paula to Samuel’s demurrer and
Samuel’s motion to strike.
On July 22, 2021, Rogelio
and Erika filed a notice of bankruptcy.
That same day, the
Court held a hearing at which the Court noted its receipt of Rogelio and
Erika’s notice of bankruptcy. Based on that filing, the Court stayed this
action as to Rogelio and Erika. The Court also ruled on Samuel’s October 26,
2020, demurrer and motion to strike, overruling the demurrer and denying the
motion to strike as to the SAC’s third cause of action, and sustaining the
demurrer and granting the motion to strike as to the SAC’s fourth cause of
action. No leave to amend was mentioned in the Court’s order, and Plaintiff did
not file an amended pleading in response to the order.
On August 5, 2021,
Samuel filed an answer to the SAC.
Between January 2022
and January 2024, the Court held a number of status conferences regarding
Rogelio and Erika’s then-ongoing bankruptcy proceedings.
C. Motion Before the
Court and Subsequent Procedural History
On January 11, 2024,
Rogelio and Erika—in pro per—filed a demurrer to the SAC’s four causes of
action, only the first two of which are alleged against them, and the fourth of
which is no longer operative. The demurrer attaches a proof of service showing
service of the demurrer on Paula’s counsel by mail on January 11, 2024, though the
proof of service left two locations blank: a line following the date of “January
11, 2024”; and a line relating to the California city from which the demurrer
was mailed to Paula’s counsel.
On January 25, 2024,
the Court held a status conference regarding Rogelio and Erika’s bankruptcy
proceedings. Only counsel for Paula and counsel for Samuel attended this
hearing. Rogelio and Erika did not make any appearances, either in their own
person or through counsel. At the hearing, counsel for Paula and counsel for
Samuel both represented that the bankruptcy proceedings had been resolved as of
that date. Based on those representations, the Court took the status conference
regarding bankruptcy off calendar although the Court’s order did not explicitly
lift the July 22, 2021 stay in this action as to Rogelio and Erika.
Counsel for Plaintiff also agreed that Rogelio had not been served with the SAC
as of January 25, 2024. 
No opposition by Paula
appears in the record despite Paula’s counsel acknowledging Rogelio’s pending
demurrer at the January 25, 2024, hearing.
Neither does the record
reflect a reply or notice of non-opposition.
Rogelio and Erika’s
demurrer is now before the Court.
 
II. Stay as to Rogelio Quezada and Erika Rivera
Based on the resolution of their
bankruptcy proceedings, the Court LIFTS the July 22, 2021, stay in this action
as to Rogelio and Erika.
 
III. Demurrer
A.
Note - Timeliness
A
person against whom a complaint or cross-complaint has been filed may, within
30 days after service of the complaint or cross-complaint, demur to the
complaint or cross-complaint. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.40, subd. (a).)
Here,
the record is clear in showing that the SAC and its summons were never served
on Rogelio and Erika in this action.
However,
Rogelio and Erika’s July 22, 2021, notice of bankruptcy, and their demurrer now
before the Court, constitute a general appearance for the purposes of
timeliness in demurrer. This is because a defendant makes a general appearance
when he takes any part in the action or proceeding. (Creed v. Schultz
(1983) 148 Cal.App.3d 733, 740; see Roy v. Superior Court (2005) 127
Cal.App.4th 337, 341 [“A defendant who has not yet answered has been held to
have made a general appearance … if he invokes the authority of the court on
his behalf, or affirmatively seeks relief”].) A general appearance by a party
is equivalent to personal service of summons on such party. (Renoir v.
Redstar Corp. (2004) 123 Cal.App.4th 1145, 1149-1150.)
As
such, the 30-day clock for Rogelio or Erika to demur to the SAC would have been
triggered as of at least July 22, 2021, but for the Court staying this action
as to Rogelio and Erika that same day. That stay was not lifted until the date
of this order, as discussed in Section II above. It therefore follows that
Rogelio and Erika filed their demurrer within 30 days of the stay being lifted,
i.e., filed on January 11, 2024. And though Rogelio and Erika filed their
demurrer during a stay, counsel for Plaintiff and counsel for Defendant Samuel
Quezada clarified on January 25, 2024, that Rogelio and Erika’s bankruptcy
proceedings had concluded by that date, with Plaintiff Paula Quezada’s counsel
recognizing that Rogelio and Erika’s demurrer was on calendar.
The
Court thus proceeds with a discussion of Rogelio and Erika’s demurrer.
B.
Legal Standard
A
demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the complaint states a cause of action.
(Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747; see Code Civ. Proc., §
430.10, subd. (e).)
To
sufficiently allege a cause of action, a complaint must allege all the ultimate
facts—that is, the facts needed to establish each element of the cause of
action pleaded. (Committee on Children’s Television, Inc. v. General Foods
Corp. (1983) 35 Cal.3d 197, 212, superseded by statute as stated in Branick
v. Downey Savings & Loan Assn. (2006) 39 Cal.4th 235, 242.) “[E]ach
evidentiary fact that might eventually form part of the plaintiff’s proof need
not be alleged.” (C.A. v. William S. Hart Union High School Dist. (2012)
53 Cal.4th 861, 872.)
In
testing the sufficiency of the cause of action, the demurrer admits the truth
of all material facts properly pleaded. (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital Dist.
(1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 966-67.) Courts read the allegations liberally and in
context. (Taylor v. City of Los Angeles Dept. of Water and Power (2006)
144 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1228, disapproved on other grounds, Jones v. Lodge at
Torrey Pines Partnership (2008) 42 Cal.4th 1158, 1162.) A demurrer,
however, “does not admit contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or
law.” (Daar v. Yellow Cab Co. (1967) 67 Cal.2d 695, 713.) 
C.
Analysis

1. Demurrer,
SAC, First Cause of Action, Fraudulent Conveyance: OVERRULED.
a. Relevant
Law 
i. Statutory
Law
In California, a fraudulent
conveyance under the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act (UFTA) involves “a
transfer by the debtor of property to a third person undertaken with the intent
to prevent a creditor from reaching that interest to satisfy its claim.” (Filip
v. Bucurenciu (2005) 129 Cal.App.4th 825, 829 (Filip).) A transfer
under the UFTA is fraudulent as to a creditor if the debtor made the transfer
with actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud any creditor of the debtor.
(Civ. Code, § 3439.04, subd. (a); Filip, supra, at p. 829.)
To find a transfer voidable as to a
creditor, the transfer by the debtor must be made with actual intent to hinder,
delay, or defraud the creditor of the debtor. (Civ. Code, § 3439.04, subd. (a).)
Some factors that may be considered in determining actual intent are: (1)
whether the transfer or obligation was to an insider; (2) whether the debtor
retained possession or control of the property transferred after the transfer;
(3) whether the transfer or obligation was disclosed or concealed; (4) whether
before the transfer was made or obligation was incurred, the debtor had been
sued or threatened with suit; (5) whether the transfer was of substantially all
the debtor’s assets; (6) whether the debtor absconded; (7) whether the debtor
removed or concealed assets; (8) whether the value of the consideration
received by the debtor was reasonably equivalent to the value of the asset
transferred or the amount of the obligation incurred; (9) whether the debtor
was insolvent or became insolvent shortly after the transfer was made or the
obligation was incurred; (10) whether the transfer occurred shortly before or
shortly after a substantial debt was incurred; and (11) whether the debtor
transferred the essential assets of the business to a lienor that transferred
the assets to an insider of the debtor. (Civ. Code, § 3439.04, subd. (b).)  
A “debtor” is a person that is
liable on a claim. (Civ. Code, § 3439.01, subd. (e).)
A “claim” means a right to payment,
whether or not it has been reduced to judgment. (Civ. Code, § 3439.01, subd. (b).)
Whether the conveyance was indeed
made with fraudulent intent requires an evidentiary finding and is thus more
proper on summary judgment. (See Filip, supra, 129 Cal.App.4th at 834.)
ii. Common Law
A cause of action for fraudulent
transfer may be brought under the UFTA or common law. (See Husky Internat.
Electronics, Inc. v. Ritz (2016) 136 S.Ct. 1581, 1587 (Husky Int’l);
Macedo v. Bosio (2001) 86 Cal.App.4th 1044, 1051.) A fraudulent transfer
does not require a misrepresentation from a debtor to a creditor. (See Husky
Int’l, supra, at p. 1597.) “Fraudulent conveyances typically involve ‘a
transfer to a close relative, a secret transfer, a transfer of title without
transfer of possession, or grossly inadequate consideration.’” (Ibid., quoting
BFP v. Resolution Trust Corp. (1994) 511 U.S. 531, 540-541.)  
b. Court’s
Determination 
After review, the Court finds in
favor of Plaintiff Paula Quezada.
The SAC alleges that after Rogelio
ceased to own any interest in the subject property, he executed a conveyance of
the subject property from himself to Maria Benitez, who did not pay any
consideration for the transfer and whose connection to the parties in this
action is unclear. (SAC, ¶¶ 8-9, 13.) The SAC also alleges that Rogelio next
prepared paperwork for Maria to obtain a $350,000 loan on the subject property,
which was successfully secured despite Maria not being aware that the loan was
being made in her name, and with Rogelio later inducing Maria to transfer $98,894.41
to Erika (Rogelio’s girlfriend). (SAC, ¶¶ 10-12, 13.) Last, the SAC alleges
that Erika knowingly helped Rogelio with these actions. (SAC, ¶ 18.)
These allegations state
a fraudulent conveyance of real property by Rogelio to Maria because the SAC alleges
that the real property belonged to Paula at the time of Rogelio’s transfer to Maria.
Moreover, these allegations state a fraudulent conveyance of $98,894.41 by
Maria to Erika, as induced by Rogelio with Erika’s help, because the $98,894.41
were secured by Maria through a loan on the subject property, which was
fraudulently conveyed to her by Rogelio for no consideration.
Moreover, whether
the conveyance was indeed made with fraudulent intent requires an evidentiary
finding and thus should not be resolved except in the extraordinary case by a
motion directed at the pleadings. (See Filip, supra, 129 Cal.App.4th at
834.)
Rogelio and Erika’s
demurrer is thus OVERRULED as to the SAC’s first cause of action.
The Court notes, however, that the
SAC’s prayer only seeks to void the transfer of $98,894.41 and orders
related to those monies. (SAC, ¶¶ 1-14; see 17-18 [costs; other relief deemed
proper].) The prayer does not seek to void the transfer of the subject property
from Rogelio to Maria or further orders relating to the subject property.
2. Demurrer,
SAC, First Cause of Action, Conspiracy to Engage in Fraudulent Conveyance: SUSTAINED,
without leave to amend [caveat below].
a. Relevant
Law 
“Civil conspiracy is not an
independent tort. Instead, it is ‘a legal doctrine that imposes liability on
persons who, although not actually committing a tort themselves, share with the
immediate tortfeasors a common plan or design in its perpetration. [Citation.]
By participation in a civil conspiracy, a coconspirator effectively adopts as
his or her own the torts of other coconspirators within the ambit of the
conspiracy. [Citation.] In this way, a coconspirator incurs tort liability
co-equal with the immediate tortfeasors.” (City of Industry v. City of
Fillmore (2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 191, 211-212 (City of Industry), quoting
Applied Equipment Corp. v. Litton Saudi Arabia Ltd. (1994) 7 Cal.4th
503, 510-511; see, e.g., City of Industry, supra, at p. 212
[“constru[ing] the fifth count for fraud and the tenth count for conspiracy
together as a single count for fraud”].)
b. Court’s
Determination 
Conspiracy is not a cause of action
in the State of California. (City of Industry, supra, 198
Cal.App.4th at p. 212.)
Rogelio and Erika’s demurrer is
thus SUSTAINED as to the SAC’s second cause of action, without leave to amend.
However, the Court grants Paula
leave to reallege any conspiracy grounds against Defendants in a subsequent
pleading filed by Paula as a result of this order.
3. Demurrer,
SAC, Third and Fourth Causes of Action, Fraud and Constructive Fraud: NULL.
Here, the Court determines that
Rogelio and Erika’s demurrer is NULL as to the SAC’s third and fourth causes of
action, which are only alleged against Samuel Quezada. Therefore, Rogelio and
Erika have no standing to file a demurrer as to these claims.
The Court also notes that the Court
sustained a demurrer to the fourth cause of action on July 22, 2021. Because
Plaintiff did not file an amended pleading following the July 22, 2021, order,
the fourth cause of action has ceased to function as an operative claim in this
lawsuit. 
IV. Conclusion
Defendants Rogelio Quezada and Erika Rivera’s Demurrer to Complaint is:
(1) OVERRULED as to the Second Amended Complaint’s first cause of action;
(2) SUSTAINED, without leave to
amend, as to the Second Amended Complaint’s second cause of action with the
caveat that Plaintiff Paula Quezada may, in a subsequent pleading filed as a
result of this order, reallege her conspiracy grounds against Defendants
outside of a stated count (otherwise incorrectly referred to as a cause of
action); and
(3) NULL as to the Second Amended
Complaint’s third and fourth causes of action, which are only alleged against
Defendant Samuel Quezada.
