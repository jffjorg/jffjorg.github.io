Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the demurrer filed by Rogelio Quezada and Erika Rivera to the Second Amended Complaint. The demurrer was filed on January 11, 2024, and the judge has considered the allegations in the complaint and the demurrer.

The judge finds that the first cause of action, alleging fraudulent conveyance, is viable and overrules the demurrer. The judge also finds that the second cause of action, alleging conspiracy to engage in fraudulent conveyance, is not viable and sustains the demurrer. The judge notes that the third and fourth causes of action, alleged against Samuel Quezada, are not applicable in this case and are null.

The judge also notes that the Court had previously sustained a demurrer to the fourth cause of action on July 22, 2021, and since Plaintiff did not file an amended pleading, the fourth cause of action is no longer operative.

The judge concludes that the demurrer filed by Rogelio and Erika is OVERRULED as to the first cause of action, SUSTAINED as to the second cause of action without leave to amend, and NULL as to the third and fourth causes of action.
