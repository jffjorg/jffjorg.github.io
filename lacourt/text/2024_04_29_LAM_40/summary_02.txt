And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses a motion to strike certain portions of the plaintiff's first amended complaint. The plaintiff, Daniel Stevenson, sued the defendants, Louise Voyazis and Louise Voyazis Interior Design, LLC, for breach of contract, fraud, and other claims arising from the defendants' alleged failure to perform design and project management services for the plaintiff's new home. The defendants moved to strike the plaintiff's second and third causes of action, alleging that these claims were duplicative and insufficiently pleaded. The judge denied the motion to strike these claims, finding that they were not duplicative and sufficiently pleaded.

The judge also denied the defendants' motion to strike the plaintiff's allegation of punitive damages, finding that the alleged fraudulent misrepresentations by the defendants were sufficient to support a claim for punitive damages.

Finally, the judge granted the defendants' motion to strike the plaintiff's request for attorney's fees, finding that the plaintiff's complaint did not adequately plead a contract providing for attorney's fees. The judge gave the plaintiff leave to amend its complaint to cure this deficiency.
