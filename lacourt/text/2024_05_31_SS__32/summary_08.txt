```

And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants the defendant's motion to compel the plaintiff's attendance at deposition. The plaintiff failed to appear for the deposition on February 6, 2024, and did not file an opposition to the motion. The defendant served two deposition notices, and the plaintiff did not provide alternative dates for the deposition. The judge finds that the plaintiff failed to provide a valid objection to the deposition and therefore grants the motion to compel. The judge also awards the defendant $250 in monetary sanctions for the court reporter's no-show fee. The plaintiff is ordered to appear for a remote deposition on a mutually convenient date and time on or before June 20, 2024.
