Motion
  to Compel Defendant Shayon Stamper’s Deposition




MOVING PARTY:


Plaintiff Kysean Ferreira 




OPPOSING PARTY:


Defendants
  Long Beach Unified School District, Shayon Stamper, Virginia Divers, Jason

MOTION
 
            Plaintiff
Kysean Ferreira (“Plaintiff”) moves to compel the deposition of Defendant
Shayon Stamper (“Stamper”), which started on April 18, 2024, and unilaterally
ended after the lunch break. Defendants Long Beach Unified School District,
Shayon Stamper, Virginia Divers, Jason Heesch, and Saul Hernandez
(“Defendants”) oppose and Plaintiff replies. 
 
BACKGROUND
 
On May 25, 2022,
Plaintiff Kysean Ferreira (“Plaintiff”), a minor through his guardian ad litem,
filed a complaint against Long Beach Unified School District, Shayon Stamper
Virginia Divers, Jason Heesch, Saul Hernandez, and Does 1 to 20.  
 
On June 1, 2022,
Plaintiff filed a first amended complaint (“FAC”).  
 
On July 28,
2022, Long Beach Unified School District filed a notice of removal to
federal court. According to the federal court docket for this case, the parties
stipulated to dismiss Plaintiff’s federal cause of action and Judge Josephine
L. Staton ordered Plaintiff to file an amended pleading. (See (Notice of
Remand, filed 3/6/23, page 6.) On February 24, 2023, Plaintiff filed a second
amended complaint (“SAC”).  
 
On February 27, 2023, the action was remanded to the
Superior Court. (Notice of Remand, filed 3/6/23.)  
 
On July 12, 2023, the Court held a trial setting conference,
scheduling the jury trial for May 9, 2024. All discovery and pre-trial motion
cut-off dates were associated with the trial date. (Min. Order, 7/12/23.) 
 
On April 24, 2024, the Court denied Plaintiff’s ex parte application
to continue trial and reopen discovery. The Court observed that no motion to
reopen discovery was filed. However, in light of the then-pending motion for
judgment on the pleadings, the Court continued trial to May 23, 2024. All
discovery remained closed and the pre-trial motion cut off remained in effect.
(Min. Order, 4/24/24.) 
 
On April 30, 2024, Plaintiff filed a motion to reopen discovery,
currently scheduled for July 19, 2024. 
 
On May 3, 2024, the Court granted in part, Plaintiff’s ex parte
application to continue trial and reopen discovery, by continuing trial from
May 23, 2024 to August 23, 2024. The order specified that “all discovery and
pre-trial motion cut off dates shall be associated with the previous trial date
unless otherwise stipulated by the parties or otherwise ordered by the Court.”
(Min. Order, 5/3/24.) 
 
LEGAL
STANDARD 
 
“If, after service of a deposition notice, a party to the
action . . . , without having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410,
fails to appear for examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for
inspection any document . . . described in the deposition notice, the party
giving the notice may move for an order compelling the deponent’s attendance
and testimony, and the production for inspection of any document . . .
described in the deposition notice.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (a).) 
 
“A motion under subdivision (a) [above] shall comply with
both of the following: 
 
1. The motion
shall set forth specific facts showing good cause justifying the production for
inspection of any document, electronically stored information, or tangible
thing described in the deposition notice. 
2. The motion
shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040,
or, when the deponent fails to attend the deposition and produce the documents,
electronically stored information, or things described in the deposition
notice, by a declaration stating that the petitioner has contacted the deponent
to inquire about the nonappearance.” 
 
(Code Civ.
Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (b).) 
 
If a motion is granted, the court shall impose a monetary
sanction in favor of that party unless the court finds that the one subject to
the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances
make the sanction unjust. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2025.450 (g).)
 
MEET
AND CONFER
 
The Declaration of Kyle Scott, Plaintiff’s counsel, shows that he
attempted to discuss Stamper’s non-appearance with Defendants’ counsel after
the lunch break, and to procure his attendance. (Scott Decl. ¶ 6.) Therefore,
the meet and confer requirement has been met. 
 
DISCUSSION
 
This case arises out of an alleged battery by Stamper on Plaintiff at
Perry Lindsey Academy on October 5, 2021. Plaintiff noticed Stamper’s
deposition on March 1, 2024, scheduled for March 14, 2024. (Scott Decl. ¶ 2.)
Stamper filed an objection based on unavailability. (Exh. 2.) The parties met
and conferred. On April 15, 2024, Plaintiff requested deposition dates.
According to Plaintiff, Defendants asserted that Stamper’s deposition could
take place on April 18, 2024. (Id. ¶ 5.) As a result, on April 18, 2024,
Stamper’s remote deposition began at 10:00 a.m. The parties took a 30-minute
lunch break at 1:37 p.m. When the lunchbreak ended and the parties resumed,
Stamper was not present. Defendants’ counsel asserted that Stamper was no
longer available. 
 
In opposition, Defendants move for a protective order preventing any
further questioning of Stamper or, in the alternative, that his deposition be
taken by written examination, or limited to 30 minutes of questioning about
incident. Defendants also seek monetary sanctions under Code of Civil Procedure
section 2025.430 against Plaintiff’s counsel. Defendants also contend that the
motion to compel under section 2025.450 is inapplicable since Plaintiff did not
serve a notice of deposition for April 18, 2024. (Opp., 3.) Defendants also
assert that Plaintiff’s counsel asked irrelevant and harassing questions that
delayed the other depositions scheduled that day. (Opp., 5.) 
 
In reply, Plaintiff argues that Defendants have not met their burden
to show that the deposition should not be resumed. (Reply, 4.) Plaintiff also
argues that a protective order cannot be granted since Defendants did not raise
it in a separately noticed motion and did not provide a meet and confer
declaration. 
 
Despite the
argument above, the discovery motion cut-off in this case is closed. Any party
shall be entitled as a matter of right to complete discovery proceedings on or
before the 30th day, and to have motions concerning
discovery heard before the 15th day, before the date initially set for
the trial of the action. (Code Civ. Proc.§ 2024.020 (a).)¿A trial court abuses
its discretion in hearing a discovery motion past the deadlines in Code of
Civil Procedure section 2024.020 when it does not require the party to file a
motion for leave to reopen discovery under section 2024.050. (Pelton-Shepherd
Industries, Inc. v. Delta Packaging Products, Inc.¿(2008) 165 Cal.App.4th
1568, 1588.)¿¿ 
 
Here, the discovery cut-offs are associated with the
previous trial date of May 23, 2024. (Min. Order, 5/3/24.) Therefore, the last day to hear a
discovery motion was May 8, 2024. Since this motion to compel a deposition is
being heard on May 31, 2024, it is untimely. Plaintiff has not discussed
section 2024.050 in the motion. Plaintiff’s motion to reopen discovery is
currently scheduled for July 19, 2024. Therefore, the motion to compel is
denied and the Court declines to address Defendants’
motion for a protective order asserted in the opposition. 
 
 
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s
motion to compel Defendant Shayon Stamper’s Deposition is DENIED. 
 
Plaintiff shall provide notice of the Court’s ruling and file a proof
of service of such.
