 Case Number:  23NWCV01809    Hearing Date:   February 21, 2024    Dept:  C Gomez, et al. v.
American Honda
CASE NO.:  23NWCV01809
HEARING:   2/21/24 @ 9:30 AM

Plaintiffs’ Motion to Compel is CONTINUED to
April 24, 2024 at 10:30 AM in Dept. C.
Moving Party to give NOTICE.
 
Plaintiffs Luis Enrique Gomez and Marisela Rodriguez
(Plaintiffs) move to compel further responses to their Requests for Production
(set one). Plaintiff seeks further responses to 30 requests: 1-3, 7, 9, 12, 17,
18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 31, 32, 39, 40, 41, 45, 49, 51, 54, 56, 57, 74, 75, 82,
and 84-86. Defendant American Honda Motor Co., Inc. (Defendant) produced
additional documents on February 2, 2024. Thus, the Court continues this
hearing and orders the parties to further meet and confer and file a joint
statement of remaining issues. The joint statement shall contain the Requests
Plaintiff seeks further responses from and the Requests Plaintiff seeks further
production from. Additionally, it shall contain Defendant’s opposition. 
To assist the parties in meeting and
conferring, the Court is unlikely to compel Defendant to provide further
responses on the grounds that its objections are improper as Plaintiffs’
Requests are broad and could encompass irrelevant or privileged documents.
Further, the Court typically finds that documents related to similar vehicles
of the same year and model with similar defects within California are relevant
and expanding the scope of discovery beyond that would be unduly burdensome and
of limited probative value.
 
Accordingly, Plaintiffs’
Motion to Compel is CONTINUED to April 24, 2024 at 10:30 AM in Dept. C.
