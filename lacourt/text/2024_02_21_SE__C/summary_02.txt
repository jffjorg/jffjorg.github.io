And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the Defendants' Motion to Set Aside Default and Default Judgment. The default judgment was entered against the Defendants on March 1, 2023, due to their failure to file a responsive pleading. However, the Defendants' counsel has submitted an affidavit stating that their neglect was excusable, as they were preparing for trials in other matters at the time. The Judge finds that the Defendants' counsel's neglect was indeed excusable and that there is a strong public policy in favor of granting relief and allowing the requesting party their day in court. Therefore, the Judge is granting the Motion to Set Aside Default and Default Judgment, effectively setting aside the default judgment and allowing the case to proceed.
