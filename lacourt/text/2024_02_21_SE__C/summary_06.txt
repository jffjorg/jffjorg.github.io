And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has tentatively ruled to continue the hearing on the plaintiffs' motion to compel further responses to their requests for production. The motion is continued to April 24, 2024, at 10:30 AM in Department C. The parties are ordered to meet and confer and file a joint statement of remaining issues, including the requests for which the plaintiffs seek further responses and the requests for which they seek production. The statement should also include the defendant's opposition. The court is unlikely to compel the defendant to provide further responses, as the plaintiffs' requests are broad and could encompass irrelevant or privileged documents. Additionally, the court finds that documents related to similar vehicles of the same year and model with similar defects within California are relevant, and expanding the scope of discovery beyond that would be unduly burdensome and of limited probative value.
