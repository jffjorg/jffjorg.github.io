Defendant
Benjamin De La Cruz (Defendant) has filed two separate Motions, however, he has
reserved only one hearing. However, considering this Court’s ruling on the
Motion to Set Aside, this Court shall consider both Motions.
Motion for
Reconsideration of this Court’s January 25, 2024 Order
Defendant
moves for reconsideration of this Court’s January 25, 2024 Order. "A
motion for reconsideration may only be brought if the party moving for
reconsideration can offer 'new or different facts, circumstances, or law' which
it could not, with reasonable diligence, have discovered and produced at the
time of the prior motion.... A motion for reconsideration will be denied absent
a strong showing of diligence." (Forrest v. Dept. Of Corps. (2007)
150 Cal.App.4th 183, 202, disapproved on other grounds by Shalant v. Girardi
(2011) 51 Cal. 4th 1164, 1172.) Here, there are no new facts or circumstances
provided to support reconsideration of the Order. Further, the Order placed the
Motion off-calendar because no moving papers were filed. Thus, Defendant’s
Motion for Reconsideration is denied.
Motion
to Set Aside Default
Defendant’s
Motion to Set Aside Default is continued. Moving papers are to be filed 16
court days before the hearing. (CCP § 1005(b).) The hearing date is February
21, 2024, and 16 court days before is January 26, 2024. The Motion was
purportedly served on January 30, 2024. Thus, the Motion was improperly served
on Plaintiff. “[A] trial court has broad discretion to accept or reject
late-filed papers.” (Rancho Mirage Country Club Homeowners Assn. v.
Hazelbaker (2016) 2 Cal.App.5th 252, 262.) Thus, the Court shall continue
the Motion to Set Aside Default to allow Plaintiff the opportunity to oppose
the Motion on the merits.
Plaintiff
additionally argues that Defendant cannot personally file a motion while he is
represented by counsel. However, it fails to provide any authority to support
its argument.
 
Accordingly, Defendant’s
Motion for Reconsideration is DENIED. Defendant’s Motion to Set Aside Default
is CONTINUED to April 17, 2024 at 9:30 AM in Dept. C. Any opposition is to be
filed by April 4, 2024. Any reply is to be filed by April 10, 2024.
