And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by the defendant, Mario Rene Pena, in a commercial unlawful detainer action brought by 4511 Firestone Blvd., LLC (the plaintiff). The defendant demurred to the complaint, arguing that it was uncertain due to the lack of information about the person signing the Notice to Quit, the amount of rent, and the applicability of Civil Code § 1946.2. The judge has ruled that the Notice to Quit is not uncertain, as it does not require the title of the person signing the notice to be stated. The judge also found that the amount of rent is not uncertain, as it was changed during the tenancy and the complaint adequately states the current rent. Finally, the judge ruled that the complaint is not uncertain because it adequately explains why Civil Code § 1946.2 does not apply to this commercial lease. Therefore, the judge has overruled the defendant's demurrer and ordered the defendant to file an answer within 5 days of the order.
