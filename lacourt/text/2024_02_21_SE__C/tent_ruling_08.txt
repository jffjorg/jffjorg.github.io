Defendant’s Demurrer is OVERRULED.
Moving Party to give NOTICE.
 
Defendant Mario Rene Pena (Defendant) demurs to
the Complaint on the grounds that it is uncertain.
Background
This
is a commercial unlawful detainer action filed by Plaintiff 4511 Firestone
Blvd., LLC against Defendant regarding the non-payment of rent for the real
property commonly known as 4481 and 4493 Firesonte Boulevard, South Gate, CA
90280.
Legal
Standard
The
party against whom a complaint has been filed may object to the pleading, by
demurrer, on several grounds, including the ground that the pleading does not
state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. (CCP § 430.10(e).) A
party may demur to an entire complaint, or to any causes of action stated
therein. (CCP § 430.50(a).) “‘[A] demurrer based on an affirmative defense will
be sustained only where the face of the complaint discloses that the action is
necessarily barred by the defense.’” (McKenney v. Purepac Pharmaceutical Co.
(2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 72, 78-79.)
Discussion

Defendant demurs to the Complaint on the
grounds that (1) the Notice to Quit is uncertain because it does not state the
“role” of the person signing the notice; (2) the amount of rent is uncertain;
and (3) it does not state why the Civil Code § 1946.2 (2019 Tenant Protection
Act) is not applicable.
First, the Notice Quit is not uncertain.
Defendant claims that the Notice to Quit is uncertain because it does not state
whether Trish Balesmann, who signed the Notice to Quit, is the landlord, owner,
or agent. Defendant provides no authority to support his argument that the
Notice to Quit must state the title of the person signing the notice. Further,
it is clear that Ms. Balesmann is an agent of 4511 Firestone Blvd., LLC. Thus,
the Notice to Quit is no uncertain.
Second, the amount of rent sought in the
Complaint is not uncertain. The Complaint states that the monthly rent was
changed from the initial $16,000.00 per month to $7,892.76 per month currently.
The amount of rent is allowed to be changed during a tenancy and Defendant
offers no authority to support his position that a complaint is uncertain
because the rent changed. Thus, the amount of rent sought in the Complaint is
not uncertain.
Finally, the Complaint is not uncertain because
it states why Civil Code § 1946.2 does not apply. Civil Code § 1946.2 only
applies to residential leases. The Complaint alleges that this is a commercial
lease. Thus, the Complaint is not uncertain. Therefore, Defendant’s Demurrer is
overruled.
 
Accordingly, Defendant’s
Demurrer is OVERRULED. Defendant is to file an answer within 5 days of this
Order.
