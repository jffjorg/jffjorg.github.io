And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion of IEV Factory, Inc.'s counsel, Matthew Huzaineh, to be relieved as counsel. The reason for this decision is that good cause exists to grant the motion, as per California Rules of Professional Conduct Rule 3-700(C). Specifically, IEV has failed to pay the agreed-upon fees, making it difficult for counsel to carry out their employment effectively. The judge has ordered that the motion is granted, and the order shall take effect when proof of service of the signed order on IEV has been filed with the court.
