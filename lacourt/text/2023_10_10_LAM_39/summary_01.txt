And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on various issues related to the upcoming trial in this wrongful termination case. The ruling includes several key points:

* Plaintiff's attorneys must refer to themselves only by their personal names and not mention their law firm to avoid undue prejudice.
* Evidence concerning Plaintiff's immigration status is excluded, but Defendant may not inquire into it without authorization from the Court.
* Defendant's evidence and testimony regarding Plaintiff's lack of a social security number is admissible, as it supports Defendant's theory that Plaintiff voluntarily left her job.
* The parties have provided a joint witness list with an estimate of approximately 30 hours of testimony, but the Court finds this estimate excessive and sets a reasonable trial estimate at 11 hours per side.
* During the trial, the parties may not say anything in front of the jury except for calling a witness, asking questions, introducing exhibits, raising objections, and moving to strike testimony.
* The parties must comply with rules regarding conduct in the courtroom, including not expressing disagreement or approval of testimony or evidence.

The Court's ruling is designed to ensure a fair and efficient trial, taking into account the significant backlog of cases in the department and the need to protect the time and resources of the Court, jurors, and other litigants.
