 Case Number:  21STCV13094    Hearing Date:   October 10, 2023    Dept:  39 Ramiro Mata Moya
v. Chipmasters Manufacturing, Inc.
Case No.
21STCV13094
Motion to Compel
Further Responses
 
            On February
27, 2023, the Court ordered Defendant to provide further responses to Request
for Production of Documents, Numbers 5 and 10, after compliance with
Belaire-West Landscape, Inc. v. Superior Court (2007) 149 Cal.App.4th 554.  (See Court’s Minute Order, dated February 27,
2023.)  Plaintiff filed a motion to
compel further responses and requests monetary sanctions in the amount of
$2,631.55 against Defendant and Defendant’s counsel, Seyfarth Shaw LLP.  
 
            A motion to
compel further responses is not the proper procedural vehicle to redress this
issue.  Rather, the Court construes
Plaintiff’s motion as a motion for discovery sanctions under Code of Civil
Procedure section 2023.030 seeking monetary sanctions in the amount of
$2,631.55 against Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s counsel, jointly and severally, as
well as issue, evidentiary, and terminating sanctions.  This order shall provide written notice of
the potential sanctions.  The Court
orders as follows:
 
            1.         The Court advances and vacates the
final status conference and trial date.
 
            2.         The Court shall hold a hearing on this
motion on November 6, 2023, at 8:30 a.m.
 
            3.         Defendant shall file an opposition on
or before the statutory deadline that includes a discussion of Defendant’s
efforts to comply with this order, including an update on the Belaire-West
notices.
 
            4.         The Court’s clerk shall provide
notice.
