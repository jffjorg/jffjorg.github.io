  FOR PRODUCTION

Dept.:  P


           I.
       INTRODUCTION           In this lemon law action, Plaintiff Elena
Rubio (Rubio) alleges she bought a defective 2018 Honda Accord. The Complaint
contains three causes of action: (1) lemon law- express warranty, (2) lemon
law- implied warranty and (3) lemon law-Section 1793.2. Plaintiff filed the instant motion to compel further
responses to Requests for Production on December 29, 2023. Defendant Honda
filed an opposition on March 25, 2024. Plaintiff filed a reply on March 28,
2024.The
Court continues the motion for the parties to further meet and confer.II.      LEGAL
STANDARD          A party
responding to requests for inspection must either provide a statement of
compliance, represent that it lacks the ability to comply, or object. (Code
Civ. Proc. § 2031.210.) When a party propounding demands for inspection deems
responses to the responses to be incomplete or evasive, or deems objections to
be without merit, the propounding party may move for an order compelling
further responses. Such motion must set forth facts showing good cause for the
discovery, be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration, and include a
separate statement. Such motion must also be made within 45 days of verified
responses or supplemental responses, or on or before any specific later date
the parties have agreed to in writing. (Code Civ. Proc. §2031.310(a)-(c).)          Code Civ. Proc. Section 2031.310(h) provides for the
imposition of monetary sanctions against any party who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes such a motion unless the court finds that the one subject to sanction
acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the
imposition of sanctions unjust.III.     ANALYSIS          A. Meet and ConferCode
Civ. Proc. §2031.310(b) mandates that a motion to compel further responses be
accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040. Code Civ.
Proc. §2016.040 details: “A meet and confer declaration in support of a motion
shall state facts showing a reasonable and good faith attempt at an informal
resolution of each issue presented by the motion.” (CCP § 2016.040.)Counsel
for Plaintiff, David Derderian, declares that he sent a meet and confer letter
regarding the allegedly deficient responses on November 17, 2023. (Derderian
Decl. ¶ 18, referencing Exh. 5.) Counsel for Defendant responded to the letter
on November 28, 2023. (Derderian Decl. ¶ 23, see Exh. 6.) Derderian then tried
to call Defendant’s counsel but was unable to and left a voicemail. (Derderian
Decl. ¶ 24.) The Court finds that the meet and confer was deficient. Plaintiff’s
meet and confer does not discuss the fact that Honda did provide substantive
responses to the majority of the discovery requests or otherwise address the
sufficiency of the substantive responses. (See Opposition p. 6, Defendant’s
Opposition to Separate Statement p. 14:11-13.) Secondly,
in her reply, Plaintiff mentions for the first time that she is seeking
specific documents. (See Reply p. 3: 9-14.) The Court reminds parties that
civil discovery is intended to be a self-executing system with minimal
judicial intervention. (See Volkswagenwerk Aktiengesellschaft v.
Superior Ct. (1981) 122 Cal.App.3d 326, 331; Clement v. Alegre (2009)
177 Cal.App.4th 1277, 1291-1292.)The
Court directs parties to meet and confer to resolve their discovery disputes. The
Court intends to continue the hearing on this motion to a date convenient to the Court and parties.         V.       CONCLUSION AND ORDER            Plaintiff’s motion to compel further response
to Requests for Production, Set One is continued to allow for further meet and
confer.April 4, 2024 Judge Jared D. Moses
