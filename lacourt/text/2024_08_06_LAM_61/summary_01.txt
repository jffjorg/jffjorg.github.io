Summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for summary judgment or adjudication brought by Defendant Precision Dental Inc. The motion is granted as to the fourth cause of action for invasion of privacy, and denied as to the third cause of action for negligence and the sixth cause of action for financial elder abuse. The judge found that Defendant did not owe a duty of care to Plaintiff in the context of the loan transaction, and that Defendant's actions did not constitute a serious invasion of Plaintiff's privacy. The judge also found that there are triable issues of fact as to whether Defendant's encumbering of Plaintiff's properties constituted a "taking" within the meaning of the elder abuse statute, and therefore denied the motion as to the financial elder abuse claim.
