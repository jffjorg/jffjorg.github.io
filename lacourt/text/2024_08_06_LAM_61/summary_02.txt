And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants the plaintiffs' motion for attorney fees in the amount of $98,750.00. The plaintiffs, who prevailed on their wage claims, seek fees under Labor Code § 218.5 and Civil Code § 1717. The defendants argue that the fees should be apportioned among the prevailing plaintiffs, but the judge finds that fees incurred for representation on issues common to both fee-claims and no-fee claims are compensable. The judge also finds that the amount of fees incurred solely for the non-contract vendor plaintiffs is less than the amount recoverable under Civil Code § 1717.5, and therefore does not need to be reduced. The motion is granted in the amount of $98,750.00.
