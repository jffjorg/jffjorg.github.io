Summary:

The Judge denies the defendants' motion to compel arbitration of the plaintiff's individual PAGA claims. The plaintiff seeks to dismiss her individual PAGA claims, and the defendants seek to compel arbitration of those claims. The Judge finds that the arbitration agreement does not encompass PAGA claims and that the plaintiff need not allege an individual PAGA claim to pursue representative PAGA claims on behalf of other aggrieved employees. The Judge also finds that the defendants' request for arbitration becomes moot if the plaintiff's individual PAGA claims are dismissed.
