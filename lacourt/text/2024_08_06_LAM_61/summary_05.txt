And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to quash a subpoena issued by Plaintiff Jeff Selzer to third-party Diversity Law Group, P.C. The subpoena seeks discovery materials related to Rudrud v. Mideb Nominees, Inc., a related case. Mideb Nominees, Inc. argues that the subpoena is overbroad and infringes on privacy interests, but the Judge finds that the subpoena is properly supported by good cause and framed with reasonable particularity. The Judge also finds that the documents sought are relevant to the case and that the parties have been served with the subpoena and have not objected to the disclosure of the materials. The motion to quash is therefore denied, and Plaintiff is directed to provide notice.
