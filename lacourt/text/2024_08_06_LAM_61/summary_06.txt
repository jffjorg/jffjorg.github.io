And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by State Farm General Insurance Company (Defendant) to the complaint filed by Benhour Soleimani (Plaintiff). The judge sustains the demurrer without leave to amend as to the second cause of action for breach of contractual duty to pay a covered claim. The judge finds that this cause of action is duplicative of the first cause of action for breach of contract and that the allegations of the complaint do not constitute a legally sufficient cause of action.

The judge overrules the demurrer as to the fourth cause of action for intentional misrepresentation. The judge finds that the allegations of the complaint are sufficient to state a claim for promissory fraud, and that the economic loss rule does not apply to this claim.

The judge orders Defendant to provide notice of the ruling.
