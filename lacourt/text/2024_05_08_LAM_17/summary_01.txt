And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has denied the plaintiff's motion to appoint a receiver to enforce the judgment. The plaintiff argued that the defendant has been collecting rent without paying secured creditors and has been inciting tenants not to comply with the court's order. The court found that the plaintiff's arguments were based on speculation or evidence without foundation, and that the defendant's actions did not show a good cause for the appointment of a receiver. The court also found that the remedies sought by the plaintiff, such as eviction of tenants, were not justified at this time.
