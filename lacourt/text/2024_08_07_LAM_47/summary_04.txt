And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge, Theresa M. Traber, has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Patrick Minner v. Washington Motors, LLC, et al. (Case No. BC511769). The Court has reconsidered its previous ruling granting Defendant Washington Motors' motion to strike its own answer and enter default. The Court has vacated the previous ruling and denied the motion. The Court has scheduled a Trial Setting Conference for Monday, August 26, 2024, at 8:30 AM. The Court's decision is based on four factors: (1) Defendant provided no authority supporting its position, (2) case law indicates that an unopposed jury trial is the proper remedy for the failure of a defendant to appear at trial, (3) none of the grounds for waiver of a jury trial would have been satisfied under these circumstances, and (4) imposition of default could potentially limit Plaintiff's recovery in ways that would be not applicable at trial. The Court has found that the June 24, 2024 ruling granting Defendant's motion should be vacated, the motion denied, and this action re-scheduled for a jury trial forthwith.
