STATEMENT
OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
            Plaintiff alleges he purchased a
car that is inoperable.
 
            The Court,
on its own motion, reconsiders June 24, 2024 ruling granting Defendant
Washington Motors motion to have its own answer stricken and default entered
against it. 
 
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
On
its own motion, the Court vacates its June 24, 2024 ruling granting Defendant
Washington Motors motion to have its own answer stricken and default entered
against it. 
 
Defendant’s
Motion to Strike its own Answer is DENIED.
 
The
Court schedules a Trial Setting Conference for Monday, August 26, 2024, at 8:30
AM. 
 
DISCUSSION:
 
            The Court,
on its own motion, reconsiders June 24, 2024 ruling granting Defendant
Washington Motors, LLC’s motion to have its own answer stricken and default
entered against it. 
 
            On June 24,
2024, the Court granted Defendant Washington Motors, LLC’s Motion for Order
Striking Answer and Entry of Default. While Defendant cited no particular code
provision authorizing that request, Defendant reasoned that the Court had the
inherent power to strike Defendant’s answer upon its request and enter default
so as to facilitate its surrender in this action. Defendant claimed that
Plaintiff would suffer no prejudice because Plaintiff would, in essence, secure
victory. 
 
            After
further consideration of the matter, the Court issued an order on July 10, 2024
setting this matter for further hearing and indicating the Court’s intention
to, on its own motion, reconsider and deny the motion and reset this action for
a jury trial. The Court’s authority to reconsider its own rulings is Le
Francois v. Goel (2005) 35 Cal.4th 1094, which expressly holds that the
Court retains inherent authority to reconsider its own rulings even when a
formal motion by a party would be precluded by Code of Civil Procedure
section 1008. (Le Francois v. Goel (2005) 35 Cal.4th 1094, 1108-1109.) Consistent
with that holding, the Court invited briefing from the parties and set this
matter for a further hearing on the issue. Defendant’s opposition brief was ordered
to be served and filed on July 22, 2024, with any reply to be served and filed
by July 31, 2024. Defendant served its opposition brief pursuant to that order but,
due to a cyberattack on the Court’s systems, filed the opposition on July 25,
2024. No reply brief from Plaintiff has been received. 
 
            As
expressed in the Court’s July 10, 2024 order, the Court’s rationale rests on four
factors: (1) Defendant provided no authority supporting the position that it
may withdraw its answer and seek default on the eve of trial; (2) case law
indicates that an unopposed jury trial, rather than the entry of default, is
the proper remedy for the failure of a defendant to appear at trial (Code Civ.
Proc. § 594(a); Heidary v. Yadollahi (2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 857, 862-63);
(3) none of the grounds for waiver of a jury trial would have been satisfied
under these circumstances (Code Civ. Proc. § 631(f); and (4) imposition of
default could potentially limit Plaintiff’s recovery in ways that would be not
applicable at trial. (Garimendi v. Golden Eagle Ins. Co. (2004) 116
Cal.App.4th 694, 705.) 
 
            Defendant’s
opposition fails entirely to address of these points and instead merely
reasserts the position that the Court retains the inherent authority to strike
the answer and enter default, citing a 1969 appellate opinion with absolutely
no relation to the facts at hand. (Mowrer v. Superior Court (1969) 3
Cal.App.3d 223 [challenging propriety of order holding public defender in
contempt].) 
 
            The Court
therefore finds, for the reasons set forth above, that the June 24, 2024 ruling
granting Defendant’s motion should be vacated, the motion denied, and this
action re-scheduled for a jury trial forthwith. 
 
CONCLUSION:
 
Accordingly, on its own motion, the Court vacates its June 24,
2024 ruling granting Defendant Washington Motors motion to have its own answer
stricken and default entered against it. 
 
Defendant’s
Motion to Strike its own Answer is DENIED.
 
The
Court schedules a Trial Setting Conference for Monday, August 26, 2024, at 8:30
AM. 
 
Court
to give notice.  
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
