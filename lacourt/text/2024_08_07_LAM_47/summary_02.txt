And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to deem the truth of matters stated in requests for admissions as admitted, as well as a request for sanctions. The case involves a habitability action brought by the plaintiff, Ken Houang, against the defendant, Rochelle H. Sterling, individually and as trustee of the Sterling Family Trust. The plaintiff seeks to deem the truth of matters stated in the requests for admissions propounded to the defendant as admitted, and is also seeking sanctions in the amount of $2,250 against the defendant for failing to respond to the requests.

The court has granted the plaintiff's motion to deem the truth of matters stated in the requests for admissions as admitted, as the defendant failed to provide a valid substantive response to the requests. The court has also denied the plaintiff's request for sanctions, as the failure to provide a verification in the defendant's response was the responsibility of the defendant's counsel, and the court does not have the authority to impose sanctions on the party it considers responsible for this failure.
