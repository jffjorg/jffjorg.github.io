The judge also reviews case law, including Delgado v. Superior Court (1977), Martinez v. City of Clovis (2023), and Brown v. Superior Court (1984), to determine the proper venue for the case. The judge finds that the complaint alleges sufficient facts to state a cause of action and that venue is proper in Los Angeles County. The judge also addresses the defendant's argument that the plaintiff cannot amend the complaint's allegations regarding exposure before venue is determined, and finds that the plaintiff has shown that venue is proper in Los Angeles County.
