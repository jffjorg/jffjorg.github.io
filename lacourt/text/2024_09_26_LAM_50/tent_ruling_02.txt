[1]The Court notes
that the sentence objected to in Defendant’s Objection No. 2 is contained in
paragraph 4 of Mr. Wisdom’s declaration. 


[2]In Delgado v.
Superior Court (1977)
74 Cal.App.3d 560, 563, cited by Defendant, the Court of Appeal noted that “Defendant
Lew Williams Chevrolet Center has its principal place of business in Sacramento
County…This is the equivalent of ‘residence’ for venue purposes.” 
 


[3]As noted by
Plaintiff, “[t]o survive a demurrer, the complaint need only allege facts
sufficient to state a cause of action; each evidentiary fact that might
eventually form part of the plaintiff’s proof need not be alleged.” (Martinez v. City of Clovis (2023) 90 Cal.App.5th 193, 253.) 
 


[4]As to the third
question posed in the Court’s August 9, 2024 minute order, Defendant asserts
that Plaintiff cannot amend the Complaint’s allegations regarding exposure
before venue is determined. Defendant notes that “[v]enue is determined based
on the complaint on file at the time the motion to change venue is made.” (Brown v. Superior Court (1984) 37 Cal.3d 477, 482.) Plaintiff does not appear to
dispute this point. In any event, as set forth above, the Court finds that
Plaintiff has shown that venue is proper in Los Angeles County.
