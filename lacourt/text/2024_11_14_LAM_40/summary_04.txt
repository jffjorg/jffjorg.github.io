And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a request for an interlocutory judgment for partition by sale and appointment of a referee in a case involving the partition of real property owned by the plaintiff and defendant as tenants in common. The plaintiff is entitled to partition the property as a co-owner, and the court must determine the parties' interests in the property and issue an order granting the partition. The court will appoint a referee to divide or sell the property, and the referee will have the authority to post a bond. The plaintiff has nominated Matthew L. Taylor as the referee and has offered to post a $5,000 bond within four days of the judgment being entered. The court is inclined to grant the request for interlocutory judgment, but has ordered the plaintiff to include language in the proposed judgment stating that the referee will post the bond. The referee will also be required to file his first report for approval.
