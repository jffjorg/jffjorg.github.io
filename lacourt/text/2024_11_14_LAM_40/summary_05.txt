(Plaintiff's RJN Ex. D, p. 2)
```

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the defendants' motion to stay the action pending appeal. The defendants moved to stay the action after the court denied their motion to compel arbitration, citing the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) and arguing that an automatic stay is required. The plaintiff opposes the motion, arguing that California law does not permit an automatic stay of the action. The judge concludes that the FAA does not preempt California Code of Civil Procedure section 1294, which prohibits an automatic stay of the action pending appeal. The judge also finds that the defendants have not demonstrated a basis for a discretionary stay, citing the purpose of the statute to avoid delay tactics by corporate defendants and to level the playing field for consumers, governments, and workers. Therefore, the judge denies the motion to stay the action.
