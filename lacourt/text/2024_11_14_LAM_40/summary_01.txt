And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted Defendant American Honda Motor Co., Inc.'s motion for summary judgment. The Plaintiff, Jesus Castro, brought claims under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act (SBA) alleging that the Defendant failed to repair defects in a 2018 Honda Pilot he purchased. However, the court found that the Plaintiff lacks standing to bring this action because he bought a used vehicle without a new warranty issued by the Defendant. The court relied on the California Supreme Court's recent decision in Rodriguez v. FCA US, LLC, which held that a motor vehicle sold with an unexpired manufacturer's new car warranty does not qualify as a "new motor vehicle" for purposes of the SBA unless the new car warranty was issued with the sale. The court also found that the Plaintiff's fifth cause of action for breach of implied warranty fails because he bought the vehicle used from DCH Gardena, not the Defendant manufacturer.
