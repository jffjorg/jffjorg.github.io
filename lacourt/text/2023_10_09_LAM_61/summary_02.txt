And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling sustaining Defendant Lynette Scherer's demurrer to the Third Amended Complaint with 30 days leave to amend. The Judge concluded that the conduct alleged against Scherer does not constitute harassment or intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED). The conduct alleged is that Scherer transmitted fabricated performance records to personnel following Plaintiff Gergis Ghobrial's termination. The Judge found that this conduct constitutes personnel management activity, which is not actionable as harassment or IIED. The Judge also rejected Plaintiff's argument that Scherer's conduct was part of a larger pattern of harassment and discrimination, as the only harassment alleged against Scherer is the transmission of the fabricated performance records. The Judge noted that Plaintiff has failed to allege that he was aware of the communications at issue during his employment or that they contributed to an abusive working environment. The Judge also found that Plaintiff's argument that Scherer's conduct was part of a larger pattern of harassment and discrimination is not relevant, as Scherer is only alleged to have engaged in personnel management activity, which is not actionable as harassment or IIED.
