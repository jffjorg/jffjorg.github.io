I.                  
MOTION FOR ORDERS
RELATING TO RECEIVER’S FINAL ACCOUNT AND REPORT
 
A receiver
must present by noticed motion or stipulation of all parties:
(1) A final
account and report;
(2) A request
for the discharge; and
(3) A request
for exoneration of the receiver's surety.
(CRC Rule 3.1184, subd.
(a)(1)–(3).) “If any allowance of compensation for the receiver or for an
attorney employed by the receiver is claimed in an account, it must state in
detail what services have been performed by the receiver or the attorney and
whether previous allowances have been made to the receiver or attorney and the
amounts.” (CRC Rule 3.1184, subd. (d).) Although interim fees are subject to
approval by the court, the court “retains jurisdiction to award a greater or
lesser amount as the full, fair, and final value of the services received.”
(CRC Rule 3.1183, subd. (a).)
“[T]he amount of
compensation paid to a receiver is within the court's discretion.” (City of
Sierra Madre v. SunTrust Mortgage, Inc. (2019) 32 Cal.App.5th 648, 657.) 
Receiver Michale L.
Wachtell (Receiver) seeks an order approving his final account and report,
termination of the receivership and discharge of his responsibilities,
approving his final fees and costs, and approving the disposition of the
remaining receivership funds. 
The history of the
receivership fund is as follows, as provided in the declaration of the Receiver
himself. Following the initial appointment of the Receiver, most assets
otherwise subject to his control were turned over to the custody of the
Bankruptcy Trustee overseeing the multiple bankruptcy actions then pending for
various entity defendants. (Wachtell Decl. ¶ 8.)[1]
The Bankruptcy Trustee paid $50,000 to the Receiver in order to allow the
Receiver to pay counsel for an interpleader action then pending in Texas.
(Wachtell Decl. ¶ 9.) The Texas interpleader action, filed in May 1991,
involved the disposition of approximately $499,000.00 held in a Texas bank
account. (Wachtell Decl. ¶ 10.) A settlement agreement reached in that action
as of May 1993, provided for Receiver’s receipt of $472,241.01 of the
interpleaded funds. (Wachtell Decl. ¶ 11.)
Thus the earliest funds
held by the Receivership included the $50,000.00 payment from the bankruptcy
trustee and the $472,241.01 in proceeds received from the interpleader
settlement. (Wachtell Decl. ¶ 12.) The Receivership thus began with
$522,241.01. (Wachtell Decl. Exh. 12.)
Receiver filed an
application in November 1993 for leave to pay various professionals from the
funds contained in the receivership estate. (Wachtell Decl. ¶ 14.) The
application sought payment of an outstanding $236,089.48 in professional fees,
leaving $246,910 for continuing services that were expected to be incurred in
enforcing the judgment. (Wachtell Decl. ¶ 16.) The application was granted in
December 1993. (Wachtell Decl. ¶ 17.)
In December 1993,
Receiver disbursed $40,173.05 to the former receiver per the court’s order.
(Wachtell Decl. Exh. 12.) Between April 1993 and January 1998, Receiver made
$323,957.72 in disbursals from the receivership to pay approved fees and costs
and legal fees incurred on behalf of aggrieved shareholders seeking recovery
from Defendants in various bankruptcy proceedings. (Wachtell Decl. Exh. 12.) In
March 1995, $33,996.88 was disbursed to Price Waterhouse for accounting
services. (Wachtell Decl. Exh. 12.) From February 1995 through May 2023,
$34,750.00 were paid for renewal of the receiver’s bond. (Wachtell Decl. Exh.
12.) $280 were discharged for bank fees. (Wachtell Decl. Exh. 12.) Finally,
over the life of the account, $71,145.67 was earned in interest. (Wachtell
Decl. Exh. 12.) 
Thus, from the initial
deposits of $522,241.01, a total of $433,407.65 in disbursals were made, and
$71,145.67 in interest was earned, yielding a current balance in the
receivership account of $160,229.03. (Wacthell Decl. Exh. 12.) 
Receiver states that
after his involvement in the Texas interpleader action, and in the bankruptcy
litigation against Defendants David C. Bryant and David C. Knight that
prevented them from discharging their debts in bankruptcy, his communication with
Plaintiff California Department of Corporations (Plaintiff) was hampered by the
health issues of lead counsel Melinda Brun, and the lack of further guidance
provided by Plaintiff. (Wachtell Decl. ¶ 26.) In 2001 Receiver was informed
that Brun would not be returning from her leave of absence and that a
reorganization had occurred at the relevant department, but was given no
further guidance. (Wachtell Decl. ¶ 27.) Receiver sent a letter in January 2002
to Plaintiff’s supervising corporations counsel, advising him of his activities
and requesting assistance regarding the payment of professionals owed money by
the receivership estate. (Wacthell Decl. ¶ 28.) But Plaintiff has no record of
a further response. (Ibid.)
In 2014, Receiver checked
the court file and observed that the judgment in this matter had not been
renewed. (Wacthell Decl. ¶ 30.) After contacting Plaintiff again in 2018,
Plaintiff provided a letter in February 2018 stating that they did not oppose
the termination of the receivership and the filing of a final report and
account. (Wachtell Decl. ¶ 32.) 
Receiver contends that
neither he nor the former receiver were charged with filing tax returns for any
of the individual or corporate defendants. (Wachtell Decl. ¶ 33.) After
consulting with an accountant, Dominic LoBuglio, in October 2017, regarding the
receivership’s potential tax liabilility, and that Receiver has been filing
yearly QSF tax returns from 2016 through the present. (Wachtell Decl. ¶ 34.)
From the receivership
account’s current balance of $160,229.03, Receiver seeks the following
disbursements. Receiver seeks $46,081.73 in receivership fees now sought from
1993 to July 2023, plus $10,000.00 to cover the expenses in preparing for the
hearing on this motion, and to coordinate further payments to former receiver
and professionals, and to make final QSF tax return.(Wachtell Decl. Exh. 14..)
Receiver also seeks a distribution of $33,367.25 to Dominic LuBuglio for accountant’s
fees from January 2017 through the hearing on this motion. (LoBuglio Decl. Exh.
A.) All remaining funds are to be distributed to the former receiver and the
professionals hired by him, who are still owed money, on a pro rata basis, and
funds remaining after that shall be paid to the Knight/Bryant Security Owners
Protective Association (SOPA), an organization licensed by Plaintiff to protect
the interests of investors in the various entities subject to this lawsuit,
which filed a complaint-in-intervention therein. (Proposed Order; Wachtell
Decl. ¶ 5.)
Receiver has presented an
account of the funds in the receivership account, and the deposits and
disbursals made therefrom. He has presented the fees for which he seeks
reimbursement for himself, as well as for his accountant Dominic LuBuglio.
However, he states that he intends to pay as-yet unpaid professionals from the
funds that remain, without providing information about the amounts currently
owed to these professionals. (Motion at p. 2.) It is unclear if the $160,229.03
remaining in the receivership account is sufficient to pay both the fees sought
by the current Receiver and these unpaid professionals. 
Accordingly, the court
requests that Receiver provide the amounts currently owed and unpaid to
previously retained professionals before it makes any determination concerning
the final account and report.
