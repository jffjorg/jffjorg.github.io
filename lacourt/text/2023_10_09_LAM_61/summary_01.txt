And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is granting the motion of Forest Smith and Lina Smith to file a second amended complaint. The new allegations of misconduct by Defendant Blair Stover are based on the retention of new counsel and a consultant to review electronically stored records. The motion complies with the requirements of California Rule of Court Rule 3.1324 and no opposition has been filed. The judge notes that the trial court has discretion to permit or deny the amendment of the complaint, but instances justifying denial are rare. The judge also cites precedents that courts should apply a policy of great liberality in permitting amendments to the complaint, as long as no prejudice is shown to the adverse party.
