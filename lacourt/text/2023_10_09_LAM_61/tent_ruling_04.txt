states that “[t]he attorney in an action or special proceeding may be changed

brought instead of filing a consent (without compromising attorney-client
confidentiality), (2) proof of service of the motion, and (3) all hearing dates
scheduled in the action or proceeding, including the date of trial, if know.
Additionally, “[t]he proposed order relieving counsel must be prepared on the
Order Granting Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel--Civil (form MC-053)
and must be lodged with the court with the moving papers.”
