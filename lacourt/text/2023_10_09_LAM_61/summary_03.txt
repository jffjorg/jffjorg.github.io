Judge's Tentative Ruling:

The Judge has denied Defendant Gary T. Greene's motion to strike the prayer for punitive damages from Plaintiff Daniel Becker's First Amended Complaint. The Judge found that the allegations in the complaint support the presence of malice, oppression, and fraud by the Defendant. The Judge noted that the Defendant's conduct, including failing to remedy defects, misrepresenting facts, and refusing to remediate defects, demonstrates a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others. The Judge also noted that the Defendant's conduct went beyond mere negligence or recklessness and was intentional and malicious. Therefore, the motion to strike is denied, and the prayer for punitive damages will remain in the complaint.
