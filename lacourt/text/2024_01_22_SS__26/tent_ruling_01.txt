Motion to Vacate Entry of Default and Default Judgment is DENIED.
 
                                                                                                                                
ANALYSIS:
 
On July 19, 2019, Plaintiff Willard Watson (“Plaintiff”)
filed the instant action for civil rights violations against Defendant Bola
Properties, LLC (“Defendant”). Following Defendants’ failure to file responsive
pleadings, the Court entered its default on May 5, 2020. Default judgment was
entered against Defendant on June 17, 2020. Plaintiff filed memorandum of costs
after judgment on September 25, 2023, and a writ of execution on October 4,
2023. 
 
Defendant filed the instant Motion to Set Aside Entry of
Default and Default Judgment on December 14, 2023. Plaintiff filed an
opposition on December 15, 2023 and Plaintiff replied on January 16, 2024. 
 
Discussion
 
Defendant moves to
vacate the entry of default pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 473,
subdivision (d) and section 473.5. 
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 473.5, subdivision
(a) provides: 
 
When service of a summons has not resulted
in actual notice to a party in time to defend the action and a default or
default judgment has been entered against him or her in the action,
he or she may serve and file a notice of motion to set
aside the default or default judgment and for leave to defend the
action.  The notice of motion shall be served and filed
within a reasonable time, but in no event exceeding the earlier of: (i) two
years after entry of a default judgment against him or her; or (ii) 180
days after service on him or her of a written notice
that the default or default judgment has been entered.
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 473.5, subd. (a).)
Additionally, the motion “shall be accompanied by an affidavit showing under
oath that the party’s lack of actual notice in time to defend the action was
not caused by his or her avoidance of service or inexcusable neglect. The party
shall serve and file with the notice a copy of the answer, motion, or other
pleading proposed to be filed in the action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 473.5, subd.
(b).) 
 
The Motion is not timely under this statute
because two years since default judgment was June 17, 2022. The Motion was
filed a year-and-a-half after the statutory deadline. Therefore, Defendant has
not demonstrated that relief is proper under Code of Civil Procedure section 473.5.

 
Under Code of Civil
Procedure section 473, subdivision (d), “[t]he court may, .... on motion of
either party after notice to the other party, set aside any void judgment or
order.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (d).) Defendant argues that the default
and default judgment are void because it was not provided notice of either
request. Specifically, prior to the time the request for entry of default and
default judgment were mailed directly to Defendant, Plaintiff’s counsel was
aware that Defendant was represented by counsel and had entered into a
settlement agreement with Defendant. (Request for Entry of Default, filed
05/05/20, ¶6; Motion, Betty Decl., ¶¶2-3 and Exh. 1.) 
 
While the Motion is not
supported by any authority demonstrating that lack of notice of the request for
entry of default renders the resulting entry of default void, Plaintiff’s reply
points to the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 587: 
 
An
application by a plaintiff for entry of default under subdivision (a), (b), or
(c) of Section 585 or Section 586 shall include an affidavit stating that a
copy of the application has been mailed to the defendant's attorney of record
or, if none, to the defendant at his or her last known address and the date on
which the copy was mailed. If no such address of the defendant is known to the
plaintiff or plaintiff's attorney, the affidavit shall state that fact.
 
No default
under subdivision (a), (b), or (c) of Section 585 or Section 586 shall be
entered, unless the affidavit is filed. The nonreceipt of the notice shall not
invalidate or constitute ground for setting aside any judgment.
 
(Code Civ. Proc., §
587.) The declaration of mailing of the request for entry of default judgment
shows it was mailed to Defendant’s address, not that of defense counsel.
(Request for Default Judgment, filed 05/05/20, ¶6.) Plaintiff’s counsel,
however, was clearly aware of defense counsel having reached a settlement
agreement in 2019. (Motion, Betty Decl., Exh. 1.) The evidence shows,
therefore, that the declaration of mailing was false. However, Plaintiff’s
opposition demonstrates that nonreceipt of the request for default judgment
“shall not invalidate or constitute ground for setting aside any judgment.”
(Citing Standard Microsystems Corp. v. Winbond Electronics Corp. (2009)
179 Cal.App.4th 868, 899; Jackson v. Bank of America (1983) 141
Cal.App.3d 55, 59; Stevenson v. Turner (1979) 94 Cal.App.3d 315, 318.)
Defendant’s contention that lack of actual notice is different from Plaintiff’s
noncompliance with the statutory requirements for entry of default judgment
does not help its position, however. Defendant points to no authority that
Plaintiff’s noncompliance with the statutory requirements for the request for
default judgment is grounds to deem the judgment void. Without a showing that
the judgment is void, the Court cannot grant relief pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 473, subdivision (d).
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant Bola Properties, LLC’s Motion to Vacate Entry of
Default and Default Judgment is DENIED.
 
Court clerk to give notice.
