Here is the summary in English text:

This is the tentative ruling of the court regarding a motion to vacate the entry of default and default judgment. The plaintiff, Willard Watson, filed the instant action for civil rights violations against the defendant, Bola Properties, LLC, on July 19, 2019. The defendant failed to file responsive pleadings, and default was entered against it on May 5, 2020. Default judgment was entered against the defendant on June 17, 2020. The defendant filed the instant motion to set aside the entry of default and default judgment on December 14, 2023, arguing that it was not provided with notice of the request for entry of default and default judgment.

The court has reviewed the motion and has concluded that it is not timely under the statute. The motion was filed more than two years after the entry of default judgment, which is beyond the statutory deadline. The court has also concluded that the default and default judgment are not void, as the plaintiff's counsel was aware of the defendant's counsel having reached a settlement agreement in 2019.

The court has denied the defendant's motion to vacate the entry of default and default judgment.
