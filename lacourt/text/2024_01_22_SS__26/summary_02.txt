And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the motion filed by Cotton Blanks, Inc. (Plaintiff) to vacate the dismissal entered on July 12, 2023. The dismissal was entered when the Plaintiff failed to appear at trial, but the Plaintiff claims that their attorney failed to give notice of the trial date or appear for trial. The motion was filed within six months of the dismissal and is supported by an affidavit of attorney fault. As a result, the case is reinstated, and a new trial date is set for April 18, 2024 at 8:30 AM in Department 26 of the Spring Street Courthouse.
