 Case Number:  23STLC00190    Hearing Date:   January 22, 2024    Dept:  26  Antonyan v. Shadow Mountain View COA, et al.MOTION
FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Plaintiff Vardan Antonyan’s Motion for Preliminary Injunction
is DENIED. DEFENDANT SHADOW MOUNTAIN VIEW COMMUNITY ASSOCIATION’S REQUEST FOR
SANCTIONS IS DENIED.
 
 
ANALYSIS:
 
Plaintiff Vardan Antonyan (“Plaintiff”) filed the instant
action against Defendant Shadow Mountain View Community Association
(“Defendant”) on January 11, 2023. Defendant filed an answer on February 14,
2023. Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint on September 8, 2023, which
Defendant answered on September 25, 2023. On July 18, 2023, the Court denied
Plaintiff’s motion to compel production of documents pursuant to deposition
subpoena and issued sanctions against Plaintiff in the amount of $100.00.
(Minute Order, 07/18/23.) 
 
Plaintiff filed a Motion for Sanctions on August 2, 2023
that the Court denied on October 24, 2023. (Minute Order, 10/24/23.) On the
same date, the Court struck Plaintiff’s improperly filed First Amended
Complaint and Defendant’s answer to the First Amended Complaint. (Ibid.)

 
Plaintiff filed the instant Motion for Preliminary
Injunction on November 7, 2023. An opposition was filed on November 16, 2023.
The Motion initially came for hearing on November 20, 2023, at which time the
Court continued the matter for further briefing. (Minute Order, 11/20/23.) Plaintiff
filed a supplemental declaration and proofs of service on December 6, 2023. Defendant
filed a supplemental opposition on January 17, 2024. 
 
Discussion
 
Plaintiff’s
supplemental brief cites some authority for the issuance of a preliminary
injunction by the trial court, as follows: “Trial courts evaluate two
interrelated factors in deciding whether to issue preliminary injunctions.
First, the court considers whether the plaintiff is likely to prevail on the
merits. Second, the court weighs the interim harm to the plaintiff if the injunction
is denied with the harm to the defendant if the injunction is issued.” (Youngblood
v. Wilcox (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 1368, 1372.) 
 
Plaintiff’s
Complaint alleges the following causes of action: (1) Violation of Civil Code,
§ 5205; and (2) Violation of Civil Code, § 5502. (Compl., filed 01/11/23, pp.
3:20-5:10.) 
 
Likelihood of Prevailing
on the Merits
 
Civil Code section
5205 states in relevant part: “The association shall make available association
records for the time periods and within the timeframes provided in Section 5210
for inspection and copying by a member of the association, or the member's
designated representative.” (Civ. Code, § 5205, subd. (a).) Plaintiff alleges
that he sent a demand to Defendant to review HOA documents on August 4, 2022
but never received responsive documents. (Compl., pp. 2:9-17, 3:20-4:3.) 
 
Civil Code section 5502 states in relevant part: 
 
Transfers shall not be authorized from the
association's reserve or operating accounts without prior written approval from
the board of the association unless the amount of the transfer is less than the
following:
 
(1) The lesser of five thousand dollars
($5,000) or 5 percent of the estimated income in the annual operating budget,
for associations with 50 or less separate interests.
(2) The lesser of ten thousand dollars
($10,000) or 5 percent of the estimated income in the annual operating budget,
for associations with 51 or more separate interests.
 
(Civ. Code, § 5502.) Plaintiff
alleges that only one board member approved a legal fees expenditure of over
$10,000.00, and that thousands were spent on repairs without the board meeting
or approving the expenditure. (Compl., filed 01/11/23, pp. 4:14-5:10.) 
 
Neither Plaintiff’s initial, nor supplemental, papers in support of the
Motion for Preliminary Injunction address these alleged violations. Instead,
the papers refer to numerous other violations. (See Supp. Decl., filed
12/06/23, p. 5:6-17.) Therefore, Plaintiff has not addressed, nor demonstrated,
a likelihood of prevailing on the merits of either cause of action. This alone,
is grounds to deny the Motion. 
 
Interim Harm to the Parties
 
Plaintiff broadly alleges that they have “endured continuous
irreparable harm due to the Board’s misconduct” because the significant
mismanagement adversely affect[s] community welfare. (Supp. Motion, p. 14:5-7.)
The Motion also argues that Defendant is subject to no harm, only transient and
administrative inconvenient. (Id. at 14:15-17.) No evidence of the harm
to Plaintiff, however, is cited. Therefore, Plaintiff has not demonstrated any
interim harm from the alleged violations.
 
Request for Sanctions
 
Defendant’s request for sanctions
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 128.7 in its opposition is
improper. “[S]ection 128.7 requires a formal noticed motion in order to comply
with the statute.”  
(Barnes v. Department of
Corrections (1999) 74 Cal.App.4th 126, 135 [citing Code of Civil Procedure
section 128.7, subdivision (c)].) Defendant alternatively moves for sanctions
under Code of Civil Procedure section 177.5, which likewise contains a notice
provision: “Sanctions pursuant to this
section shall not be imposed except on notice contained in a party’s moving or
responding paper… after notice and an opportunity to be heard.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 177.5.) Defendant served the instant request for sanctions on January
17, 2024, just two court days prior to the hearing date. This does not provide
the requisite notice and opportunity for Plaintiff to be heard. The request for
sanctions, therefore, is denied on both grounds. 
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff Vardan Antonyan’s Motion
for Preliminary Injunction is DENIED. DEFENDANT SHADOW MOUNTAIN VIEW COMMUNITY
ASSOCIATION’S REQUEST FOR SANCTIONS IS DENIED.
