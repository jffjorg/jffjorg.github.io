And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied Plaintiff Vardan Antonyan's Motion for Preliminary Injunction. The judge found that Plaintiff has not demonstrated a likelihood of prevailing on the merits of either cause of action, and therefore has not met the necessary threshold for issuing a preliminary injunction. The judge also denied Defendant Shadow Mountain View Community Association's request for sanctions, finding that the request was improper and did not provide the required notice and opportunity for Plaintiff to be heard.
