ANALYSIS:
 
Petitioner Sean
Daniel McDevitt (“Petitioner”) filed the instant
Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award against Respondents Eric Garofano and The
Advisory and Mangement Group, Inc. (“Respondents”) on September 18, 2023. The
Petition seeks to confirm the arbitration award issued on July 31, 2023, in
favor of Petitioner, requiring expungement
of all references to certain customer dispute information maintained by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) in the Central Registration Depository (“CRD”).
(Pet., ¶¶7-8.) No response has been filed to date.
 
Legal Standard
 
“Any party to an arbitration in which an award has been made
may petition the court to confirm, correct or vacate the award.  The petition shall name as respondent all parties
to the arbitration and may name as respondents any other persons bound by the
arbitration award.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
1285.) “If a petition or response under this chapter is duly served and filed,
the court shall confirm the award as made, whether rendered in this state or
another state, unless in accordance with this chapter it corrects the award and
confirms it as corrected, vacates the award or dismisses the proceeding.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1286.)
 
Discussion
 
Filing Requirements of a Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award (CCP § 1285.4)
 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 1285.4 states: “A petition under this chapter shall:
 
(a)  
Set forth the substance of or have attached a copy of
the agreement to arbitrate unless the petitioner denies the existence of such
an agreement.
 
(b)  
Set forth the names of the arbitrators.
 
(c) Set forth
or have attached a copy of the award and the written opinion of the
arbitrators, if any.”
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1285.4 (emphasis added).) Petitioner
has set forth the substance of the arbitration award and submitted a copy of
the parties’ arbitration agreement with the names
of the arbitrators. (Pet., ¶4-6 and Attachment 4(b).) This satisfies Code of
Civil Procedure section 1285.4, subdivisions (a)-(c).
 
Service of the Petition and Notice of Hearing (CCP §
1290.4)
 
Code of Civil Procedure
section 1290.4 states in pertinent part: 
 
“(a) A copy of the
petition and a written notice of the time and place of the hearing thereof and
any other papers upon which the petition is
based shall be served in the manner provided in the arbitration
agreement for the service of such petition and notice.
 
(b) If the arbitration agreement does not provide the
manner in which such service shall be made and the person upon whom service is
to be made has not previously appeared in the proceeding and has not previously
been served in accordance with this subdivision: ¶ (1) Service within this
State shall be made in the manner provided by law for the service of summons in
an action.”
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1290.4.) The arbitration agreement does not provide
for the manner of service of the Petition and notice of hearing. (Pet.,
Attachment 4(b).) Accordingly, service must be in a manner approved for service
of a summons. On January 16, 2024, Petitioner filed Notices and Acknowledgment
of Receipt signed by Respondents following service by mail. (Notices and
Acknowledgment of Receipt, 01/16/23.) This comports with service by mail under
Code of Civil Procedure section 415.30. Therefore, the Court finds the Petition
complies with Code of Civil Procedure section 1290.4. 
 
Service of the Arbitration
Award (CCP § 1283.6)
         
Code of Civil Procedure section 1283.6
provides that: “The neutral arbitrator
shall serve a signed copy of
the award on each party to the arbitration personally or by registered or
certified mail or as provided in the agreement.”  (Emphasis added.)
This requirement may be satisfied by service by the arbitration, or upon proper
service of the award with the Petition. (See Murry v. Civil Service Employees Ins. Co. (1967) 254 Cal.App.2d 796, 799-800.)
 
The Petition attaches a
copy of the arbitration award, which indicates that it was served on July 31,
2023. (Pet., Attachment 8(c), p. 6.) However, it does not indicate the manner
of service. Therefore, Petitioner has not demonstrated proper service of
the award by the arbitrator. However, Petitioner has demonstrated service of
the award with the instant Petition. (Pet, Attachment 8(c).) Therefore, the
Court finds the requirements of Code of
Civil Procedure section 1283.6 have been met. 
 
Timing of Service of Petition (CCP §§
1288, 1288.4)
           

A party may seek a court judgment confirming an arbitration
award by filing and serving a petition no more than four years, but not less
than 10 days, after the award is served. (Code
Civ. Proc., §§ 1288, 1288.4.) The Court determines that the Petition
was timely filed approximately six months after the award was issued.
 
Merits of the Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award 
 
The court must
confirm the award as made, unless it corrects or vacates the award, or
dismisses the proceeding.  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1286; Valsan Partners Limited Partnership v. Calcor Space Facility,
Inc. (1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 809, 818.) Substantively, Petitioner has
demonstrated that on July 31, 2023, the arbitrators issued an award in their
favor and against Respondents requiring
expungement of all references to
certain customer dispute information as to Petitioners maintained by FINRA in
the CRD. (Pet., Attachment 8(c), pp. 3-5.)
