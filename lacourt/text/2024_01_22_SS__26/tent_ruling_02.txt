ANALYSIS:
 
On October 7, 2021, Plaintiff
Cotton Blanks, Inc. (“Plaintiff”) filed the instant action for conversion and
negligence against Defendant Oceanaire Sportswear, Inc. (“Defendant”).
Defendant filed an answer to the Complaint on October 6, 2022. The initial trial
date was continued to July 12, 2023. When Plaintiff failed to appear at trial,
the Court dismissed the action without prejudice. (Minute Order, 07/12/23.) 
 
Plaintiff filed the instant Motion to Vacate Dismissal on
October 16, 2023. No opposition to the Motion has been filed to date.
 
Discussion
 
The motion is brought
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure, section 473, subdivision (b). Under this statute, an application for relief must be made
no more than six months after entry of the order from which relief is sought
and must be accompanied by an affidavit of fault attesting to the moving
party’s mistake, inadvertence, surprise or neglect. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473,
subd. (b); English v. IKON Business Solutions (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 130,
143.) When based on attorney fault with respect to entry of default, default
judgment, or involuntary dismissal, a timely request for relief must be
granted. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b).) When brought pursuant to the
provision for discretionary relief based on party fault, the request must have
been filed within a reasonable amount of time. 
 
The motion was timely filed within
six months of dismissal of the action and is supported by an affidavit of
attorney fault. Plaintiff’s counsel declares that they failed to give notice of
the trial date or appear for trial on July 12, 2023. (Motion, Ross Decl.,
¶¶2-5.) Therefore, the case must be reinstated under Code of Civil Procedure
section 473, subdivision (b).
