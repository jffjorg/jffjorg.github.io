English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge in a case involving a personal injury lawsuit filed by Carlotta Andrea Peart against Macy's Retail Holdings, LLC. The lawsuit arose from an alleged injury to Peart's eye caused by a clothing item purchased from Macy's. The judge granted Macy's motion to compel responses to its discovery requests and awarded sanctions against Peart and her counsel in the amount of $660.00. The judge also denied Macy's motion for terminating sanctions, which sought to strike Peart's pleadings and enter judgment against her. The judge found that Macy's had failed to establish that Peart and her counsel had committed willful disobedience of the court's order to pay monetary sanctions.
