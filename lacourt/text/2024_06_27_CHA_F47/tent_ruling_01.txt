Case #22STCV27490
 
MOTION TO
COMPEL
(Special
Interrogatories, Set 2) 
 
Motion filed on 5/7/24.
 
MOVING PARTY: Defendant Macy’s Retail Holdings, LLC
RESPONDING PARTY: Plaintiff Carlotta Andrea Peart
NOTICE: ok
 
RELIEF REQUESTED: An order
compelling Plaintiff Carlotta Andrea Peart to provide verified responses,
without objection, to Defendant Macy’s Retail Holdings, LLC’s Special
Interrogatories, Set 2.  Additionally,
Macy’s requests sanctions against Plaintiff and her attorneys of record in the
amount of $960.00.
 

RULING: The motion is granted as set forth
below.  
 
SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises out of Plaintiff Carlotta Andrea
Peart’s (Plaintiff) purchase of clothing allegedly manufactured by Defendant
Calvin Klein Studio, LLC (Calvin Klein) from Defendant Macy’s Retail Holdings,
LLC (Macy’s) on 9/4/20.  Plaintiff
alleges that shortly after the purchase, while putting on one of the pieces of
clothing, the manufacturer’s tag/label came loose and cut Plaintiff’s eye
causing serious and permanent injury.  As
a result on 8/24/22, Plaintiff filed this action against Macy’s and Calvin
Klein alleging various causes of action.
 
On 3/21/24, Macy’s electronically served Plaintiff with
Special Interrogatories, Set 2, making responses due 4/23/24.  (Hall Decl. ¶2, Ex.A).  On 4/25/24, Macy’s counsel sent Plaintiff
correspondence regarding the lack of responses and requesting verified
responses without objections.  (Hall
Decl. ¶3, Ex.B).  Plaintiff’s counsel did
not respond and no responses to the discovery were served.  (Hall Decl. ¶¶3-4).  
 
Therefore, on 5/7/24, Macy’s filed and served the instant
motion seeking an order compelling Plaintiff to provide verified responses,
without objection, to Macy’s Special Interrogatories, Set 2.  Additionally, Macy’s requests sanctions
against Plaintiff and her attorneys of record in the amount of $960.00.  Plaintiff has not opposed or otherwise
responded to the motion.
 
ANALYSIS
 
Due to Plaintiff’s failure to serve timely responses to
the Special Interrogatories, Macy’s is entitled to responses without
objections.  CCP 2030.290(a), (b).  Additionally, Macy’s is entitled to an award
of sanctions against Plaintiff and her counsel for their failure to comply with
their discovery obligations.  CCP
2023.010(d); CCP 2023.030(a); CCP 2030.290(c). 
However, the Court finds that the amount of sanctions requested is
unreasonable.  The Court finds that 2
hours were reasonably spent preparing this motion and 1 hour will reasonably be
spent appearing on same at the reasonable hourly rate of $200/hour, plus a
$60.00 filing fee.  (See Hall
Decl. ¶6).  Therefore, sanctions are
awarded in the amount of $660.00.    
 
The Court notes that Macy’s counsel failed to accurately
edit the instant motion as it refers to Exhibits C and D which are not
attached.  (See Motion, p.3:17,
p.3:20).  
 
CONCLUSION
 
The motion is granted. 
Plaintiff is ordered to provide responses, without objections, to Macy’s
Special Interrogatories, Set 2, within 30 days. 
Sanctions are imposed on Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s counsel, M&K
Attorneys, APC, in the amount of $660.00, payable within 30 days.

Case #22STCV27490
 
MOTION FOR
TERMINATING SANCTIONS
 
Motion filed on 5/1/24.
 
MOVING PARTY: Defendant Macy’s Retail Holdings, LLC
RESPONDING PARTY: Plaintiff Carlotta Andrea Peart
NOTICE: ok
 
RELIEF REQUESTED: An order
granting terminating sanctions, striking one or all of the pleadings of and
entering judgment against Plaintiff Carlotta Andrea Peart.
 
RULING: The motion is denied.  
 
SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises out of Plaintiff Carlotta Andrea
Peart’s (Plaintiff) purchase of clothing allegedly manufactured by Defendant
Calvin Klein Studio, LLC (Calvin Klein) from Defendant Macy’s Retail Holdings,
LLC (Macy’s) on 9/4/20.  Plaintiff
alleges that shortly after the purchase, while putting on one of the pieces of
clothing, the manufacturer’s tag/label came loose and cut Plaintiff’s eye
causing serious and permanent injury.  As
a result on 8/24/22, Plaintiff filed this action against Macy’s and Calvin
Klein alleging various causes of action.
 
On 12/12/22, Macy’s electronically served Plaintiff with
Form Interrogatories, Set 1; Special Interrogatories, Set 1 and Requests for
Production of Documents, Set 1.  Due to
Plaintiff’s failure to serve responses to the discovery, Macy’s filed and
served motions to compel responses.  On
3/7/24, the Court ordered Plaintiff to serve responses within 10 days and ordered
Plaintiff and her attorneys, M&K Attorney, APC, to pay sanctions in the
amount of $1,475.00 within 30 days.  (See
3/7/24 Minute Order).  Plaintiff and her
attorneys have failed to comply with this Court’s 3/7/24 order to pay sanctions
to Macy’s and its attorneys.  (Hall Decl.
¶4)  
 
Therefore, on 5/1/24, Macy’s filed and served the instant
motion seeking an order granting terminating sanctions, striking one or all of
the pleadings of and entering judgment against Plaintiff.  Plaintiff has not opposed or otherwise
responded to the motion.
 
ANALYSIS
 
Macy’s seeks to impose terminating sanctions against
Plaintiff for Plaintiff’s and her counsel’s failure to pay monetary sanctions
imposed by the Court’s 3/7/24 order.  (See
Motion, p.2:3-6, p.3:18-19; Hall Decl. ¶4). 
However, “a terminating sanction issued solely because of a failure to
pay a monetary discovery sanction is never justified.”  See Newland (1995) 40 CA4th
608, 615. 
 
While the caption of the motion indicates that Macy’s
seeks terminating sanctions or contempt, the request for contempt sanctions is
not set forth in the body of the notice of the motion, nor is it supported in
the memorandum of points and authorities. 
(See Motion, p.1:25-p.2:9); CRC 3.1110(a).  As such, it is not clear against whom
contempt sanctions are sought.    Additionally, Macy’s has failed to establish
that either Plaintiff or her counsel have committed the type of willful
disobedience of the Court’s 3/7/24 order required to impose contempt sanctions.  Further, Macy’s has failed to follow the
strict procedures required for contempt proceedings which are quasi-criminal in
nature (i.e., personal service of an order to show cause issued by the court). 
 
It is not clear whether Macy’s is also seeking additional
monetary sanctions against Plaintiff and/or her counsel for filing this
motion.  The notice of motion and points
and authorities do not address such a request as required.  See CRC 3.1110(a); CRC 3.1113(b).  However, the declaration of counsel in
support of the motion requests $1,060.00 in sanctions against Plaintiff and her
counsel.  (See Hall Decl. ¶6).
 
CONCLUSION
 
The motion is denied.
