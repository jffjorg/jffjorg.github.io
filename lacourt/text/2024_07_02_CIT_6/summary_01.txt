And here is the summary in English text:

The Court's tentative ruling grants non-party Zeming Qi's motion to quash a deposition subpoena and/or for a protective order, but only as to records sought for Qi's account. The motion is denied as to records sought for Lightking America Technology, LTD. The Court finds that Qi has an objectively reasonable expectation of privacy in his bank records and that the lack of notice to consumer is sufficient grounds for quashing the subpoena. However, the Court notes that the Subpoena also seeks documents other than Qi's bank records, namely, those of Plaintiff Lightking America Technology (L.A.) LTD., and therefore will only grant the motion to quash as to Qi. Non-party Zeming Qi is ordered to give notice of the Court's ruling within five calendar days of this order.
