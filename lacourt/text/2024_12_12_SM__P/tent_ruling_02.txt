Kamson v. Breathless Group LLC,
Case no. 23SMCV01170
Hearing date December 12, 2024
Defendants
Hagopian and Dozier’s Motions to Vacate Defaults
Plaintiff
Kamson sued defendants Breathless Group LLC, Hagopian, Weinerman, Ho and Dozier
for breach of contract and fraud. Default was entered against Dozier 7/13/23
and Hagopian on 10/3/23. Defendants Dozier and Hagopian, in pro per, moved on
9/16/24 to set aside the defaults under Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §473. Plaintiff
opposed. The court granted leave for defendants to file declarations regarding
service. Min. Order 11/20/24. 
Defendants
filed the declarations of Hagopian, Dozier and third-party Delano Clark on
12/2/24. 
Under
Cal. Code of Civ. Proc. §473(b), the court may set aside a dismissal taken
through “mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.” Relief under
§473 should be liberally granted because public policy favors resolution of
disputes on the merits, rather than through technical default. E.g., Fasuvi
v. Permatex, Inc. (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 681, 685.
Hagopian
declares service was ineffective, as the complaint and summons were served to
the former offices of her real estate broker and were not given to her. Decl.
Hagopian para. 4. Dozier declares he was moving at the time of service, and the
proof of service describes one of his hired movers, Clark, not Dozier himself.
Decl. Dozier paras. 5-8. Clark declares he received the notice intended for
Dozier, placed it in a moving van and forgot about it. Decl. Clark paras. 4-5.
These declarations under penalty of perjury demonstrate good cause to set aside
the defaults against defendants. Defendants’ motions to set aside the defaults
are GRANTED. Defendants to file responsive pleadings within 5 days.
