Rowley v. James, Case no. 21SMCV00336
Hearing date December 12, 2024
Defendant’s
Motion to Vacate 9/18/24 SMJ
Defendant
James moves to vacate plaintiff Rowley’s motion for summary judgment which the
court granted 9/18/24. Min. Order 9/18/24. Defendant argues he is party to a
previously executed settlement agreement and the court’s decision not to
enforce that settlement agreement constitutes a legal mistake under Cal. Code
Civ. Proc. §473(b). No opposition was filed.
Defendant’s
arguments are unavailing. The court has determined that defendant was neither
party nor intended beneficiary of the settlement agreement. Min. Order 11/18/24;
Min. Order 10/22/24; Min. Order 9/18/24. Plaintiff did not release his claims
against defendant. Defendant’s disagreement with the court’s findings does not
constitute legal mistake or any other grounds to overturn the court’s 9/18/24
decision.
Defendant’s
motion to vacate the court’s 9/18/24 grant of summary judgment is DENIED.
