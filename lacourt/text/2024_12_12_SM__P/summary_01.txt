And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, James, has moved to vacate the court's grant of summary judgment in favor of the plaintiff, Rowley. James argues that the court's decision not to enforce a previously executed settlement agreement constitutes a legal mistake under California Code of Civil Procedure ยง473(b). However, the court has determined that James was not a party or intended beneficiary of the settlement agreement and therefore did not release his claims against him. The defendant's disagreement with the court's findings does not constitute a legal mistake or any other grounds to overturn the court's decision. Therefore, James' motion to vacate the grant of summary judgment is denied.
