And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion for summary judgment filed by Creditors Adjustment Bureau, Inc. (Plaintiff) against Quantum Epigenetics Consulting, LLC, et al. (Defendants). The Plaintiff is seeking summary judgment on its complaint alleging breach of promissory note and unjust enrichment.

The judge finds that the Plaintiff has met its burden of proof on the first cause of action, breach of promissory note. The evidence shows that the Plaintiff loaned money to the Defendants, who failed to pay back the loan. The judge grants the motion for summary judgment on the first cause of action and awards the Plaintiff damages in the amount of $252,355.17.

The judge denies the motion for summary judgment on the second cause of action, unjust enrichment, as California law does not recognize unjust enrichment as a standalone cause of action. The second cause of action is also largely duplicative of the first. The motion for summary adjudication is denied as well.

The judge's tentative ruling will be reconsidered at a later date.
