 Case Number:  23NWCV03597    Hearing Date:   January 15, 2025    Dept:  C HAGOP BILEJIAN,

CASE NO.: 23NWCV03597

TENTATIVE ORDER
 
Defendant Jose Sanchez’s demurrer is OVERRULED. Defendant
Sanchez is to file an answer in 10 court days.
 
Moving party to give notice. 
 
This unlawful detainer action was filed by Plaintiff Hagop
Bilemjian, Trustee of The Bilemjian Family Revocable Living Trust (Plaintiff)
against Defendants Jose Sanchez and Melissa Gamez. 
 
Defendant Jose Sanchez (in pro per) generally demurs to the
entire complaint. 
 
The demurrer is procedurally defective. A demurrer must
distinctly specify the grounds upon which any of the objections to the
complaint are taken. If it fails to do so, it may be disregarded. (Code Civ.
Proc. § 430.60.) Moreover, each ground in a demurrer must be in a separate
paragraph and must state whether it applies to the entire complaint or to a
specified cause of action. (California Rules of Court, Rule 3.120(a).)
 
Defendant asserts that lost wages during COVID caused
Defendant to get behind on rent. However, Defendant does not present legal
arguments or reference Plaintiff’s complaint. Therefore, there is no legal
basis to sustain the demurrer. 
 
Accordingly, Defendant Jose Sanchez’s demurrer is OVERRULED.
