The defendant was not properly served with the summons and complaint, and he did not become aware of the case until his bank notified him of a levy on his bank accounts in August 2024. The defendant had not resided at the address where the summons was served since 2005, and he did not know anyone by the name of Jose Garcia, who was served with the summons. The court granted the motion to set aside the default, finding that the defendant was not properly served and had not had an opportunity to defend the action.
