(collectively, Defendants) move for an order striking Plaintiff Tawana Jean Cooper’s (Plaintiff) complaint pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16 (Anti-SLAPP Statute).BackgroundThis action arises out of proceedings between Plaintiff and Defendants in Orange County Superior Court, Case No. 30-2021-01237008-CU-WT-CJC. On September 3, 2024, Plaintiff (pro per) filed a verified complaint against Defendants in this Court. On October 14, 2024, Plaintiff filed a first amended verified complaint (FAC). Plaintiff alleges four causes of action: (1) forgery of handwriting, (2) forgery by passing or attempting to use forged documents, (3) intentional infliction of emotional distress, and (4) negligent infliction of emotional distress. Plaintiff states that in the previous action, Defendants attached a copy of an arbitration contract with Plaintiff’s name on it to file a demand for arbitration. (FAC, ¶ 68.)

Plaintiff’s writ of mandate filed to the State of California Fourth District, Division Three, challenging Judge Nathan Vu’s September 3, 2024, order denying Plaintiff’s motion to vacate a void order, dated November 4, 2024.Defendants’ request for judicial notice is GRANTED pursuant to Evidence Code section 452 subd. (d) as records of a court in this state.Legal StandardCode of Civil Procedure section 425.16 permits the court to strike causes of action arising from an act in furtherance of the defendant’s right of free speech or petition unless the plaintiff establishes that there is a probability that the plaintiff will prevail on the claim.In assessing a defendant’s Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16 special motion to strike (Anti-Slaap Motion), the Court must engage in a two-step process. (Shekhter v. Financial Indem. Co. (2001) 89 Cal.App.4th 141, 150.) First, the court must decide whether the defendant has met the threshold burden of showing that the plaintiff’s cause of action arises from the defendant’s constitutional rights of free speech or petition for redress of grievances. (Id.) This burden may be met by showing the act which forms the basis for the plaintiff’s cause of action was an act that falls within one of the four categories of conduct set forth in section 425.16(e).Once a defendant has met its initial burden and established that the anti-SLAPP statute applies, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to demonstrate a “probability” of success on the merits. (Code Civ. Proc., § 425.16(b); Equilon Enters. LLC v. Consumer Cause, Inc. (2002) 29 Cal.4th 53, 67.) “[T]he plaintiff must demonstrate that the complaint is both legally sufficient and supported by a sufficient prima facie showing of facts to sustain a favorable judgment if the evidence submitted by the plaintiff is credited.” (Matson v. Dvorak (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 539, 548 (internal quotations omitted).) At this “second stage of an anti-SLAPP hearing, the court may consider affidavits, declarations, and their equivalents if it is reasonably possible the proffered evidence set out in those statements will be admissible at trial. Conversely, if the evidence relied upon cannot be admitted at trial, because it is categorically barred or undisputed factual circumstances show inadmissibility, the court may not consider it in the face of an objection. If an evidentiary objection is made, the plaintiff may attempt to cure the asserted defect or demonstrate the defect is curable.” (Sweetwater Union High School Dist. v. Gilbane Building Co. (2019) 6 Cal.5th 931, 949.)The trial court properly considers the evidentiary submissions of both the plaintiff and the defendant, but it may not weigh the credibility or comparative strength of the evidence and must instead simply determine whether the plaintiff's evidence would, if believed by the trier of fact, be sufficient to result in a judgment for plaintiff. (McGarry v. Univ. of San Diego (2007) 154 Cal.App.4th 97, 108-09.) The Court “accepts as true the evidence favorable to the plaintiff and evaluates the defendant’s evidence only to determine if it has defeated that submitted by the plaintiff as a matter of law.” (Flatley v. Mauro (2006) 39 Cal.4th 299, 326.) Further, whether or not the evidence is in conflict in the context of a motion to strike under the Anti-SLAPP statute, if the plaintiff has presented a sufficient pleading and has presented evidence showing that a prima facie case will be established at trial, the plaintiff is entitled to proceed. (Moore v. Shaw (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 182, 193.) Only a minimal showing of merit is required. (Robinzine v. Vicory (2006) 143 Cal.App.4th 1416, 1421.)DiscussionFirst Prong: Protected ActivityDefendants argue that the entire FAC relies on a pending lawsuit which has been ordered into arbitration. Therefore, Defendants argue the FAC’s causes of actions arise out of Defendants’ protected activities in demanding arbitration.A moving party can satisfy its burden by showing: (1) statements were made before legislative, executive, or judicial proceedings, or made in connection with matters being considered in such proceedings; or (2) statements were made in a public forum, or other conduct in furtherance of the exercise of the constitutional rights of petition or free speech, in connection with issues of public interest. (Code Civ. Proc. § 425.16 subd. (e); Equillon Enterprises v. Consumer Cause, Inc. (2002) 29 Cal.4th 53, 66.)Here, Defendants argue that the causes of action are protected because they arise out of statements made in a judicial proceeding. The act of initiating a private arbitration is not a protected activity under the Anti-SLAPP. (Century 21 Chamberlain & Associates v. Haberman (2009) 173 Cal.App.4th 1, 8-9, (“Arbitration claims ... are not filed in courts and they do not initiate judicial proceedings.”).) However, here, the activity at issue is Defendants’ demand for arbitration pursuant to a Court’s order.In the parties’ proceedings in the Superior Court of Orange County, on August 1, 2022, the Court initially denied Defendants’ motion to compel arbitration without prejudice. (RJN, Exh. 2.) However, on April 4, 2023, the Court granted Defendants’ renewed motion to compel arbitration. (RJN, Exh. 3, Minute Order, 4/4/2023.) Plaintiff then filed a peremptory challenge, which was denied as untimely, and then filed various appeals of the order denying the peremptory peremptory challenge. (RJN, Exh. 6-8.) Plaintiff additionally filed a motion to vacate a void order, which was denied. (RJN, Exh. 9.)Plaintiff’s first cause of action is for “forgery of handwriting – violation of Cal. Penal Code § 470(b). Plaintiff alleges Defendants forged her handwriting on the arbitration contract. (FAC, ¶ 152.) The second cause of action is for “forgery by passing or attempting to use forged document” and alleges Defendants used the arbitration contract to defraud Plaintiff of her right to a trial. (FAC, ¶ 159.)Plaintiff’s third cause of action is for intentional infliction of emotional distress and alleges Defendants’ acts in committing forgery caused her emotional distress. (FAC, ¶ 167.) Plaintiff’s fourth cause of action is for negligent infliction of emotion distress and alleges the same. (FAC, ¶ 181.)A review of Plaintiff’s allegations demonstrate that Plaintiff filed the instant lawsuit as a result of Defendants’ filing a demand for arbitration with the AmericanArbitration Association (AAA) on August 23, 2024. Plaintiff states “[o]n or about August 23, 2024…Ms.Cooper was mentally, emotionally, and physically injured by Defendants when Ms. Cooper received a copy of Defendant’s Demand for Arbitration via email.” (FAC, ¶ 137.) Therefore, the Court finds that Plaintiff brings these causes of actions alleging forgery, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and negligent infliction of emotional distress in response to Defendants’ demand for arbitration made pursuant to a Court order. Accordingly, Defendants have met their burden of demonstrating that the FAC arises from a protected activity in demanding arbitration pursuant to a Court order.Second Prong: Probability of PrevailingAs Defendant has met the burden of demonstrating that at least portions of the first through fourth causes of action arise from protected activity, the burden now shifts to Plaintiff to establish a probability of succeeding on the merits.The absolute litigation privilege bars a civil action for damages for communications made in any judicial proceeding. (Civ. Code § 47.) As indicated, the allegations in the FAC arise out of Defendants’ demand for arbitration pursuant to a Court order. Statements made during or in connection with a judicial or official proceeding are privileged, whether or not the statements were made with malice, or other bad motive. (Silberg v. Anderson (1990) 50 Cal.3d 205.) “The litigation privilege is also relevant to the second step in the anti-SLAPP analysis in that it may present a substantive defense a plaintiff must overcome to demonstrate a probability of prevailing.” (Flatley v. Mauro (2006) 39 Cal.4th 299, 323.) Plaintiff is therefore barred from seeking civil damages arising out of Defendants’ protected actions in following a Court order.Defendants argue that Plaintiff’s FAC is entirely precluded by collateral estoppel because the allegations of forgery were addressed in the April 4, 2023, order by Judge Nathan Vu in the Orange County Superior Court. The Court notes that Plaintiff’s forgery allegations were already heard and ruled on by Judge Vu of the Orange County Superior Court. (RJN, Exh. 3.)In opposition, Plaintiff argues that this Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction to rule on this motion because of Plaintiff’s appeal. Plaintiff filed a notice of appeal on October 9, 2024, seeking to appeal this Court’s order denying her ex parte application for a temporary restraining order and order to show cause re: preliminary injunction to prevent the arbitration of Plaintiff’s claims. (Minute Order, 10/8/2024.) On December 19, 2024, the Court of Appeals granted Defendants’ motion to dismiss. On December 31, 2024, Plaintiff filed a petition for rehearing in the Court of Appeal, which the Court rejected. (Cooper Decl., ¶ 6.) Plaintiff intends to file a motion to vacate order of dismissal and reinstate appeal. (Cooper Decl., ¶ 6.)“An appeal from an order denying a preliminary injunction does not deprive the trial court of jurisdiction to proceed to try the case on the merits.” (MaJor v. Miraverde Homeowners Assn. (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 618, 623.) “If the moving party desires that the trial be stayed pending appeal, the party may first ask the trial court in its discretion to continue or stay the underlying proceedings until the appeal is decided…If the trial court denies a request to stay the underlying proceedings, the moving party may request the appellate court to stay them.” (Reed v. Superior Court (2001) 92 Cal.App.4th 448, 455, citing MaJor v. Miraverde Homeowners Assn., supra, 7 Cal.App.4th at 623.)Here, Plaintiff’s notice of appeal of the ex parte application did not automatically stay proceedings in this Court. Further, as Defendants argue in reply, Plaintiff has not moved for a stay in the Court pending appeal. Therefore, this Court has subject matter jurisdiction to hear this matter.Accordingly, Defendants’ special motion to strike the FAC pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16 is GRANTED. Plaintiff’s FAC is DISMISSED with PREJUDICE.Attorney’s FeesAs the prevailing party, Defendants are entitled to reasonable attorney’s fees, which may be requested in a separately noticed motion. (Code Civ. Proc. § 425.16(c)(1). “[A] prevailing defendant on a special motion to strike shall be entitled to recover his or her attorney’s fees and costs. (Id.) “Any SLAPP defendant who brings a successful motion to strike is entitled to mandatory attorney fees. (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1131.)Defendants indicate they intend to file a motion for attorney’s fees after the hearing on this motion.
