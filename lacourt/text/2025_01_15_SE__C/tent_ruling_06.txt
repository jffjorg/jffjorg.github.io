CASE NO.: 23NWCV03803  
HEARING: 01/15/2025
 
#9
TENTATIVE ORDER
 
Defendant Jose Magdaleno’s unopposed motion to set aside
default is GRANTED.
 
Moving party to give notice. 
 
Defendant Jose Magdaleno, individually and dba Number One
Auto Body Center dba Number One Auto Collision (Defendant) moves the Court for
an order setting aside the default entered against him on March 22, 2024, and
the default judgment entered on May 14, 2024.
 
Background
 
On November 28, 2023, Keystone Automotive Industries and LKQ
Lakenor Auto & Truck Salvage, Inc. (Plaintiffs) filed this breach of
contract action against Defendant. Plaintiffs allege two causes of action: (1)
breach of contract and (2) common counts. 
 
On September 17, 2024, together with this motion, Defendant
filed his answer to the complaint. 
 
On December 4, 2024, Plaintiffs filed an acknowledgement of
satisfaction of judgment. 
 
Legal Standard
 
When service of a summons has not resulted in actual notice
to a party in time to defend the action and a default or default judgment has
been entered, the party may serve and file a notice of motion to set aside the
default or default judgment and for leave to defend the action. (Code Civ.
Proc. § 473.5 subd. (a).)
 
Discussion
 
Defendant moves the Court for an order setting aside the
default entered against him on March 22, 2024, and the default judgment entered
on May 14, 2024. Defendant argues he was never served with a copy of the
summons and complaint in this action. This motion is unopposed.
 
Here, the proof of service shows the summons and complaint
were served via substitute service to Jose Garcia on December 9, 2023, at 6477
Dos Rios Rd, Downey, CA 90240. (Proof of Service, 12/14/2023.) However,
Defendant asserts that he has not resided at 6477 Dos Rios Rd, Downey, CA 90240
since 2005. (Magdaleno Decl., ¶ 9.) Defendant further states he does not know
anyone by the name of Jose Garcia. (Magdaleno Decl., ¶12.) Defendant became
aware of this case on August 30, 2024, when his bank notified him of the levy
on his bank accounts. (Magdaleno Decl., ¶ 13.) Therefore, the Court finds
Defendant was not properly served with the summons and complaint. 
 
Accordingly, Defendant’s unopposed motion to set aside
default is GRANTED.
