Background
 
This is a lemon law action. On January 1, 2023, Plaintiffs
filed this action against Defendants regarding their 2016 Ford Focus, VIN: 1FADP3KE5GL293769
(Subject Vehicle). Plaintiffs allege (1) violation of Song-Beverly Act – breach
of express warranty, (2) violation of the Song-Beverly Act section 1793.2, and
(3) negligent repair. 
 
Motions to Compel Further
 
On April 8, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a motion to compel
further responses to request for production, set one, and a motion to compel
further responses to special interrogatories, set one. 
 
On June 26, 2024, the Court heard these motions. The Court
granted in part Plaintiff’s motion to compel further responses to special
interrogatories, set one. Accordingly, Plaintiffs’ motion to compel further
responses to special interrogatories is MOOT.
 
As to Plaintiffs’ motion to compel further responses to
requests for production of documents, set one, the Court granted it in part,
denied it in part, mooted it in part, and continued it in part. As to the
portions continued, the Court ordered the parties to meet and confer and file a
joint statement within 20 days if there were outstanding issues for the Court
to hear. (Order/Ruling, 6/26/2024.) On August 30, 2024, during the hearing on
Defendant’s ex parte application, the Court continued Plaintiff’s motion to
compel further responses to requests for production of documents and noted that
the parties had not filed any joint statements. (Minute Order, 8/30/2024.) The
Court again ordered the parties to file a joint statement within 20 days
outlining the respective position of the parties regarding any unresolved
discovery issues. (Minute Order, 8/30/2024.) As of this date, no joint
statement has been filed. Accordingly, Plaintiff’s motion to compel further
responses to requests for product of documents, set one, is taken OFF CALENDAR.
 
Motion to Compel Vehicle Inspection
 
On August 22, 2024, Defendant moved to compel inspection of
Plaintiffs’ vehicle before September 2, 2024, or extending the deadline to
complete this inspection and its expert discovery. On August 30, 2024, pursuant
to Defendant’s ex parte application to advance the instant motion to compel
vehicle inspection, the Court advanced the hearing on this motion to January
15, 2025, and advanced the jury trial scheduled for October 4, 2024, to March
5, 2025. 
 
Legal Standard
 
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.010 subd.
(c), “[a] party may demand that any other party produce and permit the party
making the demand, or someone acting on the demanding party's behalf,
to inspect and to photograph, test, or sample any tangible things that are in
the possession, custody, or control of the party on whom the demand is made.”
 
Discussion
 
Defendant moves to compel inspection of the Subject Vehicle.
 
On November 9, 2023, Plaintiffs provided two dates in
January of 2024 for a vehicle inspection. (Segararini-Jeffries Decl., ¶ 2.)
These dates conflicted with Defendant’s expert’s availability and the parties
met and conferred regarding alternative dates. (Segararini-Jeffries Decl., ¶
3.) On May 17, 2024, and again on June 20, 2024, Defendant requested
Plaintiffs’ availability but did not receive responses. (Segararini-Jeffries
Decl., ¶¶ 4-5.) On July 31, 2024, Defendant served Plaintiffs with a notice of
vehicle inspection for August 30, 2024. (Segararini-Jeffries Decl., ¶¶ 8-11.)
Plaintiffs did not respond nor attend the inspection. (Segararini-Jeffries
Decl., ¶ 11.)
 
On January 2, 2025, Counsel for Plaintiffs, Armando Lopez
(Lopez), submitted a declaration stating that he met and conferred with
Defendant’s counsel and the parties agreed to a vehicle inspection date on
January 29, 2025. (Lopez Decl., ¶ 3.) Lopez states Plaintiffs do not oppose
Defendant’s right to vehicle inspection. (Lopez Decl., ¶ 5.) Lopez requested Defendant’s
counsel continue this hearing to a date after the scheduled inspection of
January 29, 2025, if there are any outstanding issues. (Lopez Decl., ¶ 4.) 
 
Here, the Court finds Plaintiffs do not oppose Defendant’s
right to a vehicle inspection and have already scheduled a date. Accordingly,
the Court CONTINUES the hearing on this matter to a date after the scheduled
vehicle inspection. Defendant’s motion to compel vehicle inspection is
CONTINUED to February 5, 2025, at 10:30 AM in Department C at Norwalk
Courthouse.
