CASE NO.: 22NWCV00913

TENTATIVE ORDER
 
Defendant Subway Restaurants, LLC’s motion for summary
judgment is DENIED. 
 
Moving party to give notice. 
 
Defendant Subway Restaurants, LLC (Defendant or SRL) moves
the Court for an order granting summary judgment pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure Section 437c.
 
Background
 
This product liability action was filed by Plaintiff Karina
Lopez (Plaintiff) on September 29, 2022. On October 31, 2023, a first amended
complaint (FAC) was filed. On August 12, 2024, a second amended complaint (SAC)
was filed. 
 
The SAC alleges that on May 31, 2021, Plaintiff was dining
at Subway Restaurant, located at 4070 Tweedy Boulevard, Suite A, South Gate, CA
90280 (Subject Premises). Plaintiff alleges that when she went to sit on a
chair, it collapsed and she fell onto the floor. (SAC ¶ 11.) As a result,
Plaintiff sustained injuries. (SAC ¶ 11.) Defendant Foldcraft Co. manufactured
the chair. The SAC asserts causes of action for (1) strict products liability;
(2) breach of express and implied warranties; (3) negligence based on defective
product; (4) negligence and premises liability; and (5) negligence based on violation
of OSHA Regulations. Specifically, against SRL, the SAC alleges the first cause
of action for strict liability - count three failure to warn, and the fourth
cause of action for negligence and premises liability.
 
SRL filed the instant motion for summary judgment on April
9, 2024. On August 8, 2024, the Court continued this motion because it found
good cause to conduct essential discovery relevant to the opposition.
 
Evidentiary Objections
 
Defendants object to Paragraphs 1 through 29 in Plaintiff’s
undisputed material facts.
          Paragraphs 1
through 15: overruled.
          Paragraph 16
through 29: overruled.
          
Plaintiff objects to portions of the Declaration of Kristine
Zaniewski.
          
Page 2, Paragraph 3, Lines 3-4: overruled.
Page 2, Paragraph 5, Lines 9-11:
overruled.
Page 2, Paragraph 6, Lines 12-14:
overruled.
Page 2, Paragraph 7, Lines 15-16:
overruled.
Page 2, Paragraph 8, Lines 17-19:
overruled.
 
On November 4, 2024, Plaintiff filed a supplemental
opposition to SRL’s motion for summary judgment in which she argues that
Kristine Zaniewski does not have personal knowledge because she does not work
for SRL, but rather for Defendant Franchise World Headquarters. However, there
is no requirement that an individual must be a direct employee to have personal
knowledge regarding a subject matter. 
 
Undisputed Material Facts
 
On September 22, 2022, Plaintiff filed a complaint against SRL
seeking compensatory damages for her injuries sustained when her chair
collapsed while dining at the Subject Premises. (UMF, ¶ 1.) On September 26,
2023, the Court granted SRL’s demurrer dismissing four causes of action against
SRL. (UMF, ¶ 2.) The FAC alleged a single cause of action against SRL,
Plaintiff’s fourth cause of action. (UMF, ¶ 3.)
 
Legal Standard
 
The function of a motion for summary judgment or
adjudication is to allow a determination as to whether an opposing party cannot
show evidentiary support for a pleading or claim and to enable an order of
summary dismissal without the need for trial. (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield
Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.) Code of Civil Procedure section 437c subd.
(c) “requires the trial judge to grant summary judgment if all the evidence
submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence’ and uncontradicted
by other inferences or evidence, show that there is no triable issue as to any
material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of
law.” (Adler v. Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.)
“The function of the pleadings in a motion for summary judgment is to delimit
the scope of the issues; the function of the affidavits or declarations is to
disclose whether there is any triable issue of fact within the issues delimited
by the pleadings.” (Juge v. County of Sacramento (1993) 12 Cal.App.4th
59, 67, citing FPI Development, Inc. v. Nakashima (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d
367, 381-382.)
 
In moving for summary judgment, a defendant has the “burden
of showing that a cause of action has no merit if the party has shown that one
or more elements of the cause of action, even if not separately pleaded, cannot
be established, or that there is a complete defense to the cause of action.” (Code
Civ. Proc. § 437c subd. (p)(2).)
 
Once a moving party has satisfied the initial burden of
proof, the burden “shifts to the opposing party to show, by responsive separate
statement and admissible evidence, that triable issues of fact exist.” (Ostayan
v. Serrano Reconveyance Co. (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 1411, 1418, disapproved
on other grounds by Black Sky Cap., LLC v. Cobb (2019) 7 Cal.5th 156,
165. To establish a triable issue of material fact, the party opposing the
motion must produce substantial responsive evidence. (Sangster v. Paetkau
(1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 151, 166.)
 
An issue of damages must dispose
of an entire cause of action. (DeCastro
West Chodorow & Burns, Inc. v. Superior Court (1996) 47 Cal.App.4th
410, 422.) Summary adjudication as to punitive damages is proper only if a
reasonable jury could not find clear and convincing proof of malice, fraud or
oppression. (Johnson & Johnson v.
Superior Court (2011) 192 Cal.App.4th 757, 762.)
 
Summary judgment must be granted “if all the evidence
submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence’ and
uncontradicted by other inferences or evidence, show that there is no triable
issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment
as a matter of law.” (Adler v. Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th
1110, 1119.)
 
Discussion
 
SRL moves for summary judgment on the grounds that there is
no triable issue as to any material fact and that it is entitled to a judgment
as a matter of law.
 
SRL argues Plaintiff’s negligence and premises liability cause
of action against Defendant must fail because (1) SRL did not own, operate,
maintain, or control the Subject Premises and (2) SRL did not owe a duty to
Plaintiff.
 
“The elements of a cause of action for premises liability
are the same as those for negligence: duty, breach, causation, and damages.” (Castellon v. U.S. Bancorp (2013) 220
Cal.App.4th 994, 998.) “Premises liability is grounded in the possession of the
premises and the attendant right to control and manage the premises.” (Kesner v. Superior Court (2016) 1
Cal.5th 1132, 1158, quotation marks omitted.)
 
SRL argues that Plaintiff cannot prove the duty element of
negligence. SRL asserts it did not owe a duty to Plaintiff to maintain or
repair the chair in the Subject Premises because it did not own, lease, occupy,
or control the Subject Premises. SRL references “Exhibit D, Declaration of Anne
Jasorkowski” in support of its arguments. However, the Court does not find any Declaration
of Anne Jasorkowski. 
 
Here, because Defendant only relies on this Declaration of
Anne Jasorkowski and the pleadings as evidence, Defendant has not met its evidentiary
burden under Code of Civil Procedure section 437c subd. (p)(2). The burden does
not shift to Plaintiff to show that a triable issue of material fact does
exist. 
 
Accordingly, Defendant’s motion for summary judgment is
DENIED.
