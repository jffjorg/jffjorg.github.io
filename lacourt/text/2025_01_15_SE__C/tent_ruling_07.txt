TENTATIVE ORDER
 
Defendant Marelin Rodriguez’s unopposed demurrer to the
complaint is SUSTAINED with 20 days LEAVE TO AMEND.
 
Moving party to give notice. 
 
Defendant Marelin Rodriquez (Rodriguez) demurs to the second
cause of action in Plaintiffs Jose Ricardo Barbarini-Cobian and Brenda
Osornio’s (Plaintiffs) complaint on the grounds that it fails to state facts
sufficient to constitute a cause of action.
 
Background
 
On February 29, 2024, Plaintiffs filed this action arising
out of a motor vehicle accident. Plaintiffs allege two causes of action: (1)
negligence against Defendants Andrew Darren Garcia (Garcia) and Stacy Quoshena (Quoshena)
and (2) declaratory relief against Rodriguez. Plaintiffs allege that on
February 14, 2023, Defendants Garcia and Quoshena, owners and drivers of a black
2021 Nissan Rogue, collided into Plaintiffs’ vehicle on Alondra Blvd,
Bellflower, California. (Complaint, ¶ 7.) Plaintiffs allege Rodriquez was a
passenger in Garcia and Quoshena’s vehicle. (Complaint, ¶ 15.) Plaintiffs
sustained injuries, severe fright, shock, and pain as a result of the
collision. (Complaint, ¶ 8.)
 
On April 3, 2024, Rodriguez filed a cross-complaint for
negligence against Jorge Barbarini, Cindy Cruz, Andrew Darren Garcia, and Stacy
Quoshena. 
 
Meet and Confer
 
 “Before filing a
demurrer pursuant to this chapter, the demurring party shall meet and confer in
person or by telephone with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to
demurrer for the purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached that
would resolve the objections to be raised in the demurrer.” (Code Civ. Proc. §
430.41 subd. (a).)
 
Rodriguez’s counsel emailed Plaintiff’s counsel on March 20,
2024, her intentions to demur to the complaint and legal basis for doing so.
(Hoonanian Decl., ¶ 3.) Plaintiff’s counsel did not respond. (Hoonanian Decl., ¶
3.)
 
Legal Standard
 
A demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the complaint
states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740,
747.) In a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of the
pleading or via proper judicial notice. (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co.
(2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) In assessing a demurrer, the court “treat[s]
the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded, but not
contentions, deductions or conclusions of law.” (Blank v. Kirwan (1985)
39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) “The only issue involved in a demurrer hearing is whether
the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous matters, states a
cause of action.” (Hahn v. Mirda, supra, at p. 747.) A complaint
will be upheld against a demurrer if it pleads facts sufficient to place the
defendant on notice of the issues sufficient to enable the defendant to prepare
a defense. (Doe v. City of Los Angeles (2007) 42 Cal.4th 531,
549-50.) 
 
“Generally it is an abuse of discretion to sustain a
demurrer without leave to amend if there is any reasonable possibility that the
defect can be cured by amendment.” (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d
335, 349.) 
 
Discussion
 
Rodriguez demurs to the cause of action for declaratory
relief asserted against her on the grounds that it fails to state facts
sufficient to constitute a cause of action. 
 
“To qualify for declaratory relief, a party would have to
demonstrate its action presented two essential elements: (1) a proper subject
of declaratory relief, and (2) an actual controversy involving justiciable
questions relating to the party’s rights or obligations.” (Jolley v. Chase Home Finance, LLC (2013) 213 Cal.App.4th 872, 909,
quotation marks and brackets omitted.) A cause of action for declaratory relief
should not be used as a second cause of action for the determination of
identical issues raised in another cause of action. (General of America Insurance Co. v. Lilly (1968) 258 Cal.App.2d
465, 470.) “The availability of another form of relief that is adequate will
usually justify refusal to grant declaratory relief.” (California Insurance Guarantee Association v. Superior Court (1991)
231 Cal.App.3d 1617, 1624.)
 
Here, the Court finds that Plaintiffs’ second cause of
action for declaratory relief fails to allege a controversy relating to
Plaintiffs’ rights or obligations. The complaint alleges Rodriquez was a
passenger in the vehicle driven by Garcia and Quoshena. (Complaint, ¶ 15.) The
complaint alleges that Rodriguez asserts a claim for damages against Garcia and
Quoshena and that a controversy has arisen between Plaintiffs and Rodriguez
over the monetary recovery from Garcia and Quoshena. (Complaint, ¶¶ 16-17.) However,
as Rodriguez argues, Plaintiffs do not provide any facts demonstrating a
controversy between Plaintiffs and Rodriguez over the monetary recovery. Additionally,
there are no separate allegations that Rodriguez caused Plaintiffs’ injuries.
 
Moreover, Plaintiffs request the Court determine Plaintiffs’
“damages based on their injuries and incurred medical expenses as a result of
this incident.” (Complaint, ¶ 15.) This request for declaratory relief seeks
the same evaluation of damages as the negligence cause of action against Garcia
and Quoshena. Therefore, Plaintiffs’ second cause of action does not allege an
independent basis to sustain a cause of action for declaratory relief against
Rodriguez.
 
Accordingly, Defendant Marelin Rodriguez’s unopposed
demurrer to the complaint is SUSTAINED with 20 days LEAVE TO AMEND.
