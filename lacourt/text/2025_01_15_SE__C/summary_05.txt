And here is the English text summary:

This tentative ruling by Judge Hagop Bilejian holds that Defendant Jose Sanchez's demurrer is overruled. The demurrer was filed in response to the unlawful detainer action brought by Plaintiff Hagop Bilemjian, Trustee of the Bilejian Family Revocable Living Trust, against Defendants Jose Sanchez and Melissa Gamez. The demurrer was found to be procedurally defective, failing to specify the grounds upon which the objections to the complaint are taken. Furthermore, each ground in a demurrer must be in a separate paragraph and must state whether it applies to the entire complaint or to a specified cause of action. In this case, the demurrer lacked legal basis to sustain it, and Defendant Jose Sanchez is ordered to file an answer in 10 court days.
