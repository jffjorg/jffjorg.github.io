[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING IN PART DEFENDANT
PEACE APOSTOLIC CHURCH, INC.’S MOTION TO STRIKE, OR ALTERNATIVELY, TO TAX COSTS
REQUESTED BY PLAINTIFFS MICHAEL BUCK and JOHN GONZALES.
[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING IN PART DEFENDANT TAMARA
SWANCY’S MOTION TO TAX COSTS REQUESTED BY PLAINTIFFS MICHAEL BUCK and JOHN
GONZALES.
 
I. BACKGROUND
The complaint filed on April 20, 2021,
alleges that Plaintiffs, Michael Buck, and John Gonzales (“Plaintiffs”), are
members and leaders of the Peace Apostolic Church, Inc. (the “Church”).
Plaintiffs allege that after the death of the Church’s pastor, the Church’s de
facto officers or directors, Tamara Swancy-Prince (“Prince”) and Priscilla
Woods Brown (“Brown”), improperly spent church funds and engaged in other
misconduct. Plaintiffs allege that Defendants refuse to permit Plaintiffs to
inspect corporate records. This matter was tried to a jury which rendered an
award in favor of Plaintiffs. The Court determined the equitable claims as set
for in the Statement of Decision entered on March 8, 2024.
On March 19, 2024, Plaintiffs filed their
Memorandum of Costs. On April 5, 2024, the Church filed its Motion to Tax
Costs. On April 5, 2024, Prince filed her Motion to Tax Costs. 
On April 8, 2024, Brown filed Notice of
Joinder in the Church’s motion. 
On April 9, 2024, Plaintiffs filed their
opposition to the Church’s motion. 
On April 26, 2024, Plaintiffs filed their
opposition to Prince’s motion by incorporating by reference their opposition to
the motion filed by the Church. 
On May 2, 2024, the Church and Prince
filed their reply papers. 
Because the motions filed by the Church and
Prince are substantively identical in their arguments and because Plaintiffs
opposed Prince’s motion by incorporating by reference their opposition to the
motion filed by the Church, the Court will address the Church’s motion here
although it applies to Prince’s motion also. 
II. MOTION TO TAX PLAINTIFF’S COSTS
The Church argues that Plaintiffs are not the prevailing party and the
Court 
should strike the Memorandum in its entirety.[1]
Alternatively, the Court should tax certain categories because Plaintiffs seek
recovery of costs that are not allowable pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 1033, are not reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation and
are not reasonable in amount under Code of Civil Procedure sections
1033.5(c)(2) and (c)(3). 
III. LEGAL STANDARD
A prevailing party may recover costs as a matter of
right. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1032 subd. (b).) A prevailing party is defined as
“the party with a net monetary recovery, a defendant in whose favor a dismissal
is entered, a defendant where neither plaintiff nor defendant obtains any
relief, and a defendant as against those plaintiffs who do not recover any
relief against that defendant. If any party recovers other than monetary relief
and in situations other than as specified, the ‘prevailing party’ shall be as
determined by the court, and under those circumstances, the court, in its
discretion, may allow costs or not and, if allowed, may apportion costs between
the parties on the same or adverse sides pursuant to rules adopted under
Section 1034." (Code Civ. Proc., § 1032 subd. (a)(4).) 
The losing party may
dispute any or all of the items in the prevailing party’s memorandum of costs
by a motion to strike or tax costs. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1700(b).)
Verification of the memorandum of costs by the prevailing party’s attorney
establishes a prima facie showing that the claimed costs are proper. (Jones
v. Dumrichob (1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 1258, 1267.) To overcome that prima
facie showing, the objecting party must introduce evidence to support its claim
that the claimed costs were not reasonably necessary to carry out the
litigation. (Rappenecker v. Sea-Land Service, Inc. (1979) 93 Cal.App.3d
256, 266.) 
“Allowable costs shall be reasonably
necessary to the conduct of the litigation rather than merely convenient or
beneficial to its preparation.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (c)(2).) “Allowable costs shall be reasonable in amount.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (c)(3).) 
 
 
IV. EVIDENTIARY OBJECTIONS
A trial court may decline to rule
on evidence that is not material to the disposition of the motion. 
V. DISCUSSION
a.      
Timeliness of Motion 
“Any
notice of motion to strike or to tax costs must be served and filed 15 days
after service of the cost memorandum. If the cost memorandum was served by mail
or email, the period is extended as provided in Code of Civil Procedure section
1013.”¿ (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1700(b)(1).)¿
Here,
Plaintiffs served their Memorandum of Costs to the Church on March 19, 2024,
via email. 15 days plus two court days places the deadline for this motion on April
5, 2024, the date this motion was served and filed. The motion is therefore
timely.[2]
 
b.     
Prevailing Party 
The Church first contends that Plaintiffs are not the prevailing party in
this litigation 
and the Court should strike Plaintiffs’ Memorandum of Costs in its
entirety.[3] 
 The Court addressed this issue on May 3, 2024, in its Minute Order
regarding 
Plaintiffs’ motion to tax the Church’s costs.  In granting Plaintiffs’ motion, the Court
stated in relevant part:
The
special verdict found in favor of Plaintiffs on the intentional
misrepresentation claim and awarded damages of $44,500.00 to Plaintiff, John
Gonzales, and $135,000 to Plaintiff, Michael Buck. (Verdict filed 12/14/23.)
The jury found in favor of both Plaintiffs on the concealment claim and awarded
$20,000 to each Plaintiff. (Id.) The Church did not file a
cross-complaint against Plaintiffs. As the parties with a net monetary
recovery, Plaintiffs are the prevailing parties and are entitled to recover
costs as a matter of right. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1032, subd. (b).)  
(Minute Order 05/03/24.) 
Based on the foregoing, the Court will
not strike Plaintiffs’ Memorandum in its entirety as requested by the Church.  
c.       Challenged Costs 
The
Church objects to section 1 (filing and motions fees); section 4 (deposition
costs); section 5 (service of process); section 11 (court reporter fees);
section 12 (models, enlargement, photocopies); and section 16 (other: trial
travel costs, trial transcript fees, and mediation fees) of the Memorandum of
Costs.
Section
1 (filing and motions fees)
              The Church challenges $484.94 for courtesy copies
because the documents were e-filed and there is no evidence that the filings
were necessary. (Motion, p. 11.) Plaintiffs only address one of the courtesy
copies that the Church takes issue with, which concerns Plaintiffs’ request for
a preliminary injunction and were required to be filed under seal with courtesy
copies. (Opp., pp. 6-7.) Plaintiffs do not explain how the other charges
($270.55) for courtesy copies were necessary. The Court therefore finds that $270.55
should be taxed and Defendants’ request is GRANTED. 
The
Church also challenges $51.45 in filing fees related to the original August
2023 trial date because trial was continued to accommodate opposing counsel’s
vacation scheduled.  (Motion, p. 11.)  Defendants are correct. The continuance was
granted in order to accommodate Plaintiffs’ counsel’s vacation.  Plaintiffs do not and cannot justify this expense.
The Court therefore finds that $51.45 should be taxed and the request is
GRANTED. 
Lastly,
the Church challenges $162.70 for attorney David Oberg’s Pro Hac Vice admission
because Mr. Oberg’s admission was not reasonably necessary to the conduct of
the litigation.[4] (Id.) In opposition, Plaintiffs
attempt to argue that Mr. Oberg’s pro hac vice application was necessary
because Defendants had four attorneys at trial and because the filing fee
associated with the pro hac vice application were only incurred as a result of
Defendants’ opposition to the request. (Opp., p. 7.) The Court does not find
the number of attorneys representing Defendants to be relevant to the
reasonableness of the pro hac vice fees. Further, the Court finds that
Plaintiffs have not met their responsive burden as Plaintiffs merely state the
fees were incurred because of Defendants’ opposition. Mr. Oberg did not
participate in the trial at all. Plaintiffs do not actually explain how the pro
hac vice fees were reasonable. The Court therefore finds that $162.70 in pro
hac vice fees should be taxed. The request is GRANTED. 
 
              Section
4 (Deposition Costs)
The
Church challenges $6,202.80 in costs associated with the depositions of Hugo
Morales, Marcel Haymond, and Plaintiffs’ expert because of their “pointless
taking.” (Motion, p. 12.) As to the deposition of Morales, the Church contends
it was an “unreasonable ‘fishing expedition’”; and as to the deposition of
Haymond, the Church contends it relates “SOLELY to plaintiff’s unsuccessful
attempt to establish phantom articles of incorporation and to (unsuccessful)
establish Plaintiff Buck as a director.” (Id.) The Court finds that the
Church cannot reasonably challenge the deposition costs associated with Morales
and Haymond. 
As
to the deposition of Plaintiffs’ expert, who was deemed unqualified and
excluded from testifying at trial, the Church contends that Plaintiffs’
counsel, was “aware this expert inappropriately relied on counsel’s and
Plaintiffs’ accounts…and did not review necessary documents to formulate
opinions.” (Id.) In opposition, Plaintiffs argue that “even though the
Court ultimately precluded Plaintiffs’ expert from testifying, these costs were
reasonably necessary for framing the issues for trial and presenting Plaintiffs’
case to the jury.” (Opp. p. 8.) The Church argues in reply that Plaintiffs’
expert was excluded because of the unprofessional conduct of Plaintiffs and
their attorneys. (Reply, pp. 6-7.)  Plaintiffs’
expert was unprepared and did not provide proper documentation for his
deposition. (Id.) The Court finds that Plaintiffs have failed to meet
their responsive burden. Plaintiffs do not explain how the fees were reasonable
and necessary besides making a conclusory statement that the expenses “were
reasonably necessary for framing the issues for trial and presenting
Plaintiffs’ case to the jury.” This was a highly contentious case involving
numerous issues, but it is unclear whether Plaintiffs are referring to all
issues or certain issues. Further, Plaintiffs do not address the reasons for
the exclusion of the expert besides stating, “the Court ultimately precluded
Plaintiffs’ expert from testifying.” It is unclear from Plaintiffs’ response
whether the expert’s exclusion was the result of a mere mistake on Plaintiffs’
end or something else. Therefore, the Court finds that Plaintiffs failed to
explain how deposition costs associated with their expert were reasonably
necessary. The Court therefore finds that $1,898.35 in deposition costs for Plaintiffs’
own expert should be taxed. The request is GRANTED as to this amount. 
Next,
the Church challenges $465.35 in deposition costs for Primerica, Bank of
America, and Equitable because they are without foundational information and depositions
were not taken. (Motion, p. 12.) In opposition, Plaintiffs make arguments about
the costs related to service of process; Plaintiffs do not explain how these
charges were reasonably necessary to the conduct of litigation or reasonable in
amount. (Opp., p. 8.) The Court therefore finds that $465.35 in deposition
costs for Primerica, Bank of America, and Equitable should be taxed. The
request is GRANTED.
Section
5 (Service of Process)
The
Church challenges $5,572.86 in services of process costs. 
First,
the Church challenges $202.25 in costs for the subpoena of documents to Chava
Marble & Tile, “which plaintiffs knew was frivolous, not reasonably
necessary to the conduct of the litigation and therefore not reasonable in
amount as plaintiffs knew Mr. Morales made wildly unreliable claims that were
quickly proven to be wholly without merit.” (Motion, p. 12.) The Court finds
that the Church cannot reasonably challenge the service of process costs for
the subpoena of documents to Chava Marble & Tile. The request is DENIED. 
Second,
the Church challenges $107.75 for the subpoena of Wells Fargo documents because
these costs were not reasonably necessary as there were no documents. (Motion,
p. 13.) The Church also challenges $435.50 for subpoena to American Express on
August 9 and August 11, 2022, with an already existing subpoena dated July 22,
2022. (Id.) Plaintiffs contend that although the parties stipulated that
the Bank of America and American Express subpoenas would be unnecessary, “that
was while meeting and conferring to resolve objections to the joint exhibit
list and after the Plaintiffs had initially issued the trial subpoenas.” (Opp.,
p. 9.) The Court finds that Plaintiffs’ request to stipulate could have been
made prior to issuing the subpoenas and that Plaintiffs have failed to address
how the costs were necessary. The Court therefore finds that $107.75 for costs
related to the subpoena of Wells Fargo documents and $435.50 for subpoena to
American Express should be taxed. The requests are GRANTED as to these amounts.
Third,
the Church challenges $215.50 for subpoenas for documents from BNY Mellon on
September 2, 2022; $221.45 for subpoenas to Citizen Bank on November 14, 2022;
and $534.86 for subpoenas for Bank of America records on December 19, 2022.
(Motion, p. 13.) The Church contends that there were already existing subpoenas
and there is no justification for the multiple subpoenas that were months
apart. (Id.) Plaintiffs fail to address this in opposition. Therefore,
the Court finds that $215.50 for subpoenas for documents from BNY Mellon,
$221.45 for subpoenas to Citizen Bank, and $534.86 for subpoenas for Bank of
America records should be taxed. The requests are GRANTED as to these amounts.
Fourth,
the Church challenges $187.10 for costs related to the service of Notice to
Consumer to Martin Prince re Palmdale School District documents because the
Notice did not have to be personally served as it could have been served on
counsel since Prince is an employee of the Church. (Motion, p. 13.) In
opposition, Plaintiffs states, “[t]he Church also claims that personal service
on nonparty Palmdale School District ‘was not required or necessary and could
have been made on PAC counsel either by mail or electronically.’” (Opp., p. 9.)
Plaintiffs then state, “it is unclear how the Church would have had the
authority to accept service of a subpoena for production of documents on a
nonparty like the Palmdale School District.” (Id.) The Church is arguing
about personal service on Prince; it is not arguing about personal service on a
nonparty. The Court finds that Plaintiffs’ opposition fails to address this.
The Court therefore finds that $187.10 for costs related to the service of
Notice to Consumer to Martin Prince re Palmdale School District documents
should be taxed. The request is GRANTED. 
Lastly, the Church challenges the following costs, which Plaintiffs fail
to address in opposition. The Church challenges $503.80 for service of Declarations to
Appoint Receiver, arguing that “[i]t is unclear who was served or why they were
personally served or why a form of mail would not have been used.” (Motion, p.
13.) The Church challenges $360.00 for two subpoenas to Palmdale School
District on the same day, arguing that “[i]t is unclear what records were
produced especially since PAC counsel produced all requested Palmdale documents
to plaintiffs.” (Motion, p. 14.) The Church challenges $350.00 for an
unidentified Deposition Subpoena on July 31, 2022, arguing that “Plaintiffs
have not provided any information to justify this as a cost authorized by
statute.” (Id.) The Church challenges $729.55 for five Trial Subpoena
and $957.75 for service of Trial subpoenas on August 11, 2023, both for the
August 2, 2023, trial date, arguing that the trial was continued to accommodate
opposing counsel’s vacation plans. (Id.) Lastly, the Church challenges
$767.35 for Trial Subpoena for the December 2023, arguing that “Martin Pince,
Natale Lamb and Andre Lamb were employees of PAC and did not require personal
service. Notices to Appear would have been sufficient pursuant to CCP 1987(b)
and (c).” (Id.) The Court finds the Church’s objection meritorious. The
Court therefore finds that it should tax all the costs that Plaintiffs failed
to respond to in the opposition. These costs total $3,668.45. The request is
GRANTED as to this amount.  
Section
11 (Court Reporter Fees)
“Court reporter fees as established by statute” are expressly
recoverable. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (a)(11).) The Church challenges $11,455.43 in costs for court reporter
fees because costs relating to court reporter fees are not ordered by the Court.
(Motion, p. 15.) The Church, however, cites the
statute governing transcripts of court proceedings: section 1033.5, subdivision
(b)(5). Thus, the Church mistakes allowable reporter fees for transcript fees,
and therefore fails to satisfy its initial burden. The request is DENIED. 
Section
12 (Models, Enlargement, Photocopies)
Models and enlargements of exhibits and photocopies of exhibits
may be allowed if they were reasonably helpful to aid the trier of fact. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (a)(13).)
The Church challenges $1,512.64 or $1,713.44 for exhibit binders,
arguing that it is unclear whether the exhibit binders are separate and
distinct from the trial notebooks, and the summary shows $1,512.64 while the worksheet identifies
a cost of $1,713.33. (Motion, pp. 14-15.) In opposition, however, Plaintiffs
clarify that Plaintiffs are only seeking to recover $1,512.64
for costs from copying the exhibit binders, which Plaintiffs’ counsel prepared
for the Court, the witnesses, and the jury, among others. Further, Plaintiffs
state this amount is solely related to printing the exhibit binders. (Opp., p.
10.) The Court finds that Plaintiffs have satisfied their responsive burden. The
request is DENIED. 
 
Section
16 (Other: Trial Travel Costs, Trial Transcript Fees, and Mediation Fees)
1.     
Trial Technician/Trial Equipment 
Electronic
presentations of exhibits including costs of rental equipment and electronic
formatting may be allowed if they were reasonably helpful to aid the trier of
fact. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (a)(13).)
The
Church challenges $2,178.00 for costs related to preparing video experts to
play at trial, arguing that Plaintiffs used no excerpts from any depositions at
trial and the descriptions of the services provided are vague and lack
specificity because the Memorandum includes a separate charge of $3,438.00 for
“Litigation Services and Tech Support.” (Motion, pp. 16-17.) The Church cites Segal
v. ASICS America Corp (2022) 50 Cal.App. 5th 659 in support of its argument
that costs related to unused demonstratives are not categorically recoverable.
(Id.) However, as Plaintiffs point out, the court in Segal found:

In our view, interpretation of section
1033.5, subdivision (a)(13) must reflect the reality of how complicated cases
are tried. As the Benach and Applegate courts acknowledged, prudent counsel
must prepare exhibits and demonstratives well in advance of trial. Given that
trials are unpredictable, however, it is difficult for even the most
experienced trial lawyers to divine which exhibits and demonstratives will in
fact be used. Consequently, it is in counsels’ (and their clients’) interests
to come to trial with copies of all exhibits and demonstratives reasonably
anticipated for use in hand.
(Segal v. ASICS America
Corp. (2022) 50 Cal.App.5th 659, 666) The Segal court also stated:
Counsel’s pretrial preparation of
exhibit photocopies and demonstratives reasonably anticipated for use at trial
expedites the proceedings. For example, it allows for efficient examination of
witnesses and facilitates prompt resolution of evidentiary issues. This is
especially important in lengthy jury trials, where common courtesy and respect
for the jurors’ time and sacrifice requires that courts adopt policies and
procedures to expedite the proceedings.
(Id.)
              The Court finds that the deposition excerpts, which
were not used at trial, were prepared in anticipation for use because
Plaintiffs could have used them for potential impeachment purposes at trial.
Also, Plaintiffs state, “many of the exhibits presented at trial were detailed
bank statements and lease agreements and having a trial technician assist with
displaying these exhibits assisted the jury and expedited the proceedings.”
(Opp., pp. 10-11.) Accordingly, the request to tax this amount is DENIED. 
2.     
Lodging, Travel, Mileage, and Parking 
First, the Church challenges $10,045.57
in lodging and travel costs because they 
were not reasonably
necessary and or reasonable in amount. The Church cites Gorman v. Tassajara Development
Corp. (2009) 178
Cal.App.4th 44, 72, which states that section 1033.5 "does
not provide for recovery of local travel expenses by attorneys and other firm
employees unrelated to attending depositions." (Motion., p. 17.) 
Plaintiffs acknowledges that
section 1033.5 does not authorize recovery of travel expenses related to
attending trial, but Plaintiffs asserts the Court has discretion in determining
such costs as recoverable. (Opp., pp. 11-12.) The Court finds that Plaintiffs
failed to satisfy their burden to prove that these costs are recoverable. The
Court therefore finds that $10,045.57
in lodging and travel costs should be taxed. The request is GRANTED.
Second,
the Church challenges mileage costs for each trip to and from the Compton
Courthouse from opposing counsel's office in San Diego (totaling $4,610.00) because
(1) the amount do not reflect the 115 miles of travel at the authorized IRS
rate of 65.5 cents per mile; and (2) Plaintiffs’ claim for mileage costs for
the trial originally scheduled for August 2023. (Id.) The Church argues
mileage should be taxed $3,932.12, at a minimum. (Motion, pp. 17-18.)  
              In opposition, Plaintiff does not address the mileage
arguments. Because Plaintiffs did not meet their burden to establish the
necessity and reasonableness of the costs, the Court finds that $3,932.12
should be taxed. The request is GRANTED. 
              Third, the Church challenges $2,226.41 in hotel costs
for two attorneys to attend the continued August 2, 2023 trial, arguing that
the expense were not reasonably necessary because trial was continued to
accommodate opposing counsel’s schedule. (Motion, p. 18.) Plaintiffs do not
address this lodging expense that the Church seeks to tax. The Court therefore
finds that the hotel expenses of $2,226.41 should be taxed. The request is
GRANTED. 
Lastly,
the Church challenges $1,863.28 in hotel charges for two attorneys, Mr. Learned
and Mr. Oberg, to attend the November 23 trial. The Church argues that Mr.
Oberg’s appearance was unnecessary because his appearance was “extremely
limited” whereas Mr. Learned’s hotel expenses were for convenience and not
necessary to the litigation. (Id.) As the Court granted the request to tax
Oberg’s pro hac vice fees, the request to tax Oberg’s share in hotel charges is
also granted. Further, neither Plaintiffs’ opposition nor the Declaration of
Learned addressed this lodging expense. The Memorandum of Costs merely provides
“12/04/2023 Hampton Inn: Hotel rooms for Attorneys M. Learned and D. Oberg
$1,863.28.” The Court finds that Plaintiffs have not met their responsive
burden to show how Learned’s share of the $1,863.28 in Hampton Inn hotel costs
(for what appears to be a one-night stay) was reasonably necessary or
reasonable in amount. The Court therefore finds that the entire hotel charges
of $1,863.28 should be taxed. The request is GRANTED. 
3.      Trial Transcripts
The Church challenges the entire $15,722.73 for trial transcript fees
because trial transcript fees are not allowable under section 1033 and not
reasonably necessary or reasonable in amount. (Motion, p. 18.) Further, the
Court did not order the parties to retain a court reporter order the
preparation of transcripts. (Id.) 
In
opposition, Plaintiffs point out that the Court requested to review the
transcripts to prepare its final statement of decision, which would not have
been available but for Plaintiffs’ sharing the costs of having a court reporter
at trial. (Opp. pp. 9-10, 12.)  
Based
on the foregoing, the Court finds that the trial transcript costs were
reasonably necessary for purposes of the litigation. Accordingly, the request
to tax this amount is DENIED. 
4.      Mediation Fees
The
Church challenges the entire $4,325.00
in mediation fees because mediation 
costs are not listed as
recoverable or not recoverable and because the expense are not reasonably
necessary or reasonable in amount. (Motion, p. 19.) Otherwise, if mediation
fees are within the Court’s discretion, the Church argues that the expenses
should not be awarded because Plaintiffs did not engage in good faith
mediation. (Id.) Plaintiffs, however, state facts contesting that
Plaintiffs did not approach the mediation in good faith. (Opp. p. 13; Learned
Decl.) The Court finds that this was a highly contentious case and that the
request to tax mediation fees should be DENIED.
