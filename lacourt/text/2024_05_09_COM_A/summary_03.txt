And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has denied the defendant's motion to reclassify the case as a limited jurisdiction matter. The defendant has not provided any evidence in support of the motion, and the court cannot find that the case is incorrectly classified. The defendant's arguments are based on the substantive allegations rather than the ascertainable damages. The court also notes that it cannot "trespass into the province of the trier of fact" and translate non-pecuniary damages into monetary amounts. Therefore, the court denies the motion to reclassify the case.
