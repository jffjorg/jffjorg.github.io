TENTATIVE ORDER DENYING
PLAINTIFF’S MOTION TO ENFORCE THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT AND  ENTER JUDGMENT PURSUANT TO CODE OF CIVIL
PROCEDURE SECTION 646.6 AGAINST DEFENDANT, SHOBERT VARTAN
 
      The
Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”), filed on August 29, 2018, alleges that
Plaintiff owns residential real property located at 925 E. Stockton Avenue in
Compton (the Compton Property). Defendants allegedly engaged in fraudulent acts
to fund three separate loans secured by the real property at issue. Defendants
allegedly presented the loan as a non-owner-occupied transaction, although
Plaintiff resided at the home. Plaintiff alleges claims for fraud, constructive
fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, and unfair business
practices. 
On July 24, 2019, Plaintiff and Defendants Shobert Vartan and Aram Tekeian
entered into a settlement agreement agreeing to each pay $65,000.00 to
Plaintiff. However, Defendant Vartan failed to make any payments.
      Plaintiff moves the court to enter judgment against Defendant
Vartan in the amount of $65,000.00, award interest in the amount of $30,523,
plus an award of attorney’s fees and costs in the amount of $1,470, plus $70
for filing fees for a total judgment amount of $97,063.00. No opposition or
reply has been filed as of May 7, 2024. 
      Pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6, “if parties to pending litigation
stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties outside the presence of the court
or orally before the court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the
court, upon motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the
settlement.  If requested by the parties,
the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties to enforce the settlement
until performance in full of the terms of the settlement.”  “Section 664.6 was enacted to provide a
summary procedure for specifically enforcing a settlement contract without the
need for a new lawsuit.”  (Weddington
Productions, Inc. v. Flick (1998) 60 Cal.App.4th 793, 809.)    
      To
be enforceable under Code Civ Proc., section 664.6, any written settlement
agreement outside of court must be signed by the parties and their counsel.
Although the Court may adjudicate disputes over the terms of the settlement
agreement, the Court may not modify terms from what was agreed to by the
parties. (Machado v. Myers (2019) 39 Cal.App.5th 779, 797.) A request
for the trial court to retain jurisdiction under section
664.6 “must conform to the same three requirements which the
Legislature and the courts have deemed necessary for section
664.6 enforcement of the settlement itself: the request must be made
(1) during the pendency of the case, not after the case has been dismissed in
its entirety, (2) by the parties themselves, and (3) either in a writing signed
by the parties or orally before the court.” (Mesa RHF
Partners, L.P. v. City of Los Angeles (2019) 33 Cal. App. 5th
913, 917, citing and quoting Wackeen
v. Malis (2002) 97 Cal.App.4th 429, 440.) 
      Here,
the parties signed a settlement agreement with Defendants Shobert Vartan and
Aram Tekeian on July 24, 2019, and August 2, 2019, respectively. (Park Decl. ¶
11, Ex. A.) After the parties signed these agreements, Defendant Vartan failed
to make the initial $20,000.00 payment which was due upon execution of the
Settlement Agreement. (Id. at ¶ 16; Ex. A. p.2.) To date, Defendant
Vartan has not provided payment. While the Settlement Agreement lacks any 664.6
provision which would give the Court jurisdiction to enforce the terms, a
thorough review of the Court’s file reveals that Plaintiff never actually
dismissed the matter as to Defendant Vartan. Although, Plaintiff filed a notice
of settlement and request to retain jurisdiction to enforce terms of settlement
on November 7, 2019, this is insufficient to establish jurisdiction because
Defendant Vartan did not agree to this term. (Mesa RHF
Partners, L.P. v. City of Los Angeles (2019) 33 Cal. App. 5th
913, 917.) Since the parties
did not agree, Plaintiff would need to enforce the settlement agreement
through a separate action (Pietrobon
v. Libarle (2006) 137 Cal.App.4th 992; Wackeen
v. Malis (2002) 97 Cal.App.4th 429.) or by way of
a summary judgment motion.  (Kilpatrick
v. Beebe (1990) 219 Cal.App.3d 1527, 1530.) “ ‘ “A settlement agreement is
a contract, and the legal principles [that] apply to contracts generally apply
to settlement contracts.” [Citation.] Its validity is thus “judged by the same
legal principles applicable to contracts generally.” [Citations.]’ [Citation.]
The elements of a cause of action for breach of contract include the existence
of a contract, the plaintiff's performance or excuse for nonperformance, the
defendant's breach, and resulting damages to the plaintiff. [Citation.]The
first element—the existence of a contract—requires parties capable of
contracting, their consent, a lawful object, and a sufficient cause or
consideration. (Civ. Code, § 1550.)” (J.B.B. Investment Partners Ltd. v.
Fair (2019) 37 Cal.App.5th 1(J.B.B. Investment).) 
Based on the foregoing, the court DENIES Plaintiff’s
Motion to Enter Judgment pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure §
664.6.  Plaintiff is also HEREBY ORDERED TO SHOW
CAUSE why the  action against Defendant
Vartan should not be dismissed for failure to prosecute. (Ca. Code of Civil
Procedure § 583.410 & § 583.420.)  The
clerk is ordered to serve Plaintiff with this Order to Show Cause.  Plaintiff is ordered to respond to the OSC in writing, five [5]
calendar days before the hearing date, which is or June 7, 2024, at 8:40
a.m. in Department A, located at 200 W. Compton Blvd., Compton, California.
