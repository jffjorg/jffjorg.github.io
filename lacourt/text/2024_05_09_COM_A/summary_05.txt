Here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling denies plaintiff's motion to enforce the settlement agreement and enter judgment against defendant Shobert Vartan. The plaintiff alleges that defendants engaged in fraudulent acts to fund loans, and the parties signed a settlement agreement in 2019. However, defendant Vartan failed to make the initial payment and has not made any payments since. The court finds that the settlement agreement lacks a provision giving the court jurisdiction to enforce the terms, and the plaintiff would need to enforce the agreement through a separate action or a summary judgment motion. The court also orders the plaintiff to show cause why the action against defendant Vartan should not be dismissed for failure to prosecute.
