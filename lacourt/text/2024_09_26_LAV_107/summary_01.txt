And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Counsel's motion to be relieved as counsel in a landlord-tenant dispute case. Counsel, Gary Kurtz, filed the motion on August 30, 2024, stating that there has been a complete breakdown of the attorney-client relationship and that he has been unable to communicate with the client, Michele Bidinger. The judge found that Counsel failed to comply with the requirements of California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1362, specifically with regard to serving the notice of motion and declaration on the client and other parties. The judge also noted that the proposed order relieving Counsel as counsel did not specify all hearing dates scheduled in the action. As a result, the judge denied Counsel's motion.
