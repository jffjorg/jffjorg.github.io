COURT’S[TENTATIVE]
  DECISION RE:       Demurrer  
 



 
Defendants
Kaiser Foundation Hospitals, Southern California Permanente Medical Group and
Anthony Duy Pham, M.D. (“Defendants”) demur to the complaint brought by
Plaintiff Ava Ivania Rodriguez. This court sustains the demurrer without leave
to amend.
 
I.               
BACKGROUND 
 
On
January 11, 2022, Caroline Hartono died after being hospitalized at a Kaiser
Foundation hospital for COVID-19. (Complaint ¶¶ 8-10,
14, 42.) On January 11, 2024, Hartono’s daughter, Plaintiff Ava Ivania
Rodriquez, filed a complaint against Defendants alleging a single cause of
action for wrongful death in violation of Civil Code Section 1573 (Constructive
Fraud). (Complaint ¶ 67.) 
 
The complaint alleges that Hartono was not given the “Standard
Treatment,” which is a “[s]afe and highly effective treatment for COVID-19
patients using well-studied and very low risk off-label and on-label drugs”
because Defendants received financial and legal incentives for giving patients
Remedesivir, but not the Standard Treatment. (Complaint ¶¶ 23, 39-41.) The
complaint further alleges that Defendants misled Hartono “by providing
incomplete or inaccurate relevant information.” (Complaint ¶ 61.) And “[h]ad the fraud not occurred, [Hartono] would
have experienced a better outcome and not died.” (Complaint ¶ 65.)
 
On August 22, 2024, Defendants filed the instant demurrer. On
September 13, 2024, Plaintiff filed an opposition, to which no reply was filed.

II.
PROCEDURAL MATTERS¿ 
¿ 
A.   
Timeliness
of Filings¿ 
¿ 
Per California Code of Civil Procedure §¿430.40, subdivision (a),
a demurrer to a complaint should be filed within 30 days after service of the
complaint. Per California Code of Civil Procedure §¿1005, subdivision (b),
moving papers should be filed at least 16 court days before they are set for
hearing, oppositions thereto should be filed at least nine court days before
the set hearing, and replies to any oppositions should be filed at least five
court days before the set hearing. Judges have discretion as to whether to
consider or strike an untimely demurrer or pleading. (McAllister v. County
of Monterey (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 253, 281; Tuck v. Thuesen (1970)
10 Cal.App.3d 193, 196 (disapproved on other grounds by Neel v. Magana,
Olney, Levy, Cathcart & Gelfand (1971) 6 Cal.3d 176).)
 
Plaintiff served Defendant Southern California Permanent Medical
Group on June 17, 2024. Plaintiff served Defendant Kaiser Foundation Hospitals
on June 14, 2024. Plaintiff served Defendant Andrew Duy Pham, M.D. on July 2,
2024. 
 
On July 15, 2024, Defendants filed a declaration in support of
automatic extension to demurrer. 
 
Defendants filed the Demurrer on August 14, 2024. At a Case
Management Conference, Defendants were ordered to refile the Demurrer.
(08/22/24 Minute Order.) Defendants then refiled the Demurrer on August 22,
2024. Thus, the Demurrer was timely filed. The Opposition was also timely filed
on September 13, 2024. 
¿ 
B.   
The
Meet & Confer Requirement¿ 
¿ 
California Code of Civil Procedure §¿430.41,
subdivision (a) requires parties to “meet and confer” in good faith before the
filing of a demurrer to attempt to informally resolve the objections raised in
the demurrer.¿The demurring party is required to file and serve with the
demurrer a declaration either confirming that parties were unable to resolve
the issues raised by the demurrer despite having met and conferred or that the
opposing party failed to meet and confer with the demurring party in good faith.
(Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §¿430.41, subd. (a)(3).)¿ 
¿ 
Defendants
filed a declaration by counsel indicating the parties met and conferred before
Defendant filed the Demurrer but were unable to reach a mutually agreeable
resolution to these issues. (Cox Declaration ¶ 3.) 
 
The
Court finds the meet and confer requirement has been satisfied.
¿ 
III.
LEGAL STANDARD 
¿¿ 
As a general matter, in a demurrer proceeding,
the defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial
notice.¿(Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968,
994.)¿“A demurrer tests the pleading alone, and not the evidence or facts
alleged.” (E-Fab, Inc. v. Accountants, Inc. Servs. (2007) 153
Cal.App.4th 1308, 1315.) As such, the court assumes the truth of the
complaint’s properly pleaded or implied factual allegations. (Ibid.) The
only issue a demurrer is concerned with is whether the complaint, as it stands,
states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th
740, 747.)¿A complaint is sufficient if it contains “[a]¿statement¿of
the¿facts¿constituting the cause of action, in ordinary and concise language.”
(Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §¿425.10(a)(1).) Under this standard, a “complaint
ordinarily is sufficient if it alleges ultimate rather than evidentiary facts.”
(Doe v. City of Los Angeles (2007) 42 Cal.4th 531, 550.)¿
 
Where a demurrer is sustained, leave to amend
must be allowed where there is a reasonable possibility of successful
amendment. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.) The burden is
on the plaintiffs to show the court that a pleading can be amended
successfully. (Id.; Lewis v. YouTube, LLC (2015) 244 Cal.App.4th 118,
226.) However, “[i]f there is any reasonable possibility that the plaintiff[s]
can state a good cause of action, it is error to sustain a demurrer without
leave to amend.” (Youngman v. Nevada Irrigation Dist. (1969) 70 Cal.2d
240, 245).  
 
IV.
DISCUSSION 
 
A.             
Immunity
Under the PREP Act
 
Defendants argue Plaintiff’s cause of action for constructive
fraud is barred by the federal Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act
(“PREP Act”). (Demurrer at p. 2.) Under the PREP Act, “a covered person shall be immune
from suit and liability under Federal and State law with respect to all claims
for loss caused by, arising out of, relating to, or resulting from the
administration to or the use by an individual of a covered countermeasure.” (42
U.S.C. § 247d-6d(a)(1)). The declaration by the Secretary of the Department of
Health and Human Services established that the PREP Act applies to COVID-19.
(Decl. PREP Act Med. Countermeasures Against COVID-19, 85 Fed. Reg. 15198-01
(Mar. 17, 2020); Ex. 3.) 
 
The
PREP Act defines a “covered person” as “a qualified person who prescribed,
administered, or dispensed such countermeasure[.]” (42 U.S.C. §
247d-6d(i)(2)(B)(iv).)  A “qualified
person” is defined as “a licensed health professional or other individual
authorized to prescribe, administer, or dispense Covered Countermeasures under
the law of the state in which the Covered Countermeasure was prescribed,
administered, or dispensed[.]” (Id., § 247d-6d(i)(8).) The PREP Act also
defines a “covered person” as “program planners” who are involved in providing
or allocating covered countermeasures. (42 USC § 247d-6d(i)(2).) 
 
A
“Covered Countermeasure” is defined as a “qualified pandemic or epidemic
product,” which itself is defined to include a drug designed to diagnose,
mitigate, prevent, treat, or cure a pandemic or epidemic. (Id., §
247d-6d(i)(1)(A) & § 247d-6d(i)(7).) Remdesvir is approved by the Food and
Drug Administration for the treatment of COVID-19 in adults. (Ex. 7.)
 
Here, Defendants are covered persons under the
PREP Act. Defendant Anthony Duy Pham, M.D. is a licensed health professional.
(42 U.S.C. §
247d-6d(i)(8).) Further, Plaintiff’s
complaint alleges that Kaiser Foundation Hospitals operates a hospital in
Woodland Hills and Defendant Southern California Permanente Medical Group
provides physicians to Kaiser Foundation Hospitals. (Complaint ¶¶ 14-15.) Accordingly, based on Plaintiff’s allegations, Kaiser
Foundation Hospitals and Southern California Permanente Medical Group qualify
as “program planners” because they are medical facilities involved in providing
or allocating covered countermeasures. (Id.) 
 
Further, Plaintiff’s claim for loss arises out of, relates to, or
resulted from of the administration of a covered countermeasure. Plaintiff argues that “the Act is limited to claims
where the causation is from product injury after affirmative conduct, and not
the failure to administer a treatment” and further argues that Plaintiff’s
“’claim for loss’ is tied to the denial of Caroline’s right to choose a medical
treatment that would have provided a better outcome, and not from an adverse
reaction to the drug provided.” (Opposition at pp.6-7.) But the PREP Act states
that “Subject to the other provisions of this section, a covered person shall
be immune from suit and liability under Federal and State law with respect to
all claims for loss caused by, arising out of, relating to, or resulting
from the administration to or the use by an individual of a covered
countermeasure[.]” (42 U.S.C. § 247d-6d(a)(1) (Emphasis added.))
 
Here, the complaint
alleges that Hartono “presented herself to the hospital emergency department
with easily treatable symptoms of uterine fibroid bleeding, as well as symptoms
of a bacterial infection or possible SARS-CoV-2 infection.” (Complaint ¶ 9.) The complaint further alleges that Hartono’s
“physicians concealed her alternative diagnosis and low risk and highly
effective treatment, and their plan to treat [Hartono] for COVID-19 with
ineffective and high-risk drugs that provided benefits to the people that were
supposed to put [Hartono’s] interests first.” (Complaint ¶ 10.) Next, the
complaint alleges that Defendants did not treat Hartono with the “Standard
Treatment” which the complaint describes as “[s]afe and highly effective
treatment for COVID-19 patients using well-studied and very low risk off-label
and on-label drugs.” (Complaint ¶ 23.) Instead, Defendants “followed the COVID-19
“protocol” and concealed from and/or misrepresented to [Hartono] the Standard
Treatment for her condition, alternative diagnoses and treatment options for
uterine fibroid tumor and a bacterial infection, the risks and benefits of
treatment Remdesivir and Standard Treatment, the financial incentive to KFH for
administering Remdesivir, the legal incentive to Dr. Pham and the DOE
defendants for administering Remdesivir, and the voluntary nature of the PREP
Act program and its potential restrictions on physician liability and
compensation for harm before administering Remdesivir.” (Complaint ¶ 49.) Finally, the Complaint alleges that Hartono
“received treatment other than the Standard Treatment” and “would have
experienced a better outcome and not died . . . had the concealment and/or
misrepresentation not occurred.” (Complaint ¶¶ 52-53.) Plaintiff is alleging
that Hartono died because Defendants misrepresented facts and administered
Remdesivir, rather than the “Standard Treatment.” Thus, Plaintiff’s claim for
loss arises out of, relates to, or resulted from of the administration of a
covered countermeasure. 
 
Accordingly, the PREP Act applies to Plaintiff’s cause of action. 
 

The
     PREP Act Exception for “Willful Misconduct”

 
The
PREP Act contains a “sole exception to the immunity from suit and liability of
covered persons.” (42 U.S.C. § 247d-6d(d)(1).) The exception is for “an
exclusive Federal cause of action against a covered person for death or serious
physical injury proximately caused by willful misconduct.” (Ibid.) This
claim must be filed and maintained “only in the United States District Court
for the District of Columbia.” (Id., § 247d-6d(e)(1).) “Willful
misconduct” is defined in the PREP Act as “an act or omission that is taken . .
. (i) intentionally to achieve a wrongful purpose; (ii) knowingly without legal
or factual justification; and (iii) in disregard of a known or obvious risk
that is so great as to make it highly probable that the harm will outweigh the
benefit.” (42 U.S.C.A. § 247d-6d(c)(1)(A).)
 
To the extent Plaintiff alleges Defendants engaged in willful
misconduct, the PREP Act requires those claims to be filed and maintained in
the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, so this Court
has no authority to hear that claim.  (42 U.S.C. § 247d-6d(e)(1).)
 
Leave to Amend 
 
Where a demurrer is sustained, leave to amend
must be allowed where there is a reasonable possibility of successful
amendment. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.) “If there is
any reasonable possibility that the plaintiff can state a good cause of action,
it is error to sustain a demurrer without leave to amend.” (Youngman v.
Nevada Irrigation Dist. (1969) 70 Cal.2d 240, 245.) “If the plaintiff has
not had an opportunity to amend the complaint in response to the demurrer,
leave to amend is liberally allowed as a matter of fairness, unless the
complaint shows on its face that it is incapable of amendment.” (City of
Stockton v. Superior Court (2007) 42 Cal.4th 730, 747.) Courts generally
allow at least one time to amend a complaint, after sustaining a demurrer, even
without any request for leave to amend. (McDonald v. Superior Court
(1986) 180 Cal. App. 3d 297, 303.)¿ 
¿ 
While this is the first time a demurrer has been
sustained in this action, because Defendants either have immunity under the
PREP Act, or Plaintiff must seek relief in federal court, this Court does not
see any reasonable possibility that Plaintiff’s cause of action can be cured by
amendment. 
 
Accordingly, this court SUSTAINS the Demurrer without leave to
amend.
