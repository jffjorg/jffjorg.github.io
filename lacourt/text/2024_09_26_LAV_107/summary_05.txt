And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the demurrer filed by the defendants is sustained without leave to amend. The plaintiff, Ava Ivania Rodriguez, is suing Kaiser Foundation Hospital, et al. for wrongful death, alleging that the defendants received financial and legal incentives for giving patients Remedesivir instead of the "Standard Treatment" and that the defendants misled the decedent, Caroline Hartono, resulting in her death.

The judge has found that the defendants are immune from liability under the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness (PREP) Act, which provides immunity to covered persons, including healthcare providers and medical facilities, for losses caused by the administration of a covered countermeasure, such as Remedesivir. The judge has also found that the plaintiff's claim for loss arises out of, relates to, or resulted from the administration of a covered countermeasure, and therefore, the PREP Act applies to the plaintiff's cause of action.

The judge has further found that the plaintiff's claim for willful misconduct is subject to the PREP Act's exception, which requires claims to be filed and maintained in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. As a result, the court has no authority to hear the plaintiff's claim for willful misconduct.

The judge has not seen any reasonable possibility that the plaintiff's cause of action can be cured by amendment, and therefore, has sustained the demurrer without leave to amend.
