Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment on all causes of action in the complaint and cross-complaint. The plaintiff, Maverick Bankcard, Inc., alleged that the defendants, Bayren 16 Inc. dba Mbenzgram and Yasmin Armouti, breached a contract and personal guarantee by failing to repay Maverick for chargebacks and fees. The defendants failed to provide evidence to support their defenses and the court finds that there are no triable issues of material fact.

The court grants summary judgment on the following causes of action:

1. Breach of contract
2. Breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing
3. Negligence
4. Unfair business practices

The court finds that the defendants failed to meet their burden of showing that there are triable issues of material fact and that the plaintiff's evidence supports a judgment in its favor. The court also notes that the defendants' declarations are conclusory and speculative and do not provide sufficient evidence to support their defenses.
