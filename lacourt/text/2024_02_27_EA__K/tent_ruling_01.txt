  Case Number:  23PSCV02951    Hearing Date:   February 27, 2024    Dept:  K Defendant Target
Corporation’s Demurrer to Plaintiff’s Complaint is SUSTAINED. The court will
hear from counsel for Plaintiff as to whether leave to amend is requested and will
require an offer of proof if so.
Background[1]  
Plaintiff Francisco Castilla,
by and through his Guardian Ad Litem Kathy Castilla (“Plaintiff”), alleges as
follows:
On November 29, 2022, Plaintiff
sustained injuries at a Target store after another patron’s dog attacked and
bit him.
On September 25, 2023,
Plaintiff filed a complaint, asserting a cause of action against Target
Corporation (“Defendant”) and Does 1-20 for:
1.                 
General Negligence 
A Case Management Conference is
set for February 27, 2024.
Legal Standard
A
demurrer may be made on the grounds that the pleading, inter alia, does not
state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. (Code Civ. Proc., §
430.10, subd. (e).)
When considering demurrers, courts read the allegations liberally and in
context. In a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of
the pleading or via proper judicial notice. (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) “A
demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic
matters. Therefore, it lies only where the defects appear on the face of the
pleading or are judicially noticed.” (SKF Farms v. Superior Court (1984)
153 Cal.App.3d 902, 905 [citations omitted].) At the pleading stage, a
plaintiff need only allege ultimate facts sufficient to apprise the defendant
of the factual basis for the claim against him. (Semole v. Sansoucie (1972) 28 Cal. App. 3d 714, 721.) “[A] demurrer
does not, however, admit contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law
alleged in the pleading, or the construction placed on an instrument pleaded
therein, or facts impossible in law, or allegations contrary to facts of which
a court may take judicial knowledge.” (S.
Shore Land Co. v. Petersen (1964) 226 Cal.App.2d 725, 732 [citations
omitted].)
Discussion
Defendant demurs to
Plaintiff’s complaint, on the basis that it fails to state facts sufficient to
constitute a cause of action.
“The elements of any
negligence cause of action are duty, breach of duty, proximate cause, and
damages.” (Peredia v. HR Mobile Services,
Inc. (2018) 25 Cal.App.5th 680, 687.) “[W]hether a individual
owes a duty of care to another is a question of law.” (Portillo v. Aiassa
(1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 1128, 1133.)
Defendant asserts that
Plaintiff’s negligence cause of action fails because it did not own the subject
dog and did not know of the dog’s dangerous propensities to bite.
Civil Code § 3342 makes the owner of any dog “liable for the
damages suffered by any person who is bitten by the dog. . . regardless of the
former viciousness of the dog or the owner’s knowledge of such viciousness.” Also,
“a storekeeper must exercise reasonable care to protect a customer
from harm by dogs or other animals, but is, however, not liable for an
injury by a dog not owned or kept by the storekeeper, where he did not know and
had no reason to know that the dog would commit such an injury.” (Baley
v. J.F. Hink & Son (1955) 133 Cal.App.2d 102, 110-111 [Emphasis
added]).
Plaintiff has
alleged that on November 29, 2022, he was at one of Defendant’s locations with
his mother and that, as he walked by another patron, the patron’s dog attacked and bit him on the right side of his body. (Complaint, ¶ GN-1
[emphasis added].) Plaintiff thus concedes that Defendant did not own the dog,
such that strict liability pursuant to Civil Code § 3342 would not apply.
Plaintiff has alleged
only that “[t]he patron who owned the dog confirmed that the subject dog was
not a service animal and that she had not been asked by a Target representative
to not bring her dog into the subject store, nor had a representative asked her
to remove her dog from the store.” (Complaint, ¶ GN-1). Plaintiff, then, has
not alleged that Defendant had actual knowledge of the dog’s dangerous
propensities.
Finally, while
Plaintiff argues that Defendant is liable because it “permit[ed] customers to
bring non-service dogs onto the Premises” (Opp. 2:20) and “fail[ed] to enforce
the law (barring non-service dogs from the Premises” (Id., 2:22), Plaintiff has not identified the “law” Defendant violated. In
fact, “there is no law prohibiting bringing a dog into a store.” (Baley, supra, 133 Cal.App.2d at 111).
Defendant’s
demurrer is sustained.
