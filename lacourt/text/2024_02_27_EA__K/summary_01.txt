And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has sustained Target Corporation's demurrer to Francisco Castilla's complaint, which alleges negligence on the part of Target Corporation. The judge found that the complaint fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action because it does not allege that Target Corporation had actual knowledge of the dog's dangerous propensities. The judge also found that Plaintiff's allegations that Target Corporation failed to prevent the dog attack are insufficient to establish a cause of action. The case is set for a Case Management Conference on February 27, 2024, where the Plaintiff may request leave to amend the complaint and provide an offer of proof.
