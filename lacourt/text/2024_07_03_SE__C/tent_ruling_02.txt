Background
This
is a habitability action about a residence. Plaintiffs sue for harassment,
retaliatory eviction, constructive eviction and willful interruption of
services, violation of Business and Professions Code section 17200, et seq.,
statutory breach of habitability, tortious breach of implied warranty of
habitability, negligent maintenance of premises, intentional infliction of
emotional distress, negligent infliction of emotional distress, and nuisance. 
 
Defendants demur to the
complaint on the grounds that it does not state facts sufficient to constitute a
cause of action and it is uncertain. Defendants also move to strike certain allegations.

Legal Standard  
A demurrer is an
objection to a pleading, the grounds for which are apparent from either the
face of the complaint or a matter of which the court may take judicial
notice.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.30,
subd. (a); see also Blank v. Kirwan
(1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) The purpose of a demurrer is to challenge the
sufficiency of a pleading “by raising questions of law.”  (Postley
v. Harvey (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 280, 286.)  The court “treat[s] the demurrer as admitting
all material facts properly pleaded, but not contentions, deductions or
conclusions of fact or law. . .”  (Berkley v. Dowds (2007) 152
Cal.App.4th 518, 525 (Berkley).)  
 
Separately, the Court may strike out any irrelevant, false, or improper
matter in a pleading. (Code Civ. Proc., § 436.)
 
Meet and Confer
 
Defendants did not
satisfy the meet and confer requirements for either motion. (Code. Civ. Proc.,
§ 430.41, subd. (a); Code. Civ. Proc., § 435.5, subd. (a).) Defendants
submitted no declaration that they met and conferred.  
 
The Court CONTINUES the
hearing to August 28, 2024, at 10:30 A.M. in Dept. SE-C. The parties are
ordered to meet and confer, and they are to submit a declaration about their
meet-and-confer efforts by Monday, August 19. If there are outstanding issues
remaining, the Court will hear them on August 28, 2024.
