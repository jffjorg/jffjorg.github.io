And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendant's motion to deem the truth of matters admitted against the plaintiff. The motion is denied because the plaintiff's responses to the requests for admissions substantially comply with the requirements of the Code of Civil Procedure. The defendant had requested that the court deem the truth of the matters specified in their first set of requests for admissions, and also sought monetary sanctions.

The court awards the defendant monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,750.00, as required by the Code of Civil Procedure. The motion was unopposed as of July 1, 2024, and the court's decision is based on the documents and facts presented in the case.
