And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in a habitability action case, in which plaintiffs sue for various causes of action related to a residence. The defendants have filed a demurrer to the complaint, arguing that it does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action and is uncertain. The defendants have also moved to strike certain allegations. The court has determined that the demurrer and motion to strike are not properly supported by the meet and confer requirements and has continued the hearing to August 28, 2024. The parties are ordered to meet and confer and submit a declaration about their efforts by August 19, 2024. If there are outstanding issues remaining, the court will hear them on the continued hearing date.
