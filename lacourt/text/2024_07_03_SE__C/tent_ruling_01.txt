TENTATIVE RULING
 
I.            
Plaintiff Doris Walters’ motion to compel further responses to Request
for Production of Documents, Set One from Defendant Denisse Vazquez is DENIED. No
sanctions. 
 
II.           
Plaintiff Doris Walters’ motion to compel further responses to Request
for Production of Documents, Set One from Defendant Osi Staffing, Inc. is DENIED.
No sanctions. 
 
Moving Party to give NOTICE. 
 
 
This is about an automobile collision.
Plaintiff Doris Walters moves to compel further responses to Defendant Denisse
Vazquez’s Request for Production of Documents, request numbers 3, 4, 7, 9, 12 to
15, 18, 21, and 23 to 32. Plaintiff Doris Walters moves to compel further
responses to Defendant Osi Staffing, Inc.’s Request for Production of
Documents, request numbers 3, 4, 7, 9, 12 to 15, 18, 21, and 23 to 32.     
 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2031.310 allows a party to file a motion
compelling further responses to document requests if the party finds that the
response is inadequate, incomplete, or evasive, or an objection is without
merit or too general.

Timeliness

 
Notice of the motion to compel further must be
provided within 45 days of service of the verified response or on or before any
specific later date to which the parties have agreed. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310,
subd. (c).) This 45-day deadline runs from the date the verified response is
served and is extended for service by mail in accordance with Code of Civil
Procedure sections 1010.6, subdivision (a)(4) and 1013, subdivision (a). Failure
to timely move to compel within the specified period constitutes a waiver of
any right to compel a further response. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (c).)

 
On December 12, 2023, the defendant
served verified amended responses to Plaintiff’s first set of requests for
production of documents. (Decl. Teppara, ¶ 14, Ex. F.) Responses consisted of
both factual responses and objections. (Decl. Teppara, ¶ 14, Ex. F.) The
parties agreed to extend the time to file a motion to compel further to
December 15, 2023. (Decl. Teppara, ¶ 13, Ex. E.) 
 
Thus, the motion is timely. 
 
Meet
and Confer
 
The
motion shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2031.310, subd. (b)(2).) A meet and confer declaration in support of a motion
shall state facts showing a reasonable and good faith attempt at an informal
resolution of each issue presented by the motion. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2016.040.) 
 
For purposes of
determining whether a motion to compel discovery was preceded by a reasonable
and good faith effort to meet and confer, such an attempt at informal
resolution requires something more than bickering with opposing counsel;
rather, the law requires that counsel attempt to talk the matter over, compare
their views, consult, and deliberate. (Clement v. Alegre (2009) 177
Cal.App.4th 1277, 1294.) 
 
Based on Plaintiff’s counsel’s
declaration, the Court finds that the parties sufficiently met and conferred.
(Decl. Teppara, ¶¶ 10 to 11, Ex. C, D.) 
 
Discussion
 
Moving
parties must file evidence showing good cause based on specific facts that the
requested matter is admissible evidence or appears reasonably calculated to
lead to the discovery of such evidence. (Calcor Space Facility, Inc. v.
Super. Ct. (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 216, 223-24.) Good cause generally calls for a
factual exposition of a reasonable ground for the discovery order sought. (Waters v. Super. Ct. of L.A. County (1962) 58 Cal.2d 885, 893.) "[E]ven when no . .
. supporting affidavits are filed . . .good cause may be found in the pleadings
theretofore filed in the action." (Greyhound Corp. v. Super. Ct.  (1961) 56 Cal.2d 355, 389.)
 
Here, Plaintiff
does not argue good cause, not in the moving papers and not in the separate
statement. Plaintiff argues that Defendant’s objections are not warranted, but
this is not the same as arguing that the requested matter is admissible
evidence or appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of such
evidence. 
 
Thus, the
Court denies the motion.
