CASE
NO.:  23NWCV02294
HEARING:
 7/3/24 @ 9:30 A.M. 
 
#1
TENTATIVE ORDER
 
I.            
Defendant Bellflower Unified School District’s Motion to Deem
the Truth of the Matters Admitted as to Defendant is DENIED.  
 
II.           
Monetary sanctions are GRANTED.

 
Moving
Party to give NOTICE.
 
The
motion is unopposed as of July 1, 2024. 
 
 
This
is a negligence action from a bullying incident that occurred at Mayfair High
School in Bellflower Unified School District between two students. 
 
Defendant
Bellflower Unified School District moves for an order that the truth of all
matters specified in Defendant’s first set of requests for admission be deemed
admitted against Plaintiff. Defendant also seeks monetary sanctions. 
 
Requests
for Admissions
 
Where
a party fails to respond to requests for admissions, the propounding party may move for an order that
the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the
requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).)  The
court “shall” grant a motion to deem admitted the matters specified in the
requests for admissions, “unless it finds that the party to whom the requests
for admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion,
a proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial
compliance with Section 2033.220.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).) 
 
On September 25, 2023, Defendant propounded the
first set of requests for admission on Plaintiff. (Decl. Roche, ¶ 3, Ex. A.) 
 
On February 12, 2024, Plaintiff served
responses. (Decl. Ibisi, ¶ 5, Ex. A.) 
 
Upon reviewing the responses, the Court finds
that the responses substantially comply with Code of Civil Procedure section
2033.220. 
 
Thus, the Court denies
the motion. 
 
Monetary Sanctions
 
“It
is mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction under [Code of Civil
Procedure section 2023.010, et seq.] on the party or attorney, or both,
whose failure to serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated
this motion.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)  
 
Defendant requests sanctions in the amount of $1,750.00.
(Decl. Roche, ¶ 5.) The Court awards the sanctions.
