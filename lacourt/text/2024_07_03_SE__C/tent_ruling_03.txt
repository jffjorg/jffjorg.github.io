TENTATIVE
RULING
 
Plaintiffs Jung Ho Choi
and Kyuho Choi’s motion for attorney fees and costs against Hyundai Motor
America, Inc. is granted in part. Plaintiffs are entitled to $12,512.77 in
attorney fees and costs. 
 
Moving Parties to give
NOTICE.
 
 
Plaintiffs Jung Ho Choi and Kyuho Choi move for $17,118 in attorney fees and $862.77 in costs. 
 
Prevailing Party
 
Under
Civil Code section 1794, subdivision (d), “[i]f the buyer prevails in an action
under [the Song-Beverly Act], the buyer shall be allowed by the court to
recover as part of the judgment a sum equal to the aggregate amount of costs
and expenses, including attorney’s fees based on actual time expended,
determined by the court to have been reasonably incurred by the buyer in
connection with the commencement and prosecution of such action.” 
 
In
the present case, there is no dispute that Plaintiffs are the prevailing
parties in the action and are entitled to reasonable attorney fees. Thus, the
only question to be determined by this motion is the amount of the award.
 
Reasonableness of Attorney’s Fees
 
A buyer prevailing under the
Song-Beverly Act may recover “reasonable” attorney fees and costs as determined
by the Court. (Civ. Code § 1794, subd. (d).) As to Song–Beverly warranty claims,
prevailing buyers have the burden to show that the fees incurred were
reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation and were reasonable
amounts.  (Doppes v. Bentley Motors,
Inc. (2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 967, 998.) 
The question whether attorneys’ fees were reasonably incurred may depend
on circumstances including, “factors such as the complexity of the case and
procedural demands, the skill exhibited, and the results achieved.”  (Goglin v. BMW of North America, LLC
(2016) 4 Cal.App.5th 462, 470.) 
Lodestar
is the objective starting point to determine if attorney’s fees are reasonable.
(Nichols v. City of Taft (2007) 155 Cal.App.4th 1233, 1242.) Lodestar is
calculated by using the reasonable rate for comparable services in the local
community, multiplied by the reasonable number of hours spent on the case. (Ibid.)
Lodestar requires the court to determine the reasonable number of hours
expended for the work performed. (Concepcion v. Amscan Holdings, Inc.
(2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 1309, 1320.) The lodestar approach has been applied to
determining attorney’s fees under Song-Beverly. (Robertson v. Fleetwood
Travel Trailers of California, Inc. (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 785, 817.)
 
Here, Plaintiffs seek to recover attorney
fees and costs in the amount of $17,118 for 40.3 hours of legal
work and $862.77 in costs, with attorney Nick
Nita billing at $550.00 per hour in 2022 and $625.00 per hour in 2023; attorney
Justin Wisnewski billing at $350 per hour; paralegal Madalina Costescu billing
at $250.00 per hour; paralegal Jovanna Garay billing at $250.00 per hour; law
clerk Kaylee Can billing at $250.00 per hour; legal assistant Linda Heredia
billing at $150.00 per hour; “settlement” Abraham Hernandez billing at $150 per
hour; and legal assistant Jennifer Cruz billing at $150 per hour. (Decl. Nita,
¶ 5, Ex. A.) 
 
Counsel’s
Hourly Rates
 
When determining a reasonable
hourly rate, courts consider whether the stated rates “are within the range of
reasonable rates charged by and judicially awarded to comparable attorneys for
comparable work.” (Children’s Hosp. & Med. Center v. Bonta (2002) 97
Cal.App.4th 740, 783.) 
 
The burden is on the fee
applicant to prove the appropriate market rate to be used in calculating the
lodestar. In Blum vs. Stenson (1984) 465 U.S. 886, 895
n11, the Supreme Court said that to
 
inform and assist the court in the exercise of its discretion, the
burden is on the fee applicant to produce satisfactory evidence—in addition to
the attorney’s own affidavits—that the requested rates are in line with those
prevailing in the community for similar services by lawyers of reasonably
comparable skill, experience, and reputation. A rate determined in this
way is normally deemed to be reasonable and is referred to—for convenience—as
the prevailing market rate.
 
Once the party claiming fees presents evidence supporting the
claimed rate, the burden shifts to the party opposing fees to present equally
specific countervailing evidence. (Roberts vs. City & County of
Honolulu (9th Cir 2019) 938 F.3d 1020, 1025.) 
 
Nita states that he has been
specializing in lemon law and dealer fraud cases since January 2016. (Decl.
Nita, ¶ 19.) Nita also states that he has had extensive experience prosecuting
and resolving lemon law and dealer fraud cases for the past 17 years. (Decl.
Nita, ¶ 20.) 
 
Nita states that he is “informed
and believes” that attorneys Michael Lindsey, who has handled consumer law
cases for the 15 years, bills at $625 per hour as of 2017. (Decl. Nita, ¶ 26.)
He also states that he is “informed and believes” that attorney Richard Wirtz, who
handles Song-Beverly cases and dealer fraud cases and who has been practicing
consumer protection law for over 25 years, charges $695 per hour. (Decl. Nita, ¶
27.) He further states that from 2018 on, various Los Angeles Superior Court
judges have approved his hourly rate of $500 in lemon law cases. (Decl. Nita, ¶¶
32 to 55.) 
 
In opposition, Defendant’s counsel
Donna Hopper states that defense firms generally charge $250 per hour in
warranty defense litigation, which includes lawyers with 30 years of trial
experience. (Decl. Hopper, ¶ 12.) Hopper submits as support two federal cases
in the central district of California and one case from Riverside County where
the rates were $325 per hour, $225 per hour, and $250 per hour. (Decl. Hopper,
¶¶13-15.) 
 
The Court finds the rate of $500
for Nita reasonable. The Court does not find Nita’s statements about other
attorneys persuasive because he made them based on information and belief. Generally,
statements based on information and belief are prohibited in affidavits. (City
of Santa Cruz v. Mun. Ct. (1989) 49 Cal.3d 74, 87.) The exceptions are if a
statute requires them or if the facts to be established cannot be declared to
be. (Ibid.) Neither exception applies here. The Court does not find
Defendant’s arguments persuasive because the rates she cites are not rates based
in the same community as Nita, which is Los Angeles. 
 
Defendant does not challenge the
reasonableness of attorney Justin Wisnewski’s rates. Thus, his rates are
reasonable. 
 
Staff’s
Hourly Rates
 
Paralegal and other professional staff rates must be justified
with evidence that they are consistent with market rates. (See, e.g.,
Shame on You Prods. v Banks (9th Cir. 2018) 893 F.3d 661, 670.)
 
Defendant challenges the rates of the paralegals. (Opp., pg. 11.) Defendant
does not challenge the rates of law
clerk Kaylee Can’s billing at $250.00 per hour; legal assistant Linda Heredia’s
billing at $150.00 per hour; “settlement” Abraham Hernandez’s billing at $150
per hour; and legal assistant Jennifer Cruz’s billing at $150 per hour. 
 
Plaintiff has not submitted
evidence that the paralegal’s rates are consistent with market rates. Thus, the
Court strikes the paralegals’ entries. 
 
          Time Expended
 
Plaintiffs seek to recover
attorney fees and costs in the amount of $17,118 for 40.3 hours of legal
work and $862.77 in costs. Plaintiffs submit an itemized list of time entries
detailing the legal work on this matter. (Decl. Nita, ¶ 5, Ex. A.) 
 
In challenging attorney
fees as excessive because too many hours of work are claimed, the opposing
party must point to the specific items challenged, with a sufficient argument
and citations to the evidence. (Premier
Medical Management Systems, Inc. v. Cal. Ins. Guarantee Assn. (2008) 163 Cal.App.4th 550,
564.)
 
                    Attorney
Nita
 
Defendant challenges the various specific entries in Plaintiffs’
attorneys’ time entries as identified in exhibit A1 to Hooper’s declaration. The
Court discusses all of them. 
 
The Court finds many of Defendant’s reasons for challenging the
entries to be speculative. For example, for the second September 1, 2022,
entry, Defendant states, “This seems to be with regard to the representation
agreement which is not billable.” (Decl. Hopper, Exhibit A1.) Based only on
Defendant’s statement, the Court cannot ascertain Defendant’s speculations.
Thus, the Court will not strike them. The Court also finds the reasons given in
the following entries speculative: the fourth September 1, 2022, entry; the
October 19, 2022 entry; the first March 10, 2023 entry; the second March 13,
2023 entry; the May 9, 2023 entry; the first June 23, 2023 entry; the July 15,
2023 entry; the first August 11, 2023 entry; the August 11, 2023 entries about
reviewing discovery; the September 12, 2023 entries; the third October 12, 2023
entry; and the third October 13, 2023 entry. 
 
The Court agrees with Defendant’s challenge to the last June 23, 2023,
entry. Given the straightforward nature of lemon law cases, reviewing and
revising a case management statement would not take an attorney experienced in
lemon law cases 18 minutes. 
 
The Court does not agree with Defendant’s challenge to the July
15, 2023, entry on the grounds that it would not take an experienced lemon law
attorney 3.5 hours to review two court decisions. Reading court cases is a
subjective experience. Further, given that this was the first time Nita read
these cases, 3.5 hours is not excessive. 
 
The Court does not agree with Defendant’s challenge to the October
30, 2023, entry. Reviewing a court’s minute order is not clerical work. 
 
The Court does not agree with the challenge to the December 15, 2023,
entry. Defendant cites an email and argues that it would not take 18 minutes to
oppose, but the entry is not about writing an email. It states, “Reviewed file,
communication with defense counsel re informal resolution of attorney fees,
costs and expenses.”
 
Defendant challenges Nita’s
work performed on the fee motion and states, “No fees for fee motion when
reasonable fees were offered.” The Court does not know what that statement
means. 
 
Defendant also opposes the
motion on bad faith grounds. But Defendant cites no law, and there is no law
supporting that the Court can deduct attorney fees for bad faith negotiation
tactics. 
 
Thus, the Court awards 19.8
hours of attorney work at $500.00 per hour for a total of $9,900.00 in attorney
fees for Nita. 
 
                   Attorney Wisnewski
 
Plaintiff does not challenge
Wisnewski’s billings. 
 
                   Staff
 
Regarding the attorney-client agreement, the Court subtracts the
0.2 hours legal assistant Jennifer Cruz spent preparing it and 0.4 hours legal
assistant Linda Heredia prepared the letter for it because those are tasks that
would not generally be billed to a paying client. (Rasooly v. Aetna
Life Ins. Co. (C.D. Cal. Mar. 25, 2021) No. CV 19-01927-JLS (KESx), 2021 WL
1583894, at *6.)
 
Like with attorney Nita, the Court finds many reasons for
challenging the entries to be speculative. For example, for the first September
6, 2022, entry, Defendant states, “Communication with client” is clerical work.
(Decl. Hopper, Exhibit A1.) Based only on Defendant’s statement, the Court
cannot ascertain Defendant’s speculations. Thus, the Court will not strike
them. The Court also finds the reasons given in the following entries
speculative: second and third September 7, 2022, entry; October 20, 2022 entry;
October 31, 2022 entry; second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth March 11, 2023
entry; October 16, 2023 entry. Thus, the Court strikes them. 
 
Also like with Nita,
Defendant challenges the staff members’ work performed on the fee motion and
states, “No fees for fee motion when reasonable fees were offered.” The Court
does not know what that statement means. Thus, the Court deducts 0.5 hours for
the May 20, 2024, entry and the last three entries. 
 
Defendant further challenges entries
because they are for clerical work. In general, purely “clerical” work is not
compensable. (See, e.g., Pierce v. County of Orange (C.D. Cal. 2012) 905
F.Supp.2d 1017, 1031.) Plaintiff does not dispute that purely clerical work is
not compensable. Thus, the Court strikes the following entries: second October
12, 2023 entry; October 30, 2023 entry; second and third November 29, 2023
entries; first December 13, 2023 entry; second and third December 20, 2023
entries; December 26, 2023 entry; the two January 23, 2024 entries; January 31,
2024 entry. 
 
Thus, the Court awards 3.9
hours of staff work for a total of $1,750.00. 
 
Costs
 
Plaintiffs included a memorandum
of costs as part of its motion. Defendants did not oppose or file a motion to
tax costs. 
 
Thus, the Court awards the costs
as requested. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1700(b).)
 
Hence, the motion is GRANTED IN
PART and DENIED IN PART.
