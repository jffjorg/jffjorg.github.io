And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to compel arbitration in this case. The defendant, Norm Reeves Hyundai Superstore Cerritos, moved to compel arbitration based on the retail installment sales contract that the plaintiff purchased a 2018 Hyundai Santa Fe Sport. The judge found that the defendant met its initial burden of proving the existence of an arbitration agreement by attaching a copy of the agreement to its motion. The plaintiff argued that the agreement was procedurally and substantively unconscionable, but the judge found that the plaintiff failed to show procedural unconscionability and that the agreement was not substantively unconscionable.

The judge also held that the Consumer Legal Rights Act (CLRA) and Unfair Competition Law (UCL) claims for injunctive relief are not subject to binding arbitration. The court cited several previous cases to support its decision, including Cruz v. PacifiCare Health Systems, Inc. (2003), which held that claims seeking injunctive relief designed to protect the public by stopping ongoing practices unlawful under the CLRA and UCL are not arbitrable.

The judge ordered the moving party to provide notice of the ruling and granted the motion to compel arbitration.
