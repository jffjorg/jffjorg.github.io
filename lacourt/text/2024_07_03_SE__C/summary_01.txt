And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to the defendants' verified amended responses to the plaintiff's Requests for Production of Documents, Set One. The plaintiff had requested that the defendants provide further responses to 32 specific requests, but did not provide evidence of good cause for the requests. The judge noted that the parties had agreed to extend the time to file a motion to compel further, and that the plaintiff had not argued good cause in their moving papers or separate statement. The judge also found that the parties had sufficiently met and conferred, but denied the motion to compel further responses due to the lack of evidence of good cause.
