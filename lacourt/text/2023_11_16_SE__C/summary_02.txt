Here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on Defendant FCA US LLC's Motion for Summary Adjudication of the First Cause of Action in the case of Petikyan v. FCA US LLC. The case involves a lemon law action filed by Plaintiff Arthur Petikyan, alleging that the 2021 RAM 1500 he purchased from a dealership was defective and that Defendant failed to repair or replace the vehicle as required by the express warranty.

The Judge has granted the Motion, finding that Defendant made a total purchase price offer in compliance with its obligations under the California Civil Code. The offer was made on September 7, 2022, and consisted of the actual purchase price of the vehicle, plus attorney's fees and costs. The Judge rejected Plaintiff's argument that Defendant's offers included improper offsets, finding that the offers were made in good faith and in compliance with the law.

The Judge also rejected Plaintiff's argument that the offers made after litigation was filed were not admissible, citing the California Code of Civil Procedure and the case of Dominguez v. American Suzuki Motor Corp. (2008) 160 Cal.App.4th 53. The Judge found that the Defendant complied with its obligations under the California Civil Code by making offers to repurchase or replace the vehicle, and that Plaintiff's damages did not exceed the value of the offers.
