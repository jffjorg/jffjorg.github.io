And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the unopposed motions to deem the Requests for Admissions (RFAs) admitted against both defendants, L&M FOOD SERVICES, INC. and TZVI ODZER. The RFAs were propounded on May 24, 2023, and no responses were filed from the defendants as of November 13, 2023. The judge finds that the defendants have failed to provide any responses, and therefore, the unopposed motion is granted. The judge also imposes mandatory sanctions under CCP §2033.280, ordering the defendants to pay $1,200.00 to the plaintiff and their counsel of record within 90 days of the court's issuance of the order.
