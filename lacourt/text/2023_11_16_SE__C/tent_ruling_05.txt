#6
 
James
W. Lewis and Slater Slater Schulman, LLP’s unopposed
motion to withdraw as counsel of record for Plaintiff JOHN DOE J.M. is GRANTED.  
 
Moving
Party to give Notice. 
 
No
Oppositions filed as November 13, 2023.     
 
The
Court finds that Counsel has met the procedural requirements, including proper
notice to the client at the last known residence or business address of the
client.  C.R.C. 3.1362.
 
Here,
Counsel’s declaration indicates that there has been a breakdown of the
attorney-client relationship. Where the issue (or conflict) is between the
lawyer and client(s), without implicating other parties, the court can rely on
counsel’s sworn declaration absent any reason to doubt the representations. 
 
There
is an undisputed breakdown in attorney-client communications. It does not
appear that Slater Slater Schulman, LLP’s continued representation would serve
the interests of justice. The motion to withdraw is GRANTED.  
 
There
is a Case Management Conference scheduled for November 16, 2023 in Dept. SE-F.  The parties may request a continuance in Dept.
SE-F, if necessary.
