LEASING, LLC v. LEE
CASE NO.:  22NWCV01767
HEARING: 11/16/23
 
#5
 
Plaintiff’s Motion to Set Aside Dismissal is CONTINUED to
Thursday, December 28, 2023 at 10:30 a.m. in Dept. SE-C. 
 
Moving Party to give Notice. 
 
No Opposition filed as of November 15, 2023. 
 
On April 17, 2023, Plaintiff’s Complaint was dismissed with
prejudice. Plaintiff now moves to set aside the dismissal under CCP §473(b). 
 
“The court may, upon any terms as may be just, relieve a
party or his or her legal representative from a judgment, dismissal, order, or
other proceeding taken against him or her through his or her mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. Application for this relief shall
be accompanied by a copy of the answer or other pleading proposed to be filed
therein, otherwise the application shall not be granted….” (emphasis
added.) (CCP §473(b).) 
 
Here, CCP §473(b)
requires Plaintiff to attach an amended complaint or other pleading because the
original complaint was dismissed.  This
was not done.  The terms of CCP §473(b)
are mandatory, compliance is not optional. 
 
This matter is
CONTINUED as indicated above to enable Plaintiff the opportunity to cure the
procedural defect so that this matter may proceed on the merits. 
Plaintiff is ORDERED
to re-file and re-serve an Amended Motion to Set Aside Dismissal accompanied by
an Amended Complaint or other pleading. The Amended Moving Papers, Opposition,
and Reply papers are to be filed and served per Code in accordance with the new
hearing date.
