Defendant
CITY OF SANTA FE SPRINGS’ Demurrer to Plaintiffs’ Complaint is OFF-CALENDAR
as MOOT. 
 
Moving
Party to give notice. 

No Opposition filed as of November 13, 2023.  


Defendant
CITY OF SANTA FE SPRINGS generally demurs to Plaintiffs’ Complaint. 
 
“A
party may amend its pleading once without leave of court at any time before the
answer, demurrer, or motion to strike is filed, or after a demurrer or motion
to strike is filed but before the demurrer or motion to strike is heard if
the amended pleading is filed and served no later than the date for filing an
opposition to the demurrer or motion to strike.” (emphasis added.) (CCP
§472.)  
 
The
subject Demurrer was filed on July 24, 2023, and the hearing is set for November
16, 2023. Plaintiffs’ Opposition was supposed to be filed and served by no
later than November 2, 2023. (CCP §1005(b).) 
 
Plaintiffs’
First Amended Complaint was filed without leave of Court on November 2, 2023 at
6:47 p.m. 
 
Defendant
argues that Plaintiffs’ FAC is untimely because it was not filed and served
prior to 5:00 p.m. on the date the Opposition was due. 
 
It
is well-settled that California recognizes “a general rule of…liberal allowance
of amendments…” (Nestle v. City of Santa Monica (1972) 6 Cal.3d 920,
939.) In the interests of judicial efficiency and in light of the liberal
policy concerning amendments, the Court utilizes its discretion to permit the
filing of the First Amended Complaint at 6:47 p.m. on November 2, 2023. The
First Amended Complaint is the operative pleading, and the Demurrer is placed
OFF-CALENDAR as MOOT.
