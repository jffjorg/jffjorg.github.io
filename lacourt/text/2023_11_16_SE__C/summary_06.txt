And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by the City of Santa Fe Springs to the complaint filed by C DURAN. The demurrer was filed on July 24, 2023, and the hearing was set for November 16, 2023. The plaintiffs' opposition was due by November 2, 2023. However, the plaintiffs filed a first amended complaint at 6:47 p.m. on November 2, 2023, which is after the deadline. The judge has decided to permit the filing of the first amended complaint, citing the liberal policy of allowing amendments in California. As a result, the demurrer is deemed moot, and the case will proceed with the first amended complaint as the operative pleading.
