LLC 
CASE NO.:  22NWCV00616
HEARING:  11/16/23
 
#4
 
Defendant FCA US LLC’s Motion for Summary Adjudication of
the First Cause of Action is GRANTED. 
 
Moving Party to give Notice.
 
This lemon law action was filed by Plaintiff ARTHUR PATIKYAN
(“Plaintiff”) on July 20, 2022.  
 
Plaintiff alleges that he purchased a 2021 RAM 1500
(“Subject Vehicle”), which was manufactured and/or distributed by Defendant FCA
US LLC (“Defendant”), from a dealership on or about May 19, 2021. (Complaint
¶¶6 and 8). Plaintiff received an express written warranty under which
Defendant agreed to perform any repairs or replacement of parts necessary to
ensure that the Subject Vehicle and its components were free from all defects
in material and workmanship, and to perform any adjustments necessary to maintain
the utility of the Subject Vehicle and the parts, components, and various
electrical and/or mechanical systems therein. (Complaint ¶9.) “Plaintiff
returned the SUBJECT VEHICLE to DEALER for repairs under the warranties
referenced… because it exhibited defects, nonconformities, maladjustments, or
malfunctions relating to the exhaust tips; oil sensor; check engine light
coming on; malfunctioning electronics system; vehicle losing power; and noise
in engine.” (Complaint ¶11.) 
 
Plaintiff alleges that Defendant has been unable to service
or repair the Subject Vehicle to conform to the express warranty after a
reasonable number of repair opportunities and that, despite this fact,
Defendant failed to promptly replace the Subject Vehicle or make restitution as
required under Cal. Civ. Code §§1793.2(d) and 1793.1(a).
 
The Complaint asserts the following causes of action: (1)
Breach of Express Warranty Obligations Under the Act; and (2) Breach of Implied
Warranty Under the Act. 
 
Defendant moves for summary adjudication of Plaintiff’s
first cause of action on the grounds that Defendant offered to replace or
repurchase the Subject Vehicle as early as August 2, 2022 (and apparently
continues to offer to replace or repurchase the Subject Vehicle) in compliance
with its obligations under Song-Beverly. Consequently, Defendant argues that
Plaintiff’s first cause of action fails as a matter of law. 
 
In Opposition, Plaintiff argues that summary adjudication
should be denied because Defendant did not repair the Subject Vehicle within a
reasonable number of attempts, and that Defendant’s offer to repurchase the
Subject Vehicle after the Complaint was filed is not a defense. 
 
Defendant proffers the following evidence in support of the
Motion: 
·       
On July 16, 2022, Plaintiff brought the Subject
Vehicle in for service. A technician at Russel Westbrook CDJR performed work on
the Subject Vehicle, test drove the Vehicle and found all systems were
operating as normal. (SSMF Nos 2-3.) 
·       
This action was filed on July 20, 2022. (SSMF
No. 4.) 
·       
On August 2, 2022, Defendant’s agent telephoned
Plaintiff to discuss repurchase of the Subject Vehicle. At the time of the
phone call, Defendant had not yet been made aware of this lawsuit. (SSMF Nos.
5-6.) 
·       
Defendant offered to repurchase the Subject
Vehicle during the August 2, 2022 phone call. (SSMF No. 7.) 
·       
On September 7, 2022, Defendant offered to
buyback the Subject Vehicle and pay Plaintiff’s attorney’s fees and costs.
(SSMF No. 9.) 
·       
On September 21, 2022, Plaintiff’s Attorney
responded to Defendant’s September 7, 2022 offer by stating: “We will resolve
this matter for $520,000.00 and repair of the Truck. In the alternative, we
will amend for fraud and pursue Civil Penalty and Punitive Damages.” (SSMF No.
10.) 
·       
At a February 24, 2023 MSC, Defendant offered to
buyback the Subject Vehicle for $145,137.57 plus attorney’s fees and costs, but
this offer was rejected. (SSMF No. 11.) 
·       
On June 20, 2023, Defendant offered to buyback
the Subject Vehicle for $145,137.57 plus pay Plaintiff’s attorney’s fees and
costs, but this offer was rejected. (SSMF No. 12.) 
 
In Opposition, Plaintiff objects to Defendant’s evidence
arguing that offers made after litigation is filed are not admissible. In
Plaintiff’s unsigned Declaration submitted in Opposition, Plaintiff states: “My
damages far exceed any claimed offer FCA says it made. FCA has never made me
whole nor offered to make me whole. My damages include a the [sic] amount paid
or payable, a replacement vehicle, insurance, and registration. These amounts
have never been offered or paid. Its claim of just over $147,000 being sufficient
is a fraud.” (Petikyan Decl., ¶4.) 
 
“If the manufacturer or its representative… is unable to
service or repair a new motor vehicle… to conform to the applicable express
warranties after a reasonable number of attempts, the manufacturer shall either
promptly replace the new motor vehicle… or promptly make restitution to the
buyer…. However, the buyer shall be free to elect restitution in lieu of
replacement, and in no event shall the buyer be required by the manufacture to
accept a replacement vehicle.” (Cal. Civ. Code §1793.2(d)(1)(2).) 
 
In Dominguez v. American Suzuki Motor Corp. (2008)
160 Cal.App.4th 53, 58-60, the Court addressed the liability of a manufacturer
under the Act after it made an offer to repurchase/replace. In Dominguez,
Defendant made an offer to repurchase the subject vehicle five weeks after
Plaintiff presented the vehicle to an authorized repair facility. A lawsuit was
field when an agreement could not be reached on attorney fees and costs. The Dominguez
court found the defendant complied with its obligation under  §1793.2(d)(2) to replace or reimburse the
buyer. 
 
Plaintiff’s cities to no evidence or authority to support
the argument that offers made after litigation is filed are not admissible.
Cal. Civ. Code §1793.2(d)(2) has no provision requiring a manufacturer to offer
to repurchase consumer goods within a specified time—it only requires that
restitution is made “promptly”. 
 
Here, Plaintiff brought the Subject Vehicle in for service
on or about July 16, 2022. (SSMF No. 2.) Plaintiff neither alleges nor offers
any evidence to show that he made any type of pre-litigation demand for
replacement or repurchase. It is undisputed that Plaintiff filed this action in
lieu of making any pre-litigation demand for replacement or repurchase. Notwithstanding,
on September 7, 2022, Defendant made an offer to repurchase for the full
purchase price, plus attorney’s fees and costs less than two months after
Plaintiff brought the Subject Vehicle in for service. (Tcheng Decl., ¶3., Ex.
B3.) This offer was rejected. 
 
Defendant’s September 7, 2022 letter offered to repurchase
the Subject Vehicle for the “actual price paid or payable… and to pay any
additional expenses incurred… less an offset for use….. In addition [to]
reasonable attorney’s fees and costs….” (Tcheng Decl., ¶3., Ex. B3.) Plaintiff
rejected this offer. (SSMF No. 10.) 
Plaintiff also rejected Defendant’s February 2023 and June 2023 offers
to repurchase the Subject Vehicle for $145,137.57 plus Plaintiff’s attorney’s
fees and costs. (SSMF Nos. 11 and 12.)
 
In Opposition, Plaintiff argues that Defendant’s Offers
include improper offsets, and maintains that the Subject Vehicle’s purchase
price was $160,768.48. (Opp. 4:13.) The Court notes that no Declaration of Jim
O. Whitworth has been received or filed in conjunction with the Opposition.
 
Notwithstanding Plaintiff’s arguments in Opposition, and as
evidenced in Reply, the total cash price of the Subject Vehicle was
$141,533.44. (Reply Tcheng Decl., ¶3, Ex. A.) Moreover, Defendant consistently
offered to pay for Plaintiff’s attorney’s fees and costs. 
 
The Court finds that Defendant made a total purchase price
offer in compliance with its obligations under the Act. Considering all
evidence and argument, the Motion is GRANTED.
