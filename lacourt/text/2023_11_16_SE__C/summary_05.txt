The judge has granted the unopposed motion of Slater Slater Schulman, LLP to withdraw as counsel of record for plaintiff JOHN DOE J.M. The motion was granted because the court found that the attorney-client relationship has broken down and that continued representation would not serve the interests of justice. The court relied on the counsel's sworn declaration and did not find any reason to doubt the representations. The motion to withdraw is effective immediately, and the parties may request a continuance at the upcoming Case Management Conference scheduled for November 16, 2023.
