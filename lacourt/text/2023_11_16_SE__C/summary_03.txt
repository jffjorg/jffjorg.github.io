And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the plaintiff's motion to set aside the dismissal of the complaint is continued to December 28, 2023, at 10:30 a.m. in Department SE-C. The plaintiff must give notice of the continued hearing. The motion was not opposed by the defendant as of November 15, 2023. The plaintiff's complaint was dismissed with prejudice on April 17, 2023, and the plaintiff is now seeking to set aside the dismissal under California Code of Civil Procedure section 473(b). However, the plaintiff failed to attach an amended complaint or other pleading to the motion, as required by CCP ยง473(b). The judge has ordered the plaintiff to re-file and re-serve an amended motion to set aside the dismissal, accompanied by an amended complaint or other pleading, in order to cure the procedural defect and allow the matter to proceed on the merits.
