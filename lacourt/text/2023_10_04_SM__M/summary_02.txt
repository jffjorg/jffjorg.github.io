And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the application of Matthew J. Blit to appear as counsel pro hac vice on behalf of plaintiff Jane Doe. The application satisfies the requirements of California Rule of Court 9.40, which allows attorneys licensed in another jurisdiction to appear in California courts on a limited basis. The declarations submitted by Blit and Lippincott, the attorney of record, provide the required information, including Blit's residence and office address, admission to practice in other courts, and status as a licensed attorney in good standing. The court finds that the application is complete and therefore GRANTS the application.
