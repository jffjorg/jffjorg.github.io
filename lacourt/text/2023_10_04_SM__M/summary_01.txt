And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the motion to vacate the default judgment entered against the defendants. The Judge finds that the plaintiff's declaration for publication of summons is defective as a matter of law, as it fails to demonstrate reasonable diligence in attempting service by other authorized methods. Specifically, the plaintiff knew the defendants' correct address, but did not attempt to serve them by mail or make other reasonable efforts before seeking publication. Additionally, the plaintiff failed to mail the entry of default to the defendants' known address, as required by law. As a result, the default judgment is void on its face, and the defendants' May 15, 2023 answer is the operative answer.
