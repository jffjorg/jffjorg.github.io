And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the motion to vacate the default judgment entered against the defendants. The Judge finds that the plaintiff's declaration for publication of summons is defective as a matter of law, as it fails to demonstrate reasonable diligence in attempting service by other authorized methods. Specifically, the plaintiff knew the defendants' correct address, but did not attempt to serve them by mail or make other reasonable efforts before seeking publication. Additionally, the plaintiff failed to mail the entry of default to the defendants' known address, as required by law. As a result, the default judgment is void on its face, and the defendants' May 15, 2023 answer is the operative answer.

## English Summary:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the defendants' motion to vacate the default judgment against them. The judge finds that the plaintiff's attempt to serve the defendants via publication was improper because the plaintiff knew the defendants' correct address and failed to exhaust other methods of service, such as mailing a copy of the summons and complaint. The judge also notes that the plaintiff failed to mail the entry of default to the defendants' known address, further supporting the decision to vacate the judgment.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion to vacate the default judgment. The plaintiff, 1850 Westwood LLC, failed to demonstrate reasonable diligence in attempting service by other authorized methods before seeking an order for publication of summons. The declaration for publication showed that the plaintiff knew the defendants' correct address, but did not attempt to serve them by mail. The plaintiff's failure to exhaust all methods of service and failure to mail the entry of default provide additional reasons to set aside the void default judgment. The judge has determined that the default judgment is void on its face and has granted the motion to vacate. The May 15, 2023, answer filed by the defendants is the operative answer.
