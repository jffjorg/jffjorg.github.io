Plaintiff/moving party: Plaintiff German Barrios is in pro per
Counsel for
Defendant: N/A
 
REQUEST FOR ENTRY OF DEFAULT JUDGMENT (filed 10/07/2024) 
 
TENTATIVE RULING 
 
Plaintiff’s request for default judgment is denied.
 
I. BACKGROUND
 
Plaintiff
German Barrios (“Plaintiff”), in pro per, filed this action against Defendants Gabriel
Angel Albanez, GG Investment Firm, Citadel Escrow, and George Gallardo
(collectively “Defendants”) on November 29, 2021. Plaintiff’s complaint alleges
breach of contract and fraud causes of action against Defendants. Plaintiff
alleges that Defendants breached their agreement with Plaintiff to buy
Plaintiff’s property so that foreclosure could be avoided. Plaintiff alleges
that Defendant Citadel Escrow concealed the fact that no monies were received
in escrow and induced Plaintiff to sign a blank grant deed. Plaintiff lost the
property as a result.
 
After
Plaintiff finally served Defendant Citadel Escrow (“Citadel”) and Citadel
failed to answer Plaintiff’s complaint, Plaintiff has attempted to obtain
default judgment against Citadel several times. Most recently, on October 7,
2024, Plaintiff filed another request for entry of default judgment. Plaintiff
also filed a Section 585(d) Declaration and a proposed judgment on that date.
 
II.DISCUSSION
 
A.      Legal
Standard
 
CCP § 585 permits entry of a judgment after a Defendant has
failed to timely answer after being properly served.  A party seeking
judgment on the default by the Court must file a Request for Court Judgment,
and: (1) a brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other admissible
evidence in support of the judgment requested; (3) interest computations as
necessary; (4) a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) a proposed form of
judgment; (6) a dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought;
(7) a dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an
application for separate judgment under CCP § 579, supported by a showing of
grounds for each judgment; (8) exhibits as necessary; and (9) a request for
attorneys’ fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties. 
(CRC Rule 3.1800.)

Plaintiff has not provided a summary of the case as
is required by CRC 3.1800. Plaintiff’s Section 585(d) declaration describes Citadel
as a now-dismissed defendant in this action, despite Plaintiff trying to obtain
the default judgment against Citadel. (Barrios Decl., ¶ 11.) It does not appear
that the Doe Defendants that were named in the complaint, nor Defendant George
Gallardo, have been dismissed from the case. The damages requested in
Plaintiff’s request for entry of default judgment do not match the requested
damages on Plaintiff’s proposed judgment, filed on Form JUD-100. Finally, the
evidence submitted with Plaintiff’s declaration in support of the judgment is
the same evidence that this Court had previously found to be insufficient.
 
Based on the foregoing, the Court cannot enter
default judgment against Defendant Citadel Escrow.
 
III.
CONCLUSION 
 
Plaintiff’s request for default judgment is denied.
