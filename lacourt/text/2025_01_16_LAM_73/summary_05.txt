And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied without prejudice the defendant's motion to set aside default. The motion was denied because the defendant failed to provide proof of service and did not accompany the motion with the required declaration. The defendant is seeking to set aside the default entered against him, alleging that he did not receive actual notice of the action. The judge noted that the defendant's motion was not properly served on the plaintiff and that the defendant failed to support his arguments with evidence. The judge also noted that the defendant's motion for sanctions under CCP section 128.7 was not properly made and that the court may impose sanctions if the defendant's claims are found to be frivolous. The case is set for a hearing on January 16, 2025.
