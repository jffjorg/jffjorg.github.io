And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The plaintiff, German Barrios, has requested entry of default judgment against Citadel Escrow, but the court has denied this request. The plaintiff has alleged that Citadel Escrow breached its agreement with him to buy his property, and that they concealed the fact that no monies were received in escrow and induced him to sign a blank grant deed, resulting in him losing the property. The court has found that the plaintiff has not provided a summary of the case as required by court rules, and that the evidence submitted in support of the judgment is insufficient. Additionally, the court notes that the damages requested in the plaintiff's request for entry of default judgment do not match the requested damages on the proposed judgment. Therefore, the court cannot enter default judgment against Citadel Escrow.
