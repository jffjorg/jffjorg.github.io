motion to set aside default is DENIED without prejudice.
 
Clerk to provide notice.
 
 
I. BACKGROUND
 
On October 29, 2024, Plaintiff Richard Duane Coleman brought this
action against Defendant Lynn Joseph Dorsey, II and Dorsey Logistics Inc,
alleging causes of action for defamation – slander, defamation – libel, and
defamation – pro se. 
The complaint alleges that Plaintiff was hired by
Defendant Dorsey Logistics as a commercial driver. Plaintiff alleges that
Defendant went online on the Los Angeles Police Department website and created
a false stolen vehicle police report that Plaintiff was terminated and advised
to bring the truck he was driving back to Los Angeles California but refused
to. Plaintiff alleges that he was charged with three felony charges: embezzlement,
attempted extortion, and malicious injury to property. 
On December 16, 2024, the clerk entered default
against Defendants.
On December 19, 2024, Defendant Dorsey filed this Motion to set aside default. No opposition has been filed.
 
II. ANALYSIS
 
A.      Legal
Standard 
 
CCP § 473.5(a) provides: “When
service of a summons has not resulted in actual notice to a party in time to
defend the action and a default or default judgment has been entered against
him¿or her¿in¿the¿action, he¿or she¿may serve and file a notice of motion to
set aside¿the¿default or default judgment and for leave to defend the action.¿ The¿notice of motion shall be served and filed within a reasonable time, but
in no event exceeding the earlier of: (i) two years after entry of a default
judgment against him¿or her; or (ii) 180 days after service on him¿or her¿of a
written notice that¿the¿default or default judgment has been entered.” (CCP § 473.5(a).)
 
“A notice of motion to set aside a default or default
judgment and for leave to defend the action shall designate as the time for
making the motion a date¿prescribed by subdivision (b) of Section 1005, and it
shall be accompanied by an affidavit showing under oath that¿the¿party's lack
of actual notice in time to defend the action was not caused by his¿or
her¿avoidance of service or inexcusable neglect.”  (CCP §
473.5(b).)   
 
“‘[A]ctual notice’ in section 473.5 ‘means genuine
knowledge of the party litigant . . . .’  [Citations.]  ‘[A]ctual
knowledge’ has been strictly construed, with the aim of implementing the policy
of liberally granting relief so that cases may be resolved on their
merits.’  [Citation.]”  (Ellard v. Conway (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 540,
547.)  “[A] party can make a motion showing a lack of actual notice not caused
by avoidance of service or inexcusable neglect . . .”  (Trackman v.
Kenney (2010) 187 Cal.App.4th 175, 180.)  “‘[I]t does not
require a showing that plaintiff did anything improper . . . . [T]he defaulting
defendant simply asserts that he or she did not have actual notice’.”  (Id.) 
 
“[I]f the court has acquired jurisdiction, i.e., summons
has been served, but service of summons has not resulted in actual notice to a
defendant, although the defendant has acquired actual knowledge of the action
from another source, this does not preclude a defendant from seeking relief
under section 473.5.”  (Ellard, 94 Cal.App.4th at 548.)   
 
B.      Discussion
 
Defendant moves to set aside entry of default against
him, arguing that he was not properly served with notice of this legal action.
 
There is no proof of service showing that the motion has been served
on Plaintiff. Failure to give notice of a motion is
not only a violation of the statutory requirements but of due process. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 1005; Jones v. Otero (1984) 156 Cal.App.3d 754,
757.) As such, the motion is denied without prejudice on this basis.
 
Further, “[a] notice of motion to set aside a default or
default judgment and for leave to defend the action shall designate as the time
for making the motion a date¿prescribed by subdivision (b) of Section 1005, and
it shall be accompanied by an affidavit showing under oath that¿the¿party's
lack of actual notice in time to defend the action was not caused by his¿or
her¿avoidance of service or inexcusable neglect.”  (CCP §
473.5(b).)   Defendant has failed to accompany his
motion with the required declaration. As such, the motion is also denied
without prejudice on this basis.
 
Defendant
also moves for sanctions and dismissal under CCP section
128.7, which states that a court may impose sanctions on a party or attorney
that presents a pleading, petition, motion, or other similar papers in the
following circumstances: 
 
1)
the document is presented primarily for an improper purpose, such as to harass
or to cause unnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of litigation. 
2)
the claims, defenses, and other legal contentions therein are not warranted by
existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for the extension, modification, or
reversal of existing law or the establishment of new law. 
3)
the allegations and other factual contentions have no evidentiary support; 
4)
the denials of factual contentions are not warranted on the evidence. 
 
CCP section
128.7 permits the Court to impose monetary sanctions on an attorney or an
unrepresented party that violates any one of these requirements. (Eichenbaum
v. Alon (2003) 106 Cal App 4th 967, 976.)  
 
Under section
128.7, a court may impose sanctions if it concludes a pleading was filed
for an improper purpose or was indisputably without merit, either legally or
factually. (Bucur v. Ahmad (2016) 244 Cal.App.4th 175, 189–190.)
However, “section 128.7 sanctions should be ‘made with restraint’ [Citation],
and are not mandatory even if a claim is frivolous.” (Peake v. Underwood
(2014) 227 Cal.App.4th 428. at 448.) 
 
After notice
and a hearing, a court may impose sanctions on an attorney, law firm, or party
that violates Code Civ. Proc., section 128.7(b), subject to the “safe harbor”
conditions specified in Code Civ. Proc., section 128.7(c). (Id.; Optimal
Markets, Inc. v. Salant (2013) 221 Cal.App.4th 912, 920.) 
 
The court
also cannot grant such relief at this time for the following various reasons.
First, a motion for sanctions under Code Civ. Proc.,
section 128.7 must be made separately from other motions and “shall describe
the specific conduct alleged to violate subdivision (b).” (Code Civ. Proc., §
128.7(c)(1).) Here, the motion is not made separately from the motion to set
aside. Second, the moving party serves notice of the motion for sanctions on
the offending party. (Code Civ. Proc., § 128.7(c)(1).) Here, there is no proof
of service indicating Plaintiff was served with the motion. Next, service of
the motion starts a safe harbor period during which the motion cannot be filed
with the court. (Id.) If the challenged paper, claim, defense,
contention, allegation or denial is not withdrawn or corrected within 21 days,
the second step is to file or present the motion for sanctions to the court
(i.e., presentment). (Code Civ. Proc., § 128.7(c)(2).)  If Plaintiff has not been served with the motion, then the safe
harbor period has not been complied with. Lastly, Defendant has failed to
support its arguments in the motion with any evidence.
 
The court notes that Defendant also seeks costs under CCP
section 1033.5. However, that section allows for costs to the prevailing party
under CCP section 1032. A
prevailing party is entitled to recover costs, as a matter of right, in any
action or proceeding absent a statute expressly noting otherwise. (Civ. Proc.
Code § 1032, subd. (b).) 
 
III. DISPOSITION

 
Accordingly,
Defendant’s motion to set aside is DENIED without prejudice.
