TENTATIVE RULING
 
Plaintiff Stearns Bank National Association’s motion for attorney fees
and costs is GRANTED.
 
Plaintiff is awarded $66,374.08 in fees and costs payable within 30 days of this
order. 
 
I. BACKGROUND
 
On July 29, 2022, Plaintiff Stearns Bank National Association
(“Plaintiff”) brought this action against Defendants B. Grigorovich D.D.S.,
Inc., Boris Grigorovich (“Defendants”); and DOES 1 through 10, inclusive for
(1) breach of equipment finance agreement (no. 1); (2) breach of equipment
finance agreement (no. 2); (3) breach of guaranty (no. 1); and (4) breach of
guaranty (no. 2). 
 
On September 19, 2022, Defendants filed an Answer.
 
On November 7, 2022, this Court sustained in part Plaintiff’s
demurrer to answer as to affirmative defenses 2 through 12, 14 through17, 19
through 21, 25 through 28, and 32. 
 
On December 6, 2022, Defendants filed an Amended Answer. On
December 7, 2022, Defendant Boris Grigorovich filed a Cross-Complaint against
Invasix, Inc. (“Cross-Defendant”) for (1) breach of oral contract; (2) fraud;
(3) unjust enrichment; (4) violation of Civ. Code §§ 1709-1710; and (5)
equitable indemnity.
 
On November 2, 2023, this Court sustained with leave to amend
Cross-Defendant’s demurrer to cross-complaint as to its entirety and rendered
the motion to strike moot. 
 
On January 9, 2024, the Cross-Complaint was stricken for lack of
prosecution. 
 
On October 1, 2024, this Court granted Plaintiff’s motion for
summary judgment. On October 21, 2024, the Court entered judgment in favor of
Plaintiff against Defendants, jointly and severally in the amount of
$436,475.40 including items allowable as costs under Code of Civil Procedure
Section 1032. 
 
On October 31, 2024, Plaintiff filed its Memorandum of Costs
(“MOC”).
 
On December 11, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant Motion for Attorney
Fees, arguing:
·               
Plaintiff reasonably incurred attorney’s
fees in the amount of $64,453.50 from 11/9/21 through 10/20/24 to enforce its
rights under the Agreements and Guarantees;
·               
Plaintiff as the prevailing party in
this action is entitled to an award of all these fees and costs pursuant to
Civil Code Section 1717, Code of Civil Procedure Sections 1032 and 1033.5, and
California Rules of Court, rule 3.1702. 
No opposition has been filed.  
 
II. ANALYSIS
 
A.      Legal
Standard for Motion for Attorney Fees
 
“In any
action on a contract, where the contract specifically provides that attorney’s
fees and costs, which are incurred to enforce that contract, shall be awarded
either to one of the parties or to the prevailing party, then the party who is
determined to be the party prevailing on the contract, whether he or she is the
party specified in the contract or not, shall be entitled to reasonable
attorney’s fees in addition to other costs.” (Civ. Code, § 1717, subd.
(a).) 
 
The
prevailing party has the burden of showing that the requested attorney fees
were “reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation, and were
reasonable in amount.” (Robertson v. Fleetwood Travel Trailers of California
Inc.¿(2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 785, 817.) The party seeking attorney fees “
‘is not necessarily entitled to compensation for the value of attorney services
according to [his] own notion or to the full extent claimed by [him].’ ” (Levy
v. Toyota Motor Sales, USA, Inc.¿(1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 807,
816.)¿¿Therefore, if the “time expended or the monetary charge being made for
the time expended are not reasonable under all the circumstances, then the
court must take this into account and award attorney fees in a lesser amount.”
(Nightingale v. Hyundai Motor America¿(1994) 31 Cal.App.4th 99, 104.)¿¿ 
 
A court may “reduce
a fee award based on its reasonable determination that a routine, noncomplex
case was overstaffed to a degree that significant inefficiencies and inflated
fees resulted.”¿¿(Morris v. Hyundai Motor America¿(2019) 41 Cal.App.5th
24, 39.)¿¿It is also appropriate to reduce an award based on inefficient or
duplicative efforts. (Id.¿at p. 38.) However, the analysis must be
“reasonably specific” and cannot rely on general notions of fairness. (Kerkeles¿v.
City of San Jose¿(2015) 243 Cal.App.4th 88,¿102.)¿¿Moreover, in conducting
the analysis, courts are not permitted to tie any reductions in the fee award
to some proportion of the buyer’s damages recovery. (Warren v. Kia Motors
America, Inc.¿(2018) 30 Cal.App.5th 24, 39.)
 
B.      Analysis
 
Plaintiff
moves for an order awarding it a total of $66,374.08 in attorney’s fees and
costs consisting of (1) $43,173.50 in fees for Frandzel, Robins, Bloom &
Csato, L.C. (“FRBC”); (2) $21,280.00 in fees for Hemar, Rousso & Heald, LLP
(“HRH”); and (3) $1,920.00 in costs from HRH (requested via Memorandum of
Costs).
 
 
1.     
Timeliness of
Motion 
 
California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1702, subdivision (b), provided in
pertinent part: “A notice of motion to claim attorney's fees for services up to
and including the rendition of judgment in the trial court--including
attorney's fees on an appeal before the rendition of judgment in the trial
court--must be served and filed within the time for filing a notice of appeal
under rules 8.104 and 8.108 in an unlimited civil case or under rules 8.822 and
8.823 in a limited civil case.” Thus, “[i]n an unlimited civil action such as
the case before us, that deadline ordinarily falls 60 days after notice of
entry of judgment, or 180 days after entry of judgment, whichever is first.” (Kaufman
v. Diskeeper Corp. (2014) 229 Cal.App.4th 1, 8; Cal. Rules of Ct., rule
8.104.)
 
Here, the entry of judgment on the summary judgment motion’s ruling
occurred on October 21, 2024. As such, Plaintiff has until July 16, 2025 to
file the present motion. The motion was filed on December 11, 2024. Therefore,
Plaintiff’s motion is timely. 
 
2.     
Entitlement
to Attorney’s Fees 
 
Furthermore, Plaintiff basis for this instant motion is due to the ruling
on its summary judgment motion. Specifically, Plaintiff contends it is the
prevailing party under the terms of the Agreements and Guarantees because its
summary judgment motion was granted by this Court. The Court agrees. On October
1, 2024, this Court granted summary judgment on Plaintiff’s claims of breach of
the Agreements and Guarantees. (Min. Order, filed 10/2/24.) Subsequently, this
Court entered judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendants pursuant to
its summary judgment motion ruling. (Judgment, filed 10/21/24.) Moreover, under
the terms of the Agreements and Guarantees, the prevailing party would recover
reasonable attorney’s fees and costs incurred in a lawsuit to enforce the
contracts. Thus, Plaintiff is entitled to attorney’s fees per Civil Code
Section 1717. 
 
i.                   
Attorney Hours 
 
Moreover, two separate law firms worked on this case for Plaintiff. Frandzel, Robins, Bloom & Csato, L.C. (“FRBC”) worked on this atter from July 29, 2022
until February 7, 2024. A substitution of attorney was filed on February 7,
2024, and indicated Hemar, Rousso & Heald, LLP (“HRH”) would
represent Plaintiff moving forward. HRH represented until the ruling on the
summary judgment motion. 
 
The hourly rates to be used in computing the lodestar must be “within
the range of reasonable rates charged by and judicially awarded comparable
attorneys for comparable work.”  (Children's
Hospital & Medical Center v. Bonta´ (2002) 97 Cal.App.4th 740, 783; PLCM
Group, Inc. v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095  (“The reasonable hourly rate is that
prevailing in the community for similar work”). 
Particularly where it is difficult to obtain evidence of market based
rates for the same type of work, the courts look at fees charged for cases
requiring similar skills.  (The
Utility Reform Network v. Public Utilities Com. (2008) 166 Cal.App.4th 522,
536–537; Prison Legal News v. Schwarzenegger (9th Cir.2010) 608 F.3d
446, 454–455 (“all attorneys in the community engaged in ‘equally complex
Federal litigation,’ no matter the subject matter”).  
 
In determining the reasonable rate and reasonable hours, the Court
looks to that “prevailing in the community for similar work.”  (PLCM Group, Inc., supra, 22
Cal.4th at 1095; Ketchum, supra, 24 Cal.4th at 1132 (“the lodestar is
the basic fee for comparable legal services in the community”).  “A reasonable trial court might determine
that the ‘similar work’ or ‘comparable legal services’ related to insurance
defense litigation, rather than to civil litigation in general. Were the court
to so conclude, it could view the relevant ‘market’ to be that of insurance
defense litigation and litigators, rather than general civil litigation. The
“market rate” for such services might be limited accordingly. Again, we
emphasize that such determinations lie within the broad discretion of the trial
court.”  (Syers Properties III, Inc.
v. Rankin (2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 691, 702–703.)
 
The burden is on the fee applicant to produce evidence that the
requested rates are in line with those prevailing in the community for similar
work.  (ComputerXpress, Inc. v.
Jackson (2001) 93 Cal.App.4th 993, 1019.) 
“Affidavits of the plaintiffs' attorney and other attorneys regarding
prevailing fees in the community, and rate determinations in other cases,
particularly those setting a rate for the plaintiffs' attorney, are
satisfactory evidence of the prevailing market rate.”  (Heritage Pacific Financial, LLC v. Monroy
(2013) 215 Cal.App.4th 972, 1009.) The trial court is not required to adopt
counsel’s opinion as to the “market rate” for services of the type
performed.  (Syers Properties III,
supra, 226 Cal.App.4th at 702.) 
The trial court may accept the actual rate charged as the reasonable
rate.  (Id.) 
 
Hal D.
Goldflam submits a declaration attesting to FRBC attorneys incurring $43,173.50
in attorney’s fees to represent Plaintiff from November 9, 2021 to February 28,
2024 at the hourly rates of $282.27 to $575.00. (Goldflam Decl., ¶¶2-4, Exs.
1-24.) Specifically, Mr. Goldflam attest to FRBC incurring fees to (1) draft
pre-filing demand letters; (2) drafting the Complaint; (3) drafting two sets of
written discovery requests to Defendants; (4) litigating a demurrer to
Defendants’ Answer to the Complaint; (5) responding to Defendants’ written
discovery requests, including making a voluminous document production; (6)
addressing issues arising from Cross-Defendant Invasix, Inc.’s involvement in
the case; and (7) attending several hearing in this action for a total of 91.9
hours. (Id.) These hours are supported by billing invoices and relate
directly to the pre-litigation and litigation of this case. (Id.)
 
Similarly,
Christopher D. Crowell submits a declaration attesting to HRH attorneys
incurring $21,28.00 in attorney’s fees to represent Plaintiff in this case from
January 31, 2024 to October 18, 2024 at an hourly rate of $350.00. (Crowell
Decl., ¶¶2-4, Exs. 25-33.) HRH incurred fees for: (1) propounding an additional
set of written discovery requests to Defendants; (2) filing six motions to
compel discovery responses, which the court granted; and (3) preparing a
dispositive motion, which required a lengthy review of Plaintiff’s invoices,
loan histories, and other files to explain in detail the calculations giving
rise to Plaintiff’s loan balances. These hours are supported by the billing
invoices and relate directly to the work performed from time HRH was
substituted in as counsel until the granting of the summary judgment motion. (Id.)
 
Both Goldflam
and Crowell attest to these rates being the comparable rates charged by
attorneys in Los Angeles who practice business and commercial litigation with
their level of experience. (Goldflam Decl., ¶5; Crowell Decl., ¶¶5-6.)
 
Therefore,
Plaintiff has shown that the time spent by both law firms who represented it in
this action were reasonably incurred and necessary to litigate this matter. 
3.     
Costs 
 
“A prevailing party who claims costs must serve and
file a memorandum of costs within 15 days after the date of service of the
notice of entry of judgment or dismissal by the clerk under Code of Civil
Procedure section 664.5 or the date of service of written notice of entry of
judgment or dismissal, or within 180 days after entry of judgment, whichever is
first. The memorandum of costs must be verified by a statement of the party,
attorney, or agent that to the best of his or her knowledge the items of cost
are correct and were necessarily incurred in the case.”(Cal. Rules of Ct., rule
3.1700(a)(1).)
 
To recover a cost, it must be reasonably necessary to
the litigation and reasonable in amount. (Perko’s Enterprises, Inc. v. RRNS
Enterprises (1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 238, 244.) If the items appearing in a
cost bill appear to be proper charges, the burden is on the party seeking to
tax costs to show that they were not reasonable or necessary. (Ladas v.
California State Automotive Assoc. (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 761, 773-74.)¿ On
the other hand, if the items are properly objected to, they are put in issue
and the burden of proof is on the party claiming them as costs. (Id.)¿¿¿
 
Here, the items are on the Memorandum of Costs (“MOC”)
appear to be proper charges for costs allowable pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure Section 1033.5.  Specifically,
Plaintiff seeks $1,920.00 for HRH consisting of: (1) $795.00 – filing and
motion fees; (2) $474.98 – service of process fees; and (3) $650.60 –
electronic filing or service. Finally, Defendants have not challenged these
costs via a Motion to Tax Costs. 
 

III. DISPOSITION
 
Based on the foregoing,
Plaintiff Stearns Bank National Association’s motion for attorney’s fees and
costs is GRANTED. 
 
Plaintiff is awarded $66,374.08 in fees and costs payable within 30 days of
this order.
