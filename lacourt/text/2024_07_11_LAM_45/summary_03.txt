And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case between Philip Markowitz and Foremost Insurance Company, granting the defendant's motion to strike punitive damages allegations from the complaint. The complaint alleges that the defendant failed to provide coverage and unreasonably delayed in making a coverage determination on Markowitz's claim. The judge finds that Markowitz's punitive damages allegations are insufficient, as they lack specific facts showing malice, fraud, or oppression. The judge orders the complaint to be amended to remove the punitive damages allegations. The parties have 20 days to comply with the order.
