The plaintiff, Annie Lin, filed a motion for a default judgment, but the court has decided to continue the motion due to the plaintiff's failure to comply with California Rules of Court Rule 3.1800. Specifically, the plaintiff filed outdated forms (CIV-100: 2007, JUD-100: 2002) instead of the current versions (CIV-100: 2023, JUD-100: 2024). The court is giving the plaintiff an opportunity to resubmit the correct forms before proceeding with the motion.
