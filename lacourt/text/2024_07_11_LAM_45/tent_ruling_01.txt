OSC Re: Default Judgment             
The Court considered the moving papers. 
            The motion is CONTINUED to allow
Plaintiff to resubmit the correct Judicial Council CIV-100 and JUD-100 forms. 
 
            The Court notes that
Plaintiff failed to comply with California Rules of Court
Rule 3.1800 because she filed outdated CIV-100 and
JUD-100 forms. The application was submitted on January 3, 2024, but Plaintiff
filed the CIV-100 form dated January 1, 2007, and the JUD-100 form dated
January 1, 2002. The current CIV-100 form is dated January 1, 2023 and the
JUD-100 form is dated January 1, 2024. 
 
 
            It
is so ordered.
