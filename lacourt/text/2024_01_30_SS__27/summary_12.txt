And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that Downtown L.A. Law Group (DLA) should be disqualified from representing plaintiff Vannessa Ramos in this case. The motion to disqualify was filed by defendant Costco Wholesale Corporation, which argues that DLA attorney Anthony Werbin has a conflict of interest due to his prior representation of Costco in several cases, including two negligence/premises liability cases involving the same Los Feliz store location. The court finds that Werbin gained confidential information from his prior representations that would be material to litigating the current matter and would provide an unfair advantage to Ramos.

The court notes that DLA has a firm policy of not assigning Werbin to any cases involving Costco, and that the firm has implemented ethical screening measures to prevent Werbin from sharing confidential information with other attorneys in the firm. However, the court is concerned that DLA failed to provide written notice to Costco of their representation, and that the firm's measures may not be sufficient to guarantee an effective ethical wall.

The court concludes that DLA should be disqualified from representing Ramos in this case to preserve public trust in the scrupulous administration of justice and the integrity of the bar. The motion is granted, and the parties who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the court indicating their intention to submit.
