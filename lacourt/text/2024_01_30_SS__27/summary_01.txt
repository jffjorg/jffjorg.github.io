And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to be relieved as counsel filed by Suzanna Abrahamian, Tigran Martinian, and Andre Sherman, on behalf of Adi Ake Lopez and others, against the State of California. The motion was filed on January 8, 2024, and states that there has been a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship. The court has discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw, but the motion should be granted only if there is no prejudice to the client and does not disrupt the orderly process of justice. The court found that there is no apparent prejudice, but noted that the declaration and order lack specific details on the OSC (Order to Show Cause) and the client's address. The court denied the motion without prejudice, requiring counsel to make a concerted effort to locate and notify the client. The parties are required to submit on the tentative ruling by email to the court, and may still appear at the hearing to argue the matter.
