Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge granted some of the motions to compel further responses to defendants' demands, but denied others. The court ordered defendants to serve further, verified, and code-compliant responses to the granted demands. The court also imposed sanctions of $1,000 against each defendant. The judge found that some of the defendants' responses were evasive and failed to provide sufficient information to allow the court to determine whether the asserted privilege and work product claims were valid. The court also found that some of the defendants' objections were unpersuasive and failed to provide a sufficient basis for withholding documents and things.
