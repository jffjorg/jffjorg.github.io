And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The City of Santa Monica has moved to dismiss the case against it, claiming that the plaintiff, Hughy Addison, failed to amend his complaint after a demurrer was sustained. The plaintiff initially filed a handwritten complaint in pro per, alleging motor vehicle negligence and seeking punitive damages. The court sustained the demurrer and gave the plaintiff 20 days to amend the complaint. However, the deadline passed without the plaintiff filing an amended complaint. The defendant has now moved to dismiss the case, citing the plaintiff's failure to comply with the court's order. The judge has granted the motion, concluding that the defendant's motion is proper and that the plaintiff has failed to file an amended complaint despite being given multiple opportunities to do so.
