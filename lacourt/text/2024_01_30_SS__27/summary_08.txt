And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendants' motion to continue the trial, but only for 60 days, rather than the 120 days requested. The trial will now be held on July 23, 2024. The judge has also ordered the parties to complete their discovery and to engage in mediation efforts, with the goal of resolving the case without the need for a trial. The judge has denied the defendants' request for a longer continuance, citing the lack of prejudice to the parties or witnesses and the need to keep the court's calendar from becoming congested.
