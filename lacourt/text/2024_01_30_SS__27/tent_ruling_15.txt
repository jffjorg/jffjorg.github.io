On February 6, 2023, Plaintiff Eun Chu
Kim (“Plaintiff”) filed this motor vehicle negligence against Defendant Diego
Eduardo Chiguil Chan (“Defendant”). On December 19, 2023, Plaintiff filed the
instant motion to deem the truth of the matters specified in Request for
Admissions, Set One. Defendant opposes.
Deem Admitted
Where a party fails to timely respond
to a request for admission, the propounding party may move for an order that
the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the
requests be deemed admitted.  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).)  The party
who failed to respond waives any objections to the demand, unless the court
grants them relief from the waiver, upon a showing that the party (1) has subsequently
served a substantially compliant response, and (2) that the party’s failure to
respond was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subds.
(a)(1)-(2).)  The court shall grant a
motion to deem admitted requests for admissions, “unless it finds that the
party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has served, before
the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests for admission
that is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)
Defendant served discovery responses on
January 18, 2024, after the filing of the motion. (Lajevardi Decl., ¶2, Exh. A.)
Accordingly, the motion is MOOT. 
Monetary Sanctions
Where a party fails to provide a timely
response to requests for admission, “[i]t is mandatory that the court impose a
monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) on the
party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a timely response to
requests for admission necessitated this motion.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)
Plaintiff request sanctions in the
amount of $2,061.25. Although Defendant responded to the discovery, Defendant’s
conduct necessitated the filing of this motion. Thus, sanctions are warranted.
Sanctions are granted in the reduced amount of $1061.65 against Defendant and
Defendant’s counsel, jointly and severally. 
Sanctions are to be paid within 30 days of this order directly to
Plaintiff’s counsel.
Moving party to give notice.
 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SSCDEPT27@lacourt.org indicating

Please be advised that if you submit on the tentative and elect not to
appear at the hearing, the opposing party may nevertheless appear at the
hearing and argue the matter.  Unless you receive a submission from all
other parties in the matter, you should assume that others might appear at the
hearing to argue.
