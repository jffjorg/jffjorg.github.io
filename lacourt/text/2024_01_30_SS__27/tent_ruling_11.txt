I.         INTRODUCTION 
On May 19, 2022, Eduardo Antonio Fuentes
Medina (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Amazon.com Services LLC (“Amazon”),
Rapid Pasadena Services, LLC (“RPS”), and Mark Ronnie Ramos (“Ramos”),
asserting causes of action for (1) general negligence, (2) vicarious liability,
(3) negligent hiring, training, retention and supervision, (4) negligent
entrustment, and (5) joint enterprise. Plaintiff alleges Ramos was driving a
motor vehicle in the course and scope of his employment with Amazon and RPS
when he collided with Plaintiff’s vehicle on September 24, 2020. On February
22, 2023, Plaintiff filed an amendment to the Complaint naming Rapid Logistics
Courier, LLC (“Rapid Logistics”) as Doe 1.
On
November 22, 2022, Plaintiff served RPS (“Defendant”) its first Notice of
Taking Deposition of Defendant’s person most knowledgeable (“PMK”), and
requested for production of documents. However, the first deposition was taken
off calendar because no responses were received from Defendant. 
Between
November 22, 2022, and August 14, 2023, Plaintiff and Defendant engaged in
discussion, trying to confirm a potential date for the deposition of
Defendant’s PMK. 
On
August 14, 2023, Plaintiff served Defendant its Second Notice of Taking
Deposition of Defendant’s PMK for October 3, 2023. 
On
September 21, 2023, Defendant informed Plaintiff that its PMK would not be
available for the scheduled deposition, requesting a new deposition date on
October 11, 2023. 
On
September 22, 2023, Plaintiff served Defendant its Third Notice of Taking
Deposition of Defendant’s PMK for October 11, 2023, at 10 a.m. 
On
September 27, 2023, Defendant served Plaintiff its Objection to each category
and request for production of documents in Plaintiff’s Third Notice of
Deposition. 
On October
11, 2023, around 8 a.m. on the day of the scheduled deposition, Defendant
informed Plaintiff that its PMK became unavailable due to unforeseen
circumstances. Plaintiff took a Certificate of Nonappearance, incurring late
cancellation fees. Following the nonappearance, Plaintiff requested Defendant
to provide information regarding the alleged unforeseen circumstances as well
as a date certain for deposition in the next ten days. 
On
October 20, 2023, Plaintiff filed the instant Motion to Compel Deposition of
Defendant’s PMK and Production of Documents, along with a Request for
Sanctions. 
On
October 31, 2023, Plaintiff and Defendant confirmed the date of December 4,
2023, for the deposition with Defendant’s PMK. On the same day, Plaintiff
served Defendant its Fourth Notice of Deposition.  
On
December 4, 2023, the deposition for Defendant’s PMK occurred. 
On
December 12, 2023, Defendant filed its Opposition to Plaintiff’s Motion to
Compel Deposition of Defendant’s PMK, Production of Document, and Sanctions,
arguing that Plaintiff’s motion is moot because the deposition occurred on
December 4, 2023, after Plaintiff filed her motion but before the hearing on
it. 
On
December 18, 2023, Plaintiff filed a Reply to Defendant’s Opposition. 
II.        LEGAL STANDARDS 
Any
party may obtain discovery by taking in California the oral deposition of any
person.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.010.) If the deponent is a¿party, the notice by itself¿compels production¿of the documents. (Code Civ. Proc. §¿2025.280, subd. (a).) 
“If,
after service of a deposition notice, a party to the action…without having
served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails to appear for
examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for inspection any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the
deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move for an order compelling
the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the production for inspection of
any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in
the deposition notice.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc., §
2025.450, subd. (a).) 
“If a
deponent fails to answer any question or to produce any document … under the
deponent’s control that is specified in the notice … the party seeking
discovery may move the court for an order compelling that answer or
production.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.480, subd. (a).) Additionally, the motion
to compel under section 2025.480 subdivision (a) shall be made no later than 60
days after the completion of the record of the deposition, and shall be
accompanied by a meet and confer declaration. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.480,
subd. (b).) 
III.      DISCUSSION 
Plaintiff
seeks an order from the court compelling Defendant to take the following
actions: (1) produce a PMK to answer and testify regarding the remaining
outstanding categories that were not addressed, and (2) produce documents
responsive to the thirty requests for production outlined in Plaintiff’s Notice
of Deposition or provide proper responses to the same. Additionally, Plaintiff
requests the court to impose sanctions in the amount of $2,919.70 against
Defendant and its counsel, jointly and severally, in favor of Plaintiff. 
In its
Opposition, Defendant, argues that Plaintiff’s instant motion is moot as
Defendant’s PMK was deposed on December 4, 2023. (Stecker Decl., ¶ 10.) 
In his
Reply, Plaintiff contends that the motion is not moot due to the PMK deponent’s
insufficient answers at the December 4, 2023 deposition, asserting two main
points: (1) Defendant failed to provide answers to the remaining categories 1,
3, 7, 8, 11, 12, 22, 23, 24, 26, and (2) Defendant did not produce any of the
30 documents requested at the PMK deposition. Moreover, Plaintiff raises
concerns that the insufficient answers resulted from Defendant’s failure to
produce a qualified PMK deponent. 
Several
sections of the Code of Civil Procedure, including sections 2025.450 and
2025.480, authorize a party seeking an oral deposition inside California to
move to compel answers or production of documents. Plaintiff’s instant motion
only cites authorities under section 2025.450. Thus, the court proceeds to
analyze Plaintiff’s authority under this section, at the outset.  
Subdivision
(a) of  section 2025.450 provides, “if after service of a deposition
notice, a party … without having served a valid objection … fails to
appear for examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for inspection any
document … in the deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move for
an order compelling the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the production
for inspection of any document … described in the deposition notice.” (Italic
added.) Furthermore, a motion under subdivision (a) must comply with the
following: “ … (2) The motion shall be accompanied [by a declaration] … when
the deponent fails to attend the deposition and produce the
documents, … or things described in the deposition notice, by a declaration
stating that the petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire about the
nonappearance.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (b).) (Italic
added.)  
The
language in Section 2025.450 specifically indicates that its application is
contingent on the nonoccurrence of a deposition. This is evident in its
consideration of a particular scenario when “the deponent fails to attend the
deposition and produce the documents.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450,
subd. (b).) (Italic added.) Therefore, if the deponent does attend the
deposition, this section does not apply. 
In
contrast, Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.480 subdivision (a) provides
that “If a deponent fails to answer any question or to produce any
document … that is specified in the deposition notice … the party seeking
discovery may move the court for an order compelling that answer or
production.” Additionally, this motion “shall be made no later than 60 days after
the completion of the record of the deposition ….” (Code Civ. Proc., §
2025.480, subd. (b).) (Italic added.) Section 2025.480 uses language such as “after
the completion of the record of the deposition,” indicating its purpose is
to allow the party seeking oral deposition to compel further answers and
documents after a completed deposition.  
This
interpretation aligns with the distinction between the terms “deponent” in
section 2025.480 and “party” used in section 2025.450, particularly in the
context of conditions outlined for the party’s right to compel. A person
attains the status of a “deponent” upon being sworn in at the start of the
deposition. In the absence of a deposition, this role does not
exist. Consequently, this distinction clarifies the purposes of these two
sections – section 2025.450 is applicable when the deposition never occurred,
whereas section 2025.480 applies when a deposition has taken place, but the
party seeking the oral deposition considers the deponent’s answers or documents
insufficient. 
Here,
there is no dispute over two key facts: (1) the deposition underlying the
instant motion occurred on December 4, 2023; (Stecker Decl., ¶ 9. Exh. “1.”); and
(2) Plaintiff, who is seeking discovery, has accepted some (though not all) of
the answers from the deponent, and is now moving to compel additional answers
for the remaining categories, along with the production of the documents.
(Pl.’s Reply, at pp. 4-5.). 
Therefore,
based on these two undisputed facts, Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.480,
rather than section 2025.450, governs Plaintiff’s right to sustain a motion to
compel. Plaintiff moved under the wrong statute; hence, the court determines
that the motion was moot on its face as the deposition underlying the motion
was completed on December 4, 2023.  
Additionally,
the motion fails to meet section 2025.480 requirements, which mandates a
specific timeframe for filing the motion after the completion of the
deposition. Plaintiff filed the instant motion on October 20, 2023, while the
deposition occurred on December 4, 2023. Consequently, Plaintiff’s instant
motion is defective even under section 2025.480.  
Accordingly,
Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Defendant to Produce PMK, production of documents
is DENIED. 
Regarding
Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions, he has sought $2,919.70 in monetary
sanctions under Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.030. This amount is based
on a $300.00 hourly rate, encompassing 4 hours for preparing the instant
motion, and 4 hours for anticipated researching on the Opposition and preparing
a Reply, and appearing at the hearing, (Pl.’s motion, at p.12, Gomez Decl. ¶
17.), along with $459.70 later cancellation fee incurred at the October 11,
2023 deposition, and $60.00 filing fee.  
However,
due to mootness, Plaintiff fails to make the motion to compel deposition and
production of documents, which forms the basis for its request for sanctions.
Therefore, the court DENIES Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions against
Defendant.  
IV.      CONCLUSION 
Plaintiff’s
motion to compel the deposition of Defendant’s PMK, production of documents,
and request for sanctions are DENIED without prejudice.  
Moving
party to give notice.
