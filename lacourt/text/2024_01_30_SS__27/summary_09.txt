And here is a brief summary in English:

The tentative ruling addresses two motions for protective orders filed by the defendants, Fullerton Island Village Apartments, LLC, et al. The first motion seeks to preclude the plaintiff, Lorie Benson, from taking a second deposition of a key witness, Fullerton Island PMQ, and to impose monetary sanctions on the plaintiff and her attorney. The court finds that the motion is now moot because the plaintiff has withdrawn the second deposition notice, but declines to rule on the possibility of re-noticing the deposition. The second motion seeks to postpone the videotaped depositions of the plaintiff's treating doctors until after the defendants have taken discovery depositions of those doctors. The court grants this motion, finding that the defendants need time to prepare for cross-examination.
