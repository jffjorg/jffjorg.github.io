And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling is in response to a motion filed by Plaintiff Eduardo Antonio Fuentes Medina to compel Defendant Amazon.com Services LLC, et al. to produce their person most knowledgeable (PMK) for deposition and to produce documents. The Plaintiff argues that the Defendant failed to appear for deposition on October 11, 2023, and failed to provide sufficient answers to the deposition questions. The Defendant argues that the motion is moot since the deposition occurred on December 4, 2023.

The court finds that the Plaintiff's motion is based on the wrong statute, California Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.450, which applies when a deposition never occurred. Since the deposition did occur, the court finds that California Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.480 applies, which requires a motion to compel deposition and production of documents to be filed within 60 days after the completion of the deposition. Since the motion was filed on October 20, 2023, more than 60 days before the deposition, the court finds that the motion is defective and denies it.

The court also denies the Plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions, which was based on the failed deposition and the cost of preparing the motion. The court finds that the motion failed to comply with the requirements for a motion to compel deposition and production of documents.

The tentative ruling is subject to submission by the parties and may be adopted as the final order unless the parties elect to appear at the hearing and argue the matter.
