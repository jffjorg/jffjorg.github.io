And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to continue the trial date and re-open discovery. The plaintiff had requested a continuance due to ongoing medical issues and the need to consult with a spine surgeon. However, the judge found that the plaintiff had not shown good cause to continue the trial, as the plaintiff's medical treatment was not imminent and the plaintiff had not explained why the consultation was not sought earlier. The judge also noted that the defendants were ready for trial and would be harmed by further delays. Therefore, the judge denied the motion and ordered the plaintiff to give notice.
