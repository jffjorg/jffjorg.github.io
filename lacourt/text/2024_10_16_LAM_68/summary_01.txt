And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of 24STCP02942, dismissing the motion to dismiss the petition filed by Respondents Ilona Klar, et al. The petition seeks to quash a deposition subpoena and prohibit further ex parte communication regarding Jerry Allyn Whittemore, a designated corporate representative of The Neslemur Company. The Respondents had moved to dismiss the petition, arguing that it was filed too late and that the petition lacks authority or admissible evidence for the requested relief.

The Judge found that the petition was timely filed, and that the Respondents had not made a sufficient showing to warrant dismissal. The Judge also found that the petition's claims for relief, including challenging the use of the witness affidavit, were valid and should be considered.

The Judge denied the motion to dismiss the petition, finding that the Respondents had not presented sufficient evidence to support their claims. The Judge also declined to address the Respondents' arguments regarding the propriety of making contact with the witness and the execution of the affidavit.

The case will proceed, with the Judge ordering that the parties give notice of the ruling.
