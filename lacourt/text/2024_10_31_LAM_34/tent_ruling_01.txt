Legal Standard
 
“If
parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties
outside of the presence of the court or orally before the court, for settlement
of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon motion, may enter judgment
pursuant to the terms of the settlement. If requested by the parties, the court
may retain jurisdiction over the parties to enforce the settlement until
performance in full of the terms of the settlement.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6,
subd. (a).) 
 
“Section
664.6 was enacted to provide a summary procedure for specifically enforcing a
settlement contract without the need for a new lawsuit.” (Weddington Prod.,
Inc. v. Flick (1998) 60 Cal.App.4th 793, 809.) In deciding motions made
under Section 664.6, judges “must determine whether the parties entered into a
valid and binding settlement.” (Kohn v. Jaymar-Ruby (1994) 23
Cal.App.4th 1530, 1533.) 
 
Discussion
 
            Plaintiff
moves the court to enter the stipulated judgment and enforce the settlement
agreement entered into by Plaintiff and Defendants David White, Veronica White
Jenkins, and Kimberly White. (Motion, at p. 5.) Plaintiff provided the court
with a copy of the Stipulation for Entry of Judgment and Settlement Agreement
signed by Plaintiff’s counsel, on behalf of Plaintiff, and Defendants David
White, Veronica White Jenkins, and Kimberly White. (MacNaughton Decl., ¶¶ 4-5,
Exh. 1-2.) 
 
Defendants
do not oppose Plaintiff’s motion.
 
The court
determines that the parties entered into a valid and binding settlement. The court
will enter judgment that will conform with the written settlement agreement and
the stipulated judgment.
 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiff
Alan K. White’s Motion to Enforce Settlement is GRANTED.
