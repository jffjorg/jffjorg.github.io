The court orders the defendant, FCA US LLC, to produce certain documents, including the "Warranty Policy and Procedure Manual", Recall Notices and Technical Service Bulletins, policies and procedures used to evaluate customer requests for repurchase, and other documents. The court denies the request for further production of other documents. The defendant must provide supplemental responses within 45 days and production shall be subject to a protective order. The court does not award sanctions as it finds that both sides acted with substantial justification.
