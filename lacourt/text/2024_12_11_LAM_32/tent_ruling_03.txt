[TENTATIVE] order RE:
petition to compel arbitration and for
  appointment of neutral arbitrator in u.m. arbitration




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On October 25, 2024, petitioner Kyairah
Young (“Petitioner”) petitioned the Court for an order to compel respondent
Blue Hill Specialty Insurance Company (“Respondent”) to participate in
arbitration, and for appointment of a neutral presiding arbitrator.
            Petitioner alleges that on August
25, 2023, an underinsured motorist struck an Uber that Petitioner had hired. (10-25-24
Pet., ¶ 2.) On February 8, 2024, Petitioner served Respondent with a Demand for
Arbitration. (Id., ¶ 4.) According to the October 25, 2024 petition,
“[t]here is now a dispute between the instant parties, specifically in that the
parties are unable to agree on if [sic] Petitioner served BLUE HILL
SPECIALTY INSURANCE COMPANY.” (Id., ¶ 3.)
            On November 15, 2024, Petitioner
filed a petition identically captioned a “Petition to Compel Arbitration and
for Appointment of a Neutral Arbitrator in U.M. Arbitration”, reserving a
hearing for this date. The November 15, 2024 is substantially identical to the
October 25, 2024 petition, except that it also alleges Petitioner has attempted
to meet and confer regarding arbitration and Respondent has refused. (11-15-24
Pet., ¶ 6.) The November 15, 2024 petition also newly requests that the Court
order arbitration be completed within ninety (90) days. (Id., 3:15.)
On November 6, 2024 – nine days before
filing of her second petition – Petitioner filed a proof of service indicating
she effected personal service of a “Petition to Compel Arbitration and for
Appointment of a Neutral Arbitrator in U.M. Arbitration” on Respondent on
November 4, 2024. (See 11-06-2024 POS.)
            Neither petition is accompanied by
any supporting declaration, and neither is verified.
            Respondent filed no opposition, and
Petitioner no reply.
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
Under California law, every uninsured
motorist insurance policy or endorsement “shall provide that the determination
as to whether the insured shall be legally entitled to recover damages, and if
so entitled, the amount thereof, shall be made by agreement between the insured
and the insurer or, in the event of disagreement, by arbitration.” (Ins. Code,
¶ 11580.2(f).)
A proceeding to compel arbitration is in
essence a suit in equity to compel specific performance of a contract. (Freeman
v. State Farm Mutual Auto Insurance Co. (1975) 14 Cal.3d 473, 479.) “On
petition of a party to an arbitration agreement alleging the existence of a
written agreement to arbitrate a controversy and that a party to the
agreement refuses to arbitrate that controversy, the court shall
order the petitioner and the respondent to arbitrate the controversy if it
determines that an agreement to arbitrate the controversy exists, unless it
determines that: (a) The right to compel arbitration has been waived by the
petitioner; or (b) Grounds exist for rescission of the agreement.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1281.2.)
 
DISCUSSION
            The
hearing on the petition is denied without prejudice for two reasons.
First: Petitioner’s Proof
of Service refers to the documents she served by their captions. Because of
Petitioner’s identical captioning of her two filings, it is unclear whether
Petitioner served her October or November petition on Respondent. No separate
proof of service is attached to the November 15, 2024 filing, which is the one
associated with this hearing. The Court
will not proceed in the absence of an opposition where service has not been
established, particularly because the latter petition requests certain relief
not requested in the former.
            Second,
there are no facts before the Court that entitle Petitioner to the relief she
seeks. She has not filed any supporting declaration satisfying Code of Civil
Procedure section 1281.2, governing petitions to compel arbitration, or
Insurance Code section 11580.2(f), governing uninsured motorist arbitration.
Section 11580.2(f), in particular, contains an express requirement that
Petitioner submit a declaration under penalty of perjury regarding workers’
compensation benefits.
            
CONCLUSION
Petition to compel arbitration is DENIED
without prejudice.
