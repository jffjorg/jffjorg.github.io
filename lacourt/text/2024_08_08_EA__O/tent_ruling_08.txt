[1] A Judicial Council
form was used for the complaint and the substantive allegations are no more
than a couple of conclusory sentences.  


[2] The
opposition is slightly unclear as to its arguments as it does not go through
each entry (e.g., Burns, Brown, and instant motion), but appears to largely
focus on the work spent on the anti-slapp motion. With that, the court will
take the general/overarching arguments raised by Plaintiff.  
 


[3] See
8/15/23 Final Ruling, p. 1, fn. 1 [“A Judicial Council form was used for the
complaint and the substantive allegations are no more than a couple of
conclusory sentences.”].)  
 


[4] To the
extent in reply Defendant argues that fees incurred for multiple counsel are
recoverable even if there is some duplication of work, the cases she cites to
do not support that position because in both Balsam v Trancos, Inc.
(2012) 203 Cal. App. 4th 1083 and California DUI Lawyers Ass’n v California
DMV (2022) 77 Cal. App. 5th 517, timesheets were submitted whereas here, no
such timesheets have been provided. What is more, the latter case involved
unique factual issues that required additional briefing; here, arguably, the
complaint was lack that it could have been disposed of on possibly a demurrer.
In any event, attorney fees rest in the sound discretion of the trial judge. (Reply
p. 2, citing Syers Properties III, Inc. v. Rankin (2014) 226 Cal. App.
4th 691, 698.) 
 


[5] He has 5 years of litigation
experience. 
 


[6] In
opposition, Plaintiff argues that work on defenses cannot be considered. (Opp.
p. 4:10-11.) As noted in Reply, Plaintiff does not cite to legal authority to
support this argument. 


[7] It
appears Plaintiff argues 6.5 hours plus .4 hours is reasonable in connection
with this motion. (See Opp. p. 5.)
