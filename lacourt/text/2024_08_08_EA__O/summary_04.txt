And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge is considering a motion filed by Wendy (Plaintiff) in case 22PSCV00580. The court notes that Wendy's allegation that Bo (Defendant) failed to pay 50% of the purchase price is contradicted by the Operating Agreement. The court also finds that Bo's argument that the tax privilege cannot be asserted in this case is based on a mistaken understanding of the precedent set by Schanbel v. Sup. Ct. (1993) 5 Cal.4th 704. The court does not find that case applicable to this situation because the public policy at play in Schanbel (favorability of full disclosure in a dissolution proceeding) is not present in this case.
