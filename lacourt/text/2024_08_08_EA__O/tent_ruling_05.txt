Defendant
Laurie M. Leer SPECIAL MOTION TO STRIKE PLAINTIFF’S COMPLAINT PURSUANT TO

PURSUANT TO C.C.P. §425.16(c)(1) is GRANTED, but in the reduced
amount of $11,135.00.
 
Background
 
This is a defamation case. Plaintiff
Dr. ANIL GUPTA
(“Plaintiff”) alleges the following against Defendant Laurie M. Leer
(“Defendant”): On February 10, 2023, Defendant made false statements to others
that Plaintiff “keeps his medical license for insurance fraud,” which was
intended to hurt Plaintiff’s reputation. (Complaint p. 4 of 4 of PDF.)[1]
Plaintiff claims he has been damaged in an amount of $500,000.
 
On March 29, 2023, Plaintiff filed suit.
 
On June 9, 2023, Defendant filed her anti-slapp motion. 
 
On August 15, 2023, the court issued its final ruling granting the
motion.
 
On June 10, 2024, Defendant filed the instant motion.
 
On July 12, 2024, the appeal was dismissed. 
 
On July 26, 2024, Plaintiff filed the opposition.
 
On August 1, 2024, Defendant filed her reply. 
 
Legal Standard
This Motion is made on the grounds that Defendant is the
“prevailing defendant” under Civ. Proc. Code, supra, § 425.16, which mandates
that the court shall award reasonable attorneys to the
prevailing defendant on a special motion to strike. (Civ. Proc. Code § 425.16,
subd. (c)(1) [emphasis added].)
Discussion
Here, as the appellate court dismissed Plaintiff’s appeal
on 4/16/24 due to Plaintiff’s failure to cure its default, Defendant, per the
court’s 8/15/23 order, is entitled to attorney fees, which Plaintiff does not
dispute. Instead, Plaintiff argues that the fees are unreasonable. Defendant
seeks an award of $31,625 in attorney fees (and $539.25 in costs). According to
Defense Counsel Burns’ declaration, his firm spent a total of 45.7 hours on the
matter. For reasons to be discussed below, the court agrees with Plaintiff that
the hours expended on the matter and hourly rate are unreasonable. 
The court will address each category of billing in the
order presented in Counsel Burns’ declaration. 
 
a. 7.5 hours spent by Counsel Burns
re: Anti-SLAPP motion[2]
Counsel Burns, who has 25 years of experience, states
that he spent approximately 4.8 hours in connection with reviewing the
Complaint and drafting/revising the Anti-SLAPP Motion and 2.7 hours in
connection with review of the Opposition, Plaintiff’s objections and
drafting/revising the Reply and Defendant’s Objections. Based on his hourly
rate of $625/hour, Defendant was billed approximately $4,687.50 for Burns’
services. 
Here, as underscored in the court’s ruling,[3]
the complaint was a four-page form complaint with nine lines of
material allegations. Reading (and re-reading) the complaint would
reasonably take no more than half an hour. To the extent that Counsel
Burns maintains it took longer, even if detailed time records are not necessary
(Reply p. 2), no verified time records are submitted that would be entitled
to a presumption of credibility. (Horsford v. Board of Trustees of
California State University (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 359, 395.) As for
Counsel Burns’ work in drafting the motion and papers, the
research and writing largely seems to be conducted by Counsel Brown, infra.
(Ibid [while a trial court abuses its discretion in “rejecting wholesale
counsels’ verified time records,” it may deny compensation for “inefficient or
duplicative” work. (Id. at pp. 394-395, quoting Ketchum v. Moses
(2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1130, 1132.)[4]
That would leave revising any of the drafted material, which
would—for a 15-page substantive motion and 6-page reply—reasonably take no more
than 2 hours. 
Therefore, the court determines that Counsel Burns reasonably expended
2.5 hours on the matter. 
As for the hourly rate, Burns
has not set forth evidence that his hourly rate is the prevailing rate
in this community. (See Graciano v. Robinson Ford Sales, Inc.
(2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 140, 155 [explaining the reasonable hourly rate is that
prevailing in the community for similar work]; Altavion, Inc. v. Konica
Minolta Sys. Lab., Inc. (2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 26, 71 [“The relevant
‘community’ is that where the court is located.”].) Accordingly, the court
reduces the amount $425/hour. (See also Opp. p. 5 [seeking imposition of $425
rate].) And if there is evidence of the prevailing rates in this community, it
is presented by Plaintiff’s Counsel who has been practicing for 10 years but
charges $375/hour. (See Opp. p. 5:8-10.) 
Thus, the court
awards 2.5 hours/$425/hour for a total of $1,062.50 for counsel Burns in
association with the anti-slapp motion. 
b. 37.50 hours for Counsel Brown[5]
This included: (1) approximately 10.3 hours in
connection with reviewing the Complaint, conducting necessary legal research
relating to the applicability of the Anti-SLAPP statute and litigation
privileges to Plaintiff’s claims for defamation, and also researching potential
merits defenses[6]
as well as research regarding the applicability of the Anti SLAPP statute and
its relation to Medi-Cal laws, as well as the applicability of formal
grievances made towards medical providers on whether such grievances fall
within the ambit of protected activity of section 425.16, subdivision (e), and
communicating with our client in the investigation and gathering of applicable
evidence for her declaration; (2) approximately 13 hours in connection
with drafting the Anti-SLAPP Motion and supporting declarations; (3)
approximately 8.2 total hours in reviewing Plaintiff’s Opposition and
Plaintiff’s Objections and preparing the Reply and Defendant’s Objections (4)
approximately 6.0 hours in preparing for and attending the hearing on the
Anti-SLAPP Motion. Based on his hourly rate of $425/hour, Leer was billed
approximately $15,937.50 in connection with Mr. Brown’s services for the
Anti-SLAPP Motion.
In opposition, Plaintiff contends that it is unreasonable
for a seasoned to take 7.5 hours in drafting the motion, but that 6.5 hours to
prepare and write the motion and the reply is 6.5 hours is reasonable. The
court agrees, namely as the motion and reply did not provide a robust analysis
as to whether Defendant’s conduct pertained to the public interest. (See e.g.,
Final Ruling, fn. 8.) Therefore,
the court awards 10.3 hours (research) + 6.5 hours (drafting motion, reviewing
opposition, and drafting reply) for a total of 16.8 hours at $425/hour for a
total of $7,140.00. 
(For clarity, as to the anti-slapp motion, the court
awards $8,202.50.) 
c. $11,000 for the instant motion
 
Lastly,
Defense Counsel seeks $11,000 in connection with the motion for attorney fees
(20 hours (8 by Burns and 12 by Brown) in drafting motion, any necessary reply
and preparing for and attending the hearing on this motion. 
 
Here, as the
motion is largely a recitation of case law, the court determines a total of 6.9
hours is reasonable. [7]
Therefore, the court
awards $2,932.50 in connection with the motion for attorney fees (6.9 hours x
$425/hour). 
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the
foregoing, the court grants the motion, but in the reduced amount of
$11,135.00.
