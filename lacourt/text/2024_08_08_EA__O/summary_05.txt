Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the defendant's motion to strike the plaintiff's complaint and recover attorney fees. The plaintiff, Dr. Anil Gupta, alleges that the defendant, Laurie M. Leer, made false statements about him, damaging his reputation. The defendant seeks to strike the complaint and recover attorney fees of $31,625.

The court grants the motion, but reduces the attorney fee award to $11,135.00. The court finds that the hours expended by the defendant's counsel, Burns and Brown, are unreasonable and reduces the award accordingly. The court also awards fees for the instant motion, but reduces the award to $2,932.50.

The court concludes that the defendant is entitled to attorney fees, but the amount is reduced due to the unreasonable hours expended by the defendant's counsel.
