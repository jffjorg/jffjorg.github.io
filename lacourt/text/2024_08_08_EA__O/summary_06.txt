And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge reviewing a case involving a complaint filed using a Judicial Council form and an opposition filed by the defendant. The complaint contains conclusory sentences, and the opposition is unclear as to its arguments. The judge notes that the defendant has argued that fees incurred for multiple counsel are recoverable, but cites cases that do not support this position. The judge also notes that the plaintiff has argued that work on defenses cannot be considered, but does not cite legal authority to support this argument. The judge is considering the hours worked on the anti-SLAPP motion (6.5 + 0.4 hours) and the attorney fees claimed. The judge has discretion to determine attorney fees and will review the case further before making a final ruling.
