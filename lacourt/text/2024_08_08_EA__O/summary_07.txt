Summary in English:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the Plaintiff's motion for leave to file a second amended complaint (SAC) to add causes of action and join additional parties, including International Church of the Foursquare Gospel (ICFG) as a defendant and The Foothills of Gilroy Financial Supporters, LLC as a plaintiff. The Plaintiff's original complaint alleged that ICFG changed the ownership of their accounts with the Defendant, Christian Community Credit Union, and that the Defendant has refused to restore the Plaintiff's authorized signors to their accounts. The Judge has ruled that ICFG is a necessary and indispensable party to the matter, as the dispute over ownership of the accounts cannot be resolved without including all parties claiming an ownership interest. The Judge has also noted that the Plaintiff's motion is granted in light of the strong policy in favor of liberal allowance of amendments. The case will proceed with the new parties and causes of action added.
