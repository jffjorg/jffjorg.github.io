[1] Wendy states that
she filed the motion in 22PSCV00580 because
it is the lead case. (Reply p. 2:6-9.)
 


[2] The court notes that
despite its 2/28/24 ruling sustaining Bo’s demurrer in that Plaintiff’s
allegation that Bo was to pay 50% of the purchase price is contradicted by the
Operating Agreement and that though Bo filed an answer to the FAC, Plaintiff,
perhaps inadvertently, maintains to assert that Bo has failed “to pay his
one-half of the Property's purchase price.” (FAC ¶¶8, 20.)  


[3] Bo further maintains
that the tax privilege cannot be asserted where a public policy greater than
that of confidentiality of tax returns is involved. (Opp. pp. 4-5, citing Schanbel
v. Sup. Ct. (1993) 5 Cal.4th 704.) But Schanbel is inapposite
because there the strong policy was favorability
of the full disclosure in a dissolution proceeding to ensure fair child
and spousal support awards and a fair division of community assets. Here, the
mere fact that Bo and Wendy were spouses and engaged in a joint venture does
not in and of itself provide for any public policy.
