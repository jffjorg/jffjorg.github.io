And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court is considering a dispute over the reasonableness of fees incurred by a defendant in response to a plaintiff's complaint. The plaintiff argues that the fees are reasonable, while the defendant disputes this, citing cases that do not support the defendant's position. The defendant also argues that work on defenses cannot be considered in determining the reasonableness of fees. The court notes that the complaint was filed using a Judicial Council form and that the substantive allegations are conclusory sentences. The court will take the general arguments raised by the plaintiff into consideration. The court will review the case and make a final ruling at a later date.
