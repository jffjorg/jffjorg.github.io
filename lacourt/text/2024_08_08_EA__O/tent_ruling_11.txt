Legal
Standard
 
The court may, in furtherance of justice and on any
proper terms, allow a party to amend any pleading. (Code Civ. Proc., §
473, subd. (a)(1); Branick v. Downey Savings & Loan
Association (2006) 39 Cal.4th 235, 242.) The court may also, in its
discretion and after notice to the adverse party, allow, upon any terms as may
be just, an amendment to any pleading or proceeding in other particulars; and
may upon like terms allow an answer to be made after the time limited by
this code. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (a); Branick, supra, 39
Cal.4th at 242.) The court may deny the plaintiff’s leave to amend if
there is prejudice to the opposing party, such as delay in trial, loss of
critical evidence, or added costs of preparation. (Id.)  
 
Under California Rules of Court, rule
3.1324, a motion to amend a pleading before trial must (1) include a copy of
the proposed amendment or amended pleading, which must be serially numbered to
differentiate it from previous pleadings or amendments; (2) state what
allegations in the previous pleading are proposed to be deleted, if any, and
where, by page, paragraph and line number, the deleted allegations are located;
and (3) state what allegations are proposed to be added to the previous
pleading, if any, and where, by page, paragraph, and line number, the
additional allegations are located. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1324(a).) A
separate supporting declaration specifying (1) the effect of the amendment; (2)
why the amendment is necessary and proper; (3) when the facts giving rise to the amended allegations
were discovered; and (4) the reason why the request for amendment was not made earlier must
accompany the motion. (Id., rule 3.1324(b).)
Discussion
 
The motion is made to allow Plaintiff to add a Wrongful
Termination and representative PAGA claim pursuant to Labor Code § 2699.3.
(Motion p. 2:1-3.) The wrongful termination comes as on January 16, 2024, after
filing of the instant action, Defendant terminated Plaintiff. (Krebs Decl.
¶6.) As for the PAGA
claim, it is unclear why Plaintiff is now seeking to assert
representative PAGA claims when the facts were known at the outset. (See
e.g., Complaint ¶60 [“Given the length of Plaintiff's- and other employees’
shifts, the unpaid work time often would have been owed at the overtime rate of
pay. These systematic failures to provide proper overtime compensation are in
violation of California law.”], emphasis added.) Notwithstanding, absent an
opposition, the court exercises its discretion to overlook said defects. 
 
Thus, abiding by the strong liberal policy in favor of
amendments (Motion pp. 4, 5 citing Howard v. County of San Diego (2010)
184 Cal.App.4th 1422, 1428; General Credit Corp. v. Pichel (1975) 44
Cal.App.3d 844, 850), the court grants the motion in furtherance of justice. 
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing, the motion is granted.
