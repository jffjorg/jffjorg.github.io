Plaintiff’s
Counsel Robert Norman’s Motion to be Relieved as Counsel is GRANTED, effective
upon [see below]. Plaintiff is to produce documents
to Gong within 10 days of this hearing; the failure to do so will result in
dismissal of his case. 
 
Background
 
This is a
defamation case. Plaintiff Honghua Shang (“Plaintiff”) alleges as follows:
Plaintiff is a licensed real estate broker. Plaintiff incorporated Echain in
2012 and Great Wall Realty, Inc. in 2017 and has operated both since the
aforesaid dates. Defendants Jing Jin (“Jin”), Benjamin Lee (“Lee”), Melvin Gong
(“Gong”), Alistair Mercado (“Mercado”), Wendy L. and Mandy Lau (“Lau”) posted
negative reviews/comments regarding Plaintiff, Echain and Great Wall on
Yelp, www.CCYP.com (i.e., a popular platform for business promotion
serving the Chinese business community and consumers), www.xiaohonshu.com (i.e., “another popular website
that caters to Chinese speaking people and the Chinese business community”),
Google Review and/or Facebook.
 
On March 5, 2021, Plaintiff filed a complaint, asserting a cause of
action against Jin, Lee, Gong, Mercado, Wendy L., Lau and Does 1-25 for:
 
1.     Defamation Per Se
 
On June 22,
2021, Gong filed his answer.
 
On August 3,
2021, Mercado filed his answer. 
 
On March 16, 2023, Plaintiff filed a substitution
of attorney indicating that she was replacing former counsel Jennifer Felten
and representing herself pro per. 
 
On December
6, 2023, Plaintiff filed a substitution of attorney indicating that counsel
Twietmeyer has been retained. 
 
On December
18, 2023, Jing Jin and Lee filed their answer. 
 
On March 8, 2024, Plaintiff’s Counsel Andrew W.
Twietmeyer filed a motion to be relieved as counsel.
 
On April 8,
2024, Defendant Melvin Gong filed a ‘Response To Plaintiff’s Counsel’s Motion
To Be Relieved As Counsel.’
 
On April 15,
2024, the court adopted its tentative ruling on Plaintiff’s Counsel Andrew
Twietmeye’s motion to be relieved as counsel, which was effective upon serving
this court’s order relieving Counsel sent to Plaintiff, Defendants, and all
other parties who have appeared in the case. 
 
On May 8,
2024, the court held an IDC and trial setting conference. There were no
appearances by Plaintiff.[1]
Based there on, the court stated the following: “Order to Show Cause Re:
Plaintiff's Failure to Appear on May 8, 2024, is scheduled for 06/07/2024 at
09:00 AM in Department O at Pomona Courthouse South. Order to Show Cause Re:
Why the Court should not Dismiss in its Entirety for Lack of Prosecution is
scheduled for 06/07/2024 at 09:00 AM in Department O at Pomona Courthouse
South. A Declaration in response to the Order to Show Cause is to be filed at
least five (5) Court Days prior the next hearing date.”
 
On June 4,
2024, Plaintiff filed a substitution of attorney naming Ronald E. Norman as the
attorney. That same day, Plaintiff filed his declaration re the OSC stating
that he had eye surgery on April 20, and as a result of complications, he was
unable to attend the May 8, 2024 hearing, but that he was actively seeking
legal representation. 
 
On June 7,
2024, the court discharged the OSCs. 
 
On July 5, 2024, Counsel Normal filed the instant
motion.
 
On August 2,
2024, Defendant Gong filed a ‘DECLARATION OF DAVID NEWMAN IN CONNECTION WITH
DEFENDANT MELVIN GONG’S REQUEST TO OBTAIN HEARING DATE FOR MOTION TO COMPEL
PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS’ indicating that he still not received the discovery. 
 
Discussion
 
Plaintiff’s
Counsel seeks to be relieved as counsel. The motion does not set forth a
particular reason aside from the fact that he can no longer effectively
represent Plaintiff. But the declaration does cite to CRPC Rules 1.6(a) and
(b).[2]

 
Notwithstanding, the court does not need
additional information from Counsel Norman as the procedural history of this
case strong suggests that an attorney, for whatever reason, cannot effectively
represent Plaintiff as this is the third substitution of attorney nor
can an attorney engender a discovery response, discovery that is in the possession
and control of the Plaintiff.
 
As noted in
the court 4/15/24 ruling, a party's failure to respond to discovery and to comply
with a judge's orders compelling discovery provides ample grounds for imposing
a terminating sanction. (Jerry’s Shell v. Equilon Enters., LLC (2005)
134 Cal.App.4th 1058; see also Doppes v. Bentley Motors, Inc. (2009) 174
Cal.App.4th 967; see also Del Junco v. Hufnagel (2007) 150 Cal.App.4th
789 [terminating sanctions warranted when it “became obvious” that party had no
intention of answering discovery, filing proper and timely papers, or complying
with judge's orders).].) Judges have inherent authority to dismiss a case as a
sanction against a plaintiff when, for example, the plaintiff’s conduct is
clear and deliberate such that it makes it impossible to continue with
litigation, and no lesser sanction would remedy the situation. (Crawford v.
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (2015) 242 Cal.App.4th 1265, 1271.) In making
such a determination, a judge should consider the plaintiff’s credibility. (See
Jerry’ Shell, supra, 134 Cal.App.4th at p. 1066, 1067 [judge dismissed
action for plaintiffs' repeated failure to comply with discovery orders;
plaintiffs' motion for relief under CCP § 473(b) was denied
because their attorney's supporting declaration described health crisis that
lacked credibility].) 
 
Here, the court orders Plaintiff to produce the documents within 10 days
of this hearing. The failure to do so will result in dismissal of Plaintiff’s
case. 
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the
foregoing, Counsel’s Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel is GRANTED, effective
upon serving this court’s order relieving Counsel sent to Plaintiff,
Defendants, and all other parties who have appeared in the case.
