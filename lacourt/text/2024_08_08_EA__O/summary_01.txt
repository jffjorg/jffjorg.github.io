```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted Plaintiff's Counsel Robert Norman's motion to be relieved as counsel, effective upon serving this court's order relieving Counsel sent to Plaintiff, Defendants, and all other parties who have appeared in the case. The court orders Plaintiff to produce documents to Defendant Gong within 10 days of this hearing. Failure to do so will result in the dismissal of Plaintiff's case. The court notes that this is the third substitution of attorney and that Plaintiff has failed to respond to discovery, which provides ample grounds for imposing a terminating sanction.
