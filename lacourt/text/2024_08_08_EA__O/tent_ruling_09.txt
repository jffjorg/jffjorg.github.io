 Case Number:  23PSCV02986    Hearing Date:   August 8, 2024    Dept:  O Tentative Ruling
 
PLAINTIFFS’
MOTION FOR LEAVE TO FILE A SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT TO ADD CAUSES OF ACTION AND
JOIN ADDITIONAL PARTY PLAINTIFF AND DEFENDANT is GRANTED. 
 
Background
 
This is a contracts case. GILROY FOURSQUARE CHURCH, d/b/a FOOTHILLS FOURSQUARE
CHURCH (“Gilroy Foursquare”), a California unincorporated association; and THE
FOOTHILLS CHURCH OF GILROY (“Successor”), a California nonprofit corporation,
as Successor in Interest (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) allege the following
against Defendant CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY CREDIT UNION (“Defendant” or “Credit
Union”): In October 2022, Gilroy Foursquare disaffiliated from International
Church of the Foursquare Gospel (“ICFG”). Thereafter, ICFG advised Gilroy
Foursquare that it would seize all of Gilroy Foursquare’s assets and property.
Plaintiffs believe, and therefore allege, the change to Plaintiffs’ Accounts
with the Defendant were made by ICFG. Plaintiffs have made demand on the Defendant
to remove the ICFG signors from Plaintiffs’ Accounts, but the Defendant has
refused to restore Plaintiffs’ authorized signors to Plaintiffs’ Accounts. 
 
On September 27, 2023, Plaintiffs filed suit for the
following causes of action (COAs): 1.     Breach Of Contract 2.     Breach Of Covenant Of Good Faith And
Fair Dealing 3.     Breach Of Fiduciary Duties 4.     Declaratory Judgment And 5.     Injunctive Relief
 
On March 26,
2024, the court issued its final ruling on Defendant’s demurrer and sustained
it with leave to amend so that Plaintiffs can properly plead a breach of
contract cause of action[1]
and granted the motion to seal. 
 
On April 24,
2024, Plaintiffs filed their first amended complaint (FAC), wherein they
withdrew their breach of fiduciary COA.
 
On June 24,
2024, the court granted Defendant Christian Community Credit Union's Ex Parte
Application to Extend Time to Respond to First Amended Complaint until July 15,
2024. According to the ex-parte application, “The settlement is, in part,
contingent on Credit Union not filing a demurer or motion to strike to the FAC
in order to allow Plaintiffs to obtain leave of the Court to file a Second
Amended Complaint in order to add a new party to this action and thereafter
dismiss Credit Union.” (6/21/24 Rubin Decl. ¶9, emphasis added.) 
 
On July 12,
2024, Plaintiffs filed the instant motion for leave to file a SAC.
 
On July 15,
2024, the parties appeared for the continued ex-parte hearing. The minute order
provides, in relevant part, the following: “Plaintiff's Counsel represent to
the Court that he has reserved a Hearing on Motion for Leave to Amend to File
Second Amended Complaint on August 8, 2024, at the Pomona South Courthouse in
Department O at 10:00 a.m. Further, Plaintiff's Counsel represents to the Court
that if the above indicated motion is granted (there will be no opposition) then
the parties will have reached a settlement agreement. Defendant Christian
Community Credit Union's Ex Parte Application to Extend Time to Respond to
First Amended Complaint is heard and GRANTED. Responsive Pleadings are not
required prior to August 8, 2024.” (emphasis added).
Legal Standard
The motion is brought
pursuant to CCP section 473 (Amendment to Pleadings) and 389 (Compulsory
Joinder). (Motion p. 2:23-24.)
CCP Section 473: The court may, in furtherance of
justice and on any proper terms, allow a party to amend any pleading. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (a)(1); Branick v. Downey Savings & Loan
Association (2006) 39 Cal.4th 235, 242.) The court may also, in its
discretion and after notice to the adverse party, allow, upon any terms as may
be just, an amendment to any pleading or proceeding in other particulars; and
may upon like terms allow an answer to be made after the time limited by this
code. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (a); Branick, supra, 39 Cal.4th at 242.)
The court may deny the plaintiff’s leave to amend if there is prejudice to the
opposing party, such as delay in trial, loss of critical evidence, or added
costs of preparation. (Id.)
Under California Rules of
Court, rule 3.1324, a motion to amend a pleading before trial must (1) include
a copy of the proposed amendment or amended pleading, which must be serially
numbered to differentiate it from previous pleadings or amendments; (2) state
what allegations in the previous pleading are proposed to be deleted, if any,
and where, by page, paragraph and line number, the deleted allegations are
located; and (3) state what allegations are proposed to be added to the
previous pleading, if any, and where, by page, paragraph, and line number, the
additional allegations are located. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1324(a).) A
separate supporting declaration specifying (1) the effect of the amendment; (2)
why the amendment is necessary and proper; (3) when the facts giving rise to
the amended allegations were discovered; and (4) the reason why the request for
amendment was not made earlier must accompany the motion. (Id., rule
3.1324(b).)[2]
CCP Section 389
Code of Civil Procedure
section 389 articulates when a nonparty must be joined to the action. A person
is a necessary and indispensable party where 1) complete relief cannot be
obtained in the nonparty’s absence, 2) the nonparty claims an interest relating
to the subject of the action and disposition of such will (i) impair or impede
the nonparty’s ability to protect its interest or (ii) leave existing parties
subject to substantial risk of incurring double, multiple, or otherwise
inconsistent obligations. (Code Civ. Proc., § 389, subd. (a); Olszewksi v.
Scripps Health (2003) 30 Cal.4th 798, 808-809; Morrical v. Rogers
(2013) 220 Cal.App.4th 438, 460.) Whether a party is a necessary and
indispensable party is at the discretion of the trial court and the court is to
weight the factors of practical realities and other considerations. (Morrical
v. Rogers, supra, 220 Cal.App.4th 438, 461.) Determination that a person is
a necessary party is a predicate for determination that person is an
indispensable party. (Dreamweaver Andalusians, LLC v. Prudential Ins. Co. of
America (2015) 234 Cal.App.4th 1168, 1173.) For compulsory joinder, the
basic rule is to join persons who are materially interested in the subject of
an action whenever feasible. (Bianka M. v. Superior Court (2018) 5
Cal.5th 1004, 1018; Countrywide Home Loans, Inc. v. Superior Court
(1999) 69 Cal.App.4th 785, 793.) 
Discussion
 
Plaintiffs’
Proposed SAC seeks to add ICFG as a defendant and The Foothills of Gilroy
Financial Supporters, LLC, a California limited liability company, as a
plaintiff. Additionally, Plaintiffs seeks to add the following COAs against
ICFG: Unjust Enrichment; Chose in Action; Breach of Fiduciary Duties; Constructive
Trust; and Request for Accounting added to the claim for Injunctive Relief. The purpose of the motion is to
join ICFG as an additional party defendant so that the ownership of the subject
Credit Union accounts may be determined and avoid multiple lawsuits and the
possibility of inconsistent judgments. (Motion p. 4:14-18.) The
amendment was not made earlier because Plaintiffs realized after conferring
with Defendant Credit Union that resolution could not occur without naming ICFG as a Defendant. 
 
For all the
reasons set forth in the motion, the court grants the motion. 
 
First, the court grants the motion abiding by the strong policy in favor
of liberal allowance of amendments. (Motion p. 5, citing Mesler v. Bragg
Management Co. (1985) 39 Cal.3d 290, 297; see also Motion p. 7 citing Hirsa
v. Superior Court (1981) 118 Cal.App.3d 486, 488- 489 [trial courts “are to
liberally permit such amendments, at any stage of the proceeding…rest[ing] on
the fundamental policy that ‘cases should be decided on their merits.’”],
internal citations omitted.)
 
Next, the
court grants the motion as ICFG is both a necessary and indispensable party to
this matter. (Motion p. 7.) Here, Plaintiffs have become aware that ICFG asserts that it is the
owner of Plaintiffs’ accounts. Accordingly, less than full participation
by all parties claiming ownership would not result in complete relief because complete relief would entail a
judicial determination of ownership that includes all parties claiming
an ownership interest to be before the court and present their competing claims.
(Motion p. 8:25-28.) Thus, denying leave to amend would prejudice all the
parties, not just Plaintiffs. (Motion p. 7:2-4.) 
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the
foregoing, the motion is granted.
