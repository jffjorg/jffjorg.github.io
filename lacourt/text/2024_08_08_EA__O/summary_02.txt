And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is unclear why Defense Counsel Newman's declaration states that the court instructed the plaintiff to produce documents, given that the plaintiff did not appear at the May 2024 IDC. The judge notes that the rules prohibit lawyers from revealing information protected from disclosure without the client's informed consent, unless the disclosure is necessary to prevent a criminal act that may result in harm to an individual. The judge is considering these facts and the rules as they pertain to the upcoming court hearing.
