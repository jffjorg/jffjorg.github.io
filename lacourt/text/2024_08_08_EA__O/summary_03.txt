Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of 22PSCV00580, regarding a motion by Plaintiff Wendy Lin to quash deposition subpoenas served by Defendant Bo Sun. The Court has agreed to continue the motion pending supplemental briefing by both parties. The subpoenas seek private financial information, including tax returns, bank statements, and other financial records, from various entities. The Court has found that Bo has failed to meet his burden of showing that the financial information is directly relevant to the case and cannot be obtained through less intrusive means. The Court has also noted that the right to privacy is generally limited to natural persons, but is developing in the direction that the strength of the privacy right being asserted by a non-human entity depends on the circumstances. The Court has ordered supplemental briefing to explain in detail the relevancy of the financial documents and why all sources of financial information are needed.
