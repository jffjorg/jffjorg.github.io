Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion of the defendants, Arthur Minassian and Madelene Minassian, to set aside their defaults. The defaults were entered on April 17, 2023, and October 19, 2023, respectively. The court has found that the defendants did not have actual notice of the action, as they failed to provide sufficient evidence to show that they lacked knowledge of the lawsuit. The court has also found that the service of process was defective, as the process server failed to leave copies of the summons and complaint with a person apparently in charge of the usual mailing address. As a result, the court has ordered the defendants to file their proposed answer within 20 days. The court has also overruled the objections to the evidence presented by the parties.
