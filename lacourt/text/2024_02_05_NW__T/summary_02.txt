And here is the English text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a case between Sharon Lodin, the plaintiff, and Peter Brugetti, the defendant, along with Tarzana Health Systems, LLC, who are also defendants. The case concerns a dog bite incident that occurred on a public sidewalk, and the plaintiff is seeking damages for negligence, premise liability, and business proprietor's liability. The defendants demurred to the plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint, arguing that the pleading defects in the complaint were insufficient to support the plaintiff's claims. The Judge has ruled that the demurrer is sustained without leave to amend, meaning that the plaintiff's complaint is insufficient and needs to be rewritten. The Judge's ruling is based on two pleading defects: the insufficiency of facts to plead duty and knowledge of the danger, and the failure to provide supportive facts to show that the dogs had a dangerous propensity and the defendants had knowledge of the same. The Judge has cited several California cases in support of their ruling, including Yuzon v. Collins and Melton v. Boustred.
