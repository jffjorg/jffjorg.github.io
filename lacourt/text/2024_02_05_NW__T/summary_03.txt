And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by the defendants, Hyundai Motor America and Van Nuys-H, Inc. dba Keyes Hyundai of Van Nuys. The demurrer challenged the plaintiff's complaint, which alleged various causes of action related to a defective vehicle purchased by the plaintiff.

The court has overruled the demurrer to the eighth cause of action, which alleges breach of contract. The court found that the plaintiff had sufficiently pled facts to show the legal effect of the contract terms and the plaintiff's performance.

The court has sustained the demurrer to the second cause of action, which alleges negligent misrepresentation, but with 20 days' leave to amend. The court found that the plaintiff had sufficiently pled the misrepresentation, but lacked specific facts regarding where and by what means the representation was made.

The court has sustained the demurrer to the fourth, fifth, tenth, twelfth, and thirteenth causes of action, which alleged strict liability, production liability, breach of implied warranty of fitness, breach of implied duty to perform with reasonable care, and negligence, without leave to amend. The court found that these causes of action were barred by the economic loss rule, as the plaintiff had not alleged or provided any facts to show that there was damage to "other property" or that a special relationship existed between the parties.

The court has ordered the plaintiff to file an amended complaint within 20 days to address the pleading defects identified in the second cause of action.
