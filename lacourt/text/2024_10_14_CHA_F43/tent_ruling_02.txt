SUMMARY OF
ACTION
This action
arises from Plaintiff James Conrad Gambina’s (Plaintiff) purchase of an
allegedly defective 2022 Honda Accord. On January 23, 2024, Plaintiff filed a
Complaint against Defendant American Honda Motor Company, Inc. (Defendant) for
violations of the Song-Beverly Act.
 
Plaintiff
propounded Requests for Production on Defendant on March 13, 2024. On May 30,
2024, Defendant served its responses to Plaintiff’s discovery requests. Plaintiff
argues that Defendant’s responses contained meritless objections, and he filed
this motion compel, seeking further responses to RFP Nos. 1-3, 7, 9, 15, 16,
19, 20, 27, 28, 29, 30, 37, 38, 41, 42, 45, 46, 51, 52, 55, 56, 69, 70, 71,72,
80, 81, 86, 88, 90, 109, 113, 114, 119, 120, 125, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135,
136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, and 145.
 
After Plaintiff
filed this motion on July 24, 2024, Defendant, having become aware of this
Court’s Lemon Law discovery order, attempted to communicate with Plaintiff
regarding the proper responsive documents in Lemon Law cases. There was no
mention in Plaintiff’s motion of any attempt to comply with the Court’s Lemon
Law discovery order. After Plaintiff’s counsel told Defendant that she would
check with her office regarding the discovery order, Defendant’s three attempts
to follow up with Plaintiff in September were unsuccessful. Defendant claims
that it served additional documents on October 1, 2024, that are in compliance
with this Court’s Lemon Law discovery order. As of October 8, no reply has been
filed by Plaintiff.
 
It does not
appear that the parties were able to successfully meet and confer regarding the
Court’s Lemon Law discovery order. 
 
Accordingly, the
Court has reviewed the documents related to this motion and will not decide the
motion on the merits at this time. The Court orders the parties to meet and
confer directly, not by email or letter. Additionally, the parties are ordered
to file a joint statement of remaining issues by a date to be set by the Court.
The joint statement should briefly describe the matters in dispute, followed by
Plaintiffs’ arguments, then Defendant’s arguments.  
 
Prior to
meeting and conferring, the parties should refer to the Court’s discovery order
for lemon law cases for this motion and any future discovery motions in this
case. There is a section in that order for the production of documents. The
Court’s discovery order is posted online, along with this Department’s
courtroom information and Final Status Conference Order, all of which the
parties are ordered to review. 
 
ORDER  
1. The parties
are ordered to conduct a meet and confer based on the Court’s Lemon Law
discovery order. 
 
2. The parties
shall submit a joint statement of the remaining issues as described above. The
format should be as follows: the parties should recite the specific discovery
request at issue, followed by the moving party’s statement of why it should be
compelled, followed by the opposing party’s statement of why it should not be
compelled. To the extent that an argument is repeated for a subsequent request,
the party shall simply refer to the section where the argument was previously
made. 
 
3. The dates
for the status report and continued hearings will be set at the hearing on this
motion. 
 
4. Moving party
to provide notice.
