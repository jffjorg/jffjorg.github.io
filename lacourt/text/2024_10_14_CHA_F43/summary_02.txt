And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving a plaintiff who purchased a defective 2022 Honda Accord and is seeking further responses to certain requests for production from the defendant, American Honda Motor Company, Inc. The plaintiff argues that the defendant's responses to the discovery requests contained meritless objections and is seeking further responses. The judge has ordered the parties to meet and confer directly to resolve the dispute, rather than through email or letter. The parties are also ordered to file a joint statement of the remaining issues, which should briefly describe the matters in dispute, followed by the plaintiff's arguments and then the defendant's arguments. The judge has also ordered the parties to refer to the Court's discovery order for lemon law cases for guidance on production of documents.
