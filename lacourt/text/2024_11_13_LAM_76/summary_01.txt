The plaintiff has moved for terminating, issue, evidentiary, monetary sanctions, and jury instructions against the defendant. The judge has denied the plaintiff's request for terminating sanctions, finding that the defendant did not willfully and intentionally destroy the personnel file of the perpetrator. However, the judge has imposed a lesser evidentiary sanction, prohibiting the defendant from challenging the authenticity of documents discovered by the plaintiff at the UCLA library. The judge has also granted the plaintiff's request for a jury instruction, allowing the jury to draw inferences from the destruction of the personnel file. Finally, the judge has denied the plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions, finding that the plaintiff failed to identify the persons and/or attorneys against whom the sanction would be sought and did not identify the amount.
