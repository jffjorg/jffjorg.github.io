And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the plaintiff, Gabriel Espinoza, and granted his motion to approve the entry of the consent judgment agreed upon by him and defendant Adir International, LLC. The consent judgment requires the defendant to provide a clear and reasonable exposure warning on its products that contain BPA, a chemical known to cause harm to human health. The judge found that the warning requirement is satisfied, and that the amount of attorney's fees incurred by the plaintiff is reasonable. The judge also approved the civil penalty of $4,000, which will be paid to the State of California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment and the plaintiff. The judge's ruling is based on the criteria set forth in Health and Safety Code § 25249.7(b)(2), which requires the court to consider the nature and extent of the violation, the number and severity of the violations, the economic effect of the penalty on the violator, and other factors that may be relevant.
