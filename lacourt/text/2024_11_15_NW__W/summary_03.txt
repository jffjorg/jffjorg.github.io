And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted Defendant Kendra Thomas' motion to quash service of summons and complaint. The court finds that the Plaintiff, Lily Shia, did not properly serve the Defendant with the summons and complaint. The Plaintiff attempted to serve the Defendant at the Defendant's previous place of business, but it was no longer valid. The Plaintiff then mailed the summons and complaint to the wrong address and attempted to serve the Defendant at the Chatsworth Courthouse, but there is no evidence that the summons or complaint was served. The court notes that even if the Defendant had actual knowledge of the lawsuit, proper service of process is still required. The court finds that the Plaintiff did not comply with the statutory procedures for service of process and therefore, the service was not proper.
