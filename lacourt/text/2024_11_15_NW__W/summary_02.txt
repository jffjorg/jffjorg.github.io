Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Defendant, Blue Cross of California dba Anthem Blue Cross, has moved the court for an order compelling Children's Hospital of Los Angeles (CHLA) to fully comply with four business records subpoenas. The subpoenas seek various documents, including communications between CHLA and the Defendant regarding the Plaintiff, as well as medical records. The Defendant argues that CHLA has only produced medical records responsive to one of the subpoenas and that CHLA's efforts to comply with the subpoenas are insufficient.

The Judge finds that CHLA's efforts to search for the requested information appear diligent and complete at this stage, and that if the information exists, it may be in the possession of the actual doctors involved in the Plaintiff's care or other custodians. The Judge notes that the Defendant has obtained the required responses through the meet and confer process and is willing to compromise on the records received. Therefore, the Judge's tentative ruling is that CHLA's efforts to comply with the subpoenas appear sufficient, and the Defendant's motion to compel compliance is denied.
