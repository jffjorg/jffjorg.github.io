RELIEF
REQUESTED 
 
             Compel Defendant FCA US LLC to
provide code-compliant responses to Plaintiff Martha Gonzalez Chaidez’s First
Set of Requests for Production, Nos. 45-46, and First Set of Special
Interrogatories, Nos. 45-48. 
 
            In addition, impose
total sanctions of $5,240 ($2,620 per motion) against the defendant and its
counsel of record, Ongaro P.C. 
 
BACKGROUND
 
             This is a lemon law action. Plaintiff Martha
Gonzalez Chaidez aka Martha Gonzalez (“Plaintiff”) alleges that she entered
into a warranty contract with Defendant FCA US LLC (“FCA”) for a vehicle (a
2020 RAM 1500). After defects and nonconformities manifested in the vehicle
during the warranty period, Plaintiff delivered the vehicle to an authorized
FCA repair facility for repair. However, FCA was unable to conform the vehicle
to the applicable warranties. 
FCA breached
its obligations under the Song-Beverly Act by failing to remedy the defects and
nonconformities or give restitution. 
 
            On April 9, 2024, Plaintiff filed
the instant motions to compel FCA’s further responses to Plaintiff’s First Set of Requests for Production (“RPD”)
and Special Interrogatories (“SROG”).
 
            On June 25, 2024, FCA filed its
opposition to the RPD motion.
 
            On June 26, 2024, FCA filed its
opposition to the SROG motion. 
 
            On July 2, 2024, Plaintiff filed her
reply to both oppositions. 
            
            A jury trial is set for September
10, 2024.
             
TENTATIVE RULING
 
Plaintiff’s motions to compel
further responses are GRANTED. Defendant FCA US LLC is ordered to serve
verified, further responses to Plaintiff Martha Gonzalez Chaidez’s First Set of Requests for Production, Nos.
45-46, and First Set of Special Interrogatories, Nos. 45-48, within 30 days of
this ruling. The defendant is further ordered to pay the plaintiff total
sanctions of $2,840. 
 
LEGAL STANDARD
 
“On receipt of a response to interrogatories, the propounding party may
move for an order compelling a further response if the propounding party deems
that any of the following apply: ¶ (1) An answer to a particular interrogatory
is evasive or incomplete. ¶ (2) An exercise of the option to produce documents
under Section 2030.230 is unwarranted or the required specification of those
documents is inadequate. ¶ (3) An objection to an interrogatory is without
merit or too general.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (a).) 
 
Similarly, “[o]n receipt of a response to a demand for inspection,
copying, testing, or sampling, the demanding party may move for an order
compelling further response to the demand if the demanding party deems that any
of the following apply: ¶ (1) A statement of compliance with the demand is
incomplete. ¶ (2) A representation of inability to comply is inadequate,
incomplete, or evasive. ¶ (3) An objection in the response is without merit or
too general.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (a).)  
 
“Except as provided in subdivision (j) [which concerns electronically
stored information] the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel further response to a
demand, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (h).) 
 
 
 
DISCUSSION
 
A.    Timeliness
 
Motions to compel further response to interrogatories and requests for
production must be brought within 45 days of service of the verified response,
supplemental verified response, or on a date to which the propounding and
responding parties have agreed to in writing; otherwise, the propounding party
waives the right to compel further responses. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300,
subd. (c); 2031.310, subd. (c); but see Golf & Tennis Pro Shop,
Inc. v. Superior Court (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 127, 134-136 [suggesting that
the 45-day deadline does not apply to objections-only responses].) 
“[T]he time within which to make a
motion to compel production of documents is mandatory and jurisdictional just
as it is for motions to compel further answers to interrogatories.” (Sexton
v. Superior Court (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410.) The 45-day deadline
“is ‘jurisdictional’ in the sense that it renders the court without authority
to rule on motions to compel other than to deny them.” (Ibid.) 
 
            The Court
finds the instant motions timely. According to Plaintiff’s counsel declaration,
FCA served its verifications to its responses on February 22, 2024.
(Declarations of Armando Lopez, filed April 9, 2024 (“Lopez Decl.”), ¶ 4; Exhibits
B – copies of the responses, Proof of Service pages [showing FCA served the
responses electronically].) 45 days from February 22, 2024, was Sunday, April
7, 2024. However, Code of Civil Procedure section 1010.6, subdivision (a)(3)(B)
extends by two court days “any right or duty to do any act or make any response
within any period or on a date certain after the service of the document … by
electronic means ….” Here, since service was made electronically, the deadline
was extended by two court days to Tuesday, April 9, 2024. Plaintiff filed the
motions on that date. Therefore, they are timely. 
 
B.    Meet and Confer
 
The instant motions to compel further responses must be accompanied by a
meet and confer declaration. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300, subd. (b)(1);
2031.310, subd. (b)(2).)
 
The Court finds that Plaintiff has satisfied the meet and confer
requirement for each motion. (Lopez Decl., ¶¶ 5-9.) FCA appears to argue in its oppositions that the
meet and confer process was insufficient. However, that is not grounds for
denying the motions. Accordingly, the Court will rule on the motions on their
merits. 
 
C.    Separate Statement 
 
The motions must be accompanied by a separate statement. (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1345(a)(2), (3).) “A separate statement is a separate document
filed and served with the discovery motion that provides all the information
necessary to understand each discovery request and all the responses to it that
are at issue. The separate statement must be full and complete so that no
person is required to review any other document in order to determine the full
request and the full response. Material must not be incorporated into the
separate statement by reference.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(c).)
 
Here, Plaintiff has satisfied the separate statement requirement of each
motion. 
 
D.    RPDs at Issue
 
Plaintiff moves to compel FCA’s further responses to RPDs No. 45-46.
Those RPDs asked FCA to produce the following, respectively. 
 
·      
All DOCUMENTS evidencing complaints by owners of the
2020 RAM 1500 vehicle regarding any of the complaints that the SUBJECT VEHICLE
was presented to YOUR or YOUR authorized repair facilities for repair during
the warranty period.
·      
All DOCUMENTS evidencing warranty repairs to 2020
RAM 1500 vehicles regarding any of the components that YOU or YOUR authorized
repair facilities performed repairs on under warranty.
 
“The party to whom a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling
has been directed shall respond separately to each item or category of item by
any of the following: ¶ (1) A statement
that the party will comply with the particular demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling by the date set for the inspection, copying, testing, or
sampling pursuant to paragraph (2) of subdivision (c) of Section 2031.030 and
any related activities. ¶ (2) A
representation that the party lacks the ability to comply with the demand for
inspection, copying, testing, or sampling of a particular item or category of
item. ¶ (3) An objection to the
particular demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2031.210, subd. (a).) 
 
Here, FCA objected to the RPDs,
arguing that the requests were vague, ambiguous, overly broad, sought
irrelevant information, and sought information protected by the attorney client
privilege and work product doctrine. (Separate Statement, pp. 1:6-18, 5:15-28.)
 
            In
its opposition to the RPD motion, FCA argues that the RPD motion is moot
because, on June 25, 2024, it served further supplemental responses to the
RPDs, with verifications to follow. (Opposition to RPD Motion, p. 1:14-18.) 
 
            However,
the request to compel FCA’s further responses to RPD Nos. 45-46 is not moot
because FCA failed to serve verifications. As Plaintiff argues in her reply,
“[u]nsworn responses are tantamount to no responses at all.” (Appleton v.
Superior Court (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 632, 636.)  
 
            Given
that FCA is not opposed to supplementing its initial response to RPD Nos.
45-46, the request to compel further responses to RPD Nos. 45-46 is GRANTED. 
 
E.    SROGs at Issue
 
Plaintiff also moves to compel FCA’s further responses to Plaintiff’s
SROG Nos. 45-48, which asked FCA the following, respectively. 
 
·      
At the time of release for the 2020 RAM 1500
vehicles, state your anticipated range for repairs per thousand vehicles sold
(R/1000).
·      
State the repairs per thousand vehicles sold
(R/1000) for 2020 RAM 1500 vehicles.
·      
Identify in order the five symptoms with the highest
repairs per thousand (R/1000) for 2020 RAM 1500 vehicles, and the corresponding
repairs per thousand.
·      
Identify in order the five components with the
highest repairs per thousand (R/1000) for 2020 RAM 1500 vehicles, and the
corresponding repairs per thousand.
 
“If an objection is made to an interrogatory or to a part of an
interrogatory, the specific ground for the objection shall be set forth clearly
in the response.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.240, subd. (b).)
 
Here, FCA objected to each of the SROGs above, arguing that they seek
irrelevant information, are overly broad, and are not limited to any claim,
defect, or nonconformity in this case. 
 
In opposition to the SROG motion, FCA argues that the request to compel
further responses to SROG Nos. 45-48 is moot because it served supplemental
responses and is working to obtain verifications for those responses. 
 
However, responses without verifications amount to no responses, as
stated above. 
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s request to compel FCA’s further responses to
SROG Nos. 45-48 is GRANTED. 
 
 
F.     Request for Sanctions 
 
Plaintiff seeks total sanctions
of $5,240 ($2,620 per motion) against the defendant and its counsel of record,
Ongaro P.C. 
 
The requested amount of $2,620
consists of 2.4 hours Plaintiff’s counsel spent on the moving papers, 2 hours
counsel anticipated spending reviewing the opposition and drafting a reply, 2
hours counsel anticipates spending preparing for and attending the hearing, a
total of 6.4 hours at counsel’s billing rate of $400 per hour ($,2,560), plus a
$60 filing fee. (Lopez Decl., ¶¶ 9-10.)
 
Under the relevant statutes, a court shall impose monetary sanctions against
any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to
compel further response to a demand or interrogatories, unless it finds that
the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that
other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust. (Code Civ.
Proc., §§ 2031.310, subd. (h); 2030.300, subd. (d).)
 
            Here, FCA argues that sanctions are
not warranted because Plaintiff prematurely abandoned the meet and confer
efforts, did not have legitimate grounds for bringing the motion, the defendant
substantially complied with the discovery requests, and even though the
defendant’s objections were valid, it willingly supplemented its responses. 
 
            However, FCA did not serve
verifications. In addition, Plaintiff did not prematurely abandon the meet and
confer process if she only had 45 days under the relevant statute to bring the
motion or lose that right. Although FCA states it would have extended the
motion to compel deadline, Plaintiff was not required to agree to an extension.
Finally, FCA’s responses to the RPDs were not code-compliant. According to the
relevant statute, “If the responding party objects to the demand for
inspection, copying, testing, or sampling of an item or category of item, the
response shall do both of the following: (1) Identify with particularity any
document, tangible thing, land, or electronically stored information falling
within any category of item in the demand to which an objection is being made. (2)
Set forth clearly the extent of, and the specific ground for, the objection. If
an objection is based on a claim of privilege, the particular privilege invoked
shall be stated. If an objection is based on a claim that the information
sought is protected work product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section
2018.010), that claim shall be expressly asserted.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.240,
subd. (b).) Here, FCA did not comply with subdivision (a) of that statute. 
 
            Therefore, the Court finds the
imposition of sanctions proper. 
 
However, the Court finds the requested sanctions of $2,620 per motion
excessive because some papers were nearly identical to each other
(specifically, the declarations filed in support of the moving papers,
opposition papers, and reply papers), making it unlikely that Plaintiff’s
counsel spent the same amount of time on each motion. It is also unlikely that
Plaintiff’s counsel will spend 4 hours at the hearing (i.e., 2 hours per
motion). 
 
Accordingly, the Court will only impose sanctions of $1,420 (i.e., 3.4
hours at counsel’s billing rate of $400 per hour, plus a $60 filing fee)
against FCA per motion (total of $2,840).
 
CONCLUSION
 
Plaintiff’s motions to compel
further responses are GRANTED. Defendant FCA US LLC is ordered to serve
verified, further responses to Plaintiff Martha Gonzalez Chaidez’s First Set of Requests for Production, Nos.
45-46, and First Set of Special Interrogatories, Nos. 45-48, within 30 days of
this ruling. The defendant is further ordered to pay the plaintiff total
sanctions of $2,840 within 30 days.
 
Moving party to give notice.
