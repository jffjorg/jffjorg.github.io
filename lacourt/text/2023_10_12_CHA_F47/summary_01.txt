And here is a summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the motion to compel deposition of Arminak LLC's person most qualified and Helga Arminak. The judge finds that Arminak LLC failed to produce a qualified witness in response to the plaintiff's notice of taking deposition and refused to produce a person most qualified for deposition unless the plaintiff agreed to combine the depositions. The judge also finds that Helga Arminak failed to comply with her discovery obligations.

The judge orders Arminak LLC to produce its person most qualified to answer questions and to produce documents at deposition as specified in the second amended deposition notice served on May 8, 2023. The judge also orders Helga Arminak to appear for her deposition within the next 30 days.

Sanctions are imposed on Arminak LLC in the amount of $5,089.65 and on Helga Arminak in the amount of $2,833.90. The sanctions are warranted due to the defendants' failure to comply with their discovery obligations and the plaintiff's resulting attorney's fees and costs.
