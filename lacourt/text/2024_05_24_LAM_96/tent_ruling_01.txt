  Case Number:  23STCP00511    Hearing Date:   May 24, 2024    Dept:  96 23STCP00511 SWAMP CAPITAL, LLC vs JAMES SHAW, AN
INDIVIDUAL
 
The Court has received two ex parte motions from Plaintiff
and Defendant regarding a Non-Jury Trial set on June 5, 2024. 
Plaintiff’s ex parte motion is to continue the trial until
after the date of Plaintiff’s demurrer on Defendant’s cross-complaint and
Defendant’s motion for leave to file an amended cross-complaint set on
September 16, 2024. 
Defendant seeks an ex parte motion to bifurcate the trial to
handle the complaint and the cross-complaint separately. 
After considering the papers, the Court will tentatively
agree to continue the trial until November 25, 2024. 
The Court will deny the motion to bifurcate as the issues
appear to be interrelated, would cause two trials on overlapping issues, and
given the disputed issues, such bifurcation would not promote judicial
efficiency. 
Plaintiff’s ex parte motion to continue trial is Granted and
Defendant’s ex parte motion to bifurcate the trial is Denied.
