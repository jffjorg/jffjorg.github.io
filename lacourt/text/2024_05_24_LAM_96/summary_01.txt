And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

"The court has received two ex parte motions, one from the plaintiff and one from the defendant, regarding a non-jury trial scheduled for June 5, 2024. The plaintiff's motion is to continue the trial until after the date of their demurrer on the defendant's cross-complaint, which is set for September 16, 2024. The defendant's motion is to bifurcate the trial to handle the complaint and cross-complaint separately. After considering the papers, the court will tentatively agree to continue the trial until November 25, 2024. The court will deny the defendant's motion to bifurcate as the issues appear to be interrelated and would cause two trials on overlapping issues, and given the disputed issues, such bifurcation would not promote judicial efficiency."
