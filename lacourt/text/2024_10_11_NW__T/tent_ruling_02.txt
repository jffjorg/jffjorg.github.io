 Case Number:  23VECV05505    Hearing Date:   October 11, 2024    Dept:  T 23VECV05505 Sepulveda
Village v Nguyen
Tentative ruling on motion for
terminating and monetary sanctions: Grant.
Code of Civil Procedure Section
2023.030 authorizes the Court to issue terminating sanctions (2023.030(d)),
issue sanctions (2023.030(b)) and evidence sanctions (2023.030(c))  Against a party who misuses the discovery
process. In order to award such sanctions, it is necessary only for the Court
to find that the party's disobedience is willful - no finding of bad faith is
required. Creed21 v. City of Wildomar (2017) 18 CA5th 690, 703.
"Misuses" of the discovery process include "Failing to respond
or submit to an authorized method of discovery" (CCP 2023.010(d)),
"Making an evasive response to discovery" (CCP 2023.010(f), and
"Disobeying a court order to provide discovery" (CCP 2023.010(g)). 
Defendant has clearly misused the
discovery process in this case, not only by willfully refusing to properly
respond, but also by willfully refusing to comply with this Court's order
compelling him to do so, despite the several occasions when Plaintiff's counsel
reminded Defendant of his duty to respond and to comply with this Court's order
- overtures which have been ignored.
This appears to be a part of
Defendant's pattern of refusing to comply with the procedures and rules of this
Court. 
To date, Defendant has refused
to: 
(a) file the required Case
Management Statement,
(b) appear at the March 13, 2024
Case Management Conference,
(c) respond to Plaintiff's DPD1
and FI1,
(d) respond to Plaintiff's
motions to compel responses to the DPD1 and FI1,
(e) appear at the hearing on
Plaintiff's motions to compel responses to the DPD1 and FI1,
(f) appear at the July 9, 2024
Trial Setting Conference,
(g) comply with this Court's
order of July 9, 2024 regarding discovery responses, despite Plaintiff's
counsel's communications to him requesting such compliance and
warning of the consequences.
No opposition was filed to this
motion.
The court finds that Defendant
has willfully failed to comply with the court’s order of 7/9/2024 and as a
sanctions, the court strikes Defendant’s General Denial of 2/23/2024 and enters
default against Defendant.
The court also finds that
Defendant has engaged in discovery abuse without substantial justification
which warrants the imposition of monetary sanctions against Defendant Kevin
Nguyen in the sum of $796.50, payable by 10/21/2024 to the Client Trust Account
of BOSCHÉ & BOSCHÉ,  300 Spectrum
Center Drive, Suite 400, Irvine, California 92618.
