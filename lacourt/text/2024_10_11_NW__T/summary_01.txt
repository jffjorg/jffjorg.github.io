As for the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the Plaintiff's petition to confirm the arbitration award is granted. The arbitrator awarded the Plaintiff a total of $418,482.58, which includes the principal amount, attorneys' fees, costs of suit, JAMS Arbitration fees and costs, and daily interest. The Defendant argued that the Petition is defective because it requests an award in excess of the amount awarded in the arbitration award, but the Judge found that the Petition is not in conflict with the arbitration award. The Defendant also argued that the arbitrator's award should be vacated due to misconduct and bias, but the Judge found that the Defendant failed to meet their burden to show substantial prejudice and/or bias. Therefore, the Judge is granting the Petition to Confirm the Award and ordering the Moving Party to submit a judgment in accordance with this order, attaching a copy of the arbitration award.
