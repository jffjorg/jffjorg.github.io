Introduction
Plaintiff RIF V – Odessa, LLC
(Plaintiff) moved to confirm the arbitration award decided against Defendants
Lets Restyle CA, Inc. and I Beauty Brands Inc. (collectively,
Defendants).  The arbitrator awarded Plaintiff a total of $418,482.58,
which is inclusive of the principal amount of $225,645.37, attorneys’ fees in
the amount of $55,191.50, costs of suit in the amount of $14,317.05, JAMS
Arbitration fees and costs in the amount of $45,250.00, and 10% daily interest
of $61.82 per day from January 18, 2021 to July 3, 2024 (1,263 days) in the
amount of $78,078.66.  The Arbitration Award further awarded Plaintiff 10%
daily interest of $61.82 from July 4, 2024 through to the final entry of
Judgment herein.   A signed copy of the award is attached as
Attachment 8(c).   There are 100 days between July 4, 2024 and this
hearing date, October 11, 2024.  The amount of days is inclusive of both
July 4, 2024 and October 11, 2024.
Discussion
                            
Unless a petition or response
seeking to correct or vacate an arbitration award was filed properly based upon
valid grounds, or the proceeding is dismissed, courts are required to enter
judgment in conformity with the award.  (Code of Civ. Proc. sec. 1286;
Valsan Partners Ltd. Partnership v. Calcor Space Facility (1994) 25 Cal.App.4th
809, 818.)  Defendants argued that the Petition is defective because it
requests an award in excess of the amount awarded in the arbitration
award.  The Petition is not seen to be requesting an amount above the
award.  The Petition’s paragraphs 8(b)(f) and 10(e) and (f) are not in
conflict.  The Arbitrator’s Award, attached as Attachment 8(c), makes it
clear that the $418,482.58 includes the costs and fees identified in Petition
paragraph 10(e) and (f).  Defendants’ first argument to vacate the award
is unpersuasive.
An arbitration award can be
vacated only on specific statutory grounds.  (Code Civ. Proc., sec.
1286.2.)  Defendants asserted that the Arbitration Award should be vacated
because their rights were substantially prejudiced by the arbitrator’s misconduct. 
(Code Civ. Proc., sec. 1286.2(a)(3).)  The burden of proof is upon the
party challenging the Award to establish facts to support their
contention.  (Betz v. Pankow (1993) 16 Cal.App.4th 919, 926.) 
Defendants argued that there was ex parte communications between the Arbitrator
and Plaintiff’s counsel regarding Defendants’ exhibits and the communications
biased the Arbitrator.  (Lyric Enav (Enav) Decl. pars. 2-4.) 
Allegedly the ex parte communications led to the arbitrator’s refusal to
consider all of Defendants’ exhibits.  (Enav Decl. pars. 5-9.) 
However, Plaintiff’s Counsel categorically denies any ex parte communications
with the arbitrator at any time during the arbitration.  (Lane Nussbaum
(Nussbaum) Decl. pars. 3-5.)  The evidence shows two competing declarations. 
The conflicting declarations by both Counsels present a “50-50” balancing of
the scale.  Because it is Defendants’ burden to show substantial prejudice
and/or bias, Defendants Counsel’s declaration is insufficient to tip the balance
of the scale in their favor.  Defendants failed to meet their
burden.  Defendants failed to sufficiently show a statutory ground to
vacate the Arbitration Award.
The Petition to Confirm the Award
is GRANTED.
MOVING PARTY SHALL SUBMIT A JUDGMENT
IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS ORDER, ATTACHING A COPY OF THE ARBITRATION AWARD.
IT IS SO ORDERED, CLERK TO GIVE
NOTICE.
