And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants Dow's motion to correct the minute order. The minute order in question was issued on August 18, 2023, and it contains statements about Dow's search for certain documents that are unclear. Dow argues that the statements in the minute order are in conflict with what was said during a hearing and what is recorded in the transcripts. The judge agrees with Dow and orders that the minute order be corrected to more accurately reflect what was said. The corrections include changing the language from "they cannot find it" to "Dow has not located documents which exists responsive to this request," and from "Dow Chemical represents it was produced in the Modesto Litigation under a protective order" to "Dow Chemical represents it does not know one way or the other if this document exists and if this document is subject to the Modesto Protective Order." The judge finds that the proposed corrections are necessary to clarify the record and to ensure that the court's orders are accurate.
