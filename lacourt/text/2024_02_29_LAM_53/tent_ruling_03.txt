The court notes that the Settlement Agreement provides for the recovery of up
to $20,000 for litigation expenses. 
(Genish Decl., Ex. 3, Settlement Agreement, ¶ 3.2.1.)  However, Plaintiffs’ counsel “only seeks
reimbursement of a total of $14,506.31 in litigation costs and expenses.”  (Genish Decl., ¶ 48.)
