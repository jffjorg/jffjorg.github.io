MOVING PARTIES:
            Plaintiffs Lexy Barajas and
Jason Marmon, as aggrieved employees and private attorney generals
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Unopposed
Motion for Approval of PAGA Settlement
The court
considered the moving papers filed in connection with this motion.  No opposition papers were filed.
DISCUSSION
Plaintiffs Lexy Barajas and Jason Marmon (“Plaintiffs”) seek an order
approving the settlement of their claims under the Labor Code Private Attorneys
General Act of 2004 (Labor Code, §¿2698, et seq.) (“PAGA”) set forth in the
PAGA Settlement Agreement (the “Settlement Agreement”) entered into by and
between Plaintiffs, on the one hand, and defendant H.W. Hunter, Inc.
(“Defendant”), on the other hand. 
The
parties have reached a settlement of $437,500. 
(Genish Decl., ¶ 22.) 
Under
PAGA, an aggrieved employee may bring a civil action personally and on behalf
of other current or former employees to recover civil penalties for Labor Code
violations.  (Iskanian v. CLS
Transportation Los Angeles, LLC (2014) 59 Cal.4th 348, 380, abrogated in
part on other grounds in Viking River Cruises, Inc. v. Moriana (2022)
596 U.S. 639, 662 [holding that the Federal Arbitration Act preempts the rule
of Iskanian insofar as it precludes the division of PAGA claims into
individual and non-individual claims through arbitration agreements].) 
Labor Code section 2699, subdivision (l)(2) provides that “[t]he superior court
shall review and approve any settlement of any civil action pursuant to”
PAGA.  
The
court’s review of PAGA settlements “ensur[es] that any negotiated resolution is
fair to those affected.”  (Williams v. Superior Court (2017) 3
Cal.5th 531, 549.)  In an effort to aid the court in the determination of
the fairness of the settlement, Wershba v. Apple Computer, Inc. (2001)
91 Cal.App.4th 224, 244-245 (disapproved on other grounds), discusses factors
that the court should consider when determining the reasonableness of a
settlement agreement.  “[A] presumption of fairness exists where: (1) the
settlement is reached through arm’s-length bargaining; (2) investigation and
discovery are sufficient to allow counsel and the court to act intelligently;
(3) counsel is experienced in similar litigation; and (4) the percentage of
objectors is small.”  (Id. at p. 245.)  “[T]he test is not the
maximum amount plaintiffs might have obtained at trial on the complaint, but
rather whether the settlement is reasonable under all of the
circumstances.”  (Id. at p. 250.)   
A
copy of the Settlement Agreement is attached to the declaration of Jonathan M.
Genish as Exhibit 3.  Pursuant to the
terms of the Settlement Agreement, Defendant has agreed to pay a total gross
settlement amount of $437,500, to be allocated as follows:
·       Up to
$145,833.33: payable to Plaintiffs’ counsel for attorney’s fees; 
·       $14,506.31:
payable to Plaintiffs’ counsel for litigation expenses;[1] 
·      
Up to $5,000: payable to plaintiff Lexy Barajas
for a plaintiff enhancement payment; 
·      
Up to $5,000: payable to plaintiff Jason Marmon for
a plaintiff enhancement payment; 
·      
Up to $5,000: payable to the administrator, ILYM
Group, Inc., for administration expenses; 
·       $262,160.36:
Estimated PAGA payment, of which $196,620.27, or 75 percent, will be paid to
the California Labor and Workface Development Agency, and $65,540.09, or 25
percent, will be paid to all aggrieved employees. 
(Genish Decl.,
Ex. 3, Settlement Agreement, ¶¶ 1.2, 1.12, 3.1, 3.2.1, 3.2.2, 3.2.2.1, 3.2.3;
Genish Decl., ¶¶ 22-23, 48; Marmon Decl., ¶¶ 4-15; Barajas Decl.,
¶¶ 4-15.) 
Within
14 days after Defendant funds the gross settlement amount, the administrator
will (1) issue checks for the individual PAGA payments to the aggrieved
employees, and (2) send, along with the payments, a cover letter that notifies
the aggrieved employees of Plaintiffs’ action and the parties’ settlement.  (Genish Decl., Ex. 3, Settlement Agreement, ¶
4.4.1 and Ex. A.) 
The
parties reached agreement following the exchange of formal and informal
discovery and arms-length bargaining that occurred during a mediation conducted
by Hon. Carl J. West (Ret.).  (Genish
Decl., ¶¶ 14-17, 30, 42.)  Based on
the argument and evidence set forth in Plaintiffs’ motion and the declarations
of Plaintiffs, Plaintiffs’ counsel, Jonathan M. Genish, and the president of
the proposed administrator, ILYM Group, Inc., the court finds that the PAGA
settlement set forth in the PAGA Settlement Agreement is fair, adequate, and
reasonable.
ORDER
            The court grants plaintiffs Lexy
Barajas and Jason Marmon’s motion for approval of PAGA settlement. 
            The court will sign and file the
proposed “Order and Judgment Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Approval of PAGA
Settlement and Award of PAGA Counsel Fees Payment, PAGA Counsel Litigation
Expenses Payment, Enhancement Payments, and Administration Expenses Payment,”
lodged by plaintiffs Lexy Barajas and Jason Marmon on October 9, 2023, as
modified by the court. 
 
 
 
 
  
The court
orders plaintiffs Lexy Barajas and Jason Marmon to give notice of
this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
 
DATED:  February 29, 2024
