And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for reconsideration filed by Plaintiffs Jen Bosworth and Miles Horton. The Plaintiffs are seeking to reconsider the court's May 16, 2023 order granting attorney's fees and costs to defendants Dwell Management, LLC and Simone Shah in the amount of $32,717.25. The Plaintiffs argue that the court did not address certain points raised by their opposition, that the defendants have been adequately compensated by the court's orders granting summary judgment, and that requiring the Plaintiffs to pay attorney's fees to the defendants would cause a significant financial hardship. The Judge finds that these arguments do not constitute new or different facts or circumstances that support reconsideration of the court's order. Therefore, the Judge denies the Plaintiffs' motion for reconsideration.
