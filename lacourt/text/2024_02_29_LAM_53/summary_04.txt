Summary in English:
The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the plaintiff's motion for sanctions against the defendants. The plaintiff sought to impose sanctions on the defendants for asserting unclean hands and fraud-based defenses without an adequate legal or factual basis. The judge found that the defendants' discovery responses and evidence presented by Jan Lambert, a managing director with Ankura Consulting, Inc., demonstrated that their affirmative defenses were not objectively unreasonable. The judge also found that the plaintiff had not presented evidence or argument showing that the defendants had asserted their affirmative defenses for an improper purpose. As a result, the judge denied the plaintiff's motion for sanctions and exercised its discretion to deny the defendants' request for an award of monetary sanctions.
