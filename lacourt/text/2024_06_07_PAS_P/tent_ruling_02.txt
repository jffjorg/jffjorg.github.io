ORDER GRANTING RESPONDENT/POWER OF ATTORNEY ANTONIO D. BUSTAMANTE’S MOTION FOR
RELEASE OF EXCESS SURPLUS FUNDS FROM TRUSTEE’S SALEI.        INTRODUCTION
          This is a petition for
unresolved claims and deposit of undistributed surplus proceeds of the
trustee’s sale of 777 E. Valley Blvd, Unit 29, Alhambra CA. The petition
provides that Anna Luisa Bustamante encumbered her real property on Valley
Blvd. in 2017. The petition further provides that a trustee sale was held on
February 9, 2023 and that the property sold for $465,000. The surplus funds at
issue are in the amount of $142,311.74.
          Respondent/Power of Attorney Antonio
D. Bustamante, on behalf of Ana Bustamante, filed this motion on January 23,
2024. He filed additional papers on February 5, 2024. He renewed his motion on
May 3, 2024. It is unopposed. For the
reasons that follow, the motion is granted.
II.      LEGAL
STANDARD
          Civil Code Section 2924k provides:
(a) The trustee, or the
clerk of the court upon order to the clerk pursuant to subdivision (d) of
Section 2924j, shall distribute the proceeds, or a portion of the proceeds, as
the case may be, of the trustee’s sale conducted pursuant to Section 2924h in
the following order of priority:
(1) To
the costs and expenses of exercising the power of sale and of sale, including
the payment of the trustee’s fees and attorney’s fees permitted pursuant to
subdivision (b) of Section 2924d and subdivision (b) of this section.
(2) To
the payment of the obligations secured by the deed of trust or mortgage which
is the subject of the trustee’s sale.
(3) To
satisfy the outstanding balance of obligations secured by any junior liens or
encumbrances in the order of their priority.
(4) To
the trustor or the trustor’s successor in interest. In the event the property
is sold or transferred to another, to the vested owner of record at the time of
the trustee’s sale.
(b) A trustee may charge
costs and expenses incurred for such items as mailing and a reasonable fee for
services rendered in connection with the distribution of the proceeds from a
trustee’s sale, including, but not limited to, the investigation of priority
and validity of claims and the disbursement of funds. If the fee charged for
services rendered pursuant to this subdivision does not exceed one hundred
dollars ($100), or one hundred twenty-five dollars ($125) where there are
obligations specified in paragraph (3) of subdivision (a), the fee is
conclusively presumed to be reasonable. (CC § 2924k.)
          Individuals who receive the notice of surplus funds may
submit written claims to the trustee within thirty (30) days of notice. (CC §
2924j(a)(4).) 
The
trustee shall exercise due diligence in determining the priority of claims to
the surplus funds. (CC § 2924j(b).) If there is no dispute as to the priority
of claims, the proceeds shall be paid out within 30 days of the conclusion of
the notice period. (Id.)
 III.    ANALYSIS
          Here, Antonio Bustamante, as power of attorney for Ana
Bustmante alleges that Ana Bustamante is the trustor, Anna Luisa Bustamante’s
successor in interest, satisfying CC Section 2924k(a)(4). He further alleges
that there are no unsatisfied claims superior over his claim as power of
attorney. (2/5/24 Claim p.5: 8-10.) Accordingly, he demands $134,218 be paid to
him as power of attorney for Ana Bustamante, as Ana has Alzheimer’s. (See Exh.
1: Evaluation of Ana, Exh. 2: Power of Attorney.) 
          He attaches a signed verification of his claim. (Bustamante
Verification.)
IV.     CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
          The Court hereby grants the motion for release of the funds
and orders the trustee, Clear Recon, to distribute funds of $134,218.00 to
Antonio Bustamante, as power of attorney for Ana Bustamante, successor in
interest to the original trustor.
          Attorney for Respondent to give notice of this ruling.
