 Case Number:  23AHCV02886    Hearing Date:   June 7, 2024    Dept:  P [TENTATIVE]
ORDER GRANTING DEFENDANT FORD MOTOR CO.’S MOTION FOR JUDGMENT ON THE PLEADINGSI.        INTRODUCTION
          This is a lemon law case.
          Before the Court is Defendant Ford Motor Co. and Ford of
Montebello (collectively Ford)’s motion for judgment on the pleadings. It
contends that the Song-Beverly causes of action fail because the car was not
new and that the fraudulent concealment and negligent repair causes of action
fail to state sufficient facts. 
Ford
filed the motion on March 28, 2024. Plaintiff filed an opposition on May 24,
2024. Ford filed a reply on May 31, 2024. The motion is granted.
          II. REQUEST FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE
          Ford’s request for judicial notice
          Ford requests the Court take judicial notice of the Retail
Installment Sale Contract for the purchase of a used 2021 Ford F-450 truck
under Evidence Code Section 452(h). As this is the contract that sold the car
at issue to Plaintiff, the Court holds it is judicially noticeable under this
code section as an item not reasonably subject to dispute. (EC § 452(d).)
          Judicial notice is taken of Exhibit B.
          Garcia’s request for judicial notice
          Garcia requests judicial notice of a recent opinion out of
the 2nd District Court of Appeals in California, Brandi Stiles et al. v. Kia
Motors America, Inc. As this is a record of a California court, it is
judicially noticeable.
          Judicial notice is taken of Exh. A. 
III.     LEGAL
STANDARD
          Code Civ. Proc. Section 438 provides for a motion for
judgment on the pleadings. When the moving party is the defendant, the motion
may be made on either one of two grounds: the court lacks subject matter
jurisdiction; or the complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a
cause of action against that defendant. (CCP § 438(c)(3)(B).) 
          “A defendant may move for judgment on the pleadings on the
ground that the complaint does not state facts sufficient to state a cause of
action against that defendant. (Code Civ. Proc., § 438(c)(1)(B)(ii); People
ex rel. Harris v. Pac Anchor Transportation, Inc. (2014) 59 Cal.4th 772,
777.) A motion for judgment on the pleadings ‘is equivalent to a demurrer and
is governed by the same de novo standard of review.’ (Kapsimallis v.
Allstate Ins. Co. (2002) 104 Cal.App.4th 667, 672.)” Templo v. State
(2018) 24 Cal.App.5th 730, 735.) Except as provided in CCP Section 438, which
governs motions for judgment on the pleadings, the rules governing demurrers
apply. (See Cloud v. Northrop Grumman Corp. (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 995, 999.)
Parties’ ability to prove their respective claims is of no concern. (Cloud
v. Northrop Grumman Corp. (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 995, 99.)  Though the
Court must accept the allegations of the complaint and answer as true (Gerawan
Farming, Inc. v. Lyons (2000) 24 Cal.4th 468, 515), it will not do so for
“conclusions of law or fact, opinions, speculation, or allegations contrary to
law or [judicially noticed] facts…” (Stevenson Real Estate Servs., Inc. v.
CB Richard Ellis Real Estate Servs., Inc. (2006) 138 Cal.App.4th 1215,
1219-20.) 
          Code Civ. Proc. §439(a)(2) mandates that five days before
filing a motion for judgment on the pleadings, the parties meet and confer.  
          IV.     ANALYSIS 
          A. Meet and Confer
          Pursuant to CCP Section 439(a)(2), five days before filing
a motion for judgment on the pleadings, the parties must meet and confer. (CCP
§ 439(a)(2).) 
          The declaration of counsel is offered to demonstrate
compliance with this requirement. (Won Declaration.) Won declares that he sent
a meet and confer letter to Plaintiff’s counsel on February 20, 2024. (Won
Decl. ¶ 3, see Exh. A.) Plaintiff’s counsel did not respond.
          This is sufficient for meet and confer purposes.
          B. Causes of Action One, Two, Three and Four for
Violation of the Song-Beverly Act Fail
Ford
argues that the first through fourth causes of action fail because Plaintiff bought
a used car, not a new car. Civ. Code §1793.22 (e) defines what “New Motor
Vehicle” means for purposes of the Song-Beverly Act (lemon law), including “a
dealer-owned vehicle and a “demonstrator” or other motor vehicle sold with a
manufacturer’s new car warranty.” ( CC § 1793.22(e)(2), Bolding
added.) Ford cites Rodriguez v.  FCA US LLC
(2022) 77 Cal.App.5th 209, 218, review granted July 13, 2022, S274625. Rodriguez
is cited here for its persuasive value.  
Rodriguez parses the meaning of the words, “or other motor
vehicle sold with a manufacturer’s new car warranty,” to determine whether this
covers the sale of previously owned vehicles with some balance remaining on the
manufacturer’s express warranty. In a well-reasoned and persuasive opinion, Rodriguez
concludes it does not. Instead, it holds that “demonstrators and dealer-owned
vehicles” are a narrow class of “basically new vehicles” that “have
never been previously sold to a consumer and they come with full express
warranties.” Rodriguez, supra, 77 Cal.App.5th 209 at 220,
bolding added. “[W]e conclude the phrase “other motor vehicle sold with a
manufacturer’s new car warranty” unambiguously refers to cars that come with a
new or full express warranty.” (Id. at 222.) 
Rodriguez distinguishes Jensen v. BMW of North America, Inc.
(1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 112, a case where the consumer was provided with
the manufacturer’s full new car warranty. 
While
the holding of Jensen is that cars sold with a balance remaining on the
manufacturer’s new motor vehicle warranty are “new motor vehicles” within the
meaning of Civ. Code §1793.22, Rodriguez notes that Jensen was
not required to decide the issue since the subject vehicle there was sold with
a full new car warranty. It notes that other cases, including Dagher v. Ford
Motor Co. (2015) 238 Cal.App.4th 905, have also found it appropriate to
limit Jensen to the facts before it. For example, Kiluk v. Mercedes-Benz
USA, LLC (2019) 43 Cal.App.5th 334, 340, expressed having reservations
about applying Jensen but found it did not have to under the particular
facts before it.
          Here, Plaintiff’s 2021 Ford F-450 was purchased used with
56,548 miles on it. (RJN Exh. B.) Plaintiff does not allege he purchased this vehicle
with a new car warranty. (Complaint ¶ 9.) In fact, Plaintiff does not allege whether
he purchased the vehicle new or used.  
          Ford urges that these causes of action fail for failure to
allege that Ford sold the vehicle directly to Plaintiff. The Court agrees, the
vehicle was sold by Dahlia Motor Group Inc. (RJN Exh. B.)  Even in the absence of that judicially noticed
information, Plaintiff fails to allege that he purchased the vehicle from Ford
or from a dealer affiliated with Ford. 
The sole reference to any transactional relationship between Plaintiff
and FMC in the complaint is contained within paragraph 9: “On or about November
13, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a warranty contract with Defendant FMC
regarding a 2021 Ford F450 vehicle identification number 1FDUF4GT0MEC12571
(hereafter "Vehicle"), which was manufactured and/or distributed by Defendant
FMC.” 
          In his opposition, Plaintiff urges that per his judicially
noticed material, there is a theory that would allow him to pursue these causes
of action. (See RJN Exh. A.) However, even assuming the truth of this argument,
the Complaint does not plead that Plaintiff’s vehicle had remaining miles on
the manufacturer’s written warranty. Plaintiff further argues that the Court
should not consider the Rodriguez case. The Court disagrees. 
          Because the car at issue is a used car purchased from a
third party and there is no allegation of a new car warranty under Rodriguez,
the first through fourth causes of action fail.
          C. Negligent Repair
          Ford argues that Plaintiff fails to state a claim for
negligent repair. The Complaint provides that Plaintiff presented the vehicle
to Ford of Montebello at least once (¶ 57), Ford of Montebello owed a duty to
use ordinary skill and care in effectuating those repairs (¶ 58), did not do so
(¶ 59) and Plaintiff was harmed. (¶ 60.) However, the Complaint does not
contain allegation of the dates the vehicle was presented for repairs, whether
Ford of Montebello accepted the vehicle for repairs and what the result was. 
          In his opposition, Plaintiff does not resolve these issues.
          The motion for judgment on the pleadings is granted as to
the fifth cause of action.
          D. Fraudulent Concealment
          i. Elements of Fraudulent Concealment are Met
Ford
is correct that fraud is subject to a heightened pleading standard. Each
element must be pleaded with particularity. (Glaski v. Bank of America
(2013) 218 Cal.App.4th 1079, 1090; Heritage Pacific Financial, LLC v. Monroy
(2013) 215 Cal.App.4th 972, 989.) Fraud actions are subject to “strict
requirements of particularity in pleading.  . . . Accordingly, the rule is
followed everywhere that fraud must be specifically pleaded. The effect of this
rule is twofold: (a) General pleading of the legal conclusion of ‘fraud’ is
insufficient; the facts constituting the fraud must be alleged. (b) Every
element of the cause of action for fraud must be alleged in the proper manner
(i.e., factually and specifically), and the policy of liberal construction of
the pleadings ... will not ordinarily be invoked to sustain a pleading
defective in any material respect.” (Committee on Children’s Television,
Inc. v. General Foods Corp. (1983) 35 Cal.3d 197, 216, superseded by
statute on other grounds.) A fraud cause of action must contain: “(1) a
knowingly false representation by the defendant; (2) an intent to deceive or
induce reliance; (3) justifiable reliance by the plaintiff; and (4) resulting
damages.” (Service by Medallion, Inc. v. Clorox Co. (1996) 44
Cal.App.4th 1807, 1816.) Fraud based on concealment requires that “(1) the
defendant must have concealed or suppressed a material fact, (2) the defendant
must have been under a duty to disclose the fact to the plaintiff, (3) the
defendant must have intentionally concealed or suppressed the fact with the
intent to defraud the plaintiff, (4) the plaintiff must have been unaware of
the fact and would not have acted as he did if he had known of the concealed or
suppressed fact, and (5) as a result of the concealment or suppression of the
fact, the plaintiff must have sustained damage.”  (Bigler-Engler v.
Breg, Inc. (2017) 7 Cal.App.5th 276, 310-311.)  Less specificity is
required to plead fraud by concealment.  (Ibid.) “Even under
the strict rules of common law pleading, one of the canons was that less
particularity is required when the facts lie more in the knowledge of the
opposite party.” (Alfaro v. Community Housing Improvement System &
Planning Assn., Inc. (2009) 171 Cal.App.4th 1256, 1384.) 
Plaintiff
alleges Defendant knew since 2018 that the transmission was defective, namely
that the transmission may cause harsh or delayed shifts. (Complaint ¶ 69.) 
These defects allegedly expose Plaintiff, his passengers, and others on the
road to a serious risk of accident and injury.  (Id. at ¶ 65.) 
Plaintiff did not know about these defects and problems, and Defendant did not
disclose the defects when Plaintiff purchased the vehicle.  (Id. at
¶¶ 62-64.)  Further, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant Ford had superior
knowledge of the transmission issues and had a duty to disclose such
information. (Id. at ¶ 69.) As a result, Plaintiff has suffered actual
damages. (Id. at ¶ 74.)
These
allegations are specific enough to allege the information that was concealed,
and the danger the defect posed. (See Jones v. ConocoPhillips Co.
(2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 1187, 1199-1200.)  
ii.
Transactional Relationship Is Not Adequately Alleged
Ford
argues that the Complaint does not adequately plead facts sufficient to
establish the existence of a duty to disclose. The Court agrees. A duty to
disclose does not exist in all circumstances. The tort of fraudulent
concealment is only viable where it does. “There are ‘“four circumstances in
which nondisclosure or concealment may constitute actionable fraud: (1) when
the defendant is in a fiduciary relationship with the plaintiff; (2) when the
defendant had exclusive knowledge of material facts not known to the plaintiff;
(3) when the defendant actively conceals a material fact from the plaintiff;
and (4) when the defendant makes partial representations but also suppresses
some material facts. [Citation.]”’ (LiMandri v. Judkins (1997) 52
Cal.App.4th 326, 336.) Where there is no fiduciary relationship, a duty to
disclose exists only where the parties are in a direct transactional
relationship. (CACI 1901; Hoffman v. 162 North Wolfe, LLC (2014) 228
Cal.App.4th 1178, 1187.) The Complaint does not allege that Ford and Plaintiff
were in a fiduciary or direct transactional relationship. (RJN Exh. B.) 
iii.
Economic Loss Rule Does Not Bar the Cause of Action
Lastly,
Ford urges that the sixth cause of action for fraudulent concealment is barred
by the economic loss rule. The Court disagrees. The economic loss doctrine bars
claims for negligently inflicted economic damages without claims of physical or
property damage. (Sheen v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (2022) 12 Cal.5th 905,
922, internal citations omitted; see also Robinson Helicopter Co., Inc. v.
Dana Corp. (2004) 34 Cal.4th 979, 988; Dhital v. Nissan North America
(2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 828, 838.[1]) “Here,
the fraudulent inducement exception to the economic loss rule applies.
Plaintiffs allege that Nissan, by intentionally concealing facts about the
defective transmission, fraudulently induced them to purchase a car. Fraudulent
inducement is a viable tort claim under California law.” (Dhital, supra,
84 Cal.App.5th at 838.) 
The
Complaint alleges that Ford knowingly and intentionally concealed material
facts (Complaint ¶ 69) and that this concealment fraudulently induced Plaintiff
to purchase his vehicle. (¶ 75.)
However,
as Plaintiff did not adequately allege a transactional relationship and there
is evidence before the Court that Plaintiff and Ford are not in a transactional
relationship, the motion is granted to the sixth cause of action.
V.       ORDER
          Defendant Ford Motor Co. and Ford of Montebello’s motion
for judgment on the pleadings is granted as to all causes of action with 20
days leave to amend.
 Counsel for Defendants to
give notice of this order.
