significant statements:
  - "The defendant may, but need not, present evidence that conclusively negates an element of the plaintiff's cause of action. The defendant may also present evidence that the plaintiff does not possess, and cannot reasonably obtain, needed evidence â€“ as through admissions by the plaintiff following extensive discovery to the effect that he has discovered nothing." (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 854)
  - "If plaintiffs respond to comprehensive interrogatories seeking all known facts with boilerplate answers that restate their allegations, or simply provide laundry lists of people and/or documents, the burden of production will almost certainly be shifted to them once defendants move for summary judgment and properly present plaintiff's factually devoid discovery responses." (Weber v. John Crane, Inc. (2006) 143 Cal.App.4th 1433, 1440)
  - "The mere 'possibility' of exposure' is insufficient to establish causation." (Izell v. Union Carbide Corporation (2014) 231 Cal.App.4th 962, 969)
  - "Plaintiffs may be able to prove that, unlike the situation in Izell, DAP used Defendant's Nytal-3X talc and IT-3X talc in most DAP 33 glazing products, and used only a small amount of talc from other vendors."
