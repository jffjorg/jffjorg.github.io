Significant Statements:
  - "A defendant seeking summary judgment must ‘conclusively negate[] a necessary element of the plaintiff’s case, or . . . demonstrate[] that under no hypothesis is there a material issue of fact that requires the process of trial.’" (Guz v. Bechtel Nat. Inc. (2000) 24 Cal.4th 317, 334)
  - "Plaintiffs respond to comprehensive interrogatories seeking all known facts with boilerplate answers that restate their allegations, or simply provide laundry lists of people and/or documents, the burden of production will almost certainly be shifted to them once defendants move for summary judgment and properly present plaintiff’s factually devoid discovery responses." (Weber v. John Crane, Inc. (2006) 143 Cal.App.4th 1433, 1440)
  - "The court cannot judge credibility on a motion for summary judgment. Delgado established sufficient foundation for his testimony – he was friends with Aglipay and saw him working on cars."
