          Plaintiff filed a late opposition (1/10/24 at 3:51p.m.,
the day before the hearing) indicating that service of the motions was improper
because it was via Dropbox and that he had not consented to service via
Dropbox.  The Court reviewed the motions
and finds that the proof of service of same indicate service was made by e-mail.  

 
Meet and Confer
C.C.P. §2030.300(b), C.C.P. §2031.310(b)(2),
and C.C.P. §2033.290(b)(1) provide that a motion to compel further responses
to interrogatories, requests for production, and requests for admissions “shall
be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040.”  A meet and confer declaration in support of a
motion shall state facts showing a reasonable and good faith attempt at an
informal resolution of each issue presented by the motion.  (C.C.P. §2016.040.) 
Defendant’s counsel declares on July 3,
2023, he sent a meet and confer letters to Plaintiff’s former counsel, Jonathan
Gerber (“Gerber”), concerning Plaintiff’s objections to FROG, SROG, RFP, and
RFA.  (Decl. of Riley ¶9, Exh. 9.)  Defendant’s counsel declares Gerber requested
an additional extension of time to provide further responses to the outstanding
discovery.  (Decl. of Riley ¶10, Exh. 10.)
 
Defendant’s counsel declares on or about
August 18, 2023, Plaintiff’s current counsel, Robert Gentino (“Gentino”) sent
Plaintiff’s counsel and email advising him that he was substituting into the
action.  (Decl. of Riley ¶11, Exh. 11.)  Defendant’s counsel declares on August 23,
2023, Gentino sent Plaintiff’s counsel an email requesting an additional
two-week extension to September 11, 2023, to provide further responses to the
discovery, extending Plaintiff’s deadline to respond to October 11, 2023.  (Decl. of Riley ¶12,
Exh. 12.)  Defendant’s
counsel declares he granted Gentino’s request for a further
extension.  (Decl. of Riley ¶13,
Exh. 13.)  Defendant’s counsel declares
notwithstanding the extension, no response to the discovery was received from
Gentino.  (Decl. of Riley ¶13.)  
Defendant’s counsel declares on
September 26, 2023, he sent an email to Gentino advising him that the Court required
an IDC before a motion to compel could be brought and asked him whether he was willing
to attend an IDC and whether he would extend the date for motions to compel to
October 31, 2023.  (Decl. of Riley ¶16,
Exh. 16.)  Defendant’s counsel
declares Gentino responded, “Yes, and I will serve responses this week.”  (Decl. of Riley
¶16, Exh. 16.)  Defendant’s
counsel declares he advised Gentino that he would schedule the IDC
for October 10, 2023.  (Decl.
of Riley ¶16, Exh. 16.)  Defendant’s
counsel declares on October 3, 2023, he attempted to follow up on
the status of Plaintiff’s portion of the joint IDC brief, and on October 4,
2023, Gentino responded, “IDC is too early. Waiting to speak with former
counsel and client to obtain responses. I don’t have all info yet and grant you
open extension to compel further until I get responses either this or next
week. Thank you.”  (Decl. of Riley ¶17,
Exh. 17.)  The Court determines
Defendant’s meet and confer declaration is sufficient under C.C.P. §2030.300(b),
C.C.P. §2031.310(b)(2), and C.C.P. §2033.290(b)(1).
The Court also notes that the subject
discovery was the subject of an informal discovery conference on October 23,
2024 at which Plaintiff’s counsel agreed to provide Code of Civil Procedure
compliant responses by November 30, 2024.
 
Background
On May 15, 2023, Defendant served FROG,
SROG, RFP, and RFA on Plaintiff.  (Decl.
of Riley ¶¶2-6, Exhs. 1-4.)  On June 30,
2023, Plaintiff’s counsel served responses to the FROG, SROG, RFP, and RFA that
contained only objections.  (Decl. of Riley
¶8, Exhs. 5-8.). Defendant’s counsel declares he granted Plaintiff’s former and
current counsel multiple extensions to provide supplemental responses.  (See Decl. of Riley ¶¶10, 12, 13.)  Defendant’s counsel declares no supplemental
responses have been received.  (Decl. of
Riley ¶18.)
On October 6, 2023, Defendant filed the
instant motions.  Plaintiff filed a late opposition to all 4 motions (1/10/24 at 3:51p.m.,
the day before the hearing) indicating that service of the motions was improper
because it was made via Dropbox and that he had not consented to service via
Dropbox.  The Court reviewed the motions
and finds that the proof of service of same indicates service was made by
e-mail.  
 
Discussion
1.     FROG
Defendant moves to compel further
responses to FROG Nos. 1.1-50.6 without objections.
The Court grants the motion pursuant to C.C.P §2030.300(a).  Plaintiff is to
provide responses, without objections, within 20 days.
Defendant requests monetary sanctions
for this motion totaling $1,500.00
for attorneys’ fees and filing fees of $68.91 against Plaintiff and its counsel. In light of the fact that Defendant’s
separate statement largely repeats the same response from Plaintiff and its own
reasons why a further response should be compelled, the Court finds the amount
sought in sanctions requires a reduction. The Court awards sanctions pursuant
to C.C.P. §§2031.300(c) and 2023.020 and calculates the sanctions for the
instant motion as follows:

(1 hour drafting the instant motion and
separate statement + 1 hour drafting the consolidated declaration + 1 hour
appearing at the hearing) x $600/hour + $68.91 in filing fees = $1,868.91.
Defendant’s request for sanctions

total of $1,868.91.  Sanctions are
payable within 20 days.
