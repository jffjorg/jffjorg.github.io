 Hearing
  Date: May 14, 2024



 
 
Plaintiff’s motion for an award of after-judgment costs
incurred in enforcing the judgment is GRANTED IN PART, DENIED IN PART. Plaintiff’s
motion is DENIED as to $189.43 in requested costs, but GRANTED as to the
remainder.
 
On June 7, 2019, Plaintiff Jacob Reich filed
a Complaint against Defendant Mansour Hashem. On September 1, 2020, Plaintiff
filed a second amended complaint (SAC) alleging: (1) breach of written
contract; (2) money had and received; (3) common counts; (4) open book account;
(5) account stated; (6) failure to honor checks; (7) fraud; (8) negligence; (9)
unjust enrichment; (10) judiciary foreclosure; and (11) reformation of
contract. 
 
On September 9, 2019, Defendant filed a XC
against Plaintiff, setting forth claims for (1) fraud, (2) breach of fiduciary
duty, and (3) declaratory relief. 
 
Now, Plaintiff moves for an order awarding reasonable
costs enforcing the judgment.
 
            The motion is unopposed. 
 
Discussion  
 
            Plaintiff moves to recover costs totaling
$5,172.44. There cost are for:
 
The
Costs incurred herein consists of the costs of this motion, the sum of $61.6
for filing this motion, (see EXHIBIT 1.) $2,000.00 was requested by and paid to
the Sheriff together with the levy request. (See Exhibit 2). The total sum of
sum of $808.55 was incurred in connection with the levy on Defendant’s bank
account and is reflected in the invoices which together are EXHIBIT 3. (See
Exhibit 3). The sum of $500.00 was paid to Ido Giat and was paid for his expert
opinion regarding the value of the Defendant’s Properties expressed in his
declaration which was part of the Motion to Determine claim of Exemption which
was filed with the Court on September 8, 2023. (See EXHIBIT 4, which is the
invoice together with a copy of the cancelled Check). Costs of $61.65 was
incurred to reserve the Motion to Determine Claim of Exemption. There was a
cost of $810.00 to serve the tenants with the Order of Rent Assignment (see
EXHIBIT 5). There was a cost of $650.00 for the appraisal fee required for the
Sheriff Levy and for an OSC as to why the Sheriff should not sell said property
(see Exhibit 6). The Plaintiff moved the court Ex Parte to continue the hearing
on Defendant’s Motion to revoke the Court Order of assignment of Rent. In
connection with that Ex Parte Application the sum of $113.00 was incurred in
connection with providing the court with courtesy copy of the Ex Parte (See
Exhibit 7). The filing fee of that ex parte was $76.43 (See Exhibit 8). Then
there was another Ex Parte to advance the hearing on the Motion to appoint a
receiver. This ex parte became necessary when it was discovered that Defendant
even before the Order of assignment of rent has collected rent without paying
the secured creditors. Filing that ex parte involved costs of $76.43 for filing
fee. (See Exhibit 9). The filing fee for a Motion to appoint a Receiver was
$76.43 (see Exhibit 10)
 
            (Motion, 2: 3-25.)  
 
            Plaintiff argues that these costs
were necessary to enforce the judgment. However, the Court disagrees in part.
Plaintiff’s ex parte request to continue Defendant’s motion to revoke the Court
order was not necessary to collect the judgment.  Accordingly, Plaintiff is not entitled to
recover either the $113.00 incurred as part of that request, or the $76.43
filing fee. 
 
            This motion is unopposed. Thus,
Defendant is considered to have conceded to the merits of the motion. 
 
            Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s
motion for an award of after-judgment costs is granted in part, denied in part.
Plaintiff’s motion is denied as to $189.43 in requested costs, but granted as
to the remainder. 
 
 
It is
so ordered.
