And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants the motion for leave to amend the cross-complaint by adding the Hoppers as cross-defendants. The judge finds that the amendment is necessary and proper to ensure complete relief for the Millers, as the Hoppers' negligent conduct was a contributory cause of the damages alleged against the Covingtons. The judge notes that the Millers have provided a redlined version of the proposed first amended cross-complaint and a declaration from Alec P. Schulman, which satisfies the requirements of California Rules of Court, rule 3.1324. The judge orders that the proposed amended cross-complaint be filed and served on or before June 7, 2024.
