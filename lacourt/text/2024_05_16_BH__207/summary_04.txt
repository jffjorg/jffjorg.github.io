```

And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has tentatively denied Plaintiff Justin Shelton's motion for summary adjudication, finding that the motion is untimely. The motion was filed less than 30 days prior to the scheduled trial date, which is a violation of Code of Civil Procedure section 437c. The judge also notes that Plaintiff failed to file an amended complaint after being granted leave to amend, and that the motion for summary adjudication appears to seek adjudication of a cause of action not actually alleged in the operative complaint. The judge has denied the motion, and Defendant WIB Holdings, LLC is required to file notice of the ruling with a proof of service.
