Summary of the Tentative Ruling:
The Court denies the Plaintiffs' motion for leave to amend the Complaint to pursue new theories of recovery. The Court finds that the proposed amendments are not necessary or proper and that the Plaintiffs have not demonstrated how the proposed amendments will clarify their causes of action. The Court also finds that the Plaintiffs have not demonstrated how the proposed amendments will prejudice the Defendant. The Court notes that the Plaintiffs' request for leave to amend the Complaint is untimely and that the Plaintiffs have not sought to reopen discovery and/or continue the trial to mitigate the prejudice that the Defendant will be subjected to by the prolonged delay in seeking to amend the Complaint.
