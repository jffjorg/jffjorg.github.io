Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling is a result of a demurrer filed by Plaintiff Sherman Oaks First Plaza, LLC against the cross-complaint filed by Defendants Lorena Sanchez and Lorena B. Sanchez dba Honor Yoga, et al. The demurrer challenges the legal sufficiency of the cross-complaint, which alleges that Plaintiff breached the lease agreement and guaranty. The court finds that the cross-complaint does not specifically state a cause of action and is therefore uncertain, ambiguous, and unintelligible. As a result, the court sustains the demurrer with 30 days leave to amend. The motion to strike the cross-complaint is denied as moot, given the sustaining of the demurrer.
