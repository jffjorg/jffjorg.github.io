And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has considered the request for default judgment against defendants FBSR Franchises, Inc. and Lord Brice Barrington aka Barron Barrington. However, the plaintiff has failed to submit a dismissal of the DOE defendants as required by California Rules of Court Rule 3.1800. Additionally, the plaintiff's request for damages exceeds the legal limit of $100,000.00. Therefore, the court cannot award more than $100,000.00 in damages. The plaintiff has two options: accept the current award limit and submit a corrected package seeking that amount, or set aside the default and amend the complaint to state the exact amount of damages and restart the default process.
