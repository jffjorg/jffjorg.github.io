 Case Number:  23STCV00097    Hearing Date:   October 31, 2023    Dept:  14  MOTION FOR DEFAULT JUDGMENT(against Defendants FBSR Franchises, Inc. and Lord Brice Barrington aka
Barron Barrington) Facts of the Case:  This is an action to recover unpaid
rent. Procedural History:On January 4, 2023, Plaintiff filed
its Complaint for (1) Breach of Contract and (2) Breach of Guaranty against Defendants
FBSR Franchises, Inc. (“FBSR”), Lord Brice Barrington aka Barron Barrington (“Barrington”),
and DOES 1-25.  On March 14, 2023, the defaults of
Defendants FBSR and Barrington were entered. Submitted: The requirements of California Rules
of Court Rule 3.1800 have not been met. Principal Requested: $248,931.80. Interest: 
$4,422.42. Attorney Fees:  $4,423.54. Costs: $805.72. Discussion:  Plaintiff has failed to submit a dismissal of the DOE defendants as required by
California Rules of Court Rule 3.1800(a)(7). Additionally, there is a legal
limitation on the amount available to Plaintiff at this time. This limitation
means that the calculation of interest pursuant to statue, and attorney’s fees
pursuant to local rule, is also incorrect. Available Damages  Code of Civil Procedure
§ 580(a) provides that the relief on default “cannot exceed that demanded
in the complaint [or] in the statement required by Section 425.11.” This court
lacks the power to award more than the amount demanded in either (a) the complaint
or (b) a statutory statement of damages form which has been served upon the defendants
prior to the entry of their default. Airs Aromatics, LLC v. CBL Data
Recovery Technologies, Inc. (2018) 23 Cal.App.5th 1013, 1018; Finney
v. Gomez (2003) 111 Cal.App.4th 527, 543-544.  Pleadings that seek damages “according
to proof at trial” or “in a sum that exceeds the jurisdictional minimum” of the
court are insufficiently specific. Airs Aromatics, supra, 23
Cal.App.5th at 1018-19. If the Plaintiff elects to proceed by way of
statement of damages, the statement form must be served (a) in the same manner
as the summons and complaint, and (b) before the entry of default. Code
of Civil Procedure § 425.11; Finney, supra, 111 Cal.App.4th
at 543-544. Otherwise, the statement of damages serves no purpose. The Defendant
cannot go back in time and “un-default” in light of the new information about the
extent of their exposure in the case. There is no evidence in this case
that Plaintiff served a statement of damages before default was entered
on March 14, 2023. And the complaint itself contains no specific prayer for
relief, instead merely indicating that the amount of damages could be anywhere
from $100,000 to $500,000. In such a situation, following the rule of Airs
Aromatics, supra, 23 Cal.App.5th at 1018-19, the most the
court can award is $100,000.00. Other Calculations             Since the
amount of damages available is $100,000.00 rather than $248,931.80, the
resulting calculation of interest under the statute, and attorney’s fees under
the local rules, must be revised. Conclusion Because Plaintiff has sought more
damages than are legally available, the request for default judgment is DENIED,
without prejudice. Plaintiff is instructed that they have two
options for proceeding: (1)  
Accept the current award limit of $100,000 in damages
and submit a corrected package seeking that amount (and re-calculating the attorney’s
fees and interest) within 30 days, or(2)  
Set aside the default and amend the complaint to state
the exact amount of damages, then start the default process over again.
