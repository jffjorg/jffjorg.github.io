And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has denied Terra Ocean's ex parte motion to dismiss the entire action. Terra Ocean claims that its interest in the lease has been transferred to Cross-Defendant CB 1733 and therefore no longer has standing to pursue its case. The court finds that Terra Ocean has the right to dismiss its own complaint, but cannot represent Cross-Defendant CB 1733. The court also finds that Cross-Defendant CB 1733 has already been added to the cross-complaint and that no further action is required from the court.

The court has also denied Landlord's request for leave to amend the cross-complaint to add CB 1733 in lieu of ROE 1, as this was done on October 24, 2023. The court has also denied the request to continue the motions for summary judgment, as there are no such motions on the calendar.

However, the court has vacated the pending trial date, final status conference date, and reserved date for a motion for leave to amend due to the departure of Terra Ocean and the entrance of CB 1733, which has sufficiently disturbed the posture of the case. The court has set a new trial setting conference on December 11, 2023, at 8:30 am.
