Background
 
On December 9, 2022, Consumer
Advocacy Group, Inc. (“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint against Walmart, Inc.;
Walmart.com USA, LLC; Kreassive, Inc.; Kreassive, LLC; Jeollanam-Do Los Angeles
Trade Office, Inc.; and Does 1 to 20 for Violation of the Proposition 65, the
Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986 (Health Saf. Code §
25249.5. et seq.) 
 
Defendants Kreassive, Inc. and
Jeollanam-Do Los Angeles Trade Office, Inc. were dismissed as Defendants on
November 28, 2023. 
 
On February 20, 2024,
Defendants Walmart, Inc.; Walmart.com USA, LLC; and Kreassive, LLC
(collectively “Defendants”) filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings
(“MJOP”). Plaintiff opposes the Motion. The matter is now before the court. 
 
motion for
judgment on the pleadings
 
I.         Legal Standard
 
“A motion for judgment on the
pleadings performs the same function as a general demurrer, and hence attacks
only defects disclosed on the face of the pleadings or by matters that can be
judicially noticed.” (Burnett v. Chimney Sweep (2004) 123 Cal.App.4th
1057, 1064.) “In deciding or reviewing a judgment on the pleadings, all
properly pleaded material facts are deemed to be true, as well as all facts
that may be implied or inferred from those expressly alleged.” (Fire Ins.
Exchange v. Superior Court (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 446, 452.) When
considering demurrers and judgment on the pleadings, courts read the
allegations liberally and in context. (Wilson v. Transit Authority of City
of Sacramento (1962) 199 Cal.App.2d 716, 720-21.) A motion for judgment on
the pleadings does not lie as to a portion of a cause of action. (Id.)
“In the case of either a demurrer or a motion for judgment on the pleadings,
leave to amend should be granted if there is any reasonable possibility that
the plaintiff can state a good cause of action.” (Gami v. Mullikin Medical
Ctr. (1993) 18 Cal.App.4th 870, 876.) A non-statutory motion for judgment
on the pleadings may be made any time before or during trial. (Stoops v.
Abbassi (2002) 100 Cal.App.4th 644, 650.) 
 
II.        Request for Judicial Notice
 
The court may take judicial notice of “official
acts of the legislative, executive, and judicial departments of the United
States and of any state of the United States,” “[r]ecords of (1) any court of
this state or (2) any court of record of the United States or of any state of
the United States,” and “[f]acts and propositions that are not reasonably
subject to dispute and are capable of immediate and accurate determination by
resort to sources of reasonably indisputable accuracy.” (Evid. Code, § 452, subds.
(c), (d), and (h).) “Taking judicial
notice of a document is not the same as accepting the truth of its contents or
accepting a particular interpretation of its meaning.” (Joslin v. H.A.S.
Ins. Brokerage (1986) 184 Cal.App.3d 369, 374.)

The court rejects
Plaintiff’s request for judicial notice as to Exhibits 1 and 7 as they relate
to appellate briefs.  Plaintiff fails to
show that the appellate briefs present facts and proposition not subject to
dispute and not require formal proof. (See Lockley v. Law Office of Cantrell, Green, Pekich, Cruz &
McCort (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 875,
882.) In People v. Reyes (2020) 56 Cal.App.5th 972, the appellate court too notice that
the reply brief had been filed a day late but did not take judicial notice of
the contents of the brief. (Id. at p. 981, fn. 6.) Moreover, Exhibit 13
is not attached to Plaintiff’s request for judicial notice. 
 
Accordingly,
Plaintiff’s request for judicial notice is denied as to Exhibits 1, 7, and 13,
but is otherwise granted.
 
III.      Discussion
 
A.        Failure to Comply with the Meet and
Confer
 
CCP § 439 requires the moving party to meet and confer in person or
by telephone with the party who filed the pleading before filing a motion for
judgment on the pleadings. Defendants’ counsel failed to file a declaration
summarizing the parties' meet and confer efforts. “A determination by the court
that the meet and confer process was insufficient shall not be grounds to grant
or deny the motion for judgment on the pleadings.” (CCP § 439(a)(4).) The court has the
discretion to continue the hearing and order the parties to meaningfully meet
and confer prior to this hearing. (See Dumas v. Los Angeles County Bd.
of Supervisors (2020) 45 Cal. App. 5th 348, 355.)
However, the court will proceed to address the Motion on the merits. 
 
B.        The Notice Requirements of Cal. Code
Regs. § 25903
 
Defendants move for a judgment on the pleadings on the basis
that Plaintiff failed to serve pre-suit Notices of Violation that comply with
Cal. Code Regs. § 25903. 
 
Section 25903(b)(2)(A) provides:  
 
(b)
Contents of Notice.
 
(1)
General Information. Each notice shall include as an attachment a copy of “The
Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986 (Proposition 65): A
Summary” (see Appendix A) prepared by the lead agency. This attachment need not
be included in the copies of notices sent to public enforcement agencies. A
copy of this attachment may be obtained by writing to the Office of
Environmental Health Hazard Assessment at P.O. Box 4010, Sacramento, CA
95812-4010.
 
(2)
Description of Violation. A notice shall provide adequate information from
which to allow the recipient to assess the nature of the alleged violation, as
set forth in this paragraph. The provisions of this paragraph shall not be
interpreted to require more than reasonably clear information, expressed in
terms of common usage and understanding, on each of the indicated topics.
 
(A)
For all notices, the notice shall identify:
 
1. the name,
address, and telephone number of the noticing individual or a responsible
individual within the noticing entity and the name of the entity;
 
2. the name of the alleged violator or violators;
 
3. the approximate time period during which the violation is
alleged to have occurred; and
 
4. the name of each listed chemical involved in the alleged
violation[.]
 
(Ibid. [italics added].) 
 
Defendants assert that Plaintiffs’ Pre-Suit Notices fail to
strictly comply with Proposition 65 because instead of identifying “the name
address, and telephone number . . . [of] a responsible individual within the
noticing entity,” Plaintiff’s provided the contact information of its attorney
Ruben Yeroushalmi as its “designated person” despite Plaintiff’s counsel not
being an individual “within the noticing entity” because he is outside counsel
working for a private firm. (See Cal. Code Regs. § 25903(b)(2)(A)(1).)
 
Plaintiff does not
dispute that the Pre-Suit Notices contained only the contact information of its
counsel. First, Plaintiff asserts Defendants misconstrue the requirement that
the individual be someone “within the noticing entity” to mean that the individual
must specifically be an officer, director, or employee of Plaintiff. While the
court agrees that Defendants fail to cite any statutory language that limits
the noticing individual to an officer, director,  or employee of the noticing party, Plaintiffs
similarly fail to cite case law or any statutory language that would support
the proposition that outside counsel would constitute an individual “within the
noticing entity.” (Cal.
Code Regs., tit. 27, § 25903(b)(2)(A)(1).) Accordingly, the Plaintiffs fail to show that Plaintiff’s
counsel can be considered “a responsible individual within the noticing entity”
sufficient to comply with the requirements of section 25903(b)(2)(A)(1).
 
Second, Plaintiffs argue that Proposition 65’s pre-suit
notice requires only substantial compliance rather than strict compliance.
Defendants assert that because the language of section 25903 is not ambiguous,
the court cannot analyze the purpose of the statute. “‘If
the language is clear, courts must generally follow its plain meaning unless a
literal interpretation would result in absurd consequences the Legislature did
not intend. If the statutory language permits more than one reasonable
interpretation, courts may consider other aids, such as the statute's purpose,
legislative history, and public policy.’” (Meda v. Autozone, Inc.
(2022) 81 Cal.App.5th 366, 378.) 
 
Section 25903(b)(2)(A)(1) requires the pre-suit notice to
include the contact information of either “the noticing individual or a
responsible individual within the noticing entity.” Defendants fail to explain
why Plaintiffs’ counsel cannot be “the noticing individual” whose contact
information is provided in the pre-suit notices. Defendants maintain that in
drafting Proposition 65’s notice requirement, as codified in section 25903, the
Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) intended the information
provided to be that the party giving notice, not their attorney, to allow the
parties to contact the noticing party directly to resolve the issue. (Defendants’
RJN Ex. 8 at p. 3; Plaintiff’s RJN Ex. 3 at p. 3.) Accordingly, there is
ambiguity as to whether the “noticing individual” can be the noticing party’s
attorney or outside counsel and the court can analyze the statute’s purpose and
history. 
 
Defendants’ request for judicial notice Exhibit 8 and
Plaintiffs’ Request for judicial notice Exhibit 3 pertains to the OEHHA’s
Final Statement of Reasons to Adopt Section 12903 Notices of Violation into the
California Code of Regulations (“FSOR”), published on May 14, 1997.[1] According
to OEHHA’s FSOR: 
 
Proposition 65’s notice provision appears to be modeled
generally after similar ‘citizen suit/60- day notice’ provisions of certain
federal environmental laws, such as the Clean Water Act. (See 33 U.S.C. §
1365(b)(1)(A).) 
 
(Defendants’ RJN Ex. 8 at p. 3;
Plaintiff’s RJN Ex. 3 at p. 3.) OEHHA’s FSOR cited Public
Interest Research Group of New Jersey, Inc. v. Hercules, Inc.
(3d Cir. 1995) 50 F.3d 1239, 1249,  in which the Third Circuit stated: 
 
In
deciding whether to initiate an enforcement action, the EPA and the state must
be provided with enough information to enable them intelligently to decide
whether to do so. At the same time, the alleged violator must be provided with
enough information to be able to bring itself into compliance. We will judge
the sufficiency of the plaintiffs' 60–day notice letter in terms of whether it
accomplishes these purposes.
 
(See Defendants’ RJN Ex. 8 at p. 3;
Plaintiff’s RJN Ex. 3 at p. 3.) The Third Circuit rejected the argument that
the 60-Day Notice requirement under the Clean Water Act required strict
compliance with the contents of the notice. The Third Circuit noted: 
 
The
regulation does not require that the citizen identify every detail of a
violation. Rather, it states that ‘[n]otice regarding an alleged violation ...
shall include sufficient information to permit the recipient to
identify’ the components of an alleged violation. 40 C.F.R. §
135.3(a) (emphasis added).
 
We
read the regulation to require just what it says: that the citizen provide
enough information to enable the recipient, i.e.,
Hercules, EPA and/or the State, to identify the specific effluent discharge
limitation which has been violated, including the parameter violated, the date
of the violation, the outfall at which it occurred, and the person or persons
involved.
 
(Public Interest Research Group of New
Jersey, Inc., supra,  (3d Cir. 1995)
50 F.3d at pp. 1247–1248.)
 
The Ninth Circuit has similarly construed
the requirements of the Clean Water Act to require substantial compliance
rather than strict compliance with the notice requirements. “However, in recent
years some courts have taken a more liberal interpretation of the notice
requirements.” (Community Ass'n for Restoration of the
Environment v. Henry Bosma Dairy (9th Cir. 2002) 305 F.3d 943, 950;
see also Natural Resources Defense Council v. Southwest Marine, Inc.
(9th Cir. 2000) 236 F.3d 985, 997.)
 
California courts have similarly found
Proposition 65’s notice requirements are analogous to those of the Clean Water
Act and The Clean Air Act: 
 
It
is likely that the framers of Proposition
65 were aware of the analogous federal
authorities, and intended the same construction to be placed upon the
provisions similar to those found in the federal Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act. We thus conclude that the framers of
the initiative intended that the notice contain sufficient facts to facilitate and encourage the alleged polluter
to comply with the law, and to encourage the public attorney charged with
enforcement to undertake its duty.


(Yeroushalmi v. Miramar Sheraton (2001) 88 Cal.App.4th 738, 750 [italics added].)
 
In Sciortino v. Pepsico, Inc.
(N.D. Cal. 2015) 108 F.Supp.3d 780, the federal district court noted: 
 
California
courts have compared the Proposition 65 notice provisions to the notice
provisions in environmental statutes, such as the Resource Conservation and
Recovery Act, the Clean Water Act, and the Clean Air Act, which serve ‘to
encourage public enforcement, thereby avoiding the need for a private lawsuit
altogether, and to encourage resolution of disputes outside the courts.’
[Citation.] The Proposition 65 notice requirements ‘reflect the
same intent to further settlement and public enforcement by requiring adequate
information from which to allow the recipient to assess the nature of the
alleged violation.’ [Citations]
 
(Id. at pp. 788-789 [italics
added].) 
 
Like the Clean Water Act, Proposition
65’s notice requirement seeks strict compliance with the requirement to provide
notice, but as illustrated above, the contents of 60-Day Notice itself are not
strictly construed and notice is deemed sufficient if there is substantial
compliance and provides sufficient notice to the offending entity. 
 
Given that the contents of the 60-day
notice are not strictly construed, the court finds that Plaintiff substantially
complied with the 60-day notice requirement by providing the contact
information of its counsel. “[A] attorneys are agents of their client[.]” (Rosenaur v. Scherer (2001) 88 Cal.App.4th 260, 283.) As
the Plaintiff’s notice identified the person who sent the notice and provided a
means to communicate with that person, there was substantial compliance.
Moreover, the court is not persuaded that the fact Plaintiff provided the
contact information of its attorney rather than an individual within Plaintiff’s
organization, hindered Defendants’ ability to investigate and cure the
alleged violation(s). 
C.        Issue
Preclusion
 
“Collateral estoppel, or issue
preclusion, precludes relitigation of issues argued and decided in prior
proceedings.” (Mycogen Corp. v. Monsanto Co.
(2002) 28 Cal.4th 888, 889.)  “Issue preclusion
prohibits the relitigation of issues argued and decided in a previous case,
even if the second suit raises different causes of action. [Citation.] 
Under issue preclusion, the prior judgment conclusively resolves an issue
actually litigated and determined in the first action. [Citation.] There
is a limit to the reach of issue preclusion, however. In accordance with due
process, it can be asserted only against a party to the first lawsuit, or one
in privity with a party. [Citation.]” (DKN Holdings LLC, supra,
61 Cal.4th at p. 824 [italics original].) “Issue preclusion differs from claim
preclusion in two ways. First, issue preclusion does not bar entire causes of
action. Instead, it prevents relitigation of previously decided issues. Second,
unlike claim preclusion, issue preclusion can be raised by one who was not a
party or privy in the first suit.” (Ibid.) 
 
Defendants assert that issue preclusion
applies because prior trial cases have already addressed the issue of whether
section 25903(b)(2)(A)(1) requires strict compliance. (See Defendants’ RJN Ex.
12, 13, 14, 16.) The court agrees that when an environmental group brings a
suit on behalf the public and do not have an individual property right in the
action, the group can be found to be in privity with other environmental groups
for purposes of issue preclusion. (See Consumer Advocacy Group, Inc.
v. ExxonMobil Corp. (2008) 168 Cal.App.4th 675, p. 689-693 [finding
environmental group was in privity with a different environmental group that
settled the prior action against the same defendant, when the group did not
have an individual property right in the suit and was vindicating the public's
rights].) However, the court disagrees that issue preclusion applies. 
 
Plaintiff cites other cases wherein other
trial courts have found that substantial compliance is sufficient. (Plaintiffs’
RJN Ex. 2, 6, 12.) Accordingly, there is a split as to whether section
25903(b)(2)(A)(1) requires strict compliance. Moreover, Defendants fail to show
that the item or product at issue in the pre-suite notices in this action,
seaweed containing cadmium, concerned the items and products in the other suits
against Defendants. (Defendants’ RJN Ex. 1, 2.) Therefore, the court is not
persuaded that the issues presented in this action are identical to the issues
litigated in the other actions such that issue preclusion applies. 
 
The Motion is denied. 
 
Conclusion
 Defendants’ MJOP is denied. Defendants to
give notice.
