And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion for judgment on the pleadings by the defendant, Mercedes-Benz USA LLC, against the plaintiffs, Caitlyn McGlthen and Cardiaz McGlothen, regarding a cause of action for negligent repair. The defendant argues that the claim is barred by the economic loss rule, which states that a purchaser of a product can only recover in contract and not tort, unless the purchaser can demonstrate harm above and beyond a broken contractual promise.

The judge agrees with the defendant that the allegations in the complaint only amount to economic loss and do not state any duty independent of the contractual warranties. The plaintiffs allege that the defendant failed to properly repair a defect in a 2021 Mercedes A Class, but do not claim any damages independent of the economic loss from the alleged inadequate repairs.

The judge grants the motion for judgment on the pleadings, but gives the plaintiffs 10 days to amend their complaint. The judge notes that further facts would be required to establish an independent duty and a cause of action for negligent repair.
