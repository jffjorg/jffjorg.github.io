And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion to strike certain allegations from the Second Amended Complaint filed by Plaintiff Sandra Butler against Defendants Hollywood Park Management Company, LLC, Stadco LA, LLC, and Pincay RE, LLC. The motion is based on the argument that the allegations do not rise to the level of "despicable conduct" necessary for punitive damages. The judge notes that the Plaintiff has failed to allege sufficient facts to state a claim for punitive damages and that the allegations do not meet the heightened level of "despicable conduct" required for punitive damages.

The judge also finds that the Plaintiff has failed to allege a basis for attorneys' fees, as she has not alleged a contract or statute entitling her to such fees. The judge grants the motion to strike and allows leave to amend at a time when the Defendants intend to respond to the Plaintiff's discovery.

The judge's tentative ruling is to strike the references to punitive damages and attorneys' fees from the Second Amended Complaint, but allows the Plaintiff to amend the complaint at a later date. The judge notes that the Plaintiff has failed to provide sufficient information about the relationship between the security guard and the Defendants, and that the allegations of knowledge of prior accidents do not rise to the level of punitive damages culpability.
