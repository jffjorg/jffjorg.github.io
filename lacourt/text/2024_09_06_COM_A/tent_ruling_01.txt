  Case Number:  23CMCV01022    Hearing Date:   September 6, 2024    Dept:  A 23CMCV01022
 City of Compton v. Rose Buds on Rosecrans, Ruben Servin
 

Thursday, August 9, 2024 

 
RECOMMENDATION:
CONTINUE HEARING ON PLAINTIFF’S REQUEST FOR COURT JUDGMENT 
 
       
       The complaint alleges that Defendants
were unlawfully operating an unlicensed marijuana dispensary on the real
property at issue. Plaintiff alleges claims for abatement, injunction,
equitable relief, and civil penalties. The court entered default against Rose
Buds on Rosecrans (“Rose”) and Rubin Servin (“Servin”), on February 6, 2024,
and against Defendant Henry Halimi on May 1, 2024. Defendant Sam Ostayan and
all DOE defendants have been dismissed. Plaintiff seeks judgment for civil
penalties against Rosebuds and Servin only, leaving Halimi as the remaining
Defendant, although Halimi is in default.
       Plaintiff must submit a dismissal of all parties against whom
judgment is not sought or an application for separate judgment against
specified parties under Code of Civil Procedure section 579, supported by a
showing of grounds for each judgment. (Cal
Rules of Court 3.1800
(7).) Plaintiff has not explained why a
separate judgment is appropriate in this case. 
       Plaintiff
seeks civil penalties for the second through fourth causes of action for public
nuisance and violations of the Compton Municipal Code. While Plaintiff argues
that a permanent injunction is required to prohibit Defendants from continuing
their unlawful activities, the proposed judgment does not provide for an
injunction.
       Plaintiff
requests civil penalties for the following violations:
1.     
Health & Saf. Code, § 11581 for perpetrating a nuisance
$25,000.00.
2.     
Compton
Municipal Code Chapter 9-24, for prohibiting commercial marijuana activity in
the City. Civil penalties of $1,000 maximum per
violation and $1,000 for every day any violation continues, which will be
considered a separate offense. (CMC §§ 1-6.2, 1-6.4.) 

3.     
Compton
Municipal Code section 30-33 for failure to obtain a certificate of occupancy.
(CMC §§ 30-33.) Penalties for a violation of Compton Municipal Code 30-33 are
found in Compton Municipal Code section 30-40(a) which provides $1,000 maximum
per violation and $1,000 for every day any violation continues. (CMC §§30-33,
30-40.) Compton Municipal Code section 1-6.2 allows for any misdemeanor
violation of the Compton Municipal Code to be “redressed by civil action” (CMC
§§ 1-6.2, 1-6.4.)
4.     
Bus. & Prof. Code, § 26001 for engaging in commercial cannabis
activity without a license is subject to a civil penalty of up to three times
the amount of the license fee ($2,500) for each violation not to exceed
$30,000. Each day of violation is a separate violation. (Bus. & Prof. Code, § 26038.)
Civil penalties for the foregoing
violations are calculated as follows.

       The proposed judgment seeks $322,500 in
principal damages, an increase of $3,000, which is not explained. The court
recalculates statutory attorney’s fees of $5,085.00 pursuant to Local Rule
3.214 based on principal damages of $319,500. Costs of $355.66 are established.

       Plaintiff is ordered to either dismiss
Defendant Halimi or explain why a separate judgment against Halimi is
warranted. Plaintiff is to submit a supplemental declaration showing
Plaintiff’s calculations of civil penalties totaling $322,500 as requested. Plaintiff
is also to clarify whether a permanent injunction is being sought which should
be reflected in the proposed order. 
       The court continues the hearing to September
 6, 2024, at 9:30 a.m. in Department A of the Compton Courthouse.
Supplemental evidence and declaration are to be submitted 10 days prior to the
hearing (or earlier.)
