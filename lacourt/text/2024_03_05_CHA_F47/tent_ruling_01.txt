SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises out of a landlord-tenant dispute. On
7/6/23, Plaintiffs Irwin Jacobowitz; Pearl Jacobowitz; Dakota Dusty
Zeigerman-Jacobowitz; Arizona Jacobowitz and Montana Jacobowitz (collectively,
Plaintiffs), representing themselves, filed this action against Defendants Rick
Hawthorne (Hawthorne), Larry Thornton (Thorton) and Valley View Vaulters, Inc.
(Valley View Vaulters) (collectively, Defendants) alleging various causes of
action.  On 7/21/23, Plaintiffs filed the
subject First Amended Complaint against Defendants alleging the following
causes of action: (1) Wrongful Eviction, (2) Breach of Contract, (3) Breach of
Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment, (4) Trespass, (5) Private Nuisance, (6) Aiding and
Abetting Breach of Fiduciary Duty of a Third Party, (7) Constructive Eviction,
(8) Intentional Concealment, (9) Fraudulent Misrepresentation, (10)
Negligence,  (11) Breach of Habitability,
(12) Negligent Misrepresentation, (13) Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress,
(14) Fraud, (15) Oppression, (16) Malice, (17) Failure to Return Security
Deposit, (18) Punitive Damages, (19) Treble Damages and (20) Negligent
Infliction of Emotional Distress.
 
On 8/25/23, Defendants filed and served a special motion
to strike which sought an order, pursuant to CCP 425.16, striking the 1st
– 4th, 6th – 10th, 13th – 16th
and 18th – 20th causes of action in Plaintiffs’
First Amended Complaint.  After
Plaintiffs failed to respond to meet and confer efforts, on the same date,
Defendants filed and served the instant demurrer to the 1st – 6th,
8th – 9th, 12th – 20th causes of
action.  On 9/29/23, Plaintiffs filed a
combined opposition to the special motion to strike and the instant
demurrer.   
 
On 2/7/23, the Court granted Defendants special motion to
strike which eliminated the 1st – 4th, 6th –
10th, 13th – 16th and 18th – 20th
causes of action.  (See 2/7/24
Minute Order; 2/9/24 Notice of Ruling). 
On 2/26/24, Defendants filed a reply to the opposition regarding the
demurrer.
 
Due to the granting of the
special motion to strike, the Court finds the demurrer as to the 1st,
2nd, 3rd, 4th, 6th, 8th,
9th, 10th, 13th, 14th, 15th,
16th, 18th, 19th and 20th causes of
action to be moot.  As such, this ruling
will only address the merits of the 5th, 12th and 17th
causes of action addressed in the demurrer. 


 
ANALYSIS
 
5th Cause of Action – Private Nuisance
 
A private nuisance is a non-trespassory interference with
the private use and enjoyment of land.  See
San Diego Gas & Electric Co. (1996) 13 C4th 893, 938 citing Civil
Code 3479-3481. Unreasonable, substantial actual damage, meaning a real and
appreciable invasion of the plaintiff’s interests, is a required element of a
private nuisance claim.  Id.  
 
Plaintiffs have failed to plead sufficient facts to
support a finding that Hawthorne, the only defendant named in the 5th
cause of action, unreasonably caused an appreciable invasion of Plaintiffs’
interests, especially considering that Defendants, through the ruling on the
special motion to strike, have prevailed on Plaintiffs’ claims for wrongful
eviction, breach of contract, breach of quiet enjoyment, trespass, constructive
eviction and negligence.
 
12th Cause of Action – Negligent
Misrepresentation 
 
The elements of a negligent misrepresentation cause of
action are: (1) defendant represented to plaintiff that a fact was true; (2)
defendant’s representation was not true; (3) defendant had no reasonable
grounds for believing the representation was true when defendant made it; (4)
defendant intended that plaintiff rely on this representation; (5) plaintiff reasonably
relied on defendant’s representation; (6) plaintiff was harmed; and (7)
plaintiff’s reliance on defendant’s   representation was a substantial factor in
causing plaintiff’s harm.  See CACI
1903.
 
Plaintiffs have failed to allege sufficient facts to
support the fourth, fifth and seventh elements of the cause of action as
against Thornton, the only defendant named in the negligent misrepresentation
cause of action.
 
17th Cause of Action – Failure to Return
Security Deposit
 
Civil Code 1950.5(d) provides, in relevant part, “[a]ny
security shall be held by the landlord for the tenant who is party to the lease
or agreement.”  Here, Plaintiffs allege
that the lease agreement was between “Rick Hawthorne and the VOA.”  (FAC ¶66). 
Additionally, Plaintiffs have failed to allege sufficient facts to
establish that Hawthorne, the only defendant against whom the 17th
cause of action is alleged, received money for a security deposit from or on
behalf of Plaintiffs.  Further, the
opposition to the demurrer to this cause of action relies, at least in part, on
an exhibit to the opposition which is not part of the First Amended
Complaint.  (See Opposition,
Ex.D).   
 
CONCLUSION
 
The Court notes that although the reply concedes that the
special motion to strike only “eliminated causes of action numbers 1, 2, 3, 4,
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20,” Defendants then contend that the
“the only causes of action alive in Defendants’ demurrer are the” 5th for
Private Nuisance, 12th cause of action for Negligent
Misrepresentation and 17th cause of action for Failure to Return
Security Deposit.  (See Demurrer,
p.2:11-18).  However, neither the special
motion to strike nor the instant demurrer address/ed the 11th cause
of action for Breach of Habitability which is alleged solely against
Hawthorne.  (See First Amended
Complaint, pp.16-17).  As such, the 11th
cause of action is also “alive” after the granting of the special motion to
strike, but it is not the subject of this demurrer.
 
Due to the granting of Defendants’ special motion to
strike, the demurrer as to the 1st, 2nd, 3rd,
4th, 6th, 8th, 9th, 10th,
13th, 14th, 15th, 16th, 18th,
19th and 20th causes of action is moot.    
 
The demurrer is sustained as to the 5th, 12th
and 17th causes of action. 
Due to the liberal policy of allowing leave to amend, Plaintiffs are
given 30 days leave to amend to try to cure the defects in the 5th,
12th and 17th causes of action.
