  Case Number:  24LBCV00383    Hearing Date:   October 3, 2024    Dept:  S25 BackgroundOn February 23, 2024, Plaintiff filed a complaint against Defendants Baggio Adair Dominguez and Does 1 to 20, alleging negligence. Plaintiff alleges that on June 8, 2022 at approximately 6:00 p.m., on southbound I-405 freeway in Signal Hill, California, Defendant’s vehicle collided with the rear-end of Plaintiff’s vehicle. (Compl., ¶ 8.) On May 29, 2024, Plaintiff’s request for entry of default was entered against Defendant. On August 8, 2024, Defendant filed the instant motion to vacate entry of default. As of September 30, 2024, no opposition has been filed.Legal StandardCode Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b), provides that: “[t]he court may, upon any terms as may be just, relieve a party or his or her legal representative from a judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken against him or her through his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. Application for this relief shall be accompanied by a copy of the answer or other pleading proposed to be filed therein, otherwise the application shall not be granted, and shall be made within a reasonable time, in no case exceeding six months, after the judgment, dismissal, order, or proceeding was taken…. Notwithstanding any other requirements of this section, the court shall, whenever an application for relief is made no more than six months after entry of judgment, is in proper form, and is accompanied by an attorney’s sworn affidavit attesting to his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect, vacate any (1) resulting default entered by the clerk against his or her client, and which will result in entry of a default judgment, or (2) resulting default judgment or dismissal entered against his or her client, unless the court finds that the default or dismissal was not in fact caused by the attorney’s mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b).) Excusable neglect under CCP § 473(b) is an act or omission that might be expected of a reasonably prudent person under similar circumstances. (Zamora v. Clayborn Contracting Group, Inc. (2002) 28 Cal.4th 249, 257-258; Renteria v. Juvenile Justice, Dep't of Corrections & Rehabilitation (2006) 135 Cal.App.4th 903, 910.) “The mislaying of process, forgetfulness, or intentional disregard of service are not ‘mistake, inadvertence, surprise or excusable neglect’ as those terms are used in section 473 of the Code of Civil Procedure, and they do not require a court to set aside a default.” (Price v. Hibbs (1964) 225 Cal.App.2d 209, 217 [citations omitted].)DiscussionDefendant moves to the Court to vacate the default entered against Defendant. With the default judgment request entered on May 29, 2024 and the instant motion filed on August 8, 2024, Defendant states that the instant motion is timely as it falls within the six-month period provided under Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b). Defense counsel asserts that Martinez, Dieterich & Zarcone Legal Group is in-house counsel for Defendant’s insurance carrier, Loya Casualty Insurance Company, and that Defense counsel neglected to ensure that Martinez, Dieterich & Zarcone Legal Group was sufficiently monitoring the present case’s docket to determine if and when the complaint was served on Defendant. (Urbano Decl., ¶¶ 4, 11.) Defense counsel states that due to its own mistake, a default was entered against Defendant. (Urbano Decl., ¶¶ 12, 14, Ex. C [Defendant’s Proposed Answer to the Complaint].)No opposition has been filed.Tentative RulingThe motion is granted pursuant to Code Civ. Proc., § 47(b). Defendant to file his proposed answer within 10 days of the date of this ruling.
