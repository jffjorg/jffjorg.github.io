Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to vacate the entry of default. The defendant's insurance carrier, Loya Casualty Insurance Company, had hired Martinez, Dieterich & Zarcone Legal Group as in-house counsel, but the defense counsel failed to monitor the case docket and did not notice that the complaint had been served on the defendant. As a result, the defendant was unaware of the complaint and did not respond, leading to the entry of default. The judge found that the defense counsel's mistake was excusable under Code Civ. Proc., § 473(b), and granted the motion. The defendant is now required to file its proposed answer within 10 days of the date of this ruling.
