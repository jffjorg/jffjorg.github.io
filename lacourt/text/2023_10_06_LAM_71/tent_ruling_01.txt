Rulings on Motions in Limine




Plaintiff’s Motions





1


Exclude evidence of Court’s prior ruling on motion
  for return of defendant’s business records


The Court will allow evidence of the Plaintiff’s
  obtaining the records, but not of the Court’s order compelling their return.




2


Exclude evidence of Plaintiff’s financial
  condition


Granted. 
  The Court finds the evidence to be irrelevant to the issues presented.




3


Moot


 




4


Exclude evidence of dismissed racial and sexual
  discrimination claims


Denied.  The
  Court finds these relevant to Plaintiff’s credibility.  Also, Plaintiff argues these are relevant
  in opposition to Defendant’s MIL #5 (2:13-15.)




5


None


 




6


Exclude Defense expert, Jonathan Wilson


Denied without prejudice.  The Court finds the proffered testimony to
  be relevant based upon the current status of the case.  The Court also finds Mr. Wilson’s proffered
  foundation sufficient to render the opinions proffered.  




7


Exclude evidence of Plaintiff’s excessive phone
  usage in 2007


Granted. 
  The Court finds the evidence irrelevant, and, even if remotely
  relevant, unduly prejudicial.  




8


Exclude evidence of Plaintiff’s performance issues
  prior to 2016


Granted. 
  The Court finds the evidence irrelevant, and, even if remotely
  relevant, unduly prejudicial.




9


Exclude evidence of Defendant’s not retaliating
  against others who discussed their wages 


Denied.  The
  Court finds the evidence relevant to whether the basis for Defendant’s termination
  was her discussion of her wages. 




10


Exclude evidence of Defendant’s terminating other
  employees for violation of its Confidentiality Policy


Denied.  The
  Court finds the evidence relevant to whether the stated basis for  Defendant’s termination was a pretext.




11


Exclude evidence of cumulative evidence


Denied without prejudice.  Kelly v. New West Fed. Sav. (1996)
  49 Cal.App.4th 659, 670; LASC Local Rule 3.57 (a)(1).

Did the parties reach a stipulation on this issue?




13


Withdrawn


 




14


Exclude evidence from West Hills Medical Center
  and Yuanli Fang


Denied to the extent the records reflect treatment
  for emotional distress issues.  Granted
  as to all other medical evidence.  The
  Court finds the former to be relevant and the latter to be irrelevant, and,
  even if remotely relevant, unduly prejudicial.




15


Exclude evidence of Plaintiff’s cell phone records
  not produced in discovery.


The Court reserves ruling on this motion pending a
  showing of the cell phone records’ relevancy. 
   But Plaintiff will have to make
  a more specific showing that the items were requested but withheld by the
  Defendant.




16


Exclude evidence of Defendant’s no longer using “Spunk”
  after Plaintiff’s termination


Denied.  The
  Court sees no prejudice to Plaintiff by the introduction of evidence that Defendant
  eliminated the program after Plaintiff’s termination, and that the
  termination and the elimination of the program are unrelated.




17


Exclude evidence of irrelevant witnesses


Granted. 
  The Court finds Defendant should have identified the subject
  individuals in response to Plaintiff’s discovery.    




18


Exclude Exhibits 664, 665-673


Granted. 
  The Court finds Defendant should have produced the subject documents
  in response to Plaintiff’s discovery.

Exclude Exhibits 559-601


Granted. 
  The Court finds Defendant should have produced the subject documents
  in response to Plaintiff’s discovery.    





 




Defendant’s Motions





1


Exclude evidence of isolated remarks by non-decision
  makers


Granted. 
  The Court finds the evidence irrelevant, and, even if remotely
  relevant, unduly prejudicial.




2


Exclude evidence of Plaintiff’s being harassed.


Denied for the reasons expressed in Defendant’s
  opposition to Plaintiff’s MIL # 4.




3


Exclude reference to the “Glass Ceiling.”


Denied.  The
  Court sees this as an appropriate argument based on Plaintiff’s allegations. 




4


Exclude evidence of time-barred allegations


Denied.  Evidence
  of events for which a statute of limitations has run may still have probative
  value. (Richards v. CH2M Hill, Inc. (2001) 26 Cal.4th 798, 823.)




5


Exclude evidence of race or national origin
  discrimination.


Denied for the reasons expressed in Defendant’s
  opposition to Plaintiff’s MIL # 4.




6


Exclude evidence of Plaintiff’s prior work
  experience and Education


Denied.  The
  Court finds the evidence relevant to the issue of whether Plaintiff received
  disparate treatment. The Court finds Defendant’s showing of prejudice to be
  minimal. 




7


Exclude references to claims summarily adjudicated


Granted. 
  The Court sees no relevance to references to summarily
  adjudicated claims.  This ruling does
  not preclude the introduction of evidence supporting those claims, however,
  if there is an overlap between the remaining claims and those previously
  disposed of.




8


Exclude evidence excluded by the Court in ruling
  on Defendant’s previous motion for summary judgment


Denied.  If
  there is the appropriate showing, evidence may be admissible even though
  excluded when the Court considered the MSJ. 
  There may be a different showing at trial.  Also, the Court is unclear on what
  Defendant specifically seeks to exclude. 
  (Kelly v. New West Fed. Sav. (1996) 49 Cal.App.4th
  659, 670.)




9


Exclude evidence of a July 24, 2019, e-mail
  between Jason Dizon and Shirin Forootan


The Court reserves ruling on this motion pending a
  showing of the e-mail’s relevance. 




10

Denied.  The
  Court is unclear on what Defendant specifically seeks to exclude.  (Kelly v. New West Fed. Sav. (1996)
  49 Cal.App.4th 659, 670.)




11


Exclude testimony from undisclosed witnesses


Denied.  The
  Court is unclear on what Defendant specifically seeks to exclude.  (Kelly v. New West Fed. Sav. (1996)
  49 Cal.App.4th 659, 670.)




12


Exclude evidence not produced in discovery


Denied.  The
  Court is unclear on what Defendant specifically seeks to exclude.  (Kelly v. New West Fed. Sav. (1996)
  49 Cal.App.4th 659, 670.)




13


Requesting Plaintiff be ordered to make an offer
  of proof before questioning about Defendant’s software systems and Plaintiffs’
  technical tasks

  Court finds the evidence relevant to the issue of whether Plaintiff received
  disparate treatment. The Court finds Defendant’s showing of prejudice to be
  minimal.
