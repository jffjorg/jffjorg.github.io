1.    Richard J. Rosiak’s Motion to
be Relieved as Counsel
On
February 14, 2023, Plaintiffs Mechellet Armelin-Martin (“Armelin-Martin”) and
Perry Martin Jr. (“Martin”) (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) filed this action
against Defendants Kassy Dieujuste (“Dieujuste”), NALM LLC dba Kassy + Company
[erroneously sued as Kassy + Co] (“NALM”), Marquez Home Services (“Home
Services”), Michael Lurence (“Lurence”), and LEI Electrical Contractors (“LEI”)
(collectively, “Defendants”).  On June
15, 2023, Lurence and LEI answered Plaintiffs’ Complaint. On June 21, 2023,
Defendant Lurence dba LEI electrical Contractors, Inc., filed a cross-complaint
(“Lurence Cross-Complaint”) against Plaintiffs alleging three causes of action:
(1) breach of contract, (2) common counts, and (3) fraud.  On July 26, 2023, Plaintiffs answered the
Lurence Cross-Complaint. 
On
September 13, 2023, Lurence’s and LEI’s Counsel, Richard J. Rosiak, filed the
instant Motion to be Relieved as Counsel. 
Trial
is not set. 
 
Legal
Standard
California Rule of Court rule 3.1362 (Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel)
requires (1) notice of motion and motion to be directed to the client (made on
the Notice of Motion and Motion to be Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-051));
(2) a declaration stating in general terms and without compromising the
confidentiality of the attorney-client relationship why a motion under Code of
Civil Procedure section 284(2) is brought instead of filing a consent under
Code of Civil Procedure section 284(1) (made on the Declaration in Support of
Attorney’s Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-052)); (3) service
of the notice of motion and motion and declaration on all other parties who
have appeared in the case; and (4) the proposed order relieving counsel
(prepared on the Order Granting Attorney’s Motion to Be Relieved as
Counsel—Civil form (MC-053)). 
The court has discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw, and such a motion
should be granted provided that there is no prejudice to the client, and it
does not disrupt the orderly process of justice.  (Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21
Cal.App.4th 904, 915.)
 
Discussion
Counsel
has submitted completed MC-051, MC-052 and MC-053 forms. Counsel has provided a
declaration stating there has been a complete breakdown in communication
between counsel and client-attorney client privilege.  Counsel declares his client refuses to
cooperate by voluntarily signing substitutions of attorney for Lurence and his
company LEI.  Counsel has indicated that Lurence
dba LEI was served with copies of the motion papers filed with the declaration
at Lurence’s last known address and confirmed in the last 30 days of filing the
motion that the address is current by telephone.
 
Conclusion
Lurence’s and LEI’s Counsel’s
Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel is granted.
Counsel will be relieved upon
filing proof of service on their client of the Order Granting Attorney’s Motion
to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil (Judicial Council form MC-053).

Moving Party to give notice.
 
2.    Demurrer
           Plaintiffs demur unopposed to Defendant/Cross-Complainant
NALM’s, in pro per, cross-complaint (“NALM Cross-Complaint”) on the
basis the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd causes of action fail to state facts sufficient to
constitute causes of action against them and are unintelligible, and demur to
the 1st cause of action on the basis it cannot be ascertained from the pleading
whether the contract is written, oral, or implied by conduct.  (Notice of Demurrer, pg. 2; C.C.P.
§§430.10(e), (f), (g).)  Plaintiffs also
move to strike portions of the NALM Cross-Complaint.  (Notice of MTS, pg. 2.)  
 
Procedural Background
On February 14, 2023,
Plaintiffs filed their operative Complaint in the instant action.  On April 3, 2023, NALM filed the operative NALM
Cross-Complaint against Plaintiffs alleging three causes of action: (1) breach
of contract, (2) common counts (for work, labor, services and materials
rendered at the special instance and request of defendant and for which
defendant promised to pay plaintiff), and (3) common counts (for open book
account for money due).  
On May 5, 2023, Plaintiffs filed
the instant demurrer and accompanying motion to strike.  Plaintiffs filed a notice of non-opposition on
September 27, 2023.  As of the date of
this hearing, NALM has not filed an opposition.
 
Legal Standard
A demurrer can be used only to challenge defects
that appear on the face of the pleading under attack; or from matters outside
the pleading that are judicially noticeable.  (Blank v. Kirwan
(1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318; Donabedian v. Mercury Ins.
Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994 [citing text].)  A demurrer can be utilized where the
complaint itself is incomplete or discloses some defense that would bar
recovery (e.g., dates pleaded in complaint show statute of limitations has
run).  (Guardian North
Bay, Inc. v. Superior Court (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 963,
971-972; Estate of Moss (2012) 204 Cal.App.4th 521, 535
[citing text]; Alexander v. Exxon Mobil
(2013) 219 Cal.App.4th 1236, 1250 [finding rule inapplicable based on fact
issues re accrual].)
 
Meet and Confer
Before filing a demurrer, the
moving party must meet and confer in person or by telephone with the party who
filed the pleading to attempt to reach an agreement that would resolve the
objections to the pleading and obviate the need for filing the demurrer.  (C.C.P. §430.41.)

Plaintiffs’ counsel filed a
declaration stating that on April 26, 2023, he met and conferred with NALM’s
now-former attorney regarding the issues he raised in a meet and confer letter
sent he sent to NALM’s counsel on April 21, 2023.  (Decl. of Shahriari ¶¶2-3, Exh. A.)  Plaintiffs’ counsel declares NALM’s counsel indicated
that NALM refused to amend the NALM Cross-Complaint to cure its failures to
allege that it was licensed and to allege the specific legal basis (i.e.,
contract or statute) upon which NALM bases its claim for attorneys’ fees in
connection with its third cause of action. 
(Decl. of Shahriari ¶3.)  Plaintiffs’
counsel’s declaration substantially complies with the requirements of §430.41.
 
Summary of Demurrer
In support of their demurrer
to the NALM Cross-Complaint, Plaintiffs argue that because NALM failed to
allege that it was “a duly licensed contractor at all times during the
performance,” it has failed to state its 1st, 2nd and 3rd causes of action.  (Demurrer, pg. 5; see Bus. & Prof.
§ 7031(a).).  Plaintiffs argue that NALM
also improperly seeks to recover damages for construction services that require
a license.  (Demurrer, pg. 5; see
NALM Cross-Complaint, Exh. A.)
 
Failure to State a Cause of Action
1st, 2nd, and 3rd COAs
NALM alleges on or about
February 2022, it agreed to provide project management and designer services to
Cross-Defendants in exchange for compensation. 
(NALM CC ¶BC-1.)  NALM alleges from
May 2022 through August 2022, Cross-Defendants did not pay all invoices for
services rendered and materials purchased as agreed.  (NALM CC ¶BC-2, Exh. A.)  NALM alleges it has performed all obligations
to Cross-Defendants except those obligations NALM was prevented or excused from
performing.  (NALM CC ¶BC-3.)  NALM alleges it suffered proximate damages
caused by Cross-Defendants’ breach of agreement in the amount of $15,545 in
past due invoices for services rendered and materials purchased/delivered to NALM.  (NALM CC ¶BC-4.)
NALM fails to allege it
possessed a Contractors State Licensing Board (“CSLB”) license of any kind.  A “contractor” for the purposes of the licensing
requirements as stated in Business & Professions Code §7026 is “any person
who undertakes to or offers to undertake to, or purports to have the capacity
to undertake to, or submits a bid to, or does himself or herself or by or
through others, construct, alter, repair, add to, subtract from, improve, move,
wreck or demolish any building . . . or other structure.”  (Bus. & Prof. Code §7026.)  Exhibit A of the NALM Cross-Complaint states
the work and services rendered to Plaintiffs include, for example, “[m]ove new
plumbing lines into the bathroom. Add new toilet area copper piping lines for
new toilet locations [as] well as new locations for shower drain and water
lines in master and guest bathroom area,” “[d]oor cost and lumber to build
enclosed structure,” “[b]uild wall ceiling height for guest bathroom” and “[i]nstalling
all insulation in the walls and ceiling area.” 
(NALM CC ¶BC-2, Exh. A.)
The Court grants NALM leave
to amend the NALM Cross-Complaint to allege, if applicable, any such CSLB
licenses it was required to hold in order to perform the work alleged in
Exhibit A.
Accordingly, Plaintiffs’
demurrer to NALM’s 1st, 2nd, and 3rd causes of action is sustained with 20
days leave to amend.
 
Breach of Contract (1st COA)
A cause of action for breach
of contract must allege the following elements: (1) existence of contract; (2) plaintiffs’
performance or excuse for nonperformance; (3) defendants’ breach (or
anticipatory breach); and (4) resulting damage to plaintiff.  (Reichert v. General Insurance Co.
(1968) 68 Cal.2d 822, 830; Hale v. Sharp Healthcare (2010) 183
Cal.App.4th 1373, 1387.)  
Although a written contract
is usually pleaded by alleging its making and attaching a copy which is
incorporated by reference, a written contract can also be pleaded by alleging
the making and the substance of the relevant terms.  (Construction Protective Services, Inc. v.
TIG Specialty Insurance Co. (2002) 29 Cal.4th 189, 198-199; Perry v.
Robertson (1988) 201 Cal.App.3d 333, 341.) “An oral contract may be pleaded
generally as to its effect, because it is rarely possible to allege the exact
words. [Citation.] A demurrer for uncertainty is strictly construed, even where
a complaint is in some respects uncertain, because ambiguities can be clarified
under modern discovery procedures. [Citations.]”  (Khoury v. Maly’s of California, Inc.
(1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.)  That
plaintiff could not allege with specificity the exact terms of the contract
does not preclude statement of a cause of action.  (Id.)
NALM alleges on or about
February 2022, it agreed to provide project management and designer services to
Cross-Defendants in exchange for compensation. 
(NALM CC ¶BC-1.)  NALM alleges
from May 2022 through August 2022, Cross-Defendants did not pay all invoices
for services rendered and materials purchased as agreed.  (NALM CC ¶BC-2, Exh. A.)  NALM alleges it has performed all obligations
to Cross-Defendants except those obligations NALM was prevented or excused from
performing.  (NALM CC ¶BC-3.)  NALM alleges it suffered proximate damages
caused by Cross-Defendants’ breach of agreement in the amount of $15,545 in
past due invoices for services rendered and materials purchased/delivered to NALM.  (NALM CC ¶BC-4.)
NALM fails to allege the
contract at issue is either written, oral, or implied by conduct.  If the contract alleged is written, NALM
fails to attach a written contract or plead the existence of a written contract
by alleging the making and the substance of the relevant terms.  (Construction Protective Services, Inc. v.
TIG Specialty Insurance Co. (2002) 29 Cal.4th 189, 198-199; Perry v.
Robertson (1988) 201 Cal.App.3d 333, 341.) 
If the alleged contract is oral, NALM fails to plead generally as to the
contract’s effect.”  (Khoury, 14
Cal.App.4th at pg. 616.)  
Accordingly, Plaintiffs’
demurrer to NALM’s 1st cause of action for breach of contract is sustained with
20 days leave to amend.
 
Conclusion
Plaintiffs’ demurrer to NALM’s
Cross-Complaint is sustained with 20 days leave to amend as to the 1st,
2nd, and 3rd causes of action.
Moving party to give notice.
 
C.  
Motion to Strike
In light of the Court’s
ruling on the demurrer, Plaintiffs’ motion to strike is denied as moot.
 
D.  
Plaintiffs’ Motion to Compel Kassy Dieujuste’s Deposition
Plaintiffs move unopposed
to compel Dieujuste, in pro per, to appear for
deposition.  (Notice of Motion Depo, pg.
2; C.C.P. §2025.450.)  Plaintiffs also request an award of sanctions
against Dieujuste in the amount of $2,971.65 to pay expenses and costs incurred
on this motion.  (Notice of Motion Depo,
pg. 2; C.C.P. §§2023.010, 2023.030, 2025.450.) 
Having reviewed Plaintiffs’ Motion to
Compel Dieujuste to Attend Deposition, the Court rules as follows.
           On
May 4, 2023, Plaintiffs served a Notice of Deposition on Dieujuste for a
deposition on June 14, 2023.  (Decl. of Shahriari
¶2, Exh. A.)  On June 12, 2023,
Dieujuste’s former attorneys served objections to the notice.  (Decl. of Shahriari ¶3, Exh. B.)  Dieujuste’s objections were untimely, as they
were served only two days before her scheduled deposition.  (See Decl. of Shahriari ¶3, Exh.
B.)   Plaintiffs’ counsel declares that after
Dieujuste’s former counsel was granted a motion to withdraw, he contacted
Dieujuste via email on July 13, 2023, to reschedule the deposition.  (Decl. of Shahriari ¶4, Exh. C.)  Plaintiffs’ counsel declares that he served
the first amended notice of deposition on July 19, 2023, for a deposition scheduled
for August 8, 2023.  (Decl. of Shahriari
¶5, Exh. D.)  On August 4, 2023,
Plaintiff’s counsel emailed Dieujuste to confirm the deposition, to which
Dieujuste replied that she is unable to participate in the deposition until she
obtains proper legal counsel.  (Decl. of
Shahriari ¶6, Exh. E.)  Plaintiffs’
Counsel declares that to date, Dieujuste has not reached out to reschedule her deposition.  (Decl. of Shahriari ¶8.)
           The
Court grants the motion pursuant to C.C.P. §2025.450 and orders Dieujuste to appear for
deposition in 20 days.
Plaintiffs request monetary sanctions
totaling $2,971.00 against Dieujuste. 
The Court awards sanctions pursuant to C.C.P. §2030.290(c) in the amount
of $2,182.50 calculated as follows:
4 hours to prepare instant motion + 0.5 hours to appear at hearing = 4.5
hours  
($485 per hour x 4.5 hours) + $61.65 filing fee = $2,182.50
The sanctions are payable by Plaintiff and her counsel within 20 days of
this order.
Moving Party is to give notice of this ruling. 
 
E.  
Plaintiffs’ Motion to Deem Plaintiffs’ Request for Admissions
(“RFA”) (Set One) Admitted by Kassy Dieujuste
Having reviewed Plaintiffs’ unopposed Motion to Deem Requests for
Admission Admitted by Dieujuste, the Court rules as follows.
           On June 1, 2023, Plaintiffs
served Request for Admissions (“RFA”) (Set One) on Dieujuste’s former counsel.  (Decl. of Shahriari ¶3, Exh. A.)  Plaintiffs granted Dieujuste’s former counsel
an extension on June 26, 2023, to respond to the propounded discovery.  (See Decl. of Shahriari ¶6, Exh. D.)  After Dieujuste’s counsel withdrew from this
case, Plaintiffs’ counsel granted Dieujuste an additional extension until
August 7, 2023, to respond to the RFAs.  (Decl.
of Shahriari ¶8, Exh. E.)   Dieujuste has
failed to provide timely responses.  Plaintiffs
now move for the Court to deem the requests for admission admitted.  
           The Court grants the
motion pursuant to C.C.P. §2033.280 and deems Plaintiffs’ RFA to Dieujuste admitted.
Plaintiffs request monetary sanctions totaling $1,516.65.  
           The Court awards
sanctions pursuant to C.C.P. §2033.280(c) in the amount of $1,759.15,
calculated as follows:
3 hours to prepare instant motion + 0.5 hours to appear at hearing = 3.5
hours  
($485 per hour x 3.5 hours) + $61.65 filing fee = $1,759.15
The sanctions are payable by Dieujuste within 20 days of this order.
Moving Party is to give notice of this ruling. 
 
F.   
Plaintiffs’ Motion to Deem Plaintiffs’ RFA (Set One)
Admitted by NALM LLC
Having reviewed Plaintiffs’ unopposed Motion to Deem Requests for
Admission Admitted by NALM, the Court rules as follows.
           On June 1, 2023,
Plaintiffs served RFA (Set One) on NALM’s former counsel.  (Decl. of Shahriari ¶3, Exh. A.)  Plaintiffs granted NALM’s former counsel an
extension on June 26, 2023, to respond to the propounded discovery.  (See Decl. of Shahriari ¶6, Exh.
D.)  After NALM’s counsel withdrew from
this case, Plaintiffs’ counsel granted NALM an additional extension until
August 7, 2023, to respond to the RFAs. 
(Decl. of Shahriari ¶8, Exh. E.)  
NALM has failed to provide timely responses.  Plaintiffs now move for the Court to deem the
requests for admission admitted.  
           The Court grants the
motion pursuant to C.C.P. §2033.280 and deems Plaintiffs’ RFA to NALM admitted.
Plaintiffs request monetary sanctions totaling $1,516.65.  
           The Court declines to
award sanctions on the motion, as it is substantively identical to the motion
to deem admitted the RFAs to Dieujuste.
Moving Party is to give notice of this ruling.
