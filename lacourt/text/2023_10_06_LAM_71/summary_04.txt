And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling grants the unopposed petition of Alex Tam, a military service member, for relief from financial obligation during his active duty service. Tam is seeking a deferment of his auto loan payments from December 1, 2023, to September 30, 2024, with payments to resume on October 1, 2024. The joint stipulation filed by Tam and PNC Bank, the lender, agrees to grant this relief. The deferment period will not accrue interest or penalties, and Tam must notify PNC Bank if he is released from active duty service before the expected release date. At the end of the deferral period, regular monthly loan payments will resume, and the unpaid balance of the loan will remain unchanged.
