  Case Number:  21STCV38644    Hearing Date:   January 8, 2025    Dept:  74 Johnson v.
Albannai 
Defendant Sahar Albannai’s Motion to
Continue Trial
 
On
October 18, 2024, Defendant filed a motion to continue trial. A party may seek
a continuance of the date set for trial by showing good cause for a
continuance.  (California Rules of Court,
rule 3.1332(b), (c).)  The party must
include supporting declarations and make the motion “as soon as reasonably
practical once the necessity for the continuance is discovered.  (Id. at subsection (b).)
            Defendant
requests a continuance of the January 21, 2025, trial date to provide care for
her ailing parents.  Defendant did not
include any supporting declaration – a deficiency that the Court brought to Defendant’s
attention in October.  (See Minute Order
10/29/24.)  The Court denies Defendant’s
motion to continue the trial date. 
 
CONCLUSION
            The
Court denies Defendant’s Motion to Continue Trial.
            Defendant
to give notice.
