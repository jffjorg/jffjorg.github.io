Here is the English-text summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The court has granted Plaintiff Alfredo Garcia's motion to reassign the judgment back to himself. The judgment was originally entered in favor of Garcia on May 16, 2011, and was assigned to Ex Parte Collection Services, LLC. However, Ex Parte Collection's powers and privileges were suspended due to nonpayment of taxes, and the company has refused to reassign the judgment back to Garcia despite his repeated requests.

The court has found that the relationship between Garcia and Ex Parte Collection is fiduciary in nature, and that Ex Parte Collection has failed to fulfill its duties as assignee. As a result, the court has determined that the prior judgment has been rendered "null and void in effect" since there is no longer a party with the legal right to collect the judgment.

The court has ordered the reassignment of the judgment back to Garcia, citing applicable laws and statutes, including Code of Civil Procedure sections 681.020, 128, 177, and 187.
