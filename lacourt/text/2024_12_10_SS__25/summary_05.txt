And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The plaintiff, Joanne Doram, filed a complaint against Experian Information Solutions, Inc., Trans Union, LLC, and Equifax Information Services, LLC, alleging a single cause of action for violations of the California Consumer Credit Reporting Agencies Act. Trans Union, LLC filed an answer to the complaint, and the plaintiff then filed a demurrer to the answer. The plaintiff also filed a stipulation for electronic service and discovery reservation with Trans Union, LLC.

The judge has reviewed the documents and finds that since Trans Union, LLC has filed its first amended answer, the plaintiff's demurrer to the answer is moot. The judge overrules the demurrer and orders the moving party to give notice.
