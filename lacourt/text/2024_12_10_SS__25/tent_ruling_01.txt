ANALYSIS:
 
I.                   
Background
 
On August 16,
2021, Plaintiff Pamela Sue Clark (“Plaintiff”) filed the instant action against
Defendant Selina G. Salibaba (“Defendant”) and Does 1 through 75, alleging Motor
Vehicle and General Negligence causes of action. 
 
On September 13,
2024, Defendant’s Counsel, Charles May/Tharpe & Howell, LLP (“Counsel”) filed
a Motion to be Relieved as Counsel (“the Motion”). 
 
On October 1,
2024, Plaintiff filed an Opposition, arguing that Counsel made inadequate
efforts to contact Defendant and that permitting withdrawal at this late stage
of the case would cause undue prejudice to Defendant. No Reply was filed.
 
On October 22,
2024, the Court found a few deficiencies with Counsel’s Motion – namely, the
Motion’s proof of service only indicated MC-51 and MC-052 were served on
Plaintiff but not on Defendant, and MC-052 did not properly list the upcoming
hearings on this matter – but otherwise found the Motion to be in compliance
with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362. (10/22/24 Order.) The Court also
found that Counsel demonstrated a reasonable basis for withdrawal, namely the
breakdown in the attorney-client relationship. (Cal. Rules of Professional
Conduct, rule 1.16, subd. (b)(4).) The Court opined the proximity of the trial
date was problematic here, but ultimately continued the Motion to allow Counsel
to correct the defects. (10/22/24 Order.)
 
On November 6,
2024, Counsel filed the instant Amended Motion to be Relieved as Counsel (the “Amended
Motion”) with an accompanying declaration. 

 
No Opposition to
the Amended Motion has been filed.
 
Notably, the
trial in this matter is set for December 19, 2024, just seven court days from
the instant hearing.
 
II.                
Procedural
Issues
 
The Court notes that in the proof of
service for the Amended MC-051 form, “By United States Mail” is demarked as one
of the forms of service but neither the subdivision (1) or (2) below is specified.
 
III.             
Legal
Standard
 
            Code
of Civil Procedure section 284 states that “the attorney in an action…may be
changed at any time before or after judgment or final determination, as
follows: (1) Upon the consent of both client and attorney…; (2) Upon the order
of the court, upon the application of either client or attorney, after notice
from one to the other.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 284; Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362.) “The determination whether to grant or deny a motion to withdraw as
counsel lies within the sound discretion of the trial court.” (Manfredi
& Levine v. Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128, 1133); see Lempert v.
Superior Court (2003) 112 Cal.App.4th 1161, 1173.) 
 
An application
to be relieved as counsel must be made on Judicial Counsel Forms MC-051 (Notice
of Motion and Motion), MC-052 (Declaration), and MC-053 (Proposed Order). (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, subds. (a), (c), (e).) 
 
In addition,
California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362 subsection (d) requires that the notice
of motion and motion, declaration, and proposed order be served on the client
and all other parties who have appeared in the case by personal service,
electronic service, or mail. If the notice is served by electronic service, it
must be accompanied by a declaration stating that the electronic service
address is the client’s current electronic service address. (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1362, subd. (d)(2).) As used in this rule, “current” means: 
 
“[T]he address
was confirmed within 30 days before the filing of the motion to be relieved. 
Merely
demonstrating that the notice was sent to the client’s last known address and
was not returned or no electronic delivery failure message was received is not,
by itself, sufficient to demonstrate that the address is current.” 
 
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362, subd. (d).) 
 
IV.             
Discussion
 
On September 13,
2024, Counsel moved the Court to
relieve him as attorney of record for Defendant. (MC-051.) Counsel filed MC-051, MC-052, and MC-053 Forms
for the Motion and later for the Amended Motion. (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.1362, subds. (a), (c), (e).) Counsel seeks to be relieved due to a breakdown of the
attorney-client relationship (MC-052, ¶ 2.) Counsel states Counsel’s office
made numerous and repeated attempts to contact Defendant from June 3, 2024, to
September 13, 2024 – when the original Motion was filed – to no avail. (MC-052,
¶ 2.) 
 
The Court finds that Counsel have
demonstrated a reasonable basis for withdrawal, namely the breakdown in the
attorney-client relationship. (Cal. Rules of Professional Conduct, rule 1.16,
subd. (b)(4).) The Court also finds the Amended Motion now complies with
California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362.
 
While a change in counsel on the eve
of trial is less than ideal, the Court is unwilling to force an unwanted attorney-client
relationship for trial. 
 
Accordingly, Counsel’s Motion is
GRANTED. 
 
V.               
Conclusion & Order
 
Defendant’s Counsel Charles May/Tharpe
& Howell, LLP’s Motion to be Relieved as Counsel for Defendant is GRANTED.  
 
The Court, on its own motion,
continues the trial date to February 26, 2025 at 8:30 a.m. in Department 25 of Spring Street Courthouse
located at 312 North Spring Street, Los Angeles, California 90012. 
 
Defendant’s Counsel is ordered to give
notice of ruling including notice of continued trial date to Defendant Selina
G. Salibaba.
