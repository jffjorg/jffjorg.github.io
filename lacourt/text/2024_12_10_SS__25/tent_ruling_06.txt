ANALYSIS:
 
I.                   
Background

 
On May 16, 2011, judgment was entered
in this action in favor of Plaintiff and Judgment Creditor Alfredo Garcia
(“Plaintiff”) and against Defendants and Judgment Debtors Yu Ron Chung and
Kyung H. Chung (“Defendants”) in the amount of $4,600. (Motion, p. 3; 5/1/20 Application
For and Renewal of Judgment.) 
 
Subsequently, Plaintiff assigned the
judgment to Ex Parte Collection Services, LLC (“Ex Parte Collection”). (Garcia
Decl., ¶ 2.) 
 
On May 1, 2020, Ex Parte Collection,
claiming to be assignee of record, filed an Application For and Renewal of
Judgment in the amount of $10,209.10, reflecting the $4,600 total judgment, $1,443
for costs after judgment, $4,121.10 interest after judgment, and a $45 filing
fee. (5/1/20 Application For and Renewal of Judgment) 
 
On May 13, 2020, the Court approved Ex
Parte Collection’s Application for and Renewal of Judgment. (5/13/20 Notice of
Renewal of Judgment.) 
 
On October 1, 2020, the California
Secretary of State suspended Ex Parte Collection’s powers and privileges for
nonpayment of taxes to the Franchise Tax Board. (Garcia Decl., ¶ 3, Exhs. 1,
2.)
 
On October 2, 2024, Plaintiff filed
the instant Notice of Motion and Motion for Order Reassigning Judgment Back to Alfredo
Garcia (the “Motion”).
 
No Opposition has been filed. 
 
II.                
Legal
Standard & Discussion
 
Plaintiff
asserts that he filed an “Acknowledgment of Assignment of Judgment” on July 17,
2011 assigning the judgment to Ex Parte Collection and now seeks to reassign
the judgment back to Plaintiff. Plaintiff contends reassignment is necessary
because Ex Parte Collection is now a suspended entity that cannot legally
collect or enforce the judgment on Plaintiff’s behalf and refuses to reassign
the judgment back to Plaintiff despite Plaintiff’s multiple demands. (Motion,
p. 3; Garcia Decl., Exhs. 1, 2, 3.) 
 
Under Code
of Civil Procedure section 681.020, “An assignee of a judgment is not entitled
to enforce the judgment under this title unless an acknowledgment of assignment
of judgment to that assignee has been filed or the assignee has otherwise
become an assignee of record under Section 673.” 
 
The Court’s
records indicate that Plaintiff filed an acknowledgment of assignment of
judgment to Ex Parte Collection in July 2011.
 
Under Code
of Civil Procedure section 128, subdivision (a), “Every court shall have the
power to… compel obedience to its judgments, orders, and process, and to the
orders of a judge out of court, in an action or proceeding pending therein.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 128, subd. (a); see Code Civ. Proc., §§ 177, 187; Yolanda’s,
Inc. v. Kahl & Goveia Comm’l Real Estate (2017) 11 Cal.App.5th 509,
514.)
 
“[T]he
relationship between a collection agency and a judgment creditor is fiduciary
in nature.” (Cross v. Bonded Adjustment Bureau (1996) 48 Cal.App.4th
266, 276 (Cross).) “ ‘An assignment for collection vests legal title in
the assignee which is sufficient to enable him to maintain an action in his own
name, but the assignor retains the equitable interest in the thing assigned….
Such an assignee has been referred to as the trustee or agent of the assignor…,
and a fiduciary relationship exists between them.” (Id., at pp.
276-277.) Such a relationship necessitates an obligation for the collection
agency and judgment creditor to “ ‘act in the highest good faith by reason of
such relationship.’ ” (See id., at p. 276; Wolf v. Superior Court
(2003) 107 Cal.App.4th 25, 29.)
 
            Ultimately, “ ‘[w]hether the defendant breached [a
fiduciary duty] towards the plaintiff is a question of fact.’ ” (Marzec v.
Cal. Public Employees Retirement System (2015) 236 Cal.App.4th 889, 915,
citation omitted.) 
 
Here,
Plaintiff assigned the judgment to Ex Parte Collections and thus created a
fiduciary relationship between them. (See Cross, supra, 48
Cal.App.4th at p. 276.) After assignment, Plaintiff still retained equitable
interest in the judgment, and Ex Parte Collections had a duty to act in the
highest good faith regarding its obligations to Plaintiff given the fiduciary
nature of their relationship. (Id., at pp. 276-277; Wolf, supra,
107 Cal.App.4th at p. 29.) 
 
However,
Plaintiff’s evidence demonstrates that Ex Parte Collections failed to fulfill
its duties as assignee through its suspension by the California Secretary of
State and refusal to respond to Plaintiff’s repeated requests for reassignment.
(Garcia Decl. ¶¶ 3-8,
Exhs. 1-3; see Marzec, supra, 236 Cal.App.4th at p. 915.) Due to these failures, the Court agrees its
prior judgment has been rendered “null and void in effect” since there is now
no party with the legal right to collect the judgment. (Motion, p. 4; Code Civ.
Proc., §§ 126, 177, 187.)  
 
Accordingly,
the Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion and orders reassignment of the judgment
back to Plaintiff. 
 
III.             
Conclusion
& Order
 
Plaintiff Alfredo Garcia’s Motion for
Order Reassigning Judgment is GRANTED.
 
Moving party to give notice.
