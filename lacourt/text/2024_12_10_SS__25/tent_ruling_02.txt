ANALYSIS:
 
I.                   
Background

 
On October 18, 2022, Plaintiff Salvador Duenas
(“Plaintiff”), representing himself, filed an action against Defendant Hovanwil
Inc. dba Jon’s Towing (“Defendant”) and Does 1-25 alleging general negligence.
(Complaint, ¶ 10b.) Plaintiff requested relief for the loss of use of property,
general damage, property damage, and emotional distress. (Complaint, ¶ 11.) 
 
On March 11, 2024, Plaintiff filed a First Amended
Complaint (“FAC”) still alleging general negligence by Defendant and requesting
the same forms of relief as the original Complaint. (FAC, ¶¶ 10-11.)  
 
On August 12, 2024, Defendant filed a Cross Complaint. On
September 16, 2024, Plaintiff filed an Answer to the Cross Complaint.
 
On October 3, 2024, Defendant filed the instant Motion
for Order Establishing Admissions, Genuineness of Documents (“RFAs Motion”), Motion
for Order Compelling Responses to Interrogatories (“FROGs Motion”), and Motion
for Order Compelling Responses to Inspection Demands (“RPDs Motion”) (the
“Motions”). With each Motion, Defendant also requested sanctions.
 
No Opposition has been filed.
 
On October 29, 2024, Defendant filed an Answer to
Plaintiff’s First Amended Complaint.
 
II.                
Legal
Standard 
 
A party must respond to
interrogatories and requests for production of documents within 30 days after
service. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.260, subd. (a), 2031.260, subd. (a).) If a
party to whom interrogatories or requests for production of documents are directed
does not provide timely responses, the requesting party may move for an order
compelling responses to the discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd.
(b), 2031.300, subd. (c).) The party also waives the right to make any
objections, including one based on privilege or work-product protection. (Code
Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (a), 2031.300, subd. (a).) There is no time
limit for a motion to compel responses to interrogatories or production of
documents other than the cut-off on hearing discovery motions 15 days before
trial. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2024.020, subd. (a), 2030.290, 2031.300.) No meet
and confer efforts are required before filing a motion to compel responses to
the discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, 2031.300; Sinaiko Healthcare
Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th
390, 411.)
 
A party must respond to requests for admissions within 30
days after service of such requests. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.250, subd. (a).)
“If a party to whom requests for admission are directed fails to serve a timely
response…(a) [that party] waives any objection to the requests, including one
based on privilege or on the protection for work product…” (Code Civ. Proc., §
2033.280, subd. (a).) “The requesting party may move for an order that the
genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the
requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction under Chapter
7.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).) 

 
Code of Civil Procedure section 94
limits discovery in limited jurisdiction actions to any combination of 35
interrogatories with no subparts, demands to produce documents, and requests
for admission with no subparts. (Code Civ. Proc., § 94, subd. (a).)
 
III.             
Discussion

 
Defendant contends that Plaintiff
failed to timely respond to its first set of Form Interrogatories, Request for Inspections,
and Request for Admissions, on or by the statutory deadline. 
 
            As an
initial matter, the Court notes that Defendant has submitted evidence to the
Court of a total of 35 discovery requests made upon Plaintiff – 14 Form
Interrogatories, nine Requests for Production, and 12 Requests for Admissions.
Thus, the Court finds Defendant in compliance with Code of Civil Procedure
section 94 and addresses the merits of the Motions.
 
Here, Defendant’s counsel served
Plaintiff by mail and email on August 12, 2024 with the first sets of Form
Interrogatories, Inspection Demands, and Requests for Admissions. (FROGs
Hagopian Decl., ¶¶ 2-3, Exhs. A, B; RPDs Hagopian Decl., ¶¶ 2-3, Exhs. A, B; RFAs
Hagopian Decl., ¶¶ 2-3, Exhs. A, B.) As of October 3, 2024, Defendant had not received any response to
the discovery requests. (FROGs Hagopian Decl., ¶ 4; RPDs Hagopian Decl., ¶
4; RFAs Hagopian Decl., ¶
4.) 
 
Thus, Defendant is entitled to an order compelling Plaintiff
to provide responses to its first sets of Form Interrogatories and Inspection
Demands. Defendant is also entitled to an order deeming RFAs and genuineness of
documents admitted. 
 
            Sanctions
 
Sanctions are
mandatory against the party, the attorney, or both whose failure to serve a
timely response to the request necessitated the motion to compel responses or deem
request for admissions as admitted. (See Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290(c),
2031.300(c), 2033.280(c); see also Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1348(a) [the
court can award sanctions under the Discovery Act in favor of a party seeking
to compel discovery even though no opposition was filed, the opposition was
withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party after
the motion was filed].)
 
            Here, Plaintiff
failed to serve a timely response to Defendant’s Interrogatories, Request for
Production, and Request for Admissions by the statutory deadline. Thus,
sanctions are mandatory against Plaintiff. (See Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290(c),
2031.300(c), 2033.280(c); see also Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1348(a).) 
 
            Defendant
requests monetary sanctions of $3,780, based on $1,260 for each motion, reflecting
2 hours incurred on bringing each Motion and 2 hours incurred on drafting a
Reply and attending oral argument for each Motion at an hourly rate of $300.00
per hour, plus the $60 filing fee for each Motion. (RFAs Hagopian Decl., ¶¶ 5-8.)
 
            Given
the similarity of the motions to each other, the shared hearing date, the lack
of Oppositions and Replies, and the straightforward nature of the motions, Defendant’s
request for sanctions against Plaintiff is GRANTED in the reduced amount of $1,380,
reflecting 4 hours incurred at $300 an hour plus $180 in filing fees.
