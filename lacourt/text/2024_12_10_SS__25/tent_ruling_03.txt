ANALYSIS:
 
I.                   
Background

 
On February 14, 2023, Plaintiff Creditors
Adjustment Bureau, Inc. (“Plaintiff”) filed the instant action against
Defendant Forty General Building, Inc. aka 40 General Building (“Defendant”)
and Does 1 through 10, alleging Breach of Contract, Open Book Account, Account
Stated, and Reasonable Value. (Compl., p. 1.)
 
On March 8, 2023, Plaintiff filed a
First Amended Complaint (“FAC”).  
 
On April 16, 2024, the Court granted
Defendant’s Motion to Set Aside/Vacate the Default and ordered both the default
and default judgment against Defendant set aside and vacated. (4/16/24 Order.)
 
On April 17, 2024, Defendant filed an
Answer.
 
On August 15, 2024, the Court granted
Plaintiff’s unopposed Motion to Compel Defendant’s Responses to Plaintiff’s
First Set of Special Interrogatories and Motion to Compel Defendant’s Responses
to Plaintiff’s First Set of Demand for Production and Inspection of Documents
and other Tangible Things and ordered Defendant to serve code compliant
responses to Plaintiff’s Requests within 45 days. (8/15/24 Order.) The Court
also granted Plaintiff’s request for sanctions in the amount of $560.00 per
motion payable within 45 days. (8/15/24 Order.)
 
On October 8, 2024, Plaintiff filed
the instant Motion for Terminating Sanctions and Monetary Sanctions against Defendant
(the “Motion”). 
 
On November 27, 2024, Defendant’s
counsel filed a one-page “Response to Motion for Order for Terminating
Sanctions Against Forty General Building Inc. aka 40 General Building Inc,
Striking Defendant’s Answer and Entering Default; Request for Monetary
Sanctions in the Amount of $1,873.65.”
 
II.                
Legal
Standard & Discussion
 
Plaintiff
moves for terminating sanctions, entering default, and/or striking the Answer against
Defendant as well as monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,873.65 jointly and
severally against Defendant and Defendant’s counsel. (Motion, pp. 1-2.) Plaintiff
alleges Defendant “has willfully refused to properly provide responses despite
the Court’s Order [in August 2024] compelling defendant to do so” and is “blatantly
refusing to fully participate in the litigation process.”  (Motion, pp. 4-5.) Due to Defendant’s failure
to make any effort to comply with the Court’s Order and his continuous refusal
to provide the discovery at issue which is “essential to the prosecution of
this action,” Plaintiff requests the court strike Defendant’s Answer and enter
default. (Motion, pp. 5-6.) Finally, Plaintiff also requests monetary sanctions
in the amount of $1,873.65 be imposed against Defendant and Defendant’s
counsel, jointly and severally, “since defense counsel has not withdrawn as
represented.” (Motion, p. 6.)  
 
In Response,
Defendant’s counsel states: “Defendants are in fact in default of discovery
responses. Defendant’s attorney has been unable to obtain response information
from Defendant.” (Response, p. 1.)
 
On motion, if a party fails to obey an
order compelling responses, testimony, production, and/or inspection “the court
may make those orders that are just, including the imposition of an issue
sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction” as provided in
Section 2030.010, et seq. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (c), 2031.320,
subd. (c).)  The “court, after notice to any affected party, person, or
attorney, and after an opportunity for hearing, may impose” monetary, issue,
evidence, or terminating sanctions “against anyone engaging in conduct that is
a misuse of the discovery process[.]” (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2023.030; 2023.030,
subds. (a)-(d).) Failing to respond or submit to an authorized method of
discovery and disobeying a court order to provide discovery are misuses of the
discovery process.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subds. (d) and (g).) 
 
The court should look to the totality of
the circumstances in determining whether terminating sanctions are appropriate.
(Lang v. Hochman (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 1225, 1246.) Ultimate discovery
sanctions are justified where there is a “willful” discovery order violation
“preceded by a history of abuse,” and evidence showing that “less severe
sanctions would not produce compliance with discovery rules.” (Van Sickle v.
Gilbert (2011) 196 Cal.App.4th 1495, 1516.) “[A] penalty as severe as
dismissal or default is not authorized where noncompliance with discovery is
caused by an inability to comply rather than willfulness or bad faith.” (Brown
v. Superior Court (1986) 180 Cal.App.3d 701, 707.) 
 
“The court may impose a terminating
sanction by one of the following orders:  
 
(1)   An order striking out the pleadings or
parts of the pleadings of any party engaging in the misuse of the discovery
process. 
(2)   An order staying further proceedings by
that party until an order for discovery is obeyed. 
(3)   An order dismissing the action, or any
part of the action, of that party. 
(4)   An order rendering a judgment by default
against that party.” 
 
(Code Civ. Proc., §
2023.030, subd. (d).) 
 
With this
Motion, Plaintiff contends Defendant has continued to fail to comply with the
Court’s discovery orders from August 15, 2024, including the payment of
sanctions. (Motion, Freed Decl., ¶ 7.) Defendant’s counsel’s Response does not prove otherwise, and no
Opposition has been filed to date despite Plaintiff’s proper service of the
Notice of Ruling on Defendant. (See Response; Motion,
Freed Decl., ¶ 6, Exh. I; 8/23/24 Notice of Ruling Proof of Service.) 
 
Plaintiff is entitled to sanctions based on
Defendant’s repeated failure to comply with discovery obligations. However, terminating
sanctions are a harsh penalty, and the above evidence does not demonstrate that
Defendant’s compliance cannot be achieved through lesser sanctions. (See
Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 771, 793-794 [“The sanction of
dismissal or the rendition of a default judgment against the disobedient party
is ordinarily a drastic measure which should be employed with
caution. [Citation.] However, there is no question that a court is
empowered to apply the ultimate sanction against a litigant who persists in the
outright refusal to comply with his discovery obligations. [Citation.] The
refusal to reveal material evidence is deemed to be an admission that the claim
or defense is without merit. [Citations]”].)  However, “[t]he
court [is] not required to allow a pattern of abuse to continue ad infinitum.”
(Mileikowsky v. Tenet Healthsystem (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 262,
280.) 
 
Accordingly, the Court GRANTS the Motion in Part
and CONTINUES in Part.  The Court GRANTS
the monetary sanctions in the reduced amount of $750 as against Defendant Forty
General Building, Inc. only, payable within 30 days of this order.  Furthermore, the Court CONTINUES the Motion
As to Terminating Sanctions Against Forty General Building, Inc., Striking
Defendant’s Answer and Entering Default to ______________________ .  Moving party is ordered to meet and confer
with Defendant’s counsel prior to the next hearing via telephone and file a
brief statement of efforts to meet and confer 5 days prior to next hearing.
 
Moving party is ordered to give notice of ruling.
