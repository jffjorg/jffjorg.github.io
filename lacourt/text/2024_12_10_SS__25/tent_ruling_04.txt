ANALYSIS:
 
I.                   
Background

 
On August 18, 2023,
Plaintiff State Farm Mutual Automobile
Insurance Company (“Plaintiff”) filed an action against Defendants
Lizbeth Vidal and Juan Vidal Illescas aka Juan Vidal (“Defendants”) and Does
1-10 alleging Subrogation. (Compl., p. 2.) Defendants, representing themselves,
filed an Answer on September 18, 2023. 
 
Two discovery motions are presently
before the Court. On June 13, 2024, Plaintiff filed two Motions for Requests be
Deemed Admitted (“RFAs”), one against each Defendant. Plaintiff requests an
award of monetary sanctions against Defendants in the total amount of $920,
reflecting $460 per motion. Plaintiff also submits on the moving papers for
both motions without an appearance. (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1304(c).) 
 
No Oppositions were filed. 
 
On October 29, 2024, the Court
continued the hearing on the Motions from November 5, 2024 to December 10, 2024
due to the Court’s unavailability and calendar congestion. (10/29/24 Order.)
 
II.                
Discussion

 
A.   
Request for Admissions 
 
A party must respond to requests for
admissions within 30 days after service of such requests. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2033.250, subd. (a).) “If a party to whom requests for admission are directed
fails to serve a timely response…(a) [that party] waives any objection to the
requests, including one based on privilege or on the protection for work
product…” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (a).) “The requesting party may
move for an order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any
matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary
sanction under Chapter 7.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).)  
 
Motion as to Defendant Lizbeth Vidal
 
Plaintiff contends that Lizbeth Vidal failed
to timely respond to its RFAs on or by the statutory deadline. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.250, subd. (a).) Plaintiff’s counsel’s office served Lizbeth
Vidal with the RFAs by mail on April 25, 2024. (Espinosa Decl., ¶ 1, Exh. A.)
The deadline for Lizbeth Vidal to respond was June 7, 2024. 
 
As of the date this Motion was filed, June
13, 2024, Plaintiff had not received any responses. (Motion, p. 1.) The Court
notes that Plaintiff’s counsel’s declaration on June 6, 2024 stating Plaintiff
had yet to receive responses from Lizbeth Vidal was one day early to the
statutory deadline.
 
Thus, Plaintiff is entitled to an
order deeming RFAs admitted. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280.)
 
            Motion
as to Defendant Juan Vidal 
 
Plaintiff contends that Juan failed to
timely respond to its RFAs on or by the statutory deadline. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2033.250, subd. (a).) Plaintiff’s counsel’s office served Juan Vidal with the
RFAs by mail on April 25, 2024. (Espinosa Decl., ¶ 1, Exh. A.) The deadline for
Juan Vidal to respond was June 7, 2024. 
 
As of the date this Motion was filed, June
13, 2024, Plaintiff had not received any responses. (Motion, p. 1.) The Court
notes that Plaintiff’s counsel’s declaration on June 6, 2024 stating Plaintiff
had yet to receive responses from Juan was one day early to the statutory
deadline.
 
Thus, Plaintiff is entitled to an
order deeming RFAs admitted. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280.)
 
B.     Sanctions
 
Sanctions are
mandatory against the party, the attorney, or both whose failure to serve a
timely response to the request necessitated the motion to deem request for
admissions as admitted. (See Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2033.250(a), 2033.280(c); see
also Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1348(a) [the court can award sanctions under
the Discovery Act in favor of a party seeking to compel discovery even though
no opposition was filed, the opposition was withdrawn, or the requested
discovery was provided to the moving party after the motion was filed].)
 
Here, Defendants failed to serve a
timely response to Plaintiff’s RFAs by the statutory deadline. Thus, sanctions
are mandatory against Defendants, “whose failure to serve a timely
response to the request necessitated the motion to deem request for admissions
as admitted. (See Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2033.250(a), 2033.280(c); see also Cal.
Rules of Court, Rule 3.1348(a).)
 
Plaintiff
requests monetary sanctions of $920.00,
based on $460.00 for each motion, reflecting 2 hours incurred on bringing each
Motion at an hourly rate of $200.00 per hour, plus the $60 filing fee for each
motion. (Espinosa Decl. for Lizbeth RFAs, ¶ 3;
Espinosa Decl. for Juan RFAs, ¶ 3.)
 
In view of the similarity of the
motions to each other, the Court finds that the total and reasonable amount of
attorney’s fees and costs incurred for the work performed in connection with
the pending motions against Defendants is $580, reflecting 2 hours incurred at
$200 an hour plus $120 in filing fees.
 
Plaintiff’s
requests for monetary sanctions against Defendants are GRANTED in the reduced total
amount of $580.

Insurance Company’s unopposed Motions to Deem Request for

reduced total amount of $580.
