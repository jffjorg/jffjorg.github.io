Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's unopposed motions to deem requests for admissions admitted as to both defendants, Lizbeth Vidal and Juan Vidal. The plaintiff had filed two motions to deem requests for admissions admitted, one against each defendant, and had requested monetary sanctions in the total amount of $920. The defendants failed to timely respond to the requests for admissions, and the plaintiff is entitled to an order deeming the requests for admissions admitted.

The judge has also granted the plaintiff's requests for monetary sanctions against the defendants in the reduced total amount of $580. The sanctions are mandatory against the defendants, whose failure to serve a timely response to the requests necessitated the motion to deem the requests for admissions admitted.

The judge notes that the plaintiff's counsel's declaration stating that the plaintiff had yet to receive responses from the defendants was one day early to the statutory deadline. The judge finds that the total and reasonable amount of attorney's fees and costs incurred for the work performed in connection with the pending motions against the defendants is $580, reflecting 2 hours incurred at $200 an hour plus $120 in filing fees.
