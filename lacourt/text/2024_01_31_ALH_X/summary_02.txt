  - "To obtain a preliminary injunction, a plaintiff ordinarily is required to present evidence of the irreparable injury or interim harm that it will suffer if an injunction is not issued pending an adjudication of the merits."

And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling denies the cross-complainant's motion for a preliminary injunction, which sought to order the plaintiffs to remove equipment attached to a wall that the cross-complainant claims encroaches on her property. The cross-complainant argued that she would suffer irreparable harm if the equipment is not removed, including being hindered in her $1 million renovation project and having to obtain new or extended permits. However, the court found that the cross-complainant had not demonstrated that the right to a mandatory injunction is clearly established, and that the harm to the plaintiffs would be speculative and not stated with specificity. The court also noted that the cross-complainant's motion seeks extraordinary relief that goes to the direct issues underpinning both the complaint and the cross-complaint, but that the cross-complainant has not demonstrated a likelihood of prevailing on the merits at trial.
