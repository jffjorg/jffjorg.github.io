MOTION TO ADVANCE THE HEARING ON ITS MOTION
FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT¿ 
Hearing Date: 7/1/24¿¿ 
CASE NO./NAME: 23STCV16153 DANIELA SCHMIDT vs
MIZAN AND MONIRA BHUIYAN, et al.
Moving Party: Plaintiff
Responding Party: Unopposed 
Notice: Sufficient¿¿ 
Ruling: MOTION TO ADVANCE THE HEARING ON ITS
MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT IS DENIED, BUT, ALTERNATIVE RELIEF IS GRANTED. 
 
On July 11, 2023, Plaintiff, in
pro per, filed the present case. On May 8, 2024, Plaintiff filed her motion for
summary judgment (MSJ) with a hearing date set for January 7, 2025. The trial
date is currently set for January 7, 2025. Defendant moves the Court to advance
the MSJ hearing date to 30 days before the trial date of January 7, 2025. No
opposition was filed. 
 
The Court’s
calendar is congested. Plaintiff was unable to secure a hearing date earlier
than the trial date because, as stated in its motion, the earliest available
date for the Court to hear the motion was February 6, 2025. However, allowing
Plaintiff’s MSJ to be heard 30 days before trial constitutes good cause for the
Court to continue the trial date. 
 
Accordingly, the Court hereby
continues the trial to March 3, 2025 at 8:30
am, and FSC is set for _____, 2025 at 10:00 am. Fact discovery will not
follow the new trial date; should the parties elect to have fact discovery
follow the new trial date, a stipulation to do so must be filed, or, in the event
the parties do not so agree, a motion for that purpose must be filed and
granted. 
 
PLEASE TAKE NOTICE: 
 
If a party intends to submit on
this tentative ruling,¿the party must send an email to the court at¿sscdept27@lacourt.org¿with the Subject line “SUBMIT”

Unless¿all¿parties submit by email to this
tentative ruling, the parties should arrange to appear remotely (encouraged) or
in person for oral argument.¿You should assume that others may appear at the hearing
to argue.
 
If the parties neither submit nor
appear at hearing, the Court may take the motion off calendar or adopt the
tentative ruling as the order of the Court.¿After the Court has issued a
tentative ruling, the Court may prohibit the withdrawal of the subject motion
