And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion for relief from default judgment filed by defendants Leo's Trucking Service, Inc. and Felipe Gonzalez. The defendants argued that they did not receive actual notice of the lawsuit and that their lack of notice was not caused by inexcusable neglect. However, the judge found that the defendants failed to meet their initial burden of showing that they did not have actual notice of the case or that the lack of notice was not due to inexcusable neglect. The judge also found that the defendants did not provide sufficient evidence to show that they did not live at the address where they were served with the summons and complaint. As a result, the judge denied the motion for relief from default judgment.
