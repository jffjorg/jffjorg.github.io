And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motions to compel initial responses to requests for production, to deem requests for admissions admitted, and to request sanctions. The motions were filed by the plaintiff, Susana Delgado, et al., against the defendant, Martin Carrillo-Morales.

The judge finds that the motions are timely, despite the defendant's argument that they are untimely. The judge also finds that the defendant received actual notice of the motions and that the email address used for service was incorrect, but that the defendant's counsel has declared that they did not receive an email from the plaintiff relating to the motion.

The judge notes that the defendant's responses to the requests for admissions were untimely and that the defendant's responses to the requests for production contained only objections. The judge orders the defendant to respond to the requests for admissions and production within 10 court days and to provide complete and verified responses without objections.

The judge also orders the defendant to pay sanctions in the amount of $1,500 to the plaintiff for failing to provide timely responses and for opposing the motions. The judge finds that the defendant failed to successfully oppose the motions and that sanctions are therefore mandatory.

The parties are instructed to submit to the tentative ruling by email to the court by the hearing date, and if they do not submit, they should arrange to appear remotely or in person for oral argument.
