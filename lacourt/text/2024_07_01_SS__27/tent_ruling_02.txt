Legal Standard
A defendant may make a demand for
inspection, copying, testing, or sampling without leave of court at any time. Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.020, subd. (a); Code
Civ. Proc., § 2030.020, subd. (a).) A plaintiff may
make a demand for production of documents and propound interrogatories without
leave of court at any time 10 days after the service of the summons on, or
appearance by, the party to whom the demand is directed, whichever occurs
first. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.020, subd. (b); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.020,
subd. (b).) The demand for production of documents is not limited by number,
but the request must comply with the formatting requirements in Code Civ.
Proc., § 2031.030. A party may propound 35 specially prepared
interrogatories that are relevant to the subject matter of the pending action
and any additional number of official form interrogatories that are relevant to
the subject matter of the pending action. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.030, subd.
(a)(1) - (a)(2).)¿¿¿ 
¿¿ 
The party whom the request is
propounded upon is required to respond within 30 days after service of a
demand, but the parties are allowed to informally agree to an extension and
confirm any such agreement in writing. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260, subd. (a);
Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.270, subd. (a)
- (b); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.270, subd. (a) - (b).)¿¿¿ 
¿¿ 
If a party fails to timely respond
to a request for production or interrogatories, the party to whom the request
is directed waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings under
Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.230, and waives any objection, including one based on
privilege or on the protection for work product. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300,
subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).)¿¿The party propounding the
discovery requests may move for an order compelling responses. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (b); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (b).) Unlike a motion to compel further discovery responses, a
motion to compel initial discovery responses does not have any meet and confer
requirements.¿ 
¿ 
Code of Civil Procedure section
2023.030, subdivision (a) provides, in pertinent part, that the court may
impose a monetary sanction on a party engaging in the misuse of the discovery
process to pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by
anyone as a result of that conduct. A misuse of the discovery process includes
failing to respond or submit to an authorized method of discovery. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (d).)¿¿¿A court has discretion to fix the amount of reasonable
monetary sanctions. (Cornerstone Realty Advisors, LLC v. Summit Healthcare
Reit, Inc. (2020) 56 Cal.App.5th 771, 791.)¿¿¿¿¿

Discussion
 
On March 21, 2024, Defendant Hotel
Saddleback served its Form Interrogatories, Set Two, and Requests for Admissions,
Set One, on Plaintiff Craig Wright. The responses were due on April 25, 2024.
However, as of May 23, 2024, when the present motions were filed, no responses
were provided. No opposition was filed. 
 
On March 11, 2024, the Court
granted Plaintiff’s counsel's motion to be relieved as counsel. As of today,
Plaintiff is appearing in pro per.
 
It is undisputed that Plaintiff
did not serve timely initial discovery responses. Plaintiff did not file an
opposition or any other filing indicating that the responses were served prior
to the hearing. Thus, the present motions are GRANTED. Defendant’s RFA, Set
One, are deemed admitted and Plaintiff is ORDERED to submit complete and verified
discovery responses to Defendant’s Form Interrogatories, Set Two, without
objections within 30 days from today. 
 
Sanctions
 
Defendant requests sanctions in
the amount of $742.50 for each motion. The court finds the amount reasonable.
Sanctions are mandatory and the court does not find Plaintiff to have acted
with substantial justification.
 
Consequently, the Court sanctions Plaintiff
in the amount of $1400. Plaintiff to pay sanctions of $1400 to Defendant within
30 days of today’s date.
