Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication regarding the plaintiffs' claims. The judge found that the defendant has not met its burden of showing that the plaintiffs' claims for breach of express warranty, breach of implied warranty, and violation of the Song-Beverly Act have no merit. Specifically, the judge found that the defendant failed to show that the subject vehicle is not a new motor vehicle and that the plaintiffs do not have standing to assert their claims. The judge also denied the defendant's request for summary adjudication regarding the issue of whether the plaintiffs may not claim as "damages" at any trial what they paid for an optional, non-GM service contract.
