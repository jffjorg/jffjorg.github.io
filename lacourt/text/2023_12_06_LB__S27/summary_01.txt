And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to quash the deposition subpoenas for production of business records. The motion was filed by Plaintiff Erikka Bailey, who alleges that the subpoenas are overbroad, harassing, and violate her right to privacy. Defendant Yen Wei Pan opposes the motion, arguing that the subpoenas are necessary to obtain medical and billing records to evaluate the source of Plaintiff's claimed injuries and damages.

The Court finds that Plaintiff has an expectation and right of privacy in her medical records, and that Defendant has not met its burden in showing how the medical records and billing records sought by the Subpoenas are protected by the attorney-client privilege. The Court also agrees with Plaintiff that California Insurance Code, Section 791.13 prevents disclosure of all the documents requested in the Subpoenas.

Therefore, the Court grants the motion and quashes the Subpoenas in their entirety.
