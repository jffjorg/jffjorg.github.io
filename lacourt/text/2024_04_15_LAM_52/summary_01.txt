English-text summary:

The tentative ruling grants plaintiff Perry Lazar's motion to compel the deposition of Mark Wardle, an employee of cross-defendant First American Title Company. The court finds that First American's objections to the notice of deposition are invalid, and that deposing Mark Wardle will not cause unwarranted annoyance, embarrassment, or oppression, or undue burden or expense. The court also denies First American's motion for a protective order. The court orders First American to produce Mark Wardle to testify at deposition within 25 days. The court also denies plaintiff's request for $5,011.65 in sanctions against First American and its counsel, finding that First American acted with substantial justification in opposing the deposition.
