And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel further responses to discovery requests filed by Plaintiff Faith Strongheart against Defendant Nonfiction Unlimited Inc. The motion was filed because Defendant failed to produce responsive documents in a code-compliant manner and failed to verify its responses to discovery requests.

The judge finds that Plaintiff engaged in reasonable and good-faith attempts to resolve the dispute through informal means, but Defendant did not respond adequately. The judge also finds that Defendant's responses to discovery requests were inadequate and did not comply with the Discovery Act.

The judge grants Plaintiff's motion to compel further responses and orders Defendant to serve verified and code-compliant responses to the discovery requests within 30 days. The judge also orders Defendant to identify all responsive documents or things and/or permit Plaintiff to inspect such documents within 30 days.

Additionally, the judge imposes monetary sanctions on Defendant in the amount of $2774.00, which represents four hours of attorney time to prepare the moving and reply papers, and attend the hearing, at $675 per hour, plus the motion filing fee of $74.
