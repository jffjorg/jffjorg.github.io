And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case where the Plaintiff is seeking monetary sanctions against the Defendant's counsel. However, the Judge finds that the Plaintiff's notice of motion fails to identify the Defendant's counsel, which is a procedural defect. The Judge is citing a California Practice Guide and two earlier court cases to support the decision. The Judge is requiring the Plaintiff to correct this defect before the case can proceed.
