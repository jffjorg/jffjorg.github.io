BACKGROUND
 
Cross-Complainant BFF Construction, Inc. (“BFF”) filed a
cross-complaint against Cross-Defendants Peter McNulty (“McNulty”), Nanette
James (“James”), Landry Design Group, Inc. (“LDG”), Richard Landry (“Landry”),
and Todd Riley (“Riley”) alleging causes of action for (1) breach of contract;
(2) fraudulent inducement; (3) negligent interference with contract, and (4)
negligence.  The first two causes of
action for breach of contract and fraudulent inducement are alleged only as to
James and McNulty, while the third and fourth causes of action are alleged only
as to the LDG, Landry, and Riley.
 
BFF was the general contractor for a home construction project for
owners McNulty and James.  LDG was the
architectural firm for the project, owned by Landry, and Riley is partner at
LDG.
 
Cross-Defendants LDG, Landry, and Riley (“Cross-Defendants”) now move
for summary judgment and/or summary adjudication as to the third and fourth
causes of action as follows:
 
Issue 1:  Cross-Defendants are
entitled to a judgment in their favor on the third cause of action for
negligence [sic] interference with contract and the fourth cause of action for
negligence in the operative Cross-Complaint because both causes of action are
barred by the two (2) year statute of limitations set forth in Code of Civil
Procedure section 339.
 
Issue 2: Cross-Defendants are entitled to judgment in their favor on
the third cause of action for negligence [sic] interference with contract and
the fourth cause of action for negligence in the operative Cross-Complaint
because they did not have a legal duty to compensate BFF for its work on the
project.
 
 BFF opposes the motion and Cross-Defendants
reply.
 
LEGAL STANDARDS – SUMMARY JUDGMENT/ADJUDICATION

 
“[T]he party moving for
summary judgment bears the burden of persuasion that there is no triable issue
of material fact and that he is entitled to judgment as a matter of law[.]
There is a triable issue of material fact if, and only if, the evidence would
allow a reasonable trier of fact to find the underlying fact in favor of the
party opposing the motion in accordance with the applicable standard of proof.”
 (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 850.)
 “[T]he party moving for summary judgment bears an initial burden of
production to make a prima facie showing of the nonexistence of any triable
issue of material fact; if he carries his burden of production, he causes a
shift, and the opposing party is then subjected to a burden
of production of his own to make a prima facie showing of the existence of a
triable issue of material fact.”  (Ibid.)  
 
“On a summary judgment
motion, the court must therefore consider what inferences favoring the opposing
party a factfinder could reasonably draw from the evidence. While viewing the
evidence in this manner, the court must bear in mind that its primary function
is to identify issues rather than to determine issues.  Only when the inferences are indisputable may
the court decide the issues as a matter of law. If the evidence is in conflict,
the factual issues must be resolved by trial.” 
(Binder v. Aetna Life Ins. Co. (1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 832, 839
[cleaned up].)  Further, “the trial court
may not weigh the evidence in the manner of a factfinder to determine whose
version is more likely true.  Nor may the
trial court grant summary judgment based on the court's evaluation of
credibility.”  (Id. at p. 840
[cleaned up]; see also Weiss v. People ex rel. Department of Transportation
(2020) 9 Cal.5th 840, 864 [“Courts deciding motions for summary judgment or
summary adjudication may not weigh the evidence but must instead view it in the
light most favorable to the opposing party and draw all reasonable inferences
in favor of that party”].)  
 
A party may move for
summary adjudication as to one or more causes of action, affirmative defenses,
claims for damages, or issues of duty if that party contends that there is no
merit to the cause of action, defense, or claim for damages, or if the party
contends that there is no duty owed.  (See Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (f)(1).)  “A motion for summary adjudication shall be
granted only if it completely disposes of a cause of action, an affirmative
defense, a claim for damages, or an issue of duty.”  (Ibid.)  A cause of action has no merit if: (1) one or
more elements of the cause of action cannot be separately established, even if
that element is separately pleaded, or (2) a defendant establishes an
affirmative defense to that cause of action. 
(See Code Civ. Proc., §
437c, subd. (n); Union Bank v. Superior
Court (1995) 31 Cal.App.4th 573, 583.) 
Once the defendant has shown that a cause of action has no merit, the
burden shifts to the plaintiff to show that a triable issue of material fact
exists as to that cause of action.  (See Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (o)(2); Union Bank v. Superior Court, supra, 31 Cal.App.4th at p. 583.)  
 
EVIDENTIARY OBJECTIONS
 
            The Court rules as follows with respect to BFF’s
evidentiary objections:
 
1.      Sustained
2.      Overruled
3.      Overruled
4.      Overruled
5.      Overruled
6.      Overruled
            
DISCUSSION
 
A.    ISSUE 1: STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS 
 

BFF’s third and fourth causes
of action for negligent interference with contract and negligence both sound in
negligence.  The statute of limitations
for negligence is two years.  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 335.1.)  
 
Emergency Rule 9 tolled the applicable
statute of limitations for 178 days from April 6, 2020 to October 1, 2020,
meaning BFF’s claim must have accrued on or after April 23, 2019, which is two
years and 178 days prior to October 18, 2021, when BFF filed its original
cross-complaint.
 
            Cross-Defendants’
Evidence
 
Cross-Defendants argue that
the statute of limitations accrued by January 21, 2016, when the change order
regarding modifications to the foundation, which was caused by LDG’s “subpar”
architectural plans, put BFF on notice that the project would be delayed and
BFF would incur additional expenses. 
Alternatively, BFF knew by August 2017, the original completion date for
the project, that completion of the project was delayed, and BFF was incurring
additional expenses.  
 
In support, BFF has provided
the following evidence:
 
·        
The
contract between BFF and the owners called for a fixed fee and a fixed amount
of time (20 months), from the date the permit issued, but specified that if the
contract exceeded those 20 months, an additional $25,000 per month would be
due.  (Ex. 5 [contract]; Ex. 16 [Fata
Depo] at pp. 40:13-18; 68:9-17.)
 
·        
The
permit issued on December 9, 2015, making the original completion date in
August 2017 (Ex. 16 [Fata Depo] at pp. 76:5-17; 103:13-20.)
 
·        
BFF’s
profit would decrease slightly the longer the project went on, even with the
additional $25,000 per month.  (Ex. 16 [Fata
Depo] at pp. 69:5-17; 73:2-6.)
 
·        
The January
21, 2016 change order put BFF on notice that a defect in LDG’s foundation plan
delayed completion of the project by one month and increased construction costs
by $26,170.00.  (Ex. 13 [change order]; Ex.
16 [Fata Depo] at p. 90:7-17)
 
·        
In March
2016 BFF encountered foundational problems caused by the “subpar” architectural
plans not matching (Ex. 16 [Fata Depo] at pp. 43:6-12; 88:2-18.)
 
·        
BFF was
aware when it issued the foundation change order that the project would be
delayed (Ex. 16 [Fata Depo] at pp. 43:19-44:3; 46:7-14.)
 
·        
As of
April 25, 2016, BFF was aware that Landry’s “subpar plans” for elevations in
the basement would cause further delay. 
(Ex. 16 [Fata Depo] at p. 102:10-14.)
 
·        
The
owners paid approximately an additional $100,000 in additional monthly fees
beyond the original 20 months, but around September or October of 2019,
communications broke down between BFF and the owners with regard to the
outstanding balance owed.  (Ex. 16 [Fata
Depo] at pp. 118:21-119:1.)
 
·        
Due to
the owners’ financial situation, BFF was invoicing the owners for partial
amounts and accepting partial payments once the project went over the original
20 months.  (Ex. 16 [Fata Depo] at p.
124:1-12.)
 
·        
The
project was not completed until April 2019. 
(Ex. 16 [Fata Depo] at pp. 113:21-114:4.)
 
An action does not accrue when the damages
are nominal or the existence of damages are speculative or illusory.  (Walker v. Pacific Indem. Co. (1960)
183 Cal.App.2d 513, 517.)  But “once
plaintiff has suffered actual and appreciable harm, neither the speculative nor
uncertain character of damages nor the difficulty of proof will toll the period
of limitation.”  (Davies v. Krasna
(1975) 14 Cal.3d 502, 514.)
 
Here, while BFF may have known it would
suffer nominal damages by virtue of the delay, it was not clear that the owners
would not ultimately pay BFF most of the additional charges until September or
October of 2019, when communications with the owners broke down.  Therefore, cross-defendants have not met
their burdens of production and persuasion in establishing that the statute of
limitations had run prior to BFF filing the original cross-complaint.
 
B.    
ISSUE 2: DUTY
 
Cross-Defendants’ argument that they owed no duty of care to BFF is
duplicative of their arguments on demurrer, which the Court already rejected:
 
Factors to consider in determining whether Landry
Cross-Defendants owed a duty of care are (1) the extent to which the
transaction was intended to affect BFF, (2) the foreseeability of harm to BFF,
(3) the degree of certainty that BFF suffered injury, (4) the closeness of the
connection between Landry Cross-Defendants’ conduct and the injury suffered,
(5) the moral blame attached to Landry Cross-Defendants’ conduct, and (6) the
policy of preventing future harm. (Biakanja v. Irving (1958) 49 Cal.2d 647, 650.)

 
An architect, in his or her capacity as an
independent contractor, may be sued for negligence in the preparations of plans
and specifications. Such a suit may be brought either by the client or third
parties. [Huber, Hunt & Nichols, Inc. v. Moore, 67 Cal. App. 3d 278, 136
Cal. Rptr. 603 (5th Dist. 1977); see also Mallow v. Tucker, Sadler &
Bennett, Architects & Engineers, Inc., 245 Cal. App. 2d 700, 54 Cal. Rptr.
174 (4th Dist. 1966) (liability for failure to delineate on plans location of buried
high voltage lines despite possessing means of doing so); But see Civ. Code §
2782.8, effective Jan. 1, 2018, which promulgates that design professionals are
no longer exposed to unlimited liability with respect to the duty to indemnify
and the cost to defend. Cal. Civ. Code § 2782.8 (West) Rather, a design
professional's cost of defending an indemnitee is limited to that party's
proportionate percentage of fault.] 
 
Liability exists because an architect is under a
duty to exercise ordinary care in the course of work for the protection of any
person who foreseeably and with reasonable certainty may be injured by a
failure to do so, even though such an injury may occur after the work has been
accepted by the person engaging the architect's services. [Montijo v. Swift,
219 Cal. App. 2d 351, 33 Cal. Rptr. 133 (4th Dist. 1963)] Thus, when an
architect prepares plans and specifications in a careless and negligent manner and
a third person within the area of foreseeable risk is injured or his or her
property damaged as a result of the defective design, the third person can
recover damages from the architect. [Peak v. Richmond Elementary Sch. Dist.,
161 Cal. App. 2d 366, 326 P.2d 860 (1st Dist. 1958)] Liability may be imposed
for negligent design where no supervisory responsibilities are involved.
[Mallow v. Tucker, Sadler & Bennett, Architects & Engineers, Inc., 245
Cal. App. 2d 700, 54 Cal. Rptr. 174 (4th Dist. 1966)] 
 
Foreseeable third parties to whom an architect
owes a duty may include contractors [Huber, Hunt & Nichols, Inc. v. Moore,
67 Cal. App. 3d 278, 136 Cal. Rptr. 603 (5th Dist. 1977)], purchasers of
buildings designed by the architects [Cooper v. Jevne, 56 Cal. App. 3d 860, 128
Cal. Rptr. 724 (2d Dist. 1976); Beacon Residential Community Ass'n v. Skidmore,
Owings & Merrill LLP, 59 Cal. 4th 568, 173 Cal. Rptr. 3d 752, 327 P.3d 850
(2014)], lenders [U. S. Fin. v. Sullivan, 37 Cal. App. 3d 5, 112 Cal. Rptr. 18
(4th Dist. 1974)], and adjoining landowners [Peak v. Richmond Elementary Sch.
Dist., 161 Cal. App. 2d 366, 326 P.2d 860 (1st Dist. 1958)]. An architect's
liability extends to economic loss as well as bodily injury. [Cooper v. Jevne,
56 Cal. App. 3d 860, 128 Cal. Rptr. 724 (2d Dist. 1976) (liability for economic
losses of subsequent purchasers exists even where there is no physical injury
or property damage)] 
 
(Cal. Civ. Prac. Torts (Nov. 2021 Update) §
34:24. Liability for defective plans and specifications.)  
 
The Court finds that BFF’s allegations are
sufficient. According to the allegations, (1) the transaction, i.e., the
construction of the Property was intended to affect BFF; (2) the harm to BFF,
i.e., delays in construction and lack of compensation for the delays, was
foreseeable to BFF because the construction was dependent on Landry
Cross-Defendants’ plans; (3) BFF did in fact suffer injury because it was not
adequately compensated by Cross-Defendants Peter McNulty and Nanette James; and
(4) Landry Cross-Defendants’ conduct in failing to make timely plans and
subsequently changing the plans is closely tied to the harm suffered by BFF.
Additionally, given the foreseeability of harm, moral blame may be attached to
Landry Cross-Defendants’ conduct to prevent future harm.
 
(April
12, 2022 Minute Order.)
 
            The evidence Cross-Defendants have
provided similarly demonstrates (1) the transaction was intended to benefit BFF
(through the construction fees); (2) harm to BFF due to delays and lack of
compensation by the owners was foreseeable because the construction was
dependent on Cross-Defendants’ architectural plans; (3) BFF suffered injury
because it was not adequately compensated by McNulty and James; and (4)
Cross-Defendants’ “subpar” architectural plans are closely related to BFF’s
resulting harm.  
 
            Thus, Cross-Defendants have not met
their burdens of production and persuasion that it did not owe BFF a duty of
care.
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER 
 
For the reasons stated above,
the Court denies Cross-Defendants’ motion for summary judgment and/or
adjudication in its entirety.  
 
Cross-Defendants shall give
notice of the Court’s ruling, and to file a proof of service of such.
