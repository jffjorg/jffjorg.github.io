Respondent: NO OPPOSITION
TENTATIVE RULING
Plaintiff Direct ChassisLink Inc.’s Application for
Default Judgment is GRANTED.
BACKGROUND
On December
6, 2023, Plaintiff Direct ChassisLink Inc. (DCLI) filed a complaint against Defendant
White Mountain Trucking Inc. (White Mountain Trucking) and Does 1-20, alleging
the following causes of action: (1) reasonable value, (2) account stated, (3)
open book account, and (4) unjust enrichment. On December 14, 2023, DCLI’s
process server served White Mountain Trucking with substitute service in El
Monte.
On
February 1, 2024, the Court entered default against White Mountain Trucking
after they failed to file a timely answer. On the same day, DCLI submitted the
present application for default judgment.
A case
management conference is set for May 21, 2024.
LEGAL STANDARD
Code
of Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a
party has filed to timely respond or appear.  A party seeking judgment on
the default by the court must file a Request for Court Judgment, and: (1) a
brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other admissible evidence in
support of the judgment requested; (3) interest computations as necessary; (4)
a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) a proposed form of judgment; (6) a
dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application
for separate judgment under CCP § 579, supported by a showing of grounds for
each judgment; (7) exhibits as necessary; and (8) a request for attorneys’ fees
if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.  (Cal. Rules of
Court 3.1800.)
ANALYSIS
DCLI
seeks default judgment against White Mountain Trucking in the total amount of $70,021.16,
including $67,101.26 in damages, $1,170.00 in interest, $1,200 in attorney
fees, and $549.90 in costs. Because the Court finds DCLI has submitted
sufficient evidence, the Court GRANTS DCLI’s application for default judgment.
CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, DCLI’s
application for default judgment is GRANTED.
