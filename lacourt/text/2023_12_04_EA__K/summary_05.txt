And here is a summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on Antonio Fernandez's application for default judgment. The ruling denies the application without prejudice, citing two defects. Firstly, the plaintiff is requested to resubmit its attorney's fees request in compliance with Local Rule 3.214. Secondly, the plaintiff's Memorandum of Costs seeks $200.00 in "investigator fees" but fails to provide any authority entitling it to such fees. The case involves a complaint filed by the plaintiff, alleging that Pit Stop Liquor Mart, owned by Pit Stop Liquor Mart Inc., violated the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) by having non-compliant conditions at its store in El Monte, California. The plaintiff is seeking damages and attorney's fees under the Unruh Civil Rights Act and the California Disabled Persons Act. The case is set for a Case Management Conference on August 24, 2023.
