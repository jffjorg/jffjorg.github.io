 Case Number:  22PSCV00691    Hearing Date:   December 4, 2023    Dept:  K Plaintiff
The
Buddhist Association of the United States’ Application for Default Judgment is DENIED without prejudice.
Background   
Plaintiff The Buddhist Association of the United States (“New
York BAUS”) alleges as follows:
New York BAUS was formed in 1964 and is
a New York non-profit corporation located in Carmel, New York. New York BAUS
was granted tax exempt status by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) in 1965.
New York BAUS owns, manages and operates a large Buddhist monastery in Carmel,
as well as a temple in the Bronx, offers a wide range of programs and has an
extensive Internet presence through its website www.baus.org.
New York BAUS also has active, registered trademarks for “Buddhist Association
of the United States” and for its Chinese name. Defendant The Buddhist
Association of the United States (“California BAUS”) was incorporated in
California on May 10, 2005. In early 2018, the IRS communicated with New York
BAUS about a change of address to a location in El Monte; it was at this time
that New York BAUS learned that California BAUS was using the BAUS name and was
also using New York BAUS’s federal EIN number for tax purposes, without its
consent. California BAUS, Zhong Lin Sun (“Sun”), Zengkui Li (“Li”), Ke You Han
(“Han”) and Chan De (“De”) (together, “Defendants”) have also used New York
BAUS’s name, trademarks and other information without its consent. 
On July 8, 2022, New York BAUS filed a complaint, asserting
causes of action against California BAUS, Sun, Li, Han and De for:
1.                 
Conversion
2.                 
Fraud 
3.                 
Federal Trademark Infringement Under 15 U.S.C. §
1114(1)
4.                 
Common Law Trademark Infringement 
5.                 
Unfair Competition Under California Business &
Professions Code § 17200 et seq.
6.                 
False Designation of Origin, False Advertising, and
Unfair Competition Under 15 U.S.C. § 1125
7.                 
California Common Law Unfair Competition
On November 7, 2022, an “Order for Service by Publication of
Summons” was filed as to Sun, Li, Han and De; on December 9, 2022, proof of
publication was filed.
On March 22, 2023, California BAUS’s, Sun’s, Han’s, Li’s and
De’s defaults were entered.
An Order to Show Cause is set for December 4, 2023.
Discussion
Plaintiff’s Application for Default Judgment is denied without
prejudice. The following defects are noted:
1.                 
Plaintiff has failed to submit updated Judicial Council
CIV-100 forms with the instant default prove-up application. Plaintiff’s
default prove-up application submitted March 22, 2023 indicated that a total
judgment of $7,646,910.00 (comprised of $7,600,000.00 in special damages,
$3,695.00 in costs and $43,215.00 in attorney’s fees) against California BAUS,
Sun, Han, Li and De. The proposed default judgment submitted August 18, 2023
reflects that Plaintiff now seeks a total judgment of $7,673,894.07 against the
aforesaid defendants (comprised of $7,600,000.00 in damages, $6,229.07 in costs
and $67,665.00 in attorney’s fees). Any further default prove-up application
must be full and complete. The court will not accept any piecemeal submissions.
2.                 
Plaintiff concurrently filed “Statement[s] of Damages
and Punitive Damages[1]” against
each of the defendants with the July 8, 2022 filing of its complaint. On July
20, 2022, Plaintiff filed a proof of substituted service as to California BAUS
which does not indicate that California BAUS was served with a “Statement of
Damages and Punitive Damages” at that time. (See also Menshivoka
Decl., ¶ 3, Exh. 2.) Plaintiff’s counsel Anastasiya Menshivoka
(“Menshivoka”) represents that California BAUS’s registered agent, Zhon Lin
Sun, was subsequently served with a “Statement of Damages and Punitive Damages”
on August 16, 2023 (Id., ¶ 7, Exh. 8), which is after default had
been entered against California BAUS on March 22, 2023. The individual
defendants were each served via publication. The proofs of publication do not
indicate that the individual defendants were served with “Statement[s] of
Damages and Punitive Damages” at that time. (Id., ¶ 4, Exh. 4.) Menshivoka
represents that “Plaintiff also ran publications of the statements of damages
for all Defendants in English in The Daily Journal and in Mandarin in The
World Journal,” that “[t]he English publication ran for 5 weeks from July
19, 2023 until August 23, 2023” and that “[t]he Mandarin version of the
statements of damages was first published on August 14, 2023 and will run until
September 25, 2023.” (Id., ¶ 7; see also, Exh. 7). A statement
prescribed by Code of Civil Procedure § 425.115, subdivision (b), however, must
be served “upon the defendant pursuant to this section before a default
may be taken, if the motion for default judgment includes a request for
punitive damages.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 425.115, subd. (f) [emphasis added].)
3.                 
Exhibit 6 consists of an English translation only. The
original Chinese document must be included and authenticated.
4.                 
15 U.S.C. § 1117, subdivision (c)(1) allows for an
award of statutory damages for the use of a counterfeit mark “in connection
with the sale, offering for sale, or distribution of goods or services” in the
amount of “not less than $1,000 or more than $200,000 for counterfeit mark per
type of goods or services sold, offered for sale, or distributed, as the court
considers just.” Plaintiff identifies seven uses of Plaintiff’s trademarks by
defendants, but does not explain what “type of goods or services” were “sold, offered for
sale, or distributed” on those occasions. Plaintiff is requested to brief this
issue for the court.
