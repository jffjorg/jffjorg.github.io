Discussion
Plaintiff’s Application for Default Judgment is denied without
prejudice. The following defects are noted:
1.                 
Plaintiff purports to assert FEHA claims, yet has
failed to provide the court with any information establishing that she was part
of a protected class or that she engaged in any protected conduct under FEHA.
Plaintiff has alleged that “she suffered a work-related injury which resulted
in a disability” (Complaint, ¶ 50). This statement, however, is nowhere set
forth or explained in Plaintiff’s declaration. Paragraph 25 of the complaint
also recites that Government Code § 12940 prohibits employers from
discriminating on the basis of disability, yet Plaintiff has not attested that
she is disabled.
2.                 
Plaintiff seeks $221,280 in damages, which is comprised
as follows: $53.760.00 in back pay, plus $96 in unpaid wages, plus $3,840.00 in
waiting time penalties, plus $163,584.00 in non-economic, emotional distress
damages. Plaintiff has now attached text messages between Plaintiff and her
supervisor, Paul Pino (“Pino”). Plaintiff appears to contend that she was not
paid for her full work hours on 12/3-7/18, and 12/10/23 and that this resulted
in a total of 6 unpaid work hours.[1]
Plaintiff texted Pino that on 12/3-5/18 she “did 12-4pm and 5-8pm from home
total of 8 hours,” that on 12/6/18 she worked “12pm-4pm[,] 5pm-8:30pm-home
total of 8 hrs and 30 min[,]” that on 12/7/18 she worked “12pm-4pm[,]
5pm-8pm-home total of 8” and that on 12/10/18 she “worked 12pm-4pm and 5pm-8pm
from home. Should only be short 5min.” It is unclear to the court how Plaintiff
was shorted. With respect to the 12/3/18-12/5/18 dates, 12-4 pm is 4 hours and
5-8 pm is 3 hours for a total of 7, not 8 hours. As to 12/6/18, 12-4pm is again
4 hours and 5-8:30pm is 7.5 hours, not 8.5 hours. Finally, as to 12/10/18, 12-4
pm is 4 hours and 5-8 pm is 3 hours for a total of 7, not 8 hours. Pino
apparently took a screenshot of Plaintiff’s hours from 12/3/18-12/14/18 and
forwarded this to Plaintiff. (Plaintiff Decl., ¶ 7, Exh. A, p. 4). Plaintiff is
requested to explain to the court how the screenshot is inaccurate and/or how
she was allegedly underpaid. Plaintiff was requested to provide the court with
a copy of her pay stub which would reflect that she was “shorted” payment for
six hours of work during a pay period ending on or around December 11, 2018.
Plaintiff has failed to do so. 
3.                 
Plaintiff is requested to provide the court with
authority supporting her request for back pay. 
4.                 
Plaintiff seeks back pay for the following periods:
December 17, 2018-February 2019, January 2020-March 2020, May 2020-April 2021
and June 2021-January 2021. (Plaintiff Decl., ¶ 14). Plaintiff concedes that
she was employed from at February 2019-January 2020 with a company called
Paratus but subsequently states that she “again had difficulty finding
substantially similar employment,” apparently “due to the Covid-19 Pandemic.” (Id.)
It is unclear to the court why Defendant would be financially responsible for
Plaintiff’s inability to find substantially similar employment after she
apparently secured same at Paratus. Further, Plaintiff states that she had been
out of work for approximately 84 weeks, that “[d]uring these times, [she] would
look for work online and would ultimately find some jobs” and that she would
“sometimes. . . earn less than [she] did while working for Defendant at some of
[her] jobs.” (Id.) Plaintiff does not provide the court with any
information as to the nature, duration and financial compensation of these
jobs.
5.                 
Plaintiff fails to provide the court with any
information regarding how her general damages were
calculated.
