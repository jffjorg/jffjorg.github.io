```

Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's application for default judgment without prejudice. The denial is due to several defects in the application, including:

* The plaintiff failed to submit updated Judicial Council CIV-100 forms with the default prove-up application.
* The plaintiff did not serve the defendants with "Statements of Damages and Punitive Damages" as required by Code of Civil Procedure § 425.115.
* Exhibit 6 consists only of an English translation and does not include the original Chinese document, which must be included and authenticated.
* The plaintiff did not explain how the defendants' uses of the plaintiff's trademarks constituted "sales, offering for sale, or distribution of goods or services" in connection with which statutory damages may be awarded.

The judge has requested that the plaintiff brief this issue and provide further information about the defendants' uses of the plaintiff's trademarks. The application for default judgment will not be accepted unless it is full and complete.
