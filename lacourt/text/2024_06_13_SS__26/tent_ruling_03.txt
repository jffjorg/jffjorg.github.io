ANALYSIS:
 
Defendant Laura Storojev (“Defendant”) propounded Form
Interrogatories, Sets One and Two, and Requests for Admission, Set One, on
Plaintiff Nasch Village Green, LP (“Plaintiff”) on January 26, 2024. (Motions,
Brown Decl., Exhs. 1-2.) Despite a meet and confer effort, Plaintiff has not
served responses as of the filing of the instant (1) Motion to Compel Responses
to Form Interrogatories, Sets One and Two, and Request for Sanctions; (2)
Motion to Deem Requests for Admission, Set One, Admitted, and Request for
Sanctions, on May 21, 2024. (Id. at ¶¶3-11 and Exhs. 3-10.) As of the
filing of these Motions, no responses have been served. (Id. ¶11.) 
 
Based on Plaintiff’s failure to serve initial responses to
the discovery, the Motions to compel responses to interrogatories, and to deem
admissions admitted, are granted. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290; 2033.280.)
There is no requirement for a prior meet and confer effort before a motion to
compel initial responses or deem admissions admitted can be filed. (Code Civ.
Proc., §§ 2030.290; 2033.280.) Further, the motion can be brought any time
after the responding party fails to provide the responses. (Code Civ. Proc., §§
2030.290; 2033.280.) Therefore, Defendant is entitled to an order compelling
Plaintiff to serve verified responses to the interrogatories without
objections. The Court also deems the requests for admission admitted against
Plaintiff.
 
Plaintiff’s failure to timely respond constitutes a misuse
of the discovery process. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (d).) Sanctions
are appropriate under Code of Civil Procedure sections 2023.010 and 2023.030
and have been properly noticed. Sanctions are awarded against Plaintiff in the
amount of $450.00 per motion based on two hours of attorney time billed at
$450.00 per hour. (Motions, Brown Decl., ¶14.) 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant Laura Storojev’s (1) Motion to Compel Responses to
Form Interrogatories, Sets One and Two, and Request for Sanctions; and (2)
Motion to Deem Requests for Admission, Set One, Admitted, and Request for
Sanctions, are GRANTED. PLAINTIFF NASCH VILLAGE GREEN, LP IS TO SERVE VERIFIED
RESPONSES WITHOUT OBJECTION TO THE INTERROGATORIES WITHIN 20 DAYS’ NOTICE OF
THIS ORDER. ALSO WITHIN 20 DAYS OF THIS ORDER, PLAINTIFF NASCH VILLAGE GREEN,
LP IS PAY SANCTIONS OF $900.00 TO DEFENSE COUNSEL.
