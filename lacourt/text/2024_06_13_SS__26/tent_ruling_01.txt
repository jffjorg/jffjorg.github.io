ANALYSIS:
 
On March 9,
2018, Plaintiff Gregg Sokolsky aka Affordable Dog Training And Anti-Aggression
By Gregg Sokolsky (“Plaintiff”) filed this action for breach of contract and
common counts against Defendants Homeless to Forever Foundation and Catherine
Macias (“Defendants”). Defendant
Macias filed an answer on July 18, 2019. On September 25, 2019 Plaintiff filed a copy of the parties’
settlement agreement with a request for dismissal and retention of jurisdiction
under Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6. The Court dismissed the action
pursuant to the stipulation on the same date. (Stip and Order, filed 09/25/19.)

 
On April 3, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant
Motion to Vacate Dismissal, Enforce Settlement, and Enter Judgment. To date, no
opposition has been filed. 
 
Discussion
 
The instant motion is brought under Code of Civil Procedure, section
664.6, which states in relevant part:
 
If parties to pending litigation
stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties outside the presence of the court
or orally before the court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the
court, upon motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement.
If requested by the parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties
to enforce the settlement until performance in full of the terms of the
settlement.
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6, subd.
(a).) Prior to January 1, 2021, “parties” under section 664.6 meant the
litigants themselves, not their attorneys. 
(Levy v. Superior Court (1995) 10 Cal.4th 578, 586.) The current
statute provides that “parties” includes “an attorney who represents the party”
and an insurer’s agent. (Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6, subd. (b).) The settlement
must include the signatures of the parties seeking to enforce the agreement,
and against whom enforcement is sought. (J.B.B. Investment Partners, Ltd. v.
Fair (2014) 232 Cal.App.4th 974, 985.) Plaintiff has demonstrated the settlement agreement complies with
the statutory requirements set forth above because it was signed by both
parties. (Motion, Tang Decl., Exh. 3, p. 8.)
 
Furthermore,
the request for retention of jurisdiction must be made in writing, by the
parties, before the action is dismissed for the Court’s retention of
jurisdiction to conform to the statutory language. (Wackeen v. Malis
(2002) 97 Cal.App.4th 429, 433 [“If, after a suit has been dismissed, a party
brings a section 664.6 motion for a judgment on a settlement agreement but
cannot present to the court a request for retention of jurisdiction that meets
all of these requirements, then enforcement of the agreement must be left to a
separate lawsuit.”].) The parties’ request for retention of jurisdiction
complies with these requirements because it was made in writing to the Court
before the action was dismissed. (Motion, Tang Decl., Exh. 4.) 
 
The settlement provides that
Defendants would pay Plaintiff $10,000.00 through an initial payment of
$1,000.00, followed by monthly payments starting on September 15, 2019. (Id.
at Exh. 3, §II(D).) The settlement agreement also provides if Defendants default,
Plaintiff may seek judgment in the outstanding settlement amount. (Id.
at §II(E).) Payments of $4,760.00 were made towards the settlement, after which
Defendant defaulted. (Id. at ¶¶17-19 and Exh. 5.) Based on the
foregoing, Plaintiff is entitled to entry of judgment against Defendant in the
amount of $5,240.00 principal ($10,000.00 - $4,760.00), plus $479.00 interest
at ten percent per annum from April 15, 2023, $2,320.00 attorney’s fees for 5.8
hours billed at $400.00 per hour, and $60.00 costs. (Id. at ¶¶23-31.) 
 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiff Gregg Sokolsky aka Affordable Dog Training And
Anti-Aggression By Gregg Sokolsky’s Motion to Enforce Settlement Agreement is GRANTED.
JUDGMENT TO BE ENTERED IN PLAINTIFF’S FAVOR AND AGAINST DEFENDANTS HOMELESS TO
FOREVER FOUNDATION AND CATHERINE MACIAS IN THE AMOUNT OF $5,240.00 PRINCIPAL, $479.00
INTEREST, $2,320.00 ATTORNEY’S FEES, AND $60.00 COSTS.
