And here is a summary in English text:

This tentative ruling grants Defendant Manuel Ocampo's Motion for Terminating Sanctions. The Plaintiffs, Yohanson Walkir Castellanos Orozco and Ana Lucia Elizabeth Lantan Garcia, failed to comply with court orders to serve responses without objections and pay sanctions. Despite notice of the court's ruling, the Plaintiffs failed to comply with the orders. The court finds that terminating sanctions are warranted due to the Plaintiffs' willful disobedience of the discovery orders. The court grants the defendant's motion and dismisses the Plaintiffs' complaint with prejudice.
