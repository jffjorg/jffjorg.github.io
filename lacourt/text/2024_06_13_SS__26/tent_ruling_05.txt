ANALYSIS:
 
Petitioner Directors Guild of America, Inc. (“Petitioner”) petitions the court to confirm
the arbitration award in its favor and against Respondents Dominion
Films Montreal Inc. and Dominion Films LLC (“Respondents”). This action arises out of the parties’ dispute over
residuals owed to employees represented by Petitioner for the production of a
theatrical motion picture entitled “Last Call aka Dominio.” (Pet., ¶¶4-10.) Petitioner
filed the instant Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award on February 8, 2024. To date, no opposition has been filed.
 
Discussion
 
“Any party to an arbitration in which an award has been made
may petition the court to confirm, correct or vacate the award.  The petition shall name as respondent all
parties to the arbitration and may name as respondents any other persons bound
by the arbitration award.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1285.) “If a petition or response under this chapter is duly
served and filed, the court shall confirm the award as made, whether rendered
in this state or another state, unless in accordance with this chapter it corrects
the award and confirms it as corrected, vacates the award or dismisses the
proceeding.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
1286.)
 
Filing Requirements of a Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award (CCP § 1285.4)
 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 1285.4 states: “A petition under this chapter shall:
 
(a)  
Set forth the substance of or have attached a copy of
the agreement to arbitrate unless the petitioner denies the existence of such
an agreement.
 
(b)  
Set forth the names of the arbitrators.
 
(c) Set forth or
have attached a copy of the award and the written opinion of the arbitrators,
if any.”
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1285.4 (emphasis added).) Petitioner
has submitted a copy of the Arbitration Agreement, name of the arbitrator, and a copy of the Arbitration Award (Pet.,
Exhs. A-B). This satisfies the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 1285.4,
subdivisions (a)-(c).
 
Service of the Petition and Notice of Hearing (CCP §
1290.4)
 
Code of Civil Procedure
section 1290.4 states in pertinent part: 
 
(a) A copy of the
petition and a written notice of the time and place of the hearing thereof and
any other papers upon which the petition is
based shall be served in the manner provided in the arbitration
agreement for the service of such petition and notice.
 
(b) If the arbitration agreement does not provide the
manner in which such service shall be made and the person upon whom service is
to be made has not previously appeared in the proceeding and has not previously
been served in accordance with this subdivision: ¶ (1) Service within this
State shall be made in the manner provided by law for the service of summons in
an action.
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1290.4.) Petitioner filed a proof of service showing
that the Petition and Notice of Hearing were served on Respondents on February
16, 2024 by certified mail with return receipt requested. (Proof of Service by
Mail, filed 09/02/21.) Service by certified mail with return receipt requested
is allowed under the parties’ agreement. (Pet., Exh. A, § 2-603, subd. (b).)
Therefore, the Court finds that the requirements of Code of Civil
Procedure section 1290.4 have been met. 
 
Service of the Arbitration
Award (CCP § 1283.6)
         
Code of Civil Procedure section 1283.6 provides that: “The
neutral arbitrator shall serve a signed copy of the award on each party to the arbitration
personally or by registered or certified mail or as provided in the
agreement.” This requirement may be satisfied by service by the
arbitrator or upon proper service of the Award with the Petition. (See Murry v. Civil Service Employees Ins. Co. (1967) 254 Cal.App.2d 796, 799-800.) The
Award was issued on January 18, 2024 and served by the arbitrator on January
22, 2024 by certified mail return receipt requested. (Pet., Exh. B, POS.) Therefore,
the Court finds Code of Civil Procedure section 1283.6 is satisfied. 
 
Timing of Service of Petition (CCP §§
1288, 1288.4)
           

A party may seek a court judgment confirming an arbitration
award by filing and serving a petition no more than four years, but not less
than 10 days, after the award is served. (Code
Civ. Proc., §§ 1288, 1288.4.) The Petition was filed and served less
than one month after service of the Award, making it timely under Code of Civil
Procedure sections 1288 and 1288.4. 
 
Merits of the Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award 
 
The court must
confirm the award as made, unless it corrects or vacates the award, or dismisses
the proceeding.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
1286; Valsan Partners Limited Partnership v. Calcor Space Facility, Inc.
(1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 809, 818.) Petitioner has demonstrated that the
arbitrator issued an Arbitration Award in its favor and against Respondents for residuals of $10,080.01
and late charges of $1,824.77 that continue to accrue at $3.31 per day from January
18, 2024. (Pet., Exh. B, p. 3.)
Petitioner is entitled to receive all Respondents’ accounts receivable from the
motion picture until the above amounts are paid in full and may recoup half of
its arbitration costs in the amount of $650.00. (Ibid.) Furthermore, as
the Petition is unopposed, there is no basis to find the Award should not be
confirmed. 
 
Request for Costs
 
To the extent Petitioner requests costs according to proof
(Pet., Prayer at ¶3), those are permitted on a petition to confirm arbitration
award. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1293.2; MBNA America Bank, N.A. v. Gorman
(2006) 147 Cal.App.4th.Supp. 1, 7.) Petitioner may file a memorandum of costs
pursuant to Cal. Rules of Court Rule 3.1700.
