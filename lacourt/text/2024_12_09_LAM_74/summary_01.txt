Significant Statements:
  - Terminating sanctions should not be ordered lightly, but are justified where a violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and there is evidence that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules.
  - The court should consider the totality of the circumstances, including conduct of the party to determine if the actions were willful, the detriment to the propounding party, and the number of formal and informal attempts to obtain discovery.
  - Before any sanctions may be imposed, the court must make an express finding that there has been a willful failure of the party to serve the required discovery responses.

Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion for terminating sanctions or, in the alternative, evidentiary sanctions filed by the defendant against the plaintiff. The case arises from a tenant-landlord dispute over the quality of the rental property. The plaintiff failed to respond to discovery requests, and the defendant filed a motion to compel initial discovery responses. The court granted four motions to compel, but the plaintiff has not complied with those orders. The defendant requests terminating sanctions, but the judge finds that this would be unjust given that the plaintiff's failure to respond was due to his incarceration. Instead, the judge imposes evidentiary sanctions for the form interrogatories, special interrogatories, requests for admission, and requests for production propounded on March 29, 2024. The court grants the defendant's motion for evidentiary sanctions and orders the defendant to prepare a proposed order consistent with the court's ruling.
