  Case Number:  20STCV08599    Hearing Date:   December 9, 2024    Dept:  74 Snyer v.
Danan
Defendant Marcelle Danan’s Motion
for Terminating Sanctions or, in the Alternative, Evidentiary Sanctions
 
BACKGROUND  
            This
case arises from a tenant-landlord dispute over the quality of the rental
property. 
            On
March 2, 2020, plaintiff David Syner (Plaintiff) filed a complaint against
defendant Marcelle Danan (Defendant).
            On
March 29, 2024, Defendant propounded discovery on Plaintiff.
            At
some point in March 2024, Plaintiff was incarcerated for an unrelated offense. 
            After
no response, on May 15, 2024, Defendant sent a meet and confer letter.  After no response, Defendant filed a Motion
to Compel Initial discovery responses. 
            On
August 5, 2024, the Court granted four motions to compel.  Plaintiff has not complied with those orders.

            On
November 13, 2024, Defendant filed a Motion for Terminating Sanctions or, in
the alternative, Evidentiary Sanctions. 
 
LEGAL STANDARD 
The court is authorized,
after notice and an opportunity for hearing, to impose the following sanctions
against anyone engaging in conduct that is a misuse of the discovery process:
monetary sanctions, issue sanctions, evidence sanctions, terminating sanctions,
and contempt.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§¿2023.030, subds. (a)-(e).)  
“The discovery statutes
evince an incremental approach to discovery sanctions, starting with monetary
sanctions and ending with the ultimate sanction of termination. [Citation.]”  (Doppes v. Bentley Motors, Inc.¿(2009)
174 Cal.App.4th 967, 992; see J.W. v. Watchtower Bible and Tract Society of
New York, Inc.¿(2018) 29 Cal.App.5th 1142, 1169.)  If a lesser sanction fails to curb misuse, a
greater sanction is warranted.  (Doppes,
supra, 174 Cal.App.4th at p. 992.)  “Discovery
sanctions ‘should be appropriate to the dereliction, and should not exceed what
is required to protect the interests of the party entitled to but denied
discovery.’”  (Ibid.)  “But where a violation is willful, preceded by
a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not
produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial court is justified in
imposing the ultimate sanction.”  (Id.,
quoting Mileikowsky v. Tenet Healthsystem (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th
262, 279–280); Creed-21 v. City of Wildomar¿(2017) 18 Cal.App.5th 690,
702, quoting Doppes and Mileikowsky.)¿¿ 
The court should consider
the totality of the circumstances, including conduct of the party to determine
if the actions were willful, the detriment to the propounding party, and the
number of formal and informal attempts to obtain discovery.  (Lang v. Hochman (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th
1225, 1246.)  Terminating sanctions
should not be ordered lightly, but are justified where a violation is willful,
preceded by a history of abuse, and there is evidence that less severe
sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules.  (Doppes, supra, 174 Cal.App.4th at p.
992.) 
Before any sanctions may
be imposed the court must make an express finding that there has been a willful
failure of the party to serve the required discovery responses.  (Fairfield v. Superior Court for Los
Angeles County (1966) 246 Cal.App.2d 113, 118.)  The party who failed to comply with discovery
obligations has the burden of showing that the failure was not willful.  (Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d
771, 788; Cornwall v. Santa Monica Dairy Co. (1977) 66 Cal.App.3d 250,
252-253.)   
Evidence or issue
sanctions may be imposed only after parties violated discovery orders
compelling further responses, except in exceptional circumstances, including
where there was sufficiently egregious misconduct regarding a failure to
respond to discovery, or a prior discovery order would be futile.  (New Albertsons, Inc. v. Superior Court (2008)
168 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1426.)
 
DISCUSSION
Defendant
requests terminating sanctions against Plaintiff for failure to respond to
discovery.  Terminating sanctions should not be ordered lightly,
but are justified where a violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse,
and there is evidence that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance
with the discovery rules.  (Doppes,
supra, 174 Cal.App.4th at p. 992.)  Here, Plaintiff’s failure to
respond to discovery was because of his incarceration.  Plaintiff’s counsel lost contact with
Plaintiff around the time of his incarceration. 
(Ostrow Decl., Ex. “A”, Ostrow Decl., ¶ 3.)  Counsel was unable to find defendant until
November 2024.  (Ostrow Decl., Ex. “A”,
Ostrow Decl., ¶ 5.)  Given the
surrounding context, it would be unjust to impose terminating sanctions where
Plaintiff’s failure to respond to discovery requests is at least, in part, due
to his incarceration.  
Alternatively, defendant
requests evidentiary sanctions.  The
Court finds that Plaintiff’s failure to respond to discovery requests was
willful because failure to communicate with his attorney for eight months
indicates a willful disregard to respond. 
Therefore, the Court will impose evidentiary sanctions for the form
interrogatories, special interrogatories, requests for admission and requests
for production propounded on March 29, 2024.
 
CONCLUSION
The
Court grants Defendant’s motion for evidentiary sanctions.  Defendant to prepare a proposed order
consistent with the Court’s ruling.  
Defendant
to give notice.
