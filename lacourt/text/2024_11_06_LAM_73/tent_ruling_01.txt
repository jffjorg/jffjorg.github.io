ANALYSIS
 
A.     Legal
Standard 
 
A responding party has 30 days after service of interrogatories to
serve their responses on the propounding party. (Code of Civ. Proc., §
2030.260, subd. (a).) However, if interrogatories are served by electronic
service, a responding party has an additional two (2) court days to respond.
(Code of Civ. Proc., § 1010.6, subd. (a)(3)(B).)  
 
If the responding party fails to timely respond to the
interrogatories, “The party to whom the interrogatories are directed waives any
right to exercise the option to produce writings under Section 2030.230, as
well as any objection to the interrogatories, including one based on privilege
or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section
2018.010).” (Code of Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).)  
  
Furthermore, the party propounding the interrogatories may move
for an order compelling response to the interrogatories. (Code of Civ. Proc.,
§§ 2030.290, subd. (b), 2031.300, subd. (b).) And “Unlike a motion to compel
further responses, a motion to compel responses is not subject to a 45-day time
limit, and the propounding party does not have to demonstrate either good cause
or that it satisfied a ‘meet and confer’ requirement.” (Sinaiko Healthcare
Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th
390, 404.)
