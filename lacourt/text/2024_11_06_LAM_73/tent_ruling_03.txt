I. BACKGROUND
 
On July 18, 2024, Plaintiff Natalia
Lianova filed a Complaint against Defendants Guy Zarfati (“Zarfati”), LA
Development Properties LLC (“LADP”), Red Dragon Investment (“RDI”), Lion
Servicing (“Lion”), GSA Management Limited Liability Company, Orange Coast
Title Company, Lawyers Title Company, Shery Katz, Does 1-10 and
all persons known or unknown claiming any legal or equitable right, title,
estate, lien, or interest in the properties described in this complaint and
adverse to the Plaintiff’s title or any cloud on plaintiff’s title thereto.
 
The Complaint alleges causes of action
for: 
1.    
Quiet Title (Misrepresentation)
2.    
Fraudulent Deceit
3.    
Cancellation of Instrument (Quitclaim
Deed)
4.    
Cancellation of Instrument (Deed of
Trust)
5.    
Cancellation of Instrument (Deed of
Trust)
6.    
Declaratory Relief
 
The Complaint alleges the following. Plaintiff
is, and at all times mentioned herein is and was, a resident of certain real
property commonly known as 3564 Poppy Drive, Calabasas, CA 91302 (the “Subject
Property”). Plaintiff obtained title to the Subject Property on or about
November 3, 2011, via that certain Grant Deed that recorded on November 9, 2011
as Instrument Number 20111519207 in the Official Records of the Los Angeles
County Recorder’s Office (the “Lianova Grant Deed”). Plaintiff’s spouse, Andrey
Lizikhin (“Andrey”), transferred any interest he may have held in the Subject
Property on or about November 4, 2011 to Plaintiff via that certain
Interspousal Grant Deed that recorded on November 9, 2011 as Instrument Number
20111519208 in the Official Records of the Los Angeles County Recorder’s Office
(the “Interspousal Deed”). On or about March
14, 2023, Defendant Zarfati, who was in a romantic relationship with Plaintiff
at that time, advised Plaintiff that she needed to transfer the Subject
Property into a Limited Liability Company in order to avoid any Judgments
against the Subject Property due to the actions of Plaintiff’s spouse, Andrey. Zarfati
further advised Plaintiff that she would be identified as and would hold the
position of managing member of the Limited Liability Company. On
or about March 14, 2023, Plaintiff, under the above-referenced representations
from Zarfati, executed that certain Quitclaim Deed that recorded on March 22,
2023 as Instrument Number 20230182541 in the Official Records of the Los
Angeles County Recorder’s Office (the “Offending Deed”), which Offending Deed
transferred Plaintiff’s interest in the Subject Property to Defendant LADP.
Plaintiff alleges that Zarfati never did identify Plaintiff as the managing
member of LADP. Plaintiff is
informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that on or about March 14,
2023, Defendant LADP, via its manager, Defendant Zarfati, executed that certain
Deed of Trust that recorded against the Subject Property on March 22, 2023 as
Instrument Number 20230182542 in the Official Records of the Los Angeles County
Recorder’s Office (the “RDI DOT”). The RDI DOT identifies Defendant RDI as
Lender, Defendant LADP as Borrower, and Defendant Lion as Trustee.
 
On October 8, 2024, Defendant RDI filed a Demurrer
to the Complaint, arguing:
·      
RDI demurs specifically as to the First, Third,
Fourth and Sixth Causes of Action, the only causes of action in which RDI has
been named.
·      
The claims against RDI fail because RDI is a bona
fide encumbrancer of the real property which is the subject of this action and
holds its interest free and clear of Plaintiff’s off-record, unknown claims of
fraudulent misrepresentation against Zarfati.
·      
Further, as to the third cause of action, RDI is not
a party to the instrument (quitclaim deed) which Plaintiff is attempting to
cancel by way of this cause of action and there are no charging allegations
against RDI in this cause of action.
 No opposition
was filed. 
On October 8, 2024, Defendant RDI filed a Motion to
Expunge Notice of Pendency of Action, arguing:
·      
While Plaintiff’s Complaint may allege a real property
claim, she will be unable to demonstrate the probable validity of that real
property claim as against RDI, because RDI is a bona fide encumbrancer, as a
matter of law, having parted with its loan and acquired its secured interest in
the subject real property of the Verified Complaint for valuable consideration
and without notice of Plaintiff’s claims of fraudulent misrepresentation
alleged against Defendant, Guy ZaffatL
·      
This is a fraud in the inducement case and while Plaintiff
may have viable claims against Zarfati based on his alleged fraudulent
misrepresentations, her quiet title and cancellation of instruments claims
against RDI will undoubtedly fail, because RDI is a bona fide encumbrancer, who
took its secured lien interest free and clear of Plaintiff's unrecorded and
unknown claims of fraudulent misrepresentations.
·      
Here, RDI, prior to foreclosing on the Subject
Property, held a secured interest in the form of the RDI Deed of Trust. It is
the RDI Deed of Trust which Plaintiff seeks to set aside, with her goal to
ultimately set aside RDI's subsequent foreclosure of the RDI Deed of Trust
against the Subject Property.
·      
Plaintiff has not alleged any facts that would give
rise to a successful claim that the underlying "Offending Deed" is
void, not merely voidable.
·      
RDI is a bona fide encumbrancer.
·      
RDI should be awarded its attorneys’ fees. RDI
request an order compelling Plaintiff to pay its reasonable attorney's fees, in
the sum of $2,762.50 and costs in the amount of $60.00, for a total of $2,822.50.
No opposition was filed. 
II. DISCUSSION 
 
A.     Demurrer
 
a.     Legal Standard for Demurrer
 
A demurrer tests the sufficiency of whether the complaint
states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007)
147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) When considering demurrers, courts read the
allegations liberally and in context—any defects must be apparent on the face
of the pleading or via proper judicial notice. (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins.
Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) “A demurrer tests the pleading alone,
and not the evidence or facts alleged.” (E-Fab, Inc. v. Accountants, Inc.
Servs. (2007) 153 Cal.App.4th 1308, 1315.) As such, the court assumes the
truth of the complaint’s properly pleaded or implied factual allegations. (Id.)
The only issue a demurrer is concerned with is whether the complaint, as it
stands, states a cause of action. (Hahn, supra, 147 Cal.App.4th
at p. 747.) 
 
b.     Meet and Confer Requirement 
 
“Before filing a demurrer pursuant to
this chapter, the demurring party shall meet and confer in person or by
telephone with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for
the purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached that would
resolve the objections to be raised in the demurrer.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
430.41, subd. (a).)  
 
Here,
counsel for Defendant RDI submitted a declaration stating he and Kyle Marks,
Plaintiff’s counsel at the time, had numerous telephone and email
communications concerning the issues raised in the Demurrer. (Bartelstone Decl.,
¶¶
3-4.) The Court finds the moving party has satisfied its meet and confer
obligation. 
 
c.     
Request
for Judicial Notice
 
RDI filed a
request for judicial notice of the following: 
1.    
The Grant Deed (in favor of Natalia
Lianova) recorded on November 9, 201 1, as Document No. 20111519207 in the
Official Records of the Recorder's Office of Los Angeles County, California.
2.    
Interspousal Grant Deed (in favor of
Natalia Lianova) recorded on November 9, 20II, as Document No. 20111519208 in

3.    
Quitclaim Deed (in favor of LA
Development Properties LLC, a California Limited Liability Company), recorded

Recorder's Office of Los Angeles County, California.
5.

Trustee's Sale (re: RDI Deed of Trust) recorded on December 20,2023, as
Document No. 20230893267.
6.    
Trustee's Deed Upon Sale (in favor of
RDI), recorded on August 9,2024, as Document No. 20240535475 in the Official
Records of the Recorder's Office of Los Angeles County, California.
Evidence Code §452(h) provides that a
court may take judicial notice of “[f]acts and propositions that are not
reasonably subject to dispute and are capable of immediate and accurate
determination by resort to sources of reasonably indisputable accuracy.”  Additionally, “a court may take judicial
notice of the fact of a document’s recordation, the date the document was
recorded and executed, the parties to the transaction reflected in a recorded
document, and the document’s legally operative language, assuming there is no
genuine dispute regarding the document’s authenticity.”  (Fontenot
v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 256, 265.) Moreover,
“[f]rom this, the court may deduce and rely upon the legal effect of the
recorded document, when that effect is clear from its face.” (Id.) 
 
The Court grants all of RDI’s unopposed
requests for judicial notice.
 
d.     Demurrer to First, Third, Fourth and Sixth
Causes of Action
 
Defendant RDI argues that all of
Plaintiff’s claims asserted against RDI - the first cause of action for Quiet
Title, third cause of action for Fraudulent Deceit, fourth cause of action for
Cancellation of Instrument (Deed of Trust) and sixth cause of action for Declaratory
Relief - fail because RDI is a bona fide encumbrancer. 
Two
elements establish a party as a bona fide encumbrancer: (1) encumbrance of the
property in good faith for value, (2) without knowledge or notice of the
asserted rights of another. (First Fidelity Thirty & Loan Ass'n v.
Alliance Bank (1998) 60 Cal.App.4th 1433, 1440-1441.) “Bona fide purchasers
and mortgagees who are about to invest money on the faith of title, should be
held to have satisfied the demands of reasonable diligence, when they find an
unincumbered [sic] record.” (Brock v. First South Savings Assn. (1992) 8
Cal.App.4th 661, 673 [10 Cal.Rptr.2d 700].
A
bona fide encumbrancer takes title free and clear “so long as the reconveyance
is voidable and not void.” (Schiavon v. Arnaudo Brothers (2000) 84
Cal.App.4th 374, 376.) “A deed is void if the grantor's signature is forged or
if the grantor is unaware of the nature of what he or she is signing.” (Schiavon
v. Arnaudo Brothers, supra, 84 Cal.App.4th at p. 378.) 
According to the Complaint, Plaintiff
seeks to quiet title to the Subject Property against the interests of the
Defendants, and each of them, as of November 9, 2011, the date upon which the
Lianova Deed was recorded. (Complaint, ¶ 39.) Plaintiff alleges that the basis of her
interest in the Subject Property is that the Offending Deed was obtained
fraudulently via misrepresentation by Defendant Zarfati. (Complaint, ¶ 37.) The
Complaint further alleges that a present controversy exists in that Plaintiff
contends that her signature on the Offending Deed was fraudulently obtained,
and that Plaintiff never authorized nor consented to the execution of and
recording of the RDI DOT and GSA DOT, and that Defendant Zarfati never held the
power necessary to execute the Katz DOT, and therefore Plaintiff should be
declared the actual owner of the Subject Property and cancel the RDI DOT, GSA
DOT, and Katz DOT. (Complaint, ¶ 59.)
 
Here, the Court agrees with RDI that
the Complaint does not contain any allegations that RDI was not a bona fide
encumbrancer. First, there are no allegations that the RDI DOT is void. Plaintiff
does not allege that any signatures on the deeds were forged. Further, the
Complaint contains allegation that RDI parted with valuable consideration in
the form of the RDI loan. (Complaint, ¶¶ 23, 24.) Additionally, the Complaint alleges that
Zarfati misrepresented to RDI the true ownership of the Subject Property. (Complaint,
¶ 44.) Therefore,
there are no allegations indicating that RDI had knowledge or notice of Plaintiff’s
asserted rights. The Court finds that RDI has sufficiently established that the
claims asserted against it fail because RDI was a bona fide encumbrancer.
 
The Court notes that Plaintiff has not
filed an opposition.
 
Based on the foregoing, the demurrer
to the first, third, fourth and sixth causes of action is SUSTAINED with leave
to amend.

Evidence Code
§452(h) provides that a court may take judicial notice of “[f]acts and
propositions that are not reasonably subject to dispute and are capable of
immediate and accurate determination by resort to sources of reasonably
indisputable accuracy.”  Additionally, “a
court may take judicial notice of the fact of a document’s recordation, the
date the document was recorded and executed, the parties to the transaction
reflected in a recorded document, and the document’s legally operative
language, assuming there is no genuine dispute regarding the document’s
authenticity.”  (Fontenot v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 256,
265.) Moreover, “[f]rom this, the court may deduce and rely upon the legal
effect of the recorded document, when that effect is clear from its face.” (Id.) 
 
The Court grants
all of RDI’s unopposed requests for judicial notice.
 
b.    
Legal
Standard
 
A
notice of pendency of action may be filed when a real property claim is alleged
in an action.  (C.C.P., § 405.1, 405.2.)  A real property claim means
the causes of action, if proven, would affect either: (a) title to or the right
to possession of specific real property, or (b) the use of an easement
identified in the pleading.  (C.C.P., § 405.4.)¿ A party seeking to remove
the notice has two options, either attack the pleading as failing to state a
real property claim¿(C.C.P., § 405.31),¿or attack the real property claim as
lacking evidentiary merit¿(C.C.P., § 405.32).¿¿ 
 
In
determining whether a real property claim has been asserted, the Court engages
in a demurrer-like analysis.  (Park 100 Investment Group II, LLC v.
Ryan¿(2009) 180 Cal.App.4th 795, 808.) ¿
 
When
questioning the evidentiary merit of a claim, the claimant who filed the lis
pendens has the burden of proof.  (C.C.P., § 405.30.)  Thus, that
claimant, in opposing the motion to expunge the lis pendens, must demonstrate
the following: (1) the action affects title to or right of possession of the
real property described in the notice; (2) in so far as the said notice is
concerned, the party recording the notice has commenced the action for a proper
purpose and in good faith; and (3) the probable validity of the real property
claim by a preponderance of the evidence.  (Hunting World, Inc. v.
Superior Court (1994) 22 Cal.App.4th 67, 70; see also C.C.P., §405.30, et
seq.)  Only admissible evidence is permitted on the motion.¿ (Burger v.
Superior Court¿(1984) 151 Cal.App.3d 1013, 1019.) 
 
c.     
Discussion
 
Defendant
RDI moves to expunge the Notice of Pendency of Action, recorded by Plaintiff on
July 26, 2024, as Document No. 20240499897 in the Official Records of the
Recorder's Office of Los Angeles County, California.
 
As
Plaintiff has not filed an opposition to this motion, she has submitted no
evidence or argument of any kind. Plaintiff has failed to meet her burden of
demonstrating the probable validity of her real property claims. 
 
Therefore,
the motion is GRANTED.
 
d.    
Sanctions
 
The
prevailing party on a motion to expunge is entitled to reasonable attorneys’
fees and costs in making or opposing the motion unless the other party acted
with substantial justification.  (C.C.P., § 405.38.)¿ 
 
RDI
seeks attorney’s fees in the amount of $2,762.50 and costs in the amount of $60. As
the motion is being granted, RDI is entitled to reasonable attorney’s fees and
costs. 
 
However,
since the motion is unopposed, the Court will not grant RDI fees for the time
anticipated to review any opposition and preparation of a reply brief. Therefore,
the Court awards attorney’s fees and costs in the total amount of $1,522.50 (4.5
hours of work at a rate of $325.00/hour and the $60 filing fee.)
 
III. DISPOSITION 
 
Defendant
RDI’s Demurrer as to the Complaint’s First, Third, Fourth and Sixth
Causes of Action
is SUSTAINED with 20 days leave to amend.
 
Defendant
RDI’s Motion for an Order Expunging Notice of Pendency of Action is GRANTED. The
Court GRANTS Defendant RDI’s request for monetary sanctions against Plaintiff in
the reduced amount of $1,522.50.
Said monetary sanctions are to be paid to Defendant RDI’s counsel within 30
days of the date of this order.
