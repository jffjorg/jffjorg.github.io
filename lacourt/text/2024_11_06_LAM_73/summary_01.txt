And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the plaintiff's motion to compel the defendant's responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One. The defendant, Glenn E. Thomas Inc., failed to respond to the interrogatories despite being given an extension. As a result, the court is ordering the defendant to provide verified, objection-free responses to the interrogatories within 20 days of this order. The court's decision is based on California Code of Civil Procedure sections 2030.260, 2030.290, and 2031.300, which provide that a party who fails to respond to interrogatories waives any right to object to the interrogatories and any right to produce writings.
