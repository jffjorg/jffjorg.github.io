possession only was entered.

Discussion
Plaintiff’s Application for Default Judgment is DENIED without
prejudice. The following defects are noted:
Page BLI-iv of the Lease Agreement (Exhibit 1 to the
Declaration of Nicole Petsch) indicates that there was a security deposit of $91,500.00.
It is unclear to the court whether or not the security deposit has been applied
to the amount outstanding or credited back to Defendants. The court requests
that a supplemental declaration be provided in this regard.
