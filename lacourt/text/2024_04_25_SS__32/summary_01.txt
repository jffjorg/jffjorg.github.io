And here is the English-text summary:

The court has reviewed the petition for expedited minors compromise filed by Petitioner Nancy Gonzalez on behalf of Claimant Desmond Real, a 15-year-old. The court denies the petition without prejudice due to two reasons: the incorrect court address in the petition and the failure to file and complete form MC-355, which is required for depositing the net funds into a blocked account. The court orders the moving party to give notice and complete the required form.
