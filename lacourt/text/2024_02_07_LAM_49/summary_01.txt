Summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling addresses the demurrer filed by the Pasadena Unified School District (PUSD) to the Plaintiff's First Amended Complaint (FAC). The Judge sustains the demurrer to the First and Third Causes of Action, and overrules the demurrer to the Second and Fourth Causes of Action.

The Judge finds that the PUSD's demurrer to the First Cause of Action is sustained because the Plaintiff failed to plead facts showing when the psychological injuries were discovered, which is necessary to extend the statute of limitations. The Judge also sustains the demurrer to the Third Cause of Action, finding that the negligent hiring claim is duplicative of the general negligence claim and adds nothing to the FAC.

The Judge overrules the demurrer to the Second and Fourth Causes of Action, finding that the PUSD is not a named defendant in these causes of action and therefore cannot demur to them.

The Judge notes that leave to amend the FAC may be granted if the Plaintiff can make a sufficient offer of proof at the hearing as to how he can successfully amend his Complaint. The hearing is scheduled for February 7, 2024.
