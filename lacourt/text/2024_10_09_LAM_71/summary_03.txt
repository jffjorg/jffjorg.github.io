And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the unopposed motion to quash service of summons filed by Greystar California, Inc. on behalf of The Chadwick Apartments. The motion was filed because the summons and complaint were not served on The Chadwick Apartments in accordance with Corporations Code §17701.16. However, the judge ruled that Greystar did not have standing to make the motion on behalf of The Chadwick Apartments, and that the proper parties to make the motion would be the entities named in the grant deed that transferred ownership of the apartment complex. The judge granted Greystar's request for judicial notice of the grant deed, but denied the motion to quash service of summons.
