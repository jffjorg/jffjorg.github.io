```

And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied the ex parte application of Merik Migliore, the plaintiff, to reopen the case and adjust annuities. The reasons for the denial are as follows: there is a petition pending in the Probate Division of the Los Angeles Superior Court seeking the same relief as the application, and the Civil Division no longer has jurisdiction over the trust. Additionally, the relief sought requires a noticed motion, which was not provided. Furthermore, the plaintiff did not give notice to the state agencies that would normally receive notice of the creation and funding of a Special Needs Trust. The Court also notes that the trust beneficiary (Mr. Migliore) cannot modify the trust, and that the retired Judge Robert H. O'Brien cannot be compelled to hear the matter.
