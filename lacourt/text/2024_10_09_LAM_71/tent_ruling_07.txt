 Case Number:  BC343540    Hearing Date:   October 9, 2024    Dept:  71 Merik Migliore
v. John Aiken, II, M.D.
Case No. B34350

Ruling
on Plaintiff’s ex parte application to reopen case and to adjust annuities.

 
Plaintiff, Merik Migliore, applies
ex parte for an order:
1. 
Converting his Special Needs Trust (SNT) into an Irrevocable Domestic
Asset Protection Trust (DAP Trust);
2.  Appointing himself as Trustee over the
resultant trust; 
3. That the revised trust continue
to maintain its asset protection provisions; 
4. That the modified trust be
established without probate court oversight; 
5. That the annuities provided
under the trust be adjusted to match inflation; and 
6. That the Court consider Mr.
Migliore’s concerns that he is paying excessive trustee fees and issue a
prohibition against selling his abode; 
7. That the Court consider Mr.
Migliore’s concerns about his appointed Guardian Ad Litem and counsel’s fees;
and
8. 
That the Honorable Judge Robert H. O'Brien come out of retirement to
preside over this modification.
The Court denies the
application for the following reasons:               1.  The Court notes that there
is a petition in the Probate Division of the Los Angeles Superior Court set for
hearing on October 15, 2024 (Case
No. LP01427) seeking the same relief as this application.  The Civil Division of the Court no longer has
jurisdiction over the trust.  
  2.  The relief sought
requires a noticed motion to allow the Court the time to work up the
requests in the application.                 3.  Mr. Migliore also did not give
notice of this application to the state
agencies who would normally receive notice of the creation and funding of a SNT.
  4.  The proper party to seek to modify a trust is the
trustee, not the trust beneficiary.  
  5.  Finally, the Court has no jurisdiction to compel a retired
judge to hear a matter.
The ex parte application is denied.  Plaintiff is to give notice.
