And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the motions to compel further responses to form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and request for production of documents, brought by Defendant Gregorio Cortes De La Cruz. The motions were filed on November 27, 2023, and the court finds them to be timely. The court also finds that Defendant made a reasonable and good faith effort to informally resolve the issues raised by this motion, but Plaintiff has failed to cooperate.

The court grants the motions to compel further responses to form interrogatories and special interrogatories, as the responses provided by Plaintiff are evasive and incomplete. The court also grants the motion to compel further responses to the request for production of documents, as the documents requested are necessary for Defendant to properly evaluate Plaintiff's claim and prepare for trial.

The court imposes sanctions against Plaintiff in the amount of $630, to be paid to Defendant's counsel within 30 days of this order. The court also orders Plaintiff to provide further responses to the discovery requests within 30 days.

The court notes that Plaintiff failed to file an opposition to justify the objections to the discovery requests and failed to appear at an informal discovery conference. The court finds that the objections are boilerplate and without merit, and that Plaintiff has not presented evidence to establish that the attorney-client privilege and work product doctrine exist on these facts and cover the requested information.
