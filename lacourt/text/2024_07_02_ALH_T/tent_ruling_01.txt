  Case Number:  22STCV05294    Hearing Date:   July 2, 2024    Dept:  T Matter: Motions to Compel Further Responses to Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, and Request for Production of Documents and Request for SanctionsMoving Party:  Defendant Gregorio Cortes De La CruzResponding Party:    NoneThe court considered the moving papers. No opposition was filed.BACKGROUNDOn February 14, 2022, Plaintiff Yodit Girma (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Defendants Gregorio Cortes De La Cruz, California Department of Transportation, and the City of Los Angeles, alleging causes of action for motor vehicle negligence and premises liability, arising out of a vehicle collision that occurred on June 15, 2024. The complaint alleges that Defendant De La Cruz failed to stop or yield to traffic and crossed an intersection in an unsafe manner, violently colliding with Plaintiff’s vehicle. The complaint also alleges the intersection was not properly regulated, and traffic control devices were non-functional.On November 27, 2023, Defendant De La Cruz filed these motions to compel further responses to request for production, and form and special interrogatories. No opposition has been filed.On March 25, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel’s motion to be relieved as counsel was granted.On May 23, 2024, the court held an IDC, but Plaintiff did not appear.LEGAL STANDARDA motion to compel further responses to a demand for inspection or production of documents may be brought based on: (1) incomplete statements of compliance; (2) inadequate, evasive or incomplete claims of inability to comply; or (3) unmerited or overly generalized objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310(c).) As an additional requirement pertaining only to requests for production, the moving party must first offer facts demonstrating: “good cause justifying the discovery sought by the demand.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.310, subd. (b)(1).) This burden “is met simply by a fact-specific showing of relevance.” (TBG Ins. Services Corp. v. Superior Court (2002) 96 Cal.App.4th 443, 448; see also Glenfed Dev. Corp. v. Superior Court (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 1113, 1117.) If the moving party has shown good cause for the requests for production, the burden is on the objecting party to justify the objections. (Kirkland v.¿Sup.Ct¿(2002) 95 Cal. App.4th 92, 98.)¿¿¿ On receipt of a response to interrogatories, the propounding party may move for an order compelling a further response if the propounding party deems that (1) an answer to a particular interrogatory is evasive or incomplete, (2) an exercise of the option to produce documents under CCP section 2030.230 is unwarranted or the required specification of those documents is inadequate, or (3) an objection to an interrogatory is without merit or too general. (CCP § 2030.300(a).)  The responding party has the burden of justifying the objections thereto.  (Coy v. Sup.Ct. (1962) 58 Cal.2d 210, 220-21.)Trial courts are vested with “wide discretion” to allow or prohibit discovery. (Williams v. Superior Court¿(2017) 3 Cal.5th 531, 540.) Further, to the extent there is any doubt in whether these records should be discoverable, California’s liberal approach to discovery provides that doubt should be resolved in favor of permitting discovery. (Pacific Tel. & Tel. Co. v. Superior Court (1970) 2 Cal.3d 161, 173.) DISCUSSIONTimeliness  A motion to compel further responses to interrogatories or request for production must be noticed within 45 days of the service of the response, any supplemental response, or on or before any specific later date to which the propounding party and the responding party have agreed in writing.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300(c); 2031.310(c).)  Otherwise, the propounding party waives any right to compel further responses to the interrogatories or request for production of documents.  (Id.) Defense counsel represents that on September 11, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel served general boilerplate objections to the discovery requests. (Valdez Decl., ¶ 7; Exh. B.) The parties agreed the deadline to file these motions would be extended to November 27, 2023. (Id., ¶ 10; Exh. E.)The court finds the motions are timely as they were filed on November 27, 2023, the specific date to which the parties in agreed the deadline would be extended to.Meet and Confer The propounding party must submit a declaration under Code of Civ. Proc. §2016.040 stating facts demonstrating a good faith and reasonable effort to informally resolve each issue raised by the motion. (Code Civ. Proc., §2030.300, subd. (b).)On October 10, 2023, Defense counsel’s office emailed Plaintiff’s attorney a meet and confer letter. (Id., ¶ 8; Exh. C.) Defense counsel provided an extension to Plaintiff respond to the discovery, however, Plaintiff did not provide further responses. (Id., ¶¶ 9-10, 12; Exhs. D-E.)The court also notes that Plaintiff failed to appear at an informal discovery conference on May 23, 2024. In light of this, the court finds that Defendant made a reasonable and good faith effort to informally resolve the issues raised by this motion, but Plaintiff has failed to cooperate.Form Interrogatories Defendant moves to compel further responses to Form Interrogatory Nos. 1.1, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 2.7, 2.8, 2.9, 2.10, 2.11, 2.12, 2.13, 4.1, 4.2, 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, 6.6, 6.7, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4, 8.5, 8.6, 8.7, 8.8, 9.1, 9.2, 10.1, 10.2, 10.3, 11.1, 11.2, 12.1, 12.2, 12.3, 12.4, 12.5, 12.6, 12.7, 13.1, 13.2, 14.1, 14.2, 20.1, 20.2, 20.3, 20.4, 20.5, 20.6, 20.7, 20.8, 20.9, 20.10, 20.11, and Special Interrogatory Nos. 1-7 on the basis that the responses are evasive and incomplete. Plaintiff simply responded that: this request is vague, ambiguous, overbroad, unduly burdensome, invades the Responding Party’s right to privacy, the attorney-client and attorney work-product privileges, and prematurely seeks expert opinion in contravention of the time limits imposed by the California Code of Civil Procedure. Additionally, this request is neither relevant nor reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. The Court finds the responses to be evasive and incomplete. Plaintiff has not provided any of the basic information requested. Further, Plaintiff has not filed an opposition to justify the objections.To the extent Plaintiff has asserted an objection based upon attorney-client privilege and work product, Plaintiff as the party asserting the protections of the attorney-client privilege and the work product doctrine, has the burden of presenting evidence to establish that the privilege and/or doctrine exists on these facts and covers the requested information. (Zimmerman v. Sup. Ct. (2013) 220 Cal.App.4th 389, 402; Santa Rosa Memorial Hospital v. Sup. Ct. (1985) 174 Cal.App.3d 711, 727-728.) Plaintiff has not done so.As such, the motion to compel further responses to form interrogatories and special interrogatories is GRANTED. Plaintiff is ordered to provide further responses to form and special interrogatories within 30 days of this order.Request for Production of Documents Defendant also moves to compel further responses to Request for Production Nos. 1-19, arguing that there is good cause as the documents go to the heart of Plaintiff’s claims and are necessary for Defendant to properly evaluate Plaintiff’s claim and prepare for trial.Plaintiff responded with the same objections as to the interrogatories. Plaintiff has failed to file an opposition to justify the objections. Further, as noted above, Plaintiff as the party asserting the protections of the attorney-client privilege and the work product doctrine, has the burden of presenting evidence to establish that the privilege and/or doctrine exists on these facts and covers the requested information, and Plaintiff has not done so. Further, the requests seek basic information such as Plaintiff’s medical records relating to the incident and Plaintiff’s damages to his vehicle, as he is making a claim for injuries and property damage, and thus, there is good cause. The court finds that the objections are boilerplate and without merit.  As such, the motion to compel further responses to request for production is GRANTED. Plaintiff is ordered to provide further responses to request for production within 30 days of this order.SanctionsCCP sections 2031.310(h) and 2030.300(d) provide for mandatory monetary sanctions “against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel further response…, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2031.310(h), and 2030.300(d).)    As the motions are granted, and Plaintiff failed to provide any justification for the failure to provide further responses, Defendant’s request for sanctions is granted, but in a reduced amount due to the simplicity of the motions and the nature of the concurrent facts. As a result, the court imposes sanctions against Plaintiff in the amount of $630 ($150 per hour, for 3 hours, plus $180 in filing fees), to be paid to Defendant’s counsel within 30 days of this order.CONCLUSIONDefendant’s motions to compel further responses to form interrogatories, special interrogatories and request for production are GRANTED. Plaintiff is ordered to provide further responses within 30 days.Defendant’s request for sanctions is GRANTED. Plaintiff is ordered to pay monetary sanctions in the amount of $630 to Defendant’s counsel within 30 days of this order.Defendant is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
