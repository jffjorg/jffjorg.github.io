 Case Number:  21STCV44536    Hearing Date:   January 22, 2025    Dept:  B Hearing: 01/22/2025Re: JADE CARRASCO BY AND THROUGH HER GUARDIAN AD LITEM JESSE RONALD CARRASCO, et al. vs POSITIVE INVESTMENTS, INC., et al. (21STCV44536)Petitioner Jazelle Dimas’s Petition for Approval of Compromise of Claim or Action or Disposition of Proceeds of Judgment for Minor or a Person with a DisabilityRespondent: NO OPPOSITIONTENTATIVE RULINGPetitioner Jazelle Dimas’s Petition for Approval of Compromise of Claim or Action or Disposition of Proceeds of Judgment for Minor or a Person with a Disability is DENIED.BACKGROUNDThis action arises from a December 17, 2019, incident in which Claimant Jade Carrasco (“Claimant”) alleges the pitbull dog of Defendants Positive Investments, Inc. (“Positive Investments”), PI Properties LLC (“PI Properties”), Becky Radgowski (“Radgowski”), and Does 1 to 100 (collectively “Defendants”) attacked Claimant, causing injuries and damages.On December 7, 2021, Claimant and Petitioner Jazelle Dimas (“Petitioner”) filed a complaint against Defendants alleging four causes of action: (1) strict liability for dog bite (Cal. Civ. Code § 3342); (2) premises liability; (3) general negligence; and (4) negligent infliction of emotional distress.On October 16, 2024, Claimant filed a notice of settlement.On December 31, 2024, Petitioner filed the instant Petition to Confirm Minor’s Compromise of Claim or Action or Disposition of Proceeds of Judgment for Minor or a Person with a Disability on behalf of Claimant.ANALYSISPetitioner seeks court approval for a settlement under which Claimant would receive $50,000.00 from Positive Investments and PI Properties.Legal StandardAn enforceable settlement of a minor’s or incompetent’s claim can only be consummated with court approval. (Cal. Prob. Code §§ 2504, 3500, 3600 et seq.; Cal. Code of Civ. Proc. § 372.) For this purpose, a petition for approval must be presented to the court and, until it is granted,there is no final settlement. (Scruton v. Korean Air Lines Co. (1995) 39 Cal.App.4th 1596, 1603-1606.) Any settlement agreement therefore is voidable by the minor’s guardian ad litem. (Ibid. at 1606.)Prob. Code § 3600, et seq., governs how the settlement proceeds are to be paid. Pursuant to § 3601, the order shall approve payment of reasonable expenses from the settlement as follows:“The court making the order or giving the judgment referred to in Section 3600, as a part thereof, shall make a further order authorizing and directing that such reasonable expenses, medical or otherwise and including reimbursement to a parent, guardian, or conservator, costs, and attorney’s fees, as the court shall approve and allow therein, shall be paid from the money or other property to be paid or delivered for the benefit of the minor or person with a disability.” (Prob. Code § 3601(a).)In cases pursuant to § 3601, “unless the court has approved the fee agreement in advance, the court must use a reasonable fee standard when approving and allowing the amount of attorney’s fees payable from money or property paid or to be paid for the benefit of a minor or a person with a disability.” (Cal. Rules of Court Rule 7.955(a)(1).) In doing so, “[t]he court must give consideration to the terms of any representation agreement made between the attorney and the representative of the minor or person with a disability and must evaluate the agreement based on the facts and circumstances existing at the time the agreement was made, except where the attorney and the representative of the minor or person with a disability contemplated that the attorney's fee would be affected by later events.” (CRC Rule 7.955(a)(2).)DiscussionPetitioner seeks court approval for a settlement under which Claimant would receive $50,000.00. Of the $50,000.00 settlement, $590.87 is to be deducted for medical expenses, $12,500.00 for attorney’s fees, and $18,634.46 for costs. (See MC-350 Item 16.) Therefore, Claimant’s proposed net settlement amount is $18,274.57.As a preliminary matter, the court notes that Petitioner is not the authorized guardian ad litem (“GAL”) for Claimant. Claimant’s GAL in the instant action is Jesse Ronald Carrasco (“Jesse”), whose GAL application was approved on December 16, 2021. No other GAL application has been filed since.Only an appointed GAL has the authority to enforce settlement of a minor’s claim. (See CCP § 372.) Therefore, the Petition is denied as Petitioner lacks authority to enforce Claimant’s proposed settlement.Nonetheless, for Petitioner and Claimant’s benefit, the Court now discusses the Petition’s conformity with CRC Rule 7.950.The Petition sets forth information that bears upon the reasonableness of the compromisepursuant to CRC Rule 7.950. (MC-350 Attachment 8 [medical records].) Petitioner will receive $10,000.00 from Defendants as she also suffered injuries during the dog attack. (MC-350 Item 11b.) The reason for this apportionment is provided as Attachment 11b(3). Costs, while high, are reasonable given the extent of litigation. A memorandum of costs is provided as Attachment 13b. Additionally, attorney’s fees represent 25% of the total settlement agreement. (MC-350 Attachment 13a.) Claimant’s counsel provides their retainer agreement as Attachment 17a. Finally, the settlement is to be deposited in an annuity, subject to terms properly provided in Attachment 18b(3).The Court notes that, in the future, any refiled petitions should include a proposed order on form MC-351.CONCLUSIONPetitioner lacks authority to enforce settlement of Claimant’s claim. Accordingly, the Petition filed on behalf of minor Claimant Jade Carrasco is DENIED.Petitioner to give notice.
