BACKGROUND
 
This action arises from an alleged bed bug
infestation. On July 30, 2019, Plaintiffs Veronica Ramsey (“Ramsey”), Anthony
Munoz (“Anthony”), Alexis Lopez (“Alexis”), Angel Lopez (“Angel”), Damia Munoz
(“Damia”), a minor by and through their guardian ad litem Veronica Ramsey, and
Santino Munoz (“Santino”), a minor by and through their guardian ad litem Veronica
Ramsey (collectively “Plaintiffs”), filed a complaint against Defendants New
Era Investments, LLC (“New Era”), Louise Hsieh (“Louise”), Andrew Hsieh
(“Andrew”), and Does 1 through 20 (collectively “Defendants”), alleging eight
causes of action: (1) battery; (2) negligence; (3) intentional infliction of
emotional distress; (4) breach of implied warranty of habitability; (5) breach
of covenant of quiet enjoyment; (6) violation of Civil Code § 1942.4; (7)
private nuisance; and (8) public nuisance.
 
On August 26, 2024, Plaintiffs filed the
instant request for default judgment.
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
Cal. Code of Civ. Proc. § 585 permits
entry of a default judgment after a party has failed to timely respond or
appear. (CCP § 585.) A party seeking judgment on the default by the court must
file a Request for Court Judgment, and: (1) a brief summary of the case; (2)
declarations or other admissible evidence in support of the judgment requested;
(3) interest computations as necessary; (4) a memorandum of costs and
disbursements; (5) declaration of nonmilitary status; (6) a proposed form of
judgment; (7) a dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or
an application for separate judgment under CCP § 579, supported by a showing of
grounds for each judgment; (8) exhibits as necessary; and (9) a request for
attorney’s fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties. (Cal.
Rules of Court Rule 3.1800.) 
 
ANALYSIS
 
Plaintiffs
seek damages in the total amount of $150,861.72, representing $60,000.00 in
special damages, $30,000.00 in general damages, $60,000.00 in attorney’s fees,
and $861.72 in costs.
 
Plaintiffs’
request for default judgment against Defendants is denied for the following
deficiencies:
 
1.       Plaintiffs failed to dismiss Louise
Hsieh (CRC 3.1800(a)(7).)
2.      Plaintiffs seek damages jointly and severally
against Defendants New Era Investments, LLC and Andrew Hsieh, but fail to file
one JUD-100 identifying both defendants accordingly. Instead, Plaintiffs
improperly filed one JUD-100 per defendant. (CRC 3.1800(a)(7).)
3.      Plaintiffs’ JUD-100s seek attorney’s
fees in the amount of $60,000.00. However, Plaintiffs failed to provide a
retainer agreement or attorney declaration in support of the amount sought.
(Cal. Civ. Code § 1717.5(a); CRC 3.1800(a)(9).) Additionally, the request for
attorney’s fees is inconsistent among Plaintiffs’ filings, with the JUD-100s
requesting attorney’s fees while the separately submitted proposed orders do
not. Finally, on their face the attorney fees appear too high and need to be
further justified. 
 
Accordingly, Plaintiffs’
requests for default judgment against Defendants New Era Investments, LLC and
Andrew Hsieh are DENIED. This represents Plaintiffs’ second default judgment
denial for deficiencies, some deficiencies being identical to previous denials.
(See November 20, 2024.) Therefore, pursuant to CCP § 128.7 and CRC Rule
2.30, the Court will set an Order to Show Cause Re: Sanctions for Failure to
Obtain Default Judgment.
