And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's request for default judgment against the defendant, Frank Binder. The plaintiff is seeking damages in the amount of $2,438,116.24, but the judge has ruled that the plaintiff failed to provide sufficient evidence to support this amount. Specifically, the plaintiff failed to dismiss unnamed defendants, provide evidence of damages, and calculate interest. The judge has put the plaintiff on notice that future deficient filings may result in sanctions or dismissal. The plaintiff has 45 days to cure the deficiencies and resubmit the request for default judgment.
