(CRC Rule 3.1800(a)(3).)Accordingly, Plaintiff’s request for default judgment against Defendant Frank Binder is DENIED. Plaintiff is put on notice that future deficient filings risk sanctions pursuant to CCP § 128.7 and CRC Rule 2.30 and/or dismissal for failure to obtain default judgment within 45 days of default and to timely prosecute.
