TENTATIVE RULING
 
Nasiry’s motion to vacate the final amended judgment is denied.
 
BACKGROUND
 
The second amended
complaint (“SAC”) alleges that M&N Financing Corp. (“M&N”) and Nasiry
“operated a business that purchased retail installment sales contracts [] from
used car dealerships.”  (Department of
Fair Employment and Housing v. M&N Financing Corp. (2021) 69 Cal.App.5th
434, 437 (“M&N”).)[1]  “In deciding how much to pay for the
contracts, defendants used a formula that considered the gender of the car
purchaser.”  (Id. at 437-438.)  “[D]efendants would pay more for a contract
with a male purchaser than for a contract with a female purchaser or female
coborrower[.]”  (Id. at 438.)
 
In late September
2021, following summary adjudication and judgment on the pleadings, the Court
of Appeal reinstated the Department’s fifth cause of action.  (See ibid.) 
It was the only cause of action that the Court of Appeal revived.  (See ibid.; see also id. at 443-444, 446.)
 
On August 31, 2023,
the Department dismissed the fifth cause of action without prejudice.
 
On September 19,
2023, Nasiry’s motion to order the Department to join him to the fifth cause of
action as an indispensable party came on for hearing.  The Court held that it did not have
jurisdiction to hear the motion.  (See
9/19/23 Minute Order, p. 1.)
 
(11/3/23 Ruling
Re: Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings, p. 1.)
 
On November 3, 2023, the Court
heard Nasiry’s motion for judgment on the pleadings.  The Court found the motion moot and/or denied
it in full.
 
On December 1, 2023, the Court
entered the final amended judgment (“FAJ”) in the Department’s favor.
 
On January 26, 2024, Nasiry filed
a notice of appeal.
 
A few days later, on January 30,
2024, Nasiry filed a motion to vacate.
 
Here, the Court considers whether
the motion to vacate should be granted.
 
LAW
 
As a general rule,
 
“the perfecting of an
appeal stays proceedings in the trial court upon the judgment or order appealed
from or upon the matters embraced therein or affected thereby, including
enforcement of the judgment or order, but the trial court may proceed upon any other
matter embraced in the action and not affected by the judgment or order.”
[Citation.] The purpose of the automatic stay provision of [Code of Civil
Procedure] section 916, subdivision (a) “is to protect the appellate
court's jurisdiction by preserving the status quo until the appeal is decided.
The [automatic stay] prevents the trial court from rendering an appeal futile
by altering the appealed judgment or order by conducting other proceedings that
may affect it.” [Citation.] 
 
(Varian Medical Systems,
Inc. v. Delfino (2005) 35 Cal.4th 180, 189 (“Varian”).)
 
Effectively, 
 
the
[section] 916(a) “stay” means that, upon timely filing of a notice of appeal, the
trial court is divested of
power to act on
matters “embraced in” or “affected by” the appealed judgment or order:
Jurisdiction over the appealed matters shifts to the court of appeal and is terminated in the trial court; and the trial court's power
to enforce,
vacate or modify the
appealed judgment or order is suspended while the appeal is pending. [Citations.]
 
(Eisenberg, et al., Cal.
Practice Guide: Civ. Appeals and Writs (The Rutter Group December 2023 Update)
¶ 7:2, emphasis in original.)  Indeed,
“[f]urther trial court proceedings in contravention of the [section] 916 stay
are in excess of
the court’s jurisdiction in its “fundamental sense” and thus void[.]” 
(Ibid., emphasis in original.)
 
“[W]hether a matter is
‘embraced’ in or ‘affected’ by a judgment within the meaning of section 916 depends
upon whether postjudgment trial court proceedings on the particular matter
would have any impact on the ‘effectiveness’ of the appeal.”  (In re Marriage of Varner (1998) 68
Cal.App.4th 932, 936.)  “If so, the proceedings are stayed; if
not, the proceedings are permitted.” 
(Ibid.)
 
“The fact that the
postjudgment or postorder proceeding may render the appeal moot is not, by
itself, enough to establish that the proceeding affects the effectiveness of
the appeal and should be stayed under section 916.”  (Varian, supra, 35 Cal.4th
at 189.)  “[S]omething more is needed.  For example, the trial court proceeding must
directly or indirectly seek to ‘enforce, vacate or modify
[the] appealed judgment or order.’” 
(Ibid., emphasis added; see also Eisenberg, supra, at ¶ 7:9.1 [same].) 
It is well settled that “[t]he trial court’s power to enforce, vacate
or modify an appealed judgment or order is suspended while the appeal is
pending.”  (Elsea v. Saberi (1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 625, 629
[finding that the trial court violated section 916 and exceeded its
jurisdiction by deciding an intervening insurer’s Code of Civil Procedure
section 473 motion to vacate default judgment during the appeal], emphasis
added.)
 
Nevertheless,
“a judgment or order
which is void on its face, because its infirmity is determinable from an
inspection of the judgment roll or the record, may be set aside on motion at
any time after its entry by the court which rendered the judgment or made the
order.”  (Andrisani v. Saugus Colony
Limited (1992) 8 Cal.App.4th 517, 523, emphasis added.)  In other words, “[t]rial courts retain jurisdiction to set aside
a void judgment or order at any time[.]” 
(Eisenberg, supra, at ¶ 7:42, emphasis in original; see also Andrisani,
supra, 8 Cal.App.4th at 523 [“An appeal will not prevent the court from at any time lopping
off what has been termed a dead limb on the judicial tree – a void order.”].)  
 
“On the other hand,
trial courts do not retain jurisdiction pending appeal
to set aside a judgment that is merely voidable rather than void.” 
(Eisenberg, supra, at ¶ 7:42.2, emphasis in original.)
 
“A judgment is void if
the trial court lacks jurisdiction in a fundamental sense, as where it lacked
subject matter jurisdiction, lacked personal jurisdiction over the defendant,
or granted relief the court had no power to grant.”  (W. Bradley Electric, Inc. v. Mitchell
Engineering (2024) 318 Cal.Rptr.3d 747, 756-757 (“Bradley”).)  “To prove that the judgment is void, the
party challenging the judgment is limited to the judgment roll, i.e., no
extrinsic evidence is allowed.”  (OC
Interior Services, LLC v. Nationstar Mortgage, LLC (2017) 7 Cal.App.5th
1318, 1327.)  
 
“If the court has
fundamental jurisdiction but exceeds its jurisdiction by acting contrary to its
statutory duties, the judgment is merely voidable, not void.”  (Bradley, supra, 318 Cal.Rptr.3d at
757.)
 
DISCUSSION
 
Nasiry’s
motion is a motion to vacate; however, to get around the automatic stay, he
argues that the FAJ is void.  He contends
several acts by the Department stripped the Court of subject matter
jurisdiction to enter the FAJ.  He claims
the Department:  
 
(1)  withdrew its standing when it voluntarily
dismissed the fifth cause of action (see Motion, p. 5; see also Reply, pp. 7-8
[asserting that the Department needed to “retain a legitimate” real party in
interest, other than the Department, throughout the duration of the case to
maintain standing]);
 
(2) never
received a verified pre-suit complaint (see Motion, pp. 5-7; see also Reply,
pp. 8-9]);
 
(3) failed to
name Khayyam Etemadi and certain car dealerships as indispensable parties (see
Motion, pp. 7-13, 14-15; see also Reply, pp. 4-7); and 
 
(4) violated
due process by failing to name Nasiry in the fifth cause of action and Etemadi
and the dealerships in the first and second causes of action (see Motion, pp.
13-14; see also Reply, pp. 9-10).
 
Points (1) and
(2) fail.  In the appeal of the original
judgment, the Court of Appeal upheld the trial court’s findings against M&N
and Nasiry as to the first and second causes of action.  The Court of Appeal found that the Department
possessed standing to sue M&N and Nasiry and did not need to receive a
verified pre-suit complaint prior to filing the lawsuit.  (See 12/1/23 FAJ, Ex. D, pp. 8-9.)  The Department’s post-appeal voluntary
dismissal of the fifth cause of action, which it had the right to do (see
11/3/23 Ruling Re: Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings, p. 2), did not undo
the Department’s standing vis-à-vis the first and second causes of action and
the rest of the case.  Moreover, upon
receiving the remittitur, this Court had jurisdiction – and the obligation – to
enter the FAJ pursuant to the Court of Appeal’s decision.  (See id. at p. 3.)  Indeed, the Court acted within its jurisdiction
and authority.
 
Points (3) and
(4) also fail.  “Failure to join an ‘indispensable’
party is not ‘a jurisdictional defect’ in the fundamental sense; even in the
absence of an ‘indispensable’ party, the court still has the power to render a
decision as to the parties before it which will stand.”  (Tracy Press, Inc. v. Superior Court
(2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 1290, 1298.)[2]  As for due process, Nasiry’s argument is moot
as to the fifth cause of action given that the Department voluntarily dismissed
it (see, e.g., 11/3/23 Ruling
Re: Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings, pp. 2-3), and he lacks standing to
assert violations on behalf of either Etemadi or the dealerships as to the
first and second causes of action.  In
addition, the purported violations do not appear on the face of the FAJ and
would likely necessitate consideration of extrinsic evidence to resolve.
 
Contrary to
Nasiry’s wordplay, points (1), (2), (3), and (4) do not concern the Court’s
jurisdiction in the fundamental sense. 
None of them establishes that the FAJ is void.  They go to whether the FAJ is voidable, not
void, so the motion to vacate is denied.
 
Nasiry’s
arguments regarding the Model Rules of Professional Conduct, class
certification, and excessive fines do not change the result.  (See Motion, pp. 1, 2.)  The Court agrees with the Department that
they constitute voidable arguments. 
(See, e.g., Opposition, pp. 7-8.) 
Also, the Court of Appeal already determined that the fines are not
excessive.  (See 12/1/23 FAJ, Ex. D, pp.
13-15.)
