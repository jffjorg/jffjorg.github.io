And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the plaintiff, Kelli Scott, granting her motion for interlocutory judgment of partition and appointment of a referee with regards to the Covina property. The property is currently held by the Wheeler Trust and Defendant Dale Carr, who both hold their interests as tenants-in-common. The judge has appointed Matthew L. Taylor as the referee and has ordered Carr to vacate the property within 90 days of service of the court's interlocutory judgment. The judge has also rejected Carr's argument that the referee fees should be solely borne by Scott, concluding that the law requires the costs of partition to be apportioned among the parties in proportion to their interests.
