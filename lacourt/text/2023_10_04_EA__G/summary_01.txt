And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of 23PSCV00504, a breach of lease agreement action. The Gershman Defendants, consisting of Ronald A. Gershman, Catherine J. Gershman, and Gershman Properties LLC, have filed a demurrer to the plaintiff's First Amended Complaint (FAC) and a request for sanctions.

The judge has sustained the demurrer in its entirety, with leave to amend to the first, second, third, fifth, and sixth causes of action, and without leave to amend as to the fourth cause of action. The judge has also denied the request for sanctions without prejudice, as it was not made in a separately noticed motion as required by Code of Civil Procedure section 128.5.

The judge's ruling is based on the following reasons: (1) the Gershman Defendants' demurrer to the first, second, third, and fifth causes of action for breach of contract is sustained, as the plaintiff failed to plead sufficient facts to state a claim and is uncertain; (2) the Gershman Defendants' demurrer to the fourth cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty is sustained, as the plaintiff failed to plead sufficient facts to state a claim and is uncertain; and (3) the Gershman Defendants' demurrer to the sixth cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress is sustained, as the plaintiff's claim is based on allegations surrounding how the Gershman Defendants carried out or failed to carry out their obligations pursuant to the alleged lease agreements, which is uncertain.

The judge has given the plaintiff 10 days to amend its FAC to cure the defects noted in the demurrer.

## English Text Summary:

The judge has ruled on a request by the Defendants (Ronald Gershman, Catherine Gershman, and Gershman Properties LLC) to dismiss the lawsuit brought by the Plaintiff (Yanqiu Zhang).  The Plaintiff is claiming breach of contract and other damages related to a lease agreement for a property in Baldwin Park. 

The judge has decided to partially dismiss the Plaintiff's lawsuit. The Plaintiff has 10 days to amend and resubmit the following claims: breach of contract, injunctive relief, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. However, the Plaintiff's claim for breach of fiduciary duty has been dismissed entirely because the judge found no basis for that claim.

The judge also denied the Defendants' request for sanctions, finding that the request was not properly filed.

And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by the Gershman Defendants to the First Amended Complaint by the Plaintiff, Yanqiu Zhang. The Gershman Defendants are Ronald A. Gershman, Catherine J. Gershman, and Gershman Properties LLC.

The Judge sustains the demurrer with leave to amend to the first, second, third, fifth, and sixth causes of action, and without leave to amend as to the fourth cause of action. The causes of action that the Judge sustains the demurrer to are breach of contract, breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and intentional infliction of emotional distress.

The Judge also denies the request for sanctions in the amount of $3,785 without prejudice for failure to comply with Code of Civil Procedure section 128.5, subdivision (f)(1)(A).

The case involves a breach of lease agreement action, where the Plaintiff, Yanqiu Zhang, alleges that the Gershman Defendants failed to perform their obligations under the lease agreement, including increasing pro rata share of common area maintenance costs and refusing to repair the HVAC system.

The Judge's ruling is based on the legal standard that a demurrer tests whether the complaint states a cause of action, and that a party may demur to a complaint on the grounds that it does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. The Judge also relies on various case citations to support its ruling.

English text:
The tentative ruling for case number 23PSCV00504, scheduled for hearing on October 4, 2023, is as follows. The defendants' demurrer to the plaintiff's first amended complaint is sustained with leave to amend for the first, second, third, fifth, and sixth causes of action, and without leave to amend for the fourth cause of action. The defendants' request for sanctions is denied without prejudice for failure to comply with Code of Civil Procedure section 128.5, subdivision (f)(1)(A). The plaintiff, Yanqiu Zhang, alleges breach of lease agreement, breach of written lease agreement, failure of consideration and failure to perform, injunctive relief, breach of fiduciary duty, breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and intentional infliction of emotional distress against the defendants, Gershman Properties, Ronald A. Gershman, and Catherine J. Gershman. The defendants argue that the plaintiff's complaint fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action and is uncertain. The court agrees. The plaintiff has failed to provide a copy of the actual lease agreement that she assumed, leading to uncertainty in the contractual obligations of the parties, particularly in regard to repair or maintenance obligations. The plaintiff also lacks standing to bring the action, as the lease agreement was between Gershman Properties and KC International Inc., and the plaintiff only signed a guaranty of lease. Lastly, only Gershman Properties appears to be a party to the lease agreement. The court sustains the defendants' demurrer to the plaintiff's fourth cause of action without leave to amend, as the plaintiff has not alleged the existence of any other type of relationship that could qualify as a fiduciary relationship. The plaintiff's IIED claim is also based on allegations surrounding how the defendants carried out or failed to carry out their obligations pursuant to the alleged lease agreements, and her failure to adequately allege those contractual claims also dooms her IIED claim. The defendants' request for sanctions is denied without prejudice for failure to comply with Code of Civil Procedure section 128.5, subdivision (f)(1)(A).
