And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of 23PSCV00504, a breach of lease agreement action. The Gershman Defendants, consisting of Ronald A. Gershman, Catherine J. Gershman, and Gershman Properties LLC, have filed a demurrer to the plaintiff's First Amended Complaint (FAC) and a request for sanctions.

The judge has sustained the demurrer in its entirety, with leave to amend to the first, second, third, fifth, and sixth causes of action, and without leave to amend as to the fourth cause of action. The judge has also denied the request for sanctions without prejudice, as it was not made in a separately noticed motion as required by Code of Civil Procedure section 128.5.

The judge's ruling is based on the following reasons: (1) the Gershman Defendants' demurrer to the first, second, third, and fifth causes of action for breach of contract is sustained, as the plaintiff failed to plead sufficient facts to state a claim and is uncertain; (2) the Gershman Defendants' demurrer to the fourth cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty is sustained, as the plaintiff failed to plead sufficient facts to state a claim and is uncertain; and (3) the Gershman Defendants' demurrer to the sixth cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress is sustained, as the plaintiff's claim is based on allegations surrounding how the Gershman Defendants carried out or failed to carry out their obligations pursuant to the alleged lease agreements, which is uncertain.

The judge has given the plaintiff 10 days to amend its FAC to cure the defects noted in the demurrer.
