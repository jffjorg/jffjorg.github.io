Assignee’s request is GRANTED pursuant to Evidence Code section 452, subdivision (c). Assignee also requests judicial notice of two provisions of the Corporations Code. Assignee’s request is GRANTED pursuant to Evidence Code section 452, subdivision (a).AnalysisAssignee moves the Court for an order (1) charging the interest, if any of, Defendants/Judgment Debtors Eric Cutujian and Roger Cutan (“Defendants”) in the limited liability company Rockrose Capital LLC with the unsatisfied portion of the judgment entered in this action, as renewed, inclusive of principal, post-judgment interest and post-judgment costs, which, as of May 21, 2024, was $835,272.95, and (2) directing that Rockrose Capital LLC and its constituent members pay any sums due to Defendants as a result of their interest in Rockrose Capital LLC directly to Assignee’s client trust account with Assignee’s counsel until the amount necessary to satisfy the judgment entered in this action, including principal, post-judgment interest, and costs of enforcement, is paid in full.Code of Civil Procedure section 708.310 provides that “[i]f a money judgment is rendered against a partner or member but not against the partnership or limited liability company, the judgment debtor’s interest in the partnership or limited liability company may be applied toward the satisfaction of the judgment by an order charging the judgment debtor's interest pursuant to Section 15907.03, 16504, or 17705.03 of the Corporations Code.” Code of Civil Procedure section 708.320, subdivision (a), further states that “[a] lien on a judgment debtor’s interest in a partnership or limited liability company is created by service of a notice of motion for a charging order on the judgment debtor and on either of the following: [¶] (1) All partners or the partnership. [¶] (2) All members or the limited liability company,” and subdivision (b) of Code of Civil Procedure section 708.320 provides that “[i]f a charging order is issued, the lien created pursuant to subdivision (a) continues under the terms of the order,” and “[i]f issuance of the charging order is denied, the lien is extinguished.” Corporations Code section 16504, subdivision (a) and (b), provide that the court may issue an order charging the judgment debtor’s partnership interest to satisfy the judgment, and the charging order constitutes a lien on the judgment debtor’s transferable interest in the partnership.Assignee provides evidence that Defendants are members of Rockrose Capital LLC, as the Articles of Organization and Statement of Information for that entity bear signatures which appears to have been drawn by the same hand as the signatory to the declaration of Eric Cutujian filed with this Court on November 8, 2023, and Defendants may become entitled to a distribution from Rockrose Capital LLC, such that a charging order should issue for Rockrose Capital LLC to pay any such funds owed to Defendants directly to Assignee to satisfy the judgment. (Mot., Req. for Judical Notice, Exs. 1, 2; Aires Decl. ¶ 5.) Rockrose Capital LLC opposes the motion on the ground that Assignee relies on Corporations Code section 17302, which was repealed, and the Court lacks jurisdiction over Rockrose Capital LLC. First, Code of Civil Procedure section 708.310 provides authority to issue a charging order as requested here, and the Court is not inclined to deny the motion simply because Assignee cites a repealed statute where other legal authority allows for the same relief. As to jurisdiction, there is no basis to conclude that Rockrose Capital LLC must be a party to this action, and Rockrose Capital LLC cites no authority to that effect. Thus, the Court finds there is a sufficient basis to issue a charging order here. Accordingly, Assignee of Record SMS Financial XI, LLC’s Motion for Order Charging Membership Interest of Judgment Debtors Eric Cutujian and Roger Cutan in Limited Liability Company [Rockrose Capital LLC] is GRANTED. The interest, if any of, Defendants/Judgment Debtors Eric Cutujian and Roger Cutan (“Defendants”) in the limited liability company Rockrose Capital LLC shall be charged with the unsatisfied portion of the judgment entered in this action, as renewed, inclusive of principal, post-judgment interest and post-judgment costs, which, as of May 21, 2024, was $835,272.95, and Rockrose Capital LLC and its constituent members shall pay any sums due to Defendants as a result of their interest in Rockrose Capital LLC directly to Assignee’s client trust account with Assignee’s counsel until the amount necessary to satisfy the judgment entered in this action, including principal, post-judgment interest, and costs of enforcement, is paid in full.
