Here is the English text summary:

The tentative ruling denies the defendants' motion for an order to show cause why Attorney Karen Rooney should not be held in contempt of this Court's March 4, 2024, Order. The defendants, Sara Van Horn and Patrick Van Horn, had requested that the court impose monetary sanctions against Rooney in the amount of at least $10,000.00. The court found that Rooney did not willfully disobey the court's order, as she submitted a counter-affidavit stating that she personally mailed the defendants' counsel a check on her firm account. The court also noted that the defendants failed to meet their burden to demonstrate that Rooney willfully disobeyed the court's order.
