This tentative ruling grants the Motion for Summary Judgment filed by Plaintiff Omninet Kipling, L.P. against Defendants Asha M. Graves, et al.

The Plaintiff alleges that the Defendants breached the lease agreement by failing to pay rent and other charges due under the lease.

The burden now shifts to the Defendants to show a triable issue of material fact, which they have failed to do. Therefore, the motion for summary judgment is granted.
