And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge denies the defendant's motion to compel arbitration in this lemon law action. The defendant relies on an arbitration provision in the purchase agreement between the plaintiff and the dealer. The defendant argues that equitable estoppel applies because the plaintiff's claims arise out of the underlying contract and the defendant's conduct is intertwined with the plaintiff's conduct. However, the judge finds that the plaintiff's warranty-based claims do not rely on and are not inextricably intertwined with the subject purchase agreement, and therefore equitable estoppel does not apply. Additionally, the judge finds that the defendant is not a third-party beneficiary who can enforce arbitration because it is not listed in the group of individuals/entities who must arbitrate.
