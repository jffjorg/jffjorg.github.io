This is a lemon law action.  Defendant Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC seeks to compel arbitration based on an arbitration provision found in the purchase agreement between Plaintiff and the dealer.  As a non-signatory, Defendant bases its Motion on equitable estoppel and third-party beneficiary status. The subject arbitration provision is as follows:Any claim or dispute, whether in contract, tort, statute or otherwise (including the interpretation and scope of this Arbitration Provision, and the arbitrability of the claim or dispute), between you and us or our employees, agents, successors or assigns, which arises out of or relates to your credit application, purchase or condition of this vehicle, this contract or any resulting transaction or relationship (including any such relationship with third parties who do not sign this contract) shall, at your or our election, be resolved by neutral, binding arbitration and not by a court action. (Ameripour Decl., Exhibit 2.)Equitable EstoppelDefendant argues that equitable estoppel applies because the signatory's claims against a nonsignatory arise out of the underlying contract and the nonsignatory’s conduct is intertwined with a signatory's conduct.  (Mance v. MercedesBenz USA (N.D. Cal. 2012) 901 F.Supp.2d 1147, 1155–56; MS Dealer Service Corp. v. Franklin (11th Cir. 1999) 177 F.3d 942, 947.)  Defendant primarily relies on Felisilda v. FCA US LLC (2020) 53 Cal.App.5th 486.Under the doctrine of equitable estoppel in “both federal and California decisional authority, a nonsignatory defendant may invoke an arbitration clause to compel a signatory plaintiff to arbitrate its claims when the causes of action against the nonsignatory are ‘intimately founded in and intertwined’ with the underlying contract obligations.”  (Boucher v. Alliance Title Co., Inc. (2005) 127 Cal.App.4th 262, 271.)  “By relying on contract terms in a claim against a nonsignatory defendant, even if not exclusively, a plaintiff may be equitably estopped from repudiating the arbitration clause contained in that agreement.”  (Id. at p. 272.)  “[I]f a plaintiff relies on the terms of an agreement to assert his or her claims against a nonsignatory defendant, the plaintiff may be equitably estopped from repudiating the arbitration clause of that very agreement. In other words, a signatory to an agreement with an arbitration clause cannot ‘ “ ‘have it both ways’ ” ’; the signatory ‘cannot, on the one hand, seek to hold the non-signatory liable pursuant to duties imposed by the agreement, which contains an arbitration provision, but, on the other hand, deny arbitration's applicability because the defendant is a non-signatory.’ ” (Goldman v. KPMG, LLP (2009) 173 Cal.App.4th 209, 220.)   Here, equitable estoppel does not apply because Plaintiff’s warranty-based claims do not rely on and are not inextricably intertwined with the subject purchase agreement.  (Ford Motor Warranty Cases (2023) 89 Cal.App.5th 1324, 1336 [“Plaintiffs’ claims in no way rely on the sale contracts. Equitable estoppel does not apply.”]; Montemayor v. Ford Motor Co. (Cal. Ct. App. June 26, 2023) No. B320477, 2023 WL 4181909, at *7 [“We look to the facts alleged in the complaint to determine whether the Montemayors’ claims against Ford are dependent on and inextricably intertwined with the obligations imposed by the sales contract. [ ] They are not. As discussed, the Montemayors allege as part of each cause of action against Ford at issue on appeal that Ford's obligations arose out of its express written warranty, not the sales contract.”].)     (b) Third-Party Beneficiary“A contract, made expressly for the benefit of a third person, may be enforced by him at any time before the parties thereto rescind it.”  (Civ. Code § 1559.)“The test for determining whether a contract was made for the benefit of a third person is whether an intent to benefit a third person appears from the terms of the contract. [Citation.] If the terms of the contract necessarily require the promisor to confer a benefit on a third person, then the contract, and hence the parties thereto, contemplate a benefit to the third person. The parties are presumed to intend the consequences of a performance of the contract.”  (Johnson v. Holmes Tuttle Lincoln–Merc. (1958) 160 Cal.App.2d 290, 297.)  In other words, “the doctrine presupposes that the defendant made a promise which, if performed, would have benefited the third party.”  (Souza v. Westlands Water Dist. (2006) 135 Cal.App.4th 879, 891.)Here, Defendant is not a third-party beneficiary who can enforce arbitration because it is not listed in the group of individuals/entities who must arbitrate; rather, the subject arbitration provision only mentions third-parties when describing the types of claims which are to be arbitrated.  (Schulz v. BMW of N. Am., LLC (N.D. Cal. 2020) 472 F.Supp.3d 632, 641.)“First, nothing in the sale contracts or their arbitration provision offers any direct ‘benefit’ to [the manufacturer] (Goonewardene, supra, 6 Cal.5th at p. 830, 243 Cal.Rptr.3d 299, 434 P.3d 124). . . . Second, there is no indication that a benefit to [the manufacturer] was the signatories’ ‘motivating purpose’ (Goonewardene, supra, 6 Cal.5th at p. 830, 243 Cal.Rptr.3d 299, 434 P.3d 124) in contracting for the sale and purchase of a [ ] vehicle. The manifest intent of the parties was to buy, sell and finance a car, and to allow either the purchaser or the dealer to compel arbitration of the specified categories of disputes between them, or between the purchaser and any of the dealer's “employees, agents, successors or assigns.”  (Ford Motor Warranty Cases (2023) 89 Cal.App.5th 1324, 1338-39; see also Montemayor v. Ford Motor Co. (Cal. Ct. App. June 26, 2023) No. B320477, 2023 WL 4181909, at *9-10.) In sum, because Defendant is a non-signatory—who cannot compel arbitration—the Motion is denied.  The Requests for Judicial Notice are granted.  Moving party to give notice.If counsel do not submit on the tentative, they are strongly encouraged to appear by LACourtConnect rather than in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
