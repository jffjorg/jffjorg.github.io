BACKGROUND
            This action arises from the alleged
breach of a lease agreement concerning residential real property located at
4077 W. 3rd Street, #230, Los Angeles, CA 90020 (the “Premises”). On May 19,
2023, Plaintiff Omninet Kipling, L.P. (“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint for
Damages for Breach of Written Lease against Defendants Asha M. Graves, Wendell
J. Graves (collectively “Defendants”), and DOES 1 through 20, inclusive,
alleging a sole cause of action for Breach of Lease. 
            The Complaint alleges the following:
on or about June 16, 2022, Plaintiff, as landlord, entered into a written lease
agreement (the “Lease”) with Defendants, as tenants, concerning the Premises.
(Complaint, ¶ 7.) Pursuant to Paragraph 6 of the Lease, Defendants are
obligated to pay monthly base rent of $1,430.00 for the term of the Lease, plus
additional charges due under the Lease. (Complaint, ¶ 9.) Plaintiff alleges
that Defendants breached the Lease in or about August 2022 by, among other
things, failing to pay rent and other charges due under the Lease. (Complaint,
¶ 11.)  
            On June 6, 2023, Defendant Wendell
J. Graves filed an Answer—Unlawful Detainer to the Complaint.  
            On July 5, 2023, default was entered
against Defendant Asha M. Graves. 
            On March 8, 2024, Plaintiff filed
and served the instant Motion for Summary Judgment. 
            As of May 24, 2024, the motion for
summary judgment is unopposed. Any opposition to the motion for summary
judgment was required to have been filed and served at least nine court days
prior to the hearing. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1005, subd. (b).) 
 
DISCUSSION
Applicable Law
The function of a motion for summary judgment or adjudication is
to allow a determination as to whether an opposing party cannot show
evidentiary support for a pleading or claim and to enable an order of summary
dismissal without the need for trial. (Aguilar
v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.) Code Civ. Proc. §
437c(c) “requires the trial judge to grant summary judgment if all the evidence
submitted, and all inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence and
uncontradicted by other inferences or evidence, show that there is no triable
issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment
as a matter of law.” (Adler v. Manor
Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.) “The function of the
pleadings in a motion for summary judgment is to delimit the scope of the
issues; the function of the affidavits or declarations is to disclose whether
there is any triable issue of fact within the issues delimited by the
pleadings.” (Juge v. County of Sacramento
(1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 59, 67.)
“A plaintiff . . . has met his or her burden of showing there is
no defense to a cause of action if that party has proved each element of the
cause of action entitling the party to judgment on that cause of action.” (Troyk
v. Farmers Group, Inc. (2009) 171 Cal.App.4th 1305, 1320.) A plaintiff is
not required “to disprove any defense asserted by the defendant as well as
prove each element of his own cause of action.” (WRI Opportunity Loans II,
LLC v. Cooper (2007) 154 Cal.App.4th 525, 531-32.) “Once the plaintiff
makes an adequate initial showing, the burden shifts to the defendant to show a
triable issue of fact as to that cause of action or a defense thereto.” (Id.
at p. 532.) Thus, the analysis of a summary judgment motion consists of the
following three steps “(1) identifying the issues framed by the complaint, (2)
determining whether the moving party has made an adequate showing that negates
the opponent’s claim, and (3) determining whether the opposing party has raised
a triable issue of fact.” (Id. at p. 531.) 
“The procedures governing a motion for summary judgment in an
unlawful detainer action are streamlined (e.g., separate statements are not
required under section 437c, subdivision (s) of the Code of Civil Procedure,
but such a motion shall be granted or denied on the same basis as a motion
under [Code of Civil Procedure s]ection 437c.” (Borden v. Stiles (2023)
92 Cal.App.5th 337, 344-45.)
Analysis
            “The essential elements of a claim of breach of contract,
whether express or implied, are the contract, plaintiff’s performance or excuse
for nonperformance, defendant’s breach, and the resulting damages to
plaintiff.” (San Mateo Union High School Dist. v. County of San Mateo (2013)
213 Cal.App.4th 418, 439.) 
            Plaintiff presents the following undisputed material
facts: on June 16, 2022, Plaintiff and Defendants entered into the Lease, and
Plaintiff is the current owner of the Premises and lessor. (UMF No. 1.)
Pursuant to Paragraph 6 of the Lease, Defendants were and are currently
obligated to pay monthly base rent of $1,430.00 and Defendants are also
responsible for paying all utilities except electricity pursuant to Paragraph 7
of the Lease. (UMF No. 2.) Plaintiff has performed all conditions of the Lease
required of it except those conditions which Plaintiff’s nonperformance thereof
was excused or justified. (UMF No. 3.) Defendants’ failure to pay, among other
things, the rent due under the Lease has excused Plaintiff from any other
obligations under the Lease. (UMF No. 3.) In or about August 2022 and
continuing thereafter, Defendants breached the Lease by, among other things,
failing to pay rent and other charges due under the Lease. (UMF No. 4.) The
total billed unpaid rental damages—base rent and utilities—through March 1,
2024 is $18,907.11, exclusive of attorneys’ fees and costs. (UMF No. 5.) 
            Plaintiff has met its burden in showing the existence of
each element for its cause of action for breach of lease. The burden now shifts
to Defendants to show a triable issue of material fact. 
            Given that the instant motion is unopposed, Defendants
have not met their burden in showing a triable issue of material fact.
Moreover, because Defendants have failed to oppose the motion, Defendants have
conceded to the arguments raised therein as “[c]ontentions are waived when a
party fails to support them with reasoned argument and citations to authority.”
(Moulton Niguel Water Dist. v. Colombo (2003) 111 Cal.App.4th 1210,
1215.) 
            Accordingly, the motion for summary judgment is GRANTED. 

CONCLUSION
The Motion for Summary Judgment is
GRANTED.  
Plaintiff
to give notice.           
If counsel do not submit on the tentative,
they are strongly encouraged to appear by LACourtConnect rather than in person
due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
