And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has granted Cross-Defendant Elizabeth Amaya's motion to expunge the Notice of Pendency of Action recorded on December 14, 2020. The Judge has also awarded Cross-Defendant reasonable attorney fees and costs in the amount of $3000.00. The Judge's decision is based on the fact that Cross-Complainant Elaine Watrous did not meet her burden of proof to show that the lis pendens is supported by a real property claim that is probably valid. The Judge has determined that the real property claim asserted by Cross-Complainant is a claim to quiet title, but the necessary elements for a quiet title cause of action were not satisfied. The Judge has also determined that Cross-Defendant's motion to expunge the lis pendens is granted because Cross-Complainant did not address any of the elements of quiet title.
