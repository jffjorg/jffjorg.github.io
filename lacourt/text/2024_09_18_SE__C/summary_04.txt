The parties entered into a settlement agreement on December 20, 2023, and a stipulated judgment was entered to give the court jurisdiction to enforce the settlement. However, the defendants defaulted on the settlement agreement by failing to make the June 2024 settlement installment payments and have not made any payments since May 2024. The judge has granted the motion to enforce the settlement agreement based on this default.
