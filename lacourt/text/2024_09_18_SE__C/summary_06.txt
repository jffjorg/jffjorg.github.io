And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Jennifer Bagosy's motion to withdraw as counsel for plaintiff Maria Elena Villanueva. The motion is unopposed and the judge finds that good cause exists to grant the motion based on the breakdown in the attorney-client relationship. The judge cites Rule 3-700(C) of the Rules of Professional Conduct, which allows an attorney to withdraw if the client insists on pursuing a claim or defense that is not warranted under existing law, or if the client seeks to pursue an illegal course of conduct. The judge notes that the attorney declaration demonstrates good cause for withdrawal based on the "irreparable" breakdown in the attorney-client relationship. The judge orders Jennifer Bagosy to give notice of her withdrawal as counsel.
