* Hearing Date: September 18, 2024
* Dept: C
* Parties:
  * Plaintiff: Alfred Zuniga (represented by Robert Zuniga, successor-in-interest)
  * Defendant: PIH Health Whittier Hospital, et al.

**Facts**

* Plaintiff, Alfred Zuniga, died while in the care of Defendant PIH Health Whittier Hospital and other medical providers in January 2023.
* Plaintiff alleged that Defendant failed to adequately and timely address his symptoms, which led to his death.
* Plaintiff brought claims for dependent adult abuse and neglect, negligence, negligent hiring, supervision, and retention, professional negligence, and wrongful death.

**Disputes**

* Defendant PIH Health Whittier Hospital demurred to the first and third causes of action, alleging that they fail to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action and are uncertain.
* Defendant also moved to strike attorney fees and costs and exemplary damages.

**Ruling**

* The demurrer to the first cause of action (dependent adult abuse and neglect) is OVERRULED.
* The demurrer to the third cause of action (negligent hiring, supervision, and retention) is OVERRULED.
* The motion to strike attorney fees and costs and exemplary damages is DENIED.

**Key Points**

* Plaintiff adequately pleaded dependent adult abuse and neglect, alleging that Defendant failed to provide adequate care and attention to Plaintiff's needs, leading to his death.
* Plaintiff also adequately pleaded negligent hiring, supervision, and retention, alleging that Defendant hired and retained employees who were unfit to perform their job duties, which contributed to Plaintiff's death.
* The Court found that the prayer for attorney's fees and costs and punitive damages was proper, as Plaintiff alleged recklessness and conscious disregard of patient care needs.

**Significant Statements**

* "A robust caretaking or custodial relationship - that is a relationship where a certain party has assumed a significant measure of responsibility for attending to one or more of an elder's basic needs that an able-bodied and fully competent adult would ordinarily be capable of managing without assistance." (Winn v. Pioneer Medical Group, Inc. (2016) 63 Cal. 4th 148)
* "An undetected and untreated bile leak caused by an iatrogenic common bile duct injury poses a serious threat to life. A person who suffers an untreated bile leak is at risk of developing bile peritonitis, which can further progress to sepsis and death, as was the case with Mr. Zuniga." (Compl., Â¶ 62)
