TENTATIVE RULING
 
Defendant Salvation
Army’s Motion to Compel Further Deposition Testimony from Plaintiff is GRANTED
in part and DENIED in part as set forth below.  No monetary sanctions are imposed. 
 
Plaintiff to give NOTICE.

 
 
Background
 
This
is a child sexual assault case against a pastor. Defendant Salvation Army moves
to compel further deposition answers from Plaintiff John Doe OQ. 
 
Separate Statement
 
Motions
to compel deposition answers must be accompanied by a separate statement
containing the requests and the responses, verbatim, as well as reasons why a
further response is warranted. (California Rule of Court, rule 3.1345(a).) The
separate statement must also be complete in itself; no extrinsic materials may
be incorporated by reference. (California Rule of Court, rule 3.1345(c).)
 
Here, Defendant included a separate statement.

 
Timeliness
 
The
motion to compel must be “made no later than 60 days after the completion of
the record of the deposition.” (Code Civ. Pro., § 2025.480(b).) The 60-day time
limit runs from the date objections are served because the deposition record is
then complete. (Rutledge v.
Hewlett-Packard Co. (2015) 238 Cal.App.4th 1164, 1192.) 
 
The
parties completed the deposition on December 15, 2023. (Decl. Cope, ¶ 7, Ex. K.)
Defendant filed the instant motion on February 1, 2024. Thus, the motion is
timely. 
 
Meet and Confer
 
The
motion shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Code of
Civil Procedure section 2016.040. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.480, subd. (b).)
Code of Civil Procedure section 2016.040 states that a meet and confer
declaration in support of a motion shall state facts showing a reasonable and
good faith attempt at an informal resolution of each issue presented by the
motion. 
 
The
parties adequately met and conferred. (Decl. McGrath, ¶¶ 11-14.) 
 
Certified Copy of Transcript Required to Compel
Specific Answers at Deposition
 
The
statute requires a “certified copy” of “any parts” of the transcript lodged.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.480, subd. (h).) The moving party must “lodge” with
the court, at least 5 days before the hearing on the motion, a certified copy
of whatever parts of the transcript are relevant to the motion.
 
Defendants
have not lodged with the court a certified copy of the parts of the transcript
that are relevant to the motion. However, defendants have attached certified
copies as part of their declaration to the motion. (Decl. Cope, ¶ 5, Ex. B.) 
 
Legal
Standard
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.480
permits a party to seek a motion to compel deposition answers where a deponent
fails to answer any question or produce any document, electronically stored
information, or tangible thing under the deponent's control. The court shall
order the production or answer to be given if it determines that the matter
sought is subject to discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.480, subd. (i).) As
with discovery generally, questions may relate to “any matter, not privileged,
that is relevant to the subject matter … if the matter either is
itself admissible in evidence or appears reasonably calculated
to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
2017.010.)
 
Deponents
are to answer deposition questions unless they pertain to privileged matters,
or improper matters revealing a motive to harass or annoy, and “witnesses are
expected to endure an occasional irrelevant question without disrupting the
deposition process.” (Stewart v. Colonial Western Agency, Inc. (2001)
87 Cal.App.4th 1006, 1015.)
 
Discussion
 
Defendant
seeks to compel further testimony regarding Plaintiff’s misdemeanor DUI
conviction, the status of his driver’s license, and Plaintiff’s settlement
payments.
Plaintiff’s
Misdemeanor DUI Conviction
 
The
following questions pertaining to Plaintiff’s misdemeanor DUI conviction are at
issue:
 
·       
Question
No. 6: Q: Thank you. If we can go to page 10 in the group, please. There’s a
question about convictions of felony or misdemeanors, and you wrote in here
that you had a DUI in 2001. (Def. Exh. B-Depo Vol. I at 93:6-9)
·       
Question
No. 7: Q: Have you ever been convicted of drunk driving? (Def. Exh. B-Depo Vol.
I at 94:10-11.) 
·       
Question
No. 8: Q: Okay. And were you ever arrested or charged with drunk driving? (Def.
Exh. B-Depo Vol. I at 95:13-14.) 
·       
Question
No. 12: Q: Other than the DUI in 2001, have you ever suffered any kind of
criminal conviction? (Def. Exh. B-Depo Vol. I at 132:16-17.)
 
Plaintiff
does not oppose questions relating to felony DUI convictions, but Plaintiff
contends that questions relating to misdemeanor convictions are barred.  Plaintiff does not cite any authority, and
the Court is aware of none, imposing a categorical bar on the admissibility of
misdemeanor convictions.  Plaintiff
correctly points out that only felony convictions are admissible under Evidence
Code § 788, but that section involves impeaching the credibility of a
witness.  Defendant argues that questions
relating to Plaintiff’s misdemeanor DUI conviction are relevant because
Plaintiff has put his alcohol abuse at issue. 
The Court agrees.  Question No. 12
is not limited to DUI convictions, so it will not be compelled.
 
The motion to compel responses to Question Nos.
6, 7, and 8 is GRANTED.  The motion to
compel response to Question No. 12 is DENIED.

 
Plaintiff
Driving Without a License
 
The
following questions pertaining to Plaintiff driving without a license are at
issue:
 
·       
Question
No. 1: Q: And what happened to your California driver’s license? (Def. Exh.
B-Depo Vol. I at at 36:2.) 
·       
Question
No. 2: Q: Did you voluntarily give up your California driver’s license? (Def.
Exh. BDepo Vol. I at 36:12-13.) 
·       
Question
No. 3: Q: So do you drive illegally without a license all the time? (Def. Exh.
B-Depo Vol. I at 37:19-20.) 
·       
Question
No. 4: Q: Do you drive without a license on a regular basis? (Def. Exh. B-Depo
Vol. I at 37:24-25) 
·       
Question
No. 5: Q: Did you lose your license because of a criminal conviction? (Def.
Exh. BDepo Vol. I at 38:3-4.) 
·       
Question
No. 13: Q: Did you lose your driver’s license because of a criminal conviction?
(Def. Exh. K-Depo Vol. II at 288:2-3.) 
·       
Question
No. 14: Q: Did you drive here today? (Def. Exh. K-Depo Vol. II at 288:11.)
 
Plaintiff
argues that questions about the status of his driver’s license are irrelevant,
and they are merely a “back door” attempt to inquire about Plaintiff’s 2001 DUI
conviction.  However, the Court has
determined that questions relating to Plaintiff’s misdemeanor DUI conviction
are proper.  As to relevance, Defendant
argues that Plaintiff’s ability to drive or commute are at issue because
Plaintiff maintains that as a result of the alleged abuse, he is unable to
perform daily activities or obtain full enjoyment of life.  The Court determines that questions relating
to the status of Plaintiff’s driver’s license are within the scope of
discovery.  Question No. 3 will not be
allowed because it is argumentative.  
 
The
motion to compel responses to Question Nos. 1, 2, 4, 5, 13 and 14 is
GRANTED.  The motion to compel response
to Question No. 3 is DENIED.
 
Plaintiff’s
Settlement of Automobile Accidents
 
The
following questions pertaining to Plaintiff’s settlement of automobile
accidents are at issue:
 
·       
Question
No. 9: Q: And did you get a settlement? A: Yes. Q: How much? Def. Exh. B- (Depo
Vol. I at 129:4-6.) 
·       
Question
No. 10: Q: Okay. And did you get a settlement from that accident? A: Yes. Q:
How much? (Def. Exh. B-Depo Vol. I at 130:8-11.) 
·       
Question
No. 11: Q: And did you get a settlement from that accident claim? A: Yes. Q:
How much? (Def. Exh. B-Depo Vol. I at 131:11-14.) 
·       
Question
No. 17: Q: Okay. And what were the amounts of the settlements that you can
recall? (Def. Exh. K-Depo Vol. II at 290:23-24.)
 
Defendant
argues that questions relating to Plaintiff’s settlement agreements are
relevant “to the extent he received payments from settlements and those
payments included compensation for any emotional distress he might have
suffered as a result of the car accident that may offset emotional distress
claims in this current action.” (SS, Question No. 9.) However, these questions
are not limited to accidents involving the use of alcohol, nor do they involve
emotional distress damages arising from alleged sexual abuse.  The Court determines that questions
pertaining to Plaintiff’s settlement of automobile accidents are not reasonably
calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.  
 
The
motion to compel responses to Question Nos. 9, 10, 11, and 17 is DENIED.  
 
Sanctions
 
Monetary
sanctions are mandatory against an unsuccessful moving or opposing party unless
they acted with substantial justification or imposition of sanctions would be
unjust. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.480, subd. (j).)
 
Given
the mixed ruling, no sanctions are imposed.
