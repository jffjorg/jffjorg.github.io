Moving Party to give
NOTICE.
 
 
 
Background
 
Dora Gonzalez sues Lee Lewi for the alleged
fraudulent acts of forging documents, obtaining loans, and unlawfully evicting her
from the real property located at 10813 Roseton Avenue, Santa Fe Springs,
California 90670. 
 
Cross-Complainant Elaine Watrous, Successor
Trustee of the Dora Gonzalez Living Trust sues Dora Gonzales and Elizabeth
Amaya for cancellation of grant deed and quiet title. 
 
Cross-Defendant Elizabeth Amaya moves this
Court for an order expunging the Notice of Pendency of Action that was recorded
in the Los Angeles County Recorder’s Office by Cross-Complainant Lee Lewis on
December 14, 2020. Cross-Defendant also requests attorney fees. 
 
Legal Standard
 
A lis pendens is an instrument recorded
in the office of the county recorder that gives constructive notice of a
pending lawsuit affecting title to the real property described in the lis
pendens. (Gale v. Super. Ct. (2004) 122 Cal.App.4th 1388, 1395.)
The pleadings in the lawsuit to which the lis pendens refers must
describe a specific parcel of real property and must state a “real property
claim.” (Ibid.; Code Civ. Proc., § 405.1.) For purposes of
expunging a lis pendens, a real property claim is a cause of action that
if successful, would affect title to or the right of possession of specific
real property or the use of an easement identified in a pleading. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 405.4; Civ. Code, §§ 405.2, 405.4.) 
 
Where a motion to expunge a lis pendens
has been filed, the proponent of the lis pendens carries the burden of
showing evidence that the lis pendens is supported by a real property
claim which is probably valid. (Code Civ. Proc., § 405.32; Hunting
World, Inc. v. Super. Ct. (1994) 22 Cal.App.4th 67, 70-71.)  Where a
party does not establish the probable validity of her claim underpinning a lis
pendens by a preponderance of the evidence, the lis pendens shall be
expunged. (Code Civ. Proc., § 405.32.) 
 
Discussion
 
A real property claim is a cause of action
that, if successful, would affect title to or the right of possession of
specific real property or the use of an easement identified in a
pleading. (Code Civ. Proc., § 405.4.)  For example, quiet title and a
suit to set aside a fraudulent conveyance of real property are actions that
affect title or possession of real property. (Code Civ. Proc., § 761.010; Kirkeby
v. Super. Ct. (2004) 33 Cal.4th 642, 649.)  Here, the cross-complaint
includes a real property claim because the cross-complaint seeks to quiet title
to the property, based on the order of the superior court, attached as Exhibit C,
and recorded in the Official Records of the County of Los Angeles on July
7,2017, document number 20170840299. 
 
For purposes of a motion to expunge notice of
lis pendens, a claimant has the burden of proving that there exists a real
property claim and that the claim is probably valid.  (See Code Civ.
Proc., § 405.32.)  She “thus has the burden of producing sufficient
evidence to support a finding that [she] will ‘probably’ win at trial.”  (See
Weil and Brown, Civ. Proc. Before Trial (2018) § 9:430.) The court then
evaluates the merits of the case based on the evidence of the record. (Amalgamated
Bank v. Super. Ct. (2007) 149 Cal.App.4th 1003, 1012.) 
 
Here, the real property claim asserted is a claim to quiet
title. The necessary elements for a quiet title cause of action are the
following: (1) a description of the property; (2) the plaintiff's title or interest
and the basis; (3) the defendant is asserting an adverse claim or antagonistic
property interest; (4) the date as of which the determination is sought; and
(5) a prayer for determination of title. (Code Civ. Proc., §761.020; see Lewis
v. Super. Ct. (1994) 30 Cal.App.4th 1850, 1866.)
 
In the opposition, Cross-Complainant states that she can establish that
the original grant deed was void; and therefore, the trust has the superior
interest in the subject property. She also states that dismissal without
prejudice is not a final judgment and even if the Court views the dismissal as
a final judgment, it is unmeritorious because the dismissal was for lack of
prosecution. 
 
However, Cross-Complainant did not address any of the elements of quiet
title. Thus, Cross-Complainant did not meet her burden of proof.  
 
Cross-Defendant’s Motion to Expunge Lis Pendens is GRANTED.  
 
Attorney
Fees
 
The court must award the prevailing party “reasonable attorney’s fees
and costs of making or opposing the motion” unless the losing “party acted with
substantial justification or other circumstances make the imposition of
attorney’s fees and costs unjust.”  Code Civ. Proc., § 405.38.  
 
Cross-Defendant’s requests
$7,487.26 in attorney fees and costs associated with the motion to expunge the
lis pendens. (Decl. Dotson, ¶ 29.) Cross-Defendant’s counsel states that he
spent 13.92 hours preparing the motion, anticipates spending 20 minutes
reviewing the opposition, and 45 minutes at the court hearing. (Decl. Dotson, ¶
27.) 
 
Although Cross-Defendant
is the prevailing party, the Court did not make any factual findings because
Cross-Complainant did not submit any evidence to meet her burden of proof.  The Court, in its discretion, imposes
sanctions in the amount of $3000.00 upon Cross-Defendant and Counsel, jointly
and severally, payable within 60 days.
