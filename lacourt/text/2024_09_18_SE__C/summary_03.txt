And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on Defendant Salvation Army's motion to compel further deposition testimony from Plaintiff John Doe. The court grants the motion in part and denies it in part.

The court rules that Defendant's questions about Plaintiff's misdemeanor DUI conviction are proper and grants the motion to compel responses to those questions. The court also rules that Defendant's questions about the status of Plaintiff's driver's license are within the scope of discovery and grants the motion to compel responses to those questions.

However, the court denies the motion to compel responses to questions about Plaintiff's settlement of automobile accidents, finding that those questions are not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.

Finally, the court declines to impose monetary sanctions on either party, finding that the mixed ruling does not warrant sanctions.
