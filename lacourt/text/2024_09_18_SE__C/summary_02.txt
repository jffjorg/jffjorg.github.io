And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendants' motion to strike the punitive damages allegations in the plaintiff's second amended complaint. The defendants had argued that the allegations assume a duty to proactively restrain the patient, which is prohibited under the Lanterman Developmental Disability Services Act. The plaintiff argued that the motion is an improper motion for reconsideration, as the same issue was previously decided in the motion to strike punitive damages in the first amended complaint. The judge agrees that the motion is an improper motion for reconsideration and that the defendants failed to meet the requirements for a motion for reconsideration.
