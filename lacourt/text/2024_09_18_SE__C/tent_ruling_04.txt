parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties
outside of the presence of the court or orally before the court, for settlement
of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon motion, may enter judgment
pursuant to the terms of the settlement. If requested by the parties, the court
may retain jurisdiction over the parties to enforce the settlement until
performance in full of the terms of the settlement.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6,

& Leasing and Defendant Ampak Logistics, Inc.; Junaid Sultan; Jamshed
Sultan; and Sultan Chaudri entered into a Settlement Agreement and Release of
All Claims ("Agreement") (Decl. Hong, ¶ 14, Ex. 5.) The parties also
