And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has tentatively ruled on the demurrer and motion to strike in this case. The demurrer to the first cause of action (assault) is sustained with 20 days leave to amend, as the complaint does not adequately plead that Defendant Rodriguez intended to grab Plaintiff. The demurrer to the second cause of action (intentional infliction of emotional distress) is sustained with 20 days leave to amend, as the complaint does not adequately plead that the Defendants' conduct was extreme and outrageous. The demurrer to the third cause of action (negligent infliction of emotional distress) is sustained with 20 days leave to amend, as the complaint does not adequately plead that the Defendants had a duty to act reasonably and responsibly. The demurrer to the fourth cause of action (Bane Act violations) is sustained with 20 days leave to amend, as the complaint does not adequately plead that the Defendants' conduct was due to Plaintiff's membership in a protected class. The demurrer to the fifth cause of action (false imprisonment) is overruled.

The motion to strike punitive damages is granted with 20 days leave to amend. The complaint does not adequately plead that the Defendants acted with malice, fraud, or oppression, as required by California Civil Code section 3294.

The Judge has also identified several factual issues that cannot be adjudicated at this stage of the proceedings.
