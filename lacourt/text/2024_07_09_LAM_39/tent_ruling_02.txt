[1]The
court notes Defendant raises the statute of limitations as a defense for the
first time in her reply brief.  However,
the court cannot consider arguments raised for the first time in reply, as
Plaintiff has not had the opportunity to respond to such contentions.  (See In re Marriage of Hoffmeister (1984)
161 Cal.App.3d 1163, 1171.)  In any
event, given the court’s ruling on the motion, it is not necessary to reach
this issue.
