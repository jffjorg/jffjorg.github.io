And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling issued by the court on July 9, 2024, regarding a motion to compel compliance with subpoenas filed by assignee Adam Harari. The motion is denied due to a lack of personal service on the deponents, Bank of America, N.A. and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. However, the court notes that the parties have agreed to produce responsive documents subject to a protective order, making the motion moot. The court orders that Judgment Debtor Dalia Nosrati notify the deponents of the withdrawal of objections to the subpoenas within 30 days and that assignee Harari give notice of this order and file proof of service.
