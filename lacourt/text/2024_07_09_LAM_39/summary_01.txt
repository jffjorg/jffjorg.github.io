And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge rules that the defendant's demurrer to the plaintiff's first amended complaint is sustained without leave to amend. The plaintiff's claims of financial abuse and neglect of a dependent adult and breach of fiduciary duty are based on the defendant's alleged misconduct in the family law case regarding the plaintiff's child support obligations. The court finds that these claims belong in a family law court and that the defendant's demurrer is sustained. The court also rejects the plaintiff's arguments that the claims are not barred by collateral estoppel and res judicata, and that the defendant's alleged misconduct constitutes a primary right to a correct determination of child support obligations.
