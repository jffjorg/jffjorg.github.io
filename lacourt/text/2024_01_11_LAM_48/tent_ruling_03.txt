[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING IN PART PLAINTIFF’S
  MOTION FOR ATTORNEY FEES AND COSTS
 
Dept. 48

Plaintiff
Sagnite Flores and Defendants Volkswagen Group of America, Inc. and Pacific Volkswagen
have reached a settlement in this Song-Beverly action.  On August 4, 2023, Plaintiff filed a motion for
attorney fees.  Defendants did not file an
opposition.
As
the prevailing party, Plaintiff is entitled to an award of reasonable attorney fees.  (Civil Code § 1794, subd. (d).)  California courts apply the “lodestar” approach
to determine what fees are reasonable.  (See,
e.g., Holguin v. DISH Network LLC (2014) 229 Cal.App.4th 1310, 1332.)  This inquiry “begins with the ‘lodestar,’ i.e.,
the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate.”  (PLCM Group v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th
1084, 1095.)  From there, the “lodestar figure
may then be adjusted, based on consideration of factors specific to the case, in
order to fix the fee at the fair market value for the legal services provided.”  (Ibid.)  Relevant factors include “(1) the novelty and
difficulty of the questions involved, (2) the skill displayed in presenting them,
(3) the extent to which the nature of the litigation precluded other employment
by the attorneys, [and] (4) the contingent nature of the fee award.”  (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122,
1132.)  The party seeking fees has the burden
of documenting the appropriate hours expended and hourly rates.  (City of Colton v. Singletary (2012) 206
Cal.App.4th 751, 784.)
Plaintiff
seeks $31,039.50 in attorney fees and $1,867.81 in costs and expenses.  Plaintiff provides a copy of counsel’s billing
records, which show 57.8 hours billed.  (Saeedian
Decl., Ex. A.)
Plaintiff’s
counsel charges various hourly rates: $695 for Michael Saeedian; $525 for Christopher
Urner; and $250 for law clerk Jorge Acosta. 
(Saeedian Decl. ¶¶ 3-5.)  The Court
finds that $695 is unreasonably high, and $525 is a reasonable rate for all of Plaintiff’s
attorneys.  Counsel’s declaration and lengthy
invoice do not provide the total hours billed by each attorney, complicating the
calculations for the Court.
The
billing records also reflect inefficiencies in the number of hours for certain tasks.  For example, Attorney Saeedian, who has the highest
hourly rate, billed 0.6 hours for drafting and reviewing the attorney-client agreement,
0.3 hours for “Receipt and review of Conformed Summons, Complaint, Civil Case Cover
Sheet, Addendum and additional forms,” and 0.5 hours for “Review Fee Motion, Case
File and records in preparation of Fee Motion Hearing.”  Over nine hours were billed in connection with
this simple fee motion, with most of that time billed by the attorney with the highest
hourly rate.  Additionally, the Court will
not award attorney fees for the anticipated 1.5 hours for preparing a reply and
1.0 hour for attending the hearing on this unopposed motion.
Some
items are clerical in nature, such as “Review Plaintiff's billing entries for clarity
and accuracy” and “Continue reviewing Plaintiffs billing entries for clarity and
accuracy in preparation to draft Plaintiffs fee motion.”  These entries are particularly troublesome because
they call into question the original accuracy of the recordkeeping.  Counsel had declared that the billing records
were “accurate reflections of the time that I have worked on this case as well as
the time my employees have worked on this case” and that “most of the tasks in this
case are recorded in the client file as they occur.”  Saeedian Decl. ¶ 9.)
Considering
the type of case, complexity of the case, length of litigation, and the record as
a whole, the Court concludes that a reasonable amount of attorney fees is $20,000.00.  (See Kerkeles v. City of San Jose (2015)
243 Cal.App.4th 88, 102 [“When a ‘voluminous fee application’ is made, the court
may . . . ‘make across-the-board percentage cuts either in the number of hours claimed
or in the final lodestar figure.’”].)
The
motion for attorney fees is GRANTED IN PART. 
The Court awards Plaintiff $25,000.00 in attorney fees and $1,867.81 in costs
and expenses.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
