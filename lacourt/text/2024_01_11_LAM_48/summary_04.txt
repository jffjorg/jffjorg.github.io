The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion filed by the plaintiff's counsel, John A. Axtell of Marh & Associates, to be relieved as counsel. The counsel states that the client's conduct has made it unreasonably difficult to carry out the representation effectively and that the client has breached a material term of the agreement related to the representation. Since no party opposed the motion, the Judge grants the motion and orders that the counsel be relieved as counsel. However, the Judge notes that a corporation cannot represent itself in court and orders the plaintiff, TL Veterans Construction, Inc., to retain new counsel by April 15, 2024, or the Court may dismiss its claims.
