And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge, Hon. Thomas D. Long, has issued a tentative ruling in the case of PRC Restoration, Inc. (Plaintiff) vs. TL Veterans Construction, Inc. et al. (Defendants). The Defendant's counsel, John A. Axtell and Marh & Associates, have moved to be relieved as counsel due to the client's conduct and breach of agreement. The Court has granted the motion, finding that the client's conduct renders it unreasonably difficult for counsel to carry out the representation effectively.

However, the Court has also scheduled an Order to Show Cause Re: Failure to Retain New Counsel for TL Veterans Construction Inc. for April 15, 2024, as a corporation cannot represent itself in court without an attorney. The client must retain new counsel by this date or the Court will strike its answer and place it in default.

The parties who intend to submit on this tentative ruling must send an email to the Court indicating their intention to do so. If all parties submit, no appearances before the Court are required unless a companion hearing is also scheduled.
