  CASE NO.: 22NWCV00301
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING MOTION TO BE RELIEVED
  AS COUNSEL
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
January 11, 2024



 
John
A. Axtell and Marh & Associates, counsel of record for Defendant TL
Veterans Construction Inc., seek to be relieved as counsel.  Counsel’s declaration states that the
client’s conduct renders it unreasonably difficult for counsel to carry out the
representation effectively.  The client
has also breached a material term of the agreement related to the
representation.  No party opposed the motion.
Absent
a showing of resulting prejudice, an attorney’s request for withdrawal should be
granted.  (People v. Prince (1968)
268 Cal.App.2d 398, 406.)  Counsel’s motion
complies with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362.  Trial is not until April 29, 2024, and there is
no prejudice to Defendant.
The
unopposed motion to be relieved is GRANTED and effective upon filing a proof of
service showing service of the signed Form MC-053 order and this order on TL
Veterans Construction Inc. and all parties who have appeared.
However,
“a corporation cannot represent itself in a court of record either in propria persona
or through an officer or agent who is not an attorney.”  (Caressa Camille, Inc. v. Alcoholic Beverage
Control Appeals Bd. (2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 1094, 1101.)  Therefore, an Order to Show Cause Re: Failure
to Retain New Counsel for TL Veterans Construction Inc. is scheduled for 04/15/2024
at 9:00 a.m. in Department 48 at Stanley Mosk Courthouse.  TL Veterans Construction Inc. must retain new
counsel by that date or the Court will strike its answer and place it in default.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
 
        
Dated this 11th day of January 2024
