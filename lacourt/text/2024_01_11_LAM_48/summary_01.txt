And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling denies the motion to clarify the Court's September 14, 2023 order granting summary adjudication of the defendant's sixth cause of action for declaratory relief regarding its termination of the Soil Agreement. The plaintiff, Weber Enterprise Trucking Corporation, seeks to present evidence at trial regarding its claims for breach of contract, intentional and negligent misrepresentation, anticipatory breach of contract, and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The Court has already denied the defendant's motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication with respect to the plaintiff's breach of contract claim, but the Court has granted summary adjudication of the defendant's sixth cause of action for declaratory relief. The Court finds that the granting of summary adjudication for the defendant's sixth cause of action does not bar other causes of action, and that the plaintiff's requests for "clarification/confirmation" that it will be allowed to present certain evidence are matters that should instead be addressed through motions in limine.
