And here is the English-language summary of the tentative ruling:

The court has issued a tentative ruling granting in part the plaintiff's motion for attorney fees and costs in the amount of $25,000.00 and $1,867.81, respectively. The plaintiff, Sagnite Flores, sought $31,039.50 in attorney fees and $1,867.81 in costs and expenses. The court found that the plaintiff's counsel, Michael Saeedian, billed 57.8 hours and charged various hourly rates, but adjusted the fees based on the complexity and length of the litigation. The court noted that some entries in the billing records were clerical in nature and questioned the original accuracy of the recordkeeping. The court awarded fees in the amount of $20,000.00, which is the reasonable amount based on the type of case, complexity, and length of litigation. The motion for attorney fees is granted in part, and the parties must submit an objection to the tentative ruling if they wish to contest the award.
