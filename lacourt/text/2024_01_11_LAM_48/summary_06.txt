Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has sustained the demurrer to the plaintiff's complaint with 30 days' leave to amend, meaning the plaintiff must re-file the complaint with additional factual allegations that support the claims of wrongful termination, breach of contract, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. The judge has also granted the motion to strike certain allegations and denied the motion to strike others.

The judge found that the plaintiff's allegations of wrongful termination were insufficient because the plaintiff did not allege facts showing that she was forced to resign, and that she did not have a binding contract with the defendants.

The judge also found that the plaintiff's allegations of intentional infliction of emotional distress were insufficient because the alleged conduct was not extreme or outrageous, and the plaintiff did not suffer severe emotional distress.

The judge granted the motion to strike as to La Colombe, meaning that the plaintiff cannot seek punitive damages against the corporation, and denied the motion to strike as to Seabrook, meaning that the plaintiff can seek punitive damages against the individual defendant.
