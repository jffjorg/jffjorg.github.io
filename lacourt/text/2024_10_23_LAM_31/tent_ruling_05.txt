I.          INTRODUCTION
 
On December 12, 2023, Plaintiff Sophia Henry, a
self-represented litigant, filed this action against Defendants Rob Bonta,
acting as California Attorney General for the State of California (“Bonta”),
Ana M. Lasso, acting as Director of Department of General Services Office of
Risk and Insurance Management for State of California (“Lasso”), the State of
California (the “State”), Employment Development Department (“EDD”), and Paid
Family Leave Office—Fresno (“PFLO”) (collectively, “Defendants”), arising from the
denial of Plaintiff’s Paid Family Leave claim. 
Plaintiff seeks relief for alleged wrongdoing on the basis that she is
“under consular jurisdiction pursuant to Treaty Law as Bloodright Heir by
Blood, Deed, Creed, and Custom to: i) Treaty of Peace with Morocco of 1787/1836
(signed at Meccanez; copy at Tangiers) between the United States of North
America and Moroccan Empire, which is in full force and effect under Article 25
of the Treaty of Peace and Friendship of 1836, and the organic Constitution for
the United States of North America.” 
Based on those rights, Plaintiff alleges she was entitled to, and
wrongfully denied, benefits in the amount of “Three Thousand Four Hundred
Eighty ($3,480.00) Dollars.” 
 
Based on her treaty rights, Plaintiff further alleges that Defendants
“are responsible in some manner for the claimed tortious interference with
Trade and Commerce by irreparable injury to Plaintiff through: i) economic
hardship / mental anxiety / psychological and emotional distress caused by
failure / refusal or delay to make payment under an insurance policy; ii) bad
faith; iii) wrongfully disqualifying benefits; iv) wrongfully subjecting
insured to biased claims handling; v) wrongfully withdrawing benefits due; vi)
adopting an inconsistent position in refusing claim; vii) breach of contract;
viii) breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing by failure to
investigate claim; ix) violation of California Insurance Code § 790.035; x)
violation of California Labor Code § 5814; xi) violation of California Civil
Code § 3294; and xii) violation of 15 § U.S.C. § 1; 15 U.S.C. § 2; 15 U.S.C. § 45;
15 U.S.C. § 1125; 19 U.S.C. § 1592.”  
 
Default was entered against Defendants.
 
On September 4, 2024, the court granted Defendants’ motion
to vacate the default.  In granting the
motion, the court concurrently vacated an Order to Show Cause Re: Default
Judgment and scheduled an Order to Show Cause Re: Proof of Service for December
4, 2024.  
 
On September 5, 2024, Plaintiff filed this Motion to Advance
Order to Show Cause Hearing Re: Proof of Service.  
 
II.        DISCUSSION
 
The court finds Plaintiff’s Motion to Advance Order to Show
Cause Hearing Re: Proof of Service is moot. 
Defendants filed and served their Answer on September 11, 2024.  
            
III.      CONCLUSION
 
The Motion to Advance is MOOT.   
 
The OSC re: Proof of Service scheduled for December 4, 2024,
is VACATED.
