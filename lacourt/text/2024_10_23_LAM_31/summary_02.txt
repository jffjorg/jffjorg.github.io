And here is the English text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses several issues in this case. The plaintiff must lay the proper foundation for the admission of his medical records. The defendant argues that the case Sweetwater Union High School v. Gilbane Building Company cannot cure the defects in the plaintiff's submission. The judge notes that the plaintiff failed to submit authority for the proposition that Sweetwater applies to summary judgment proceedings.

The judge also addresses the plaintiff's additional evidence submitted in support of the plaintiff's supplemental papers. Although the court did not explicitly permit additional evidence, it did not explicitly forbid it either. The judge exercises its discretion to consider the plaintiff's supplemental evidence.

The judge notes that the plaintiff was provided with earplugs and that Dr. Arruda's declaration raises questions about the accuracy of his opinions. The defendant seeks to take Dr. Arruda's deposition, which the judge grants. The judge also grants the plaintiff leave to lay the foundation for the admissibility of the plaintiff's medical records.

Prior to trial, the defendant may file motions in limine to preclude the admissibility of evidence regarding hearing loss. The judge orders that the plaintiff must lay the proper foundation for the admission of his medical records and that Dr. Arruda's record review should be discussed with counsel.
