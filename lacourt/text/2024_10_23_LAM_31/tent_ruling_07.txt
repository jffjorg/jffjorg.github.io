MOTION
FOR SANCTIONS PURSUANT TO CCP § 128.7 AGAINST PLAINTIFF HEALTHPIPER, LLC AND
ITS COUNSEL OF RECORD, ARTI BHIMANI AND BHIMANI LAW, APC, JOINTLY AND SEVERALLY


 
MOVING PARTY:               Defendants
Suma Gowda and Gowda Innovations
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     Plaintiff healthPiper
LLC 
 
 
I.          BACKGROUND
 
On August 20, 2024, plaintiff healthPiper LLC (healthPiper)
filed this action against defendants Suma Gowda (Gowda) and Gowda Innovations
for (1) fraudulent concealment, (2) conversion, (3) breach of employment agreement,
(4) intentional interference with contractual relations against Gowda
Innovations, (5) intentional interference with contractual relations against Gowda,
and (6) breach of fiduciary duty.  
 
As alleged in the Complaint, “Dr. Joshua Freedman is the CEO
of healthPiper.  healthPiper is an
on-line company that offers accessible and effective psychiatry treatment.  Gowda worked for Dr. Freedman and healthPiper
as a software engineer and chief technology officers from 2014 until 2022.  Gowda strung healthPiper along for years in
an elaborate scheme that had healthPiper paying Gowda a salary for full-time
employment, as well as, to pay for Gowda’s attorney to help her navigate the US
immigration system to obtain permanent resident status in the US.  The entire time her application was being
processed by the attorneys that healthPiper paid for, Gowda thanked healthPiper
for supporting her H-1B and permanent residency visa applications and that she
desired to work for healthPiper for a decade.”  (Complaint, ¶ 1.)   Upon
becoming a US permanent resident, Gowda left healthPiper’s employ, converted
healthPiper’s intellectual property, and besmirched Dr. Freedman’s reputation.  After Gowda’s departure, healthPiper learned
she was operating and managing the day-to-day operations of her own company,
Gowda Innovations.
 
            Defendants’
Demurrer
            On
September 20, 2024, Defendants filed a demurrer to the Complaint.  As
relevant here, Defendants argued healthPiper’s claims should have been asserted
as a compulsory cross-complaint in the related action Case No. 22STCV34766. 
             
The demurrer was heard on October 16, 2024.  After oral
argument, the court took the matter under submission to consider whether
healthPiper’s Complaint should have been brought as a compulsory
cross-complaint in the related case.  On October 22, 2024, the court
issued a final ruling sustaining the demurrer and granting leave to amend. 
 
Defendants’ Motion for Sanctions
 
On September 20, 2024, Defendants filed this Motion for
Sanctions Pursuant to CCP § 128.7 against Plaintiff healthPiper, LLC, and its counsel
of record, Arti Bhimani and Bhimani Law, APC, jointly and severally, in the amount
of $15,302.50.  Defendants contend that
healthPiper’s Complaint was filed for an improper purpose.
 
On October 10, 2024, healthPiper filed an opposition.  healthPiper also requests sanctions against
Defendants.
 
On October 17, 2024, Defendants filed a Notice of Withdrawal
of Pending Motion for Sanctions Pursuant to C.C.P §128.7, Without Prejudice. 
 
On October 21, 2024, the parties appeared for a status
conference.  At the conference, counsel
for healthPiper requested that Defendants’ Motion for Sanctions remain on
calendar so the court could consider healthPiper’s request for sanctions
against Defendants.  
 
The court now rules as follows.
 
II.        DISCUSSION
& LEGAL STANDARD 
 
            Defendants’
motion is procedurally defective.  Under Code of Civil Procedure (CCP), section¿128.7,
a¿court¿may¿impose sanctions if it concludes a pleading was filed for an improper
purpose or was indisputably without merit, either legally or factually.¿¿(Bucur
v. Ahmad¿(2016) 244 Cal.App.4th 175, 189-190 (Bucur).) ¿A claim is
factually frivolous if it is “not well grounded in fact” and is legally
frivolous if it is “not warranted by existing law or a good faith argument for
the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law. [Citation.]” ¿(Ibid.)¿
“In either case, to obtain¿sanctions, the moving party must show the party's
conduct in asserting the claim was objectively unreasonable. [Citation.]”  (Ibid.) ¿“A claim is objectively
unreasonable if ‘any reasonable attorney would agree that [it] is totally¿and
completely without merit.’”¿¿(Id., citing In re Marriage of Flaherty
(1982) 31 Cal.3d 637, 650.)  
 
As relevant here, Section 128.7 provides for a 21-day period
during which a party may avoid sanctions by withdrawing the offending pleading
or other document. [Citations].”  (Bucur, 244 Cal.App.4th at p.
190.)  “If a party does not take advantage of the [21-day] safe harbor
period by withdrawing a frivolous filing, a court has broad discretion to
impose sanctions.” (Ibid.)  
The “21 days is not a notice period. ... It defines when the
target of a sanctions motion can act without penalty and withdraw” an
objectionable document. (Broadcast Music, Inc. v. Structured Asset
Sales, LLC (2022) 75 Cal.App.5th 596, 606.) The moving party must file the
motion “outside the safe harbor period,” not “on day one of the
safe harbor period, day 21 of the safe harbor period, or any day in between.” (Ibid.)
In other words, the “sanctions motion cannot be filed until the 22nd day after
service of the motion, i.e., after the 21-day safe harbor period expires.” (Id. at
p. 605.)
 
Moreover, the law requires strict compliance with the safe
harbor provisions. (Li v. Majestic Industry Hills LLC (2009) 177
Cal.App.4th 585, 593.) Failure to comply with the safe harbor provisions
“precludes an award of sanctions.” (Martorana v. Marlin & Saltzman (2009)
175 Cal.App.4th 685, 700; see Li, at p. 594 [“compliance with
the safe harbor is a prerequisite to recovering sanctions”].)
 
Here, Defendants served Plaintiff with notice of this motion
on August 28, 2024, via e-mail.  (See Lazarski Decl., Ex. B.)  Therefore,
healthPiper had 21 calendar days plus two court days, until September 21, 2024,
to withdraw or amend the Complaint to avoid sanctions. (CCP § 1010.6, subd. (a)(3)(B)
[extending service by electronic means by two court days].) However, Defendants
filed this motion for sanctions on the twentieth day—September 20, 2024.  On this ground alone, Defendants are
precluded from an award of sanctions.  
 
            healthPiper’s
Request for Sanctions
            
healthPiper requests sanctions against Defendants and their
counsel.  Pursuant to CCP section 128.7,
subdivision (c)(1), “the court may award to the party prevailing on the motion
the reasonable expenses and attorney’s fees incurred in presenting or opposing
the motion.”  Given that Defendants withdrew
their motion, and further, failed to comply with the safe harbor provision, the
court finds healthPiper are entitled to an award of sanctions as the prevailing
party.  
 
Sanctions are warranted for the further reason that healthPiper
did not bring present their Complaint “primarily for an improper purpose, such
as to harass or to cause unnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of
litigation.” (CCP § 128.7, subd. (b)(1).)  Notwithstanding the court’s ruling on Defendants’
demurrer to the Complaint, healthPiper’s Complaint was not presented for an
improper purpose.  Had Defendant not
withdrawn the motion, it would have been denied on the merits, rendering healthPiper
the prevailing party.  
 
The court imposes sanctions against Defendants’ counsel of
record alone.  “[U]nder section 128.7,
only an attorney or unrepresented party may be sanctioned; sanctions against a
represented party are not authorized.”  (Levy
v. Blum (2001) 92 Cal.App.4th 625, 637.) 
Accordingly, sanctions are imposed against Defendants’ counsel in the
sum of $2,250, consisting of three hours at healthPiper’s counsel’s hourly
rate. 
 
III.       CONCLUSION
 
            The motion
for sanctions is DENIED.  
 
            Plaintiff
healthPiper LLC’s request for sanctions is GRANTED.  Sanctions are imposed against Counsel for Defendants
Suma Gowda and Gowda Inventions in the sum of $2,250, to be paid within 30 days
of this order. 
 
Plaintiff to give notice.
