English-text summary:

The tentative ruling by Judge Kerry Bensinger addresses the demurrer filed by Cally Williams Caiozzo, as Trustee of the Harry A. Williams Family Trust, to the Third Amended Cross-Complaint (TAXC) filed by 2672 to 2674 North Beachwood Drive, LLC. The court sustains the demurrer to the first cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty, finding that Beachwood does not present any new factual allegations to show a fiduciary duty existed or that the delayed discovery applies. The court also sustains the demurrer to the second cause of action for conversion, as Beachwood admits that no rent was collected for the 2674 Unit. The demurrer to the third cause of action for fraud is sustained, as Beachwood's allegations lack the required specificity. Leave to amend is granted as to the third cause of action only. The defendant is to serve and file the Fourth Amended Cross-Complaint within 15 days of the order.
