And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion filed by the plaintiff, Sophia Henry, to advance an Order to Show Cause Hearing Re: Proof of Service. The plaintiff is seeking relief for the alleged wrongful denial of Paid Family Leave benefits and claims that she has treaty rights under the Treaty of Peace with Morocco of 1787/1836. The defendants, including the State of California, Employment Development Department, and Paid Family Leave Office—Fresno, had previously defaulted, but the default was later vacated. The defendants have since filed an answer to the complaint. The judge finds that the plaintiff's motion is moot because the defendants have already filed an answer, which makes the Order to Show Cause Hearing Re: Proof of Service unnecessary. The hearing scheduled for December 4, 2024, is therefore vacated.
