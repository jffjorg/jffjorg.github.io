MOVING PARTY:               Cross-Defendant
Cally Williams Caiozzo, as Trustee of the Harry A. Williams Family Trust
created on August 7, 1984
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     Cross-Complainant
2672 to 2674 North Beachwood Drive, LLC
 
 
I.          FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND
 
            On May 20,
2021, Plaintiff Cally Williams Caiozzo, as Trustee of the Harry A. Williams
Family Trust created on August 7, 1984 (Caiozzo) filed this action against
Defendants 2672 to 2674 North Beachwood Drive, LLC (Beachwood). The Complaint
asserts the sole cause of action for partition by sale of the real property
commonly known as 2672-2674 North Beachwood Drive, Los Angeles, California
90068 (the Property).  
 
            Beachwood’s
Cross-Complaints
 
On June 21, 2021, Beachwood filed a Cross-Complaint against
Caiozzo.  After the court sustained
Caiozzo’s demurrer to the Cross-Complaint, Beachwood filed the First Amended
Cross-Complaint (AXC).  The AXC asserted
causes of action for breach of fiduciary duty, conversion, and fraud.  Caiozzo demurred to the AXC on the ground that
the causes of action had accrued in 2016 and were therefore time barred, among
other reasons.  Judge Orozco found that
there were no allegations to show the delayed discovery rule applied and
sustained the demurrer.  Leave to amend was
granted.  
 
On July 15, 2022, Beachwood filed the Second Amended Cross-Complaint
(SAXC).  The SAXC asserted the same causes
of action for breach of fiduciary duty, conversion, and fraud.
Caiozzo demurred to the SAXC, which the court overruled as
untimely. 
 
            On
September 5, 2024, pursuant to the parties’ joint stipulation and the court’s
order,  Beachwood filed the Third Amended
Cross-Complaint (TAXC).  
 
            Caiozzo’s
Demurrer 
 
            On
September 9, 2024, Caiozzo filed a demurrer to the TAXC.  
 
            On October
10, 2024, Beachwood filed an opposition.
 
            On October 16,
2024, Caiozzo filed a reply. 
 
II.        LEGAL
STANDARD
 
A demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the complaint
states a cause of action.¿ (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740,
747.)¿ When considering demurrers, courts read the allegations liberally and in
context, accepting the alleged facts as true.¿ (Nolte v. Cedars-Sinai
Medical Center (2015) 236 Cal.App.4th 1401, 1406.)¿ “Because a demurrer
challenges defects on the face of the complaint, it can only refer to matters
outside the pleading that are subject to judicial notice.”¿ (Arce ex rel.
Arce v. Kaiser Found. Health Plan, Inc. (2010) 181 Cal.App.4th 471,
556.)¿¿  
 
III.       DISCUSSION           
 
A.   
Breach of Fiduciary Duty (1st
Cause of Action)
 
“The elements of a cause of action for breach of fiduciary
duty are the existence of a¿ 
fiduciary relationship, its breach, and damage proximately
caused by that breach.”¿ (Knox v. Dean (2012) 205 Cal.App.4th 417,
432-33.) 
 
            The ruling
on Beachwood’s first cause of action turns on whether Beachwood has pled facts
sufficient to invoke the delayed discovery rule.  Previously, Caiozzo argued, and Judge Orozco
agreed, that Beachwood’s claim accrued in 2016. 
A cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty must be brought within
four years.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
343.)  The statute of limitations does
not begin to run until the claim has accrued. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 312.)  Absent
any allegations to show the delayed discovery rule applied, Beachwood’s claim
was time barred.  (See Minute Order,
6/27/22.)  The court further stated,
“When relying on the delayed discovery rule, specific facts must be pled
showing ‘(1) the time and manner of discovery and (2) the inability to have
made earlier discovery despite reasonable diligence.’”  (Id.)
            
Beachwood alleges the following “new facts” in the TAXC:
 
·        
“Moreover, the fiduciary
relationship is a question of fact. Hasso v. Hapke (2014) 227
Cal.App.4th 107, 140.”  (TAXC, ¶ 18.)
·        
“As discovered since the last
amended complaint, delayed discovery is furthermore not an issue in this case
because in or about August 2018 (perhaps again even further out from this date
and subject to further discovery), Cross-Defendant communicated to Cross-Complainants
and/or Cross-Complainant’s predecessors that Cross-Defendant continued to
maintain the Purported Trust Account where she continued to allegedly deposit
the rents from the upstairs unit. Thus, three years from August 2018 is August
2021, which is after the date this lawsuit was filed. This is the alternative
argument to the delay discovery rule. The delay discovery rule applies to this
lawsuit based on the contradiction from Cross-Defendant in 2020.”  (TAXC, ¶ 26.)
·        
“By making the foregoing
representations, and/or based on the allegations above, Cross-Defendant formed
a fiduciary/confidential relationship with the Predecessors and all owners who
succeeded to the Predecessors, including Cross-Complainant, whereby the
Predecessors and Cross-Complainant, entrusted Cross-Defendant with the proper
holding of the rents from the 2674 Unit. Thus, Cross-Complainant had no duty to
investigate the true facts of what Cross-Defendant was doing with the alleged
collected rent until suspicion arose in December 2020. Either way, see above
about Cross-Defendant’s August 2018 communication and, moreover, once again
based on subsequent discovery in this case, Cross-Defendant has admitted in a
prior communication that the parties are and have been in a fiduciary relationship.”  (TAXC, ¶ 30, new allegations bolded.) 
 
Central to Beachwood’s opposition is the following “old”
allegation: Caiozzo became Beachwood’s fiduciary by establishing the Purported
Trust Account and informing the Beachwood’s Predecessors to rescind the Notice
of Eviction to the tenant for the 2764 Unit (Caiozzo’s relative) because
Caiozzo had deposited the rents into the Purported Trust Account and would
thereafter continue to deposit future rents into that Purported Trust
Account.  (Compare TAXC, ¶ 15 with AXC, ¶
15.)  The significance being, if a
fiduciary relationship existed, Beachwood would be absolved of the duty to
diligently discovery the facts constituting their breach of fiduciary duty,
conversion, and fraud claims.  (See TAXC,
¶18.)
 
The court is not persuaded. 
As Caiozzo points out, the TAXC clearly outlines the relationship
between the parties.  Caiozzo and
Beachwood are co-owners of the property. 
As such, the parties each had the ability and entitlement to collect
rent for the Property.  (See, e.g., In
re Knox’ Estate (1942) 52 Cal.App.2d 338, 354 (noting cotenant’s right to
collect rents but not exclude other cotenants); Miller & Starr, Cal. Real
Estate, § 11:3, p. 11-7 (“The Lessor cotenant is entitled to collect the rents
of the leased common property.”), § 11:3, p. 11-8 (“Each cotenant is entitled
to a share of the rent” that third parties pay a cotenant, less the cotenant’s
expenses).)  Further, the parties
acquired their interests in the Property at different times.  Accordingly, where cotenants “acquire their
interest at different times through different instruments, and no relationship
of trust and confidence exists between them, then no fiduciary relationship can
be found to exist.”  (Wilson v. S.L.
Rey, Inc. (2008) 17 Cal.App.4th 234, 243.)
 
Beachwood does not allege any new facts which show a
fiduciary relationship existed between the parties.  Indeed, Beachwood does not allege any new
facts to show the delayed discovery applies. 
Instead, Beachwood relies on inapposite authority that does not change
the result.  Beachwood cites Hasso v.
Hapke (2014) 227 Cal.App.4th 107 (Hasso) for the proposition
that whether a party is a fiduciary or some other confidential relationship
exists is a question of fact.  Beachwood
misstates Hasso.  There, the Court
of Appeal set forth the general law on fiduciary duties before narrowing to the
proposition relevant to the facts of that case: “It is a question of fact
whether one is either an investment adviser [citation] or a party to a
confidential relationship that gives rise to a fiduciary duty under common
law[.]”  (Hasso, at p. 140.)  This case does not concern investment
advice.  
 
Beachwood also cites Richelle L. v. Roman Catholic
Archbishop (2003) 106 Cal.App.4th 257 (Richelle L.).  That case is likewise distinguishable.  Richelle L. examined the difference
between confidential relationships and fiduciary relationships to determine
whether the confidential relationship between a parishioner and the priest who
sexually abused her gave rise to liability for breach of a fiduciary duty.  (Richelle L., at pp. 270-79.)  The facts and the issues presented in Richelle
L. are a far cry from this case. 
 
In sum, Beachwood does not present any new factual allegations
to show a fiduciary duty existed or that the delayed discovery applies.  Having so concluded, the court does not
address Caiozzo’s remaining arguments re: the litigation privilege and whether
the TAXC alleges sufficient facts to state a cause of action for breach of
fiduciary duty.[1]  
 
Accordingly, the demurrer to the first cause of action is
SUSTAINED.  Leave to amend is DENIED. 
 
B.    
Conversion (2nd Cause of
Action)
 
“Conversion is the wrongful exercise of dominion over the
property of another. The elements of a conversion claim are: (1) the
plaintiff’s ownership or right to possession of the property; (2) the
defendant’s conversion by a wrongful act or disposition of property rights; and
(3) damages.” (Lee v. Hanley (2015) 61 Cal.4th 1225, 1240.)  
 
The second cause of action is based on the allegation that Caiozzo
kept all the rental income for the 2674 Unit.  (TAXC, ¶ 36.)  However, in opposing Caiozzo’s motion for
summary judgment on Caiozzo’s complaint, Beachwood admits to discovering that
no rent was collected for the 2674 Unit. 
(See Opposition, p. 5.)  If there
was no payment of rental income, there was no rental income to convert.  The second element is not satisfied. 
 
Accordingly, the demurrer to the second cause of action is
SUSTAINED.   
 
C.    
Fraud (3rd Cause of
Action) 
 
“Fraud must be pleaded with specificity rather than with
general and conclusory allegations.”  (Small v. Fritz Companies, Inc.
(2003) 30 Cal.4th 167, 184 (cleaned up).)  The specificity requirement
means a plaintiff must allege facts showing how, when, where, to whom, and by
what means the representations were made, and, in the case of a corporate
defendant, the plaintiff must allege the names of the persons who made the
representations, their authority to speak on behalf of the corporation, to whom
they spoke, what they said or wrote, and when the representation was
made.  (Lazar v. Superior Court (1996) 12 Cal.4th 631, 645; West
v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (2013) 214 Cal.App.4th 780, 793.)¿¿ 
¿ 
“The facts essential to the statement of a cause of action
in fraud or deceit based on a promise made without any intention of performing
it are: (1) a promise made regarding a material fact without any intention of
performing it; (2) the existence of the intent at the time of making the
promise; (3) the promise was made with intent to deceive or with intent to
induce the party to whom it was made to enter into the transaction; (4) the
promise was relied on by the party to whom it was made; (5) the party making
the promise did not perform; (6) the party to whom the promise was made was
injured. (Regus v. Schartkoff (1957) 156 Cal.App.2d 382, 389.)¿¿ 
 
Upon review of the allegations in the TAXC, the court finds
Beachwood does not state a claim for fraud. 
The TAXC includes the new allegations that Caiozzo falsely represented
to Beachwood in 2018 that she was still depositing rent for the 2674 Unit into
a trust account.  Beachwood learned of
the falsity of that representation in 2020 when Caiozzo indicated in
correspondence to Beachwood that no rents were deposited because the rent was
zero.  (TAXC, ¶¶ 13, 26.)  Accepted as true, the 2018 representation, which
Beachwood discovered to be false in 2020, is not time barred.  The statute of limitations for a fraud claim
is three years.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 338,
subd. (d)(1).)  The statute of
limitations does not begin to run until the claim has accrued.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 312.)  This action followed less than three years
later.  However, missing from these
allegations are the “how, when, where, to whom, and by what means” the 2018
representations were made.  The fraud
claim lacks the required specificity.[2]  
 
Accordingly, the demurrer to the third cause of action is
SUSTAINED.  Leave to amend is GRANTED.
 
IV.       CONCLUSION 
 
            The
demurrer to the TAXC is SUSTAINED.  Leave
to amend is GRANTED as to the third cause of action only.
 
            Defendant
is to serve and file the Fourth Amended Cross-Complaint within 15 days of this
order.
            
Caiozzo to give notice.
