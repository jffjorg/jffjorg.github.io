MOTION
TO COMPEL ARBITRATION
      


 
MOVING PARTY:               Defendant
The Cheesecake Factory, Inc.
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     No opposition
 
 
I.          BACKGROUND
            On June 18, 2024, Plaintiff
Harold Benso Edwards Streeter (Plaintiff) filed a handwritten complaint against
his former employer The Cheesecake Factory Inc. (Defendant) for his alleged
wrongful termination.  Plaintiff is
self-represented.  
            On September 6, 2024, Defendant
filed this Motion to Compel Arbitration and Stay or Dismiss Action.  
            No opposition has been
filed.
II.        LEGAL STANDARD 
            Under both the Federal
Arbitration Act and California law, arbitration agreements are valid,
irrevocable, and enforceable, except on such grounds that exist at law or
equity for voiding a contract.  (Winter
v. Window Fashions Professions, Inc. (2008) 166 Cal.App.4th 943, 947.)  The party moving to compel arbitration must
establish the existence of a written arbitration agreement between the parties.
 (Code Civ. Proc. § 1281.2.)  In ruling on a motion to compel arbitration,
the court must first determine whether the parties actually agreed to arbitrate
the dispute, and general principles of California contract law help guide the
court in making this determination. (Mendez v. Mid-Wilshire Health Care
Center (2013) 220 Cal.App.4th 534, 541.)¿ 
            Once petitioners
allege that an arbitration agreement exists, the burden shifts to respondents
to prove the falsity of the purported agreement, and no evidence or
authentication is required to find the arbitration agreement exists.  (See Condee v. Longwood Mgt. Corp. (2001)
88 Cal.App.4th 215, 219.) However, if the existence of the agreement is
challenged, “petitioner bears the burden of proving [the arbitration
agreement's] existence by a preponderance of the evidence.” (Rosenthal v.
Great Western Fin. Securities Corp. (1996) 14 Cal.4th 394, 413; see also Espejo
v. Southern California Permanente Medical Group (2016) 246 Cal.App.4th
1047, 1058-1060.)¿¿¿ 
            “With respect to the moving
party's burden to provide evidence of the¿existence¿of an agreement to
arbitrate, it is generally sufficient for that party to present a copy of the
contract to the court.” (Condee, supra, 88 Cal.App.4th at p. 218;
see also Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1330 [“A petition to compel arbitration or
to stay proceedings pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 1281.2 and
1281.4 must state, in addition to other required allegations, the provisions of
the written agreement and the paragraph that provides for arbitration. The
provisions must be stated verbatim or a copy must be physically or
electronically attached to the petition and incorporated by reference”].) Once
such a document is presented to the court, the burden shifts to the party
opposing the motion to compel, who may present any challenges to the
enforcement of the agreement and evidence in support of those challenges.
[Citation]” (Baker v. Italian Maple Holdings, LLC¿(2017) 13 Cal.App.5th
1152, 1160.)¿ 
III.       DISCUSSION
            Defendant moves to compel
Plaintiff’s claims to arbitration pursuant to a Mutual Agreement to Arbitrate
Claims initialed and signed by Plaintiff. 

            The court cannot rule on
this motion.  Defendant references an
agreement to arbitrate that has not been submitted to the court.  
IV.       CONCLUSION 
            Accordingly, the Motion to Compel
Arbitration is CONTINUED to December 9, 2024, at 8:30 AM.  Defendant is ordered to re-serve and re-file
their motion with the appropriate exhibits within three court days of this
order.  Plaintiff may file an opposition
consistent with Code of Civil Procedure section 1005. 
            Defendant to give notice.
Dated:   October 23,
2024
