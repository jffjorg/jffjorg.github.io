MOTION
FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT



 
MOVING PARTY:               Defendant BNSF Railway Company 
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     Plaintiff Carnell L. Leggett 
 
 
 
I.          FACTUAL
AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND
 
This is a negligence case arising
under the Federal Employers’ Liability Act (FELA).  Plaintiff Carnell L. Leggett (Leggett or
Plaintiff) worked for defendant BNSF Railway Company (BNSF or Defendant) from
2002 to 2020, beginning as a laborer and later, as a machinist.  During that time period, Leggett was exposed
to loud noises and suffered hearing loss.  BNSF provided hearing tests to Leggett, the
results of which indicated hearing loss. 
Leggett alleges that BNSF failed to provide sufficient hearing protection
and failed to warn of frequent loud noise generated by his co-workers in the
performance of their duties.  Leggett
further alleges he first discovered he was suffering from hearing loss and
tinnitus in late 2019.    
 
On December 28, 2020, Plaintiff
filed a form complaint against BNSF for negligence under the provisions of
FELA, 45 U.S.C. §§ 51 et seq.
 
On May 10, 2024, BNSF filed this
motion for summary judgment.
 
The motion was heard on August 19,
2024.  After oral argument, the court
directed the parties to submit supplemental briefing on (1) whether Leggett’s alleged
tinnitus and hearing loss should be considered the same or distinct injuries
and (2) evidentiary issues relating to Leggett’s medical records submitted in
support of the opposition to the motion. 
The hearing was continued to October 23, 2024.
 
The issues have been briefed. The
court rules as follows.
 
II.        LEGAL
STANDARD
 
            When reviewing a motion for summary
judgment or summary adjudication, courts must apply a three-step analysis: “(1)
identify the issues framed by the pleadings; (2) determine whether the moving
party has negated the opponent’s claims; and (3) determine whether the
opposition has demonstrated the existence of a triable, material factual
issue.”¿ (Hinesley v. Oakshade Town Center (2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 289,
294.)¿ A motion for summary judgment must
be granted “if all the papers submitted show that there is no triable issue as
to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a
matter of law.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (c).)  
 
            “[T]he initial burden is always on
the moving party to make a prima facia showing that there are no triable issues
of material fact.”¿ (Scalf v. D. B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128
Cal.App.4th 1510, 1519.)¿ A defendant seeking
summary judgment “bears the burden of persuasion that there is no triable issue
of material fact and that he is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.”  (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield
Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 850 (Aguilar).)
 A defendant moving for summary judgment or summary adjudication “has met
his or her burden of showing that a cause of action has no merit if the party
has shown that one or more elements of the cause of action . . . cannot be
established, or that there is a complete defense to the cause of action.”¿
(Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2).)¿ A moving defendant need not
conclusively negate an element of plaintiff’s cause of action.¿ (Aguilar,
supra, 25 Cal.4th at p. 854.)¿ 
 
            To meet this burden of showing a
cause of action cannot be established, a defendant must show not only “that the
plaintiff does not possess needed evidence” but also that “the plaintiff
cannot reasonably obtain needed evidence.”¿ (Aguilar, supra,
25 Cal.4th at p. 854.)¿ It is insufficient for the defendant to merely point
out the absence of evidence.¿ (Gaggero v. Yura (2003) 108 Cal.App.4th
884, 891.)¿ The defendant “must also produce evidence that the plaintiff cannot
reasonably obtain evidence to support his or her claim.”¿ (Ibid.)¿ The
supporting evidence can be in the form of affidavits, declarations, admissions,
depositions, answers to interrogatories, and matters of which judicial notice
may be taken.¿ (Aguilar, supra, 25 Cal.4th at p. 855.)¿ 
 
            “Once the defendant … has met that burden, the burden
shifts to the plaintiff … to show that a triable issue of one or more material
facts exists as to the cause of action or a defense thereto.” (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 437c, subd. (p)(2).)¿The plaintiff may not merely rely on allegations or
denials of its pleadings to show that a triable issue of material fact exists,
but instead, “shall set forth the specific facts showing that a triable issue
of material fact exists as to the cause of action.”¿(Ibid.)¿ A plaintiff opposing summary judgment defeats the motion
by showing one or more triable issues of material fact exist as to the
challenged element. (Aguilar, supra, 25 Cal.4th at p. 849.)  “If
the plaintiff cannot do so, summary judgment should be granted.” (Avivi v.
Centro Medico Urgente Medical Center (2008) 159 Cal.App.4th 463,
467.)¿ 
 
            The court must “liberally construe
the evidence in support of the party opposing summary judgment and resolve all
doubts concerning the evidence in favor of that party,” including “all
inferences reasonably drawn therefrom.”¿ (Yanowitz v. L’Oreal USA, Inc.
(2005) 36 Cal.4th 1028, 1037; Aguilar, supra, 25 Cal.4th at pp.
844-45.)¿ “On a summary judgment motion, the court must therefore consider what
inferences favoring the opposing party a factfinder could reasonably draw from
the evidence.¿ While viewing the evidence in this manner, the court must bear
in mind that its primary function is to identify issues rather than to
determine issues.¿ [Citation.]¿ Only when the inferences are indisputable may
the court decide the issues as a matter of law.¿ If the evidence is in
conflict, the factual issues must be resolved by trial.” (Binder v. Aetna
Life Ins. Co. (1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 832, 839.)¿ “Put another way, have defendants
conclusively negated a necessary element of the [plaintiff’s] case or
demonstrated that under no hypothesis is there a material issue of fact that
requires the process of trial?”  (Jeld-Wen, Inc. v. Superior Court
(2005) 131 Cal.App.4th 853, 860, internal citation omitted.) Further, “the
trial court may not weigh the evidence in the manner of a factfinder to
determine whose version is more likely true.¿ [Citation.]¿ Nor may the trial
court grant summary judgment based on the court’s evaluation of credibility.¿
[Citation.]” ¿(Id. at p. 840; see also Weiss v. People ex
rel.¿Department of Transportation (2020) 9 Cal.5th 840, 864 [“Courts
deciding motions for summary judgment or summary adjudication may not weigh the
evidence but must instead view it in the light most favorable to the opposing
party and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of that party”].)¿¿
 
III.       EVIDENTIARY
OBJECTIONS
 
            A. Plaintiff’s
Objections
 
            Plaintiff
asserts twenty-seven (27) objections to BNSF’s evidence in his separate
statement in opposition to the motion for summary judgment.  Plaintiff’s objections are not in the proper
format.  “[California Rules of Court,]
[r]ule 3.1354(b) dictates the format in which evidentiary objections must be
submitted: ‘All written objections to evidence must be served and filed
separately from the other papers in support of or in opposition to the motion.
Objections on specific evidence may be referenced by the objection number in
the right column of a separate statement in opposition or reply to a motion,
but the objections must not be restated or reargued in the separate statement.’”  (Hodjat v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. (2012)
211 Cal.App.4th 1, 8.)  It is not an
abuse of discretion for the trial court to decline to rule on improperly
formatted objections or to deny an opportunity to reformat the objections.  (Id.) 

 
Accordingly, the court declines to rule
on Plaintiff’s objections.
 
            B.  BNSF’s Objections
 
            1.  BSNF’s Initial Objections[1]
 
            Plaintiff’s
Exhibits: 
 
            Objections 1,
2, and 7 to Plaintiff’s Exhibits 1 and 2 (Medical Records): SUSTAINED.  Lack of foundation and hearsay.  Plaintiff fails to submit a declaration from a
custodian of records to lay the foundation for the admission of the
records.  (See discussion re Evidence
Code § 1561/1562 below.) 
            Objection 3:
 The court declines to rule on this objection
because the underlying material is not relevant to the disposition of this
motion.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (q).) 
 
            Objection 4:
OVERRULED.
             
            Declaration
of Victor Russo:  The court declines to rule on these objections because
they are not relevant to the disposition of this motion.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (q).) 
            
            Declaration
of Carnell Leggett: 
 
            Objection 1:  SUSTAINED in part and OVERRULED in Part.  “I did not experience symptoms of hearing
loss … before 2019” is SUSTAINED.  (D’Amico
v. Board of medical Examiners (1974) 11 Cal.3d 1 (D’Amico).)  The portion related to tinnitus is OVERRULED.
  
            Objection 2
and 3: SUSTAINED.  Hearsay.
 
            Objection 4
and 5: OVERRULED.
 
            Objection 6:
SUSTAINED.  D’Amico.
 
            Objections 7
and 8: OVERRULED.   
 
            2.  BSNF’s Supplemental Objections
 
            Plaintiff’s
Exhibits:
            Objections
1 and 2 (Plaintiff’s Primary Care Medical Records):  The objections are SUSTAINED.  Defendant objects to the Affidavit on the
grounds it does not comply with Evidence Code sections 1561/1562.  The objection has merit.  Section 1561 states: 
The records shall be accompanied by the affidavit of the
custodian or other qualified witness, stating in substance each of the
following:
(1) The affiant is the duly authorized custodian of the records
or other qualified witness and has authority to certify the records.
(2) The copy is a true copy of all the records described
in the subpoena duces tecum or search warrant, or pursuant to subdivision (e)
of Section 1560, the records were delivered to the attorney, the
attorney's representative, or deposition officer for copying at the custodian's
or witness' place of business, as the case may be.
(3) The records were prepared by the personnel of the
business in the ordinary course of business at or near the time of the act,
condition, or event.
(4) The identity of the records.
(5) A description of the mode of preparation of the
records. 
Here, the Affidavit runs afoul of the foregoing
requirements. The Affidavit, although signed by the receptionist, omits the
name of the custodian of medical records. The Affidavit does state whether the
medical records are a true copy of all the records. The Affidavit also does not
state whether the records were prepared by the personnel of the business in the
ordinary course of business, let alone sufficiently identify the records or the
mode of preparation of the records.[2]
            Declaration of Victor Russo: The
court declines to rule on this objection because the underlying material is not
relevant to the disposition of this motion. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 437c,
subd. (q).)

            Objection 3:
SUSTAINED.  Evidence Code § 1523.  
 
            Objection 4:
SUSTAINED.  Evidence Code § 1523.  
 
            Objection 5:

            Dr.
Johnny Arruda: Plaintiff offered the declaration of his doctor, Dr. Johhny
Arruda, in support of his supplemental opposition.  Defendant objects to this declaration on the
ground leave was not given to submit additional evidence.[3]  However, the court did not expressly permit
or prohibit additional evidence. 
Accordingly, the objection is OVERRULED. 

 
            Objections 1
through 6: OVERRULED
 
            Objection 7:
SUSTAINED in part.  Lack of
foundation.  Plaintiff failed to
establish admissibility of Plaintiff’s medical records.  
 
IV.       DISCUSSION
 
            The
following points are not in dispute: (1) Plaintiff was exposed to frequent loud
noise during his employment with BNSF; (2) Plaintiff was provided with hearing
protection[4],
and (2) Plaintiff’s hearing was tested by BNSF as part of BNSF’s hearing
conservation program.  
 
            Under the
three-year statute of limitations for FELA actions, BNSF argues Plaintiff must
prove his claim accrued on or after December 28, 2017, which is three years
before Plaintiff filed his Complaint.  BNSF
argues Plaintiff’s claim for negligence argued accrued before December 28,
2017, because Plaintiff knew or should have known before that date (based upon
numerous hearing tests) that he suffered from hearing loss and his job was the possible
cause of his hearing loss.  
 
            Plaintiff counters
that he first discovered the issue in 2019 and, even if it manifested earlier, the
hearing loss did not become severe enough to be a disability until after
December 2017.  Plaintiff differentiates his
hearing loss from tinnitus, and argues they are distinct injuries which
presented at different times.  The court ordered
further briefing to address the latter issue.
 
1. 
Legal Principles Re: FELA 
 

            “While
injured employees in California generally are entitled to workers’ compensation
benefits regardless of whether the employer was at fault (Lab. Code, § 3200 et
seq.), those benefits are not available to railroad employees who suffer
on-the-job injuries. Instead, their right of recovery is governed by FELA,
which permits recovery only if the employer acted
negligently. [Citations.] A FELA action may be brought in either federal
or state court. [Citations.] ‘When, as here, a FELA action is brought in state
court, state law governs procedural questions, while federal law governs
substantive issues.  [Citation.]  State procedure does not apply,
however, if it results in the denial of a federal right granted by Congress.’ [Citation.]”
(Fair v. BNSF Railway Co. (2015) 238 Cal.App.4th 269, 275 (Fair).)  
 
In Monarch v. S. Pac. Transp.
Co. (1999) 70 Cal.App.4th 1197, the Second Appellate District gathered federal
authorities to describe statute of limitations in FELA cases.  It stated: 
 
The FELA provides that, “No action
shall be maintained under this chapter unless commenced within three years from
the day the cause of action accrued.” (45 U.S.C. § 56.) Compliance with the
three-year statute of limitations is a condition precedent for recovery in a
FELA action. (Emmons v. Southern Pacific Transp. Co. (5th Cir.1983) 701
F.2d 1112, 1117; Frasure v. Union Pacific R. Co. (C.D.Cal.1991) 782
F.Supp. 477, 479.) In cases of latent or progressive injuries, the “discovery
rule” directs that the cause of action does not commence to run until the
plaintiff knew or should have known of the injury and its cause. (United
States v. Kubrick (1979) 444 U.S. 111, 122–123; Dubose v. Kansas City
Southern Ry. Co. (5th Cir.1984) 729 F.2d 1026, 1028–1029; Whitman v. CSX
Transp., Inc. (E.D.Mich.1995) 887 F.Supp. 983, 989.)   
 
Under the discovery rule, the test
is an objective inquiry into whether the plaintiff knew
or should have known, in the exercise of reasonable diligence, the essential
facts of injury and cause. (Albert v. Maine Cent. R. Co. (1st
Cir.1990) 905 F.2d 541, 544; Townley v. Norfolk & Western Ry. Co.
(4th Cir.1989) 887 F.2d 498, 501; Williams v. Southern Pacific Transp. Co.
(S.D.Miss.1992) 813 F.Supp. 1227, 1231.) Constructive rather than actual
knowledge of the fact of causation triggers a duty to investigate the possible
causes of injury. (Fries v. Chicago & Northwestern Transp. Co. (7th
Cir.1990) 909 F.2d 1092, 1096; Albert v. Maine Cent. R. Co., supra, at
p. 544; Nemmers v. U. S. (7th Cir.1986) 795 F.2d 628, 631–632; Williams
v. Southern Pacific Transp. Co., supra, at p. 1232.) Thus, in accordance
with the objective test, “definite knowledge” that the injury is work related
is not necessary in order for the cause of action to accrue. (Albert v.
Maine Cent. R. Co., supra, at p. 544; Dubose v. Kansas City Southern Ry.
Co., supra, 729 F.2d at p. 1031.) Once the plaintiff believes or suspects
that the “potential cause of his injury” is work related, an affirmative
duty to investigate is imposed. (Williams v. Southern Pacific Transp. Co.,
supra, at p. 1232, italics added; see also Frasure v. Union Pacific R.
Co., supra, 782 F.Supp. at p. 480.) “A plaintiff need not be sure which
cause is predominant, as long as [he] knows or has reason to know of a potential
cause.” (Tolston v. National R.R. Passenger Corp. (7th Cir.1996) 102
F.3d 863, 865, italics added; see also Fries v. Chicago & Northwestern
Transp. Co., supra, at p. 1096; Whitman v. CSX Transp., Inc., supra,
887 F.Supp. at p. 989.) 
            
(Monarch, supra, 70 Cal.App.4th 1197 at pp. 1203–04.)  
 
Against this legal background, the court turns to the
arguments.
 
2.  Application
 
a.     
Hearing Loss
            As
discussed above, the discovery rule has two parts: (1) knowledge of the injury
and (2) knowledge of the cause. “Both components require an objective inquiry
into when the plaintiff knew or should have known, in the exercise of
reasonable diligence, the essential facts of injury and cause.” (Fries,
supra, 102 F.2d at p. 1095.)  
 
BNSF argues that Plaintiff knew or
should have known both that he suffered from hearing loss prior to December 2017,
and that his employment was the cause of the injury.  BNSF submits evidence that Plaintiff knew of
his hearing loss because he was given hearing tests every year from 2004 to
2018 (with the exception of 2009) which demonstrated his hearing loss.  (BNSF’s Undisputed Material Facts (UMF) 6, 8,
9.)  The testing results from each year
show some level of hearing loss in one or both of Plaintiff’s ears.  (See UMF 10-22.)  Further, each hearing test results report
advised Plaintiff to see an audiologist or physician regarding his hearing due
to the measured hearing loss or to follow up for further evaluation.  (UMF 23-25.)[5]  Plaintiff initialed, signed, and dated these
reports of hearing test results.  (UMF 7,
10-22.)  At his deposition, Plaintiff
admitted he understood that several of his hearing tests showed he was
suffering from hearing loss in both ears. BNSF submits sufficient evidence to
show Plaintiff knew or should have known by 2017 that he was suffering hearing
loss from work-related noise exposure.  
 
            The burden
shifts.  Plaintiff opposes summary
judgment on the following grounds: (1) he first learned he suffered from cumulative
hearing loss in 2019; (2) BNSF never advised him at any point that he had
developed cumulative hearing loss; (3) he never complained of hearing loss
prior to 2019; and (4) no medical professional advised Plaintiff that his job
with BNSF was causing hearing loss and that he needed to stop working that
job.  
 
Plaintiff misstates the operative
legal test.  Under the discovery rule,
the test is an objective inquiry into whether the plaintiff knew or should have
known, in the exercise of reasonable diligence, the essential facts of injury
and cause. (Albert v. Maine Cent. R. Co., supra, 905 F.2d at p.
544.)  Constructive rather than actual
knowledge of the fact of causation triggers a duty to investigate the possible
causes of injury. (Fries v. Chicago & Northwestern Transp. Co., supra, 909
F.2d at p. 1096; Albert v. Maine Cent. R. Co., supra, at p. 544; Nemmers
v. U. S., supra, 795 F.2d at pp. 631–632; Williams v.
Southern Pacific Transp. Co., supra, at p. 1232.) Thus, in accordance with
the objective test, “definite knowledge” that the injury is work related is not
necessary in order for the cause of action to accrue. (Albert v. Maine Cent.
R. Co., supra, at p. 544; Dubose v. Kansas City Southern Ry. Co., supra,
729 F.2d at p. 1031.)  
 
            Here,
it is undisputed BNSF provided hearing tests to Plaintiff for most of his
employment with BNSF.  Every hearing test
indicated Plaintiff suffered hearing loss.  His hearing loss manifested well
before 2017.  Accrual does not delay
until the injury reaches severity or disability.[6]  As the court stated in Fries, “[t]hat
defendant’s injury had not reached its maximum severity [ ] but continued to
progress does not affect this result. (Citation.)” (Fries, supra, 909
F.2d 1096.)  The Fries Court went
on to state: “The Urie Court sought to ameliorate the harshness of statutes of
limitations when the injury is hard to detect at its inception. In order to do
so the Court adopted the rule that in such circumstances the plaintiff cannot
be said to know of the injury—although incurred or instigated at an earlier
point in time—until it manifests itself to the individual. What the Urie Court did not do was
provide an escape for plaintiffs who are aware that some type of injury exists
yet who choose to ignore it by failing to seek diagnosis and investigate the
cause. (Citation omitted.)  The tolling
permitted by Urie only extends the limitations period to the date when the
injury manifests itself, not beyond.” (Id. at p. 1095; see also Whitman
v. CSX Transp., Inc. (1995) 887 F.Supp. 983, 991 [“The court recognizes that
under the discovery rule, a plaintiff’s claim could accrue when his hearing
loss was minimal, and the statute could expire before the plaintiff adjudged
his hearing loss sufficiently severe to warrant bringing suit”].)  Moreover, “claims for hearing loss may accrue
within the meaning of 45 USC § 56
before they are formally diagnosed by a physician or other health care
provider.”  (Whitman, supra, 887
F.Supp. at p. 992.)  Accordingly, the test
is “whether the plaintiff knew or should have known, in the exercise of
reasonable diligence, the essential facts of injury.” (Monarch, supra,
70 Cal.App.4th 1197 at pp. 1203–04.)  Applying
an objective test, Plaintiff knew or should have known by 2017 (and perhaps
earlier) he suffered from hearing loss. 
Indeed, the results of the tests confirm his hearing loss.  And he confirms knowledge of the results from
the hearing tests.  
 
Similarly, Plaintiff knew or should
have known his job with BNSF was the cause of the hearing loss.  The due diligence requirement imposes on a plaintiff,
who has reason to suspect his injury is work related, to take steps to see
whether in fact that is the case.  A
reasonable person whose employer tells him that he must wear hearing protection,
requires him to participate in a hearing conservation program, and gives him
annual hearing tests would infer that his job poses a threat to his
hearing.  Plaintiff was on ample notice
his job as opposed to his age was the likely cause of his hearing loss.  Plaintiff’s allegation that BNSF did not
actually tell him his job was the source of his hearing loss does not excuse
his failure to exercise reasonable diligence in investigating his loss of
hearing.  After all, BNSF regularly conducted
hearing tests of its employees, including Plaintiff, as part of a hearing
conservation program.  He similarly
testified that he was exposed to loud noises in the train yard where he worked.
 Moreover an “injured plaintiff need not
be certain which cause, if many are possible, is the governing cause but only
need know or have reason to know of a potential cause.” (Fries, supra, 909
F.2d at p. 1095.)  
 
Although raising an issue of fact, the
statute-of-limitations defense may be properly disposed of by summary judgment
if “where the uncontradicted facts established through discovery are
susceptible of only one legitimate inference[.]” (Jolly v. Eli Lilly &
Co. (1988) 44 Cal.3d 1103, 1112.)  Here, the uncontradicted facts are
susceptible of only one legitimate inference: Plaintiff knew he suffered from
hearing loss based upon the test results and notices  from BNSF. 
Plaintiff knew or reasonably should have known his employment was the
cause of his hearing loss.  
 
Plaintiff’s cause of action based
on hearing loss accrued before December 28, 2017.  Plaintiff did not bring this action until
December 28, 2020.  The FELA cause of
action based on hearing loss is time barred. 

 
b.      Tinnitus
With respect to Plaintiff’s claim
regarding tinnitus, the court must decide (1) whether hearing loss and tinnitus
are distinct injuries, and (2) whether Plaintiff’s claim accrued in 2017 or
2019.  
 
The court has reviewed the
supplemental briefing.  The court finds
there is a triable issue whether tinnitus and hearing loss are separate and
distinct injuries.  BNSF cites several
cases for the general proposition that hearing loss and tinnitus are the same
injury.  (See, Miles v. Principal Life
Ins. Co. (2d Cir. 2013) 720 F.3d 472, 487 (“Tinnitus is consistent with
hearing loss, for which there are objective tests, and the record indicates
that there is undisputed objective evidence of such hearing loss in Miles's
case.”); Tufariello v. Long Island R.R. (2d Cir. 2006) 458 F.3d 80, 89 (“The
causal link Tufariello seeks to establish between hearing loss and repeated
exposure to noise so loud that it causes physical pain or ear-ringing is, as we
have noted, widely known and, so far as we are aware, not the subject of
scientific dispute. It is, indeed, not so very far from the connection between
‘a broken leg’ and ‘being struck by an automobile.’”); Wyatt v. CSX Transp.,
Inc. (E.D. Tenn. Oct. 30, 1997) 1997 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 23815, at *19
(discussing “tinnitus or a ringing in his ears” as a symptom of the claimed
hearing loss and referring to plaintiff’s “hearing loss symptoms”); Anthony
v. CONRAIL (N.D.N.Y. Sept. 30, 1998) 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15583 (summary
judgment granted on a claim of “damage to his ears and hearing, including
hearing loss and tinnitus” because plaintiff should have known “that he had an
injury to his ears.”); Robb v. CSX Transp., Inc. (1992) 204 Ga.App. 690,
693-694 (upholding grant of summary judgment despite plaintiff claiming that he
did not realize he had hearing damage until he experienced a “constant,
tinnitus, or ringing in his ears…,” because it was “clear to [the court] that
plaintiff's hearing loss manifested itself at least by 1983 and that plaintiff
knew at that time that his condition was caused by on-the-job noise”).)
 
This case is distinguishable.  In the foregoing authorities, hearing loss
and tinnitus (or “ear-ringing”) were treated as the same injury.  However, there is no indication that the conditions
were alleged to be distinct conditions or that any evidence was presented to
support that proposition.  And unlike
BNSF’s authorities, Plaintiff here presents evidence to show hearing loss and
tinnitus are distinct conditions.  Specifically,
Plaintiff offers the declaration of Dr. Arruda who states the following:
 
17. Hearing loss
occurs when someone has difficulty hearing thresholds of 20 decibels (dB) or
less in either one or both ears. 
 
18. Tinnitus occurs
when an individual experiences phantom sounds such as roaring, ringing, or
buzzing in one or both ears. 
 
19. Tinnitus is the
opposite of hearing loss, because hearing loss is a decrease in the ability to
hear, whereas tinnitus creates a noise (i.e. ringing in the ears). 
 
20. Based on my
knowledge, experience, and observations made while diagnosing and treating
symptoms of tinnitus patients, noise-induced tinnitus may occur in the absence
of noise induced hearing loss. In other words, either condition can occur
without the other. Those who are diagnosed with hearing loss do not necessarily
have tinnitus. Hearing loss and tinnitus do not always develop simultaneously.  
 
21. In some cases,
hearing loss can be associated with tinnitus. However, the intensity of the
tinnitus can change over time or even subside or present sometime after the
hearing loss. There is a long list of issues that can contribute to tinnitus
including temporo-mandibular joint dysfunction, anxiety, stress, migraines,
brain tumors or trauma, autoimmune disorders, and vestibular disorders such a
Meniere's disease. 
 
22. Hearing loss and
tinnitus require separate treatment because they are considered separate
conditions and therefore must be treated accordingly. In essence, tinnitus is
not a worsened condition of hearing loss. 
 
23. Tinnitus is not
in any way an aggravation of the underlying hearing loss. Nor is tinnitus a
mere continuation of an underlying hearing condition such as hearing loss.
Therefore, tinnitus is considered a separate and distinct condition. 
 
24. Tinnitus and
hearing loss are treated as distinct and separate disabilities because tinnitus
is a condition of the nervous system whereas hearing loss results from damage
to organs in the ear canal. 
 
25. In fact, one can
have damage to the organs in the ear canal due to continuous exposure to
excessive noise and develop tinnitus without hearing loss. 
 
26. Furthermore,
tinnitus can develop suddenly due to cumulative trauma over time or due to a
one-time trauma. Mr. Leggett developed tinnitus suddenly due to noise exposure
at work, in addition to his extensive exposure to loud noise on a daily basis
while at work.   
 
(Arruda Decl., ¶¶ 17-26.)
 
            Dr. Arruda
unequivocally describes the way in which tinnitus and hearing loss may be
separate and distinct.  The court has no
occasion to find otherwise.[7]  
 
            Further,
Plaintiff provides evidence to show he did not present with symptoms of
tinnitus until late 2019.  At his
deposition, Plaintiff testified as follows: 
 
Q: Okay. Did you
have ringing in the ears, if you can recall, when you went to see Dr. Guaidez
in 2019? Was that one of your complaints? 
 
A: Yes, sir. It just
seemed like it all just came up. Just like, boom, it’s there. … 
 
Q: When you went to
Dr. Guaidez in 2019 with all of these problems you described for me, was one of
the problems you told him about ringing in your ears? 
 
A: Yes, sir. 
 
Q: Okay. And how
long – can you estimate for me how long you felt like you had ringing in your
ears before you reported that to Dr. Guaidez in 2019? 
 
A: I don’t know,
sir. It just – like I said, it just seemed like everything just – boom, it came
up on – up on me – 
 
Q: Okay.
 
 A: - at the same time.  
 
Q: Okay. Did you
have ringing in your ears a year before you went to see Dr. Guaidez? So in
2018. 
 
A: No, sir. 
 
Q: Did you have
ringing in your ears in 2017? 
 
A: 2017. No, sir.
 
(Leggett Depo., pp. 50:2-6, 50:10-51:4.)  Plaintiff further testified:
 
Q: I think you told
me that this ringing in the ear, the tinnitus, came on around the time that you
went to see Dr. Guaidez in 2019; is that correct? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
(Leggett Depo.,
p. 113:10-14.)
 
            In his
declaration, Plaintiff confirms the approximate onset of his tinnitus.   He states, “The first time I had any
concerns about tinnitus was in late 2019. I therefore made an appointment to
see my primary care physician, Dr. Jesse Guadiz, on January 15, 2020, because I
had suddenly started to experience ringing in my ears. (See, Exhibit 2 to Russo
Decl)”.  (Leggett Decl., ¶ 12.)  The evidence presented shows Plaintiff’s
tinnitus presented as early as late 2019. This action followed approximately a
year later.  Plaintiff’s FELA cause of
action based on tinnitus is not time barred.
            
            For the reasons
discussed herein, the court finds there is a triable issue on whether hearing
loss and tinnitus are separate injuries, and although Plaintiff’s claim for
hearing loss accrued prior to December 28, 2017[8],
Plaintiff’s claim for tinnitus accrued in late 2022.  For these reasons, Plaintiff’s single cause
of action under FELA is not time-barred. 

 
V.        CONCLUSION

 
            The court
will hear from the parties regarding Defendant’s request to depose Dr. Arruda.
