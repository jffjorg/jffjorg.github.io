And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled on a motion to compel arbitration filed by The Cheesecake Factory Inc. (Defendant) against Harold Benso Edwards Streeter (Plaintiff), who is self-represented. The motion was filed on September 6, 2024, and no opposition has been filed. The judge notes that the Defendant references an agreement to arbitrate that has not been submitted to the court and therefore cannot rule on the motion. The motion is continued to December 9, 2024, at 8:30 AM, and the Defendant is ordered to re-serve and re-file their motion with the appropriate exhibits within three court days of this order.
