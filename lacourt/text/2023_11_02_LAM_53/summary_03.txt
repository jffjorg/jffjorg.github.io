And here is the summary in English text:

The judge issues a tentative ruling denying Defendant Yang Lu's motion for summary judgment or, in the alternative, summary adjudication. The motion was filed on January 4, 2023, and a hearing was scheduled for October 19, 2023, which was vacated due to changes in assigned judges. The notice of motion was served by electronic service on August 18, 2023, but the court finds that it was served one court day late, violating the 75-day notice requirement by Code of Civil Procedure section 437c. Although Plaintiff filed opposition papers arguing the merits of the motion, the court holds that Plaintiff properly objected to and raised the issue of insufficient notice. Therefore, the court denies the motion on the ground of insufficient notice.
