Motion
to Strike Punitive Damages and Double and Treble Damages
The court
considered the moving and reply papers filed in connection with defendant
Southern California Edison Company’s motion to strike.  No opposition papers were filed as to that
motion. 
BACKGROUND
Plaintiff David Gastelo (“Plaintiff”) filed the Complaint in this
action on March 20, 2023, against defendants Southern California Edison Company
and Edison International.  Plaintiff
alleges 10 causes of action[1]
for (1) negligence; (2) inverse condemnation; (3) trespass; (4) private
nuisance; (5) public nuisance; (6) violation of Public Utilities Code section
2106; (7) violation of Health and Safety Code section 13007; (8) strict
liability; (9) breach of contract; and (10) civil remedies under Penal Code
section 496.
On May 12, 2023, defendants Edison International and Southern
California Edison Company separately filed responsive pleadings directed to
Plaintiff’s Complaint. 
DEFENDANT SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON
COMPANY’S MOTION TO STRIKE
Defendant Southern California Edison Company (“SCE”) moves the court
for an order striking from Plaintiff’s Complaint the following: (1) paragraphs
8, 23, 24, 32, 39, 41, 47, 70, 75, 79, and 96, in their entirety, and (2)
paragraphs 3 and 14 of the Prayer, in their entirety. 
The court notes that Plaintiff has not filed opposition papers with
the court.  However, the reply papers
filed by SCE on October 27, 2023, appear to reference an opposition.  (SCE Reply filed Oct. 27, 2023, pp. 1:23
[“The Opposition misses the most important point” of the motion], 2:5-6
[“Plaintiff’s opposition merely recites portions of his Complaint”], 2:25
[Plaintiff “re-writes portions of his complaint in the opposition”].)  Thus, it appears that Plaintiff served an
opposition on defendant SCE but failed to file his opposition with the court. 
The court therefore exercises its discretion to continue the hearing
on defendant SCE’s motion to strike in order to give Plaintiff the opportunity
to file with the court the opposition papers that he served on defendant SCE. 
DEFENDANT EDISON INTERNATIONAL’S
DEMURRER AND MOTION TO STRIKE
Defendant Edison International filed, on May 12, 2023, a demurrer and
motion to strike directed to Plaintiff’s Complaint.
On October 30, 2023, Plaintiff filed a Request for Dismissal as to
defendant Edison International.  Pursuant
to that request, the clerk dismissed defendant Edison International from this
action on October 30, 2023. 
The court therefore takes off calendar defendant Edison
International’s demurrer and motion to strike as moot.[2]
ORDER

The court orders that defendant Edison International’s (1) demurrer to
complaint, and   (2) motion to strike punitive damages and
double and treble damages are taken off calendar as moot. 
The court orders that the hearing on defendant Southern California
Edison Company’s motion to strike punitive damages and double and treble
damages is continued to November 27, 2023, at 10:00 a.m., in Department 53. 
The court orders plaintiff David Gastelo to file any opposition papers
served on defendant Southern California Edison Company in connection with the
motion to strike punitive damages and double and treble damages with the court
no later than November 8, 2023. 
The court orders defendant Southern California Edison Company to give
notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
 
DATED:  November 2, 2023
