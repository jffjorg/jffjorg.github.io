  Order RE:
 
defendant’s motion for sanctions
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                 Defendant Interinsurance
Exchange of the Automobile Club    
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Plaintiff Onnik Kazanchian
Motion for Sanctions
The court
considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers filed in connection with
this motion. 
DISCUSSION
Defendant Interinsurance Exchange of the Automobile Club (“Defendant”)
moves the court for an order granting monetary sanctions in the amount of
$1,927 in its favor and against plaintiff Onnik Kazanchian (“Plaintiff”) based
on Plaintiff’s failure to appear at the inspection of his vehicle.
First, as a threshold matter, the court notes that judgment was
entered in favor of Defendant and against Plaintiff on Plaintiff’s Complaint on
October 20, 2023.  The “‘general rule’
[is] that ‘once a party has been dismissed from an action[,] he is no longer a
party and the court lacks jurisdiction to conduct any further proceedings as to
him.’”  (Day v. Collingwood (2006)
144 Cal.App.4th 1116, 1124.)  But a
dismissed party “‘may still have collateral statutory rights which the court
must determine and enforce.’ 
[Citation.]  Among these
collateral rights are ‘the right to statutory costs and attorneys fees[,]’” and
to recover sanctions.  (Ibid.)   
Second, the court finds that Defendant has not moved pursuant to a
statutory provision entitling it to an award of monetary sanctions against
Plaintiff and therefore denies Defendant’s motion. 
In support of its motion, Defendant cites Code of Civil Procedure
sections 2031.010, 2023.010, and 2023.030. 
However, none of these statutory provisions provides for the recovery of
monetary sanctions.  Section 2031.010
provides that a party may obtain discovery as set forth therein but does not
state that any noncompliance with that statute entitles a party to an award of
monetary sanctions.  Thus, the court
finds that section 2031.010 does not support Defendant’s request for an award
of monetary sanctions against Plaintiff.
Similarly, section 2023.010 sets forth misuses of the discovery
process, but does not include a provision allowing for the recovery of
sanctions.  Further, while section
2023.030 authorizes the imposition of monetary sanctions, it does so “[t]o the
extent authorized by the chapter governing any particular discovery method or
any other provision” of the Civil Discovery Act.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030; New
Albertsons, Inc. v. Superior Court (2008) 168 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1422.)  Thus, “sections 2023.010 and 2023.030 do not
independently authorize the trial court to impose monetary sanctions for misuse
of discovery.”  (City of Los Angeles
v. PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLC (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 466, 504, review
granted January 25, 2023, S277211; New Albertsons, Inc., supra, 168
Cal.App.4th at p. 1422 [“the statutes governing the particular discovery
methods limit the permissible sanctions to those sanctions provided under the
applicable governing statutes.”].)  The
court therefore finds that Code of Civil Procedure sections 2023.010 and
2023.030, unaccompanied by any other statutory provision allowing for the
recovery of sanctions, do not support Defendant’s request for an award of
monetary sanctions against Plaintiff.
 
 
ORDER
            The court denies defendant
Interinsurance Exchange of the Automobile Club’s motion for sanctions. 
            The court orders plaintiff Onnik
Kazanchian to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
