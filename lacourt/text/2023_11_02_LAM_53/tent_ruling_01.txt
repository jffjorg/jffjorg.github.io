RESPONDING
PARTY:       Defendants Laura Rubenstein,
as an individual, as trustee of the Edith Rubenstein Trust, and as executor of
the Estate of Edith Rubenstein 
Motion to Tax Costs
The court
considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers filed in connection with
this motion. 
DISCUSSION
Plaintiff Rick Foster aka Eric Rubenstein (“Plaintiff”) filed this
action on November 9, 2018, against defendants Laura Rubenstein, as an
individual, as trustee of the Edith Rubenstein Trust, and as executor of the
Estate of Edith Rubenstein (“Defendants”).
On October 28, 2022, the court granted its own motion for judgment on
the pleadings as to Plaintiff’s Complaint on the ground that the court did not
have jurisdiction over the subject matter therein because Plaintiff’s causes of
action were subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the probate court.  (Oct. 28, 2022 Order, p. 2:7-9.)  Thereafter, on December 17, 2022, the court
entered judgment of dismissal of Plaintiff’s Complaint. 
On December 28, 2022, Defendants filed their Memorandum of Costs (on Judicial
Council form MC-010), requesting $4,804.75 in costs.  Plaintiff now moves the court for an order
taxing the costs requested in Item 16 for “Mediation, CourtCall, parking,
mileage, parking, [and] courier” in the amount of $2,268.83.  (MC-010, p. 1, ¶ 16.)  In opposition, Defendants have withdrawn
“their requests for mileage and parking” and now seek a modified award of costs
in the amount of $2,168.75 for costs relating to mediation, CourtCall, and
courier services.  (Opp, p. 2:6-9;
Dorenfeld Decl., ¶ 4.) 
“‘In ruling upon a motion to tax costs, the trial court’s first
determination is whether the statute expressly allows the particular item and
whether it appears proper on its face. 
“If so, the burden is on the objecting party to show [the costs] to be
unnecessary or unreasonable.” 
[Citation.]  Where costs are not
expressly allowed by the statute, the burden is on the party claiming the costs
to show that the charges were reasonable and necessary.’”  (Rozanova v. Uribe (2021) 68
Cal.App.5th 392, 399; Foothill-De Anza Community College Dist. v. Emerich (2007)
158 Cal.App.4th 11, 29 [“Where costs are not expressly allowed by the statute,
the burden is on the party claiming the costs to show that the charges were
reasonable and necessary”].)  Because Code
of Civil Procedure section 1033.5, subdivision (a) does not expressly provide
for the recovery of costs expended for mediation, CourtCall, and courier
services, Defendants are required to show that such costs were reasonable.  (Rozanova, supra, 68
Cal.App.5th at p. 399.)  
The court finds that Defendants have shown that (1) the mediation
costs in the amount of $1,800.75, and (2) the CourtCall costs in the amount of
$218 are reasonable in amount and were reasonably necessary to the conduct of
the litigation.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 1033.5, subd. (c); Dorenfeld Decl., Ex. A [receipt showing $1,800.75 was
paid for mediation]; Dorenfeld Decl., Ex. C [receipts showing $218 incurred for
CourtCall fees for the appearances on October 31, 2019, August 6, 2019,
February 26, 2021, and March 10, 2021]; Gibson v. Bobroff (1996) 49
Cal.App.4th 1202, 1209-1210 [award of mediation fees may be recoverable as
reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation].)  The court therefore denies Plaintiff’s motion
to tax those costs.  The court finds that
Defendants have not shown that the courier fees in the amount of $150 were
reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation and therefore grants
Plaintiff’s motion to tax costs in that amount. 

Thus, the court orders that Defendants’ memorandum of costs shall be
taxed in the total amount of $250.08, consisting of (1) $100.08 in parking and
mileage costs, as withdrawn by Defendants in their opposition, and (2) $150 in
courier fees.  (Dorenfeld Decl.,
¶ 4.)  
ORDER
            The court grants in part plaintiff
Rick Foster’s motion to tax costs as follows. 
            The court orders that $250.08 in
costs claimed by defendants Laura Rubenstein, as an individual, as trustee of
the Edith Rubenstein Trust, and as executor of the Estate of Edith Rubenstein
in Item 16 of their Memorandum of Costs (Judicial Council form MC-010), filed
with the court on December 28, 2022, is stricken. 
            The court therefore orders that
defendants Laura Rubenstein, as an individual, as trustee of the Edith
Rubenstein Trust, and as executor of the Estate of Edith Rubenstein are
entitled to costs in the modified total amount of $4,554.67.
The court orders defendants to
give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
