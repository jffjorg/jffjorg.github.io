And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the defendant's motion for monetary sanctions against the plaintiff, Onnik Kazanchian, in the amount of $1,927. The defendant argues that the plaintiff's failure to appear at the inspection of his vehicle warrants the imposition of sanctions. However, the court finds that the defendant has not moved pursuant to a statutory provision entitling it to an award of monetary sanctions and therefore denies the motion. The court notes that the plaintiff was dismissed from the action on October 20, 2023, and that the general rule is that once a party has been dismissed from an action, the court lacks jurisdiction to conduct any further proceedings as to him. The court also finds that the statutes cited by the defendant, Code of Civil Procedure sections 2031.010, 2023.010, and 2023.030, do not provide for the recovery of monetary sanctions. The court therefore denies the defendant's motion for sanctions.
