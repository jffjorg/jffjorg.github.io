Here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge regarding a hearing in a breach of contract action between TIANYI INTERNATIONAL TRADE, INC. (Cross-Defendant) and SH, LLC (Cross-Complainant). The Cross-Complaint alleges that Cross-Defendant improperly terminated the lease and failed to return the Security Deposit. Cross-Defendant demurred, arguing that the Cross-Complaint fails to establish lawful performance of the lease, that the claims are foreclosed under the lease terms, that SH is estopped from alleging a breach, and that the common law doctrines of Frustration of Purpose, Impossibility, and Impracticability excuse Cross-Defendant's non-performance. The judge overruled the demurrer, finding that the allegations are sufficient, and ordered Cross-Defendant to answer within 20 days. The judge also granted Cross-Defendant's Request for Judicial Notice and ordered Cross-Complainant to give notice to Cross-Defendant.

## English Summary

The Judge has ruled that SH, LLC's cross-complaint against Tianyi International Trade, Inc. will proceed. 

The Judge found that Sh's allegations regarding Tianyi's breach of contract are sufficient to survive the demurrer (a legal challenge to the complaint). 

Specifically, the Judge determined that Sh adequately alleged the existence of a lease agreement, its performance, Tianyi's alleged breach, and resulting damages.


The Judge also ruled that Tianyi's request for judicial notice regarding certain documents is granted, but only as to the existence of the documents, not any hearsay statements they may contain. Tianyi must now answer the cross-complaint within 20 days.

English summary:

The tentative ruling is for the case number 22NWCV01025, which will take place on September 21, 2023, in Dept C. The case is between TIANYI INTERNATIONAL TRADE INC. (Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant) and SH, LLC and HUA LIU (Defendants/Cross-Complainant).

The Plaintiff filed a breach of contract action against the Defendants on October 17, 2022. The Defendants filed a cross-complaint on March 7, 2023, alleging that the Plaintiff terminated the lease without proper cause and vacated the premises. The Defendants also retained the security deposit as payment for the unpaid business rent.

The Plaintiff's demurrer to the cross-complaint is overruled, and the Defendants are required to answer within 20 days. The request for judicial notice is granted as to the existence of the documents but not as to any hearsay statements contained therein.

The cross-complaint asserts one cause of action for breach of contract, alleging that the Plaintiff terminated the lease without proper cause and owes the Defendants unpaid business rent. The Plaintiff generally demurs, arguing that the cross-complaint fails because the Defendants failed to provide abatement of rent, timely commence repairs, and that the Plaintiff lawfully terminated the lease.

The court overrules the demurrer to the first cause of action, finding that the Plaintiff's allegations are sufficient, and the arguments raised by the Defendants are factual determinations inappropriate at this stage in the proceedings.
