Here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge regarding a hearing in a breach of contract action between TIANYI INTERNATIONAL TRADE, INC. (Cross-Defendant) and SH, LLC (Cross-Complainant). The Cross-Complaint alleges that Cross-Defendant improperly terminated the lease and failed to return the Security Deposit. Cross-Defendant demurred, arguing that the Cross-Complaint fails to establish lawful performance of the lease, that the claims are foreclosed under the lease terms, that SH is estopped from alleging a breach, and that the common law doctrines of Frustration of Purpose, Impossibility, and Impracticability excuse Cross-Defendant's non-performance. The judge overruled the demurrer, finding that the allegations are sufficient, and ordered Cross-Defendant to answer within 20 days. The judge also granted Cross-Defendant's Request for Judicial Notice and ordered Cross-Complainant to give notice to Cross-Defendant.
