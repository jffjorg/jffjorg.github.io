Significant Statements:

  - "Equitable estoppel would apply if the plaintiffs had sued [the manufacturer] based on the terms of the sale contract yet denied [the manufacturer] could enforce the arbitration clause in that contract."
  - "Plaintiff's claims do not arise directly out of the RISC, even if Defendant's warranties accompanied the sale of the subject vehicle."
  - "The RISC includes no warranty, any assurance regarding the quality of the vehicle, no promise to make repairs, and disclaims any manufacturer warranty."

And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge has denied the Defendant's Motion to Compel Arbitration and Stay Proceedings. The Plaintiff had purchased a 2019 Nissan Sentra in 2019, which was defective and attempts to repair failed. The Defendant seeks to compel arbitration under the Retail Installment Sales Contract (RISC) and its accompanying arbitration agreement. The Judge has determined that the RISC is not enforceable and that the Arbitration Agreement is not binding. The Judge has also found that the Plaintiff's claims do not arise directly out of the RISC, even if the Defendant's warranties accompanied the sale of the subject vehicle. The Judge has denied the Defendant's motion to compel arbitration, citing the lack of evidence that the Plaintiff's claims arise from and are intimately founded in and intertwined with the sales contract.
