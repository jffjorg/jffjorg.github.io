```

And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge has denied the Defendant's Motion to Compel Arbitration and Stay Proceedings. The Plaintiff had purchased a 2019 Nissan Sentra in 2019, which was defective and attempts to repair failed. The Defendant seeks to compel arbitration under the Retail Installment Sales Contract (RISC) and its accompanying arbitration agreement. The Judge has determined that the RISC is not enforceable and that the Arbitration Agreement is not binding. The Judge has also found that the Plaintiff's claims do not arise directly out of the RISC, even if the Defendant's warranties accompanied the sale of the subject vehicle. The Judge has denied the Defendant's motion to compel arbitration, citing the lack of evidence that the Plaintiff's claims arise from and are intimately founded in and intertwined with the sales contract.

**English Summary:**

The Judge denies Defendant Nissan North America, Inc.'s motion to compel arbitration. The Judge finds that Plaintiff's claims arise from Nissan's statutory obligations under the Song-Beverly Act, not from the terms of the Retail Installment Sales Contract (RISC) containing the arbitration agreement. The Judge notes that while the RISC allows for arbitration of disputes with third parties, it does not demonstrate an intent to include the manufacturer in this scope.

```

And here is the summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling is that Defendant Nissan North America, Inc.'s Motion to Compel Arbitration and Stay Proceedings is denied. The judge states that Defendant has met its burden of proving a valid arbitration agreement, but the plaintiff's claims do not arise from and are not intimately founded in and intertwined with the sales contract. Instead, the plaintiff's claims arise from Defendant's statutory obligation and are not based on any express contractual language. The judge also holds that Defendant is not a third-party beneficiary as contemplated by the Retail Installment Sales Contract (RISC) and therefore cannot enforce the Arbitration Agreement. As a result, the motion to compel arbitration and stay proceedings is denied.

English summary:
The case is 22NWCV01125, heard on September 21, 2023 in department C. Plaintiff GARCIA sued Defendant NISSAN NORTH AMERICA, INC. Defendant seeks to compel arbitration under the Retail Installment Sales Contract and stay proceedings. However, this motion is denied. Plaintiff does not dispute the existence of a valid arbitration agreement, and Defendant provided a copy of the RISC containing the arbitration provision. However, equitable estoppel does not apply as Plaintiff's claims arise from statutory obligations and not express contractual language. Additionally, Defendant cannot enforce the arbitration agreement as a third-party beneficiary, as the RISC does not reveal a motivating purpose to include Defendant. Plaintiff's Request for Judicial Notice is granted.
