And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge has denied the Defendant's Motion to Compel Arbitration and Stay Proceedings. The Plaintiff had purchased a 2019 Nissan Sentra in 2019, which was defective and attempts to repair failed. The Defendant seeks to compel arbitration under the Retail Installment Sales Contract (RISC) and its accompanying arbitration agreement. The Judge has determined that the RISC is not enforceable and that the Arbitration Agreement is not binding. The Judge has also found that the Plaintiff's claims do not arise directly out of the RISC, even if the Defendant's warranties accompanied the sale of the subject vehicle. The Judge has denied the Defendant's motion to compel arbitration, citing the lack of evidence that the Plaintiff's claims arise from and are intimately founded in and intertwined with the sales contract.

**English Summary:**

The Judge notes that while the RISC allows for arbitration of disputes with third parties, it does not demonstrate an intent to include the manufacturer in this scope.

And here is the summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling is that Defendant Nissan North America, Inc.'s Motion to Compel Arbitration and Stay Proceedings is denied. The judge states that Defendant has met its burden of proving a valid arbitration agreement, but the plaintiff's claims do not arise from and are not intimately founded in and intertwined with the sales contract. Instead, the plaintiff's claims arise from Defendant's statutory obligation and are not based on any express contractual language. The judge also holds that Defendant is not a third-party beneficiary as contemplated by the Retail Installment Sales Contract (RISC) and therefore cannot enforce the Arbitration Agreement. As a result, the motion to compel arbitration and stay proceedings is denied.

## Case Summary: Garcia v. Nissan North America, Inc.

**Case Number:** 22NWCV01125
**Hearing Date:** September 21, 2023
**Department:** C 

**Parties:**

* **Plaintiff:** GARCIA
* **Defendant:** NISSAN NORTH AMERICA, INC.

**Summary:**

This case involves a dispute between Garcia (Plaintiff) and Nissan North America, Inc. (Defendant) concerning a defective 2019 Nissan Sentra.  

The Plaintiff filed a complaint alleging violations of the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act against Defendant. Defendant moved to compel arbitration based on an arbitration agreement within the Retail Installment Sales Contract (RISC) Garcia signed when purchasing the vehicle.

**Judge's Ruling:**

The Judge denied Defendant's motion to compel arbitration and stay proceedings. 

**Key Points:**

* **Arbitration Agreement:** The RISC contains an arbitration agreement that covers disputes arising out of the purchase, condition, or any related transactions of the vehicle. 
* **Equitable Estoppel:** The Court analyzed whether equitable estoppel could apply to compel arbitration despite Garcia not signing the agreement.  The Court found that Garcia's claims are based on Defendant's statutory obligations under the Song-Beverly Act, not the contractual terms of the RISC. Therefore, equitable estoppel does not apply because the claims are not "intimately founded in and intertwined" with the contract.
* **Third-Party Beneficiary:** The Court rejected Defendant's argument that it is a third-party beneficiary to the RISC. The language in the agreement does not demonstrate an intent to include manufacturers like Defendant.

**Legal Basis:**

* **California Code of Civil Procedure:**  Sections pertaining to arbitration.
* **California Evidence Code:** Section 452 regarding judicial notice.
* **Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act:**  Applicable to the Plaintiff's claims against Defendant.
* **Case Law:**

    * **Omar v. Ralphs Grocery Co. (2004):** Establishes the burden of proof for compelling arbitration.
    * **Banner Entertainment, Inc. v. Superior Court (1998):**  Defines the burden of proof for establishing a valid arbitration agreement and defending against it.
    * **Felisilda v. FCA US LLC (2020):**  Discusses equitable estoppel in the context of arbitration agreements and non-signatories.
    * **Ford Motor Warranty Cases (2023):**  Disagrees with Felisilda and holds that equitable estoppel does not apply when a plaintiff's claims are based on statutory obligations rather than contractual terms.
    * **Jensen v. U-Haul Co. of California (2017):** Defines the criteria for determining third-party beneficiary status.
    * **Lucas v. Hamm (1961):** Clarifies that mere incidental or remote benefit does not make a party a third-party beneficiary.
    * **Goonewardene v. ADP, LLC (2019):**  Provides further guidance on the requirements for establishing third-party beneficiary status.
    * **Hess v. Ford Motor Co. (2002):**  Emphasizes the need for intent to benefit a third party when determining third-party beneficiary status.

**Outcome:** The Plaintiff's case will proceed in court, as the Judge denied the Defendant's motion to compel arbitration.
