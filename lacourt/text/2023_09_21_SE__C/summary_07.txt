## English Summary

The judge has tentatively ruled that the school district's demurrer to parts of the plaintiff’s complaint is **sustained** (meaning the complaint is rejected) with leave to amend.

The plaintiff's complaint alleges negligence against the school district in connection with a student-on-student assault that occurred on school grounds. The judge found that the complaint did not adequately identify a specific law (a statute) that would allow the school district to be held liable for negligence in this situation.  

The plaintiff will have 30 days to amend their complaint and try to fix this issue. The judge also ruled that a separate motion to strike portions of the complaint is now moot (meaning it’s no longer relevant) because of the ruling on the demurrer.

And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of John Doe v. ABC Unified School District, et al. The case involves a personal injury action filed by John Doe, a minor, and his guardians, against the school district, the board of education, and several individuals who allegedly attacked John Doe at Cerritos High School on March 11, 2022.

The Judge has sustained the defendant's demurrer to the complaint, meaning that the complaint fails to state a cause of action. The Judge has given the plaintiffs 30 days to amend their complaint. The Judge has also ruled that the motion to strike certain portions of the complaint is moot, as the demurrer has been sustained.

The Judge's ruling is based on the fact that the complaint fails to identify statutory grounds for liability against the public entity, the school district. The Judge has cited several California cases to support this ruling, including Butler v. Sequeira, Khoury v. Maly's of Calif. Inc., Eastburn v. Regional Fire Protection Authority, and Searcy v. Hemet Unified School Dist.

The case will proceed with the plaintiffs having 30 days to amend their complaint.

The Judge has ruled on a legal challenge (a demurrer) filed by the ABC UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT against a lawsuit filed on behalf of John DOE, a minor who was assaulted at school. The Judge has agreed with the school district that the lawsuit's initial claims of negligence need to be more specific about the laws that the school district allegedly broke.  

The Judge has given the Plaintiffs 30 days to revise their complaint and make it stronger. The school district had also asked to have parts of the lawsuit removed, but this request is now irrelevant because the Judge's decision focuses on requiring the Plaintiffs to clarify their initial claims.
