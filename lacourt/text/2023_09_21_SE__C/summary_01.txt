And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the Defendants' Motion to Lift the Discovery Stay is denied. The Judge grants the Defendants' Joinder to the Motion to Lift Discovery Stay. The Judge also denies the Defendants' request to specially set their Motion for Determination of Privilege and Motion to Compel Testimony for hearing on September 22, 2023.

The case involves a dispute between Saadia Square, LLC (the plaintiff) and several All-Ways entities (the defendants) over a property in Rialto, California. The defendants are seeking to lift the discovery stay that was imposed in connection with Saadia's anti-SLAPP Motion. The Judge finds that the defendants have not demonstrated good cause to lift the discovery stay and that allowing discovery to go forward in connection with Saadia's Second Amended Complaint would be unfair to Saadia.

**English Summary:**

The Judge issued a tentative ruling denying the motion by several defendant companies (Rialto Merrill Holdings, Inc., All-Ways Pacific, LLC, All-Ways Far East, LLC, and All-Ways Forwarding International, Inc.) to lift the discovery stay in this case. The stay was put in place due to Saadia Square, LLC's (the plaintiff) anti-SLAPP motion against a cross-complaint filed by All-Ways Pacific, LLC.

The Judge found that the defendants did not demonstrate good cause for lifting the stay, as the discovery they sought was related to overlapping issues in the main lawsuit and the cross-complaint, particularly regarding Saadia's state of mind when asserting a Right of First Offer (ROFO).  


The Judge also noted that while the defendants had raised procedural arguments, they lacked merit. The Court recognized the defendants' right to seek reconsideration of the discovery stay but ultimately decided that the stay should remain in place.

Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendants' motion to lift the discovery stay in this case. The defendants, Rialto Merrill Holdings, Inc., All-Ways Pacific, LLC, All-Ways Far East, LLC, and All-Ways Forwarding International, Inc., had sought to lift the stay in order to conduct discovery in connection with the plaintiff's second amended complaint. The plaintiff, Saadia Square, LLC, had filed an anti-SLAPP motion against the defendants' cross-complaint, and the discovery stay was put in place to allow the anti-SLAPP motion to be heard. The judge has determined that the defendants have not shown good cause to lift the discovery stay and that allowing discovery to go forward at this time would prejudice the plaintiff.

Summary:
This is a summary of a tentative ruling by a Judge regarding the case of SAADIA SQUARE, LLC vs ALL-WAYS PACIFIC, LLC. The case involves multiple causes of action, including Breach of Contract, Breach of Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing, Intentional Interference, Specific Performance and Injunctive Relief, and Declaratory Relief. SAADIA SQUARE, LLC alleges that ALL-WAYS PACIFIC, LLC interfered with its Right of First Offer (ROFO) for a property located in Rialto, California. ALL-WAYS PACIFIC, LLC filed a Cross-Complaint against SAADIA SQUARE, LLC, alleging Tortuous Interference with Contract and seeking Declaratory Relief. SAADIA SQUARE, LLC filed an anti-SLAPP Motion against the Cross-Complaint, claiming that the conduct within the Cross-Complaint is protected by the litigation privilege. Consequently, discovery for this entire action is stayed pursuant to CCP §425.16(g). SM Defendants moved for an order lifting the stay on discovery on the causes of action asserted in Plaintiff Saadia’s Second Amended Complaint, but the motion was denied. The court cannot allow discovery to go forward in connection with the Second Amended Complaint without prejudice to Saadia.
