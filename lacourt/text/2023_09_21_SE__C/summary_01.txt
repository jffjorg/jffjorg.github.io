And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the Defendants' Motion to Lift the Discovery Stay is denied. The Judge grants the Defendants' Joinder to the Motion to Lift Discovery Stay. The Judge also denies the Defendants' request to specially set their Motion for Determination of Privilege and Motion to Compel Testimony for hearing on September 22, 2023.

The case involves a dispute between Saadia Square, LLC (the plaintiff) and several All-Ways entities (the defendants) over a property in Rialto, California. The defendants are seeking to lift the discovery stay that was imposed in connection with Saadia's anti-SLAPP Motion. The Judge finds that the defendants have not demonstrated good cause to lift the discovery stay and that allowing discovery to go forward in connection with Saadia's Second Amended Complaint would be unfair to Saadia.
