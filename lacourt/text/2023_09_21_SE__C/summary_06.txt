**English Summary:**

The Judge has denied Nissan's motion to compel arbitration in this case. The Judge found that Plaintiff's claims, related to a defective 2023 Nissan Rogue, stem from Nissan's statutory obligations under the Song-Beverly Act, not from the sales contract itself.  

The Judge also rejected Nissan's argument that the arbitration agreement in the Retail Installment Sales Contract (RISC) extends to the manufacturer as a third-party beneficiary. The Judge cited a recent case, "Ford Motor Warranty Cases," which reached a similar conclusion, emphasizing that the arbitration clause in the RISC primarily aimed to cover transactions with third parties, such as financing or extended warranties, not manufacturer warranties.

## Case Summary: AGRAWAL v. NISSAN NORTH AMERICA, INC. (23NWCV00460)

**Case Number:** 23NWCV00460
**Hearing Date:** September 21, 2023
**Dept:** C

**Parties:**
* **Plaintiff:** AGRAWAL
* **Defendant:** NISSAN NORTH AMERICA, INC.

**Background:**

This case stems from Plaintiff AGRAWAL's purchase of a 2023 Nissan Rogue vehicle. AGRAWAL alleges the vehicle was defective and repair attempts failed to resolve the issues. AGRAWAL  filed a complaint against NISSAN under the Song-Beverly Act.

**Issues:**

* **Arbitration:** NISSAN seeks to compel arbitration based on an arbitration agreement in the Retail Installment Sales Contract (RISC) signed by AGRAWAL and the dealership. 

**Arguments:**
* **NISSAN:**  
    *  A valid arbitration agreement exists in the RISC, covering the dispute.
    *  NISSAN can enforce the agreement as a third-party beneficiary.
* **AGRAWAL:**
    *  AGRAWAL's claims arise from NISSAN's statutory obligations under the Song-Beverly Act, not the RISC. 
    *  The RISC does not intend to include NISSAN as a third-party beneficiary.

**Judge's Reasoning:**

* The judge acknowledges the existence of a valid arbitration agreement in the RISC.
* However, the judge finds that AGRAWAL's claims are based on NISSAN's statutory obligations and not on any express contractual language within the RISC. 
* The judge cites the case of *Ford Motor Warranty Cases* which held that similar arbitration clauses did not include manufacturers as intended beneficiaries.

**Decision:**

The judge DENIES NISSAN's motion to compel arbitration and stay proceedings.



**Significant Statements:**

* "Plaintiff’s claims are not intimately found in or intertwined with the RISC."
* "The RISC does not reveal a motivating purpose to include Defendant as a third-party beneficiary."

Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in Markdown format:

**Case Information**

* Case Number: 23NWCV00460
* Hearing Date: September 21, 2023
* Department: C

**Parties**

* Plaintiff: [Name]
* Defendant: Nissan North America, Inc. (Nissan)

**Background**

* The case arises from a dispute over a defective vehicle purchased by the Plaintiff, a 2023 Nissan Rogue.
* The Plaintiff filed a complaint against Nissan alleging violations of the Song-Beverly Act.
* Nissan seeks to compel arbitration under the Retail Installment Sales Contract (RISC) and its accompanying arbitration agreement.

**Ruling**

* The court denies Nissan's motion to compel arbitration and stay proceedings.
* The court finds that the arbitration agreement in the RISC is valid and covers the controversy between the parties.
* However, the court holds that Plaintiff's claims do not arise from and are not intimately founded in and intertwined with the sales contract.
* The court further holds that Defendant Nissan cannot enforce the arbitration agreement as a third-party beneficiary because there is no motivating purpose between the parties to provide a benefit to Nissan.

**Key Points**

* The court must find that there is a valid agreement to arbitrate and that the agreement covers the controversy or controversies in the parties' dispute.
* The party moving to compel arbitration has the burden of establishing the existence of a valid agreement to arbitrate.
* The court cannot compel arbitration if the claims do not arise from and are not intimately founded in and intertwined with the sales contract.
* A nonsignatory manufacturer can compel arbitration under equitable estoppel if the causes of action against the nonsignatory are "intimately founded in and intertwined" with the underlying contract obligations.
* Equitable estoppel is inapplicable if the claims do not arise from and are not intimately founded in and intertwined with the sales contract.
* A third-party beneficiary is someone who may enforce a contract because the contract is made expressly for their benefit, and the parties to the contract must have intended the third party to benefit.

**Significant Statements**

* "The fundamental point is that a party is 'not entitled to make use of [a contract containing an arbitration clause] as long as it worked to [his or] her advantage, then attempt to avoid its application in defining the forum in which [his or] her dispute . . . should be resolved.'" (Felisilda v. FCA US LLC (2020) 53 Cal.App.5th 486, 496)
* "The sale contracts include no warranty, nor any assurance regarding the quality of the vehicle sold, nor any promise of repairs or other remedies in the event problems arise. To the contrary, the sale contracts disclaim any warranty on the part of the dealers, while acknowledging no effect on 'any warranties covering the vehicle that the vehicle manufacturer may provide.'" (Ford Motor Warranty Cases (2023) 89 Cal.App.5th 1324, 1335)

### English Summary
The judge has denied Nissan North America, Inc.'s motion to compel arbitration and stay proceedings in a case where the plaintiff, Agrawal, purchased a 2023 Nissan Rogue vehicle that was defective and could not be repaired. The defendant argued that the Retail Installment Sales Contract (RISC) contained an arbitration agreement that applied to the plaintiff's claims. However, the judge found that the plaintiff's claims arose from the defendant's statutory obligations under the Song-Beverly Act and not from the sales contract. The judge also determined that the defendant was not a third-party beneficiary of the RISC and therefore could not enforce the arbitration agreement. As a result, the motion to compel arbitration and stay proceedings was denied.

The summary displayed below was created by an LLM named:  "mixtral-8x7b-32768":
**Case Number:** 23NWCV00460
**Hearing Date:** September 21, 2023
**Parties:** AGRAWAL v. NISSAN NORTH AMERICA, INC.

- Nissan North America, Inc. (Defendant or Nissan) seeks to compel arbitration under the Retail Installment Sales Contract (RISC) and its accompanying arbitration agreement.
- Plaintiff, AGrawal, filed a complaint against Nissan alleging violations of the Song-Beverly Act related to a defective 2023 Nissan Rogue vehicle.

**Arbitration Agreement:**

- Defendant has proven the existence of a valid arbitration agreement.
- Plaintiff does not dispute the validity of the arbitration agreement.

**Equitable Estoppel:**

- A nonsignatory manufacturer can compel arbitration under equitable estoppel if the causes of action are "intimately founded in and intertwined" with the underlying contract obligations.
- The court in Felisilda held that the manufacturer could compel arbitration, but the Ford court disagreed.
- The Ford court held that plaintiffs' claims were not "intimately founded in and intertwined" with the sale contracts because the sale contracts do not intend to cover the manufacturer's warranties.
- Therefore, Defendant may only compel arbitration if Plaintiff's claims arise from and are intimately founded in and intertwined with the sales contract instead of under Song-Beverly.

**Nonsignatory to Sales Contract:**

- Defendant argues that it may enforce the Arbitration Agreement because it contemplates enforcement by and against nonsignatory third parties.
- However, Defendant is not a third-party beneficiary as contemplated by the RISC because there is no motivating purpose between Plaintiff and the Dealership to provide benefit for Defendant.

**Conclusion:**

- Defendant may not compel arbitration because Plaintiff's claims arise from Defendant's statutory obligation and are not based on any express contractual language.
- Defendant cannot enforce the Arbitration Agreement as a third-party beneficiary.
- The motion to compel arbitration and stay proceedings is DENIED.
