**English Summary:**

The Judge has denied Nissan's motion to compel arbitration in this case. The Judge found that Plaintiff's claims, related to a defective 2023 Nissan Rogue, stem from Nissan's statutory obligations under the Song-Beverly Act, not from the sales contract itself.  

The Judge also rejected Nissan's argument that the arbitration agreement in the Retail Installment Sales Contract (RISC) extends to the manufacturer as a third-party beneficiary. The Judge cited a recent case, "Ford Motor Warranty Cases," which reached a similar conclusion, emphasizing that the arbitration clause in the RISC primarily aimed to cover transactions with third parties, such as financing or extended warranties, not manufacturer warranties.

summary\_text:
"This summary is based on the tentative ruling of Judge C AGRAWAL in the case 23NWCV00460 between plaintiff AGRAWAL and defendant NISSAN NORTH AMERICA, INC. The plaintiff purchased a 2023 Nissan Rogue vehicle and alleges that it was defective. The plaintiff filed a complaint against the defendant in February 2023, alleging violations of the Song-Beverly Act. The defendant seeks to compel arbitration under the Retail Installment Sales Contract (RISC) and its accompanying arbitration agreement. The judge has ruled that the defendant has met its burden of proving a valid arbitration agreement, but the plaintiff has not disputed this. However, the defendant may only compel arbitration if the plaintiff's claims arise from and are intimately founded in and intertwined with the sales contracts. Since the plaintiff's claims arise from the defendant's statutory obligation and are not based on any express contractual language, the defendant may not compel arbitration. The defendant cannot enforce the arbitration agreement as a third-party beneficiary. The motion to compel arbitration and stay proceedings is denied."
