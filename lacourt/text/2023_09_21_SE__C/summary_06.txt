The Court issued a tentative ruling denying the Defendant's motion to compel arbitration and stay proceedings. The Defendant, Nissan North America, Inc., sought to compel arbitration under the Retail Installment Sales Contract (RISC) and its accompanying arbitration agreement. The Plaintiff, Agrawal, opposes arbitration, arguing that the claims arise from the manufacturer's statutory obligations and not from the sale contract. The Court found that the Defendant met its burden of proving a valid arbitration agreement, but the Plaintiff's claims do not arise from the sale contract. The Court also held that the Defendant is not a third-party beneficiary under the RISC, as there is no motivating purpose to include the manufacturer in the arbitration agreement. Therefore, the motion to compel arbitration and stay proceedings is denied.
