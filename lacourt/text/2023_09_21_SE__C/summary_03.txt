significant\_statements:
  - "The elements of a cause of action for intentional fraud are 1) misrepresentation (false representation, concealment, or nondisclosure); 2) knowledge of falsity (scienter); 3) intent to defraud or induce reliance; 4) justifiable reliance; and 5) damages."
  - "Fraudulent inducement is a viable tort claim under California law. ‘The elements of fraud are (a) a misrepresentation (false representation, concealment, or nondisclosure); (b) scienter or knowledge of its falsity; (c) intent to induce reliance; (d) justifiable reliance; and (e) resulting damage.’"

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the Defendant's Demurrer to Plaintiff’s First Amended Complaint is Overruled, and Defendant GENERAL MOTORS, LLC’s Motion to Strike Portions of Plaintiff’s First Amended Complaint is Denied. The ruling is based on the Judge's interpretation of California law regarding fraudulent inducement and the specific allegations made by the Plaintiff in their complaint. The Judge finds that the complaint sufficiently pleads malicious conduct by concealment, and that less specificity is required if it appears from the nature of allegations that defendant must necessarily possess full information, or if the facts lie more in the knowledge of opposing parties.
