Opposing Party to give notice.
 
This “lemon law” action was filed by Plaintiff FRANCISCO
MOLINA ARAUJO (“Plaintiff”) on September 20, 2022. Plaintiff alleges that GENERAL MOTORS, LLC.
(“Defendant” or “GM”) did not disclose and actively concealed defects involving
GM’s Transmission Defect affecting Plaintiff’s 2020 Chevrolet Silverado vehicle.
(See e.g., FAC ¶¶4, 10, 12, 13, 24, 25.) 
 
Plaintiff’s FAC asserts the following causes of action: (1) Violation of
Song-Beverly Act (Breach of Express Warranty; and (2) Violation of Song-Beverly
Act- Breach of Implied Warranty; (3) Violation of the Song-Beverly Act §1793.2;
and (4) Fraudulent Inducement – Concealment. 
 
Defendant generally demurs to the fourth cause of action. 
 
Fourth Cause of Action – Fraudulent Inducement (Concealment) 
 
The elements of a cause of
action for intentional fraud are 1) misrepresentation (false representation,
concealment, or nondisclosure); 2) knowledge of falsity (scienter); 3) intent
to defraud or induce reliance; 4) justifiable reliance; and 5) damages. (See
Cal. Civ. Code §1709.) “[T]he elements of a cause of action for fraud
and deceit based on concealment are: (1) the defendant must have concealed or
suppressed a material fact, (2) the defendant must have been under a duty to
disclose the fact to the plaintiff, (3) the defendant must have intentionally
concealed or suppressed the fact with the intent to defraud the plaintiff, (f)
the plaintiff must have been unaware of the fact and would not have acted as he
did if he had known of the concealed or suppressed fact, and (5) as a result of
the concealment or suppression of the fact, the plaintiff must have sustained
damage.” (Marketing West, Inc. v. Sanyo Fisher (USA) Corp. (1992) 6
Cal.App.4th 603, 612-613.) 
 

Fraudulent inducement is a viable tort claim under California
law. ‘The elements of fraud are (a) a misrepresentation (false representation,
concealment, or nondisclosure); (b) scienter or knowledge of its falsity; (c)
intent to induce reliance; (d) justifiable reliance; and (e) resulting damage. Fraud in the inducement is a
subset of the tort of fraud. It ‘occurs when ‘the
promisor knows what he is signing but his consent is induced by fraud, mutual
assent is present and a contract is formed, which, by reason of the fraud, is
voidable.’”  (Dhital v. Nissan North America, Inc. (2022) 84
Cal.App.5th 828, 838-839.)
 
Here, Plaintiff alleges at ¶¶ 35,
69-78 that Defendant concealed and failed to disclose facts relating to the
defects.  ¶¶122-123 alleges scienter and
intent to induce reliance based on concealment. 
¶141 alleges Plaintiff’s resulting damages.
 
The court finds that the FAC alleges sufficient prior knowledge at this
pleading stage. Less
specificity is required if it appears from the nature of allegations that
defendant must necessarily possess full information, or if the facts lie more
in the knowledge of opposing parties.  (Alfaro v. Community Housing Improvement System & Planning Assn.,
Inc. (2009) 171 Cal.App.4th 1356, 1384-1385.)
 
The Demurrer to the fourth cause of action is OVERRULED. 
 
Motion to Strike 
Defendant’s accompanying motion to
strike punitive damages is DENIED. The court
finds that the Complaint sufficiently pleads malicious conduct by
concealment.  Corporate ratification is
alleged at ¶16.  Less specificity is
required if it appears from the nature of allegations that defendant must
necessarily possess full information, or if the facts lie more in the knowledge
of opposing parties.  (Alfaro
v. Community Housing Improvement System & Planning Assn., Inc. (2009)
171 Cal.App.4th 1356, 1384-1385; Bushell v.
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (2013) 220 Cal.App.4th 915, 931
- “plaintiffs did not have to specify the … personnel who prepared these
documents because that information is uniquely within … [defendant’s]
knowledge”.)
