**English Summary:**

The judge is reviewing an expedited petition for a settlement in a case where Heidi Kralik (Claimant) alleges she had an allergic reaction to a sunflower butter sandwich served by the Glendora Unified School District. The petition outlines a $15,000 settlement, with $4,000 allocated for medical expenses.

The judge notes inconsistencies in the petition regarding who paid the medical expenses. While it states the expenses were paid by private insurance and no liens exist, it also says the petitioner (Kim Flum) paid the expenses and seeks reimbursement.

To approve the settlement, the court requires that all medical expenses be reimbursed. Therefore, the judge is denying the petition at this time and requesting the petitioner revise it to clarify these inconsistencies and ensure all liens are resolved before seeking court approval.
