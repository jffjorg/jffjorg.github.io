And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the motion to vacate the dismissal filed by Plaintiff Lukas O'Connor and has ruled as follows. The plaintiff filed this action against defendants Madeleine Klineman, Julia Hanna, and Does 1-100 for motor vehicle tort on October 26, 2021. The case was dismissed without prejudice on April 25, 2023, as no parties or counsel appeared for trial. The plaintiff subsequently filed a motion to set aside the dismissal, which was continued to September 28, 2023.

The plaintiff's counsel has submitted a declaration stating that the dismissal resulted from a mistake, inadvertence, and neglect by counsel, as the April 25, 2023 hearing date was not calendared correctly on counsel's calendar. The court has determined that the dismissal was caused by the counsel's error and has granted the motion.

The court vacates the dismissal and sets an Order to Show Cause: re: Trial Setting Conference for October 27, 2023, at 8:30 a.m., in Department 28 of the Spring Street Courthouse.
