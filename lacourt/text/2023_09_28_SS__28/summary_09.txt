The plaintiff subsequently filed a motion to set aside the dismissal, which was continued to September 28, 2023.

The court has determined that the dismissal was caused by the counsel's error and has granted the motion.

**English Summary:**

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Lukas O'Connor (Plaintiff) versus Madeleine Klineman, Julia Hanna, and Does 1-100 (Defendants). 

The case involved a motor vehicle tort lawsuit originally filed in 2021. In April 2023, the case was dismissed without prejudice because no one appeared for the scheduled hearing.  

O'Connor's attorney filed a motion to set aside the dismissal, stating the missed hearing was due to a calendar error. The judge has reviewed the motion and granted it, vacating the dismissal.  

A new hearing, an OSC: re: Trial Setting Conference, has been scheduled for October 27, 2023, to set a date for trial.
