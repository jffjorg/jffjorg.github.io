And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the moving and opposition papers and is issuing a tentative ruling. The case was filed on November 24, 2020, by plaintiff Daniel Garcia against defendants Ad Trucking, Jose Enrique Romero Fierra (Doe 1), and Jean Mariana Lopez (Doe 2) for motor vehicle tort and general negligence. The court has considered the parties' requests and the legal standard.

The plaintiff is requesting that the court grant judgment on the pleadings, while Ad Trucking is requesting that the court deny the motion. The court has reviewed the pleadings and determined that the plaintiff's complaint alleges that Ad Trucking negligently owned, operated, maintained, and entrusted a vehicle, causing the plaintiff to suffer injuries and damages.

Ad Trucking's answer denies all of the plaintiff's allegations and asserts affirmative defenses, including comparative negligence, failure to state a cause of action, apportionment, and failure to mitigate damages. The court has denied the plaintiff's request for judicial notice of the requests for admission and Ad Trucking's responses.

The court has determined that the plaintiff has not identified any defects in Ad Trucking's answer that prevent it from stating facts sufficient to constitute a defense to the complaint. Even if the court granted the plaintiff's request to take judicial notice of the requests for admission and Ad Trucking's responses, Ad Trucking's discovery admissions would not prevent the answer from stating facts sufficient to constitute a defense to the complaint.

Accordingly, the court denies the plaintiff's motion for judgment on the pleadings. The moving party is ordered to give notice of this ruling and to file proof of service with the court within five days.
