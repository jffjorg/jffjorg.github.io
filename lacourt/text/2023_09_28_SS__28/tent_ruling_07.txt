PARTIES’ REQUESTS 
 Harrison requests that the

LEGAL STANDARD 
          A.   Inspection
  demand 
       “Within 30 days after service of a
  demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling, the party to whom the
  demand is directed shall serve the original of the response to it on the
  party making the demand, and a copy of the response on all other parties who
  have appeared in the action, unless on motion of the party making the demand,
  the court has shortened the time for response, or unless on motion of the
  party to whom the demand has been directed, the court has extended the time
  for response.”  (Code Civ. Proc., §
  2031.260, subd. (a).)  
 “If
  a party to whom a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is
  directed fails to serve a timely response to it, the following rules shall
  apply: 
 “(a)
  The party to whom the demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is
  directed waives any objection to the demand, including one based on privilege
  or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4 (commencing with
  Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that party from this
  waiver on its determination that both of the following conditions are
  satisfied: 
 “(1)
  The party has subsequently served a response that is in substantial
  compliance with Sections 2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230, 2031.240, and
  2031.280. 
 “(2)
  The party’s failure to serve a timely response was the result of mistake,
  inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
 “(b)
  The party making the demand may move for an order compelling response to the
  demand. 
 “(c)
  Except as provided in subdivision (d), the court shall impose a monetary
  sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any
  party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to
  compel a response to a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling,
  unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial
  justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction
  unjust. If a party then fails to obey the order compelling a response, the
  court may make those orders that are just, including the imposition of an
  issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction under Chapter
  7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in addition to this
  sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing
  with Section 2023.010). 
 “(d)
  (1) Notwithstanding subdivision (c), absent exceptional circumstances, the
  court shall not impose sanctions on a party or any attorney of a party for
  failure to provide electronically stored information that has been lost, damaged,
  altered, or overwritten as a result of the routine, good faith operation of
  an electronic information system. 
 “(2)
  This subdivision shall not be construed to alter any obligation to preserve
  discoverable information.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300.) 
          B.  
  Interrogatories 
 “Within 30 days after
  service of interrogatories, the party to whom the interrogatories are
  propounded shall serve the original of the response to them on the
  propounding party, unless on motion of the propounding party the court has
  shortened the time for response, or unless on motion of the responding party
  the court has extended the time for response.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260.)  
 “If
  a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to serve a timely
  response, the following rules apply: 
 “(a)
  The party to whom the interrogatories are directed waives any right to
  exercise the option to produce writings under Section 2030.230, as well as
  any objection to the interrogatories, including one based on privilege or on
  the protection for work product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section
  2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that party from this waiver on
  its determination that both of the following conditions are satisfied: 
 “(1)
  The party has subsequently served a response that is in substantial
  compliance with Sections 2030.210, 2030.220, 2030.230, and 2030.240. 
 “(2)
  The party’s failure to serve a timely response was the result of mistake,
  inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
 “(b)
  The party propounding the interrogatories may move for an order compelling
  response to the interrogatories. 
 “(c)
  The court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
  Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully
  makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to interrogatories, unless it
  finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial
  justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction
  unjust. If a party then fails to obey an order compelling answers, the court
  may make those orders that are just, including the imposition of an issue
  sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction under Chapter 7
  (commencing with Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in addition to that
  sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
  (commencing with Section 2023.010).” 
(Code Civ. Proc., §
  2030.290.) 
          C.   Discovery
  sanctions 
          “The court may impose a monetary sanction ordering that
  one engaging in the misuse of the discovery process, or any attorney advising
  that conduct, or both pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees,
  incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct. The court may also impose
  this sanction on one unsuccessfully asserting that another has engaged in the
  misuse of the discovery process, or on any attorney who advised that
  assertion, or on both. If a monetary sanction is authorized by any provision
  of this title, the court shall impose that sanction unless it finds that the
  one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that
  other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (a).) 
 “Misuses of the discovery
  process include, but are not limited to . . . 
 *
  * *
 “(d) Failing to respond or
  to submit to an authorized method of discovery.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., §
  2023.010, subd. (d).) 
DISCUSSION 
 
Top

Bottom
  of Form



  On July 11, 2023, Harrison served a request for production of documents, set two, and special interrogatories,
set two, on Bestway.  Responses were due August 15, 2023.  Bestway did not serve
responses by August 15, 2023.  Harrison did
not receive responses prior to filing these motions on August 31, 2023. 
 In its opposition to the
motions, Bestway states it did not provide timely responses due to a “snafu in
the defense office.”  Bestway also argues
that Harrison did not give Bestway time to provide late responses, and did not
make a reasonable and good faith effort to meet and confer, before filing these
motions.  Bestway argues: “On August 17, 2023, [Harrison's] counsel sent a meet
& confer email to the defense counsel requesting an update as to when [Harrison] should expect to receive [Bestway's] verified responses to the
subject discovery. Before [Bestway's] counsel could respond, [Harrison] filed a Motion to Compel responses requesting sanctions of $460.00 for the
motion to compel production of documents, and $860.00 for the motion to compel
responses to special interrogatories.” 
          Bestway does not explain why its counsel could not respond
to Harrison’s counsel’s meet and confer email between August 17, 2023 and
August 31, 2023, when Harrison filed these motions.  The Court finds that Harrison acted
appropriately in attempting to meet and confer and, when two weeks went by
without a response, filing these motions.[1]
           Bestway served responses to Harrison's discovery, without objections,
on September 13, 2023.  Therefore, the
discovery issues are moot.  Nonetheless,
Harrison is entitled to sanctions because Bestway’s misuse of the discovery
process required Harrison to file these motions. 
 For the motion to compel responses
to the request for production, Harrison requests $460 based on (1) a $60 filing fee, (2) at least one-half
hour of attorney time preparing the moving papers, and (3) one-half hour of attorney time preparing
a reply brief and appearing for the hearing. 
Counsel’s billing rate is $400 per hour. 
The Court grants sanctions of $260 for this motion based on one hour of
attorney time at a reasonable rate of $200 per hour plus one filing fee. 
 For the motion to compel
responses to special interrogatories, Harrison requests $860 in sanctions based
on (1) a $60.00 filing fee, (2) at least one hour of attorney time preparing
the moving papers, and (3) one hour of attorney time preparing a reply brief and
appearing for the hearing.  Counsel’s
billing rate is $400 per hour.  The Court
grants sanctions of $260 for this motion based on one hour of attorney time at
a reasonable rate of $200 per hour plus one filing fee. 
CONCLUSION 
 The Court DENIES
AS MOOT Plaintiff Judith Harrison’s motion to compel responses to the request
for production of documents. 

 The Court DENIES AS MOOT Plaintiff Judith Harrison’s
motion to compel responses to the special interrogatories. 

 The
Court GRANTS Plaintiff Judith Harrison’s requests for sanctions on her motions
to compel discovery responses.  Defendants
Bestway Sandwiches, Inc. and its counsel are ordered to pay Plaintiff Judith
Harrison $520 in sanctions by October 30, 2023. 
 Moving party is ordered to
give notice of this ruling. 
 Moving party is ordered to
file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court within five days.

was not, however, required to meet and confer with Bestway before filing the
motions.  (See L. Edmon & C. Karnow,
