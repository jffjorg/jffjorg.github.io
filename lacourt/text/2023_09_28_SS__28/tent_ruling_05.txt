 Case Number:  21STCV10874    Hearing Date:   September 28, 2023    Dept:  28 Claimant
Heidi Kralik (“Claimant”) had an allergic reaction to a sunflower butter
sandwich served by Defendant Glendora Unified School District, which allegedly
was aware of Claimant’s allergy. 
This
is an expedited petition without a hearing, which is permitted under California
Rules of Court, rule 7.950.5, as long as Petitioner Kim Flum (“Petitioner”)
uses the required Judicial Council forms and meets certain conditions. The
conditions are: 
1. Petitioner is represented
by an attorney.
2. The claim is not for
wrongful death.
3. Settlement proceeds will
not be placed in a trust.
4. There are no unresolved
liens
5. Petitioner’s attorney did
not become involved at the request of Defendant or the insurance carrier.
6. Petitioner’s attorney is not
employed by or associated with a Defendant or insurance carrier in connection
with the petition.
7. If an action is filed, all
Defendants have appeared and are participating in the compromise OR the court
has determined that the settlement is in good faith.
8. The settlement, exclusive
of interests and costs, is $50,000 or less OR if greater than $50,000, the
amount payable is the insurance policy limits AND all proposed contributing
parties would be substantially unable to use assets other than the insurance
policy limits AND the court does not otherwise order. 
SETTLEMENT:
$15,000.00 
INJURIES:
Anaphylaxis, vomiting and extreme allergic reaction 
MEDICAL
EXPENSES: $4,000.00 
COSTS:
$435.00 
ATTORNEY’S
FEES: $3,750.00, which is 25% of the gross settlement 
BALANCE
OF PROCEEDS: $6,815.00 
DISCUSSION: 
Section
13a of the petition states that total medical expenses of $4,000 have been
paid.  Sections 13b and 13c state that
neither Medi-Cal nor Medicare paid the medical expenses.  Taking into account Sections 13b and 13c, Section
13g appears to state that the medical expenses were paid by private insurance. 
Section
13f states that “[t]here are no statutory or contractual liens for payment of
the claimant’s medical expenses.”  Section
13d appears to state that Claimant’s health plan is not requesting
reimbursement. 
Section
15b(1), however, states that Petitioner paid the $4,000 in medical expenses (and
attorney’s fees and costs) and is seeking reimbursement.  Section 17b states that $4,000 of the
settlement proceeds will be used to pay the $4,000 in medical expenses. 
The
Court cannot approve a minor’s compromise unless it reimburses all medical
expenses that have not been reduced or waived. 
Petitioner should revise the petition to address the discrepancies noted
above and to make sure that all liens are resolved prior to seeking Court
approval. 
For
the reasons stated above, the Court denies the petition.
