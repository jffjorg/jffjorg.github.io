And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the documents submitted in support of a default judgment and ruled as follows. The plaintiff, Lucita de Leon Bayle, is seeking a default judgment against the defendant, Vermont Healthcare Center, Inc., for elder abuse, negligence, violation of residents' rights, and wrongful death. The plaintiff has submitted a declaration stating that she has suffered damages in the amount of $1,500,000.00 as a result of the defendant's conduct. However, the judge has denied the request for default judgment because the plaintiff has not provided sufficient evidence to establish a prima facie case for damages. The judge has also denied the plaintiff's request for costs, except for $56.60 for "mail; case documents," which the plaintiff should modify or clarify. The case will be heard on September 28, 2023.
