## English Summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the Plaintiff's request for default judgment against Vermont Healthcare Center, Inc.  The Plaintiff sued the Defendant for elder abuse and wrongful death. Though the Defendant defaulted on the case, the Judge found insufficient evidence to support all requested damages.  

Specifically, the judge ruled that the Plaintiff cannot seek general damages for the pain and suffering of her family members. Additionally, the Plaintiff's request for costs needs to be clarified as postage and photocopying are not allowable as costs. The case will proceed, and the Plaintiff can re-submit her request for default judgment with the necessary revisions.

The court has ordered a new default to be entered against the defendant.

The plaintiff has requested damages in the amount of $1,500,950.18, including $1,500,000.00 in general damages, $0.00 in special damages, $0.00 in prejudgment interest, $0.00 in attorney's fees, and $950.18 in costs. However, the court has denied the request for default judgment, stating that the relief granted to a plaintiff upon entry of a defendant's default cannot exceed the amount demanded in the complaint or the amount listed in the statement of damages.

The judge has also noted that the plaintiff's request for costs includes postage and photocopying charges, which are not allowable as costs. The court has given the plaintiff an opportunity to modify or clarify the cost request.

The hearing on the request for default judgment is set for September 28, 2023.
