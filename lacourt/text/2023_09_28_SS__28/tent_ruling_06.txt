On

On

PARTY’S REQUEST 
Plaintiff
requests that the Court enter default judgment against Defendant Vermont
Healthcare Center, Inc. and award Plaintiff $1,500,950.18, consisting of
$1,500,000.00 in general damages, $0.00 in special damages, $0.00 in
prejudgment interest, $0.00 in attorney’s fees, and $950.18 in costs. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
A.      Default judgment 
“[With exceptions that do not apply here,] [a] party
seeking a default judgment on declarations must use mandatory Request for Entry
of Default (Application to Enter Default) (form CIV-100) . . . The following
must be included in the documents filed with the clerk: 
“(1)  Except in
unlawful detainer cases, a brief summary of the case identifying the parties
and the nature of plaintiff's claim; 
“(2)  Declarations
or other admissible evidence in support of the judgment requested; 
“(3)  Interest
computations as necessary; 
“(4)  A
memorandum of costs and disbursements; 
“(5)  A
declaration of nonmilitary status for each defendant against whom judgment is
sought; 
“(6)  A proposed
form of judgment; 
“(7)  A
dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application
for separate judgment against specified parties under Code of Civil Procedure
section 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment; 
“(8)  Exhibits
as necessary; and 
“(9)  A request
for attorney fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.” 
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1800(a).) 
B.       Damages 
          On a request for default judgment, “[w]here a cause of
action is stated in the complaint, plaintiff merely needs to introduce evidence
establishing a prima facie case for damages.” 
(L. Edmon & C. Karnow, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before
Trial (Rutter 2023) ¶ 5:213.1, p. 5-56 (Cal. Practice Guide: Procedure), citing
Johnson v. Stanhiser (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 357, 361 [trial court erred
in applying preponderance of the evidence standard].) 
          The relief granted to a plaintiff upon entry of a
defendant's default cannot exceed the amount demanded in the complaint or, for
personal injury cases where damages may not be stated in the complaint, the
amount listed in the statement of damages. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 580, subd. (a),
585, subd. (b).) “The notice requirement of section 580 was designed to insure fundamental
fairness.” (Becker v. S.P.V. Construction Co. (1980) 27 Cal.3d 489, 494
(Becker).) The statute insures that “defendants in cases which involve a
default judgment have adequate notice of the judgments that may be taken
against them. [Citation.] ‘If a judgment other than that which is demanded is
taken against him, [the defendant] has been deprived of his day in court—a
right to a hearing on the matter adjudicated.’ ’’ (Id. at p. 493.) A
trial court exceeds its jurisdiction if it awards damages in excess of the
amount specified in the complaint or statement of damages. (Id. at p.
494; see Cal. Practice Guide: Procedure, supra, ¶ 5:258, p. 5-70.)  
DISCUSSION 
Plaintiff
submitted a request for default and default judgment to the clerk’s office on
August 9, 2023.  The clerk mistakenly
denied the request for default, citing the default entered on July 19, 2022.  As noted above, on June 1, 2023, the Court vacated the July
19, 2022 default.  Plaintiff has now
filed proof of service on Defendant of a statement of damages.  Therefore, the Court orders that a new
default is entered against Defendant. 
With
respect to Plaintiff’s request for default judgment, Plaintiff has submitted a
declaration stating: “As a result of [Defendant’s] conduct, my family and I
have been deprived of the love, affection, care, society, service, comfort,
support, right to support, companionship, solace or moral support, or
expectations of future support and counseling, as well as other benefits and
assistance of my father and have suffered damages from my father's wrongful
death in the amount of $1,500,000.00.” (Declaration of Lucita
De Leon Bayle ¶ 15.)  Plaintiff may
request general damages to compensate her for her own
pain, suffering, and loss of society and companionship.  However, Plaintiff may not request general
damages based on the pain, suffering, and loss of society and companionship experienced
by her family members. 
Plaintiff
requests $56.60 in costs for “mail; case documents.”  Postage and photocopying charges are not
allowable as costs.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
1033.5, subd. (b)(3).)  Plaintiff should modify
or clarify this portion of the cost request. 
For
the reasons stated above, the Court denies the request for default judgment. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court DENIES Plaintiff Lucita De Leon Bayle’s application for default judgment
filed on August 9, 2023, without prejudice. 
Plaintiff
is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
