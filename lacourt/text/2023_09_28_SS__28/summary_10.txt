The Judge's tentative ruling is a summary of the Court's decision regarding a motion to compel production of documents and supplemental testimony of third-party Harlee Dickerson. The motion was filed by the Defendant, Kobi Vaknin, and opposes the Plaintiff, Amanda Worley. The Judge has considered the moving, opposing, reply, and supplemental papers and has ruled as follows.

The Court denies the motion to compel without prejudice, giving the parties an opportunity to work together to follow up on Dickerson's agreement to search for responsive documents and schedule a second deposition. The Court also grants the Plaintiff's request for sanctions against the Defendant and his counsel, ordering them to pay $400 in sanctions.

The ruling is based on the facts that Dickerson did not produce documents in response to the deposition subpoena, and that the Defendant's motion is premature. The Court also concludes that the Defendant did not have substantial justification for filing the motion and that no other circumstances make the imposition of sanctions unjust.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the motions, oppositions, and replies filed in this case and has decided to deny the defendant's motion to compel production of documents and supplemental testimony from third-party Harlee Dickerson without prejudice. The judge has also granted the plaintiff's request for sanctions against the defendant and his counsel for misuse of the discovery process. The judge has ordered the defendant to pay the plaintiff $400 in sanctions by October 27, 2023.

The judge's decision is based on the facts that Dickerson appeared for deposition on May 30, 2023, but did not produce documents in response to the deposition subpoena. Dickerson claimed that she had not checked her iCloud or Instagram for responsive documents and had replaced a phone that may have contained responsive materials. Dickerson also refused to provide copies of email correspondence with the plaintiff's counsel.

The judge has also determined that the defendant's motion to compel is premature and that the parties should work together to follow up on Dickerson's agreement to search for responsive documents and to schedule a second session of Dickerson's deposition. The judge has also rejected the defendant's argument that an attorney-client relationship did not exist between Dickerson and the plaintiff's counsel and has granted the plaintiff's request for sanctions.
