And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is a summary of the Court's decision regarding a motion to compel production of documents and supplemental testimony of third-party Harlee Dickerson. The motion was filed by the Defendant, Kobi Vaknin, and opposes the Plaintiff, Amanda Worley. The Judge has considered the moving, opposing, reply, and supplemental papers and has ruled as follows.

The Court denies the motion to compel without prejudice, giving the parties an opportunity to work together to follow up on Dickerson's agreement to search for responsive documents and schedule a second deposition. The Court also grants the Plaintiff's request for sanctions against the Defendant and his counsel, ordering them to pay $400 in sanctions.

The ruling is based on the facts that Dickerson did not produce documents in response to the deposition subpoena, and that the Defendant's motion is premature. The Court also concludes that the Defendant did not have substantial justification for filing the motion and that no other circumstances make the imposition of sanctions unjust.
