 Case Number:  21STCV38920    Hearing Date:   September 28, 2023    Dept:  28 


Having considered the moving papers, the Court rules
  as follows. 
\BACKGROUND 
On October 21, 2021, Plaintiffs Carlos Galvez and
  Guadalupe Lopez (“Plaintiffs”) filed this action against Defendants Luis
  Enrique Ordaz, Martin Olvera, Sofia Olvera, Erika Munoz Conde, and Does 1-50
  for negligence. 
On March 8, 2023, Defendants Martin Olvera and Sofia
  Olvera filed answers. 
On March 28, 2023, Defendants Luis Enrique Ordaz and
  Erika Munoz Conde filed an answer and a cross-complaint against Cross-Defendants
  Carlos Galvez and Roes 1-20 for indemnity and contribution. 
On July 13, 2023, Plaintiffs’ counsel filed motions
  to be relieved as counsel to be heard on August 15, 2023. The Court continued
  the hearing on the motions to September 28, 2023.  No opposition has been filed. 
Trial is currently scheduled for October 20, 2023. 
COUNSEL’S REQUESTS 
Plaintiffs’ counsel, Carlos A. Gomez, asks to be
  relieved as counsel for Plaintiffs. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362 (Motion to Be
  Relieved as Counsel) requires (1) notice of motion and motion to be directed
  to the client (made on the Notice of Motion and Motion to be Relieved as Counsel—Civil
  form (MC-051)); (2) a declaration stating in general terms and without compromising
  the confidentiality of the attorney-client relationship why a motion under
  Code of Civil Procedure section 284(2) is brought instead of filing a consent
  under Code of Civil Procedure section 284(1) (made on the Declaration in
  Support of Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-052)); (3)
  service of the notice of motion and motion, declaration, and proposed order
  on the client and all other parties who have appeared in the case; and (4)
  the proposed order relieving counsel (prepared on the Order Granting
  Attorney’s Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-053)). 
The court has discretion to allow an attorney to
  withdraw.  The motion should be granted
  if there is no prejudice to the client and it does not disrupt the orderly process
  of justice. (Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915.) 
DISCUSSION 
Plaintiffs’ counsel has not served all of the parties
  who have appeared in this action. Counsel served Plaintiffs and Defendants
  Luis Enrique Ordaz and Erika Munoz Conde. Counsel did not serve Defendants Martin
  Olvera and Sofia Olvera. 
In addition, although Plaintiffs’ complaint listed
  one of the plaintiffs as Guadalupe Lopez, counsel’s motion papers refer to Guadalupe
  Lopes.  Counsel should explain the
  discrepancy or submit a motion to be relieved that uses the name provided in the complaint. 
For the reasons stated above, the Court denies the
  motion. 
CONCLUSION 
The Court DENIES Plaintiffs’ counsel's motions to be
  relieved as counsel. 
Counsel is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Counsel is ordered to file the proof of service of
  this ruling with the Court within five days.
