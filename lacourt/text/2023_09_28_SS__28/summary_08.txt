And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling addresses a motion by Plaintiffs' counsel, Carlos A. Gomez, to be relieved as counsel for the Plaintiffs, Carlos Galvez and Guadalupe Lopez. The motion was filed on July 13, 2023, and was continued to September 28, 2023. The Judge denies the motion due to several reasons, including the fact that counsel did not serve all parties who have appeared in the action, and the discrepancy between the name of one of the plaintiffs in the complaint and the motion papers. The Judge states that counsel should explain the discrepancy or submit a motion to be relieved that uses the name provided in the complaint.
