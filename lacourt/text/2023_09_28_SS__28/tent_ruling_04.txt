 Case Number:  21STCV06066    Hearing Date:   September 28, 2023    Dept:  28 Having
considered the moving papers, the Court rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On February 16, 2021, Plaintiff D’cameron Granger
(“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Defendants Alex Emmanuel Azor and Does
1-10 for negligence. 
On August
2, 2021, Plaintiff amended the complaint to include Defendant Lyft Inc. as Doe
1. 
On
June 30, 2022, Defendant Lyft, Inc. filed an answer. 
On May 16, 2023, Plaintiff amended the complaint to
include Defendant Hertz Vehicles LLC as Doe 2 (“Hertz”).  On August 31, 2023, Hertz filed an answer. 
On
August 31, 2023, Hertz filed a motion to continue the trial and all trial-related dates, to be heard on September 28, 2023.  No
opposition has been filed. 
Trial
is currently scheduled for November 9, 2023. 
PARTY’S REQUEST 
Hertz
requests that the Court continue the trial to October 2024. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(b), provides that “a party seeking a continuance of
the date set for trial, whether contested or uncontested or stipulated to by
the parties, must make the request for a continuance by a noticed motion or an
ex parte application under the rules in chapter 4 of this division, with
supporting declarations. The party must make the motion or application as soon
as reasonably practical once the necessity for the continuance is discovered.” 
          Under
California Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(c), the Court may grant a continuance
only on an affirmative showing of good cause requiring the continuance.
Circumstances that may indicate good cause include “a party's excused inability
to obtain essential testimony, documents, or other material evidence despite
diligent efforts,” or the unavailability of a party, counsel, or expert due to
death, illness or other excusable circumstance. The Court should consider all
facts and circumstances relevant to the determination, such as proximity of the
trial date, prior continuances, prejudice suffered, whether all parties have
stipulated to a continuance, and whether the interests of justice are served.
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(d).) 
DISCUSSION 
Hertz
requests that the Court continue the trial and related trial dates to give
Hertz time to conduct discovery.  Although
Plaintiff filed the complaint on February
16, 2021, Plaintiff did not amend the complaint to name Hertz as a defendant
until May 16, 2023. 
Based
on this delay, Hertz moved to dismiss.  On
August 8, 2023, the Court denied Hertz’s motion, noting that Hertz could seek
appropriate continuances to ensure it could prepare its defense. 
Plaintiff
brought Hertz into the case with just a few months to conduct discovery before
the scheduled trial date.  The Court
finds good cause to continue the trial and related dates. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court GRANTS Defendant Hertz Vehicles LLC’s motion to continue the trial and
related dates.  Trial is continued to
October 10, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. in Department 28 of the Spring Street
Courthouse.  The Final Status Conference
is September 26, 2024, at 10:00 a.m. in Department 28 of the Spring Street
Courthouse.  All dates and deadlines are
set to trail the new trial date. 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Moving
party is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court
within five days.
