Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied the Plaintiff's application for default judgment against the Defendant, Shawn Williams. The Plaintiff, Allstate Property and Casualty Insurance Company, seeks damages of $114,822.20, including $114,272.20 in compensatory damages, $0.00 in prejudgment interest, $0.00 in attorney's fees, and $550.00 in costs. The Judge has denied the motion because the Plaintiff failed to provide sufficient evidence to support its claim, including information about the payments made and the connection between the payments and the Defendant's tortious conduct. The Judge has also noted that the Plaintiff's declaration was incomplete and did not include a police report or a detailed explanation of the payments made.
