Summary:
The judge's tentative ruling denies as moot the plaintiff's motion to compel responses to the request for production of documents and the motion to compel responses to special interrogatories. The court grants the plaintiff's request for sanctions against the defendant and its counsel, ordering them to pay $520 in sanctions by October 30, 2023. The court finds that the defendant's failure to serve timely responses to discovery requests was a misuse of the discovery process, and that the plaintiff acted appropriately in attempting to meet and confer before filing the motions.
