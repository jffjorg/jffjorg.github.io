```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled on a motion to compel discovery responses and request sanctions filed by the plaintiff, Judith Harrison, against the defendant, Bestway Sandwiches, Inc. The plaintiff had requested the defendant to produce documents and answer special interrogatories, but the defendant failed to do so within the prescribed timeframe. The plaintiff then filed motions to compel discovery responses and request sanctions. The defendant argued that its failure to serve responses was due to a "snafu" in its defense office and that the plaintiff did not make a reasonable and good faith effort to meet and confer before filing the motions.

The court has granted the plaintiff's request for sanctions, ordering the defendant to pay $520 in sanctions by October 30, 2023. However, the court has denied the plaintiff's motions to compel discovery responses as moot, as the defendant has since served responses to the plaintiff's discovery requests. The court has also denied the defendant's request to deny the motions and request sanctions.
