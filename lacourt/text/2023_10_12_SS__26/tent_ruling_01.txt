On August 30, 2021, Plaintiff Lauren Michelle Chase (“Plaintiff”)
filed the instant action against Defendant Bryan Kennedy Seals (“Defendant”).
Plaintiff filed proof of substitute service of the Summons and Complaint on September

obtained their default on November 4, 2021 and default judgment on February 7,
2022.

Quash Service of Summons and Vacate Void Default Judgment. Plaintiff filed an
opposition on September 29, 2023 and Defendant replied on October 4, 2023.

Defendant moves to quash service of the
Summons  and Complaint pursuant to Code
of Civil Procedure section 418.10. Defendant moves to vacate the entry
of default pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b),
section 473.5, or Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (d). 
 
Under Code of Civil
Procedure section 473, subdivision (b), an application for relief must be made
no more than six months after entry of the order from which relief is sought,
and must be accompanied by an affidavit of fault attesting to the mistake, inadvertence,
surprise or neglect of the moving party or its attorney. (Code Civ. Proc., §
473, subd. (b); English v. IKON Business Solutions (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th
130, 143.) The motion must also be accompanied by a copy of the moving
defendant’s proposed pleading. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b).) This can be
corrected if Defendant submits a proposed responsive pleading by the hearing
date. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b); Carmel, Ltd. v. Tavoussi
(2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 393, 403.) 
 
The instant Motion was not timely filed within six months of
the February 17, 2022 default judgment. The six-month deadline is
jurisdictional and not subject to tolling. (Manson, Iver & York v. Black
(2009) 176 Cal.App.4th 36, 42.) Therefore, Defendant cannot obtain relief under
Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b). 
 
The Motion is also brought under Code of Civil Procedure
section 473.5, subdivision (a): 
 
When service of a summons has not resulted
in actual notice to a party in time to defend the action and a default or
default judgment has been entered against him or
her in the action, he or she may serve and file a
notice of motion to set aside the default or default judgment and for
leave to defend the action.  The notice of
motion shall be served and filed within a reasonable time, but in no event
exceeding the earlier of: (i) two years after entry of a default judgment
against him or her; or (ii) 180 days after service on him or
her of a written notice that the default or default judgment has
been entered.
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 473.5, subd. (a).)
Additionally, the motion “shall be accompanied by an affidavit showing under
oath that the party's lack of actual notice in time to defend the action was
not caused by his or her avoidance of service or inexcusable neglect. The party
shall serve and file with the notice a copy of the answer, motion, or other
pleading proposed to be filed in the action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 473.5, subd.
(b).) 
 
Plaintiff’s opposition incorrectly contends that
the Motion is not timely under this statute. However, Defendant’s Motion is not
subject to the 180-day deadline because no notice of entry of judgment was
served and the Motion was brought within two years of February 17, 2022.
Defendant declares he lacked actual notice of this action until service of the Application
and Order for Appearance and Examination scheduled for July 19, 2023. (Motion,
Seals Decl., ¶¶6-8.) However, the declaration does not state that
Defendant’s lack of actual notice was not caused by avoidance of service or
inexcusable neglect. (Motion, Seals Decl., ¶¶1-12.) This declartion is required
before the Court can grant relief under Code of Civil Procedure section 473.5. 
 
Finally, Defendant moves to vacate the default on
grounds that it is void, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section
473, subdivision (d), which states that “[t]he court may, .... on motion of
either party after notice to the other party, set aside any void judgment or
order.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (d).) The Motion points to Rogers v.
Silverman (1989) 216 Cal.App.3d 1114, 1116, which holds that the limitations
period contained in Code of Civil Procedure section 473.5 applies by analogy to
motions brought under Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (d). As
noted above, the Motion is timely under Code of Civil Procedure section 473.5.
Defendant contends that the entry of default is void due to defective service,
which was the same ground raised in Rogers. In support, Defendant
submits a declaration disputing that service occurred as stated in the proof of
personal service filed on September 15, 2021. 
 
“When a defendant
challenges the court’s personal
jurisdiction on the ground of improper service of process ‘the burden is on the
plaintiff to prove the existence of jurisdiction by proving, inter alia, the
facts requisite to an effective service.’” (Summers
v. McClanahan (2006) 140 Cal.App.4th 403, 413; see also Lebel v. Mai
(2012) 210 Cal.App.4th 1154, 1160.) However, a proof of service
containing a declaration from a registered process server invokes a rebuttable presumption
affecting the burden of producing
evidence of the facts stated in the return. (Cal. Evid. Code, § 647; see American
Express Centurion Bank v. Zara (2011) 199 Cal.App.4th 383,
390.)
 
Here,
the challenged
proof of service is attested to by a registered process server, and therefore,
is entitled to a presumption of truth in its contents. (Proof of
Personal Service, filed 09/15/21, ¶7e.) The burden to disprove the facts stated in the proof of
substitute service, therefore, falls first to Defendant. The proof of service
states that Defendant was sub-served by leaving the Summons and Complaint at
5000 Patagonia Court, Los Angeles, California on September 13, 2021 with a
person described as “Jane Doe (60 yrs old, female, black, 150lbs, 5’6”,
black hair, brown eyes).” (Proof of Substitute Service, filed 09/15/21, ¶¶4-5.)
Defendant declares that he did not live at 5000 Patagonia Court on September
13, 2021 but offers no documentary evidence to support this claim. (Motion,
Seals Decl., ¶4.) Instead, he points to an extension of lease document for the
service address indicating a termination date of January 14, 2021. (Id.
at Exh. 2.) This does not demonstrate or create an inference regarding where Defendant
lived on September 13, 2021, which was eight months later. What lease agreement
might exist after the January 14, 2021 termination date cannot be determined
from this evidence. Defendant’s conclusory declaration that he did not live at
the service address is not sufficient to overcome the presumption of truth.
(See Cruz v. Fagor America, Inc. (2007) 146
Cal.App.4th 488, 509 [citing Rios v. Singh (2021) 65 Cal.App.5th 871,
885].)
 
Therefore, the Court
cannot find that 5000 Patagonia Court was not Defendant’s usual mailing address
or usual place of abode, which are proper locations for substitute service
under Code of Civil Procedure section 415.20. Without this finding, the Court cannot
rule that service was defective and the default judgment void under Code of Civil Procedure section 473,
subdivision (d). 
 
Defendant moves to quash service of the Summons
and Complaint pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 418.10. The grounds
to quash exist based on the purportedly defective service. To the extent that Defendant has not shown defective
service of the Summons and Complaint, however, the Court also will not grant
the request to quash service.  
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant Bryan Kennedy Seals’ Motion to Quash Service of
Summons of Complaint and Vacate Void Default Judgment is CONTINUED TO DECEMBER
14, 2023 AT 10:00 AM IN DEPARTMENT 26 IN THE SPRING STREET COURTHOUSE. BY
NOVEMBER 20, 2023, DEFENDANT IS TO FILE AND SERVE A SUPPLEMENTAL DECLARATION
WITH SUPPORTING EXHIBITS DEMONSTRATING HIS HOME ADDRESS, USUAL PLACE OF ABODE,
USUAL PLACE OF BUSINESS, AND USUAL MAILING ADDRESS AT THE TIME OF THE PURPORTED
SUBSTITUTE SERVICE IN THIS ACTION. FAILURE TO DO SO MAY RESULT IN THE MOTION
BEING DENIED.
