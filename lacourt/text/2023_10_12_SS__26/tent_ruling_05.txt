ANALYSIS:
 
On May 18, 2023, Defendant PV Holding Corporation
(“Defendant PV”) served Form Interrogatories, Set One and Request for
Production of Documents, Set One, on Plaintiff State Farm Mutual Automobile
Insurance Company (“Plaintiff”) (Motions, Stone Decl.,
Exh. A.) Despite a meet and confer effort extending the deadline to serve
verified responses without objections, Plaintiff has not done so. (Id.
at Exh. B.) Defendant PV filed the instant (1) Motion to Compel Responses to
Form Interrogatories, Set One, and Request for Sanctions; and (1) Motion to Compel
Responses to Request for Production of Documents, Set One, and Request for
Sanctions, on August 9, 2023. No oppositions have been filed to date.
 
Discussion
 
There is no requirement for a prior meet and confer effort
before a motion to compel initial responses can be filed. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.300.) Further, the motion can be brought any time after the responding
party fails to provide the responses. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300.) Based on Plaintiff’s failure to timely
respond to the propounded discovery, Defendant PV is entitled to an order
compelling service of verified responses to the discovery requests without
objections. 
 
Plaintiff’s failure to timely respond constitutes a misuse
of the discovery process. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (d).) Sanctions
are appropriate under Code of Civil Procedure sections 2023.010 and 2023.030
and have been properly noticed. However, the amount sought is excessive. Under
a lodestar calculation, sanctions are awarded in the amount of $493.30 based on
two hours of attorney time billed at $185.00 per hour and filing fees of $61.65
per motion. (Motions, Stone
Decl., ¶¶7-8.) 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant PV Holding Corporation’s
(1) Motion to Compel Responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One, and Request
for Sanctions; and (2) Motion to Compel Responses to Request for Production of
Documents, Set One, and Request for Sanctions, are GRANTED. PLAINTIFF STATE FARM MUTUAL AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE COMPANY IS TO
SERVE VERIFIED RESPONSES TO THE DISCOVERY REQUESTS WITHOUT OBJECTIONS WITHIN 20
DAYS’ SERVICE OF THIS ORDER. PLAINTIFF AND COUNSEL OF RECORD ARE JOINTLY AND
SEVERALLY ORDERED TO PAY SANCTIONS OF $493.30 TO PLAINTIFF’S COUNSEL WITHIN 20
DAYS’ SERVICE OF THIS ORDER.
