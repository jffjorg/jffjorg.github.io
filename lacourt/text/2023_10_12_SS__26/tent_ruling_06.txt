ANALYSIS:
 
Plaintiff Eric B. Dees (“Plaintiff”) filed the instant
action against Defendant Ron L. Martinez (“Defendant”) on February 27, 2023. Following
Defendant’s failure to file a responsive pleading, default judgment was entered
in Plaintiff’s favor on May 24, 2023. Notice of Entry of Judgment was filed on
July 28, 2023. 
 
Defendant filed the instant Motion to Dismiss on September 20,
2023. Plaintiff filed an opposition on October 3, 2023. 
 
Discussion
 
As an initial matter, Plaintiff points out that notice of
the Motion was not timely nor proper. The Motion was served on September 25,
2023, only 15 court days prior to the hearing date. Code of Civil Procedure
section 1005, subdivision (b) requires service at least 16 court days in
advance. Also, the papers were simply left on Plaintiff’s doorstep, which is
not an authorized method of service. (See Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1010, et seq.)
Failure to give notice of a motion is not only a violation of the statutory
requirements but of due process. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1005; Jones v. Otero
(1984) 156 Cal.App.3d 754, 757.) 
 
Second, the Motion is not
accompanied by a memorandum of points and authorities, as required. “The
memorandum must contain a statement of facts, a concise statement of the law,
evidence and arguments relied on, and a discussion of the statutes, cases, and
textbooks cited in support of the position advanced.” (Cal. Rules of Court,
Rule 3.1113(b).) Indeed, Defendant’s failure to provide a memorandum as
required by the Rule is an “admission that the [request] is without merit and
cause for its denial.” (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1113(a), (b); In re
Marriage of Falcone & Fyke (2012) 203 Cal.App.4th 964, 976.)
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the
foregoing, the hearing on Defendant Ron L. Martinez’s Motion to Vacate
Involuntary Lien is CONTINUED TO JANUARY 16, 2024 AT 10:00 AM IN DEPARTMENT 26
IN THE SPRING STREET COURTHOUSE. BY DECEMBER 19, 2023, DEFENDANT IS TO FILE AND
SERVE A MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES AS REQUIRED BY CAL. RULES OF COURT
RULE 3.1113 AND ANY SUPPORTING EVIDENCE. ALSO BY DECEMBER 19, 2023, DEFENDANT
IS TO FILE PROOF OF SERVICE DEMONSTRATING SERVICE OF THE MEMORANDUM OF POINTS
AND AUTHORITIES AND EVIDENCE ON PLAINTIFF. FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THE COURT’S
ORDER MAY RESULT IN THE MOTION BEING DENIED.
