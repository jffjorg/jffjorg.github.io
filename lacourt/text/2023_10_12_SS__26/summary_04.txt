The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the Petition to Declare Mobilehome Abandoned filed by Covina Hills MHC against Eugenia Souza. The Petition is continued to December 18, 2023, at 8:30 am in Department 26 of the Spring Street Courthouse. The Petitioner may file and serve supplemental papers correcting the defects noted in the ruling by November 20, 2023. The Respondent may file and serve a supplemental response by December 4, 2023.

The Judge's analysis is based on the facts presented in the Petition and the lack of evidence to support the allegations. The Notice of Belief of Abandonment was allegedly posted on January 19, 2023, but the document is not authenticated, dated, nor supported by a proof of service. The Petitioner has not demonstrated that the mobilehome is unoccupied or that a reasonable person would believe it to be abandoned.

The Judge notes that the Respondent has requested a continuance of the hearing date due to a recent illness, and the Petitioner has not filed any opposition to the request. The Judge orders that the Petitioner may file and serve supplemental papers correcting the defects noted in the ruling, and the Respondent may file and serve a supplemental response. The case will be heard on December 18, 2023.
