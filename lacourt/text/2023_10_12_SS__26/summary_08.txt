The court has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to compel arbitration filed by Plaintiff Aaron Sayles. The motion is denied. The ruling states that Plaintiff has not shown jurisdiction to compel Defendant Las Playas to arbitration because it has not been served with the summons and complaint. Additionally, Plaintiff has not shown jurisdiction to enter Defendant Westlake's default because it failed to file a responsive pleading. As a result, the court will enter Defendant Westlake's default, but will not compel Defendant Las Playas to arbitration. The ruling also notes that Plaintiff's motion to compel arbitration is denied.
