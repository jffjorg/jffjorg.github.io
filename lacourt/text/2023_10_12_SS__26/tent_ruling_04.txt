Discussion
 
Pursuant
to Civil Code section 798.61, Petitioner
seeks a court order deeming Respondent’s mobilehome (“the Mobilehome”), located
at 17350 E. Temple Ave., Space 446, La Puente, California (“the Space”), to be
abandoned, and awarding Petitioner rent due on the Space from May 1, 2022 to
the present, accruing at $1,166.00 per month, plus costs and attorney’s fees.
(Pet., ¶6 and Prayer ¶¶1-6.) 
 
A.         Determination of “Abandoned
Mobilehome”—Civ. Code § 798.61(a)(1)
 
Pursuant
to Civil Code, section 798.61, subdivision (a)(1), an “abandoned mobilehome” means
a mobilehome about which all of the following are true:
 
(A) It is located in a
mobilehome park on a site for which no rent has been paid to the management for
the preceding 60 days.
 
(B)
It is unoccupied.
 
(C)
A reasonable person would believe it to be abandoned.
 
(D)
It is not permanently affixed to the land.
 
(Civ. Code, § 798.61, subd. (a)(1).) The Petition is not supported
by any declaration attesting to the facts alleged therein. A Notice of
Abandonment on the Mobilehome was allegedly posted on the mobilehome and served
by certified mail on January 19, 2023, but the document is not authenticated,
dated, nor supported by a proof of service. (Pet., Exh. 1.) Petitioner,
therefore, has not demonstrated that the Mobilehome is unoccupied or that a
reasonable person would believe the Mobilehome to be abandoned within the
meaning of Civil Code section 798.61, subdivision (a)(1).
 
B.         Notice of Belief of Abandonment—Civ.
Code § 798.61(b)
 
Civil Code, section
798.61, subdivision (b) requires: 
 
“After determining a mobilehome
in a mobilehome park to be an abandoned mobilehome, the management shall post a
notice of belief of abandonment on the mobilehome for not less than 30 days,
and shall deposit copies of the notice in the United States mail, postage
prepaid, addressed to the homeowner at the last known address and to any known
registered owner, if different from the homeowner, and to any known holder of a
security interest in the abandoned mobilehome. This notice shall be mailed by
registered or certified mail with a return receipt requested.”


(Civ. Code, § 798.61, subd. (b).) Petitioner attached a
Notice of the Belief of Abandonment to the Petition but as discussed above, has
not demonstrated that it was served on Respondent by posting and certified
mail. It remains that the requirements of Civil Code, section 798.61,
subdivision (b) are not satisfied.
 
C.        Petition for Judicial Declaration—Civ.
Code § 798.61(c)
 
Civ. Code § 798.61(c)(1) states:
 
“Thirty or more days following posting
pursuant to subdivision (b), the management may file a petition in the superior
court in the county in which the mobilehome park is located, for a judicial
declaration of abandonment of the mobilehome. A proceeding under this
subdivision is a limited civil case.  Copies
of the petition shall be served upon the homeowner, any known registered owner,
and any known person having a lien or security interest of record in the
mobilehome by posting a copy on the mobilehome and mailing copies to those
persons at their last known addresses by registered or certified mail with a
return receipt requested in the United States mail, postage prepaid.”  (Emphasis added.)
 
(Civ. Code, § 798.61, subd. (c)(1).) La Puente is located
within the County of Los Angeles, which is within this Court’s jurisdiction. However,
the Court cannot determine that the Petition was filed more than 30 days after
the Notice of Belief of Abandonment was posted. Although there is no proof of
service of the Petition, Respondent’s appearance in the action has waived any
defect in service of the Petition itself. (See Carlton v. Quint (2000)
77 Cal.App.4th 690, 697.) 
 
D.        Charges, Attorneys’ Fees, and Costs
 
“If, at the hearing, the petitioner shows by a preponderance
of the evidence that the criteria for an abandoned mobilehome has been
satisfied and no party establishes an interest therein at the hearing and
tenders all past due rent and other charges, the court shall enter a judgment
of abandonment, determine the amount of charges to which the petitioner is
entitled, and award attorney's fees and costs to the petitioner.” (Civ. Code, §
798.61, subd. (d)(2).) Petitioner asks for accrued rent/storage fees on the
Space in the amount of $1,166.00 per month from May 1, 2022. (Pet., ¶6.) No
evidence is submitted to support the monthly rent sought, nor with respect to
the amount of attorney’s fees and costs sought. 
 
Finally, the Court notes that Respondent has asked for a
continuance of the hearing date due to a recent illness. (Request for
Continuance, filed 10/03/23, ¶4.) Petitioner has not filed any opposition to
the request for a continuance.
