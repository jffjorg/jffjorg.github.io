ANALYSIS:
 
On July 12, 2023, Plaintiff Los Angeles Federal Credit Union
(“Plaintiff”) served Requests for Admissions on Defendant Lola Marie Lowe (“Defendant”). (Motion, Anaya Decl., Exh. A.) Defendant served
unverified responses on July 24, 2023. (Id. at Exh. B.) Despite a meet and
confer effort, to date, Defendant has not served verified responses to the
Requests for Admission. (Id. at ¶¶4-5 and Exh. C.) Plaintiff filed the
instant Motion to Deem Requests for Admission Admitted (“the Motion”) on July 18,
2023. No opposition has been filed to date. 
 
There is no requirement for a prior meet and confer effort
before a motion to deem requests for admission can be filed. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2033.280.) Further, the motion can be brought at any time after the
responding party fails to provide the responses. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280.)
Due to Defendant’s failure to timely serve responses and resultant waiver of
objections, Plaintiff is entitled to an order deeming the Requests for
Admission admitted. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280.) 
 
The Court is required to award sanctions under the moving
statute. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).) While properly noticed, the
sanctions sought are excessive. Under a lodestar calculation, sanctions are
granted against Defendant in the amount of $455.00 based on one hour of
attorney time billed at $395.00 per hour, plus the $60.00 filing fee. (Motion, Anaya
Decl., ¶8.)
 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiff Los Angeles Federal Credit Union’s Motion to Deem
Requests for Admission Admitted and Request for Sanctions is GRANTED. DEFENDANT
LOLA MARIE LOWE IS ORDERED TO
PAY SANCTIONS OF $455.00 TO PLAINTIFF’S COUNSEL WITHIN 20 DAYS’ SERVICE OF THIS
ORDER.
