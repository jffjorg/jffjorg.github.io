And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in response to Plaintiff Maira Flashey's motion to compel Defendant FCA US, Inc. to further respond to requests for production of documents related to Plaintiff's 2022 Dodge Durango vehicle. The Plaintiff alleges that the vehicle had defects that Defendant was unable to repair within a reasonable number of attempts, and seeks to hold Defendant liable under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act. The Plaintiff served the requests for production of documents on February 6, 2024, and Defendant failed to respond in a timely manner. As a result, the Defendant waived all objections and is now required to serve verified responses, without objections, to the requests for production of documents and produce responsive documents to the Plaintiff within 30 days. The judge has ordered the Plaintiff to give notice of this order and to file proof of service of same.
