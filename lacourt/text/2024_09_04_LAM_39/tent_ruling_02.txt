MOTION:  


Motion to Compel Further Discovery Responses




MOVING PARTY:


Plaintiff Maira Flashey




OPPOSING PARTY:


None



 
MOTION
            Plaintiff
Maira Flashey (“Plaintiff”) moves to compel Defendant FCA US, Inc. (“Defendant”)
to further respond to Requests for Production of Documents, set one (“RPD”),
Nos. 8-10, 12-20, 26, 40-41, 43-47, and 51-57.
ANALYSIS
If the propounding
party deems responses to requests for production of documents unsatisfactory,
the propounding party may move to compel further responses.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310.)  
In the instant
case, Plaintiff alleges her 2022 Dodge Durango vehicle had defects Defendant
was unable to repair within a reasonable number of attempts.  Plaintiff, therefore, contends Defendant is
liable under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act.  Plaintiff demanded Defendant produce
documents related to Plaintiff’s vehicle and concerning the same make and model
of that vehicle.  Plaintiff served the
RPD on Defendant on February 6, 2024 by e-mail. 
Defendant’s responses were due by March 11, 2024.  Defendant failed to timely respond without
explanation.  As such, Defendant waived
all objections.  Defendant then served
unverified and untimely responses with objections to the RPD on April 6, 2024,
but produced no documents.  
“Unsworn responses
are tantamount to no responses at all.” 
(Appleton v. Superior Court (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 632,
636.)  Defendant belatedly served a verification
of its response on June 3, 2024, although it was purportedly executed on May
30, 2024.  However, by serving untimely
responses, Defendant had waived all objections. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a).)  Accordingly, Defendant must further respond
to the RPD.  Therefore, Defendant is to
serve verified responses, without objections, to RPD Nos. 8-10, 12-20, 26,
40-41, 43-47, and 51-57 and produce responsive documents to Plaintiff within 30
days.  
Plaintiff is ordered
to give notice of this order and to file proof of service of same.
