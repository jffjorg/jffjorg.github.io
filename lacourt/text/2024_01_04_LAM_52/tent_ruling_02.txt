 Case Number:  BC635357    Hearing Date:   January 4, 2024    Dept:  52 Judgment
Debtor Mimi Park, aka Mi Jin Kim’s Motion to Compel Acknowledgment of
Satisfaction of Judgment
            Judgment debtor Mimi Park aka Mi Jin
Kim moves under Code of Civil Procedure section 724.050 to compel judgment
creditor FCP Brands, Inc. to file acknowledgment of satisfaction of judgment.  Section 724.050, subdivision (d) provides, “If
the court determines that the judgment has been satisfied and that the judgment
creditor has not complied with the demand, the court shall either (1) order the
judgment creditor to comply with the demand or (2) order the court clerk to
enter satisfaction of the judgment.”  
The
court finds good cause to require oral testimony by judgment debtor Mimi Park
and Michael Chang, officer of judgment creditor FCP Brands, Inc.  (Chang Decl., ¶ 1.)  “Evidence received at a law and motion
hearing must be by declaration or request for judicial notice without testimony
or cross-examination, unless the court orders otherwise for good cause shown.”  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1306.)  Determining if the judgment has been
satisfied requires interpreting a handwritten contract (Park Decl., Ex. 2) and may
involve considering parol evidence.  Park
and Chang submitted conflicting declarations. 
Oral testimony from Park and Chang will assist the court in making
credibility determinations to decide if Park satisfied the judgment.  
            The court hereby continues
the hearing on judgment debtor Mimi Park aka Mi Jin Kim’s motion to compel
acknowledgment of satisfaction of judgment to January 12, 2024, at 10:00 a.m.
