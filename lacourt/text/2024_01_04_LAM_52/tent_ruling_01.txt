  Case Number:  22STCV29609    Hearing Date:   January 4, 2024    Dept:  52 Defendant
Vijay Fadia’s Motion for Attorney’s Fees Per Deed of Trust
Defendant Vijay
Fadia moves for an award of $14,082.50 in attorney fees against plaintiff Kevin
McDowell.  
Fadia fails to show
a basis for recovering attorney fees in this action.  A prevailing party may only recover attorney
fees when authorized by contract, statute, or other law.  (CCP § 1033.5(a)(10).)  The only statute Fadia cites is Civil Code
section 1717.  (Motion, pp. 1-2.)  Civil Code section 1717(a) provides, “In any
action on a contract, where the contract specifically provides that attorney’s
fees and costs, which are incurred to enforce that contract, shall be awarded
either to one of the parties or to the prevailing party, then the party who is
determined to be the party prevailing on the contract … shall be entitled to
reasonable attorney’s fees in addition to other costs.”  
Civil Code section
1717 does not support Facia’s claim because he is not the prevailing party
under that statute.  “Where an action has been
voluntarily dismissed or dismissed pursuant to a settlement of the case, there
shall be no prevailing party for purposes of this section.”  (Civ. Code, § 1717(b)(2).)  Plaintiff voluntarily dismissed the action on
January 20, 2023.  Fadia therefore is not
the prevailing party and cannot recover attorney fees under Civil Code section
1717. 
Moreover, the
contractual provision Fadia relies upon does not support his position.  Facia cites a provision in a deed of trust
and assignment of rents made between Mattie B. Evans (plaintiff’s late mother),
trustee, or successor trustee, under the Mattie B. Evans Family Trust dated
June 7, 2016, and Fadia as beneficiary.  (Fadia
Decl., Ex. 2.)  The deed of trust
provides that Evans, as trustor, agrees “To appear in and defend any action or
proceeding purporting to affect the security hereof or the rights or powers of
the Beneficiary or Trustee and to pay all costs and expenses, including cost of
evidence of title and attorney’s fees in a reasonable sum, in any such action
or proceeding in which Beneficiary or Trustee may appear, and in any suit
brought by Beneficiary to record this Deed.” 
(Id., p. 1, ¶ (4).)  The
deed of trust is secured by property at 4737 Don Porfirio Place, Los Angeles,
CA, 90008.  (Id., p. 1.)  Evans executed the deed of trust on August
31, 2018.  (Id., p. 3.)  
The deed of
trust’s fee provision does not necessarily apply to every lawsuit against Fadia
regarding the property.  This action did
not purport to affect the security or the rights or powers of Fadia as
beneficiary or trustee under the deed of trust. 
Plaintiff’s complaint alleges Mattie B. Evans fell behind—or was falsely
told she fell behind—on mortgage payments on a different loan originated by
Countrywide Bank in 2008.  (Comp., ¶¶ 12,
15, 50-52, 54-57.)  The complaint further
alleges, “On September 16, 2020 the Subject Property was sold at a non-judicial
foreclosure sale to Defendant, Redwood Holdings, LLC.”  (¶ 24.) 
Nonjudicial foreclosure under the 2008 deed of trust would terminate
Fadia’s interest in the property.  (Miscione v. Barton
Development Co. (1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 1320, 1326 [“the general rule is that
foreclosure of a senior encumbrance terminates subordinate liens”].)  Plaintiff’s
complaint does not seek to quiet title, set aside the foreclosure sale, or
otherwise affect any party’s rights or title to the subject real property.  Plaintiff sought only damages.  (Comp., pp. 11-12.)  
Rather than
alleging any wrongdoing related to the 2018 deed of trust, the complaint
alleges Fadia is liable for breaching an agreement “to act as the agent of
[plaintiff’s late mother] to obtain a loan in the amount of $100,000” to redeem
the property.  (Comp., ¶ 18.)  Plaintiff alleges, “Fadia surreptitiously
decided it was in his best interests to let the house go to foreclosure, so
that one of his investor clients could buy it at the pending foreclosure sale
in order to make a large profit.”  (¶
21.)  Plaintiff further alleges Redwood
Holdings, LLC bought the property at the foreclosure sale for $931,000 (¶¶ 24,
45), then sold it for $1,400,000 and shared the profit with Fadia and others (¶
46).  This purported scheme is not
related to the 2018 deed of trust between Fadia and Evans.      
Fadia argues plaintiff
only sued him because he “did not loan Plaintiff even more money” and his “only
connection whatsoever to Plaintiff was [his] 2018 mortgage loan to Plaintiff’s
mother, then the owner of the Subject Property.”  (Fadia Decl., ¶ 2.)  Whether plaintiff had a good reason to sue
Fadia is irrelevant.  Fadia’s 2018
mortgage loan to plaintiff’s mother is not connected to this lawsuit.  Its attorney fee provision therefore does not
apply.  
Fadia’s motion
also refers to an attorney fee provision in the promissory note: “Should suit
be commenced to collect this note or any portion thereof, such sum as the Court
may deem reasonable shall be added hereto as attorney's fees.”  (Fadia Decl., Ex. 1.)  This suit was not commenced to collect this
note or any portion of it.  Under the
note, plaintiff’s late mother, Mattie B. Evans, as trustee of the Mattie B.
Evans Family Trust dated June 7, 2016, agreed to pay Fadia $30,000 plus
interest.  Fadia did not bring this
action to collect money from Evans or plaintiff.  Plaintiff brought this action to seek damages
from Fadia for reasons unrelated to the 2018 promissory note.
