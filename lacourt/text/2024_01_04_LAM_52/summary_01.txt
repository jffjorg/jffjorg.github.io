The judge noted that Fadia is not the prevailing party under Civil Code section 1717, and that the deed of trust's fee provision does not necessarily apply to every lawsuit against Fadia. Additionally, the judge found that the complaint does not seek to quiet title, set aside the foreclosure sale, or otherwise affect any party's rights or title to the subject real property.
