The Judge's tentative ruling sustains the demurrers filed by East West Bank and Bank of America, and also sustains Wu Di's demurrer and motion to strike. The Judge finds that the plaintiffs have failed to state a valid cause of action against the defendants, and that the defendants are not liable for the alleged fraudulent activities.
