And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to file a second amended complaint, subject to certain conditions. The plaintiff seeks to add two additional causes of action: involuntary dissolution of the limited liability company and conversion. The judge finds that these additional causes of action do not expand the scope of the case or require additional discovery. The parties have been discussing settlement and have agreed to have the property appraised and participate in a second mediation session. The judge notes that the trial date is less than four months away, but this provides sufficient time to prepare for a trial that will include the additional causes of action. The judge orders that the plaintiff will not propound any further written discovery and will stipulate to a trial continuance if requested by the defendant's counsel.
