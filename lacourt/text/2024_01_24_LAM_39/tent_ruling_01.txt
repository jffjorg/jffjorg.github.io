  Case Number:  19STCV28669    Hearing Date:   January 24, 2024    Dept:  39 Tami
Kim Alan v. Susan Arnheiter, et al., Case No. 19STCV28669
 
The
Court rules in chambers as follows: 
 
On
January 18, 2024, Defendants’ counsel filed an ex parte application to advance
the hearing on the motion for summary judgment from February 26, 2024, to
February 22, 2024, purportedly to comply with the rule that motions for summary
judgment shall be heard no later than 30 days before the trial date. 
Plaintiff opposed the ex parte application. 

 
A
motion for summary judgment must be served at least 75 days before the hearing
(in addition to the notice period if served by mail).  (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c(a)(2).)  A motion for summary judgment must be heard
no later than 30 days before the trial date “unless the court for good cause
orders otherwise.”  (Code Civ. Proc., §
437c(a)(3).  Defendants’ motion complies
with these requirements.  The motion was
personally served on December 8, 2023, which means that the motion may be heard
on or after February 21, 2024.  The trial
date is March 26, 2024, which means that 30 calendar days before trial is
Sunday, February 25, 2024.  Because this
date falls on a Sunday, the deadline is automatically continued to the next
day, which is Monday, February 26, 2024, per Code of Civil Procedure section
2016.060.  Regardless, the Court found that
there is good cause to hear the motion less than 30 days before trial.  Congestion of the Court’s calendar does not
permit the Court to advance the motion to February 22, 2024, and doing so would
prejudice Plaintiff’s counsel, as he would have less time to prepare an
opposition to the motion.  (See Court’s
Minute Order, dated January 19, 2024.) 
Conversely, the Court found no prejudice in hearing the motion 29 days
before trial.  (See ibid.)  
 
Inexplicably,
Defendants’ counsel filed the same ex parte application again—which is an
improper motion for reconsideration under Code of Civil Procedure section 1008—and
does not identify any error in the Court’s order of January 19, 2024.  Nevertheless, the Court advances and
continues the ex parte application to the same date/time as the hearing on the motion
for summary judgment:  February 26, 2024,
at 8:30 a.m.  If the parties establish
any prejudice in hearing this motion 29 days before trial, the Court will
consider whether to grant this ex parte application and continue the trial one
day—to Wednesday, March 27, 2024—so that the motion is heard exactly 30 days
before trial.  The Court need not advance
the hearing, per Sentry Insurance Company v. Superior Court (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d
526, because it will hear the motion 29 days before trial or continue the trial
one day if there is any prejudice in doing so.    
 
Based
upon the foregoing, the Court orders as follows:
 
1.       The ex parte application is continued to
February 26, 2024, at 8:30 a.m.
 
2.       Defendants’ counsel shall comply with
Code of Civil Procedure section 1008 in the future.  
 
3.       Defendants’ counsel shall provide notice
and file proof of such with the Court.
