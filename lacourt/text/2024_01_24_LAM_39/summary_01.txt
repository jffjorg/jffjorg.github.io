And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in chambers regarding the motion for summary judgment filed by the defendants. The defendants' counsel had filed an ex parte application to advance the hearing on the motion from February 26, 2024, to February 22, 2024, citing a rule that motions for summary judgment must be heard no later than 30 days before the trial date. However, the Judge ruled that the motion complies with the requirements and that there is good cause to hear the motion less than 30 days before trial. The Judge also found that advancing the hearing would prejudice the plaintiff's counsel, who would have less time to prepare an opposition to the motion. The Judge therefore denied the ex parte application, but agreed to advance and continue the ex parte application to February 26, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. The Judge also ordered defendants' counsel to comply with Code of Civil Procedure section 1008 in the future and to provide notice and file proof of such with the Court.
