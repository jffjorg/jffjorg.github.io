The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the plaintiff's application for default judgment without prejudice. The plaintiff, ROBERT LOZA, is seeking to collect on a defaulted loan and a breached rental agreement. The defendants, ANDREA COLORADO and DANIEL LOZA, owe the plaintiff a total of $149,499. The judge has previously denied the plaintiff's application due to defects in the application, including inadequate evidence and a failure to dismiss the defendants. The plaintiff has since filed an amended declaration, but the defects have not been cured. The judge has denied the application again, citing the plaintiff's failure to provide a computation of rent, bank statements to corroborate loan payments, and a failure to accurately calculate damages.
