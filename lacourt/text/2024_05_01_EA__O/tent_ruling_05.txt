Counsel were unable to contact their clients such that responses to Defendant
Hernandez’s discovery requests were untimely produced. Furthermore, Plaintiffs’
Counsel still does not have contact with Plaintiff Lezihaya; an investigator
has been hired to locate her. 
 


[2] The first deposition was scheduled for 10/19/2023,
but Defense Counsel took that off calendar as he was ill. (Motion p. 50 of 52
of PDF.) 
 


[3] Defendant has been communicating with Deponent’s
daughter, Ms. Gonzalez, and has spoken with Ms. Gonzalez numerous times to try
to accommodate Deponent. (Motion p. 50 of 52 of PDF.) During their 10/14/23
call, Ms. Gonzalez notified Defense Counsel’s secretary (Maria Aguayo) that
Deponent did not want her deposition taken.
