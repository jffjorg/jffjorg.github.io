[1] The motion seeks to
strike paragraph 59 as it lacks alleging an underlying statute and any
reference to a mandatory duty statute regarding training because none exists.
As the complaint is to be amended again, the MTS is moot. 
 


[2] The minimal factual
background but further evidences the lack of ultimate, specific facts lacking
in the FAC. 


[3] It is unclear how
the District would have known of. L.R’s dangerous propensities prior to 2/14/22
when the allegations state that the alleged assaults started on 2/14/22.
Put another way, if it was not happening before 2/14/22, then there is
nothing for the District to have been aware of. 



[4] And to
the extent that Plaintiff will continue to incorporate by reference previous
portions of the pleading, the civil, it may do so for informational purposes
only. (Cal-West Nat. Bank v. Superior Court (1986) 185 Cal. App. 3d 96,
101.) It is not the court’s responsibility to determine what
allegations form what elements of the cause of action.
