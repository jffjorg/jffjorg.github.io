  Case Number:  23PSCV00064    Hearing Date:   May 1, 2024    Dept:  O Tentative Ruling
 
Plaintiff ROBERT
LOZA’s Application for Default Judgment is DENIED without prejudice,
for similar reasons to before. 
 
Background
 
This case pertains to unpaid loan(s) and breach of a rental
agreement. Plaintiff ROBERT LOZA alleges the following against Defendants
ANDREA COLORADO, aka ANDREA LOZA and DANIEL LOZA[1]:As
for the loans, Defendants owe Plaintiff $56,710. As for the rental agreement,
that was entered into in July 2015 and in 2019, Defendants stopped paying rent;
the sum now due to Plaintiff from the Defendants is $90,400.00. 
 
On January 9, 2023, Plaintiff filed suit against Defendants
alleging the following three (3) causes of action (COAs): 1.    
Breach of Contract 2.    
Money Had and Received  3.    
Intentional Misrepresentation
 
On January 15, 2023, Defendants were served. (See January
17, 2023 Proofs of Service.)[2]
 
On May 25, 2023, default was entered as to both Defendants.
 
On February 8, 2024, Plaintiff his first application for
entry of default judgment which the court denied. 
 
On April 24, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant application.[3]
 
Discussion
 
As with before, Plaintiff seeks entry of default judgment in
the total amount of $149,499.00, which is comprised of $146,180.00 in damages,
$2,680.00 in attorney fees, and $639.00 in costs. 
 
Previously, the court denied the application because: 
 
1.    
Doe
Defendants were not dismissed; 
2.    
Evidence Re: Loans: the submitted evidence did not match the
$56,710 sum. Additionally inadequate evidence was provided; “While some
of the loan payments were in cash (e.g., p. 16 of 25 of PDF [“Cash 3/16/20
$350.00; 3/15/20 $300”], other payments were transferred from a bank. (Ibid,
[e.g., “Transfer from Bank” dated 1/30/20 for $200 or 1/28/2020 for
$3,500.”].) Therefore, as a default judgment requires evidence, then
bank statements are to be provided to corroborate said transfers).” (2/29/24
Ruling.) 
3.    
The rental agreement states that the
agreed upon rent was $2,000 per month but Plaintiff appears to seek a
different amount. 
 
Now, despite filing an
amended declaration, the defects have not been cured.
 
First, Doe Defendants have not been dismissed. 
 
Second, Plaintiff has not provided a computation of rent (i.e.,
number of months unpaid and what monthly rental rate). To the extent
that the computation is the same as before, as previously noted, the monthly
rental agreement was not for $2,250.00. Additionally, upon a closer look, it appears Plaintiff’s
computation (as provided in the previous supplement) is charging Defendants a
$250 late fee on rent but the lease agreement only allows for a late charge of
$65.00. Therefore, Plaintiff is seeking recover for more than he
is entitled to. 
 
Third, Plaintiff has still not provided bank statements to
evidence the bank transfers to Andrea.  
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing, as Plaintiff has not cured the court’s
noted defects, the application is again denied without prejudice.
