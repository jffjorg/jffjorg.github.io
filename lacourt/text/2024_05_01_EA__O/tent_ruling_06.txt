leave to amend, notably for the reason that the FAC does not comply with
heightened pleading standard.  
 
(2)  
Motion To Strike Portions Of Plaintiff’s
Complaint On Behalf Of Walnut Valley Unified School District And Susan Arzola
is MOOT.[1]

 
Background
 
This case arises from a student’s alleged sexual assault by
another student while on campus.[2] 
 
On December 28, 2023, Plaintiff Y.O., a minor, and by and
through her Guardian Ad Litem, Beatriz P. filed suit against Defendants WALNUT
VALLEY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT (“District”); SUSAN ARZOLA (the “Principal”). 
 
On January 30, 2024, Plaintiff filed her first amended
complaint (FAC) against the same Defendants for: 1.    
Negligent Supervision Of Students [Gov. C. §§ 815.2,
815.6, And 820]; 2.    
Negligent Hiring, Supervision, Training And Retention
[Gov. C. § 815.2 And 820]; 3.    
Public Disclosure Of Private Information [Gov. C. §
815.6 And 820]; 4.    
Intentional Infliction Of Emotional Distress
 
On March 18, 2024, the District filed the instant demurrer
and motion to strike (MTS). 
 
On April 18, 2024, Plaintiff filed her opposition.
 
On April 24, 2024, the District filed its Reply. 
 
Legal Standard
 
The District brings forth the instant demurrer on the
grounds that the 1st and 2nd COAs fail to state facts
sufficient to constitute a cause of action and/or are uncertain, vague,
ambiguous and unintelligible. (Code
of Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (e), (f), respectively.) A demurrer tests the
sufficiency of the pleading; thus, the grounds for the demurrer must appear on
the face of the pleading or from judicially noticeable matters. (CCP
§430.30(a); Blank v. Kirwan, (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) The face of the pleading includes attachments and
incorporations by reference (Frantz v. Blackwell, (1987) 189 Cal.App.3d
91, 94); it does not include inadmissible hearsay. (Day v. Sharp,
(1975) 50 Cal.App.3d 904, 914.)
 
Discussion
 
Turning to the FAC, the factual allegations begin on page 6
(paragraph 23). The pertinent allegations are as follows:
 
From or about February 14, 2022, and
continuing to or about March 22, 2022, Plaintiff, a minor female special needs
student attending [school], was sexually abused on multiple occasions by a
fellow student, L.R., during school hours, on the [school] campus… Prior to
February 14, 2022, Defendants, and each of them, were aware that Plaintiff was
a special needs student, who, among other things, required the presence of a
1:1 aide during school hours. Prior to February 14, 2022, Defendants, and each
of them, were aware that because of Plaintiff’s special needs, she was at an
increased risk of being subjected to inappropriate misconduct, including sexual
misconduct, by other students attending South Pointe Middle School.[3]
Prior to February 14, 2022, Defendants, and each of them, had actual and
constructive notice that L.R. was a danger to other students. Defendants, and
each of them, had prior knowledge that L.R. had exhibited significant
behavioral problems before and during the period of time when the acts of
sexual battery and sexual assault were performed upon Plaintiff. Defendants,
and each of them, were acutely aware of L.R.’s history of engaging in sexually
inappropriate behavior with other students at WVUSD. Defendants, and each of
them, actually knew of the potential danger and direct threat L.R. posed to
WVUSD’s other students, including Plaintiff, a special needs student. (FAC pp.
6-7.) 
 
Effectively, what is alleged is
that Plaintiff was sexually harassed by another student and that the District
knew. But a negligence
cause of action must be pleaded with particularity as to a public entity.
(Demurrer p. 7, citing Lopez v. Southern Cal. Rapid Transit Dist.,
(1985) 40 Cal.3d 780, 795; Zipperer v. County of Santa Clara (2005) 133
Cal.App.4th 1013, 1020.) Here,
however, the pleading conclusively alleges that defendants knew or were on
notice of the perpetrator’s past unlawful sexual. To the extent that
Plaintiff in opposition argues that the California Supreme Court in C.A. v.
William S. Hart Union High School Dist. (2012) 53 Cal.4th 861, 872 has
“rejected” the particularity requirement, Plaintiff’s own excerpt of the case
does not support her proposition. (Opp. pp. 8-9.) What the court observed was
that the “identity of a government employee whose alleged negligence is
made the basis for vicarious liability” need not be pleaded prior to discovery.

 
Particularity requirements aside,
the pleading also fails to comply
with CCP section 425.10 subdivision (a), subsection (1), which provides that a
complaint “shall contain . . . [a] statement of the facts constituting the cause of action, in
ordinary and concise language.” The FAC, however, is largely a
recitation of law, the relevance of which is unclear.[4]

 
For the foregoing reasons, an amended complaint is needed
to better adjudicate the merits of the demurrer as the court is bound by the
pleadings on a demurrer. With that, the court will not, at this juncture,
address the individual liability of Arzola (the principal). 
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing, the demurrer is SUSTAINED with
leave to amend, rendering the MTS moot.
