Background
 
This case arises from a motor vehicle accident that occurred
on 2/26/2021.
 
On February 27, 2023, Plaintiffs ZALEKA SHELET TURNER, CORA
GORDON, and LAZHIYA VENEY (a minor) filed suit against Defendants FEDEX FREIGHT
WEST INC. and DAVID HERNANDEZ for: 1.    
Negligence and 2.    
Negligence Per Se
 
On June 20, 2023, Plaintiffs filed their first amended
complaint (FAC).
 
On November 6, 2023, Defendant Hernandez filed his answer.
 
On December 14, 2023, Plaintiffs named FEDEX GROUND PACKAGE
SYSTEM, INC. as Doe 1.
 
On January 9, 2024, Plaintiffs dismissed Fedex Freight West
Inc. 
 
On January 12, 2024, DEFENDANT FEDEX GROUND PACKAGE SYSTEM,
INC. filed its answer.
 
On February 29, 2024, the court held an IDC.[1]
The minute order states, in relevant part, “On the Court's own motion, the
Informal Discovery Conference (IDC) scheduled for 02/29/2024 is continued to
05/01/2024 at 10:00 AM in Department O at Pomona Courthouse South. The Court
and Counsel confer re: Defense Counsel's request to Depose Gloria Martinez
Rodriguez. In light of the above and by Order of the Court, the matter is
reserved as follows: The matter is reserved for May 1, 2024, at the Pomona
Courthouse in Department O at 10:00 a.m. for a Hearing on Motion to Compel
Deposition.”
 
On March 6, 2024, Defendant Hernandez filed the instant
motion.
 
On April 17, 2024, Plaintiffs’ Counsel Ardy Prinia filed a
motion to be relieved as counsel as to Lazhiya Veney. (The hearing on this
motion is set for 6/11/24.)
 
Legal Standard
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.010 states that any
party may take the "oral deposition of any person" in a matter on
issues "relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending
action." For depositions "that command only the attendance and the
testimony of the deponent.” Relatedly, CCP section 1987.1 allows a party to
move the Court for an order compelling the attendance of a witness to a
deposition if the witness fails to comply with a subpoena. The failure to
comply with a subpoena may also be punishable by contempt pursuant to Code of
Civil Procedure section 1991.1. 
 
Discussion
 
Defendant moves for an order directing compliance with the
subpoena and compelling deponent's attendance at a deposition on a date to be
determined at the hearing on this matter. More specifically, Deponent, Gloria
Martinez Rodriguez (a witness to the car accident), failed to appear at the 1/16/2024
deposition. (Motion, Ex. B.)[2]
 
Here, as Deponent has failed to appear at lawfully issued
subpoenas and she has not made objections otherwise, the court compels her
appearance.[3] 
 
 
As for sanctions, they are available for nonparties who
“flout the discovery process.” (Temple Comm. Hosp. v. Sup. Ct. (Ramos) (1999)
20 Cal.4th 464, 476-477) or who have failed to comply in bad (Sears,
Roebuck & Co. v. National Union Fire Ins. Co. of Pittsburgh (2005) 131
Cal.App.4th 1342, 1350-1351.) As the failure to attend could have been for a
different reason (e.g., hesitation about participating in litigation), the
court declines to issue monetary sanctions.
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing, the motion is GRANTED; sanctions are
not imposed.
