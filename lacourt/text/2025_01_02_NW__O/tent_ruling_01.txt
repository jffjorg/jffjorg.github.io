III.    LEGAL
STANDARD 
Code of Civil Procedure §
2033.420 provides:
“(a) If a party fails to admit the genuineness of
any document or the truth of any matter when requested to do so under this
chapter, and if the party requesting that admission thereafter proves the
genuineness of that document or the truth of that matter, the party requesting
the admission may move the court for an order requiring the party to whom the
request was directed to pay the reasonable expenses incurred in making that
proof, including reasonable attorney's fees.
(b) The court shall make this order unless it finds
any of the following:
(1) An objection to the request was sustained or a
response to it was waived under Section 2033.290.
(2) The admission sought was of no substantial importance.
(3) The party failing to make the admission had
reasonable ground to believe that that party would prevail on the matter.
(4) There was other good reason for the failure to
admit.”
Any fees awarded pursuant to this section “can be
awarded only for the period after [the losing party] denied the
requests for admission.” (Yoon v. Cam IX Trust (2021) 60 Cal.App.5th
388, 395 (emphasis added) (citing Garcia v. Hyster Co. (1994) 28
Cal.App.4th 724, 736).) 
A party seeking to avail itself of the exceptions
set forth in subdivision (b) has the burden of proving such exception(s) apply
because, among other reasons, “as a practical matter, the denying party is in
the best position to explain the reasons for the denial.” (Samsky v. State
Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. (2019) 37 Cal.App.5th 517, 524.)
“An RFA has ‘substantial importance’ if it is ‘central
to disposition of the case.’… In evaluating whether a ‘good reason’ exists for
denying a request to admit, ‘a court may properly consider whether at the time the
denial was made the party making the denial held a reasonably entertained good
faith belief that the party would prevail on the issue at trial.’” (Doe v.
Los Angeles County Dept. of Children & Fam. Servs. (2019) 37
Cal.App.5th 675, 690 (quoting Brooks v. American Broadcasting Co. (1986)
179 Cal.App.3d 500, 509 & 511).) “Where it becomes clear from evidence
introduced by either party at trial that the party who denied for lack of
information or belief had access to the information at the time requests for
admissions were propounded, sanctions are justified because that party has a
duty to investigate.” (Bloxham v. Saldinger (2014) 228 Cal.App.4th 729,
752 (cleaned up).) 
Statutory attorney fees are ordinarily determined by
the court pursuant to the “lodestar” or “touchstone” method. Under this
approach, a base amount is calculated from a compilation of time reasonably
spent and reasonable hourly compensation of each attorney. (See,
e.g., Serrano v. Unruh (1982) 32 Cal.3d 621, 639.) The base amount is then
adjusted in light of various factors. The Supreme Court has
not mandated “a blanket ‘lodestar only’ approach; every fee-shifting statute
must be construed on its own merits.” (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th
1122, 1136.) 
Normally, a “reasonable” hourly rate is the
prevailing rate charged by attorneys of similar skill and experience in the
relevant community. (See PLCM Group, Inc. v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th
1084, 1095.) However, the court may consider various other factors when
determining a reasonable hourly rate—e.g., the attorney's skill and experience,
the nature of the work performed, the relevant area of expertise and the
attorney's customary billing rates. (See Flannery v. California Highway
Patrol (1998) 61 Cal.App.4th 629, 632-33.) 
The purpose of a lodestar multiplier is “primarily
to compensate the attorney for the prevailing party at a rate reflecting the
risk of nonpayment in contingency cases as a class.” (Ketchum, 24
Cal.4th at 1138.) The party seeking the fee enhancement bears the burden of
proof. (See id.) The lodestar amount may be adjusted based on various
factors specific to the case in order to fix the attorney fees at fair market
value for the services provided. (See PLCM Group, 22 Cal.4th at 1095-96;
see also Holguin v. DISH Network LLC (2014) 229 Cal.App.4th 1310, 1329.)
The factors include “‘(1) the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved,
(2) the skill displayed in presenting them, (3) the extent to which the nature
of the litigation precluded other employment by the attorneys, and (4) the
contingent nature of the fee award.’” (Holguin, 229 Cal.App.4th at
1332-33 (quoting Ketchum, 24 Cal.4th at 1132).) However, the multiplier
may not be imposed merely as a sanction to punish the losing party nor may the
court consider factors it already considered when arriving at the lodestar
amount. (See Ketchum, 24 Cal.4th at 1139.) 
IV.    ANALYSIS
A.      Defendant Has Proven Section 2033.420(b)(1)
Applies. 
First, the Court must examine whether Defendant’s
responses to the Requests for Admission (“RFA’s”) the instant motion relies on Code
of Civil Procedure § 2033.420(a)’s fee trigger provision. Plaintiffs rely on
Defendant’s responses to RFA’s Nos. 1-7, 9-11, and 21. (See Motion, pp.
3-4.) Defendant’s response to each RFA was the following: “Objection. The
request is not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.
Calls for information which is completely irrelevant to whether untenantable conditions
existed, and is harassing, and unduly burdensome, and grossly overbroad. The
request is also vague, ambiguous and overbroad as to time. The request is also
overbroad with respect to the term ‘subject property’. Plaintiffs’ lawsuit is
based on the habitability of one unit and not the entire apartment complex..[sic]”
(Declaration of Christian Oronsaye dated May 15, 2024, ¶¶ 4-5, Exs. 1-2.)
In Opposition, Defendant argues Plaintiffs forfeited
the right to attorney’s fees by failing to compel further Defendant’s further
responses to their RFA’s, as Defendant asserted only objections to all eleven
of Plaintiffs’ RFA’s. (See Opposition, pp. 3-4.) Plaintiffs therefore
waived the right to further responses and an award of costs for proving the
genuineness of the document or truth of the matter requested is barred pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure § 2033.420(b)(1). (See id.) 
In Reply, Plaintiffs argue Defendant objected to the
RFA’s but that “there was nothing left to compel in the admissions responses
because the answers of Defendants[sic] following the admissions were complete,
i.e. they left no part of the admission unanswered (as in the case of an
assertion of an inability to admit or deny, for example).” (Reply, pp. 3-4.) In
support of their argument, Plaintiffs rely on American Federation of State,
County & Municipal Employees v. Metropolitan Water Dist. (2005) 126
Cal.App.4th 247, 268 (“American Federation”).
The Court finds Plaintiffs are not entitled to an
award of attorney’s fees because Defendant has met its burden of proving the
exception contained in Code of Civil Procedure § 2033.420(b)(1) applies. Defendant
provided only objections to Plaintiffs’ RFA’s Nos. 1-7, 9-11, and 21. Defendant
did not provide admissions or denials to any of the RFA’s at issue. As a
result, Plaintiffs should have moved to compel Defendant’s further responses to
their RFA’s. (See Wimberly v. Derby Cycle Corp. (1997) 56 Cal.App.4th
618, 636.) Plaintiffs did not do so, thereby waiving their right to further
responses pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 2033.290(c) and barring their
instant fee request. (See American Federation, 126 Cal.App.4th at 268.) 
Plaintiffs’ reliance on American Federation is
misplaced. In American Federation, “the Local did not simply object to
the nine requests or answer only part of those requests. As noted, after posing
objections, the Local responded by admitting in part and/or denying the
entire request, and so no response was needed.” (American Federation,
126 Cal.App.4th at 268 (emphasis in original).) For example, “[t]he Local
responded that it ‘objects to this request on the ground that it seeks
information beyond the scope of discovery and it is compound. Without waiving
these objections, Local 1902 responds as follows: Deny.’” (American
Federation, 126 Cal.App.4th at 267.) “[T]he Local’s admissions and/or
denials provided complete responses to the requests, thus leaving nothing to
address in a motion to compel.” (American Federation, 126 Cal.App.4th at
269.) 
Here, by contrast, Defendant did not object and then
issue a denial or partial denial—Defendant provided only objections. Plaintiffs
should have filed a motion to compel further, and their failure to do so
prohibits them from recovering under Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.420(a) pursuant to
Code Civil Proc. § 2033.420(b)(1). 
Accordingly, the Court DENIES Plaintiffs’ Motion.
