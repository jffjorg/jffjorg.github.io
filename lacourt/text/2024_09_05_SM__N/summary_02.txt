And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for an order permitting pretrial financial discovery of the defendant's financial condition and profits. The plaintiff sought discovery based on the claim that there is a substantial probability that they will prevail on their claim for punitive damages against the defendant, who was intoxicated at the time of an accident. However, the judge found that the evidence presented did not show aggravating circumstances that would support the imposition of punitive damages. The judge cited several legal precedents, including Taylor v. Superior Court and Dawes v. Superior Court, which held that evidence of intoxication alone is insufficient to support punitive damages. The judge noted that the plaintiff must demonstrate a "substantial probability" of prevailing on their claim, which means that the evidence must show a "very likely" or "strong likelihood" of success. In this case, the evidence presented did not meet this standard, and the motion was denied.
