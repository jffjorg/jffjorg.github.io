And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The City of Santa Monica moves for summary adjudication against defendant Eric Todd Goldie for failure to provide relocation assistance. The City alleges that the property at 2022 Delaware Avenue, Unit 2 was rendered uninhabitable due to flooding remediation work and that the defendant failed to provide temporary tenant relocation benefits despite being ordered to do so by the Santa Monica Code Enforcement. The defendant has failed to oppose the City's motion, and the Court finds that the City has shown that no triable issue of material fact exists as to whether the defendant is liable for failure to pay relocation benefits. The doctrine of collateral estoppel applies to the prior administrative hearing, which found that the defendant owed relocation benefits. Therefore, the Court grants the City's motion for summary adjudication.
