The defendants had previously been served with process, but their counsel failed to respond to the complaint due to attorney error. The plaintiff's counsel did not provide notice to the defendants' counsel before requesting entry of default, which was in violation of rule 1.21 of the California Rules of Court. The judge has deemed the defendants' answer to be filed as of the date of entry of this order.
