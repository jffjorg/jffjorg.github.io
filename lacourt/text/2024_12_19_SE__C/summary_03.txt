And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling is regarding a public nuisance action filed by the City of South Gate against Benjamin De La Cruz. De La Cruz defaulted on October 20, 2023, and a Receiver was appointed to remediate the Subject Property. The Receiver's Application to Authorize and Confirm the Sale of the Property was granted on December 13, 2024, despite De La Cruz not appearing at the hearing. De La Cruz's second noticed Motion to Set Aside Default, which is actually an untimely and disguised Motion for Reconsideration, is scheduled to be heard on August 6, 2025. The judge notes that De La Cruz's default has been entered and not set aside, and therefore, the court lacks jurisdiction to address any action by the defaulted party other than a motion to vacate entry of default. The judge grants De La Cruz's Ex Parte Application to Advance the Hearing Date on the Second Noticed Motion to Set Aside the Default and continues the hearing to January 29, 2025. The request to stay enforcement of the December 13, 2024 Order is denied.
