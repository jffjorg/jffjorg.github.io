 Case Number:  23NWCP00337    Hearing Date:   December 19, 2024    Dept:  C City of South Gate v. Delacruz 23NWCP00337This public nuisance action was filed on August 14, 2023. Respondent Benjamin De La Cruz ("De La Cruz") defaulted on October 20, 2023. A Receiver was appointed on December 15, 2023 to remediate the Subject Property. On December 13, 2024. The Receiver's Application for Issuance of Order Authorizing and Confirming Sale of Receivership Real Property Located at 10325 California Avenue, South Gate, CA 90280 was granted. Despite having received notice of the Receiver's Ex Parte Application to Sell the Property, De La Cruz did not appear. De La Cruz's first noticed Motion to Set Aside Default was denied on the merits on April 17, 2024. On October 16, 2024, De La Cruz filed a second noticed Motion to Set Aside Default, which is scheduled to be heard on August 6, 2025. Since this is De La Cruz's second attempt at moving to set aside his default, the Motion is actually an untimely and disguised Motion for Reconsideration of this Court's April 17, 2024 Order. As of December 13, 2024 (when the Receiver's Ex Parte Application to Authorize and Confirm the Sale of the Property was heard and granted), De La Cruz had not moved ex parte to advance the hearing date on his Motion to Set Aside Default. De La Cruz filed a Notice of Appeal on December 13, 2024. The Court notes that the filing of a Notice of Appeal in this action does not warrant an automatic stay. A stay may be sought by noticed motion, and will only be granted upon the payment of an approved undertaking. On December 16, 2024, this Court denied without prejudice De La Cruz's ex parte application to stay enforcement of this Court's December 13, 2024 Order approving the sale of the real property located at 10325 California Ave., South Gate, CA 90280 pending appeal. "Given that Respondent De La Cruz's is currently in default, the only motion he may property make is to set aside the default. As De La Cruz's default has been entered and not set aside, this Court lacks jurisdiction to address any action by the defaulted party other than a motion to vacate entry of default. (See, e.g. W.A. Rose Co. v. Municipal Court for Oakland-Piedmont Judicial Dist. (1959) 176 Cal.App.2d 67, 72.) “[T]he entry of the default terminates [the defaulting defendant’s] rights to take any further affirmative steps in the litigation until either the default is set aside or a default judgment is entered.” (City of Riverside v. Horspool (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 670, 681.)" (12/16/24 M.O.) Respondent DE LA CRUZ's Ex Parte Application to Advance the Hearing Date on the Second Noticed Motion to Set Aside the Default is GRANTED. The Motion for Reconsideration/Motion to Set Aside Default is ADVANCED from Wednesday, August 6, 2025 to today's date and CONTINUED to Wednesday, January 29, 2025 at 10:30 a.m. in Dept. SE-C. Opposition and Reply to be filed and served per Code in accordance with the new hearing date. The request to stay enforcement of the December 13, 2024 Order is DENIED. "[T]he entry of default terminates [Respondent's] rights to take any further affirmative steps in the litigation until either the default is set aside or a default is entered." (City of Riverside v. Horspool (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 670, 681.)   Moving Party to give notice.
