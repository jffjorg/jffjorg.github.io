And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has tentatively ruled that the defendant's motion to dismiss the action for failure to prosecute is granted. The plaintiff, Mirriam Pantig, filed a lawsuit against the defendant, VXI Global Solutions, LLC, on September 30, 2020, alleging violations of the Labor Code and seeking civil penalties under the Private Attorneys General Act (PAGA). The defendant filed a motion to compel arbitration on April 6, 2023, and the court granted the motion. However, since then, the plaintiff's counsel has been unable to communicate with the plaintiff due to their unknown whereabouts, and the plaintiff has not taken any steps to prosecute the case. The defendant filed a motion to dismiss on December 1, 2023, on the grounds that the action has not been brought to trial or conditionally settled within two years after it was commenced against the defendant. The court has found that the action is more than two years old and has not been brought to trial or conditionally settled in that time. Additionally, the court has found that the plaintiff has abandoned the case. Therefore, the court has tentatively ruled that the defendant's motion to dismiss is granted, and the action is dismissed.
