On September 14, 2021, Plaintiff
Leo Cordova this action against Defendant Long Spring Freight LLC and others.
On
October 6, 2023, Plaintiff served a Notice of Deposition of Defendant’s Person Most
Knowledgeable (“PMK”) and an Amended Second Set of Requests for Admission (“RFAs”)
on Defendant.  (Bressler Decls., Exs. 2.)
On
October 24, 2023, the Court denied Defendant’s counsel’s request to withdraw as
counsel.  Counsel had contended that he was
unable to continue representing Defendant Long Spring because client communication
was no longer possible after the death of Defendant Grace Hui, the manager and sole
client contact for Defendant Long Spring. 
The Court noted that Defendant Long Spring remained active and in good standing
with the Secretary of State, and Jerry Wang was an alternative client contact.
On
October 30, 2023, Notice of Continuance of Deposition of Defendant’s PMK, for a
deposition on December 1, 2023.  (Bressler
MTC Decl. ¶ 10 & Ex. 6.)
On
November 15, 2023, Plaintiff asked Defendant to provide discovery responses no later
than November 22, 2023.  (Bressler RFA Decl.
¶ 8.)
On
November 20, 2023, Defendant’s counsel stated that it was “impossible for us to
respond, because no one has the knowledge to respond to those questions, and no
one is authorized to verify any responses,” despite Jerry Wang’s status as Defendant’s
CEO on Defendant’s November 7, 2023 Statement of Information.  (Bressler RFA Decl. ¶ 9 & Ex. 5; RJN, Ex.
1.)  Defendant’s counsel also indicated that
he was unavailable for the PMK’s December 1 deposition.  (Bressler MTC Decl. ¶ 12 & Ex. 8.)
On
December 4, 2023, Plaintiff filed a motion to compel the deposition of Defendant’s
PMK and a motion to deem RFAs admitted.  Plaintiff’s
requests for judicial notice are granted.
If
a party or an officer, director, managing agent, employee of a party, or person
designated as the person most qualified to testify fails to appear for examination
or produce documents, the demanding party may move to compel attendance, testimony,
and production.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450,
subd. (a).)
When
a party fails to timely respond to a request for admission, the propounding party
may move for an order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any
matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).)  The party who failed to respond waives any objections
to the demand, unless the court grants them relief from the waiver, upon a showing
that the party (1) has subsequently served a substantially compliant response, and
(2) that the party’s failure to respond was the result of mistake, inadvertence,
or excusable neglect.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2033.280, subds. (a)(1)-(2).)  The court shall
grant a motion to deem admitted requests for admissions, “unless it finds that the
party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has served, before the
hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests for admission that is
in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)
Defendant’s
counsel declares that Jerry Wang has already agreed to appear for the PMK deposition,
and he asked Plaintiff’s counsel to propose dates.  (Yang MTC Decl. ¶ 3 & Ex. A.)  Defendant also agreed to provide responses to
the RFAs within 45 days.  (Yang RFA Decl.
¶ 3 & Ex. A.)  This information was conveyed
to Plaintiff via email on December 18, 2023—the same day that Defendant filed its
opposition to the motions.
Contrary
to Defendant’s position, these motions are not yet moot.  (See Oppositions at p. 2.)  Defendant stated only that it would comply, not
that it already has.  It is undisputed that
Defendant’s PMK did not appear for his December 1, 2023 noticed deposition, and
Defendant did not provide responses to the RFAs as of December 22, 2023, when Plaintiff
filed his reply.
Accordingly,
the motions are GRANTED.
Defendant
is ordered to produce its PMK for a deposition within 30 days.
The
Amended Second Set of Requests for Admission is deemed admitted.
The
requests for sanctions are granted in part. 
Defendant is ordered to pay total sanctions of $2,000.00 to Plaintiff within
30 days.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
