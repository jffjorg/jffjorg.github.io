And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling denies the motion for approval of the PAGA settlement without prejudice. The Court requires clarification on two issues: (1) why the plaintiff's release should extend to former and present spouses, and (2) whether a representative enhancement is requested. The Court also notes that the release extends to the plaintiff's former and present spouses and asks for an explanation. The Court finds that the settlement is entitled to a presumption of fairness, and the attorney fees and costs are reasonable. However, the Court requires a fully executed settlement agreement before granting approval. The parties are asked to submit a revised copy of the settlement agreement and to clarify whether a representative enhancement is requested.
