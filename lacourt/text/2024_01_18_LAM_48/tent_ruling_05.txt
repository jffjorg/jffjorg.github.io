BACKGROUND
On November 13, 2023, arbitrator the

(“Petitioner”) and against Respondent Remark Holdings (“Respondent”) in
the amount of $350,000.00 plus pre-judgment interest in the amount of

DISCUSSION
I.                  
Legal Standard 
“Any party to an arbitration award in which
an award has been made may petition the court to confirm, correct, or vacate
the award.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 1285.) “Regardless of the particular relief
granted, any arbitrator’s award is enforceable only when confirmed as a
judgment of the superior court.” (O’Hare v. Municipal Resource Consultants
(2003) 107 Cal.App.4th 267, 278.) “Once a petition to confirm an award is
filed, the superior court must select one of only four courses of action: it
may confirm the award, correct and confirm it, vacate it, or dismiss the
petition.” (EHM Productions, Inc. v. Starline Tours of Hollywood, Inc.
(2018) 21 Cal.App.5th 1058, 1063.) “It is well settled that the scope of
judicial review of arbitration awards is extremely narrow.” (California
Faculty Assn. v. Superior Court (1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 935, 943.) “Neither
the trial court, nor the appellate court, may ‘review the merits of the
dispute, the sufficiency of the evidence, or the arbitrator’s reasoning, nor
may we correct or review an award because of an arbitrator’s legal or factual
error, even if it appears on the award’s face.” (EHM Productions, supra,
at p. 1063-64.)
A.   
Filing Requirements (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 1285.4) satisfied 
Code of Civil Procedure, section 1285.4
states: “A petition under this chapter shall: (a) Set forth the substance of or
have attached a copy of the agreement to arbitrate unless the petitioner denies
the existence of the agreement. (b) Set forth the names of the arbitrators. (c)
Set forth or have attached a copy of the award and the written opinion of the
arbitrators, if any.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 1285.4.) “A response to a petition
under this chapter may request the court to dismiss the petition or to confirm,
correct or vacate the award.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 1285.2.)
Here, Petitioner has satisfied the
requirements of CCP section 1285.4 by setting forth the substance of the
parties’ agreement to arbitrate the Petition. 
Petitioner provides the Court with a copy of the Sponsorship Agreement
between the parties which includes the relevant arbitration agreement.
Petitioner sets forth the Arbitrator’s name, Honorable David A. Thompson, Ret.
and attaches a copy of the Award in Petitioner’s favor, which is signed and
dated. 
B.    
Service of the Petition and Notice of
Hearing (Code Civ. Proc. § 1290.4) satisfied 
Code of Civil Procedure, section 1290.4
states, in relevant part: 
“(a) A copy of the petition and a written
notice of the time and place of the hearing thereof and any other papers upon
which the petition is based shall be served in the manner provided in the
arbitration agreement for the service of such petition and notice. ” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1290.4, subd. (a).)
Here, the Petition and notice of hearing
were served by mail, postage prepaid, on Respondent in accordance with the
Sponsorship Agreement. 
C.   
Service of the Arbitration Award
& Timeliness of Petition (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 1283.6, 1288, 1288.4) not
satisfied
Code of Civil Procedure section 1283.6
provides that, “The neutral arbitrator shall serve a signed copy of the award
on each party to the arbitration personally or by registered or certified mail
or as provided in the agreement.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1283.6.) Proof of service
must be filed with the clerk of court along with the arbitration award within
10 days after the arbitration hearing. (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.825, subd. (b)(1).)
The arbitrator may use the Form LAADR-014 for this purpose. (LASC, Local Rule
3.301, subd. (a).) Additionally, a party may seek a court judgment confirming
an arbitration award by filing and serving a petition no more than four years,
but not less than 10 days, after the award is served on the petitioner. (Code
Civ. Proc., §§ 1288, 1288.4.)
While the Award provides “[t]he Case
Manager shall serve this Final Award on the parties,” the Award does not
include a proof of service or any other indication demonstrating the Arbitrator
properly served a copy of the Award on the parties.  Thus, Petitioner has not satisfied the
requirements of Section 1283.6. 
CONCLUSION
Accordingly, the Petition to Confirm
the Arbitration Award is DENIED. Petitioner must submit Proof of Service of the
Arbitration Award.  
Moving party to give notice. 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org indicating
intention to submit.  If all parties in the case submit on the tentative
ruling, no appearances before the Court are required unless a companion hearing
(for example, a Case Management Conference) is also on calendar.
