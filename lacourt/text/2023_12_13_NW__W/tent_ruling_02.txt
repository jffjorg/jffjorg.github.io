BACKGROUND
 
This
wage and hour dispute went to trial on July 31, 2023 and resulted in a verdict
in favor of plaintiff on all causes of action. 
Judgment was entered in plaintiff’s favor on October 10, 2023 in the
amount of $131,896.  Plaintiff now seeks
attorney fees and costs as the prevailing party pursuant to Labor Code Section
218.5, in the amount of $48,600 and $1327 respectively.    
 
[TENTATIVE]
RULING:
 
Defendants’ Motion for an Award of Attorney Fees and
Costs is GRANTED. 
 
DISCUSSION
 
Plaintiff moves the court for reasonable attorney fees
against defendants AAA Tax Consultants, Inc., aka Nationwide Tax, Classing
Consulting, Inc. and Joseph Boodaie, jointly and severally, under Labor Code
Section 218.5, which mandates an attorney fee award “[i]n any action brought
for the nonpayment of wages,” if any party requests them at the initiation of
the action. (§ 218.5, subd. (a).)  In the
instant case, plaintiff requested attorneys’ fees and costs in the initial
Complaint.  
 
The Court judgment awarded damages for 1) Unpaid Wages
and Overtime, 2) Missed Meal
and Rest Breaks, 3) Improper Visa Reimbursement, 4)
Waiting Time, and 5) Inaccurate Wage Statement Penalties.  Having prevailed on these claims, each of
which are based on non-payment of wages, plaintiff is entitled to recover
attorney fees under Section 218.5.  
 
Attorneys are entitled to compensation at hourly rates
that reflect the market
value of their services in the community. (PLCM Group,
Inc. v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal. 4th 1084, 1095 (“The reasonable hourly rate is
that prevailing in the community for similar work.”)  Here, plaintiff’s trial counsel, Michael
Short, charges $500 per hour, as does his partner, Mark Fang.  The court finds that based on their
experience, as described in the declaration of Mr. Short, as well as the
excellence of their written submissions, and Mr. Short’s extremely organized, cogent
and efficient presentation at trial, that their hourly rate is fully justified
and commensurate with attorneys of similar experience and skill in the local
legal community.   
 
The court has reviewed the billing records submitted
by Mr. Short and finds that all the work reported was reasonably performed and
necessary to the litigation of this case. 
The court finds no evidence of excessive, double billing or block billing.  Plaintiff’s counsel has fully established the
reasonableness of the hours worked to litigate this case through trial,
especially given the various delays engineered by defendant.  
 
Finally, the court has reviewed the costs submitted
and agrees that all of the costs are properly recoverable under Section 218.5.
 
Accordingly, the court grants plaintiff’s request for
attorneys’ fees in the total amount of $48,600 and costs in the amount of
$1327.
