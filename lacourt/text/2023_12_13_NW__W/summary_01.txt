And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the defendants, Regal Medical Group, Inc., et al., granting their motions for summary judgment and summary adjudication. The judge found that the defendants met their burden of showing that they did not breach the standard of care or cause the plaintiffs' injuries. The judge also found that the plaintiffs failed to present contrary expert evidence to raise a triable issue of fact.

The judge's ruling is based on the declarations of the defendants' expert witnesses, including Shahryar Ahmadi, M.D., David Barcay, M.D., and William Brien, M.D. These experts testified that the defendants complied with the standard of care and did not cause the plaintiffs' injuries.

The judge also noted that the plaintiffs failed to present any contrary expert evidence to raise a triable issue of fact. Therefore, the judge concluded that the defendants are entitled to summary judgment and summary adjudication.
