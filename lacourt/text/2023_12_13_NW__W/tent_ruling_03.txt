BACKGROUND
 
On December 20, 2022, Plaintiffs Alliant Capital LTD
and ADC Communities II, LLC filed a complaint against Defendants Santoro
Holdings LLC, Black Swan Properties, LLC, Craig Thomas individually and as
trustee of the Carpe Vitam Revocable Trust dated July 13, 2017, Caroline Smith
individually and as trustee of the CS Administrative Trust under the Santoro
Family Trust dated September 29, 2010 for declaratory relief. Plaintiffs allege
they have been forced to bring this action for declaratory relief because, following
the death of Christopher Santoro (“Santoro”), with whom Plaintiffs developed
several substantial multi-family rental projects, the trustees of the trusts
that Plaintiffs understand hold Santoro’s interests have failed and refused,
despite multiple requests over an eight-month period, to provide Plaintiffs
with information demonstrating which of them is entitled to receive
distributions in connection with each of the subject properties.

DISCUSSION
 
I.                   
PLAINTIFFS’
MOTION TO: (1) COMPEL DEFENDANT CAROLINE SMITH’S FURTHER RESPONSES TO
PLAINTIFFS’ REQUESTS FOR PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS; (2) COMPEL PRODUCTION OF
DOCUMENTS; AND (3) IMPOSE MONETARY SANCTIONS AGAINST CAROLINE SMITH AND HER
COUNSEL
 
Plaintiffs move the court for an order: (1) compelling
Defendant Caroline Smith, individually and as trustee of the CS Administrative
Trust under the Santoro Family Trust dated September 29, 2010 to serve further,
verified written responses to Plaintiffs’ First and Second Sets of Requests for
Production of Documents, (2) compelling Smith’s full production of documents;
and (3) imposing monetary sanctions.

A motion to compel further responses to a demand for
inspection or production of documents (“RFP”) may be brought based on: (1)
incomplete statements of compliance; (2) inadequate, evasive or incomplete
claims of inability to comply; or (3) unmerited or overly generalized
objections.  (CCP § 2031.310(c).) Notice
of the motions must be given within 45 days of service of the verified
response, otherwise, the propounding party waives any right to compel a further
response. (CCP § 2030.300(c); CCP § 2031.310(c).) The motions must also be
accompanied by a meet and confer declaration. (CCP § 2030.300(b); CCP §
2031.310(b).)¿¿¿¿ 
 
Plaintiffs argue Smith’s responses are evasive and
incomplete. Plaintiffs’ contend Smith’s responses to Plaintiff's Requests for production
are all identical and state:
 
Responding
Party will produce those documents currently in her possession, custody or
control that evidence, memorialize, reflect, reference, concern, and/or relate
to Responding Party’s interests… (Biz Decl., Exh. D.) 
 
However, Smith failed to produce any of the documents
requested and did not state whether such documents even existed. The court
finds there is good cause warranting the discovery sought by the demand.
Plaintiffs contend the documents relate directly to key issues in this matter,
and simply seek the production of documents and information bearing on the
trusts’ or other entities’ — which set up by Santoro before his death —
ownership interests in any of the multi-family projects in which Santoro had
invested jointly with Plaintiffs. Defendant has failed to provide the requested
documents. 
 
Accordingly, Plaintiffs’ Motion to Compel Further
Responses to Plaintiffs’ Request for Production of Documents, Set One and Two
is GRANTED. Defendants are ordered to produce further discovery responses and
documents in fourteen days.
 
Sanctions
 
Where the court grants a motion to compel further
responses, sanctions shall be imposed against the party who unsuccessfully
makes or opposes a motion to compel, unless the party acted with substantial
justification or the sanction would otherwise be unjust.  (CCP §§ 2031.310(h), 2030.300(d).)   
 
Plaintiffs seek $4,182.75 in sanctions against Smith
and her attorney, jointly and severally, on the grounds Smith and her counsel
provided evasive responses. Plaintiffs’ counsel contends Smith made no effort
in response to Plaintiffs’ meet and confer attempts to justify her defective
responses. (Biz Decl. ¶13.) As a result, Plaintiffs seek $4,182.75 for six
hours preparing the motion at counsel’s hourly rate at $472.50 and .5 hours for
the motion to be reviewed by Partner Michael Cypers as his hourly rate of
$805.50. (Biz Decl. ¶14.) Counsel anticipates another two hours to draft a
reply and two hours attending the hearing on the matter. (Biz Decl. ¶15.) 
 
The court GRANTS Plaintiffs’ request for monetary
sanctions in the reduced amount of $2,835.00. No opposition has been filed. The court finds
only one hour necessary for attending the hearing on both motions.
 
II.                 
PLAINTIFF’S MOTION
TO COMPEL COMPLIANCE WITH COURT ORDERED SANCTIONS AGAINST MARC H. RICHARDS AND
MARC H. RICHARDS, APC AND FOR FURTHER SANCTIONS AND A CONTEMPT FINDING
 
Plaintiff moves the Court for: (a) an order compelling
compliance with the Court Order dated September 12, 2023 requiring Marc H.
Richards and Marc H. Richards, APC (together, “Richards”) to pay monetary
sanctions; (b) a finding of violation of a court order compelling discovery
pursuant to Code Civ. Proc. § 2023.010 et seq.; (c) the Court on its own motion
to find Richards in contempt of court order; and (d) an order directing
Richards to pay additional monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,347.75, for
requiring Plaintiffs to seek this relief.
 
If a party fails to obey an order compelling responses
to production requests, the court may make those orders that are just,
including the imposition of an issue sanction, evidence sanction, or
terminating sanction, and/or monetary sanctions, under Chapter 7 of the
Discovery Act, i.e., sections 2023.010 to 2023.050 of the Code of Civil
Procedure. (CCP § 2031.300(c).) However, numerous cases hold that severe
sanctions (i.e., terminating or evidentiary sanctions) for failure to comply
with a court order are allowed only where the failure was willful. (See R.S.
Creative, Inc. v. Creative Cotton, Ltd. (1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 486, 495; Vallbona
v. Springer (1996) 43 Cal.App.4th 1525, 1545; Biles v. Exxon Mobil Corp.
(2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1327.) The “[d]isobedience of any lawful
judgment, order, or process of the court” constitutes contempt. (CCP § 1209,
subd. (a)(5).) When contempt is committed outside the presence of the Court, a
proceeding is commenced by the filing of an affidavit charging the facts constituting
contempt. (CCP § 1211.) The factual predicates to a finding of contempt are:
(1) the rendition of a valid order, (2) actual knowledge of the order, (3)
ability to comply, and (4) willful disobedience. (Conn v. Sup. Ct.
(1987) 196 Cal.App.3d 774, 784.) If the judicial officer finds that the
affidavit charges facts sufficient to constitute contempt, an order to show
cause may be issued. (CCP § 1212; In re Koehler (2010) 181 Cal.App.4th
1153, 1169.) 
 
Plaintiff makes the motion on the grounds that on
September 12, 2023, the Court issued an order for monetary sanctions for abuse
of the discovery process against Defendant Caroline Smith, individually and as
trustee of the CS Administrative Trust under the Santoro Family Trust dated
September 29, 2010 (“Smith”) and her attorney Richards, in the sum of
$4,725.00. Richards agreed to pay the sanctions on behalf of Smith. (Biz Decl.
¶5.) As of this date, Plaintiffs have not received the payment, and Richards has
refused to return all attempts at communications on this or any other matter
related to this case. (Biz Decl. ¶13.) 
 
The court agrees Marc H. Richards and Marc H.
Richards, APC has not complied with the court order and orders compliance with
the September 12, 2023 Order. Moreover, the court finds additional monetary
sanctions warranted. Plaintiff has followed up several times with Richards with
no response. 
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s motion to compel compliance
with the September 12, 2023 Order is GRANTED. Richards is also ordered to pay
Plaintiffs additional monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,347.75. 
 
The court declines to set an OSC re Contempt as it
does not believe threat of incarceration is an appropriate sanction for failure
to pay a debt, even if it is in the form of a court order to pay sanctions.
