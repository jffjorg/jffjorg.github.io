And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion for an award of attorney fees and costs. The plaintiff, Bernard Michael, had requested attorney fees and costs as the prevailing party in a wage and hour dispute that went to trial and resulted in a verdict in his favor. The judge found that the plaintiff is entitled to recover attorney fees under Labor Code Section 218.5, as he requested fees and costs in the initial Complaint and prevailed on claims related to non-payment of wages. The judge also found that the hourly rate charged by the plaintiff's trial counsel, Michael Short, was fully justified and commensurate with attorneys of similar experience and skill in the local legal community. The court granted the plaintiff's request for attorney fees in the total amount of $48,600 and costs in the amount of $1,327.
