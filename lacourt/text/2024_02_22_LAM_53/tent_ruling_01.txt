considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers filed in connection with
this motion. 
REQUEST FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE
The court grants defendant Nissan North America, Inc.’s request for
judicial notice.  (Evid. Code,
§ 452, subd. (d).)
EVIDENTIARY OBJECTIONS
The court rules on defendant Nissan North America, Inc.’s evidentiary
objections, filed on December 7, 2023, as follows:
Objections Nos. 1-4 are overruled. 
 
 
DISCUSSION

Plaintiff Matthew Guerra (“Plaintiff”) moves the court for an order
compelling defendant Nissan North America, Inc. (“Defendant”) to provide
further responses to Plaintiff’s Requests for Production of Documents, Set One,
numbers 1, 8, 9, 17-20, 24-26, 41, 43, and 54-56.
The court notes that, in its opposition, Defendant (1) has presented
evidence showing that it served supplemental responses to Requests for
Production of Documents, numbers 1, 8, 9, 41, 43, 54, and 55 on December 4,
2023, and (2) has asserted that it produced to Plaintiff approximately 700
pages of responsive documents on that date. 
(Salas Decl., ¶ 7; Salas Decl., Ex. 3 [Def. Supp. Responses served
December 4, 2023].)  The court exercises
its discretion to review the supplemental responses to those demands in ruling
on this motion.  (Sinaiko Healthcare
Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th
390, 409 [“Whether a particular response does resolve satisfactorily the issues
raised by a motion is a matter best determined by the trial court in the
exercise of its discretion, based on the circumstances of the case”].) 
The court denies Plaintiff’s motion to compel Defendant’s further
responses to Requests for Production of Documents, numbers 1, 8, 9, 41, and 43 because
the supplemental responses to those demands include statements of compliance
that are complete.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.310, subd. (a)(1); Salas Decl., Ex. 3, pp. 2:24-26, 4:17-26, 6:20-7:14, 8:6-10,
9:3-11.)
            The court grants Plaintiff’s motion
to compel Defendant’s further responses to Requests for Production of
Documents, numbers 17 and 56 because the objections in the responses to those
demands are without merit.  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (a)(3).)
The court grants Plaintiff’s motion to compel Defendant’s further
responses to Requests for Production of Documents, numbers 18-19 and 24-26,
limited to documents constituting any internal analysis or investigation
regarding defects alleged in Plaintiff’s Complaint in vehicles for the same
year, make, and model of the subject vehicle. 
This includes Recall Notices and Technical Service Bulletins.  Defendant is not required to do a search of
or to produce emails. 
The court grants Plaintiff’s motion to compel Defendant’s further
response to Requests for Production of Documents, number 20, limited to
documents constituting customer complaints relating to defects alleged in
Plaintiff’s Complaint in vehicles purchased in California for the same year,
make, and model of the subject vehicle.
The court grants Plaintiff’s motion to compel Defendant’s further
responses to Requests for Production of Documents, numbers 54-55, because (1)
the statements of compliance in the supplemental responses to those demands are
incomplete, and (2) the objections in the responses to those demands are
without merit.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.310, subd. (a)(1), (a)(3); Salas Decl., Ex. 3, pp. 10:2-16, 11:18-23.)  
ORDER
            The court grants in part
plaintiff Matthew Guerra’s motion to compel further responses to requests for
production of documents as follows. 
            Pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 2031.310, the court orders defendant Nissan North America,
Inc. (1) to serve on plaintiff Matthew Guerra further written responses to plaintiff
Matthew Guerra’s Requests for Production of Documents, numbers 17, 18-20,
24-26, and 54-56, and (2) to produce to plaintiff Matthew Guerra (i) all
documents and things in defendant Nissan North America, Inc.’s possession,
custody, or control which are responsive to Requests for Production of
Documents, numbers 17 and 54-56, (ii) documents constituting any internal
analysis or investigation regarding defects alleged in plaintiff Matthew
Guerra’s Complaint in vehicles for the same year, make, and model of the
subject vehicle, including Recall Notices and Technical Service Bulletins but
excluding emails, that are in defendant Nissan North America, Inc.’s
possession, custody, or control, in response to Requests for Production of
Documents numbers 18-19 and 24-26, and (iii) documents constituting customer
complaints relating to defects alleged in plaintiff Matthew Guerra’s Complaint
in vehicles purchased in California for the same year, make, and model of the
subject vehicle, that are in defendant Nissan North America, Inc.’s possession,
custody, or control, in response to Requests for Production of Documents,
number 20, within 20 days of the date of this order. 
            
 
 
 
The court orders plaintiff Matthew Guerra to give notice of this
ruling. 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
