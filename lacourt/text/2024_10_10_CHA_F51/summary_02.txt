And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling is that the demurrer filed by Toque Nuevo Beauty, LLC (Moving Defendant) against Nadia Samir (Plaintiff) is sustained. The demurrer was filed on June 11, 2024, and is based on the argument that the Plaintiff's complaint fails to allege facts sufficient to state a cause of action for Negligence and Premises Liability. The Court finds that the Plaintiff's complaint lacks specific details about the dangerous condition on the premises and the manner in which Moving Defendant breached its duty of care. Therefore, the Court sustains the demurrer as to both causes of action. However, the Court grants the Plaintiff 30 days leave to amend the complaint to cure the defects set forth above.
