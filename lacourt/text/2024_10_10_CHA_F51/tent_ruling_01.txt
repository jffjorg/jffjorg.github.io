MOVING
PARTY: Plaintiff
Michael Brang (“Plaintiff”)¿
RESPONDING
PARTY: Defendant
General Motors, LLC (“Defendant”)¿ 
NOTICE: NOT OK (identifies the motion
as a motion to compel initial responses, but substantively treats the
motion as a motion to compel further responses.)
 
RELIEF
REQUESTED: An
order compelling Defendant’s further responses to Plaintiff’s Requests for
Production of Documents (“RFPs”), Set Two, Nos. 27–50.
 
TENTATIVE
RULING: The motion is continued to January 14, 2025. The parties’
counsel are ordered to meet and further confer either telephonically or
in-person within 60 days, to resolve and/or narrow all outstanding discovery
issues. Plaintiff’s counsel is to file a declaration with the Court which
confirms compliance with this order or explains why no meaningful meet and
confer occurred.
 
BACKGROUND
 
Plaintiff brings this action against Defendant under the
Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act (Civil Code § 1790 et seq.) for a vehicle he
purchased on 12/2/20, and for which Defendant issued the manufacturer’s
warranty. (Compl. ¶¶ 4, 8.)
 
On 7/6/22, Plaintiff filed his complaint, alleging against
Defendant the following causes of action: (1) Violation of the Song-Beverly Act
– Breach of Express Warranty; (2) Violation of the Song-Beverly Act – Breach of
Implied Warranty; and (3) Violation of the Song-Beverly Act Section 1793.2(b).
On 8/5/22, Defendant filed its answer.
 
On 2/28/24, Plaintiff served his second set of RFPs on Defendant.
(Decl. of Sepehr Daghighian ¶ 9.) On 5/28/24, Defendant served its responses
thereto. (Id. at ¶ 12.)
 
On 6/18/24, Plaintiff filed the instant motion to compel further
responses to the subject RFPs. On 9/30/24, Defendant filed its opposition
thereto. On 10/3/24, Plaintiff filed his reply.
 
 
MEET AND CONFER
 
A motion to compel further
discovery responses must be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration stating “facts showing a reasonable and good faith attempt at an
informal resolution of each issue presented by the motion.” (Code Civ. Proc. §§
2031.310, subd. (b)(2); 2016.040.) 
 
Here, Plaintiff’s
counsel declares that on 5/1/24 and 5/9/24, he sent Defendant’s counsel
meet-and-confer letters raising the issues discussed herein. (Daghighian Decl. ¶¶ 13–14.)
On 5/10/24, Defendant’s counsel responded, standing by Defendant’s objections.
(Id. at ¶ 15.)
 
In
opposition, Defendant purportedly offers “to supplement its responses
without objections and provide documents for Set Two RFP Nos. 27-50, which is
every request listed in Plaintiff’s Motion, with GM to provide those responses
and documents within 40 days, by November 5, 2024. Based on the following
offering, it is GM’s position that Plaintiff’s Motion is moot and should be
denied or continued.” (Decl. of Cameron Major ¶ 7.)
 
Based on
the foregoing, the Court orders counsel for the parties to meet and
further confer either telephonically or in-person within 60 days, to resolve
and/or narrow all outstanding discovery issues, including any issues with
Defendant’s supplemental objection-free responses. Plaintiff’s counsel is to
file a declaration with the Court which confirms compliance with this order or
explains why no meaningful meet and confer occurred. The motions are therefore
continued pending further meet and confer.
 
CONCLUSION
 
The motion is continued to January
14, 2025. The parties’ counsel are ordered to meet and further confer either
telephonically or in-person within 60 days, to resolve and/or narrow all
outstanding discovery issues. Plaintiff’s counsel is to file a declaration with
the Court which confirms compliance with this order or explains why no
meaningful meet and confer occurred.
