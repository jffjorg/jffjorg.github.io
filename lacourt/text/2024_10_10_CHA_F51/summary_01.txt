And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Michael Brang v. General Motors, LLC (Case No. 22CHCV00494). The case revolves around a vehicle purchased on December 2, 2020, and a subsequent complaint filed by Brang against General Motors, alleging violations of the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act. The complaint includes three causes of action: breach of express warranty, breach of implied warranty, and breach of Section 1793.2(b) of the Song-Beverly Act.

The Judge has ordered the parties to meet and further confer within 60 days to resolve and/or narrow all outstanding discovery issues, including any issues with General Motors' supplemental objection-free responses. The Judge has also ordered Brang's counsel to file a declaration with the Court confirming compliance with this order or explaining why no meaningful meet and confer occurred.

The motion to compel further responses to the Requests for Production of Documents (RFPs) is continued to January 14, 2025. The Judge has not yet made a final ruling on the motion.
