And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the defendant's motion to compel the plaintiff's response to special interrogatories, set one, and awards monetary sanctions against the plaintiff and her counsel. The defendant served the interrogatories on July 21, 2023, and the plaintiff failed to respond within the granted extensions. The Judge finds that the motion to compel is granted since no responses have been served. The Judge also grants the defendant's request for sanctions in the reduced amount of $324.15, which represents 1.5 hours of attorney time plus a filing fee. The plaintiff is ordered to serve properly verified responses to the special interrogatories within 15 days, and the defendant is ordered to provide notice and file a proof of service of the sanctions within 30 days.
