```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants a continuance for jurisdictional discovery and sets a new hearing date of December 29, 2023. The judge also grants the motion to quash service of summons as to EcoSoft WaterSystems, but denies it as to EcoSoft SPC. The judge finds that EcoSoft SPC has not established that service was not properly rendered, but notes that additional jurisdictional discovery may be necessary to determine whether the court has personal jurisdiction over EcoSoft SPC and EcoSoft WaterSystems. The judge also orders the parties to file supplemental briefing on the issues of personal jurisdiction and jurisdictional discovery.
