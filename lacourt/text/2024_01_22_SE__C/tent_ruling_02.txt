 Case Number:  22STCV29276    Hearing Date:   January 22, 2024    Dept:  C Ani Khachikyan, et al. vs Platinum Transportation
Group, Inc. Case No. 22STCV29276
This is a personal injury action resulting from a motor
vehicle accident of a passenger van. Plaintiff Ani Khachikyan files this ex
parte application for an order affirming and enforcing a previous order that
Defendants’ representatives appear for deposition; and an order shortening time
for Plaintiff’s Motion for Evidentiary, Issue and Monetary Sanctions for
Disobedience of a Court Order. 
 
Defense counsel has included evidence that he was sick and
that there was no other attorney who could take the deposition. On December 19,
2023, Defense counsel attempted to defer all the scheduled depositions due to
his health.  Three depositions took place as scheduled on January 12-13
and 15, 2024. Another deposition was scheduled to take place on Tuesday,
January 16, however Defense counsel’s health worsened.  On January 18,
2024, Defense counsel applied ex parte to continue trial in Dept. F. 
Trial was continued from February 23, 2024 to March 11, 2024 due to Defense
Counsel’s illness.  
 
“An application must make an affirmative factual showing in
a declaration containing competent testimony based on personal knowledge of
irreparable harm, immediate danger, or any other statutory basis for granting
ex parte relief.” (California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1202(c).)  Here, the
Court finds that there is no immediate danger because a trial continuance has
already been granted to allow discovery to take place. 
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s Ex Parte Applications are DENIED. 
 
Plaintiff to give notice.
