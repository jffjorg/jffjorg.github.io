And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the Plaintiff's ex parte application to affirm and enforce a previous order requiring the defendant's representatives to appear for deposition, and to shorten the time for the Plaintiff's Motion for Evidentiary, Issue and Monetary Sanctions for Disobedience of a Court Order.

The Plaintiff, Ani Khachikyan, sought to enforce the previous order for deposition and to expedite the sanctions motion due to the defendant's failure to comply with the court's order. However, the Judge found that the defense counsel's illness did not constitute an immediate danger, as a trial continuance had already been granted to allow for further discovery.

The Judge cited California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1202(c), which requires an affirmative factual showing in a declaration containing competent testimony based on personal knowledge of irreparable harm, immediate danger, or any other statutory basis for granting ex parte relief. The Judge found that the Plaintiff's application did not meet this standard.

The Judge ordered that the Plaintiff give notice of the denial of the application.
