  Case Number:  22NWCV01237    Hearing Date:   January 22, 2024    Dept:  C Maria Ramirez vs Ford Motor Company, et al., Case No.
22NWCV01237
This is a lemon law action. On November 7, 2022, Plaintiff
Maria Ramirez filed a Complaint against Ford Motor Company (“Ford”) alleging
breach of express warranty under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act (“Act”)
and against Cerritos Ford Inc. DBA Norm Reeves Ford Superstore/Norm Reeves
Lincoln (“Cerritos Ford”) for negligent repair.
 
On June 16, 2023, Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint
(FAC). On or about July 25, 2023, Defendants filed a Demurrer to Plaintiff’s
FAC. Defendants essentially argued that Plaintiff failed to cure the defects in
their FAC. The hearing was scheduled for November 9, 2023. The Court issued a
tentative ruling on November 8, 2023, granting Defendants’ Demurrer on both
causes of action but provided Plaintiff with 15 days leave to amend. After
hearing arguments from the parties, the Court adopted its tentative ruling.
Defendants served a notice of ruling on November 10, 2023. (Exhibit “B”; Lally
Decl.¿ 3). 
 
As of January 18, 2024, Defendants have not received
Plaintiff’s Second Amended. (Lally Decl.¿
3). The trial in this case is scheduled for May 21, 2024. Defendants’ deadline
to file a Motion for Summary Judgment is January 30, 2024. (Lally Decl.¿ 3). There currently is no
operative complaint and Defendants’ deadline to file a Motion for Summary
Judgment is less than two weeks away.
 
“A motion to dismiss an entire action and for entry of
judgment after expiration of the time to amend the following the sustaining of
a demurrer may be made by ex parte application to the Court under Code of Civil
Procedure section 581(f)(2).” (California Rules of Court, rule 3.1320.) “Except
where Section 597 applies, after a demurrer to the Complaint is sustained with
leave to amend, the Plaintiff fails to amend it within the time allowed by the
Court and either party moves for a dismissal.” (CCP § 518(f)(2).) 
 
However, the Court is empowered to relieve a party “upon any
terms as may be just . . . from a judgment, dismissal, order, or other
proceeding taken against him or her through his or her mistake, inadvertence,
surprise, or excusable neglect.” (CCP § 473(b).) Relief is mandatory when it is
based on an “attorney affidavit of fault,” and discretionary when based on
declarations or other evidence showing “mistake, inadvertence, surprise or
excusable neglect.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b).) Errors made by an
attorney’s staff are attributed to and deemed the “fault” of the attorney for
purposes of entitlement to CCP 473(b) relief from mistake. (Hu v. Fang
(2002) 104 Cal.App.4th 61, 64-65.)
 
Here, counsel submits a declaration stating that in relying
on their staff to properly calendar deadlines including any Court imposed
deadline to file an amended complaint, Plaintiff’s counsel failed to ensure
that the amended pleading was filed on time. (Lopez Decl., ¶ 2.) Under the
provisions of CCP § 473(b), relief is mandatory.  However, Plaintiff has
failed attach a copy of the Second Amended Complaint to her Opposition. 
“Application for this relief shall be accompanied by a copy of the answer or
other pleading proposed to be filed therein, otherwise the application shall
not be granted….” (emphasis added.) (CCP §473(b).) 
 
 
Accordingly, Defendants’ Ex Parte Application is CONTINUED
to January 24, 2024 at 830 a.m. in Dept. SE-C.  Plaintiff is
ordered to file and serve his Second Amended Complaint no later than 5 p.m. on
January 23, 2024.  
 
Defendant to give notice.
