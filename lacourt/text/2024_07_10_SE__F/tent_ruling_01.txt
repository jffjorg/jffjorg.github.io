  Case Number:  24NWCV01039    Hearing Date:   July 10, 2024    Dept:  F 24NWCV01039 Motion for Trial PreferencePlaintiffs move for trial preference. 
Code of Civil Procedure section 36, subdivision (a) provides, as
follows: “A party to a civil action who is over 70 years of age may petition
the court for a preference, which the court shall grant if the court makes both
of the following findings: (1) the party has a substantial interest in the
action as a whole; and (2) the health of the party is such that a
preference is necessary to prevent prejudicing the party’s interest in the
litigation.”
Code of Civil Procedure section 36.5 provides that “An affidavit
submitted in support of a motion for preference under [C.C.P. §36(a)] may be
signed by the attorney for the party seeking preference based upon information
and belief as to the medical diagnosis and prognosis of any party. The
affidavit is not admissible for any purpose other than a motion for preference
under [C.C.P. §36(a)].”
 Seventy-five-year-old Claude Mashburn has established he has a
substantial interest in the action because he is the Plaintiff in this action.
In addition, Plaintiffs’ counsel has submitted an affidavit stating his medical
diagnosis and prognosis: diabetes
mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia, anemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease, chronic kidney disease stage 3, cardiomyopathy, acute on chronic
systolic heart failure, mitral valve insufficiency, atherosclerosis of aorta,
secondary hypercoagulable state, secondary hyperaldosteronism, permanent atrial
fibrillation, a history of stroke and open-heart surgery,  and a
compression fracture of the T12 thoracic vertebra. (Decl. Pinkney, ¶¶ 6, 7.)
 Based
on the above, the Court grants trial preference.
