Plaintiff’s
motion for summary judgment is GRANTED. 
 
            On

Grace Togo, alleging: (1) failure to pay minimum wage; (2) unpaid overtime; (3)
unpaid meal period premiums; (4) unpaid rest period premiums; (5) waiting time
penalties; (6) non-compliant wage statements; (7) failure to reimburse business
expenses; and (8) violation of Business and Professions Code section 17200. 
 
            Now,
Plaintiff moves for summary judgment of the Complaint. 
 
            The
motion is unopposed. 
 
Discussion 
 
Plaintiff
argues that she is entitled to summary judgment because Defendant has admitted
to the following:
 
-        
Plaintiff was employed by Defendant
from July 7, 2020 to January 31, 2022;
-        
Plaintiff was a non-exempt employee;
-        
Plaintiff worked from 4:30 a.m. to 2:30
p.m. (10 hours/day) Monday through Friday;
-        
Plaintiff was paid a fixed day rate of
$128.00 ($16.00 x 8 hours);
-        
Plaintiff was paid an hourly rate of
$16.00;
-        
Plaintiff was not paid overtime for
hours worked beyond 8 hours per day;
-        
Plaintiff was not paid overtime for
hours worked beyond 40 hours per week;
-        
Plaintiff was not paid 2 hours of
overtime each day he worked;
-        
Plaintiff did not receive uninterrupted
rest periods;
-        
Plaintiff did not receive his
uninterrupted meal periods;
-        
Plaintiff drove between 400 - 500 miles
per day;
-        
Plaintiff drove his own car to make
deliveries;
-        
Plaintiff did not receive mileage
reimbursements for driving; and
-        
Plaintiff did not receive wage
statements.
 
(See SS
¶¶ 1- 22.) 
 
Plaintiff’s
evidence supports a reasonable inference that Defendant failed to pay minimum
wage, failed to pay owed overtime, failed to pay meal and rest period premiums,
failed to issue wage statements, and failed to reimburse business expenses.
Accordingly, the burden shifts to Defendant to disclose a triable issue of
material fact. 
 
Defendant
failed to oppose this motion and thus has not met the burden of proof to
disclose a triable issue of material fact.
 
Based on the
foregoing, Plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment is granted. 
 
 
It is so ordered.
