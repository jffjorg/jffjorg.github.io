The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment. The plaintiff, Junny Kim, alleges that the defendant, Young Hee Lee dba GRACE TOGO, failed to pay minimum wage, overtime, meal and rest period premiums, and reimburse business expenses. The defendant failed to oppose the motion, and the plaintiff's evidence supports a reasonable inference that the defendant failed to comply with labor laws. As a result, the burden shifts to the defendant to disclose a triable issue of material fact, which the defendant failed to do. The judge has ordered the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment granted. The parties are advised to submit on the tentative by email or appear via L.A. Court Connect, and the court will adopt the tentative as the final order if all parties submit or if there are no appearances at the hearing.
