```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge denies the plaintiff's motion for additional discovery. The judge finds that the plaintiff cannot establish a basis for relief under California Code of Civil Procedure Section 2024.050, which allows for the completion of discovery proceedings closer to the initial trial date. The judge concludes that the plaintiff's counsel has displayed a lack of diligence in obtaining expert discovery, complying with defendant's requests for discovery, and seeking relief from his failure to cooperate. The judge also finds that the defendant will be severely prejudiced if the court reopens expert discovery, as they have planned their trial strategy based on the discovery deadlines that were previously set.
