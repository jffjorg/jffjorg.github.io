And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted defendant Walmart Inc.'s motion for summary judgment on plaintiff Sajjad Takallou's complaint for damages. The judge found that the defendant has met its burden of showing that there are no triable issues of material fact, and that the plaintiff cannot reasonably obtain evidence to support his claim.

The plaintiff alleged that he was walking down a shopping aisle at a Walmart location when an employee hit him with a cart, causing him to fall into a clothing rack. However, the defendant presented evidence contradicting the plaintiff's claims, including video footage showing that the plaintiff was not carrying a child and did not fall into a clothing rack. The defendant also presented evidence that the plaintiff had admitted through requests for admissions that he could not establish essential elements of his premises liability claim.

The judge found that the plaintiff had failed to respond to the defendant's requests for admissions and had failed to raise a triable issue of material fact. Therefore, the judge granted the defendant's motion for summary judgment, dismissing the plaintiff's claim.
