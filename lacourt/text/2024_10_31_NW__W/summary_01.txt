```

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied the Plaintiff's motion for additional discovery. The Plaintiff's new counsel moved to reopen expert discovery, citing a misunderstanding about the discovery cut-off date. However, the Judge found that the Plaintiff's prior counsel was aware of the discovery cut-off date and failed to comply with court orders. The Judge also noted that the Plaintiff's counsel has a history of discovery abuses and failed to request relief or reopen discovery despite being aware of the court's position. The Judge found that reopening expert discovery would cause significant prejudice to the Defendant, who had planned their trial strategy based on the assumption that discovery would be completed by the end of 2023. The Judge concluded that the Plaintiff's motion for additional discovery is denied.
