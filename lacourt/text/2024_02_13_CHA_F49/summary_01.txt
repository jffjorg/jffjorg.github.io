And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiffs' application to vacate the prefiling order and remove them from the vexatious litigant list. The plaintiffs, Judith M. Brown-Williams and Alvin E. Williams, have been designated as vexatious litigants since May 5, 2015, and have requested to be removed from the list multiple times. Each time, their request has been denied due to their continued filing of motions with lack of merit. The court has found that the plaintiffs have not demonstrated a basis to remove their vexatious litigant designation, as they have continued to file frivolous motions despite the prefiling order. Additionally, the court has ruled that the plaintiffs' application is premature, as they are not yet eligible to file another application until April 11, 2024, as per CCP § 391.8(b).
