SUMMARY OF
ACTION AND ANALYSIS
 
On May 5, 2015,
Plaintiffs Judith M. Brown-Williams and Alvin E. Williams were declared
vexatious litigants and were made subject to the prefiling order of CCP §
391.7. Since that time, Plaintiffs have requested that the order designating
them as vexatious litigants be vacated on multiples occasions. Each time, their
request has been denied.
 
The most recent
denial was April 11, 2023. In the Court’s ruling on the denial, the Court found
that there was no basis to remove Plaintiffs’ vexatious litigant designation
because Plaintiffs have continued to file motions that lack merit. They were
also not supposed to file any additional motions due to the vexatious litigant
designation, but they continued to do so.
 
CCP §391.8(a)
allows a vexatious litigant to file an application to vacate the prefiling
order and remove their name from the Judicial Council’s list of vexatious
litigants. CCP § 391.8(b) states that “A vexatious litigant whose application
under subdivision (a) was denied shall not be permitted to file another
application on or before 12 months has elapsed after the date of the denial of
the previous application.” 
 
Plaintiffs’
last application to be removed from the list was filed on March 28, 2023.
Plaintiffs’ application was denied on April 11, 2023. Twelve months have not elapsed
since Plaintiffs’ last application was denied. Plaintiffs’ may not file another
application until April 11, 2024.
 
To the extent
that Plaintiffs have requested other relief beyond their removal from the
vexatious litigant list, those motions will not be heard pursuant to CCP §
391.7, subds. (c) and (d).
 
Plaintiffs’
applications are denied.
