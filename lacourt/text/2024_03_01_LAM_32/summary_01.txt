Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has ruled on a motion by Plaintiff Beverly Rouse to compel further responses from Defendant El Camino Community College District (ECCCD) and Arthur Leible to her requests for production (RFPs). The judge has granted the motion in part, ordering Defendant to respond to certain RFPs that were previously objected to. The judge has also denied Plaintiff's motion with respect to other RFPs that were deemed duplicative of previous requests. The judge's decision is based on the parties' meet and confer declaration and the court's review of the objections to the RFPs. The judge has also addressed Defendant's privacy objections, finding that the need for the information outweighs the privacy interests of Defendant and its employees. The judge has ordered a protective order to protect any privacy interests and has denied sanctions as the parties have acted with substantial justification.
