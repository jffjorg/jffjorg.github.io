And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendants' demurrer to the complaint and their motion to quash service of summons. The demurrer was filed on February 22, 2024, and the motion was filed on January 2, 2024. The judge has denied the motion to quash service of summons, finding that the defendants have generally appeared in the action by filing a motion to reclassify and a demurrer. The judge has also overruled the demurrer, finding that the complaint states a cause of action. The plaintiff alleges past-due rent in the amount of $26,675, and the judge has found that the defendants failed to comply with the lease agreement. The judge has also rejected the defendants' argument that the prior UD action failed due to a defective three-day notice, finding that the defendants cannot have it both ways. The judge's ruling is subject to change pending further briefing and oral argument.
