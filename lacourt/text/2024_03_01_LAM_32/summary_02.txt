Summary:

The Judge issued a tentative ruling on a motion to quash a subpoena issued by SMG Mountain to U.S. Bank. The subpoena seeks documents related to two trusts controlled by Andrew Fromm, a defendant in the case. SMG Mountain alleges that it needs the documents to establish Fromm's financial benefit from the sale of SMG Holdings, which it claims is relevant to its fraud claims. However, the Judge finds that SMG Mountain has not established a sufficient connection between Fromm's financial benefit and its fraud claims, and that the subpoena is overbroad and seeks information irrelevant to the case. The Judge also finds that Fromm has a privacy interest in his financial information and that SMG Mountain has not shown direct relevance to justify the intrusion into his privacy. As a result, the Judge grants Fromm's motion to quash the subpoena.
