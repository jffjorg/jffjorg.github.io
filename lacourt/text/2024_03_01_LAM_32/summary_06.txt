And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to add Strategic Merchant Partners LLC (Strategic) as a judgment debtor. The plaintiff had argued that Strategic is the alter ego of the defendant, Vincent J. Ferro, and that Ferro is using the company to hide assets from collection. The judge found that while there is evidence that Ferro has used the company's bank account to pay personal expenses and deposit personal funds, the plaintiff has not established that Ferro lacks an adequate remedy at law or that Strategic had an opportunity to litigate the underlying action or control the defense of the action. The judge also noted that the plaintiff's evidence indicates that Strategic was formed in 2011, long after the initial action was initiated.
