  al., 
                        
                        Defendants. 


 
  Case No.:  22STCV19501
  Hearing Date:  March 1, 2024
 
     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
plaintiff’s motion to compel further
  responses 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On June 14, 2022, Plaintiff Beverly
Rouse filed this employment discrimination action against Defendants El Camino
Community College District (ECCCD) and Arthur Leible (Leible). The operative
First Amended Complaint was filed on August 22, 2022. The FAC alleges eight
causes of action arising under FEHA for discrimination, harassment, failure to
prevent, and failure to accommodate. 
            Plaintiff is an African-American
female who works for Defendant as an administrative assistant. Plaintiff
alleges that her supervisor, Arthur Leible, harassed and discriminated against
her based on her race and gender. Plaintiff further alleges that she was denied
the opportunity to telework as a disability accommodation and discriminated
against based on her disability and medical condition. 
            On January 3, 2024, Plaintiff filed
the instant motion to compel further responses from Defendant ECCCD to her
Requests for Production, Set Two. Defendant filed its opposition on February 5,
2024. Plaintiff filed her reply on February 8, 2024. The motion was continued
to allow Plaintiff to file a supplemental reply on the limited issue of
duplicative requests, which she filed on February 21, 2024. Defendant filed its
supplemental response on February 26, 2024.
LEGAL STANDARD
 Upon
receiving responses to its discovery requests, the propounding party may move
for an order compelling further responses if the responses are incomplete or
evasive, or objections are without merit or too general. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300(a),
2031.310(a), 2033.290(a).) 
MEET AND CONFER
A motion to compel further must be
accompanied by a meet and confer declaration demonstrating an attempt to
resolve the matter informally. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300(b)(1),
2031.310(b), 2033.290(b).) The Court finds that Plaintiff has satisfied the
meet and confer requirement. (See Tojo Decl.)
DISCUSSION
Initially, Defendant served objection-only
responses to 86 out of 98 requests for production in Plaintiff’s second set of
RFPs. (Tojo Decl. ¶ 9, Ex. C.) In its supplemental responses, Defendant
maintains objection-only responses to RFP Nos. 1,2,3,4,5,20,
21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,35, 39,40,41,42,43,44,45, 46, 47, 48, 49,
50,51,52,53,57, 61,63,64, 65,66,67, 86, 87,88, 89,90,91,96,97, and 98. (Id.,
¶ 20, Ex. K.) Through this motion, Plaintiff seeks further supplemental
responses to these RFPs. 
Although Defendant’s responses interposed
numerous objections, Defendant’s opposition narrows to two contentions: “1)
Plaintiff propounded duplicative requests as to 24 of the requests previously
served in Plaintiff’s first set of documents requests that Plaintiff never
followed up upon, and/or 2) Plaintiff overbroadly seeking personnel file
information and non-relevant complaint information regarding third parties.”
(Opp. 1:9-13.)  
            
 
1. Duplicative
            “The court shall restrict the
frequency or extent of use of a discovery method provided in Section 2019.010
if it determines either of the following: (1) The discovery sought is
unreasonably cumulative or duplicative, or is obtainable from some other source
that is more convenient, less burdensome, or less expensive. (2) The selected
method of discovery is unduly burdensome or expensive, taking into account the
needs of the case, the amount in controversy, and the importance of the issues
at stake in the litigation.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2019.030(a).)
In response to RFP Nos. 1-5, 20-28, 35,
65-67, 86-91, and 96-98 from Set Two, Defendant objected that they were
duplicative of RFPs from Set One and identified the corresponding RFPs from Set
One. Based on the parties’ supplemental briefs, the Court makes the following
findings on RFP Set Two.  
RFP No. 1 requests any and
all documents containing references to any investigation of discrimination
complaints against Leible. Defendant’s response objected that this was
duplicative of RFP Nos. 117-119 from Set One. It is not duplicative of Nos. 117
and 118 because those requests sought information about sexual harassment, not
discrimination. However, it is duplicative of No. 119, which requested any
and all documents referencing any complaints made by any
employee against Leible. This necessarily includes documents pertaining to
investigations of discrimination complaints against Leible. Therefore, a
further response is not required. 
RFP No. 20 seeks documents
pertaining to investigations of sexual harassment, discrimination, or
retaliation complaints made by Plaintiff against any employee. Defendant’s
response objected that this was duplicative of RFP Nos. 117-119 from Set One,
which pertained only to complaints against Leible. The request is duplicative to
the extent it seeks complaints against Leible. It is not duplicative to the
extent it seeks documents referencing complaints against other employees. If
Defendant does not possess such documents, it can serve a code-compliant
response to that effect. Therefore, a further response is required.
RFP Nos. 21-22 seek documents
pertaining to any investigation of Plaintiff’s complaints of race/disability
discrimination or retaliation against any employee. Defendant’s response
objected that this was duplicative of RFP Nos. 117-119 from Set One. The
request is duplicative of No. 119 to the extent it seeks information on
complaints against Leible. It is not duplicative to the extent it seeks
references to complaints against other employees. If Defendant does not possess
such documents, it can serve a code-compliant response to that effect.
Therefore, a further response is required. 
RFP No. 23 seeks documents
pertaining to any warnings, oral or written, given to Leible in connection with
complaints made by Plaintiff. This is partially duplicative of RFP No. 116 from
Set One, which requested all verbal warnings received by Leible. A further
response is required, but the request is limited to written warnings. 
RFP Nos. 24-25 seek documents
pertaining to any warnings, oral or written, given to Leible in connection with
any complaints of race/disability discrimination or retaliation made by
Plaintiff. This is partially duplicative of RFP No. 116 from Set One, which
requested all verbal warnings received by Leible. A further response is
required, but the request is limited to written warnings.
RFP Nos. 66-67 seek documents
pertaining to any investigation of Plaintiff’s complaints of race/disability
discrimination for a particular time period. Defendant’s response objected that
this was duplicative of RFP Nos. 117-119 from Set One. The request is not
duplicative of Nos. 117 and 118 because those pertained to harassment. The
request is duplicative of No. 119 to the extent it seeks complaints against
Leible; it is not duplicative to the extent it seeks documents referencing
complaints against other employees. If Defendant does not possess such
documents, it can serve a code-compliant response to that effect. Therefore, a
further response is required. 
RFP Nos. 86-88 seek documents,
including witness statements, obtained in the course of investigations into
Plaintiff’s complaints of sexual harassment, race discrimination, and
disability discrimination. Defendant’s responses objected that the requests
were duplicative of RFP Nos. 57 and 58 from Set One, which requested all
witness statements referencing Plaintiff or the events alleged in the
complaint. Plaintiff has agreed to exclude witness statements from these
requests. The requests are not otherwise duplicative. Therefore, a further
response is required. 
RFP Nos. 90-91 seek documents
pertaining to results or conclusions reached by Defendant in its investigations
of Plaintiff’s race/disability discrimination complaints. Defendant’s responses
objected that the requests were duplicative of RFP Nos. 117-119 from Set One. The
requests are duplicative of No. 119 to the extent they seek information on
complaints against Leible. They are not duplicative to the extent they seek
references to complaints against other employees. If Defendant does not possess
such documents, it can serve a code-compliant response to that effect.
Therefore, a further response is required. 
RFP Nos. 96-98 seek documents
pertaining to any complaint by any employee in the past ten years relating to
disability discrimination, reasonable accommodation, or the interactive
process. Defendant’s responses to these requests did not identify any RFPs from
Set One that were supposedly duplicated. However, the requests are duplicative of
No. 119 to the extent they seek information on complaints against Leible. The
requests are not otherwise duplicative. Therefore, a further response is
required. 
Defendant argues throughout its
supplemental opposition that the Set Two RFPs are duplicative of RFP No. 35
from Set One. However, Defendant did not mention RFP No. 35 in either its
responses to the Set Two RFPs or its initial opposition to this motion.
Moreover, RFP No. 35 sought documents identified by Defendant in its response
to Form Interrogatory-Employment No. 208.2. It is unclear what, if any,
documents Defendant identified in response to FROG No. 208.2. Therefore, it
cannot be determined that the Set Two RFPs seek the same documents as RFP No.
35 from Set One.    
By not addressing the remainder of the
duplicative RFPs, Plaintiff concedes that they are duplicative. Therefore,
Defendant does not have to respond to those RFPs. In sum, Defendant must
respond to the Set Two RFPs to the extent set forth above. Defendant must also
respond to the RFPs that it does not contend are duplicative.     
                        2. Privacy
            “The party asserting a privacy right
must establish a legally protected privacy interest, an objectively reasonable
expectation of privacy in the given circumstances, and a threatened intrusion
that is serious.” (Williams v. Sup. Ct. (2017) 3 Cal.5th 531, 552.) If
the court finds a privacy interest, the court must balance the privacy concerns
against the need for the information. (Id. at p. 552.) Discovery of
private information is governed by the more stringent standard of direct
relevance in order to prevent a fishing expedition of “tangentially pertinent
sensitive information.” (Boler v. Sup. Ct. (1987) 201 Cal.App.3d 467,
472.) “The burden is on the party seeking the constitutionally protected
information to establish direct relevance.” (Davis v. Superior Court
(1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1008, 1017.)
            Courts have recognized a privacy
interest in personnel files. (See, e.g., Teamsters Local 856 v.
Priceless, LLC (2003) 112 Cal.App.4th 1500, 1515; Caldecott v. Superior
Court (2015) 243 Cal.App.4th 212, 222.) However, Defendant and its employee
are currently being sued for discrimination and related claims. Plaintiff’s
need for the information outweighs the privacy interests because Plaintiff is
entitled to discover evidence to confirm her complaints and to verify
Defendant’s action or inaction in response to those complaints. Such
information is directly relevant. The same applies to “me too” evidence, which
may be used to establish a defendant’s discriminatory intent through a pattern
of wrongdoing. (Pantoja v. Anton (2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 87, 115.) A
protective order will sufficiently protect any privacy interests, such that the
intrusion is not serious. (See Hill v. National Collegiate Athletic Assn.
(1994) 7 Cal.4th 1, 38.)  
            Therefore, Defendant’s privacy
objection does not prevent the discovery sought. Defendant must respond to the
RFPs, subject to the limitations discussed above. 
CONCLUSION
            Plaintiff’s motion to compel further
responses is GRANTED in part as set forth above. Production shall be subject to
a protective order. Sanctions are denied as the parties acted with substantial
justification.
