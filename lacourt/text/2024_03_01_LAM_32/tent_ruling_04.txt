  Case No.:  23STCV21889
  Hearing Date: March 1, 2024
 
     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
plaintiff’s motion to deem matters
  admitted 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On September 12, 2023, Plaintiff TBF
Financial I, LLC filed this action against Defendant Risa B. Freeman, alleging
(1) breach of contract and (2) continuing guaranty. 
            On January 31, 2024, Plaintiff filed
the instant motion to establish admissions and the genuineness of documents.
Defendant filed her opposition on February 15, 2024. 
LEGAL STANDARD
Responses to requests for admission are
due thirty days after service of the requests. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2033.250(a).) If a party fails to timely respond to RFAs, the propounding party
may move to deem the matters admitted. (Id., § 2033.280(b).) The motion
must be granted unless the responding party serves substantially compliant
responses before the hearing on the motion. (Id., subd. (c).) Monetary
sanctions are mandatory regardless of whether the matters are deemed admitted
and regardless of substantial justification. (Ibid.) 
 
 
DISCUSSION
            Plaintiff served the subject RFAs on
November 3, 2023. (Krantz Decl. ¶ 4.) Defendant did not respond within 30 days,
but Plaintiff gave Defendant until January 26, 2024 to respond. (Id., ¶¶
4-6.) Defendant did not respond to the RFAs by January 26, 2024. This motion
followed. 
            Defendant avers that she will serve
responses prior to the hearing on this motion. (Freeman Decl. ¶ 6.) If Defendant
serves substantially compliant responses prior to the hearing, the RFAs will
not be deemed admitted. However, monetary sanctions are mandatory under the
statute. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280(c).) The Court finds that $400 is the
reasonable amount. 
CONCLUSION
            Plaintiff’s motion to deem matters
admitted is GRANTED unless Defendant serves substantially compliant responses
prior to the hearing on this motion. Sanctions are granted against Defendant in
the amount of $400, to be paid within 30 days.
