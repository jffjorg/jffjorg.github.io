Ltd. v. Haykoush Kzlgezyan, et al., Case No. 24STCV08578
 
Plaintiff filed
an ex parte application for a temporary restraining order and order to show
cause why a preliminary injunction shall not issue to stop the lien sale of a
2022 Chevrolet Corvette by Defendant ACE Collision Center Inc. (“ACE”).  ACE performed service on the vehicle and
stored the vehicle.  Per Code of Civil
procedure section 3068(b)(4), a service lien “shall be extinguished, and no
lien sale shall be conducted” if the lienholder fails to provide “a written
copy of the work order or invoice reflecting the services or repairs performed
on the vehicle and the authorization from the registered owner” within 10 days
of receiving a request.  Per the statute,
the request must be a “written demand made by either personal service or
certified mail with return receipt requested . . . .”  Plaintiff has not complied with this
statute.  The declaration of Eric Tran
merely states that he “requested” the information.  The declaration is accompanied by a letter,
dated March 28, 2024, which states: “[T]his correspondence shall constitute AFS’
demand for a written copy of the work order or invoice reflecting the services
or repairs performed on the Vehicle and the authorization from the registered owner
requesting that you perform the services or repairs.”  This letter was “Sent Via US Mail and Email.”  This is not sufficient under Civil Code
section 3068(b)(4).  Therefore, the ex
parte application for a temporary restraining order is denied.  Plaintiff’s counsel shall provide notice and
file proof of service with the court.
