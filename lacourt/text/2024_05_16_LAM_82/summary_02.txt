And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the ex parte application for a temporary restraining order filed by ACAR Leasing Ltd. to stop the lien sale of a 2022 Chevrolet Corvette. The application was filed in response to ACE Collision Center Inc.'s service on the vehicle and storage of the vehicle. However, the plaintiff failed to comply with the statute requiring a written demand for a copy of the work order or invoice reflecting the services or repairs performed. The judge found that the plaintiff's request was insufficient under Code of Civil Procedure section 3068(b)(4) and therefore denied the application. The plaintiff's counsel is required to provide notice and file proof of service with the court.
