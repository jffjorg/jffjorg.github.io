[1] The
Court notes that Defendants’ opposition was filed three court days late. (Code
Civ. Proc. § 1005, subd. (b).) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Court
exercises its discretion under Rule 3.110 of the California Rules of Court, to
excuse the untimely-filed opposition. Defendants are advised to take note of
the filing deadlines under the statute, as future filings made past the
statutory deadlines may result in the Court declining to consider the
late-filed papers at the hearing.¿
