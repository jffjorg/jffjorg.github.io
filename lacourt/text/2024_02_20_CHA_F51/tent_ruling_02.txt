RESPONDING PARTY: Defendants
Prince Hospitality, LLC, dba Homewood Suites Santa Clarita; and Lawrence Barr
(collectively, “Defendants”)
NOTICE: OK
¿ 
RELIEF REQUESTED: A
preliminary injunction prohibiting Defendants and their agents from: (1)
Preventing Plaintiff from accessing her rental unit; (2) Interfering directly
or indirectly with Plaintiff’s free access to the unit; (3) Interfering
directly or indirectly with any of Plaintiff’s personal property; (4)
Dispossessing Plaintiff from the unit without first obtaining a lawful judgment

is denied.
 
Plaintiff is reminded that all documents “must be text
searchable when technologically feasible without impairment of the document's
image.” (CRC 2.256(b)(3).) Failure to comply with these requirements in the
future may result in papers being rejected, matters being placed off calendar,
matters being continued so documents can be resubmitted in compliance with
these requirements, documents not being considered and/or the imposition of
sanctions.
 
BACKGROUND¿ 
 
 
On 7/19/23,
Plaintiff filed the instant motion for a preliminary injunction. On 7/25/23,
this Court granted Plaintiff a temporary restraining order granting Plaintiff
possession of the premises and the above relief requested. On 2/8/23, Defendants
filed their opposition to the instant motion.[1] No
reply has been filed to date.
 
ANALYSIS
 
In determining whether to issue a
preliminary injunction, the Court considers two interrelated factors: (1) the
likelihood that the plaintiff will prevail on the merits at trial and (2) the
interim harm the plaintiff will likely suffer if the injunction does not issue
as compared to the harm the defendant is likely to suffer if the injunction
does issue. (White v. Davis (2003) 30 Cal.4th 528, 554; Smith v.
Adventist Health System/West (2010) 182 Cal.App.4th 729, 749; Brown v.
Pacifica Foundation, Inc. (2019) 34 Cal.App.5th 915, 925; Amgen Inc. v.
Health Care Services (2020) 47 Cal.App.5th 716, 731.)
 
1.      Balancing
of Equities
 
In deciding on the issuance of a
preliminary injunction, the Court must balance the equities between the
parties. If denying the requested relief would result in great harm to the
plaintiff, and the defendant would suffer little harm if the relief is granted,
it is an abuse of discretion to deny relief. (Robbins v. Superior Court (1985)
38 Cal.3d 199, 205; Butt v. State of California (1992) 4 Cal.4th 668,
678 (the greater the plaintiff’s showing on one factor, the less that must be
shown on the other to support an injunction).)
 
Irreparable harm (i.e., inadequate
legal remedy) is one of the traditional considerations for the issuance of a
preliminary injunction. (Code Civ. Proc. § 526, subd. (a)(2).) The threat of
irreparable harm must be imminent and not a mere possibility of harm sometime
in the future. (Korean Philadelphia Presbyterian Church v. California
Presbytery (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 1069, 1084.) However, plaintiffs need not
wait until they have suffered actual harm and may seek injunctive relief
against threatened infringement of their rights. (Maria P. v. Riles
(1987) 43 Cal.3d 1281, 1292; Costa Mesa City Employees’ Assn. v. City of
Costa Mesa (2012) 209 Cal.App.4th 298, 305-306.)
 
Here, Plaintiff argues that she
“and her children are currently homeless and are likely to remain homeless
throughout the duration of this case if their possession of the Unit is not
restored. … Because of her limited income, Ms. Johnson will have an extremely
difficult time finding stable housing during the pendency of this action and is
therefore likely to remain homeless indefinitely.” (Pl.’s Mot. 5:21–26, citing
Decl. of Alicia Johnson ¶¶ 11–12.) Plaintiff further argues that “in contrast,
… Defendants will suffer no harm if they are required to follow the lawful
process to evict their tenants.” (Id. at 6:1–3.)
 
In opposition, Defendants dispute
Plaintiff’s contention that she and her children are homeless. “Since January
2023, the staff at the Hotel have not seen Plaintiff’s children or dog enter
the property. … Further, Plaintiff herself has been sporadically coming in and
out of the guestroom since January 2023.” (Defs.’ Opp. 5:1–3, citing Decl. of
Lawrence Barr ¶¶ 11–12.) Defendants further contend that “when Defendants had
entered the property on June 15, 2023, Defendants have video evidence how there
was little to no personal effects of Defendants in the guestroom that were not
Hotel property.” (Id. at 5:5–7, citing Barr Decl. ¶ 13.) “As such,
Plaintiff’s claims that her family is homeless is unfounded, since January 2023
her children have lived predominantly somewhere else and Plaintiff herself has
sporadically used the guestroom being absent for weeks at a time.” (Id. at
5:12–14.)
 
Defendants further argue that in
contrast to the potential harm to Plaintiff should the injunction be denied, “Defendants
will suffer major harm if the Court grants an injunction reinstating Plaintiff
to the Hotel’s guestroom. Defendants’ Hotel is still recovering from the
devastating effects Covid-19 has had on the hospitality industry and the lack
of a one-bedroom type guestroom would destroy a significant amount of
Defendants’ business. Defendants are responsible for paying a plethora of Hotel
staff and the cost to upkeep the Hotel is not small, it would be a major blow
to the business if a paid guestroom was completely taken out.” (Id. at 5:18–23.)
“If the Court grants this Preliminary Injunction, Defendants will lose at least
$45,208.8[0] dollars in hotel fees, as that would be approximately a year’s
worth of unpaid hotel fees that Ms. Johnson will not pay.” (Id. at 6:23–25.)
 
Based on the foregoing, the Court
finds that the potential harm to Defendant outweighs the potential harm to Plaintiff
should the injunction be issued.
 
2.      Likelihood
of Success on the Merits
 
A trial court may not issue an
injunction, regardless of the amount of interim harm, “unless there is some
possibility” that plaintiff will ultimately prevail on the merits of the claim.
(Jamison v. Department of Transp. (2016) 4 Cal.App.5th 356, 362; Association
of Orange County Deputy Sheriffs v. County of Orange (2013) 217 Cal.App.4th
29, 49.)
 
Here, Plaintiff argues that “defendants
locked Ms. Johnson out of the Unit and removed her personal property from the
unit without providing proper notice or utilizing the unlawful detainer
procedure. Due to the egregious nature of defendants’ illegal self-help
eviction, breach of quiet enjoyment and wrongful eviction, Ms. Johnson will
prevail on her claims against defendants.” (Pl.’s Mot. 5:14–17.)
 
In opposition, Defendants argue
that “Plaintiff has violated California penal code 537 (a) through her
intentional evasion of paying for the services provided by Defendants[’] Hotel.
Plaintiff started her act of fraud on December 11, 2022, since that date she
has paid nothing to the Hotel.” (Defs.’ Opp. 3:14–17.) Defendants further argue
that “under Civil Code Section 789.3, this law only applies to tenant-landlord
situations that involve apartments not a hotel patron and Hotel Innkeeper.” (Id.
at 4:10–11.) “Since it is undisputed that Plaintiff has not paid any room
charges owed and admits that the Hotel provides the typical hotel services
listed in § 1940(b)(2), … Prince Hospitality as an innkeeper is not subject to
Civ. Code § 789.3. (Id. at 4:19–22, citing Barr Decl. ¶¶ 4–5.)
 
California landlord-tenant laws do
not apply to tenants who maintain an occupancy at a hotel or motel where the
innkeeper retains a right of access to and control of the dwelling unit, and
offers all of the following services to all of the residents: facilities for
safeguarding of personal property; central telephone service; maid, mail, and
room services; occupancy for periods of less than 7 days; and food service
provided by a food establishment that is located on or adjacent to the premises
of the hotel or motel and that is owned or operated by the innkeeper or the
innkeeper's lessee or affiliate. (Civ. Code § 1940, subd. (b)(2).)
 
Here, Defendants proffer the sworn
declaration of defendant Lawrence Barr, the General Manager of the subject
property, wherein he states that “the Homewood Suites in [sic] not a
residential hotel and does not have long term tenants. It is a standard hotel
with nightly hotel guests and provides daily housekeeping and cleaning for the
rooms.” (Barr Decl. ¶ 4.) The Court finds persuasive Defendants’ contention
that the California landlord-tenant laws do not apply in this action, and that Plaintiff
therefore has a reasonably low probability of succeeding on the merits of the
instant action. The Court notes that Plaintiff has failed to file a reply
argument to Defendants’ opposition. Accordingly, the Court finds that Plaintiff
has failed to satisfy the second prong of the test for issuance of a
preliminary injunction.
 
CONCLUSION¿ 
 
Plaintiff’s request for a preliminary injunction is denied.
