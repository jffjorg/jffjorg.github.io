 [TENTATIVE] RULING RE:
Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant St. Andrew’s Pharmacy, LLC’s
  Motion for Attorney’s Fees.



 
Background
Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant St.
Andrew’s Pharmacy, LLC—as owned by Elite 126 Management, LLC and Elite’s owner,
Mr. Cobby Pourtavosi—sued Defendants St. Andrew’s Green, a Cooperative
Corporation (also a Cross-Complainant), Kathy Smith aka Kandace Simplis (also a
Cross-Defendant), and Does 1-50 pursuant to a December 22, 2020 Complaint
alleging claims of (1) Violation of Penal Code section 496, (2) Conversion, (3)
Specific Recovery of Personal Property (Replevin), (4) Violation of Unfair
Competition Law, Bus. & Prof. Code, § 17200, et seq., (5) Common Counts,
and (6) Declaratory Relief.
Briefly and among other things, the
claims arose from allegations that Defendants acted in such a way as to deprive
Plaintiff of its City of Los Angeles-issued medical marijuana license.
In turn, St. Andrew’s Green, a
Cooperative Corporation, and Arnold Abramyan sued St. Andrew’s Pharmacy, LLC
(hereafter Plaintiff), Kathy Smith (hereafter Defendant Smith), Elite
Management, LLC, Cobby Pourtavousi, Andre Khalili, Roe 1 Manu Khalili, and Roes
2 through 200 pursuant to a December 29, 2020 First Amended Cross-Complaint
alleging claims of (1) Violation of Penal Code section 496, (2) Conversion, (3)
Unfair Business Practices, (4) Implied Indemnity, (5) Comparative Indemnity,
(6) Declaratory Relief, and (7) Declaratory Relief.
Trial was held in this action on
September 2, 6-8, 14, 16, 19, and 22, 2022.
On December 14, 2022, the
Court—then directed by Judge Sotelo (Ret.)—issued a final statement of decision.
On January 24, 2023, the Court
entered judgment in this action in conformity with the final statement of
decision. The judgment adjudged that “Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant St. Andrew’s
Pharmacy, LLC and Cross-Defendant Cobby Pourtavosi shall have judgment in their
favor against Defendants/Cross-Complainants St. Andrew’s Green, a Cooperative
Corporation and Arnold Abramyan and Defendant Kathy Smith.” Important to this
analysis, the Court adjudged Plaintiff as having “judgment against Defendant
Kathy Smith on its cause of action for violation of Penal Code section 496.” Moreover,
the Court entitled Plaintiff to costs against Defendant Smith,
Defendant/Cross-Complainant St. Andrew’s Green, a Cooperative Corporation, and
Cross-Defendant Arnold Abramyan.
On March 23, 2023, Defendant Smith,
in pro per, appealed the judgment after court trial.
On March 27, 2023, Plaintiff filed
a memorandum of costs. The costs memorandum was served that same day on counsel
for Defendant Smith, as well as counsel for Defendant/Cross-Complainant St.
Andrew’s Green, a Cooperative Corporation, and Cross-Defendant Arnold Abramyan.
On March 28, 2023, Plaintiff filed
and served a notice of entry of judgment or order.
On May 26, 2023, Plaintiff moved
for attorney’s fees against Defendant Kathy Smith.
On September 13, 2023, Plaintiff
filed a reply noticing Defendant Smith’s failure to oppose the motion for attorney’s
fees.
Plaintiff’s motion for attorney’s
fees is now before the Court.
 
Motion for Attorney’s Fees and Memorandum of Costs
Legal
Standard
A
prevailing party is entitled to recover costs as a matter of right. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1032, subds. (a)(4), (b).) Attorney’s fees are also recoverable as
costs when authorized by contract, statute, or law. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5,
subd. (a)(10).) Any person who has been injured by a violation of subdivision
(a) or (b) may bring an action for three times the amount of actual damages, if
any, sustained by the plaintiff, costs of suit, and reasonable attorney’s fees.
(Pen. Code, § 496, subd. (c).)
The
Court begins this inquiry “with the ‘lodestar,’ i.e., the number of hours
reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate.” (PLCM Group
v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095.) From there, the “lodestar figure
may then be adjusted [according to a multiplier enhancement] based on
consideration of factors specific to the case, in order to fix the fee at the
fair market value for the legal services provided.” (Ibid.) Relevant
multiplier factors include “(1) the novelty and difficulty of the questions
involved, (2) the skill displayed in presenting them, (3) the extent to which
the nature of the litigation precluded other employment by the attorneys, [and]
(4) the contingent nature of the fee award.” (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24
Cal.4th 1122, 1132.)
No
specific findings reflecting the court’s calculations for attorney’s fees are
required; the record need only show that the attorney’s fees were awarded
according to the “lodestar” or “touchstone” approach. (Rebney v. Wells Fargo
Bank (1991) 232 Cal.App.3d 1344, 1349, disagreed with on other grounds in In
re Marriage of Demblewski (1994) 26 Cal.App.4th 232, 236, fn. 7
[disagreement as to statement of decision requirements].) The Court has broad
discretion to determine the amount of a reasonable attorney’s fee award, which
will not be overturned absent a “manifest abuse of discretion, a prejudicial
error of law, or necessary findings not supported by substantial evidence.” (Bernardi
v. County of Monterey (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 1379, 1393-1394.)
Order
Granting Fees and Costs: GRANTED.
I.
Discussion
re: Attorney’s Fees against Defendant/Cross-Defendant Kathy Smith
As
the prevailing party in this action, Plaintiff seeks $316,360 in attorney’s
fees against Defendant Kathy Smith. (See Mot., p. 2.)
Defendant
Kathy Smith has failed to oppose the attorney’s fees motion. (See 2/6/23
Stipulation [clarifying legal name for this party].)
The
Court first finds that Plaintiff is entitled to fees against Defendant Kathy
Smith pursuant to Penal Code section 496, subdivision (c). (Pen. Code, § 496,
subd. (c) [“Any person who has been injured by a violation of subdivision (a)
or (b) may bring an action for three times the amount of actual damages, if
any, sustained by the plaintiff, costs of suit, and reasonable attorney’s fees”];
1/24/23 Judgment, p. 2 [“Plaintiff St. Andrew’s Pharmacy, LLC shall have
judgment against Defendant Kathy Smith on its cause of action for violation of
Penal Code section 496”].)
The
Court next finds that the attorney fee rates sought by Plaintiff—$450 per hour
for Jason P. Saccuzzo, Esq., $350 per hour for Michael L. Federici, Esq., and
$110 per hour for paralegal time—are reasonable. First, the rates are supported
by the declaration of Mr. Saccuzzo, which provides a brief professional and/or
academic background for counsel, Mr. Saccuzzo being a more than 20-year
practitioner and Mr. Federici being a five-plus-years practitioner. (Mot., p.
8; Mot., Saccuzzo Decl., ¶¶ 16-18.) Second, the Court’s experience in fees for
the Los Angeles market also confirms the reasonableness of these fees. 
The
Court also finds that the hours expended on this action appear reasonable. No
opposition exists to rebut the appropriateness of the hours sought by
Plaintiff. Moreover, the motion is supported by a verified declaration as to the
hours expended on this action, which is entitled to deference. (Mot., Saccuzzo
Decl., ¶¶ 8-15; see Dunk v. Ford Motor Co. (1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 1794,
1810 [time records not entirely necessary where “estimates based on the
functions performed [may] allow the court to properly calculate the lodestar
amount”]; see, e.g., Sommers v. Erb (1992) 2 Cal.App.4th 1644, 1651
[fees awarded based on attorney’s representation as to hours actually spent on
contingency fee representation where no time records were available].)
No
multiplier enhancement award is sought, meriting no further discussion.
Thus,
the Court GRANTS the motion for attorney’s fees against Defendant Kathy Smith
in the full amount of $316,360.
II.
Discussion
re: Costs Against Smith, St. Andrew’s Green, a Cooperative Corporation, and
Abramyan
Moreover,
though not directly raised by Plaintiff, the Court GRANTS the costs sought in
the March 27, 2023 memorandum of costs.
Plaintiff
has filed a memorandum of costs seeking $54,269.48 in costs. (See 3/27/23 Memo,
MC-010, p. 1-2, MC-011, pp. 1-4, Attachs. 1g, 4e, 5d, 16 [breakdown of costs].)
The
judgment clarifies that Plaintiff is entitled to costs from Defendant Smith,
Defendant/Cross-Complainant St. Andrew’s Green, a Cooperative Corporation, and
Cross-Defendant Arnold Abramyan. (See 1/24/23 Judgment, p. 3.)
The
costs memorandum was filed and served on March 27, 2023, prior to any notice of
entry of judgment, which Plaintiff made on March 28, 2023. The costs memorandum
is thus timely. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1700, subd. (a)(1) [memorandum of
costs must be served and filed within 15 days after notice of entry of judgment
by clerk, 15 days of written notice of entry of judgment by any of the parties,
or 180 days after entry of judgment].) The Court briefly notes that Plaintiff’s
December 27, 2022 notice of entry of final statement of decision did not
trigger the deadline for filing a costs memorandum because the rule of court
contemplates the trigger date as notice of entry of judgment, not notice of
entry of statement of decision. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1700, subd.
(a)(1).)
Despite
Plaintiff serving their counsel with the memorandum of costs on March 27, 2023,
Defendant Smith, Defendant/Cross-Complainant St. Andrew’s Green, a Cooperative
Corporation, and Cross-Defendant Arnold Abramyan have failed to move to tax or
strike costs from the March 27, 2023 costs memorandum.
The
California Rules of Court provide that “[a]fter the time has passed for a
motion to strike or tax costs or for determination of that motion, the clerk
must immediately enter the costs on the judgment.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1700, subd. (b)(4).)
Costs
are thus appropriate here. However, the Court seeks clarification as to from
which party which costs are sought, as between Defendant Smith, Defendant/Cross-Complainant
St. Andrew’s Green, a Cooperative Corporation, and Cross-Defendant Arnold
Abramyan. 

Conclusion
Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant St.
Andrew’s Pharmacy, LLC’s Motion for Attorney’s Fees is GRANTED in the amount of
$316,360.
Defendant/Cross-Defendant Kathy
Smith is ORDERED to remit these attorney’s fees to Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant
St. Andrew’s Pharmacy, LLC within 90 days of this order.
Clarification is sought as to the
parties against whom Plaintiff St. Andrew’s Pharmacy, LLC’s is seeking costs in
the amount of $54,269.48.
