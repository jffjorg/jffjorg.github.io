Here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The case involves a dispute between Eastland Corporation (Plaintiff) and multiple defendants, including La Galbi, Inc. and Ji Young Joo, over a debt of $55,702.51. The Plaintiff filed a complaint in 2009, and a default judgment was entered against the defendants in 2010. In 2020, the Plaintiff applied for a renewal of judgment, and in 2023, a writ of execution was issued. The defendant Ji Young Joo made a claim of exemption, which is currently being heard by the Court.

The Court has continued the hearing on the claim of exemption to October 23, 2023, to be heard concurrently with a motion to set aside default judgment and a motion to recall and quash the writ of execution. The Court notes that the notice of opposition to the claim of exemption does not provide sufficient documentation to support the Plaintiff's opposition. The parties are advised to supplement their filings in support of or opposition to the claim of exemption before the next hearing.

The Court's ruling is based on the Code of Civil Procedure, specifically sections 695.010, 699.510, 703.510, 703.520, 703.530, 703.570, and 703.580. The Court's decision will depend on the validity of the claim of exemption and the default judgment, as well as the parties' compliance with the relevant laws and procedures.

The case BC419058, scheduled for a hearing on September 20, 2023 in the Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles, Department 40, involves the Plaintiff Eastland Corporation and multiple Defendants, including Ji Young Joo. The Plaintiff filed a complaint on July 31, 2009, alleging claims of breach of contract, open book account, account stated, goods sold and delivered, and statutory damages on dishonored checks. The claims arose from an agreement for the purchase of goods, specifically fresh and frozen meat products, between the Plaintiff and Defendants. The Defendants allegedly failed to pay their debt or provided checks that bounced for insufficient funds, resulting in damages to the Plaintiff in the amount of $55,702.51.

On November 13, 2009, the Plaintiff secured an entry of default against all Defendants except for Tae Hwan Joo and Moon Kwon Joo. On January 28, 2010, the Plaintiff filed a complete default judgment packet against the Defaulted Defendants, and the Court entered judgment against them. On January 21, 2020, the Plaintiff applied for a renewal of judgment, which was granted. On June 15, 2023, the Plaintiff filed a memorandum of costs after judgment and applied for, and was issued, a writ of execution for a money judgment. On July 21, 2023, Defendant Ji Young Joo received notice that approximately $53,779.91 had been taken out of seven bank accounts held by her at Bank of America.

On July 31, 2023, Defendant Ji Young Joo made an ex parte application to recall and quash the writ of execution. The ex parte application also informed the Court that Defendant Joo had set a formal motion to set aside default judgment in this matter for hearing on October 23, 2023. The Court denied the ex parte application but calendared a hearing on the same relief for October 23, 2023, to be heard concurrently with the motion to set aside default judgment.

On August 16, 2023, Collect Access LLC filed and served a notice of hearing on a claim of exemption made by Defendant Ji Young Joo. The claim of exemption is now before the Court. According to the legal standard, all property of the judgment debtor is subject to enforcement of a money judgment, unless it is exempt as provided in Code of Civil Procedure sections 703.510 to 703.610. The debtor must make the claim within 15 days of the date the notice of levy on the property was served.

The claim must be executed under oath and include the name and mailing address of the claimant, a description of the property claimed to be exempt, a financial statement as required by section 703.530, a citation of the statute on which the claim is based, and a statement of facts necessary to support the claim. The financial statement must be executed under oath by the judgment debtor and the debtor’s spouse, and include information about the assets, earnings, and outstanding obligations of the judgment debtor and the spouse and dependents of the judgment debtor.

The hearing on the motion shall be held not later than 30 days from the date the notice of motion was filed with the court unless continued by the court for good cause. The claim of exemption is deemed controverted by the notice of opposition to the claim of exemption and both shall be received in evidence. If not satisfied, the court shall order the hearing continued for the production of other evidence, oral or documentary. At the hearing on the claim of exception, the claimant has the burden of proof.

The Court CONTINUES the hearing on the claim of exemption to 8:30 on October 23, 2023. A concurrent hearing for the motion to set aside default judgment, motion to recall and quash writ of execution (briefed as an ex parte application), and the claim of exemption is the best use of judicial resources. The notice of opposition to claim of exemption does not attach any documents showing the financial statement with which Plaintiff takes issue nor any other documents that will assist the Court to make a proper determination as to the claim.

## Case Summary: BC419058

**Case Number:** BC419058
**Plaintiff:** Eastland Corporation dba C&H Meat Co.
**Defendant:** Ji Young Joo (formerly Yoo)

**Background:**

* This is a breach of contract and debt collection case filed in 2009.
* Plaintiff alleges Defendant Ji Young Joo (along with other Defendants) failed to pay for meat products purchased from Plaintiff.
* A default judgment was entered against Defendant Yoo in 2010.
* In 2023, Plaintiff sought to collect on the judgment through a writ of execution.
* Defendant Yoo claims exemption from the writ of execution.

**Key Events:**

* **July 21, 2023:** Defendant Yoo's bank accounts were levied upon.
* **July 31, 2023:** Defendant Yoo filed an ex parte application to recall the writ of execution and set aside the default judgment.
* **August 1, 2023:** Plaintiff opposed the ex parte application. 
* **August 2, 2023:** The court denied the ex parte application but scheduled a hearing on the motion to set aside default judgment (and simultaneously the claim of exemption) for October 23, 2023.
* **August 16, 2023:** Collect Access LLC filed a notice of hearing on Defendant Yoo's claim of exemption and a notice of opposition. 

**Issues:**

* Defendant Yoo's claim of exemption from the writ of execution.
* Defendant Yoo's motion to set aside the default judgment.

**Arguments:**

* **Plaintiff:** Likely argues that Defendant Yoo has not provided sufficient evidence to support the claim of exemption and that the default judgment should stand.
* **Defendant Yoo:** Likely argues that the property levied upon should be exempt based on specific legal grounds and that the default judgment should be set aside due to insufficient service or other procedural errors.

## English Text Summary

This is a legal document outlining the tentative ruling of a judge in a case where a company, Eastland Corporation, is trying to collect a debt from an individual, Ji Young Joo. 

Joo was previously defaulted in this case in 2010 for failing to pay for meat products purchased from Eastland. Now, Eastland is attempting to collect on the debt through a writ of execution, which allows them to seize Joo's assets.

Joo has filed a claim of exemption, arguing that the assets seized should be protected from collection. The judge has scheduled a hearing for October 23rd to determine if Joo's claim is valid and if the default judgment against her should be set aside. The judge also noted that the opposing party, Eastland, has not provided any supporting documentation to challenge Joo's claim of exemption.

English-text summary:
The Judge has written a tentative ruling regarding a future court hearing. The case involves Eastland Corporation, a meat company, suing several defendants, including Ji Young Joo, for breach of contract and failure to pay debts. The defendants failed to respond to the complaint, and a default judgment was entered against them. The plaintiff has since tried to collect the debt by issuing a writ of execution, which led to the levy of approximately $53,779.91 from Ji Young Joo's bank accounts. Ji Young Joo has filed a claim of exemption, which is currently being disputed by the plaintiff. The court has continued the hearing on the claim of exemption to October 23, 2023, to be heard concurrently with Ji Young Joo's motion to set aside the default judgment and motion to recall and quash the writ of execution. The court notes that the notice of opposition to the claim of exemption does not provide sufficient documentation to support the plaintiff's arguments, and advises the parties to supplement their filings before the next hearing.
