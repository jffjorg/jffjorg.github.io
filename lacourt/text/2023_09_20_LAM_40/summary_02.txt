Here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The case involves a dispute between Eastland Corporation (Plaintiff) and multiple defendants, including La Galbi, Inc. and Ji Young Joo, over a debt of $55,702.51. The Plaintiff filed a complaint in 2009, and a default judgment was entered against the defendants in 2010. In 2020, the Plaintiff applied for a renewal of judgment, and in 2023, a writ of execution was issued. The defendant Ji Young Joo made a claim of exemption, which is currently being heard by the Court.

The Court has continued the hearing on the claim of exemption to October 23, 2023, to be heard concurrently with a motion to set aside default judgment and a motion to recall and quash the writ of execution. The Court notes that the notice of opposition to the claim of exemption does not provide sufficient documentation to support the Plaintiff's opposition. The parties are advised to supplement their filings in support of or opposition to the claim of exemption before the next hearing.

The Court's ruling is based on the Code of Civil Procedure, specifically sections 695.010, 699.510, 703.510, 703.520, 703.530, 703.570, and 703.580. The Court's decision will depend on the validity of the claim of exemption and the default judgment, as well as the parties' compliance with the relevant laws and procedures.

The case BC419058, scheduled for a hearing on September 20, 2023 in the Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles, Department 40, involves the Plaintiff Eastland Corporation and multiple Defendants, including Ji Young Joo. The Plaintiff filed a complaint on July 31, 2009, alleging claims of breach of contract, open book account, account stated, goods sold and delivered, and statutory damages on dishonored checks. The claims arose from an agreement for the purchase of goods, specifically fresh and frozen meat products, between the Plaintiff and Defendants. The Defendants allegedly failed to pay their debt or provided checks that bounced for insufficient funds, resulting in damages to the Plaintiff in the amount of $55,702.51.

On November 13, 2009, the Plaintiff secured an entry of default against all Defendants except for Tae Hwan Joo and Moon Kwon Joo. On January 28, 2010, the Plaintiff filed a complete default judgment packet against the Defaulted Defendants, and the Court entered judgment against them. On January 21, 2020, the Plaintiff applied for a renewal of judgment, which was granted. On June 15, 2023, the Plaintiff filed a memorandum of costs after judgment and applied for, and was issued, a writ of execution for a money judgment. On July 21, 2023, Defendant Ji Young Joo received notice that approximately $53,779.91 had been taken out of seven bank accounts held by her at Bank of America.

On July 31, 2023, Defendant Ji Young Joo made an ex parte application to recall and quash the writ of execution. The ex parte application also informed the Court that Defendant Joo had set a formal motion to set aside default judgment in this matter for hearing on October 23, 2023. The Court denied the ex parte application but calendared a hearing on the same relief for October 23, 2023, to be heard concurrently with the motion to set aside default judgment.

On August 16, 2023, Collect Access LLC filed and served a notice of hearing on a claim of exemption made by Defendant Ji Young Joo. The claim of exemption is now before the Court. According to the legal standard, all property of the judgment debtor is subject to enforcement of a money judgment, unless it is exempt as provided in Code of Civil Procedure sections 703.510 to 703.610. The debtor must make the claim within 15 days of the date the notice of levy on the property was served.

The claim must be executed under oath and include the name and mailing address of the claimant, a description of the property claimed to be exempt, a financial statement as required by section 703.530, a citation of the statute on which the claim is based, and a statement of facts necessary to support the claim. The financial statement must be executed under oath by the judgment debtor and the debtor’s spouse, and include information about the assets, earnings, and outstanding obligations of the judgment debtor and the spouse and dependents of the judgment debtor.

The hearing on the motion shall be held not later than 30 days from the date the notice of motion was filed with the court unless continued by the court for good cause. The claim of exemption is deemed controverted by the notice of opposition to the claim of exemption and both shall be received in evidence. If not satisfied, the court shall order the hearing continued for the production of other evidence, oral or documentary. At the hearing on the claim of exception, the claimant has the burden of proof.

The Court CONTINUES the hearing on the claim of exemption to 8:30 on October 23, 2023. A concurrent hearing for the motion to set aside default judgment, motion to recall and quash writ of execution (briefed as an ex parte application), and the claim of exemption is the best use of judicial resources. The notice of opposition to claim of exemption does not attach any documents showing the financial statement with which Plaintiff takes issue nor any other documents that will assist the Court to make a proper determination as to the claim.
