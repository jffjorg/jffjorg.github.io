And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's request for a default judgment against the defendant, Max D. Edlin. The plaintiff, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., issued a credit card account to the defendant, who failed to make payments on the account. The plaintiff filed a complaint alleging a cause of action for common counts and sought $53,797.85 in damages. The plaintiff waived prejudgment interest.

The judge found that the plaintiff's proof of service is defective because it lacks a declaration of mailing by the commercial mail receiving agency (CMRA) owner or operator, as required by law. The plaintiff did not comply with the requirements for a default judgment, including providing a declaration of service by mail, a certificate of mailing, and other supporting documents.

The judge noted that the plaintiff has properly completed a CIV 100 form and a JUD 100 form and submitted a statement of the case and a supporting declaration, but these are not sufficient to support a default judgment. The judge cited relevant statutes and case law, including Code Civ. Proc. § 585, Code Civ. Proc. § 415.20, Bus. & Prof. Code 17538.5, and CRC Rule 3.1800.

The judge ordered that the plaintiff's request for default judgment be denied, and the case will proceed further.
