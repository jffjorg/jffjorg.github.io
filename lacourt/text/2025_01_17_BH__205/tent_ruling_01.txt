  Case Number:  23SMCV03756    Hearing Date:   January 17, 2025    Dept:  205 Superior Court of CaliforniaCounty of Los Angeles – West DistrictBeverly Hills Courthouse / Department 205TIA BROOKS, et al., Plaintiffs, v. IBRAHIM HUSSEINI, et al., Defendants.Case No.: 23SMCV03756 Hearing Date: January 17, 2025 ORDER RE: SPECIALLY APPEARING DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO QUASH SERVICE OF SUMMONSBACKGROUNDThis case arises from a car accident. On August 11, 2021, Plaintiffs Tia Brooks, Maura Brooks and Michael Jacobs-Sierra were at a complete stop when their car was hit by Defendant Matthew Moore’s car. Plaintiffs claim they sustained numerous and severe injuries as a result of the accident.This hearing is on Defendant’s motion to quash. Defendant argues that contrary to the proof of service, he was not properly served. Defendant argues that he is the only person living at the service address; he was at work in Orange County when the service was purportedly effected, and he does not know the person upon whom substitute service was allegedly made. Accordingly, substitute service on him was ineffective under Code Civ. Proc. § 415.20(b) and § 416.90. There was no opposition filed as of the posting of this tentative ruling.DISCUSSION“Service of process, under longstanding tradition in our system of justice, is fundamental to any procedural imposition on a named defendant.” (AO Alfa-Bank v. Yakovlev (2018) 21 Cal.App.5th 189, 202.) “To establish personal jurisdiction, compliance with statutory procedures for service of process is essential.” (Kremerman v. White (2021). 71 Cal.App.5th 358, 371.)But the statutory requirements are to be liberally construed to uphold jurisdiction, rather than defeat it. (Pasadena Medi-Center Assocs. v. Sup.Ct. (Houts) (1973) 9 Cal.3d 773, 778 (“The provisions of this chapter should be liberally construed to effectuate service and uphold the jurisdiction of the court if actual notice has been received by the defendant, and in the last analysis the question of service should be resolved by considering each situation from a practical standpoint.”)Defendant’s knowledge of the action does not dispense with the statutory requirements for service of summons. (Kappel v. Bartlett (1988) 200 Cal.App.3d 1457, 1466.) However, as long as the defendant receives actual notice of the lawsuit, substantial compliance with the Code provisions governing service of summons will generally be held sufficient. (Summers v. McClanahan (2006) 140 Cal.App.4th 403, 410-411 (“It is well settled that strict compliance with statutes governing service of process is not required. Rather, in deciding whether service was valid, the statutory provisions regarding service of process should be liberally construed to effectuate service and uphold the jurisdiction of the court if actual notice has been received by the defendant.”).)“A defendant, on or before the last day of his or her time to plead or within any further time that the court may for good cause allow” may move “to quash service of summons on the ground of lack of jurisdiction of the court over him or her” that results from lack of properservice. (Code Civ. Proc., §418.10(a)(1). A defendant has 30 days after the service of the summons to file a responsive pleading. (Code Civ. Proc., §412.20(a)(3).)“When a defendant challenges the court’s personal jurisdiction on the ground of improper service of process, ‘the burden is on the plaintiff to prove the existence of jurisdiction by proving, inter alia, the facts requisite to an effective service.’” (Summers, 140 Cal.App.4th at 413.)DISCUSSIONAn individual may be personally served or substitute served. As it relates to substituted service upon individuals, Code Civ. Proc. § 415.20 states as follows: “(b) If a copy of the summons and complaint cannot with reasonable diligence be personally delivered to the person to be served, as specified in Section 416.60, 416.70, 416.80, or 416.90, a summons may be served by leaving a copy of the summons and complaint at the person's dwelling house, usual place of abode, usual place of business, or usual mailing address other than a United States Postal Service post office box, in the presence of a competent member of the household or a person apparently in charge of his or her office, place of business, or usual mailing address other than a United States Postal Service post office box, at least 18 years of age, who shall be informed of the contents thereof, and by thereafter mailing a copy of the summons and of the complaint by first-class mail, postage prepaid to the person to be served at the place where a copy of the summons and complaint were left. Service of a summons in this manner is deemed complete on the 10th day after the mailing.”Here, Defendant claims that substitute service was not properly effected. Defendant concedes that the address indicated in the proof of service is Defendant’s “dwelling house, usual place of abode, and usual mailing address.” However, he claims he was working in Orange County at the time the summons and complaint were allegedly served upon a male at hisresidence. But no other males live at his residence. (Moore Decl. ¶ 6.) Accordingly, Defendant claims it would have been impossible for any documents to have been left with anyone at the home of Matthew Moore on October 9, 2023, at 2:30 pm. (Id. at ¶ 3.)Plaintiff has not opposed the motion or filed any contrary declaration from her registered process server. Plaintiff, therefore, is presumed to have conceded there is no proper service. (See Sehulster Tunnels /Pre-Con v. Traylor Brothers, Inc. (2003) 111 Cal.App.4th 1328, 1345, fn. 16 (failure to address point is “equivalent to a concession”).) Accordingly, the Court grants Defendant’s motion to quash.CONCLUSIONFor the foregoing reasons, the Court GRANTS Defendant Matthew Moore’s motion to quash service of summons.DATED: January 17, 2025
