          This case was
originally assigned to Department 28 of the Spring Street Courthouse and
transferred to Department 3 of the Alhambra Courthouse on April 29, 2024.
Earlier, on January 25, 2024, the Honorable Lisa R. Jaskol granted three
discovery motions filed by defendant Wang’s Golden Enterprises, Inc. dba Golden
Motel (“Defendant”) and ordered Plaintiff Raoul Renfroe to provide further
responses to Defendant’s Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, and
Requests for Production no later than February 23, 2024. The Court also ordered
Plaintiff and counsel of record, Ilan Janfaza (“Janfaza”), to pay sanctions in
the amount of $1,120.00 by February 23, 2024. Plaintiff served supplemental
responses in April 2024 after Defendant filed a motion for terminating
sanctions but has not paid sanctions as ordered. 
On May 9, 2024, Defendant filed this
motion pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 128 to “enforce monetary
sanctions” on Plaintiff and Janfaza. 
No additional court order is necessary
to “enforce” the order imposing sanctions. As explained in Newland v.
Superior Court (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 608, 615, monetary sanction orders
“have the force and effect of a money judgment, and are immediately enforceable
through execution, except to the extent the trial court may order a stay of the
sanction.” 
Accordingly, the motion is DENIED. 
Dated
this 15th
day of July, 2024
