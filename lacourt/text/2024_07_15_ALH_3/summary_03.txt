And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The Court has reviewed the parties' submissions and has made a tentative ruling on the motion to compel further discovery responses. The motion was filed by the plaintiff, Sarah Lopez, seeking an order compelling the defendant, Glen John Apramian, M.D., Inc., to serve further responses to the plaintiff's Form Interrogatories – Employment Law (Set One). The defendant had served objections and supplemental responses, but the plaintiff argues that the supplemental responses are incomplete and do not address each subpart. The Court grants the motion and orders the defendant to serve further supplemental responses within 10 days of the date of this order.

Regarding the plaintiff's request for sanctions, the Court finds that the defendant's failure to comply with its discovery obligations is sufficient to warrant an award of sanctions. However, the Court reduces the amount of sanctions requested by the plaintiff to $900. The Court also declines to award any sanctions in connection with the plaintiff's attempts to meet and confer with the defendant's counsel.

The Court's tentative ruling is subject to submission by the parties and may be adopted as the final order if no opposing submissions are received.
