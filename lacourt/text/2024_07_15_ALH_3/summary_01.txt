And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling regarding a motion to enforce sanctions against the plaintiff, Raoul Renfroe, and his counsel, Ilan Janfaza. The defendant, Golden Motel, filed a motion to enforce the sanctions of $1,120.00, which were ordered by the Honorable Lisa R. Jaskol on January 25, 2024. The plaintiff failed to pay the sanctions as ordered and has not provided further responses to the defendant's discovery motions. The court finds that the sanctions are enforceable as a money judgment and denies the motion to enforce. The parties must email the court to indicate their intention to submit on this tentative ruling, and if they do not, they may still appear at the hearing to argue the matter.
