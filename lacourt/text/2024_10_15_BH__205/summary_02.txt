And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendants' motion to vacate the order dismissing the action and to reconsider the order. The court has reinstated its prior order dismissing the action without prejudice. The judge has concluded that the plaintiff's motion to vacate was not made within a reasonable time and that the court should not have granted the motion. The judge has found that the plaintiff's motion to vacate was untimely and unsupported, and that the plaintiff did not show diligence in bringing the motion. The judge has also found that the plaintiff failed to serve the defendants with the motion to vacate, which is not a requirement for making the motion. The court has concluded that the defendants had standing to challenge the order vacating the dismissal, and that the defendants' motion to quash service was moot given that the defendants had made a general appearance by filing their motion.
