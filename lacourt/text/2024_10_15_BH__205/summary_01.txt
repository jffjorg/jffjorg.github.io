And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for a jury view of the property. The plaintiff argued that a jury view would aid the jury in deciding the case by allowing them to see the layout of the property, including the relative positions of the driveway, slopes, and culvert. However, the judge found that a site visit is unnecessary due to the extensive evidence already available, including photographs, videotapes, and other documents. The judge also noted that the cost and time required to transport the jury, attorneys, and court personnel to the site would be significant, and that the defendant Caltrans would need to remove and then re-install sandbags and other items to allow for the jury view. The judge concluded that the benefits of a jury view do not outweigh the costs and inconvenience.
