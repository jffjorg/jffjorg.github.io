And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion of the plaintiff's attorney, Michael V. Hesse, to be relieved as counsel. The motion was made due to a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship, but the court found that allowing the attorney to withdraw during the upcoming trial would prejudice the plaintiff. The court also noted that the attorney had failed to serve the plaintiff at a confirmed address, as required by law. The judge ordered the attorney to give notice and stated that the motion may be placed off calendar if the opposing party does not submit on the tentative ruling.
