And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by the defendants. The demurrer was filed to challenge the validity of the causes of action in the plaintiff's complaint, which lacks factual allegations and does not specify causes of action. The judge has sustained the demurrer, meaning that the complaint is deemed invalid, and has not given the plaintiff leave to amend the complaint. The judge has also ordered the parties to meet and confer to attempt to resolve the issues that led to the demurrer. A case management conference and order to show cause will be held concurrently with the hearing on the demurrer.
