Claimant opposes, contending, among other things, that he was not served with a deposition subpoena.Discovery procedures available to the parties in uninsured motorist cases are basically the same as those available in California civil litigation, subject to certain limitations. Ins.C. §11580.2(f). One such limitation concerns depositions. In the uninsured motorist context, the deponent's attendance at a deposition must be effected by deposition subpoena under CCP §2025.280(b) rather than by notice of deposition under CCP § 2025.280(a). See Ins.C. §11580.2(f)(4).Any reply to the opposition was due on or before 10/01/24. Respondent has not filed timely reply papers, and the Court will not consider late-filed reply papers.Claimant established he was not served with a subpoena, which is required in the uninsured motorist context.
