Relief SoughtDefendant seeks leave to file a cross-complaint against Plaintiff for breach of contract and account stated. The crux of the proposed cross-complaint is that Plaintiff underperformed per the parties’ contractual obligations in 2020, 2021, and 2022, such that Plaintiff owes Defendant damages.b. Law Governing Leave to File Compulsory Cross-ComplaintCCP §426.30 defines a cross-complaint as “compulsory” if it is pled against the plaintiff and includes claims related to the subject matter of the complaint. CCP §426.50 makes clear that the Court MUST grant a motion for leave to file a compulsory cross-complaint unless it finds the moving party is acting in bad faith.c. AnalysisPlaintiff opposes the motion. The opposition does not contend the compulsory cross-complaint should not be filed, but instead contends that, in the event the Court grants the motion, the trial date needs to be continued to permit Plaintiff to conduct discovery and prepare for trial on the cross-complaint.Trial is currently scheduled for 1/06/25, less than nine months after Defendant filed its answer in this case. The Court finds the request to continue trial is supported, and therefore grants the motion to file a cross-complaint on the condition that the trial date will be continued.
