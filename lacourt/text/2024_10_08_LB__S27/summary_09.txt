Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted a motion filed by Defense Counsel, Delan Valentinov Kazachki, seeking to be relieved as counsel for Defendant, SFO Merchandise, Inc. The court finds that there has been a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship, making it impossible for Counsel to continue representing the Defendant. The motion was unopposed and granted, despite the fact that trial is not scheduled until June 16, 2025, and therefore there is no prejudice to the Defendant.

In response to the motion, the Plaintiff, Pacific Terminal Service Company, LLC, asked for an order requiring Defense Counsel to provide an email address for someone at Defendant on whom Plaintiff can serve all necessary papers. However, the court denied this request, finding no authority to support it.

The judge ordered Defense Counsel to give notice of the ruling and scheduled a status on the new attorney for November 6, 2024. Parties who intend to submit on the tentative ruling must send an email to the court indicating their intention, or they may not be heard at the hearing.
