PARTIES’ REQUESTS 
Plaintiff
requests that the Court enforce a settlement agreement and order Defendants to
pay 10% interest on the settlement amount and attorney's fees. 
Defendants
request that the Court deny the motion. 
LEGAL STANDARD                   
Code
of Civil Procedure section 664.6 provides in part: 
“(a) If parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a
writing signed by the parties outside of the presence of the court or orally
before the court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon
motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement. If
requested by the parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties to
enforce the settlement until performance in full of the terms of the
settlement. 
“(b) For purposes of this section, a writing is signed
by a party if it is signed by any of the following: 
“(1) The party. 
“(2) An attorney who represents the party. 
“(3) If the party is an insurer, an agent who is
authorized in writing by the insurer to sign on the insurer’s behalf.” 
(Code
Civ. Proc., § 664.6, subds. (a), (b).) 
In
deciding motions made under section 664.6, courts “must determine whether the
parties entered into a valid and binding settlement.”  (Kohn v. Jaymar-Ruby (1994) 23 Cal.App.4th
1530, 1533.)  On a motion to enforce a
settlement under section 664.6, courts have the power to decide disputed facts
and to interpret the agreement.  (Fiore
v. Alvord (1985) 182 Cal.App.3d 561, 566; L. Edmon & C. Karnow, Cal.
Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (Rutter 2023) ¶¶ 12:977–12:978.5, pp.
12(ll)-139 to 12(ll)-140.) Courts may receive evidence, determine disputed
facts including the terms the parties previously agreed on, and enter the terms
of a settlement agreement as a judgment, but they may not create new material
terms. (Osumi v. Sutton (2007) 151 Cal.App.4th 1355, 1360.) 
DISCUSSION 
Plaintiff
asserts that he and Defendants entered into an agreement on May 16,
2023, to settle the case in return for Defendant’s payment to him of $119,000.00.  Defendants sent Plaintiff a release
to review.  Plaintiff's counsel proposed modifications
to the release. Defendants have not
responded to the proposed modifications or paid Plaintiff $119,000.  Plaintiff demands $119,000 with 10 percent
interest plus attorney’s fees and costs. 
To
support his contention that the parties agreed to settle the case, Plaintiff has
submitted (1) a May 9, 2023 email from Defendants’ counsel to Plaintiff’s
counsel stating, “Please see below offers in response to Plaintiffs’ demand
made 5/8/23.  Smith -- $119,000 -- full
and final” and (2) a May 16, 2023, email from Plaintiff’s counsel to Defendants’
counsel stating, “Please be advised that Plaintiff Dwain Sibrie-Smith accepts
defendants' offer to settle this matter globally for $119,000.00. Please send
the release.”  
Defendants
deny the existence of an enforceable settlement, asserting Code of Civil
Procedure section 664.6 applies only when the parties themselves, rather than
their lawyers, have signed the settlement agreement.  Defendants are mistaken.  Effective January 1, 2021, the statute
provides: “For purposes of this section, a writing is signed by a party if it
is signed by any of the following: . . . 
(2) An attorney who represents the party.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6, subd. (b).) 
Defendants
also argue that no enforceable settlement agreement exists because the parties
did not agree to all the material terms. 
In particular, Defendants assert the parties have not reached an
agreement about whether the release will include a confidentiality provision. 
“A
settlement is an agreement to terminate or forestall all or part of a lawsuit. .
. . Compromise settlements are governed by the legal principles applicable to
contracts generally.” (Gorman v. Holte (1985) 164 Cal.App.3d 984, 988.)
“The terms of a contract are reasonably certain if they provide a basis for
determining the existence of a breach and for giving an appropriate remedy.” (Moncada
v. West Coast Quartz Corp. (2013) 221 Cal.App.4th 768, 777.) 
“
‘An essential element of any contract is the consent of the parties, or mutual
assent.’ [Citation.] Further, the consent of the parties to a contract must be
communicated by each party to the other. [Citation.] ‘Mutual assent is
determined under an objective standard applied to the outward manifestations or
expressions of the parties, i.e., the reasonable meaning of their words and
acts, and not their unexpressed intentions or understandings.’ [Citation.].” (Serafin
v. Balco Properties Ltd., LLC (2015) 235 Cal.App.4th 165, 173.) "The
test is—did the minds of the parties meet; that a proposal for a contract was
made by one party and accepted by another; that the parties definitely
understood and agreed upon the terms of the contract.” (Kreling v. Walsh
(1947) 77 Cal.App.2d 821, 834; see also Blix Street Records, Inc. v. Cassidy
(2010) 191 Cal.App.4th 39, 48 [“When parties intend that an agreement be
binding, the fact that a more formal agreement must be prepared and executed
does not alter the validity of the agreement”].) 
Here,
the parties agreed to settle Plaintiff’s claims in return for payment of
$119,000. The fact that Defendants’ counsel drafted a formal written release does not dispel the parties' intent to be bound by their email correspondence
agreeing to a settlement.  Similarly, Plaintiff’s counsel’s request that
Defendants’ counsel “send the release” did not condition the settlement on the
execution of a formal release document. 
Defendants
have identified no failure to reach a meeting of the minds on any material
point in the agreement described in Defendants' counsel’s emailed offer and Plaintiff’s
counsel’s emailed acceptance.  Defendants offered, and Plaintiff accepted, a
settlement of Plaintiff’s claims for $119,000.  The terms were “ ‘reasonably certain’ ” such
that they provided a basis to assess the parties' obligations. (See Weddington
Productions, Inc. v. Flick (1998) 60 Cal.App.4th 793, 811.)  Therefore, the Court grants the motion. 
Plaintiff
does not identify the legal authority for his request for 10 percent interest on the
settlement amount of $119,000.00 from May 16, 2023, through the date of the
Court’s order.  Civil Code section 3287
authorizes an award of 7 percent prejudgment interest when “the right to
recover [damages certain, or capable of being made certain] . . . is vested in
the person upon a particular day . . . .” 
(Civ. Code, § 3287, subd. (a).)  Plaintiff
has not shown that he was entitled to receive the settlement amount on a
particular day.  Therefore,
the Court denies the request for prejudgment interest. 
The
Court also denies the request for attorney's fees.  Plaintiff seeks attorney's fees based on a
clause in the release, which the parties have not signed and which the Court is
not enforcing. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court GRANTS Plaintiff Dwain Sibrie-Smith’s motion
to enforce the settlement agreement reached by the parties on May 16, 2023. 
The Court DENIES Plaintiff Dwain Sibrie-Smith’s request
for prejudgment interest. 

The
Court DENIES Plaintiff Dwain Sibrie-Smith’s request for attorney’s fees.
