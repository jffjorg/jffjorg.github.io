And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the motion to enforce the settlement agreement reached by the parties on May 16, 2023. The agreement was reached through email correspondence between the parties, in which they agreed to settle the case in return for payment of $119,000. The judge finds that the parties did not agree on the confidentiality provision, but this does not invalidate the settlement agreement. The judge also finds that the parties did not execute a formal written release, but this does not dispel their intent to be bound by their email correspondence.

The judge denies the request for 10% interest on the settlement amount, as the plaintiff did not identify the legal authority for this request. The judge also denies the request for attorney's fees, as the parties did not agree on these fees in their settlement agreement.

The judgment grants the plaintiff's motion to enforce the settlement agreement and orders the defendants to pay the settlement amount. The judgment also denies the plaintiff's requests for prejudgment interest and attorney's fees.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the motions, oppositions, and replies filed in this case and has made a tentative ruling. The case involves a dispute over whether a settlement agreement was reached between the plaintiff, Dwain Sibrie-Smith, and the defendants, Drop N Go Deliveries, Amazon Logistics, Inc., Mary Roberts, William Roberts, Adolfo Mendez, and Does 1-50.

The plaintiff claims that on May 16, 2023, he and the defendants reached an agreement to settle the case for $119,000. However, the defendants deny that a valid and binding settlement agreement was reached. The judge has reviewed the emails exchanged between the parties and has found that they did intend to be bound by the agreement, despite the fact that a formal release document was not signed.

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to enforce the settlement agreement and has ordered the defendants to pay $119,000. However, the judge has denied the plaintiff's request for 10% interest on the settlement amount and has also denied his request for attorney's fees.

The judge has found that the parties did not agree on the material terms of the settlement agreement, including whether the release would include a confidentiality provision. However, the judge has determined that the parties did intend to be bound by the agreement and that the terms were "reasonably certain" such that they provided a basis for determining the parties' obligations.

Overall, the judge has concluded that the settlement agreement is enforceable and has ordered the defendants to pay the plaintiff the agreed-upon amount.
