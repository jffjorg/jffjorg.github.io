And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the motion to enforce the settlement agreement reached by the parties on May 16, 2023. The agreement was reached through email correspondence between the parties, in which they agreed to settle the case in return for payment of $119,000. The judge finds that the parties did not agree on the confidentiality provision, but this does not invalidate the settlement agreement. The judge also finds that the parties did not execute a formal written release, but this does not dispel their intent to be bound by their email correspondence.

The judge denies the request for 10% interest on the settlement amount, as the plaintiff did not identify the legal authority for this request. The judge also denies the request for attorney's fees, as the parties did not agree on these fees in their settlement agreement.

The judgment grants the plaintiff's motion to enforce the settlement agreement and orders the defendants to pay the settlement amount. The judgment also denies the plaintiff's requests for prejudgment interest and attorney's fees.
