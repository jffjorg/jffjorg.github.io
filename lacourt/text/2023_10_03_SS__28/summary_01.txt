And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the applications for default judgment filed by the Plaintiffs. The Court has considered the documents submitted in support of the applications and has ruled as follows.

The Plaintiffs have filed four applications for default judgment, seeking a total of $14,700,000 in damages. The Court has denied the applications without prejudice, citing several reasons.

First, the Court has not confirmed that the Defendant was served with statements of damages informing the Defendant of the damages that each Plaintiff is seeking. Second, the Court has not been provided with evidence of the Defendant's financial condition, which is a prerequisite to an award of punitive damages. Third, the Court has not been provided with a declaration for each CIV-100 form, as required by law.

The Court has also noted that the Plaintiffs have not demonstrated that they have met the requirements for a default judgment, including the requirement that the Defendant be served with a statement of damages. Finally, the Court has noted that the Plaintiffs' forms do not accurately reflect the amounts of damages that they are seeking, and that the Court cannot grant the requests for punitive damages on this record.

The Court has ordered the Plaintiffs to give notice of this ruling, and has denied the applications for default judgment without prejudice.

## English Text Summary:

The judge's tentative ruling denies the Plaintiffs' applications for default judgment against Defendant Dale Alan Deinstein.  

The judge states that while Plaintiffs have filed the necessary paperwork, they haven't adequately demonstrated that Defendant was properly notified of the specific damages each Plaintiff is seeking. This includes potential punitive damages. The judge also points out that Plaintiffs failed to provide evidence of Defendant's financial condition, which is necessary to award punitive damages. 

The judge denies the applications without prejudice, meaning Plaintiffs can re-file their requests once they address these issues.

Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the documents submitted by the plaintiffs in support of their applications for default judgment. The plaintiffs are seeking damages from the defendant, Dale Alan Deinstein, for alleged assault, battery, and intentional infliction of emotional distress.

The judge notes that the plaintiffs have filed four CIV-100 forms and four JUD-100 forms, but only one declaration. The judge finds that the plaintiffs have not adequately notified the defendant of the damages they are seeking, as evidenced by the fact that the statement of damages served on the defendant does not address each of the four plaintiffs' claimed damages.

Furthermore, the judge finds that the plaintiffs have not provided sufficient evidence of the defendant's financial condition, which is a prerequisite to an award of punitive damages. The judge therefore denies the applications for default judgment without prejudice, meaning that the plaintiffs may re-file their applications if they can provide the necessary evidence.

The judge also orders the plaintiffs to give notice of this ruling.
