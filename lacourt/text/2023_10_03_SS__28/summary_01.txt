And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the applications for default judgment filed by the Plaintiffs. The Court has considered the documents submitted in support of the applications and has ruled as follows.

The Plaintiffs have filed four applications for default judgment, seeking a total of $14,700,000 in damages. The Court has denied the applications without prejudice, citing several reasons.

First, the Court has not confirmed that the Defendant was served with statements of damages informing the Defendant of the damages that each Plaintiff is seeking. Second, the Court has not been provided with evidence of the Defendant's financial condition, which is a prerequisite to an award of punitive damages. Third, the Court has not been provided with a declaration for each CIV-100 form, as required by law.

The Court has also noted that the Plaintiffs have not demonstrated that they have met the requirements for a default judgment, including the requirement that the Defendant be served with a statement of damages. Finally, the Court has noted that the Plaintiffs' forms do not accurately reflect the amounts of damages that they are seeking, and that the Court cannot grant the requests for punitive damages on this record.

The Court has ordered the Plaintiffs to give notice of this ruling, and has denied the applications for default judgment without prejudice.
