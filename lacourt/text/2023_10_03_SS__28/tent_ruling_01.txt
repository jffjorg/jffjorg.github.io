LEGAL STANDARD 
A.      Default judgment 
“[With exceptions that do not apply here,] [a] party
seeking a default judgment on declarations must use mandatory Request for Entry
of Default (Application to Enter Default) (form CIV-100) . . . The following
must be included in the documents filed with the clerk: 
“(1)  Except in
unlawful detainer cases, a brief summary of the case identifying the parties
and the nature of plaintiff's claim; 
“(2)  Declarations
or other admissible evidence in support of the judgment requested; 
“(3)  Interest
computations as necessary; 
“(4)  A
memorandum of costs and disbursements; 
“(5)  A
declaration of nonmilitary status for each defendant against whom judgment is
sought; 
“(6)  A proposed
form of judgment; 
“(7)  A
dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application
for separate judgment against specified parties under Code of Civil Procedure
section 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment; 
“(8)  Exhibits
as necessary; and 
“(9)  A request
for attorney fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.” 
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1800(a).) 
B.       Damages 
          On a request for default judgment, “[w]here a cause of
action is stated in the complaint, plaintiff merely needs to introduce evidence
establishing a prima facie case for damages.” 
(L. Edmon & C. Karnow, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before
Trial (Rutter 2023) ¶ 5:213.1, p. 5-56 (Cal. Practice Guide: Procedure), citing
Johnson v. Stanhiser (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 357, 361 [trial court erred
in applying preponderance of the evidence standard].) 
          The relief granted to a plaintiff upon entry of a
defendant's default cannot exceed the amount demanded in the complaint or, for
personal injury cases where damages may not be stated in the complaint, the
amount listed in the statement of damages. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 580, subd. (a),
585, subd. (b).) “The notice requirement of section 580 was designed to insure fundamental
fairness.” (Becker v. S.P.V. Construction Co. (1980) 27 Cal.3d 489, 494
(Becker).) The statute insures that “defendants in cases which involve a
default judgment have adequate notice of the judgments that may be taken against
them. [Citation.] ‘If a judgment other than that which is demanded is taken
against him, [the defendant] has been deprived of his day in court—a right to a
hearing on the matter adjudicated.’ ’’ (Id. at p. 493.)  A trial court
exceeds its jurisdiction if it awards damages in excess of the amount specified
in the complaint or statement of damages. (Id. at p. 494; see Cal.
Practice Guide: Procedure, supra, ¶ 5:258, p. 5-70.) 
The
court “shall hear the evidence offered by the plaintiff, and shall render
judgment in the plaintiff’s favor for that relief, not exceeding the amount
stated in the complaint, in the statement required by Section 425.11, or in the
statement provided for by Section 425.115, as appears by the evidence to be
just. If the taking of an account, or the proof of any fact, is necessary to
enable the court to give judgment or to carry the judgment into effect, the
court may take the account or hear the proof . . . .”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 585, subd. (b).) 
DISCUSSION 
Plaintiffs
filed a proof of service showing a statement of damages was served on Defendant
on August 22, 2022.  However, the Court does
not know if the statement of damages served on Defendant addressed each of the
four Plaintiffs’ claimed damages or if it included notice of Plaintiffs' claims for punitive damages.  The
Court cannot grant a request for default judgment without first confirming that
Defendant was served with statements of damages informing Defendant of the
damages that each Plaintiff is seeking.  
Plaintiffs
filed four CIV-100 forms and four JUD-100 forms, but only one declaration. Plaintiffs must file one declaration for each
CIV-100 form.  As the guardian ad litem,
Christopher Dillon may submit declarations for Samantha Eva Dillon and Vivian Christine Dillon if he deems it
appropriate. 
The
forms for Samantha Eva Dillon and Vivian
Christine Dillon should be revised to reflect that they are appearing by and
through their guardian ad litem Christopher Dillon. Christopher Dillon's declaration states that each Plaintiff is seeking $2.5 million in punitive damages.  (Evidently that amount is part of the $3.5 million listed as "general damages" in Plaintiffs' forms.)  However, Plaintiffs have submitted no evidence of Defendant's financial condition, which is a prerequisite to an award of punitive damages on which Plaintiffs bear the burden of proof.  (See Del Junco v. Hufnagel (2007) 150 Cal.App.4th 789, 791 [reversing default judgment's punitive damage award because record contained no proof of defendant's financial condition].)  The Court cannot grant the requests for punitive damages on this record. 
For
the reasons stated above, the Court denies the applications. 
CONCLUSION 
The Court
DENIES without prejudice Plaintiff Martha Dillon's application for default judgment filed on
August 8, 2023.
