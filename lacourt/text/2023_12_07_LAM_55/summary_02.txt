The plaintiff, SUITS AMERICA, INC., alleges that the defendants, NEDA MENSWEAR, INC., PEYMAN ELYASI, and LEO MANI, INC., fraudulently induced them into agreements for the sale of their products by presenting fraudulent checks. The defendants contend that the plaintiff fails to state sufficient facts regarding the claims and request for punitive damages.

The Judge finds that the complaint adequately alleges the who, what, when, and where needed for a promissory fraud claim and that the claims are sufficiently pled. The Judge also finds that there is no basis to strike allegations regarding punitive damages.

The ruling is significant because it allows the plaintiff to proceed with their claims and potentially recover punitive damages. The defendants have 20 days to respond to the ruling.
