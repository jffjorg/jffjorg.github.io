And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the unopposed motion filed by Wells Fargo seeking to be discharged from liability and dismissed from the case. Wells Fargo holds the disputed funds of $40,000, which were transferred from EZ DASH's account to Wells Fargo's account. The dispute arises from EZ DASH's claim that the transfer was authorized by RONALD COOPER, whereas COOPER claims that the transfer was unauthorized.

Wells Fargo has requested an order discharging it from liability and dismissing it from the case, after deducting its costs and reasonable attorneys' fees from the disputed funds. The court has found that the motion is based on sufficient grounds for an interpleader complaint, as Wells Fargo is a disinterested holder of the funds in dispute.

The court has discretion to award Wells Fargo its costs and reasonable attorney fees out of the deposited amount, and has granted the motion as prayed. The court has also ordered that an additional $644.00 be deducted from the interpleaded funds, which represents a low-end estimate of the anticipated attorneys' fees and costs to be incurred by Wells Fargo.
