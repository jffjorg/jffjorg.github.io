 Case Number:  22STCV37566    Hearing Date:   December 7, 2023    Dept:  55 NATURE OF PROCEEDINGS:  MOTION FOR ORDER DISCHARGING
PLAINTIFF-STAKEHOLDER WELLS FARGO FROM LIABILITY.
 
The unopposed motion is granted, as prayed.  CCP  §
386.
 
 
On 11/30/22, Plaintiff filed a COMPLAINT FOR
INTERPLEADER, alleging that defendant EZ DASH contends that a wire of $40,000
to its WELLS FARGO account was authorized by Defendant RONALD COOPER and
intended to be deposited to the EZ Account, but COOPER contends that the wire
was initiated without his authorization.
On 1/23/23, Defendant COOPER filed a Cross-Complaint
against EZ DASH, for CONVERSION, 
alleging that he discovered that he was the victim of a scam done by
phone calls, which had convinced him to transfer the money.
Moving party requests an order discharging it from
liability and dismissing it, after a deposit of $40,000.00, minus the costs and
reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred by Wells Fargo in this action, on grounds
including the following: 

Wells Fargo
     holds the funds claimed by both defendants in this action, and the bank is
     a mere stakeholder and does not assert any interest in the disputed funds.
     See Cal. Code of Civ. Proc. §§ 386 and 386.6. 
Wells Fargo
     advised EZDASH concerning Mr. Cooper’s demand for return of the Proceeds;
     however, EZDASH insisted that it was entitled to retain the proceeds.
     (Comp. ¶ 10; Rose Decl. ¶ 9.)
Wells Fargo
     is indifferent as to which defendant will ultimately obtain the disputed
     funds.
The bank is
     unable to determine, without exposure to double or multiple liability,
     whose claims are valid. 
Wells Fargo
     requests that a total of $14,198.44 be deducted from the amount of deposit
     with the Court. (Rapkine Decl. ¶ 7.) 
     Wells Fargo’s total fees and costs through the end of May 2023 are
     $13,554.44. (Rapkine Decl. ¶¶ 3-5; Exh. A [Invoices].) Wells Fargo also
     requests that an additional $644.00 be deducted from the interpleaded
     funds, which represents a low-end estimate of the anticipated attorneys’
     fees and costs to be incurred through the date that Wells Fargo can exit
     this action. (Rapkine Decl. ¶ 6.)  

The Court finds that the motion is based upon
sufficient grounds for an interpleader complaint, including Plaintiff’s being a
disinterested holder of funds in dispute by others.
After a stakeholder’s right to interplead is shown,
and the money over which conflicting claims have been made, is deposited with
the court, the stakeholder may be discharged from liability.  E.g., City of Morgan Hill v. Brown
(1999) 71 Cal.App.4th 1114, 1122.
In an interpleader proceeding, when discharging a
stakeholder, judges have discretion to award them their costs and reasonable
attorney fees out of an amount that has been deposited with the court.  Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. v. Zinnel
(2004) 125 Cal. App. 4th 393, 400;  Canal
Ins. Co. v. Tackett (2004) 117 Cal. App. 4th 239, 244;  UAP-Columbus JV 236132 v. Nesbitt
(1991) 234 Cal.App.3d 1028, 1036.   The
amount of attorney fees and costs must be restricted to those incurred as to
the interpleader remedy.  Sweeney v.
McClaran (1976) 58 Cal.App.3d 824, 830. Here, the declaration of counsel
Michael Rapkine and the attached invoices establishes that the fees and costs
sought by Wells Fargo are reasonable. The Court therefore will sign the
proposed order granting the motion that Wells Fargo submitted.
