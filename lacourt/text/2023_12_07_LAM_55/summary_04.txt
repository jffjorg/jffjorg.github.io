And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion by Decron Properties Corporation (Defendant) to compel further responses from Ali Maadarani (Plaintiff) regarding document request number 15 seeking medical records. The Defendant is also requesting $1,460.00 in sanctions. In response, the Plaintiff claims that the motion is moot because they served further responses late, on November 20, 2023, except for requiring verification and sanctions. However, the Plaintiff failed to file an opposition to the motion. The judge grants the motion, in part, ordering the Plaintiff to serve a verification for the further responses by January 8, 2024. The judge also denies the separate request for sanctions, citing that sanctions in the amount of $1,000.00 were previously ordered against both parties and finds that amount sufficient for all discovery motions.
