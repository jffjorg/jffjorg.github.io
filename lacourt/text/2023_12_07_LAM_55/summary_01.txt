The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the plaintiff's motion to quash or modify employment subpoenas issued by the defendant to Health Nut, Allied Universal Security Services, and Ipic Theaters, LLC, as well as a request for monetary sanctions. The judge has granted the motion, except for sanctions, and has quashed the defendant's subpoenas.

The judge has expected the parties to fully explore the option of entering into a protective order to keep any documents produced confidential.
