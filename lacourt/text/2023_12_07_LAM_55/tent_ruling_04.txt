 Case Number:  23STCV01492    Hearing Date:   December 7, 2023    Dept:  55 NATURE OF PROCEEDINGS:  Motion of Defendant and Cross-Complainant
Decron Properties Corporation to Compel Plaintiff Ali Maadarani’s Further
Responses to Request for Production of Documents, Set One, and Request for
Monetary Sanctions in the Amount of $1,460.00.



DECRON PROPERTIES CORPORATION  (“Defendant”) filed a motion to compel
further responses from Plaintiff Ali Maadarani, as to document request number
15 seeking medical records regarding Complaint allegations.  Additionally,
Defendant requests $1,460.00 in sanctions. The reply filed
11/29/23 states that the motion is moot because Plaintiff served further
responses late, on November 20, 2023, except as to requiring verification and
sanctions.  The reply makes reference to an opposition by ALI
MAADARANI; however, no such opposition is in the court file.
The Court therefore GRANTS the motion, in part, as follows:
On or before 1/8/24, Plaintiff ALI MAADARANI shall serve a verification
for the further responses to the document requests he served on November 20,
2023.

The Court previously ordered sanctions of $1,000.00 against both plaintiffs for
an absence of substantial justification with regards to the form
interrogatories and finds that that sanctions amount is sufficient as to all the
discovery motions against Plaintiffs. The Court therefore exercises its
discretion to deny the separate request for sanctions for this motion.
