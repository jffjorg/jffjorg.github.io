 Case Number:  22STCV36583    Hearing Date:   December 7, 2023    Dept:  55 NATURE OF PROCEEDINGS:  Defendants’ Demurrer to Plaintiff’s Complaint;  Defendants’ Motion to Strike Plaintiff’s
Complaint.
 
The demurrer is overruled.  The motion to strike is denied.  Twenty days to answer. 
 
 
On 11/18/22,  SUITS
AMERICA, INC. (“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint against NEDA MENSWEAR, INC., PEYMAN
ELYASI and LEO MANI, INC. (“defendants”), alleging that defendants fraudulently
induced Plaintiff into agreements for the sale of Plaintiff’s products, by fraudulently
representing that they would pay, by delivering certain checks drawn from
accounts having no funds.  The causes of
action are:  Common Counts, Promissory
Fraud, and Fraudulent Uttering and Delivery of Check or Drafts in Violation of
California Penal Code §476a.
Defendants have filed a demurrer to the Complaint’s
Fourth and Fifth Causes of Action, and a motion to strike allegations regarding
punitive damages, contending that Plaintiff fails to state sufficient facts regarding
the claims and request for punitive damages and/or that the allegations are
uncertain. Defendants contend that (1) Plaintiff fails to allege with certainty
the specifics as to each named defendant as to “how, when, where and to whom”
representations were made, (2)  the
allegations fail to include a copy of the alleged checks which were drawn on an
account that had no funds or to provide facts as to why Plaintiff believes the
checks were drawn on accounts that had no funds, (3) the complaint draws the
conclusion without providing any facts or representations as to what was said
or done by any of the defendants that showed any of the defendants did not have
any intention to enter into the alleged agreement with Plaintiff or a specific
representation that Plaintiff reasonably relied upon,  and (4) Plaintiff’s claim for punitive
damages fails to identify which of the defendants made the alleged
misrepresentations, when they were said and who it was said to (see Smith v.
Superior Court (1992) 10 Cal. App. 4th 1033, 1042). 
Plaintiff opposes the motion, arguing (1) The method
employed to induce Plaintiff to sell merchandise was defendants’ presentation
of fraudulent checks to Plaintiff, (2) defendants must have further knowledge
of their own fraudulent scheme (see Tarmann vs. State Farm Mutual Auto
Insurance Company (1991) 2 Cal.App.4th 153, 158),  (3)  issuing
the fraudulent checks infers that defendants never intended to enter into a
valid agreement but intended to perpetrate larceny by trick;  (4) the allegations support promissory fraud
and larceny in support of punitive damages, (5) Plaintiff should be afforded
the opportunity to determine through discovery the basis for punitive damages.
 
Demurrer
 
To sufficiently plead a promissory fraud claim,
complaints must state facts as to how, when, where, to whom, and by what means
representations were made.  Beckwith
v. Dahl (2012) 205 Cal.App.4th 1039, 1060. 

Also, complainants “‘must specifically allege and
prove … that the promisor did not intend to perform at the time he or she made
the promise and that it was intended to deceive or induce the promisee to do or
not do a particular thing.’”  Building
Permit Consultants, Inc. v. Mazur (2004) 122 Cal. App. 4th 1400, 1414.  A cause of action for promissory fraud must
include specific factual circumstances from which a contemporaneous intent not
to perform can be inferred.  Hills
Transportation Co. v. Southwest Forest Ind., Inc. (1968) 266 Cal.App.2d
702, 707.  But see Beckwith v. Dahl (2012) 205 Cal.App.4th 1039,
1060  (falsity of a promise is
sufficiently pled with a general allegation that the promise was made without
an intent to perform);  Cicone v.  URS Corp.  (1986) 183 Cal.App.3d 194, 206 (fraudulent
intent may be alleged merely as a conclusion); 
Universal By-Products, Inc. v. City of Modesto  (1974) 43 Cal. App. 3d 145, 151 (“[I]n
pleading a fraud action based on the alleged falsity of a representation or of
a promise … it is not necessary to allege the circumstantial evidence ….  The only essential allegation is the general
statement that the representation or promise was false and that the defendant
knew it to be false at the time it was made.”).
Intent to defraud can be based upon reasonable
inferences.  Miller v. National
American Life Ins. Co. (1976) 54 Cal. App. 3d 331, 338 (“‘[B]ecause the
real intent of the parties and
the facts of a fraudulent transaction are peculiarly in the knowledge of those
sought to be charged with fraud, proof indicative of fraud may come by
inference from circumstances surrounding the transaction, the relationship, and
interest of the parties.’").
Here, the Complaint adequately alleges the who, what,
when, and where needed for a promissory fraud claim. It specifies facts as to
how the alleged misrepresentations were made (Defendants Neda and Elyasi
delivering checks to Plaintiffs), when (on and around August 2019), where (1208
South Santee Street, Los Angeles, ), to whom (Plaintiff), and by what means Defendants
made the representations  (checks) (e.g.,
Complaint, ¶¶ 5, 19-20, 26).
Additionally, the Complaint alleges more than contract
breaches, but also repeated payments with checks communicating payments to
Plaintiff, as to which sufficient funds did not exist, which reasonably infers
a repeated intent not to pay as represented for each sale.  
As for Defendants’ argument that the claims are impermissibly
uncertain, defendants presumptively would have access to additional details,
such as any checks they issued to Plaintiff. 
Bacon v.
Wahrhaftig
(1950) 97 Cal. App. 2d 599, 605 (“A demurrer for uncertainty will not lie where
the ambiguous facts alleged are presumptively within the knowledge of the
demurring party.”)  
Therefore, the claims are sufficiently pled and the
Court overrules the demurrer.
 
Motion to Strike
 
Defendants err in advocating more specific facts in
support of punitive damages, because ultimate facts are required.
“In order to survive a motion to strike an allegation
of punitive damages, the ultimate facts showing an entitlement to such relief
must be pled by a plaintiff.”  Clauson
v. Sup. Ct. (1998) 67 Cal. App. 4th 1253, 1255.  Accord
Spinks v. Equity Residential Briarwood Apartments (2009) 171 Cal. App. 4th
1004, 1055;  Blegen v. Sup. Ct. 
(1981) 125 Cal.App.3d 959, 962.The Smith opinion cited in the motion
disapproved conclusory facts. Conclusory allegations, devoid of any factual
assertions, are insufficient to support a conclusion that parties acted with
oppression, fraud or malice.  Smith v.
Sup. Ct. (1992) 10 Cal. App. 4th 1033, 1042.But this case does not contain conclusory facts with no factual assertions.
Here, the Complaint sufficiently alleges ultimate facts of promissory fraud, as
analyzed with regard to the demurrer. Furthermore, punitive damages may be
awarded on the theory of promissory fraud. Glendale Fed. Sav. & Loan
Assn. v. Marina View Heights Dev. Co. (1977) 66 Cal. App. 3d 101, 133.
Therefore, there is no basis to strike allegations
regarding punitive damages.
