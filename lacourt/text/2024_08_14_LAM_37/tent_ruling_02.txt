Background
 
On January 9, 2024,
Vetsnap, Inc. (“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint against Gregory Schimpff
(“Defendant”) and Does 1 to 10. 
 
On April 17, 2024, the operative Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”)
was filed alleging nine causes of action: 
1)    
Fraudulent Inducement; 
2)    
Fraud by Intentional
Misrepresentation, 
3)    
Fraud by Concealment; 
4)    
Breach of Fiduciary Duty; 
5)    
Negligent
Misrepresentation; 
6)    
Promissory Estoppel; 
7)    
Illegal Use of Domain (Pen.
Code, § 502);
8)    
Intentional Interference
with Contractual Relations; and
9)    
Negligent Interference with
Prospective Economic Advantage.
Defendant now demurs to the SAC. Plaintiff opposes the Motion. The
matter is now before the court. 
 
Demurrer[1]
 
I.         Legal Standard
 
Where pleadings are defective, a party may raise the defect
by way of a demurrer. (Coyne v. Krempels (1950) 36 Cal.2d 257, 262.) A
demurrer tests the sufficiency of a pleading, and the grounds for a demurrer
must appear on the face of the pleading or from judicially noticeable matters.¿
(CCP, § 430.30(a); Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) In
evaluating a demurrer, the court accepts the complainant’s properly pled facts
as true and ignores contentions, deductions, and conclusory statements. (Daar
v. Yellow Cab Co. (1976) 67 Cal.2d 695, 713; Serrano v. Priest (1971)
5 Cal.3d 584, 591.) Moreover, the court does not consider whether a plaintiff
will be able to prove the allegations or the possible difficulty in making such
proof. (Fisher v. San Pedro Peninsula Hospital (1989) 214 Cal.App.3d
590, 604.) 
Leave to amend must be allowed
where there is a reasonable possibility of successful amendment. (Goodman v.
Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.)¿ The burden is on the complainant to
show the Court that a pleading can be amended successfully. (Ibid.)
 
II.        Discussion
 
The SAC alleges in 2019 and 2020, Defendant along with his friend
Yangyang Shi (“Shi”) and Steven Elliot (“Elliot”) launched  Vetsnap Corporation (“Plaintiff”). (SAC, ¶
2.) In the months leading up to the founding of Plaintiff corporation,
Defendant misrepresented his skills, experience, willingness to work, and
industry relationships. (Id., ¶¶ 22-23.) Based on Defendant’s
representations, Shi and Elliot agreed to co-found Vetsnap with Defendant and
provide him with a $100,000 per year salary and more than 3,000,000 shares of
the new company. (Id., ¶¶ 33-39, Ex. 1 .) 
 
The SAC alleges that in the 27 months that Defendant worked for
Plaintiff, he was willfully negligent in all areas he had boasted strength and
underperformed and failed to advance sales and ruled valuable sales
opportunities. (SAC, ¶¶ 37-70.) By the summer of 2022, Defendant admitted that
he was unable to perform major marketing for Plaintiff. (Id, ¶¶ 59-61,
88.) Defendant initially agreed to a smooth transition out for Plaintiff but
later refused to follow through on the agreement before quitting on October 27,
2022. (Id., ¶¶ 91-96.)
 
After Defendant quit Plaintiff’s employment, he logged into
Plaintiff’s Adobe Acrobat Sign account using his company email and a personal
password and proceed to terminate Plaintiff’s Adobe Acrobat Sign account, resulting
in Adobe contacting all of Plaintiff’s vendors to inform them that the
contracts were being terminated. (SAC, ¶ 97.) Plaintiff owned the Adobe Acrobat
Sign account and Defendant did not have permission to access the account after
his departure. (Id., ¶ 98.) “Vetsnap had to spend substantial time and
resources to rectify the situation.” (Id.)
Defendant now demurs to the eighth and ninth causes of action for
Intentional Interference with Contractual Relations (“IICR”) and Negligent
Interference with Prospective Economic Advantage (“NIPEA”). 
 
A.        Eighth
Cause of Action - Intentional Interference with Contractual Relations (“IICR”)
 
“The
elements of a cause of action for intentional interference with contractual
relations are ‘(1) the existence of a valid contract between the plaintiff and
a third party; (2) the defendant’s knowledge of that contract; (3) the
defendant’s intentional acts designed to induce a breach or disruption of the
contractual relationship; (4)  actual
breach or disruption of the contractual relationship; and (5) resulting
damage.’ ” (Redfearn v. Trader Joe's Co. (2018) 20 Cal.App.5th 989, 997,
citing Reeves v. Hanlon(2004) 33 Cal.4th 1140, 1148.)¿ 
 
“Because
interference with an existing contract receives greater solicitude than does
interference with prospective economic advantage, it is not necessary that the
defendant’s conduct be wrongful apart from the interference with the contract
itself.” (Quelimane Co. v. Stewart Title Guaranty Co. (1998) 19
Cal.4th 26, 55 (Quelimane) [internal citations omitted]; see also CACI
2201.) 
 
For IICR, the SAC alleges that
Plaintiff had a valid contract with Adobe and other doctors and/or medical
organizations, Defendant was aware of these contracts, but prior to his
departure he deliberately breached and/or disrupted Plaintiff’s contractual
relations “through his willful neglect of his duties.” (SAC, ¶¶ 160-164.) After
his departure, Defendant deliberately disrupted Plaintiff’s relationship with
Adobe, Plaintiff relationship with Adobe and its vendors was terminated, and
Plaintiff lost the goodwill of its customers “as a result of Schimpff’s
neglect.” (Id. at pp. 165-168.) Plaintiff was damaged because of
Defendant’s conduct. (Id., at p. 169) 
In Asahi Kasei Pharma Corp. v.
Actelion Ltd. (2013) 222 Cal.App.4th 945, the appellate court explained
that even if a defendant could assert a privilege against liability for
interference with a contract on the basis that the defendant had an ownership
interest in the entity’s contract such that he cannot interfere with his own
contract, such an assertion was a defense and “because the privilege is a
defense, it was not amenable to determination on demurrer.” (Id., at p.
963 referencing Woods v. Fox Broadcasting Sub., Inc. (2005) 129
Cal.App.4th 344, 351, fn. 7.) Recently, the California Supreme Court concluded
that “a defendant who is not a party to the contract or an agent of a party to
the contract is not immune from liability for intentional interference with
contract by virtue of having an economic or social interest in the contract.” (Caliber
Paving Company, Inc. v. Rexford Industrial Realty and Management, Inc.
(2020) 54 Cal.App.5th 175, 187.) Therefore, the fact that Defendant had an
ownership interest in Plaintiff does not mean that he cannot be held liable for
interference with Plaintiff’s contracts. 
However, the SAC
alleges that Defendant’s interference was not intentional but due to
Defendant’s “neglect”  and “willful
neglect of his duties.” (SAC, ¶¶ 164, 166.) Plaintiff fails to show that
willful neglect amounts to intentional conduct sufficient to support a claim
for IICR.” “While a plaintiff may satisfy the intent requirement by pleading
specific intent, i.e., that the defendant desired to interfere with the
plaintiff’s prospective economic advantage, a plaintiff may alternately plead
that the defendant knew that the interference was certain or substantially
certain to occur as a result of its action.” (Korea Supply Co. v. Lockheed
Martin Corp. (2003) 29 Cal.4th 1134, 1154 (Korea).) The SAC fails to
allege that Defendant acted with the specific intent to interfere with
Plaintiff’s contract or that Defendant knew his interference with the contract
was certain or substantially certain to occur due to his conduct. 
 
Lastly, while Quelimane
held that independent wrongful conduct is not necessary, the California
Supreme Court held in Ixchel Pharma, LLC v. Biogen, Inc. (2020) 9
Cal.5th 1130, 1148 that independent wrongful conduct is necessary for at-will
contracts. Accordingly, Plaintiff must plead that the contracts Defendant
interfered with were not at-will contracts and do not require independent
wrongful conduct. 
 
Accordingly, the
demurrer to the eighth cause of action is sustained with leave to amend. 
 
                       B.          Ninth Cause of Action – Negligent Interference with
Prospective Economic Advantage (“NIPEA”)
 
The
tort of negligent interference with a prospective economic advantage (“NIPEA”) differs
in that the defendant's act disrupting the economic relationship does not need
to be intentional. (Venhaus v. Shultz (2007) 155 Cal.App.4th 1072,
1078.)“The tort of negligent interference with economic relationship
arises only when the defendant owes the plaintiff a duty of care.” (Stolz v.
Wong Communications Limited Partnership (1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 1811, 1825
[italics original].)
 
For
a NIPEA claim, the
interference must be wrongful by some legal measure other
than the fact of the interference itself. (See Della Penna v. Toyota Motor Sales,
U.S.A., Inc. (1995) 11 Cal.4th 376, 378.) “[T]he same wrongful act may
constitute both a breach of contract and an invasion of an interest protected
by the law of torts.”¿ (North American Chemical Co. v. Superior Court (1997)
59 Cal.App.4th 764, 774.)¿ However, “conduct amounting to a breach of contract
becomes tortious only when it also violates a duty independent of the
contract arising from principles of tort law.”¿ (Erlich v. Menezes (1999)
21 Cal.4th 543,
551 [italics added]; see also Applied Equipment Corp. v. Litton Saudi Arabia
Ltd. (1994) 7 Cal.4th 503, 515 [‘ “An omission to perform a contract
obligation is never a tort, unless that omission is also an omission of a legal
duty.” ’ [internal quotation marks and citations omitted].) “[A]n
act is independently wrongful if it is unlawful, that is, if it is proscribed
by some constitutional, statutory, regulatory, common law, or other determinable
legal standard.” (Korea, supra, 29 Cal.4th at p. 1159.) 
 
As to the NIPEA claim, the SAC
alleges Plaintiff had several economic relationships with current and
prospective customers and independent contracts that had the probability of
future economic benefit for Plaintiff. (SAC, ¶ 172.) On one occasion, during Defendant’s
employment, Defendant interfered with Plaintiff’s prospective relationship with
BetterVet by promising “an inappropriately low price” for Plaintiff’s products
and not validating a contract with a third-party vendor, resulting in the loss
of the deal, loss of $60,000 in an accounts receivable, and loss to Plaintiff’s
valuation. (SAC, ¶ 173.) Furthermore, two contractors who were strong and
experienced salespeople were terminated due to Defendant misrepresenting their
performance and advocating their termination, depriving Plaintiff of the
economic benefit of their labor. (SAC, ¶ 174.) As Plaintiff’s officer and
co-founder, Defendant owed a duty of care to Plaintiff. (SAC, ¶ 177.) 
Defendant demurs to
the NIPEA claim on the basis that Plaintiff fails to allege independent
wrongful conduct. Plaintiff points to the other causes of action for fraudulent
inducement, fraudulent misrepresentation, and breach of fiduciary duty as wrongful
independent conduct sufficient to sustain a NIPEA claim. (Opposition, at p.
14:1-6.) 
 
Defendant argues
that the fraud-based causes of action and the breach of fiduciary duty, while
wrongful, is not conduct related to the interference itself and is insufficient
to show independent wrongful conduct. “A plaintiff need not allege the
interference and a second act independent of the interference. Instead, a
plaintiff must plead and prove that the conduct alleged to constitute the
interference was independently wrongful, i.e., unlawful for reasons other than
that it interfered with a prospective economic advantage.” (Stevenson Real
Estate Services, Inc. v. CB Richard Ellis Real Estate Services, Inc. (2006)
138 Cal.App.4th 1215, 1224.) 
 
The SAC fails to
allege that the misrepresentations Defendant made about his marketing and sales
experience, or lack thereof, occurred at the same time Defendant interfered
with the BetterVet contract or the contract with the two independent contractors.
However, the fourth cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty, did occur
while Defendant was an officer and Defendant’s deception about his competence
and capability caused interference with the BetterVet contract and the contract
with the two independent contractors. (SAC, ¶¶ 131-135.) Therefore, the SAC
does allege a viable NIPEA claim. 
 
While a demurrer
does not lie in part of a cause of action, the court notes that the SAC fails
to allege what duty Defendant breached after he left Plaintiff’s employment that
is sufficient to sustain an NIPEA claim for conduct occurring after Defendant’s
employment with Plaintiff. (See Fremont Indemnity Co. v. Fremont General
Corp. (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97, 119[“A demurrer must dispose of an entire
cause of action to be sustained”].)
 
Therefore, the
demurrer to the ninth cause of action is overruled. 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant’s
demurrer is sustained as to the eighth cause of action with leave to amend and
overruled as to the ninth cause of action. Plaintiff is granted 10 days leave
to amend. The court sets a Non-Appearance OSC RE: Amended Complaint for
September 23, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. Defendant to give notice.
