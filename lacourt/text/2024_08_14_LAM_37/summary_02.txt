As for the summary in English text, here is a brief summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the defendant's demurrer to the eighth cause of action (Intentional Interference with Contractual Relations) is sustained with leave to amend. The judge finds that the plaintiff has failed to allege intentional conduct by the defendant that would support a claim for intentional interference with contractual relations. The judge has also tentatively ruled that the defendant's demurrer to the ninth cause of action (Negligent Interference with Prospective Economic Advantage) is overruled. The judge finds that the plaintiff has alleged sufficient independent wrongful conduct by the defendant to support a claim for negligent interference with prospective economic advantage.

The judge has granted the plaintiff 10 days to amend its complaint and has set a Non-Appearance OSC RE: Amended Complaint for September 23, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. The defendant is ordered to give notice of the amended complaint.
