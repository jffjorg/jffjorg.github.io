And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding the disclosure of certain mediation communications. The judge has determined that some of the mediation communications are not protected from disclosure because they were prepared by fewer than all the mediation participants and those participants did not agree to disclosure in writing. The judge is allowing some of these communications to be disclosed, but will carefully review them before making a final decision. The judge is relying on Evidence Code Section 1222, which outlines the conditions under which mediation communications are not protected from disclosure. The judge will consider the parties' disputes over whether certain mediation communications can be disclosed and will make a final ruling at the upcoming hearing on February 15, 2023.
