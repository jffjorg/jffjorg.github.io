And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

Counsel Dale Reicheneder has moved to be relieved as counsel of record for the Plaintiffs, Samantha and Royce Clayton, in the case against Malibu West Swimming Club. The court has reviewed the necessary forms and declarations, and finds that an irreparable breakdown of the attorney-client relationship has occurred due to the client's actions. The client has rendered it unreasonably difficult for the lawyer to carry out the representation effectively and has materially breached counsel's retainer agreement. Despite this, the client has other counsel of record, and therefore, the court has tentatively granted the motion to be relieved as counsel. The order will be effective upon the filing of proof of service on the client, and until then, Counsel Reicheneder remains counsel of record.
