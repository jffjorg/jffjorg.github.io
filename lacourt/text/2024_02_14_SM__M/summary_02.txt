And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion for summary judgment or adjudication filed by the defendants, Dr. Jamie S. Schwartz and Jamie S. Schwartz MD, PC, regarding a lawsuit brought by the plaintiff, Williams. The plaintiff alleges that the defendants breached their duty of care and committed medical battery by performing lipedema reduction surgery on her legs without her consent. The defendants argue that the plaintiff gave her consent for the surgery and that it was performed within the standard of care.

The judge finds that the motion is not granted because there are disputes of fact regarding whether the plaintiff gave her consent for the surgery and whether the surgery was performed within the standard of care. The judge notes that the plaintiff has presented evidence that the defendants breached their contract for surgery and committed medical battery, and that the defendants have presented evidence that the plaintiff gave her consent for the surgery.

The judge also finds that the defendants have failed to meet their burden to demonstrate that they did not breach their duty of care and that the plaintiff's injuries were not caused by their actions. The judge notes that the plaintiff's experts have presented evidence that the defendants failed to meet the standard of care in performing the surgery, and that the defendants' own expert has testified that the surgery was performed within the standard of care.

Based on these findings, the judge denies the motion for summary judgment or adjudication and allows the case to proceed to trial.
