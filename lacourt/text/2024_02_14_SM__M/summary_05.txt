And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the plaintiff's motion to amend the complaint to add additional facts and causes of action. The proposed amended complaint (FAC) more closely aligns with a breach of habitability lawsuit, adding seven new causes of action related to problems at the subject property during the tenancy. The court notes that the plaintiff's counsel did not provide information on when the facts were discovered or why the amendment could not be made earlier, but this does not prevent the amendment given the nature of the proposed changes. The court also observes no prejudice to the defendants.
