And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the plaintiff's motion to compel further response to special interrogatories. The judge denies the plaintiff's request to compel responses to interrogatories 43, 44, and 45, as these patients have not waived their constitutional right to privacy in their psychiatric treatment. However, the judge grants the plaintiff's request to compel a response to interrogatory 46, which asks for the identification of a possible witness. The defendant must disclose the last known address and all last known phone number(s) of this witness within 10 days. The judge also notes that addresses and phone numbers are not private and can be disclosed. Finally, the judge decides not to impose monetary sanctions on either party, as the results were split between them.
