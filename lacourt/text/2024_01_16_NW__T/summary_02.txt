And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the defendant's demurrer to the plaintiff's First Amended Complaint (FAC) is sustained, and the plaintiff has 20 days to amend the complaint. The judge found that the FAC is insufficiently pled and does not provide the defendant with proper notice of the claims being alleged against them. The judge also rejected the plaintiff's contention that the FAC is sufficiently alleged, citing the lack of specific factual allegations in the complaint. The judge further denied the plaintiff's attempt to incorporate the original complaint into a Proposed Second Amended Complaint, finding that this would be an improper way to reinstate abandoned class action allegations. The judge gave the plaintiff 20 days to cure the pleading defects in the FAC and file an amended pleading.
