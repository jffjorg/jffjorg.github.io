Philadelphia Indemnity Ins. Co. v. Sprewell, et al.MOTION
TO DEEM REQUESTS FOR ADMISSION ADMITTED; 
REQUEST
FOR SANCTIONS(CCP § 2033.280)
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
            
Plaintiff Philadelphia Indemnity
Insurance Company’s Motion to Deem Requests for Admission Admitted and Request
for Sanctions is GRANTED. DEFENDANT REBECCA
LATRICE SPREWELL IS ORDERED TO PAY SANCTIONS OF $360.00 TO PLAINTIFF’S
COUNSEL WITHIN 20 DAYS’ SERVICE OF THIS ORDER.
 
 
 
 
ANALYSIS:
 
On September 8, 2023, Plaintiff Philadelphia Indemnity
Insurance Company (“Plaintiff”) served Requests for Admissions, Set One, on
Defendant Rebecca Latrice Sprewell (“Defendant”).
(Motion, Cicione Decl., Exh. A.) Despite
a meet and confer effort, Defendant has not served responses to the Requests
for Admission. (Id. at ¶3 and Exhs. B-C.) Plaintiff filed the instant
Motion to Deem Requests for Admission Admitted (“the Motion”) on December 7,
2023. The Motion initially came for hearing on January 31, 2024, at which time
Defendant appeared. (Minute Order, 01/31/24.) The Court continued the hearing
to February 14, 2024. (Ibid.) No opposition has been filed to date. 
 
There is no requirement for a prior meet and confer effort
before a motion to deem requests for admission can be filed. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2033.280.) Further, the motion can be brought at any time after the
responding party fails to provide the responses. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280.)
Due to Defendant’s failure to timely serve responses and resultant waiver of
objections, Plaintiff is entitled to an order deeming the Requests for
Admission admitted. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280.) 
 
The Court is required to award sanctions under the moving
statute. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).) While properly noticed, the
sanctions sought are excessive. Under a lodestar calculation, sanctions are
granted against Defendant in the amount of $360.00 based on one hour of
attorney time billed at $300.00 per hour, plus the $60.00 filing fee. (Motion,
Cicione Decl., ¶4.)
 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiff Philadelphia Indemnity Insurance Company’s Motion
to Deem Requests for Admission Admitted and Request for Sanctions is GRANTED.
DEFENDANT REBECCA LATRICE SPREWELL IS
ORDERED TO PAY SANCTIONS OF $360.00 TO PLAINTIFF’S COUNSEL WITHIN 20 DAYS’
SERVICE OF THIS ORDER.
