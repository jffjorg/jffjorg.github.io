```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to vacate the default and default judgment entered against him. The defendant, Richard B. Pallack, failed to appear at trial, and the court entered default and default judgment against him. However, the judge has determined that the court did not have the power to enter default and default judgment against Pallack because he had filed an answer to the complaint. As a result, the judge has vacated the default and default judgment and set an order to show cause re status of case for February 28, 2024.
