ANALYSIS: 
 
On April 2, 2018, Plaintiff City of Los Angeles, acting by
and through the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (“Plaintiff”) filed
this action against Richard Pallack for damages in the amount of $24,713.13.
Defendant filed his Answer on May 11, 2018. On January 6, 2021, Defendant
failed to appear at the scheduled non-jury trial. (Minute Order, 01/06/21.) The
Court vacated the trial date and set an Order to Show Cause re Failure to
Secure Default/Default Judgment/Dismissal. (Ibid.) On January 20, 2021,
Plaintiff requested default be entered against Defendant and the clerk entered
default the same day. 
 
On April 13, 2021, the Court entered default judgment
against Defendant and in favor of Plaintiff in the total amount of $36,628.00.
On October 12, 2021, Defendant filed the instant Motion to Set Aside Default
and Default Judgment. Plaintiff filed an opposition on March 24, 2022.
Defendant made numerous requests to continue the hearing date. On December 11,
2023, the Court on its own motion continued the hearing to January 25, 2024. 
 
On January 25, 2024, the case was transferred from
Department 25 of the Spring Street Courthouse to Department 26 of the Spring
Street Courthouse and the hearing was reset for February 14, 2024. (Minute
Order, 01/25/24.) Counsel for Defendant was ordered to give notice and file
proof of service within two days. (Ibid.) Notice of the continuance was
filed on the same date. 
 
Discussion
 
Defendant moves to vacate the entry of default pursuant to
Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b), section 473.5, or on
equitable grounds. However, the Court, by virtue of its inherent authority,
vacates the entry of default and default judgment as void. The Court could not
have entered Defendant’s default for failing to appear at trial: “Simply
stated, the court had no power to order the entry of appellants’ default when
they failed to appear for trial. (Heidary v. Yadollahi (2002) 99
Cal.App.4th 857, 862 [citing Wilson v. Goldman (1969) 274 Cal.App.2d
573].) 
 
Section 585 of the Code of Civil
Procedure does not authorize the entry of any default in cases where an answer
is on file, whether the defendant does or does not appear at the time the
action is called for hearing. (Warden v. Lamb, 98 Cal.App. 738, 741,
277 P. 867; Code Civ.Proc. s 585; Barberia v. Independent Elevator Co., 133
Cal.App.2d 657, 659, 285 P.2d 91.) Where the defendant who has answered
fails to appear for trial ‘the plaintiff's sole remedy is to move the court to
proceed with the trial and introduce whatever testimony there may be to sustain
the plaintiff’s cause of action.’ (Warden v. Lamb, Supra, 98 Cal.App.
741, 277 P. 868.) In such case a plaintiff is entitled to proceed under the
provisions of Code of Civil Procedure, section 594, subd. 1, and he may do so
in the absence of the defendant provided the defendant has been given at least
5 days notice of the trial. Section 594 does not authorize the entry of the
default in the event the defendant fails to appear, and a hearing held pursuant
to that section under such circumstances is uncontested as distinguished from a
default hearing. (See Ahmanson Bank & Trust Co., v. Tepper, 269 A.C.A. 394,
401, 74 Cal.Rptr. 774; Code Civ.Proc. ss 485, 494; Warden v. Lamb, Supra, 98
Cal.App. 738, 741, 277 P. 867.)
 
Where a defendant has filed an
answer, neither the clerk nor the court has the power to enter a default based
upon the defendant’s failure to appear at trial, and a default entered after
the answer has been filed is void (Warden v. Lamb, Supra, 741, 277 P.
867; Barbaria v. Independent Elevator Co., Supra, 133 Cal.App.2d 657, 659, 285
P.2d 91; Miller v. Cortese, 110 Cal.App.2d 101, 104—105, 242 P.2d 84), and
is subject to expungement at any time either by motion made pursuant to Code of
Civil Procedure, section 473 or by virtue of the court's inherent power to
vacate a judgment or order void on its face. (Potts v. Whitson, 52
Cal.App.2d 199, 125 P.2d 947; Reher v. Reed, 166 Cal. 525, 528, 137 P. 263;
Baird v. Smith, 216 Cal. 408, 409—411, 14 P.2d 749.)
 
(Wilson v. Goldman (1969) 274 Cal.App.2d 573, 576–577
[emphasis added].)
