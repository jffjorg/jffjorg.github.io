And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The Court has reviewed the motion for trial preference filed by Plaintiff Sharifeh Kalimeh Delijani and has made a tentative ruling. The Court finds that Plaintiff has a substantial interest in the action as a whole, but has not established that Plaintiff's health is such that a preference is necessary to prevent prejudicing the party's interest in the litigation. The Court will exercise its discretion to advance the trial date to a date in late September or early October of 2024. The parties shall meet and confer and propose a new date mutually agreeable to their schedules.
