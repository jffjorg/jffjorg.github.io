And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling denies the petition for minors compromise filed by Petitioner Nakeithia Robinson on behalf of Claimant Khalon Madison without prejudice. The Court finds that the petition was filed by the wrong guardian ad litem and that the Petitioner must file a new petition using the most updated form MC-350. The Court also notes several defects in the petition, including the lack of recent medical records and proof of expenses. The Court recommends that the Petitioner obtain a recent medical report and attach proof of expenses. Additionally, the Court suggests that the Petitioner's attorney be careful in representing the other plaintiffs in this action and that the Petitioner complete and file form MC-355.
