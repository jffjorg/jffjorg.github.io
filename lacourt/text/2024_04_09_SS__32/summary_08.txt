And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has granted the defendants' motion for judgment on the pleadings, ruling that the plaintiffs have failed to state facts that constitute a cause of action. The court held that the social host immunity applies in this scenario, as the defendants' alleged failures to supervise the pool and its users do not rise to the level of a duty to act. The court also found that the plaintiffs' allegations do not state a special relationship between the defendants and the decedent that would give rise to a duty to aid. The court ordered that the defendants' motion for judgment on the pleadings be granted with leave to amend, and that the plaintiffs file an amended complaint within 20 days.
