And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the defendant's motion for summary judgment in the case of Je'Don Hopkins v. Ralphs Grocery Company dba Ralphs. The plaintiff, Je'Don Hopkins, filed a complaint alleging that he slipped and fell on a wet ramp at the defendant's store on October 25, 2021. The defendant, Ralphs Grocery Company dba Ralphs, filed a motion for summary judgment arguing that the condition of the ramp was open and obvious and that the plaintiff was negligent in failing to avoid the hazard.

The court has reviewed the evidence and concluded that there are triable issues of material fact as to whether the alleged defects were trivial. Specifically, the court found that the plaintiff presented testimony that the pavement was "slick" and that the cement "didn't have any kind of like roughness to like catch your grip." The court also noted that the parties presented different expert testimony on the slip resistance of the pavement.

The court denied the defendant's motion for summary judgment, concluding that there are triable issues of material fact that must be resolved through further litigation.
