[1] Although
Defendant argues that Plaintiff’s expert ignores Plaintiff’s testimony that she
slipped from rain water only, there is no indication that Plaintiff would
necessarily know that she slipped from a smooth or textured surface of the ramp,
or from a greasy or oily ramp. (Def.’s Obj. #1.) The declaration of Gary Gsell
indicates that he personally inspected the location and determined that the sidewalk
had a smooth finish. (Gsell Decl. ¶ 10, 15.) That Plaintiff did not see
anything on the floor that contributed to the slip does not establish that
nothing else about the condition of the floor, other than it being wet,
constituted an alleged dangerous condition. Moreover, Plaintiff testified that
the concrete was “slick.” (Pl.’s Resp. to UMF 5.)
