Counsel for defendant submitted on the Court’s tentative ruling. Counsel for  Plaintiffs was registered to appear but did not. Plaintiffs appeared in Court  indicating they wished to contest the motion. Since Plaintiffs’ counsel did not  appear and failed to contact the Court, the motion was placed off calendar. Plaintiffs’  counsel then filed this motion on January 22, 2024. No opposition has been  filed.   LEGAL  STANDARD  Pursuant to Code of Civil  Procedure section 664.6, “if parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a  writing signed by the parties outside the presence of the court or orally before  the court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon motion,  may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement.  If requested  by the parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties to enforce  the settlement until performance in full of the terms of the settlement.”   “Section 664.6 was enacted to provide a summary procedure for specifically  enforcing a settlement contract without the need for a new lawsuit.”  (Weddington Productions, Inc. v. Flick (1998) 60 Cal.App.4th 793, 809.)  A writing is  signed by a “party” if signed by any of the following: “(1) The party; (2) An  attorney who represents the party; or (3) If the party is an insurer, an agent  who is authorized in writing by the insurer to sign on the insurer's behalf.”  (Code Civ. Proc. § 664.6.)     To be enforceable under Code of Civil  Procedure section 664.6, any written settlement agreement outside of court must  be signed. An agreement to settle under section 664.6 cannot be enforced unless  it is signed by all of the litigating parties to the agreement. (J.B.B.  Investment Partners, Ltd. v. Fair (2014) 232 Cal.App.4th 974, 985.) Although the Court may adjudicate  disputes over the terms of the settlement agreement, the Court may not modify  terms from what was agreed to by the parties. (Machado v. Myers (2019)  39 Cal.App.5th 779, 797.)    DISCUSSION   Counsel for Plaintiffs argue that Plaintiffs and Defendant signed a  Settlement Conference Officers’ Proposal to Settle (“Proposal”) on June 7,  2023. The Agreement stated that counsel for Defendant “shall prepare a Separate  Settlement Agreement and General Release of Claims, which must be consistent  with the terms and conditions of this Settlement Conference Officers’ Proposal  and which must be approved by counsel for Plaintiffs to form. The agreement  shall be submitted by counsel for Estate of John Shing Lee, Deceased, to  counsel for Plaintiffs not later than June 9, 2023.”    (Barrantes  Decl. ¶ 4, Exh. 1, Proposal ¶ 8.)   Plaintiffs signed the Proposal on June 7, 2023. Defendant accepted the  Proposal and signed on June 7, 2023. (Ibid.)    “In order for acceptance of a proposal to result in the formation of a  contract, the proposal ‘must be sufficiently definite, or must call for such  definite terms in the acceptance, that the performance promised is reasonably  certain.’ [citation.] A proposal ‘cannot be accepted so as to form a contract  unless the terms of the contract are reasonably certain. The terms of a  contract are reasonably certain if they provide a basis for determining...the  existence of a breach and for giving an appropriate remedy.’ [citation.] If, by  contrast, a supposed ‘contract’ does not provide a basis for determining what  obligations the parties have agreed to, and hence does not make possible a  determination of whether those agreed obligations have been breached, there is  no contract. [citation.]” (Weddington Productions, Inc. v.  Flick (1998) 60 Cal.App.4th 793, 811.)     Here, identical settlement proposals were accepted and signed by the  parties. In the Proposal, “Defendant (or Defendant’s insurer) shall pay a total  of $375,000.00 to Plaintiffs Janeth Malo and Ashley Leyva, jointly and  severally, within 14 calendar days of Plaintiffs signing a Settlement Agreement  and Mutual Release of Claims.” (Agreement ¶ 1.) In exchange, “Plaintiffs and  Defendant shall each generally release the other . . . from all liabilities,  causes of actions, charges, complaints, claims, obligations, costs, losses,  damages, injuries, attorney’s fees, court costs, penalties, fines, and all  other legal responsibilities of any form whatsoever, arising from all claims  and causes of action, whether known or unknown.” (Id. ¶ 3.)    Additionally, the proposal states: “[n]otwithstanding the provisions  of [Civil Code section 1542], this settlement shall constitute full settlement  of all disputes, claims, and causes of action between Plaintiffs Janeth Malo  and Ashley Leyva and Defendant Estate of John Shing Lee, Deceased.” (Id.  ¶ 4.)    Based on the above, and upon reviewing the Proposal, the Court finds  the terms to be sufficiently definite to constitute an agreement. The Court  enters judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement and dismisses the case.     CONCLUSION  AND ORDER   Therefore, Plaintiffs’  motion to enforce settlement is GRANTED. Plaintiff to file and serve a proposed judgment within 10 days.               Plaintiffs shall give notice of  the Court’s order and file a proof of service of such.
