CASE NUMBER:


22STCV01244




MOTIONS:  


Motion
  to Set Aside Dismissal 




MOVING PARTY:


Plaintiff Ladrina Williams 




OPPOSING PARTY:


None



 
BACKGROUND
 
On January 12, 2022, Plaintiff Ladrina Williams (Plaintiff) filed a
complaint against Defendants Vickie Johnson, Leatha Ashley, and Does 1 to 50,
for negligence and premises liability.
 
On February 1, 2022, Defendants were served via substitute service.
(Harutyunyan Decl. ¶ 4.) Plaintiff’s counsel later learned that Plaintiff had
passed away. (Motion, 3.) Believing that Plaintiff had no successor in
interest, Plaintiff requested that the action be dismissed without prejudice.
On July 13, 2023, the Court entered dismissal. 

 
On January 10, 2024, Plaintiff filed this motion to set aside the
dismissal pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 473(b). No opposition has
been filed. 
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
Under Code
of Civil Procedure section 473(b), the Court may relieve a party from a
dismissal taken against him through his mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or
excusable neglect.  This application must
be filed no more than six months after entry of the order from which relief is
sought, and must contain an affidavit of fault demonstrating the moving party’s
mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. 
 
A mistake
is a basis for relief under section 473 when by reason of the mistake a party
failed to make a timely response.  Surprise occurs when a party is
unexpectedly placed in a position to his injury without any negligence of his
own. Excusable neglect is a basis for relief when the party has shown some
reasonable excuse for the default.  (Credit Managers Association of
California v. National Independent Business Alliance (1984) 162 Cal.App.3d
1166, 1173; Davis v. Thayer (1980) 113 Cal.App.3d 892, 905.)  Under
Code of Civil Procedure section 473, the moving party bears the burden of
demonstrating an excusable ground, such as fraud or mistake, justifying a
court’s vacating a judgment.  (Basinger v. Roger & Wells (1990)
220 Cal.App.3d 16, 23–24.)   
 
Relief under
this section is mandatory when based on an attorney affidavit of fault;
otherwise, it is discretionary. (Id.) However mandatory relief is only
available when a party fails to oppose a dismissal motion (“which are
procedurally equivalent to a default”). (Leader v. Health Industries of America, Inc. (2001) 89
Cal.App.4th 603, 620.) The mandatory relief provision
does not apply to dismissals for “failure to prosecute [citations omitted], dismissals
for failure to serve a complaint within three years [citations omitted],
dismissals based on running of the statute of limitations [citations omitted],
and voluntary dismissals entered pursuant to settlement [citations omitted].”
(Id.) 
 
DISCUSSION
 
            Procedurally,
the present motion is timely because it was filed within six months after the
case was dismissed. The Declaration of Izabella Harutyunyan (“Counsel”) states
that she “unintentionally, inadvertently, and mistakenly requested the Court to
dismiss the entire action without prejudice.” (Harutyunyan Decl. ¶ 6.) Based on
the declaration, it appears Counsel now brings this motion since she discovered
that Plaintiff has a survivor who may substitute Plaintiff’s place in this
action. Therefore, since the dismissal was premised on the assumption that
Plaintiff had no survivor, the Court finds that the dismissal was the result of
mistake and inadvertence. 
 
            Therefore, the Court grants the
motion to set aside the dismissal. 
             
CONCLUSION AND
ORDER
 
Therefore, the Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion to set aside the dismissal.
Plaintiff is granted leave to file and serve an amended complaint within 30
days.
 
The Court sets an Order to Show Cause re
Monetary Sanctions for Failure to Serve/ Trial Setting Conference for July 8,
2024 at 8:30 a.m. in Department 32 of the Spring Street Courthouse.
 
Plaintiff to provide notice and file a proof of service of such.
