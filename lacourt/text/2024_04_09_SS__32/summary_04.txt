And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The Court grants Plaintiff's motion to set aside the dismissal of the lawsuit. The motion was filed within six months of the dismissal and was based on an affidavit of fault demonstrating the counsel's mistake and inadvertence. The Court finds that the dismissal was the result of a mistake and inadvertence, as the counsel had unintentionally requested the dismissal. The Plaintiff is granted leave to file and serve an amended complaint within 30 days. The Court sets an Order to Show Cause re Monetary Sanctions for Failure to Serve/ Trial Setting Conference for July 8, 2024 at 8:30 a.m. in Department 32 of the Spring Street Courthouse.
