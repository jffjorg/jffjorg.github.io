```

And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge's tentative ruling is that the Motions to Compel Plaintiffs' Depositions are DENIED as moot. The ruling is based on the fact that the depositions were taken on March 5 and 6, 2024, and therefore, the motions are no longer necessary. The judge also declines to award monetary sanctions, as it appears that Plaintiffs' counsel did not advise Plaintiffs to engage in the discovery abuse. The ruling is subject to change based on any further submissions or appearances at the scheduled hearing.
