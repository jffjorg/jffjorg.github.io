BACKGROUND
 
On
September 30, 2021, Plaintiffs Eduard Davtyan and Grigor Davtyan filed a
complaint against Defendants Matthew Ellison, The Hertz Corporation, and Does 1
to 10 for negligence and negligent entrustment surrounding a motor vehicle
accident. Plaintiffs allege that Matthew Ellison was driving the subject car,
which was rented from and owned by The Hertz Corporation. 
 
Defendants Matthew Ellison and The Hertz Corporation (“Defendants”)
now move to compel the depositions of Plaintiffs Eduard Davtyan and Grigor Davtyan
(“Plaintiffs”). Defendants seek monetary sanctions. Plaintiffs oppose and
Defendants reply. 
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
Code of Civil Procedure section
2025.450(a) provides: “If, after service of a deposition notice, a party to the
action or an officer, director, managing agent, or employee of a party, or a
person designated by an organization that is a party under Section 2025.230,
without having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails to appear
for examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for inspection any
document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the
deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move for an order compelling
the deponent's attendance and testimony, and the production for inspection of
any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in
the deposition notice.”¿ Section 2025.450 requires the Court to compel the
deposition unless it finds a valid objection was served under section 2025.410.¿ 
¿ 
A motion brought to compel a
deposition “shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section
2016.040, or, when the deponent fails to attend the deposition … by a
declaration stating that the petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire
about the nonappearance.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (b)(2).)¿¿ 
¿¿ 
If a motion to compel deposition
is granted, sanctions are mandatory in favor of the party who noticed the
deposition and against the deponent or the party with whom the deponent is
affiliated, unless the court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (g)(1).)¿ 
 
Sanctions against counsel:¿ The court in Kwan Software Engineering, Inc. v. Hennings (2020)
58 Cal.App.5th 57, 81 (Hennings) noted that discovery sanctions against
an attorney are governed by a different standard than sanctions against a
party:¿¿ 
 
By the terms of the statute, a trial court
under section 2023.030(a) may not impose monetary sanctions against a party’s
attorney unless the court finds that the attorney “advised” the party to engage
in the conduct resulting in sanctions. (§ 2023.030(a); Ghanooni v. Super
Shuttle (1993) 20 Cal.App.4th 256, 261, 24 Cal.Rptr.2d 501.)¿ “Unlike
monetary sanctions against a party, which are based on the party’s misuse of
the discovery process, monetary sanctions against the party’s attorney require
a finding the ‘attorney advis[ed] that conduct.’ ” (Ibid.) “It is not
enough that the attorney's actions were in some way improper.” (Corns v.
Miller (1986) 181 Cal.App.3d 195, 200, 226 Cal.Rptr. 247 (Corns).)
Because an attorney's advice to a client is “peculiarly within [his or her]
knowledge,” the attorney has the burden of showing that he or she did not
counsel discovery abuse. (Ibid.) Accordingly, when a party seeking
sanctions against an attorney offers sufficient evidence of a misuse of the
discovery process, the burden shifts to the attorney to demonstrate that he or
she did not recommend that conduct. (Id. at pp. 200–201, 226 Cal.Rptr.
247; Ghanooni, at p. 262, 24 Cal.Rptr.2d 501.)¿ 
 
MEET
AND CONFER
 
The Declaration of Shirley Carpenter Bridwell does not set forth facts
that counsel inquired about the nonappearances. Therefore, the meet and confer
requirement was not met. 
 
DISCUSSION
 
Here, Defendants first noticed
Plaintiffs deposition for May 12, 2022, and have served eight notices since.
(Bridwell Decl. ¶ 3.) The last deposition notice scheduled a deposition for
October 24, 2023. (Id., Exh. A.)  On October 18, 2023, Plaintiffs
filed an objection arguing the date was unilaterally set, but did not meet and
confer to provide an alternative date. (Id. ¶ 4, Exh. B.) On the date of
the depositions, Defendants obtained Certificates of Non-appearance. (Id.
¶ 5, Exh. F.) 
 
In opposition, Plaintiffs argue the depositions took
place on March 5, 2024 and March 6, 2024, and therefore, the motions are moot.
In reply, Defendants concede the depositions were taken, but still requests
monetary sanctions. 
 
Plaintiffs’ counsel declares that the depositions
throughout 2022 and 2023 were continued in good faith due to her unanticipated
health complications. (Karapetian Decl. ¶ 2.) From August 7, 2023 to October 7,
2023, counsel was placed on medical leave. The day before the October 24, 2023
deposition, Plaintiffs’ counsel spoke to Defendants’ counsel stating that due
to her medical leave, her impacted calendar prevented her from attending the
deposition. (Id. ¶ 4.) She declares that during this call, counsel for
both parties agreed to proceed with all depositions after Defendants’ summary
judgment motion was heard on November 15, 2023. (Id. ¶ 6.) Plaintiffs’
counsel states she did not learn that certificates of non-appearance were
obtained until this motion was filed. (Id. ¶ 7.) Later, on February 8,
2024, the parties met and conferred via telephone and agreed that Plaintiffs
would appear for depositions on March 5th and 6th, and
Defendants would withdraw the instant motions. (Id. ¶ 12, Exh. C.) 
 
Based on counsel’s declaration, it
appears that counsel did not advise Plaintiffs to engage in the discovery
abuse. Therefore, the Court declines to award monetary sanctions. 
 
CONCLUSION AND
ORDER
 
The Motions to Compel
Plaintiffs’ Depositions are DENIED as moot.
            Defendants shall give notice of the
Court’s ruling and file a proof of service.
