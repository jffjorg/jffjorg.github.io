BACKGROUND
This is a breach of contract action. On August 23, 2021, plaintiff
Bi Yueh Chou (Plaintiff) filed this action. On March 7, 2022, Plaintiff filed
the operative First Amended Complaint against defendants AMM Restoration &
Construction, Inc., Edward Gonzalez, Alicia Rodriguez (Rodriguez), Donald
Duffy, Jr., Inland Empire Claim Consultants, Inc., and Does 1 through 20,
alleging causes of action for breach of contract, intentional
misrepresentation, negligent misrepresentation, negligence, breach of contract,
accounting, conversion, violation of Penal Code § 496(a), elder abuse, and
unjust enrichment. 
On
November 20, 2023, Nicholas L. D’Amico of Blake Law Firm, counsel for Rodriguez,
filed a motion to be relieved as counsel. The motion is unopposed. 
LEGAL
STANDARD
The Court has discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw, and
such a motion should be granted, provided that there is no prejudice to the
client, and it does not disrupt the orderly process of justice. (See Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21
Cal.App.4th 904, 915; People v. Prince
(1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398, 403-407.)
A motion to be relieved as counsel must be made on Judicial Council
Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion), MC-052 (Declaration), and MC-053
(Proposed Order). (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, subds. (a), (c), (e).) The requisite forms must be served “on the client and on all
parties that have appeared in the case.” (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1362,
subd. (d).) 
DISCUSSION
Nicholas
L. D’Amico of Blake Law Firm (Counsel) seeks to be relieved as counsel for Rodriguez.
Counsel contends there has been a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship
and a material term of the underlying engagement such that representation
cannot continue. (D’Amico Decls., ¶ 2.) The Court finds this to be proper
grounds for withdrawal. 
Grounds for permitting an attorney to withdraw from representation
include the client’s conduct that “renders it unreasonably difficult for the
lawyer to carry out the representation effectively[.]” (Cal. Rules of
Professional Conduct, rule 1.16, subd. (b)(4).) A breakdown in the
attorney-client relationship is also grounds for allowing the attorney to
withdraw. (Estate of Falco (1987) 188 Cal.App.3d 1004, 1014.) 
Counsel has provided the appropriate Judicial Council forms,
namely forms MC-051, MC-052, and MC-053, and has properly completed them. (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, subds. (a), (c), (e).) Counsel has also provided
proof of service of these documents on Rodriguez at her current address. (Proofs
of Service (11/20/23).) 
Therefore, the Court GRANTS the motion to be relieved as counsel. 
CONCLUSION
The Motion to be Relieved as Counsel for Defendant Alicia
Rodriguez is GRANTED. 
Counsel is ordered to give notice of this ruling and file proof of
service of same within five calendar days of this order. The Court will sign
the Proposed Order (Form MC-053). The Court further orders Counsel to serve the
signed Order (Form MC-053) upon Rodriguez and file proof of service of same
within five calendar days thereof.
