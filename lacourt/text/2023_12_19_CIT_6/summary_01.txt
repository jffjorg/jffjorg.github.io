And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has tentatively ruled that the answer of Defendant CG Integrity Investments, Inc. to the First Amended Complaint filed on August 23, 2023, is stricken due to the defendant's suspended status. The court agrees with the plaintiff that CG's answer should be stricken because the defendant lacks the legal capacity to defend itself due to its suspended status. The court notes that CG did not present any contrary arguments or evidence regarding its suspended status and therefore tacitly admits the plaintiff's argument is meritorious. The court orders the plaintiff to give notice of the ruling within five calendar days.
