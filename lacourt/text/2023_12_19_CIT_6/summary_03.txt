And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion for leave to file a cross-complaint against the plaintiff, alleging labor code violations arising out of the defendant's alleged employment with the plaintiff. The defendant had filed an answer to the plaintiff's breach of contract action without being represented by counsel, and therefore was unaware of his claims against the plaintiff and the timing requirements for filing a cross-complaint. The judge found that the defendant is acting in good faith and that there is no prejudice to the parties, as no trial date has been set. The judge also construes the plaintiff's lack of opposition as a tacit admission that the defendant's motion is meritorious. Finally, the judge granted the motion to avoid forfeiture of causes of action and to facilitate a complete determination of the controversy between the parties in a single action.
