  Case Number:  21PSCV00519    Hearing Date:   December 19, 2023    Dept:  6 CASE  NAME:  Daniel  Caldera Salcido v. CG Integrity Investments, et al. Order  to Show Cause Re: Why Defendant CG Integrity Investments’ Answer Should Not Be  Stricken Because of Suspended Status  TENTATIVE  RULING The Court STRIKES the answer of Defendant CG Integrity  Investments, Inc. to the First Amended Complaint filed on August 23, 2023.                Plaintiff is ordered to give notice  of the Court’s ruling within five calendar days of this order.  BACKGROUND This is a breach of contract case. On June 23, 2021, plaintiff Daniel  Caldera Salcido (Plaintiff) filed this action against defendants CG Integrity  Investments, Inc. (CG), Claudio Vernail Gonzalez, and Cynthia Ruth Gonzalez  (collectively, Defendants). On June 30, 2023, Plaintiff filed the operative  First Amended Complaint against the same Defendants, alleging causes of action  for breach of contract, intentional misrepresentation, negligent  misrepresentation, concealment, and false promise.  On November 9, 2023, the Court set an Order to Show Cause Re: Why  Defendant CG Integrity Investments’ Answer Should Not Be Stricken Because of  Suspended Status and directed the parties to brief the matter per statute. On  December 6, 2023, Plaintiff filed a memorandum of points and authorities. On December  8, 2023, CG opposed the motion. No reply was filed.  LEGAL  STANDARD             “The court may, upon a motion made pursuant to Section  435, or at any time in its discretion, and upon terms it deems proper: (a)  Strike out any irrelevant, false, or improper  matter inserted in any pleading. (b) Strike out all or any part of any pleading not  drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of this state, a court rule, or an  order of the court.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 436.)  REQUESTS FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE             The Court GRANTS  Plaintiff’s requests for judicial notice as there is no objection from  Defendants and no showing that Exhibits A and B are subject to reasonable  dispute. (Scott v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (2013) 214 Cal.App.4th 743,  760-761.)  PRELIMINARY  ISSUE CG contends in its opposition that Plaintiff’s memorandum of  points and authorities is untimely because it was filed on December 6, 2023. CG  is correct. The Court specifically directed the parties to brief this matter  per the statutory briefing schedule with Plaintiff as the moving party. (Minute  Order (11/9/23).) Sixteen court days before December 19, 2023 is November 27,  2023. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 12; Id., § 1005, subd. (b).) Plaintiff’s  memorandum of points and authorities is therefore untimely. Nevertheless, the  Court exercises its discretion to still consider Plaintiff’s memorandum of  points and authorities. (See Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1300, subd. (d); Juarez  v. Wash Depot Holdings, Inc. (2018) 24 Cal.App.5th 1197, 1202.) The Court further  admonishes the parties to comply with the requirements of the Code of Civil  Procedure going forward.  DISCUSSION Except for the purposes of filing an application for  exempt status or amending the articles of incorporation as necessary either to  perfect that application or to set forth a new name, the corporate powers,  rights and privileges of a domestic taxpayer may be suspended, and the exercise  of the corporate powers, rights and privileges of a foreign taxpayer in this  state may be forfeited, if any of the following conditions occur:  (a) If any tax,  penalty, or interest, or any portion thereof, that is due and payable under  Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 19001) of Part 10.2, or under this part,  either at the time the return is required to be filed or on or before the 15th  day of the ninth month following the close of the taxable  year, is not paid on or before 6 p.m. on the last day of the 12th month after  the close of the taxable year.  (b) If any tax,  penalty, or interest, or any portion thereof, due and payable under Chapter 4  (commencing with Section 19001) of Part 10.2, or under this part, upon notice  and demand from the Franchise Tax  Board, is not paid on or before 6 p.m. on the last day of the 11th month  following the due date of the tax.  (c) If any liability, or any portion thereof, which  is due and payable under Article 7 (commencing with Section 19131) of Chapter 4  of Part 10.2, is not paid on or before 6 p.m. on the last day of the 11th month  following the date that the tax  liability is due and payable.  (Rev. & Tax. Code §  23301.)  “[A] corporation  that has had its powers suspended ‘lacks legal capacity  to prosecute or defend a civil action during its suspension.’  [Citation.]” (Tabarrejo v. Superior Ct. (2014) 232 Cal.App.4th 849,  861.)  Plaintiff contends that CG’s answer should be stricken because CG  is currently suspended by the Franchise Tax Board and therefore lacks capacity  to defend itself. (Request for Judicial Notice, Ex. 3.) The Court agrees.  CG’s  opposition contains no contrary arguments or evidence regarding CG’s suspended  status and whether CG’s answer should be stricken. Since CG did oppose the  motion but did not address this issue, the Court finds that CG tacitly admits  Plaintiff’s argument is meritorious. (Holden v. City of San Diego (2019)  43 Cal.App.5th 404, 418; C. Opposing the Motion—and Rebutting the Opposition,  Cal. Prac. Guide Civ. Pro. Before Trial Ch. 9(I)-C, ¶ 9:105.10.) The Court  will entertain an offer of proof at the hearing on this matter and even a  continuance if further briefing is necessary, but based on the record before  the Court, CG is unable to proceed with defending itself at this time.  Based on the foregoing, the Court STRIKES CG’s answer to the First  Amended Complaint filed on August 23, 2023.  CONCLUSION The Court STRIKES the answer of Defendant CG Integrity  Investments, Inc. to the First Amended Complaint filed on August 23, 2023.                Plaintiff is ordered to give notice  of the Court’s ruling within five calendar days of this order.
