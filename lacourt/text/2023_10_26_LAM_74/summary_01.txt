And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the motion to quash or limit deposition subpoenas issued to third-party Kaiser Permanente and Octave Behavioral Health. The plaintiff, Suzanne Ruelas, seeks to limit the scope of the subpoenas to only documents related to her mental, emotional, or psychological health, and argues that the subpoenas are not sufficiently particularized. The court grants the motion in part, ordering that the subpoenas be limited to only documents related to the plaintiff's psychological, psychiatric, or mental examination, care, diagnosis, and treatment from January 1, 2013, to the present. The court declines to award monetary sanctions under Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.030, subdivision (a).
