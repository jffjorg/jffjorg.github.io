And here is the English text summary:

This is the Judge's tentative ruling on two motions filed by Specialized Loan Servicing, LLC (Defendant) against Denise Birtch (Plaintiff) in a dispute over foreclosed real property. The motions are to compel responses to special interrogatories and to deem admitted requests for admission (RFAs) propounded on Plaintiff. The Court finds that Plaintiff failed to timely respond to the special interrogatories and RFAs, and therefore grants the motions. The Court orders Plaintiff to serve Code-compliant responses to the special interrogatories within 10 days and orders sanctions against Plaintiff in the sum of $740 payable to Defendant by November 26, 2023. The Court also orders sanctions in the sum of $390 payable to Defendant by November 26, 2023, for failure to respond to the RFAs.
