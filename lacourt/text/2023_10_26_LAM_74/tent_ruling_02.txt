 Case Number:  22STCV31615    Hearing Date:   October 26, 2023    Dept:  74 Denise
Birtch v. Specialized Loan Servicing, LLC, et al.
Defendant Specialized Loan
Servicing, LLC’s Motion to Compel Responses to Special Interrogatories (Set
One) and Request for Sanctions against Plaintiff Denise Birtch
 
The
court considered the moving papers. No opposition was timely filed. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1005 [“All papers opposing a motion […] shall be filed with the court
and a copy served on each party at least nine court days […] before the
hearing.”].) 
BACKGROUND 
            This
action arises from a dispute over foreclosed real property.
            On
September 28, 2022, Plaintiff Denise Birtch (Plaintiff) filed a complaint
against Defendant Specialized Loan Servicing, LLC (Defendant) and others. The
complaint alleges one cause of action for identity theft.
            On
July 10, 2023, Defendant served Plaintiff with special interrogatories.
            Plaintiff
never responded.
            On
August 24, 2023, Defendant filed this motion to compel responses to the special
interrogatories and request for sanctions.
LEGAL STANDARD
¿¿            If
a party to whom interrogatories or an inspection demand were directed fails to
serve a timely response, the propounding party may move for an order compelling
responses without objections. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (b),
2031.300, subd. (b).) Moreover, failure to timely serve responses waives
objections to the requests. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (a), 2031.300,
subd. (a).) Failure to verify a response is equivalent to no response at all. (Appleton
v. Superior Court (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 632, 636.)  
            If
the court finds that a party has unsuccessfully made or opposed such a motion,
the court “shall impose a monetary sanction . . . unless it finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc., §§
2030.290, subd. (c), 2031.300, subd. (c).)¿
DISCUSSION
            The court will grant this motion to
compel because Plaintiff failed to timely respond to the special
interrogatories at issue. In addition, sanctions are necessary. Defendant’s
counsel’s hourly rate is reasonable, and he has substantiated his request for
attorney fees with an hourly breakdown of work performed. (Stoltzman Decl., ¶¶
4-6.) But because this motion largely duplicates Defendant’s counsel’s other
motions, the court will adjust the award accordingly ($740 = $350 x (1 hour
drafting motion + 1 hour preparing for and attending hearing) + $40 filing
fee). 
CONCLUSION 
Based
on the foregoing, the court grants Defendant’s motion to compel responses to
the special interrogatories. The court orders Plaintiff to serve without
objection Code Compliant responses to the special interrogatories within 10
days. The court orders sanctions against Plaintiff in the sum of $740 payable
to Defendant by November 26, 2023.

Servicing, LLC’s Motion to Deem Admitted Requests for Admission (Set One)
Propounded on Plaintiff Denise Birtch and Request for Sanctions.
 
The
court considered the moving papers. No opposition was timely filed. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1005 [“All papers opposing a motion […] shall be filed with the court
and a copy served on each party at least nine court days […] before the
hearing.”].) 
BACKGROUND 
            This
action arises from a dispute over foreclosed real property.
            On
September 28, 2022, Plaintiff Denise Birtch (Plaintiff) filed a complaint
against Defendant Specialized Loan Servicing, LLC (Defendant) and others. The
complaint alleges one cause of action for identity theft.
            On
July 10, 2023, Defendant served Plaintiff with requests for admission (RFAs).
            Plaintiff
never responded.
            On
August 24, 2023, Defendant filed this motion to deem admitted all matters set
forth in the RFAs propounded on Plaintiff.
LEGAL STANDARD
¿¿            If
a party to whom requests for admission are directed fails to serve a timely
response, the requesting party may move for an order that the truth of any
matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary
sanction. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).) Further, the
Court¿shall¿make this order, “unless it finds that the party to whom the
requests for admission have been directed has served, before the hearing¿on the
motion, a proposed response to the requests for admission that is in
substantial compliance with Section 2033.220.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280,
subd. (c).) 
            While
tardy responses may defeat the motion, they will not avoid monetary sanctions.
(Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.280, subd. (c) [“It is mandatory that the court impose
a monetary sanction [Citation] on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure
to serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated this
motion.”].)  
DISCUSSION
            The court will grant this motion
because Plaintiff failed to timely respond to the RFAs at issue. In addition,
sanctions are mandatory. Defendant’s counsel’s hourly rate is reasonable, and
he has substantiated his request for attorney fees with an hourly breakdown of
work performed. (Stoltzman Decl., ¶¶ 4-6.) But because this motion largely
duplicates Defendant’s counsel’s other motions, the court will adjust the award
accordingly ($390 = $350 x (1 hour drafting motion) + $40 filing fee). 
CONCLUSION 
Based
on the foregoing, the court grants Defendant’s motion to deem the RFA requests
admitted. The court orders sanctions against Plaintiff in the sum of $390
payable to Defendant by November 26, 2023.
Defendant is ordered to give notice.
