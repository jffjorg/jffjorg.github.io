And here is a summary in English text:

The Honorable Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to compel further responses to request for admissions filed by Plaintiff Marc Bensemhoun. The motion is denied due to its untimeliness and lack of a separate statement. The court also declines to address each item of the request for admissions on the merits due to the procedural bar. The court notes that the parties have settled the separate unlawful detainer action via a stipulated judgment, but denies any impact on the instant action. The court may impose mandatory sanctions against the losing party if the issues return to the court in a different form. The motion to compel further responses is denied, and the court will consider the meet and confer efforts of the parties.
