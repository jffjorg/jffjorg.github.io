SUMMARY
OF ACTION
Plaintiff
Marc Benshemhoun leased certain premises owned and/or managed by defendants
ROHCS Property Management Co., Aryeh Robbins, Fred Schor, Josh Gottlieb, Tzvi
Haber, and 330 North Genesee Avenue LLC, and located at 332.5 Genesee Ave., Los
Angeles beginning on May 15, 2014. Beginning in September 2017, Plaintiff
discovered mold on the premises, and notified defendants. No remediation was
undertaken. 
 
On
February 18, 2022, Defendants filed an unlawful detainer action against
Plaintiff, which was dismissed. On May 3, 2022, Defendants served a Three Day
Notice to Pay Rent or Quit. A secont Three Day Notice to Pay Rent or Quit was
served on May 16, 2022. 
 
On
July 29, 2022, plaintiff Marc Bensemhoun filed a complaint for Breach of
Warranty of Habitability (Violation of Civil Code § 1941.1), Breach of Warranty
of Habitability (Health & Safety Code § 17920.3), Breach of Warranty of
Habitability (Violation of Civil Code § 1942.4), Negligence - Premises
Liability, Nuisance, Battery, Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress,
Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress,  Breach of Contract, Breach of Covenant of
Quiet Enjoyment, Unfair Business Practices (Violation of Business and
Professions Code §17200, et. seq.), Fraudulent Concealment, Moratorium,
Ordinance Nos.186585 and 186606, Violation of Los Angeles Tenant Anti
Harassment Ordinance, Los Angeles Tenant Anti Harassment Ordinance Section
45.33, and Retaliation (Cal. Civ. Code § 1940.35),
 
RULING: Denied.
Plaintiff Marc Bensemhoun moves to compel further responses
to request for admissions numbers 1-62. Defendant ROHCS Property Management Co.
in opposition maintains the motion is moot as the parties settled the instant
action via a stipulated unlawful detainer judgment. [Declaration of Benjamin
Kiss, Ex. A.] ROHCS additionally challenges the necessity of the items given
the lack of any relationship to the action. Plaintiff in reply denies any
settlement agreement on the instant action; the agreement only applies to the
separate unlawful detainer action. Plaintiff selectively reiterates the basis
for discovery of certain items. 
 
The request was served on July 9, 2023; Responses were
served on August 24, 2023. [Declaration of Michael Yadegari.] The responses
consist of the following: “Responding party objects to each request for
admission to the extent that it seeks to burden and harass answering party and
in particular is propounded upon a perjurious declaration and seeks responses
to requests relating to 34.”
 
The motion lacks any separate statement, and otherwise only
offers a generalized statement regarding the lack of a good faith effort to
produce the information. (Cal. Rules Ct., rule 3.1345(a)(1), (c), (d).) The
court may proceed without a separate statement. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.290,
subd. (b)(2).)
 
The instant motion was filed on January 23, 2024, which is
more than 45 days from the August 24, 2023, date of service. The motion lacks
any proof of extension of the time to file the instant motion. The motion is
therefore untimely. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.290, subd. (c).) The court denies
the motion on this basis.
 
Even if the court considers the motion on the merits, the
court cannot definitively determine the impacts of the settlement of the
unlawful detainer on the instant discovery. Plaintiff denies any impacts in
reply. 
 
The court declines to otherwise address each every of the
identified items—numbers 1-62—for a determination of the sufficiency of the
responses simply based on the conclusive argument regarding insufficient
responses. Plaintiff in reply offers a simplified argument regarding the basis
of the motion, in that the responses/objections constitute non-compliant
responses. Plaintiff adds in new argument regarding the failure to present a
code compliance response regarding the inability to provide information under
Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.230, which is not applicable to discovery
responses, and only applies to document production. [Reply, 4:9-11, 27-28.]
(See Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.220, subd. (b)(3), (c).)
 
The procedural bar to the motion, and lack of cited
authority under the section governing admissions bars any formal order for
relief. Should these issues return to the court however in a different form, and
Plaintiff establishes insufficient responses, the court will be required to
impose mandatory sanctions against the losing party barring a showing of unjust
circumstances. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.290, subd. (d).) As addressed above,
the current state of objections and lack of a protective order undermine such a
finding.
 
The court will not conduct any informal discovery
conferences, but will consider the meet and confer efforts of the parties. In
addition to the possibility of sanctions, continued multiple motions to compel
further responses involving voluminous amounts of items may also result in the
setting of an OSC re: Appointment of Referee.
 
Sanctions not rewarded in favor of
Plaintiff. The court declines to impose sanctions in favor of defendant in
opposition. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.290, subd. (d).)
 
Motions
to compel further responses to special interrogatories and form interrogatories
scheduled for March 20, and 21, 2024, respectively.
 
Plaintiff
to give notice.
