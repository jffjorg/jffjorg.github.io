[1] The parties disagree over the
discovery cut-off date.  Plaintiff argues
that discovery closed on December 15, 2023. 
The court agrees with Defendants: discovery closed on December 18.  Based on either date, the court reaches the
same ruling. 


[2] Plaintiff argues the last date to
electronically serve discovery was November 13, 2023.  Plaintiff is incorrect for two reasons.  First, based on a trial date of January 16,
2024, discovery closed on December 18, 2023. 
Therefore, Defendants had until November 15, 2023 to serve written
discovery by electronic service. (See CCP §§ 2030.260(a), 2031.260(a),
2033.250(a) [responses to interrogatories, inspection demands, and admissions
requests must be served within 30 days of service of the discovery].)  As relevant here, Defendants timely served
the notice of deposition on November 14, 2023 by electronic service, and
noticed the deposition within the discovery period.  (See CCP § 2025.270(a) [requiring at least 10
days notice for deposition].)


[3] Plaintiff argues this motion in
limine is untimely.  In reply, Defendants
concede the point and requests 473(b) relief. 
Given that Plaintiff was able to respond to the merits of Defendants’
motion, the court reaches the merits. 
Section 473(b) relief is therefore unnecessary.


[4] Throughout the moving, opposition,
and reply papers, the parties joust over service.  Defendants argue Plaintiff’s counsel
repeatedly refused to serve documents via electronic service despite
Defendants’ instructions and preference for electronic service.  Plaintiff’s counsel responds that Plaintiff
never agreed to accept electronic service and would therefore not accept
documents served in that manner.  Counsel
for the parties both act unreasonably. 
Code of Civil Procedure section 1010.6(b)(2) provides that counsel for a
represented party who has appeared in an action shall accept
electronic service of a notice or documents that may be served by mail, express
mail, overnight delivery, or facsimile transmission.  Thus, Plaintiff’s counsel cannot refuse
electronic service, or insist that documents be served only via mail.  Likewise, Defendants’ counsel cannot wield
section 1010.6 as authority for the proposition that documents may only be
served by electronic service.  Per Code,
and as relevant to the issues discussed herein, service by mail and electronic means
are both valid.
