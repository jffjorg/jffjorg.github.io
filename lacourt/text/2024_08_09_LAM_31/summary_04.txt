And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has made a tentative ruling in a case regarding a dispute over the discovery cut-off date and electronic service of documents. The Judge disagrees with the Plaintiff's argument that discovery closed on December 15, 2023, and instead agrees with the Defendant's argument that discovery closed on December 18, 2023. The Judge also finds that the Defendant timely served the notice of deposition on November 14, 2023 by electronic service, and that the Plaintiff's counsel unreasonably refused to serve documents via electronic service despite the Defendant's instructions. The Judge notes that both parties acted unreasonably, and that service by mail and electronic means are both valid according to the Code of Civil Procedure.
