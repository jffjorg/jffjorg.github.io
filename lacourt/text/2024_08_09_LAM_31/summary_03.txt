And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge, Kerry Bensinger, has issued a tentative ruling in the case Faram Arzbardi v. Porsche Cars North America, Inc., et al. (Case No. 22STCV24523). The case concerns a "lemon law" action filed by Plaintiff Faram Arzbardi against Defendants Porsche Cars North America, Inc. and Beverly Hills Porsche.

In the ruling, the Judge denied Defendant's Motion in Limine #1 to Preclude Testimony and Evidence from Plaintiff. The motion was based on Plaintiff's failure to appear for a deposition on December 5, 2023, and Defendant's argument that Plaintiff did not properly serve the written objection to the deposition notice.

The Judge found that Defendant failed to take any steps to compel Plaintiff's deposition after the objection was filed, and therefore, did not have grounds to request an evidentiary sanction. The ruling notes that the court may impose an evidentiary sanction against a party that fails to obey an order compelling their attendance at deposition, but in this case, there was no such order.

The Judge also noted that Defendant's argument that the envelope containing the written objection was not addressed to defense counsel's firm was not well taken, as the correct address of defense counsel's law firm was included on the envelope.
