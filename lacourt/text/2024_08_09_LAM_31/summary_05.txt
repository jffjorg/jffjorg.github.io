And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled on several issues related to discovery and service in a case. The parties disagree over the discovery cut-off date, with the plaintiff arguing it was December 15, 2023, and the defendants arguing it was December 18, 2023. The judge agrees with the defendants that discovery closed on December 18, 2023. The judge also rules that the last date to electronically serve discovery was November 15, 2023, and that the defendants timely served the notice of deposition on November 14, 2023.

The judge notes that the parties have been unreasonable in their disputes over service, with the plaintiff's counsel refusing to accept electronic service and the defendants' counsel insisting on it. The judge cites Code of Civil Procedure section 1010.6(b)(2), which requires counsel for a represented party to accept electronic service of a notice or document.

Finally, the judge rules that the plaintiff's motion in limine is not untimely and will be considered on its merits.
