ATTORNEY’S FEES

RESPONDING PARTY:     No opposition
 
 
I.          INTRODUCTION
 
            On January 5, 2021, Plaintiff, William Basner, initiated
this action against Defendant, Alexander Frankian, for partition of the real
property at 23311 Valdez Road, Topanga, California (the “Property”).  
 
On May 12, 2023, the parties executed a Settlement Agreement.  Under the terms of the Settlement Agreement,
the parties agreed the Property would be promptly listed for sale, and the
parties would retain a real estate broker to list and market the Property.  And, as relevant here, the Parties agreed to
cooperate in good faith, to review offers in good faith and to take all steps
necessary to effectuate the sale of the Property.  Further, the parties represented and
confirmed there were no liens on the Property or abstracts of judgment that may
be attached to the Property.
 
            Thereafter,
Defendant obtained a Seller’s Report recommending a listing price of $590,000
and presented the same to Plaintiff. 
Defendant also found a listing agent and presented a Listing Agreement
to Plaintiff.  On August 10, 2023,
counsel for Plaintiff agreed to the listing agent proposed by Defendant.
 
            On August
14, 2023, Defense counsel provided Plaintiff with the Listing Agreement for
Plaintiff’s signature.  Plaintiff has refused
to sign the Listing Agreement, and further, now claims that he does not want to
settle this case.  On January 19, 2024,
Defense counsel apprised the court of this matter.  The court directed Defendant to file a noticed
motion to enforce settlement as required by the Settlement Agreement. 
 
            Settlement
Agreement in the Other Action
 
            Plaintiff
filed an unlawful detainer action in Los Angeles Superior Court against
Defendant and businesses associated with Defendant on January 5, 2021 under
Case No. 21AVUD00003.  On May 11, 2021,
Lake Hughes Recovery, a business associated with Defendant, filed a separate
business tort action against Plaintiff in Los Angeles Superior Court under Case
No. 21STCV17645. The two actions were consolidated by stipulation on September
1, 2022 under the lead Case No. 21STCV17645 ("Civil Action").  On March 23, 2023, the court deemed both
actions related and assigned to Department 51 for all purposes.  
 
On October 17, 2023, the parties in the Civil Action
negotiated a settlement which was announced in open court and placed on the
record.  Pursuant to the terms of the
settlement in the Civil Action, the distribution of net proceeds from the sale
of the Property from 50-50 to 57.5% to Defendant and 42.5% to Plaintiff.  In addition, the Listing Agreement that
Plaintiff had refused to sign was mentioned and the court included an order in
its Minute Order requiring Plaintiff to sign the Listing Agreement within seven
days.  Plaintiff verbally agreed to the
terms of the settlement.  However,
Plaintiff again refused to sign the Listing Agreement and attempted to set
aside the settlement in the Civil Action by motion.  Department 51 denied Plaintiff’s motion.
 
The Instant Motion
 
             On May 9, 2024, Defendant filed this Motion to
Enforce Settlement Agreement Pursuant to CCP §664.6 and Attorney’ Fees.  Defendant seeks attorney’s fees in the sum of
$13,725.00.
 
            The motion
is unopposed.
 
II.        LEGAL STANDARD  
 
“If parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a writing
signed by the parties outside the presence of the court or orally before the
court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon motion, may
enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement.¿ If requested by the
parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties to enforce the
settlement until performance in full of the terms of the settlement.”¿ (Code
Civ. Proc., § 664.6.)¿¿¿¿ 
¿ 
In hearing a section 664.6 motion, the trial court may
receive evidence, determine disputed facts, and enter terms of a settlement
agreement as a judgment.¿ (Bowers v. Raymond J. Lucia Companies, Inc.
(2012) 206 Cal.App.4th 724, 732.)¿ The court may interpret the terms and
conditions to settlement (Fiore v. Alvord (1985) 182 Cal.App.3d 561,
566), but the court may not create material terms of a settlement, as opposed
to deciding what terms the parties themselves have previously agreed upon (Weddington
Productions, Inc. v. Flick (1998) 60 Cal.App.4th 793, 810).¿ The party
seeking to enforce a settlement “must first establish the agreement at issue
was set forth ‘in a writing signed by the parties’ (§ 664.6) or was made orally
before the court. [Citation.]”¿ (Harris v. Rudin, Richman & Appel
(1999) 74 Cal.App.4th 299, 304 [holding that a letter confirming the essential
terms of a settlement agreement was not a “writing signed by the parties”
sufficient to satisfy the requirements of Section 664.6].)¿
 
III.      DISCUSSION 
 
            Defendant
seeks court intervention to enforce the Settlement Agreement.  Defendant argues that Plaintiff has refused to
sign the Listing Agreement in violation of Section 2(g) of the Settlement
Agreement.  Section 2(g) states:
 
Good
Faith Cooperation: The Parties agree to cooperate in good faith and to take all
steps necessary to effectuate the sale of the Property and the purposes of this
Agreement, including without limitation the execution of all closing documents,
the preparation of joint escrow instructions, and the preparation of seller
disclosure documents. In the event of a disagreement, the Parties are to meet
and confer in good faith to resolve their dispute and agree that—in the event
of a disagreement between the Parties—heavy deference is to be afforded to any
recommendation made by the Broker.
 
(Manoukian
Decl., Settlement Agreement, § 2(g).)
 
The court finds that Plaintiff’s refusal to sign the Listing
Agreement is a breach of the Settlement Agreement.  Plaintiff has frustrated the sale of the
Property.  Given the lack of opposition,
and that this matter has not been dismissed, the court finds Defendant is
entitled to an order enforcing the Settlement Agreement.  
 
Requested Orders
 
Defendant seeks the following orders:
 
1.     
Plaintiff be required to execute the
Listing Agreement (Exhibit G) immediately. In the event that Plaintiff still
fails to sign the Listing Agreement within 10 days of the Court's order, for
the Court Clerk to be able to execute the Listing Agreement to list and market
the Property for sale.
 
2.     
An order that Plaintiff cooperate
and participate in good faith in the marketing and selling of the Property and
that in the event Plaintiff refuses to and fails to execute any further
documents necessary for the sale of the Property, for Defendant to present same
to the Court with a Declaration explaining the need for the Court Clerk to
execute all documents necessary for the sale of the Property. 
 
3.     
An order for escrow to distribute
the net proceeds from the sale of the Property as follows: 
a.      
57.5% to Alexander Frankian 
b.     
42.5% to William Basner
c.      
Attorney's fees awarded pursuant to
court order to be deducted from William Basner's share of the net proceeds and
paid directly to Alexander Frankian 
 
4.     
An
order for an award of attorney's fees payable by Plaintiff to Defendant in the
sum of $13,725.00 payable from Plaintiff's portion of the net proceeds. 
 
5.     
An order for the expungement of the
Notice of Pending Action recorded on the title of the Property. 
 
6.     
Fair rate of return at the rate of
6% on the sum of $277,300.00 beginning from January 1, 2024 until the date of
distribution of the net proceeds from the Sale of the Property payable to
Defendant for the loss of use of the proceeds, from Plaintiff's share of the
net distribution. 
 
7.     
Any further orders the Court deems
appropriate and necessary to consummate the sale of the Property and
distribution of the net proceeds per the Settlement Agreement herein.
 
The court
cannot grant the relief which Defendant seeks for the following reasons:
 
1.     
Item 4: Attorney’s Fees
 
Defendant seeks $13,725 in attorney’s fees and costs
incurred in enforcing the Settlement Agreement. 
Recovery of the attorney’s fees and costs is authorized by the
Settlement Agreement.  (See Settlement
Agreement, § 7(b).)  The requested sum is
based, in part, on an anticipated 7 hours for the review of Plaintiff’s
opposition and drafting of the reply, and 1 hour for the appearance in the
matter.  Given that Plaintiff has not
filed an opposition, the court is inclined to award $10,125 in attorney’s fees
and costs.
 
2.     
Item 6: Loss of Use of Proceeds
 
Defendant seeks a 6% rate of return on the sum of $277,300
(half of the Property’s listing price) for the loss of use of the proceeds,
which is to be taken from Plaintiff’s half of the proceeds.  However, Defendant does not identify any
provision of the Settlement Agreement that authorizes this relief. 
 
IV.       CONCLUSION
 
            The court will hear from Defendant about the foregoing
issues.
