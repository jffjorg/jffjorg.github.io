DEFENDANT’S
MOTION IN LIMINE #1



 
MOVING PARTY:               Defendant
Porsche Cars North America, Inc.
 
RESPONDING PARTY:      Plaintiff
Faram Arzbardi
 
 
I.          INTRODUCTION

 
On July 28, 2022, Plaintiff, Faram Arzbardi, filed this
“lemon law” action against Defendants, Porsche Cars North America, Inc. (“Porsche”)
and Beverly Hills Porsche.  On September
15, 2023, Plaintiff filed the operative First Amended Complaint, alleging
causes of action for (1) Violation of Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act; (2) Breach
of Implied Warranty of Merchantability; (3) Negligent Repair; (4)
Misrepresentation; and (5)Violation of Magnuson-Moss Warrant Federal Trade
Commission Improvement Act.  
 
Relevant Background
 
On January 4, 2023, the court set the trial date for January
16, 2024.  The discovery cut-off date was
December 18, 2023.[1]
 
On November 14, 2023, Defendants served Plaintiff with written
discovery and notices of deposition.[2]  As relevant here, Plaintiff’s deposition was
set for December 5, 2023.
 
On November 21, 2023, Plaintiff served Defendants with
written objections to the deposition notice by certified mail.  The objection was based on Plaintiff’s
counsel’s unavailability on December 5, 2023. 
The objection was sent to the address of defense counsel’s law
firm.  
 
Plaintiff did not appear for deposition on December 5,
2023.  Defendants did not notice another
deposition date or move to compel Plaintiff’s deposition.  Discovery closed on December 18, 2023.
 
Before the court is Defendants’ Motion in Limine #1 to
Preclude Testimony and Evidence from Plaintiff.  Defendants seek an order prohibiting Plaintiff
and his experts, attorneys, and witnesses from introducing or attempting to
introduce any testimony or evidence at trial.
 
Plaintiff filed an opposition.[3]  Defendants replied.[4]

 
II.        DISCUSSION 
 
            Defendants
are not entitled to the relief requested. 
After serving the deposition notice, Plaintiff timely filed an objection
and did not appear for the deposition. Thereafter, Defendants did not move to
compel Plaintiff’s deposition. 
Defendants did not move to continue the trial because discovery was not
completed, including Plaintiff’s deposition. 
Indeed, Defendants make no showing that it attempted, before or after
November 14, 2023, to take Plaintiff’s deposition, or that Defendants proceeded
to conduct the deposition on December 5, 2023 and took Plaintiff’s
non-appearance.  
 
Instead, Defendants argue that Plaintiff did not properly
serve the written objection to the deposition notice.  Plaintiff served the objection by certified
mail on November 21, 2023.  (See Opp.,
Ex. B.)  Defendants make the point that
the envelope containing the written objection is not addressed to defense
counsel’s firm.  Specifically, “Law
Offices of Abtin Amir, P.C.” does not appear on the envelope despite
Plaintiff’s proof of service indicating the “Law Offices of Abtin Amir, P.C.”
was served. 
 
The point is not well taken for two reasons.  First, defense counsel’s law firm’s correct
address of 4500 Park Granada, Suite 200, Calabasas, CA 91302 appears on the
envelope.  This address is consistent
with the proof of service and defense counsel’s address that is the one on file
with the court.  Second, Defendants
cannot rely on improper service of the objections to obviate Defendants’
responsibility to take the necessary steps to conduct Plaintiff’s deposition.  Based on the record before the court,
Defendants did nothing to compel Plaintiff’s deposition. 
 
The gist of Defendants’ motion is for evidentiary sanctions.  “An evidence sanction is an order prohibiting
designated matters from being introduced in evidence.” (New Albertsons, Inc.
v. Superior Ct. (2008) 168 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1422, citing Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2023.030, subd. (c).)  The court may impose an evidence sanction against
a party that fails to obey an order compelling their attendance at deposition. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2024.450, subd. (h).)  Here, however, there is no
court order compelling Plaintiff to appear for deposition.  Defendants failed to obtain a court order
compelling the deposition likely because Defendants waited too long to begin
their efforts to take Plaintiff’s deposition. 

 
IV.       CONCLUSION 
 
            Based on
the foregoing, the motion is DENIED.  
 
Clerk of the Court to give notice.
