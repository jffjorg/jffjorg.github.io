Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on two motions filed by Plaintiff Rachel Sungwon Yun: a motion to strike Defendant Hirschowitz's memorandum of costs and a motion in limine to exclude four proposed witnesses (Olga Palomar, Marla Lopez, Sara Campuzano, and Cindy Gonzalez) from testifying at trial.

Regarding the motion to strike costs, the court finds that Hirschowitz is a prevailing defendant and may seek discretionary costs if he shows that Plaintiff's FEHA claim was frivolous or lacking in objective merit. The court also finds that Plaintiff's motion to strike costs is premature and will continue the motion to allow the parties to brief the issue.

Regarding the motion in limine to exclude witnesses, the court finds that the proposed witnesses were not specifically identified in Defendant's discovery responses, but that the omission was not willful. The court denies Plaintiff's motion to exclude the witnesses and instead allows Plaintiff to depose them.

The court will hear from the parties on the issue of whether Plaintiff's non-FEHA claims are inextricably intertwined with her FEHA claims and will make a ruling on the motion to strike costs at a later date.
