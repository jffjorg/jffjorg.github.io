CASE NAME:                        Gail
Chelebian v. General Motors, LLC, et al. 
 
MOVING PARTY:                Plaintiff, Gail Chelebian
¿¿¿ 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Defendant, General Motors, LLC 
 
TRIAL DATE:                       June
2, 2025 
¿¿¿ 
MOTION:¿                              (1) Motion to Compel Defendant’s Compliance with the Court’s Discovery
Order
                                                
Tentative Rulings:                  (1)   Because
GM has not responded to Ms. Randolph’s August 1, 2024 declaration on the record
before the Court GM appears to have failed to comply with a prior discovery
order, which warrants evidentiary sanctions. 
The Court’s tentative is to enter evidence sanctions that (1) GM engineers
were aware of the Chevy Bolt Battery Defect, as to the same symptoms plaintiff
later reports to GM authorized dealers in her repair history, prior to the sale
of the subject vehicle to Plaintiff, and (2) that neither GM nor the selling GM
dealership disclosed the Battery Defect to Plaintiff.  The issue sanction is reasonable given that
the Court finds that GM has failed to comply with a very specific court order
that GM produce a document that shows the date on which a GM engineer first
learned of a customer complaint of the same type of symptoms with a Chevy Volt
vehicle that the Plaintiff alleges she experienced in her repair history of the
subject vehicle.  GM has also failed to
provide the warranty complaint information of other customers’ complaints bearing
on Chevy Volt vehicles despite a prior court order to do so.  The Court also tentatively awards $5,000 in
monetary sanctions, payable by defense counsel or by GM to Plaintiff’s counsel
on or before September 9, 2024.  The Court
will take oral argument as to whether any further discovery orders should be
made.
 
I. BACKGROUND¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿ 
A. Factual¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿ 
On October 19, 2022, Gail Chelebian
(“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against General Motors LLC (“GM”). On January
12, 2023, Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) alleging causes of
action for: (1) Violation of Subdivision(D) of Civil Code section 1793.2; (2)
Violation of Subdivision(B) of Civil Code section 1793.2; (3) Violation of
Subdivision (A)(3) of Civil Code Section 1793.2; (4) Breach of the Implied
Warrant of Merchantability; and (5) Fraudulent Inducement – Concealment. This
action is based on the fact that on or about December 29, 2017, Plaintiff
entered into a warranty contract regarding a 2017 Chevrolet Bolt EV, VIN
1G1FX6S0XH4189565 (the “Subject Vehicle” or “Bolt”). (See FAC, ¶ 6.)
 
On January 27, 2023, Plaintiff propounded
Requests for Production of Documents, Set One, seeking documents relating to
GM’s internal investigation and analysis, among other things, of the batter
Defects. Specifically, Plaintiff notes she requested that Defendant produce
documents concerning: (A) The Subject Vehicle (i.e., RFP Nos. 1, 7); (B) GM’s
Internal Knowledge and Investigation regarding the Battery Defects in 2017
Chevrolet Bolt EV Vehicles (i.e., RFP Nos. 17, 23, 24, 25, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40,
41, 42); (C) Summaries, Memoranda, and Power Points regarding the Battery
Defects in 2017 Chevrolet Bolt EV Vehicles (i.e., RFP Nos. 43, 44, 45); (D)
Song Beverly Act and Buyback Policies and Procedures (i.e., RFP No. 58, 59,
68); (E) Communication With Governmental Agencies and Suppliers regarding the
Battery Defects in 2017 Chevrolet Bolt EV Vehicles (i.e., RFP Nos. 76, 78, 79);
(F) Dealer Agreements and GM’s Financial Documents (i.e., RFP Nos. 85); and (G)
Other Documents Related To The Subject Vehicle’s Battery Defects (i.e., RFP
Nos. 90, 91, 92, 93). 
 
However, Plaintiff contends that GM
responded insufficiently to the discovery requests by either: (1) completely
refusing to produce any documents for an overwhelming majority of the requests
(i.e., RFP Nos. 17, 23, 24, 25, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 58, 59, 68,
76, 78, 79, 85, 90, 91, 92, 93) and (2) limiting the scope of discovery to
include only the Subject Vehicle (i.e., RFP Nos. 1, 7, 17, 23, 24, 25, 36, 37,
38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 58, 59, 68, 76, 78, 79, 90, 91, 92, and 93). As
such, Plaintiff has filed this Motion to Compel. Prior to the last hearing on
this motion, the parties filed a joint statement noting that the remaining RFPs
at issue were: 17, 23, 24, 25, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 76, 78, 79, and 90.
 
On September 13, 2023, this Court GRANTED
the Motion to Compel Further, in part, as to RFP Nos. 1, 7, 24-25, 42-45,
58-59, 68, 76, 78-79, and 90-93. This Court ordered compliance, verified
responses, and production of documents, by November 6, 2023. 
 
On November 6, 2023, GM served supplemental
responses to RFP Nos. 1, 7, 24-25, 42-45, 58-59, 68, 76, 78-79, and 90-93.
However, Plaintiff argues that Defendant’s document production remains
deficient, non-code compliant, and contrary to the Court’s September 13, 2023.
As such, Plaintiff has brought this Motion to Compel Compliance with the
Court’s Order. 
 
On March 8, 2024, in response to plaintiff’s
Motion to Compel Defendant’s compliance with the Court’s September 13, 2024
discovery order and prospective sanctions, this Court asked Defendant to
provide the Bates Numbers or numbers of the responsive documents GM produced,
but Defendant was unable to do so against because GM had not provided such
documents to Plaintiff to begin with. Further, on March 22, 2024, Plaintiff
notes that Defendant was ordered to serve Plaintiff further responses regarding
issues presented in the tentative ruling by April 12, 2024. Specifically,
Plaintiff notes that as to RFP Nos. 24-25, according to this Court’s order,
among other documents, Defendant GM was compelled to produce a single document
that evidences the date and circumstances when a GM employee with the title or
job description of engineer first learned of the existence of a batter
charging, melting, or burning problem in a Chevrolet Volt vehicle. However, as
of the date of this filing Plaintiff contends that GM has not produced such a
document. 
 
On July 12, 2024, Plaintiff notes that
Defendant served second supplemental responses to only RFP Nos. 24 and 25, but
later served verifications on July 18, 2024. 
 
B. Procedural¿¿¿ 
¿¿ 
            On January 30, 2024, Plaintiff filed
this Motion to Compel Defendant’s Compliance with the Court’s September 13,
2023 Discovery Order. On February 26, 2024, Defendant filed opposition. This
motion was originally set for March 8, 2024, where this Court continued the hearing
to March 22, 2024 to allow defense counsel to file a supplemental declaration
responding to the tentative on or before March 20, 2024. On March 20, 2024, GM
filed that supplemental declaration. 
 
On May 22, 2024, this Court continued the hearing
again, ordering that further responses regarding issues presented in the
tentative ruling were due by GM by April 12, 2024. On May 1, 2024, Plaintiff
filed an amended supplemental declaration indicating GM’s failure to comply
with the Court’s previous orders on this matter. On May 3, 2024, GM filed a
further supplemental declaration. On May 8, 2024, this Court ordered GM to
provide a duplicate copy of its actual verified written responses, whether
original, supplemental, amended or otherwise, plus the bates-numbered documents
produced. This Court noted documents were to be produced by May 30, 2024. This
Court further ordered Plaintiff to prepare a declaration for the Court’s review
regarding discovery requests that were still in question and not procedurally
compliant. 
 
On May 30, 2024, Defendant GM filed a
supplemental declaration. On May 31, 2024, Plaintiff filed a supplemental
declaration. On June 3, 2024, this Court continued the hearing on this motion
to July 18, 2022, when defense counsel asserted that responses to the discovery
at issue had been mailed the previous day. Thus, this Court continued the hearing
yet again to August 9, 2024. 
 
On August 1, 2024, Plaintiff filed a
supplemental declaration of Ebony Randolph in support of Plaintiff’s Motion to
Compel Defendant’s compliance with this Court’s September 13, 2023, discovery
order and Motion for Sanctions. 
 
II. ANALYSIS¿¿ 
 
A.   
Legal Standard 
 
 A
party must respond to interrogatories within 30 days after service. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2030.260, subd. (a).) If a party to whom interrogatories are directed
does not provide timely responses, the requesting party may move for an order
compelling responses to the discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd.
(b).) The party also waives the right to make any objections, including one
based on privilege or work-product protection. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290,
subd. (a).) There is no time limit for a motion to compel responses to
interrogatories other than the cut-off on hearing discovery motions 15 days
before trial. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2024.020, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc.,
2030.290.) No meet and confer efforts are required before filing a motion to
compel responses to the discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290; Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 390, 411
 
B.   
Discussion 
 
Plaintiff asserts
that RFP No. 24 requested: ““ALL DOCUMENTS, including ESI and emails,
regarding when Chevrolet engineers learned, became aware of, or were notified
about, BATTERY DEFECT(S) in CHEVROLET VEHICLES that are equipped with the same
battery system as the SUBJECT VEHICLE.”
 
Further, Plaintiff contends that RFP No. 25
requested “All DOCUMENTS, including ESI and emails, regarding when any member
of YOUR Recall committee first learned, became aware of, or was notified about,
BATTERY DEFECT(S) in CHEVROLET VEHICLES that equipped with the same battery
system as the SUBJECT VEHICLE, or problems or potential problems with the
battery system of CHEVROLET VEHICLES that equipped with the same battery system
as the SUBJECT VEHICLE. [This Request requires Defendant to produce all
associated DOCUMENTS where applicable by the Custodian’s name, job title, and
job description.]”
 
However, Plaintiff asserts that for both RFP
Nos. 24 and 25, Defendant provided the same answer and documents, “Subject to
the terms and conditions of the Court’s Order, and after reasonable search and
diligent inquiry, GM states that it has complied in whole and has produced all
documents within its possession, custody, or control responsive to this
Request, and refers Plaintiff to the following additionally produced documents:
Part 573 Safety Recall Report (CHELEBIAN000009776 - CHELEBIAN000009778),” despite
the questions asking two questions. 
 
On July 18, 2024, Plaintiff notes that she
sent a copy of the previous MTC transcript to Defendant GM as previously
ordered by the Court in order to clarify any misunderstanding Defendant may
have regarding this Court’s previous order to GM to produce “a single document
that evidences the date and circumstances when a GM employee with the title or
job description of engineer first learned of the existence of a battery
charging, melting, or burning problem in a Chevrolet Volt vehicle.” On that
same day, Plaintiff further notes that Defendant produced a “Part 573 Safety
Recall Report,” (Exhibit 3), that does not evidence the date and circumstances
when a GM employee with the title or job description of engineer first learned
of the existence of a battery charging, melting, or burning problem in a
Chevrolet Volt vehicle, but rather a safety recall report Defendant GM
submitted on November 13, 2020 to the NHTSA as required under 49 C.F.R. section
579.21. Plaintiff asserts that this report does not evidence the date and
circumstances when a GM employee with the title or job description of engineer
first learned of the existence of a battery charging, melting, or burning
problem in a Chevrolet Volt vehicle, rather it is a copy of GM’s own safety
recall previously submitted to the NHTSA. 
 
Next, Plaintiff’s declaration also indicates
that GM’s document production remains deficient, non-code-compliant, and
contrary to the Court’s previous orders. In short, Plaintiff argues that
Defendant failed to produce documents responsive to RFP Nos. 24-25, 42-45,
58-59, 68, and 76. Plaintiff also contends that GM was further ordered to
produce ESI and emails related to internal investigation and analysis of the
defects. Plaintiff notes that GM has not produced any emails, ESI, or internal
analysis regarding the defects as ordered. Instead, Plaintiff notes that GM has
only produced nine “recalls” and nine TSBs, which is the same eighteen (18) documents
produced from November 2023. 
 
            Plaintiff
also notes that GM has failed to produce documents responsive to RFP Nos.
42-45, where GM was compelled to produce non-privileged documents such as a
warranty policy letter, diagnostic manual, TSB, work instruction or repair
procedure disseminated to the dealer body that evidences a remedy, repair, or
component replacement to address a customer complaint – applicable to a model
year 2017 Chevy Volt – of a failure to maintain or reach a full charge, or for
a battery-related fire, melting, or burning complaint. 
 
            Next,
Plaintiff contends that GM has also failed to produce documents responsive to RFP
Nos. 58-59, 68, 76, and 76, where GM was compelled to produce e-mails, letters,
or other "Communications" between GM and either NHTSA or EPA
regarding a report to either of those government agencies or a response to a
request from either of those agencies that evidences a remedy, repair, or
component replacement applicable to the battery in a model year 2017 Chevy Volt
of a failure of an e-vehicle battery to maintain or reach a full charge, or for
a battery-related fire, melting, or burning complaint. Instead, Defendant
produced one “Part 573 Safety Recall Report.”
 
            Based
on the above, Plaintiff argues that GM continues to be in violation of all of
the previously issued Court Orders, as GM has failed to produce further
verified responses and supplemental production of documents as aforementioned. 
 
            Plaintiff
further contends that Defendant failed to search databases and document
repositories GM maintains in the ordinary course of business: Customer
Assistance Center (CAC), Product Assistance Center (PAC), Technical Assistance
Center (TAC), Field Information Network Database (FIND), Company Vehicle
Evaluation Program (CVEP), Captured Testing Fleet (CTF), Early Quality Feedback
(EQF), Problem Resolution Tracking System (PRTS), Field Product Report Database
(FPRD), Global Incident Management System (GIMS), GM Legal records, and Global
Analysis and Reporting Tool (GART) to comply with Request for Production Nos.
1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 13, and 20. Plaintiff argues that GM has used these databases to
respond to NHTSA investigations in the past. As such, in the matter of NHTSA
preliminary evaluation 20-016 and PE18-012, GM searched these databases to
identify and produce documents and information responsive to NHTSA’s requests.
For example, Plaintiff notes GM searched the GART warranty database using labor
codes potentially related to the alleged defect. Plaintiff notes that the
information contained in these databases is relevant to the investigation of
alleged defects in GM vehicles. Plaintiff further notes the databases contain a
wealth of information on vehicle production, customer complaints, warranty
claims, field reports, engineering analyses, and other data that can help NHTSA
assess the safety and performance of GM vehicles. 
 
            On
the record before it, with no GM response to Plaintiff’s August 1, 2024
declaration, it appears that GM has failed to comply with the previous court
order, warranting monetary and evidence sanctions.  The Court will address or argument as to whether
further discovery orders are warranted given eh Court’s tentative to award both
monetary and evidence sanctions.
