And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a Tentative Ruling in the case of Katelyn Dow Stepanyan v. General Motors, LLC. The Judge has sustained the defendant's demurrer to the plaintiff's fraud causes of action, finding that the allegations are insufficient to state a claim. The Judge has also sustained the demurrer to the plaintiff's UCL cause of action, finding that the allegations do not state a claim for unfair competition. The Judge has allowed the plaintiff to provide oral argument as to what additional or new allegations can be alleged to overcome the deficiencies in the pleadings.

The Judge has also ruled that the defendant's motion to strike the plaintiff's prayer for punitive damages is moot, as the demurrer has been sustained and the prayer for punitive damages is not supported by the pleadings.

The Judge has ordered the defendant to give notice of the Tentative Ruling.
