**Significant Statements**
```
- "The function of a motion for summary judgment or adjudication is to allow a determination as to whether an opposing party cannot show evidentiary support for a pleading or claim and to enable an order of summary dismissal without the need for trial."
- "The Court requires oral argument from both parties on this issue as it does not see anything in the opposition brief that addresses the standing issue."
- "Plaintiffs have carried their shifted burden in raising triable issues of fact that a jury needs to decide as to whether the use of the jack stand with the airbag and without a bottle jack would have been reasonably foreseeable."
- "Matrix has submitted over 50 pages of evidentiary objections for the Court to rule on, the Court has not yet made its rulings but will do so after taking oral argument on the other issues."
```

**English Text Summary**

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication filed by Defendant Matrix Service, Inc. The motion is based on the grounds that the causes of action for negligence, strict liability, and breach of warranties asserted in the pleadings provide no triable issues of material fact, thereby entitling Matrix to judgment as a matter of law. The Judge has identified three issues to be addressed: (1) standing of Soto Plaintiffs, (2) misuse and foreseeable misuse affirmative defenses, and (3) defect of jack stand component part. The Judge has tentatively found that Matrix has carried its initial burden on the issues of misuse and foreseeable misuse affirmative defenses and defect of jack stand component part, but has raised triable issues of fact that a jury needs to decide. The Judge has also ordered oral argument on the issues of standing and misuse and foreseeable misuse affirmative defenses.
