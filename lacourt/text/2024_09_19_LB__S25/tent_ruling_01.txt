  Case Number:  22LBCV00165    Hearing Date:   September 19, 2024    Dept:  S25 Defendants and Cross-Complainants QNDM Properties, LLC, QNDM Distribution, LLC and Kelly Marie Dooley’s Motion to Compel Cross-Defendant JOHN BARRETT Jr. to Respond to Cross-Complainants’ SPECIAL INTERROGATORIES, Set One, without Objection and Request for Monetary SanctionBackgroundOn September 5, 2024, the Court granted Mr. Cha’s motion to withdraw as counsel for John Barrett Jr.’s motion to be relieved as counsel. (September 5, 2024 Minute Order.) It is unclear whether Cross-Defendant John Barrett received notice of this pending motion or the September 19, 2024 hearing date.Legal StandardIf a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to respond at all, the propounding party’s remedy is to seek a court order compelling answers thereto. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290.) All that needs to be shown is that the discovery was properly served on the opposing party, that the time to respond has expired, and that no response of any kind has been served. The moving party is not required to show a reasonable and good faith attempt to resolve the matter informally before filing this motion. A motion to compel initial discovery responses need not show good cause, meeting and conferring, or timely filing, and need not be accompanied by a separate statement. (See Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pac. Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 404.) The failure to timely respond also waives all objections.¿¿On motion, a party may be relieved from its waiver of objections if: (1) the party subsequently served a response that is in substantial compliance “with Sections 2030.210, 2030.220, 2030.230, and 2030.240” and (2) “[t]he party’s failure to serve a timely response was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a)(1)-(2).)Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.290, subd. (c), provides that, "[t]he court shall impose a monetary sanction . . . against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust." Code Civ. Proc. § 2023.010, subd. (d), provides that a misuse of the discovery process is failing to respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery. Code Civ. Proc. § 2023.010, subd. (h), states that a misuse of the discovery process includes making or opposing, unsuccessfully and without substantial justification, a motion to compel or limit discovery. A court may impose a monetary sanction against a party engaging in the misuse of the discovery process or any attorney advising such conduct under Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (a). A court has discretion to fix the amount of reasonable monetary sanctions. (Cornerstone Realty Advisors, LLC v. Summit Healthcare Reit, Inc. (2020) 56 Cal.App.5th 771.)AnalysisCross-Complainants propounded Special Interrogatories, Set One, on Cross-Defendant John Barrett on June 27, 2024. (Trauben Decl., ¶¶ 5 & 7, Ex. C & E.) On July 5, 2024, in part, based upon Defendant and Cross-Complainant Mark A. Bruno having substituted in new counsel in this matter, Cross-Complainants sent a comprehensive global email to all counsel setting forth and confirming the deadlines for all parties to respond to their respective discovery requests; the deadline for Cross-Defendant Barrett to respond to Special Interrogatories was on July 30, 2024. (Trauben Decl., ¶¶ 8 & 9, Ex. F.)On July 31, 2024, after receiving no responses to the Special Interrogatories, Set One, from Cross-Defendant Barrett, Cross-Complainant sent a meet and confer correspondence via email. (Trauben Decl., ¶ 11, Ex. G.)On August 1, 2024, Cross-Defendant Barrett’s counsel of record, John Cha, responded to advise that he intended to withdraw as counsel but did not indicate whether Cross-Defendant Barrett intended to respond to Cross-Complainants’ Special Interrogatories, Set One. (Trauben Decl., ¶ 12.) To date, Cross-Defendant Barrett has failed and/or refused to answer or otherwise respond to Cross-Complainants’ Discovery Requests and have failed and/or refused to serve any responses or objections to Cross-Complainants’ Discovery Requests. (Trauben Decl., ¶ 14.)On September 5, 2024, the Court granted Mr. Cha’s motion to withdraw as counsel for John Barrett. (September 5, 2024 Minute Order.) However, it is unclear whether Cross-Defendant Barrett received notice of this pending motion or the September 19, 2024 hearing date.Tentative RulingAlthough the Court’s tentative is to order Cross-Defendant Barrett to provide objection-less responses to the SPECIAL INTERROGATORIES by November 14, 2024, the Court continues the matter to October 23, 2024 to ensure that Cross-Defendant Barrett is given notice of hearing and the Court’s tentative ruling.The Court will give notice to Cross-Defendant John Barrett of the October 23, 2024 hearing and this tentative ruling.The Court declines to award monetary sanctions against Cross-Defendant Barrett in this instance as Cross-Defendant Barrett is without counsel currently. However, further continued failure by Cross-Defendant Barrett to timely respond to discovery requests or engage in the discovery process, including any request for further responses by Cross-Complainants may result in future monetary sanctions.Defendants and Cross-Complainants QNDM Properties, LLC, QNDM Distribution, LLC and Kelly Marie Dooley’s Motion to Compel Cross-Defendant JOHN BARRETT, JR. to Respond to Cross-Complainants’ FORM INTERROGATORIES, Set One, without Objection and Request for Monetary SanctionBackgroundOn September 5, 2024, the Court granted Mr. Cha’s motion to withdraw as counsel for John Barrett Jr.’s motion to be relieved as counsel.
