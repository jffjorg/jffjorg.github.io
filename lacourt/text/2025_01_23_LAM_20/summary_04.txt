And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a landlord-tenant dispute between Justin Shelton (the plaintiff) and WIB Holdings, LLC and Barbara Bills (the defendants). The defendants have moved to compel arbitration of the matter, arguing that the arbitration agreement between the parties includes a clear and unmistakable delegation clause. The judge has agreed with the defendants, holding that the language of the delegation clause is clear and unmistakable and that it is not revocable under state contract defenses such as fraud, duress, or unconscionability. The judge has granted the Motion to Compel Arbitration and has stayed the action pending the resolution of the arbitration. The arbitrator will determine arbitrability, and the plaintiff's objections have been sustained.
