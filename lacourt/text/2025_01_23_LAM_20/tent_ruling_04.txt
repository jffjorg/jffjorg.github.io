This is a landlord-tenant dispute.  On May 17, 2024, Plaintiff Justin Shelton filed a Complaint for (1) unlawful retention of security deposit, (2) violation of the UCL, (3) declaratory relief, (4) breach of written lease, (5) negligence, and (6) conversion.Defendants WIB Holdings, LLC and Barbara Bills now seek to compel arbitration of this matter. The subject arbitration agreement includes a delegation clause.  Parties to an arbitration agreement may agree to delegate to the arbitrator, instead of a court, questions regarding the enforceability of the agreement.”  (Pinela v. Neiman Marcus Group, Inc. (2015) 238 Cal.App.4th 227, 239.)   “There are two prerequisites for a delegation clause to be effective. First, the language of the clause must be clear and unmistakable. [Citation.] Second, the delegation must not be revocable under state contract defenses such as fraud, duress, or unconscionability.”  (Aanderud v. Superior Court (2017) 13 Cal.App.5th 880, 891-892.)  Here, the language of the delegation clause is clear and unmistakable: “any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or relating in any way to Tenant’s occupancy of the Premises or to any breach of the Rental Agreement between the parties concerning the Premises, or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity of the Renal Agreement (including the determination of the scope or applicability of this Agreement) shall be exclusively resolved by binding arbitration in Los Angeles, California." Further, Plaintiff has failed to establish the substantive unconscionability of the delegation clause itself.  Actually, the delegation clause is not mentioned in the Opposition. Thus, the Motion to Compel Arbitration is granted.  The arbitrator is to determine arbitrability.  This action is stayed pending the resolution of arbitration.  (Code Civ. Proc. § 1281.4.)  Plaintiff’s objections are sustained.Moving party to give notice.
