And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the plaintiff's motion to compel in part, denying it in part. The plaintiff had requested to compel the deposition of the defendant's PMK, arguing that the defendant had failed to produce a witness to be deposed on the noticed categories and had engaged in gamesmanship. The defendant had agreed to produce a PMQ on 9 of the 23 categories in the plaintiff's PMK deposition notice, but the court found the categories noticed by the plaintiff to be overbroad and the defendant's proposed scope of the PMQ deposition to be too narrow. The court limits the temporal scope of all other requests to the period of purchase to the present and finds all noticed deposition categories related to the subject vehicle to be relevant.
