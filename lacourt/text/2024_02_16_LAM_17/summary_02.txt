And here is the English text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by the defendants, County of Los Angeles, et al. (the County). The County argues that the plaintiff, Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, LLP (Quinn), has failed to state a valid claim as a matter of law. The judge agrees with the County's contention that each of Quinn's causes of action (breach of contract, services rendered/quantum meruit, promissory estoppel, and open book account) is barred by California's Government Claims Act and is unsupported by sufficient facts in Quinn's complaint to state a valid claim.

The judge notes that Quinn has not alleged any facts that could show compliance with the Government Claims Act's requirement that claims against a public entity be presented in a timely manner and in accordance with specific procedures before any lawsuit is filed. The judge also finds that Quinn has failed to raise these claims as counterclaims as required by CCP section 426.30.

The judge cites several precedents, including California's compulsory cross-complaint statute (CCP section 426.30), California's declaratory relief statute (CCP section 426.60(c)), and other court decisions, to support its conclusion. The judge sustains the County's demurrer without leave to amend, meaning that Quinn's complaint will be dismissed without the opportunity to amend it.

The judge notes that this decision is reinforced by the fact that Quinn was denied leave to amend to file a cross-complaint by Judge Fujie, after Judge Fujie concluded that Quinn had acted intentionally and in bad faith in its delay to move for such leave. The judge also notes that allowing Quinn's claims to go forward would not only lead to an unnecessary "duplication of time and effort" but could also lead to conflicting rulings and complicate Quinn's appeal of Judge Fujie's ruling, which is currently pending.
