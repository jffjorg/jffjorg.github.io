 Case Number:  23STCV19134    Hearing Date:   February 16, 2024    Dept:  17 Superior Court of California County of Los  Angeles   DEPARTMENT 17   TENTATIVE RULING      QUINN EMANUEL URQUHART & SULLIVAN, LLP                 vs.   COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES, et al.        Case    No.:  23STCV19134           Hearing Date:  February 16, 2024                  Defendants’  demurrer is SUSTAINED WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND.                On  12/18/2023, Plaintiff Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, LLP filed suit  against Defendants County of Los Angeles (County), Los Angeles County Sheriff’s  Department (the Sheriff’s Department), and former Los Angeles County Sheriff  Alex Villanueva (Villanueva), in his official capacity (collectively,  Defendants), alleging:  (1) breach of  contract; (2) services rendered/quantum meruit; (3) promissory estoppel; and  (4) open book account.                Now,  Defendants demur to Plaintiff’s Complaint.    Factual Background               This  action arises out of fees allegedly owed to Plaintiff incurred during its  representation of Villanueva in 2019.    Discussion                           Defendants  argue that each of Plaintiff’s causes of action is barred by California’s  Government Claims Act, forfeited under California’s compulsory counterclaim  statute, and is unsupported by sufficient facts in Quinn’s complaint to state a  valid claim as a matter of law.               As  to the first contention, Plaintiff has not alleged any facts which could show  compliance with the Government Claims Act’s requirement that claims against a  public entity be presented in a timely manner and in accordance with specific  procedures before any lawsuit is filed.               As  to the second contention, Defendants argue that County of Los Angeles v.  Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan LLP, No. 21STCV42264 (Super. Ct.)  (“County v. Quinn”) addressed the same threshold questions here, and Plaintiff  failed to raise these claims as counterclaims as required by CCP section  426.30.                After  review, the Court agrees.    To prevent  “piecemeal litigation” like this action, California’s compulsory  cross-complaint statute provides that any cause of action “related” to a  complaint must be brought as a cross-complaint or else not brought at all. (CCP  § 426.30; see also id. § 426.10(c); Wittenberg v. Bornstein  (2020) 51 Cal. App. 5th 556, 564.) California courts require that section  426.30 “be liberally construed to advance its purpose.” (Heshejin v. Rostami  (2020) 54 Cal. App. 5th 984, 993.) As a result, the statute requires “only a  logical relationship” between the two claims, not “an absolute identity of  factual backgrounds.” (Align Tech., Inc. v. Tran (2009) 179 Cal. App.  4th 949, 960) (quoting Currie Med. Specialties, Inc. v. Bowen (1982) 136  Cal. App. 3d 774, 777). In the case of a breach of contract, “any claims the  defendant has against the plaintiff based on the same contract generally must  be asserted in a cross-complaint.” (Frog Creek Partners, LLC v. Vance Brown,  Inc. (2012) 206 Cal. App. 4th 515, 538.)   Here,  Plaintiff’s entire complaint logically relates to Defendants’ December 2021  complaint for declaratory judgment. (Currie Medical, supra, 136  Cal. App. 3d at 777.) The threshold legal issue in that action and in this case  is the same: whether the purported retainer agreement between Quinn Emanuel and  Villanueva was a valid contract. Indeed, Judge Fujie already ruled on that  question in the declaratory judgment action, finding that the purported  retainer agreement was invalid and could not bind the County Defendants. As  such, to allow this claim to go forward here would not only lead to an  unnecessary “duplication of time and effort,” but could also lead to  conflicting rulings. It would also complicate Plaintiff’s appeal of Judge  Fujie’s ruling which is actively pending. (See City of Hanford v. Superior  Court (1989) 208 Cal. App. 3d 580, 587–88) (“[P]ermitting leave to file a  cross-complaint after judgment has been entered on the complaint does not  further the purpose for cross-complaints,” and “allowing a party to assert  cross-complaints while a case is pending on appeal[] could create chaos with  the appellate process.”).     This  conclusion is reinforced by the fact that Plaintiff here was denied leave to  amend to file a cross-complaint by Judge Fujie, after Judge Fudgie concluded  that Plaintiff had acted intentionally and in bad faith in its delay to move  for such leave. More specifically, Judge Fujie found Plaintiff, “made a  strategic and calculated decision not to preserve [its] rights,” and “to the  extent there is any potential forfeiture it was [Quinn Emanuel’s] deliberate  decision that caused it.” (Portnoi Decl. Ex. Q.)   In  opposition, Plaintiff argues that its claims were not compulsory due to the  nature of the declaratory judgment action, citing CCP section 426.60(c).  However, section 426.60(c) provides that the rule of forfeiture “does not apply  where the only relief sought is a declaration of the rights and  duties of the respective parties in an action for declaratory relief.”  (emphasis added.) Here, on its face, Defendants’ complaint sought additional relief,  including an order preliminarily and permanently enjoining the pending  arbitration, as well as and costs of suit. (Portnoi Decl., Ex. I) As noted by  Defendants in reply, other Courts have concluded that section 426.60(c) did not  apply where plaintiff sought both declaratory and injunctive relief. (See  e.g. AEG Holdco LLC v. Vazquez (C.D. Cal. Sept. 22, 2021)  2021 WL 4859975, at *10 (applying California  law and finding section 426.60(c) did not apply where plaintiff sought both  declaratory and injunctive relief); 4 Witkin, California Procedure (6th ed.  2023), Pleading § 42 (“Another basis distinction is between the cause of  action…and the remedy or relief sought.”) San Diego Unified Sch. Dist. v.  County of San Diego (2009) 170 Cal. App. 4th 288, 305 (same).    Based on the  foregoing, Defendants’ demurrer is sustained without leave to amend.    It is so ordered.    Dated:  February     , 2024                                                                                                                                                                Hon.
