**English-text summary:**

The Judge's tentative ruling grants Defendant Sergio Rodriguez Vasquez's motion for judgment on the pleadings. The court finds that the doctrine of collateral estoppel applies, which means that the issue of ownership in the subject property has already been adjudicated in a prior proceeding. The probate court had previously determined that the subject property belonged to Defendant, and this decision is final and conclusive. The court declines to address the remaining arguments raised by Defendant, citing judicial economy.
