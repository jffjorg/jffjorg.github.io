```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reconsidered its October 3, 2023 order granting Keane's motion to compel. The court finds that the order was issued in error because the Robles Defendants did not receive proper notice of the motion. The court also finds that Keane's representation that the Robles Defendants failed to respond to his Form Interrogatories (Set One) was false. Therefore, the court vacates the October 3, 2023 order and denies Keane's motion to compel as moot.
