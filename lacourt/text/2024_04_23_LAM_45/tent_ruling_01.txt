Background
            Plaintiffs
Shaila Mantri and Subhash Mantri filed this action on September 9, 2020 against
defendants Those Certain Underwriters At Lloyd’s, London Subscribing To Policy
Number HGB0140086 (or “Lloyd’s”); Joan Allyn Schultz dba Joan Schultz Insurance
Agency (erroneously sued as two separate entities); and Washington &
Finnegan, Inc., alleging causes of action for (1) Breach of Contract; (2)
Breach of the Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing; (3) Negligence;
(4) Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress; (5) Professional Negligence;
and (6) Fraud.
            The
Complaint alleges the following: Plaintiffs’ home was burglarized on November
30, 2019. (Compl., ¶ 1.) Plaintiffs submitted a claim to their insurance
carrier, Lloyd’s. (Id. at ¶ 1.) Instead of investigating, adjusting, and
paying the claim in a timely and reasonable manner, Lloyd’s unreasonably and in
bad faith disputed the veracity and extent of the claim, ignored reliable
documents that support the claim, and has thus far paid Plaintiffs nothing. (Id.
at ¶ 1.) Further, Plaintiffs learned that their insurance broker for their
insurance policy, Joan Schultz Insurance Agency, negligently and fraudulently
obtained woefully inadequate insurance coverage for Plaintiffs’ personal
property. (Id. at ¶ 2.) Schultz negligently and fraudulently represented
to Plaintiffs that they could only obtain personal property coverage with a
limit of $300,000. (Id. at ¶ 2.)
            On
October 17, 2023, Plaintiffs filed the instant motion. On April 10, 2024,
Defendants filed their opposition. On April 16, 2024, Plaintiffs filed their
reply. 
Legal Standard
CCP § 2025.450(a) states: “If, after service
of a deposition notice, a party to the action or an officer, director, managing
agent, or employee of a party, or a person designated by an organization that
is a party under Section 2025.230, without having served a valid objection under
Section 2025.410, fails to appear for examination, or to proceed with it, or to
produce for inspection any document, electronically stored information, or
tangible thing described in the deposition notice, the party giving the notice
may move for an order compelling the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and
the production for inspection of any document, electronically stored
information, or tangible thing described in the deposition notice.”
The motion must be accompanied by a
declaration showing a reasonable and good faith attempt to informally
resolve each issue presented or, when the deponent fails to attend the
deposition and produce the requested documents or things, the motion must be
accompanied by a declaration stating that the petitioner has contacted the
deponent to inquire about the nonappearance. (CCP § 2025.450(b)(2).)
Discussion
Plaintiffs move to compel the depositions of Those Certain Underwriters
At Lloyd’s, London Subscribing To Policy Number HGB0140086’s Person Most Qualified
(“PMQ”). Plaintiffs contend they served three Notices of Deposition, Defendants
objected to said depositions, and Plaintiffs followed up on multiple occasions
regarding new dates, but Defendant never responded. (Jacobson Decl. ¶23.) 
Defendants do not dispute that Plaintiffs are entitled to depose their PMQ.
Defendants note that the delay was due in part to
the PMQ suffering serious health problems. (Opp. at 2:15-16). Defendants state
that they “intend to proceed with the deposition, Mr. Sargeant’s health
permitting, on May 8, 2024. Defendants do not object to the Court setting a
deadline for completing the deposition remotely of Mr. Sargeant as Lloyd’s PMQ:
Mr. Sargeant lives in London, England.” (Picker Decl., ¶ 7.)
In reply, Plaintiffs argue that Defendants
failed to inform them that the PMQ was suffering from these serious health
problems until February 15, 2024, and after this motion was filed. (Reply p.4.)

The court finds Plaintiffs sufficiently show this motion should be
granted. Plaintiffs’ counsel shows they properly noticed these depositions on March
18, 2022, May 24, 2022, and September 12, 2023. (Jacobson Decl. ¶¶ 3,5,16.) Defendants
thereafter filed a Motion for Protective Order regarding the scope of the
requested topics for the PMQ deposition. (Id. at ¶ 6; Exh. 4.) On June
15, 2022, Plaintiffs sent an email correspondence to schedule a call to narrow
the topics, however Defendant did not respond and did not schedule a call. (Id.
at ¶7, Exhibit 5). The Court ruled on the Protective Order and ruled on the
topics the PMQ should testify to. (Id. at ¶8). On April 18, 2023,
Plaintiffs sent email correspondence to Defendant requesting available dates.
(Jacobson Decl. ¶9, Exhibit 6). On April 21, 2023, Defendant advised it would
look for dates for the PMQ. (Id. at ¶10, Exhibit 7). On May 5, 2023,
Plaintiffs sent email correspondence asking for available dates, but Defendant
did not respond. (Id. at ¶11, Exhibit 7). Plaintiffs again sent email
correspondence requesting available dates. (Id. at ¶12, Exhibit 8).
Defendant’s counsel responded that they had trial in late August and would look
for dates in late September. (Id. at ¶13, Exhibit 9). Plaintiffs
responded that late September would not work as Plaintiffs’ opposition to
Defendant’s Motion for Summary Adjudication was due on September 8 and
requested if someone else could defend the deposition and provide dates. (Id.
at ¶14, Exhibit 9). On August 10, 2023, Plaintiffs sent email correspondence
asking for available dates for the PMQ deposition and Defendant did not respond
to the email. (Id. at ¶15, Exhibit 10). 
On September 12, 2023, Plaintiffs served a second amended notice for the
deposition of Defendant’s PMQ. (Id. at ¶16, Exhibit 11). Defendant
objected to the second amended notice. (Id. at ¶17, Exhibit 12). On
October 4, 2023, after Defendant objected to the second amended notice,
Plaintiffs emailed Defendant asking for available dates. (Jacobson Decl. ¶18,
Exhibit 13). On October 5, 2023, Defendant sent email correspondence stating it
would get dates, “as soon as we can.” (Id. at ¶19, Exhibit 13). On
October 9, 2023, Plaintiffs emailed Defendant following up on the previous
request and again asked for available dates. (Id. at ¶20, Exhibit 13).
On October 10, 2023, Defendant served additional discovery requests to
Plaintiffs, but did not provide available dates for the PMQ deposition. (Id.
at ¶21, Exhibit 14). On October 11, 2023, Plaintiffs, again, requested
Defendant to provide available dates before end of day on October 13, 2023,
otherwise Plaintiffs would have to move forward with a motion to compel. (Id.
at ¶22, Exhibit 15). 
On April 1, 2024, the parties agreed to remotely depose the PMQ on May
23, 2024. (Reply p.2.) 
Therefore, the court finds that the Motion to Compel Deposition is
GRANTED. 
Requests for Monetary Sanctions
Plaintiffs request $3,850.00 in monetary sanctions against Defendant Those
Certain Underwriters at Lloyd’s, London, Subscribing to Policy Number
HGB0140086’s and its counsel of record.
Plaintiffs’ counsel’s hourly rate is $550. (Jacobson Decls., ¶ 26.) Plaintiffs
request to recover two hours preparing for and attending the hearing on April
24, 2024. (Id.) However, the court finds that sanctions are unwarranted
because Defendants had substantial justification for their delay. 
Defendants request sanctions is for an unknown amount. For instance,
Defendants state “[t]heir insistence on pressing forward with the instant
motion, which arises from scheduling difficulties and serious health problems
experienced by the witness, warrants the imposition of sanctions on them. ” However,
this request for sanctions does not follow the guidelines set forth in Code of
Civil Procedure § 2023.040. Therefore, the court denies this request. Additionally,
Defendants miscommunication led to the filing of this Motion because Plaintiffs
were unaware of PMQ’s health issues until after they filed the Motion. 
            Accordingly,
the court denies Plaintiffs’ and Defendants’ requests for sanctions. 
It is so
ordered.
