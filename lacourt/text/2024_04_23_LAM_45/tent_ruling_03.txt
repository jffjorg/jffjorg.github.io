Background
Plaintiff Norma
Angelica Farias (“Plaintiff”) initiated this action on October 24, 2022 against
Defendant Sergio Rodriguez Vasquez (“Defendant”) alleging causes of action for:
(1) Unjust Enrichment; (2) Negligent/Intentional Infliction of Emotional
Distress; and (3) Injunctive Relief. 
Plaintiff alleges the
following. On January 13, 1991, Defendant and Silveria Rodriguez (“Rodriguez”)
married. (Compl. ¶ 11.) At the time of the marriage, Rodriguez had three
daughters that included Plaintiff, Ana Bella Farias, and Juliana Farias. (Id.
at ¶ 12.) On January 5, 2010, Rodriguez purchased the real property known as
1821 E. Gage Avenue, Los Angeles, CA 90001 as her sole and separate property. (Id.
at ¶ 13, Exh. A.) It is further alleged that it was Rodriguez’s intent that the
subject property would remain her sole and separate property and would be
transferred to her three daughters born prior to her marriage with Defendant. (Id.
at ¶ 14.) On March 1, 2021, Rodriguez died without a will. (Id. at ¶
15.) It is alleged that Rodriguez intended to gift the subject property to her
three daughters, who were born prior to her marriage to Defendant. (Id. at
¶ 17.) On December 8, 2021, Defendant filed a spousal property petition in the
Central District of the Los Angeles Superior Court that was assigned case
number 21STPB11643 and failed to represent to the probate court of Rodriguez’s
aforementioned intent. (Id. at ¶ 19.) Plaintiff seeks to enjoin
Defendant from selling the subject property, and if she does, then one-half of
the proceeds should be transferred to the three surviving daughters. (Id.
at ¶ 20.)
On December 7,
2022, Defendant filed his answer to the complaint. 
By way of
stipulation, Defendant filed his first amended answer to the complaint on July
7, 2023.
On March 25, 2024,
Defendant filed the instant motion for judgment on the pleadings. 
As of April 18,
2024, no opposition has been filed to the instant motion.
 
Legal Standard
 
Code of Civil Procedure
§ 438 states, in relevant part:  “(b)(1) A party may move
for judgment on the pleadings. . . . (c)(1) The motion provided for
in this section may only be made on one of the following grounds: . . . . (B)  If
the moving party is a defendant, that either of the following conditions
exist: (i) The court has no jurisdiction of the subject of the
cause of action alleged in the complaint.  (ii)  The
complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action
against that defendant.” 
A motion for judgment on the
pleadings “has the purpose and effect of a general demurrer.”  (Smiley
v. Citibank (South Dakota), N.A. (1995) 11 Cal.4th 138, 146
(citation omitted).)  “[T]he trial court generally confines
itself to the complaint and accepts as true all material facts alleged
therein.  As appropriate, however, it may extend its consideration to
matters that are subject to judicial notice.  In this, it performs
essentially the same task that it would undertake in ruling on a general
demurrer.”  (Id. (citations omitted).) 
A party moving for judgment on the pleadings
must meet and confer in person or telephonically with the party who filed the
pleading that is subject to the motion to determine if an agreement can be
reached regarding the claims raised in the motion.  (Code Civ. Proc. §
439, subd. (a).)  The moving party must file a declaration detailing
the meet and confer efforts.  (Code Civ. Proc. § 439, subd.
(a)(3).) 
 
Judicial Notice
            Defendant requests the court to take judicial
notice of the following documents: (1) Defendant’s Spousal Property Petition
filed on December 8, 2021 in case no. 21STPB11643; (2) the Notice of
Hearing-Decedent’s Estate or Trust file on January 7, 2022 in case no.
21STPB11643; (3) Plaintiff’s Request for Continuance for the Purpose of Making
a Written Response or Objection to Spousal Property Petition filed on February
18, 2022 in case no. 21STPB11643; (4) the February 18, 2022 Minute Order issued
by Judgment Michael Small in case no. 21STPB11643; (5) the Spousal or Domestic
Partner Property Order signed by Judge Michael Small on March 4, 2022 in case
no. 21STPB11643; (6) a copy of the probate court’s docket information relating
to case no. 21STPB11643; and (7) the certified grant deed recorded by the Los
Angeles Recorder’s Office on March 23, 2022. 
The court grants Defendant’s request for
judicial notice pursuant to Evidence Code § 452(c) and (d).            
 
Discussion
Defendant moves
for judgment on the pleadings on the following grounds: (1) the complaint is
barred by the doctrine of collateral estoppel; (2) the complaint is barred by
the statute of frauds; and (3) all three causes of action have been
insufficiently alleged. 
As to the first
argument, Defendant contends that the complaint is barred by the doctrine of
collateral estoppel because each cause of action concerns the issue of
ownership in the subject property and the probate court in case no. 21STPB11643
confirmed that the subject property was community property and belonged to
Defendant upon Rodriguez’s passing. (Motion at pp. 7-8.) The court agrees. 
Collateral estoppel prevents re-litigation
when the following factors are met: (1) the issue is identical to an issue
decided in a prior proceeding; (2) the issue was actually litigated; (3) the
issue was necessarily decided; (4) the decision in the prior proceeding is
final and on the merits; and (5) the party against whom collateral estoppel is
asserted was a party or in privity with a party to the prior proceeding. (Gabriel
v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (2010) 188 Cal.App.4th 547, 556.) An individual
in privity with a party to the prior proceeding is one who is “directly
interested in the subject matter, and had a right to make defense, or to
control the proceeding, and to appeal from the judgment.” (Bernhard v. Bank
of America (1942) 19 Cal.2d 807, 811.) Within the context of probate
proceedings, “judgment is conclusive against ‘the whole world’ and not just the
parties to the litigation.” (Heiser v. Superior Court (1979) 88
Cal.App.3d 276, 278, 278.) 
Here, Plaintiff effectively seeks to litigate
the issue of who owns the subject property. (See Compl. ¶¶ 14, 17, 24, 29,
32-33; Jaffe v. Carroll (1973) 35 Cal. App.3d 53, 57 [“the subject
matter of an action and issues
involved are determined from the facts alleged rather than from the title of
the pleadings. . . .”].) However, this matter was adjudicated by way of
Defendant’s Spousal or Domestic Partner Property Petition pursuant to Probate
Code § 13650. (See RJN, Exh. 1.) 
As to the second element, the issue of
whether Defendant owned the subject property was determined on February 18,
2022, and pursuant to Probate Code §13656(a), the probate court determined upon
sufficient evidence that the subject property passed to Defendant without
further administration. (RJN, Exh. 3.) Moreover, even though the Grant Deed
recorded on January 20, 2010 indicates that Rodriguez took title as a married
woman as her sole and separate property, this is not dispositive because there
is a presumption that property acquired during marriage is presumed to be
community property. (In re Brace (2020) 9 Cal.5th 903; Family Code §
760.) It is only in probate proceedings is there a presumption that the named
owner on legal title to property is presumed to be the correct owner of that
property, but with any presumption, it is rebuttable. (See Estate of Wall
(2021) 68 Cal.App.5th 168.) Considering that the probate court examined the
evidence before it and concluded that Defendant was the owner of the subject
property, there is no reason to disrupt that finding. 
With regard to the third element, because the
entire purpose of the Spousal or Domestic Partner Property Petition is to
determine whether property passes to a surviving spouse and to confirm such
ownership, the issue of who owns the subject property was necessarily decided. As
to the fourth element, on March 4, 2022, the probate court issued an order
declaring that Rodriguez’s one-half interest in the subject property passed to
Defendant, and because no appeal or motion for reconsideration was filed, this
order has become final. (See RJNs, Exh. 5, 6.) 
As to the last element, Plaintiff was a party
to the probate petition because she was served notice of the hearing on January
4, 2022 and could have submitted an objection or other evidence. (RJN, Exh. 2.)
The alternative privity requirement is satisfied as well because Plaintiff was
in privity with her mother’s estate and had a direct interest in the subject
matter of the probate petition. Furthermore, by being served with notice and
attempting to continue the probate proceedings, it is clear that Plaintiff had
a right to make a defense or to control the proceedings. (RJN, Exhs. 2, 3.)
However, Plaintiff failed to appear at the February 18, 2023 hearing and did
not taken any steps to overturn the probate court’s order. (See Murray v.
Alaska Airlines, Inc. (2010) 50 Cal.4th 860, 871 [a party “cannot now take
advantage of the fact that [it] avoided its litigation responsibilities and
chose not to present evidence at the prior proceeding.”].) Therefore, the court
finds that the doctrine of collateral estoppel applies in this case and
precludes further determination on the issue of ownership in the subject
property. 
Accordingly, because the doctrine of
collateral estoppel applies, the court lacks jurisdiction to consider
Plaintiff’s complaint. In the interest of judicial economy, the court declines
to address the remaining arguments addressed by Defendant.  
Conclusion
Based on the
foregoing, the court GRANTS Defendant Sergio Rodriguez Vasquez’s motion for
judgment on the pleadings. 
 
It is so ordered.
