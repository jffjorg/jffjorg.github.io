Motion to Set Aside Order Dated October 3, 2023
 
 
            The court has considered the moving
papers and opposition. No reply was received.
            The
court on its own motion reconsiders its October 3, 2023 order. Consequently,
the October 3, 2023 order is VACATED, and Keane’s motion to compel filed
on May 15, 2023 is DENIED as moot.
 
Background
Plaintiff
Lafayette Apt. Associates, L.P. (hereinafter “Plaintiff” or “Lafayette”) filed
this action on September 2, 2021. Plaintiff filed the operative First Amended
Complaint (FAC) on December 8, 2023 against Kristine Rose J. Robles, Kristian
Apple J. Robles, Roselle Poblete, and Derek Keane, alleging the following
causes of action: (1) Breach of Contract; (2) Account Stated; (3) Restitution
for Unjust Enrichment; (4) Quantum Meruit; and (5) Conversion. The FAC alleges
that the parties entered into a lease agreement on May 4, 2019 for a monthly
rend of $2,450 for the premises located at 401 S. Lafayette Park Place, Unit
206, Los Angeles, CA 90057. (FAC ¶ 13.) Defendants allegedly breached the
agreement on May 1, 2020 by failing to pay rent. (Id. at ¶ 16.)
Defendants allegedly owe to date a total of $39,802.47 in past due rent and
utilities.
On December 6,
2022, Dereke Keane filed a Cross-Complaint on December 6, 2022 against
Lafayette and his co-defendants, alleging the following causes of action: (1)
Retaliatory Eviction; and (2) Contribution. The Cross-Complaint alleges
Lafayette unlawfully evicted Keane based on his inability to pay under the
then-applicable Civil Code § 1942.5(d). (Cross-Compl. ¶ 9.) Keane alleges the
eviction was wrongful since the three-day notice overstated the amount that was
actually due. (Id. at ¶ 10.) The eviction was also wrongful because the
tenants were protected by Civil Code § 1511, as their ability to pay rent
starting in March 2020 was attributable to governmental regulations. (Id.
at ¶ 11.) Further, Keane alleges the eviction violated the City and County
Covid eviction moratoria, the Tenant Relief Act of 2020 and the Tenant
Protection Act of 2019. (Id. at ¶ 12.)
On May 15, 2023,
Keane filed a motion to compel cross-defendants Kristine Rose J. Robles,
Kristian Apple J. Robles, Roselle Poblete to provide verified responses without
objections to Form Interrogatories (Set One) and for sanctions in the amount
$1,000.
On October 3,
2023, the court granted Keane’s unopposed motion to compel and ordered
cross-defendants Kristine Rose J. Robles, Kristian Apple J. Robles, Roselle
Poblete to serve verified responses without objections to Form Interrogatories
(Set One) within 30 days of the date of the ruling and to, jointly and
severally, to pay $500 to Keane within 20 days of the date of the ruling.
On October 18,
2023, cross-defendants Kristine Rose J. Robles, Kristian Apple J. Robles,
Roselle Poblete (collectively, the “Robles Defendants”) filed the instant
motion to set aside the October 3, 2023 order pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure § 473(b).
Keane filed his
opposition on October 20, 2023, consisting solely of the Declaration of Ken
Carlson. No reply has been received.
 
Legal
Standard
Code of Civil Procedure § 473(b) states in
pertinent part,
The court may,
upon any terms as may be just, relieve a party or his or her legal
representative from a judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken
against him or her through his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or
excusable neglect. Application for this relief … shall be made within a
reasonable time, in no case exceeding six months, after the judgment,
dismissal, order, or proceeding was taken. … Notwithstanding any other
requirements of this section, the court shall, whenever an application for
relief is made no more than six months after entry of judgment, is in proper
form, and is accompanied by an attorney's sworn affidavit attesting to his or
her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect, vacate any … dismissal entered
against his or her client. . . .
 
Discussion
            Here,
the Robles Defendants contend that the October 3, 2023 order was entered on the
mistake of Keane because the Robles Defendants did not receive proper notice of
the motion as their attorney had not received the motion by facsimile on March
13, 2023. (Motion at pg. 4; Chandler Decl. ¶¶ 2-5.) The Robles Defendants’
attorney attests that they received a separate motion unrelated to the
discovery motion levied against them. (Chandler Decl. ¶ 5.) Thus, they argue
that the order issued against them is void. (Motion at pg. 4.) Moreover, they
point out that verified responses and supplemental responses were served on
March 14, 2023 and April 18, 2023, which was before Keane filed his motion to
compel. (Motion at pg. 3; Chandler Decl. ¶ 5, Exhs. 3-4.) 
            In
opposition, Keane submits only the Declaration of Ken Carlson. Within his
declaration, Mr. Carlson attests that he uses MetroFax.com to serve documents
by facsimile and that he receives confirmation or notices of error relating to
each fax sent. (Carlson Decl. at pp. 2-3.) In connection with discovery motion
served on the Robles Defendants, Mr. Carlson attests that the fax was
successfully sent. (Id. at pg. 2.) Thus, he concludes that the claim of
lack of service is false. (Id. at pg. 3.)
            Under
the circumstances, the court finds that October 3, 2023 order was issued in
error, and as a result, sua sponte reconsideration is warranted.  (See Le Francois v. Goel (2005) 35
Cal.4th 1094, 1106-1107 [the court may on its own motion reconsider a prior
order in order to correct an error].)  In
reaching this conclusion, the court does not find that it was due to mistake on
Keane’s end. Keane has submitted proof to show that, by all accounts, the
motion to compel had been properly served on the Robles Defendants, but the
court has no reason to doubt the representation made by Counsel Chandler that
he had not ultimately received it. 
Rather, the
October 3, 2023 order was improperly issued because the court had relied on the
erroneous belief that the Robles Defendants failed to respond to Keane’s Form
Interrogatories (Set One). (See October 3, 2022 Order at pg. 3.) Through the present
motion, the Robles Defendants have shown that Keane’s representation that no
responses had been served were false. (Chandler Decl. ¶ 5, Exh. 3-4.) Notably,
Keane has failed to address this in his opposition. While the Robles
Defendants’ verified responses were untimely served and still included
objections, Keane was precluded from filing a motion to compel pursuant to Code
of Civil Procedure § 2030.290. Instead, if Keane reasoned that the objections
were meritless or that the responses were incomplete, Keane was required to
file a motion to compel further pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 2030.300.
Therefore, the court erred in granting Keane’s motion to compel on October 3,
2023, and consequently, sua sponte reconsideration is warranted in order
to correct this error. 
Based on the
foregoing, the court on its own motion reconsiders its October 3, 2023 order.
Consequently, the October 3, 2023 order is vacated, and Keane’s motion to
compel filed on May 15, 2023 is denied as moot. 
 
It is so
ordered.
