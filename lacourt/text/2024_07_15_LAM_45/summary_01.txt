And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendants' demurrer to Relator's first amended complaint. The defendants' demurrer is sustained without leave to amend. The court finds that Relator does not have standing to bring the action because Relator did not comply with the jurisdictional requirement of Insurance Code § 1871.7(h)(2). The court also finds that the documents used by Relator were publicly disclosed, and therefore Relator's suit is barred. The judge notes that the documents in question were filed in a separate case (Case No. LC106864) and were publicly available, making them publicly disclosed. The court denies Relator's request for leave to amend because there is no reasonable possibility of successful amendment.
