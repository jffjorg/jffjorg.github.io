And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding Defendant Eduardo Merancio Solano's motion to transfer the venue of the case from Los Angeles County to Riverside County. The Judge has denied the motion, finding that the action is properly venued in Los Angeles County due to the residence of party defendant Alfred Howard Giles, who is a Los Angeles County resident. The Judge has also ordered the Defendant to file a responsive pleading within 20 days. The motion was denied because the Defendant failed to present any statute or legal authority to support the contention that the Court needs to review the validity of the claims alleged in order to determine proper venue.
