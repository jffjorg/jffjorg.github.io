Defendants’ counsel’s declaration in support of the motion to strike similarly
indicates, inter alia, that “I attempted to meet and confer with
Plaintiff prior to filing this motion by sending a letter dated February 26,
2024 to their counsel along the lines of the arguments contained in this
motion, and requesting that we meet and confer. I did not receive a reply.”
(Zohar Decl., ¶ 3.)
