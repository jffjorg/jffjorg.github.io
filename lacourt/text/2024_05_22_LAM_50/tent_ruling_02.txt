AND RELATED CROSS-ACTIONS


 



 
Background
Plaintiff
Lancaster Eagle, LLC (“Lancaster Eagle”) filed this action on August 1, 2023
against Defendant Bartz-Altadonna Community Health Center (“Bartz-Altadonna”). 
Lancaster
Eagle filed the operative First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) on December 27, 2023
against Defendants Bartz-Altadonna, Caster Modelo, LLC (“Caster Modelo”), Payam
Bahari, Haim Bahari, and Pacific Premier Bank. The FAC alleges causes of action
for (1) breach of written contract, (2) breach of written contract, (3)
breach of written contract, and (4) specific performance. 
On
March 13, 2024, Commerce
Escrow Company, a division of Pacific Premier Bank filed a “Cross-Complaint in
Interpleader” against Lancaster Eagle and Caster Modelo.  
On March 15, 2024, Bartz-Altadonna
filed a Cross-Complaint against Lancaster Eagle, alleging causes of action for
(1) breach of contract and (2) specific performance. 
Caster
Modelo, Payam Bahari, and Haim Bahari (collectively, the “Bahari
Defendants”) now demur to the FAC and move to strike portions of the FAC. Lancaster Eagle
opposes both. 
Discussion 
As an initial matter,
the Court notes that the Bahari Defendants’ counsel indicates in his
declaration in support of the demurrer that “I attempted to meet and confer
with counsel for Plaintiff by drafting and sending on February 26, 2024, a
detailed letter mirroring the arguments made in this motion. I requested that
counsel reply to me no later than March 4, but I never received any response to
my letter. Attached as Exhibit 1 is a true and correct copy of the February 26,
2024 [sic].” (Zohar Decl., ¶ 3.)[1]  
The Court notes that the Bahari Defendants’ counsel’s declarations do
not demonstrate that the parties met and conferred in
person, by telephone, or by video conference, or that the Bahari
Defendants’ counsel attempted to
do so. Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 430.41, subdivision (a), “[b]efore filing
a demurrer pursuant to this chapter, the demurring party shall meet and
confer in person, by telephone, or by video conference with the
party who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the purpose of
determining whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve the
objections to be raised in the demurrer.” (Emphasis added.) 
In addition, “[b]efore filing a motion to strike pursuant to this chapter, the
moving party shall meet and confer in person, by telephone, or by
video conference with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to
the motion to strike for the purpose of determining if an agreement can be
reached that resolves the objections to be raised in the motion to strike.”
(Code Civ. Proc., §
435.5, subd. (a), emphasis added.) Such
meeting and conferring must be done in good faith with an effort to try to
resolve the issues subject to the demurrer and motion to strike. 
In light of the foregoing,
the hearing on the Bahari Defendants’
demurrer and motion to strike is continued to _______________, 2024 at 2
p.m. in Dept. 50.  
The
Bahari Defendants are¿ordered to meet¿and confer¿with Lancaster
Eagle within 10 days of the date of this order.¿If the parties are unable to
resolve the pleading issues¿or if the parties are otherwise unable to meet and
confer in good faith, the Bahari Defendants are to¿thereafter¿file and
serve¿a declaration setting forth the efforts to meet and confer in compliance
with¿Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41, subdivision
(a)(3) and Code
of Civil Procedure section 435.5, subdivision (a)(3) within 15 days of this order.¿ 
The Bahari Defendants are ordered to give notice of this order.
