And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has considered the plaintiff's motion for leave to file a first amended and supplemental complaint. The plaintiff, Suzanne Carney, filed a complaint in November 2022 alleging three causes of action against the City of Los Angeles after the city allegedly caused damage to her property while attempting to repair a sewage line. The motion is unopposed.

The Court has granted the motion, allowing the plaintiff to file the amended complaint. The plaintiff seeks to add a contract claim, which was not previously available due to further discovery. The Court notes that the motion was filed after the answer, but the City has not shown prejudice, and the Court sees none.

The Court's decision is based on the legal standard set forth in California Civil Procedure Code Section 472(a), which allows a party to amend its pleading once without leave of the court at any time before the answer, demurrer, or motion to strike is filed. The Court also cites Higgins v. Del Faro (1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 558, which holds that delay alone is not grounds for denial of a motion to amend, and prejudice must be shown.

The Court orders the moving party to give notice of this ruling. Parties who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court as directed by the instructions provided on the court website.
