SUPERIOR
COURT OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA 
FOR
THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES - CENTRAL DISTRICT
 



MIRIAM MALDONADO,
  
                        Plaintiff,
            vs.
 
SANG IL PARK, et al.,
                                                                             
  
                        Defendants.                               


 


     
  CASE NO.:  BC306683
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER RE: 
MOTION TO BE RELIEVED AS COUNSEL
 
Date: October 10, 2024
Time: 8:30 a.m.
Dept. 56
 
 



 
On September 18, 2024, James W. McDanel (“McDanel”),
counsel of record for Plaintiff, filed the instant Motion to be Relieved as
Counsel (the “Motion”), seeking to withdraw as counsel for Plaintiff.  The Motion is unopposed.
 
In connection with the Motion, McDanel declares that
there is “a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship with Miriam
Maldonado, which has hindered Counsel’s ability to provide effective legal
representation.”  (Declaration in Support
of Attorney’s Motion to be Relieved as Counsel.)
 
             The court has discretion on
whether to allow an attorney to withdraw, and a motion to withdraw will not be
granted where withdrawal would prejudice the client.  (Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21
Cal.App.4th 904, 915.)  Withdrawal is
generally permitted unless there is a compelling reason to continue the
representation.  (Heple v. Kluge
(1951) 104 Cal.App.2d 461, 462.)
 
The Court finds that the Motion sets forth an adequate
basis for withdrawal.  
 
The
Court, therefore, GRANTS the Motion. The Court will hold a conference with
Plaintiff’s counsel on October 10, 2024 at 8:30 a.m. in this department.
 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.            
 
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at
SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed by the instructions provided on the court
website at www.lacourt.org.  If the
department does not receive an email and there are no appearances at the
hearing, the motion will be placed off calendar.
 
Dated this 10th day of October 2024
