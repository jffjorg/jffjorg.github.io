Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is granting the defendants' motion to compel arbitration and stay the action pending completion of arbitration. The plaintiff purchased a vehicle from Carvana in 2022 and signed an arbitration agreement at the time of purchase. The arbitration agreement defines the parties to the agreement and covers disputes relating to the vehicle, including its condition, purchase, and any goods or services incidental to the contract. The plaintiff's claims, as alleged in the complaint, fall squarely under the arbitration agreement. The defendants have met the initial burden of showing that an arbitration agreement exists between the parties, and the plaintiff has failed to show why the arbitration agreement should not be enforced. The court finds that the present action is subject to arbitration pursuant to the arbitration agreement and sets a status conference for April 8, 2025, regarding the status of arbitration.
