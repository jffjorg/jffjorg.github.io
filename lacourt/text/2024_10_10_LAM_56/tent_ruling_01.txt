RESPONDING PARTY: Defendant
/ Judgment Debtor COREY LARGE (“Defendant”)
 
            The Court has considered the moving and
opposition papers.  
 
BACKGROUND
This
action arises out of an attorney/client relationship. Plaintiff’s complaint
alleged: (1) breach of written contract; and (2) common count – services
rendered.
 
            On November 28, 2023, the Court entered
judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant in the amount of $56,370.50.
            Plaintiff initially filed a Motion
to Compel Responses to Plaintiff’s Judgment Debtor Interrogatories to Defendant
Corey Large on January 29, 2024.  On
March 11, 2024, Defendant filed an opposition, mainly arguing that post-judgment
discovery must be served on the judgment debtor and not on his attorneys. 
 
            On September 17, 2024, Plaintiff
filed the present Amended Motion to Compel Responses to Plaintiff’s Judgment
Debtor Interrogatories to Defendant Corey Large (the “Motion”).  Defendant has not filed an opposition to the
Motion.
 
 
DISCUSSION
            Code of Civil
Procedure section 708.020 provides:¿¿ 
¿¿ 
“(a) The judgment
creditor may propound written interrogatories to the judgment debtor, in the
manner provided in Chapter 13 (commencing with Section 2030.010) of Title 4 of
Part 4, requesting information to aid in enforcement of the money judgment. The
judgment debtor shall answer the interrogatories in the manner and within the
time provided by Chapter 13 (commencing with Section 2030.010) of Title 4 of
Part 4.¿ 
¿ 
(c)
Interrogatories served pursuant to this section may be enforced, to the extent
practicable, in the same manner as interrogatories in a civil action.¿¿ 
 
 
A
party to whom interrogatories, demands for production, or requests for
admission have been propounded shall respond in writing under oath separately
to each interrogatory or demand by providing an answer or a statement of
compliance, or by providing an objection.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.210, 2031.210, &
2033.210.)  If an objection is made to an
interrogatory, demand for production, request for admission, or part thereof,
or an objection is based on a claim of privilege, the specific ground or
particular privilege invoked shall be clearly stated.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.240, 2031.240, &
2033.230.)  Responses should be served
within 30 days of service.  (Code Civ.
Proc., §§ 2030.260, 2031.260, & 2033.250.)  A motion to compel responses may be brought
where a responding party fails to timely respond to written discovery, and the
party who failed to serve timely responses waives any objections (Code Civ.
Proc., §§ 2030.290, 2031.300, & 2033.280.)¿¿ 
¿ 
Unsuccessfully
making or opposing a motion to compel responses, interrogatories, requests for
production of documents, or requests for admission can subject a party to
sanctions unless that party acted with substantial justification¿or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanctions¿unjust.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290,¿subd. (c),
2031.300,¿subd. (c), & 2033.280,¿subd. (c).)¿¿¿ 
¿ 
            In support of Plaintiff’s present Motion,
Plaintiff declares that on March 25, 2024, he had a registered process server
serve Plaintiff’s Judgment Debtor Interrogatories to Defendant Corey Large (Set
One) (the “Interrogatories”) on Defendant, to facilitate the collection of the
judgment against Defendant.  (Declaration
of S. Michael Kernan, ¶ 4, Exh. A.) 
Plaintiff also attached the Affidavit of Service executed by the process
server indicating that on March 25, 2024, the Interrogatories were served on
Defendant through personal service.  (Id.,
¶ 5, Exh. B.)  Plaintiff further declares
that as of August 20, 2024, there has been no response to the Interrogatories.  (Id., ¶ 7.)
 
            Plaintiff now moves to compel
Defendant to provide responses to the Interrogatories, without objections.  Plaintiff states that it seeks sanctions
against counsel for Defendant if the Motion is opposed, but if not opposed, sanctions
are not sought.
 
RULING
Accordingly,
the Motion is GRANTED.  Plaintiff is ORDERED to serve moving party
with complete, Code-compliant and verified responses to the Interrogatories,
without objections, within 20 days of this Order.  Since monetary sanctions are not sought in
view of Plaintiff’s non-opposition, no sanctions are imposed.
            
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.            
 
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org
as directed by the instructions provided on the court website at
www.lacourt.org.  If the department does
not receive an email and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion
will be placed off calendar.
 
Dated this 10th day of October 2024
