And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on Defendant Spina Organics, LLC's motion to compel Plaintiff Ellen Pittleman's appearance and production of documents at trial. The motion is granted to the extent that it seeks to compel Plaintiff's appearance and testimony at trial, as well as the production of documents concerning her financial condition. However, the judge denies Defendant's request for sanctions as Plaintiff has not failed to comply with the notice to appear and produce documents at trial. The judge's decision is based on the fact that a party's right to compel another party's attendance and production of documents at trial is independent of their discovery obligations.
