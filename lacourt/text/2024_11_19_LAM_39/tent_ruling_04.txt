[1]Given
the basis of the Court’s ruling, the Court does not reach issues the parties
addressed after completing the briefing on this motion concerning whether there
could have been a meeting of the minds regarding the arbitration agreement because
Plaintiff alleges the entity which was designated in the agreement to conduct any
arbitration had not done so since 1994.
