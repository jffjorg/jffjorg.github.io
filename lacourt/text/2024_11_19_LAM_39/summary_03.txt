And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendants' motion to compel arbitration with the plaintiff. The defendants had presented an arbitration agreement purportedly between the plaintiff and Rolling Hills Covenant Church, but had not met their burden to prove the existence of a valid arbitration agreement. The plaintiff had consistently argued that the signature on the arbitration agreement was not his authentic signature because he did not see nor did he sign the agreement. The judge found that the defendants' evidence, including the declarations of Sam Tabari and Robert H. Cubillos, did not establish that the plaintiff had signed the agreement. The judge also disregarded the defendants' unauthorized sur-reply brief and ordered the plaintiff to provide notice of the order and to file proof of service of same.
