And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to compel further responses to the requests for production of documents (RPD) filed by the plaintiff. The plaintiff's supplemental response to the RPD is incomplete, as it fails to state why the plaintiff cannot locate responsive documents and does not identify any party who may have the documents. The defendant believes that responsive documents exist and the plaintiff can access them. The judge has ordered the plaintiff to serve further responses within 20 days of receiving notice of the order. The defendant is also ordered to give notice of the order and file proof of service.
