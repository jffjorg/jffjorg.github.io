Here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for reconsideration of the Court's November 1, 2021 order compelling arbitration. The Plaintiffs, Guadalupe Salinas Jr. and Gabby Salinas, moved to reconsider the order, arguing that the Court's decision was erroneous. However, the Judge has denied the motion, finding that it is untimely and that the Plaintiffs have not demonstrated that they have attempted to proceed with arbitration. The Judge also notes that both parties have disobeyed the Court's order compelling arbitration. The Judge relies on Civil Procedure Code section 1008, which sets forth the rules for motions for reconsideration, and California Rule of Court 3.1308(a)(1), which governs the procedure for filing motions. The Judge also references a published opinion, Felisilda, which is cited as supporting the Court's decision.
