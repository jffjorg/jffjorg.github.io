```

And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling is that the defendant, Law Offices of Mason Rashtian, did not meet its burden on the first prong of the anti-SLAPP analysis, to show that the plaintiff's claims arise from activity protected under the anti-SLAPP statute. Therefore, the defendant is not the prevailing defendant and is not entitled to recover attorney's fees. The plaintiff, Francisco Salas, seeks a declaration that the defendant's attorney lien claim is invalid, and the defendant cross-complained against the plaintiff alleging that the plaintiff was uncooperative during representation and failed to disclose important facts. The court notes that the defendant's attorney lien claim was voluntarily withdrawn and that the plaintiff obtained a higher settlement amount than the defendant's last offer. The court also notes that the cross-complaint was dismissed without prejudice.
