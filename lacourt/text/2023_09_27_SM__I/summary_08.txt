And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a demurrer filed by GM (General Motors) in a Song-Beverly case alleging fraudulent concealment. GM argues that there was no duty to disclose the problem with the car and that fraud can only occur in a transactional relationship. The judge notes that the main thrust of GM's motion is that it had no duty to disclose anything, rather than what it failed to disclose. The judge also references Dhital v. Nissan of North America, Inc. (2022), which suggests that the car dealer acted as the manufacturer's agent and had a duty to disclose known defects. The judge is inclined to wait for the Supreme Court's decision in Dhital and Rattagan v. Uber Technologies, which addresses the economic loss rule and the agency argument. The judge will set a status conference for December 2023 to assess the status of these cases.
