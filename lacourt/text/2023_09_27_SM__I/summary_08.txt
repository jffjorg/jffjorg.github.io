And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a demurrer filed by GM (General Motors) in a Song-Beverly case alleging fraudulent concealment. GM argues that there was no duty to disclose the problem with the car and that fraud can only occur in a transactional relationship. The judge notes that the main thrust of GM's motion is that it had no duty to disclose anything, rather than what it failed to disclose. The judge also references Dhital v. Nissan of North America, Inc. (2022), which suggests that the car dealer acted as the manufacturer's agent and had a duty to disclose known defects. The judge is inclined to wait for the Supreme Court's decision in Dhital and Rattagan v. Uber Technologies, which addresses the economic loss rule and the agency argument. The judge will set a status conference for December 2023 to assess the status of these cases.

## English Summary:

This tentative ruling addresses a lawsuit filed under California's Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act. The plaintiff claims General Motors (GM) fraudulently concealed a problem with a car they purchased. 

GM argues they had no duty to disclose the problem because there was no direct contractual relationship between them and the plaintiff. They cite the case *Bigler-Engler v. Breg, Inc.* to support this argument.

The plaintiff counters by citing *Dhital v. Nissan of North America, Inc.*, which suggests that a car dealership acting as the manufacturer's agent has a duty to disclose known defects. 

The judge is awaiting the Supreme Court's decision in *Rattagan v. Uber Technologies* and *Dhital v. Nissan of North America, Inc.* to determine whether GM had a duty to disclose the car problem and whether the economic loss rule applies in this situation. A status conference is scheduled for December 2023 to assess the status of those cases.

```

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English:

The judge is considering a demurrer filed by GM, the defendant, arguing that there can be no fraudulent concealment because there was no duty to speak. GM claims that there can be no fraud in the misrepresentation sense because no false statement was uttered by GM to the plaintiff, and that the duty to disclose only arises in the context of a transactional relationship. The plaintiff argues that fraud is well-pled and contains the requisite specificity, but the judge is inclined to wait for the Supreme Court's decision on Dhital v. Nissan of North America, Inc. and Rattagan v. Uber Technologies, which involve similar issues. The judge will set a status conference in December 2023 to assess the status of these cases.
