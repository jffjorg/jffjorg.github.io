And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion to quash a subpoena issued by the plaintiff to depose the defendant's counsel, Lohan's counsel. The defendant did not serve an opposition, but the judge advanced the hearing to today and gave the defendant until Tuesday to file an opposition. The judge is inclined to grant the motion because the plaintiff has not made the necessary showing to depose the defense counsel. The judge notes that depositions of opposing counsel are rarely allowed, and an extraordinary showing must be made. The plaintiff's objections to the subpoena are based on the fact that the subpoena requires counsel to produce documents at the hearing and be deposed at that time. The judge believes that the documents sought could be obtained from other sources, and that the defendant's counsel did not offer to produce the documents at plaintiff's expense at normal copying charges. The judge also notes that the plaintiff did not request the documents from the deposition officer, who has a legal obligation to provide them.

**English Summary:**

The judge is leaning towards granting the motion to quash a subpoena issued to Lohan's counsel.  The judge finds that depositions of opposing counsel are generally disfavored and that the plaintiff has not made a strong enough case for why this deposition is necessary. 

The judge notes that the documents requested by the plaintiff could likely be obtained from other sources, and questions why an actual deposition is required instead of simply producing the documents. The judge also suggests that the defendant could have offered to produce the documents at the plaintiff's expense, which would have eliminated this issue.

```

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court is considering a motion to quash a subpoena that requires Lohan's counsel to produce documents and be deposed on September 28, 2023. The defendant, Virk, did not appear at the ex parte hearing on September 21, 2023, and did not file an opposition to the motion. The court notes that the subpoena requires counsel to produce documents at the hearing and be deposed, which is a rare and extraordinary request. The court is inclined to grant the motion, citing the lack of extraordinary circumstances that would justify the request. The court also questions why the plaintiff cannot obtain the documents from other sources or request them from the deposition officer. The court suggests that the defendant could have offered to produce the documents at the plaintiff's expense, which would have mooted the issue. Overall, the court finds that the plaintiff has not made the necessary showing to depose defense counsel.

Here is an English-text summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:
The Judge is inclined to grant the defendant's motion to quash a subpoena issued by the plaintiff. The subpoena seeks to depose Lohan's counsel and produce documents, but the Judge finds that the plaintiff has not made the necessary showing to justify this action. The Judge notes that depositions of opposing counsel are rarely allowed and that an extraordinary showing must be made, which was not done in this case. The Judge also questions why the plaintiff insists on a deposition rather than mere production of documents, and why the defendant's counsel did not offer to produce the documents at the plaintiff's expense. Ultimately, the Judge finds that the plaintiff has not demonstrated a sufficient reason to depose defense counsel, and therefore grants the motion to quash the subpoena.
