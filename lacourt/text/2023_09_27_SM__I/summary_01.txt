And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion to quash a subpoena issued by the plaintiff to depose the defendant's counsel, Lohan's counsel. The defendant did not serve an opposition, but the judge advanced the hearing to today and gave the defendant until Tuesday to file an opposition. The judge is inclined to grant the motion because the plaintiff has not made the necessary showing to depose the defense counsel. The judge notes that depositions of opposing counsel are rarely allowed, and an extraordinary showing must be made. The plaintiff's objections to the subpoena are based on the fact that the subpoena requires counsel to produce documents at the hearing and be deposed at that time. The judge believes that the documents sought could be obtained from other sources, and that the defendant's counsel did not offer to produce the documents at plaintiff's expense at normal copying charges. The judge also notes that the plaintiff did not request the documents from the deposition officer, who has a legal obligation to provide them.
