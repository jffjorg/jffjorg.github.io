The judge has tentatively ruled that the motion to set aside the default is granted. The plaintiff sued the defendant for allegedly selling a car to the defendant, but never transferring ownership. The defendant claims he was unaware of the lawsuit until he received an order on April 25, 2023, and only learned of the lawsuit after hiring a lawyer and filing a motion to vacate the default. The judge found that the service of the complaint and summons was not proper, as the process server did not follow the necessary procedures. The judge granted the motion, allowing the defendant to file a standalone answer by September 29, 2023. The judge also scheduled a Case Management Conference for about 45 days from the hearing date.

## English Text Summary

The judge is granting the defendant's motion to set aside the default judgment entered against them in this car sale dispute. 

The judge finds that the service of the lawsuit on "Manvel Doe" at defendant's workplace was likely improper because there is no evidence that Manvel was an employee or authorized to accept service. While a presumption of proper service exists when a registered process server files a proof of service, the defendant's declaration raises enough doubt to overcome that presumption. 

Although the judge notes that the defendant should have been more diligent in reviewing legal documents received, the judge ultimately prioritizes resolving the case on its merits rather than upholding a potentially flawed default judgment. The defendant is given until September 29th to file an answer to the complaint. A case management conference will be scheduled in about 45 days.

```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to set aside the default. The plaintiff sued the defendant for failing to transfer ownership of a car after selling it to him, and the car was later involved in an accident and had parking tickets. The defendant claims that the process server did not have the authority to serve him, and that he did not know he was being sued until he received an order from the court in April 2023. The judge agrees that the service of the complaint and summons was not proper, and that the defendant's lack of knowledge of the lawsuit is a concern. However, the judge notes that the defendant filed the motion to set aside default in a timely manner and that there is a strong public policy favoring resolution on the merits. As a result, the judge has granted the motion and ordered the defendant to file a standalone answer by September 29, 2023. The court will also set a case management conference for about 45 days from today.

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the motion to set aside the default. The Judge agrees that the service of the complaint and summons does not appear proper, and once contrary evidence is introduced, the presumption of good service goes away completely. Defendant is to file a standalone answer no later than September 29, 2023 at 4:00 pm. The Judge also mentions that they are concerned about the fact that defendant got "numerous legal documents" but did not think to look to see whether he was getting them for a reason, but the failure of service is enough, especially given the strong public policy favoring resolution on the merits. The Judge will set a Case Management Conference for about 45 days from today.
