And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the motion to set aside the default is granted. The plaintiff sued the defendant for allegedly selling a car to the defendant, but never transferring ownership. The defendant claims he was unaware of the lawsuit until he received an order on April 25, 2023, and only learned of the lawsuit after hiring a lawyer and filing a motion to vacate the default. The judge found that the service of the complaint and summons was not proper, as the process server did not follow the necessary procedures. The judge granted the motion, allowing the defendant to file a standalone answer by September 29, 2023. The judge also scheduled a Case Management Conference for about 45 days from the hearing date.
