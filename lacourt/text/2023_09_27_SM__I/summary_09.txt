And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the ex parte application to file under seal. The Court does not advance motions that have not been brought, and the defendant has not provided specific justification for why certain parts of the filings invade their privacy rights or HIPAA rights. The Court reviewed the pleadings in the case and found nothing that rises to the level of a justification for a filing under seal. The Judge warns the defendant that future attempts to file under seal will be denied with prejudice if not properly supported. The Court does not intend to hear argument on this matter today.
