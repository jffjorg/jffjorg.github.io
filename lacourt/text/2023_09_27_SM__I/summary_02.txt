The judge encourages the defendant to discuss with the plaintiff and not waste everyone's time if they know there is no defense. The judge does not intend to hear argument on this matter today and does not express an opinion on the merits of the motion.

While not commenting on the merits of the motion, the Judge encouraged the Defendant to discuss the matter with the Plaintiff. The Judge expressed concern about wasting time and resources by holding a trial if the Defendant has no defense.

The judge encourages the parties to meet and confer to avoid wasting everyone's time and suggests that the defendant should have a meaningful discussion with the plaintiff. The judge is not expressing an opinion on the merits of the motion, but rather is asking the parties to consider whether the motion is really a good one and whether it would be better to settle rather than go to trial.

```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the ex parte application and ruled that the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment was not timely filed. As a result, the motion would have been heard less than 30 days before the trial date, which is scheduled for November 6, 2023. The judge sees no good cause to continue the trial and encourages the defendant to have a meaningful discussion with the plaintiff to determine if there is a valid defense. If the defense is weak, the judge suggests that it may be wasteful to proceed with a trial, which would impose a burden on the court, jurors, and the community. However, if the defense believes it has a meritorious case, it should defend the action unless a settlement can be reached. The judge emphasizes that this ruling is not intended to influence the outcome of the case and expresses no opinion on the merits of the motion.
