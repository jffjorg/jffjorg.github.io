Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's ex parte application, which was an attempt to have a motion for summary judgment heard without notice to the defendant. The judge found that the motion was not timely, as it would have been heard less than 30 days before the trial date if adequate notice had been given. The judge encourages the defendant to discuss with the plaintiff and not waste everyone's time if they know there is no defense. The judge does not intend to hear argument on this matter today and does not express an opinion on the merits of the motion.
