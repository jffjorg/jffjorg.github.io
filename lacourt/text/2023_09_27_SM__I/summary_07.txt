And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the unopposed motion to compel, requiring the plaintiff to serve full and complete verified responses to certain interrogatories and requests for production (RFPs) within 30 days. The Judge notes that the plaintiff's failure to do so was not proper and that the plaintiff's decision not to participate in a scheduled Information Discovery Conference (IDC) suggests bad faith. Although sanctions were not sought, the Judge implies that they would have been awarded had they been sought. The Judge appreciates the defendant's decision not to seek sanctions, which is viewed as an olive branch, and hopes it will lead to better conduct by the plaintiff in the future.
