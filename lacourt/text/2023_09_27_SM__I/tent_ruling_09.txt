 Case Number:  23SMCV02658    Hearing Date:   September 27, 2023    Dept:  I The ex parte application is DENIED.  The court does not advance motions that have
not been brought.  Worse, defendant has
not identified what parts defendant believe invade her privacy rights or HIPPA
rights.  Had there been a motion on file,
the court could have looked at the parts of the filings that defendant sought
to redact to make a determination.  But
that is not possible so the court has no idea if there is truly any urgency to
the request.  Out of deference to
defendant, though, the court looked at the pleadings thus far in the case and
found nothing that rose to the level of a justification for a filing under
seal.  The court might have missed it,
and this is not meant to be an order barring defendant from brining a new
motion if specifics are identified.  But
defendant should be prepared to discuss the legal standards for filing under
seal and explain why this fits within those boundaries and also how the
proposed order would be narrowly tailored rather than just make unsupported
conclusory statements.  The court warns
defendant that if the motion is brought again, it will be the third attempt.  If that fails, the motion will be denied with
prejudice. 
The court does not intend to hear argument on this matter
today.
