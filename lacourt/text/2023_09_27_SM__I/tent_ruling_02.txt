 Case Number:  21SMCV00641    Hearing Date:   September 27, 2023    Dept:  I The ex parte application is DENIED.  Plaintiff has a right to have a timely motion
for summary judgment heard.  Timely means
that it is filed such that, if adequate notice is given, it will be heard more
than 30 days before the trial. 
Plaintiff’s motion was not timely. 
Even had the motion been calendared on statutory notice, it would have
been heard on November 3, 2023—less than 30 days before the November 6, 2023
trial date.  (As it is, the matter was
calendared for November 9, 2023, four court days after the statutory minimum.)  Thus, the problem is not the court’s busy
docket, but rather plaintiff’s failure to file a timely motion.  The court sees no good cause to continue the
trial.  The court does not intend to hear
argument on this matter today.
That said, the court would encourage the defendant to have a
meaningful discussion with plaintiff.  If
the motion is really a good one but for timing, the court would not appreciate
empaneling a jury only to issue an order for a directed verdict at the close of
the evidence because there is no defense at all.  Not only would that expose defendant and
counsel to a malicious prosecution lawsuit, it would be a poor choice in
general given this court’s very busy docket and the imposition that a trial
places on jurors and the community.  The
court is not suggesting that the motion would be well taken—the court expresses
no opinion on the merits and this order is not meant to be a hint.  It is just to ask the parties to meet and
confer and not waste everyone’s time if even the defense knows that there is no
defense.  On the other hand, if the
defense believes that there is a meritorious defense, then, of course, it ought
to defend the action unless the parties can settle.
