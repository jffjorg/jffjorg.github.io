 Case Number:  23SMCV00126    Hearing Date:   September 27, 2023    Dept:  I The unopposed motions to compel are GRANTED.  Within 30 days, plaintiff will serve full and
complete verified responses without objection as to form interrogatories 2.2,
4.1, series 6, 11.1, 11.2, and 17.1 as well as special interrogatories 1, 3,
and 5 as well as RFP 1-4, and 9-11.  The
responsive documents will be produced at the same time.    Sanctions were not sought.  
The motion is granted in part because it is unopposed and in
part because the responses at issue were not proper.  The court also notes that although an IDC was
scheduled and ordered, plaintiff elected not to participate.  The court can only conclude that plaintiff is
acting in bad faith.  Had sanctions been
sought, they would have been awarded. 
Defendant’s election not to seek them should be viewed as an olive
branch.  The court appreciates
defendant’s restraint in that regard, and hopefully it will result in better
conduct by plaintiff.
