```

And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's motion to set aside the dismissal of their complaint without prejudice. The plaintiff's counsel inadvertently gave his secretary the wrong date, resulting in the court's dismissal of the complaint. The court finds that the plaintiff's counsel's straightforward admission of fault is sufficient to set aside the dismissal. The court reinstates the action and orders the plaintiff to submit a new default package, curing all prior defects, within five court days before the hearing date.
