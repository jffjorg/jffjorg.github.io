HEARING: Motion to Compel Further
Responses to Herc’s First Set of Special Interrogatories
 
            The Court considered the moving
papers. RULING The Court grants the Motion to Compel special Interrogatories Nos. 12, 13, 29, and 30. Sanctions in the amount of $1,110 are imposed.  Discovery and sanctions  are due by November 12, 2024.
 
BACKGROUND
 
            On October
6, 2022, Plaintiffs Lisa Popovich and John Porter filed the complaint against
Defendants City of Los Angeles, City of Los Angeles Department of
Transportation, MV Transportation INC. “MV,” and HERC rentals “HERC,” alleging
causes of action for negligence and loss of consortium arising from a bus
crash.
 
            On August 10, 2023, Herc
served its first set of special interrogatories on MV. 
 
On October 24, 2024, MV served deficient responses.
 
            On December 5, 2024,
during a telephonic meet and confer, MV agreed to provide further responses to
all of the interrogatories raised in a meet and confer letter sent on November
22, 2023.
 
            Between December and
March 2024, Herc inquired multiple times about the promised further responses.
 
            The further responses
have yet to be served.
 
            On April 2, 2024, Herc
filed the instant motion
            
            On August 22, 2024, the
Court continued the motion to October 11, 2024.
 
            No opposition has been
filed.
 
            LEGAL
STANDARD
 
            The propounding party
may file motions to compel further responses to requests for production if it
believes the responses received are (1) evasive, (2) incomplete, or (3) if the
objections raised are meritless or overly general. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300,
subd. (a).) In response to a motion to compel further responses, the respondent
bears the burden of justifying any objections. (Fairmont Ins. Co. v.
Superior Court (2000) 22 Cal.4th 245, 255.)
 
DISCUSSION 
 
            Plaintiff
requests that the Court compel Defendant to further respond to Special
Interrogatories 12,13, 29, and 30.
 

Meet and Confer

 
The Court finds
that Herc satisfied the meet and confer requirements as evidenced by Herc’s
counsel’s declaration, wherein counsel states that counsel reached out to MV
multiple times regarding the Special Interrogatories, Set
One, and received no response.
(Davis decl. ¶ 9-15.)
 

Special
     Interrogatories

 
Herc argues that it
is entitled to obtain discovery from MV Transportation under California Code of
Civil Procedure Section 2017.010, which permits parties to seek non-privileged
information relevant to the subject matter of a case, especially if it could
reasonably assist in preparing for trial, evaluating a case, or facilitating
settlement. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2017.010.)
 
This case stems
from a June 27, 2022, incident involving a LADOT bus operated by MV employee
Derry Fayrel Green, Jr., which collided with a stationary Herc semi-truck. The
collision resulted in multiple injuries, including to the plaintiff, Lisa
Popovich. Herc, after being sued, filed a cross-complaint against MV for
indemnity and negligence and sought discovery to support its claims.
 
Herc's Special
Interrogatories seek pertinent information, including details about MV's
relationship with the City of Los Angeles, the qualifications and training of
MV's bus drivers, and information specific to the actions of bus driver Green
leading up to the collision. Special Interrogatory Nos. 12 and 13 asked MV to
state why it believes its bus driver did not take defensive measures to
avoid and did not attempt to slow down or stop prior to colliding with the
Herc Truck. Special Interrogatory Nos. 29 and 30 asked MV to identify all
communications between MV and the LA Times and 2310 Imperial LLC, entities that
owned and/or operated the property adjacent to where the subject incident
occurred.
 
Herc contends that
these discovery requests are relevant and narrowly tailored to its claims,
particularly to address questions about whether the bus driver fell asleep and
if the Herc truck was directed to park at the accident site. Despite agreeing
to provide further responses during the meet and confer process, MV continued
to deliver incomplete and evasive answers. Herc asks the court to order MV to
promptly provide full and complete responses to its Special Interrogatories.
 
MV objected to
Special interrogatories Nos. 12, 13, 29, and 30, arguing that MV is not a party
and that the interrogatories were premature. However, in
response to a motion to compel further responses, the respondent bears the
burden of justifying any objections. (Fairmont, 22 Cal.4th 245,
255.) Here, MV has provided no opposition to this motion justifying their
objections.
 
Therefore, the Court grants the Motion to
Compel Special Interrogatories Nos. 12,
13, 29, and 30. 
 
Sanctions
 
Failing to respond to an authorized
method of discovery is a sanctionable misuse of the discovery process. (Code
Civ. Proc. § 2023.030 subd. (a), 2023.010 subd. (d).) If a motion to compel a
party to respond to discovery is successful, the court must impose a
monetary sanction against that party unless the sanction would be unjust. (Code
Civ. Proc § 2030.290 subd. (c), 2023.030 subd. (a), 2023.010 subd. (d); Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 390, 404.) The monetary sanction includes the moving party’s
reasonable expenses, such as attorney’s fees and costs. (Code Civ. Proc §
2023.030 subd. (a).)
 
Herc argues that
MV's failure to provide substantive responses to discovery requests for over
seven months constitutes a misuse of the discovery process. Despite numerous
attempts by Herc, through calls and emails, to resolve the matter, MV's counsel
failed to deliver proper responses and eventually suggested that Herc file a
motion to compel. Herc’s Counsel states that Herc incurred $1560 in connection
with this motion, broken down as follows: 3 hours preparing the motion at $300
an hour, the motion fee of $60, and 2 hours reviewing the opposition, writing
the reply, and appearing at the motion at $300 an hour. MV has not opposed the
motion, and therefore, the Court lowers the amount of time reviewing the
motion, writing the reply and appearing at the hearing to half an hour.
 
Therefore, the
Court imposes sanctions of $1,110.

RULING
 
The Court grants
the Motion to Compel Further Responses to Requests for Production. Sanctions are
imposed in the amount of $1110. Discovery and sanctions are due by November 12,
2024. 
 
BACKGROUND
 
            On
October 6, 2022, Plaintiffs Lisa Popovich and John Porter filed the complaint
against Defendants City of Los Angeles, City of Los Angeles Department of
Transportation, MV Transportation INC. “MV,” and HERC rentals “HERC,” alleging

            On August 22, 2024, the
Court continued the motion to October 11, 2024.
 
            No opposition has been
filed.
 
            LEGAL
STANDARD
 
            The propounding party
may file motions to compel further responses to requests for production if it
believes the responses received are (1) evasive, (2) incomplete, or (3) if the
objections raised are meritless or overly general. (Code of Civil Procedure
Section 2031.310.) In response to a motion to compel further responses, the
respondent bears the burden of justifying any objections. (Fairmont Ins. Co.
v. Superior Court (2000) 22 Cal.4th 245, 255.)
 
DISCUSSION 
 
A.    Meet and Confer
 
The Court finds
that Herc satisfied the meet and confer requirements as evidenced by Herc’s
counsel’s declaration, wherein counsel states that counsel reached out to MV
multiple times regarding the requests for production. (Davis decl. ¶ 9-15.)
 
B.    Request for Production
 
Herc requests
further responses to Request for Production Nos. 1-2, 7-29, 33-43, 48-49, and
59-64.
 
RPDs 1-2: Documents regarding
any relationship between MV and government entities
RPDs 7-11: Documents
regarding contracts or agreements relating to the subject bus
RPDs 12: Documents regarding
the provision of services for the subject bus
RPDs 13-27, 40, 59-64: Documents regarding the driver of the subject bus.
RPDs 28-29: Documents
regarding MV’s policies following driver incidents
RPDs 33-39, 41-43: Documents regarding the incident
RPDs 48-49: Documents regarding
the maintenance and repair of the subject bus
 
 
This case stems
from a June 27, 2022, incident involving a LADOT bus operated by MV employee
Derry Fayrel Green, Jr., which collided with a stationary Herc semi-truck. The
collision resulted in multiple injuries, including to the plaintiff, Lisa
Popovich. Herc, after being sued, filed a cross-complaint against MV for
indemnity and negligence and sought discovery to support its claims.
 
Herc argues that
under California Code of Civil Procedure Section 2017.010, discovery is
permissible for any non-privileged information relevant to the subject matter
of a case, especially if it could lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.
Herc sought documents through Requests for Production, asking for information
about MV's relationship with the City of Los Angeles, MV's public transit
system involvement, the qualifications and training of MV bus drivers, and
details about the driver involved in the incident, Derry Fayrel Green, Jr.
These documents are critical for Herc’s trial preparation.
 
Herc contends that
MV’s responses to many requests (Nos. 1-2, 7-28, 33-34, 36, 38-43, 48-49, and
59-64) were unclear, as MV stated they had produced some documents but objected
to others, arguing they were not relevant to admissible evidence. This left Herc
unsure whether all relevant documents had been provided. Herc requested amended
responses to clarify whether any documents were withheld.
 
Herc is also
concerned with MV's response to certain RPDs, including No. 12, 29, 25, and 37,
which MV objected to but agreed to provide further responses to during the meet
and confer process.
 
Despite MV agreeing
to provide additional responses, Herc argues that MV has repeatedly failed to
provide complete answers, delaying the process. Herc urges the Court to order
MV to supply full and substantive responses promptly, as the information is
crucial for trial preparation.
 
            MV has not provided an opposition to the instant motion.
 
The Court finds
that Herc’s Requests for Production are relevant to the subject matter of the
instant case as all requests revolve around the incident, and Herc has shown
good cause for the production of documents. (Code of Civil Procedure Section
2031.310 subd. (a).) Furthermore, MV has not provided any justification for
their objections as MV has not filed an opposition. (Fairmont
Ins. Co., 22 Cal.4th 245, 255.)
 
Therefore, the
Court grants the Motion to Compel Further Responses to Requests for
Production.
 
Sanctions
 
Failing to respond to an authorized
method of discovery is a sanctionable misuse of the discovery process. (Code
Civ. Proc. § 2023.030 subd. (a), 2023.010 subd. (d).) If a motion to compel a
party to respond to discovery is successful, the court must impose a
monetary sanction against that party unless the sanction would be unjust. (Code
Civ. Proc § 2030.290 subd. (c), 2023.030 subd. (a), 2023.010 subd. (d); Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 390, 404.) The monetary sanction includes the moving party’s
reasonable expenses, such as attorney’s fees and costs. (Code Civ. Proc §
2023.030 subd. (a).)
 
Herc argues that
MV's failure to provide substantive responses to discovery requests for over
seven months constitutes a misuse of the discovery process. Despite numerous
attempts by Herc, through calls and emails, to resolve the matter, MV's counsel
failed to deliver proper responses and eventually suggested that Herc file a
motion to compel. Herc’s Counsel states that Herc incurred $2310 in connection
with this motion, broken down as follows: 5.5 hours preparing the motion at
300$ an hour, the motion fee of 60$, and 2 hours reviewing the opposition,
writing the reply, and appearing at the motion at 300$ an hour. MV has not
opposed the motion, and therefore, the Court lowers the amount of time
reviewing the motion, writing the reply and appearing at the hearing to half an
hour. Furthermore, given the similarities between the two motions to be heard
on October 11, 2024, the Court lowers the amount of time spent on this motion
to 3 hours.
 
Therefore, the
Court imposes sanctions of $1,110.
