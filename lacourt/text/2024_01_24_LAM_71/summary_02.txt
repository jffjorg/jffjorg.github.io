And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling denies the motion of Plaintiff Jeffery Scott David's counsel, Ogochukwu Victor Onwaeze, to be relieved from representation without prejudice. The motion was filed on September 11, 2023, after David filed a notice of settlement on March 27, 2023. The court requires that a motion to be relieved as counsel must be accompanied by a proposed order, which was not provided in this case. The court has discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw, but the motion must not cause prejudice to the client or disrupt the orderly process of justice. The court finds that the motion must be denied due to the failure to file a proposed order. The moving party is directed to give notice.
