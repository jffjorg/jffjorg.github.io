On
August 11, 2020, Plaintiffs Jeffery Scott David (“David”) and Carlis Pegues
(“Pegues”) (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) filed their initial Complaint against
Defendant Charles Cobbs Apartment, LP (“Cobbs”) (“Defendant”).  On June 11, 2021, Plaintiffs filed the
operative first amended complaint (“FAC”). 
On March 27, 2023, David filed his notice of settlement.
On
September 11, 2023, David’s counsel, Ogochukwu Victor Onwaeze, filed the
instant Motion to be Relieved as Counsel. 
Trial
is not set in this case. 
 
Legal
Standard
California Rule of Court rule 3.1362 (Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel)
requires (1) notice of motion and motion to be directed to the client (made on
the Notice of Motion and Motion to be Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-051));
(2) a declaration stating in general terms and without compromising the
confidentiality of the attorney-client relationship why a motion under Code of
Civil Procedure section 284(2) is brought instead of filing a consent under
Code of Civil Procedure section 284(1) (made on the Declaration in Support of
Attorney’s Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-052)); (3) service
of the notice of motion and motion and declaration on all other parties who
have appeared in the case; and (4) the proposed order relieving counsel
(prepared on the Order Granting Attorney’s Motion to Be Relieved as
Counsel—Civil form (MC-053)). 
The court has discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw, and such a
motion should be granted provided that there is no prejudice to the client, and
it does not disrupt the orderly process of justice.  (Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21
Cal.App.4th 904, 915.)
 
Discussion
Counsel
has submitted completed MC-051 and MC-052 forms but failed to file a proposed
order (MC-053 form).  Therefore,
Counsel’s motion must be denied. 
Counsel
has provided a declaration stating a there is a breakdown of the
attorney-client relationship.  (See
Decl. of Onwaeze.)  Counsel has indicated
that David was served with copies of the motion papers filed with the
declaration at David’s last known address and has confirmed within the past 30
days that the address is current via email correspondence.
 
Conclusion
David’s counsel’s Motion to
Be Relieved as Counsel is denied, without prejudice.
Moving Party to give notice.
