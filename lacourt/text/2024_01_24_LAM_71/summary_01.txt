And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling states that the court will dismiss the plaintiff's claim without prejudice due to the plaintiff's failure to serve the summons and complaint on properly named Doe defendants. The plaintiff filed the matter on March 25, 2019, and then filed three pleadings on September 28, 2023, attempting to name the defendants as Princess Inn, Praven Patel, and Dipak Patel. The court rejected these pleadings, instructing the plaintiff to use the correct form, but the plaintiff appears to have disregarded this instruction and attempted to serve the defendants with the pleadings. The court also rejected the plaintiff's requests to enter defaults against the defendants. The court finds that the plaintiff's claim must be dismissed due to the failure to properly serve the defendants, in accordance with California Code of Civil Procedure sections 581(g), 583.210, and 583.250.
