  Case Number:  19STCV10360    Hearing Date:   January 24, 2024    Dept:  71             Plaintiff filed  this matter on March 25, 2019.  On September  28, 2023, Plaintiff filed 3 pleadings purporting to name Doe 1 as Princess Inn,  Doe 2 as Praven Patel, and Doe 3 as Dipak Patel.  The Court rejected these 3 pleadings, instructing  Plaintiff that Doe amendments must be made on Los Angeles Superior Court Form  CIV 105.  Plaintiff appears to have  disregarded the Court’s rejection of the pleadings and has purported to have  served the 3 defendants with a Summons, Complaint, and the 3 pleadings.               Plaintiff  has since attempted to enter defaults against the 3 defendants names as  Does.  The Court has rejected the requests  for entry of default.             The Court  finds that Plaintiff’s claim must be dismissed without prejudice on account of Plaintiff’s  failure to serve the summons and complaint on properly named Doe defendants, pursuant  to Code of Civil Procedure sections 581(g), 583.210, and 583.250.
