[1] Plaintiff and the City stipulated to dismiss the City
from this action without prejudice, on the condition that if and when this
Court overrules Defendant’s demurrer(s) and denies the instant Case Two anti-SLAPP
Motion, the City will be added back to the action and named as a defendant, and
the City shall not raise any of the same issues in a responsive pleading that
were already litigated and decided in connection with Defendant’s demurrer(s)
and/or Case Two anti-SLAPP Motion. 
(10/10/23 Stipulation.) 
Therefore, at this juncture, the City has been dismissed and is not a
party to this action.
