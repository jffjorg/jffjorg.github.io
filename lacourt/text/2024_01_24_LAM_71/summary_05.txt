And here is the English text summary:

The Judge is issuing a tentative ruling on a motion for sanctions filed by Defendant Arakelian Enterprises, Inc. dba Athens Services against Plaintiff WasteXperts, Inc. and its attorney, Christopher Frost, and the law firm Frost LLP.

The Defendant claims that the Plaintiff's complaint is frivolous and requests that the Court impose terminating sanctions, monetary sanctions to reimburse the Defendant for all attorneys' fees and costs incurred, and any other order deemed just. The Plaintiff argues that the complaint was not objectively unreasonable and that the Defendant already has an adequate remedy to seek reimbursement of its fees and costs under the anti-SLAPP Statute.

The Judge finds that the Plaintiff's Complaint was not objectively unreasonable because it is arguable that the Plaintiff believed the declaratory relief cause of action in Case Two was substantially different from the declaratory relief cause of action in Case One. The Judge also finds that the Defendant already has an adequate remedy to seek reimbursement of its fees and costs under the anti-SLAPP Statute and that the requested sanctions are not warranted. Therefore, the Judge denies the Defendant's motion for sanctions.
