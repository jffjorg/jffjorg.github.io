TENTATIVE
  RULING RE:
 
MOTION TO
  QUASH FOR LACK OF PERSONAL JURISDICTION




 
Background 
Plaintiffs Chuanjie Yang, Ollie Lan aka Ruoning Lan, Yu Xia Lu,
and Liu Liu (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) filed this action on October 11, 2022
against Defendants Market America, Inc., Market America Worldwide, Inc., James
Howard Ridinger, Loren Ridinger, and Marc Ashley. The Complaint alleges one
cause of action for declaratory relief. 
Market America Worldwide, Inc., Loren Ridinger, and Marc Ashley (collectively,
the “Moving Parties”) now move “for
an order quashing service of summons and dismissing the claims against them.”
Plaintiffs oppose. 
Discussion
As an initial matter, Market America, Inc., Market America Worldwide,
Inc., Loren Ridinger, and Marc Ashley filed another motion on August 4, 2023 for an order dismissing this action on the grounds
of forum non conveniens. A hearing on this motion was held on October 9,
2023, and on October 9, 2023, the Court issued a minute order indicating, inter
alia, that “In this matter, previously submitted, the Court now
rules as follows:…Based on the foregoing, The Motion to Dismiss filed by Market
America Worldwide, Inc., Market America, Inc., Marc Ashley, Loren Ridinger on
08/04/2023 is Granted.” 
 The instant motion indicates, inter
alia, that “Defendants Market
America Worldwide, Ridinger, and Ashley also move for dismissal on the basis of
forum non conveniens as an alternative ground to their current motion to
quash due to lack of personal jurisdiction.” (Mot. at p. 2, fn. 3.) 
In light of the Court’s October 9, 2023 order on Market America, Inc.,
Market America Worldwide, Inc., Loren Ridinger, and Marc Ashley’s motion to
dismiss, the instant motion is denied as moot. 
Conclusion 
Based on the foregoing, the Court denies as moot the Moving Parties’ motion for an order
quashing service of summons and dismissing the claims against them. 
The
Moving Parties shall give notice of this ruling.
