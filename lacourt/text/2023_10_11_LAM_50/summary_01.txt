And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to quash service of summons and dismiss claims against Market America, Inc., Market America Worldwide, Inc., James Howard Ridinger, Loren Ridinger, and Marc Ashley. The motion was filed in response to the plaintiffs' complaint, which alleges one cause of action for declaratory relief. The defendants argue that the Court lacks personal jurisdiction over them and that the forum is inconvenient. However, the Court has already granted a motion to dismiss filed by the same defendants on August 4, 2023, based on forum non conveniens. As a result, the instant motion is denied as moot. The defendants are ordered to give notice of this ruling.
