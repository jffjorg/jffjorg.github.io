[1] The declaration states:
 
I Bruce Wall declare under penalty of perjury that I
did not sign print or date the legal release of Juul labs inc. and that the
release they produced is a fabrication. 
 
(3/19/24 Wall Decl., p. 1.)  
 


[2] The addendum states:
 
Steve Davis misrepresented me.  I asked Tor Hoerman to replace him as my
Attorney and they refused.  I was and am
forced to represent myself Pro Se because no other Attorney that I have made
contact with would take my case.
 
As Pro Se not one piece of legal information was added
or sent to my contacts and I have been left in the dark until I was sent an
email that read Jull Labs Product Case 21stcv1976 motion to dismiss.  It contained the motion and a separate
document that portrayed it coming directly from the Judge himself.  I have produced that document.
 
The settlement does not reach economic damages.  Damages far exceed the offer.
 
The settlement does not satisfy non economic
damages.  Damages exceed the offer.
 
The settlement does not reach punitive damages for the
reckless conduct and complete disregard for my safety and their conscious
awareness of their lies and wrong doing.
 
I humbly ask this court to deny this motion to
dismiss.
 
I ask the court to let me opt out of the settlement
and attempt to litigate as Pro Se to argue damages that will make me whole.
 
(3/20/24 Wall Addendum, p. 1.) 
 


[3] Wall remains free to pursue whatever remedies might
still be available to him – e.g., filing a motion for relief.  On the instant record, though, granting JLI’s
motion is warranted.
