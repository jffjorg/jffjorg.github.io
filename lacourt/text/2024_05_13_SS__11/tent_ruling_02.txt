TENTATIVE RULING
 
JLI’s motion to dismiss Plaintiff Bruce Wall’s claims with prejudice is
granted.
 
BACKGROUND
 
This is a coordinated
action.  The complaints allege that JLI
manufactured and marketed defective and harmful e-cigarettes, targeting
children.
 
On April 2, 2024, JLI’s motion to
dismiss Bruce Wall’s claims with prejudice for failure to comply with the
settlement procedures came on for hearing. 
Wall did not file opposition papers, but he did post a declaration and
addendum on Case Anywhere.  The Court
found the declaration and addendum defective and continued the matter to give
Wall additional time to hire an attorney and/or to file and serve corrected
versions and an opposition brief.
 
The issue now is whether the
motion to dismiss should be granted.  
 
DISCUSSION
 
JLI contends the motion to
dismiss should be granted because (1) “Mr. Wall is a Settling Plaintiff under
the terms of the Settlement Agreement, (2) his Release extinguished all claims
– past and future – against JLI and the Settling Defendants,” and (3) he
“already received an allocation – including an [Extraordinary Injury Fund]
allocation – for his claims against JLI and Settling Defendants, which he will
receive from [the settlement administrator] upon dismissal of his claims with
prejudice.”  (3/12/24 Motion to Dismiss,
p. 7.)
 
The Court agrees.  The motion is granted for the following
reasons:
 
* Wall failed to file an initial
opposition brief.
 
* He failed to file a
supplemental opposition brief by the April 29th deadline.
 
* To date, the motion continues
to be unopposed.
 
* As noted last time, Wall’s
initial declaration and addendum are defective and cannot be considered
because:
 
– There is no
proof of service showing that Wall served the documents on JLI and the Settling
Defendants.
 
– He failed to
file the documents (neither appears on eCourt).
 
– The
declaration fails to state where it was executed and that it was made under
penalty of perjury under California law. 
(See 3/19/24 Wall Decl., p. 1.)[1]
 
– The addendum
is unsigned, also fails to state where it was executed, and also fails to state
that it was made under penalty of perjury under California law.  (See 3/20/24 Wall Addendum, p. 1.)[2]
 
* The exhibits emailed by Wall to
JLI on April 11th and 12th are also defective and cannot
be considered because:
 
– Wall failed to
file the exhibits himself (they are attached to a courtesy notice filed by JLI
on April 12th).
 
– The exhibits,
which consist of photographs of a one-page opposition dated April
12th, Wall’s defective initial declaration, and a notarized
statement dated March 19th, are not true and correct copies of the
actual documents.  (See 4/12/24 Danninger
Aff., Ex. A, pp. 1-3.)
 
– There is no
statement from Wall authenticating the exhibits, verifying them, or showing
that any of them were executed under penalty of perjury under California law.
 
* The Court already provided Wall
extra time to secure counsel and/or to file and serve corrected versions of his
documents and an opposition brief.
 
* JLI’s moving brief demonstrates
Wall’s noncompliance with the settlement procedures.  (See 3/12/24 Motion to Dismiss, pp. 3-10.)[3]
