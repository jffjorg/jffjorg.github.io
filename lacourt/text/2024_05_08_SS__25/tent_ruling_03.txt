 
BACKGROUND
 
On March 18, 2020, Plaintiff Aspire
General Insurance Company commenced this subrogation action against Bernabe
Cuevas Perez and Rene H. Perez (“Defendants”). 
 
On January 25, 2021, the Court
entered default judgment against Defendants. 
 
On April 11, 2023, the Court
entered an order for post-judgment installment payments and stay of execution
pursuant to the stipulation of the parties. 
 
On August 3, 2023, Plaintiff filed
an acknowledgement of satisfaction of judgement.
 
On March 19, 2024, Plaintiff filed
the instant motion to vacate the filing of the full satisfaction of judgment. The
motion is unopposed.
 
MOVING PARTY
POSITION
 
            Plaintiff
seeks to have its filing of the full satisfaction of judgment vacated.
Plaintiff contends that its counsel inadvertently filed the satisfaction of
judgement when the judgment had not yet been fully satisfied.
 
OPPOSITION
 
            None filed.

 
REPLY
 
            None filed.
ANALYSIS
 
I.          Legal
Standard 
If the entry of satisfaction of
judgment is procured by fraud or mistake, or the consideration fails, the
aggrieved judgment creditor may have it vacated, either by motion in the
original action or by an independent action in equity. (Clark v. Johnston
(1920) 49 Cal.App. 315, 318; Argue v. Wilson (1935) 3 Cal.App.2d 645,
646.)
Additionally, the court has broad
inherent power to correct its records at any time so that they may truthfully
reflect what proceedings actually transpired. (Chester v. Chester (1946)
76 Cal.App.2d 265, 268-69.)
II.        Discussion
 
Here, Plaintiff contends that its
counsel made an honest mistake and inadvertently filed the full satisfaction of
judgment. The judgment has not been fully satisfied as there is a payment plan
for the existing judgment and the last payment is due on October 1, 2026. 
 
The Court observes that the record
reflects this payment plan.  
 
The motion is unopposed. 
 
Based on the foregoing, the Court
GRANTS the motion.
 
III.       Conclusion 
            
            For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff Aspire General
Insurance Company’s Motion to Vacate Full Satisfaction of Judgment Entered on
08/03/2023 is GRANTED.
 
The
“Acknowledgement and Satisfaction of Judgment” filed on 08/03/2023 is hereby
stricken.
 
The Moving Party is ordered to give notice.
