Summary:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge Rolf Treu in the case of Sundo Hong v. Sun Be Hong (23STCV12280). The case involves a dispute over the partition by sale of a commercial property held equally as joint tenants by the plaintiff and defendant. The plaintiff filed a motion for interlocutory judgment of partition by sale and appointment of partition referee, which was granted by the court on May 1, 2024. The defendant has now filed a motion for reconsideration, which the court has denied. The court found that the defendant had sufficient information to offer earlier, but failed to file an opposition, and therefore did not establish new or different circumstances that could not have been offered earlier.
