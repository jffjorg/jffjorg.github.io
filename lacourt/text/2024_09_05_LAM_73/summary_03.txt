And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied the defendant's motion to relate and consolidate two legal cases, 24STCV00516 and 24STCV00523, brought by two different plaintiffs against the same defendant, Hardage Hospitality. The court found that the cases are not related and cannot be consolidated because they are in different departments and have not been related in a single department. The defendant's motion was procedurally deficient and did not comply with the court's rules. The court also noted that the cases have different facts, including different injuries suffered by the two plaintiffs. The court's decision was based on the legal standards of California Rules of Court, rule 3.300(a), and Code of Civil Procedure, section 1048, which provide that a court may order the consolidation of cases that share a common question of fact or law. The court's decision is intended to promote trial convenience and economy by avoiding duplication of procedure and to ensure that the rights of the parties are not affected.
