And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge, Hon. Rolf Treu, has issued a tentative ruling granting the Plaintiff's Motion to Vacate Dismissal and Enter Judgment. The case involves a dispute between Chicago Title Insurance Company (the Plaintiff) and Solution4Home.com, LLC, et al. (the Defendants) over a settlement agreement.

The Plaintiff brought an action against the Defendants in 2020, alleging that they had defrauded the Plaintiff's insureds, which resulted in title insurance claims. The parties entered into a Stipulation for Entry of Judgment in 2022, under which the Defendants agreed to pay the Plaintiff $75,000 over a period of time.

However, the Defendants failed to fulfill their obligations under the Stipulation, and the Plaintiff filed a Motion to Vacate Dismissal and Enter Judgment. The Plaintiff argues that the Defendants defaulted on their payments and that the Court should enter judgment against them.

The Judge has granted the Plaintiff's Motion, finding that the Defendants defaulted on their obligations under the Stipulation. The Judge has entered judgment in the amount of $23,370, which is the principal sum of $75,000 less the amount already paid by the Defendants ($51,630).
