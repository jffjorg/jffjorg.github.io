Demurrer to FIRST AMENDED complaint (filed 07/30/2024)
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
The demurrer
to Plaintiff’s first, second, third and fourth causes of action is SUSTAINED
without leave to amend. 
 
BACKGROUND
 
On February
27, 2024, Plaintiff Emma T.
Malloy (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against
Defendant Earl Hall (“Defendant”) 
 
On June 7,
2024, Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) alleging the following
causes of action:
            C/A 1: Financial Elder Abuse
            C/A 2: Quiet Title
            C/A 3: Fraud
            C/A 4: Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

 
The FAC alleges
the following. On November
28, 1969, Charlie and Emma T. Malloy purchased the residential property located
at 1751 W. 38th Street, Los Angeles, CA 90062. (FAC,
¶ 10.) Title recorded under Charlie and Emma T. Malloy continued to
remain in both names until October 31, 2002, when a Quitclaim Deed was signed,
transferring title from Charlie Malloy and Emma T. Malloy to Defendant Earl
Hall. (FAC, ¶ 11.) Plaintiff became aware of
the fraudulent transfer of title to the Defendant in May 2019, when her
daughter, Tracy Hall, learned that her brother, Defendant, had taken loans out
on the property. (FAC, ¶ 13.) Plaintiff did
not agree nor intend to ever quitclaim her property to the Defendant and does
not remember signing the Quitclaim Deed, nor did Plaintiff agree to the
multiple encumbrances identified in the Title Point Property Search prior to
this fraudulent real property transfer. (FAC, ¶ 16.)
 
On July 30, 2024, Defendant filed a
Demurrer to the FAC, arguing:
·      
Plaintiff’s first, second, third and
fourth causes of action are facially barred by the statutes of limitations 
On August 12, 2024, Plaintiff filed an
opposition, arguing:
·      
Plaintiff is eligible for tolling of the
statute of limitations pursuant to Emergency Rule 9. (See Cal. R. Ct.,
Emergency Rule 9.) In addition, Plaintiff has in the past and continues to
suffer from an inability to handle her business affairs as a competent adult. Plaintiff
was legally incapacitated due to illness and infirmity, not due to age. All of Plaintiff’s causes of action
should be allowed to proceed based on the foregoing.
Defendant filed a reply, arguing:
·      
The FAC is devoid of any facts Plaintiff
was legally incapacitated. There is no basis for the causes of action in the
FAC to be tolled due to any alleged legal incapacity.
·      
Further, any amendment that Plaintiff
was legally incapacitated would be would be factually inconsistent with prior
verified pleadings wherein Plaintiff alleged that she personally became aware
of  the alleged fraudulent transfer in
May 2019.
ANALYSIS
 
A.     Legal
Standard for Demurrer
 
A demurrer tests the sufficiency of whether the
complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) When
considering demurrers, courts read the allegations liberally and in context—any
defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial
notice. (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968,
994.) “A demurrer tests the pleading alone, and not the evidence or facts
alleged.” (E-Fab, Inc. v. Accountants, Inc. Servs. (2007) 153
Cal.App.4th 1308, 1315.) As such, the court assumes the truth of the
complaint’s properly pleaded or implied factual allegations. (Id.) The
only issue a demurrer is concerned with is whether the complaint, as it stands,
states a cause of action. (Hahn, supra, 147 Cal.App.4th at p.
747.) 
 
B.     Meet and
Confer Requirement 
 
“Before filing a demurrer pursuant to
this chapter, the demurring party shall meet and confer in person or by
telephone with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for
the purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached that would
resolve the objections to be raised in the demurrer.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
430.41, subd. (a).)  
 
Here, counsel for Defendants submitted a declaration stating he met
and conferred with Plaintiff’s counsel by telephone on July 5, 2024 regarding
the alleged deficiencies in the FAC. (Davis Decl., ¶¶
3-5.) The Court finds the moving party has met its obligation to meet and
confer.
 
C.     Judicial
Notice
 
Defendant
requests the Court take judicial notice of the following: 
1.     Trust Deed
recorded on June 13, 1984 as Instrument No. 84703287 in the Official Records of
the County Recorder of Los Angeles County, State of California;
2.     Trust Deed
recorded on August 29, 1986 as Instrument No. 861135722 in the Official Records
of the County Recorder of Los Angeles County, State of California; 
3.     Trust Deed
recorded on December 9, 1987 as Instrument No. 871943799 in the Official
Records of the County Recorder of Los Angeles County, State of California;
4.     Trust Deed
recorded on May 11, 1989 as Instrument No. 89756981 in the Official Records of
the County Recorder of Los Angeles County, State of California;
5.     Trust Deed
recorded on October 25, 1991 as Instrument No. 1688751 in the Official Records
of the County Recorder of Los Angeles County, State of California;
6.     Trust Deed
recorded on October 25, 1991 as Instrument No. 1688752 in the Official Records
of the County Recorder of Los Angeles County, State of California.
 
The Court may
take judicial notice of “facts and propositions that are not reasonably subject
to dispute and are capable of immediate and accurate determination by resort to
sources of reasonably indisputable accuracy.” (Evid. Code § 452(h).) While courts take judicial notice of
public records, they do not take judicial notice of the truth of matters stated
therein. [Citation.] ‘When judicial notice is taken of a document,…the truthfulness and proper interpretation of the document
are disputable.’ [Citation.]” (Herrera v. Deutsche National Trust Co. (2011)
196 Cal.App.4th 1366, 1375.) Further, “courts have taken judicial notice of the existence and
recordation of real property records...[because] [t]he official act of
recordation and the common use of a notary public in the execution of such
documents assure their reliability, and the maintenance of the documents in the
recorder’s office makes their existence and text capable of ready confirmation,
thereby placing such documents beyond reasonable dispute.” (Fontenot v.
Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 256, 264.)
 
The Court
judicially notices all of Defendant’s requests. 
 
D.     Demurrer to First,
Second, Third and Fourth Causes of Action: Statute of Limitations
 
Defendant
argues Plaintiff’s causes of actions are facially barred by the statutes of
limitations.
For a statute
of limitations to bar a claim on demurrer, “the defect must clearly and
affirmatively appear on the face of the complaint; it is not enough that the
complaint shows that the action may be barred.” (Committee for Green
Foothills v. Santa Clara County Bd. of Supervisors (2010) 48 Cal.4th 32,
42, internal quotation marks omitted.) In general, a statute of limitations
begins to run “when the cause of action is complete with all of its elements,”
namely, wrongdoing, causation, and resulting harm. (Norgart v. Upjohn Co.
(1999) 21 Cal.4th 383, 397 (Norgart).)  
 
The statute of limitations for financial abuse of an elder or
dependent adult is four years after the plaintiff discovers, or through the
exercise of reasonable diligence should have discovered, the facts constituting
the financial abuse. (Cal. Welf. & Inst. Code§ 15657.7).
 
The statute
of limitations for a cause of action for fraud is three years. (Cal. Code Civ.
Proc., § 338, subd. (d).) If an
action is brought more than three years after commission of the fraud, the
plaintiff has the burden of pleading and proving that he did not make the
discovery until within three years prior to the filing of his complaint. (Hobart
v. Hobart Estate Co. (1945) 26 Cal.2d 412, 437.)
 
A claim for declaratory relief is subject to the same limitations
period as the legal or equitable claim on which it is based. (Bank of N.Y.
Mellon v. Citibank, N.A. (2017) 8 Cal. App.5th 935, 943; Ginsburg v.
Gamson (2012) 205 Cal. App. 4th 873, 883.) Similarly, the theory of relief
underlying the action for quiet title determines which statute of limitations
applies. (Leeper v. Beltrami (1959) 53 Cal. 2d 195, 214; Ankoanda v.
Walker-Smith (1996) 44 Cal. App. 4th 610, 615.)
 
As the Court previously found when it sustained the original
Complaint, Plaintiff’s
first, second, third and fourth causes of action are barred under the statute
of limitations. The Complaint
alleges that Plaintiff discovered the facts constituting the alleged fraudulent
transfer of property in May 2019. The Complaint states: “Plaintiff became aware of the fraudulent transfer of title to the
Defendant in May 2019, when her daughter, Tracy Hall, learned that her brother,
Earl Hall, had taken loans out on the property.” (FAC
¶¶ 13, 24.) Therefore, Plaintiff’s
first cause of action for financial elder abuse would have needed to be brought
by May 2023, within four years of her discovery. Plaintiff’s third cause of
action for fraud would have needed to be brought by May 2022, within three
years of her discovery. Plaintiff’s second cause of action for quiet title and declaratory
relief are based on Plaintiff’s financial elder abuse or fraud claims and
subject to the same statute of limitations. Here, Plaintiff filed this action
February 27, 2024. Thus, over four years have passed since the discovery of the
alleged financial abuse, which is past the statute of limitations for
Plaintiff’s first, second, third, and fourth causes of action. 
 
In opposition,
Plaintiff argues she is eligible for
tolling of the statute of limitations pursuant to Emergency Rule 9. California¿Rules¿of Court, appendix I (Emergency¿Rule¿9),
which provides that, “[n]otwithstanding any other law, the statutes of
limitations and repose for civil causes of action that exceed 180 days are
tolled from April 6, 2020, until October 1, 2020.”¿(Cal.¿Rules¿of Court, appen.
I,¿Emergency¿Rule¿9(a).) On May 29, 2020, the Judicial Council added an Advisory
Committee comment to the¿rule¿explaining that the¿rule¿“is intended to apply
broadly to toll any statute of limitations on the filing of a pleading in court
asserting a civil cause of action,” and that “[t]he term ‘civil causes of
action’ includes special proceedings.”¿(Advisory Com. com, Cal.¿Rules¿of Court,
appen, I,¿emergency¿rule¿9, (emphasis added).) Accordingly, the
statute of limitations could not expire on any civil causes of action between
April 6, 2020 and October 1, 2020. (Lantzy v.
Centex Homes (2003) 31 Cal.4th 363, 370 (“the limitations period stops
running during the tolling event, and begins to run again only when the tolling
event has concluded.”).) Here, Plaintiff only states she is eligible for
tolling pursuant to this rule, without explaining why or how. As such, the
Court does not find this rule tolled the statute of limitations here. 
Next, Plaintiff argues she has in the past and continues to suffer
from an inability to handle her business affairs as a competent adult. Plaintiff
asserts in her opposition that was legally incapacitated due to illness and
infirmity, not due to age. However, Plaintiff’s assertion is not verified or
supported by a declaration under penalty of perjury. Moreover, the FAC does not
contain any allegations that Plaintiff was legally incapacitated in May 2019,
the date she discovered the alleged fraudulent transfer and her causes of
action against Defendant began to accrue. Thus, the Court does not find any
alleged legal incapacity tolled the statute of limitations. 
The Court does not find Plaintiff has shown that the pleading
can be amended successfully. Where a demurrer is sustained, leave to amend must
be allowed where there is a reasonable possibility of successful amendment. (Goodman
v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.) The burden is on the plaintiff to
show the court that a pleading can be amended successfully. (Id.; Lewis
v. YouTube, LLC (2015) 244 Cal.App.4th 118, 226.) Not only did
Plaintiff not request leave to amend in her Opposition, but there
was no indication in the Opposition that Plaintiff would be able to cure the
defects of the FAC. (Rakestraw v. California Physicians' Service (2000)
81 Cal. App. 4th 39, 43, 96 Cal.Rptr.2d 354, 356). Plaintiff’s claim that she
was legally incapacitated is factually inconsistent with the allegations in the
prior pleadings that state when and how Plaintiff became aware of the
fraudulent transfer. (FAC
¶¶ 13, 24.) A proposed amendment to a pleading
that is "factually inconsistent" with prior pleadings and there is no
plausible explanation for the inconsistency, should be denied by the Court as a
sham pleading. (See Smyth v. Berman (2019) 31 Cal. App. 14 5th 183,
195-196.) Therefore, the Court does not find amendment
of the FAC should be permitted. There is no basis in law to grant leave to
amend where, “the facts are not in dispute and the nature of the claim is clear
but no liability exists under substantive law.” (Casterson v. Sup. Ct.
(2002) 101 Cal.App.4th 177, 190). 
 
Based on the
foregoing, Defendant’s demurrer
to Plaintiff’s first, second, third and fourth causes of action is SUSTAINED
without leave to amend.  
 
E.    
Conclusion

 
The
demurrer to Plaintiff’s first, second, third and fourth causes of action is
SUSTAINED without leave to amend.
