DEFENDANT’S motion to DECLARE RELATED AND

TENTATIVE RULING
 
The Court DENIES
Defendant’s Motion to Relate and Consolidate Case Nos. 24STCV00516 and 24STCV00523. 
 
BACKGROUND
 
On January 8, 2024, Plaintiff Ana Sabala Brooks
filed this action against Defendant Hardage Hospitality.
 
On March 20, 2024, Plaintiff filed a First
Amended Complaint, alleging the following causes of action: 
1.     
Disability Discrimination; 
2.     
Failure to Provide Reasonable Accommodation;
3.     
Failure to Engage in Good Faith Interactive Process;
4.     
Retaliation; and 
5.     
Wrongful Termination.
 
The FAC alleges the following. Plaintiff was employed by Defendants
from July 5, 2021 until January 26, 2022. At the time of her termination,
Plaintiff worked as a Room Attendant. On or about September 2021, Plaintiff’s back
began to hurt and on or about October 2021, her right wrist also started
hurting. Plaintiff notified her supervisors about her injuries, but they did
not take any action. On January 26, 2022, Plaintiff was terminated after being
accused of sexual harassment by a co-worker. Plaintiff alleges she was actually
terminated in retaliation for her request for reasonable accommodations.
 
On July 24, 2024, Defendant filed the instant Motion to Relate and Consolidate Case
Nos. 24STCV00516
and 24STCV00523, arguing:
·       The Brooks and Alcerro actions should be related and consolidated
because they seek the same types of damages from identical causes of action
against the same Defendant based on a single incident that resulted in
Plaintiffs’ simultaneous suspension and termination
·       The benefits of consolidation outweigh any burden
 
In
opposition, Plaintiff contends:
·       On May 8, 2024, the Court already determined the cases were not
related.
·       Defendant’s motion is an improper motion for reconsideration
·       Defendant has failed to file a notice of appeal to the denial of
the notice to relate cases
·      
Nevertheless,
the facts of the cases are different. Both Plaintiffs have different injuries. One
Plaintiff was sent to a company doctor and given work restrictions which
Defendant did not honor. 
·       Consolidating
the cases would create prejudice. The credibility or lack of potential
credibility by one Plaintiff might negatively affect the other Plaintiff’s case
 
 In reply, Defendant argues:
·      
Plaintiff did not provide defense counsel with any
authority supporting their position that a case must first be ordered “related”
before it can be ordered “consolidated”
·      
Thus, the cases should be consolidated
 
ANALYSIS
 
A.      Evidentiary
Objections
 
Defendant
objects to the declaration of Rami Kayyali in support of Plaintiff’s
Opposition.
 
The Court
overrules Defendant’s objections. 
 
B.      Legal Standard
“When actions
involving a common question of law or fact are pending before the court, it may
order a joint hearing or trial of any or all the matters in issue in the
actions; it may order all the actions consolidated and it may make such orders
concerning proceedings therein as may tend to avoid unnecessary costs or
delay.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1048, subd. (a).) “Coordination of civil actions
sharing a common question of fact or law is appropriate if one judge hearing
all of the actions . . . will promote the ends of justice taking into account
whether the common question of fact or law is predominating and significant to
the litigation; the convenience of the parties, witnesses, and counsel; the
relative development of the actions and the work product of counsel; the
efficient utilization; the calendar of the courts; the disadvantages of
duplicative and inconsistent rulings, orders, or judgments; and, the likelihood
of settlement of the actions without further litigation should coordination be
denied.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 404.1.)  
“The purpose
of consolidation is merely to promote trial convenience and economy by avoiding
duplication of procedure, particularly in the proof of issues common to both
actions.”  (Estate of Baker (1982) 131 Cal.App.3d 471, 485
[citation omitted].) “A consolidation of actions does not affect the rights of
the parties.” (Ibid.)  Consolidation does not require identical
causes of action in each case, absolute identity of the parties, or identical
allegations. (Ibid.)  Where common issues are present in two cases
then consolidation is appropriate.  (Todd-Stenberg v. Dalkon Shield
Claimants Trust (1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 976, 978-79.)   
C.      Discussion
 
Defendant
seeks to relate and consolidate Case Nos. 24STCV00516 and 24STCV00523. 
 
As an initial matter, the Court notes that the instant Motion
to Consolidate Cases is procedurally deficient and does not comply with Los Angeles County Court Rules, Rule 3.3(g)(1). 
Los Angeles
County Court Rules, Rule 3.3(g)(1) provides that “[c]ases may not be
consolidated unless they are in the same department. A motion to consolidate
two or more cases may be noticed and heard after the cases, initially filed in
different departments, have been related in a single department, or if the
cases were already assigned to that department.”  
On May 8, 2024, the Court found that the following cases,
24STCV00516 and 24STCV00523, are not related within the meaning of California
Rules of Court, rule 3.300(a), stating that Plaintiff in each case is
different. (Court’s 5/8/24 Minute Order.) Defendant has not filed a motion for
reconsideration or appealed the Court’s order. In addition, the cases are not
assigned to the same department. Case No. 24STCV00516 is in this department,
Department 73, and Case No. 24STCV00523
is in a different department, Department 32. Therefore, the cases cannot be
consolidated because they are not in the same department and have not been
related in a single department.
 
Based on the foregoing, Defendant’s
motion is DENIED.
 
DISPOSITION
 

The Court DENIES Defendant’s Motion to Relate and Consolidate Case
Nos. 24STCV00516 and
24STCV00523.
