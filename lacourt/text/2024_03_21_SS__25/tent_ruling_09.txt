On July 27, 2023, Plaintiffs Alexey
Pereira (“Pereira”) and Antonio Rodriguez (“Rodriguez”) (collectively “Plaintiffs”)
brought three causes of action against Defendants Car Lux, Inc (“Car Lux”),
Capital One Auto Finance, Inc. (“Capital One Auto”), and Western Surety Company
(“Western Surety”) (collectively “Defendants”) for 1) violation of the
Consumers Legal Remedies Act under Civil Code § 1750 et seq., 2) violation of
CA Business and Professions Code § 17200, et seq., Unlawful Acts or Practices,
3) claim against surety. 
 
On September 25, 2023, Plaintiffs
filed their First Amended Complaint adding a fourth cause of action against
Defendants for violation of CCP §§ 1281.97 & 1281.99.
 
Defendants Car Lux and Western
Surety filed their Answer on October 24, 2023. 
 
On January 23, 2024, Plaintiffs
filed the instant Motion to Compel Arbitration, Motion for Court to Pick

MOVING PARTY
POSITION
 
Plaintiffs pray for the Court to issue
an order compelling Car Lux and Capital One to arbitrate the controversy
pursuant to the grievance and arbitration provision of the Retail Installment
Sales Contract (“RISC”) between the parties and order for a stay of the proceedings
pending the results of the arbitration under CCP §§ 1281.2, 1281.97, and
1281.99. Plaintiffs argue that the RISC contains a valid agreement to arbitrate
the current controversy. 
 
OPPOSITION
 
            No
opposition has been filed.

ANALYSIS
 
I.          Legal
Standard 
“A party who
claims that there is a written agreement to arbitrate may petition the superior
court for an order to compel arbitration” pursuant to California Code of Civil
Procedure section 1281.2. (Banner Entertainment, Inc. v. Superior Court
(1998) 62 Cal.App.4th 348, 356.) “California law, like federal law, favors
enforcement of valid arbitration agreements.” (Armendariz v. Foundation
Health Psychcare Services, Inc. (2000) 24 Cal.4th 83, 97.) “On petition of
a party to an arbitration agreement alleging the existence of a written
agreement to arbitrate a controversy and that a party to the agreement refuses
to arbitrate that controversy, the court shall order the petitioner and the
respondent to arbitrate the controversy if it determines that an agreement to
arbitrate the controversy exists, unless it determines that: (a) The right to
compel arbitration has been waived by the petitioner; or (b) Grounds exist for
rescission of the agreement.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 1281.2.) A party opposing a
petition to compel arbitration “bears the burden of proving by a preponderance
of the evidence any fact necessary to its defense.” (Banner Entertainment,
Inc. v. Superior Court, supra, 62 Cal.App.4th 348, 356.) 
 
“[T]he writing
memorializing an arbitration agreement need not be signed by both parties in
order to be upheld as a binding arbitration agreement.” Serafin v. Balco
Properties Ltd., LLC (2015) 235 Cal.App.4th 165, 176. “[I]t is not the presence
or absence of a signature which is dispositive; it is the presence or absence
of evidence of an agreement to arbitrate which matters.” (Banner
Entertainment, Inc. v. Superior Court, supra, 62 Cal.App.4th 348, 361.) 
 
Pursuant to Code
of Civil Procedure §1281.2, generally, on a petition to compel arbitration, the
court must grant the petition unless it finds either (1) no written agreement
to arbitrate exists; (2)¿the right to compel arbitration has been waived; (3) grounds
exist for revocation of the agreement; or (4) litigation is pending that may
render the arbitration unnecessary or create conflicting¿rulings on common
issues. 
 
Where a motion to
compel arbitration is granted, a court “shall, upon motion of a party to such
action or proceeding, stay the action or proceeding until an arbitration is had
in accordance with the order to arbitrate or until such earlier time as the court
specifies.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 1281.4.) 
   
II.        Discussion 
Plaintiffs bring
the instant motion seeking to compel Car Lux and Capitol One to submit to
arbitration according to the parties’ RISC under Code of Civil Procedure §
1281.2. 
Here, Plaintiffs
provide evidence of the arbitration agreement they entered with Car Lux. (Mot.,
Kasra Sadr Decl. ¶ 5, Exh. 2, p. 6 at “Arbitration”; Exh. 3.) The arbitration
agreement states that, 
Any claim or dispute, whether in contract, tort, statue or
otherwise (including the interpretation and scope of this arbitration
Provision, and the arbitrability of the claim or dispute)… which arises out of
or relates to your credit application, purchase or condition of this vehicle,
this contract or any resulting transaction or relationship…shall at your or our
election, be resolved by neutral binding arbitration and not by a court action.

(Id.) Thus, based on the preceding,
the Court finds an enforceable arbitration agreement between the parties. 
            Here,
Plaintiffs provide evidence that Car Lux and Capitol One have
not agreed to arbitration. (Mot., Sadr Decl. ¶ 3; Exh. 1.) The Court notes that
neither Defendant asserts any defense to enforcement of the arbitration
agreement, such as a waiver or other grounds to revoke the agreement. The Court
further notes that “California law, ‘like [federal law], reflects a strong
policy favoring arbitration agreements and requires close judicial scrutiny of
waiver claims.’” (Wagner Const. Co. v. Pacific
Mechanical Corp. (2007) 41 Cal.4th 19, 31.) Therefore, the Court
finds that Plaintiffs are entitled to an order compelling Car Lux and
Capitol One to arbitration. 
The Court
further notes that the arbitration agreement provides that Plaintiffs, 
…may chose the American Arbitration Association, 1633
Broadway, 10th Floor, New York, New York 10019 (www.adr.org), or any
other organization to conduct the arbitration subject to our approval…We will
pay your filing, administration, service, or case management fee and your arbitrator
or hearing fee all up to a maximum of $5,000, unless the law or the rules of
the chosen arbitration organization require us to pay more.
(Mot., Sadr Decl., Exh. 2, p. 6 at
“Arbitration Provision.”) Here, the Court notes that Plaintiffs elect that the
American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) or alternatively JAMS be the forum for
the arbitration. The agreement lays out a procedure by which the parties will
initiate and conduct arbitration and specifically provides that the AAA would
be the forum unless Plaintiffs elect otherwise. Thus, the Court finds the
parties' dispute can be sufficiently arbitrated under CCP § 1281.6 through the
AAA, or in the alternative, JAMS. 
The Court also
finds that a stay of the action is appropriate in this case once the motion is
granted, as Code of Civil Procedure § 1281.4 stipulates that the Court shall
stay the action until arbitration is completed. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1281.4.)   
            Accordingly,
the Court GRANTS Plaintiffs’ Motion to Compel Arbitration.
 
 
II.        Conclusion 
            
            Plaintiffs Alexey Pereira and
Antonio Rodriguez’s Motion to Compel Arbitration and Stay Proceedings is
GRANTED.  
 
The matter
is STAYED pending a final resolution of Plaintiff’s claims in the arbitration
proceedings as provided by the parties’ agreement.
