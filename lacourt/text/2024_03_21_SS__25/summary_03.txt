And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the plaintiff's motion to vacate the dismissal of the action. The plaintiff's counsel had missed the scheduled trial date due to a calendaring error, and the court had previously dismissed the action due to the parties' failure to appear. The plaintiff argues that the error was caused by their counsel's mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect, and therefore seeks relief under California Code of Civil Procedure section 473. The court finds that the motion is timely filed and that the error was caused by the counsel's mistake, and grants the motion to vacate the dismissal. The court sets an order to show cause regarding dismissal/settlement for November 5, 2024, and orders the moving party to give notice.
