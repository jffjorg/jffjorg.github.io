Plaintiff argues  that due to its attorney’s mistake, inadvertence, surprise, and  excusable neglect in mis-calendaring the non-jury trial, Plaintiff missed the  hearing thus resulting in the Court’s order dismissing the matter. Counsel  states that had he appeared he would have informed the Court that a settlement  between the parties had been reached.    OPPOSITION               No  opposition has been filed.    REPLY               No reply  has been filed.    ANALYSIS   I.          Legal  Standard Under Code of Civil Procedure, section 473, subdivision  (b), “the court may, upon any terms as may be just, relieve a party or his or  her legal representative from a judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding  taken against him or her through his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or  excusable neglect.” (Code Civ. Proc., §473(b)). Relief under this section is  mandatory when based on an attorney affidavit of fault; otherwise, it is  discretionary. (Id.) An application for relief must be made no more than  six months after entry of the order from which relief is sought and must be  accompanied by an affidavit of fault attesting to the moving party’s mistake,  inadvertence, surprise, or neglect. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b); English  v. IKON Business Solutions (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 130, 143.) When relief  from default and a default judgment is based on an attorney affidavit of fault,  the six-month period starts to run from the date of the entry of the default  judgment. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, sub. (b); Sugasawara v. Newland  (1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 294, 295.)    II.        Discussion    As a preliminary matter the Court finds that the motion  is timely filed. CCP section 473(b) provides that an application for  relief must be made no more than six months after entry of the order from which  it was sought. (Code Civ. Proc.,  §473(b).) Here, the Court ordered dismissal of the matter on October 23,  2023. (10/23/2023 Minute Order.) Plaintiff filed the instant motion on February  13, 2024, well within the six-month deadline. Thus, the motion is timely filed.     Plaintiff provides the Court with its  counsel’s declaration, in which he states that due to a calendaring error, Plaintiff  did not appear at the October 23 trial. (Brian P. Tapper Decl. ¶ 3.) Counsel  further avers that if he had appeared, he would have notified the Court of the  settlement reached by the parties so that Plaintiff can dismiss the case with  the Court retaining jurisdiction under CCP § 664.6. (Id. ¶¶ 3-4.)  Plaintiff therefore prays for the Court to vacate the dismissal so that  Plaintiff can properly seek a dismissal pursuant to CCP § 664.6. (Id. ¶  4.) Thus, based on Counsel’s declaration the Court finds that the error was  caused by Plaintiff’s counsel’s mistake,  inadvertence, or excusable neglect and therefore entitles Plaintiff to  mandatory relief under Section 473(b).                Accordingly,  the Court GRANTS Plaintiff Interinsurance Exchange of Automobile Club’s Motion  to Vacate the Dismissal. Dismissal entered on October 23, 2023, is hereby  vacated.    III.       Conclusion                            Plaintiff  Interinsurance Exchange of the Automobile Club’s Motion Vacate the Dismissal Entered  on 10/23/2023 and to Restore Action to the Civil Case Active List is  GRANTED.     The Dismissal entered on 10/23/2023 is set aside and  vacated.               The Court  sets an OSC Re Dismissal/Settlement (CCP 664.6) for November 5, 2024 at 9:30am in  Department 25 of  the Spring Street  Courthouse.                 Moving Party is ordered to give notice.
