```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied the defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings as to the complaint. The defendant, Movement Mortgage, LLC, had argued that the plaintiff, Brittany Lattimore, had not adequately pled each of the elements of her claims for intentional misrepresentation, fraud/concealment, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and unfair competition. However, the court found that the plaintiff had adequately pled each of the elements of these claims, and therefore denied the motion.

The court's ruling was based on the pleadings, which included the complaint and the defendant's answer. The court found that the plaintiff had pled sufficient facts to support each of her claims, and that the defendant had not demonstrated a lack of evidence to support the claims.

The court's decision is tentative, meaning that it is subject to change after further briefing and argument at the hearing on May 14, 2024.
