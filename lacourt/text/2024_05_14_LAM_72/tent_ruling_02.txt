Petitioner Daisy Marilynn Gonzalez (“Petitioner”) seeks
approval of the compromises of Plaintiffs Vincent Armijo (“Vincent”); Amerie
Marlene Armijo (“Amerie”); Benjamin Armijo (“Benjamin”) and Jaylin Hayes Salas
(“Jaylin”) (collectively, the “Minor Plaintiffs”) (collectively with Petitioner,

disrespect to the parties).
 
The Court GRANTS the applications for approval of the
settlements.
 
Background
 
            This
is a landlord-tenant case. Plaintiffs lived at 12919 Cordary Avenue, Hawthorne,
California 90250 (the “Property”), a single family home. Petitioner is the
mother of the Minor Plaintiffs. Defendants LAN, L.P. (“LAN”), R.E.C.
Development, Inc. (“REC”), Zaffar Hassanally, and Ayla Lucas (collectively,
“Defendants”) are the current owners and managers of the Property.
 
            Plaintiffs
allege a number of defects in the Property that Defendants failed to fix,
including chronic cockroach infestations, leaks, mold growths, and termite
infestations.
 
            Plaintiffs
filed this action on April 18, 2023. The operative complaint is now the Second
Amended Complaint, which raises claims for (1) breach of implied warranty of
habitability; (2) tortious breach of implied warranty of habitability; (3)
negligence; (4) intentional infliction of emotional distress; (5) private
nuisance; (6) violation of Civil Code, section 1942.4; (7) violation of
Business and Professions Code, section 17200; (8) violation of the Los Angeles
Tenant Anti-Harassment Ordinance; and (9) constructive eviction.
 
Legal Standard
 
Pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure section 372,
any settlement of a claim made by a minor or adult with a disability must be
approved by the court. If the court is satisfied that the settlement is in
the best interest of the claimant, then the court shall approve the
settlement. (See Pearson v. Superior Court (2012) 202 Cal.App.4th
1333, 1338.)   
 
A petition for court approval of a compromise or covenant
not to sue under Code of Civil Procedure section 372 must comply with
California Rules of Court, Rules 7.950, 7.951, and 7.952. The petition must be
verified by the petitioner and contain a full disclosure of all information
that has “any bearing upon the reasonableness” of the compromise or the
covenant. (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 7.950.)  The person compromising
the claim on behalf of the minor or person who lacks capacity, and the
represented person, must attend the hearing on compromise of the claim unless
the court for good cause dispenses with their personal appearance. (Cal. Rules
of Court, Rule 7.952.)   
 
Discussion
 
            No
party objects to the settlement here.
 
The parties engaged in discovery in this case, including
form interrogatories, special interrogatories, requests for admission, and
requests for production. Plaintiffs subpoenaed records from the Los Angeles
County Department of Public Health, the City of Hawthorne Department of
Building Safety, and multiple private companies. Plaintiffs hired an
entomologist to investigate the defects at the Property. Staff for Plaintiffs’
counsel also visited the property on numerous occasions to meet with Plaintiffs
and take photos of the site.
 
 
The gross settlement value is $1,000,000.00. Each of the
Minor Plaintiffs will receive a gross payment of $80,199.26. Petitioner will
receive a gross payment of $679,202.98.
 
Plaintiffs’ total attorney’s fees are $383,960.15. The
retainer agreement provides that the Minor Plaintiffs will be charged a 35%
contingency fee (increasing to 40% 60 days prior to trial) and that Petitioner
will be charged a 40% contingency fee (increasing to 45% 60 days prior to
trial). Each Minor Plaintiff will pay $28,069.74 in attorney’s fees out of
their gross settlement payment. Petitioner will pay $271,681.19 out of her
gross settlement payment. The Court finds these amounts to be reasonable under
the facts of this case.
 
Plaintiffs’ counsel has advanced costs. The retainer
agreement provides that Plaintiffs will pay for costs of litigation, assessed
pro rata. Each of the Minor Plaintiffs will pay $1,123.63 in costs out of their
gross settlement. Petitioner will pay $9,515.93 in costs.
 
The settlement is not intended to reimburse medical expenses
by any of the Minor Plaintiffs. The Minor Plaintiffs suffered bug bites and
allergy-type effects that were treated by over-the-counter medication.
 
            Each
Minor Plaintiff will receive a net payment of $51,005.89.
 
            The
net payments to the Minor Plaintiffs will be deposited into an annuity account with
Metropolitan Tower Insurance Company that is inaccessible to the Minor
Plaintiffs or their parents. Vincent and Amerie will receive payments at the
ages of 21 and 25. Benjamin and Jaylin will receive payments at 18, 21, and 25.
 
            Given
the evidence, the Court finds that the settlement is in the best interest of
the Minor Plaintiffs. The Court grants the applications for approval of the
settlements.
