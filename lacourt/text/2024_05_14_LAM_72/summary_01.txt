Here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for judgment on the pleadings filed by Cross-Defendant Agnes Sinclair. The court grants the motion as to the fourth cause of action for defamation, finding that Cross-Complainant Kelly Ann Greenfield has adequately alleged facts supporting her claim of defamation. The court denies the remaining portions of the motion. The ruling does not address the merits of the underlying claims, but rather determines that the pleadings are sufficient to state a cause of action. The court notes that the presentation of extrinsic evidence is improper on a motion for judgment on the pleadings.
