English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling on a motion for summary judgment filed by the defendant, Vickey Gonzalez, in a case brought by the plaintiff, Hurricane Holdings, LLC, alleging trespass. The defendant argues that the plaintiff cannot establish the lack of permission element of trespass because Gonzalez moved into unit 4 with her family in 1996 with permission from the former landlord under an oral lease agreement. The court finds that the defendant has met its burden to show that the plaintiff cannot establish lack of permission, and the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show that a triable issue of material fact exists. The plaintiff, however, has failed to provide sufficient evidence to meet this burden, and the court grants the defendant's motion for summary judgment.
