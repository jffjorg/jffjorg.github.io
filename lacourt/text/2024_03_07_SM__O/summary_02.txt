And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motions to compel responses to discovery requests filed by the defendant, Michael Pierattini. The judge grants the motion to compel responses to form interrogatories and requests for sanctions. The plaintiff, Jose DeCastro, is ordered to serve the responses, without objections, and pay monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,635 within 30 days of service of the order. The judge also orders the parties to meet and confer regarding the necessity of serving more than 30 "contention" requests for admissions and 30 "contention" special interrogatories, as many of these requests are deemed duplicative or unnecessary. The judge is concerned that the excessive number of requests may be inconsistent with the purpose of discovery and may lead to unnecessary delays and costs. The judge continues the hearing on Pierattini's motions to compel further responses to the requests for admission, special interrogatories, and production of documents, and to compel DeCastro's deposition to May 2, 2024.
