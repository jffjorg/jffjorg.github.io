TENTATIVE
RULING
            Pro Se Defendants
Linda Mayne and Stephen Mayne’s Motion to Dismiss for Plaintiff Robert G. Furst’s
lack of standing is DENIED. Plaintiff Robert G. Furst has standing to bring an
elder abuse claim under Welf. & Inst. Code, § 15657.3(d)(2) as an
interested party. 
            
            “[W]hen a
demurrer or pretrial motion to dismiss challenges a complaint on standing
grounds, the court may not simply assume the allegations supporting standing
lack merit and dismiss the complaint. Instead, the court must first determine
standing by treating the properly pled allegations as true. If, having taken
the allegations as true, the court finds no standing, it should sustain the
demurrer or dismiss the petition. If it finds standing by contrast, the court
should allow the litigation to continue.” (Barefoot v. Jennings (2020) 8
Cal.5th 822, 827.)
 
The elements of
a cause of action for financial elder abuse are
(1) the defendant took, hid, appropriated, obtained or retained plaintiff's
property; (2) plaintiff is at least 65 years of age or a dependent adult; (3)
the defendant took, hid, appropriated, obtained or retained plaintiff's
property for a wrongful use, with the intent to defraud, or by undue influence;
(4) the plaintiff was harmed; and (5) the defendant's conduct was a substantial
factor in causing plaintiff's harm. (See CACI No. 3100.)
 
            “Any ‘interested person, as defined in Section 48 of the
Probate Code’ [citations], has standing to bring a financial elder abuse
action. The phrase “interested person,” as used in section 15657.3 of the Elder
Abuse Act, includes ‘[a]n heir, devisee, child, spouse, creditor, beneficiary,
and any other person having a property right in or claim against a trust estate
or the estate of a decedent which may be affected by the proceeding.’”. (Royals
v. Lu (2022) 81 Cal.App.5th 328, 353, citing Welf. & Inst. Code, §
15657.3, subd. (d), Prob. Code, § 48, subd. (a)(1).)
 
            “[W]hen the trustee of an elder's trust or the executor
of an elder's estate is herself accused of financial elder abuse, the Elder
Abuse Act expressly grants to a third party with an interest in the claim
standing to pursue it instead of the conflicted fiduciary. (Royals, supra,
81 Cal.App.5th at p. 353; Welf. & Inst. Code, § 15657.3, subd. (d)(2).)
 
            “Evidence Code section 459 specifically provides that a
reviewing court may take judicial notice of the matters provided for in
Evidence Code section 452 where the matters have not been previously noticed if
the matter sought to be judicially noticed ‘is of substantial consequence to
the determination of the action.” (People v. Terry (1974) 38 Cal.App.3d
432, 439.)
 
            Defendants Linda and Stephen Mayne (“Mayne Defendants”) move
to dismiss the FAC filed by Plaintiff Robert G. Furst (“Robert”), individually
and as successor in interest for Hanna Furst (“Decedent”), for lack of standing.
(Motion, pp. 1–3.) The Mayne Defendants argue that Robert is not the real party
in interest under CCP § 367, Robert cannot bring this claim on a behalf of an
abused elder under Welfare & Institutions Code § 15657.3, and that the California
probate court barred Robert from litigating on behalf of his Decedent mother without
obtaining court authorization on 11-30-21. 
 
            Robert pleads that he is the son of the Decedent, and
thus Robert is an interested person under Probate Code § 48. An Interested
person has standing to bring a Financial Elder Abuse claim under Welf. &
Inst. Code, § 15657.3(d(2) (See Welf. & Inst. Code, § 15657.3, subd. (d)(2),
Prob. Code, § 48, subd. (a)(1).) Furthermore, the Court is not satisfied the
order in the probate case in 11-30-21 Case No. 20STPB03901 bars this action. 
 
            Thus, The Mayne Defendants Motion to Dismiss for lack of
standing is DENIED.
