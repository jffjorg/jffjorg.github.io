 Case Number:  23SMCV00538    Hearing Date:   March 7, 2024    Dept:  O   Case  Name:  DeCastro v. Peter, et al.    Case No.:   23SMCV00538   Complaint Filed:   2-6-23      Hearing Date:   2-20-24   Discovery C/O:   1-27-25     Calendar No.:   6   Discovery Motion C/O:   2-10-25     POS:   OK    Trial Date:   2-24-25    SUBJECT:                 MOTION TO COMPEL RESPONSES AND  FURTHER RESPONSES TO DISCOVERY  MOVING  PARTY:   Defendant Michael Perattini RESP.  PARTY:         Plaintiff Jose DeCastro   TENTATIVE  RULING  Defendant Michael       Pierattini’s motion to compel responses to form interrogatories and       request for sanctions is granted.  Plaintiff José DeCastro's is ordered       to serve the responses, without objections, and pay monetary sanctions in       the amount of $1,635 within 30 days of service of the order. Pierattini is ordered to submit the proposed order in accordance with CRC       Rule 3.1312. The Court orders the       parties to meet and confer regarding the necessity of serving more than 30       “contention” requests for admissions and 30 “contention” special       interrogatories.  It appears that many       of 187 special interrogatories are duplicative of each other and seek the information       sought by the form interrogatories.  Likewise, the purpose of       requests for admissions is to narrow discovery by eliminating undisputed       issues.  The Court's concerned that the 76 request for admissions       that essentially ask DeCastro to admit his case has no merit is       inconsistent with that purpose.        Likewise, when coupled with form interrogatory 17.1, they become       duplicative of much of the information to be disclosed in response to the       remaining form interrogatories. Therefore, in lieu of ordering DeCastro to       serve further responses to more than 30 requests for admission and 30       special interrogatories the Court is inclined to order DeCastro to serve a       verified response that identifies the “initial disclosures” that are       required to be disclosed under Code of Civil Procedure section 2016.090       for cases filed after January 1, 2024. Similarly, Pierattini’s request for       production of documents that are linked to the special interrogatories       that exceed 30 may be excessive and rendered moot by DeCastro complying       with CCP 2016.090 subd (a) (1)(b) and responding to the form interrogatories.   Regarding Pierattini’s       motion to compel Decastro’s appearance at his deposition, DeCastro is       ordered to file a notice of change of address that discloses his purported       out of state residence, not just mailing address, within 10 days. DeCastro       may seek to file that notice with his residence address redacted from the       public filing by making the appropriate motion to seal that notice under       California rules of Court 2.551.   The hearing on Pierattini’s       motions to compel further responses to the requests for admission, special       interrogatories and production of documents, and to compel DeCastro's deposition are continued to May 2, 2024 at       8:30.
