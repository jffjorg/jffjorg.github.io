SUBJECT:                 MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
MOVING
PARTY:   Defendant Vickey Gonzalez
RESP.
PARTY:         Plaintiff Hurricane
Holdings, LLC
 
TENTATIVE
RULING
            Defendant Vickey Gonzalez’s Motion for Summary Judgment
as to Plaintiff Hurricane Holdings, LLC’s claim for trespass is GRANTED.  
 
            Gonzalez’s objection nos. 1,2 and 3 to the declaration of
Richman Bry are SUSTAINED, and objection nos 4,5,6,7 and 8 to the declaration
of Daniel Palo are SUSTAINED.  
 
Hurricane
Holdings did not file any objections to evidence in compliance with CRC Rule
3.1354 subd. (b). (“All written objections to evidence must be served and filed
separately from the other papers in support of or in opposition to the
motion.”) Because the incomplete objections stated in Hurricane Holdings
response to Gonzalez’s separate statement do not comply with Rule 3.1354, they
are overruled. (See e.g. Santos v. Crenshaw Manufacturing, Inc. (2020)
55 Cal.App.5th 39, 53 as modified (Sept. 25, 2020.)).
 
REASONING
Where
a defendant seeks summary judgment or adjudication, they must show either “one
or more elements of the cause of action, even if not separately pleaded, cannot
be established, or that there is a complete defense to that cause of action.”
(Code of Civil Procedure §437c(o)(2).) A defendant may satisfy this burden by
showing that the claim “cannot be established” because of the lack of evidence
on some essential element of the claim. (Union Bank v. Superior Court (1995)
31 Cal.App.4th 574, 590.) Once the defendant meets this burden, the burden
shifts to plaintiff to show that a “triable issue of one or more material facts
exists as to that cause of action or defense thereto.” (Ibid.) If unable
to prove the existence of a triable issue of material fact, summary judgment or
summary adjudication in favor of the defendant is proper. (Ibid.)
 
            Trespass is the “unlawful interference with possession of
property.” (Ralphs Grocery Co. v. Victory Consultants, Inc. (2017) 17
Cal.App.4th 245, 261.) “The elements of trespass are: (1) the plaintiff’s
ownership or control of the property; (2) the defendant’s intentional,
reckless, or negligent entry onto the property; (3) lack of permission for the
entry or acts in excess of permission; (4) harm; and (5) the defendant’s
conduct was a substantial factor in causing the harm.” (See id. at p.
262, citing CACI No. 2000.)
 
I.         Defendants Burden
 
            Defendant Vickey Gonzalez (“Gonzalez”) moves for summary
judgment of the trespass claim within Plaintiff Hurricane Holdings, LLC
(“Hurricane Holdings”) FAC arguing Hurricane Holdings cannot establish the “lack
of permission” element of trespass. Gonzales provides evidence that Hurricane
Holdings cannot establish Gonzales lacked permission to enter the unit 4, the
unit at issue, because Gonzalez moved into unit 4 with her family in 1996 with
the permission of the former landlord under an oral lease agreement, Gonzales and
other family members continue to live in unit 4, and this “permission is not
extinguished by the sale of the building to Hurricane Holdings,” and (MSJ, p.
5; SSMF Nos. 1–6, Victoria Gonzalez Decl., ¶¶ 2, 3, 4,6, 8, Jesus Gonzales Decl.,
¶¶ 2, 3, 4, 5.)
 
            “After a property is sold or transferred, the transferee
takes subject to the existing lease; this new owner steps into the landlord's
shoes and becomes the successor landlord, assuming the terms and conditions of
the lease the tenant had with the prior owner.” (DLI Properties LLC v. Hill
(2018) 29 Cal.App.5th Supp. 1.)  Furthermore,
“[t]enancies in property need not be created by written leases,” because a
person “may become a tenant by occupancy with consent.” (Mosser Companies v.
San Francisco Rent Stabilization & Arbitration Bd. (2015) 233
Cal.App.4th 505, 516.) “A tenant who enters a rent-stabilized apartment as a
minor with her parents and remains there after her parents vacate is an
“original lawful occupant of the apartment” entitled to the same eviction
protections as her parents. (Id. at p. 515.).
 
            Gonzales meets her burden of establishing that Plaintiff
cannot establish Gonzales lacked permission to enter the unit.  The burden shifts to the Plaintiff.  
 
II.        Plaintiff’s Burden
 
            When the burden shifts to the Plaintiff, “[i]t is not
enough to produce just some evidence. The evidence must be of sufficient
quality to allow the trier of fact to find the underlying fact in favor of the
party opposing the motion for summary judgment.” (McGonnell v. Kaiser Gypsum
Co., Inc. (2002) 98 Cal.App.4th 1098, 1105.) “The opposing party may
rely upon inferences, but “those inferences must be reasonably deducible from
the evidence, and not such as are derived from speculation, conjecture,
imagination, or guesswork. (Joshi v. Fitness International, LLC (2022)
80 Cal.App.5th 814, 823.)  Hurricane
Holdings disputes Gonzalez’s statements of material fact numbers 5, 8, and 9,
but does not provide any evidence to dispute these statements. (See SSUMF Nos.
5, 8, 9.)  Regardless, Hurricane Holdings
objections lack merit. In particular, the hearsay objection to the 2014 rent
notices lacks merit because those documents are not offered not to show the
truth of the stated amount of rent, but rather, to show the owner and manager
of the building considered Gonzales a tenant of Unit 4. 
  
Hurricane
Holdings provides two estoppel certificates for both units 2 and 4 allegedly signed
by Gonzales to show that Gonzalez left Unit 4 and only remained in Unit 2. (See
Oppo., p. 6; see also SSUMF Nos 108–110; Palo Decl., Exh. A, B.) However, the
provided certificates only contain a signature from building manager, Daniel
Palo, and not the purported signature of Gonzalez. (See SSUMF Nos 108–110; Palo
Decl., Exh. A, B.) An unsigned estoppel certificate does not carry any legal
effect. (See Plaza Freeway Ltd. Partnership v. First Mountain Bank (2000)
81 Cal.App.4th 616, 626 [“Black's Law Dictionary defines estoppel certificate”
as “[a] signed statement by a party, such as a tenant or a mortgagee, certifying
for the benefit of another party that a certain statement of facts is correct
as of the date of the statement, such as that a lease exists, that there are no
defaults and that rent is paid to a certain date.”] Unsigned estoppel
certificates and no explanation, or other evidence, of disputed material fact is
not adequate evidence to find in favor of Hurricane Holdings.
 
            The Court finds that Hurricane Holdings has not met its burden
to provide evidence of a triable issue of material fact regarding the lack of
consent to Gonzalez’s entry into unit Unit 4.
