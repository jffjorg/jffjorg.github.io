And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Visionary Construction Management Partnership Co.'s motion for leave to file a cross-complaint against Roe Defendants 1-100 and additional defendants identified in the proposed cross-complaint. The cross-complaint alleges causes of action for equitable indemnity, comparative indemnity, contribution, and declaratory relief. The judge finds that Visionary acted in bad faith in presenting this cross-action, which was not timely brought and was intended to delay trial. The judge notes that Visionary could have brought an independent action for indemnity against the subcontractors at any time, but instead waited until two months prior to trial to file the motion. The judge rules that the motion is denied.
