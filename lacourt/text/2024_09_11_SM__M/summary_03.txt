Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion filed by Plaintiffs Kelly Li, Wet Paws Media, Inc., and Lid Global, Inc. to vacate their voluntary dismissal and enter the stipulated judgments against Defendant Afterward Productions, LLC. The Plaintiffs sought to demonstrate that the defendant is in default under the settlement agreement, which requires payment by May 8, 2024. However, the Plaintiffs failed to provide a copy of the settlement agreement, and the judge determined that there is an inadequate foundation to demonstrate the defendant's default.

The judge also considered the parties' request to retain jurisdiction over the matter, which was made prior to the voluntary dismissal. The judge concluded that the court has jurisdiction under California Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6 to enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement.

The motion is denied without prejudice, and the judge will consider the settlement agreement if it is filed prior to the hearing.
