The judge has issued a tentative ruling on two motions filed by the plaintiff against NextStar Media Group. The first motion is to compel the defendant to provide further responses to special interrogatories, specifically Request #77, #78, and #79. The judge grants Request #79, which asks for information about the responsive actions the defendant took when learning that an employee, Deborah Wilkinson, performed freelance work while employed. The judge denies Requests #77 and #78.

The second motion is to compel the defendant to provide further responses to requests for production of documents, specifically Requests #59, #60, #63, and #64. The judge grants Requests #60, #63, and #64, which ask for information about the responsive actions the defendant took and the documents related to them. The judge denies Requests #59.

The plaintiff also requested an order imposing monetary sanctions against the defendant, but the judge denies this request, finding that the defendant's position was substantially justified.

The judge orders the defendant to provide the requested information and further responses, and denies the request for monetary sanctions.
