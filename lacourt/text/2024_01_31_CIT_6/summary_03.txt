Summary in English:

The Court denies the motion for order to produce records related to the death of Deborah Nagle, filed by Patricia Nagle, the mother of the deceased, against Storm Haven, Inc. et al. The motion is denied without prejudice to Patricia Nagle serving another subpoena after the defendants have been served and the hold period expired. The Court finds that the interests of Patricia Nagle in investigating the facts surrounding her daughter's death outweigh any privacy interests that may have been protected by Welfare and Institutions Code section 4514. However, the Court also notes that the defendants have not been served with the Summons and Complaint, and therefore, Patricia Nagle cannot serve the deposition subpoena on the Regional Center. The Court takes judicial notice of its own records and finds that no proofs of service have been filed with the Court.
