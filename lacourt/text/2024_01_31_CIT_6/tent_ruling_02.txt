BACKGROUND
This
is a business dispute. On March 13, 2023, Plaintiffs Bin Xu (Xu), individually
and derivatively on behalf of X-Planet LLC, and Shenzhen Famo Technology Co.,
Ltd (Famo) (collectively, Plaintiffs) filed this action against Defendants TMD
Shops LLC (TMD), Yuan Zhou (Zhou), Xiaoyu Li (Li) (collectively, Moving Parties),
X-Planet LLC (X-Planet), and Does 1 through 25. On November 9, 2023, the
operative First Amended Complaint (FAC) was filed, alleging causes of action
for misappropriation of funds and embezzlement (derivative), breach of
fiduciary duties (direct), breach of fiduciary duties (derivative), member’s
right of inspection & accounting (direct), fraud – intentional
misrepresentations (direct), fraud – negligent misrepresentations (direct),
common law trademark infringement, declaratory relief, accounting (derivative),
and breach of contract. 
On
December 12, 2023, Moving Parties filed the instant demurrer to the FAC. On January
18, 2024, Plaintiffs filed an opposition. On January 24, 2024 Moving Parties
replied. 
LEGAL
STANDARD
A
demurrer is a pleading used to test the legal sufficiency of other
pleadings. It raises issues of law, not fact, regarding the form or
content of the opposing party's pleading (complaint, answer or
cross-complaint). (Code Civ. Proc., § 422.10; see Donabedian v.
Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) It is not the function
of the demurrer to challenge the truthfulness of the complaint; and for
purposes of ruling on the demurrer, all facts pleaded in the complaint are
assumed to be true. (Id.)  
A
demurrer can be used only to challenge defects that appear on the face of the
pleading under attack; or from matters outside the pleading that are judicially
noticeable. (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318; Donabedian,
supra, 116 Cal.App.4th at p. 994.) No other extrinsic evidence can be
considered. (Ion Equip. Corp. v. Nelson (1980) 110 Cal.App.3d 868,
881 [error for court to consider facts asserted in memorandum supporting
demurrer]; see also Afuso v. United States Fid. & Guar. Co. (1985) 169 Cal.App.3d 859, 862, disapproved on other grounds in Moradi-Shalal
v. Fireman’s Fund Ins. Cos. (1988) 46 Cal.3d 287 [error to consider
contents of release not part of court record].)  
A
demurrer can be utilized where the “face of the complaint” itself is incomplete
or discloses some defense that would bar recovery. (Guardian North Bay, Inc.
v. Superior Court (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 963, 971-972.) The “face of
the complaint” includes material contained in attached exhibits that are
incorporated by reference into the complaint, or in a superseded complaint in the same action. (Frantz v.
Blackwell (1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 91, 94; see also Barnett v. Fireman’s
Fund Ins. Co. (2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 500, 505 [“[W]e rely on and accept as true the contents of the exhibits and treat as
surplusage the pleader’s allegations as to the legal effect of the exhibits.”])  
A
demurrer can only be sustained when it disposes of an entire cause of action. (Poizner
v. Fremont General Corp. (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97, 119; Kong v. City of
Hawaiian Gardens Redev. Agency (2003) 108
Cal.App.4th 1028, 1046.)   
DISCUSSION
Meet
and Confer
Per Code of Civil Procedure section
430.41, subdivision (a), Moving Parties were required to meet and confer before
bringing this demurrer. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a).) The Court finds
Moving Parties’ efforts to meet and confer to be sufficient. (Goerlinger Decl.,
¶ 2.)           
First Cause of Action – Misappropriation
of Funds and Embezzlement
“The nature and character of a pleading is to be
determined from the facts alleged, not the name
given by the pleader to the cause
of action.
[Citation.]” (Ananda Church of Self-Realization v. Massachusetts Bay Ins. Co.
(2002) 95 Cal.App.4th 1273, 1281, italics in original.) Embezzlement is a
criminal act, not a civil one. (See Pen. Code § 503.) A claim for conversion
requires pleading “‘(a) plaintiff's ownership or
right to possession of personal property, (b) defendant's disposition
of property in a manner inconsistent with plaintiff's property rights, and
(c) resulting damages.’” (Foster v. Sexton (2021) 61 Cal.App.5th 998,
1020-1021.) A conversion claim for money must specify a specific sum at issue.
(Haigler v. Donnelly (1941) 18 Cal.2d 674, 681.) 
Moving Parties contend the First Cause of Action for
misappropriation of funds and embezzlement fails to state a cause of action
because embezzlement is not a civil cause of action under California law. They
contend the First Cause of Action is really just a reiteration of Plaintiff’s
prior claim for conversion only with a different label this time around. The
Court agrees. 
Embezzlement is not a civil cause of action in
California. (See Pen. Code § 503; Mohebbi v. Khazaen (N.D. Cal. 2014) 50
F.Supp.3d 1234, 1257.) The civil equivalent of embezzlement is conversion. (See
Ferrick v. Santa Clara University (2014) 231 Cal.App.4th 1337, 1347, brackets
in original [“Embezzlement requires conversion of trusted funds [or property]
coupled with intent to defraud…”]) Thus, the Court construes Plaintiff’s First
Cause of Action as one for conversion. (See Ananda, supra, 95
Cal.App.4th 1273, 1281.) 
The Court again finds the FAC fails to allege
sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action for conversion. As stated
previously, a generalized claim for money is not a proper subject for
conversion. (See Voris v. Lampert (2019) 7 Cal.5th 1141, 1150.) “’[M]oney
cannot be the subject of an action for conversion unless a specific sum capable
of identification is involved.’ [Citations.] ‘[W]here the money or fund is not
identified as a specific thing the action is to be considered as one upon
contract or for debt’—or perhaps upon some other appropriate theory—but ‘not
for conversion.’” (Id. at p. 1151.) “’[A] cause of action for conversion
of money can be stated only where a defendant interferes with the plaintiff's possessory interest
in a specific, identifiable sum’; ‘the simple failure to pay money owed does
not constitute conversion.’” (Id., italics in original.) Here, Plaintiff
Xu’s incorporated specific sum of money allegations are nothing more than a
failure to pay money owed for goods sold. (See, e.g., FAC, ¶¶ 23, 45-46.) 
Moreover, the “at least $8,048,960.40” Plaintiff Xu
complains of is based on the allegation that X-Planet would earn that as
revenue if it sold all of the products received from FAMO. (FAC, ¶ 46.)
However, until that money materializes, this allegation is purely speculative. “[I]t
is fundamental that ‘damages which are speculative,
remote, imaginary,
contingent, or merely possible cannot serve as a legal basis
for recovery.’ ” (Regalado v. Callaghan
(2016) 3 Cal.App.5th 582, 602.) It is impossible for unearned money to be in anyone’s
possession or to be a specific identifiable sum for purposes of conversion. 
Further, Plaintiff Xu still alleges that X-Planet has
not paid FAMO $2,557,213.42 for products sold. (FAC, ¶ 23.) Based on these
allegations, the injured party would be FAMO, not X-Planet. However, FAMO is
not the party bringing the conversion claim here. Rather, Plaintiff Xu is
bringing this claim derivatively on behalf of X-Planet. 
Therefore, the Court SUSTAINS the demurrer as to the
First Cause of Action. The Court will allow Plaintiffs to make an offer of
proof to determine whether leave to amend should be granted here. 
Second Cause of Action – Breach of Fiduciary Duty
To plead a cause of action for breach of fiduciary
duty, the plaintiff must allege facts demonstrating the existence of a
fiduciary relationship, its breach, and damages caused by the breach. (Mendoza
v. Continental Sales Co. (2006) 140 Cal.App.4th 1395, 1405.) 
In a member-managed
LLC, each member
owes a duty of
loyalty and a duty of care to the LLC and to the other members.
[Corps.C. § 17704.09(a); see Sandy v. McClure (ND CA 2009) 676 F.Supp.2d 866, 883
(applying Calif. law); see also American Master Lease LLC v. Idanta Partners, Ltd.
(2014) 225 CA4th 1451, 1480, 171 CR3d 548, 571 & fns. 18 & 19 (decided
under prior law)] 
In a manager-managed
LLC, each manager
owes a duty of
loyalty and a duty of care to the LLC and the members. Members who are not managers are
relieved of the duties of loyalty and care. [Corps.C. § 17704.09(f)(1), (3);
see Feresi
v. The Livery, LLC (2015) 232 CA4th 419, 425-426, 182 CR3d 169, 174
(decided under prior law)]” 
(D. Management, Cal. Prac.
Guide Pass--Through Entities Ch. 6-D, italics in original.) 
            Moving Parties contend the
Complaint fails to state a cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty on the
grounds that the alleged injury constitutes an injury to the company itself,
citing PacLink Commc’ns Int’l., Inc. v. Superior Court. (2001) 90
Cal.App.4th 958. Moving Parties contend the gravamen of the FAC is harms
against X-Planet, not Plaintiff Xu. The Court agrees. 
            “Because
members of the LLC hold no direct ownership interest in the company's assets
[citation], the members cannot be directly injured when the company is
improperly deprived of those assets.” (PacLink Commc'ns Int'l, Inc., supra, 90 Cal.App.4th at p. 964.) “It is a general
rule that a corporation which suffers damages through wrongdoing by its
officers and directors must itself bring the action to recover the losses
thereby occasioned, or if the corporation fails to bring an action, suit may be
filed by a stockholder acting derivatively on behalf of the corporation. An
individual [stockholder] may not maintain an action in his own right ... for
destruction of or diminution in the value of the stock.... [Citation.]” (Id.
at p. 965, ellipses in original and internal quotation marks omitted.) 
The Court agrees that Plaintiff Xu only alleges harm
to X-Planet but still fails to allege facts showing damages to Xu personally. The
allegations here are largely the same as before, alleging that Xu was deprived
of the right to inspect the company’s books and records regarding distributions
he would supposedly receive. (FAC, ¶ 55.) The FAC also again makes conclusory
allegations of conversion of X-Planet’s assets and alleges that the formation
of TMD as a competing business to X-Planet resulted in diminution of X-Planet’s
distributions to Xu. (FAC, ¶ 55.) The Court finds these allegations to
demonstrate an injury to X-Planet itself. Any diminution in the value of
Plaintiff Xu’s interest would be incidental and not a basis for an individual
claim by Plaintiff Xu. (See PacLink Commc'ns Int'l, Inc., supra, 90 Cal.App.4th at pp. 964-965; "'An
individual may not maintain an action in his own right against the directors
for destruction of or diminution in the value of the stock. . . .'" (Rankin
v. Frebank Co. (1975) 47 Cal.App.3d 75, 95.) 
Additionally, it is unclear how Defendant Zhou’s alleged refusal
to allow Plaintiff Xu to inspect X-Planet’s books and records caused injury to
Plaintiff Xu for purposes of a breach of fiduciary duty claim. At most,
Plaintiff Xu alleges that it deprived him of the possibility of learning what
distributions he might have received. This is speculative. (Regalado, supra, 3
Cal.App.5th at p. 602 [speculative damages are no basis for legal
recovery].) 
Based on the foregoing, the Court SUSTAINS the
demurrer as to the Second Cause of Action. The Court will allow Plaintiffs to
make an offer of proof to determine whether leave to amend should be granted
here. 
CONCLUSION
The Court
SUSTAINS the demurrer to the First and Second Causes of Action. The Court will
allow Plaintiffs to make an offer of proof to determine whether leave to amend
should be granted here. 
Moving
Parties are ordered to give notice of the Court’s ruling within five days of
this order.
