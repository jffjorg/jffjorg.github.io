And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the demurrer to the First Amended Complaint filed by the defendants and has found that the complaint fails to state a valid cause of action for the claims made. Specifically, the court has sustained the demurrer to the First Cause of Action for misappropriation of funds and embezzlement, finding that the complaint does not adequately plead a cause of action for conversion. The court has also sustained the demurrer to the Second Cause of Action for breach of fiduciary duty, finding that the complaint does not adequately plead a cause of action and that the alleged injury is to the company itself, not to the plaintiff.

The court has allowed the plaintiffs to make an offer of proof to determine whether leave to amend should be granted, and has ordered the defendants to give notice of the court's ruling within five days.
