Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied a motion to be relieved as counsel for plaintiff Bi Yueh Chou, filed by Michael I. Kim of CKB Vienna LLP. The motion is denied without prejudice, meaning it can be refiled. The judge requires counsel to serve notice of this ruling and file proof of service within five calendar days. The reasons for the denial are that counsel's efforts to confirm the plaintiff's current address or last known address were insufficient, and the proposed order did not contain the current pending hearing dates. The judge will hear from plaintiff's counsel regarding these issues.
