And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge, Hon. Lee S. Arian, has issued a tentative ruling on Defendant's motion to compel Empire Radiology, LLC to comply with a subpoena. The Defendant seeks to compel Empire to produce business records, but the Plaintiff objects, citing overbreadth and invasion of privacy. The Court finds that the Defendant's efforts to meet and confer with the Plaintiff were insufficient, as they did not engage in direct dialogue and discussion, but instead relied solely on email communication. Therefore, the Court denies the Defendant's motion to compel without prejudice. The parties are advised to submit on this tentative ruling by email or appear remotely or in person for oral argument.
