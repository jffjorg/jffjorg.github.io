Background 
 
On
August 17, 2021, Plaintiff filed an auto accident case alleging various
injuries. On July 12, 2023, Plaintiff's discovery responses identified RADSTAR
STAND-UP MRI (“Radstar”) as a provider for her pre-accident injuries. On August
8, 2023, Defendant subpoenaed Radstar but was notified that Radstar had changed
its name to Empire Radiology, LLC (“Empire”). Consequently, on September 5,
2023, Defendant reissued his subpoena to Empire, with a compliance date set for
October 15, 2023. However, on September 27, 2023, Plaintiff's counsel objected
to Defendant's subpoena for business records from Empire, noting that the
request was overbroad and the requested information would disclose Plaintiff's
next of kin and their personal details. Plaintiff's counsel consented to comply
only if Defendant's counsel narrowed the subpoena scope solely to the films and
MRI records. On October 13, 2023, Defendant sent a meet and confer letter,
leading to an email exchange between the Parties. From October 16 to 17, the
Parties exchanged another pair of emails discussing the scope of the subpoena.
Defendant now moves the court to compel Empire to comply with Defendant's
subpoena. Plaintiff did not file an opposition.
 
Legal Standard¿and
Analysis 
¿  
CCP § 2025.480(a) provides that “[i]f a deponent fails to answer any question or
to produce any document, electronically stored information,¿or tangible thing under the deponent's control
that is specified in the deposition notice or a deposition subpoena, the party
seeking discovery may move the court for an order compelling that answer or
production.” CCP §
2025.480 includes a time limit. If a nonparty disobeys a deposition subpoena, the subpoenaing
party may seek a court order compelling the nonparty to comply with the
subpoena within¿60 days¿after completion of the¿deposition record. (CCP § 2025.480(b); Unzipped Apparel, LLC
v. Bader (2007) 156 CA4th 123, 127.) The deposition record is “complete”
either on the date documents are specified for production or on the date
objections are served. (Board of Registered Nursing v. Sup.Ct. (Johnson
& Johnson) (2021) 59 Cal. App. 5th 1011, 1032-1033.)¿  
 
 “The
motion shall set forth specific facts showing good cause justifying the
production for inspection of any document, electronically stored information,
or tangible thing described in the deposition notice.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
2025.450, subd. (b)(1).)  
 
Meet and Confer
 
“The
motion shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section
2016.040” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (b)(2).)    
 
“The Discovery Act requires
that, prior to the initiation of a motion to compel, the moving party declare
that he or she has made a serious attempt to obtain an informal resolution
of each issue.”  (Stewart v. Colonial Western
Agency, Inc. (2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 1006, 1016.) This rule is
designed “to encourage the parties to work out their differences informally so
as to avoid the necessity for a formal order....”  (McElhaney v. Cessna Aircraft
Co. (1982) 134 Cal.App.3d 285, 289.) “This, in turn, will
lessen the burden on the court and reduce the unnecessary expenditure of
resources by litigants through promotion of informal, extrajudicial resolution
of discovery disputes.” (Townsend v. Superior Court (1998) 61 Cal.App.4th 1431,
1435.)  “A determination of whether an attempt at informal
resolution is adequate . . . involves the exercise of discretion.” (Stewart (2001) 87
Cal.App.4th at 1016.)  “The history of the litigation, the nature of the
interaction between counsel, the nature of the issues, the type and scope of
discovery requested, the prospects for success and other similar factors can be
relevant.” (Id.)  
"Meet and confer" or "confer" means to
communicate directly and discuss in good faith the issue(s) required under the particular
Rule or order… such communication may take place by telephone. The mere sending
of a written, electronic, or voice-mail communication, however, does not
satisfy a requirement to "meet and confer" or to "confer."
Rather, this requirement can be satisfied only through direct dialogue and
discussion — either in a face-to-face meeting or in a telephone conversation. Phleger
v. Countrywide Home Loans, Inc., No. C 07-1686 SBA, 5 (N.D. Cal. Dec. 24,
2007)
 
The Court finds that Defendant’s efforts to meet and confer were insufficient.
On September 27, 2023, Plaintiff sent an objection to Defendant’s subpoena. On
October 13, 2023, Defendant sent a meet and confer letter, and the Parties had
one e-mail exchange regarding the letter and the subpoena. Another e-mail
exchange occurred from October 16 to 17, with the last e-mail from Plaintiff
asking Defendant for the legal basis for the scope of the subpoena. Defendant
did not respond to that e-mail or further engage in meet and confer efforts. The
meet and confer process appears incomplete, based on the evidence presented by
Defendant, especially the last email exchange between the parties.
A moving party must demonstrate a serious attempt
to meet and confer before filing a motion to compel. E-mail communication, while
convenient, can sometimes be unreliable – in this day and age of receiving a
barrage of e-mails on a daily basis, an email could be overlooked, or, even if
seen and opened, could be forgotten when sidelined by a more pressing matter.
Sufficient meet and confer requires either a phone call or a face-to-face
meeting.
 
Accordingly, Defendant’s motion to
compel is DENIED without prejudice.
