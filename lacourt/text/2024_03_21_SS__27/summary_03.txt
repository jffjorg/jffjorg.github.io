Martin, has moved to be relieved as counsel, citing a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship. The court has discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw, but the motion is procedurally defective due to lack of proof of service.

The parties are advised to submit their objections or agreements to the tentative ruling by email or appear remotely or in person for oral argument.
