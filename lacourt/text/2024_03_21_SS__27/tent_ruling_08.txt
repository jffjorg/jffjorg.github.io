RULING: 
 
PLAINTIFFS’ MARIA MENDOZA AND JASMIN
CASTRO JUAREZ MOTION TO COMPEL AND REQUEST FOR SANCTIONS IS GRANTED.
 
Background
 
On January 17, 2022, Plaintiff filed the
present auto accident case. On April 5, 2023, Plaintiff Jasmin Castro Juarez
and Plaintiff Maria Antonia Juarez Mendoza each served Form Interrogatories
(Set No. Two) on Defendant. On May 9, 2023, after not receiving a verified
response to these form interrogatories, Plaintiff's counsel sent a meet and
confer letter to Defendant's counsel, requiring that a verified response to
both Plaintiffs’ Form Interrogatories (Set No. Two) be received by May 15,
2023. However, no responses were received by May 15, 2023. Plaintiffs now move
the court to compel the discovery responses at issue. No opposition was filed.
 
Legal Standard 
 
A plaintiff may make a demand for
production of documents and propound interrogatories without leave of court at
any time 10 days after the service of the summons on, or appearance by, the
party to whom the demand is directed, whichever occurs first. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2031.020, subd. (b); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.020, subd. (b).) The demand for
production of documents is not limited by number, but the request must comply
with the formatting requirements in Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.030. A party
may propound 35 specially prepared interrogatories that are relevant to the
subject matter of the pending action and any additional number of official form
interrogatories that are relevant to the subject matter of the pending action.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.030, subd. (a)(1) - (a)(2).)¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿ 
The party whom the request is
propounded upon is required to respond within 30 days after service of a
demand, but the parties are allowed to informally agree to an extension and
confirm any such agreement in writing. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260, subd. (a);
Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.270, subd. (a)
- (b); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.270, subd. (a) - (b).)¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿ 
If a party fails to timely respond
to a request for production or interrogatories, the party to whom the request
is directed waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings under
Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.230, and waives any objection, including one based on
privilege or on the protection for work product. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300,
subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).)¿¿The party propounding the
discovery requests may move for an order compelling responses. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (b); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (b).) Unlike a motion to compel further discovery responses, a
motion to compel initial discovery responses does not have any meet and confer
requirements.¿¿ 
¿¿ 
Code of Civil Procedure section
2023.030, subdivision (a) provides, in pertinent part, that the court may
impose a monetary sanction on a party engaging in the misuse of the discovery
process to pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by
anyone as a result of that conduct. A misuse of the discovery process includes
failing to respond or submit to an authorized method of discovery. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (d).)¿¿¿A court has discretion to fix the amount of reasonable
monetary sanctions. (Cornerstone Realty Advisors, LLC v. Summit Healthcare
Reit, Inc. (2020) 56 Cal.App.5th 771, 791.)¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿¿¿ ¿ 
It is undisputed that Defendant
failed to provide timely responses. Defendant did not file an opposition
indicating that discovery responses were served before the hearing. Thus, the
present motions to compel are GRANTED.
 
Sanctions¿ ¿ 
 
Defendant's
failure to respond caused Plaintiff to incur attorney's fees in bringing the
present motion. Plaintiff requests sanctions in the amount of $1,560 per
motion. Taking into account the complexity (or, as the case is, non-complexity)
of the issue and the absence of an opposition, the Court exercises its
discretion and reduces the amount to $1,500 for both motions. Consequently,
Defendant and her counsel are ORDERED, jointly and severally, to pay sanctions
of $1,500 to Plaintiff within 20 days of today’s date.
