```

And here is the English-text summary:

The judge grants the motion to be relieved as counsel brought by Aaron Brown, the current counsel for Plaintiff Katherine Michelle Cea. The motion is based on the breakdown in the attorney-client relationship, making it impossible for Brown to continue representing Cea. The court finds this to be a proper ground for withdrawal, citing relevant case law and court rules. The next hearing is scheduled for May 8, 2024, which should be sufficient time for Cea to retain new counsel. If additional time is needed, Cea can seek a continuance of the trial. The motion is granted effective from the date of notice of the ruling.
