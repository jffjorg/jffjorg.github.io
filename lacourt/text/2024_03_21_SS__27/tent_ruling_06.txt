RULING:¿¿ 


GRANT



¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿ ¿¿¿¿ 
Defendant City of Los
Angeles is currently represented by Attorney Ethan Posey. Counsel initially
filed a motion to be relieved on 1/3/24, and the Court's minute order dated
2/6/24 for that motion indicates that Plaintiff's counsel stated a valid basis
for being relieved as counsel. However, due to certain defects in Form MC-051,
the Court continued the hearing, instructing Counsel to fix the defect. The
court examined the present motion, and finds that Counsel has corrected the
previously noted defects. Furthermore, no opposition was filed to the present
motion. Thus, the present motion is GRANTED, effective on the date of service
of Notice of this ruling is made on Defendant.
