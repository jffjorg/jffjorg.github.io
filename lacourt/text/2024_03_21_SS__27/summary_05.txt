And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants summary adjudication to Affirmative Defenses Nos. 2, 4-10, 12-15, but denies it to Affirmative Defenses Nos. 3 and 11. The ruling concludes that the plaintiff has failed to meet his initial burden concerning Affirmative Defense No. 11, which pertains to failing to yield to a car on a public street and walking on a public street way.

The ruling also grants summary adjudication to Affirmative Defense No. 13, which alleges that the plaintiff failed to mitigate his damages. The ruling concludes that the defendant's responses to the plaintiff's requests for admission and discovery responses were insufficient to support her allegations.

The judge's tentative ruling is subject to change based on any submissions or appearances at the hearing scheduled for March 21, 2024.
