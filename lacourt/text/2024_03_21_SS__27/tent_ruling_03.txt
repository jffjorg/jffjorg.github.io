¿¿ 
Background¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿ 
Plaintiff Daniell Alexander is
currently represented by Attorney Michael T. Martin. Plaintiff’s counsel moves to be
relieved as counsel, citing an irremediable breakdown in the attorney-client
relationship and/or communication, which rendered it unreasonably difficult, if
not impossible, for Plaintiff's counsel to continue representing Plaintiff No
opposition has been filed.¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿ 
Legal Standard¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿ 
The Court has discretion to allow
an attorney to withdraw, and such a motion should be granted provided that
there is no prejudice to the client and it does not disrupt the orderly process
of justice. (See Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915; People
v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398, 403-407.)¿¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿ 
A motion to be relieved as counsel
must be made on Judicial Council Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion),
MC-052 (Declaration), and MC-053 (Proposed Order). (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362, subds. (a), (c), (e).) The requisite forms must be served “on the
client and on all parties that have appeared in the case.” (Cal. Rules of
Court, Rule 3.1362, subd. (d).)¿¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿ 
Analysis and Conclusion¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿ 
Counsel seeks to be relieved as
counsel for Plaintiff on the grounds that there has been a breakdown in the
attorney-client relationship. The Court finds this to be proper grounds for
withdrawal. A breakdown in the attorney-client relationship is grounds for
allowing the attorney to withdraw. (Estate of Falco (1987) 188
Cal.App.3d 1004, 1014.)  
 
However, Defendant's motion is
procedurally defective for the following reasons: 
 
1.  A proof of
service was not lodged 5 days before the hearing. 
2.  No Proof of
service showing that Plaintiff was served at least 16 court days before the
hearing was filed. CCP § 1005(b). 
 
Furthermore, an Order to Show Cause re
DISMISSAL
AND SANCTIONS FOR FAILURE TO FILE POS AND FTA is on calendar for March 26, 2024.¿ Plaintiff has
insufficient time to bring in new counsel for that hearing.¿ Consequently,
the current motion is DENIED without prejudice.
