[1] The Court observed Defendants
filed the same set of documents in support of this application on October 9,
2024, but two of the supporting exhibits were missing the proof of service on
Dr. Vorperian. Therefore, the court will use the most recently filed date for
the purposes of this hearing that did include the proof of service for
the exhibits.


[2] All statutory references
are to California codes unless stated otherwise.
