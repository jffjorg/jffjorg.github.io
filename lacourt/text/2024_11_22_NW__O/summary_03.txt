And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants defendants' motion to file a cross-complaint against Toyota Motor North America, Inc., Toyota Motor Engineering & Manufacturing North America, Inc., and Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc. The cross-complaint arises from the same incident where plaintiff Rolando Morados sustained bodily injuries due to the detachment of a strap affixed to a Vehicle owned and operated by defendant Arnel Gacuson. The defendants seek to file the cross-complaint in good faith and have demonstrated their intent to do so by providing notice to the plaintiffs. The judge finds that the defendants are entitled to file the cross-complaint as a compulsory cross-complaint, and grants the motion. The defendants must file their cross-complaint on or before December 2, 2024.
