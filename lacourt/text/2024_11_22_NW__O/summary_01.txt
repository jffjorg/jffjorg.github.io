* "Defendants seek $2,086.65 in sanctions against Dr. Vorperian, accounting for Defendants' Preparation of Motion, declaration, and assembling of relevant exhibits (5 hrs) and anticipation of Appearance for Hearing on Motion (1 hr)."
* "The Court agrees with Defendants. Defendants made attempts to retrieve the production of records from Dr. Vorperian prior to serving the notice of deposition. Acting in good faith to maintain cordial communication with Dr. Vorperian, Defendants did their efforts in trying to ensure Dr. Vorperian's appearance by reminding him of the scheduled deposition and stating their willingness to accommodate the date."

**English-text summary**:

The judge grants the defendants' motion to compel the deposition of Kevork Vorperian, M.D. The defendants had previously filed a motion to compel the deposition and seek monetary sanctions against Dr. Vorperian. Dr. Vorperian failed to appear for his deposition and did not object to the deposition or the requested documents. The judge finds that the defendants made adequate attempts to meet and confer with Dr. Vorperian and that Dr. Vorperian's failure to appear and respond was unacceptable. As a result, the judge orders Dr. Vorperian to comply with the defendants' subpoena on or before December 12, 2024, and to pay the defendants' counsel reasonable attorneys' fees in the amount of $2,086.65 as a discovery sanction.
