 Case Number:  23VECV02319    Hearing Date:   July 12, 2024    Dept:  T 23VECV02319 Calton v PayqwickTentative ruling on ex parte application set 7/12/2024 to advance hearing: Denied.  It would be an undue burden on the court’s already heavy calendar to advance this motion to July 17th as requested and it would advance this motion without due cause over numerous other motions which have waited weeks to be heard. Instead, the court would be inclined to continue the Trial and FSC, and the discovery cutoff, as it appears that there is significant discovery which still needs to be completed. 
Accordingly, the court tentatively moves the trial date to 2/20/2025, the FSC to 2/13/2025, and continues all cutoff dates connected to the trial to the statutory period prior to the new trial date.  All motions will remain on calendar as currently scheduled. This will be sufficient time for the motion for protective order to be heard as scheduled and for the remaining discovery to take place before the new discovery cutoff in January. 
If this is insufficient time to complete discovery, the court can continue the trial into March or April if needed as Payqwick answered the complaint only 6 months ago in January 2024 and this is a complex case. 
The court notes that there are two MSJ’s which have been reserved for 9/25/2024 and 9/26/2024.  If pending discovery would be needed to oppose the motions, the court could potentially continue those motions as well.  The court would like to move the 9/25/2024 hearing to 9/26/2024.
The court will also vacate the CMC set for 7/17/2024.
 The court will discuss these issues with counsel at the hearing on 7/12/2024.
