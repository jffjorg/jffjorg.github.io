The judge also specifies that depositions must take place during normal business hours, via Zoom, and that parties have up to 7 continuous hours to take the deposition. Additionally, the judge reminds counsel that responses to requests for production of documents must comply with the Code. The judge will discuss these matters with counsel at the hearing on July 12, 2024.
