 Case Number:  23VECV01004    Hearing Date:   July 12, 2024    Dept:  T 23VECV01004
Manukyan v Kia
Tentative ruling: Ex parte application to continue the Trial, FSC and
reopen discovery:  Grant in part.  The court is willing to continue the Trial
and FSC for 120 days but will limit reopening of discovery to allow obtaining records
and depositions of the non-retained experts on plaintiff’s expert
designation.  This discovery must be
completed no later than 30 days before the new trial date.  Good cause is shown because as of the
responses to interrogatories served by plaintiff in October 2023, only 9 health
care providers were disclosed.  However,
in the expert designation served by plaintiff in July 2024, the plaintiff
designated over 30 additional health care providers not previously identified.
