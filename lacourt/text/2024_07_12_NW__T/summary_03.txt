And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding an ex parte application to continue the Trial, FSC, and reopen discovery. The Court is willing to grant the request in part, continuing the Trial and FSC for 120 days, but limiting the reopening of discovery to allow the plaintiff to obtain records and depositions of non-retained experts on their expert designation. The Judge finds good cause for this continuance and reopening due to the plaintiff's discovery of over 30 additional health care providers in their expert designation, which was not previously disclosed.
