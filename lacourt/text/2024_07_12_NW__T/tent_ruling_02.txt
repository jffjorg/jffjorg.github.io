 Case Number:  23VECV00256    Hearing Date:   July 12, 2024    Dept:  T 23VECV00256
Alvarez v Nowaczyk

Tentative
ruling: Plaintiff’s ex parte application to continue Trial, FSC, and certain
discovery deadlines.
The court
is exceptionally disappointed to see the complete lack of cooperation between counsel.  At this point, the court would be inclined to
grant the ex parte application for 75 days and allow limited discovery only: (1)
depositions of designated experts, (2) deposition of defendant Jennifer Nowaczyk,
(3) discovery motions on recently received discovery responses and on the
deposition notice for production of documents. 
If discovery motions are required on the depositions, please note that the
court would be inclined to order depositions to take place during normal business
hours, by Zoom, and that the parties have up to 7 continuous hours to take the
deposition, meaning that a deposition which may take seven hours would have to
start in the morning in order to be completed by 5 p.m. with a lunch break.  The court will not allow a deposition to be taken
piecemeal absent a showing of extraordinary good cause.  Also, counsel are reminded that responses to
request for production of documents must be Code compliant.
 The court will discuss these matters with counsel at the hearing.
