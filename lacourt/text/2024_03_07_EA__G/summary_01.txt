The City initially filed a complaint in November 2018 after discovering an illegal commercial marijuana grow operation during a search warrant execution. The defendants failed to respond to the complaint, and default was entered against them. The City submitted multiple applications for default judgment, which were previously denied. The current application is granted because the City has submitted sufficient evidence to support the default judgment.
