RULING
 
Plaintiff City of El Monte’s Application for Default
Judgment is GRANTED.
 
BACKGROUND
 
This is a nuisance abatement action. In November 2018, the
El Monte Police Department was executing a search warrant at a property in El
Monte when they discovered a commercial marijuana grow operation that was being
conducted illegally.
 
On June 7, 2021, the City of El Monte (the City) filed a
complaint against Dan Tu Cun, Jian Zou, Eagle Home Mortgage, LLC (Eagle Home
Mortgage), and Does 1-100 alleging the following causes of action: (1)
narcotics abatement, (2) public nuisance, (3) violation of El Monte municipal
code, (4) violation of Unfair Competition Law, and (5) violation of MAUCRSA. On
February 6, 2022, the City’s registered process server served Cun and Zou with
substitute service in El Monte. On February 15, the City’s process server
personally served Eagle Home Mortgage in North Palm Beach, Florida.
 
On May 27, 2022, default was entered against Cun and Zou. On
February 16, 2023, default was entered against Eagle Home Mortgage. On April 25,
the City submitted an application for default judgment. On May 17, the court
denied the City’s application.
 
On August 24, 2023, the City submitted another application
for default judgment that the court denied on November 6.
 
On January 4, 2024, the City submitted the present
application for default judgment. A case management conference/OSC Re: Default/Default
Judgment is set for March 7.
 
LEGAL STANDARD

Code of Civil Procedure section 585 permits
entry of a default judgment after a party has filed to timely respond or
appear.  A party seeking judgment on the default by the court must file a
Request for Court Judgment, and: (1) a brief summary of the case; (2)
declarations or other admissible evidence in support of the judgment requested;
(3) interest computations as necessary; (4) a memorandum of costs and
disbursements; (5) a proposed form of judgment; (6) a dismissal of all parties
against whom judgment is not sought or an application for separate judgment
under CCP § 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment; (7)
exhibits as necessary; and (8) a request for attorneys’ fees if allowed by
statute or by the agreement of the parties.  (Cal. Rules of Court 3.1800.)
 
ANALYSIS
 
The City seeks default judgment against Cun
and Zou in the total amount of $2,642,322.12, including $2,618,020 in damages, $15,143.50
in attorney fees, and $9,158.62 in costs. Because the City has submitted
sufficient evidence, the court GRANTS
the City’s application for default
judgment.
 
CONCLUSION
Based on the
foregoing, the City’s application for default judgment is GRANTED.
