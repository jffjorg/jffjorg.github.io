Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has granted the defendant's special motion to strike the plaintiff's complaint pursuant to CCP ยง 425.16. The defendant argued that the plaintiff's complaint arises from protected activity under the anti-SLAPP statute. The court found that the plaintiff failed to make a prima facie showing that he would succeed on the merits of his malicious prosecution cause of action. The court also found that the plaintiff failed to demonstrate that the underlying action was resolved in his favor. The court determined that the defendant prevailed in the underlying action and that there was probable cause for the defendant to maintain the action. The court also found that the plaintiff failed to demonstrate that the defendant acted with malice in maintaining the underlying action.
