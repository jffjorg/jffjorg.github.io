I.                  
MOTION TO
COMPEL
A propounding party may demand a responding
party to produce documents that are in their possession, custody or control.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.010.) A party may likewise conduct discovery by
propounding interrogatories to another party to be answered under oath. (Code
Civ. Proc. § 2030.010, subd. (a).) The responding party must respond to the
production demand either by complying, by representing that the party lacks the
ability to comply, or by objecting to the demand. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.210.) The responding party must respond to the interrogatories by
answering or objecting. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.210, subd. (a).) If the
responding party fails to serve timely responses, the propounding party may
move for an order compelling responses to the production demand and
interrogatories. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, 2031.300.) 
 
A
party who fails to serve a timely response to interrogatories or a demand for
inspection waives any objection to the demand. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290,
2031.300.)
Defendant Silvia Romo (Defendant) served Plaintiff Valentina
Gonzalez (Plaintiff) with demands for inspection on July 25, 2023. (Heim Decl.
¶ 2.) Defendant has received no response as of September 8, 2023. (Heim Decl. ¶
3.) Plaintiff has filed no opposition to this motion.
 
Defendant’s motion is GRANTED. Responses are ordered within
30 days.
 
II.    SANCTIONS
The
prevailing party on a motion to compel is generally entitled to monetary
sanctions, unless the court “finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 2030.290, 2031.300.) Sanctions are
also mandatory against a party whose failure to serve responses to requests for
admission makes the motion necessary. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.280, subd. (c).)
 
Defendant seeks $530.00 in sanctions, representing one hour
of attorney work at $475 per hour plus a $60 filing fee. (Heim Decl. ¶ 4.)
Sanctions are awarded in the amount of $590.
