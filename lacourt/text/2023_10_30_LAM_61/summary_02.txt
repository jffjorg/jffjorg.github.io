And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories and requests for production filed by Plaintiff Sohel Sedghat. The motion is GRANTED as to Interrogatories No. 11 and 12, which seek information about the witness Timothy Anderson and the basis for the Defendant's denial of Plaintiff's claims. The motion is otherwise DENIED, as the Plaintiff has not shown good cause for the other requests for production and the Defendant's responses to special interrogatories Nos. 3, 5, 7, and 8 are deemed sufficient. No sanctions are awarded. The ruling is based on the California Code of Civil Procedure and relevant case law, including Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants and Deyo v. Kilbourne.
