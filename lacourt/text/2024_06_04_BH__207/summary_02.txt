And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge, Michael E. Whitaker, has denied Gar Lee's motion for leave to amend the complaint on procedural grounds without prejudice. The court found that Lee's request was procedurally improper for two reasons. First, the motion was brought only on behalf of Lee, but the proposed amendment seeks to assert this new cause of action on behalf of all Plaintiffs. Lee does not have standing to assert to amend the complaint on behalf of the other Plaintiffs. Second, the Manzo declaration did not specify when the facts giving rise to the proposed amendment were discovered or the reasons why the request was not made sooner, as is required by Rule 3.1324(b). The court orders Lee to provide notice of the court's ruling and file the notice with a proof of service forthwith.
