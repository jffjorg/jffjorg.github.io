MOTION
 
            This case arises from a dispute
concerning an alleged Ponzi scheme to defraud Plaintiffs.  Plaintiff Gar Lee (“Lee”) moves for leave to amend
the complaint to add a cause of action for quasi contract seeking restitution on
behalf of all Plaintiffs and against Defendants Ron Appel, Kristine Taylor
Appel, Kristine Taylor Philanthropies, and Seagate Holdings, Inc.  
 
            Lee’s motion is unopposed.
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
Amendments
to Pleadings: General Provisions
 
            Under Code of Civil Procedure
section 473, subdivision (a)(1), “The court may, in furtherance of justice, and
on any terms as may be proper, allow a party to amend any pleading or
proceeding by adding or striking out the name of any party, or by correcting a
mistake in the name of a party, or a mistake in any other respect; and may, upon
like terms, enlarge the time for answer or demurrer. The court may likewise, in
its discretion, after notice to the adverse party, allow, upon any terms as may
be just, an amendment to any pleading or proceeding in other particulars; and
may upon like terms allow an answer to be made after the time limited by this
code.”
 
            To wit, without notice to the other
party the Court has wide discretion to allow either party (i) to add or strike
the name of a party or (ii) to correct a mistake in the name of a party or a
mistake in any other respect “in furtherance of justice” and “on any terms as
may be proper.” (See Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (a)(1); see also Marriage
of Liss (1992) 10 Cal.App.4th 1426, 1429.) Alternatively, after notice to
the other party, the Court has wide discretion to allow either party to amend
pleadings “upon any terms as may be just.” (See Code Civ. Proc., § 473,
subd. (a)(1). Similarly, Code of Civil Procedure section 576 states “Any judge,
at any time before or after commencement of trial, in the furtherance of
justice, and upon such terms as may be proper, may allow the amendment of any
pleading or pretrial conference order.”
 
            Judicial policy favors resolution of
all disputed matters between the parties and, therefore, leave to amend is
liberally granted. (Berman vs. Bromberg (1986) 56 Cal.App.4th 936, 945; Hirsa
v. Superior Court (1981) 118 Cal.App.3d 486, 488-489 [this has been an
established policy in California since 1901] (citing Frost v. Whitter
(1901) 132 Cal. 421, 424; Thomas v. Bruza (1957) 151 Cal.App.2d 150,
155).) The Court of Appeal in Morgan v. Superior Court held “If the
motion to amend is timely made and the granting of the motion will not
prejudice the opposing party, it is error to refuse permission to amend and
where the refusal also results in a party being deprived of the right to assert
a meritorious cause of action or a meritorious defense, it is not only error
but an abuse of discretion.” (Morgan v. Superior Court (1959) 172
Cal.App.2d 527, 530, citations omitted.) Moreover, “it is an abuse of
discretion for the court to deny leave to amend where the opposing party was
not misled or prejudiced by the amendment.” (Kittredge Sports Co. v.
Superior Court (1989) 213 Cal.App.3d 1045, 1048 [opposing party did not
establish harm by the delay in moving to amend the complaint].)
 
            “The court may grant leave to amend
the pleadings at any stage of the action.” (Weil & Brown, Cal. Practice
Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter Group 2023) ¶ 6:636 (hereafter
Weil & Brown).) Denial of a motion to amend is rarely justified if the
motion is timely made and granting the motion will not prejudice the opposing
party. (Id. at ¶ 6:639, citations omitted.) However, if the party
seeking the amendment has been dilatory, and the delay has prejudiced the
opposing party, the judge has discretion to deny leave to amend. (Id. at
¶ 6:655, citations omitted. Absent prejudice, any claimed delay alone is not
grounds for denial. “If the delay in seeking the amendment has not misled or
prejudiced the other side, the liberal policy of allowing amendments prevails.
Indeed, it is an abuse of discretion to deny leave in such a case even if
sought as late as the time of trial. (Id. at ¶ 6:653 (citing Higgins
v. Del Faro (1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 558, 564-565).) “Prejudice exists where
the amendment would result in a delay of trial, along with loss of critical
evidence, added costs of preparation, increased burden of discovery, etc. . . .
But the fact that the amendment involves a change in legal theory which would
make admissible evidence damaging to the opposing party is not the kind of
prejudice the court will consider.” (Weil & Brown, supra, at
¶ 6:656, citations omitted.)
 
            “Even if some prejudice is shown,
the judge may still permit the amendment but impose conditions, as the Court is
authorized to grant leave ‘on such terms as may be proper.’” (Weil &
Brown, supra, at ¶ 6:663, citation omitted.) For example, the court
may cause the party seeking the amendment to pay the costs and fees incurred in
preparing for trial. (Id. at ¶ 6:664 (citing Fuller v. Vista Del
Arroyo Hotel, 42 Cal.App.2d 400, 404).)
 
California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1324: Procedural Requirements
 
            Pursuant to California Rules of
Court, rule 3.1324(a), a motion to amend a pleading before trial must:
 
“(1) Include a copy of the proposed amendment or
amended pleadings, which must be serially numbered to differentiate it from
previous pleadings or amendments;
(2) state what allegations in the previous
pleading are proposed to be deleted, if any, and where, by page, paragraph, and
line number, the deleted allegations are located; and
(3) State what allegations are proposed to be
added to the previous pleading, if any, and where, by page, paragraph, and line
number, the additional allegations are located.”
 
            In addition, under Rule 3.1324(b), a
motion to amend a pleading before trial must be accompanied by a separate
declaration that specifies the following:
 
“(1) the effect of the amendment;
(2) why the amendment is necessary and proper;
(3) when the facts giving rise to the amended
allegations were discovered; and
(4) the reasons why the request for amendment was
not made earlier.”
 
DISCUSSION
 
            Plaintiff has included a copy of the
proposed amended complaint, and has stated what allegations are to be added by
page, paragraph, and line number.  In
support of the Motion, Plaintiff provides the Declaration of Luke Manzo, which
provides, in relevant part:
 
Effect of Amendment, CRC 3.1324(b)(1): 
 
4. The proposed amendment shall add a cause of
action for Quasi Contract Seeking Restitution and an updated prayer for relief.

 
5. The proposed amendment shall also add facts
and allegations in support of those causes of action, but which are based on
and related to the same facts in the original complaint.
 
[…]
 
Why the Amendment is Necessary and Proper, CRC
3.1324(b)(2): 
 
7. The proposed amendment is necessary for
Plaintiff to assert all applicable causes of action against Defendant based on
the facts available to it. The proposed amendment is proper because all causes
of action are within their respective statute of limitations. 
 
8. Since the causes of action are within their
respective statute of limitations, Plaintiff could file a distinct suit
alleging these causes of action independently. However, judicial policy favors
resolution of all disputed matters between the parties in the same lawsuit, and
a Court’s discretion is usually exercised to liberally permit amendment of the
pleadings. (See Nestle v. Santa Monica (1972) 6 Cal.3d 920, 939; Mabie
v. Hyatt (1998) 61 CA4th 581, 596, (citing text); Howard v. County of
San Diego (2010) 184 CA4th 1422, 1428)
 
(Manzo
Decl. ¶¶ 4-5, 7-8.)  
 
            The Court finds Lee’s request
procedurally improper for two reasons. 
First, the motion is brought only on behalf of Lee, but the proposed
amendment seeks to assert this new cause of action on behalf of all
Plaintiffs.  Lee does not have standing
to assert to amend the complaint on behalf of the other Plaintiffs.
 
            Second, the Manzo declaration does
not specify when the facts giving rise to the proposed amendment were
discovered or the reasons why the request was not made sooner, as is required
by Rule 3.1324(b).  
 
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
 
            For these reasons, the Court denies Lee’s
motion for leave to amend the complaint on procedural grounds without prejudice.  
 
            The Court orders Lee to provide
notice of the Court’s ruling and file the notice with a proof of service forthwith.
