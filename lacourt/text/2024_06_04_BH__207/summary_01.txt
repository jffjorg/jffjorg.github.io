And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court rules in part and denies in part both motions for a protective order. The Court grants a protective order limiting the deposition of Mai to 4 hours, excluding breaks, and sets the deadline for completion of the deposition on or before June 13, 2024. The Court also orders the parties to adhere to the Guidelines for Civility in Litigation and to meet and confer in a collaborative fashion forthwith. The Court denies both parties' requests to appoint a discovery referee and for monetary sanctions. The Court observes that non-expert discovery is closed as of June 3, 2024, and denies Plaintiff's requests that the Court order Defendant to appear for deposition and to continue the trial.
