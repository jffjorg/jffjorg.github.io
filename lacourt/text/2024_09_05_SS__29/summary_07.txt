And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to quash service of summons filed by Defendant Onen Okkes. The motion is denied. The judge finds that the declaration of Mr. Arceo, the registered process server, is credible and the declaration of Mr. Aslan, Okkes' roommate, is not credible. The judge credits and accepts the declaration of Mr. Arceo, which states that Okkes was served with the summons and complaint by substituted service at his residence on March 22, 2023. The judge rejects Okkes' argument that the substitute service was invalid because he had moved out of the residence prior to service. The judge also notes that Okkes did not present his own declaration, under oath, stating when he moved out of the residence. As a result, the motion to quash service of summons is denied.
