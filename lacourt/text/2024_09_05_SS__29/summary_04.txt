And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has not made a final ruling, but has issued a tentative ruling to be discussed at the hearing on September 5, 2024. The case involves an automobile accident and a motion by the defendants to compel a neurological examination of the plaintiff, Michelle Gonzalez. The judge is unclear about the defendants' intentions and the basis for their motion, as they have failed to explain what type of examination they are seeking (physical or mental) and the authority under which they seek it. The judge is seeking additional clarity from the parties and will call the matter to discuss the issues further.
