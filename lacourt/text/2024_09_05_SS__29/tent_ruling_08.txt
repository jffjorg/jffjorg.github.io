 Case Number:  23STCV08463    Hearing Date:   September 5, 2024    Dept:  29 Lawrence v. LACMTA
23STCV08463 
Motion to be Relieved as Counsel, filed by Plaintiff’s Counsel Brian Jacobson,
Esq. of Wilshire Law Firm


Tentative
Motion to be relieved as counsel is DENIED
without prejudice.
Background
On April 17, 2023, Charlette Ann Lawrence
(“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Los Angeles County Metropolitan
Transportation Authority (“Defendant”) for negligence arising out of a bus
incident on August 22, 2022, in which Plaintiff sustained injury.
On August 14, 2024, Defendant filed an answer
and cross-complaint.
On July 31, 2024,
Brian Jacobson, Esq. of Wilshire Law Firm (“Counsel”)
filed this motion to be relieved as counsel. No opposition has been filed. 
 
Legal
Standard
The court may order that an attorney be changed or
substituted at any time before or after judgment or final determination upon
request by either client or attorney and after notice from one to the other.
(Code of Civ. Proc., § 284(b).) An attorney is permitted to withdraw where
conflicts between the attorney and client make it unreasonable to continue the
representation. (See Cal. Rules of Prof. Conduct 3-700(C)(1).) “The
determination whether to grant or deny a motion to withdraw as counsel lies
within the sound discretion of the trial court.” (Manfredi & Levine v.
Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128, 1133.)   
 
An application to be relieved as counsel must be made on
Judicial Counsel Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion) (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1362(a)), MC-052 (Declaration) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.136(c)), and MC-053 (Proposed Order) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362(e)).   
 
Further, the requisite forms must be served on the client
and all other parties who have appeared in the case. (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.1362(d).) The court may delay effective date of the order relieving
counsel until proof of service of a copy of the signed order on the client has
been filed with the court. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(e).) 
 
Discussion
 
Counsel has filed
the Notice, Declaration and Order to be Relieved as Counsel and served on
Plaintiff. Counsel confirmed Plaintiff’s current address by telephone. Counsel
contends representation is difficult because of Plaintiff’s conduct. However,
Counsel failed to provide all upcoming dates on the Declaration and Order; the
April 14, 2025 OSC re Dismissal is omitted from both.
 
The Court finds
Counsel has not met the procedural requirements.
 
Accordingly, the
motion is DENIED without prejudice.
Conclusion
The motion to be
relieved is DENIED without prejudice. Moving counsel to give notice
