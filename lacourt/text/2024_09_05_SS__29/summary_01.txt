And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to enter judgment with costs in the amount of $4,992.20. The defendant filed a complaint for general negligence and motor vehicle negligence causes of action arising out of an automobile accident that occurred on November 29, 2019. The plaintiff's complaint was dismissed without prejudice on February 8, 2024. The defendant filed its memorandum of costs on February 23, 2024, and the court finds that these fees are recoverable under California Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5. The plaintiff has not filed an opposition to this motion, and therefore the court grants the defendant's motion and approves the proposed judgment, including an award of $4,992.20 in costs.
