The judge found that Counsel failed to meet the procedural requirements for filing the motion, specifically failing to provide all upcoming dates on the Declaration and Order. The judge noted that the court may delay the effective date of the order relieving Counsel until proof of service of a copy of the signed order on the Plaintiff has been filed with the court. The motion is denied, and Counsel is ordered to give notice.
