 Case Number:  22STCV10554    Hearing Date:   September 5, 2024    Dept:  29 Gonzalez v. County of Los Angeles
22STCV10554
Defendants’ Motion to Compel Neurological Examination

Tentative
The Court will call this matter.
 
Background
On March
28, 2022, Michelle Gonzalez (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against County of
Los Angeles, Kristofor Masson (collectively “Defendants”), and Does 1 through
100 for negligence and statutory liability arising out of an automobile
accident occurring on August 2, 2021. 
 
On April 11, 2022,
Defendants each filed an answer to the complaint. 
 
On August 7, 2024, Defendants filed two motions.  In the first motion, set for hearing on
September 5, Defendants seek an order compelling Plaintiff to appear for a neurological
examination.  In the second motion, set
for hearing on September 9, Defendants seek an order compelling Plaintiff to
appear for an examination with a pain management specialist.  
 
As to the motion set for hearing on September 5, Plaintiff
filed a limited opposition on August 23, and Defendants filed a reply on August
28.
 
Discussion
 
As a threshold matter, Defendants are the moving parties and
have the burden of explaining what relief they are seeking and the authority
under which the relief is sought. This is not clear to the Court.  
 
Code of Civil Procedure sections 2032.220 through
2032.260 govern the first request by a defendant for a physical examination of
a plaintiff.
 
Code of Civil Procedure sections 2032.310 through
2032.320 govern any subsequent request for a physical examination, as well as
any request for a mental examination.
 
Different standards and procedures govern a first
physical examination versus a subsequent physical examination.  Different standards and procedures govern a
physical examination versus a mental examination.
 
In their notice of motion, Defendants state that this
motion is brought under section 2032.220 and section 2032.320.  But that can’t be true.  This is either a physical examination or a
mental examination.  If it is a physical
examination, it is either the first examination or a subsequent
examination.  The moving papers don’t
explain what it is.
 
In their memorandum, Defendants seem to rely primarily on
sections 2032.310 and 2032.320, indicating that they are seek leave to conduct either
a mental examination or a second physical examination.  (Mem., at pp. 5-6.)  In their reply, Defendants reference section
2032.530, indicating that they think that the examination is a mental
examination and not a physical examination. 
(Reply, at p. 4.)  In general, and
subject to certain exceptions, however, the Court views neurological
examinations as physical examinations and neuropsychological examinations as
mental examinations.
 
The Court will call this matter to seek additional
clarity from the parties.
