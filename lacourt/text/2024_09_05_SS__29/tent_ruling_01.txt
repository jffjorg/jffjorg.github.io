  Case Number:  20STCV40469    Hearing Date:   September 5, 2024    Dept:  29 Birger v. Lasater
20STCV40469
Motion for Entry of Judgment with Costs
 
Tentative
 
The motion is granted
 
Background   
 
On October 21, 2020, Gennadiy
Birger (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Linda Lasater (“Defendant”) for
general negligence and motor vehicle negligence causes of action arising out of
an automobile accident occurring on November 29, 2019.
 
On February 8, 2024, Plaintiff’s
complaint was dismissed without prejudice.
 
On February 23, 2024, Defendant
filed its memorandum of costs.
 
On August 9, 2024, Defendant
filed this motion, labeled as a “Motion to Enter Tax Costs and Sign Judgment.”  The Court assumes that the inclusion of the
word “Tax” in the document title was a drafting error.
 
No opposition has been filed.
 
Legal
Standard 
 
In general, the “prevailing
party” is entitled as a matter of right to recover costs for suit in any action
or proceeding. (CCP, §1032(b); Santisas v. Goodin (1998) 17 Cal.4th 599,
606; Scott Co. Of Calif. v. Blount, Inc. (1999) 20 Cal.4th 1103,
1108.)  Assuming the “prevailing party” requirements are met, the trial
court has no discretion to order each party to bear his or her own costs of
suit.  (Michell v. Olick (1996) 49 Cal.App.4th 1194, 1198; Nelson
v. Anderson (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 111, 129.)   
 
“A prevailing party who claims
costs must serve and file a memorandum of costs within 15 days after the date
of service of the notice of entry of judgment or dismissal by the clerk under
Code of Civil Procedure section 664.5 or the date of service of written notice
of entry of judgment or dismissal, or within 180 days after entry of judgment,
whichever is first. The memorandum of costs must be verified by a statement of
the party, attorney, or agent that to the best of his or her knowledge the
items of cost are correct and were necessarily incurred in the case.” (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1700.)
 
Discussion 
 
Defendant moves for entry of
judgment, including costs.  Defendant
argues it timely filed its memorandum of costs on February 23, 2024, fifteen
days after Plaintiff’s complaint was dismissed on February 8, 2024.  (Galang Decl., ¶¶ 2, 3.) Plaintiff has not
timely filed a motion to set aside the dismissal nor a motion to tax
Defendant’s costs. (Id., ¶ 4.) 
 
On April 5, 2024, Defendant filed
a proposed judgment on the dismissal with its costs of $4,992.20. These costs
are made up of $615 in filing fees, $1,677.20 in deposition costs, and $2,700
in witness fees. The Court finds these fees recoverable under Code of Civil
Procedure section 1033.5.
 
Plaintiff has not filed an
opposition to this motion.
 
Accordingly, the Court GRANTS
Defendant’s motion to enter judgment, including costs in the amount of $4,992.20.
 
Conclusion 
 
Defendant Linda Lasater’s motion is
GRANTED. 
 
The Court APPROVES the proposed judgment,
including an award of $4,992.20 in costs, submitted on April 5, 2024.
 
Moving party is ordered to give
notice.
