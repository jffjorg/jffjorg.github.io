Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiffs' motion for relief from waiver of jury trial. The plaintiffs, Joel S. and Teresa A. Cohen, brought a lawsuit against City Terrace Service, Inc. and Mohammad Amine Rahmani after a motorcycle accident in 2020. The plaintiffs' counsel inadvertently failed to timely make a demand and post fees for a jury trial. The City Terrace Defendants and Penske Truck Leasing Co. had already posted jury fees and demanded a jury trial. The judge found that granting relief from waiver would not cause undue hardship to any party and would not prejudice the court. The judge exercised its discretion under Code of Civil Procedure section 631, subdivision (g), to grant relief from waiver and allow a trial by jury.
