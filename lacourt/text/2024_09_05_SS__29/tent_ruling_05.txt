 Case Number:  22STCV13539    Hearing Date:   September 5, 2024    Dept:  29 County v. City Terrace Service
22STCV13539
Plaintiffs’ Motion for Relief From Waiver of Jury
Trial
Tentative
The motion is granted.
Background
This matter involves two cases arising out of an accident that
occurred on June 25, 2020, in which a motorcycle on a tow truck came loose and
injured Sheriff’s Deputy Joel Cohen. (Complaint in lead case, at 4.) In the
lead case (Case No. 22STCV13539), Deputy Cohen’s employer, the County of Los
Angeles (“County”) brought a subrogation claim lawsuit on April 22, 2022,
against Defendants City Terrace Service, Inc., Mohammad Amine Rahmani
(collectively, the “City Terrace Defendants”), and Does 1 through 10, asserting
causes of action for general negligence and breach of contract. The City
Terrace Defendants answered on June 30, 2022. On October 14, 2022, County
amended the complaint to correct the identification of Defendant Rahmani.
In the second filed case, on June 7, 2022, Plaintiffs Joel S. and
Teresa A. Cohen (“Plaintiffs”) filed a lawsuit (Case No. 22STCV18608) against
the City Terrace Defendants and Does 1 through 50, asserting causes of action
for motor vehicle negligence and general negligence.
On November 2, 2022, the two cases were related. On December 5,
2022, the cases were consolidated, with the County’s subrogation case (Case No.
22STCV13529) designated as the lead case.
On November 15, 2022, Plaintiffs amended the complaint to name
Penske Truck Leasing Co. (“Penske”) as Doe 1.
Penske filed an answer to Plaintiff’s complaint on February 15,
2023.
On May 9, 2024, the Court granted the unopposed motion of the City
Terrace Defendants for a determination that their settlement with County and
Plaintiffs was in good faith under Code of Civil Procedure section 877.6.
On June 17, 2024, the Court, at the request of County, dismissed
the complaint filed by County in Case No. 22STCV13539 with prejudice.
On June 25, 2024, the Court, at the request of Plaintiffs,
dismissed the causes of action asserted by Plaintiffs in the complaint in Case
No. 22STCV18608 against the City Terrace Defendants with prejudice.
As it relates to the matter set for hearing on September 5, Plaintiffs
filed a demand for jury trial on July 30, 2024. 
On August 7, Plaintiffs filed this motion for an order granting
relief from waiver of trial by jury. No opposition has been filed. 
 
Legal Standard
 
“Trial by jury is an
inviolate right and shall be secured to all.” (Cal. Const., art. I, § 16.) “In
a civil cause a jury may be waived by the consent of the parties expressed as
prescribed by statute.” (Ibid.) 
 
Code of Civil Procedure
section 631 is the primary statute addressing waiver of a jury trial in a civil
case. Under section 631, subdivision(f)(5), a party waives their right to a
jury trial by not timely posting jury fees. Jury fees must be paid “on or
before the date scheduled for the initial case management conference in the
action”; where there is no case management conference, the fees are due “no
later than 365 calendar days after the filing of the initial complaint.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 631, subd. (c) & (c)(2).) 
 
“The court may, in its
discretion upon just terms, allow a trial by jury although there may have been
a waiver of a trial by jury.” (Id., subd. (g).) 
 
The California Supreme
Court recently addressed the exercise of this discretion in TriCoast
Builders, Inc. v. Fonnegra (2024) 15 Cal.5th 766. In ruling on a request
for relief from waiver of jury trial: 
 
“[T]he primary
consideration is … whether granting relief from waiver would result in any hardship
to other parties or to the court, such as delay in rescheduling the trial for a
jury or inconvenience to witnesses. But courts have also regularly considered
other factors, including the timeliness of the request; whether the requester
is willing to comply with applicable requirements for payment of jury fees; and
the reasons supporting the request.” (15 Cal.5th at pp. 779-780.) 
 
“[T]he presence or absence
of hardship is not always dispositive,” and the court may, in its discretion,
also consider (among other things) whether the motion for relief from waiver
“simply reflects a belated change of heart about trial tactics” or is being
used as a “pretext” to obtain a continuance. (Id., at p. 780.) But when
a party “has timely given notice that it desires trial by jury” but then loses
that right by nonpayment of fees, “lack of hardship to the other parties or the
court is generally controlling, absent other factors that weigh against
relief.” (Id., at p. 782.) 
 
In ruling on request from
relief from waiver under section 631, subdivision (g), “courts are mindful of
the requirement ‘to resolve doubts in interpreting the waiver provisions of
section 631 in favor of a litigant's right to jury trial.’” (Tesoro del
Valle Master Homeowners Assn. v. Griffin (2011) 200 Cal.App.4th 619, 638, quoting
Grafton Partners v. Superior Court (2005) 36 Cal.4th 944, 956.)
 
Discussion
 
Plaintiffs’ counsel states
that they inadvertently failed to timely make a demand and post fees for a jury
trial. (Dordick Decl., ¶ 3.) Plaintiffs untimely posted jury fees on August 29,
2023; there is no indication that this was a deliberate tactical decision, that
Plaintiffs are having a belated change of heart, or that this is a pretext for
a continuance. Inadvertence is a factor that weighs in support of granting the
motion. 
 
Although the presence or
absence of prejudice is not independently dispositive, the Court notes that no
opposition has been filed. Plaintiffs contend there is no prejudice as the parties
have been preparing for a jury trial. (Ibid.) The Court notes the City Terrace
Defendants posted jury fees on April 24, 2023, and Penske demanded a jury trial
in its answer on February 15, 2023.
 
The Court finds that Plaintiffs
did not timely post jury fees or demand a jury trial; that in doing so, Plaintiffs waived the
right to jury trial; that this waiver was inadvertent; and that no party would suffer
any undue or unfair prejudice from a court order granting relief from waiver.
 
After considering all of
the evidence in the record, the Court exercises its discretion under Code of
Civil Procedure section 631, subdivision (g), to grant relief from waiver and
to allow a trial by jury.
 
Conclusion
 
The Court
GRANTS Plaintiffs’ motion for relief from waiver of jury trial.
 
Moving party is ORDERED to give notice.
