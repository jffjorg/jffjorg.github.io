And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge regarding a motion to compel a nonparty witness, David Heskiaoff, M.D., to appear for deposition. The motion was filed by the defendant, Laura J. Rodziewicz, who is seeking to compel Dr. Heskiaoff to answer questions and produce documents related to the case. The plaintiffs, Hernan Chavarria and Martha Lissette Quevedo, are suing the defendant for negligence arising from an automobile accident.

The judge denied the motion without prejudice, meaning that the defendant can re-file the motion at a later time. The judge's decision is based on the fact that there is no proof of personal service of the motion on Dr. Heskiaoff, as required by the California Rules of Court. The judge also noted that the defendant must give notice of the denial of the motion.

The case involves a deposition subpoena issued to Dr. Heskiaoff, which was personally served on May 23, 2024. Dr. Heskiaoff did not appear for his deposition, and the defendant took a certificate of non-appearance. The defendant is seeking to compel Dr. Heskiaoff to answer questions and produce documents related to the case. The judge's decision does not address the merits of the defendant's motion, but rather the procedural issue of whether the motion was properly served on Dr. Heskiaoff.
