And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication. The judge finds that there are material issues of fact and law regarding the enforceability of the waiver and release signed by the plaintiff concerning his massage therapy. The defendant has failed to establish that the circumstances of the case bring the transaction within the category of those affected with a public interest, making the waiver and release unenforceable. The judge also finds that there is a material issue of fact regarding whether the plaintiff suffered injuries caused by the defendants. The judge believes that further factual development is needed to determine the enforceability of the waiver and release in the context of a massage therapist. Additionally, the judge disagrees with the defendant's argument that the plaintiff does not contest the applicability of the waiver and release to the general negligence cause of action.
