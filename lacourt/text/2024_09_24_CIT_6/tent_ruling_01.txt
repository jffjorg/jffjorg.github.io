  Case Number:  24PSCV00591    Hearing Date:   September 24, 2024    Dept:  6 Plaintiff
Tawa, Inc. (Retail)’s Request for Entry of Default Judgment 
Defendant: Liming Luo 
TENTATIVE RULING 
            Plaintiff’s
request for entry of default judgment is DENIED without prejudice.           
BACKGROUND           
            This
is a commercial lease dispute. On February 26, 2024, plaintiff Tawa, Inc.
(Retail)[1] (Plaintiff) filed this
action against defendant Liming Luo (Defendant) and Does 1 to 10, alleging
causes of action for breach of contract – lease agreement, account stated, and
book account. Default was entered against Defendant on June 4, 2024. Plaintiff
requested entry of default judgment on June 13, 2024. Following the Court’s
denial of Plaintiff’s default judgment request, Plaintiff resubmitted the
default judgment package on August 13, 2024.           
LEGAL
STANDARD 
Code of
Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a party
has failed to timely respond or appear. (Code Civ. Proc., § 585.) A party
seeking judgment on the default by the court must file a Request for Court
Judgment, and: (1) a brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other
admissible evidence in support of the judgment requested; (3) interest
computations as necessary; (4) a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) declaration
of nonmilitary status; (6) a proposed form of judgment; (7) a dismissal of all
parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application for separate
judgment under Code of Civil Procedure section 579, supported by a showing of
grounds for each judgment; (8) exhibits as necessary; and (9) a request for
attorneys’ fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties. (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1800.) 
ANALYSIS 
Plaintiff
seeks default judgment against Defendants in the total amount of $54,032.32, including
$46,020.27 in damages, $5,838.29 in interest, $1,648.45 in attorney fees, and $525.31
in costs. The Court finds Plaintiff’s request for entry of default judgment
still has some issues, namely that Plaintiff has not submitted sufficient
evidence showing $46,020.27 in damages. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 585, subd.
(b). [“The court shall hear the evidence offered by the plaintiff, and shall
render judgment in the plaintiff's favor for that relief, not exceeding the
amount stated in the complaint… as appears by the evidence to be just.”]) In
the context of a request for entry of default judgment by the court, evidence
to establish liability is not required since a defendant’s failure to answer
the complaint admits the well-pleaded allegations of the complaint and no
further proof of liability is required. (Carlsen v. Koivumaki (2014) 227
Cal.App.4th 879, 883.) However, the plaintiff must still provide evidence to
establish damages. (Id., at p. 884.) 
The most
the evidence shows here is $41,948.32 in damages. (Decl. re Attorney’s Fees
Provision in Contract Pursuant to CC § 1717 and CCP § 1032, Ex. 1.) The
commercial lease agreement, while essential to Plaintiff’s claims, does not
show Defendant failed to pay the rent as promised. (See Plaintiff’s Exhibits in
Support of Request for Entry of Default Judgment, Ex. 1.) Plaintiff’s
declaration states Defendant failed to pay Base Rent from November 1, 2022
through December 31, 2022. (Yang Decl., ¶ 9.) Yet, Plaintiff claims Defendant
owes $40,726.53 in unpaid base rent. (Yang Decl., ¶ 9.) All of Plaintiff’s
other documentary evidence is demonstrative and was created for this default
judgment request. (See Plaintiff’s Exhibits in Support of Request for Entry of
Default Judgment, Exs. 2-4; People v. Diaz (2014) 227 Cal.App.4th 362, 384
fn. 19 [demonstrative evidence is a tool to aid the jury in understanding the
substantive evidence].) 
The
demonstrative evidence is also inconsistent and incomplete. Plaintiff provides
no explanation for how it calculated the NNN charges or the NSF fee, or
conversely the calculations for the CAM reconciliation credits and retention
deposit. (See Plaintiff’s Exhibits in Support of Request for Entry of Default
Judgment, Ex. 1; Yang Decl., ¶¶ 10-11.) Exhibit 4 claims principal damages
of $46.020.27, but Plaintiff’s prejudgment interest calculation is based on $41,948.32
in principal damages. (Decl. of Plaintiff’s Counsel Regarding Accrued Costs and
Statutory Interest, p. 8.) Plaintiff’s attorney fees request also appears to be
based on $41,948.32 in principal damages. (Decl. re Attorney’s Fees Provision
in Contract Pursuant to CC § 1717 and CCP § 1032, ¶ 8.) 
CONCLUSION           
            Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s
request for entry of default judgment is DENIED without prejudice.
