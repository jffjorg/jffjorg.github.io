And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's request for entry of default judgment against the defendant without prejudice. The plaintiff sought default judgment in the amount of $54,032.32, including $46,020.27 in damages, $5,838.29 in interest, $1,648.45 in attorney fees, and $525.31 in costs. However, the judge found that the plaintiff's evidence did not support the damages claimed, and the judge ordered the plaintiff to resubmit its evidence. The judge also noted that the plaintiff's documentary evidence was incomplete and inconsistent, and that the plaintiff had not provided sufficient evidence to establish the amount of damages. As a result, the judge denied the plaintiff's request for entry of default judgment without prejudice, allowing the plaintiff to resubmit its evidence and request a new hearing.
