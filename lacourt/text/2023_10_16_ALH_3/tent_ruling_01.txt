[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER RE: PETITION FOR MINOR’S COMPROMISE 
 
Dept.

8:30
  a.m.

October
   16, 2023



 
Claimant Damon Pallais (“Claimant”), a
minor, by and through his Guardian Ad Litem, Deysi Rivas (“Petitioner”), has
agreed to settle his claims against Defendant Dekaven Ashley in exchange for
$30,000. According to the petition, $4,278.17 will be used for medical
expenses, $7,500 will be used for attorney’s fees, and $517.97 will be used for
non-medical expenses, leaving a balance of $17, 703.86 for Claimant to be deposited into a blocked account,
subject to withdrawal only upon authorization of the court.
Court approval is required for all
settlements of a minor’s claim. (Probate Code §§ 3500, 3600, et seq.; Code Civ.
Proc. § 372.) 
On July 19, 2023, the Court denied
Petitioner’s prior petition for minor’s compromise for the following three
reasons: 1) there was no proposed order approving the petition on Form MC-351,
2) the costs listed in Item 13b on the petition were overstated by $435 because
there was no filing fee for this petition (Gov. Code, § 70617, subd. (b)(13)), and
3) the proposed order to deposit funds in blocked account should have identified
Petitioner as Claimant’s parent in Items 1 and 3.
On July 24, 2023, Petitioner filed a
new petition, a proposed order, and a proposed order to deposit funds in a
blocked account.  The Court has reviewed
the proposed settlement and finds that it is fair and reasonable.  Further, the requested attorney’s fees, which
amounts to approximately 25% of the total settlement, is fair and reasonable.
Additionally, Petitioner has corrected the deficiencies identified at the June
19, 2023, hearing. 
Accordingly, the unopposed Petition to
approve minor’s compromise is GRANTED.
The Court sets an OSC for
________________ for proof of deposit. 
(Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 7.953(a).) 
If an acknowledgement of receipt by the financial institution is filed
before that date, no appearance will be required.
Per California Rules of Court, Rule
7.952, Petitioner and Claimant must appear at the hearing, unless the Court
finds good cause to excuse their appearance. 
The Court finds that Claimant’s appearance is not necessary, but will
require Petitioner to appear.
Moving party to give notice.
Dated this 16th day of October, 2023
