And here is the summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the defendants' motion to dismiss or abate the action and stays the action pending the resolution of another case, Yeo Bai Lee v. Christy Ryoo, et al., Santa Clara Superior Court, Case No. 21CV386912. The judge finds that the two actions deal with the same subject matter and that the court in the first action has the power to grant complete relief, making it necessary to stay the second action. The judge also notes that the defendants timely raised the ground for abatement in their answer and that abatement is mandatory when the requisite conditions are shown.
