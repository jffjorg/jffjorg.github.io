  Case Number:  21STCV29882    Hearing Date:   December 4, 2023    Dept:  74 Darryl Lyons
v. Transdev Services, Inc., et al.
Motion to File Under Seal
BACKGROUND 
            This
action arises from an employment dispute. 
            On
August 12, 2021, Plaintiff Darryl Lyons (Plaintiff) filed a complaint against
Transdev Services, Inc., Transdev North America, Inc., and Timothy Grensavitch
(Defendants).
            On
March 30, 2023, Defendants filed a motion for summary judgment.
            On
September 18, 2023, Defendants filed this motion to seal documents supporting
the motion for summary judgment.
LEGAL STANDARD
            Unless confidentiality is required
by law, court records are presumed to be open to the public. (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 2.550, subd. (c).) Consequently, pleadings, motions, evidence, and
other papers may not be filed under seal merely by stipulation of the parties;
rather, a prior court order is necessary. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.551,
subd. (a).) 
            To
grant such an order, the court must expressly find that . . . “on overriding
interest exists that overcomes the right of public access to the record, an
overriding interest supports sealing the records, a substantial probability
exists that the overriding interest will be prejudiced if the record is not
sealed, the proposed sealing is narrowly tailored, and no less restrictive
means exist to achieve the overriding interest.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
2.550, subd. (d).) 
            If
the court fails to make the required findings, the order is deficient and
cannot support sealing. (Overstock.com, Inc. v. Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (2014)
231 Cal.App.4th 471, 487.) 
DISCUSSION  
The Identities of Third-Party
Employees
            Defendants seek to seal portions of
documents disclosing the names of third-party employees. The court finds that a
legitimate interest supports this sealing. As Defendants note, courts recognize
a right to privacy in confidential personnel information. (El Dorado Savings & Loan Assn. v. Superior Court (1987)
190 Cal.App.3d 342, 346, disapproved on other grounds in Williams v.
Superior Court (20170 3 Cal.5th 531.) This interest overrides that of
the public in access to the names of the third-party employees. This interest
will be compromised if the names remain unsealed and open to the public. The court finds the proposed sealing of the following
documents sufficiently narrow tailored:
            Declaration
of Allison Scott 
                        
                        The names of third-party employees in Exhibit D, 49:20-22,
80:11-23, 137:10,                              159:10-13.
 
                        The
names of third-party employees in Exhibit G, 64:6-13.
 
                        The names of third-party employees in Exhibit L, 109:17-22.
            
                        The
names of third-party employees in Exhibit N, 104:8-22.
 
                        The
names of third-party employees in Exhibit Q, 146:15-16, 175:13-20.
 
Plaintiff’s Private Information
 
            Defendants wish to seal Plaintiff’s
IRS W-2s. Defendants cite Plaintiff’s right to privacy in his financial
information. (Valley Bank of Nevada v. Superior Court (1975) 15 Cal.3d
652, 657.) This interest overrides any interest the public might have in such
records. Moreover, the court finds the proposed sealing sufficiently narrow.
Thus, the court will grant the motion to seal Exhibit 26 to Exhibit C of the
Declaration of Allison Scott.
The Parties’ 2016 Settlement
Agreement
            Defendants request to seal their
settlement with Plaintiff. In support, Defendants cite the parties’ privacy
interest in the agreement. (Hinshaw, Winkler, Draa, Marsh & Still (1996)
51 Cal.App.4th 233, 241, disapproved on other grounds in Williams v.
Superior Court (2017) 3 Cal.5th 531 [“The privacy of a settlement is
generally understood and accepted in our legal system, which favors settlement
and therefore supports needs for confidentiality.”].) This interest overrides
that of the public in the settlement, and the court finds the proposed sealing
sufficiently narrow tailored. Accordingly, the court grants the motion to seal
section 7, subsections (a) through (f) of the settlement agreement (De Alba
Decl., ¶ 9; Ex. G.) 
CONCLUSION 
Based
on the foregoing, the court grants Defendants’ motion to seal in its entirety.
