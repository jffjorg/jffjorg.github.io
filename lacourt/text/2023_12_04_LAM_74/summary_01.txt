Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the defendants' motion to seal certain documents supporting their motion for summary judgment. The judge finds that a legitimate interest supports sealing the documents, which contain the names of third-party employees, as courts recognize a right to privacy in confidential personnel information. The judge also grants the motion to seal the plaintiff's IRS W-2s, citing the plaintiff's right to privacy in his financial information. Additionally, the judge grants the motion to seal the 2016 settlement agreement between the parties, citing the parties' privacy interest in the agreement. The judge concludes that the proposed sealing is narrowly tailored and that no less restrictive means exist to achieve the overriding interest.
