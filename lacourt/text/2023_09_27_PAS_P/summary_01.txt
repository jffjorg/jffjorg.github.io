## Summary of the Tentative Ruling

Judge Margaret L. Oldendorf has issued a tentative ruling denying Plaintiff JING SHAO's motion to compel arbitration in the case of *Shao v. Huang, Chao, and Ta*.

The judge's reasoning rests on two key points: 

1. **Lack of Evidence:** Shao failed to provide sufficient evidence demonstrating the existence of a written arbitration agreement with Defendant LIPING HUANG and HUANG's refusal to arbitrate. Without this evidence, the burden of proof wasn't met.
2. **Intertwined Claims:** Even if an agreement could be proven, the judge argues that Shao's claims against Huang, Chao, and Ta are too intertwined to be resolved through separate arbitration proceedings. Trying the case together is necessary to avoid conflicting rulings on common issues of fact and law.

As a result, the motion to compel arbitration is denied, and both cases related to this matter are temporarily halted (stayed) pending further action.

Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied the plaintiff's motion to compel arbitration in this case. The plaintiff, Jing Shao, alleges that the defendant, Liping Huang, breached a real estate purchase contract and seeks specific performance. Shao also sues two other parties, Jack Wei Chao and Lina Ta, for intentional interference with contractual relation. The plaintiff's motion to compel arbitration is based on an alleged agreement to arbitrate contained in the Residential Purchase Agreement between Shao and Huang. However, the court finds that there is no evidence of a written agreement to arbitrate and no evidence of Huang's refusal to arbitrate. Even if such evidence had been presented, the court would have denied the motion because the claims against Huang are intertwined with the claims against Chao and Ta, and arbitration could result in conflicting rulings. The court has denied the motion and stayed both cases.

English text:
This tentative ruling is regarding case number 23AHCV00201, with a hearing date of September 27, 2023, in the Superior Court of the State of California, Los Angeles County, Northeast District. The plaintiff, Jing Shao, brought a motion to compel arbitration and bifurcate the arbitration from the action against the defendants, Liping Huang, Jack Wei Chao, Lina Ta, and Does 1-10. The case and the related case, Navigators Real Estate, Inc. v. Liping Huang, concern a real estate purchase contract for a residence in Monrovia owned by Huang. Shao alleges breach of contract and seeks specific performance as to Huang, and sues Chao and Ta for intentional interference with contractual relation.

The court determined that Shao did not meet the burden of proving the existence of a written agreement to arbitrate by a preponderance of the evidence. There is no authenticating declaration for the Residential Purchase Agreement and no evidence of Huang’s refusal to arbitrate. Even if this burden had been met, the court would still deny the motion because the claims need to be tried together to avoid conflicting outcomes.

Therefore, Shao's motion to compel arbitration is denied, and both cases are ordered stayed. Shao is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
