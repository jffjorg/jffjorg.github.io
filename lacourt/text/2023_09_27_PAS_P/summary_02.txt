And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the plaintiff's discovery motions, compelling defendants Bashir Mahamud and SW Transport LLC to respond to form interrogatories and requests for production of documents. The plaintiff had filed five discovery motions, which were opposed by the defendants. The judge found that the defendants' oppositions were not sufficient to justify delaying the discovery process, and that the imposition of monetary sanctions was not warranted. The judge ordered the defendants to provide verified responses to the discovery requests within 15 days of notice of the order.
