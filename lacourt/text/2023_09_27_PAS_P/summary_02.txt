## English Summary 

This tentative ruling deals with five discovery motions filed by the Plaintiff, Egine Artinian, in a wrongful death case against Bashir Mahamud, SW Transport LLC, and Snider Leasing Corp. 

The Plaintiff's son, David Artinian, died in a car accident involving a truck allegedly negligently driven by Mahamud, who was employed by SW Transport LLC and driving a truck leased by Snider Leasing Corp. Snider Leasing Corp. has since been dismissed from the case.

The Plaintiff seeks to compel Mahamud and SW Transport LLC to respond to discovery requests, including interrogatories and requests for production of documents. 

Defense counsel for Mahamud and SW Transport LLC argues that they have been unable to locate their clients and obtain cooperation in responding to the discovery. However, the Judge finds that this does not relieve them of their obligation to respond and grants the Plaintiff's motions. 

The Judge orders both Mahamud and SW Transport LLC to provide the requested discovery responses within 15 days and states that monetary sanctions are not warranted under the circumstances.
