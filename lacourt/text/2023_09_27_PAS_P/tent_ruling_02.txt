Case No.: 22AHCV00825
 
 
[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFF’S DISCOVERY MOTIONS
 
Date:   September
  27, 2023
Time:  8:30 a.m.
Dept.:  P



 
          
          
          This is a wrongful death action.
Plaintiff Egine Artinian sues for the death of her son, who died in an auto
accident on the 210 freeway September 7, 2021. She alleges that David Artinian’s
vehicle was involved in a collision with a truck negligently driven by
Defendant Bashir Mahamud. Mahamud is alleged to have been driving in his
capacity as an employee of Defendant SW Transport LLC, in a truck leased by Snider
Leasing Corp.
          All three defendants filed answers.
Mahamud and SW are represented by the same counsel. Snider has been dismissed. 
          Before the Court are five discovery motions: two set for
September 27, two for September 28, and one for September 29, 2023.  The September 28 and 29 hearing dates are
advanced to today’s date. The motions seek orders compelling Mahamud to provide
responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One, and Requests for Production of
Documents, Set One; and compelling SW to provide responses to Form
Interrogatories, Set One, and Requests for Production, Set One and Set Two. 
          Counsel for Mahamud and SW filed oppositions to each of the
motions. As for Mahamud, counsel avers that he has been unable to locate his
client despite engaging the efforts of Hub Investigators. As for SW, counsel explains
that its principal, someone named “Ranjit,” has not responded to counsel’s
attempts to obtain his cooperation in responding to this discovery. The gist of
the opposition briefs is that defense counsel is open to mediation and would
like to settle the action. This does not relieve Defendants of their obligation
to respond to discovery, however.
          Based on the evidence presented, Plaintiff is entitled to
the relief requested. However, under the circumstances the Court finds that the
imposition of monetary sanctions is not warranted.
          Defendant Mahamud is ordered to provide verified responses,
without objection, to Form Interrogatories, Set One, and Requests for
Production of Documents, Set One, within 15 days of notice of this order. 
          Defendant SW is ordered to provide verified responses,
without objection, to Form Interrogatories, Set One, and Requests for
Production, Set One and Set Two, within 15 days of notice of this order.
          Plaintiff is ordered to provide notice of this ruling.
