 Case Number:  22LBCV00968    Hearing Date:   July 2, 2024    Dept:  S25 BackgroundOn December 12, 2022, Plaintiff filed a complaint against Defendants Boys & Girls Clubs of America, Inc., Boys & Girls Clubs of the Los Angeles Harbor, Doe 1, and Does 2 to 100. The complaint contains a sole cause of action of negligence. Plaintiff alleges that he was sexually abused and molested by Doe 1 while attending Defendant Boys & Girls Clubs of the Los Angeles Harbor for athletic classes, to play basketball, complete his homework, play games and other activities from approximately 2009 through 2010. (Compl., ¶¶ 4, 32-26.) Plaintiff alleges he was in the 6th and/or 7th grade at 13 to 14 years old at the time of the sexual assault and abuse. (Compl., ¶¶ 32, 38.)On April 7, 2023, Defendant Boys & Girls Clubs of America, Inc., specially appearing, filed the instant motion to quash service of summons and complaint. On June 18, 2024, Plaintiff filed an opposition. On June 25, 2024, Defendant filed a reply.Legal Standard“…A defendant, on or before the last day of his or her time to plead or within any further time that the court may for good cause allow, may serve and file a notice of motion . . . [t]o quash service of summons on the ground of lack of jurisdiction of the court over him or her.” (Code of Civil Procedure section 418.10, subdivision (a).)“When a motion to quash is properly brought, the burden of proof is placed upon the plaintiff to establish the facts of jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence.” (Aquila, Inc. v. Superior Court (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 556, 568; see also Elkman v. National States Ins. Co. (2009) 173 Cal.App.4th 1305, 1312-13 [“Where a nonresident defendant challenges jurisdiction by way of a motion to quash, the plaintiff bears the burden of establishing by a preponderance of the evidence that minimum contacts exist between the defendant and the forum state to justify imposition of personal jurisdiction.”].)Evidence of the facts giving rise to personal jurisdiction or their absence may be in the form of declarations. (Arensen v. Raymond Lee Organization, Inc. (1973) 31 Cal.App.3d 991,995.) The Court should exclude evidence that would be inadmissible at trial. (See, e.g., Judd v. Superior Court (1976) 60 Cal.App.3d 38, 43-44 [Court of Appeal excluded inadmissible hearsay evidence offered in support of affirmation of trial court's denial of motion to quash, and subsequently reversed the trial court's denial].)Evidentiary ObjectionsThe Court rules on Plaintiff evidentiary objections to Specially Appearing Defendant’s Request for Judicial Notice as follows: Exhibits C1, C2, and E: Overruled: No. 1; Sustained: No. 2.The Court rules on Specially Appearing Defendant evidentiary objections to the Affidavit of Brett Ainsworth as follows: Sustained: Nos. 1-14. Statements from a human resource manager employed from an agency other than Defendant Los Angeles Harbor Club - from 2014 to 2018 – several years after the time of the alleged incidents in this pending matter -are improperly authenticated, constitute improper hearsay and are inapplicable to Los Angeles Harbor Club’s relationship to Specially Appearing Defendant.The Court rules on Specially Appearing Defendant’s evidentiary objections to evidence cited in Plaintiff’s Opposition as follows: Sustained: No. 15-17.Defendant’s Request Judicial NoticeSpecially Appearing Defendant’s Request for Judicial Notice is granted pursuant to Evidence Code, §§ 451, 452, subds. (d) and (h).RulingNo motion under Code of Civil Procedure 418.10 “shall be deemed a general appearance by the defendant.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 418.10(d).) Here, Specially Appearing Defendant (“Defendant”) brought this motion under section 418.10. Thus, filing this motion does not constitute a general appearance.“When a motion to quash is properly brought, the burden of proof is placed upon the plaintiff to establish the facts of jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence.” (Aquila, Inc. v. Sup. Ct. (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 556, 568; see also Elkman v. National States Ins. Co. (2009) 173 Cal.App.4th 1305, 1312-13 [“Where a nonresident defendant challenges jurisdiction by way of a motion to quash, the plaintiff bears the burden of establishing by a preponderance of the evidence that minimum contacts exist between the defendant and the forum state to justify imposition of personal jurisdiction.”].) Evidence of the facts giving rise to personal jurisdiction or their absence may be in the form of declarations. (Arensen v. Raymond Lee Organization, Inc. (1973) 31 Cal.App.3d 991, 995.) The Court should exclude evidence that would be inadmissible at trial. (See, e.g., Judd v. Superior Court (1976) 60 Cal.App.3d 38, 43-44 [Court of Appeal excluded inadmissible hearsay evidence offered in support of affirmation of trial court’s denial of motion to quash, and subsequently reversed the trial court’s denial].)“Due process permits state courts to exercise personal jurisdiction over nonresidents who have ‘minimum contacts' with the forum state. ‘Minimum contacts' means the relationship between the nonresident and the forum state is such that the exercise of jurisdiction does not offend “traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice” under the U.S. Constitution's Fourteenth Amendment Due Process Clause.” (Weil & Brown, Cal. Prac. Guide Civ. Pro. Before Trial §3:197 citations omitted.) A court may exercise such specific jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant “only if (1) the defendant purposely availed itself of the benefits of conducting activities in the forum state; (2) the controversy arises out of or is related to the defendant’s forum contacts; and (3) the exercise of jurisdiction would be fair and reasonable.” (HealthMarkets, Inc. v. Superior Court (2009) 171 Cal.App.4th 1160, 1167.)Specially Appearing Defendant is a federally chartered non-profit corporation domiciled in the District of Columbia with its principal place of business in Georgia. (Motion, Ex. B). The Charter, with the Constitution and Membership Requirements, (e.g. the governing documents) expressly confirm that the local club’s own board of directors and other leadership “shall have complete authority and control” over its operations, while Specially Appearing Defendant shall have “no authority whatsoever” over such matters. (Specially Appearing Defendant’s Exhs. B, C1, and C2; see also Art. IV, § 4.) Independent local clubs and the other organizational bodies such as Defendant Boys & Girls Clubs of the Los Angeles Harbor (“Defendant CLUB”) act as an independent local provider of services, maintaining its own domestic corporate autonomy over its operations, premises, and personnel. (See Exhs. D-1, D-2.) There is no evidence these two entities co-mingle assets, do not have ownership or asset overlap, utilize the same premises, or employ or have control over the same personnel.Based on the foregoing, the Court finds that Plaintiff has not demonstrated that Specially Appearing Defendant has purposefully availed itself of the benefits of the State of California, and therefore that the Court lacks specific jurisdiction over Specially Appearing Defendant.Accordingly, Specially Appearing Defendant’s Motion to Quash Service of Summons is GRANTED.
