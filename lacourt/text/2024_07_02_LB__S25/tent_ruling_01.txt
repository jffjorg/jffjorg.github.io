  Case Number:  22LBCV00367    Hearing Date:   July 2, 2024    Dept:  S25 BackgroundDefendant moves to stay these proceeding for the following reasons: (1) two writs are pending before two different appellate districts concerning the constitutionality of California Assembly Bill 218 (“AB 218”) and (2) Defendant hopes to engage in meaningful settlement negotiations without fear of violating the law by recommending/authorizing payments for any settlement agreement. In response, Plaintiff suggests (1) no legal support exists to mandate a stay in similar contexts and (2) staying the action would prejudice Plaintiff.Judicial NoticePursuant to Evidence Code §§ 451, 452, subds. (d) and (h), 453, Defendant’s request for judicial notice is granted as to Request Nos. 1 to 13.RulingThe crux of Long Beach Unified School District's position (and other similarly situated school districts) is that AB 218’s imposition of liability on public entities for past conduct where no enforceable claim existed is unconstitutional because it violates Article XVI, section 6 of the California Constitution (“Gift Clause”). While the Court appreciates there are unsettled and/or conflicting opinions concerning the constitutionality of AB 218, imposing a stay on this matter pending decision(s) from the higher courts is not only prejudicial to Plaintiff, but impractical. It is speculative that the 2nd Appellate District will find AB 218 unconstitutional and, regardless of the higher court’s rulings, it is likely any decision would be further appealed, thereby, resulting in years of delay in the adjudication of this and similar cases. Accordingly, Defendant’s motion is denied.
