And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling by a Judge in a case between the Plaintiff and several Defendants, including Boys & Girls Clubs of America, Inc. and Boys & Girls Clubs of the Los Angeles Harbor. The Plaintiff alleges that he was sexually abused and molested by Doe 1 while attending the Los Angeles Harbor club, and that the abuse occurred between 2009 and 2010. The Defendant has filed a motion to quash service of summons, arguing that the Court lacks jurisdiction over them. The Judge has ruled that the Plaintiff has not demonstrated that the Defendant has purposefully availed themselves of the benefits of the State of California, and therefore the Court lacks specific jurisdiction over the Defendant. The motion to quash is therefore granted.
