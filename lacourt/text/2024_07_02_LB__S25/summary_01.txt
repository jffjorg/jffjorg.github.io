And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to stay the proceedings, which was based on two pending writs before different appellate districts challenging the constitutionality of California Assembly Bill 218 (AB 218). The defendant argued that they wanted to engage in meaningful settlement negotiations without fear of violating the law. However, the judge found that imposing a stay would be both prejudicial to the plaintiff and impractical. The judge noted that there are unsettled and conflicting opinions on the constitutionality of AB 218, and that even if the higher courts ultimately find it unconstitutional, it is likely that the decision would be further appealed, leading to years of delay. Therefore, the judge has denied the motion to stay the proceedings.
