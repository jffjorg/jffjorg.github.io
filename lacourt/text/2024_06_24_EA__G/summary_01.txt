The application was filed on May 8, 2024, and the Court set an OSC Re: Why an Order to Sell Dwelling Should Not Be Made for June 24, 2024. However, the Court has denied the application without prejudice due to the untimely service of notice as required by Code of Civil Procedure section 704.770. Specifically, the Court found that the judgment creditor did not serve the judgment debtor with substitute service and then mail a copy of the notice to the judgment debtor at least thirty days before the hearing date. As a result, the Court concluded that Ji's application is denied without prejudice.
