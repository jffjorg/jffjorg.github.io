And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the demurrer to the complaint is overruled. The Plaintiff, Welk Jr., has standing to bring a derivative lawsuit against the defendants, Fredricks, et al., on behalf of The Welk Group. The complaint alleges that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties, engaged in unjust enrichment, and sought to prevent the Plaintiff from exercising his rights as a shareholder. The Judge finds that the Plaintiff has demonstrated that a demand on the board of directors would have been futile due to the conflicts of interest and misappropriation of corporate funds by the defendants. The Judge relies on the cases of Aronson v. Lewis and Apple Inc. v. Superior Court to support the finding.
