ANALYSIS:
 
On January 23, 2024, Plaintiff Interinsurance Exchange of
the Automobile Club (“Plaintiff”) served Form Interrogatories, Set One, on
Defendant Martha Rocha (“Defendant Rocha”). (Motion,
Tapper Decl., Exh. A.) Despite a meet and confer effort, to date,
Defendant Rocha has not served verified responses to the Form Interrogatories,
Set One. (Id. at ¶3 and Exh. B.) Plaintiff filed the instant Motion to
Compel Responses to Form Interrogatories Served on Martha Rocha and Request for
Sanctions, on June 17, 2024. No opposition has been filed to date. 
 
Based on Defendant Rocha’s failure to serve initial
responses to the discovery, the Motion to Compel Responses to Interrogatories,
are granted. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290.) There is no requirement for a prior
meet and confer effort before a motion to compel initial responses can be
filed. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290.) Furthermore, the motion can be brought at
any time after the responding party fails to provide the responses. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2030.290.) Therefore, Plaintiff is entitled to an order compelling
Defendant Rocha to serve verified responses to the interrogatories without
objections.
 
Defendant Rocha’s failure to timely respond constitutes a
misuse of the discovery process. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (d).)
Sanctions are appropriate under Code of Civil Procedure sections 2023.010 and
2023.030 and have been properly noticed. However, the amount sought is
excessive for simple and unopposed motions. Pursuant to a lodestar calculation,
sanctions are awarded against Defendant Rocha in the amount of $265.00 based on
one hour of attorney time billed at $225.00 per hour, plus the $40.00 filing
fee. (Motion, Tapper Decl., ¶4.)
 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiff Interinsurance Exchange of the Automobile Club’s
Motion to Compel Responses to Form Interrogatories Served on Martha Rocha and
Request for Sanctions, is GRANTED. DEFENDANT MARTHA ROCHA IS TO SERVE VERIFIED
RESPONSES TO THE INTERROGATORIES, WITHOUT OBJECTIONS, WITHIN 20 DAYS’ NOTICE OF
THIS ORDER. DEFENDANT ROCHA IS ORDERED TO PAY SANCTIONS OF $265.00 TO
PLAINTIFF’S COUNSEL WITHIN 20 DAYS’ NOTICE OF THIS ORDER.
