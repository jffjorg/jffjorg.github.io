ANALYSIS:
 
Plaintiff
Gizella Wade (“Plaintiff”) filed the instant action for habitability
violations, nuisance, negligence, and breach of contract against Defendants LA
Housing Solutions, LLC, Peerless Apartments, LLC, and Marc A. Schneider
(“Defendants”) on April 10, 2023. Defendants filed a Demurrer to, and Motion to
Strike Portions of, the Complaint on May 15, 2023. The Demurrer was sustained
with leave to amend on September 14, 2023 and the Motion to Strike was placed
off calendar. (Minute Order, 09/14/23.)
 
Plaintiff filed
the First Amended Complaint on October 2, 2023, alleging a single cause of
action for bad faith retention of security deposit in violation of Civil Code
section 1950.5. Defendant answered the First Amended Complaint on November 1,
2023. On February 26, 2024, the Court denied Defendant’s Motion for Judgment on
the Pleadings. (Minute Order, 02/26/24.) 
 
Plaintiff filed
the instant Motion for Summary Judgment, or in the alternative, Summary
Adjudication on May 22, 2024. Defendants filed an opposition on July 24, 2024
and Plaintiff replied on July 29, 2024.
 
Discussion
 
Procedural Requirements
 
A motion for summary judgment, or summary adjudication must be
accompanied by a separate statement. (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (b)(1) [“The
supporting papers shall include a separate statement setting forth plainly and
concisely all material facts that the moving party contends are undisputed.
Each of the material facts stated shall be followed by a reference to the
supporting evidence. The failure to comply with this requirement of a separate
statement may in the court's discretion constitute a sufficient ground for
denying the motion.”].) The California Rules of Court reiterate this
requirement and set forth the format in which the facts must be specified.
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1350(c)(2), (d).) The opposition papers are also
required to include a responsive separate statement. (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c,
subd. (b)(3); Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1350(e)(2).) 
 
Plaintiff’s moving papers failed to include a separate statement. The
separate statement was not filed or served until July 28, 2024. (Separate
Statement, filed 07/28/24, p. 49.) Plaintiff requests relief from this
inadvertent omission of the separate statement on the grounds that Defendants
have still been given notice of the issues to be addressed and a 30-day
continuance of the hearing would allow Defendants to review the separate
statement. The Court acknowledges its discretion to determine whether failure
to comply with the separate statement requirement is grounds to deny the
Motion. However, the moving and opposing separate statements are, from this
Court’s perspective, the most crucial documents on a motion for summary
judgment and/or adjudication. The separate statement sets up the parties’
positions with respect to the undisputed and disputed facts, which is the crux
of the summary judgment and/or adjudication determination. The Court cannot
rule on the instant Motion without considering the moving and opposing separate
statements. Plaintiff proposes a continuance of the hearing by 30 days to allow
Defendants to respond to the separate statement. The Court agrees this is an
appropriate way to address the inadvertent omission of that document. 
 
The opposition also
points out that Plaintiff’s memorandum of points and authorities does not
address her request for adjudication of Defendant’s affirmative defenses. In
reply, Plaintiff does not dispute that the request for summary adjudication is
not analyzed in the moving points and authorities. As Defendants point out,
Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1113(a) mandates the inclusion of a memorandum of
points and authorities. “The memorandum must contain a statement of
facts, a concise statement of the law, evidence and arguments relied on, and a
discussion of the statutes, cases, and textbooks cited in support of the
position advanced.” (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1113(b).) Indeed, Plaintiff’s
failure to provide a memorandum as required by the Rule is an “admission that
the [request] is without merit and cause for its denial.” (Cal. Rules of Court,
Rule 3.1113(a), (b); In re Marriage of Falcone & Fyke (2012) 203
Cal.App.4th 964, 976.) Accordingly, the
Court finds that the instant Motion is solely for summary judgment and denies
the alternative request for summary adjudication regarding Defendant’s
affirmative defenses.
