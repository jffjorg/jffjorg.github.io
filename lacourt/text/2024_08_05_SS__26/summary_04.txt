And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants National Commercial Recovery, Inc.'s motion to amend judgment. The motion is to add "Lindo Michoacan Anaheim Corporation dba Lindo Michoacan 2 adba Lindo Michoacan" as an additional judgment debtor. The Judge finds that this corporation is the successor-in-interest of Judgment Debtor Lindo Michoacan Corporation, based on evidence that they operate out of the same address, Judgment Debtor Martin is CEO and sole director, and there was no notice of intended bulk sale recorded. The Judge concludes that the judgment must be amended to add the correct name of the real defendant, and Judgment Creditor must file a proposed amended judgment within 20 days.
