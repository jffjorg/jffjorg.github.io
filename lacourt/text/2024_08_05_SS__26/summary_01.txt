And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding the motion to amend judgment filed by Lisa Davidson, the judgment creditor, against Rite Aid Corporation, the judgment debtor. The motion was filed on April 8, 2024, and was initially scheduled for hearing on June 3, 2024, but was continued due to lack of service of the papers and notice of hearing on the judgment debtor. The judge ordered the judgment creditor to file proof of service of all moving papers by July 8, 2024, but to date, no proof of service nor opposition has been filed. As a result, the judge has denied the motion to amend judgment.
