And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled to continue the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment to September 16, 2024, at 10:30 am in Department 26 of the Spring Street Courthouse. The defendants are required to file and serve an opposing separate statement by September 4, 2024. No further papers may be filed regarding this motion.

The judge's decision is based on the plaintiff's failure to include a separate statement with their moving papers, which is a required document for a motion for summary judgment. The judge agrees with the plaintiff's proposal to continue the hearing by 30 days to allow the defendants to respond to the separate statement.

Additionally, the judge finds that the plaintiff's request for summary adjudication of the defendant's affirmative defenses is not analyzed in the moving points and authorities, and therefore denies the alternative request for summary adjudication.
