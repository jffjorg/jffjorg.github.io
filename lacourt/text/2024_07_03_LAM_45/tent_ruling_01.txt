Background
            On
April 5, 2021, Plaintiff Don S. Kovacic (“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint against
Defendants Michael Clark; Palm Plaza Pet Hospital, LLC; Palm Plaza Pet
Hospital, Inc. (“Defendants”); and DOES 1 through 10, inclusive, alleging
causes of action for (1) Breach of Written Contract; (2) Account Stated; and
(3) Quantum Meruit. 
            On
June 15, 2021, Defendants filed their Answer. 
            The
bench trial was held on September 7, 2023, wherein the Court granted judgment
in favor of Plaintiff in the total amount of $944,342.68, consisting of (1)
$503,383.97 in principal damages and (2) $440,958.71 in interest at 12% per
annum from June 30, 2018 until entry of judgment. 
            On
April 18, 2024, Plaintiff filed this instant Motion for Attorney’s Fees. No
opposition has been filed. 
 
Legal
Standard
Civil Code
section 1717 provides in pertinent part: “(a) In any action on a contract,
where the contract specifically provides that attorney’s fees and costs, which
are incurred to enforce that contract, shall be awarded either to one of the
parties or to the prevailing party, then the party who is determined to be the
party prevailing on the contract, whether he or she is the party specified in
the contract or not, shall be entitled to reasonable attorney's fees in
addition to other costs. ... ¶ Reasonable attorney's fees shall be fixed by the
court, and shall be an element of the costs of suit.” (Civ. Code § 1717, subd.
(a).)
 
Discussion
            Plaintiff
contends he is the prevailing party in this action. Plaintiff further contends
the underlying contract between the parties provides an award of reasonable
attorney’s fees and costs to the prevailing party in an action arising out of
or to enforce any provision of the contract. (Blumberg Decl., Exh. 10.) On Page
7 of the subject contract, it provides the following: “The prevailing party in
any action or proceeding arising out of or to enforce any provision of this
Agreement, with the exception of a fee arbitration or mediation under Business
and Professions Code Sections 6200-6206, will be awarded reasonable attorneys’
fees and costs incurred in that actions or proceeding, or in the enforcement of
any judgment or award rendered.” (Ibid.) 
            Based
on the contract, the Court finds that Plaintiff is entitled to fees. 
            Plaintiff
requests $89,032.50 based on the total fees of $88,432.50 charged to and paid
by Mr. Kovacic in connection with the lawsuit, and the anticipated fees of $600
for the reply and appearance on this motion. Plaintiff attaches the relevant
invoices and billing entries for the matter, and the attorney-client agreement
requiring Mr. Kovacic to pay fees of $650 per hour for all time devoted to
trial, and $600 per hour for all other time devoted to his matter. (Blumberg
Decl., Exhs. A-B.) Counsel also provides his declaration confirming that the
fees charged in this matter total $88,432.50 and that he has personally
reviewed all the billing and invoices sent to Mr. Kovacic and they correctly
reflect the legal services rendered in the matter. (Blumberg Decl., ¶2.) 
            Defendant
has not opposed the motion, or the amount of fees requested. However, as the
motion is unopposed, the $600 in anticipated fees is unjustified. 
            Based
on the foregoing, the Court GRANTS the motion, and awards $88,432.50 in fees.  
            It
is so ordered.
