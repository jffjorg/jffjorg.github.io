Background
On March
16, 2022, Plaintiff Janusz Blicharski filed a complaint against Defendants 158
S. Elm, LLC, and 1751 Cabrillo, LLC, among others alleging causes of action for
(1) failure to pay overtime; (2) failure to pay sick time; (3) failure to pay
wages due in violation of Labor Code section 204(a); (4) inaccurate wage
statements; (5) failure to pay for rest periods not provided; (6) failure to
pay for meal periods not provided; (7) failure to page minimum wage; (8)
failure to pay prevailing wage; (9) waiting time penalties; (10) wrongful
termination in violation of public policy; (11) wrongful termination in
violation of Labor Code section 98.6; (12) age discrimination; (13) disability
discrimination; (14) failure to prevent discrimination; (15) failure to accommodate
physical disability; (16) failure to engage in good faith interactive process
in violation of Government Code section 12940(n); (17) failure to engage in
good faith interactive process in violation of Government Code section
12945(3); (18) refusal to provide information in violation of Labor Code
section 1198.5; (19) failure to reimburse employees for required business
expenses; and (20) unfair competition.
Plaintiff
alleges that he suffered a work-related injury to his left shoulder from
lifting a 50-pound bag, and a few days after the commencement of his medical
treatment, he was terminated of his employment by Defendants under the pretense
that there was no more work. Plaintiff alleges his termination was wrongfully motivated by
discrimination against him due to his injury. (Compl. ¶¶ 39, 41.)
Plaintiff also alleges that
Defendants engaged in a campaign to force Plaintiff to quit because they
decided he was too old to continue working. (Id., ¶ 43.) Defendants
demanded Plaintiff double his workload but refused to permit him any additional
time to complete his tasks. Defendant would then issue warnings, but they did
not make similar demands on younger employees. (Id., ¶ 43(a).)
Plaintiff also claims that
Defendants would complain about Plaintiff’s performance, holding him to a
different and higher performance standard than the younger employees. (Id.,
¶ 43(b).)
Plaintiff
also claims that
Plaintiff was denied bereavement time, vacation time, sick leave and other
employment benefits that were routinely granted to younger employees. (Id.,
¶ 43(c).)
On December 8, 2023, Plaintiff
filed this motion to enforce settlement. 
 
Legal Standard
Code of
Civil Procedure section 664.6 provides: 
“(a) [i]f
parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties
outside the presence of the court or orally before the court, for settlement of
the case, or part thereof, the court, upon motion, may enter judgment pursuant
to the terms of the settlement. If requested by the parties, the court may
retain jurisdiction over the parties to enforce the settlement until
performance in full of the terms of the settlement. 
(b) For purposes of this section,
a writing is signed by a party if it is signed by any of the following:
(1) The party.
(2) An attorney who represents the party.
(3) If the party is an insurer, an agent who is authorized in writing by the
insurer to sign on the insurer's behalf.” 
Strict compliance
with the statutory requirements is necessary before a court can enforce a
settlement agreement under this statute.  (Sully-Miller Contracting Co.
v. Gledson/Cashman Construction, Inc. (2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 30, 37.) 
Before an amendment was effective on January 1, 2021, “parties”
under section 664.6 meant the litigants themselves, not their attorneys. 
(See Levy v. Superior Court (1995) 10 Cal.4th 578, 586.)  The
settlement had to include the signatures of the parties seeking to enforce the
agreement and against whom enforcement is sought.  (J.B.B. Investment
Partners, Ltd. v. Fair (2014) 232 Cal.App.4th 974, 985.) 
 
The existence of a contract
“requires parties capable of contracting, their consent, a lawful object, and a
sufficient cause of consideration.”  (J.B.B. Investment Partners Ltd.
v. Fair (2019) 37 Cal.App.5th 1, 9 [citing Civ. Code, § 1550].) 
Consent requires an offer and acceptance.  (DeLeon v. Verizon Wireless,
LLC (2012) 207 Cal.App.4th 800, 813.)  
  
If the settlement leaves
material terms wanting, or confusing, the settlement cannot be enforced through
the section 664.6 summary proceeding and must be addressed in a separate civil
action.  (Compare Terry v. Conlan (2005) 131 Cal.App.4th 1445
[finding parties never agreed to the means that were material to the
settlement, including what role an independent manager was to play regarding
management of a trust property, and whether the trust should be qualified as a QTIP,
thereby indicating that there was no meeting of the minds as to the material
terms] with Osumi v. Sutton (2007) 151 Cal.App.4th 1355 [holding trial
court’s decision to extend closing date for vendor’s agreement to repurchase
house did not create a material term and was within court’s power because the
closing date had passed by the time the motions came on for hearing and a new
closing date was necessary to grant the relief sought by both parties].) 
 
Discussion
Plaintiff moves to enforce a
settlement between Plaintiff and Defendants 158 S. Elm, LLC and 1751 Cabrillo,
LLC. Plaintiff argues that the parties reached a settlement of the Action
during a Mandatory Settlement conference held on June 8, 2023, which Plaintiff
contends was formalized in a Settlement Agreement and Release At Mandatory
Settlement Conference (the “Settlement Agreement”) which was executed by
Plaintiff on June 27, 2023 and forwarded to Defendants’ counsel on June 29,
2023. (Schelly Decl., ¶ 2.) 
Plaintiff argues the Settlement
Agreement expressly requires that Defendants make their settlement payment to
Plaintiff “within 30 days of Plaintiff’s execution of the Release.” Moreover,
Plaintiff argues, the Settlement Agreement provides that “should any party to
this Agreement need to institute any legal action to enforce the Agreement, the
prevailing party shall be entitled to its attorney’s fees and costs.” (Id.,
¶ 3.)
Plaintiff further states that at
the Court’s August 21, 2023 Order to Show Cause hearing, Defendant’s counsel
told this Court that they needed more time to finalize the settlement. Since
that day, Plaintiff’s counsel has attempted to contact defense counsel
regarding the settlement via telephone and email without response. (Id.,
¶ 4.)
As noted above, strict
compliance with the statutory requirements is necessary before a court can
enforce a settlement agreement under this statute.  (Sully-Miller
Contracting Co., supra, 103 Cal.App.4th 30, 37.) Plaintiff has not
provided the purported settlement agreement to the court in order for the court
to review it. Moreover, Code of Civil Procedure
section 664.6 requires a writing signed by the parties. Plaintiff does not
state that Defendants’ counsel or Defendants have signed the writing, only that
it was executed by Plaintiff and forwarded to Defendants’ counsel. As such, the
court cannot enforce the purported settlement agreement under Code of Civil
Procedure section 664.6 if it is not signed by both parties.
 
            Based
on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s motion to enforce the
settlement agreement is DENIED without prejudice.
 
            It
is so ordered.
