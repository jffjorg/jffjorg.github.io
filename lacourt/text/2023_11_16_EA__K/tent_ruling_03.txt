1.         Demurrer to FAC
Legal Standard
A demurrer may be made on the grounds that
the pleading, inter alia, does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause
of action. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (e).)
When considering
demurrers, courts read the allegations liberally and in context. In a demurrer
proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via
proper judicial notice. (Donabedian v.
Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) “A demurrer tests the
pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters. Therefore, it
lies only where the defects appear on the face of the pleading or are
judicially noticed.” (SKF Farms v. Superior Court (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d
902, 905 [citations omitted].) At the pleading stage, a plaintiff need only
allege ultimate facts sufficient to apprise the defendant of the factual basis
for the claim against him. (Semole v.
Sansoucie (1972) 28 Cal. App. 3d 714, 721.) “[A] demurrer does not,
however, admit contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law alleged in
the pleading, or the construction placed on an instrument pleaded therein, or
facts impossible in law, or allegations contrary to facts of which a court may
take judicial knowledge.” (S. Shore Land
Co. v. Petersen (1964) 226 Cal.App.2d 725, 732 [citations omitted].)
Discussion
Defendant demurs to
the first and second causes of action in Plaintiff’s FAC, on the basis that they
both fail to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.
At the outset, the
court notes that Plaintiff represents in opposition that he “is agreeable to
withdraw his second cause of action from the FAC.” (Opp., 9:17-18). The court
will summarily sustain Defendant’s demurrer to the second cause of action,
without leave, based on the foregoing statement.
The sole remaining cause of action that is the subject of the
instant demurrer, then, is the first cause of action for Fraud and Deceit. “The
elements of fraud, which give rise to the tort action for deceit, are (a)
misrepresentation (false representation, concealment, or nondisclosure); (b)
knowledge of falsity (or 'scienter'); (c) intent to defraud, i.e., to induce
reliance; (d) justifiable reliance; and (e) resulting damage.” (Lazar v.
Superior Court (1996) 12 Cal.4th 631, 638 [quotations and
citation omitted].)
“[F]raud must be pled specifically; general and conclusory
allegations do not suffice.” (Id. at 645). The “particularity requirement
necessitates pleading facts which
show how, when, where, to whom, and by what means the representations were
tendered.” (Id. [internal quotations and citation omitted].)
Additionally, “[t]he requirement of specificity in a fraud action against a
corporation requires the plaintiff to allege the names of the persons who made
the allegedly fraudulent representations, their authority to speak, to whom
they spoke, what they said or wrote, and when it was said or written.” (Tarmann
v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. (1991) 2 Cal.App.4th 153,
157.)
Further, “[a]fter establishing actual reliance, the plaintiff
must show that the reliance was reasonable by showing that (1) the matter was
material in the sense that a reasonable person would find it important in
determining how he or she would act; and (2) it was reasonable for the
plaintiff to have relied on the misrepresentation.” (Hoffman v. 162 North
Wolfe LLC (2014) 228 Cal.App.4th 1178, 1194.)
Plaintiff alleges
that sometime prior to November 2020, Plaintiff saw the subject vehicle
advertised on Defendant’s official webpage at the price of $72,860.00 and
wanted to purchase it at that price (FAC, ¶¶ 13-15); that on or about November
21, 2020, he went to Defendant dealership (Id., ¶ 16); that Defendant’s
representatives verbally represented to Plaintiff that the subject vehicle had
a $25,000.00 markup and that it was mandatory for Plaintiff to additionally
acquire optional products and/or service contracts totaling $7,897.00 (Id.,
¶ 57(a)); and that he signed a written Retail Installment Sales Contract
(“RISC”) for the purchase of the subject vehicle that same day (Id., ¶
22.)
Plaintiff alleges
that Defendant had a “scheme” which was “designed to induce consumers to
purchase and/or lease vehicles, silently await in hopes that the consumer does
not notice the fact that the vehicle is sold and/or leased above the advertised
price and with optional products and/or services and lie to consumers about the
vehicles’ price and optional products and/or services” (Id., ¶ 45).
Plaintiff alleges that he would have never agreed to purchase the subject
vehicle had he known about this scheme, the subject vehicle’s grossly inflated
price and his right to refuse to pay for the optional products and/or services.
(Id., ¶¶ 38 and 46; see also, ¶ 61(4) [“Plaintiff reasonably relief on
Defendant’s assurances that he would purchase the Subject Vehicle for the
advertised price. Subsequently, he relied on Defendant’s assurances that the
optional products/services were mandatory”].).
The RISC attached as
Exhibit A to the FAC, however, states that the subject vehicle has a cash price
of $97,860.00 and that there is an optional service contract for $6,998.00 and
an optional debt cancellation agreement for $899.00. The RISC also contains a
clause reading, “YOU AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS CONTRACT. YOU CONFIRM THAT
BEFORE YOU SIGNED THIS CONTRACT, WE GAVE IT TO YOU, AND YOU WERE GREE TO TAKE
IT AND REVIEW IT. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ BOTH SIDES OF THIS
CONTRACT. . . BEFORE SIGNING BELOW. YOU CONFIRM THAT YOU RECEIVED A COMPLETELY
FILLED-IN COPY WHEN YOU SIGNED IT.” The RISC is signed by Plaintiff and
Defendant and is dated November 21, 2020.
“Where facts appearing in attached exhibits or judicially
noticed documents contradict, or are inconsistent with, the complaint's
allegations, we must rely on the facts in the exhibits and judicially noticed
documents.” (Genis v.
Schainbaum (2021) 66 Cal.App.5th 1007, 1015.) The RISC reflects that the
$97,860.00 cash price and the optional nature of the optional add-on
products/services were, in fact, disclosed in writing to Plaintiff prior to his
purchase of the subject vehicle. Further, Plaintiff could not have reasonably
relied on any alleged oral misrepresentations at the time of the sale because
he was provided the terms of the contract in writing prior to signing and
proceeded to sign the written contract. “[W]hen a plaintiff asserts that the
defendant misrepresented the nature of the contract, the contract is not
considered void due to the fraud if the plaintiff had a reasonable opportunity
to discover the true terms of the contract. The contract is only considered
void when the plaintiff's failure to discover the true nature of the
document executed was without negligence on the plaintiff's part.” (Brown v.
Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (2008) 168 Cal.App.4th 938, 958-959.)
Defendant’s demurrer to the first cause of action is
sustained.
2.         Motion to Strike Portions of FAC
Legal Standard
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 436, “the court may, upon a
motion made pursuant to Section 435, or at any time in its discretion, and upon
terms it deems proper: (a) Strike out any irrelevant, false, or improper matter
inserted in any pleading. (b) Strike out all or any part of any pleading not
drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of this state, a court rule, or an
order of the court.”
The grounds for a motion to strike must “appear on the face of the
challenged pleading or from any matter of which the court is required to take
judicial notice.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 437.)
Discussion
Defendant moves the
court for an order striking out the following portions of Plaintiff’s FAC:
1.                 
All
references to punitive damages, including Page 9, ¶ 51; Page 18, ¶ 68 and Page
34, ¶ 146(d); and 
2.                 
All
references to alleged complaints by unknown persons who are not parties to this
action, including Pages 8-9, ¶44; Page 13, ¶ 61 and Page 16, ¶ 63(2).
At the outset, the
instant motion is denied as moot with respect to Page 18, ¶ 68, Page 13, ¶ 61
and Page 16, ¶ 63(2), based on the ruling made on the demurrer. The court will
deny as moot the references to punitive damages contained in Page 9, ¶ 51 and
Page 34, ¶ 146(d) as well, inasmuch as it appears Plaintiff seeks punitive
damages solely in connection with his Fraud and Deceit cause of action. (See
Opp., 6:10-12).
The motion is
otherwise granted (i.e., as to Pages 8-9, ¶44). Plaintiff does not purport to
have personally experienced any of the alleged events described in the three
online complaints, which were made by unknown persons. The language is stricken
as irrelevant.
