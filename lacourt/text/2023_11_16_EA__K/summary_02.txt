And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied Spectrum Global Enterprises, Inc.'s motion for reconsideration of the court's previous order granting Petitioner Creditor's Adjustment Bureau, Inc.'s petition to confirm a contractual arbitration award. The motion was filed under Code of Civil Procedure ยง 1008, subdivision (a), which allows a party to seek reconsideration of an order if they can demonstrate new or different facts, circumstances, or law. However, the judge found that Spectrum failed to identify any new or different facts, circumstances, or law that would warrant reconsideration, and that the motion was based on a contention that the court misinterpreted the law in its initial ruling, which is not a valid basis for reconsideration. The judge also noted that the parties had an opportunity to present their arguments at oral argument and that the motion was taken under submission after hearing.
