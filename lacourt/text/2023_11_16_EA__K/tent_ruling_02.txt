 Case Number:  22PSCP00408    Hearing Date:   November 16, 2023    Dept:  K Respondent Spectrum
Global Enterprises, Inc.’s Motion for Reconsideration is DENIED. 
Background   
On August 18, 2022, Petitioner Creditor’s Adjustment Bureau, Inc. (“Petitioner”), as assignee of SIIC Shanghai International Trade
(Group) Co., Ltd., filed a “Petition to Confirm Contractual Arbitration Award”
(“First Petition”) as against Respondent Spectrum Global Enterprises, Inc. (“Spectrum”).
On October 27, 2022, the court denied the First Petition
without prejudice.
On March 24, 2023, Petitioner filed the instant petition
(“Amended Petition”). On September 18, 2023, the court granted the Amended Petition.
Legal
Standard
“When an application for an order has been made to a judge, or to a
court, and refused in whole or in part, or granted, or granted conditionally,
or on terms, any party affected by the order may, within 10 days after service
upon the party of written notice of entry of the order and based upon new or
different facts, circumstances, or law, make application to the same judge or
court that made the order, to reconsider the matter and modify, amend, or
revoke the prior order. The party making the application shall state by
affidavit what application was made before, when and to what judge, what order
or decisions were made, and what new or different facts, circumstances, or law
are claimed to be shown.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1008, subd. (a).)
The legislative intent was to restrict motions for reconsideration to
circumstances where a party offers the court some fact or circumstance not
previously considered, and some valid reason for not offering it earlier. (Gilberd v. AC Transit (1995) 32
Cal.App.4th 1494, 1500; Mink v. Sup. Ct.
(Arnel Develop. Co., Inc.) (1992) 2 Cal.App.4th 1338, 1342; Baldwin v. Home Sav. of America (1997)
59 Cal.App.4th 1192, 1198.) “The burden under section 1008 is
comparable to that of a party seeking a new trial on the ground of newly
discovered evidence: the information must be such that the moving party could
not, with reasonable diligence, have discovered or produced it at the trial.” (New York Times Co. v. Superior Court (2005)
135 Cal.App.4th 206, 212-213.)
Discussion
Spectrum moves the
court, per Code of Civil Procedure § 1008, subdivision (a), to reconsider its
September 18, 2023 order granting Petitioner’s Petition to Confirm Contractual
Arbitration Award.
At the outset, the court notes that no exhibits are attached to the
Declaration of James A. Kim (“Kim”), as represented.
Kim attests that the motion is based on “additional facts not available
to the moving party at the time of the hearing.” (Kim Decl., ¶ 2). Kim advises
that because the court ordered both sides to submit supplemental briefs on the
same date, “there was no opportunity to present the authorities in response to
the arguments raised by Petitioner, that is beyond the scope of issues the
Court requested briefing on.” (Id., ¶ 5). Kim fails to provide the court
with any further information. Spectrum,
then, has failed to identify any “new or different facts, circumstances, or
law” it believes warrant reconsideration.
Additionally, ecourt reflects that the motion originally came on calendar
for hearing on June 5, 2023; at that time, the court continued the hearing to
September 6, 2023 and ordered the parties to simultaneously file and exchange
further briefing nine court days prior to the continued hearing date. The parties
submitted supplemental briefing on August 23, 2023. The court’s September 6,
2023 minute order reflects that a tentative ruling was posted for that day’s
proceeding and that the motion was heard and “argued at length” before it was
taken under submission. Counsel, then, was clearly provided an opportunity at
oral argument to respond to Petitioner’s supplemental brief.
Reconsideration may not be based on the contention that the court
misinterpreted the law in its initial ruling, inasmuch as that is not a “new”
or “different” matter. (Gilberd v. AC Transit (1995) 32 Cal.App.4th
1494, 1500.)
