CASE NO.:  23NWCV01259
HEARING:   10/4/23 @ 9:30 AM

Defendant’s motion to compel arbitration and stay
proceedings is DENIED.
Plaintiff to give NOTICE.
 
Defendant Ensign Whittier West, LLC (Defendant)
move to compel arbitration and stay proceedings.
Background
Plaintiff Brian Phapornchai, individually and in
his capacity as successor in interest to Chuleeporn Phapornchai (Decedent) filed
a Complaint against Defendants Ensign Whittier West, LLC and PIH Whittier
Hospital for the wrongful death of his mother. 

Legal Standard
Parties may be compelled to arbitrate a dispute
upon the court finding that: (1) there was a valid agreement to arbitrate
between the parties; and (2) said agreement covers the controversy or
controversies in the parties’ dispute.¿(Omar v. Ralphs Grocery Co.
(2004)¿118 Cal.App.4th 955, 961.) A party moving to compel arbitration has the
burden of establishing the existence of a valid agreement to arbitrate and the
party opposing the petition has the burden of proving, by a preponderance of
the evidence, any fact necessary to its defense. (Banner Entertainment, Inc.
v. Superior Court¿(1998) 62 Cal.App.4th 348, 356-357.)
Discussion
Here, Defendant has failed to satisfy its
burden of proving the existence of an arbitration agreement because Defendant
has not produced any evidence that Plaintiff had actual or ostensible authority
to act as Decedent’s agent. "The party seeking to compel arbitration does
not meet its burden of proving the existence of an arbitration agreement when
it does not present any evidence that the purported principal's conduct caused
the agent or the third party to believe that the agent had the authority to
bind the principal." (Rogers v. Roseville SH, LLC (2022) 75 Cal.App.5th
1065, 1075.) Here, Defendant has introduced only evidence of Plaintiff’s
assertion in the arbitration agreement that he had authority to sign on
Decedent’s behalf. Just as in Kinder v. Capistrano Beach Care Center, LLC
(2023) 91 Cal.App.5th 804 813, courts have consistently rejected agency when
the only evidence is the agent’s “purported certification in the arbitration
agreement that they were ‘authorized to act as Resident’s agent in executing
and delivering of [sic] this arbitration agreement.’” Thus, Defendant has
failed to satisfy its burden of proving the existence of an arbitration
agreement.
 
Accordingly, Defendant’s
motion to compel arbitration and stay proceedings is DENIED.
