```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to compel arbitration and stay proceedings. The defendant failed to produce evidence of an arbitration agreement between the parties, and the only evidence presented was the plaintiff's assertion of authority to sign on behalf of the decedent. The court has consistently rejected agency claims when the only evidence is the agent's self-certification in the arbitration agreement. Therefore, the defendant has failed to satisfy its burden of proving the existence of an arbitration agreement, and the motion is denied.
