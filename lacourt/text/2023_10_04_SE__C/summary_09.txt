And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to compel arbitration and stay proceedings. The defendant failed to produce evidence of an arbitration agreement between the parties, and the only evidence presented was the plaintiff's assertion of authority to sign on behalf of the decedent. The court has consistently rejected agency claims when the only evidence is the agent's self-certification in the arbitration agreement. Therefore, the defendant has failed to satisfy its burden of proving the existence of an arbitration agreement, and the motion is denied.

## English Text Summary

This is a tentative ruling by a judge in a wrongful death case. The defendant, Ensign Whittier West, LLC, is trying to force the plaintiff, Brian Phapornchai, into arbitration instead of going to court.  

The judge is denying the defendant's request because the defendant hasn't proven that Brian Phapornchai had the authority to enter into an arbitration agreement on behalf of his deceased mother, Chuleeporn Phapornchai. The judge states that simply claiming authority in the agreement is not enough; there needs to be evidence that the defendant believed Brian had the authority to act.

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling denying the defendant's motion to compel arbitration and stay proceedings. The defendant, Ensign Whittier West, LLC, had moved to compel arbitration and stay the proceedings in a wrongful death lawsuit filed by the plaintiff, Brian Phapornchai, against the defendant and PIH Whittier Hospital. The defendant argued that there was a valid arbitration agreement between the parties, but the court found that the defendant had failed to produce any evidence that the plaintiff had actual or ostensible authority to sign the arbitration agreement on behalf of the decedent. The court relied on several precedents, including Omar v. Ralphs Grocery Co. and Rogers v. Roseville SH, LLC, to conclude that the defendant had failed to meet its burden of proving the existence of an arbitration agreement. As a result, the court denied the defendant's motion to compel arbitration and stay proceedings.
