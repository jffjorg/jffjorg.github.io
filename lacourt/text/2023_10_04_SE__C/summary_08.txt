English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge in a case involving a motion to compel arbitration and stay proceedings between plaintiff Michelle Baik, Diego Kim, and defendant Kaiser Foundation Hospital. The plaintiffs claim negligent infliction of emotional distress arising from the birth of their child at one of the defendant's facilities. The defendant has submitted an arbitration agreement with the California Public Employees Retirement System (CalPERS), which was acting as the plaintiffs' agent. The court finds that the defendant has satisfied its burden of proving the existence of an arbitration agreement. The plaintiffs argue that the defendant did not comply with Health and Safety Code § 1363.1, but the court finds that Government Code § 22869 provides that the health plan information provided by CalPERS each year satisfies the requirements for notice. Therefore, the court grants the defendant's motion to compel arbitration and stay proceedings, and orders the defendant to give notice of the arbitration.
