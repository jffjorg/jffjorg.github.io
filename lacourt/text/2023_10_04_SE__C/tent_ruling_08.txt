Defendant’s
motion to compel arbitration and stay proceedings is GRANTED.
Moving Party to give NOTICE.
 
Defendant Kaiser Foundation Hospitals’
(Defendant) moves to compel arbitration and stay the action.
Background
Plaintiffs
Michelle Baik and Diego Kim (Plaintiffs) claim negligent infliction of
emotional distress arising from the birth of Plaintiffs’ child at one of Defendant’s
facilities. 
Legal
Standard
Parties
may be compelled to arbitrate a dispute upon the court finding that: (1) there
was a valid agreement to arbitrate between the parties; and (2) said agreement
covers the controversy or controversies in the parties’ dispute.¿(Omar v.
Ralphs Grocery Co. (2004)¿118 Cal.App.4th 955, 961.) A party moving to
compel arbitration has the burden of establishing the existence of a valid
agreement to arbitrate and the party opposing the petition has the burden of
proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, any fact necessary to its defense.
(Banner Entertainment, Inc. v. Superior Court¿(1998) 62 Cal.App.4th 348,
356-357.)
Discussion
Defendant has satisfied its burden of proving
the existence of an arbitration agreement because it has submitted the
arbitration agreement between itself and the California Public Employees
Retirement System (CalPERS), which was acting as Plaintiffs’ agent. CalPERS
agreed to the contract through its authority pursuant to Government Code §§
22774, 22790, and 22793. Therefore, Defendant has satisfied its burden of
proving the existence of an arbitration agreement.
Plaintiff argues that Defendant did not comply
with Health and Safety Code § 1363.1 (relating to disclosure of binding
arbitration).  However, Government Code §
22869 provides that the health plan information provided by CalPERS each year
satisfies the requirements for notice. Thus, Plaintiff has failed to prove that
Defendant did not comply with Health and Safety Code § 1363.1. 
Stay Action
“If a court of competent jurisdiction, whether
in this State or not, has ordered arbitration of a controversy which is an
issue involved in an action or proceeding pending before a court of this State,
the court in which such action or proceeding is pending shall, upon motion of a
party to such action or proceeding, stay the action or proceeding until an
arbitration is had in accordance with the order to arbitrate or until such
earlier time as the court specifies.” (CCP § 1281.4.)
Defendant also moves to stay the action pending
the resolution of arbitration. The action is stayed pursuant to CCP § 1281.4.
 
Accordingly, Defendant’s
motion to compel arbitration and stay proceedings is GRANTED.
