CASE NO.:  20NWCV00249
HEARING:   10/4/23 @ 9:30 AM
#1
 
Defendants’ Motion to Enforce Settlement is
DENIED.
Plaintiff to give NOTICE.
 
Defendants move for an order enforcing the
terms of a settlement agreement signed outside the presence of the court.
Background
Plaintiff
Heriberto Parrilla filed a Complaint against Defendants for labor violations
and wrongful termination.
Legal
Standard
“If
parties to pending litigation stipulate, in writing signed by the parties
outside the presence of the court or orally before the court, for settlement of
the case, or part thereof, the court upon motion, may enter judgment pursuant
to the terms of the settlement.” (CCP § 664.6.)
Discussion

Here, the settlement agreement produced by
Defendants was signed outside the presence of the Court and does not contain a
stipulation pursuant to CCP § 664.6. Thus, the Court cannot enforce the
settlement.
 
Accordingly, Defendants’
Motion to Enforce Settlement is DENIED.
