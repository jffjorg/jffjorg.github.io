Background
Plaintiff
filed a Complaint against Defendants City Plumbing Inc., Jeana Feolo, and Chad
McComb (collectively Defendants) for breach of contract. The parties entered
into a Settlement Agreement and signed a stipulation for the Court to retain
jurisdiction to enforce the Settlement Agreement.
Legal
Standard
“If
parties to pending litigation stipulate, in writing signed by the parties outside
the presence of the court or orally before the court, for settlement of the
case, or part thereof, the court upon motion, may enter judgment pursuant to
the terms of the settlement.” (CCP § 664.6.)

to maintain jurisdiction pursuant to CCP § 664.6 which was granted on July 20,
2021. Defendants stopped making payments under the Settlement Agreement on
September 29, 2022 with $13,357 outstanding. (Zullo Decl., ¶ 4 and Ex. 2.) Plaintiff
requests prejudgment interest pursuant to Civil Code § 3287(a) calculated at
$3.6595 per day from September 29, 2022 to the date of the hearing (370 days).
Plaintiff requests $700.00 in attorneys’ fees pursuant to enforcing the
Settlement Agreement. (Settlement Agreement 13g.) 
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff
Motion to Enforce Settlement is GRANTED. Judgment shall be entered in favor of
Plaintiff and against Defendants, jointly and severally, in the principal sum
of $13,357.00 plus $1,354.02 in prejudgment interest and $700.00 for attorneys’
