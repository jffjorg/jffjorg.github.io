And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling denies the defendants' motion to enforce a settlement agreement signed outside the presence of the court. The plaintiff, Heriberto Parrilla, filed a complaint against defendants City Wide Transportation and others for labor violations and wrongful termination. The settlement agreement does not contain a stipulation under California Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6, which requires a written agreement signed by both parties or an oral agreement made before the court. Therefore, the court cannot enforce the settlement. The motion is denied, and the plaintiff is required to give notice.
