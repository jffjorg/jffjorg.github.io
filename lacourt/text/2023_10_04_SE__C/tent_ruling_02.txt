Defendant Equity Smart Home Loan Inc.’s
Motions to Compel Further Responses are GRANTED in part and DENIED in part.
Moving Party to give NOTICE.
 
Defendant Equity Smart Home Loans, Inc. (“Equity
Smart”) moves for an order compelling further responses to its discovery
requests.
Background
Plaintiff
Alfonso Ruano filed a Complaint against Equity Smart and Pablo Martinez for
breach of contract. Equity Smart filed a Cross-Complaint against Plaintiff
alleging breach of contract, interference, conversion, and unfair business
practices for alleged violation of an exclusivity contract signed by Plaintiff
in March 2019.
Legal
Standard
CCP
§ 2031.310 allows a party to file a motion compelling further answers to
document requests if it finds that the response is inadequate, incomplete, or
evasive, or an objection in the response is without merit or too general.  The motion shall be accompanied with a meet
and confer declaration.  (CCP §
2031.310(b).)  
Discussion

Form Interrogatories
Equity Smart seeks to compel further responses
to Form Interrogatories Nos. 2.2, 2.5, 2.6, 9.1, 9.2, 15.1, and 17.1. Plaintiff
agrees in his opposition to supplement Nos. 9.1, 9.2, and 15.1. Plaintiff’s
responses to 17.1 will be covered with the Motion for Further Responses to
Requests for Admission.
Plaintiff objected to Nos. 2.2, 2.5, and 2.6,
which seek basic background information regarding the party, on privacy
grounds. Plaintiff’s privacy objections are overruled. Thus, Plaintiff is
ordered to provide further responses to Form Interrogatories Nos. 2.2, 2.5, and
2.6.
Special Interrogatories
Plaintiff served further responses to Equity
Smart’s Special Interrogatories on August 2, 2023 which renders this Motion
moot. (Dominguez Decl., Ex. 1.)
Requests for Admission
Equity Smart seeks to compel further responses
to Requests for Admissions Nos. 19-37 and the accompanying Form Interrogatory
No. 17.1. Plaintiff objected to each Request on the grounds that it is
irrelevant, unintelligible, repetitive of other Requests, burdensome and
oppressive, violates the attorney work-product doctrine, and seeks privileged
information.
Plaintiff’s responses to each Request are
improper. Plaintiff’s unintelligible objections are overruled because “where the question is somewhat ambiguous, but the nature
of the information sought is apparent, the proper solution is to provide an
appropriate response.” (Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) 84 Ca.3d 771, 783.)
Further, “[i]f only a part of a request for admission is objectionable, the
remainder of the request shall be answered.” (CCP § 2033.230.) Thus, Equity
Smart’s requests to compel further responses to Requests Nos. 19-37 are
granted. Additionally, Plaintiff is ordered to provide further responses to the
correspondent Form Interrogatory 17.1.
Additionally, Equity Smart seeks to compel
further responses to Form Interrogatory No 17.1 as to Requests Nos. 1 and 7.
Request No. 1 requests that Plaintiff admit that Mr. Martinez did not give
Plaintiff an ownership interest in Equity Smart. Plaintiff responded “Pablo
Martinez agreed to transfer ownership interest in [Equity Smart] through a
merger agreement between he and [Plaintiff]” to subpart (b) and “[d]ocuments
will be identified in responses to demand for production of documents.”
Plaintiff’s response is insufficient because it does not identify the merger
agreement. Further, Plaintiff must refer to Section 2030.230 and “specify the
writings” “in sufficient detail” to supplement its response to interrogatories
with attached documents. (CCP § 2030.230.) Plaintiff states that he will
supplement his response to subpart (c). Thus, Equity Smart’s requests to compel
further responses to Form Interrogatories No. 17.1 for Requests for Admission
No. 1 and 7 are granted.
Requests for Production
Equity Smart seeks to compel further responses
to Requests for Production Nos. 1, 2, 4, 5, 8-10, 12, and 13. 
As to all Requests Plaintiff is ordered to
supplement his responses by identifying “with particularity any document …
falling within any category of item in the demand to which an objection is
being made.”  (CCP § 2031.240(b)(1).)
Plaintiff states that he will produce
responsive documents to Nos. 1, 2, 4, and 5 prior to the hearing. However, he
is ordered to supplement his responses to comply with the Code. He must identify
each document with the specific request number it responds to. (CCP §
2031.280.)
Plaintiff’s objections to failure to provide
notice under CCP § 1985.3(b)(3) as to Nos. 8 and 9 are overruled because the
Section applies to subpoenas and not Requests for Production. Thus, Plaintiff
is ordered to provide a further response to Requests Nos. 8 and 9.
Plaintiff’s relevancy objection to No. 10 is
overruled because documents related to “any monies YOU received from HOMEFIRST
from August 2018 through March 2020” are reasonably calculated to lead to the
discovery of admissible evidence to prove the Cross-Complaint’s allegations that
Plaintiff breached the exclusivity agreement which was entered on March 2019. Thus,
Plaintiff is ordered to provide a further response to Request No. 10.
Plaintiff’s unintelligibility objection to
Requests Nos. 12 and 13 is overruled because a person, especially an attorney,
knows what documents the party identified in their response to interrogatories.
Thus, Plaintiff is ordered to provide further responses to Requests Nos. 12 and
13.
Sanctions
The court shall impose a monetary sanction
against the party who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel
further responses to interrogatories or demand for production of documents
unless the party subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification
or the sanction would otherwise be unjust. (Code of Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300(d),
2031.310(h), and 2033.290(d).)  
Equity Smart seeks sanctions against Plaintiff
and his counsel of record for each of its four motions in the total amount of $8,880.00
consisting of four hours of meeting and conferring, ten hours preparing the
four motions, and six hours reviewing the oppositions, preparing replies, and
attending the hearing at a rate of $420 per hour and $240.00 for the filing
fees for each motion. The Court grants Equity Smart’s request in the reduced
amount of $7,200.00.
 
Accordingly, Equity
Smart’s Motions are GRANTED in part and DENIED in part as set forth above. Equity
Smart is to provide further responses within 30 days of this Order. Equity
Smart’s request for sanctions is GRANTED against Plaintiff and his counsel of
record, jointly and severally, in the reduced amount of $7,200.00. The sanction
is to be paid within 30 days of this Order.
