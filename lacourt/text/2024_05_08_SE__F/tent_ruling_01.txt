  Case Number:  22NWCV00688    Hearing Date:   May 8, 2024    Dept:  F Optima Energy, Inc. v. Choi 22NWCV00688Ex Parte ApplicationJudge:  Lee W. Tsao
 Plaintiff applies ex parte to continue trial and pretrial
deadlines which have not yet passed.  Trial is currently scheduled for
July 10, 2024.  The motion is GRANTED in part.  Trial is continued
for approximately six months pursuant to CRC Rule 3.1332(c)(6) - a party's
excused inability to obtain essential testimony, documents, or other material
evidence despite diligent efforts.  A six-month continuance depending on
the Court’s and the parties' availability is reasonable.  However,
Plaintiff has not demonstrated why it is necessary to continue only those
pretrial deadlines which have not passed.  That would exclude
the deadline to bring a motion for summary judgment, which must be noticed at
least 75 days before the hearing and heard no later than 30 days before trial.
CCP 437c(a)(2)-(3).  The Court is not inclined to prevent the parties from
bringing a motion for summary judgment based upon the discovery of evidence
made possible by this trial continuance.  Therefore, discovery and motion
cut-offs will track the new trial date. Moving party to give notice.
