And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the information presented and has reached a tentative ruling. The court does not raise subject matter jurisdiction in opposition to Bank's motion. However, the court notes that Bank does not address whether the judgment complied with due process or was "fundamentally fair" as required by California Code of Civil Procedure section 1716(c)(1)(G). The court also notes that Blyumkin acknowledged his fluency in Russian, which was necessary to understand the Russian court's decision.

The court rejects Bank's argument that the 9th Circuit's decision in Bank Melli Iran v. Pahlavi (1995) is the exclusive means by which a foreign court might offend traditional notions of due process. Instead, the court relies on the broader requirements of due process outlined in Hlilon v. Guyot (1895) and Article 35 of the Russian Civil Procedure Code.

The court also considers the California Civil Code section 2819, which provides that a surety is exonerated if the original obligation is altered without the surety's consent. The court finds that the motion does not seek an order for summary adjudication of issues and, therefore, the motion must be denied in its entirety.
