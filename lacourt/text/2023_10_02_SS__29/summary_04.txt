The Judge's tentative ruling is that the motion to consolidate the Carbajal Action and the Hibbert Action for all purposes is CONTINUED for approximately 30 days to allow the Defendants to cure a procedural defect. The motion was filed in the Carbajal Action but not in the Hibbert Action. The Court finds that consolidation is warranted because both actions arise from the same multi-vehicle accident on September 29, 2021, and involve similar theories of liability. The Court notes that both plaintiffs allege personal injuries and property damage due to Defendant Wright's conduct, and that consolidation would promote efficiency, benefit all parties, and avoid unnecessary costs and delays. The Judge is tentatively inclined to grant the motion once the procedural defect is cured.

**English Summary:**

The judge is considering a motion from the defendants (County of Los Angeles and David Morgan Wright) to consolidate two cases: one filed by Ismael Carbajal and another filed by Earl Hibbert. Both cases stem from the same traffic accident involving an emergency vehicle driven by Defendant Wright on September 29, 2021.

The judge finds that consolidating the cases is appropriate because they share numerous common factual and legal issues. Both plaintiffs allege injuries and property damage due to Wright's actions.  

The judge notes that although Carbajal's attorney had some reservations about consolidating the cases for trial, no formal opposition was filed.  The judge is tentatively inclined to grant the motion to consolidate, but is continuing the hearing to allow the defendants to correct a minor procedural error in their filing.
