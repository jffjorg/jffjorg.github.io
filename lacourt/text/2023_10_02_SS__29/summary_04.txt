And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the motion to consolidate the Carbajal Action and the Hibbert Action for all purposes is CONTINUED for approximately 30 days to allow the Defendants to cure a procedural defect. The motion was filed in the Carbajal Action but not in the Hibbert Action. The Court finds that consolidation is warranted because both actions arise from the same multi-vehicle accident on September 29, 2021, and involve similar theories of liability. The Court notes that both plaintiffs allege personal injuries and property damage due to Defendant Wright's conduct, and that consolidation would promote efficiency, benefit all parties, and avoid unnecessary costs and delays. The Judge is tentatively inclined to grant the motion once the procedural defect is cured.
