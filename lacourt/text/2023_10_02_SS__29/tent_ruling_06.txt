The Court CONTINUES
the hearing on this motion to compel further responses.  The parties have not completed an Informal
Discovery Conference. 
 
Discussion
 
The
Court’s Eighth Amended Standing Order for Procedures in the Personal Injury Hub
Court provides that “PI Hub Courts will not hear Motions to Compel Further
Discovery Responses to Discovery until the parties have engaged in an Informal
Discovery Conference (IDC).” (See Eighth Amended Standing Order for
Procedures in the Personal Injury Hub Court, ¶ E.) “PI Hub Courts may deny or
continue a Motion to Compel Further Responses to Discovery if parties fail to
schedule and complete an IDC before the scheduled hearing on a Motion to Compel
Further Reponses to Discovery.” (Id.) 
 
Here, the
parties have not engaged in an IDC. 
 
Accordingly,
the Court CONTINUES the hearing so that the parties may engage in an IDC. 
Conclusion
The Court CONTINUES
the hearing. 
 
Moving party is
ordered to give notice.
