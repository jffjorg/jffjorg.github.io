**English Summary:**

The judge has tentatively ruled to grant DoorDash Inc.'s motion to continue the trial date. The trial was originally scheduled for December 4, 2023, but will now be held in mid-October 2024. 

This decision comes because DoorDash has filed a motion for summary judgment, which is scheduled to be heard on September 5, 2024. Due to the heavy caseload of the Personal Injury Hub departments, adding another summary judgment hearing would be difficult. 

The judge acknowledges that this delay is significant, but ultimately believes it is necessary to ensure a fair hearing for both parties.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Defendant DoorDash's motion to continue the trial date. The trial was originally scheduled for December 4, 2023, but the judge has rescheduled it for mid-October 2024 due to the complexity of the court's calendar and the need to accommodate a motion for summary judgment. The judge notes that while the continuance will substantially delay the trial, it is necessary to ensure that the court has the capacity to hear the motion and other cases. The judge has also reset the final status conference and all discovery deadlines based on the new trial date.
