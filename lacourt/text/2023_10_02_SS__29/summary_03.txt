And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Defendant DoorDash's motion to continue the trial date. The motion was filed due to the impact of the court's calendar on the hearing of Defendant DoorDash's motion for summary judgment. The judge has determined that "good cause" exists to continue the trial date, considering the unavailability of the court's calendar to hear additional summary judgment motions. The trial date is continued to mid-October 2024, and the Final Status Conference and all discovery deadlines are reset based on the new trial date.
