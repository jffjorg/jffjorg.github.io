And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled to continue the hearing on the defendant's motion to compel arbitration for approximately 30 days. The defendant filed the motion on August 8, 2023, seeking to compel arbitration and stay the proceedings. The plaintiff did not file an opposition to the motion. The judge's decision is based on the fact that there is an issue with service of the motion, as the plaintiff's counsel of record changed without a substitution of attorney form or notice of change in handling attorney being filed. The judge is concerned that service may not be proper and wants the defendant to address the issue in advance of the next hearing.
