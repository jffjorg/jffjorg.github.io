**English Summary:**

The judge has granted the motion filed by Vanessa Fantasia to be relieved as counsel for Rodrigo Valle in this premises liability case. The case involves allegations that Mr. Valle was injured after colliding with an unmarked glass door. 

The judge previously denied Ms. Fantasia's motion multiple times due to her failure to properly serve the defendants and the plaintiff with notices about the motion and subsequent hearings. After Ms. Fantasia filed the required paperwork and proof of service, the judge granted her motion to withdraw as counsel. The order is effective once Ms. Fantasia files proof of service on Mr. Valle.
