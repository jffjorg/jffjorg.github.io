 Case Number:  21STCV02403    Hearing Date:   October 2, 2023    Dept:  29 TENTATIVE
The Court GRANTS Defendant’s three
motions to compel.
The Court GRANTS Defendant’s request for monetary
sanctions in part. 
 
Background 
 
This case
arises out of a motor vehicle accident that allegedly occurred on April 21,
2019, near the intersection of York Boulevard and Vista Drive in Los Angeles, California.  
 
On January
21, 2021, Plaintiff Lindsey Esquivel (“Plaintiff”) and Sally Ydelbira Tipple filed
a complaint against Defendant Jeanine Rohn (“Defendant”) and Does 1 through 100
alleging causes of action for (1) motor vehicle negligence and (2) general
negligence.  Defendant filed her answer
on September 7, 2022. 
On May 17, 2023,
Defendant filed multiple motions to compel initial responses to discovery.  Before the Court at this time are three of
those motions: (1) Defendant’s motion to compel Plaintiff to provide initial
responses to Special Interrogatories (Set One); (2) Defendant’s motion to
compel Plaintiff to provide initial responses to Form Interrogatories (Set
One); and (3) Defendant’s motion to compel Plaintiff to provide initial
responses to Requests for Production of Documents (Set One).  Defendant also seeks monetary sanctions in
each motion.
Plaintiff has not filed
any opposition.
 
The Court is aware that additional
motions to compel are scheduled to be heard in this case on October 3 and 4.
Legal Standard
 
A party must
respond to interrogatories within 30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260,
subd.(a).) If a party to whom interrogatories are directed does not provide a timely
response, the propounding party may move for an order compelling response to
the interrogatories. (Id., § 2030.290, subd. (b).) There is no time
limit for a motion to compel initial responses, and no meet and confer efforts
are required. (See id., § 2030.290; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting,
Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.)
Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who
fails to provide a timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).) 
When a party moves
to compel initial responses to interrogatories, “the court shall impose a
monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against
any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the
motion], unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2030.290, subd. (c).)
A party must
respond to requests for production of documents within 30 days after service.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260, subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests for
production of documents are directed does not provide timely responses, the
requesting party may move for an order compelling response to the demand. (Id.,
§ 2031.300, subd. (b).) There is no time limit for a motion to compel initial
responses, and no meet and confer efforts are required. (See id., §
2031.300; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at p. 411.)
Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who
fails to provide a timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a).) 
When a party moves
to compel initial responses to requests for production, “the court shall impose
a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against
any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the motion],
unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial
justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction
unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2031.300, subd. (c).)
In Chapter 7 of the Civil Discovery Act, Code of Civil
Procedure section 2023.010, subdivision (d), defines “[m]isuses of the
discovery process” to include “[f]ailing to respond to or to submit to an
authorized method of discovery.”  Where a
party or attorney has engaged in misuse of the discovery process, the court may
impose a monetary sanction in the amount of “the reasonable expenses, including
attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd.
(a).)
Discussion
On October
24, 2022, Defendant served on Plaintiff Special
Interrogatories (Set One), Form Interrogatories (Set One), and Requests for
Production of Documents (Set One).  (Bakshandeh
Decls., ¶ 2 & Exhs. A.)  Plaintiff has
not served responses. (Bakshandeh Decls., ¶ 12.) 
Defendant need show nothing more.  Her motions to compel are granted.
Defendant’s
requests for sanctions against Plaintiff are granted in part.  Given the relatively straightforward nature
of a motion to compel initial responses, and the economies of scale associated
with filing multiple parallel motions, the Court awards sanctions on each
motion in the amount of $510, calculated as 1.5 hours of attorney work on each
motion, multiplied by a reasonable rate for this work of $300 per hour, plus
the filing fee of $60 per motion.  (See Bakshandeh
Decl., ¶ 14.)
Conclusion
Accordingly, the Court GRANTS Defendant’s three motions
to compel.
Plaintiff is ORDERED to provide verified, code-compliant,
written responses, without objections, to Defendant’s Special
Interrogatories (Set One), Form Interrogatories (Set One), and Requests for
Production of Documents (Set One) within 30 days of the notice of this order.
The Court
GRANTS Defendant’s request for monetary sanctions in part. Plaintiff and
counsel fo record Yoon Kim are ORDERED, jointly and severally, to pay monetary
sanctions to Defendant in the total amount of $1,530 within 30 days of notice
of this order.
