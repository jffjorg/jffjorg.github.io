  Case Number:  20STCV47802    Hearing Date:   October 2, 2023    Dept:  29 TENTATIVE
 
The motion is GRANTED.
 
Background
 
            On
December 15, 2020, Plaintiff Rodrigo Valle filed a complaint against Defendants
Regal Cinemas, Inc., Cineworld Inc., El Paseo Center SPE LLC, and John Doe for
(1) negligence and (2) premises liability for injuries arising from a collision
with an unmarked glass door. 
 
            The
Court previously denied counsel Vanessa Fantasia’s motion to be relieved as
counsel for failure to show proof of service on Defendants and failure to
include an upcoming status conference on the proposed order and declaration.  (06/02/23 Minute Order.) The Court continued
the motion again, finding that counsel did not serve the client until 3 days
before the scheduled hearing. (08/07/23 Minute Order.) The hearing was
continued again after the Court found that Counsel failed to update the Court
about her ability or efforts to contact Plaintiff and found that counsel did
not file new proofs of service showing notice of the hearing date to client.
(09/06/23 Minute Order.) 
 
            On
September 7, 2023, counsel filed new MC-051, MC-052, and MC-053 forms with the
Court, requesting to be relieved as counsel.          
 
Legal
Standard
 
The court may order that an attorney
be changed or substituted at any time before or after judgment or final
determination upon request by either client or attorney and after notice from
one to the other. (Code of Civ. Proc., § 284(b).) An attorney is permitted
to withdraw where conflicts between the attorney and client make it
unreasonable to continue the representation. (See Cal. Rules of Prof.
Conduct 3-700(C)(1).) “The determination whether to grant or deny a motion
to withdraw as counsel lies within the sound discretion of the trial court.” (Manfredi
& Levine v. Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128,
1133.)   
 
An application to be relieved as
counsel must be made on Judicial Counsel Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and
Motion) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(a)), MC-052 (Declaration) (Cal. Rules
of Court, rule 3.136(c)), and MC-053 (Proposed Order) (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.1362(e)).   
 
Further, the requisite forms must be
served on the client and all other parties who have appeared in the
case. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(d).) The court may delay
effective date of the order relieving counsel until proof of service of a copy
of the signed order on the client has been filed with the court. (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(e).) 
 
Discussion
 
            Counsel has filed the
requisite forms pursuant to CRC Rule 3.1362. Counsel has served the forms on
Plaintiff’s last known address and has also filed proof of service showing
service of the forms on Defendants that have appeared in the case.  
 
            Counsel has shown a sufficient
basis for the relief requested and has satisfied all applicable substantive and
procedural requirements.                        
 
Conclusion
 
The motion to
be relieved as counsel is GRANTED.  
 
The order is
effective upon the filing of proof of service of the order on the client.
 
Moving
counsel to give notice.
