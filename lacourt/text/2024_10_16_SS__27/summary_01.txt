And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling regarding the petition to approve a minor's compromise. The minor, Perla Rodriguez-Contreras, had filed a petition that was found to have several deficiencies, and the court ordered a new petition to be filed. However, the court has not received a corrected petition to date. As a result, the court has set an Order to Show Cause (OSC) re Sanctions in the amount of up to $1,001, pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure section 177.5, for the petitioner's failure to comply with the court's order. The OSC has been set for October 16, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. The court will discharge the OSC if a fully corrected petition is filed at least 5 court days prior to the OSC date.
