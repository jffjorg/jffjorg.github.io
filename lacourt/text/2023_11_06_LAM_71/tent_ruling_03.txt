[1] The Court notes Cross-Defendants improperly move in
the alternative for a motion to strike the 8th cause of action.  A motion to strike and a demurrer should be
filed as separate documents.  (Rutter
Guide, Cal. Prac. Guide Civ. Pro. Before Trial Ch. 7(I)-B §162.1.)  Further, Cross-Defendants only reserved in
the Court Reservation System a hearing on a demurrer without motion to
strike.
