And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The court grants the motion for leave to file a second amended complaint. The proposed second amended complaint does not add factual allegations or causes of action, but rather adds references to paragraph numbers, fixes paragraph numbering, and adds a prayer for relief for the Ninth Cause of Action. Although the defendant opposes the motion, the court finds that the plaintiffs have satisfied the procedural requirements for filing an amended complaint. The court exercises its discretion to allow the filing of the second amended complaint.
