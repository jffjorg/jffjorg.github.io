ANALYSIS:
 
On September 3, 2019, Plaintiff
State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company (“Plaintiff”) filed the instant
action for automobile subrogation against Defendant Ashley Amanda Grossi (“Defendant”).
Defendant filed an answer on October 28, 2019. On February 19, 2021, Plaintiff
filed a Notice of Settlement and the Court subsequently set an Order to Show
Cause Re: Dismissal. The Order to Show Cause was continued multiple times until
July 24, 2023, at which time Plaintiff failed to appear. (Minute Order, 07/24/23.)
The Court dismissed the action without prejudice that day. (Ibid.)
 
Plaintiff filed the instant Motion to Vacate Dismissal on October
3, 2023. No opposition to the Motion has been filed to date.
 
Discussion
 
The motion is brought
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure, section 473, subdivision (b). Under this statute, an application for relief must be made
no more than six months after entry of the order from which relief is sought
and must be accompanied by an affidavit of fault attesting to the moving
party’s mistake, inadvertence, surprise or neglect. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473,
subd. (b); English v. IKON Business Solutions (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 130,
143.) When based on attorney fault with respect to entry of default, default
judgment, or involuntary dismissal, a timely request for relief must be
granted. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b).) When brought pursuant to the
provision for discretionary relief based on party fault, the request must have
been filed within a reasonable amount of time. 
 
The motion was timely filed within
six months of dismissal of the action and is supported by an affidavit of
attorney fault. Plaintiff’s counsel declares that they inadvertently did not
receive notice of the continued Order to Show Cause date. (Motion, Shapiro
Decl., ¶¶11-12.) Therefore, the case must be reinstated under Code of Civil
Procedure section 473, subdivision (b).
