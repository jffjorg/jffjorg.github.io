And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to vacate the default judgment, quash the service of the summons and complaint, and dismiss the case. The defendant, Dmitriy Rechevskiy, had argued that there was no jurisdiction over him because he was not served with the summons and complaint, and that the service was therefore void. However, the judge found that the defendant was served with the summons and complaint at his residence at 430 7th Avenue, San Francisco, California, as evidenced by the proof of service filed by the plaintiff. The judge also found that the defendant's contention that he was not served and only learned of the action when funds from his bank account were levied was not credible. As a result, the judge denied the defendant's motion and ruled that the default judgment and service of the summons and complaint were valid.
