ANALYSIS:
 
On August 21, 2023, Plaintiff
Seidner & Co., Inc. dba Seidner’s Collision Centers (“Plaintiff”) filed this action for breach of implied contract
and common count for money paid by mistake against Defendant Nick Nalbans (“Defendant”).
On September 19, 2023, Defendant filed the instant Demurrer to the
Complaint. Plaintiff filed an opposition on November 13, 2023. The Demurrer was
originally set for hearing on November 29, 2023 and continued with notice to
December 11, 2023. 
 
Discussion
 
The Demurrer must be accompanied
by a meet and confer declaration as required by Code of Civil Procedure section
430.41. “Before filing a demurrer pursuant to this chapter, the demurring party
shall meet and confer in person or by telephone with the party who filed the
pleading that is subject to demurrer for the purpose of determining whether an
agreement can be reached that would resolve the objections to be raised in the
demurrer.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41(a).) The parties are to meet and confer
at least five days before the date the responsive pleading is due. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 430.41(a)(2).) Thereafter, the demurring party shall file and serve a
declaration detailing their meet and confer efforts. (Code Civ. Proc., §
430.41(a)(3).) 
 
The Demurrer is not accompanied
by any declaration, let alone a declaration evidencing a meet-and-confer
effort. An effort to meet and confer being a pre-condition of filing a
demurrer, the Court will not make a ruling on the merits of the Demurrer until
the necessary declaration is filed.
