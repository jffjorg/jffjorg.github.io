ANALYSIS:
 
Plaintiff
Interinsurance Exchange of the Automobile Club (“Plaintiff”) filed the instant
action for automobile subrogation against Defendant Hugo Banuelos Sanchez
(“Defendant”) on April 14, 2022. Plaintiff filed a Stipulation and Order for Entry of Judgment on May 4, 2023. The
Court signed the order and dismissed the action with a retention of
jurisdiction under Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6 on June 8, 2023. (Stip
and Order, filed 05/04/23; Order, 06/08/23.) Plaintiff filed the instant
motion to enforce settlement and enter
judgment on September 26, 2023. No opposition has been filed to date.
 
Discussion
 
The instant motion is brought under Code of Civil Procedure, section
664.6, which states in relevant part:
 
If parties to pending litigation
stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties outside the presence of the court
or orally before the court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the
court, upon motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement.
If requested by the parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties
to enforce the settlement until performance in full of the terms of the
settlement.
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6, subd.
(a).) Prior to January 1, 2021, “parties” under section 664.6 meant the
litigants themselves, not their attorneys. 
(Levy v. Superior Court (1995) 10 Cal.4th 578, 586.) The current
statute provides that “parties” includes “an attorney who represents the party”
and an insurer’s agent. (Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6, subd. (b).) The settlement
must include the signatures of the parties seeking to enforce the agreement,
and against whom enforcement is sought. (J.B.B. Investment Partners, Ltd. v.
Fair (2014) 232 Cal.App.4th 974, 985.) The settlement agreement here complies with the statutory
requirements set forth above because it was signed by the parties and
Plaintiff’s counsel. (Motion, Tapper Decl., Exh. A, p. 5.) Therefore, the Court
finds that the parties’ settlement agreement is enforceable under Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6.
 
The settlement agreement provides
that Defendant would pay Plaintiff $11,377.73 plus ten percent interest from
February 26, 2021, and court costs by making monthly payments starting on
August 28, 2022. (Id. at Exh. A, ¶¶1-3.) The settlement agreement also
provides that if Defendant defaults, judgment in the settlement amount, less
monies paid, may be entered in Plaintiff’s favor. (Id. at Exh. A, ¶5.)
Defendant only made payments in the amount of $1,000.00 and, thereafter
defaulted. (Id. at ¶4.) Plaintiff seeks an order entering judgment
against Defendant based on the settlement amount of $10,377.73 principal
($11,377.73 - $1,000.00), $2,678.31 interest at ten percent per annum from
February 26, 2021, and $225.00 costs. (Id. at ¶5.) 
 
Conclusion
 
Therefore, Plaintiff
Interinsurance Exchange of the Automobile Club’s Motion to Enforce Settlement
Agreement and Enter Judgment is GRANTED IN THE AMOUNT OF $10,377.73 PRINCIPAL,
$2,678.31 INTEREST, AND $225.00 COSTS.
