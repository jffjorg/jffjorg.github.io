And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The plaintiff, State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company, has filed a motion to vacate the dismissal of its action against the defendant, Ashley Amanda Grossi. The motion was granted, and the dismissal entered on July 24, 2023, is hereby vacated. An order to show cause re: dismissal is set for January 22, 2024, at 9:30 am in Department 26 of the Spring Street Courthouse. The plaintiff's counsel declared that they inadvertently did not receive notice of the continued Order to Show Cause date, which led to the failure to appear on July 24, 2023, resulting in the dismissal. Under Code of Civil Procedure, section 473, subdivision (b), the motion was timely filed and supported by an affidavit of attorney fault, and therefore, the case must be reinstated.
