Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the motions of the Wilshire Law Firm to be relieved as counsel for the Plaintiffs, Ivan Hernandez-Chavelas and Rafael Hernandez. The firm's attorney, Ariella E. Perry, states that there has been a breakdown in communication with the Clients, such that counsel can no longer effectively represent them. The court finds that the requirements of California Rule of Court Rule 3.1362 have been met, including the service of notice of motion and motion, declaration, and proposed order on the Clients and other parties. The motions are granted, effective upon the filing of proof of service showing service of the signed orders upon the Clients at their last known address, return receipt requested.
