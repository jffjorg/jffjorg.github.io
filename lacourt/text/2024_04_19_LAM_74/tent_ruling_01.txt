  Case Number:  22STCV41032    Hearing Date:   April 19, 2024    Dept:  74 Richard
Gonzalez v. 2013 Madrid Family Irrevocable Trust Dated May 31, 203, et al.
Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel
Defendant’s Responses to Special Interrogatories (Set One) and Request for Sanctions.
 
BACKGROUND 
            This
action arises from a landlord-tenant dispute.
            On
December 30, 2022, Plaintiff Richard Gonzalez (Plaintiff) filed a complaint
against Defendant 2013 Madrid Family Irrevocable Trust Dated May 31, 2013
(Defendant) and Alfredo Madrid Jr. 
            In
the complaint, Plaintiff alleges the following causes of action: (1) breach of
contract, (2) tortious breach of the implied warranty of habitability, (3)
violation of Civil Code section 1942.4, (4) unlawful and unfair business
practices, (5) violation of Civil Code section 1942.5, (6) intentional
infliction of emotional distress, and (7) violation of Civil Code section 51.
            On
July 6, 2023, Plaintiff served Defendant with special interrogatories (set
one). 
            However,
Defendant never provided responses.
            On
October 30, 2023, Plaintiff filed this motion to compel Defendant’s responses
to the special interrogatories and request for sanctions.
LEGAL STANDARD
¿¿            If
a party to whom interrogatories or an inspection demand were directed fails to serve
a timely response, the propounding party may move for an order compelling
responses without objections. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (b),
2031.300, subd. (b).) Moreover, failure to timely serve responses waives
objections to the requests. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (a), 2031.300,
subd. (a).) Failure to verify a response is equivalent to no response at all. (Appleton
v. Superior Court (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 632, 636.)  
DISCUSSION  
            The
court grants this motion because Defendant has failed to provide timely
responses to the special interrogatories. Moreover, sanctions are warranted
because Defendant has not demonstrated that it acted with substantial
justification. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (c).) Plaintiff’s counsel
proposed hourly rate is reasonable and he has provided a breakdown of work
performed. (Alatorre Decl., ¶ 8.) Accordingly, the court grants Plaintiff’s
counsel’s request for sanctions in the amount of $800.
CONCLUSION 
The
court grants Plaintiff’s motion to compel Defendant’s responses to special
interrogatories (set one). Defendant shall provide verified, Code-compliant
responses, without objections, within 30 days of this order. The court grants
Plaintiff’s counsel request for sanctions. Defendant shall pay Plaintiff’s
counsel $800 within 30 days of this order.
Plaintiff
shall give notice.//////////////Richard
