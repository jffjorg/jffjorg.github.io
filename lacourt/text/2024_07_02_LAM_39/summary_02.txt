And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to quash the service of summons and complaint filed by Wilson Sporting Goods Co. (Defendant). The Defendant argues that it lacks sufficient minimum contacts with California to justify the exercise of personal jurisdiction over it. However, the Plaintiff, Marielita Palacios, argues that the Defendant's website, which includes a privacy policy and information on complying with California law, as well as its retail stores in California, constitutes sufficient minimum contacts.

The Judge has analyzed the case law and found that while the Defendant is a nonresident corporation, its activities in California, including its website and retail stores, demonstrate sufficient minimum contacts to justify the exercise of personal jurisdiction. The Judge has also noted that the Defendant's failure to provide information on its operations in California and its lack of physical presence in California does not prevent the exercise of general jurisdiction over it.

The Judge has denied the Defendant's motion to quash and ordered the Plaintiff to provide notice of the order and to file proof of service of same.
