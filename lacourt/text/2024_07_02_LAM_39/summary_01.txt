The Judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding a motion to compel the plaintiff, Estibi Fuentes Tamayo, to appear for deposition. The defendants, Virginia Toledo, Ronnie Toledo, Edward Toledo, and Guadalupe Toledo, sought to compel the plaintiff to appear for deposition after the plaintiff failed to do so despite being served with a notice of deposition. The Judge found that the plaintiff's failure to appear was an abuse of the discovery process and granted the motion. The Judge also ordered the plaintiff to pay sanctions in the amount of $800 to the defendants. The deposition is to be conducted within 30 days, and the plaintiff and their counsel are jointly and severally responsible for paying the sanctions.
