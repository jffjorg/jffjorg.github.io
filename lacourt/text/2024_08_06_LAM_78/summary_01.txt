And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling grants the defendant's motion to compel responses to form interrogatories served on the plaintiff, Vitu Chea. The defendant, Kennedy Wilson Westmoreland TIC, LLC (KW), served the interrogatories on November 1, 2023, and responses were due on March 15, 2024. However, the responses that were served referred to Mohammad Fahad instead of Chea, despite Chea's counsel signing the verification. The court finds that the responses were not served in a timely manner and that the verification is questionable. As a result, the court grants the motion to compel and orders Chea to serve verified responses to the interrogatories within 10 days. The court also awards sanctions to the defendant in the amount of $800 for attorney's fees and orders Chea to pay sanctions to the defendant.
