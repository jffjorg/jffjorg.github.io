And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the plaintiff's motion to compel defendants to submit to arbitration and to pay for the cost of said arbitration. The plaintiff, Donald L. Crawford Sr., had filed a complaint against defendants Verizon Communications, Inc., Walmart, Inc., and Samsung Electronics of America, Inc. for breach of contract, products liability, and intentional tort. The court had previously granted the defendants' motion to compel arbitration and stayed the case. The plaintiff is seeking to compel the defendants to submit to arbitration as ordered by the court and to pay for the cost of the arbitration, citing his indigence and requesting a waiver of fees and costs. The defendants argue that the motion fails because the plaintiff improperly noticed a different hearing date and that the case is stayed, and that the plaintiff is responsible for initiating the arbitration. The judge has denied the motion, citing the defendants' obligation to pay for the arbitration fees and costs under California Code of Civil Procedure ยง1284.3.
