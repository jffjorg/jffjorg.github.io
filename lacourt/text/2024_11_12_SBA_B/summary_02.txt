Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion to compel arbitration and stayed the case. The plaintiff, Coleman Jennings, filed a complaint against Tesla Motors, Inc. (defendant) for violations under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act. The defendant requests that the Court compel arbitration and stay the case.

The judge finds that an arbitration agreement exists between the plaintiff and the defendant, and that the plaintiff did not opt out of the arbitration provision. The scope of the arbitration provision covers the plaintiff's claims against the defendant, which relate to the relationship between the plaintiff as a purchaser and the defendant as the manufacturer and seller of the vehicle.

The judge also finds that the arbitration provision is enforceable, despite the fact that it may be an adhesion contract. The judge notes that the plaintiff had the ability to opt out of the arbitration provision, and that there is no indication of oppression or substantive unconscionability.

The motion is granted, and the action is stayed. The defendant is ordered to give notice of the ruling.
