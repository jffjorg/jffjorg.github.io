And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by the City of Gardena, a defendant in a lawsuit brought by Laureano Azurdia Camey. The lawsuit alleges that the City of Gardena, along with other defendants, failed to properly maintain a tree that fell on Camey's vehicle, causing injuries. The City of Gardena argues that the allegations are insufficient to show that it owned, maintained, or operated the property where the accident occurred. The judge has ruled in favor of the City of Gardena, sustaining the demurrer without leave to amend. The judge's decision is based on maps and other evidence submitted by the City of Gardena, which show that the accident occurred in the City of Los Angeles, not the City of Gardena. The judge has determined that the allegations in the complaint are insufficient to state a cause of action and has denied the plaintiff's opportunity to amend the complaint.
