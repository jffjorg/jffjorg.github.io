And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to disqualify the plaintiff's counsel, Logan Hensley, and his law firm, The Lemon Daddy aka Drake Law. The defendant argued that Hensley had a prior relationship with FCA US LLC, having worked for RoseWaldorf LLP and defended FCA US on numerous claims, and that this relationship created a conflict of interest. The plaintiff, on the other hand, argued that Hensley did not receive confidential information while working for RoseWaldorf, and that his work for FCA US was not substantially related to the present case.

The judge found that the defendant had not shown that Hensley received confidential information while working for RoseWaldorf, and that the work Hensley did for FCA US was not substantially related to the present case. The judge also noted that Hensley has been properly screened from all matters against FCA US and that the issue is now moot.

The judge's decision is based on the court's discretion to control the conduct of its ministerial officers and to maintain the integrity of the judicial process. The judge cited various legal authorities, including California Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) ยง128 and California Rules of Professional Conduct (CRPC) 1.9 and 1.10, to support its decision.
