[Tentative]
  Order RE:
 
defendant’s motion to compel compliance with
  deposition subpoena
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                 Defendant Wells Fargo Bank,
N.A.   
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Unopposed
Motion to Compel Compliance with Deposition Subpoena 
The court
considered the moving papers filed in connection with this motion.  No opposition papers were filed. 
DISCUSSION
Defendant Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (“Defendant”) moves the court for an
order (1) compelling nonparty Cervenka & Lukes Mortgage Brokers (“CLMB”) to
comply with Defendant’s Deposition Subpoena for Business Records, served on
CLMB on August 22, 2022, and (2) awarding sanctions in favor of Defendant and
against CLMB in the amount of $4,539.
The court finds that Defendant has not shown that CLMB has been served
with notice of the new hearing date on this motion.
            Defendant filed the pending motion
on December 23, 2022, with an original hearing date of August 24, 2023.  The hearing date changed several times
thereafter.  Most recently, pursuant to
the stipulation of the parties to this action and the court’s November 8, 2023
order, the hearing on Defendant’s motion was advanced from July 9, 2024 to
January 29, 2024.  However, Defendant did
not file a proof of service of the court’s order advancing the hearing on the
motion on CLMB.  Although Defendant filed
a “Notice of Ruling re Continuance of Trial and All Related Dates” on November
8, 2023, the proof of service attached thereto does not state it was served on
nonparty CLMB.  (Nov. 8, 2023, Notice of
Ruling, pp. 11-12 [notice of ruling was served on attorneys for plaintiff John
Christian Lukes and attorney for defendant Timothy J. Sloan].)  The court also notes that neither CLMB nor
any of its authorized representatives signed the parties’ stipulation.  (Nov. 8, 2023, Stipulation to Continue Trial
and all Related Dates, p. 4 [signed by “Attorneys for Plaintiff [¶] John
Christian Lukes[,]” “Attorneys for Defendant [¶] Timothy J. Sloan[,]” and
“Attorneys for Defendants [¶] Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., [¶] Wells Fargo &
Company, [¶] and Stephen R. Silk”].)  
            Thus, it appears that CLMB has not received
notice of the January 29, 2024 hearing date on Defendant’s motion.  The court therefore exercises its discretion
to continue the hearing on Defendant’s motion to ensure that CLMB receives
notice of the hearing date.  
ORDER
            The court continues the hearing on
defendant Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.’s motion to compel compliance with deposition
subpoena for business records to March 12, 2024, at 10:00 a.m., in Department
53. 
            The court orders defendant Wells
Fargo Bank, N.A. (1) to serve on nonparty Cervenka & Lukes Mortgage Brokers
a notice of this ruling and notice of the new hearing date on its motion in the
manner required by California Rules of Court, rule 3.1346, and (2) to serve a
notice of this ruling on all other parties that have appeared in this action. 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
DATED:  January 29, 2024
