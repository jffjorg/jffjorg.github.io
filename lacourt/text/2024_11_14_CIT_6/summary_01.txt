```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's request for entry of default judgment against the defendant. The court has vacated the default judgment that was entered on September 12, 2024. The court notes that the plaintiff's default judgment package has several problems, including excess damages, missing prejudgment interest calculation, and improperly included collection fees. The court also notes that the default should not have been entered as the defendant had more time to respond to the complaint. Finally, the court suggests that the case may have been improperly filed in an unlimited jurisdiction court and may need to be reclassified and transferred to a limited civil court. The court will hear from counsel for the plaintiff at the hearing on this motion to discuss these issues.
