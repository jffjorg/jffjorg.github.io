And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling grants the ex parte application to continue the trial date in the case of Sean Suh v. Royce Clayton, et al. The parties have agreed to continue the trial date, and the defendants do not oppose the continuance. Due to the Court's lack of availability, the trial date is set for August 6, 2024. The discovery and motions deadlines will be based on the former trial date of October 24, 2023, except for the depositions of defendants Sean Suh and Royce Clayton. Plaintiff's counsel is required to provide notice and file proof of the depositions with the Court. A Final Status Conference is scheduled for July 26, 2024, at 9:00 a.m.
