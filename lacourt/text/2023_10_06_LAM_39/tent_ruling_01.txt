Plaintiff’s

trial on its first available date:

Trial:

The
discovery and motions deadlines shall be based on the former trial date
(October 24, 2023) except with respect to the depositions of Defendants Sean
Suh and Royce Clayton.
 
Plaintiff’s
counsel shall provide notice and file proof of such with the Court.
