And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling denied the motion for reconsideration of the court's May 8, 2024, ruling denying the motion to quash service of summons. The defendants failed to file an answer or other responsive pleading, which led to the entry of default on June 10, 2024. The court found that the entry of default was proper and that there was no proof of service attached to the document. The defendants' additional evidentiary details presented were not new or different, and the motion was denied on its merits. The court relied on California Code of Civil Procedure sections 1008 and 585(b), as well as several court cases, including Le Francoise v. Goel, Powell v. County of Orange, Marriage of Oliverez, Davcon, Inc. v. Roberts & Morgan, Gilberd v. AC Transit, Mink v. Superior Court, and Wilcox v. Ford. The court emphasized that a party seeking reconsideration must show that new or different facts exist and provide a satisfactory explanation for failing to produce such evidence earlier.
