And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is issuing a tentative ruling on Public Storage's motion to compel arbitration of Victoria Castro's action against it. Public Storage filed a motion to compel arbitration, providing evidence that Victoria Castro signed an agreement to rent a storage unit from Public Storage in June 2022, which includes an arbitration provision. The judge finds that Public Storage has met its burden to show an agreement to arbitrate, and Victoria Castro has failed to meet her burden to deny the motion. The judge grants Public Storage's motion and orders Victoria Castro to arbitrate her claims against Public Storage, staying the entire action pending resolution of the arbitration proceeding.
