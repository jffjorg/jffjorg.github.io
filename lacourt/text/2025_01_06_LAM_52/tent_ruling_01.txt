  Case Number:  22STCV13106    Hearing Date:   January 6, 2025    Dept:  52 Defendant Farmers Group, Inc.’s Motion  to Compel Further Responses to Requests for Production, Set Four             Defendant Farmers  Group, Inc. (FGI) moves to compel plaintiff Maureen Martinez to provide further  responses to requests for production Nos. 31-34.  A requesting party may move to compel further  responses to requests for production if “[a] statement of compliance with the  demand is incomplete,” “[a] representation of inability to comply is  inadequate, incomplete, or evasive,” or “[a]n objection in the response is  without merit or too general.”  (Code  Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (a).) Further Responses    After FGI filed this motion,  plaintiff agreed to serve a supplemental response to No. 31.  The court finds the motion is moot as to  request No. 31. In Nos. 32 to 34, FGI requested “The  Profit and Loss Statement for Maureen Martinez Insurance Agency, Inc.,  including, but not limited to, I.R.S. Form 1040 (Schedule C), for the year [32:  2017 / 33: 2019 / 34: 2020].”  Plaintiff  responded with many objections and did not agree to produce any documents.  In her opposition, she argued only in support  of her objection based on the tax return privilege.   Plaintiff justifies her objection  under the tax return privilege.  There is “a  statutory privilege against disclosing tax returns.”  (Weingarten v. Superior Court (2002)  102 Cal.App.4th 268, 274.)  But “[t]he  privilege will not be upheld when (1) the circumstances indicate an intentional  waiver of the privilege; (2) the gravamen of the lawsuit is inconsistent with  the privilege; or (3) a public policy greater than that of the confidentiality  of tax returns is involved.   [Citation.]  This latter exception  is narrow and applies only ‘when warranted by a legislatively declared public  policy.’ ”  (Ibid.)   The privilege applies though  the requests seek “Profit and Loss Statements” and not necessarily tax returns  themselves.  Parties may not “avoid the application  of the privilege by indirect means” of discovery, such as asking for  “information concerning specific entries in” a tax return.  (Sav-On Drugs, Inc. v. Superior Court  (1975) 15 Cal.3d 1, 7.)  IRS Form 1040, Schedule C is titled, “Profit  or Loss From Business.”  (Palmer Reply  Decl., ¶ 2, Ex. E.)  FGI’s requests for  “Profit and Loss Statements” from Maureen Martinez Insurance Agency, Inc. seek the  same information that would appear on the tax return forms.  FGI argues “IRS Form 1040  Schedule C is an underlying document not privileged under Revenue Code section  19282, even if used for the preparation of the tax return.”  (Reply, p. 4.)  But Schedule C expressly instructs, “Attach  to Form 1040.”  (Palmer Reply Decl., Ex.  E.)  Form 1040 is the “U.S. Individual  Income Tax Return.”  Even if Schedule C  were an underlying document rather than part of the return, the privilege  applies to other documents that “constitute an integral part of the return.”  (Brown v. Superior Court (1977) 71  Cal.App.3d 141, 143 [privilege applies to W-2 forms].)   FGI does not show an  intentional waiver, that the gravamen of the lawsuit is inconsistent with the  tax return privilege, or that a greater public policy warrants disclosing the  tax returns.  FGI contends any privacy  interest is minimal because the profit and loss statements are for Maureen  Martinez Insurance Agency, Inc., not plaintiff as an individual.  Assuming that is correct, it is not “ ‘a  legislatively declared public policy’ ” (Weingarten v. Superior Court,  supra, 102 Cal.App.4th at p. 274) that outweighs the interest in  confidentiality of tax returns.  Plaintiff’s objections to  requests for production Nos. 32-34 based on the tax return privilege are sustained.            Sanctions             FGI moves  for monetary sanctions against plaintiff and her counsel.  Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.310,  subdivision (h) provides, “[T]he court shall impose a monetary sanction …  against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes” a  motion to compel further responses to requests for production “unless it finds  that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or  that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  Plaintiff’s opposition conceded she should  provide a further response to request No. 31 and was wholly successful as to  Nos. 32-34.  The court finds plaintiff acted  with substantial justification. Disposition Defendant Farmers Group, Inc.’s  motion to compel further responses to requests for production, set four is denied.  Defendants’
Motion to Continue Trial             On November 25, 2024, defendants
moved to continue the trial of this action from February 26, 2025, to June 25,
2025.  On December 11, 2024, the court
continued the trial to March 24, 2025.  The
court finds defendants do not show good cause for a longer continuance.              Defendants’ motion to continue trial
is denied.
