 Case Number:  24STCV02192    Hearing Date:   January 6, 2025    Dept:  52 Non-Appearance Case Review Re:
Default Judgment
Plaintiff JDBR Investments, LLC requests court judgment by default
against defendants Andre Wegner and Drinkwater Investment Group, LLC
(Drinkwater).  Plaintiff’s application
for default judgment has two defects.
I. Punitive Damages
A. Entitlement to Punitive Damages
            Plaintiff
does not allege a cause of action for which it can recover punitive damages.  “The relief allowable by default is limited
not only by the prayer but by the substantive allegations of the
complaint.  Under the ‘well pleaded’
complaint rule, it is error to enter a default judgment on a complaint that
fails to state a cause of action against the defaulting defendant.”  (Ferraro v. Camarlinghi (2008) 161
Cal.App.4th 509, 539.)  Punitive damages
may only be awarded “[i]n an action for the breach of an obligation not arising
from contract.”  (Civ. Code, § 3294,
subd. (a).)
Substantively,
the complaint alleges, “On 4/10/22, Plaintiff loaned WEGNER, through his real
estate development entity, DRINKWATER, the sum of $200,000 plus interest at 10%
per year from 4/11/22 pursuant to the written Promissory Note Agreement.  Defendant agreed to repay the $200,000 loan
plus interest by 8/11/22.”  (Comp., ¶
12.)  “On 4/13/22, Plaintiff wired the
$200,000 loan funds to Defendant.”  (¶
13.)  Plaintiff further alleges, “At the
time of the agreement, Defendant also agreed to use Plaintiff’s loan for the
renovation project and that Defendant would record a Deed of Trust as a secured
lien against the property.  However,
Defendant failed to use the loan for the renovation project, failed to record
the Deed of Trust, and failed to repay the loan by the 8/11/22 due date.”  (¶ 14.) 
The gravamen of the case is thus that defendants failed to repay a loan.
            Plaintiff’s
complaint alleges three causes of action: (1) breach of contract, (2) common
counts, and (3) fraud.  Only the third
cause of action is a breach of an obligation not arising from contract.  Plaintiff does not allege sufficient facts to
constitute a cause of action for fraud.  “The elements of promissory fraud (i.e., of
fraud or deceit based on a promise made without any intention of performing it)
are: (1) a promise made regarding a material fact without any intention of
performing it; (2) the existence of the intent not to perform at the time the
promise was made; (3) intent to deceive or induce the promisee to enter into a
transaction; (4) reasonable reliance by the promisee; (5) nonperformance by the
party making the promise; and (6) resulting damage to the promisee.”  (Behnke v. State Farm General Ins. Co.
(2011) 196 Cal.App.4th 1443, 1453 (Behnke).)
In its
fraud cause of action, plaintiff alleges, “Defendant represented, in writing at
the time of the promissory note, and orally multiple times thereafter, that he
would pay Plaintiff back the principal loan balance of $200,000 plus interest.  However, Defendant never repaid any of the
loan.  Defendants also represented, in
writing at the time of the promissory note, that he would use said loan for a
real estate construction renovation project, and that Defendant would record a
Deed of Trust as a secured lien against said real estate.  However, Defendant did not provide any
accounting to prove that the loan funds were actually used for the construction
renovation project (which was abandoned), and never recorded the Deed of Trust
against the property as a secured lien, as promised.”  (Comp., ¶¶ 26-29.)  Plaintiff further alleges, “Defendant[s]
induced Plaintiff to act in reliance on their representations in order to
wrongfully obtain Plaintiff’s money without paying it back.  As a direct and proximate result of
Defendant’s fraud described herein, Plaintiff has been harmed in the amount of
$200,000 for the principal loan balance, interest on the unpaid principal, …
and contractual attorney fees plus court costs.”  (¶¶ 34-35.) 

Plaintiff
does not allege facts showing “reasonable reliance by the promisee.”  (Behnke,
supra, 196 Cal.App.4th at p. 1453.)  Whether
a plaintiff’s “ ‘reliance was justified’ ” is evaluated “ ‘in the light of his
own knowledge and experience.’ ”  (Alliance
Mortgage Co. v. Rothwell (1995) 10 Cal.4th 1226, 1247.)  Plaintiff does not show it reasonably relied on defendants’
promise to repay the loan and later record a deed of trust.  Plaintiff is not merely an unsophisticated
individual.  It is an LLC whose name
includes “Investments.”  Acquiring a
security interest in the real property simultaneously with the promissory note
is not only standard procedure by lenders, but also is contemplated by the
promissory note itself.  The promissory
note provides, “This Note shall be secured by a Deed of Trust to real property
commonly known as 312 E 44th Street, Long Beach, California 90807, executed on
April 11, 2022.”  (Comp., Ex. 1, §
II.)  The parties executed the promissory
note on April 11, 2022.  (Id., p.
5.)  Nevertheless, plaintiff transferred
the $200,000 to Drinkwater on April 13 (Comp., Ex. 2, p. 2) before acquiring
the deed of trust that should have been executed two days earlier.  
The
point of acquiring a deed of trust is to avoid depending on a mere promise of
repayment.  “A deed of trust to real
property act[s] as security for a loan.” 
(Yvanova v. New Century Mortgage Corp. (2016) 62 Cal.4th 919, 926.)  Acquiring a deed of trust gives the lender
greater remedies, such as “nonjudicial foreclosure,” which “is designed to
provide the lender-beneficiary with an inexpensive and efficient remedy against
a defaulting borrower.”  (Ibid.)  That plaintiff JDBR Investments, LLC funded
defendants’ loan before acquiring the promised deed of trust was manifestly
unreasonable.  
Plaintiff
also alleges it relied on misrepresentations defendants made after plaintiff
funded the loan.  (Comp., ¶¶ 29-33.)  These allegations cannot support a cause of
action for fraud because plaintiff does not allege it suffered any damages due
to those misrepresentations.  “The fraud plaintiff must … allege his
damages were caused by the actions he took in reliance on the defendant’s
misrepresentations.”  (Beckwith v.
Dahl (2012) 205 Cal.App.4th 1039, 1064.)  “If the defrauded plaintiff would have
suffered the alleged damage even in the absence of the fraudulent inducement,
causation cannot be alleged and a fraud cause of action cannot
be sustained.”  (Ibid.)  A plaintiff is “incapable of alleging
damages” when “even in the absence of the defendant’s fraud, the plaintiff
would have suffered the same injury.”  (Id.
at pp. 1064-1065.)  Plaintiff already
paid defendants the $200,000.  Plaintiff
does not allege facts showing it did anything in reliance on subsequent
misrepresentations or that any such actions caused damages to plaintiff.
B. Amount of Punitive Damages
Assuming
plaintiff could recover punitive damages, it does not justify the amount it
requests: $200,000.  “[A]n award of
punitive damages hinges on three factors: the reprehensibility of the defendant’s
conduct; the reasonableness of the relationship between the award and the
plaintiff’s harm; and, in view of the defendant’s financial condition, the
amount necessary to punish him or her and discourage future wrongful conduct.”  (Kelly v. Haag (2006) 145 Cal.App.4th
910, 914 (Kelly).
On the
first and second factors, the conduct giving rise to defendants’ liability for
punitive damages is promissory fraud in inducing plaintiff to lend them
$200,000.  (Comp., ¶¶ 26-35.)  The harm to plaintiff was simply that
defendants did not repay the $200,000 loan. 
Defendants’ conduct was minimally reprehensible.  It caused no damages beyond those for breach
of contract, which would not permit recovering punitive damages.  As discussed above, plaintiff’s conduct in
funding defendants’ loan before acquiring the promised deed of trust was its
own blunder more than reprehensible conduct by defendants.  
Awarding
plaintiff an extra $200,000 in punitive damages simply because it funded the
loan before getting the deed of trust first and because it alleged defendants
committed promissory fraud in addition to breach of contract would be an
unjustified windfall.  Such punitive damages
would arise from plaintiff’s artful pleading instead of defendants’ reprehensible
conduct worthy of punishment.
Finally,
plaintiff does not present sufficient evidence for the third factor.  The
plaintiff must show “ ‘evidence of the defendant’s ability to pay the damage
award.’ ”  (Green v. Laibco, LLC
(2011) 192 Cal.App.4th 441, 453.)  “[E]vidence
of the defendant’s financial condition is a prerequisite to a punitive damages
award.”  (Adams v. Murakami (1991)
54 Cal.3d 105, 119.)  The plaintiff bears
the burden of introducing such evidence. 
(Ibid.)  Punitive damages generally
should not be so great as to risk “ ‘crippling or destroying the defendant.’
”  (Kelly, supra, 145 Cal.App.4th at
p. 915.)  
Plaintiff presents evidence that in April 2022, Drinkwater
acquired real property at 312 East 44th Street in Long Beach, California.  (Rocco Decl., ¶ 27, Ex. 6.)  The record includes evidence the property is
worth $950,000 and is encumbered by a mortgage of $250,000.  (Id., ¶¶ 7-8.)  But plaintiff does not present adequate
evidence showing Drinkwater currently owns the property as required.  (See Kelly, supra,
145 Cal.App.4th at p. 917.)  Plaintiff
asserts Drinkwater Investment Group, LLC is “an inactive and dissolved Wyoming
limited liability company.”  (Rocco
Decl., ¶ 3.)  Plaintiff thus presents
evidence undermining any finding that Drinkwater is able to pay $200,000 in
punitive damages.  
Plaintiff also presents evidence Wegner owns real
property in San Juan Capistrano (id., Ex. 8), which Zillow estimates is
worth about $250,000 (id., Ex. 7). 
Plaintiff does not, however, present evidence showing that property has
no encumbrances.   
Overall, the record does not adequately show
defendants’ ability to pay $200,000 in punitive damages—particularly when added
to the other components of the proposed judgment, which total over $250,000.  Even assuming defendants have net assets of
$950,000, adding $200,000 in punitive damages to the award of $250,000 presents
a substantial risk of financially destroying defendants.
II. Attorney Fees
Plaintiff
also seeks excessive attorney fees of $17,500. 
Attorney fees for a default judgment are generally limited to a
specified schedule based on the amount of damages.  (Local Rule 3.207(a), 3.214(a).)  Plaintiffs may recover “a fee greater than listed in the [default]
schedule because of extraordinary services.” 
(3.214(d).)  Plaintiff fails to
show extraordinary services justifying a fee greater than permitted under the
schedule.  Plaintiff relies primarily on
work done attempting to locate and serve defendant Wegner.  That does not constitute extraordinary legal
services.    
Disposition
Plaintiff JDBR Investments, LLC’s request
for default judgment is denied without prejudice.
