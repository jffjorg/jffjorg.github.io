 Case Number:  24STCV26398    Hearing Date:   January 6, 2025    Dept:  52 Defendant
Public Storage’s Motion to Compel Arbitration 
Defendant
Public Storage moves to compel arbitration of plaintiff Victoria Castro’s
action against it.  
Both the California Arbitration Act and Federal
Arbitration Act permit a party to move to enforce an agreement to arbitrate
disputes.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1281.2; 9.
U.S.C. § 2.)  A motion to compel
arbitration is “a summary proceeding.”  (Espejo v. Southern California Permanente
Medical Group (2016) 246 Cal.App.4th 1047, 1057.)  The moving party can meet the “initial burden
to show an agreement to arbitrate by attaching a copy of the arbitration
agreement purportedly bearing the opposing party’s signature.”  (Id. at p. 1060.)  
Defendant
meets its burden.  It presents evidence
showing plaintiff signed an agreement to rent a storage unit from defendant in
June 2022.  (Rodriguez Decl., ¶ 4, Ex.
A.)  The agreement provides, “Both you
and Public Storage agree to arbitrate any and all disputes or claims arising
out of, in connection with, or in any way relating to the relationship between you
and us… .”  (Id., ¶ 6.2.)  Plaintiff’s complaint alleges damages arising
from the loss of property taken or stolen from her storage units.  (Comp., ¶¶ BC-2, BC-4.)  The arbitration provision applies to her
claims.
Plaintiff gives
no basis for the court to deny this motion. 
The law favors enforcement of valid arbitration
agreements.  (Armendariz
v. Foundation Health Psychcare Services, Inc. (2000) 24 Cal.4th 83,
97.)  “ ‘ “[A] party opposing the petition bears the
burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence any fact necessary to
its defense.” ’ ”  (Kader v. Southern
California Medical Center, Inc. (2024) 99 Cal.App.5th 214, 221.)  Plaintiff does not meet her burden.
Disposition
            Defendant Public Storage’s motion to
compel arbitration is granted.  The
court hereby orders plaintiff Victoria Castro to arbitrate her causes of
action against defendant pursuant to the parties’ rental agreement.  The court hereby stays the entire
action pending resolution of the arbitration proceeding.
