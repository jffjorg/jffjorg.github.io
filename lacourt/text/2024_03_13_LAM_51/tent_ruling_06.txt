   [1] The court is not bound by the captions or labels of a  cause of action in a pleading and the nature and character of a pleading is to  be determined from the facts alleged, not the name given by the pleader to the  cause of action.  Thus, regardless of whether the complaint gives the  causes of action a label imbued with personal property law meaning, it is the  facts behind the label which govern the nature and character of the primary  right sued upon.  (Ananda Church of  Self-Realization v. Massachusetts Bay Insurance (2002) 95 Cal. App. 4th  1273, 1281.)   [2]  Should the court interpret the factual allegations as a Breach of the Implied  Warranty of Habitability, that claim would also fail. In particular, Plaintiffs  include as exhibits to their SACs correspondence from Plaintiffs indicating  they blocked Defendant LANDLORD’s ability to remediate the conditions of which  Plaintiffs complain.     [3]  Interestingly enough, Plaintiffs label this claim as breach of the implied  covenant of quiet enjoyment.   [4]Plaintiffs, otherwise, plead all of the elements for a  breach of contract. First, they alleged a month-to-month lease with Defendant LANDLORD. Second, they  alleged breach by Defendants for the same slew of behaviors identified in the  first cause of action. Third, Plaintiffs allege damages.      [5]  Indeed, upon reviewing the exhibits Plaintiffs included with the various SACs,  Plaintiffs incessantly sent emails to Defendant LANDLORD.   [6]  Even if Plaintiffs did, this cause of action would only apply to Defendant  Mallot.     [7]  As with the first cause of action, this claim would only apply to Defendant  Mallot.   [8]  The court cannot provide legal advice to Plaintiffs as requested in the SAC.  (SAC pg. 10:7-8.)
