And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in this case. The court is not bound by the labels or captions used in a pleading, but rather must determine the nature and character of the pleading based on the facts alleged. The Judge finds that the Plaintiffs' claims of breach of implied warranty of habitability and breach of implied covenant of quiet enjoyment fail because they have blocked the Defendant's ability to remedy the conditions they complain about. The Judge also finds that the Plaintiffs have pled all the elements of a breach of contract, including a month-to-month lease, breach by the Defendant, and damages. The Judge notes that the Plaintiffs have sent numerous emails to the Defendant, but this does not affect the court's analysis. The Judge declines to provide legal advice to the Plaintiffs as requested.
