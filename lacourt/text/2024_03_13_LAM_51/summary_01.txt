And here is a brief English summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to strike or tax costs filed by the plaintiff, Viviriana Guatemala. The motion was filed in response to costs awarded to the defendants, Erika Derias and Regus Management Group, LLC, following their successful motion for summary judgment. The judge has denied the motion, finding that the defendants are entitled to costs as the prevailing party. The judge also rejected the plaintiff's arguments that the costs should be taxed due to the plaintiff's financial condition, and that the costs were incurred for frivolous or unnecessary purposes. The judge's ruling is based on the California Code of Civil Procedure and the Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA).
