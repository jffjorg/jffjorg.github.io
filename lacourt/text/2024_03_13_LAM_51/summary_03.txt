Summary:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge Upinder S. Kalra on a motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication filed by the Defendant, California Fair Plan Association. The motion seeks to dismiss the Plaintiff's claims for breach of contract, declaratory relief, and punitive damages. The court has denied the motion in part and granted it in part. The court finds that there are triable issues of material fact concerning the Plaintiff's alleged material misrepresentations and the Defendant's breach of the contract and the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. However, the court grants the motion as to punitive damages, finding that the Plaintiff has failed to raise a material issue of disputed fact that the Defendant acted with fraud, oppression, or malice.
