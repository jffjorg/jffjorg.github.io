Background
 
On July 24, 2923,
Jordan Clark filed this lemon law action against Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC;
LAD-MB, LLC dba Mercedes-Benz of Los Angeles, and Does 1 to 10. The Complaint
alleges three causes of action: (1) Breach of Express Warranty under the
Song-Beverly Act; (2) Violation of Section 1793.2 of the Song-Beverly Act, and
(3) Negligent Repair. 
 
Defendant LAD-MB,
LLC (hereinafter “Defendant”) has filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings
(“MJOP”) as to the third cause of action for negligent repair. Plaintiff
opposes the motion. The matter is now before the court. 
 
motion for
judgment on the pleadings[1]
 
I.         Legal Standard
“A motion for judgment on the pleadings performs the same
function as a general demurrer, and hence attacks only defects disclosed on the
face of the pleadings or by matters that can be judicially noticed.” (Burnett
v. Chimney Sweep (2004) 123 Cal.App.4th 1057, 1064.) “In deciding or
reviewing a judgment on the pleadings, all properly pleaded material facts are
deemed to be true, as well as all facts that may be implied or inferred from
those expressly alleged.” (Fire Ins. Exchange v. Superior Court (2004)
116 Cal.App.4th 446, 452.) When considering demurrers and judgment on the
pleadings, courts read the allegations liberally and in context. (Wilson v.
Transit Authority of City of Sacramento (1962) 199 Cal.App.2d 716, 720-21.)
A motion for judgment on the pleadings does not lie as to a portion of a cause
of action. (Id.) “In the case of either a demurrer or a motion for
judgment on the pleadings, leave to amend should be granted if there is any
reasonable possibility that the plaintiff can state a good cause of action.” (Gami
v. Mullikin Medical Ctr. (1993) 18 Cal.App.4th 870, 876.) A non-statutory
motion for judgment on the pleadings may be made any time before or during
trial. (Stoops v. Abbassi (2002) 100 Cal.App.4th 644, 650.)¿¿ 
 
II.        Request for Judicial Notice
 
Defendant requests judicial notice
of the following: 
 
1)    
Exhibit A: The Complaint in this lawsuit,
filed on 7/24/2023.
 
Defendant’s request for judicial
notice is granted. 
 
III.      Discussion
 
Defendants seek judgment on the
pleadings as to the third cause of action for “negligent repair” on the basis
that it is barred by the economic loss rule. 
 
The economic loss rule requires a
purchaser to recover in contract for purely economic loss due to disappointed
contractual expectations, unless he can demonstrate harm above and beyond a
broken contractual promise. (Robinson Helicopter Co. v. Dana Corp.
(2004) 34 Cal.4th 979, 988.) An “economic loss” consists of damages for
inadequate value, costs of repair, and replacement, or consequent loss of
profits, without any claim of personal injury or damages to other property. (Id.,
at p. at 988; see also Jimenez v. Superior Court (2002) 29 Cal.4th 473.)
“‘A person may not ordinarily recover in tort for the breach of duties that
merely restate contractual obligations. Instead, ‘[c]ourts will generally
enforce the breach of a contractual promise through contract law, except when
the actions that constitute the breach violate a social policy that merits the
imposition of tort remedies.’ [Citations.]” (Stop Loss Ins. Brokers, Inc. v.
Brown & Toland Medical Group (2006) 143 Cal.App.4th 1036, 1041.)
 
Defendant asserts Plaintiff’s third
cause of action is barred by the economic loss rule because the duty to repair arises
out of Plaintiff’s lease for the Subject Vehicle. (RJN, Ex. A.) “In short,
Plaintiff states no allegation of damages for the Third Cause of Action
independent of those allegations made under contract law, and presumably relies
on the fact that the Subject Vehicle allegedly has defect(s) that were not repaired.”
(MJOP at p. 2:3-5.) 
 
The court is not persuaded that
Plaintiff’s negligence cause of action arises out of the lease agreement. The
Complaint alleges that Plaintiff delivered the Subject Vehicle to Defendant for
repair during the express warranty period and that Defendant owed a duty to
Plaintiffs to use ordinary care and skill in the storage, preparation, and
repair of the Subject Vehicle. (Compl., ¶¶ 40, 41.) Defendant breached this
duty and proximately caused Plaintiff’s damages. (Compl., ¶¶ 42, 43.) Nowhere
in the Complaint does Plaintiff state that that the duty to repair arose out of
the lease agreement. 
 
A cause of action for negligent
repair may be found “where a person has negligently made repairs or
improvements upon the land or chattels of another whereby both become liable in
tort to a third person.” (De La Forest v. Yandle (1959) 171 Cal.App.2d
59, 61 [internal citation omitted].) “Any individual, partnership, corporation,
association, or other legal relationship which engages in the business of
providing service or repair to new or used consumer goods has a duty to the purchaser
to perform those services in a good and workmanlike manner.” (Civ. Code, §
1796.5.) Therefore, the duty to repair with reasonable care arises out of the
Defendant’s statutory obligations under the Song-Beverly Act. (See Yeh v.
Superior Court of Contra Costa County (2023) 95 Cal.App.5th 264, 278,
review granted Nov. 15, 2023.) “The sale contracts include no warranty . . . ,
nor any promise of repairs or other remedies in the event problems arise.” (Ford
Motor Warranty Cases (2023) 89 Cal.App.5th 1324, 1335 review granted Apr.
4, 2023; see also Montemayor v. Ford Motor Co. (2023) 92 Cal.App.5th 958
[accord].) 
 
Defendant cites no case law
showing that the duty to repair arises out of the lease agreement. Nor does
Defendant point to language in the sales agreement showing that Defendant’s
obligation to repair arises from the lease agreement. (See Davis v. Nissan
North America, Inc. (2024) 100 Cal.App.5th 825, 842 review granted May 29,
2024 [“Plaintiffs' claims against Nissan under these provisions of the
Song-Beverly Act (and their related negligent repair claim) are not
privity-based warranty claims arising under the UCC. Their Song-Beverly claims
are not founded on any term of the dealership sale agreement, ‘but instead seek
to recover based upon [Nissan]'s statutory obligations.’ ”].) 
 
To the extent that Defendants
argue that Plaintiff has not identified any specific damages amount against
Defendant, the Defendant waived this argument by raising it for the first time
on reply. (See Jay v. Mahaffey (2013) 128 Cal.App.4th 1522, 1538.) 
 
Therefore, Defendant’s Motion is
denied. 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant’s
motion for judgment on the pleadings is denied. Defendant to give notice.
