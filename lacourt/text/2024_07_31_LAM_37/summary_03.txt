Summary:
The Judge has denied the Defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings as to the third cause of action for "negligent repair". The Defendant argued that the duty to repair arises out of the lease agreement, but the Judge found that the Complaint alleges a duty to use ordinary care and skill in the storage, preparation, and repair of the Subject Vehicle, which arises out of the Song-Beverly Act. The Judge also rejected the Defendant's argument that the Plaintiff did not identify any specific damages amount against the Defendant, finding that the Defendant waived this argument by raising it for the first time on reply.
