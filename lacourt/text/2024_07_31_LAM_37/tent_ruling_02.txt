[1] CCP § 430.41 requires the moving
parties to meet and confer prior to filing a demurrer. Defense counsel’s
declaration fails to allege facts showing that after Plaintiff filed the FAC,
Defense counsel met and conferred with Plaintiff’s counsel to address the
deficiencies that appeared in the FAC. “Any determination by the court that the meet and confer process was
insufficient shall not be grounds to overrule or sustain a demurrer.” (CCP, §
430.41(a)(4).) As the failure to meet and confer does not constitute grounds to
overrule a demurrer, the court continues on to consider the merits.
