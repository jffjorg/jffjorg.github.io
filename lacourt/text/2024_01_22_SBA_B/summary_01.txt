And here is the summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for judgment on the pleadings filed by the defendant, Centinela Valley Union High School District. The plaintiff, Jane Doe R.H., alleges childhood sexual abuse by an athletics coach and/or teacher at Leuzinger High School in 1993/1994. The defendant argues that the allegations are insufficient to constitute a cause of action because the plaintiff failed to comply with the claims presentation requirements of the Government Claims Act.

The judge has determined that the allegations are sufficient to constitute a cause of action and that the plaintiff has sufficiently alleged an exemption under the Tort Claims Act. The judge is inclined to determine that AB 218, which is a California law that revived claims for childhood sexual abuse, is constitutional. The judge has also determined that the defendant has not shown that the "gift clause" is applicable or triggered because there has been no determination of defendant's liability or allocation of public funds at the pleading stage.

The judge has denied the motion for judgment on the pleadings and ordered the plaintiff to give notice of the ruling.
