And here is a brief summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has issued a tentative ruling granting the defendant's motion to compel arbitration and stay the action. The court finds that an arbitration agreement exists between the plaintiff and defendant, and that the plaintiff did not opt-out of the agreement. The court also finds that the arbitration agreement is not unconscionable and that the delegation clause is clear and unmistakable. As a result, the court orders the plaintiff and defendant to arbitrate their disputes and stays the court action pending the outcome of the arbitration proceeding.
