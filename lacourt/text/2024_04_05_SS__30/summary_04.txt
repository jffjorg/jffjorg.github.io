And here is the English-text summary:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel further deposition answers from the Defendant's Person Most Qualified (PMQ). The Plaintiff argues that the PMQ did not answer questions after the Defendant's counsel's objections and instruction not to answer. The Defendant's Motion to Compel Plaintiff to Answer Deposition Questions and Request for Sanctions is continued to allow the parties to participate in an informal discovery conference (IDC) as required by the Eighth Amended Standing Order Re Personal Injury Procedures.

The Court finds that the parties have not complied with the requirements for a motion to compel discovery and orders the parties to participate in an IDC before the hearing on the Plaintiff's motion can be continued. The Court also notes that the 60-day deadline for making a motion to compel under CCP section 2025.480 is mandatory and that monetary sanctions are mandatory against an unsuccessful moving or opposing party unless they acted with substantial justification or imposition of sanctions would be unjust.
