And here is a summary of the document in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on the demurrer to the complaint. The defendant has moved to dismiss the lawsuit, arguing that the plaintiff's claims are insufficient and that the litigation privilege applies. The judge has sustained the demurrer, meaning that the lawsuit is dismissed without the option to amend the complaint. The judge's reasoning is based on the lack of sufficient factual allegations to support the plaintiff's claims, the application of the litigation privilege, and the failure to show that the defendant's statements were not made within the scope of his employment.
