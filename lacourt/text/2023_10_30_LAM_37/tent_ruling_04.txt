[1] Defendant again submits the
declaration of his counsel, Negin Yamini (“Yamini”), to demonstrate compliance
with statutory meet and confer requirements. Yamini sent a meet and confer
letter to Plaintiff and Plaintiff submitted a responsive letter on July 19,
2023. Yamini states that on February 23, 2023, counsel sent a meet and confer
letter to Plaintiff regarding the arguments raised in the instant demurrer. (Yamini
Decl. ¶¶ 3, 4.) The parties were unable to reach a resolution. The court finds
this is sufficient to satisfy the meet and confer requirement.
