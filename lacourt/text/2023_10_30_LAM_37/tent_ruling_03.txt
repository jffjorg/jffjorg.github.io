Background 
 
This action arises
out of alleged sexual advances made by Kario Harris (“Plaintiff”) to Paul
Luntumbuez (“Defendant”), and Defendant’s communications of the alleged hostile
work environment beginning in 2016. The Complaint alleges that Plaintiff is a
retired U.S. Army Forces Major, and Defendant is a U.S. Army Reservist SFC and
Human Resources Specialist in the Human Resources Department of the Department
of Veterans Affairs. Plaintiff alleges that beginning in 2016 and “continuing,”
Defendant made false statements and gave knowingly false testimony regarding
these alleged sexual advances to third parties. Plaintiff further contends
Defendant’s statements have been published on several websites and that these
statements will be published again in the future.  
 
Plaintiff’s
Complaint alleges four causes of action: (1) defamation, (2) intentional
infliction of emotional distress, (3) intentional interference with prospective
economic advantage, and (4) declaratory relief.
On January 4,
2023, the court sustained Defendant’s demurrer to the complaint and granted leave
to amend. On February 3, 2023, Plaintiff filed the First Amended Complaint
(“FAC”) alleging identical causes of action.
 
On May 31, 2023,
the court sustained Defendant’s demurrer to FAC with leave to amend. On June
26, 2023, Plaintiff filed the operative Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”)
alleging identical causes of action as the original Complaint. Plaintiff
opposes. 
 
DEMURRER
Discussion[1]
 
I.               
Legal Standard
 
A demurrer is an
objection to a pleading, the grounds for which are apparent from either the
face of the complaint or a matter of which the court may take judicial notice.
(CCP, § 430.30(a); see also Blank v.
Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) The purpose of a demurrer is to
challenge the sufficiency of a pleading “by raising questions of law.” (Postley v. Harvey (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d
280, 286.) The court “treat[s] the demurrer as admitting all material facts
properly pleaded, but not contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or
law. . . .” (Berkley v. Dowds (2007)
152 Cal.App.4th 518, 525.) “In the construction of a pleading, for the purpose
of determining its effect, its allegations must be liberally construed, with a
view to substantial justice between the parties.” (CCP, § 452; see also Stevens v. Sup. Ct. (1999) 75
Cal.App.4th 594, 601.) “When a court evaluates a complaint, the plaintiff is
entitled to reasonable inferences from the facts pled.” (Duval v. Board of Trustees (2001) 93 Cal.App.4th 902, 906.)  
 
The general rule
is that the plaintiff need only allege ultimate facts, not evidentiary facts. (Doe v. City of Los Angeles (2007) 42
Cal.4th 531, 550.)  All that is required
of a plaintiff, as a matter of pleading, even as against a special demurrer, is
that his complaint set forth the essential facts of the case with reasonable
precision and with sufficient particularity to acquaint the defendant with the
nature, source and extent of his cause of action.” (Rannard v. Lockheed Aircraft Corp. (1945) 26 Cal.2d 149, 156-157.)
“[D]emurrers for uncertainty are disfavored and are granted only if the
pleading is so incomprehensible that a defendant cannot reasonably respond.” (Mahan v. Charles W. Chan Ins. Agency, Inc. (2017)
14 Cal.App.5th 841, 848, fn. 3, citing Lickiss
v. Fin. Indus. Regulatory Auth. (2012) 208 Cal.App.4th 1125, 1135.) In
addition, even where a complaint is in some respects uncertain, courts strictly
construe a demurrer for uncertainty “because ambiguities can be clarified under
modern discovery procedures.” (Khoury v.
Maly’s of California, Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.)  
 
Demurrers do not lie as to only parts of causes of action
where some valid claim is alleged but “must dispose of an entire cause of
action to be sustained.” (Poizner v.
Fremont General Corp. (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97, 119.) “Generally it is
an abuse of discretion to sustain a demurrer without leave to amend if there is
any reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by amendment.” (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335,
349.)  
 
II.            
Analysis
 
A.        First Cause of Action: Defamation
 
Defamation
has two forms—libel and slander. (Civ. Code, § 44.) “Libel is a false
and unprivileged publication by writing, printing … which [in
relevant part] exposes any person to hatred, contempt, ridicule, or
obloquy, … or which has a tendency to injure him in his
occupation.” (Civ. Code, § 45.) “Slander is a false and unprivileged
publication, orally uttered, and also communications by radio or any mechanical
or other means which [in relevant part]: … 3. Tends directly to
injure him in respect to his office, profession, trade or business, either by
imputing to him general disqualification in those respects which the office or
other occupation peculiarly requires, or by imputing something with reference
to his office, profession, trade, or business that has a natural tendency to
lessen its profits….” (Civ. Code, § 46 subd. (3).) “To prevail on a
claim for defamation, plaintiff must show four elements: that defendants
published the statements; that the statements were about plaintiff; that they
were false; and that defendants failed to use reasonable care to determine the
truth or falsity.” (Hecimovich v. Encinal School Parent
Teacher Org. (2012) 203 Cal.App.4th 450, 470.)   
 
First,
Defendant contends that the October 2017 and September 2018 statements are
barred by the one-year statute of
limitations under Code of Civil Procedure section 340(c). (Demurrer at p. 6.) Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 340, subdivision (c), the statute
of limitations is one year for “[a]n action for libel, slander, false
imprisonment...” (CCP, § 340(c).) 
 
In sustaining the
demurrers to the original Complaint and the FAC, the court found that the
pleading lacked sufficient factual allegations to show that the alleged slander
or defamatory statements continued since 2016. The SAC asserts he did not learn
of the September 2018 and December 2021 defamatory statements “were unbeknownst
to Plaintiff, Kario Harris, until 13 February 2023.” (SAC ¶ 5 at p. 4:5-16.)
“The delayed discovery rule permits the statute of limitations to be rest to 13
February 2023. Proof of the behaviors exhibited by Offending Defendant, Paul
Luntumbuez, was only revealed to Plaintiff, Kario Harris, on 13 February 2023.
(SAC ¶ 3 at p. 17:20-24.) 
 
The FAC was filed on February
3, 2023, wherein Plaintiff alleged knowledge of the December 2021 statement in
which Defendant allegedly communicated to third parties that Plaintiff was
stalking and sexually harassing Defendant. (SAC ¶ 7 at p. 5:12-17.) In fact,
the SAC states that Plaintiff was aware from “2016 and continuing” that
Defendant had made maliciously false statements about Plaintiff. (SAC ¶ 8 at p.
6:8.) Because the allegations in the FAC belies the assertion in the SAC that
Plaintiff first discovered the December 2021 defamatory statement on February 13,
2023. Under the sham pleading doctrine, the court may disregard this factual
allegation. (See Larson v. UHS of Rancho Springs, Inc. (2014) 230
Cal.App.4th 336, 343.) Therefore, it remains unclear when Plaintiff first
learned about the December 2021 defamatory statement. 
 
As
to the October 2017 defamatory statement, the SAC alleges that in October 2018,
the Defendant revised the October 2017 defamatory statement to a Fort Irwin
Criminal Investigator. Plaintiff does not state when he learned about the
October 2017 and October 2018 statements or allege any facts to show that the
applicable one-year statute of limitations does not bar these claims. (SAC ¶ 4
at p. 4:1-5.) As to the September 2018 defamatory statement, the SAC alleges
that Plaintiff did not learn that the statement had been made “until 27 October
2019 when Plaintiff, Kario Harris, received via US postal mailing” the withheld
statement. (SAC ¶ 4 at p. 4:5-7.) Therefore, under the one-year statute of
limitations, Plaintiff had until October 27, 2020, to bring a claim but the
action was not filed the Complaint until July 26, 2021, after the claim lapsed.

 
The SAC alleges that the
statute of limitations is delayed for one year under Code of Civil Procedure
section 351 because “Offending Defendant, Paul Luntumbuez departed California
to relocate to Texas on or about September 2021[.]” (SAC ¶ 5 at p. 6:2-3.)
However, the statute of limitations for the September 2018 defamatory statement
had already lapsed by September 2021. 
 
Second, Defendants argue
that the October 2017, December 2021, and October 2022 statements are
privileged. The SAC alleges that the October 2017 and December 2021 defamatory statements
“were made under oath during the course of an official investigation[.].” (SAC
¶ 5 at p. 5:15.) 
 
“In December 2021 and
again in October 2022 Offending Defendant, Paul Luntumbuez, communicated of
third parties by making knowingly false and malicious statements in sworn
testimony and emails[.]” (SAC ¶ 12 at p. 14:8-10.) “In October 2018 Offending
Defendant, Paul Luntumbuez, revised his October 2017 knowingly false
statement and malicious statement and provided to third party, Fort Irwin Criminal
Investigator (name withheld).” (SAC ¶ 4 at p. 4:1-3.) 
 
“Statements
made in official proceedings are protected by the litigation privilege [citation],
as are ‘communications made to instigate an official investigation and in
connection with the investigation once commenced’ [citation].” (Bonni v. St. Joseph Health System (2022) 83 Cal.App.5th
288, 302.) “The litigation privilege gives all persons the right to report
crimes to the police or an appropriate regulatory agency, even if the report is
made in bad faith.” (Hansen v. California Dept. of Corrections and
Rehabilitation (2008) 171 Cal.App.4th 1537, 1546.) “Such a communication, which is designed
to prompt action by that government entity, is as much a part of an “official
proceeding” as a communication made after an official investigation has commenced.”
(Ibid.)
Here, Plaintiff fails to show that the litigation privilege does not apply to
Defendant’s statements, even if the statements are false and made with malice. 
 
Lastly, Defendant argues that
Defendant’s statements are protected by the Federal Tort Claims Act and the
Westfall Act because the statements were made while Defendant was acting within
the scope of his employment. ((Demurrer at p. 7.) The SAC fails to allege facts
to show that Defendant was not acting within the scope of his employment when
the defamatory statements were made, and the Federal Tort Claims Act and
Westfall Act do not bar Plaintiff’s claims.  
 
For the reasons set forth above, the demurrer to the first
cause of action is sustained without leave to amend. 
B.        Second Cause of Action: Intentional
Infliction of Emotional Distress
 
“To state
a cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress a plaintiff
must show: (1) outrageous conduct by the defendant; (2) the defendant's
intention of causing or reckless disregard of the probability of causing
emotional distress; (3) the plaintiff's suffering severe or extreme emotional
distress; and (4) actual and proximate causation of the emotional distress by
the defendant's outrageous conduct.” (Yau v. Santa Margarita Ford, Inc.
(2014) 229 Cal.App.4th 144.) To satisfy the “outrageous conduct” element, the
plaintiff must allege conduct “so extreme as to exceed all bounds of that
usually tolerated in a civilized community . . . “(Cochran v. Cochran (1998)
65 Cal.App.4th 488, 494.)  
 
The
demurrer to the second cause of action is also sustained because Plaintiff
fails to show that the litigation privilege does not apply to Defendant’s
alleged defamatory claims. “[T]he
[Litigation] privilege is ‘an absolute privilege, and it bars all tort causes of action except a claim
of malicious prosecution.’
[Citation.] (Kenne v. Stennis (2014) 230 Cal.App.4th 953, 965 [internal
quotations omitted].)  The SAC fails to show that Defendant was not acting within the scope of his employment
when the defamatory statements were made, and the Federal Tort Claims Act and
Westfall Act do not bar Plaintiff’s claims. 
 
Thus, the demurrer to the second cause of action
is sustained without leave to amend. 
 
B.        Third Cause of Action: Intentional Interference with
Prospective Economic Advantage
 
A cause
of action for intentional interference with economic relationship (“IIER”)
requires proof of (a) a valid and existing contract, (b) knowledge of the
contract and intent to induce breach, (c) breach of contract, (d) breach caused
by defendant’s unjustified or wrongful conduct, and (e) damages.  (Dryden
v. Tri-Valley Growers (1977) 65 Cal.App.3d 990,
995.)  “While a plaintiff may satisfy the intent requirement for
[IIER] by pleading specific intent, i.e., that the defendant desired to
interfere with the plaintiff’s prospective economic advantage, a plaintiff may
alternately plead that the defendant knew that the interference was certain or
substantially certain to occur as a result of its action.”  (Korea
Supply Co. v. Lockheed Martin Corp. (2003) 29 Cal.4th 1134, 1154, 1157
(Korea Supply).)  “While intentionally interfering with an existing
contract is ‘a wrong in and of itself’ [citation], intentionally interfering
with a plaintiff’s prospective economic advantage is not.  To
establish a claim for interference with prospective economic advantage,
therefore, a plaintiff must plead that the defendant engaged in an
independently wrongful act.  [Citation.]”  (Id., at p. 1158.) 
 
The court
sustains the demurrer to the third cause of action on the same basis as the
second cause of action, meaning that Plaintiff has failed to show that the
litigation privilege does not apply, and that Plaintiff’s claims are not barred
by the Federal Tort Claims Act and Westfall Act. 
 
C.        Fourth Cause of Action: Declaratory
Relief
 
“A complaint for declaratory relief is legally sufficient if it
sets forth facts showing the existence of an actual controversy relating to the
legal rights and duties of the parties under a written instrument or with
respect to property and requests that the rights and duties of the parties be
adjudged by the court.... If these requirements are met and no basis for
declining declaratory relief appears, the court should declare the rights of
the parties whether or not the facts alleged establish that the plaintiff is
entitled to favorable declaration.” (Wellenkamp v. Bank of
America (1978) 21 Cal.3d 943, 947 [citations omitted].)
 
As this
court has sustained the demurrer to the first three causes of action and there
is no present controversy, the court also sustains the demurrer to the claim
for declaratory relief without leave to amend. 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant’s
demurrer is sustained without leave to amend.
