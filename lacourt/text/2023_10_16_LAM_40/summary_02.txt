And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendants' motion to bifurcate the trial regarding whether they owed a duty of care to the plaintiff. The motion was denied. The Judge found that bifurcation would not promote judicial economy in this case, as the evidence and witnesses would likely overlap and the need to litigate what is and is not relevant to the first phase would absorb more time than usual. Additionally, the Judge was concerned that at least two of the causes of action do not necessarily require a finding of duty in order for the jury to find for the plaintiff. The defendants had argued that bifurcation was necessary to avoid introducing unnecessary evidence and to prevent the determination of liability from being tainted by irrelevant, confusing, and prejudicial evidence. However, the Judge found that the defendants' arguments were not convincing, and that proceeding with bifurcation would likely lead to more time-consuming and complex litigation.
