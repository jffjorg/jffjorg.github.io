Significant Statements:
* "The granting of a mandatory injunction pending trial is not permitted except in extreme cases where the right thereto is clearly established." (Teachers Ins. & Annuity Assoc. v. Furlotti (1990) 70 Cal.App.4th 1487)
* "An evaluation of the relative harm to the parties upon the granting or denial of a preliminary injunction requires consideration of: '(1) the inadequacy of any other remedy; (2) the degree of irreparable injury the denial of the injunction will cause; (3) the necessity to preserve the status quo; [and] (4) the degree of adverse effect on the public interest or interests of third parties the granting of the injunction will cause.'" (Vo v. City of Garden Grove (2004) 115 Cal.App.4th 425, 435)
* "The Court finds that Plaintiff Garcia offers minimal but sufficient evidence in support of her disability."
* "Plaintiff Garcia has not sufficiently established the likelihood of success on the merits as to her alleged necessity for parking accommodation to afford her an equal opportunity to use and enjoy the dwelling."
* "The Court notes that it is not finding that Plaintiff could not convince a jury of the merit of her FEHA claim, but rather, that based on the record before the Court, the Court cannot determine for affirmative injunction purposes that Plaintiff has 'clearly established' her right to a parking space on the Subject Property."
* "The Court need not reach the balancing of harms but does note that the necessity to preserve the status quo weighs against the injunction."
* "The Court notes that questions exist as to the adequacy of remedy at law, e.g., the reduction in rent that Plaintiff Garcia has been receiving based on the termination of her entitlement to parking space at the Subject Property, some other kind of monetary compensation, or even taking Defendants up on their offer to assist with an application to designate the sidewalk in front of the Property as disabled parking."

Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has denied Plaintiff Ana Maria Garcia's motion for preliminary injunction, which sought to require Defendants to restore her parking space at the Subject Property. The court found that Plaintiff failed to establish a likelihood of success on the merits of her claim, specifically that she did not show that she had a necessity for parking accommodation to afford her an equal opportunity to use and enjoy the dwelling. The court also found that the balance of harms did not tip in Plaintiff's favor, noting that the necessity to preserve the status quo weighed against the injunction and that questions existed as to the adequacy of remedy at law.
