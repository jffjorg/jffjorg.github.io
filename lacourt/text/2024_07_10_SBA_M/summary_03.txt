And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied, in part, and granted, in part, the defendant's motion to deem requests for admissions admitted or to compel responses and for monetary sanctions. The defendant had served requests for admissions on May 15, 2024, but the plaintiff did not serve responses until June 25, 2024, after the motion was filed. The court found that the responses were in substantial compliance with CCP ยง 2033.220 and therefore denied the motion to deem the requests for admissions admitted. However, the court granted the defendant's request for monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,462.25, which is payable within 30 days of the date of the ruling. The sanctions are a result of the plaintiff's failure to serve a timely response to the requests for admissions, which necessitated the defendant's motion.
