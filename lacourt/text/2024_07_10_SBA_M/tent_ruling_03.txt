Pourtemour’s Motion for an Order Deeming Requests for Admissions Admitted or in
the Alternative to Compel Responses to Requests for Admissions, Set One, and

TENTATIVE RULING

Jamshied Pourtemour’s Motion for an Order Deeming
Requests for Admissions Admitted or in the Alternative to Compel Responses to
Requests for Admissions, Set One, and Form Interrogatories, Set Two, and for
Monetary Sanctions is denied, in part, and granted, in part. 
 
Background
 
Plaintiffs Complaint was filed on April 21, 2022.
Plaintiffs allege the following facts. Plaintiffs were purchasers and
Defendants were sellers of real property and executed a purchase agreement.
Defendants failed to fulfil the contract and complete the transaction.
Plaintiffs allege causes of action for specific performance and breach of
contract.
 
Motions to Deem
Admitted
 
Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280 states:
“If a party to whom requests for admission are directed
fails to serve a timely response, the following rules apply:
(a) The party to whom the requests for admission are
directed waives any objection to the requests, including one based on privilege
or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section
2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that party from this waiver on its
determination that both of the following conditions are satisfied:
(1) The party has subsequently served a response that
is in substantial compliance with Sections 2033.210, 2033.220, and 2033.230.
(2) The party's failure to serve a timely response was
the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.
(b) The requesting party may move for an order that
the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the
requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010).
(c) The court shall make this order, unless it finds
that the party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has
served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests
for admission that is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220. It is
mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing
with Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to
serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion.”
 
Defendant served upon Plaintiff Peter Maginiss Requests
for Admissions, Set One, on May 15, 2024.  (Decl., Christine Miller, ¶ 4.)  Defendant contends that no responses were
served to the discovery request.  (Id. at
¶ 6.)  Plaintiff filed a written
opposition to the motion and attached the responses to the Requests for
Admissions that were served on June 25, 2024 – after the motion was filed.
 
The responses are in substantial compliance with CCP §
2033.220. Thus, the motion to deem Requests for Admissions, Set One, is denied.
However, as noted above, sanctions are mandatory. 
 
Sanctions
 
Defendant’s request for monetary sanctions is granted.
 Plaintiff cites Demyer v. Costa Mesa
Mobile Home Estates (1995) 36 Cal.App.4th 393, 401 for the proposition that
sanctions cannot be awarded when a motion is heard on shortened time.  Demyer does not stand for the
proposition.  Instead, Demyer
merely states that requests for admissions cannot be deemed admitted so long as
responses are served within the normal 16-day time period that would have been
given had the motion not been heard on shortened time.
 
Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s counsel are sanctioned the
total amount of $1,462.25 which is calculated at 4 hours to prepare and appear
at $350 per hour, plus 1 filing fee of $62.25. 
 
Sanctions are payable within 30 days of this date.
 
Defendant is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
