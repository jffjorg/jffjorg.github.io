And here is the English text summary of the tentative ruling:

The Court grants in part and denies in part Plaintiff's motions to compel further responses to special interrogatories and request for production of documents. The Court grants the motions with respect to interrogatory numbers 45 and 46, but only if the responses are limited to the same defect alleged by Plaintiff and to vehicles sold in California for the past five years. The Court denies the motions with respect to interrogatory numbers 47 and 48 because they are too broad and not relevant to the defects alleged by Plaintiff. The Court also grants the motion to compel further responses to request number 18, but only if the requests are limited to the same defect and vehicles sold in California for the past five years.
