And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling denies the defendant's motion to stay the action in seven child sexual assault cases against the ABC Unified School District. The defendant had requested judicial notice of certain court filings and argued that the court should stay the action pending the resolution of two matters before the California Courts of Appeal. However, the court finds that the defendant applied the incorrect law and that staying the action would not promote judicial economy. The court concludes that the litigation should proceed and that the parties can engage in discovery and motion work if settlement negotiations are unsuccessful.
