And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling in the case of Tonia and Allen Flores v. Safeco Insurance (Case No. 23NWCV03289) continues the plaintiffs' motion to compel arbitration to July 10, 2024. The plaintiffs, who were injured in a car collision caused by unknown defendants, seek to arbitrate their dispute with the defendant insurance company. The court finds that the plaintiffs did not establish that they served the defendant with the instant motion and did not submit proof of service. However, since the defendant filed an opposition on June 4, 2024, the issue appears moot. The court will give the defendant notice of the continued hearing and sets the new hearing date for July 10, 2024, at 10:30 A.M. in Dept. SE-C.
