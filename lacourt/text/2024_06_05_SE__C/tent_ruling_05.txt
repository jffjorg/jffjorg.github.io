TENTATIVE
RULING
 
Plaintiff
Ryan Thornton’s motion for interlocutory judgment of partition and appointment
of referee is DENIED.
 
Moving
Party to give NOTICE.
 
The
motion is unopposed as of May 29, 2024. 
 
 
This action seeks a partition by sale of a single-family
residence located at 16531 Diane Avenue, Bellflower, California 90706 (“Subject
Property”). Currently, Plaintiff Ryan Thornton (“Plaintiff”) and Defendants Taelor
Thornton and Tierre Thornton (“Defendants”) each allegedly hold a one-third
interest as joint tenants.  On March 15,
2023, Plaintiff filed the operative First Amended Complaint against Defendants
for Partition by Sale of Real Property.  
 
Plaintiff
moves for interlocutory judgment of partition and appointment of referee. 
 
Discussion
 
A co-owner of real or personal
property has the absolute right to bring an action for partition. (De Roulet v.
Mitchel (1945) 70 Cal.App.2d 120, 123-124; CCP § 872.210.) A
partition serves to segregate and terminate “common interests in the same
parcel of property.’ [Citation.]” (14859 Moorpark
Homeowner’s Ass’n v. VRT Corp. (1998) 63
Cal.App.4th 1396, 1404-1405.) It permits co-owners to avoid the inconvenience
and dissension arising from sharing joint possession of land, and it
facilitates transmission of title, thereby avoiding unreasonable restraints on
the use and enjoyment of property.  (Cummings v. Dessel (2017)
13 Cal.App.5th 589, 596-597, internal quotation marks and citations
omitted.) The opposing party may defeat a motion for interlocutory
judgment for partition by demonstrating that there exist triable
issues of fact.  (Williams v. Williams (1967) 255 Cal.
App. 2d 648, 652.) 
 
If the court finds that the
plaintiff is entitled to such equitable remedy, it must “make an interlocutory
judgment that determines the interests of the parties in the property,” and
order the partition of the property and the manner of partition.  (Code
Civ. Proc., §§ 872.720(a), 872.810(a).) 
 
Here, Plaintiff indicates he
wishes to sell the Subject Property, but Defendants are refusing to
cooperate.  Plaintiff contends he is
entitled to an interlocutory judgment to partition the Subject Property as a
matter of law. (Mot., at pgs. 6 to 9.) 
 
Section
872.710, subdivision (a) states: “At the trial, the court shall determine
whether the plaintiff has the right to partition.”  (Code Civ. Proc., §
872.710, subd. (a).)  “If the court finds that the plaintiff is entitled
to partition, it shall make an interlocutory judgment that determines the
interests of the parties in the property and orders the partition of the
property and, unless it is to be later determined, the manner of
partition.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 872.720, subd. (a).)  Viewed
together, sections 872.710, subdivision (a) and 872.720, subdivision (a)
indicate that a court’s determination regarding an interlocutory judgment is to
be made at trial, or by means of a properly filed dispositive motion as allowed
under the Code of Civil Procedure.   
 
In sum, Plaintiff fails to demonstrate that he is
entitled to an interlocutory judgment through a non-dispositive motion, rather
than by means of trial, summary judgment motion, motion for judgment on the
pleadings, or other properly filed dispositive motion.  
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s motion is DENIED.
