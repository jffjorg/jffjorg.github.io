TENTATIVE
RULING
 
Plaintiffs
Tonia and Allen Flores’s motion to compel arbitration is CONTINUED.
 
Moving
Party to give NOTICE.
 
 
On September 28, 2022, DOE defendants 1 through
25 collided with the vehicle driven by plaintiff Allen Burton Flores, causing
it to collide with another vehicle driven by plaintiff Tonia Andrus Flores. DOE
defendants 1 through 25 did not stop and identify themselves. Plaintiffs
submitted the claim arising out of the collision to defendant Safeco Insurance,
which provides them uninsured and underinsured motorist automobile coverage. 
 
Plaintiffs move to compel arbitration.  Respondent filed a late opposition on June 4,
2024.  
 
Discussion
 
Parties may be compelled to arbitrate a dispute upon the court finding
the following: (1) there was a valid agreement to arbitrate between the
parties; and (2) said agreement covers the controversy or controversies in the
parties’ dispute.¿(Code Civ. Proc., § 1281.2; Omar v. Ralphs Grocery Co.
(2004)¿118 Cal.App.4th 955, 961.)
 
A party petitioning to compel arbitration has the burden of establishing
the existence of a valid agreement to arbitrate and the party opposing the
petition has the burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, any
fact necessary to its defense. (Banner Entertainment, Inc. v. Super. Ct.¿(1998)
62 Cal.App.4th 348, 356-57.) 
 
Plaintiffs did not establish that they served
Defendant with the instant motion. They did not submit proof of service. Generally,
a noticed motion must be given whenever the order sought may affect the
opposing party’s rights. (McDonald v. Severy (1936) 6 Cal.2d 629, 631.)  However, the issue appears moot because
Respondent filed an opposition on June 4, 2024. 

 
On its own motion, the Court continues
Plaintiff’s motion to compel arbitration to Wednesday, July 10, 2024 at 10:30
A.M. in Dept. SE-C.  Reply is due July 2,
2024.
