   [1] The Court notes that the proofs of  service attached to Defendant Pham’s motion for summary judgment do not  indicate how the documents were served, but the Court infers that service was  proper given Plaintiff’s notice of non-opposition. (See Carlton v. Quint (2000)  77 Cal.App.4th 690, 697 [failure to raise service issues in opposition waives  issue on appeal].)   [2] The Court notes that the Second Cause  of Action for statutory elder abuse is not alleged against Dr. Pham, so there  is no other cause of action to assess in this motion. (FAC, 8:15-16.)
