And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering two motions: one for leave to amend the complaint and one for summary judgment. The plaintiff, Young Kook Choi, is seeking to amend the complaint to add new claims for fraud, breach of contract, and breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing based on the discovery that the defendant, Pennymac, returned the $80,000 mortgage relief funds to the State of California. The defendant opposes the amendment, claiming that the plaintiff did not comply with the applicable California Rules of Court and that the amendment would be futile.

The judge grants the motion for leave to amend the complaint, finding that the plaintiff has substantially complied with the applicable rules and that the court may impose conditions to limit any prejudice to the defendant. The judge orders the plaintiff to file the proposed First Amended Complaint within seven days of the ruling.

The motion for summary judgment is continued pending the filing of the amended complaint.
