STATEMENT OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS: 
 
On September 21, 2023, Plaintiff Young Kook Choi (Plaintiff)
filed a Complaint against Defendant Pennymac (Defendant) with two causes of
action for: (1) Declaratory Relief and (2) Preliminary and Permanent
injunction.
 
According to the Complaint, Defendant financed $980,000 at
5.125% interest for Plaintiff’s real property. Plaintiff alleges that due to
COVID-19, he became delinquent and applied for a Loan Modification which
reduced the interest rate to 4.375%. Plaintiff further alleges that he applied
to the State of California Mortgage Relief fund which funds were sent to
Pennymac directly and Pennymac, for unknown reason, increased the interest
rate. Plaintiff now contends that Pennymac should have applied the $80,000 of
Mortgage Relief funds to the original delinquent amount and the interest rate
should remain at 4.375%.
 
On February 16, 2024, Defendant filed an Answer.
 
On October 23, 2024, Defendant filed a Motion for Summary
Judgment (MSJ).
 
On December 23, 2024, Plaintiff filed an opposition to the
MSJ and moved ex parte for an Order
Granting Leave to Amend the Complaint, Shortening Time on a Hearing to Amend
the Complaint, and Continuing the Hearing Date on the MSJ.
 
On December 24, 2024, the court GRANTED the ex parte application in part, setting a
hearing on Plaintiff’s Motion for Leave to Amend the Complaint for January 17,
2025.
 
On January 9, 2025, Defendant filed an opposition to the
Motion for Leave to Amend.
 
LEGAL STANDARD: 
 
Motion
for Leave to Amend
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (a)(1)
provides, in relevant part: “[t]he court may . . . in its discretion, after
notice to the adverse party, allow, upon any terms as may be just, an amendment
to any pleading . . . .” The court may, in furtherance of justice, allow the
amendment of any pleading at any time before or after commencement of trial. (Code
Civ. Proc., (CCP) § 576.) 
 
“[T]he court’s discretion will usually be exercised
liberally to permit amendment of the pleadings. The policy favoring amendment
is so strong that it is a rare case in which denial of leave to amend can be
justified.” (Howard v. County of San
Diego (2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 1422, 1428 [internal citations omitted].) “If
the motion to amend is timely made and the granting of the motion will not
prejudice the opposing party, it is error to refuse permission to amend . . .
.” (Morgan v. Sup. Ct. (1959) 172
Cal.App.2d 527, 530.) Prejudice includes “delay in trial, loss of critical
evidence, or added costs of preparation.” (Solit
v. Tokai Bank, Ltd. New York Branch (1999) 68 Cal.App.4th 1435,
1448.) 
 
California Rules of Court, rule 3.1321(a) requires that a
motion to amend must: “[i]nclude a copy of the proposed. . .  amended
pleading. . . [and] state what allegations in the previous pleading are
proposed to be [deleted and/or added], if any, and where, by page, paragraph,
and line number, the [deleted and/or additional] allegations are located . . .
.”  
 
In addition, rule 3.1324(b) states: “[a] separate
declaration must accompany the motion and must specify: (1) The effect of the
amendment; (2) Why the amendment is necessary and proper; (3) When the facts
giving rise to the amended allegations were discovered; and (4) The reasons why
the request for amendment was not made earlier.” 
 
ANALYSIS: 
 
Motion for Leave to
Amend
 
Plaintiff contends that Defendant’s indication that they
returned the $80,000 to the State of California requires Plaintiff to amend the
Complaint concerning the first cause of action.[1]
Plaintiff additionally contends that the new fact that Defendant returned the
funds to the State of California possibly warrants adding three new claims for
fraud, breach of contract, and breach of implied covenant of good faith and
fair dealing. Defendant argues that leave to amend should not be granted
because Plaintiff did not comply with the applicable CRC, Defendant would be
prejudiced by an amendment, and the proposed amendment would be futile.[2]
 
Here, leave to amend is proper. First, Plaintiff has substantially
complied with CRC Rule 3.1324. Plaintiff included a separate declaration that
included the effect of the amendment (adding one new fact and resulting causes
of action), stating why the amendment is necessary and proper, that the facts
were discovered on October 21, 2024, and that as a result the amendment was not
made sooner. (Kim Decl. ¶¶ 3-4.) Second, the court may impose conditions to
limit any prejudice to Defendant.[3]
(CCP §§ 473(a)(1), 576.) The condition here is simple: Plaintiff may file the
proposed First Amended Complaint but the court will not grant leave to amend
again should Defendant succeed on a subsequent demurrer or motion to strike. 
 
Accordingly, the court GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion for
leave to file the proposed First Amended Complaint.
 
Motion for Summary
Judgment
 
In light of the foregoing ruling, the Motion for Summary
Judgment, is continued.
 
CONCLUSION:
 
            For
the foregoing reasons, the court decides the pending motion as follows: 
 
1.      Motion
for Leave to File Amended Complaint is GRANTED;
2.      Plaintiff
is ordered to file the First Amended Complaint within seven (7) days of this
ruling;
Moving party is to give notice. 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
