And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling issued by the Judge on January 17, 2024, addresses the demurrer and motion to strike filed by the defendants, Calatlantic Group, Inc. and Lennar Title, Inc. (collectively, "Moving Defendants"), in response to the third amended complaint (TAC) filed by plaintiff Jerry R. Holly.

The Judge overruled the demurrer, finding that the plaintiff has sufficiently alleged an ownership interest in the Galloway property and that the defendants' conduct was wrongful. The Judge also found that the plaintiff has sufficiently alleged a violation of the Elder Abuse Act and the Unfair Business Practices Act.

The Judge granted the motion to strike paragraphs 57 and 70 of the TAC, which relate to attorney fees and punitive damages, as the plaintiff has not alleged any basis for recovering such damages. However, the Judge denied the motion to strike with respect to the plaintiff's prayer for punitive damages in his third cause of action for Financial Elder Abuse.

The Judge ordered the moving defendants to file their answer to the plaintiff's TAC within 30 days.
