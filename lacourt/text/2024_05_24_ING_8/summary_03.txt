Significant Statements:
  - "The fundamental purpose of the statute is to give defendants reasonable repose, that is, to protect parties from defending stale claims." (Jolly v. Eli Lilly & Co.)
  - "In judging the basis for potential tolling of the statute of limitations, the Court must have factual allegations in the pleading itself, not at a hearing on a demurrer, so the defendants can review those allegations and respond with a demurrer or other responsive pleading."
```

Summary: The Court's tentative ruling sustains the demurrer to the Plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint and orders the Bell Defendants to give notice. The Court finds that the Plaintiff's allegations are insufficient to state a cause of action and that the Plaintiff has not provided sufficient factual allegations to overcome the defects in the complaint.
