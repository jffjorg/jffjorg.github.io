And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The Court denied the Plaintiff's motion to consolidate two lawsuits, one an unlimited civil lawsuit and the other an unlawful detainer case. The Plaintiff, David Thompson Boyd, filed a complaint against the Defendant, Anuko Corporation, aka Amuko Corporation, on March 4, 2024. The Defendant filed an unlawful detainer case on March 21, 2024. The Plaintiff then filed a motion to consolidate the two lawsuits on May 1, 2024. The Court found that the Plaintiff did not comply with the procedural requirements of a motion to consolidate and that there was no evidentiary support for the motion. The Court also considered the potential prejudice to the Defendant if the two cases were consolidated and trial were delayed. The Court denied the motion to consolidate, citing the need for expedience in unlawful detainer cases and the potential for delay in an unlimited civil case.
