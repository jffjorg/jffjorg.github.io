to Strike
 
Defendant's Demurrer
is overruled. 
 
BACKGROUND
Plaintiff Niels F. Hayns
filed this lemon law action against American Honda
Motor Co. Inc. (Defendant), alleging that he purchased a 2022 Honda CR-V
(Vehicle), manufactured by defendant, the Vehicle exhibited defects within the warranty
period, and Defendant was failed to repair the vehicle within a reasonable number
of attempts. 
The causes of action are: (1) Violation of Civil Code section
1793.2, subdivision (d); (2) Violation of Civil Code section 1793.2, subdivision
(b); and (3) Violation of Civil Code section 1793.2, subdivision (a)(3).
The motion now before the Court is Defendant's Demurrer to the third cause
of action. 
 
LEGAL STANDARD
When considering demurrers, courts read the allegations liberally
and in context. Wilson v. Transit Authority of City of Sacramento (1962)
199 Cal.App.2d 716, 720-21. In a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent
on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial notice. Donabedian v. Mercury
Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994. “A demurrer tests the pleading alone,
and not on the evidence or facts alleged.” E-Fab, Inc. v. Accountants, Inc. Servs.
(2007) 153 Cal.App.4th 1308, 1315. As such, courts assume the truth of the complaint’s
properly pleaded or implied factual allegations. Ibid. However, it does not
accept as true deductions, contentions, or conclusions of law or fact. Stonehouse
Homes LLC v. City of Sierra Madre (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 531, 538. 
Leave to amend must be allowed where there is a reasonable possibility
of successful amendment. See Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 349
(court shall not "sustain a demurrer without leave to amend if there is any
reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by amendment"); Kong
v. City of Hawaiian Gardens Redevelopment Agency (2002) 108 Cal.App.4th 1028,
1037 ("A demurrer should not be sustained without leave to amend if the complaint,
liberally construed, can state a cause of action under any theory or if there is
a reasonable possibility the defect can be cured by amendment."). The burden
is on the complainant to show the Court that a pleading can be amended successfully.
Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.
 
ANALYSIS
In this Song-Beverly action, Defendant demurrers to the third
cause of action for violation of Civil Code section 1793.2 subdivision (a)(3). Defendant
argues this cause of action is insufficiently pleaded.
The Court finds that the third cause of action is sufficiently
pleaded. Civil Code section 1793.2 (a)(3) provides that a dealer must “[m]ake available
to authorized service and repair facilities sufficient service literature and replacement
parts to effect repairs during the express warranty period.” A pleading must allege
facts, not conclusions. Jones v. Grewe (1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 950, 954.) The
rules of pleading require only ultimate facts be alleged; evidentiary facts supporting
the allegation of ultimate fact need not be pleaded. McKelly v. Washington Mut.,
Inc. (2006) 142 Cal.App.4th 1457, 1469. “[I]t has long been recognized that
‘[the] distinction between conclusions of law and ultimate facts is not at all
clear and involves at most a matter of degree’…. What is important is that the
complaint as a whole contain sufficient facts to apprise the defendant of the
basis upon which the plaintiff is seeking relief.” Perkins v. Superior
Court (1981) 117 Cal.App.3d 1, 6 (quoting Burks v. Poppy Construction Co.
(1962) 57 Cal.2d 463, 473) (internal quotation marks omitted). 
Here, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant failed to make sufficient
service literature and replacement parts available to its authorized service
and repair facilities to effect repairs during the express warranty period. Comp.
¶ 30. He also alleges that Defendant’s representatives have failed to service
and/or repair the Vehicle to conform to the applicable warranties. Compl. ¶¶ 13-14.
Taken together, these allegations are sufficient to state a claim for violation
of section 1793.2 subdivision (a)(3). At the pleading stage, Plaintiff need not
identify what parts or literature Defendant failed to provide, as Defendant has
superior knowledge of what parts and literature it made available. See Okun
v. Superior Court (1981) 29 Cal.3d 442, 458 (“Less particularity is
required when it appears that defendant has superior knowledge of the facts, so
long as the pleading gives notice of the issues sufficient to enable
preparation of a defense.”) Accordingly, the demurrer is overruled.
 
CONCLUSION
Defendant's demurrer is overruled. Defendants have twenty
days to answer.
