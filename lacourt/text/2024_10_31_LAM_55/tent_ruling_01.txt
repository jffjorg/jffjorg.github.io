Plaintiffs' Motion
for Leave to File a Third Amended Complaint is denied without prejudice.

                                                                                                                                        
Plaintiffs Tacis, LLC and
Kent Limson filed this action against Defendants Jackie Robinson, Jr.; All Net,
LLC; AGS Assuerety, LLC; Timothy J. Arellano; and Dribble Dunk, LLC
(“Defendants”) seeking to collect on approximately $2 million in defaulted
loans. Plaintiffs allege that these were bridge loans to assist Loan
Defendants’ plans to construct an NBA arena in Las Vegas. The causes of action
in the operative Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”) are (1) Breach of Contract –
Business Loan and Security Agreement; (2) Breach of Contract – Bond and Loan
Agreement; (3) Breach of Contract – Memorandum; (4) Bad Faith; (5) Fraud; (6)
Negligent Misrepresentation; (7) Professional Negligence; (8) Common Counts;
and (9) Constructive Trust.
The motion now before the Court is Plaintiffs' Motion for Leave to File
a Third Amended Complaint (“TAC”). 
On 10/16/24, the Court entered the stipulation to
extend the time for Defendant All Net Land Development, LLC (“ALND”) to file a
response to the SAC. In that stipulation, ALND stated that it did not intend to
oppose Plaintiff’s motion for leave to file a TAC because Plaintiffs intend to
file the TAC to address ALND’s expected demurrer to the SAC. Indeed, ALND filed
a notice of non-opposition to the motion. The other defendants have not filed
any opposition to the motion. Given that defendants do not oppose the motion,
the Court granted Plaintiffs’ unopposed motion for leave to file the TAC.
Plaintiffs shall file and serve the TAC within 10 days of this order.
