And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a hearing regarding American Honda Motor Co. Inc.'s (Defendant) demurrer to the third cause of action in a lemon law action brought by Niels F. Hayns (Plaintiff). The Plaintiff alleges that the Defendant failed to make available sufficient service literature and replacement parts to authorized service and repair facilities to effect repairs during the express warranty period, and that the Defendant's representatives failed to service and/or repair the Vehicle to conform to the applicable warranties. The judge has ruled that the Plaintiff's allegations are sufficient to state a claim for violation of California Civil Code section 1793.2 subdivision (a)(3), and that the Defendant's demurrer is therefore overruled. The Defendant has 20 days to answer.
