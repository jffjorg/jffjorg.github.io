 Case Number:  23STCV12007    Hearing Date:   October 31, 2024    Dept:  55 23STCV12007
Motion to be Relieved as Attorney of Record
 
Counsel for Defendant Modern Stone, Inc. has filed a
motion to be relieved as counsel. 
“The determination whether to grant or deny an attorney’s
motion to withdraw as counsel of record lies within the sound discretion of the
trial court, having in mind whether such withdrawal might work an injustice in
the handling of the case.” Lempert v. Sup. Ct. (2003) 112
Cal.App.4th 1161, 1173. 
Here, the form notice, declaration, proposed order,
and proof of service sufficiently comply with the requirements for a motion to
be relieved as counsel. See
Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362. 
No opposing document has been filed showing any
prejudice to the client. See Rules Prof. Conduct, rule 1.16(d). 
Therefore, the motion is granted, and the Court will
sign the proposed order submitted by counsel.
