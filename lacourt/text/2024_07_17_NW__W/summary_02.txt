And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling is regarding a demurrer to the cross-complaint of Bryan Russolesi and a motion to strike. Defendant Knolton, Inc. demurs to the fraud cause of action on the grounds that it fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. The court finds that the fraud allegations are sufficient for the purposes of a demurrer. Russolesi alleges that Martia, on behalf of himself and the Cross-Defendants, including Knolton, misrepresented his intentions to repay the principal sum borrowed from Russolesi and the other lenders. The court finds that these allegations sufficiently plead the elements of fraud.

The court also rules on the motion to strike the cross-complaint, finding that Knolton, Inc. did not file its answer until December 29, 2023, and therefore did not need to file its cross-complaint at the same time. The court overrules the demurrer to the fraud cause of action and the demurrer to the cross-complaint.
