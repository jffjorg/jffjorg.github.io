And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The court has granted the Plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories and request for sanctions in part. The Plaintiff seeks to compel further responses to its first set of special interrogatories and monetary sanctions in the amount of $3,660.00 against the Defendant, Jaguar Land Rover North America, LLC, and its attorney of record, Turner Henningsen Wolf and Vandenburg LLP.

The Defendant argued that the motion was not served with sufficient notice and that the Plaintiff's motion is procedurally defective. However, the court finds that the Defendant was not prejudiced by the late filing and that the Plaintiff provided all the necessary information for a motion to compel compliance.

The court also finds that the Defendant's objections to certain special interrogatories are without merit or too general, and that the Plaintiff has shown good cause for the requested documents or information. Specifically, the court finds that the Defendant's policies and procedures are relevant to the case, as are the identity of witnesses and information about the Defendant's training and practices.

The court notes that the Defendant's response to the motion includes a statement that "discovery is continuing, and JLRNA reserves the right to supplement its response based upon further investigation." The court finds that this statement is not necessarily improper, but that if some information is present, it should be provided now.

Finally, the court denies the Plaintiff's request for sanctions in the amount of $3,660.00, finding that both parties' positions were substantially justified.
