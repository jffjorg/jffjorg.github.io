English-text summary:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to continue the trial date from July 20, 2024, to a date after January 2025. The motion was unopposed, as the parties had stipulated to a continuance. The plaintiff, Rose Vickers, argued that there had been a significant, unexpected change in the case, citing the recent substitution of new counsel due to a conflict with former counsel. However, the court found that the plaintiff failed to provide evidence or explain why the trial could not proceed as scheduled. As a result, the court denied the motion, concluding that a continuance was not in the interests of justice.
