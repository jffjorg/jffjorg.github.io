Summary:

The Hromadka Defendants, law firms or licensed attorneys, moved for summary judgment against Plaintiffs Virginia Coats Ashworth, Nancy Coats Routh, and Christy Lynn Coats, alleging that the claims for professional negligence and breach of fiduciary duty against them are meritless because they never represented Plaintiffs and never served as trust administration counsel for the trustees of the QTIP Trust. The Hromadka Defendants claim that they had limited assignments and duties regarding the administration of the QTIP trust and therefore had no knowledge of conflicts of interest or other breaches by the QTIP trustees.

However, Plaintiffs present evidence that the Hromadka Defendants were more involved in the QTIP trust than they suggest, including reviewing the trust instrument and related court documents, reviewing and preparing documents regarding removal/successor trustees, and reviewing long-term loans made by the trust to Laura. The Plaintiffs also present testimony from trustees and Hromadka attorneys that the Hromadka Defendants were more involved in the QTIP trust than they claim.

The Court finds that there are disputes of material fact regarding whether the Hromadka Defendants actively participated in breaches of fiduciary duties and whether they had knowledge of conflicts of interest or other breaches by the QTIP trustees. Therefore, the motion for summary judgment is denied.
