And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

This tentative ruling addresses the demurrer to the First Amended Complaint (FAC) and the motion to strike. The court finds that the FAC adequately pleads a claim for fraud and unfair competition against the defendants. The court also finds that the UCL claim is sufficient and that the plaintiff has stated a cause of action for punitive damages. The court denies the motion to strike and overrules the demurrer.
