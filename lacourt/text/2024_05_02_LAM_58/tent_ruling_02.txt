Case Name:                H
Mart KTown Plaza LLC v. Korean Shopping Center, Inc.  
Case No.:                    23STCV28800
Motion:                       Demurrer
to First Amended Complaint/Second Amended Complaint
Moving Party:             Defendant Korean Shopping Center, Inc.

Opposing Party:          None 

Tentative Ruling:      The
demurrer to the Second Amended Complaint is sustained. 

             
            This case arises out of a commercial
lease dispute. 
 
Plaintiff H Mart Ktown Plaza, LLC (Plaintiff) filed its Complaint against Defendant
Korean Shopping Center, Inc. (KSC) on November 27, 2023. Upon learning that the
Shopping Center had been sold to INI Investment Corp. on September 9, 2022,
Plaintiff filed its First Amended Complaint on December 20, 2023 to add INI
Investment Corp. as a defendant. Defendant INI Investment Corp. filed its
Answer to the First Amended Complaint on February 6, 2024. 
 
On February 21,
2024, Defendant KSC filed a demurrer to the First Amended Complaint. The
demurrer was set to be heard on April 12, 2024.  
 
Thereafter, Plaintiff
moved for leave to file a Second Amended Complaint (SAC). No opposition was
filed. The Court granted the motion and allowed Plaintiff leave to file a
Second Amended Complaint. Because of the minimal changes to the pleading – specifically
with respect to demurring Defendant KSC – the Court permitted the demurrer to
the FAC to apply to the SAC. Only the first cause of action for breach of the
lease is alleged against Defendant KSC.  
 
On March 21, 2024,
the Court re-set the hearing on KSC’s demurrer to the FAC/SAC to May 2, 2024.
No opposition has been filed.
 
The Court’s
tentative ruling is to sustain the demurrer to the Second Amended Complaint
with leave to amend.  Because no
opposition was filed, the Court wishes to hear from Plaintiff.  Because there may have been confusion about
when an opposition was due to the demurrer, the Court may consider continuing
the hearing to permit an opposition memorandum. 
 
Legal
Standard
 
            A
demurrer is an objection to a pleading, the grounds for which are apparent from
either the face of the complaint or a matter of which the court may take
judicial notice. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.30, subd. (a); see also Blank v.
Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) The purpose of a demurrer is to
challenge the sufficiency of a pleading “by raising questions of law.” (Postley
v. Harvey (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 280, 286.) “In the construction of a
pleading, for the purpose of determining its effect, its allegations must be
liberally construed, with a view to substantial justice between the parties.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 452.) The court “ ‘ “treat[s] the demurrer as admitting all
material facts properly pleaded, but not contentions, deductions or conclusions
of fact or law . . ..” ’ ” (Berkley v. Dowds (2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 518,
525.)  
 
Analysis 
            
Defendant
KSC demurs to the first cause of action for breach of the lease contract. 
To prevail
on a cause of action for breach of contract, the plaintiff must allege and prove
(1) the existence of a contract, (2) the plaintiff's performance of the
contract or excuse for nonperformance, (3) the defendant's breach, and (4) the
resulting damage to the plaintiff. (Careau & Co. v. Security Pacific
Business Credit, Inc. (1990) 222 Cal.App.3d 1371, 1388; Richman v.
Hartley (2014) 224 Cal.App.4th 1182, 1186.)
Both
the FAC and the SAC allege that Defendants failed to comply with their
maintenance obligations under Section 16.2 of the Lease; as result, on October
26, 2022, water leakage from the ceiling damaged the electrical bus bar,
resulting in a power outage affecting significant portions of the Shopping
Center, including where Plaintiff was renting space. (FAC ¶ 24; SAC ¶ 28.) 
 
The
pleadings also allege that Defendant INI Investment Corp., referred to in the
pleadings as Landlord, asked the Plaintiff to use the generator to supply power
to all of the affected areas of the Shopping Center, during repairs; in
exchange, the Landlord agreed to cover all generator rental expenses. (FAC ¶ 25;
SAC ¶ 29.) The pleadings allege that the Landlord did not timely complete the
repairs until January 19, 2023 – in violation of Article 16.2 and Article 20 of
the Lease. (FAC ¶ 26; SAC ¶ 30.) The Landlord further breached the Lease by
failing to reimburse Plaintiff for its costs and expenses incurred in renting
the generator. (FAC ¶ 30; SAC ¶ 34.) 
 
Defendant
KSC argues the breach of lease cause of action fails as to it because when the
alleged breach involving the leak occurred – October 26, 2022 – KSC was no
longer the landlord and no longer in a contractual relationship with Plaintiff.

 
Plaintiff
alleges that KSC and Plaintiff entered into a Retail Lease Agreement on October
15, 2018. Then, on September 9, 2022, KSC sold the building to INI Investments,
which opted to continue the existing lease with Plaintiff as the new landlord.
(FAC ¶¶ 8, 11; SAC ¶¶ 8, 11.)
 
The
FAC and the SAC fail to allege a contractual relationship between Defendant KSC
and Plaintiff that resulted in a breach. The demurrer on this ground is well
taken.[1]
 
Conclusion
 
              The
demurrer to the first cause of action as to Defendant KSC is sustained with
leave to amend.  Because Plaintiff has filed no opposition, the Court will inquire how it
wishes to proceed.  The options include continuing
the hearing to permit opposition, submitting on the tentative and amending the
first cause of action, or dismissing KSC from the action.
