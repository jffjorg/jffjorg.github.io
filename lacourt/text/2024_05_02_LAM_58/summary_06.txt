Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English:

The court grants the motion to quash service of summons brought by Defendant Mark Styslinger, finding that there is no personal jurisdiction over him. The court holds that the plaintiff, Stephen Snyder, has failed to establish the minimum contacts necessary to exercise jurisdiction over Defendant Styslinger. The court finds that Defendant Styslinger is a resident of Alabama and has no connection to California, and that the plaintiff's claims do not arise from any contacts that Defendant Styslinger has with California. The court also finds that the plaintiff's evidence is speculative and lacks foundation. As a result, the court grants the motion to quash and dismisses Defendant Styslinger from the case.
