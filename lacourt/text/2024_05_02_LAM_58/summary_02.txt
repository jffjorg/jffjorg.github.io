English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge in a commercial lease dispute between H Mart KTown Plaza LLC (Plaintiff) and Korean Shopping Center, Inc. (Defendant). The Defendant has filed a demurrer to the Second Amended Complaint, arguing that the breach of lease cause of action fails as to it because when the alleged breach occurred, the Defendant was no longer the landlord and no longer in a contractual relationship with the Plaintiff. The court has sustained the demurrer, ruling that the pleadings fail to allege a contractual relationship between the Defendant and the Plaintiff that resulted in a breach. The court is giving the Plaintiff an opportunity to amend its pleadings.
