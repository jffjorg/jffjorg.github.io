**Tentative Ruling**

The Judge, Theresa M. Traber, has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Lenny K. Dykstra v. Galanter Associates, et al. (Case No. 23STCV03186). The defendant, Douglas F. Galanter, individually and d/b/a Galanter Associates, has moved to quash service of the summons and complaint by publication.

The Judge finds that the motion to quash is untimely, as it was filed on September 8, 2023, after the last day to plead on September 11, 2023. Additionally, the defendant failed to timely serve the motion and did not obtain express consent from the plaintiff to receive electronic service.

As a result, the Judge denies the defendant's motion to quash and orders the defendant to file and serve an answer, demurrer, or other responsive pleading within 20 days of this order. The defendant is deemed to have made a general appearance in this action.
