And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the plaintiff's motion to compel responses to discovery requests and to deem the truth of matters and genuineness of documents in requests for admissions. The plaintiff's motion is granted in part and denied in part.

The judge is granting the motion to compel responses to the form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and requests for production, as the defendant has failed to respond to these requests. The judge is also granting the motion to deem the truth of matters and genuineness of documents in requests for admissions, as the defendant has failed to respond to these requests.

However, the judge is denying the plaintiff's request for sanctions, as the notice of motion does not state against whom the sanctions are sought, as required by the Discovery Act.

The judge is ordering the defendant to serve verified, code-compliant responses to the plaintiff's form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and requests for production without objections within 30 days of this order. The ruling is conditioned on the plaintiff's payment of $240 in additional filing fees.

The judge notes that combining multiple motions into one motion is improper and could unfairly jump ahead of other litigants. The judge is requiring the plaintiff to pay additional filing fees for what should have been four additional motions.
