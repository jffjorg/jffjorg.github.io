MOTION
TO COMPEL RESPONSES TO FORM INTERROGATORIES, SPECIAL INTERROGATORIES, AND
REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION, AND TO DEEM THE TRUTH OF MATTERS IN REQUESTS FOR
ADMISSIONS

 
MOVING PARTY:               Plaintiff Century Recovery, LLC 
 
RESPONDING PARTY(S): No response on
eCourt as of 10/9/23
 
STATEMENT
OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
            This is an action for breach of contract that was filed on July 27, 2022.
Plaintiff alleges that Defendant breached the terms of a loan agreement by
failing to make payments as required by its terms. 
 
Plaintiff moves to compel responses
to three sets of discovery and to deem the truth of matters in two sets of
requests for admissions as admitted. 
            
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
            Plaintiff’s
Motion to Compel Responses to Form Interrogatories – General, Special
Interrogatories (Set One), and Requests for Production (Set One) is GRANTED.
 
            Plaintiff’s
Motion to Deem the Truth of Matters and Genuineness of Documents in Requests
for Admissions as Admitted is GRANTED.
 
            Plaintiff’s
request for sanctions is DENIED. 
 
            Defendant
is ordered to serve verified, code-compliant responses to Plaintiff’s form
interrogatories, special interrogatories, and requests for production without
objections within 30 days of this order. 
 
            This
ruling is conditioned on Plaintiff’s payment of $240 in additional filing fees.
DISCUSSION:
 
Five Motions in One
 
            Plaintiff
has combined five motions in one: (1) a motion to compel responses to request
for production of documents and things (set one), (2) a motion to compel
responses to form interrogatories – general (set one), (3) a motion to compel
responses to special interrogatories (set one), (4) a motion to deem the truth
of matters in requests for admissions (set one), and (5) a motion to deem the
genuineness of documents identified in requests for admissions. 
 
            Multiple
motions should not be combined into a single filing.¿(See¿Govt. Code,¿§
70617(a)(4) [setting forth the required filing fee for each motion,
application, or any other paper or request requiring a hearing];¿see¿also¿Weil
& Brown, Civil Procedure Before Trial, [8:1140.1] at 8F-60 (The Rutter
Group 2011)¿[“Motions to compel compliance with separate discovery requests
ordinarily should be filed separately.”].) Plaintiff should have reserved five
separate hearings for three motions to compel and two motions to deem requests
for admission as admitted. Combining multiple motions under the guise of one motion with
one hearing reservation manipulates the Court Reservation System and unfairly
jumps ahead of other litigants. Moreover, combining motions to avoid payment of
separate filing fees deprives the Court of filing fees it is otherwise entitled
to collect.
 
            The Court’s
ruling on these motions is conditioned upon Plaintiff paying the additional
filing fees for what should have been four additional motions ($240). 
 
Motions to Compel Responses (x3)
 
Plaintiff moves to compel responses
to (1) a request for production of documents and things (set one); (2) form
interrogatories – general (set one), and special interrogatories (set one). 
 
Legal Standard
 
When a party to whom an inspection
demand or an interrogatory is directed fails to respond, a party making the
request may move for an order compelling responses. (Code Civ. Proc. §§
2030.290(b) [interrogatories]; 2031.300(b) [requests for production].) A party
who fails to provide timely responses waives any objection, including one based
on privilege or work product. (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 2030.290(a); 2031.300(a).)
For a motion to compel initial responses, no meet and confer is required. All
that must be shown is that a set of requests for production was properly served
on the opposing party, that the time to respond has expired, and that no
response has been served. (Leach v. Sup.
Ct. (1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 902, 905-06.)

Analysis
 
            Plaintiff
served Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, and Requests for
Production on Defendant via mail on January 11, 2023. (Declaration of Troy Q.
Strange ISO Mot. ¶ 3, Exh. 1.) Although responses were initially due on
February 15, 2023, extensions were provided first to February 24, 2023, and
then to March 6, 2023. (Strange Decl. ¶¶ 4-8.) To date, no responses have been
provided. (Id. ¶ 9.) Plaintiff is therefore entitled to an order
compelling responses to these discovery requests.
 
Sanctions
 
            Plaintiff
also requests sanctions in the amount of $402.50. Plaintiff’s notice of motion
does not state against whom the sanctions are sought, as required by the
Discovery Act. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2023.040.) Even if the Court were inclined to
award sanctions on a procedurally deficient motion such as this—and it is
not—imposition of improperly noticed sanctions would thus constitute a
violation of Defendant’s due process rights. Plaintiff’s request for sanctions
is denied. 
 
Conclusion
 
            Accordingly,
Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Responses to Form Interrogatories – General is
GRANTED.
 
            Plaintiff’s
Motion to Compel Responses to Special Interrogatories (Set One) is GRANTED.
 
            Plaintiff’s
Motion to Compel Responses to Requests for Production (Set One) is GRANTED. 
 
Motion to Deem the Truth of Matters in Requests for
Admissions (x2) 
 
            Plaintiff
moves (1) to deem the truth of matters in requests for admissions (set one),
and (2) to deem the genuineness of documents identified in requests for
admissions. 
 
Legal
Standard
 
When a party to
whom requests for admission are directed fails to respond, the party
propounding the requests may move for an order that the truth of any matters
specified in the requests be deemed admitted. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.280(b).)
“The court shall make this order [deem the requests admitted], unless it finds
that the party to whom the request for admissions have been directed has
served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests
for admission that is in substantial compliance with section 2033.220.” (Code
Civ. Proc. § 2033.280(c).)

served Requests for Admissions (Set One) and Requests for Admissions of
Genuineness of Documents on Defendant via mail on January 11, 2023.
(Declaration of Troy Q. Strange ISO Mot. ¶ 3, Exh. 1.) Although responses were

24, 2023, and then to March 6, 2023. (Strange Decl. ¶¶ 4-8.) To date, no
responses have been provided. (Id. ¶ 9.) Plaintiff is therefore entitled
to an order deeming these requests as admitted.

            Any party may submit on the
tentative ruling by contacting the courtroom via email at Smcdept47@lacourt.org by no later than 4:00 p.m. the day
before the hearing. All interested parties must be copied on the email. It
should be noted that if you submit on a tentative ruling the court will still
conduct a hearing if any party appears. By submitting on the tentative you
have, in essence, waived your right to be present at the hearing, and you
should be aware that the court may not adopt the tentative, and may issue an
order which modifies the tentative ruling in whole or in part.
