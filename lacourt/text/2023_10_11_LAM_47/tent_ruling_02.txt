CASE:                         Lenny K. Dykstra v. Galanter Associates,
et al.
 
CASE NO.:                 23STCV03186            
 
MOTION
TO QUASH SERVICE OF SUMMONS BY PUBLICATION

 
MOVING PARTY:               Specially Appearing Defendant Douglas F. Galanter,
individually and d/b/a Galanter Associates
 
RESPONDING PARTY(S): Plaintiff Lenny K.
Dykstra.
 
STATEMENT
OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
            This is a legal malpractice action that was filed on February 14, 2023.
Plaintiff alleges Defendant failed to provide adequate and competent legal
services, failed to communicate with Plaintiff during the course of
representation, and misappropriated funds which were to be held in an Interest on
Lawyer’s Trust Account for the benefit of Plaintiff. 
 
Specially Appearing Defendant moves
to quash service of the summons and complaint by publication. 
            
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Specially Appearing Defendant
Douglas Galanter, individually and doing business as Galanter Associates, moves
to quash service of the summons and complaint by publication. 
 
A motion to quash must be made as Defendant’s initial
appearance in the action, and must be served and filed on or before the
last day to plead “or within any further time that the court may for good cause
allow.” (Code Civ. Proc.  § 418.10(a).)
Filing the motion also extends the time within Defendant may answer or demur.
(Code Civ. Proc.  § 418.10(b).) 
 
            Here, the
Proof of Service by Publication filed with the Court on August 4, 2023 states
that service by publication was commenced on July 13, 2023, with successive
notices published on July 20, July 27, and August 3, 2023. (August 4, 2023
Proof of Service by Publication.) A party has 30 days to answer
or demur to a complaint after service is received. (Code Civ. Proc. § 471.5.)
Service by publication is deemed complete on the 29th day after publication
commences. (Code Civ. Proc. § 415.50(c); Gov. Code § 6064.) 59 days after July
13, 2023 would be Sunday, September 10, 2023. Thus, the final date to file this
motion was Monday, September 11, 2023. (Code Civ. Proc. § 12.)  Although Defendant’s motion was filed on
September 8, 2023, the initial filing of this motion stated that it was served
by email on Plaintiff, a self-represented litigant. (See Proof of Service in
Motion to Quash filed September 8, 2023.) Under Code of Civil Procedure
section 1010.6 subdivision (c), an unrepresented person in a civil action must
give express consent to receive electronic service before such service is
valid. (See Code Civ. Proc. § 1010.6(c)(1)-(2).) Express consent may be given
by either:
 
(i) Serving a notice on all parties and
filing the notice with the court [or;]
 
(ii) Manifesting affirmative consent
through electronic means with the court or the court's electronic filing
service provider, and concurrently providing the party's electronic address
with that consent for the purpose of receiving electronic service. The act of
electronic filing shall not be construed as express consent.
 
(Code Civ. Proc. § 1010.6(c)(3).) No manifestation of
affirmative consent by Plaintiff as provided by statute is present in the
Court’s record. Although Defendant subsequently filed a proof of service
stating that the motion was served by U.S. mail on September 13, 2023, that
subsequent service was made after the time to plead had expired. (See Proof of
Service filed September 29, 2023.) Defendant offers no explanation for the
failure to timely serve this motion, nor any other basis for the Court to find
good cause to extend the time for filing and service of this motion. Defendant’s
Motion to Quash is untimely. 
 
            Accordingly,
Defendant Douglas Galanter’s Motion to Quash Service of the
Summons and Complaint by Publication is DENIED. 
 
            Defendant is deemed to have made a
general appearance in this action. 
 
            Defendant is ordered to file and
serve an answer, demurrer, or other responsive pleading within 20 days of this
order. 
 
            Moving
Party to give notice.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.

            Any party may submit on the
tentative ruling by contacting the courtroom via email at Smcdept47@lacourt.org by no later than 4:00 p.m. the day
before the hearing. All interested parties must be copied on the email. It
should be noted that if you submit on a tentative ruling the court will still
conduct a hearing if any party appears. By submitting on the tentative you
have, in essence, waived your right to be present at the hearing, and you
should be aware that the court may not adopt the tentative, and may issue an
order which modifies the tentative ruling in whole or in part.
