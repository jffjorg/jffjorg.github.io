In the Matter of:  MIESHA
 LASHAUNDA COLEMAN
Friday,

[TENTATIVE]
ORDER DENYING
 PETITION FOR CHANGE OF NAME
 
 
On May 9, 2024, the court heard
this matter without Petitioner’s appearance and continued the hearing as
Petitioner did not comply with the requirements for publication of the order to
show cause (“OSC”). (Code Civ. Proc., § 1277.) While the court mailed notice of
the continuance to the Petitioner, the notice was returned to the court as
undeliverable. The court’s file does not reflect that Petitioner filed a notice
of change of address, and the OSC remains unpublished. Accordingly, the
Petition is DENIED.
