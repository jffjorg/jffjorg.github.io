The tentative ruling denies the Petition for Change of Name filed by Miesha Lashaunda Coleman, as the court did not receive the required publication of the order to show cause. The court held a hearing on May 9, 2024, but the Petitioner did not appear. A notice of continuance was returned to the court as undeliverable, and the court's file does not reflect that the Petitioner filed a notice of change of address. As a result, the Petition is denied, in accordance with California Code of Civil Procedure section 1277.
