The Judge's tentative ruling grants the motion filed by California Automobile Insurance Company (Defendant) to permit a mental examination of Plaintiff Guillermina Trevis. The Court finds that Guillermina's mental condition remains "in controversy" due to her ongoing claims of mental suffering and anxiety, and therefore a mental examination is necessary to determine the extent of her claimed injuries. The examination is ordered to take place on October 10, 2023, at 9:00 a.m., at Behavioral Diagnostics Medical Group, Inc. or via Zoom.
