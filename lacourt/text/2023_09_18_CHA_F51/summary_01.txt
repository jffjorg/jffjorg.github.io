## English Summary

This tentative ruling concerns a motion filed by Defendant California Automobile Insurance Company (CAIC) to allow a mental examination of Plaintiff Guillermina Trevis. 

The case stems from a lawsuit filed by Plaintiffs Massimiliano and Guillermina Trevis against various insurance companies, including CAIC, to recover insurance funds related to damage to their home from the 2019 Saddlebridge Fire. 

CAIC argues that Guillermina's mental condition is "in controversy" because she alleges mental suffering, including anxiety, depression, and insomnia, caused by CAIC's handling of her claim. They contend a mental examination is necessary to determine the extent of her alleged injuries. 

The Plaintiffs initially claimed ongoing mental distress, but in recent supplemental discovery responses, Guillermina states that her emotional distress related to CAIC's conduct ceased after her deposition in May 2023. 

The Judge acknowledges Guillermina's claims of "current intense anxiety," finding this statement creates ambiguity regarding the cause of her mental condition. Therefore, the Judge concludes that Guillermina's mental condition remains "in controversy" and grants CAIC's motion for a mental examination. 


The examination is scheduled for October 10, 2023, with Dr. James R. High, a psychiatrist, at Behavioral Diagnostics Medical Group, Inc. or via Zoom.

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the defendant's motion for a mental examination of plaintiff Guillermina Trevis. The court found that Guillermina's mental condition remains "in controversy" due to her assertion that she is experiencing "current intense anxiety." The court ordered Guillermina to submit to a psychiatric examination with Dr. James R. High on October 10, 2023. The examination will take place at Behavioral Diagnostics Medical Group, Inc. in Los Angeles or via Zoom at a court reporter's office location. The court's decision was based on the fact that Guillermina had alleged mental injuries and need for future treatment for mental injuries as a result of the defendant's alleged conduct. Despite Guillermina's subsequent statement that she was no longer claiming ongoing emotional distress, the court found that her mental condition remained "in controversy" due to the ambiguity surrounding the causation of her mental condition.

- "Plaintiff Guillermina Trevis claims her symptoms worsen due to ‘financial and/or housing stresses.’"
- "Plaintiff is no longer claiming ongoing emotional distress as a result of Defendant's bad faith. The exacerbation of her diagnosed anxiety disorder and other related symptoms caused by Defendant's bad faith ceased at or about the time of Plaintiff's deposition (May 31, 2023 – Volume I), after which she realized it was the litigation, as opposed to the bad faith claims handling, that was causing her current intense anxiety."

Summary:
The Judge has granted the motion for leave of court to permit a mental examination of Plaintiff Guillermina Trevis with psychiatrist James R. High, M.D. The examination will take place on October 10, 2023, at 9:00 a.m., at Behavioral Diagnostics Medical Group, Inc. or via Zoom at a Court Reporters office location to be determined. This is in regard to an action brought by Plaintiffs against various insurance Defendants to recover insurance funds related to the damage to Plaintiffs’ home resulting from the Saddlebridge Fire in October 2019. Plaintiffs allege that Defendants denied coverage, paid for only some or part of the claims, and delayed payment of claims unreasonably and without proper cause. Plaintiffs served a verified supplemental response to form interrogatories, stating that she is no longer claiming ongoing emotional distress as a result of Defendant's bad faith and no longer requires future treatment for any alleged injuries sustained from the subject incident. However, the Judge finds that based on Guillermina’s assertion that she is experiencing “current intense anxiety,” there remains an ambiguity as to the causation of her mental condition, and therefore her mental condition remains “in controversy.”
