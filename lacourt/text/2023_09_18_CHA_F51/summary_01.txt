## English Summary

This tentative ruling concerns a motion filed by Defendant California Automobile Insurance Company (CAIC) to allow a mental examination of Plaintiff Guillermina Trevis. 

The case stems from a lawsuit filed by Plaintiffs Massimiliano and Guillermina Trevis against various insurance companies, including CAIC, to recover insurance funds related to damage to their home from the 2019 Saddlebridge Fire. 

CAIC argues that Guillermina's mental condition is "in controversy" because she alleges mental suffering, including anxiety, depression, and insomnia, caused by CAIC's handling of her claim. They contend a mental examination is necessary to determine the extent of her alleged injuries. 

The Plaintiffs initially claimed ongoing mental distress, but in recent supplemental discovery responses, Guillermina states that her emotional distress related to CAIC's conduct ceased after her deposition in May 2023. 

The Judge acknowledges Guillermina's claims of "current intense anxiety," finding this statement creates ambiguity regarding the cause of her mental condition. Therefore, the Judge concludes that Guillermina's mental condition remains "in controversy" and grants CAIC's motion for a mental examination. 


The examination is scheduled for October 10, 2023, with Dr. James R. High, a psychiatrist, at Behavioral Diagnostics Medical Group, Inc. or via Zoom.

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the defendant's motion for a mental examination of plaintiff Guillermina Trevis. The court found that Guillermina's mental condition remains "in controversy" due to her assertion that she is experiencing "current intense anxiety." The court ordered Guillermina to submit to a psychiatric examination with Dr. James R. High on October 10, 2023. The examination will take place at Behavioral Diagnostics Medical Group, Inc. in Los Angeles or via Zoom at a court reporter's office location. The court's decision was based on the fact that Guillermina had alleged mental injuries and need for future treatment for mental injuries as a result of the defendant's alleged conduct. Despite Guillermina's subsequent statement that she was no longer claiming ongoing emotional distress, the court found that her mental condition remained "in controversy" due to the ambiguity surrounding the causation of her mental condition.

English-Text Summary of Tentative Ruling:

The Judge has tentatively *granted* the motion by Defendant California Automobile Insurance Company to compel a mental examination of Plaintiff Guillermina Trevis.  The Judge found that even though Mrs. Trevis amended her claims to state her emotional distress *from the insurance company's actions* had ended, her admission of *current* intense anxiety (attributed to the litigation itself) still leaves the *cause* of her mental condition in question.  Therefore, her mental condition remains "in controversy," justifying a mental examination under California law. The examination is scheduled for October 10, 2023, with Dr. James R. High, either in person at his office or via Zoom at a court reporter's office. This is a *tentative* ruling, meaning it is the Judge's preliminary decision before the hearing, and could be changed after arguments at the hearing.

##  English Summary

The judge has granted a motion by California Automobile Insurance Company (CAIC) to conduct a mental examination of Guillermina Trevis, one of the plaintiffs in this lawsuit.  

The plaintiffs are suing CAIC and other insurance companies for allegedly mishandling their insurance claims after a fire damaged their home in 2019. Guillermina Trevis initially claimed in discovery responses that CAIC's conduct caused her significant mental anguish. However, she later stated in supplemental responses that her anxiety is now caused by the litigation itself, not CAIC's actions. 

CAIC argued that this ambiguity about the cause of her anxiety meant her mental condition was still "in controversy" and required a mental examination. The judge agreed, finding that Guillermina's current anxiety, even if not directly caused by CAIC, still needs to be investigated to understand the full extent of her alleged injuries.
