Judge's Tentative Ruling:

The plaintiff, Jordan Cid, sustained injuries and damages in a November 2021 motor vehicle collision. The plaintiff filed a complaint on May 18, 2023, asserting causes of action against Joanna Lee and others. On January 31, 2024, the court dismissed the case without prejudice after the plaintiff's counsel, Jocelyn H. Sicat, failed to appear at the hearing. The plaintiff now moves the court to reconsider the dismissal order based on an attorney affidavit of fault.

The court finds that the plaintiff is entitled to relief under Code of Civil Procedure § 1008(a). The court will construe the instant motion as one to set aside the court's January 31, 2024 dismissal order based upon an attorney affidavit of fault. The court grants the motion and orders the case restored to the civil active list.
