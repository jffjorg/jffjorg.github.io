Legal Standard
“[T]he
demanding party may move for an order compelling further response to the demand
if the demanding party deems that. . . (1) A statement of compliance with the
demand is incomplete[,] (2) A representation of inability to comply is
inadequate, incomplete, or evasive [and/or] (3) An objection in the response is
without merit or too general.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (a).)
The moving party must demonstrate a
“reasonable and good faith attempt” at an informal resolution of each issue
presented. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2016.040, 2031.310, subd. (b)(2).) “In lieu of
a separate statement required under the California Rules of Court, the court
may allow the moving party to submit a concise outline of the discovery request
and each response in dispute.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (b)(3).)
A motion to compel further responses to a demand for
inspection or production of documents must “set forth specific facts showing
good cause justifying the discovery sought by the demand.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.310, subd. (b)(1).) If the moving party has shown good cause for the
production of documents, the burden is on the objecting party to justify the
objections. (Kirkland v. Superior Court
(2002) 95 Cal.App.4th 92, 98.) 
Notice
of the motion must be provided “within 45 days of the service of the verified
response, or any supplemental verified response, or on or before any specific
later date to which the demanding party and the responding party have agreed in
writing . . .” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.310, subd. (c).)
“[T]he court shall impose a monetary sanction. . . against
any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to
compel further response to a demand, unless it finds that the one subject to
the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances
make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310,
subd. (h).)
Discussion
Plaintiffs move the
court, per Code of Civil Procedure § 2031.310, for an order striking
Defendant’s objections and compelling Defendant’s further responses to
Plaintiffs’ Requests for Production of Documents, Set One (i.e., No.30).
Plaintiffs’ counsel
Chris Grigoryan (“Grigoryan”) represents as follows:
On
November 1, 2023, Plaintiffs propounded the subject discovery on Defendant.
(Grigoryan Decl., ¶ 17, Exh. 3.) On December 5, 2023, Defendant provided
responses. (Id., ¶ 18, Exh. 4.) On December 13, 2023, Grigoryan sent
Defendant’s counsel Soheyl Tahsildoost (“Tahsildoost”) a meet and confer
letter, requesting therein that Tahsildoost provide a response thereto by
December 20, 2023. (Id., ¶ 20, Exh. 5.) On December 20, 2023,
Defendant’s counsel Kevin Zipser (“Zipser”) sent a response letter. (Id.,
¶ 21, Exh. 6). On January 16, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel sent another meet and
confer letter. (Id., ¶¶ 22 and 25, Exh. 7). 
Counsel attended an Informal Discovery Conference on
February 7, 2024; the minute order from that date reflects that Defendant’s
counsel was to prepare and circulate a stipulation for protective order and
that Plaintiffs’ counsel could proceed with filing the instant motion if the
parties were unable to resolve their dispute regarding Request No. 30 via meet
and confer.
The subject request, No. 30, seeks all documents, in the
form of a list or compilation, of other customer complaints in Defendant’s
electronically stored information of database(s) that are substantially similar[1] to
complaints made by Plaintiffs with respect to the subject vehicle in other 2020
Honda Odyssey vehicles.
Defendant objected to Request No. 30 on the basis that it
was vague, ambiguous, overly broad, unduly burdensome, harassing, sought
irrelevant information, failed to describe with reasonable particularity the
documents or categories of documents being requested, failed to define the term
“complaints made by Plaintiffs” such that the request was vague, ambiguous and
called for speculation, asked for information protected by the right to
privacy, called for confidential, commercially sensitive, and proprietary or
trade secret information and asked Defendant to respond on behalf of any other
entity.
Defendant addressed its vague and ambiguous objections in
opposition. The court agrees that Plaintiffs’ failure to define “complaints
made by Plaintiffs” renders the request vague and ambiguous. No further
response is warranted. The motion is denied.
