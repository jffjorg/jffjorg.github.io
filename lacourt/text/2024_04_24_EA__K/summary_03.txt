Plaintiffs Rosalino O. Gaspar and Luis Alberto Gaspar Ortiz, who purchased a 2020 Honda Odyssey, seek to compel Defendant American Honda Motor Co., Inc. to produce documents related to customer complaints about similar vehicles. Defendant objected to the request on grounds of vagueness, ambiguity, and overbreadth. After an informal discovery conference, the court denied the motion to compel further responses, finding that Plaintiffs' failure to define "complaints made by Plaintiffs" rendered the request vague and ambiguous.
