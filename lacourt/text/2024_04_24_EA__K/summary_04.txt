And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses the dispute between John Doe (plaintiff) and Jane Smith (defendant) regarding the definition of "substantially similar" customer complaints. The judge notes that the term was defined in a previous case as "similar customer complaints that would be the same nature of the reported system, malfunction, trouble code, Technical Service Bulletin Recommendation, dashboard indicator light, or other manifestation of a repair problem, as described in any warranty summary or repair order for the subject vehicle." The judge also notes that the plaintiff is willing to meet and confer with the defendant to list out specific customer complaints and the language used to describe them. The judge is seeking to determine if the customer complaints are "substantially similar" and will review the warranty history/summary and repair orders to make a determination.
