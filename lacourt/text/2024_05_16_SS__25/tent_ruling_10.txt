BACKGROUND 
On
April 24, 2017, Judgment Creditor Tres Pueblos Homeowners Association
(“Judgment Creditor”) filed an Application for Entry of Judgment on
Sister-State Judgment against Judgment Debtors Claudia Quihuis and Aurelio
Vecchiola (collectively, “Judgment Debtors”). A judgment of $6,585.23 was
entered in favor of Judgment Creditor on April 24, 2017. Following a motion for
attorney’s fees and additional costs, the Court amended the judgment to
$11,566.23 on October 3, 2018. 
On
August 17, 2020, Judgment Creditor filed a Motion for Attorney’s Fees and Costs
to recover costs to enforce judgment incurred between June 11, 2018, and the
filing of its motion. On March 25, 2021, the Court granted Judgment Creditor’s motion
for $2,698.00.  
On
June 30, 2022, Judgment Creditor filed a second Motion for Attorney’s Fees and
Costs to recover costs to enforce judgment incurred between July 1, 2020, and
June 29, 2022, in the amount of $2,589.26. On September 29, 2022, the Court
granted Judgment Creditor’s motion for $2,589.26. 
On
December 19, 2023, Judgment Creditor filed the instant (third) Motion for
Attorney’s Fees and Costs (the “Motion”) to recover costs to enforce judgment
incurred from June 29, 2022, to the present, in the amount of $2,536.49. 
The
Motion has been continued multiply times to allow Judgment Creditor to file
proper proof of service. On April 29, 2024, Judgment Creditor filed proofs of
service of the motion and latest continuance. 
No
opposition has been filed as of May 14, 2024.  
ANALYSIS 
 
I.                  
Request for Judicial Notice
 
Judgment Creditor
requests that the Court take judicial notice of (1) the relevant portions of
the Declarations of Covenants, Conditions, and Restrictions and Easements for
Tres Pueblos recorded in Pima County, Arizona on July 8, 2005, Instrument No.
20051310872; (2) the judgment entered in the Pima Consolidated Justice Court,
County of Pima, State of Arizona, entitled Tres Pueblos Homeowners
Association v. Claudia Quihuis and Aurelio Vecchiola entered on September
9, 2016; and (3) Notice of Entry of Judgment on Sister-State Judgment entered
in the instant action. (Mot., RJN Exh. 3.) Judgment Creditor’s request is
GRANTED. (Evid. Code., § 452(c), (d).) 
 
II.               
Attorney’s
Fees and Cost Incurred
Post-Judgment 
 
A.   
Legal Standard 
 
The Court’s
objective is to award attorney’s fees at the fair market value based on the
particular action. (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1132.) “The
reasonable hourly rate is that prevailing in the community for similar work.” (PLCM
Group v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095.) “‘[T]he fee setting inquiry
in California ordinarily begins with the 'lodestar,' i.e., the number of hours
reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate . . . .’” (Ketchum
v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1134.) The lodestar method is based on
several factors, as relevant to each particular case: “(1) the novelty and
difficulty of the questions involved, (2) the skill displayed in presenting
them, (3) the extent to which the nature of the litigation precluded other
employment by the attorneys, (4) the contingent nature of the fee award.” (Id.
at 1132.) “The ‘‘experienced trial judge is the best judge of the value of
professional services rendered in his court, and while his judgment is of
course subject to review, it will not be disturbed unless the appellate court
is convinced that it is clearly wrong.’’” (Id.) A negative modifier is
appropriate when duplicative work is performed. (Thayer v. Wells Fargo Bank,
N.A. (2001) 92 Cal.App.4th 819.)
 
Code of Civil
Procedure, § 685.070(a) states in pertinent part: “The judgment creditor may
claim under this section the following costs of enforcing a judgment: . . . (6)
Attorney's fees, if allowed by Section 685.040.” Code of Civil Procedure §
685.040 provides that a “judgment creditor is entitled to the reasonable and
necessary costs of enforcing a judgment.” Attorney’s fees incurred in enforcing
a judgment are expressly excluded unless otherwise provided by law. (Id.)
Attorney’s fees that are incurred in enforcing a judgment are collectible as
costs “if the underlying judgment includes an award of attorney’s fees to the
judgment creditor pursuant to subparagraph (A) of paragraph (10) of subdivision
(a) of section 1033.5” which allows for attorney’s fees when authorized by
contract. (Id; Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5(a)(10)(A).)
 
Code of Civil
Procedure § 685.080(a) allows a Judgment Creditor to claim costs by noticed
motion “before the judgment is satisfied in full, but not later than two years
after the costs have been incurred.” In addition, § 685.080(b) requires that:
 
“[t]he notice of motion shall
describe the costs claimed, shall state their amount, and shall be supported by
an affidavit of a person who has knowledge of the facts stating that to the
person's best knowledge and belief the costs are correct, are reasonable and
necessary, and have not been satisfied. The notice of motion shall be served on
the judgment debtor. Service shall be made personally or by mail.”
 
B.    
Discussion 
 
Here, because the
Judgment from the underlying case awarded attorney’s fees and provided for “all
costs and attorney fees incurred by [Judgment Creditor] after submission of
this judgment for entry by the Court in collecting the amounts listed in this
Judgment,” Judgment Creditor is entitled to attorney’s fees and costs in
enforcing the Judgment pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 685.040. (RJN, Ex.
2.)
 
Judgment Creditor
seeks to recover fees expended between June 29, 2022 and December 16, 2023, in
the amount of $2,536.49 and submits the declaration of Counsel Baillio, in
support of its request. Baillio states that as of the date of the instant
Motion, “Judgment has not been satisfied” and Creditor seeks to recover fees
and costs within the two-year limit as permitted by statute. (Baillio Decl. ¶
4.) 
 
Creditor seeks
$2,000.00 in attorney’s fees for having had to “search for assets owned by
Debtors to use to satisfy judgment,” “draft and record an abstract of
judgment,” and to “draft this Motion.” (Mot. p. 4; Baillio Decl. ¶ 5; Ex. A.)
During the period between June 29, 2022 and December 16, 2023, Baillio spent a
total of 2.3 hours in collection efforts billed at a rate of $325.00 per hour
before January 1, 2023, and $375.00 per hour thereafter. (Baillio Decl., ¶¶ 6,
8.) Attorney Sellers spent .2 hours on this matter billed at $325.00 per hour.
(Id. at ¶¶ 6-7.) An additional 1.5 hours of attorney time, billed at $375
per hour, was spent drafting the instant Motion, declaration, request for
judicial notice, and other pertinent documents; and filing fee of $61.65 was incurred.
(Id. at ¶ 15.) Counsel anticipates spending 0.4 hours, billed at $375
per hour, to attend the hearing on the Motion. (Id.) Fees also include
2.7 hours of paralegal time billed at $150.00 and $175.00 per hour. (Id.
at ¶¶ 11-14.) 
 
Creditor also
seeks $536.49 in costs, including “electronic monitoring fees, filing fees,
reservation fees, and background research fees.” (Mot. p. 5; Baillio Decl. ¶ 19.)

 
In reviewing the
billing record, the Court finds the rates charged, hours expended, and costs
sought were reasonably expended in collection efforts in Judgment Creditor’s
interest. 
 
Accordingly,
Judgment Creditor’s request for attorney’s fees and costs is GRANTED in the
amount of $2,000.00 in attorney’s fees and $536.49 in costs, for a total of
$2,536.49.
 
CONCLUSION
 
For the foregoing
reasons, Judgment Creditor Tres Pueblos Homeowners Association’s Motion for
Attorney’s Fees and Costs is GRANTED in the amount of $2,000.00 in attorney’s
fees and $536.49 in costs, for a total of $2,536.49. 
 
Moving party is ordered to give
notice.
