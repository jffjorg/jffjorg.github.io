 
BACKGROUND
            
On December 8, 2023, Darrell Earl
Williams (Plaintiff) filed a Complaint against Wells Lawson (Defendant). The
Complaint consisted of one sentence alleging racism and favoritism (Complaint,
pg. 1, lines 15-18), but nothing more. On January 25, 2024, Defendant filed a
demurrer, and after the February 28, 2024 hearing on the demurrer, the Court
sustained the demurrer, giving Plaintiff 20 days leave to amend. No amended
complaint was ever filed with the Court. Now, the motion before the Court is
Defendant’ Motion to Dismiss pursuant to Code Civ. Proc. §581 subd. (f)(2).
 
DISCUSSION
 
Legal Standard
            Code of Civil Procedure section 581,
subdivision (f)(2), states that the Court may dismiss an action against a
defendant when, “after a demurrer to the complaint is sustained with leave to
amend, the plaintiff fails to amend it within the time allowed by the court and
either party moves for dismissal.”
 
Analysis
            On
February 28, 2024, this Court sustained Defendant’s demurrer in its entirety,
and granted Plaintiff 20 days leave to amend. (See February 28, 2024 Minute
Order.) Defendant has attached proof of service in their moving papers
demonstrating that Plaintiff was mailed and served notice on February 29, 2024
to his address. This yielded a deadline of March 20, 2024. As the Court’s
docket reflects no amended complaint prior to or on that date, Plaintiff failed
to amend the complaint within the time allowed by the Court. Defendant has
moved for dismissal, and pursuant to Code Civ. Proc. §581 subd. (f)(2) this
Court may exercise its discretion in granting or denying such motion. Accordingly,
the Court shall grant the motion to dismiss. 

 
 
Conclusion
 
            Wells
Lawson’s Motion to Dismiss pursuant to Code Civ. Proc. §581 subd. (f)(2) is GRANTED.
 Plaintiff’s Complaint filed on December
8, 2023, is hereby dismissed.
 
            Moving
party is ordered to give notice.
