And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant/cross-complainant's motion to continue the trial in part. The court will address a new trial date at the hearing. The motion was granted due to the circumstances of lead counsel's parental leave during the original trial date. However, the court is concerned about the long delay in bringing the case to resolution, as it has been continued repeatedly over several years. The parties must advise the court about the status of the case and efforts to settle, and the court will not tolerate further delay.
