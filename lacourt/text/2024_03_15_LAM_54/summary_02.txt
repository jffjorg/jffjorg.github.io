And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The City of Los Angeles's motion for summary judgment is granted. The Plaintiff, Peter Famulari, brought a lawsuit alleging damages resulting from restricted access to his property via Crater Lane, where the City installed a large "END" sign. The Court previously found that the City does not own, maintain, or control the disputed portion of Crater Lane, and this finding is dispositive of the remaining causes of action. The Plaintiff's arguments that the Court's findings are not final and may be revisited are incorrect. The Court's previous decision on the declaratory relief claim is binding, and the Plaintiff's claims for damages and declaratory relief are barred. The City's motion for summary judgment is granted, and the case is dismissed.
