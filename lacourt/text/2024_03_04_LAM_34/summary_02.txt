English-text summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge has denied the Motion to Consolidate cases 23STCV03883, 23STCV05161, 23STCV06678, and 23STCV06773. The Judge finds that two of the cases have recently been unrelated and transferred to different departments, making consolidation of all four cases inappropriate. The Judge notes that the Moving Party, Frederic Vuong, has not shown sufficient grounds to justify consolidation of all the cases. The Judge also notes that the parties may move for consolidation of the remaining two cases that are still in Department 34 if they believe it is appropriate.
