And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the Motion to Consolidate filed by Frederic Vuong, which sought to consolidate cases 23STCV03883, 23STCV05161, 23STCV06678, and 23STCV06773. The Judge found that two of the cases have recently been unrelated and transferred to different departments, making consolidation of all four cases inappropriate. The Judge noted that Vuong's motion did not meet the legal standards for consolidation and that the cases should be treated separately. The Judge also suggested that if any party believes that consolidation of the remaining two cases in Department 34 is appropriate, they may move for such consolidation.
