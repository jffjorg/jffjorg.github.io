Moving Party: Frederic
Vuong 
Resp. Party:    None
 
 
 
The Motion to Consolidate is DENIED.  
 
BACKGROUND:
 
        On March 8, 2023, County of Los Angeles
(“County”) filed Judicial Council Form PLD-PI-001, Complaint—Personal Injury,
Property Damage, Wrongful Death against Ronilo Felicitas Quidolit (“Quidolit”).
 
        On March 23, 2023, County filed its
First Amended Complaint (FAC). 
 
        On June 5, 2023, Quidolit filed: (1)
Answer to the FAC; and (2) Judicial Council Form PLD-PI-002,
Cross-Complaint—Personal Injury, Property Damage, Wrongful Death against
Frederic Vuong (“Vuong”), Temple City Auto Repair, Becker Tire, and Norman
Anpree (“Anpree”). 
 
        On June 27, 2023, Vuong filed Judicial
Council Form PLD-PI-003, Answer—Personal Injury, Property Damage, Wrongful
Death.
 
        On July 12, 2023, the Court found
related cases 23STCV03883, 23STCV05161, 23STCV06678, and 23STCV06773. The Court
designated 23STCV03883 as the lead case.
 
        On December 15, 2023, Vuong filed Motion
to Consolidate for All Purposes Cases Nos.: 23STCV03883; 23ZSTCV05161;
23STCV06773; and 23STCV06678 (“Motion to Consolidate”). 
 
        On January 29, 2024, all four cases were
transferred to Department 34. 
 
        On February 9 and 14, 2024, peremptory
challenges were filed and accepted on cases 23STCV03883 and 23STCV06678,
respectively. 
 
        On February 21 and 23, 2024, cases
23STCV03883 and 23STCV06678, respectively, were unrelated from cases
23STCV05161 and 23STCV06773. 
 

ANALYSIS:
 
I.         
Legal Standard
 
“When actions involving a
common question of law or fact are pending before the court, it may order a
joint hearing or trial of any or all the matters in issue in the actions; it
may order all the actions consolidated and it may make such orders concerning
proceedings therein as may tend to avoid unnecessary costs or delay.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 1048, subd. (a).)
 
“A notice of
motion to consolidate must:
 
“(A) List all named parties in each
case, the names of those who have appeared, and the names of their respective
attorneys of record;
 
“(B) Contain the captions of all
the cases sought to be consolidated, with the lowest numbered case shown first;
and
 
“(C) Be filed in each case sought
to be consolidated.” 
 
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.350(a)(1)(A)–(C).)
 
“The motion to
consolidate:
 
“(A) Is deemed a single motion for
the purpose of determining the appropriate filing fee, but memorandums,
declarations, and other supporting papers must be filed only in the lowest
numbered case;
 
“(B) Must be served on all attorneys
of record and all nonrepresented parties in all of the cases sought to be
consolidated; and
 
“(C) Must have a proof of service
filed as part of the motion.” 
 
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.350(a)(2)(A)–(C).)
 
“An order granting or denying all or part of a motion to consolidate
must be filed in each case sought to be consolidated. . . .” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.350(c).)
 
II.      
Discussion
 
Vuong moves the Court to consolidate cases 23STCV03883, 23STCV05161, 23STCV06678, and
23STCV06773. (Motion to Consolidate, p. 3:13–19.)
 
        Considering that two of these cases have
recently been unrelated and been sent to two different departments,
consolidation of all four cases is inappropriate. Thus, the Motion to
Consolidate must be denied. 
 
        If any of the parties believes that
consolidation of the two cases that remain in Department 34 is appropriate,
they may move for such consolidation. 
 
III.     Conclusion 
 
The Motion to Consolidate is DENIED.
