The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the Motion to Quash Service of the Summons and Complaint filed by Defendant Justin J. Shrenger and Law Offices of Justin J. Shrenger, APC. The Motion was filed on December 7, 2023, and challenges the service made by Plaintiff Jimmy Lee on November 7, 2023. The Plaintiff did not file proof of service, and the Defendant's declarations show that the service was not properly made. The Judge concludes that the service does not satisfy the requirements for personal or substitute service under California Code of Civil Procedure sections 415.10 and 415.20, and therefore grants the Motion to Quash Service.
