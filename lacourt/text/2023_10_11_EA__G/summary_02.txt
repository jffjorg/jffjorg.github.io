**Ruling**
```
  Demurrer to Plaintiff's Complaint: SUSTAINED with 10 days' leave to amend as to the sixth cause of action and OVERRULED as to the fifth cause of action
```

**Summary of Ruling**
The court sustains the demurrer to the sixth cause of action (negligent repair) with leave to amend, finding that the action is barred by the economic loss rule. The court overrules the demurrer to the fifth cause of action (fraudulent inducement by concealment), finding that the allegations are sufficient and that the economic loss rule does not apply.

**Intentions**
The court's intention is to give the plaintiff an opportunity to amend the complaint to address the issues raised by the demurrer, while also dismissing the sixth cause of action as barred by the economic loss rule.

**Significant Statements**
* The court accepts all well-pleaded facts as true when considering a demurrer.
* The economic loss rule bars tort recovery for "purely economic losses."
* A party's failure to disclose material facts unknown to another party is not fraud unless there is some relationship between the parties that gives rise to a duty to disclose.
* The court overrules the demurrer to the fifth cause of action for fraudulent inducement by concealment, finding that the allegations are sufficient.
