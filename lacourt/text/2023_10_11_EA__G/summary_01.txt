And here is a summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the Vermont Avenue Lofts Homeowners' Association's motion to select an arbitrator. The dispute arose from allegations that defendant Joseph Ruiz violated the association's declaration of covenants, conditions, and restrictions. The parties agreed to arbitrate through an oral stipulation, but the previous arbitrator withdrew and Ruiz refused to participate in the selection of a new arbitrator. The court finds that Ruiz has waived any challenge to the proposed list of arbitrators and therefore grants the association's motion. The court appoints Honorable Lisa Hart Cole (Ret.) of Signature Resolution as the arbitrator in this action.
