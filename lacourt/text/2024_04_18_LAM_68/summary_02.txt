And here is a summary of the tentatice ruling in English:

The court grants the motion to compel further responses to the request for production of documents. The court finds that the requests are overbroad and lack sufficient articulation and indication limiting the inquiry into the indicated area of failure and attempted repair(s) to said parts or systems. The court declines to allow open-ended and broad-based discovery. The court orders General Motors to provide further, more factually articulated, code-conforming responses, which may also include a privilege log. The court imposes sanctions of $1,000 joint and severally imposed against both General Motors and counsel for General Motors.
