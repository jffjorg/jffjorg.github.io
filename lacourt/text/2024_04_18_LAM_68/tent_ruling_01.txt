SUMMARY OF ACTION
Plaintiff Albert Agdaian owned certain real property at 7373
Perigord Court, Tujunga. The common areas were managed by homeowner association
Defendant Renaissance Maintenance Corp. In March 2022, sold the residence. Upon
the close of escrow, $67,153 was paid to Defendant homeowner association for
purported landscape repairs. Plaintiff contends no repairs were actually
completed, and challenges the reasonableness of the amount. 
 
On July 12, 2022, Plaintiff filed a complaint for
Intentional Interference with Contract, Conversion, and Declaratory Relief.
Defendant answered on November 4, 2022. 
 
RULING: Granted.
Request for Judicial Notice: Granted.
The court takes judicial notice of the existence of the
documents, but cannot take judicial notice of the content of the material, with
the exception of the admissions (see below).
 
Defendant Renaissance Maintenance Corp. erroneously sued
as Renaissance Estates (Renaissance) moves for summary judgment, or
alternatively summary adjudication against Plaintiff Albert Agdaian on the
first, second, and third causes of action for Intentional Interference with
Contract, Conversion, and Declaratory Relief. Renaissance moves for relief on
grounds that the $67,153 disbursement to Renaissance upon the sale of Agdaian
home constituted a proper reimbursement for landscape work performed by
Renaissance as the governing homeowner association. Agdain approved of said
payment. The court electronic filing system shows no opposition from Plaintiff
Agdaian, and Renaissance filed a notice of non-opposition. 
 
The pleadings
frame the issues for motions, “since it is those allegations to which
the motion must respond. (Citation.)” 
(Scolinos v. Kolts (1995) 37
Cal. App. 4th 635, 640-641; FPI Development, Inc. v. Nakashima (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 367, 382-383; Jordan-Lyon Prods., LTD. v. Cineplex Odeon Corp. (1994) 29
Cal.App.4th 1459, 1472.) The purpose of a motion for summary judgment or
summary adjudication “is to provide courts with a mechanism to cut through the
parties’ pleadings in order to determine whether, despite their allegations,
trial is in fact necessary to resolve their dispute.” (Aguilar v. Atl. Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.)  “Code of Civil Procedure section 437c,
subdivision (c), requires the trial judge to grant summary judgment if all the
evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence’
and uncontradicted by other inferences or evidence, show that there is no
triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to
judgment as a matter of law.”  (Adler v. Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7
Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.)  
 
“On a motion for summary judgment, the initial burden is
always on the moving party to make a prima facie showing that there are no
triable issues of material fact.” (Scalf
v. D.B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1519.) A defendant
moving for summary judgment “has met his or her burden of showing that a cause
of action has no merit if the party has shown that one or more elements of the
cause of action . . . cannot be established.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2).) “Once the defendant . . . has
met that burden, the burden shifts to the plaintiff . . . to show that a
triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to the cause of action or
a defense thereto.” (Ibid.)  
 
“When deciding whether to grant summary judgment, the court
must consider all of the evidence set forth in the papers (except evidence to
which the court has sustained an objection), as well as all reasonable
inference that may be drawn form that evidence, in the light most favorable to
the party opposing summary judgment.” (Avivi v. Centro Medico Urgente Medical Center (2008) 159
Cal.App.4th 463, 467; see also Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (c).) “An
issue of fact can only be created by a conflict in the evidence.  It is not created by speculation, conjecture,
imagination or guesswork.” (Lyons v.
Security Pacific National Bank (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 1001, 1041 (citation
omitted).)
 
The motion substantively relies on admissions deemed
admitted for all factual and legal contentions. Matters
that are admitted or deemed admitted through RFA discovery devices are
conclusively established in the litigation and are not subject to being
contested through contradictory evidence. (St.
Mary v. Superior Court (2014) 223
Cal.App.4th 762, 775 accord  Murillo v. Superior Court
(2006) 143 Cal.App.4th 730, 736.) On August 8, 2022, the court granted
the motion to deem admissions admitted. [Declaration of Jonathan Davis, Index
of Exhibits, Ex. 5.]
 
The court accepts the subject matter of the
admissions. The admissions themselves specifically establish the existence of a
prior judgment and right of the association to assess Agdaian for restorative
landscape work. Agdaian also admitted that the association would seek
reimbursement upon the sale of the property through escrow disbursement,
without any objection from Agdaian. No objections were stated, and Agdainan
approved the entire withdrawal. 
 
The court finds the admissions conclusively establish
the lack of any factual or legal grounds for the complaint based on the proper
collection of the assessment by Renaissance, thereby undermining any and all
claims for wrongful conduct in collecting the $67,153 via escrow disbursement.
The lack of any opposition further supports no finding of triable issues of
material fact. The unopposed motion for summary judgment is therefore granted
in favor of Renaissance.
 
Moving defendant is ordered to submit a judgment to the
court. All future motions, including the April 24, 2024, motion for terminating
sanctions and May 21, 2024, trial date are vacated.
 
Renaissance to give notice to all
parties.
