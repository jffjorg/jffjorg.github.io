This tentative ruling is by a judge in a case between Albert Agdaian, the plaintiff, and Renaissance Maintenance Corp., the defendant. The case involves a dispute over a payment of $67,153 made by escrow for alleged landscape repairs. The defendant moved for summary judgment, and the court granted the motion. The court found that the plaintiff's admissions established the existence of a prior judgment and the right of the association to assess the plaintiff for restorative landscape work. The court also found that the plaintiff had approved the payment without objection. Therefore, the court concluded that there were no triable issues of material fact, and the motion was granted in favor of the defendant.
