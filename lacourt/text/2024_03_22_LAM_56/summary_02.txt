English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge Holly J. Fujie regarding a motion for reconsideration filed by Plaintiff Leah Alspaugh against Defendant BNY Bank. The motion is related to the Court's previous ruling on Defendant's Motion to Quash Service of Summons, which was granted on October 20, 2023. Plaintiff argues that she properly served Defendant with the Complaint and that the Court does not have jurisdiction over Defendant. The Court finds that Plaintiff's motion is facially deficient as it does not comply with the affidavit requirements and does not present any new or different facts or law that would establish a basis for reconsideration. The motion is therefore denied.
