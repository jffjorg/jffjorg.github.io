Summary:

The judge's tentative ruling denies Defendant Firouzeh (Fay) Pugh's motions to compel further responses to Form Interrogatories, Set 1, due to Defendant's failure to engage in a reasonable and good faith attempt to informally resolve the discovery issues. The judge finds that Defendant's meet and confer efforts were inadequate and failed to fulfill Defendant's obligations under the Discovery Act. As a result, the judge orders Defendant and counsel for Defendant to pay monetary sanctions in the amount of $1050 to Plaintiffs.
