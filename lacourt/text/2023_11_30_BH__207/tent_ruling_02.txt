MOTION
 
Plaintiff Jane Doe I (“Plaintiff”) moves to consolidate this action
with 23SMCV01272, currently pending in Department I at the Santa Monica
courthouse.  
 
Defendants Centered Health, LLC and Los Angeles Outpatient Center have
filed an opposition, and Defendant The Hills Treatment Center, LLC has filed a
separate opposition.  Plaintiff has
replied to both.  
 
ANALYSIS
 
Code of Civil Procedure
section 1048, subdivision (a) provides:
 
When actions involving a
common question of law or fact are pending before the court, it may order a
joint hearing or trial of any or all the matters in issue in the actions; it
may order all the actions consolidated and it may make such orders concerning
proceedings therein as may tend to avoid unnecessary costs or delay.
 
            Per Local Rule 3.3, subdivision (g),
“Cases may not be consolidated unless they are in the same department.  A motion to consolidate two or more cases may
be noticed and heard after the cases, initially filed in different departments,
have been related into a single department, or if the cases were already
assigned to that department.”  (Super.
Ct. L.A. County, Local Rules, rule 3.3(g)(1).) 
Once the Court relates the cases, the Court may consolidate the actions
and order a joint trial on matters that “involve[e] a common question of law or
fact.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1048, subd.
(a).)
 
            Plaintiff
filed a notice of related case on April 4, 2023, which the Court rejected, on
the basis that Plaintiff did not file a proof of service indicating all
defendants were served, and there was no indication that the notice was filed
and served on all parties in the -1272 case. 
(See May 4, 2023 Minute Order.)  Plaintiff
subsequently filed proofs of service indicating that Defendants in this action
were served with the Notice of Related Case, but Plaintiff did not otherwise
renew the Notice of Related Case. 
Moreover, a review of the docket in the -1272 case indicates Plaintiff
never filed a Notice of Related Case in that case.         
 
            In
short, the Court finds that the actions are not related and pending in the same
department.  As such, the Court
determines that the actions are not ripe for consolidation per Section 1048 and
Local Rule 3.3.  
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
The Court denies without
prejudice Plaintiff’s motion to consolidate this action with 23SMCV01272.  
 
Plaintiff shall provide notice of the Court’s ruling and file a proof
of service regarding the same.
