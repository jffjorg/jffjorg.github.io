ANALYSIS
 
1.     
Timeliness
of Motions 
 
            A notice of motion to compel further
responses must be “given within 45 days of the service of the verified response,
or any supplemental verified response, or on or before any specific later date
to which” the parties have agreed in writing.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (c).)  Failure to file such a motion within this time
period constitutes a waiver of any right to compel further responses.  (Ibid.)

 
Here, Defendant filed the motions on the date set forth above.  Plaintiffs have not objected to the timeliness
of the motions.  
 
2.     
Meet and
Confer
 
            “A motion to compel must be
accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Code of Civil Procedure
section 2016.040.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300,
subd. (b)(1).)  “A meet and confer
declaration must state facts showing a reasonable and good-faith attempt at an
informal resolution of each issue presented by the motion.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2016.040.)  
 
            “The Discovery Act requires that,
prior to the initiation of a motion to compel, the moving party declare that he
or she has made a serious attempt to obtain an informal resolution of each
issue. This rule is designed ‘to encourage the parties to work out their
differences informally so as to avoid the necessity of a formal order.  . . . 
This, in turn, will lessen the burden on the court and reduce the
unnecessary expenditure of resources by litigants through promotion of
informal, extrajudicial resolution of discovery disputes.”  (Townsend
v. Superior Court (1998) 61 Cal.App.4th 1431, 1434-1435 [cleaned  up] (hereafter Townsend).)  To comply, “A reasonable and good-faith
attempt at informal resolution entails something more than bickering with
[opposing counsel].  Rather, the law
requires that counsel attempt to talk the matter over, compare their views,
consult, and deliberate.”  (Townsend, supra, 61 Cal.App.4th at p.
1439; see also Clement v. Alegre (2009) 177 Cal.App.4th 1277, 1294 [to
satisfy the attempt at informal resolution required in section 2016.040
opposing parties must do more than try to persuade each other of their
errors].)  In short, the Discovery Act
“requires that there be a serious effort at negotiation and informal
resolution.”  (Townsend, supra, 61 Cal.App.4th at p. 1438.)
 
            To that end, trial courts are
entrusted with discretion and judgment to determine the necessary effort
required to satisfy the requirement of an informal resolution. (Obregon v.
Superior Court (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 424, 433.)  In determining if parties have satisfied Section
2016.040, judges may consider “the history of the litigation, the nature of the
interaction between counsel, the nature of the issues, the type and scope of
discovery requested, the prospects for success and other similar factors can be
relevant.” (Id. at pp. 431-432 [holding that the trial court was correct
in determining that sending a letter with oppositions was an insufficient
attempt at an informal resolution].)  In
sum, meet and confer efforts should go beyond merely sending letters to each
other stating each party’s respective positions. 
 
            Here, as set forth in the
Declaration of David D. Samani (“Samani”), counsel for Defendant, Defendant asserts
she engaged in a reasonable and good faith attempt at an informal resolution of
the issues presented in the motions.  In
particular, Samani avers that on August 22, 2023, he prepared and sent a meet
and confer letter to counsel for Plaintiffs outlining the deficiencies with
Plaintiffs’ discovery responses. 
(Declaration of David D. Samani, ¶ 5, Exhibit 5.)  
 
            According to Samani, on August 31,
2023, counsel for Plaintiffs responded in writing refuting that Plaintiffs’
discovery responses were lacking and contending that an informal discovery
conference will be futile.   (Declaration of David D. Samani, ¶ 6, Exhibit.
6.)  Thereafter, on September 12, 2023, Samani
sent an email to counsel for Plaintiffs reiterating that Plaintiffs’ discovery
responses were factually devoid and non-compliant, and invited counsel for Plaintiffs
to “further meet and confer.”  (Declaration
of David D. Samani, ¶ 7, Exhibit. 7.)  
 
            On September 13, 2023, counsel for
Plaintiffs responded by arguing that Defendant failed to meet and confer:  “You do not explain in what respects the
responses are deficient and I do not know why the responses are not full and
complete.”  (Declaration of David D.
Samani, ¶ 8, Exhibit. 8.)  In responding
by email on September 13, 2023, Samani contends that the initial meet and
confer correspondence was adequate and in part inquired about counsel for
Plaintiffs’ availability to confer further. 
(Declaration of David D. Samani, ¶ 9, Exhibit. 9.)  
 
            Apart from those statements, Samani
does not set forth any other efforts to meet and confer with counsel for Plaintiffs.  The Court notes that Samani does not
telephone counsel for Plaintiffs to discuss the discovery responses, and does
not attempt to schedule a telephonic or remote conference with counsel for Plaintiffs
by suggesting dates or times to confer. 
Instead, Samani asks counsel for Plaintiffs to make himself available to
meet and confer.  
 
            In addition, the Court notes the
following history:  
 
a)      Discovery
Propounded:                                              June
27, 2023
b)      Discovery
Responded:                                                July 28, 2023
c)      Defendant’s
Meet and Confer Letter:                         August 22, 2023
d)      Plaintiffs’
Meet and Confer Response:                       August 31, 2023
e)      Defendant’s
Meet and Confer Email:                         September
12, 2023
f)       Plaintiffs’
Meet and Confer Responsive Email:         September
13, 2023
g)      Defendant’s
Meet and Confer Responsive Email:      September
13, 2023
h)      Defendant’s
Motions Filed:                                        September
13, 2023
 
            Based upon that chronology, Defendant
dispatched her only substantive meet and confer correspondence 25 days after
Plaintiffs served their discovery responses, and filed the instant motions 22
days after Defendant sent that correspondence. 
Further, Defendant does not respond to Plaintiffs’ meet and confer correspondence
of August 31, 2023 until the day before the motions to compel are due with, in
large part, an ultimatum:  “Please
confirm by the end of the day today that you are willing to attend an IDC and
have a further discussion on these issues, and provide my client an extension
of time to move to compel as to the 17.1 response to a date at least 2 weeks
after an IDC.”  The Court notes that Defendant
did not respond substantively to the issues raised in Plaintiffs’ August 31
correspondence.  
 
            Moreover, the Court notes, during
the period of August 23 through August 31, counsel for Defendant does not
attempt to reach out to counsel for Plaintiffs by telephone or other means in
attempt to further address the issues raised in Defendant’s August 22, 2023 meet
and confer correspondence.  The same is
true for the period of September 1 through 13 following Defendant’s receipt of
Plaintiffs’ August 31, 2023 meet and confer response.  
 
            This history begs the question:  Does it reflect a party interested and/or
willing to “talk the matter over, compare their views, consult, and deliberate”
in an effort to avoid a court’s intervention in a discovery dispute?  Without more, the Court finds that the answer
is No.  
 
            Accordingly, the Court finds that Defendant
has failed to meet and confer with Plaintiffs in a reasonable and good faith
attempt at an informal resolution of the issues presented in the motions for
the reasons stated.  The Court finds that
Defendant’s meet and confer efforts in advance of filing the subject motions
were woefully inadequate and certainly did not fulfill Defendant’s obligations
under the Discovery Act.  In other words,
the Court finds that there was no serious effort at negotiations and an informal
resolution by Defendant.             
 
3.      Monetary
Sanctions
            
A trial court may sanction a party for engaging in the misuse of
discovery, which includes:  failure to
respond or submit to an authorized method of discovery; making an evasive
response to discovery; making, without substantial justification, an
unmeritorious objection to discovery; making or opposing, unsuccessfully and
without substantial justification, a motion to compel or to limit discovery;
and failing to confer in a reasonable and good faith attempt to resolve
informally any dispute concerning discovery. (See Code Civ. Proc., §
2023.010, emphasis added.) 
 
            In addition, Code of Civil Procedure
section 2030.300, subdivision (d) provides: “The court shall impose a monetary
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party,
person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a
further response to interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to
the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances
make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” 

 
            Here, Plaintiffs and Defendant seek
monetary sanctions.  But with the Court
finding that Defendant failed to engage in a reasonable and good faith attempt
to informally resolve the discovery issues before filing the subject motions,
and as such, Defendant made motions to compel further discovery responses
without substantial justification, the Court concludes that Defendant engaged
in the misuse of the discovery process.  
 
            Consequently, the Court will deny Defendant’s
requests for monetary sanctions against Plaintiffs.  Instead, the Court will impose monetary
sanctions against Defendant and counsel for Defendant, Lewis Brisbois Bisgaard
& Smith LLP, in the amount of $1050 which represents three hours of
attorney time to prepare the oppositions to the motions, and to appear at the hearing
at $350 per hour.   
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDERS
 
Therefore, the Court denies Defendant’s
motions to compel further responses to Form Interrogatories, Set 1, for the
reasons stated above.  
 
            In addition, the Court orders Defendant
and counsel for Defendant, Lewis Brisbois Bisgaard & Smith LLP, jointly and severally to pay monetary
sanctions in the amount of $1050  to Plaintiffs,
by and through Counsel for Plaintiffs, on or before December 28, 2023.    
            
            Defendant
shall provide notice of the Court’s ruling and file a proof of service
regarding the same.
