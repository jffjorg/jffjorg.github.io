Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled on Pirooz Zarrabian's demurrer to the plaintiff's complaint. The demurrer was filed in response to the plaintiff's claims of declaratory relief, breach of fiduciary duty, conspiracy to defraud and fraudulent concealment, constructive trust, and promissory estoppel.

The judge denied Pirooz Zarrabian's demurrer as to the first, third, and fifth causes of action, finding that the plaintiff has adequately pled the factual elements necessary to support its claims. The judge sustained the demurrer as to the fourth cause of action, constructive trust, finding that the plaintiff has not adequately pled the factual elements necessary to support its claim.

The judge also ruled that the prior judgment in the quiet title action does not preclude the plaintiff's claims, as the plaintiff was not a party to or in privity with any party to the prior litigation. The judge further ruled that the plaintiff's allegations of breach of fiduciary duty, conspiracy to defraud and fraudulent concealment, and promissory estoppel are not precluded by the prior judgment.
