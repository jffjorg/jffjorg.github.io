And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

"This tentative ruling grants the six motions to be relieved as attorney of record for the defendants. The court finds that the breakdown in the attorney-client relationship and the breach of agreement as to paying expenses and attorney's fees are sufficient grounds for withdrawal. The court also notes that no opposing document has been filed showing any prejudice to the client. Therefore, the proposed orders submitted by counsel will be signed, and the attorney's motions to withdraw are granted."
