  Case Number:  23STCV05253    Hearing Date:   April 22, 2024    Dept:  55 NATURE OF PROCEEDINGS:
Motions to be Relieved as Attorney of Record.

BACKGROUND
MIKA YAMAMORI and JOHNNY PHAM (Plaintiffs), as self-represented
litigants, have sued ADC ENERGY, INC.; BOLTIER R& D, INC.; and HUN YONG
CHOE (“Defendants”), alleging that Defendants, as Plaintiffs' employers, joint
employers, officers, directors, or managing agents, committed various
wage-and-hour violations, including not (1) paying for all hours worked, (2) providing
uninterrupted meal and rest breaks, and (3) giving proper pay stubs. The causes
of action are (1) Unlawful Business Practices (Bus. & Prof. Code 17200 et.
seq.), (2) Failure to Pay Minimum Wage, (3) Failure to Provide Meal Breaks, (4)
Failure to Provide Rest Periods, (5) Labor Code Section 203 Wages, (6) Labor
Code 226 Damages, and (7) Wrongful Termination In Violation Of Public Policy.
Presently, Carl Pentis and Fred Wonsok Lee each move
to be relieved as attorney of record for Defendants.
LEGAL STANDARD
“The determination whether to grant or deny an
attorney’s motion to withdraw as counsel of record lies within the sound
discretion of the trial court, having in mind whether such withdrawal might
work an injustice in the handling of the case.” Lempert v. Sup. Ct.
(2003) 112 Cal.App.4th 1161, 1173. 
ANALYSIS
The form declarations state that the clients breached
an agreement as to paying expenses and attorney’s fees, and disputes have
arisen that created an irreconcilable breakdown of the attorney-client
relationships.
Additionally, the form notices, declarations, proposed
orders, and proofs of service sufficiently comply with the requirements for a
motion to be relieved as counsel. See
Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362. Further, moving counsel’s declaration shows
cognizable grounds for withdrawal: 

Breakdown
     in the attorney-client relationship (or personality clash). Estate of
     Falco v. Decker (1987) 188 Cal.App.3d 1004, 1014.
Client
     breaches an agreement or obligation to the member as to expenses or fees.
     Rules Prof. Conduct, rule 1.16; Lempert v. Sup. Ct. (2003) 112
     Cal.App.4th 1161, 1173.

Finally, no opposing document has been filed showing
any prejudice to the client. See Rules Prof. Conduct, rule 1.16, subdiv. (d). 
 
CONCLUSION
Therefore, the six motions are granted, and the Court
will sign the proposed orders submitted by counsel.
