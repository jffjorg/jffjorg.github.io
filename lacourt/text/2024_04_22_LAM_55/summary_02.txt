And here is the English text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has reviewed the plaintiff's complaint for breach of contract and the defendant's motion to strike the complaint. The defendant argues that the plaintiff's claims arise from protected activity under the anti-SLAPP statute, California Code of Civil Procedure Section 425.16. However, the court finds that the defendant has not met her burden of establishing the first step in the anti-SLAPP motion analysis. The court determines that the plaintiff has sufficiently evidenced merit of the complaint alleging contract breach. The court denies the defendant's motion to strike the complaint.
