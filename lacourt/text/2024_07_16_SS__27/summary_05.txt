And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion to continue the trial date to allow the defendant's motion for summary judgment to be heard. The current trial date was set for September 6, 2024, but the defendant filed its motion for summary judgment on May 21, 2024, and served it more than 105 days prior to the trial date, making it timely filed. The judge cannot refuse to consider a timely filed motion for summary judgment, as held in numerous courts of appeal. The new trial date is set for June 2, 2025, at 8:30 a.m., and the final status conference is continued to May 19, 2025, at 10:00 a.m. The parties are encouraged to submit to this tentative ruling by email, and if they do not, they should arrange to appear remotely or in person for oral argument.
