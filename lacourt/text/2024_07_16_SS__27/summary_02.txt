And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Neil Deepak Prasad vs Jose Silva Lopez et al. The motion to compel initial responses to special interrogatories has been deemed moot since the plaintiff has already received responses from the defendants. However, the judge finds that sanctions are appropriate under the circumstances. The defendants failed to provide responses to the discovery requests despite being given extensions, and the plaintiff had notified them that he would file a motion to compel discovery responses if no responses were received by the specified date. The judge grants the requests for sanctions and orders the defendants to pay $1000 in sanctions to the plaintiff.
