Ruling: MOTION TO CONTINUE TRIAL
IS GRANTED 
 
On September 12, 2022,
Plaintiff filed the present case. On May 21, 2024, Defendant City of Long Beach
filed a motion for summary judgment. The current trial date is September 6,
2024. The motion for summary judgment is scheduled to be heard on March 19,
2025. Defendant requests a trial continuance to sometime in June so its MSJ can
be heard.
Numerous courts of appeal have held that a
trial court cannot refuse to consider a motion for summary judgment that is
timely filed. "A trial court may not refuse to hear a summary judgment
filed within the time limits of [Code of Civil Procedure] section 437c.
[Citation.] Local rules and practices may not be applied so as to prevent the
filing and hearing of such a motion." (Sentry Ins. Co. v. Superior
Court (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 526, 529); accord First State Inc.
Co. v. Superior Court (2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 324, 330 [invalidating case
management order to the extent it precluded filing motions pursuant to section
437c ]; Wells Fargo Bank v. Superior Court (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 918,
923 [local court rule that "require a party filing a complex summary
judgment motion to file the motion six months before the date set for trial is
void and unenforceable because it is inconsistent with section 437c"].) As
the Sentry court explained: "We are sympathetic to the problems the
trial courts experience in calendaring and hearing the many motions for summary
judgment. However, the solution to these problems cannot rest in a refusal to
hear timely motions." (Sentry, supra, at p. 530.)
 
Defendant
filed and served its motion for summary judgment on May 21, 2024, with the
trial date set for September 6, 2024. The motion was served more than 105 days
prior to trial; therefore, it was timely filed, and the Court cannot refuse to
hear a timely filed motion for summary judgment.
The new Trial
Date is set for June 2, 2025, at 8:30 a.m. The Final Status
Conference is continued to May
19, 2025, at 10:00 a.m. The only basis to continue the trial date is so
the motion for summary judgment can be heard. Defendant has not shown good
cause to have the fact discovery cut-off follow the new trial date. Should the
parties wish to reopen fact discovery, they can do so either through
stipulation or motion.  All other
case-related deadlines, including expert discovery, will follow the new trial
date.
