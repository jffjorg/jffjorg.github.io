And here is the English text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the plaintiff's motion to vacate the dismissal of the case. The plaintiff, Everest National Insurance Company, filed a personal injury case and a Worker's Compensation subrogation claim against the defendants, M2 Concrete Pumping and Catalina Pacific Concrete Company. The trial date was set for March 11, 2024, but the case was dismissed without prejudice when the plaintiff's counsel failed to appear. The plaintiff now moves to vacate the dismissal, arguing that the dismissal was caused by the counsel's mistake in calendaring the trial date. The defendant opposes the motion, arguing that the dismissal was caused by the plaintiff's counsel's failure to appear in person and the connectivity issue. The judge agrees with the plaintiff that the counsel's declaration has substantially complied with the requirement of CCP 473 and that the counsel has attested to the mistakes that led to the dismissal. Therefore, the motion is granted.
