Here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the petition to approve the minor's compromise due to deficiencies in the application. Specifically, the judge noted that items under section 12a need to be revised to ensure correct totaling of numbers, and that items 12b(5)(b) and 12(a) need to be revised to ensure consistency. The judge has ordered the petitioner to correct these deficiencies no less than 5 days prior to the new court date set for July 16, 2024. Failure to do so may result in sanctions. The judge has also excused the personal appearance of the claimant and the guardian ad litem, allowing counsel to appear by telephone or video conference call.
