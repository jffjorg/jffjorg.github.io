And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the defendant's motion for leave to file a cross-complaint for equitable indemnity against Hrayr Basmajian, M.D. The plaintiff, Marjorie Matsuda, et al., filed suit against the defendant, Pomona Vista Care Center, et al., alleging dependent abuse, negligence, violation of Health and Safety Code section 1430(b), willful misconduct, and wrongful death.

The defendant claims that they only discovered the need to pursue a claim for equitable indemnity after the plaintiff's supplemental responses to RFA No. 33, which revealed that the plaintiff intended to allege that the defendant's negligence was based on failure to follow an implied order from Dr. Basmajian for post-surgical wound care. The court agrees that the plaintiff's supplemental responses indicated that the plaintiff intended to allege an implied order, and that the defendant would be substantially prejudiced if they were unable to pursue a claim for equitable indemnity.

The court cites several precedents, including City of Hanford v. Superior Court (1989) 208 Cal. App.3d 580 and Platt v. Coldwell Banker Residential Real Estate Services (1990) 217 Cal. App.3d 1439, to support its decision. The court concludes that the defendant's motion for leave to file a cross-complaint is granted.
