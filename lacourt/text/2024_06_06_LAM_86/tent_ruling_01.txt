[TENTATIVE] RULING ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF
  ADMINISTRATIVE MANDAMUS
 
Dept. 86 (Hon. Curtis A. Kin)
 
 




 


 


 


 



Petitioner
Hendrix W., by and through Jade Ahmadadeen, as guardian ad litem, petitions for
a writ of mandate 1) directing respondent Kim Johnson, Director, California
Department of Social Services (“Department”), in her official capacity, to set
aside the administrative decision denying protective supervision to petitioner
and 2) remanding the case for further proceedings. 
 
I.       Factual Background
 
A.          
In-Home
Supportive Services
 
“In
1973 the Legislature enacted the In-Home Supportive Services (IHSS) program to
enable aged, blind or disabled poor to avoid institutionalization by remaining
in their homes with proper supportive services.” (Miller v. Woods (1983)
148 Cal.App.3d 862, 867.) “The Department and its director are responsible for
administering the IHSS program in compliance with state and federal laws.
[Citations.] The Department promulgates regulations to implement the statutes [citations]
while the county welfare departments administer the program under the state’s
general supervision. The county departments process applications for IHSS
assistance [citations], determine the individual’s needs and authorize
services. [citation.].” (Id. at 868.) 
 
The
IHSS program is governed by Welfare and Institutions Code sections 12300, et
seq., and the Department’s Manual of Policies and Procedures (MPP), sections
30-700, et seq. The services that may be authorized through the IHSS program
are specified in MPP sections 30-757.11 through 30-757.19. (See RJN Ex.
A.) The Department issues additional guidance on IHSS benefits in All-County
Letters (“ACL”) to county departments. (RJN Ex. B [“ACL No. 15-25”].)
 
B.          
Protective
Supervision
 
Protective
supervision is an IHSS supportive service. (Welf. & Inst. Code § 12300(b).)
Protective supervision “consists of observing recipient behavior and
intervening as appropriate in order to safeguard the recipient against injury,
hazard, or accident.” (RJN Ex. A at MPP § 30-757.17.) It is a benefit available
for observing the behavior of “non-self-directing, confused, mentally impaired,
or mentally ill persons only.” (Id. at MPP § 30-757.171.) 
 
Protective
supervision is only authorized if “[a]t the time of the initial assessment or
reassessment, a need exists for twenty-four-hours-a-day of supervision in order
for the recipient to remain at home safely.” (Id. at MPP §
30-757.173(a).) Furthermore, protective supervision must be limited to the
functional limitations of the recipient and cannot be authorized for routine
childcare or supervision. (Id. at MPP § 30-763.456(d).) 
 
MPP
section 30-757.172 specifies five circumstances in which protective supervision
is not authorized:
            
(a)
For friendly visiting or other social activities;
 
(b)
When the need is caused by a medical condition and the form of the supervision
required is medical. 
 
(c)
In anticipation of a medical emergency; 
 
(d)
To prevent or control anti-social or aggressive recipient behavior. 
 
(e)
To guard against deliberate self-destructive behavior, such as suicide, or when
an individual knowingly intends to harm himself/herself.
 
“The
Department’s regulations, and case law, define the purpose and form of
protective supervision, which, in essence, determines the eligible recipients
of this benefit…. ‘ “Protective supervision” services authorized by section
12300 are “for monitoring the behavior of nonself-directing, confused, mentally
impaired, or mentally ill persons....” [Citation.] … To be eligible for such
services, an individual must show “that twenty-four hour need exists ... and
that the recipient can live at home safely if protective supervision is
provided.” [Citation.] [¶] Some recipients are old, suffering degenerative
diseases. Others are young but retarded, epileptic, blind, brain damaged or
schizophrenic. The recipients cannot protect themselves from injury. Some are
self-destructive. For example, one autistic, blind and brain-damaged child
lapses “into seizures and temper tantrums ... venting his frustrations by
banging his head against a wall.” Others cannot control normal but potentially
hazardous activities such as cooking or smoking a cigarette.’ [Citation.]” (Calderon
v. Anderson (1996) 45 Cal.App.4th 607, 614-15, quoting Miller v. Woods,
148 Cal.App.3d at 869.) “‘Protective supervision’ appears to be similar to care
given small children, that is, anticipating everyday hazards and intervening to
avert harm.” (Marshall v. McMahon (1993) 17 Cal.App.4th 1841, 1847.) “[E]ligibility
for IHSS benefits must generally be reassessed on an annual basis. [Citations.]”
(Norasingh v. Lightbourne (2014) 229 Cal.App.4th 740, 754.)
 
C.          
County
Denies Protective Supervision to Petitioner
 
At
the time of the annual reassessment at issue, petitioner was a 4-year-old male
diagnosed with autism and was nonverbal. (AR 3.) Petitioner resides with his
mother, his mother’s fiancé, and his sister. (AR 2-4.)  
 
After
county social worker Troy Hong conducted petitioner’s annual reassessment in
June 2022, petitioner was notified on June 30, 2022, that he was authorized for
42 hours and 4 minutes per month of IHSS benefits and denied protective
supervision. (AR 3, 112-13.) The social worker determined that, although petitioner
has a mental impairment, was likely to engage in dangerous activities, and
needed 24-hour a day supervision, he did not meet the purported requirement to
be “non self-directing due to mental impairment/mental illness.” (AR 496.)
 
On
July 5, 2022, Jade Ahmadadeen, petitioner’s mother and guardian ad litem, filed
a request for a hearing on the denial of protective supervision. (AR 119.) 
 
D.          
Respondent
Affirms Denial of Protective Supervision
 
On
September 28, 2022, a telephonic administrative hearing was held before
administrative law judge Jose Masso (“ALJ”) concerning the County’s denial of
protective supervision. (AR 2, 552.) The issue in dispute was whether the
County’s denial of protective supervision was proper. (AR 3.) Petitioner,
petitioner’s authorized representative, a county appeals specialist, and county
social worker participated in the hearing. (AR 3.) 
 
The
County’s position was that petitioner does not qualify for protective
supervision because he is self-directing and the type of supervision required
is akin to routine childcare for a child of similar age. (AR 482-83.) The
County submitted its position statement (AR 479-86); Notice of Action, dated
June 30, 2022 (AR 487-90); Health Care Certification form (SOC 873) (AR
491-92); Case Assessment Narrative (AR 493-98); SOC 821 form (AR 499);
petitioner’s Individualized Education Program (“IEP”) (AR 500-33); and
petitioner’s Individual Program Plan (“IPP”) (AR 534-43).
 
Petitioner
submitted the Request for Hearing (AR 32-33, 119-123); handwritten notes by
petitioner’s mother (AR 35-36, 115-16); a print-out of petitioner’s mother’s
text exchange with a neighbor (AR 37-38, 117-118); Authorized Representative
Form (AR 39, 110); position statement (AR 40-104); Notice of Action, dated June
30, 2022 (AR 112-13); SOC 821 form (AR 125); two protective supervision
questionnaires (AR 126-27); examples of petitioner’s self-injurious behaviors
(AR 128-31); petitioner’s IPP (AR 132-45); a psychological assessment (AR
146-58); petitioner’s IEP (AR 159-192); Insurance Treatment Plan (AR 193-223);
and copies of correspondence and miscellaneous information (AR 224-478).
 
At
the hearing, petitioner’s mother testified that petitioner would attempt to
climb furniture 12 or more times in a day and put things in his mouth over 20
times in a day. (AR 5, 578-80, 582.) Petitioner’s mother also testified that
petitioner would attempt to elope in public, but she did not take him in public
except to go to the park on Fridays. (AR 6.) The county social worker’s
Assessment Narrative found petitioner to be self-directing as “[m]ost four-year
old children are unable to assess danger and risk of harm; therefore,
[petitioner] is not expected to be able to exercise good judgment and safety
awareness.” (AR 496.) At the hearing, the social worker testified that he did
not observe any behavior indicating that petitioner was nonself-directing. With
regards to petitioner’s climbing behavior, the social worker testified that
this behavior is typical for four-year children. (AR 589.) The social worker’s Assessment
Narrative stated that the climbing behavior is “not unlike those of
typically-developing four-year-old children.” (AR 496.)
 
On
October 21, 2022, the ALJ issued his post-hearing decision (“Decision”). (AR
2.) First, the Decision found that petitioner has a mental impairment. (AR 21.)
Second, the Decision found that petitioner is “self-directing.” (AR 21.) Third,
the Decision found that petitioner is not likely to engage in dangerous behaviors.
(AR 29.) Fourth, the Decision determined that petitioner does not require
24-hour supervision. (AR 31.) The Decision did not make a finding regarding
whether petitioner requires more supervision than routine childcare. (AR
21-31.)
 
Regarding
engagement in dangerous behaviors, the ALJ determined that many of petitioner’s
identified behaviors are either not dangerous or have been eliminated by an
environmental modification. (AR 30.) Petitioner’s behaviors of stove play and
attempts to elope from the home have been abated due to environmental
modifications, including locks on the stove and doors. (AR 30.) Further, the
ALJ found that petitioner’s mouthing behavior does not pose a danger as there
is no reliable evidence concerning the frequency of the behavior to conclude it
is a danger to him. (AR 30.) The ALJ also found that the evidence does not show
that petitioner’s climbing or jumping was an inherently dangerous behavior. (AR
30.)          
 
Having
found that petitioner is self-directing, not likely to engage in dangerous
behaviors, and certain behaviors were predictable, the ALJ determined that
petitioner was ineligible for protective supervision, even though petitioner
has a qualifying mental health condition. (AR 31.) 
 
II.      Procedural History
 
            On
October 4, 2023, petitioner filed a verified Petition for Writ of
Administrative Mandamus. On December 14, 2023, respondent filed an Answer.
 
            On
April 8, 2024, petitioner filed an opening brief. On May 7, 2024, respondent
filed an opposition. On May 21, 2024, petitioner filed a reply. Petitioner has
also lodged the administrative record and joint appendix. 
 
III.     Standard of Review
 
Under CCP § 1094.5(b),
the pertinent issues are whether the respondent has proceeded without
jurisdiction, whether there was a fair trial, and whether there was a
prejudicial abuse of discretion. An abuse of discretion is established if the
agency has not proceeded in the manner required by law, the decision is not
supported by the findings, or the findings are not supported by the evidence.
(CCP § 1094.5(b).)
 
The Court exercises its
independent judgment in reviewing denials of applications for public
assistance. (See Norasingh v. Lightbourne (2014) 229 Cal.App.4th 740,
752.) Under the independent judgment test, “the trial court not only examines
the administrative record for errors of law, but also exercises its independent
judgment upon the evidence disclosed in a limited trial de novo.” (Bixby v. Pierno (1971) 4 Cal.3d 130, 143.) The court
must draw its own reasonable inferences from the evidence and make its own
credibility determinations. (Morrison v.
Housing Authority of the City of Los Angeles Board of Commissioners (2003)
107 Cal. App. 4th 860, 868.)  
 
An agency is presumed to
have regularly performed its official duties. (Evid. Code § 664.) “In
exercising its independent judgment, a trial court must afford a strong
presumption of correctness concerning the administrative findings, and the
party challenging the administrative decision bears the burden of convincing
the court that the administrative findings are contrary to the weight of the
evidence.”  (Fukuda v. City of Angels (1999) 20 Cal.4th 805, 817, internal
quotations omitted.) 
 
“On questions of law
arising in mandate proceedings, [the court] exercise[s] independent judgment.’”
(Christensen v. Lightbourne (2017) 15 Cal.App.5th 1239, 1251.) The
interpretation of statute or regulation is a question of law. (See State
Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Quackenbush (1999) 77 Cal.App.4th 65, 77.)

Merits
 
For
petitioner to be entitled to protective supervision, he must show that he is: (1)
“nonself-directing, confused, mentally impaired or mentally ill” (MPP §
30-757.171); (2) requires “twenty-four-hours-a-day supervision in order . . .
to remain at home safely” (MPP § 30-757.173(a)); and (3) requires “more
supervision” than “routine childcare” (MPP § 30-763.456(d)). 
 
1.         
Petitioner
Has a Qualifying Mental Impairment
 
Under
MPP § 30-757.171, petitioner must show that he is “nonself-directing, confused,
mentally impaired or mentally ill.” Petitioner satisfies this requirement. The
county social worker and the ALJ found that petitioner has a mental impairment,
specifically autism spectrum disorder. (AR 4, 21, 496.) 
 
In
the Decision, the ALJ found that “a person must be both mentally impaired or
mentally ill and nonself-directing to be eligible for Protective Supervision.”
(AR 15.)[1]
The Court disagrees. Because the regulation uses the word “or,” petitioner only
needs to show that he is one of the four possible characteristics listed in the
regulation. “Such use of the word ‘or’ in a statute indicates an intention to
use it disjunctively so as to designate alternative or separate categories.” (White
v. County of Sacramento (1982) 31 Cal.3d 676, 680.) In this regard, the
plain language of the regulation is clear and unambiguous. “[T]he principle of
deference [to an agency’s interpretation of its own regulation] is not without
limit; it does not permit the agency to disregard the regulation’s plain
language. [Citation.]’ [Citation.]” (Ortega v. Johnson (2020) 57
Cal.App.5th 552, 564)
 
The
ALJ cited Marshall v. McMahon (1993) 17 Cal.App.4th 1841 and Calderon
v. Anderson (1996) 45 Cal.App.4th 607 to support the proposition that “a
person must be both mentally impaired or mentally ill and nonself-directing to
be eligible for Protective Supervision.” (AR 15.) In Marshall, the Court
of Appeal considered whether MPP § 30-757.171 illegally denied protective
supervision to physically impaired individuals. (Marshall, 17
Cal.App.4th at 1844, 1846.) In Calderon, the Court considered whether
the petitioner, who was “completely bedridden,” qualified for protective
supervision. (Calderon, 45 Cal.App.4th at 610.) To the extent either
case made statements suggesting that nonself-direction is a requirement for
protective supervision, such statements must be interpreted “in accordance with
the facts and issues before the court.” (People v. Knoller (2007) 41
Cal.4th 139, 154-55.) In neither case did the Court of Appeal differentiate
between “nonself-directing, confused, mentally impaired, or mentally ill
persons.” “An opinion is not authority for propositions not considered.’” (Ibid.)
 
Respondent
has specifically declined to oppose petitioner’s arguments regarding
non-self-direction. Respondent contends that petitioner’s arguments about
non-self-direction are “a non-issue because petitioner does not meet the
remaining conditions of eligibility.” (Opp. at 12:1-5.) Accordingly, it would appear
that respondent concedes, as the Court here finds, that petitioner satisfies
the requirement under MPP § 30-757.171 for protective supervision. 
 
2.           
Weight
of Evidence Supports that Petitioner Requires 24-Hour Supervision
 
Under
MPP § 30-757.173(a), petitioner must show that he requires
“twenty-four-hours-a-day supervision in order . . . to remain at home safely.” “The
purpose of protective supervision is to monitor active behavior in order to
prevent harm from daily hazards…. [P]rotective supervision is available for
those IHSS beneficiaries who … cannot protect themselves from injury, and who
would most likely engage in potentially dangerous activities.” (Calderon,
45 Cal.App.4th at 616; accord Marshall v. McMahon (1993) 17 Cal.App.4th
1481, 1846-87.)
 
            Petitioner contends that he requires
24-hour supervision based on mouthing inedible objects, i.e., putting inedible
items in his mouth, and unsafe climbing.
 
            With respect to mouthing inedible
objects, the ALJ found that “the mouthing behavior does not pose a danger to the
Child, as there is no reliable evidence concerning the frequency of the
mouthing behavior to conclude it is a danger to him.” (AR 30; see also AR
28 [“[T]here is no reliable evidence concerning the frequency of the mouthing behavior
to conclude it is a danger to the Child”].) The ALJ asserted: “[T]he IEP
superficially discusses the Child’s mouthing behavior in school, which suggests
it is infrequent.” (AR 28.) The ALJ also asserts that, considering the
comprehensive nature of the IEP, the IEP would have provided more detail
concerning petitioner’s mouthing if he was mouthing 20 times a day, as his
mother contended. (AR 162.) 
 
However,
the IEP states: “Hendrix frequently puts non-food items in his mouth.” (AR
162.) Moreover, Yesenia Rivas, petitioner’s BCBA supervisor, provided 20 hours
of 1:1 direct supervision of petitioner per week. (AR 127.) In a document
titled “Protective Supervision Questionnaire—Therapist,” when asked whether
petitioner was eligible to receive therapy due to an inability to assess danger
and the risk of harm, Ms. Rivas wrote: “Yes, the Client has an inability to
assess danger with behaviors related to elopement, climbing, and putting items
in his mouth.” (AR 127.) Ms. Rivas also wrote that petitioner “needs more
supervision [during therapy sessions than a neurotypical individual of
comparable age] for caution of putting objects in his mouth.” (AR 127.) Ms.
Rivas also added that petitioner “need[s] to be supervised from the start and
end of the session” due to petitioner putting items in his mouth. (AR 127.)
Although the IEP and Ms. Rivas did not specify the frequency of the mouthing, no
set frequency is required. The mouthing must be unpredictable, as well as
“frequent and long enough that constant supervision is necessary.” (RJN Ex. B
at 5.) Ms. Rivas believed that petitioner has a habit of mouthing inedible
objects which poses a danger to him, thereby necessitating constant supervision
of petitioner. 
 
As
stated above, petitioner’s mother testified that petitioner mouthed inedible
items, including coins, a broken toy, paper, and a pen, over twenty times a
day. (AR 582-83.) Further, in connection with the hearing, petitioner’s mother
provided a four-page behavioral log, consisting of five or six occasions of mouthing
behavior from August 12 to September 12, 2022. (AR 128-31 [8/12, 8/14, 8/16,
8/17, 8/18, 8/21].) The ALJ found: “If the Child was in fact mouthing items 20
times a day, there would have been 20 entries for each of the 22 days where the
Child’s behavior was being monitored.” (AR 27.) This finding is not necessarily
true. The title of the log was “Examples of Potentially Self-Injurious
Behaviors.” (AR 128-30.) The use of the word “Examples” indicates that the log was
not necessarily all-inclusive, but rather illustrative of petitioner’s
potentially dangerous behaviors. Accordingly, the fact that petitioner’s mother
documented five or six instances of mouthing in the behavior log is not
necessarily inconsistent with her testimony that petitioner mouths inedible
objects over twenty times a day.
 
The
ALJ also found that petitioner’s mouthing is not dangerous because he has not
choked or come close to choking. (AR 30.) Specifically, the ALJ reasoned:
 
Moreover,
if the Child were to mouth objects 20 times a day, that would mean the Child would
place an inedible object in his mouth 7,300 times a year (20 x 365 = 7,300).
Yet, neither in Claimant’s testimony, nor in the documentary submissions, was
there mention of choking. Thus, if the Child had 7,300 occurrences of mouthing,
it follows then that there must have been an incident of choking or near
incident. But because there is no evidence that the Child has choked or come
close to choking, the conclusion to draw is that the Child is not mouthing
objects at such a rate to pose a danger. Alternatively, if Claimant is taken at
her word that the Child mouths objects 20 times a day, that would mean that the
Child is so adroit at mouthing objects that he has avoided choking 7,300 times
per year. In either alternate scenario, there is no danger indicated.
 
(AR
30.) The lack of potential danger of mouthing inedible objects cannot be
inferred from the fact that petitioner has not choked or come close to choking.
Under the Department’s policy, “a person does not have to suffer actual injury
to be eligible for Protective Supervision, but only have a history of a
propensity for placing him/herself in danger.” (RJN Ex. B at 5, emphasis in
original.) For example, “[a] person with a documented history of
nonself-direction, who has a tendency to open the front door and start walking
away, does not necessarily have to make it into the street in order for this to
be considered potentially hazardous behavior.” (RJN Ex. B at 5.) Based on the
Department’s policy, petitioner’s mother does not need to wait for petitioner
to have almost choked before the mouthing is considered potentially hazardous
behavior. 
 
            With respect to unsafe climbing, petitioner’s
mother testified that petitioner climbs furniture over twelve times a day. (AR
578-80.) Ms. Rivas also observed that petitioner would “climb cabinets,
shelves, and tables with the intent to jump off.” (AR 127.) In an
“Insurance Treatment Plan Concurrent Review Authorization Re-Assessment
Report,” petitioner was reported to have climbed at a rate of 100 instances per
day. (AR 426.) 
 
The
ALJ found: “The evidence does not show that the Child’s climbing or jumping
poses a danger to him. Nothing was shown that those acts are inherently
dangerous. What was demonstrated was that the Child is intentionally engaged in
the behavior for some entertainment value.” (AR 30.) The regulations do not
specify that the danger must be inherent. Rather, the regulations state that “[p]rotective
Supervision consists of observing recipient behavior and intervening as
appropriate in order to safeguard the recipient against injury, hazard, or
accident.” (MPP § 30-757.17.) Moreover, while regulations prohibit protective
supervision for “deliberate self-destructive behavior” (MPP § 30-757.172(e)), meaning
that the recipient has “knowledge that the activity may cause self-harm” (RJN
Ex. C at 6-7), the fact that petitioner may enjoy climbing (AR 493) does not
mean that petitioner is deliberately self-destructive. The weight of the
evidence supports that petitioner is not aware of the danger of climbing
furniture. Ms. Rivas reported that petitioner has an “inability to assess
danger” when climbing furniture. (AR 127.) 
 
Petitioner
“attempt[s] to jump off grounds from any high objects in his surroundings.” (AR
127.) Ms. Rivas stated that petitioner’s climbing necessities supervision from
the start to the end of sessions. (AR 127.) The county social worker agreed
that petitioner places himself in harm or danger when he climbs on furniture at
home. (AR 496.) The county social worker also found that petitioner needs
24-hour-a-day supervision (AR 496), which is consistent with the opinions of
petitioner’s pediatrician (AR 125), teacher (AR 126), BCBA supervisor (AR 127),
and Regional Center coordinator (AR 137,141) that petitioner requires constant
supervision. 
 
            Petitioner’s mouthing of inedible
objects and unsafe climbing are potentially dangerous activities. Accordingly,
petitioner satisfies the 24-hour supervision requirement.
 
3.           
Weight
of Evidence Supports that Petitioner Requires More Supervision Than Routine
Childcare
 
“Protective
supervision…[is] limited to protective supervision needed because of the
functional limitations of the recipient. This service shall not include routine
child care or supervision.” (MPP § 30-763.456(d).)
 
            The county social worker determined
that most four-year-old children are unable to assess danger and risk of harm.
(AR 496.) The county social worker also concluded that climbing on furniture in
the home is “not unlike those of typically-developing four-year-old children.”
(AR 496.) However, according to the California Department of Education’s
Guidelines for Early Learning in Child Care Home Settings, a preschool-age
child “may need help” if the child “[d]oes not recognize dangerous situations
such as walking in traffic or jumping from high places.” (AR 325.) Accordingly,
failure to recognize the danger in jumping from high places may indicate that
supervision beyond routine childcare is required. This guideline applies to
petitioner, as his IEP stated that one of the impacts of his disability is
impaired safety awareness. (AR 136.)
 
            Petitioner’s teacher and BCBA
supervisor agreed that petitioner requires more supervision than a typical
student of comparable age. (AR 126-27.) Petitioner also participates in special
education with a 2:1 teacher-student ratio. (AR 126.) Petitioner’s pediatrician
stated that petitioner has “severely impaired” judgment, has “no concept of
danger,” and “needs to be supervised at all times.” (AR 125.) The opinions of
petitioner’s teacher, BCBA supervisor, and pediatrician outweigh the opinion of
a social worker who observed petitioner for only twenty minutes. (AR 493
[social worker’s in-person assessment took place from 2:45 p.m. to 3:05 p.m.].)
 
            Based on the foregoing, the weight
of the evidence demonstrates that petitioner requires more supervision than
routine childcare.
V.      Conclusion
 
Petitioner having demonstrated that he is entitled
to protective supervision, the petition is GRANTED. Respondent is ordered to
set aside the Decision denying petitioner protective supervision and remand the
case to Los Angeles County to authorize protective supervision to petitioner
and to pay petitioner’s provider retroactive IHSS wages with prejudgment interest
for services provided from the date of petitioner’s application. Pursuant to
Local Rule 3.231(n), petitioner shall prepare, serve, and ultimately file a
proposed judgment and writ of mandate.
