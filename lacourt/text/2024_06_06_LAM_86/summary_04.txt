And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The court has denied the defendants' request for a preliminary injunction to enjoin the plaintiff and cross-defendant Ladder Capital Realty III, LLC, cross-defendant Ladder Capital Finance LLC, and cross-defendant Chicago Title Company (collectively, "Lender") from undertaking any activity to continue with the pending non-judicial foreclosure proceeding and trustee's sale relating to the defendants' properties.

The court found that the defendants failed to demonstrate a likelihood of prevailing on their breach of the implied covenant and wrongful foreclosure claims. The court also found that the defendants waived any implied covenant or wrongful foreclosure claim by agreeing to the Modification and Release Agreement on June 23, 2023.

The court further found that the defendants did not establish a likelihood of success on their claims based on Lender's purportedly unreasonable conduct. The court also found that the defendants failed to provide any meaningful evidence of their assertion that they were unable to secure alternative financing.

The court denied the defendants' request for a preliminary injunction, notwithstanding any harm that may result from the denial of the request.
