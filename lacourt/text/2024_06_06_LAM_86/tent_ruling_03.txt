OF PETITION AND MOTION

MOTION FOR ORDER NUNC PRO TUNC
 
Date:               6/6/24
(1:30 PM)
Case:                           Estate of Limmie
Jones, Jr. et al. v. Southern California Regional Rail Authority (24STCP00926)
  
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
I.                  
RESPONDENT’S MOTION TO QUASH SERVICE OF PETITION
AND MOTION
 
Respondent Southern California Regional Rail Authority’s
Motion to Quash Service of Petition and Motion is GRANTED IN PART. 
 
As a preliminary matter, respondent
Southern California Regional Rail Authority’s UNOPPOSED requests for judicial
notice are GRANTED, pursuant to Evidence Code § 452(d). (See also Proof
of Service attached to Motion for an Order, Nunc Pro Tunc filed 4/12/24 and
Corrected Proofs of Service re: Motion for an Order, Nunc Pro Tunc filed
5/2/24.) 
 
Respondent Southern California Regional Rail Authority moves
to quash service of the (1) Petition for Order Relieving Petitioners from
Provisions of Government Code Section 945.4 or Otherwise Accepting Petitioners’
Government Claims as Timely (“Petition for Relief”); and (2) Motion for an
Order, Nunc Pro Tunc, That the Petition in This Action Was Filed on March 15,
2024 (“Motion for Relief”).
 
A motion to quash may be granted on the ground that the
court lacks jurisdiction over the respondent. (CCP § 418.10(a)(1).)
“[C]ompliance with the statutory procedures for service of process is essential
to establish personal jurisdiction. [Citation.]” (Dill v. Berquist
Construction Co. (1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 1426, 1444.) “When a [respondent] challenges
[personal] jurisdiction by bringing a motion to quash, the burden is on the
[petitioner] to prove the existence of jurisdiction by proving, inter alia, the
facts requisite to an effective service.” (Id. at 1439-40.) 
 
With respect to a petition seeking relief from Government
Code Section 945.4’s provisions, Government Code § 946.6(d) states: “A copy of
the petition and a written notice of the time and place of hearing shall be
served before the hearing as prescribed by subdivision (b) of Section 1005 of
the Code of Civil Procedure on…the clerk or secretary or board of the local
public entity, if the respondent is a local public entity….” 
 
Here, with respect to the Petition for Relief, petitioners
have not filed any proof of service of the Petition for Relief. In petitioners’
opposition to the motion to quash, petitioners only address service of the Motion
for Relief. (See Chaskin Decl. ¶ 10 [“On April 15, 2024 at approximately
10:00 a.m., I arrived at 900 Wilshire Boulevard to serve METROLINK with
Petitioners’ Motions for an Order Nunc Pro Tune that the Petition in this
Action was filed on March 15, 20224 [sic].”]; see also Chaskin Decl. ¶¶
11-13; Opp. at 2:26-27 [“In addition, Petitions submit that Defendant was
properly served with Petitioners Motion (See, Declaration of Richard M. Chaskin
and supporting exhibits.)”]; RJN Exs. A, B [proofs of service for Motion for
Relief].) 
 
Petitioners thus fail to meet their burden to demonstrate
service of the Petition for Relief on the clerk, secretary, or board of
respondent pursuant to Government code § 946.6(d). Accordingly, with respect to
service of the Petition for Relief on respondent, the motion is GRANTED.  Service of the Petition for Order Relieving
Petitioners from Provisions of Government Code Section 945.4 or Otherwise
Accepting Petitioners’ Government Claims as Timely is hereby QUASHED. 
 
With respect to the Motion for Relief, Government Code §
946.6(d), on which respondent relies, only addresses service of a petition for
relief from claim requirement under Government Code § 945.4. Government
Code § 946.6(d) is not applicable to the Motion for Relief. Even though the
Court grants the motion to quash with respect to the Petition for Relief, as
set forth above, this does not deprive the Court of jurisdiction to consider
the merits of the Motion for Relief. “Where a [respondent] has not appeared,
service of notice or papers need not be made upon the [respondent].” (CCP §
1014; see Gov. Code § 945.2 [“Except as otherwise provided by law, the
rules of practice in civil actions apply to actions brought against public
entities”].) Because respondent has not appeared, notice of the Motion for
Relief need not be made on respondent. The motion to quash with respect to the
Motion for an Order, Nunc Pro Tunc, That the Petition in This Action Was Filed
on March 15, 2024 is DENIED. 
 
II.               
PETITIONERS’ MOTION FOR ORDER NUNC PRO TUNC
 
Petitioners Estate of Limmie Jones, Jr., Latanuza Jones,
Willie Richey, and Brian Hagen’s UNOPPOSED Motion for an Order Nunc Pro Tunc
that the Petition in this Action was Filed on March 15, 2024 is GRANTED. 
 
On May 7, 2024, the Court continued the motion on petitioners’
Motion for Order Correcting Filing Date Nunc Pro Tunc to be heard with
respondent’s Southern California Regional
Rail Authority aka Metrolink’s Motion to Quash Service of
Petition and Motion. Having determined that the motion to quash is denied as to
the Motion for Relief, the Court rules on the merits of the motion.
 
On Friday, March 15, 2024, petitioners electronically submitted
the following documents for filing: (1) Petition for Order Relieving
Petitioners from Provisions of Government Code Section 945.4 or Otherwise
Accepting Petitioners’ Government Claims as Timely; and (2) Declaration of
Attorney Richard M. Chaskin in Support of Petition for Order Relieving
Petitioners from Provisions of Government Code Section 945.4 or Otherwise
Accepting Petitioners’ Government Claims as Timely. (Chaskin Decl. ¶ 6; Shtofman
Decl. ¶ 3; Exs. 1, 2.) Petitioners obtained a “New Case Receipt” indicating
that the two documents were “Filed to Court Successfully” on March 15, 2024 at
12:22 a.m. (Chaskin Decl. ¶¶ 7, 8; Shtofman Decl. ¶¶ 4-6; Ex. 3.) 
 
The clerk’s office later rejected the filing of the two
documents. (Chaskin Decl. ¶¶ 10, 11; Shtofman Decl. ¶¶ 8, 9; Exs. 4-7.) The
reason given on the Notice of Court Rejection of Electronic Filing was “Unable
to file the Petition without the required mandatory form ‘Civil Case Coversheet
Addendum and Statement of Location’.” (Chaskin Decl. ¶ 10; Shtofman Decl. ¶ 8;
Ex. 4.) Although the notice of rejection indicated that it was generated at
7:53 a.m. on March 15, 2024 (Ex. 4), the notice was not sent to petitioners
until 4:30 p.m. (Chaskin Decl. ¶ 12; Shtofman Decl. ¶ 10.) On March 18, 2024,
the next court day, petitioners attempted to have the documents filed as of
March 15, 2024. (Shtofman Decl. ¶ 12.) The clerk refused, explaining that once
the documents are filed, petitioners could seek an order nunc pro tunc to deem
the documents filed as of March 15, 2024. (Shtofman Decl. ¶ 12.) Petitioners re-filed
the documents on March 21, 2024, with the civil case cover sheet addendum. (Chaskin
Decl. ¶ 17; Shtofman Decl. ¶ 13; Exs. 8-10.)
 
On April 12, 2024, petitioners filed a motion for order nunc
pro tunc deeming the filing date of the Petition to be March 15, 2024. 
 
“[T]he local Superior Court may not condition the filing of
a complaint on local rule requirements. Instead, so long as a complaint
complies with state requirements, the clerk has a ministerial duty to file. In
legal effect, a complaint is ‘filed’ when it is presented to the clerk for
filing in the form required by state law.” (Carlson v. State of California
Department of Fish & Game (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 1268, 1270.) “If a
party that is required to provide a cover sheet under this rule or a similar
local rule fails to do so or provides a defective or incomplete cover sheet at
the time the party’s first paper is submitted for filing, the clerk of the
court must file the paper.” (Rule of Court 3.220(c).) “The Judicial Council
added subdivision (c) to former rule 982.2 (subsequently renumbered as 3.220)
effective January 2002 to address the very problem that occurred in this case:
‘the refusal of some clerks to file an initial pleading because it is not
accompanied by a cover sheet or the sheet is somehow defective.’” (Mito v.
Temple Recycling Center Corp. (2010) 187 Cal.App.4th 276, 280.)
 
The March 15, 2024 filings were improperly rejected for lack
of cover sheet. Accordingly, the motion for order nunc pro tunc is GRANTED. The
Petition and supporting declaration are deemed filed on March 15, 2024. (See
Rojas v. Cutsforth (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 774, 778 [holding that complaint
should be deemed filed on date presented when clerk had no proper basis to
reject complaint].)
