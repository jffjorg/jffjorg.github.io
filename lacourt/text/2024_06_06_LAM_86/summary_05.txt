Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied the request for a preliminary injunction by Vinatex, Inc. and 3300 Leonis Blvd LLC to prevent Oxford SCS, Inc. and Jihoon Cho from erecting a fence and obstructing the driveway between the two properties. The Judge finds that the plaintiffs have not demonstrated a likelihood of prevailing on their claim that they are entitled to an easement for use of the Broadway Property. The Judge also finds that the plaintiffs have not established any great or irreparable harm that would warrant the issuance of a preliminary injunction. The Judge notes that the plaintiffs have access to their property through an 8-foot entrance and that they can adjust the use of their property to widen the access. The Judge also points out that the plaintiffs' claim that an 8-foot opening is insufficient under fire codes requiring fire apparatus access roads to be at least 20 feet wide is unclear. The Judge concludes that the plaintiffs' request for a preliminary injunction is denied.
