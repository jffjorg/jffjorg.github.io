Here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling addresses two motions: a motion to quash service of the petition and a motion for an order nunc pro tunc. The court grants the motion to quash service of the petition with respect to the Petition for Relief, as petitioners failed to provide proof of service of the petition. The court denies the motion to quash service of the motion for relief. The court also grants the motion for an order nunc pro tunc, deeming the filing date of the petition as March 15, 2024, as the clerk's office improperly rejected the filing due to lack of cover sheet.
