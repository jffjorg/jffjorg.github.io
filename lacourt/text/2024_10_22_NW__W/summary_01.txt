The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the motions to compel further responses to interrogatories, requests for admissions, and requests for production of documents. The Court has granted the motion to compel further responses to the requests for admissions, but has denied the motion to compel further responses to the requests for production of documents with regards to certain requests.

The Court has also granted the motion to compel further responses to the requests for production of documents with regards to certain other requests, but has denied the motion with regards to one request. The Court has denied the request for sanctions.

The Court has noted that the defendant's position was substantially justified, and that both parties' positions were substantially justified. The Court has also noted that the defendant cannot have it both ways (must produce the agreement or not move to compel arbitration) and has ordered the defendant to produce all responsive documents if they have not already done so.

The Court has set the hearing for October 22, 2024, and has given the parties an opportunity to review and object to the tentative ruling.
