And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the motion to compel arbitration and stay further proceedings pending arbitration filed by Defendant Ed Carroll Motor Company, Inc. The judge found that while the arbitration agreement is valid and enforceable, the claims against Defendant Porsche NA and Porsche WHN do not rely on the existence or terms of the purchase agreement and therefore cannot be compelled to arbitration. The judge also found that the possibility of conflicting rulings on common issues of law or fact is a significant factor in denying the motion to compel arbitration.
