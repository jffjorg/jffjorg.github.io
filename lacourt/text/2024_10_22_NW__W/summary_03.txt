Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the defendants' demurrer to the plaintiff's first amended complaint is overruled. The plaintiff, Nazeli Dobadzhyan, alleges that she was employed by the defendants as an exempt employee, but was misclassified as an independent contractor and not paid wages during the last year of her employment. The defendants, Vagik Sarkisyan, Artour Ambartsoumyan, Venus Banquet, Inc., and Edvin Baghumian, demurred to the complaint, arguing that it fails to state a claim under Labor Code section 558.1 and that the plaintiff has not sufficiently alleged facts to support her claims.

The judge found that the plaintiff has sufficiently alleged facts to support her claims for violation of labor laws against the defendants. The judge noted that the defendants did not request judicial notice and instead challenged the factual claims. The judge also noted that the plaintiff has alleged more than just liability against the defendants, citing their roles as owners, shareholders, officers, directors, and/or managing agents of Venus Banquet, Inc.

The judge further noted that determining whether an owner violated or caused to be violated certain wage and hour laws within the meaning of Section 558.1 "cannot be determined by any bright line rule, as this inquiry requires an examination of the particular facts in light of the conduct, or lack thereof." The judge also found that the plaintiff's allegations of alter ego liability were sufficient for the purposes of a demurrer.

Accordingly, the defendants' demurrer to the first amended complaint is overruled, and the case will proceed to the next stage of litigation.
