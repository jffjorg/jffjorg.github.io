ANALYSIS
Motion To Be Relieved As Counsel
Discussion
Attorney David L. Ingram moves to
be relived as counsel for Defendants Shin Wong King and Kil Cha Kang,
individually and as a Trustee of the Shin Won Kang and Kil Cha Kange Revocable
Living trust 2013
California
Rules of Court, Rule 3.1362 requires that the following Mandatory Judicial
Council forms be filed for a motion to be relieved as counsel: Notice of Motion
and Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel--Civil (form MC-051); Motion to Be
Relieved as Counsel--Civil (form MC-052); and Order Granting Attorney's Motion
to Be Relieved as Counsel--Civil (form MC-053). (See Calif. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1362(a), (c), (e).)  These three forms must be served on must be
served on the client and on all other parties who have appeared in the case.
(Calif. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1362(d).)
The Court may issue an order allowing an attorney to withdraw
from representation, after notice to the client. (Code Civ. Proc., § 284(2).)  n attorney may withdraw with or without cause
as long as the withdrawal would not result in undue prejudice to the client's
interest - i.e., counsel cannot withdraw at a critical point in the litigation
because that would prejudice client, but can withdraw otherwise.  (Ramirez
v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915.) The court has discretion to
deny an attorney’s request to withdraw where such withdraw would work an injustice
or cause undue delay in the proceeding; but the court’s discretion in this area
is one to be exercised reasonably. (Mandell
v. Superior Court (1977) 67 Cal.App.3d 1, 4.) 
All mandatory Judicial Council forms have been submitted and
filled out.

The
clients have stopped communicating with counsel. (Declarations, ¶ 2.) 
Trial is
currently set for July 1, 2014, which gives the clients time to locate new
counsel, which the trust Defendant must do, as it cannot represent itself in
pro per. 
Here, permitting withdrawal of counsel is appropriate if
counsel cannot even communicate with the client. 
However, moving counsel did not file and serve the
proposed order on mandatory Judicial Council form MC-053.
The hearing on the motions to be relieved as counsel is CONTINUED
to November 3, 2023. Moving counsel must file and serve the proposed order on mandatory
Judicial Council form MC-053. Also, moving counsel must provide proof of
service on Defendant Kil Cha Kang regarding the notice of motion, as
well as proof of service regarding the notice of continuance.
