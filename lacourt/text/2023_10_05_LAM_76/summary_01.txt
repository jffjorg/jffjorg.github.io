And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to be relieved as counsel filed by Attorney David L. Ingram, who represents Defendants Shin Wong King and Kil Cha Kang, individually and as a Trustee of the Shin Won Kang and Kil Cha Kang Revocable Living Trust 2013. The motion is continued to November 3, 2023, and moving counsel must file and serve the proposed order on mandatory Judicial Council form MC-053. Additionally, moving counsel must provide proof of service on Defendant Kil Cha Kang regarding the notice of motion and the notice of continuance. The judge notes that the clients have stopped communicating with counsel, and permitting withdrawal of counsel is appropriate in this case. However, moving counsel did not file and serve the proposed order, which is a required step in the process.
