deposition that does not comply with Article 2 (CCP § 2025.210 et seq.) See CCP § 2025.410(a). The

required to be included in a deposition notice (CCP §§ 2025.220, 2025.230), to
whom notice of the deposition must be given (CCP § 2025.240), the location of
the deposition (CCP §§ 2025.250, 2025.260), the number of days required to be
given in advance of the deposition (CCP § 2025.270), and the manner of service
upon party deponents (CCP § 2025.280).

(b) The
court, for good cause shown, may make any order that justice requires to
protect any party, deponent, or other natural person or organization from

of the following directions:

certain matters not be inquired into.
 
(10) That
the scope of the examination be limited to certain matters.
