And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Korea TV/Radio vs. Ethos Society Ktown Holdings, LLC. The case involves a dispute over forcible entry into a leased office space, with the plaintiff alleging that the defendant failed to provide safe access to the space due to malfunctioning elevators and changed locks. The defendant demurred to the First Amended Complaint, arguing that the plaintiff's claim is barred by the pendency of another action on the same cause of action. The judge has ruled that the demurrer is without merit and has overruled it. However, the judge has also stayed the action pending a ruling on the defendant's motion to compel arbitration. The judge has also granted the defendant's request for judicial notice of the other action pending in the same court.
