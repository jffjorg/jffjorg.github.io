TENTATIVE RULING
Defendant
Ethos Society Ktown Holdings, LLC’s demurrer to the First Amended Complaint is
OVERRULED. However, the action is ordered stayed pending a ruling on the motion

ANALYSIS
Demurrer
Request For Judicial Notice
            Defendant’s request that the Court
take judicial notice of the Complaint and First Amend Complaint filed in 23STCV06711
is GRANTED per Evid. Code, § 452(d)(court records).
Meet and Confer
            Because
this is a forcible entry action, the meet and confer requirement does not
apply. (Civ. Proc. Code, § 430.41(d)(2).)
Discussion
Defendant
Ethos Society Ktown Holdings, LLC demurs to the First Amended Complaint as
follows:
1.         First and only cause of action
(forcible detainer[1]).
            Defendant
argues that there is another action pending between the same parties on the
same  cause of action, namely, LASC Case
No. 23STCV06711, which was filed by Korea TV/Radio on March 27, 2023, with a
1AC filed therein on April 12, 2023, adding a cause of action for forcible
entry. Thereafter Plaintiff  Korea
TV/Radio filed this forcible entry action on August 25, 2023.
            This
ground for demurrer existed when the demurrer to the original Complaint—which was
overruled—was filed on April 26, 2023. Normally, it would be barred by Civ.
Proc. Code, § 430.41(b). However, § 430.41 does not apply to forcible entry proceedings.
(Civ. Proc. Code, § 430.41(d)(2).)
            Defendant
argues that the first and second actions are both stayed pending the ruling on
the motions to compel arbitration filed in the first and second actions. Quite
simply, the fact that a motion to compel arbitration was filed in this, the
second, action on August 9, 2023 is a sufficient basis to order this action
stayed. 
If an application has been made to a court of competent jurisdiction,
whether in this State or not, for an order to arbitrate a controversy which is
an issue involved in an action or proceeding pending before a court of this
State and such application is undetermined, the court in which such action
or proceeding is pending shall, upon motion of a party to such action or
proceeding, stay the action or proceeding until the application for an order to
arbitrate is determined and, if arbitration of such controversy is ordered,
until an arbitration is had in accordance with the order to arbitrate or until
such earlier time as the court specifies.

     (Civ.
Proc. Code § 1281.4 [bold emphasis added].)
            Even if treated as a demurrer on the
ground of another action pending, the proper course of action would be to stay
the action, not dismiss it.
As Witkin also notes, "[t]he pendency of
another action is classified as one of the pleas in abatement or dilatory
pleas, and, as such, it is 'not favored.' " (5 Witkin, Cal. Procedure, op.
cit. supra, § 921 at p. 358, italics in original.) Among other things, this
disfavor is expressed in the rule that " . . the demurrer should not be
sustained without leave to amend and the action should not be dismissed."
(Ibid.)
(Branson v. Sun-Diamond Growers (1994)
24 Cal.App.4th 327, 336 n.2.)
            As
such, the demurrer is OVERRULED. However, the action is ordered stayed pending
a ruling on the motion to compel arbitration.
