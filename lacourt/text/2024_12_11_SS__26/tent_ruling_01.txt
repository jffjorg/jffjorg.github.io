  Case Number:  23STLC00223    Hearing Date:   December 11, 2024    Dept:  26 PRC Restoration, Inc. v. Vivian, et al.,TENTATIVE RULING:Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant, PRC Restoration, Inc.’s Motion to Compel Responses to Requests for Production, Set One, and Request for Monetary Sanctions is GRANTED. DEFENDANT / CROSS-COMPLAINANT ARDINE VIVIAN IS TO SERVE VERIFIED RESPONSES TO THE DISCOVERY REQUESTS, WITHOUT OBJECTIONS, WITHIN 20 DAYS’ SERVICE OF THIS ORDER. DEFENDANT AND COUNSEL OF RECORD ARE JOINTLY AND SEVERALLY ORDERED TO PAY SANCTIONS OF $1,278.00 TO PLAINTIFF'S COUNSEL WITHIN 20 DAYS’ SERVICE OF THIS ORDER.ANALYSIS:Plaintiff / Cross-Defendant, PRC Restoration, Inc. (“Plaintiff”) filed the instant Motion to Compel Responses to Requests for Production, Set One, and Request for Monetary Sanctions on November 1, 2024. Defendant/Cross-Complainant Ardine Vivian (“Defendant”) filed an opposition on November 25, 2024, and Plaintiff replied on November 3, 2024.DiscussionPlaintiff moves to compel Plaintiff’s responses to the Request for Production of Documents, Set One, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.300. On August 26, 2024, Plaintiff served Request for Production of Documents, Set One, on Defendant. (Motion, Schiller Decl., ¶2 and Exh. 1.) As of the filing of this motion, Defendant had not served responses to the discovery nor sought an extension of the time to respond. (Id. at ¶¶3-4.) There is no requirement for a prior meet and confer effort before a motion to compel initial responses can be filed. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300.) Furthermore, the motion can be brought at any time after the responding party fails to provide the responses. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300.)Defendant’s opposition contends that verified responses to the document requests were served on November 24, 2024. However, the responses that were purportedly served include a verification dated March 18, 2018 and that refers to Request for Production of Documents, Set Two. (Opp., Smith Decl., Exh. C, p. 8.) Failure to provide a proper verification renders the responses null because unverified responses “are tantamount to no responses at all.” (Appleton v. Superior Court (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 632, 636.) Based on Defendant’s failure to timely serve initial responses to the discovery, Plaintiff is entitled to an order compelling Defendant to serve verified responses without objections. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300.)Defendant’s failure to timely respond also constitutes a misuse of the discovery process. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (d).) Sanctions are appropriate under Code of Civil Procedure sections 2023.010 and 2023.030 and have been properly noticed. Pursuant to a lodestar calculation, sanctions are awarded against Plaintiff and their counsel of record in the amount of $1,278.00 based on 2.1 hours of attorney time billed at $580.00 per hour and costs of $60.00. (Motion, Schiller Decl., ¶5.)ConclusionTherefore, Plaintiff / Cross-Defendant, PRC Restoration, Inc.’s Motion to Compel Responses to Requests for Production, Set One, and Request for Monetary Sanctions is GRANTED. DEFENDANT / CROSS-COMPLAINANT ARDINE VIVIAN IS TO SERVE VERIFIED RESPONSES TO THE DISCOVERY REQUESTS, WITHOUT OBJECTIONS, WITHIN 20 DAYS’ SERVICE OF THIS ORDER. DEFENDANT AND COUNSEL OF RECORD ARE JOINTLY AND SEVERALLY ORDERED TO PAY SANCTIONS OF $1,278.00 TO PLAINTIFF COUNSEL WITHIN 20 DAYS’ SERVICE OF THIS ORDER.Moving party to give notice.
