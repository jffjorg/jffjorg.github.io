And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling will depend on what happens at the upcoming hearing on December 11, 2024. The parties have reached a conditional settlement agreement, and a request for dismissal will be filed by December 20, 2024. The judge notes that under California Rules of Court, rule 3.1385, the court must vacate all hearings and other proceedings requiring the appearance of a party, unless requested by a party. However, the court need not vacate a hearing on a motion for sanctions. The plaintiff is to appear through counsel of record at the hearing and clarify whether the motion for sanctions is to proceed in light of the parties' settlement agreement.
