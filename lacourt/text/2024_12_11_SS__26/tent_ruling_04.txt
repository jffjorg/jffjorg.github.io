 Case Number:  LAM03K07260    Hearing Date:   December 11, 2024    Dept:  26 Creditors Bureau of California v. Zamoras Trucking, et al.,TENTATIVE RULING:Plaintiff’s Creditors Bureau of California’s Motion to Set Aside Judgment and Dismiss Defendant is DENIED without prejudice to bring a new motion setting forth the law and permissible grounds on which the court may set aside the judgment against Defendant Zamoras Trucking, S/P aka Zamora Transport.ANALYSIS:On June 12, 1993, Plaintiff Creditors Bureau of California obtained a judgment against Defendants Zamoras Trucking S/P, Juan J Zamora, and Josette M Zamora. The Declaration of counsel filed in support of this motion does not set forth  the circumstances under which the judgment was obtained. The procedure by which the judgment was taken, matters to the law and standards the court must apply when considering a motion to set aside a judgment. Plaintiff has not previously moved to set aside the judgment. Rather, Plaintiff renewed the judgment, on April 18, 2003, March 12, 2013, and January 12, 2023 and for the first time filed the instant Motion to Set Aside Judgment and Dismiss Defendant Zamoras Trucking, S/P aka Zamora Transport, with Prejudice on April 15, 2024. No opposition has been filed to date.DiscussionPlaintiff brings the instant Motion on the grounds that since the time of entry of renewal of judgment filed on March 12, 2013, Plaintiff subsequently discovered that Defendant is no longer in business. (Notice of Motion, p. 1:24-26.) Yet, Plaintiff does not explain why despite this knowledge, it renewed the Judgment again on January 12, 2023. The Motion is also not supported by a memorandum of points and authorities, as required by the California Rules of Court. Plaintiff’s failure to provide a memorandum as required by the Rules is an “admission that the [request] is without merit and cause for its denial.” (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1113(a), (b); In re Marriage of Falcone & Fyk (2012) 203 Cal.App.4th 964, 976.) While equitable grounds may exist to set aside default judgments, see e.g.  Olivera v. Grace, (1942) 19 Cal. 2d 570, 575, Plaintiff has not provided any law of procedure or in equity, that supports its request to set aside the judgment and dismiss Defendant with prejudice in this case.ConclusionPlaintiff’s Creditors Bureau of California’s Motion to Set Aside Judgment and Dismiss Defendant with Prejudice is DENIED, without prejudice to file a motion that complies with the rules of court and sets forth the legal basis for the requested relief.Court clerk to give notice.
