And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the motion filed by PRC Restoration, Inc. (the plaintiff) to compel responses to requests for production, set one, and requests monetary sanctions. The plaintiff served the request for production on August 26, 2024, but the defendant, Ardine Vivian, failed to serve responses. The defendant's purported responses included a verification dated March 18, 2018, which refers to a different set of production requests. The judge finds that the defendant's failure to provide proper verification renders the responses null. As a result, the judge orders the defendant to serve verified responses to the discovery requests without objections within 20 days of the order. Additionally, the judge awards sanctions of $1,278.00 to the plaintiff's counsel, which is calculated based on 2.1 hours of attorney time billed at $580.00 per hour and costs of $60.00. The judge also orders the defendant and their counsel to pay the sanctions within 20 days of the order.
