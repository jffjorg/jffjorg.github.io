And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the Creditors Bureau of California's motion to set aside the judgment against Zamoras Trucking, et al. and dismiss the defendant with prejudice. The motion was filed for the first time on April 15, 2024, and the plaintiff has not previously moved to set aside the judgment. The plaintiff failed to provide a memorandum of points and authorities in support of its motion, which is required by the California Rules of Court. The judge also noted that the plaintiff has not explained why it renewed the judgment again on January 12, 2023, despite knowing that the defendant was no longer in business. The motion is denied without prejudice, meaning that the plaintiff can file a new motion that complies with the rules of court and sets forth the legal basis for the requested relief.
