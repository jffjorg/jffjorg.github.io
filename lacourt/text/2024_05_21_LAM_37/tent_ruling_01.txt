Background
 
On November 15, 2019, Sean Michaels (“Michaels”) and PB Consulting,
LLC (collectively “Plaintiffs”) filed a Complaint against Christopher M.
Stevens; the Law Office of Christopher M. Stevens (collectively “Stevens”); LKP
Global Law (“LKP”) and Does 1 to 10.) 
 
The Complaint
alleges a single cause of action for Professional Negligence. According to the
Complaint, in 2015 Michaels retained LKP and later, Stevens, to represent him
in a dispute against his business partner Daniel Cooper (“Cooper”) regarding
the business entity Reliant Life Shares, LLC (“Reliant”) in an action entitled Reliant
Life Shares, LLC v. Daniel B. Cooper, et al. (LASC Case No. BC604858) (the
“Underlying Action”).
 
On April 16, 2021,
this court granted a stay of this action pending completion of the appeal of
the Underlying Action. On April 4, 2023, the
Second District issued a published opinion, Reliant Life Shares, LLC v.
Cooper (2023) 90 Cal.App.5th 14. 
 
On December 27,
2023, Defendant LKP filed a Motion for Judgment of Pleadings (MJOP) arguing
that Plaintiffs were collateral estopped from bringing this action against LKP.
Plaintiffs opposed the Motion. On January 25, 2024, the court granted the MJOP
with leave to amend. 
 
On February 26, 2024, Plaintiff filed the operative First Amended
Complaint (“FAC”) alleging a single cause of action for professional
negligence.
 
On May 9, 2024, the  Steven
Defendants’ demurrer to the FAC was sustained with leave to amend. Now
Defendant LKP demurs to the FAC. The matter is now before the court.

Discussion
 
I.         Legal Standard
 
Where pleadings are defective, a party may raise the defect
by way of a demurrer. (Coyne v. Krempels (1950) 36 Cal.2d 257, 262.) A
demurrer tests the sufficiency of a pleading, and the grounds for a demurrer
must appear on the face of the pleading or from judicially noticeable matters.¿
(CCP § 430.30(a); Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) In
evaluating a demurrer, the court accepts the complainant’s properly pled facts
as true and ignores contentions, deductions, and conclusory statements. (Daar
v. Yellow Cab Co. (1976) 67 Cal.2d 695, 713; Serrano v. Priest (1971)
5 Cal.3d 584, 591.) Moreover, the court does not consider whether a plaintiff
will be able to prove the allegations or the possible difficulty in making such
proof. (Fisher v. San Pedro Peninsula Hospital (1989) 214 Cal.App.3d
590, 604.) 
Leave to amend must be allowed
where there is a reasonable possibility of successful amendment. (Goodman v.
Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.)¿ The burden is on the complainant to
show the Court that a pleading can be amended successfully. (Ibid.)
 
II.        Demurrer[1]
 
“The
elements of a cause of action in tort for professional negligence are: the duty
of the professional to use such skill, prudence and diligence as other members
of the profession commonly possess and exercise; a breach of that duty; a
proximate causal connection between the negligent conduct and the resulting
injury; and actual loss or damage resulting from the professional's
negligence.” (Burgess v. Superior Court (1992) 2 Cal.4th 1064,
1066–1067.) “[I]n a legal malpractice action, whether a court
or jury decides the issue of causation ‘does not turn on the identity or
expertise of the trier of fact, but whether the issues are predominately
questions of fact or law.’ ” (Mireskandari v. Edwards Wildman
Palmer LLP (2022) 77 Cal.App.5th 247, 265.) 
 
Plaintiff’s
single cause of action for professional negligence hinges on the fact that LKP
failed to enforce the December 18, 2017 Settlement Agreement while Defendant
Stevens was employed by LKP. (FAC ¶ 24(c).) 
 
In its
May 9, 2024 Order, this court noted: 
 
Plaintiffs
fail to explain how the dismissal of the constructive trust claim would have
prevented the trial court in the Underlying Action from finding alter ego
liability and precluded judgment against Plaintiffs despite the existence of
other common law claims asserted against Plaintiffs by Cooper. For this reason,
the court agrees that Plaintiff has failed to show that Defendants' failure to
enforce the Settlement Agreement proximately caused Plaintiffs to be damaged.
Plaintiffs need to allege facts that show how the dismissal of the constructive
trust claim from the Underlying Action would have prevented Plaintiffs from
suffering “loss of use of said assets, ongoing attorney fee amounts, exposure
of his personal property[.]” (FAC ¶ 34.) 
 
Second,
the FAC fails to allege facts to show that had the constructive trust claim
against Plaintiff Michaels been dismissed, this would have precluded the trial
court in the Underlying Action from finding alter ego liability as to
Plaintiffs. “An alter ego defendant has no separate primary liability to the
plaintiff. Rather, plaintiff's claim against the alter ego defendant is
identical with that claimed by plaintiff against the already-named defendant.”
(Hennessey's Tavern, Inc. v. American Air Filter Co. (1988) 204
Cal.App.3d 1351, 1358.) The FAC fails to allege that if the intentional tort
claims against Plaintiff Michaels had been dismissed, the trial court in the
Underlying Action would not have found alter ego liability. Alter ego is a
procedure that allows the court to disregard the corporate entity and hold the
alter ego individuals liable for the obligations of the corporation where the
corporate form is used to escape personal liability, sanction a fraud, and
promote injustice. (Id. at p. 1359.) Here, the FAC fails to allege facts
to show that Plaintiffs could have avoided the judgment in the underlying
action but for the Defendants conduct. 
 
In other
words, Plaintiffs fail to allege specific facts to show how the other
allegations outlined in Paragraph 24 proximately caused Plaintiffs’ damages.
 
(Order
05/09/2024 at p. 6.) 
 
For the
reasons reiterated above, the court finds that the FAC fails to allege how
enforcing the Settlement Agreement would have prevented the finding of alter
ego liability against Plaintiffs in the Underlying Action. Furthermore, the FAC
fails to allege facts to show that LKP’s failure to enforce the settlement
agreement prior to Defendant Stevens leaving LKP constituted malpractice and
proximately caused Plaintiff’s damages. Accordingly, the demurrer to the FAC is
sustained with leave to amend. 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant
LKP’s demurrer is sustained with leave to amend. Plaintiffs are granted 30 days leave to amend. The court
sets the OSC RE: Amended
Complaint for June 27, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. Defendant LKP to give notice.
