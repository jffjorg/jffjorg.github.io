[1] “ ‘In
law and motion practice, counsel will frequently prepare a summary of facts in
support of or in opposition to the motion. This may be part of a memorandum of
points and authorities or consist of a separate statement of facts. Such a
practice is useful as long as each fact mentioned is supported by admissible
evidence and preferably if each such factual allegation is followed by an
appropriate reference to the evidence accompanying the motion or opposition.
However, absent such support in the evidence submitted, the court must
disregard ‘facts’ contained in an unverified statement. [Citation.] The only
evidence the trial court should have considered and which we may consider here
is that contained in the declarations filed in support of and in opposition to
the motion. The matters set forth in the unverified ‘Statement of Facts’ and in
memoranda of points and authorities are not evidence and cannot provide the
basis for the granting of the motion.” (Smith, Smith & Kring v. Superior
Court (Oliver) (1997) 60 Cal.App.4th 573, 577–78.)
