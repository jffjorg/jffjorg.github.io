And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to reopen discovery, which seeks to obtain a 911 audio recording and depose the caller. The plaintiff argues that the recording was not produced in discovery and is critical to his case. However, the defendant argues that the recording was available to the plaintiff and that the plaintiff failed to independently attempt to discover the recording. The judge finds that the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate good cause for reopening discovery and that the defendant would be prejudiced by reopening discovery. The judge also notes that the plaintiff did not exercise diligence in pursuing the discovery.
