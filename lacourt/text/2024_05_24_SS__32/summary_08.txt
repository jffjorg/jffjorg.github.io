And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling denies Plaintiff Sonia Arevalo's motions to deem admitted Requests for Admission, Set One and compel verified responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One. The plaintiff served the discovery requests on September 29, 2023, but the defendant failed to provide timely responses. As a result, the plaintiff filed the motions to deem admitted and compel responses. The court found that the defendant's unverified responses were tantamount to no response at all and that the plaintiff's requests were properly served. Therefore, the court denied the motions and also denied the request for monetary sanctions.
