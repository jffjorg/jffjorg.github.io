And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling discusses the admissibility of evidence in court proceedings. The court emphasizes that only evidence contained in filed declarations is admissible, and unverified statements of fact are disregarded. The case cites Smith v. Superior Court (1997) as precedent, which states that unverified statements cannot provide the basis for granting a motion. The court will consider only the evidence submitted in support of and in opposition to the motion.
