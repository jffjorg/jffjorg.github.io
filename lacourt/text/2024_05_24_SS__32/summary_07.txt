The Court has issued a tentative ruling denying Counsel's motion to be relieved as Counsel for Plaintiff Carl Smith. The Court finds that Counsel's efforts to confirm Plaintiff's address and provide notice to be insufficient. Counsel has not provided proof of Plaintiff's death or notified Plaintiff's personal representative or successor in interest to continue the case. The Court also notes that Counsel has not included dates, times, and locations of future proceedings in the case. Based on these findings, the Court denies the motion without prejudice, requiring Counsel to provide notice and file proof of service.
