And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to deem the matters in their request for admissions (RFA) as admitted. The plaintiff brought an action against the defendants for breach of contract, alleging that they failed to deliver three gas-fired ceramic kilns in working condition despite timely payment of the purchase price. The defendants failed to respond to the plaintiff's RFA demands, which led to the plaintiff's motion to deem the matters admitted. The court notes that a failure to oppose a motion may be deemed consent to its being granted. The court awards sanctions in the amount of $800 to the plaintiff as against the defendants' counsel, which reflects two hours of attorney work at the stated rate of $400 per hour. The court orders that the sanctions be paid within 30 days.
