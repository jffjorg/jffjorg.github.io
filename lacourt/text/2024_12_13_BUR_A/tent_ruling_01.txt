ENFORCE SETTLEMENT

Los Angeles Superior Court
Case # 21STCV23431

 



MP:  


Rodrigo Roderex Rodriguez III dba
  Roderex Trucking (Defendant)




RP:  


Andrew Rafat Bolous (Plaintiff)



 
NOTICE:
 

The Court is
requesting oral argument on this matter.  Parties are requested to address
the issue of whether the July 24, 2024 email from Plaintiff’s counsel is
accompanied by an electronic signature. 
 
ALLEGATIONS: 
 
On June 24, 2021,
Andrew Rafat Bolous (Plaintiff) brought this action against Rodrigo Roderex Rodriguez III dba Roderex Trucking (Roderex)
and STG Holdings, LLC (STG) (collectively Defendants). Plaintiff alleges that,
on August 14, 2019, he was injured by virtue of Defendants’ negligence in
delivering and installing a car lift. Plaintiff alleges that Defendants’
failure to bring a forklift to unload the car lift and efforts to unload the car
lift via other means resulted in the car lift falling on Plaintiff. 
 
On July 24, 2024,
Plaintiff filed a Notice of Settlement of Entire Case. This notice indicated
that the settlement was conditional upon the satisfactory completion of
specified terms. The Court then set an OSC re: Dismissal for November 12, 2024.
On November 12, Defendants’ counsel informed the Court that there was
difficulty in finalizing the settlement agreement and requested additional time
to bring the instant motion. 
 
Defendants now move
to enforce the settlement agreement pursuant to C.C.P. § 664.6. Defendants
state that despite Plaintiff’s counsel having confirmed the settlement in
writing, Plaintiff has refused to sign the Settlement Agreement. 
 
Plaintiff has filed a
document entitled “Opposition to Defendants’ Motion to Enforce Settlement”. This
document presents no substantive argument as to the Settlement Agreement.
Instead, the opposition informs that Plaintiff intends to personally appear at
the hearing for this motion to present arguments. It is unclear from this
filing whether Plaintiff’s counsel will also be present at the hearing. 
  
ANALYSIS: 
 
I.                   
LEGAL
STANDARD 
 
Pursuant to C.C.P. § 664.6: “If parties
to pending litigation stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties outside the
presence of the court or orally before the court, for settlement of the case,
or part thereof, the court, upon motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the
terms of the settlement. If requested by the parties, the court may retain
jurisdiction over the parties to enforce the settlement until performance in
full of the terms of the settlement.” 
 
“Section 664.6 was enacted to provide a
summary procedure for specifically enforcing a settlement contract without the
need for a new lawsuit.” (Chan v. Lund (2010) 188 Cal.App.4th 1159,
1165-66 [quoting Weddington Productions, Inc. v. Flick (1998) 60
Cal.App.4th 793, 809-10.]) Under C.C.P. § 664.6, a court may determine disputed
factual issues regarding the settlement agreement and even permits the court “to
entertain challenges to the actual terms of the stipulation, that is, whether
there actually was a settlement … and to interpret the terms of the settlement
agreement.” (Fiore v. Alvord (1985) 182 Cal.App.3d 561, 566.)
 
The Court notes that C.C.P. § 664.6 was
amended in 2021 to clarify the Legislature’s intent that the statutes use of
the word “parties” included attorney representatives. (See Greisman
v. FCA US, LLC (2024) 103 Cal.App.5th 1310.) 
 
II.                
MERITS 
 
Relevant Facts 
 
On
July 17, 2024, the parties participated in a formal mediation with mediator
Richard L. Gilbert (Ret.) (Hawatmeh Decl. ¶ 2.) In the course of this
mediation, the parties reached a settlement of the case. (Hawatmeh Decl.
¶ 3.) As evidence of the agreement, Defendants attach a copy of an email
correspondence on which all parties and the mediator are attached. (Hawatmeh
Decl. Exh. 1.) This email exchange is as follows:
 
·        
July 17, 2024, the mediator emails to confirm his
settlement recommendation. The mediator suggests that Plaintiff accept and that
defendants pay a specific settlement amount in full and complete settlement of
Plaintiff's claim. The mediator further suggested that Roderex bear the cost of
mediation. The mediator also stated, “Plaintiff Rodriquez has authorized me to
convey, and I did convey, that subject to confirmation of defendants' authority
to settle at that amount, he is prepared to accept the recommendation.”
(Hawatmeh Decl. Exh. 1, p. 9.) 
 
·        
July 22, 2024, Roderex’s counsel emailed to confirm that
their insurance carrier has agreed to the settlement. Roderex’s counsel asks
counsel for STG to prepare the global release. (Hawatmeh Decl. Exh. 1, p. 8.)
 
·        
July 22, 2024, the mediator replies requesting that, “everyone
confirm by “reply all” email that we have a settlement on the terms described
below and the agreement that the email will serve as the written
memorialization of that settlement within the meaning of Code of Civil
Procedure section 664.6(b)(2).” (Hawatmeh Decl. Exh. 1, p. 7.)
 
·        
July 22, 2024, counsel for STG confirms the settlement and
states they will circulate a global release. (Hawatmeh Decl. Exh. 1, p. 6.)
 
·        
July 22, 2024, counsel for Plaintiff replied simply, “Agreed.”
(Hawatmeh Decl. Exh. 1, p. 6.)
 
·        
July 22, 2024, counsel for Roderex requests counsel for STG
invoice the mediation to Roderex’s insurance carrier. (Hawatmeh Decl. Exh. 1,
p. 6.)
 
·        
July 23, 2024, counsel for STG forwards the invoice. (Hawatmeh
Decl. Exh. 1, p. 6.)
 
On
July 23, 2024, Plaintiff served Defendants with a
Notice of Settlement of Entire Case which was signed by Plaintiff’s counsel.
(Hawatmeh Decl. ¶ 5.) A release was circulated (the Settlement Agreement)
but Plaintiff did not sign it. (Hawatmeh Decl. ¶ 6.) On August 15, 2024,
Plaintiff, independently from his attorneys, reached out via telephone to Roderex’s
counsel to inquire about the policy limits of the case. (Id.) Roderex’s
counsel did not speak to Plaintiff, who stated in his voicemail that “the case
is settled and everything is fine.” (Id.) 
 
On August 29, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel
informed that he would provide his signature once the Settlement Agreement was
revised to include language on Roderex’s preferred payment method. (Hawatmeh
Decl. ¶ 7.) On September 4, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel informed Defendants
that their office was experiencing difficulties in contacting their client for
signature. (Id.) Plaintiff continues to refuse to sign the Settlement
Agreement. (Hawatmeh Decl. ¶ 8.)
 
Discussion
 
Traditionally,
C.C.P. § 664.6 was interpreted to require a signature by both the party seeking
to enforce a written settlement agreement and the party against whom
enforcement is sought. (Harris v. Rudin, Richman & Appel (1999)74
Cal.App.4th 299, 305.) As explained in Greisman v. FCA US, LLC (2024)
103 Cal.App.5th 1310, C.C.P. § 644.6 was amended in January 2021. The January
2021 revision clarified that, “For purposes of this section, a writing is
signed by a party if it is signed by any of the following: [¶] (1) The party.
[¶] (2) An attorney who represents the party.” (Id. citing Stats. 2020,
ch. 290, § 1.) The Greisman court explained that the 2021 revision was
done with the explicit purpose of clarifying the legislative intended the word “parties”
in the statute to extend to attorney representative. (Id. at 192.) 
 
Although
it is now conclusive that a writing by attorney representatives can be used to
enforce a settlement agreement under C.C.P. § 664.6, what constitutes a
sufficient writing for this purpose remains variable. In an era where most
communication in the course of a litigation is conducted via email, courts have
been forced to weigh in on when an email confirmation of settlement suffices. The
Court finds the cases of J.B.B. Investment Partners, Ltd. v. Fair (2014)
232 Cal.App.4th 974 (J.B.B. 2014) and J.B.B. Investment Partners Ltd.
v. Fair (2019) 37 Cal.App.5th 1 (J.B.B. 2019) to be
instructive.  
 
In J.B.B.
2014, an investor moved to enforce a settlement agreement between various
LLCs and their founding member, Fair. (J.B.B. 2014 supra, 232
Cal.App.4th at 977.) In ruling that the settlement was enforceable, the trial court
found that an email exchange between Fair and counsel for Plaintiff’s
constituted a signed agreement under C.C.P. § 664.6 (Id. at 982.) The
Court of Appeal reversed, holing that for an electronic signature to satisfy
the § 664.6 requirement that the agreement be signed by the parties, there must
be evidence that the parties agreed to conduct a transaction by electronic
means and that the signing party intended with his or her printed name to sign
the electronic record, in accordance with California Uniform Electronic
Transactions Act (UTEA; Civ Code § 1633.1 et seq.). (Id. at
988-990.) The Court of Appeal determined that the trial court lacked
substantial evidence that Fair intended his email sign-off to be a signature
under the UETA. (Id.) Simply printing ones name at the end of an email
was not sufficient to create a settlement agreement enforceable under C.C.P. §
664.6. (Id. at 989.) 
 
J.B.B. 2019 concerned the same
parties as J.B.B. 2014, though this time the attempt to enforce the
settlement was not made pursuant to C.C.P. § 664.6. Instead, the LLC’s sought
to enforce the settlement agreement through the traditional method of bringing
an independent lawsuit for the enforcement of contract. (J.B.B. 2019 supra,
37 Cal.App.5th at 7.) In making its ruling, the Court of Appeal was clear that
this procedural difference allowed for the more liberal application of general
contract principles. The court rejected Fair’s argument that J.B.B. 2014 already
found his intent to form binding agreement was lacking. (Id. at 13.) The
court clarified that J.B.B. 2014 did not preclude the court from
considering whether Fair’s emails signaled an intent to enter into a binding
agreement under general contract law. (Id.) The court noted specifically
that J.B.B. 2014 expressed “no opinion as to whether plaintiffs can
enforce the July 4 offer by another method, such as a motion for summary
judgment for breach of contract.” (J.B.B. 2014 supra at 991.) 
 
Here,
it is not clear whether the July 24, 2024 email of Plaintiff’s counsel is
accompanied by an electronic signature. (Hawatmeh Decl. Exh. 1, p. 10.) The
email of Plaintiff’s counsel contains the usual attorney signoff including her
email address, telephone/fax numbers, website, and street address. (Id.)
This information is surrounded by a series of three images which apparently
could not be displayed when Defendants’ counsel went to copy the communication.
Without a copy of the email that shows this signature, the Court is reticent to
find the email is a signed writing for purposes of C.C.P. § 664.6. 
 
If a
signature is shown, the Court finds there is sufficient evidence that Plaintiff’s
counsel intended to enter into a binding agreement on his behalf. The July 24,
2024 email of Plaintiff’s counsel is a direct reply to the request of the
mediator to confirm the parties had reached a settlement. In this context, the
only feasible explanation for Plaintiff’s counsel replying “Agreed.” would be
to confirm the settlement. Further, Plaintiff’s counsel appears to also be
agreeing that the email chain serves as a writing for purposes of this motion. 
 
Given
the foregoing, the Court requests argument for the purpose of presenting a
clear copy of this email exchange. In the event Defendants can sufficiently
demonstrate an electronic signature, the Court is inclined to grant the motion.
Should Defendants be unable to show an electronic signature at the time of the
hearing, the Court is inclined to deny the motion without prejudice.

In the
event the parties submit on this tentative ruling, or a party requests a signed
order or the court in its discretion elects to sign a formal order, the
following form will be either electronically signed or signed in hard copy and
entered into the court’s records.
