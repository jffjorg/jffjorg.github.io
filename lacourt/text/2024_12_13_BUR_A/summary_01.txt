And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is requesting oral argument on this matter to determine whether the July 24, 2024 email from Plaintiff's counsel is accompanied by an electronic signature. The judge notes that the email exchange appears to constitute a signed agreement under C.C.P. § 664.6, but is reticent to find that the email is a signed writing without a clear copy of the email exchange. The judge is inclined to grant the motion to enforce the settlement agreement if an electronic signature is demonstrated, and is inclined to deny the motion without prejudice if an electronic signature is not shown. The judge requests that the parties submit on this tentative ruling or request a signed order.
