And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to compel the deposition of Defendant's Person Most Knowledgeable (PMK). The motion is denied without prejudice due to Plaintiffs' failure to meet and confer in good faith. The judge finds that Plaintiffs did not make a reasonable and good faith attempt to resolve the issue prior to bringing the motion. The judge notes that Plaintiffs unilaterally noticed the deposition without waiting for Defendant's response and did not begin the meet and confer process until nearly a month after the missed deposition date. The judge also finds that Plaintiffs did not discuss Defendant's objections in their initial meet and confer letter, which may be due to the fact that Defendant had not yet served its objections. The judge orders the parties to further meet and confer regarding the deposition and invites Plaintiffs to refile their motion if they are still unable to take the deposition after these efforts.
