```

And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied the motion to compel further responses in this case without prejudice. The Judge found that the Plaintiffs' counsel did not make a good faith effort to meet and confer with the Defendant's counsel to resolve the discovery disputes. The Judge noted that the Plaintiffs' counsel was inflexible in their refusal to grant extensions of time to respond and that their tone and content in their communication with the Defendant's counsel was adversarial. The Judge encouraged the parties to renew their meet and confer efforts in earnest and reach an informal resolution. If the Plaintiffs continue to experience issues in receiving sufficient responses after renewed meet and confer, the Court invites them to refile their motion.
