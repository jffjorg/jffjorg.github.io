Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court is considering a motion by the plaintiffs to compel Ford Motor Company to respond to their request for production of documents. The plaintiffs allege that Ford sold them a defective vehicle and refused to repurchase it, in violation of the Song-Beverly Act. Ford argues that it has already responded to the discovery request, but the court finds that the responses are insufficient because they are unverified. The court grants the motion to compel responses to discovery, ordering Ford to provide verified responses without objection. The court also notes that Ford has not moved for relief from its waiver of objections and has not demonstrated that it is entitled to such relief. The court elects not to assess sanctions, as the plaintiffs did not request them in connection with the motion.
