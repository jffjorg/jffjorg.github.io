And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge Gary Y. Tanaka in the case of Maria Fernanda Bueno Roldan et al. v. Swift Transportation Co. of Arizona, Inc. et al. (Case No. 23TRCV00354). The case involves a negligent act by Kevin Sullivan, an employee of Swift Transportation Co. of Arizona, Inc., which caused a food pallet to fall onto the Plaintiff on January 11, 2023.

The Defendant has moved for a protective order to prevent the Plaintiff from taking certain depositions and obtaining certain documents. The Plaintiff has also sought to quash deposition subpoenas issued to Target Corporation and Kmart Corporation for the employment records of Kevin Sullivan.

The Court has denied the Defendant's motion for protective order, finding that the Plaintiff has not alleged both negligence and negligent entrustment. However, the Court has granted the Defendant's motions to quash the deposition subpoenas, finding that the subpoenas seek a broad range of documents that would essentially consist of the entirety of the personnel records of Defendant Sullivan from two of his past employers.

The Court has also found that the Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate that the need for the discovery outweighs the privacy interest of Defendant Sullivan. The subpoenas seek a broad range of documents, including confidential personnel files, which would essentially consist of the entirety of the personnel records of Defendant Sullivan from two of his past employers.
