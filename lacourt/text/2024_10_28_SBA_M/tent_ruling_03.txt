Requests for Admissions, Set One, and Request for Sanctions    
 
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
            Uber Technologies, Inc.’s Motion to
Deem Admitted Requests for Admissions, Set One, and Request for Sanctions is granted.

 
Background
 
Plaintiff filed the Complaint on March 13, 2023. Plaintiff
alleges the following facts. Plaintiff was involved in an auto accident. 
 
Motion to
Deem Admitted
 
Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280 states:
“If a party to whom requests for admission are
directed fails to serve a timely response, the following rules apply:
(a) The party to whom the requests for admission are
directed waives any objection to the requests, including one based on privilege
or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section
2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that party from this waiver on its
determination that both of the following conditions are satisfied:
(1) The party has subsequently served a response that
is in substantial compliance with Sections 2033.210, 2033.220, and 2033.230.
(2) The party's failure to serve a timely response was
the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.
(b) The requesting party may move for an order that
the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the
requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010).
(c) The court shall make this order, unless it finds
that the party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has
served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests
for admission that is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220. It is
mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing
with Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to
serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion.”
