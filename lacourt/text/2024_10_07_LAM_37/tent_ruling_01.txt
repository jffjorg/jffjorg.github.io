Background
 
On
June 27, 2022, Danny Silberstein (“Plaintiff”), filed a Complaint against MM
Products, Inc. (“Defendant”) and Does 1 to 50.) 
 
On
July 3, 2023, Plaintiff filed the operative First Amended Complaint (“FAC”)
alleging a single cause of action for strict product liability. 
 
On
July 24, 2024, Defendant moved for summary adjudication as to Plaintiff’s
request for punitive damages. Plaintiff opposes the Motion. The matter is now
before the court. 
 
Evidentiary
Objections  
 
Plaintiff’s Objection to the
Declaration of Hannah Lapidus:
 
Plaintiff objects to the entire
Declaration of Hannah Lapidus on the basis that the declaration lacks
facts to show the declarant has personal knowledge, the declarant fails to lay
a foundation for the exhibits presented, and the declarant fails to show that
the exhibits presented are not hearsay. 
 
For the reasons outlined below,
Plaintiff’s objection is sustained. 
 
Defendant’s Objection to the
Declaration of Barry Novack: 
 
Objections Nos. 1 to 16 are
overruled as the evidence is probative of Hanna
Lapidus’ personal knowledge and is based on facts state by her in her
deposition. (Plaintiff’s Compendium of Evidence (“PCOE”) Ex. 20.) 
 
Objection No. 17 is
overruled as it is not in proper form and is an objection to a voluminous
number of exhibits (Ex. 1-20) based on the same boilerplate objection. (See
Vineyard Springs Estates v. Superior Court (2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 633, 642;
Reid v. Google, Inc. (2010) 50 Cal.4th 512, 532; see also CRC, rule
3.1354). 
 
motion for
summary judgment
 
I.         Legal Standard
 
The purpose of a motion for summary judgment or summary
adjudication “is to provide courts with a mechanism to cut through the parties’
pleadings in order to determine whether, despite their allegations, trial is in
fact necessary to resolve their dispute.”¿(Aguilar v. Atl. Richfield Co.
(2001) 25 Cal. 4th 826, 843.) “Code of Civil Procedure section 437c,
subdivision (c), requires the trial judge to grant summary judgment if all the
evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence’
and uncontradicted by other inferences or evidence, show that there is no
triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to
judgment as a matter of law.” (Adler v. Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7
Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.) Summary adjudication may be granted as to one or more
causes of action within an action, or one or more claims for damages. (CCP, §
437c(f).)¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
A defendant moving for summary judgment bears two burdens:
(1) the burden of production – presenting admissible evidence, through material
facts, sufficient to satisfy a directed verdict standard; and (2) the burden of
persuasion – the material facts presented must persuade the court that the
plaintiff cannot establish one or more elements of a cause of action, or a
complete defense vitiates the cause of action. (CCP, § 437c(p)(2);¿Aguilar,¿supra,
25 Cal.4th at p. 850-851.) A defendant may satisfy this burden by showing that
the claim “cannot be established” because of the lack of evidence on some
essential element of the claim.¿¿(Union Bank v. Superior Court (1995) 31
Cal.App.4th 574, 590.)¿¿Once the defendant meets this burden, the burden shifts
to the plaintiff to show that a “triable issue of one or more material facts
exists as to that cause of action or defense thereto.”¿(Ibid.)¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
“On ruling on a motion for summary judgment, the court is
to ‘liberally construe the evidence in support of the party opposing summary
judgment and resolve doubts concerning the evidence in favor of that party.’” (Cheal
v. El Camino Hospital¿(2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 736, 760.) On a summary
judgment motion, the court must therefore consider what inferences favoring the
opposing party a factfinder could reasonably draw from the evidence. While
viewing the evidence in this manner, the court must bear in mind that its
primary function is to identify issues rather than to determine issues.
[Citation.]” (Binder v. Aetna Life Ins. Co.¿(1999) 75 Cal.App.
4th 832, 839.)¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
Defeating summary judgment requires only a single disputed
material fact. (See CCP, § 437c(c) [a motion for summary judgment “shall be
granted if all the papers submitted show that there is no triable issue as to any
material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a
matter of law”] [italics added].) Thus, any disputed material fact means the
court must deny the motion – the court has no discretion to grant summary
judgment. (Zavala v. Arce (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 915, 925, fn. 8; Saldana
v. Globe-Weis Systems Co. (1991) 233 Cal.App.3d 1505, 1511-1512.)¿¿¿¿¿ 
 
            II.        Discussion
 
Plaintiff alleges that he was
gifted a JoyJolt Declan glass 16 oz Coffee Mug (the “Mug”), designed,
manufactured, and sold by Defendant. (FAC., ¶¶ 6-9.) On or about January 2,
2022, Plaintiff suffered serious burns or laceration injuries when the base of
the Mug fell off. (Id., ¶¶ 3, 10.) 
 
The FAC asserts that Defendants
“received over 400 notifications from consumers about glass failures, including
over 350 complaints that the base of the mugs was failing allowing hot liquids
to spill on to the users or otherwise causing injury.” (FAC, ¶ 9.) Plaintiff
alleges that the sodalime glass used on the Mug was suitable for cold beverages
but not hot beverages, like coffee and tea, because soda lime is unable to
withstand “terminal shock” associated with the temperature change from hot to
cold liquid. (Id., ¶ 8.) Despite knowing of the Mug’s failure and the
danger that it posed, Defendants continued to sell the product, and
subsequently redesigned the product to better withstand “internal stresses
associated with hot liquid” but failed to recall or provide a warning for the Mug.
(Id., ¶¶ 9, 11.) 
 
Plaintiff filed this action
alleging a single cause for strict product liability and requesting punitive
damages. Defendant now moves for summary adjudication on the issue of punitive
damages. 
 
A.        Inadequacy of Defendants’ Evidence 
 
Apart from the
deposition testimony of the Defendants, a significant portion of
Defendants Evidence is Pre-Shipment Inspection (“PSI”) reports, consumer
complaints, and an Amazon listing product warning introduced by way of the
Declaration of Hanna Lapidus. Lapidus states that she began working for
Defendant in 2017, but fails to state what her position was and whether that
position provided her with access to PSI reports and consumer complaints such
that she could authenticate these exhibits. Plaintiffs present evidence that
Lapidus worked as a bookkeeper for her first three years of employment.
(Lapidus Decl., ¶ 1; Plaintiff’s Compendium of Evidence (“PCOE”), Ex. 20
[Lapidus Depo. at p. 18:2-19].) 
 
Lapidus states that
she worked as the Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) for Defendant from 2021 to
2023, and presently works as the Director of Human Resources and Compliance.
(Lapidus Decl., ¶ 1.) Lapidus asserts she gained personal knowledge of the
exhibits in her declarant “by virtue of my participation in the events
described herein, my preparation or review of the documents described herein,
or some combination of the foregoing as identified herein.” (Ibid.)
Lapidus fails to state that prior to 2021, her position as bookkeeper gave her
familiarity with the PSIs and consumer complaints. Lapidus fails to state that
as CFO she was aware and familiar with the PSIs and consumer complaints due to
her job duties. Lapidus also fails to state that in preparation for this
Motion, she reviewed the PSIs and consumer complaints to become familiar with
them. 
 
“The same rules of
evidence that apply at trial also apply to the declarations submitted in
support of and in opposition to motions for summary judgment. Declarations must
show the declarant's personal knowledge and competency to testify, state facts
and not just conclusions, and not include inadmissible hearsay or opinion.” (Bozzi
v. Nordstrom, Inc. (2010) 186 Cal.App.4th 755, 761.) Most importantly,
Lapidus fails to provide a foundation to show that the PSI, consumer
complaints, and Amazon listing are admissible as business records kept in the
regular course of business. (Evid. Code, § 1271.) Accordingly, most of the
exhibits in Lapidus’ declaration are inadmissible. 
 
Even if Lapidus’
declaration had laid a proper foundation and the exhibits were admissible,
Defendants’ evidence fails to show that Defendant was diligent in making the
product safe for users. Lapidus seeks to introduce PSIs to show that prior to
shipment, the Declan Mugs passed the PSIs thermal shock test. However, Defendant’s
evidence shows that after each inspection test, Defendant continued to receive
consumer complaints. 
 
Despite the Declan
Mugs passing the thermal shock test (PSI of March, 16, 2020) in June 2020,
Defendant receive two notifications that the product had failed. (Lapidus
Decl., ¶¶ 8, 9, Ex. 6, 7.)  In August or
September 2020, Defendant moved manufacturing of the Declan Mugs to a new
factory, Factory B.  Lapidus states that
Factory B represented to Defendants that it used a higher quality soda lime glass
mixture. (Lapidus Decl., ¶ 11.) During this time, Defendant also added a
warning on the Declan Mug’s Amazon.com listing by “instructing users of the
product to wait approximately 3 minutes in between putting hot and cold liquids
in the product.” (Id., 14, Ex. 10.) 
 
On September 21,
2020, the Declan Mug manufactured in Factory B passed the thermal shock test,
but Defendants nevertheless received 3 additional consumer complaints. (Lapidus
Decl., ¶¶ 15, 15, Ex. 11, 12.) On October 5, 2020, the Declan Mugs passed the thermal
shock test, but between November 2020 and March 2021, Defendant received 13
additional consumer complaints about the Declan Mug’s base failing off during
use. (Id., ¶¶ 17, 18, Ex. 13, 24.) 
 
Defendants assert
that on March 19, 2019, and March 29, 2021, the Declan Mugs passed the thermal
shock test again, but Defendants did not receive “any direct consumer
complaints” between April 2021, and August 30, 2021. (Lapidus Decl., ¶¶ 19,
20,  21, Ex. 15, 16 [italics added].) On
July 29, 2021, the Declan Mugs passed the thermal shock test again but between
August 31, 2021, and March 26, 2022, Defendant received an additional 23
consumer complaints about the product. (Id., ¶¶ 23, 24, Ex. 18, 19.) 
 
Lapidus asserts
that in the first or second quarter of 2022, Defendant moved to another manufacturer,
Factory C, and “completely redesigned the coffee mugs” by “adding approximately
8% to 9% boric oxide (borosilicate) to the glass materials mixture coming out
of Factory C, increasing the thickness of the mug” “in an effort to make the
JoyJolt Coffee Mugs stronger and more heat resistant.” (Lapidus Decl., ¶¶ 25,
26.) Defendants also chose to discontinue the sale and manufacturing of
the Declan Mugs as it awaited the new mug orders from Factory C. (Id.,
¶ 27.) 
 
Because Defendant
conducted PSIs does not mean that the product was safe for consumer use, as
Defendant continued to receive consumer complaints despite passing each
inspection. Even if Defendants did not know why the Declan Mugs were failing,
Defendants did know the product was failing when used with hot liquids, yet the
formula for the product remained largely unchanged. Moreover, Defendants fail
to show that the thermal shock test of the PSI was sufficiently rigorous
enough to identify defects and considered that the product would experience
thermal shock repeatedly due to repeat use. 
 
According to
Lapidus, the PSI thermal test while the Declan Mug was manufactured by Company
B consisted of filling the mug with “boiling water for one minute, emptied, and
then filled with cold water, and a washing test whereby the product is washed
in warm water (20-35 degrees celsius) and hot water (80-90 degrees celsius).”
(Lapidus Decl., ¶ 23.) When the Declan Mug was redesigned and manufactured by
Company C, the mug was tested at more extreme temperature by  placing the mug “in a cold closet (7 degrees
Celcius) for 60 minutes, then covered with hot water (100 degrees Celcius).” (Id.,
¶ 28.) 
 
Despite adding a
warning to the Declan Mug’s Amazon listing in August or September 2020,
Defendant admits it continued to receive complaints about the base of the mug
separating from the body of the mug during use. (Lapidus Decl., ¶ 25.) It would
not be until 2022 that Defendant took action to redesign the Mug and move to a
different manufacturer. (Id., ¶¶ 25, 26.) Accordingly, there are triable
issues of fact as to the adequacy of the Amazon listing warning and whether
Defendant acted with malice, fraud, or oppression in failing to take prompt
corrective action when it knew the Declan Mugs were defective during use with
hot liquids. 
 
Accordingly,
Defendant failed to meet its burden of showing that no triable issues of fact exist,
and that it is entitled to summary adjudication in its favor as a matter of
law. 
 
            B.        Plaintiff’s Shows That Triable Issues of Material Fact Exist
 
Plaintiff presents
evidence that although Defendant issued a warning on the Amazon listing for the
mug, no warning was provided in the box of the Declan Mugs. (PCOE Ex. 12
[Mittelman Depo. Vol. 1 at pp. 43:20-44:9.) In providing a warning on the
listing, but not in the product itself, users like Plaintiff who were gifted
the Declan Mug had no warning about the Mug. Moreover, Defendant fails to show
that the warning on the Amazon listing was sufficient to prevent injury given
the fact that Defendant continued to receive consumer complaints about the
Declan Mugs even after the warning was provided. 
 
Secondly, Plaintiff
presents evidence that Defendant’s CEO, Mordechai Mittelman (“Mittleman”)
consciously made the decision not to issue a product recall or provide a
general warning on the mug’s box. (PCOE, Ex. 6 [Mittelman Depo. Vol. 2 at p.
136:13-21]; Ex. 13.) Plaintiff also provide evidence that Defendant’s CEO,
Mittelmen” knew for years that borosilicate glass can withstand more thermal
shock than soda lime glass. (PCOE Ex. 7 [Mittelman Decl. Vol. 2 at pp.
172:20-173:3.) Yet Defendant waited until 2022 to redesign the Declan Mugs to
be more thermal shock resistant. (Ex. 11 [Mittelman Depo. Vol. 1 at pp.
35:23-26:4], [Bobi Mizimakoski Depo. at pp. 45:20-46:11].) 
 
For the reasons set
forth above, the court agrees that the trier of fact could find that despite
Defendants’ knowledge of the Declan Mug’s bottom failure when used with hot
liquids, Defendant acted with malice or oppression by consciously disregarding
the safety of its customer’ and end users of its product by failing to provide
an adequate warning and failing to recall the product. (Civ Code, § 3294.)
Moreover, the trier of fact could find that Defendant’s conduct was
perpetrated, authorized, or knowingly ratified by Defendant’s CEO, Mordechai
Mittelman. (Civ. Code, § 3294(b).) 
 
As triable issues
of fact exist, summary adjudication as to the Plaintiff’s request for
punitive damages is denied. 
 
Conclusion
 Defendant’s motion for summary
adjudication is denied.
