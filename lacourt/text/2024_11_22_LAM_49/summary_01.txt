  - "The purpose of [promissory estoppel] is to make a promise binding, under certain circumstances, without consideration in the usual sense of something bargained for and given in exchange."

Summary:
The judge has issued a tentative ruling on KeyBank's demurrer to the complaint. The judge has overruled KeyBank's demurrer to each of the four causes of action, including promissory estoppel, unjust enrichment, negligent misrepresentation, and interference with contract. The judge finds that the allegations in the complaint are sufficient to state a claim for each of these causes of action. The judge notes that KeyBank's demurrer relies on the fact that the Term Sheet and Swap Lock Agreement contained disclaimers, but finds that these disclaimers do not necessarily mean that KeyBank did not make a clear and unambiguous promise to provide financing. The judge also finds that the allegations of reasonable reliance on KeyBank's representations are sufficient to state a claim for negligent misrepresentation and interference with contract.
