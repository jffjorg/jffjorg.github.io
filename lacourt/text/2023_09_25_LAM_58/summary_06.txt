## English Summary:

This tentative ruling addresses two motions filed by Defendant Farmers Group, Inc. (FGI) seeking to recover costs from Plaintiffs M.L. Enterprise Textiles, LLC (ML) and Rotax, Inc. (Rotax).  Both Plaintiffs originally sued various insurance companies and their agents, alleging they were harmed by the procurement of the wrong insurance policy.

After filing motions for summary judgment against both Plaintiffs, FGI was dismissed from the case by both Plaintiffs.  FGI then filed a memorandum of costs in both cases.  Because no opposition was filed to these motions, they are granted.  The judge found that FGI qualifies as the "prevailing party" and is therefore entitled to recover costs as a matter of law.
