## English Text Summary

The judge has ruled that the settlement between Sara Cronstedt (Plaintiff) and Gray and White Law Firm and Mark Gray (Gray Defendants) is in good faith. 

Cronstedt is suing both Gray Defendants and McNulty Law Firm and Peter McNulty (McNulty Defendants) for legal malpractice stemming from a hot air balloon accident in 2016. 

The Gray Defendants argued that their liability is limited by statute of limitations defenses and that their $55,000 settlement offer accurately reflects their proportionate responsibility.

The McNulty Defendants argued that the settlement was too low and that Cronstedt's $1,000,000 demand against them justifies a higher settlement from the Gray Defendants. 

However, the judge found that the Gray Defendants had sufficiently demonstrated their limited liability and that the settlement amount was reasonable. The judge also rejected the McNulty Defendants' request for more discovery, finding no evidence of bad faith in the settlement.

  - name: The Court finds that the settlement was made in good faith.

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the Motion for Determination of Good Faith Settlement filed by the Gray Defendants in a legal malpractice action. Plaintiff Sara Cronstedt has settled with the Gray Defendants and seeks a determination of good faith settlement by the Court. The case involves Plaintiff's allegations of professional negligence by the Jones Law Firm in a hot air balloon accident case. The Plaintiff alleges that the Jones Law Firm engaged in professional negligence in its representation of her in the Balloon Action and that Defendants incorrectly told her that she had until December 4, 2017 to bring her malpractice case against the Jones Law Firm. The Plaintiff also alleges other breaches of the standard of care in Defendants’ handling of both the Jones Malpractice Action and the Balloon Action. The Gray Defendants have agreed to pay $55,000 to the Plaintiff in exchange for a full settlement and release of all claims against them, subject to the Court's approval of the Motion for Good Faith Settlement. The McNulty Defendants oppose the motion. The Judge's ruling is based on the legal standard that a determination by the court that the settlement was made in good faith shall bar any other joint tortfeasor or co-obligor from any further claims for equitable comparative contribution, or partial or comparative indemnity, based on comparative negligence or comparative fault. The Judge finds that the settlement was made in good faith based on the factors provided in Tech-Bilt, Inc. v. Woodward-Clyde & Associates (1985) 38 Cal.3d 488.
