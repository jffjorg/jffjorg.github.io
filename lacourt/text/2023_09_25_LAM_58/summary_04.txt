## English Text Summary

The judge has ruled that the settlement between Sara Cronstedt (Plaintiff) and Gray and White Law Firm and Mark Gray (Gray Defendants) is in good faith. 

Cronstedt is suing both Gray Defendants and McNulty Law Firm and Peter McNulty (McNulty Defendants) for legal malpractice stemming from a hot air balloon accident in 2016. 

The Gray Defendants argued that their liability is limited by statute of limitations defenses and that their $55,000 settlement offer accurately reflects their proportionate responsibility.

The McNulty Defendants argued that the settlement was too low and that Cronstedt's $1,000,000 demand against them justifies a higher settlement from the Gray Defendants. 

However, the judge found that the Gray Defendants had sufficiently demonstrated their limited liability and that the settlement amount was reasonable. The judge also rejected the McNulty Defendants' request for more discovery, finding no evidence of bad faith in the settlement.

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the Motion for Determination of Good Faith Settlement filed by the Gray Defendants in a legal malpractice action. Plaintiff Sara Cronstedt has settled with the Gray Defendants and seeks a determination of good faith settlement by the Court. The case involves Plaintiff's allegations of professional negligence by the Jones Law Firm in a hot air balloon accident case. The Plaintiff alleges that the Jones Law Firm engaged in professional negligence in its representation of her in the Balloon Action and that Defendants incorrectly told her that she had until December 4, 2017 to bring her malpractice case against the Jones Law Firm. The Plaintiff also alleges other breaches of the standard of care in Defendants’ handling of both the Jones Malpractice Action and the Balloon Action. The Gray Defendants have agreed to pay $55,000 to the Plaintiff in exchange for a full settlement and release of all claims against them, subject to the Court's approval of the Motion for Good Faith Settlement. The McNulty Defendants oppose the motion. The Judge's ruling is based on the legal standard that a determination by the court that the settlement was made in good faith shall bar any other joint tortfeasor or co-obligor from any further claims for equitable comparative contribution, or partial or comparative indemnity, based on comparative negligence or comparative fault. The Judge finds that the settlement was made in good faith based on the factors provided in Tech-Bilt, Inc. v. Woodward-Clyde & Associates (1985) 38 Cal.3d 488.

## English Summary:


This legal document is a tentative ruling by a judge in a case about legal malpractice.  

The plaintiff, Sara Cronstedt, had previously sued both the Jones Law Firm (for malpractice) and the Gray and White Law Firm and Mark Gray (for related malpractice and mishandling of her Balloon Action settlement). She has now settled with Gray and White and Mark Gray, and they are asking the court to declare the settlement "in good faith."

The McNulty Law Firm and Peter McNulty, who are also being sued by Cronstedt, argue that the settlement with Gray and White is not in good faith because it is significantly lower than what Cronstedt demanded from them.  However, the judge concludes that the Gray and White settlement is reasonable considering the legal defenses they have against Cronstedt's claims and the lack of evidence that Cronstedt's claims against McNulty are actually worth $1,000,000.  


Therefore, the judge grants the motion for a good faith settlement, meaning that Gray and White Law Firm and Mark Gray will not be responsible for any further claims from Cronstedt related to this settlement.

In this tentative ruling, the Judge grants the Motion for Determination of Good Faith Settlement filed by the Gray Defendants. The Judge finds that the settlement was made in good faith, as the amount of the settlement is within the reasonable range of the settling tortfeasor's proportional share of comparative liability for the plaintiff's injuries. The Judge notes that the burden of proof is on the party asserting the lack of good faith, and in this case, the opposing party has not met this burden. The Judge also notes that the settlement amount reflects a rough approximation of the plaintiff's total recovery and the settling defendant's proportionate liability. Additionally, there is no evidence of collusion, fraud, or tortious conduct in connection with the settlement agreement. The Judge declines the opposing party's request for continuance to allow for additional discovery, as they submit no evidence of bad faith.
