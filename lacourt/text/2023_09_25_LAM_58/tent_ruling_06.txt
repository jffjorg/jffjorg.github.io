This is an
action for breach of contract and negligence against varous insurance companies
and their agents for procuring the wrong policy.  The plaintiffs – originally -- were M.L.
Enterprise, LLC (M.L.), the warehouse owner, and Rotax, Inc. (Rotax), the
tenant whose merchandise was allegedly destroyed during a fire.    
 
On August 25,
2023, Defendant Farmers Group, Inc. (FGI) moved for an order that judgment be
entered in its favor and against Plaintiff M.L. Enterprise Textiles, LLC
(Plaintiff ML), and awarding Defendant FGI costs pursuant to memorandum of
costs. No opposition was filed. 
 
On August 28,
2023, Defendant FGI also moved for an order that judgment be entered in its
favor and against Plaintiff Rotax, Inc. (Plaintiff Rotax) awarding Defendant
FGI costs pursuant to memorandum of costs. No opposition was filed. 
 
Both motions
are granted in the amount requested. 
 
Legal Standard
 
            The “prevailing party” is
entitled to recover costs for suit in any action or proceeding. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1032, subd. (b); Santisas v. Goodin (1998) 17 Cal.4th 599,
606.) “Prevailing party” includes the party with a net monetary recovery, a
defendant in whose favor a dismissal is entered, a defendant where neither
plaintiff nor defendant obtains any relief, and a defendant as against those
plaintiffs who do not recover any relief against that defendant. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1032, subd. (a)(4).)
 
            Recoverable costs “shall
be reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation rather than merely
convenient or beneficial to its preparation.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd.
(c)(2).) “If the items appearing in a cost bill appear to be proper charges,
the burden is on the party seeking to tax costs to show that they were not
reasonable or necessary.” (Ladas v. California State Auto. Assn. (1993)
19 Cal.App.4th 761, 774.) Verification of the memorandum of costs by the
prevailing party’s attorney establishes a prima facie showing that the claimed
costs are proper.¿(See Jones v. Dumrichob (1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 1258,
1267 [“There is no requirement that copies of bills, invoices, statements, or
any other such documents be attached to the memorandum.”].) 
 
Discussion 
 
(1.)  Defendant FGI’s Motion against Plaintiff ML:
 
            Defendant
FGI seeks entry of judgment and costs against Plaintiff ML in the amount of $7,522.68.
 
            On January
12, 2022, Plaintiff ML filed and served its First Amended Complaint (FAC) in
the consolidated case (21STCV20307). (Brenner Dec., ¶ 3.) On November 16, 2022,
Defendant FGI filed and served its Motion for Summary Judgment as to the FAC. (Brenner
Decl., ¶ 7.) On January 17, 2023, Plaintiff ML served a request for dismissal
of Defendant FGI. Defendant FGI was dismissed on January 18, 2023. (Brenner Decl.,
¶ 8).[1]

 
            On March 6,
2023, Defendant FGI filed and served a memorandum of costs in the amount of $7,522.68.
No motion to strike or tax the costs was filed.
 
             To
object to a memorandum of costs, the objecting party must file a motion to
strike or tax costs as set forth in California Rules of Court, rule 3.1700(b). Rule
3.1700(b) specifically requires a notice
of motion to strike or tax costs to be filed
15 days after service of the cost memorandum. 
 
Failure to file a timely motion to
tax costs resulted in a forfeiture of the right to object to those costs. (Jimenez
v. City of Oxnard (1982) 134 Cal.App.3d 856, 859 [waiver by failing to file
motion to tax costs on time]; Santos v. Civil Service Bd. (1987) 193
Cal.App.3d 1442, 1447 [waiver where plaintiff “failed to file an objection to the
cost bill by filing a timely motion to tax costs” as required]; Douglas v.
Willis (1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 287, 289-290 [failure to file motion to tax
costs constitutes waiver].)
 
            Defendant
FGI’s unopposed motion is granted in the amount requested. 
 
(2.)  Defendant FGI’s Motion against Plaintiff
Rotax:     
            
            Defendant
FGI also seeks entry of judgment and costs against Plaintiff Rotax in the

On
January 12, 2021, Plaintiff Rotax filed and served its Second Amended Complaint
(SAC) in this action (20STCV10768). (Brenner Decl., ¶ 5). On November 17, 2022,
