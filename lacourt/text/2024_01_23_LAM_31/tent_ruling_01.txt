guardian ad litem for Elijah Van Clark, a minor v. Rowland Unified School
District
 
CASE NO.:                 19PSCP00106
 





















 
MOTION
FOR RECONSIDERATION



 
MOVING PARTY:               Plaintiff
Ann Clark, as guardian ad litem for Elijah Van Clark
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     No opposition
 
 
            On September 11, 2023, Plaintiff filed an Expedited
Petition to Approve Compromise of Disputed Claim or Pending Action.  On September 19, 2023, the court reviewed the
Petition and found the gross settlement of $50,000 to be reasonable.  Plaintiff’s counsel requested $16,650 in
attorney fees, representing 33.3% of the gross recovery.  The court awarded only $12,500 in attorney
fees (or 25% of the gross settlement).  The
awarded percentage of 25% was corrected by the court’s October 23, 2023 order.
 
            On
November 3, 2023, Plaintiff filed this motion for reconsideration.  Plaintiff sought reconsideration of the
Court’s October 23, 2023 order awarding
plaintiff’s counsel the sum of $12,500 in
attorney fees.  The motion was heard on
December 6, 2023.  Judge Murillo issued an
order stating that the court would reconsider the October 23, 2023 order on its
own motion.  Further, the court granted
the motion for reconsideration to allow plaintiff’s counsel to submit a supplemental
declaration with proof of costs.
 
            On January
11, 2023, counsel filed a supplemental declaration.  The declaration attaches proof of payment for
deposition transcripts, billing for retaining expert Dr. Carole Lieberman, and a
time keeping record which itemizes all costs incurred for prosecuting this
matter.
 
            Upon review of the supplemental declaration and the attached
exhibits, the court finds counsel has provided support for an award of $16,650
in attorney fees.  Accordingly, the
motion for reconsideration is GRANTED. 
The Court awards plaintiff’s counsel the sum of $16,650 in attorney fees
for the prosecution of this action.


            Moving
party to give notice.
