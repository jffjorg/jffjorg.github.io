```

And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge is inclined to grant the motion for summary adjudication of the Plaintiff's claims under Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social Services. The Plaintiff has requested a continuance, citing the need to conduct the deposition of the City's person(s) most qualified. However, the declaration submitted by the Plaintiff's counsel is deficient, failing to identify any "facts essential to justify opposition to a motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication." The Judge has denied the request for continuance. The Judge also notes that the parties have not briefed their arguments by issue and will not address issue 4. Finally, the Judge suggests that the consideration of "varying circumstances in different areas" in the application of the Curfew Order would tend to show that the curfew was not content-neutral.
