Here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motions to compel Quik Tow's responses to discovery requests and to deem requests for admissions admitted against Quik Tow. The plaintiff had served Quik Tow with Form Interrogatories on June 19, 2023, but Quik Tow failed to provide responses. As a result, all objections to the discovery requests are waived. The judge has ordered Quik Tow to provide responses within 30 days of the order. The judge has also deemed the requests for admissions admitted against Quik Tow.

The judge has imposed sanctions against Quik Tow and its counsel in the amount of $1,310, consisting of two hours of plaintiff's counsel's hourly rate and $210 in filing fees. The sanctions are mandatory in the context of requests for admissions. The judge has also imposed sanctions against counsel, as they failed to meet their burden of showing that they did not counsel the discovery abuse.

The judge has ordered the moving party to give notice of the order, and the parties are required to comply with the order by the specified deadlines.
