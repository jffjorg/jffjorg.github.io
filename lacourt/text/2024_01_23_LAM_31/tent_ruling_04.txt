MOTIONS
TO COMPEL RESPONSES TO DISCOVERY 
 
MOTION
TO DEEM REQUESTS FOR ADMISSIONS ADMITTED



 
MOVING PARTY:               Plaintiff
Fermin Garcia
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     No opposition
 
 
I.          BACKGROUND
 
On September 26, 2022, Plaintiff, Fermin Garcia, filed this
action against Defendants, Quik Tow LLC (“Quik Tow”) and Ignacio Gonzalez, for wage
and hour violations.
 
On July 19, 2023, Plaintiff served Quik Tow with Form
Interrogatories—General, Set One, Special Interrogatories, Set Two, and Request
for Admissions Set, Two.  To date, Quik
Tow has not served responses.
 
On September 28 and September 29, 2023, Plaintiff filed these
motions to compel Quik Tow’s responses to the Form Interrogatories—General, Set
One, and Special Interrogatories, Set Two, and to deem the Requests for Admissions,
Set Two, admitted against Quik Tow.  Plaintiff
requests sanctions against Quik Tow and its counsel.
 
The motions are unopposed.[1]
 
II.        LEGAL
STANDARDS 
 
            If a party
to whom interrogatories are directed fails to serve a timely response, the
propounding party may move for an order to compel responses without
objections.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (b).)¿ If a party to whom
requests for admission are directed fails to serve a timely response, the
propounding party may move for an order that the truth of the matters specified
in the requests be deemed admitted. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).)¿
Failure to timely serve responses waives objections to the requests.¿ (Code
Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (a), 2033.280, subd. (a).)¿¿¿¿ ¿¿ 
 
Monetary
Sanctions¿¿ 
 
            Code of
Civil Procedure section 2023.030 is a general statute authorizing the Court to
impose discovery sanctions for “misuse of the discovery process,” which includes
(without limitation) a variety of conduct such as: making, without substantial
justification, an unmeritorious objection to discovery; making an evasive
response to discovery; and unsuccessfully and without substantial justification
making or opposing a motion to compel or limit discovery.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., §
2023.010.)¿¿¿ 
 
            If
sanctions are sought, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.040 requires that
the notice specify the identity of the person against whom sanctions are sought
and the type of sanction requested, that the motion be supported in the points
and authorities, and the facts be set forth in a declaration supporting the
amount of any monetary sanction.¿¿ 
 
            If the
court finds that a party has unsuccessfully made or opposed a motion to compel
responses to interrogatories or inspection demands, the court “shall impose a
monetary sanction . . . unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction
acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the
imposition of the sanction unjust.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (c),
2031.310, subd. (h).)¿¿¿  
 
Sanctions against counsel:¿ The court in Kwan
Software Engineering, Inc. v. Hennings (2020) 58 Cal.App.5th 57, 81 (Hennings)
noted that discovery sanctions against an attorney are governed by a different
standard than sanctions against a party:¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿ 
By the terms of the statute, a trial court under section
2023.030(a) may not impose monetary sanctions against a party’s attorney unless
the court finds that the attorney “advised” the party to engage in the conduct
resulting in sanctions. (§ 2023.030(a); Ghanooni v. Super Shuttle (1993)
20 Cal.App.4th 256, 261, 24 Cal.Rptr.2d 501.)¿ “Unlike monetary sanctions
against a party, which are based on the party's misuse of the discovery
process, monetary sanctions against the party's attorney require a finding the
‘attorney advis[ed] that conduct.’ ” (Ibid.) “It is not enough that the
attorney's actions were in some way improper.” (Corns v. Miller (1986)
181 Cal.App.3d 195, 200, 226 Cal.Rptr. 247 (Corns).) Because an
attorney's advice to a client is “peculiarly within [his or her] knowledge,”
the attorney has the burden of showing that he or she did not counsel discovery
abuse. (Ibid.) Accordingly, when a party seeking sanctions against an
attorney offers sufficient evidence of a misuse of the discovery process, the
burden shifts to the attorney to demonstrate that he or she did not recommend
that conduct. (Id. at pp. 200–201, 226 Cal.Rptr. 247; Ghanooni,
at p. 262, 24 Cal.Rptr.2d 501.)¿
 
III.       DISCUSSION
 
            Plaintiff properly served Quik Tow with the at-issue
discovery requests on June 19, 2023. 
Quick Tow has not provided responses. 
Therefore, all objections to the discovery requests are waived.¿ Moreover,
Plaintiff is entitled to an order deeming the Request for Admissions, Set Two,
admitted against Quik Tow. 
 
            Monetary
Sanctions
 
            Plaintiff
requests sanctions against Quik Tow and its counsel.  Given the Court has granted these motions,
sanctions are warranted.  Indeed, in the context of requests for
admissions, sanctions are mandatory.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd.
(c).)  Pursuant to Hennings, supra, imposition of monetary
sanctions against counsel is also proper unless counsel shows that he or she
did not counsel the discovery abuse.¿ (Hennings, 58 Cal.App.5th at p.
81.)¿ Defense counsel does not meet their burden.  Accordingly, sanctions
are imposed against Quik Tow and its attorney of record in the amount of $1,310,
consisting of two hours at plaintiff’s counsel hourly rate and $210 in filing
fees.
 
IV.       CONCLUSION
 
            The unopposed
motions to compel responses to Form Interrogatories—General, Set One, and
Special Interrogatories, Set Two, are GRANTED. 
Defendant Quik Tow LLC is ordered to provide responses within 30 days of
this order.  
 
            The
unopposed motion to deem admitted Request for Admissions, Set Two, is
GRANTED.  Plaintiff’s Request for Admissions, Set Two, are deemed admitted
against Quik Tow. 
 
            The request
for sanctions is GRANTED.  Defendant Quik
Tow LLC and its counsel are ordered to pay, jointly and severally, sanctions in
the sum of $1,310, to be paid to Plaintiff by and through his counsel within 30
days of this order.
 
Moving party to give notice.
