DEMURRER
WITHOUT MOTION TO STRIKE



 
MOVING PARTY:               Defendant
Jennifer O. Oh
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     Plaintiff Joanne
Pak
 
 
I.          FACTUAL AND
PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND
 
            This action arises from the alleged breach of an oral
contract. Plaintiff, Joanne Pak, a self-represented litigant, alleges that
between August 22, 2013 to February 6, 2020, she personally loaned the total
sum of $65,945.00 to Defendants, Jennifer O. Oh and Younhee Cho, so that
Defendants could purchase a house. In return, Defendants promised to repay
Plaintiff with interest by October 30, 2020 without any intention to repay the
loan. Defendants have not repaid the loan. 
 
            On November
22, 2022, Plaintiff filed a Complaint in pro per against Defendants for (1)
Financial Elder Abuse, (2) Breach of Contract, and (3) Money Had and Received
and Account Stated.  Promissory notes
written in Korean and dated 7/17/2022 and 8/22/2013, as well as personal checks
issued by Defendants to Plaintiff were attached as exhibits to the Complaint.
 
            On June 20,
2023, Defendant, Jennifer O. Oh, filed a demurrer to the Complaint.  The demurrer was heard on November 8,
2023.  The Court overruled the demurrer
to the First Cause of Action.  As to the Second
and Third Causes of Action, the Court sustained the demurrer on the basis that
the statute of limitations barred the claims. 
However, because Plaintiff had not yet filed an amended pleading, the
Court granted Plaintiff leave to amend.
 
            On November
16, 2023, Plaintiff filed the operative First Amended Complaint (FAC).  As before, the FAC alleges causes of action
for (1) Financial Elder Abuse, (2) Breach of Contract, and (3) Money Had and
Received and Account Stated.  A certified
translation of the 8/22/2013 promissory note is attached to the FAC.
 
            On December
6, 2023, Defendant filed this Demurrer to the Second and Third Causes of Action
in the FAC.  
 
            The
Demurrer is unopposed.[1]

 
II.        LEGAL STANDARD FOR DEMURRER  
 
A demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of the pleadings and
will be sustained only where the pleading is defective on its face.  (City
of Atascadero v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc. (1998) 68
Cal.App.4th 445, 459.)  “We treat the demurrer as admitting all material
facts properly pleaded but not contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact
or law.  We accept the factual allegations of the complaint as true and also consider
matters which may be judicially noticed.  [Citation.]”  (Mitchell
v. California Department of Public Health (2016) 1 Cal.App.5th 1000, 1007; Del
E. Webb Corp. v. Structural Materials Co. (1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 593, 604
[“the facts alleged in the pleading are deemed to be true, however improbable
they may be”].)  Allegations are to be liberally construed.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 452.)  In construing the allegations, the court is to give
effect to specific factual allegations that may modify or limit inconsistent
general or conclusory allegations.  (Financial Corporation of America
v. Wilburn (1987) 189 Cal.App.3rd 764, 769.)   
 
A demurrer may be brought if insufficient facts are stated
to support the cause of action asserted.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10,
subd. (e).)  “A demurrer for uncertainty is strictly construed, even where
a complaint is in some respects uncertain, because ambiguities can be clarified
under modern discovery procedures.”  (Khoury v. Maly’s of California,
Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.)   


Where the complaint contains substantial factual
allegations sufficiently apprising defendant of the issues it is being asked to
meet, a demurrer for uncertainty will be overruled or plaintiff will be given
leave to amend.  (Williams v. Beechnut Nutrition Corp. (1986) 185
Cal.App.3d 135, 139, fn. 2.)  Leave to amend must be allowed where there
is a reasonable possibility of successful amendment.  (Goodman v.
Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.)  The burden is on the complainant
to show the Court that a pleading can be amended successfully.  (Ibid.)  
 
III.      DISCUSSION
 
Meet and Confer 
 
Defense counsel has complied with the meet and confer
requirement.  (See Declaration of Dale J. Park, ¶ 3.)
 
Analysis
 
Defendant argues the
Second and Third Causes of Action of the FAC fail because they are barred by
the statute of limitations.  Given that
Defendant’s demurrer to the same causes of action in the original Complaint was
sustained on the same grounds, the Court compares the allegations of the FAC to
the original Complaint.  The Court notes
that the FAC now attaches a certified translation of a promissory note, dated
8/22/2013, originally written in Korean. 
There is no translation of the promissory note dated 7/17/2022.  The translation of the 8/22/2013 promissory
note indicates only that “On 08/22/2013, I, Younhee Cho borrowed $20,000.00
(twenty thousand) from Joanne park.”  As
in the original Complaint, the FAC does not set forth any allegations
explaining the significance of the 8/22/2013 promissory note.  Indeed, the FAC is  otherwise unchanged.  
 
Plaintiff has not
filed an opposition to this Demurrer.  Consequently,
Plaintiff does not provide any basis to change the Court’s prior determination
that her causes of action for breach of an oral contract and money had and
received and account stated are barred by the statute of limitations.  An action based upon the breach of an oral
contract claim must be filed within two years of discovery of the loss or
damage suffered by the aggrieved party. (Code Civ. Proc., § 339, subd. (1).)  A claim for money had and received must also
be filed within two years of the date of discovery.  (Id.) 
Like the original Complaint, the FAC alleges Defendants promised but did
not repay the loan by October 30, 2020. 
(Compare Complaint, ¶ 8 with FAC, ¶ 7.)  Plaintiff filed her Complaint on November 22,
2022—more than two years later.   Plaintiff’s
Second and Third Causes of Action are barred by the statute of limitations.
 
 IV.
      CONCLUSION
            
Based on the foregoing, the Demurrer to the Second and Third
Causes of Action of the FAC is SUSTAINED. 
Leave to amend is DENIED.
 
Defendant Jennifer O. Oh is ordered to serve and file her
Answer within 10 days of this order.
 
Defendant to give notice.
