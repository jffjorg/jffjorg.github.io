And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled in favor of the defendant, Jennifer O. Oh, and sustained her demurrer to the Second and Third Causes of Action in the First Amended Complaint (FAC). The FAC alleges breach of an oral contract and money had and received and account stated, but the judge finds that these causes of action are barred by the statute of limitations. The plaintiff, Joanne Pak, has not filed an opposition to the demurrer, and the judge notes that the FAC is unchanged from the original Complaint. The judge orders the defendant to serve and file her answer within 10 days and denies leave to amend the FAC.
