[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING
PETITIONER’S MOTION FOR ISSUANCE OF AN ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE AS TO WHY RESPONDENT
AND ITS COUNSEL SHOULD NOT BE HELD IN CONTEMPT AND SANCTIONED FOR RESPONDENT’S
ONGOING VIOLATION OF THIS COURT’S ORDER 
 
                                                 
I.         
BACKGROUND
Petitioner obtained a subpoena issued by a Delaware court
in Shareholder Representative Services, LLC v. Nestl USA, Inc. (Case No.
2023-0498-SKR), an action to recover certain payments that Respondent allegedly
failed to pay to the security holders of Freshly, Inc. Petitioner issued a
subpoena in the Delaware action for production of documents pertaining to
communications regarding the Delaware action, certain contracts and agreements
and payments received  which Respondent
refused to produce on grounds of privilege, relevance, and overbreadth. Petitioner
commenced this action to enforce the subpoena issued in the Delaware action. (Pet.
1/19/24.) 
On September 30, 2024, the Hon. Anne Richardson granted
Petitioner’s motion to enforce the Delaware subpoena and compelled Respondent
to provide further responses and production of documents within 30 days of the
court’s ruling. (M.O.
9/30/24.)
 
                                                  
II.        
ARGUMENTS
Petitioner moves for an order to show cause why
Respondent, Spencer/ShenkCapers & Associates (“Respondent”), should not be
held in contempt and sanctioned for Respondent’s failure to comply with Judge
Richardson’s order to provide further responses to the subpoena and to produce
documents. Petitioner argues that Respondent produced documents on October 30,
2034, but the production did not fully comply with the scope of the subpoena. 
Petitioner has met and conferred with Respondent to offer
any reasonable accommodation necessary to facilitate production of documents
because Respondent’s counsel, Polina Ross, was recovering from illness and surgeries.
Respondent’s counsel refused to transition this matter to another attorney and declared
herself “unavailable” to participate in discovery, ex parte applications,
motions, or other proceedings until January 2, 2025, which violates Judge
Richardson’s order. (Chessari decl., Ex. 2, 3.) Petitioner is aware from public
records that Ms. Ross continues to sign and file her own motions, supporting
declarations, and briefs in other matters since November 14, 2024. (Chessari
decl., ¶ 19, Ex. 4.)
On December 19, 2024, the court granted Petitioner’s ex
parte application to advance the hearing on this motion, previously set for
March 27, 2025. (M.O.
12/19/24.) Petitioner served Respondent with the court’s order on
December 20, 2024.  Ms. Ross stated she
would not appear at the hearing on this motion. (Chessari decl., Ex. 7.) Petitioner
requests an award for reasonable fees and costs to prepare this motion. 
Respondent did not file an opposition.

DISCUSSION
In
matters of indirect contempt, the court may issue a warrant of commitment upon
an order to show cause. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 1212.) After notice to the opposing party’s
counsel, and if the court is satisfied with the sufficiency of the affidavit,
the court “must sign an order to show cause re contempt in which the date and
time for a hearing are set forth. (§ 1212; Arthur v. Superior Court
(1965) 62 Cal.2d 404, 408, [‘an order to show cause must be issued’]; Weil
& Brown, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter
Group 1999) § 9:715, p. 9(II)–47.) The order to show cause acts as a
summons to appear in court on a certain day and, as its name suggests, to show
cause why a certain thing should not be done." (Cedars-Sinai
Imaging Medical Group v. Superior Court (2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 1281,
1286.)

“Disobedience
of any lawful judgment, order, or process of the court” is punishable by
contempt. The court determines four issues in a contempt proceeding: "(1)
the rendition of a valid order, (2) actual knowledge of the order, (3) ability
to comply, and (4) willful disobedience." (Van
v. LanguageLine Solutions (2017) 8 Cal.App.5th 73, 81.) As
the contempt proceeding is quasi-criminal in nature, guilt must be established
beyond a reasonable doubt. (Conn
v. Superior Court (1987) 196 Cal.App.3d 774, 784; Code
Civ. Proc., § 1209(a)(5).) 
Moving
party must prove the existence of a “valid court order, the alleged contemner's
knowledge of the order, and noncompliance. If the petitioner proves those
elements beyond a reasonable doubt the violation is established. He or she need
go no farther.” (Moss
v. Superior Court (Ortiz) (1998) 17 Cal.4th 396, 428.) 
Petitioner’s
evidence demonstrates that Judge Richardson issued a valid order on September
30, 2024, requiring Respondent to respond to the subpoena and produce
documents. (Chessari Affidavit, ¶ 12, Ex. 1.) Petitioner determined that Respondent’s
production of documents on October 30, 2024, did not fully comply with the
court’s order. (Id.,¶ 14.)  Petitioner
met and conferred with Respondent’s counsel regarding its deficient responses
on November 14, 2024, but Ms. Ross indicated she could not respond “until
December.” (Id. ¶ 15-16, Ex. 2.) 
Petitioner
sent a further email on December 30, 2024, again raising the issue of
Respondent’s non-compliance, however, Ms. Ross considered the email “incredibly
inappropriate” given her illness but stated she would “review and get back to
[Petitioner’s counsel] at the end of next week.” (Id.
¶ 21.) Respondent’s
“Notice of Unavailability” demonstrates Respondent’s refusal to comply with
Judge Richardson’s order. (Id. ¶
25, Ex. 3.) 
Accordingly,
Petitioner has met its burden of establishing Respondent’s actual knowledge of Judge
Richardson’s order, an ability to comply given Respondent’s partial compliance
on October 30, 2024, and willful disobedience demonstrated by Respondent’s
counsel’s unwillingness to meet and confer with Petitioner regarding its
deficient responses and production, and by removing herself from further
proceedings in this action without providing Petitioner with other counsel to
facilitate compliance with Judge Richardson’s order. (Aff., Ex. 3.)
                                                
IV.       
CONCLUSION
Based
on the foregoing, Petitioner’s motion for an order to show cause why Respondent
should not be held in contempt for failing to comply with Judge Richardson’s
order is GRANTED.  The court sets an OSC:
re Contempt for January 31, 2025, in Department 40 of the Stanley Mosk
Courthouse at 9:30 a.m.  
Petitioner
acknowledges that Respondent complied in part with Judge Richardson’s October 30,
2024, but did not fully comply with the court’s order. (Chessari decl., ¶ 14.) The Court strikes Petitioner’s proposed OSC
filed December 19, 2024, finding that the proposed OSC is vague as to how
Respondent failed to fully comply with Judge Richardson’s October 30, 2024, order.    In addition, Petitioner’s proposed order
identifies the Honorable Sheldon Ronnie as the judge presiding.  This is inaccurate.  Petitioner is ordered to submit a proposed
OSC curing the above defects and must list with specificity the portions of Judge
Richardson’s order violated by Respondent that form the basis of contempt.  Once signed by the Court, Petitioner is ordered
to serve the OSC on Respondent and file proof of service with the Court two
court days before the hearing date. (Cedars-Sinai Imaging Medical Group v.
Superior Court (2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 1281.)
The
court defers Petitioner’s request for attorney’s fees until the time of the
order to show cause hearing as attorney’s fees are permitted where any person
is adjudged guilty of contempt. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 1218 subd. (a).)
