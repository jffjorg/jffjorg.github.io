And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the demurrer to the second cause of action, which alleges intentional misrepresentation, is overruled. The plaintiff has alleged that SG & AW made a false promise to induce the plaintiff to lend $1,000,000 to GWRS, and that SG & AW did not intend to perform that promise. The judge finds that the plaintiff has alleged sufficient facts to state a cause of action for promissory fraud, despite the contention that SG & AW did not exist at the time it allegedly made the misrepresentation. The judge also finds that SG & AW ratified the actions of Gumrucku and Wittekind, who owned and operated Gumrucku Health, which sold the equipment purchased with the loan proceeds. The judge orders SG & AW to file an answer to the Second Amended Complaint within 20 days.
