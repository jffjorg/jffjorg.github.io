  Case Number:  22STCV26335    Hearing Date:   June 25, 2024    Dept:  14 #10Case Background
 
Plaintiff
alleges that it loaned money to Defendant GWRS Holdings, LLC (“GWRS”) on
favorable
terms in exchange for an ownership share in GWRS. Plaintiff claims that GWRS
then
took
their money and transferred it to another entity, which used it to operate a
business which
ultimately
folded. When that business folded, it sold off its assets that had been
purchased with the loan proceeds. Plaintiff has not yet been repaid, despite
multiple demands.
 
On
May 22, 2023 Plaintiff filed its First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) for (1) Breach
of
Contract,
(2) Fraudulent Transfer – Sale Proceeds, (3) Fraudulent Transfer – Loan
Proceeds, (4)
Intentional
Misrepresentation, and (5) Negligent Misrepresentation against Defendants GWRS
Holdings,
LLC (“GWRS”), SG & AW Holdings LLC (“SG & AW”), Serhat Gumrukcu
(“Gumrukcu”), Anderson Wittekind (“Wittekind”), and DOES 1-50.
 
            On March 4, 2024, Plaintiff filed
the operative Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”) for (1) Breach of Contract, and
(2) Intentional Misrepresentation against GWRS, SG & AW, Gumrukcu,
Wittekind, and DOES 1-50.
 
            On April 12,
2024, Defendant SG & AW demurred to the SAC. On June 11, 2024, Plaintiff
opposed the demurrer. On June 17, 2024, SG & AW replied.
 
            A jury
trial is currently scheduled for October 21, 2024.
 
Instant Motion
 
SG & AW demurs to the second
cause of action in the SAC for failure to state a cause of action.
 
Decision
 
            The
demurrer to the second cause of action is OVERRULED. Defendant SG & AW must
file an answer to the SAC within 20 days of the Court’s order.
 
Second Cause of Action: Intentional Misrepresentation
 
“’The elements
of promissory fraud
... are: (1) a promise made regarding a material fact without any intention of
performing it; (2) the existence of the intent not to perform at the time the
promise was made; (3) intent to deceive or induce the promisee to enter into a
transaction; (4) reasonable reliance by the promisee; (5) nonperformance by the
party making the promise; and (6) resulting damage to the promise[e].’
[Citation.] As with any other form of fraud,
each element of a promissory
fraud claim must be alleged with
particularity. [Citation.]” (Rossberg v. Bank of Am., N.A. (2013) 219 Cal.App.4th 1481, 1498.)
 
As the Court found in its prior
ruling on the motion for judgment on the pleadings to the FAC, what Plaintiff
has alleged here is promissory fraud. (Minute Order (8/8/23).) The Court still
finds Plaintiff has alleged sufficient facts to state a cause of action for
promissory fraud, despite the contention that SG & AW did not exist at the
time it allegedly made the misrepresentation to Plaintiff. (See Request for
Judicial Notice (1/25/24).)[1]
The SAC alleges that SG & AW, and others, induced Plaintiff to lend GWRS
$1,000,000 in exchange for a 50% ownership interest in GWRS, then GWRS funneled
that money to Gumrucku Health, an entity owned and operated by SG & AW and
others, Gumrucku Health sold the equipment purchased with the loan proceeds, but
GWRS has not repaid the Plaintiff despite multiple demands. (SAC, ¶¶ 11-24.) In
essence, the SAC alleges a promise made without any intent to perform it. (Beckwith
v. Dahl (2012) 205 Cal.App.4th 1039, 1060.)
 
The Court further finds these
allegations sufficient to show ratification by SG & AW of Gumrucku’s and
Wittekind’s actions before SG & AW was officially formed in May 2018. (See
Request for Judicial Notice (1/25/24); see Stickel v. Harris (1987) 196
Cal.App.3d 575, 586 [ratification found where the subsequently formed business
entity knowingly accepts the benefits of the acts of its promoters].) The Court
agrees with Plaintiff that the SAC contains sufficient allegations to show that
Gumrucku and Wittekind had full knowledge of the facts surrounding the alleged
fraud, since the SAC alleges they own SG & AW and that the money lent to
GWRS at the behest of SG & AW, Gumrucku, and Wittekind, was transferred to
another entity of theirs, i.e., Gumrucku Health. (SAC, ¶¶ 5, 18.) SG & AW’s
arguments regarding statements made during depositions are irrelevant at the
demurrer stage since the Court is limited to the pleadings or matters subject
to judicial notice. (Blank
v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.)
 
 
Conclusion
 
The demurrer to the second cause of
action is OVERRULED. Defendant SG & AW must file an answer to the SAC
within 20 days of the Court’s order.
