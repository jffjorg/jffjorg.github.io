 Case Number:  23STCV17980    Hearing Date:   June 25, 2024    Dept:  14 #8Case Background
Plaintiff is in pro per.  Plaintiff alleges Defendant Stubhub sold
items of great value and then intentionally devalued them under pressure from
the Padres.
 
            Plaintiff
filed a complaint on July 31, 2023 alleging breach of contract, common counts,
interference with business relations, fraud, oppression, malice, breach of
agreements, representations, business slander, intentional infliction of
emotional distress and negligent infliction of emotional distress.  Plaintiff’s complaint is poorly drafted and
does not contain separate attachments for each cause of action.  Plaintiff’s allegations are nearly
incomprehensible.
 
Plaintiff has not served
Defendant.  No appearances have been
made.  Plaintiff obtained a fee waiver on
August 1, 2023.  
 
            There is no
trial date.
 
Motion for Nunc Pro Tunc Filing Complaint to Original
Upload/Filing Date 5/1/23 in 23LA00642793
 
Plaintiff moves the Court for an order correcting the file date of this
complaint to May 1, 2023.  Plaintiff
attempted to file a complaint based on the same facts alleged here on May 1,
2023 and the complaint was rejected for filing for insignificant errors.  
 
Decision
 
            The motion is DENIED.  Plaintiff fails to submit the rejection sheet
for the complaint he purportedly filed on May 1, 2023, nor does it appear that
he attempted to file the May 1, 2023 complaint in this action.  There is no record of a rejected complaint in
this action, Case No. 23STCV17980.  
 
Governing
Standard/Statute
“The court may, upon motion of the injured party, or its own motion,
correct clerical mistakes in its judgment or orders as entered, so as to
conform to the judgment or order directed, and may, on motion of either party
after notice to the other party, set aside any void judgment or order.” (CCP
§473(d).)
 
“It is well settled that a court has the inherent power to correct a
clerical error in its judgment so that the judgment will reflect the true
facts.  The power of a court to correct
clerical mistakes in judgments is also a statutory power pursuant to section
473.”  (Estate of Douglas (2022)
83 Cal.App.5th 690, 695.)  
 
“A clerical error in the judgment includes inadvertent errors made by the
court which cannot reasonably be attributed to the exercise of judicial
consideration or discretion.  Clerical
error is to be distinguished from judicial error which cannot be corrected by
amendment. The distinction between clerical error and judicial error is whether
the error was made in rendering the judgment, or in recording the judgment
rendered.  Any attempt by a court, under
the guise of correcting clerical error, to revise its deliberately exercised
judicial discretion is not permitted.  A
judicial error is the deliberate result of judicial reasoning and
determination   The term ‘clerical error’
covers all errors, mistakes, or omissions which are not the result of the
exercise of the judicial function. If an error, mistake, or omission is the
result of inadvertence, but for which a different judgment would have been
rendered, the error is clerical and the judgment may be corrected.”  (Estate of Douglas, supra, 83
Cal.App.5th at 695.)  
 
“Where…the defect…is insubstantial, the clerk should file the complaint
and notify the attorney or party that the perceived defect should be corrected
at the earliest opportunity.  That should
create no more difficulty than returning all the documents with a notice
pointing out the defects….The functions of the clerk are purely
ministerial.  The clerk has no discretion
to reject a complaint that substantially conforms to the local rules.”  (Rojas v. Cutsforth (1998) 67
Cal.App.4th 774, 777–778.)  A “paper is
deemed filed when it is deposited with the clerk with directions to file the
paper.”  (Id. at 778.)  The clerk does not have the authority to
reject a complaint that is filed in conformity with the state court rules but
fails to comply with a local rule.  (Carlson
v. State of California Department of Fish & Game (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th
1268, 1272-1273 (clerk had no authority to reject complaint for filing based on
failure to include Certificate of Assignment required by local rule).)  
 
“If the clerk does not file a
document because it does not comply with applicable filing requirements or
because the required filing fee has not been paid, the court must promptly send
notice of the rejection of the document for filing to the electronic filer. The
notice must state the reasons that the document was rejected for filing.”  (CRC Rule 2.259(b).)  
            
Discussion 
 
Plaintiff asks that the Court
correct the filing date of the complaint filed in this action on July 31, 2023
to May 1, 2023.  Plaintiff argues the
clerk improperly rejected his complaint filed on May 1, 2023 based on
inconsistencies in the names of the Plaintiff and Defendant.  
 
Plaintiff fails to submit the
rejection sheet issued by the clerk as to the May 1, 2023 complaint.  The Court cannot find that the proposed
complaint submitted on May 1, 2023 was improperly rejected due to clerical
error without the rejection sheet.  Plaintiff’s
explanation of the grounds for rejection is unclear.  The Court also cannot rely on Plaintiff’s
summary of the rejection sheet.  
 
In addition, Plaintiff is asking
that the Court deem the filing date of the complaint in this action to be May
1, 2023.  However, Plaintiff appears to
be referencing a separate case number in his caption, “23LA00642793.”  This is not a valid case number.  If the May 1, 2023 complaint was improperly
rejected in “23LA00642793,” then the nunc pro tunc order would be in that case,
not in this case.  
 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiff fails to establish that the May 1, 2023 complaint was rejected
due to clerical error and must be corrected nunc pro tunc by adjusting the
filing date of the complaint filed on July 31, 2023 in this action.  
 
The motion is DENIED.
