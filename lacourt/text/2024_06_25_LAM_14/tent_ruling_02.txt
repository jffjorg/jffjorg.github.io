[1] Even though SG
& AW did not request judicial notice of SG & AW’s Articles of
Organization with this motion, the Court can take judicial notice of its own
record. (Starr v. Ashbrook (2023) 87 Cal.App.5th 999, 1014 [“Although a court cannot take judicial
notice of hearsay
allegations in a court record,
it can take judicial
notice of the truth
of facts asserted
in documents such as orders, findings
of fact and conclusions
of law, and judgments.”])
But, the Court only takes judicial notice of the existence and contents of such
documents, it does not take judicial notice of the factual matters asserted
therein. (Dominguez v. Bonta (2022) 87 Cal. App. 5th 389, 400.)
