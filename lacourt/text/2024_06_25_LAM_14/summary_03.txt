```

Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The Court has considered the motion filed by the plaintiff (in his own behalf) to correct the filing date of the complaint in this action from July 31, 2023 to May 1, 2023. The plaintiff claims that the clerk improperly rejected his original complaint filed on May 1, 2023 due to clerical errors. However, the Court finds that the plaintiff has failed to provide the rejection sheet issued by the clerk as to the May 1, 2023 complaint, and the Court cannot rely on the plaintiff's summary of the rejection sheet. Furthermore, the Court notes that the plaintiff is referencing a separate case number in his caption, which is not a valid case number. Therefore, the motion is denied.
