And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Carpenter v. Trigo, granting the defendant's motion to strike the plaintiff's request for punitive damages. To be eligible for punitive damages, the plaintiff must prove that the defendant acted with oppression, fraud, or malice. The judge has determined that the plaintiff's allegations of negligence and malicious behavior do not meet this standard. The judge has concluded that the defendant's alleged cell phone use during the accident does not constitute malicious or despicable conduct, and therefore the motion to strike punitive damages is granted.
