Defendant Chateau Colline
Homeowners Association’s Motions for Terminating Sanctions
Defendant
Chateau Colline Homeowners Association’s Motions to Deem RFAs Admitted
Plaintiffs Jane and May Doe, in pro
per, and plaintiff John Doe sue defendants Curtis Olson, Nexus Development
Corporation, Chateau Colline Homeowners Association (“Chateau”) and 13 others
for 38 COAs arising out of alleged sexual assault, battery and harassment. The
court ruled 9/5/24 granting a protective order as to May Doe. Min. Order
9/5/24. Plaintiffs move for reconsideration. Defendants oppose. The court
granted plaintiffs’ motion for attorney’s fees 9/5/24 pursuant to a successful
anti-SLAPP motion. Id. Olson moves for relief from attorney’s fees.
Plaintiffs oppose. The court granted Chateau’s 9/5/24 motion to compel
discovery and granted $1,867.26 in sanctions against plaintiffs. Id.
Chateau alleges noncompliance and moves for terminating sanctions and deem RFAs
admitted, as well as for monetary sanctions. Plaintiffs oppose. 
Plaintiff May Doe’s Motion for Reconsideration
Cal. Code
Civ. Proc. §1008(a) states that: “When an application for an order has been
made to a judge, or to a court, and refused in whole or in part, or granted, or
granted conditionally, or on terms, any party affected by the order may, within
10 days after service upon the party of written notice of entry of the order
and based upon new or different facts, circumstances, or law, make application
to the same judge or court that made the order, to reconsider the matter and
modify, amend, or revoke the prior order.”
The court
granted a protective order for May Doe limiting disclosure of her personal
information, allowing only her name to be released to defendants. Min. Order
9/5/24. Plaintiffs argue the court should reconsider its order and prevent even
May Doe’s name from being disclosed. Plaintiffs argue new facts have been
produced, specifically that plaintiffs were able to hire private investigators
that identified May Doe using only her first and last name. Plaintiffs assert
defendants could also identify May Doe and may intimidate or otherwise threaten
her. Plaintiffs offer the declarations of counsel Aaronoff and of private
investigators Petee and Woldford in support.
These are
not new facts. Plaintiffs have already argued this same speculated risk at the hearing
9/5/24. Min. Order 9/5/24. The court ordered May Doe’s name not to be disclosed
outside the course of litigation. This is sufficient protection, in addition to
the existing protective order. If plaintiffs become aware of any violations of
the court’s orders, they may seek redress at that time. DENIED.
Defendant/Cross-Complainant Curtis
Olson’s Motion for Relief from Attorney’s Fees
Cal.
Code Civ. Proc. §473(b) provides: “The court may, upon any terms as may be
just, relieve a party or his or her legal representative from a judgment,
dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken against him or her through his or
her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.”
Olson
asks the court to vacate its 9/5/24 order granting plaintiffs $231,606.25 in
attorney’s fees and requests the court revisit its 4/19/23 order for the
parties to jointly confer and present an order of remaining outstanding issues.
Olson argues the court’s 9/5/24 grant of fees arose from Olson’s counsel’s mistake,
whereby Olson switched counsel between the 4/19/23 order and the 9/5/24 hearing,
resulting in new counsel failing to prepare a joint order of outstanding
issues. Olson additionally argues surprise arising from the court’s inability
to access transcripts from 4/19/23 at the 9/5/24 hearing and the court’s
subsequent “inability to follow” Olson’s counsel’s arguments. These arguments
are unavailing.
Olson’s
contention that counsel’s misunderstanding of the court’s orders is reasonable
has no merit. If counsel was confused, a request for clarification could have
and should have been made. Relief is not appropriate when a party allegedly fails
to understand and fails to ask for clarification. Olson cannot argue counsel
did not know of the court’s order, as the declaration of counsel demonstrates. See
Decl. Eballar generally. That counsel misunderstood the court’s order and
prepared an incorrect filing is not grounds for relief. Decl. Eballar para. 13.

Olson’s
argument that the court’s lack of 4/19/23 transcript constitutes surprise is
equally unavailing. It is incumbent on the parties to lodge supporting evidence
prior to hearings. DENIED.
Defendant
Chateau Colline Homeowners Association’s Motions for Terminating Sanctions
Where a
party willfully disobeys a discovery order, courts have discretion to impose
terminating, issue, evidentiary or monetary sanctions. E.g., Code Civ. Proc. §§
2023.010(g), 2030.290(c); R.S. Creative, Inc. v. Creative Cotton, Ltd.
(1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 486, 495. Terminating sanctions are authorized where the
evidence shows less severe sanctions will not be successful in compelling
responses. Mileikowsky v. Tenet Healthsystem (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 262,
279-280. Courts may require financial reimbursement for expenses incurred as to
misuse of the discovery process. Code Civ. Proc., §2023.030; Deyo v.
Kilbourne (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 771, 789, superseded by statute on another
ground as stated in Guzman v. General Motors Corp. (1984) 154 Cal.App.3d
438, 444; In re Marriage of Niklas (1989) 211 Cal.App.3d 28, 37.
Chateau served
form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and request for production on
plaintiffs on 9/6/23 and 9/7/23. Min. Order 9/5/24. May Doe served responses 10/16/23;
Jane Doe failed to respond. Id. The court ordered further responses from
both plaintiffs. Id. The court granted monetary sanctions totaling
$1,867.26. Id. Chateau moves for terminating sanctions, arguing further
responses were never produced. Decls. Partida paras. 3-5. Chateau seeks $1,050
in additional sanctions. 
Plaintiffs
argue their failure to produce responses was not willful, and they will have
complied with the court’s orders before hearing on the instant matter. Plaintiffs
argue withdrawal of previous counsel Martinez-Senftner delayed production.
Decl. Martinez-Senftner paras. 4-6. Plaintiffs declare they intended to serve
responses prior to the original 12/5/24 hearing date on this matter. Decl. Doe
para. 4. 
Terminating
sanctions are a drastic measure and ought to be employed sparingly. Deyo,
supra. Plaintiffs provided evidence the failure to comply was not
willful and will be rectified. This is sufficient to survive a motion for
terminating sanctions. Chateau is entitled to monetary sanctions for expenses
incurred by bringing this motion. Id.; R.S. Creative, Inc., supra.
Chateau incurred fees at $220/hour for 6 hours plus $60 in costs totaling
$1,320 but only seeks $1,050. Decl. Parida para. 6. Motion DENIED; sanctions
awarded as above.
Defendant
Chateau Colline Homeowners Association’s Motions to Deem RFAs Admitted
When a
party fails to timely respond to written discovery requests, including
interrogatories and requests for production of documents, propounding party can
move for an order compelling a response without objections. Code of Civ. Proc.
§2023.290. If a party fails to serve timely responses to requests for
admission, the requesting party can move for an order deeming the truth of any
matter specified in the requests admitted. Code of Civ. Proc. §2033.280.
Chateau
served requests for admission, set one, on plaintiffs 9/5/24. Decl. Partida
exh. A. Plaintiffs failed to respond. Decl. Partida para. 5. Chateau moves to
deems RFAs admitted and for monetary sanctions totaling $690. Plaintiffs argue
Jane Doe was improperly served via electronic mail and May Doe was not served
at all. Jane Doe asserts she communicated with Chateau’s counsel that
electronic mail was not working and requested service via U.S. mail multiple
times. Decl. Doe paras. 3-10. May Doe asserts neither she nor her counsel,
Aaronoff, were served. Decl. Aaronoff paras. 3-5. Plaintiffs argue they
provided compliant responses to the RFAs. Decl. Doe para. 12; Decl. Aaronoff
para. 6.
Chateau
argues plaintiffs have not provided sufficient responses as they included
objections, which Chateau argues are improper due to the untimeliness of the
responses. “A motion to have the genuineness of any documents and the truth of
any matters specified in the requests for admission deemed admitted should not
be granted when (1) proposed responses to the requests are served before the
hearing date and (2) those responses are in substantial compliance with CCP
Sections 2033.210-2033.240.” Tobin v. Oris (1992) 3 Cal. App. 4th 814. A
party has the right to partially denial and partially admit a request, as well.
Chodos v. Superior Court (1963), 215 Cal.App.2d 318, 322. Chateau’s
argument is unavailing; while tardy, plaintiffs’ responses are sufficient
despite their inclusion of objections. 
Monetary
sanctions are mandatory against a party whose failure to respond to requests
for admissions necessitates a motion. Cal. Code Civ. Proc., §2033.280(c). It is
undeniable that plaintiffs were tardy in their responses, necessitating the
instant motion. Chateau claims $220/hour for 4 hours plus $60 in costs totaling
$940, but requests only $690 in sanctions.
Motion is
DENIED; sanctions are awarded as above.
Summary
Plaintiff May Doe’s
motion for reconsideration is DENIED. Defendant/cross-complainant Curtis
Olson’s motion for relief is DENIED. Defendant Chateau’s motions for
terminating sanctions and to deem RFAs admitted are DENIED. Defendant Chateau
awarded sanctions totaling $1,740
