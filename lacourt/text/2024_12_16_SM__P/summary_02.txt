Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has denied Plaintiff May Doe's motion for reconsideration of the protective order, which limited disclosure of her personal information to only her name. The court has also denied Defendant Curtis Olson's motion for relief from attorney's fees, which was based on alleged mistakes and surprise. Additionally, the court has denied Defendant Chateau's motions for terminating sanctions and to deem RFAs admitted. Chateau was awarded sanctions totaling $1,740. The court finds that the plaintiffs' failure to comply with discovery orders was not willful and that the defendants' claims of surprise and mistake are unavailing.
