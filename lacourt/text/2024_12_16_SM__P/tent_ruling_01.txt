Carpenter v. Trigo, Case no. 24SMCV03773
Hearing date December 16, 2024
Defendants
Trigo’s Motion to Strike Punitive Damages
Plaintiff
Carpenter sues defendants for injuries arising out of a rear end automobile
accident. Defendants seek to strike the prayer for punitive damages. 
To
obtain punitive damages, plaintiff must prove oppression, fraud or malice. Cal.
Civ. Code §3294(a). Facts giving rise to a claim for punitive damages must be
pleaded specifically – vague or conclusory allegations are insufficient. G.D.
Searle & Company v. Superior Court (1975) 49 Cal.App.3d 22, 29.
Conclusory requests for punitive damages without factual support are subject to
a motion to strike. E.g., Cyrus v. Haveson (1976) 65 Cal.App.3d 306,
316-317; Grieves v. Superior Court (1984) 157 Cal.App.3d 159, 164.
Recklessness or negligence, even gross negligence, are insufficient to support
an award of punitive damage – carelessness or ignorance are not enough. Dawes
v. Superior Court (1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 82, 88. On a motion to strike,
allegations must be treated as true. E.g., Clauson v. Sup. Ct. (1998) 67
Cal.App.4th 1253, 1255.
Plaintiff
alleges negligence, with allegations regarding punitive damages in a cause of
action for “Malice.” Compl. paras. 11, 17. Plaintiff alleges defendant Jayden
Trigo struck plaintiff’s car while using a cell phone. Compl. paras. 3-7, 18. 
California
law has long established negligence alone is not a sufficient basis for
punitive damages. Dawes, supra. Merely pleading that conduct was
willful does not satisfy the pleading standard for punitive damages; conduct
must be malicious and despicable. Cal. Civ. Code §3294(a). Defendant’s alleged
cell phone use does not constitute malicious or despicable conduct. Motion to
strike punitive damages is GRANTED.
