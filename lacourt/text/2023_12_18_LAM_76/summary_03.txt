And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the motion to quash service of summons filed by Defendant Romex Textiles, Inc. The judge finds that the defendant was properly served via substituted service on August 23, 2023, and that the service was valid. The judge also notes that the defendant's CEO, Shahab Binafard, claims that he was not served and that the service was invalid, but the judge finds that this claim is inconsistent with the video recording submitted by the plaintiff in opposition to the motion. The judge orders the defendant to answer the Complaint within 5 days.

The judge also denies the plaintiff's request for sanctions against attorney Nico Tabibi.

The judge grants the plaintiff's request to take judicial notice of certain documents, including the Secretary of State's records and the State Bar records. The judge finds that the plaintiff has met its initial burden of proof on the motion to quash, and that the defendant has failed to demonstrate that the exercise of jurisdiction would be unreasonable.
