[1] It is
not clear why Plaintiff’s counsel believes that a consolidated trial would
consume 40 to 50 days, given the nature of the claims.  Based on the Court’s experience and review of
the pleadings, the Court does not believe that individual trials—if conducted
efficiently—would require more than three or four days, exclusive of jury
selection.  With the elimination of duplicate
testimony, a consolidated trial would almost certainly require far less time
than the sum of six separate trials.
