Discussion
Defendant Romex Textiles, Inc. moves
to quash service of summons and set aside default.
On a motion to quash for lack of
personal jurisdiction, the plaintiff has
the initial burden of proof:

“When a defendant moves to quash
service of process” for lack of specific jurisdiction, “the plaintiff has the
initial burden of demonstrating facts justifying the exercise of jurisdiction.”
( Vons, supra, 14 Cal.4th at p. 449.) “If the plaintiff meets this initial
burden, then the defendant has the burden of demonstrating ‘that the exercise
of jurisdiction would be unreasonable.’ ” ( Pavlovich, supra, 29 Cal.4th at p.
273, quoting Vons, at p. 449.) 

(Snowney v. Harrah's Entertainment, Inc.
(2005) 35 Cal.4th 1054, 1062 [bold emphasis added].)
            In an
unlawful detainer action, written opposition to a motion to quash may be filed
and served on or before the court day before the hearing. (Cal. Rules of Court,
Rule 3.1327(c). Here, the Opposition was filed and electronically served on December
13, 2023, relative to the December 18, 2023 hearing date.
Shahab Binafard, President and
Chief Executive Officer of specially-appearing Defendant Romex Textiles, Inc. states
that a woman threw papers at his head on August 7, 2023 while he was walking toward
his car, that she shouted names, and that he threw the package back at her.
(Binafard Decl., ¶¶ 4, 5.)  He contends
that he has not received the summons and complaint at his office or home
address. (Id. at ¶ 8.)
Unfortunately for Defendant, the fact
that he grasped the papers to throw back at the woman constitutes personal
service upon him on behalf of Defendant Romex Textiles, Inc. Were it otherwise,
no one could be personally served if all they had to do was throw the papers back
at the process server or discard the papers. 
Moreover, Binafard’s sworn statements in his declaration do not appear
to be consistent with the video recording Plaintiff has submitted in opposition
to the motion.
In any event, on August 23, 2023, Defendant
Romex Textiles, Inc. was served via substituted service at 1430 Griffith Avenue,
Los Angeles, CA 90021 on August 23, 2023, effective on September 2, 2023 (10
days after mailing—Civ. Proc. Code, § 415.20(a)). (RJN, Exhs. C [Proof of
Service] and D [Declaration of Ediberto Valle Nava Re Due Diligence For
Substituted Service].) As such, Defendant Romex Textiles, Inc. was properly
served at the latest on September 2, 2023.
            As such,
the motion to quash is DENIED. Defendant Romex Textiles, Inc. is ordered to
answer the Complaint within 5 days.
            Plaintiff’s
request for sanctions against attorney Nico Tabibi is DENIED.
