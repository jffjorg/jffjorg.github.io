            Defendants
argue that the actions name identical Defendants, represented by the same
counsel in each matter, and the costs and effort related to litigation,
including discovery, court appearances and mediation will be unnecessarily
duplicated if the cases are not consolidated.
Regarding
consolidation, Civ. Proc. Code, § 1048(a) provides:
(a) When actions involving a common
question of law or fact are pending before the court, it may order a joint
hearing or trial of any or all the matters in issue in the actions; it may
order all the actions consolidated and it may make such orders concerning
proceedings therein as may tend to avoid unnecessary costs or delay.
 
(Civ. Proc. Code, § 1048(a).)
            “Whether
separate actions shall be consolidated for trial is a matter within the
discretion of the trial court and its decision will not be disturbed on appeal
absent a clear showing of abuse of discretion. (Citation omitted.) . . . ‘A
consolidation of actions does not affect the rights of the parties. The purpose
of consolidation is merely to promote trial convenience and economy by avoiding
duplication of procedure, particularly in the proof of issues common to both
actions.’ (Citation omitted.)” (Estate of Baker (1982) 131 Cal.App.3d 471, 485 [bold
emphasis added].)
            Here, all related actions pertain to
the same subject property, owned and managed by the same Defendants. While the
time periods may not be the same, presentation of the entire time frame will
not confuse the jury and, in fact, might work against moving Defendants.
            Plaintiffs do not oppose
consolidation for purposes of case management conference, mediations, court
hearings or otherwise, but do oppose consolidation for purposes of trial. Plaintiffs
argue that all of the tenancies are for different periods and some have moved
out. Plaintiffs argue that instead of a 7-day trial for each case, this would
be a 40-50 day long cause trial.
However, 6 cases of 7-day trials would total 42 days, which is at the
lower end of Plaintiff’s asserted estimate. [1]
 Separate trials would require
substantial presentation of duplicative evidence and repeatedly calling the same
witnesses—a waste of the parties’ time and judicial resources and an avoidable
inconvenience for the witnesses.  Not to
mention the fact that calling seven separate panels of jurors would be a
substantial burden on the public that would not be justified in the absence of
a need to “silo” the evidence to protect parties from crossover prejudice.  Also, there would be a risk of inconsistent
findings of liability if individual claims were separately litigated.
As for differing dates of tenancy and different causation of damages,
this can be readily managed by the use of an organized  verdict form and management of
the order in which evidence is presented. 
For example, the Court might simply order that evidence of Defendants’
management of the property and the alleged uninhabitable conditions be
presented first, followed by the case-specific/Plaintiff-specific evidence of
liability and damages.
The Court finds that consolidation of these related cases will promote
trial convenience and economy. As such, the motion to consolidate for all
purposes is GRANTED. The lead case shall be 23STCV12998.
