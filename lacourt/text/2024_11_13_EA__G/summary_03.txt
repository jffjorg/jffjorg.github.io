And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by Checkr, Inc. against the First Amended Complaint (FAC) filed by Plaintiffs Candice Ruppert and Kenneth Ruppert. The case involves a personal injury action arising from a motor vehicle collision. The Rupperts allege that Checkr, Inc. failed to conduct a thorough background check of the driver, Xiuhe Huang, which would have uncovered his unsafe driving history. Checkr, Inc. demurred to the entire FAC, arguing that the Rupperts did not adequately plead breach and causation. The court disagrees, finding that the allegations of Checkr's alleged breach are not foreclosed by federal consumer reporting requirements. The court also finds that the Rupperts' allegations of negligence may be pleaded generally.

As to the second cause of action for negligent hiring, supervision, and training, the court disagrees with Checkr, Inc.'s argument that the Rupperts failed to allege that Huang was Checkr, Inc.'s employee. The court gives the Rupperts leave to amend the FAC to include allegations that Checkr, Inc. was negligent in hiring, supervising, and training its employees in performing background checks.

In conclusion, the court OVERRULES Checkr's demurrer to the first cause of action and SUSTAINS Checkr's demurrer to the second cause of action with leave to amend.
