And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants Defendant Arturo Salvador's motion for leave to file a cross-complaint against Armando Paniagua Prudencio, Erika Sarai Liopez Ventura, Maria Angelica Espinoza Chavez, Jose Amilcar Solorzano Monge, Keiry Vanessa Lopez Ventura, Carlos Ernesto Hernandez Perez, and Roes 1-50. The cross-complaint alleges causes of action for equitable indemnity, implied indemnity, comparative indemnity, apportionment of fault, and contribution. The judge finds that the cross-complaint is compulsory and that Salvador has established good cause to file it, as the claims arise out of the same transaction or series of events as the original complaint. The judge also notes that there was no opposition to the motion.
