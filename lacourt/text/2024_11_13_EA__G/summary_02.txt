Here is a summary in English text:

The judge issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by Ford Motor Company and Puente Hills Ford to a complaint filed by Sylvia V Ramirez and Osvaldo Huizar. The complaint alleges that Ford and Puente Hills Ford breached a warranty contract and committed fraudulent inducement and negligent repair. The judge sustained the demurrer to the sixth cause of action, alleging negligent repair, with leave to amend, but overruled the demurrer to the fifth cause of action, alleging fraudulent inducement. The judge found that the allegations in the complaint were sufficient to state a cause of action for fraudulent inducement, but that the economic loss rule barred the claim for negligent repair. The judge also rejected the defendants' argument that the plaintiffs failed to allege a direct transactional relationship with them.
