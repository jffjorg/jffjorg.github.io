And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion to dismiss a case involving the applicability of California Code of Regulations (CCR) sections. The judge notes that the defendants have pleaded this issue in their affirmative defense, noting that it is a matter of law. The judge is also considering whether to require regulatory input from the Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) for guidelines. The judge is also considering the conduct of a survey by Walter Meneses, which may have been biased due to opinions about eating habits based on race. The judge is also considering the interpretation of CCR sections 25203, 25204, 25721, and 25721(d)(2), and is not clear on whether (d)(2) applies in this case. The judge notes that (c)(2) and (d)(2) concern what exposure would be "reasonably anticipated" and that neither section looks at the general population. The judge is considering the intent of the Legislature in drafting these sections and how they apply to the facts of this case.
