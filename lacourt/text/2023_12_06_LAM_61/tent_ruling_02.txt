 Case Number:  22STCV33876    Hearing Date:   December 6, 2023    Dept:  61 Cal. Code of Civ. Proc. (“CCP”) section 284
states that “[t]he attorney in an action or special proceeding may be changed
at any time before or after judgment or final determination” upon either
consent of both client and attorney, or upon the order of the court under
application of either the client of the attorney, after notice from one to the
other. Cal. Rule of Court 3.1362 states the requirements for a motion to be
relieved as counsel under CCP section 284. No memorandum is required, but the
motion must be accompanied by (1) a declaration stating why a motion has been
brought instead of filing a consent (without compromising attorney-client
confidentiality), (2) proof of service of the motion, and (3) all hearing dates
scheduled in the action or proceeding, including the date of trial, if known.
(CRC Rule 3.1362, subd. (a), (c), (d).) Additionally, “[t]he proposed order
relieving counsel must be prepared on the Order Granting Attorney's Motion to
Be Relieved as Counsel--Civil (form MC-053) and must be lodged with the court
with the moving papers.” (CRC Rule 3.1362, subd. (e).)
