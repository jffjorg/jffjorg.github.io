And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling concerns a motion to compel further response to demands for inspection and destructive testing filed by Marathon HVAC Service, Inc. (Defendant) against John N. Drooyan (Plaintiff). The demands seek access to Plaintiff's condominium to conduct various types of testing, including destructive testing, to evaluate the condition of the unit and determine the cause and amount of Plaintiff's damages. Plaintiff opposes the motion, arguing that the testing is unnecessary and would be a burdensome intrusion upon his privacy. The court grants the motion, with the condition that the Defendant pay all costs of the testing, except for Demand No. 28, which is deemed overly broad. The court also denies the Defendant's request for sanctions, as Plaintiff opposed the motion with substantial justification.
