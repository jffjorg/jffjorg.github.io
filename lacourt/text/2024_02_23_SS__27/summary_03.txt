And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted Mama Shelter's motion to leave to file a cross-complaint against Draken Private Security and Mt. Hawley Insurance Company, seeking contribution, implied and express indemnity, and declaratory relief. The cross-complaint arises out of the same transaction or occurrence as the plaintiff's claim, and it is in the interests of justice to permit the defendants to file the cross-complaint. The judge notes that Draken and Mt. Hawley agreed to provide security services and named Mama Shelter as an additional insured on their insurance policy, assuming certain responsibilities to defend and potentially indemnify Mama Shelter. The judge references a previous court case, Countrywide Home Loans, Inc. v. Superior Court (1999), to support the conclusion that a claim for contribution or indemnity "arises out of" the same transaction or occurrence as the plaintiff's claim.
