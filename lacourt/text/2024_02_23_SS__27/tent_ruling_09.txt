 
BACKGROUND
 
This case stems from a slip and fall incident on December 2,
2021. The Plaintiff, while working as an independent contractor inside a store
owned by the Defendant, allegedly slipped and fell due to a wet floor,
resulting in multiple injuries. Subsequently, the Plaintiff initiated legal
action against the Defendant, asserting claims for Negligence and Premises
Liability.
 
Plaintiff contends that she sustained numerous injuries as a
result of the slip and fall accident, including a right shoulder rotator cuff
tear, a bicep tear, a labral tear, a SLAP tear, right hip impediment, injuries
to her cervical and lumbar spine, injuries to her left knee, bilateral wrist
and hands, and right forearm.
 
On February 9, 2023, Plaintiff underwent her first
Independent Medical Examination (IME) conducted by Dr. Ronald S. Kvitne, M.D.,
an orthopedic surgeon. During this examination, Dr. Kvitne assessed Plaintiff's
various injuries, including those related to her cervical and lumbar spine.
 
However, Defendant argues that Dr. Kvitne, who is not a
spine surgeon, lacks the requisite expertise to fully evaluate spinal injuries.
Consequently, Defendant has filed a motion to compel Plaintiff to undergo a
second IME. This examination would be conducted by Michael Weinstein,
M.D., who specializes in spinal injuries, to examine
Plaintiff’s injuries to her cervical and lumbar spine.
 
 
SUMMARY
 
Moving Paper: Despite the initial examination of Plaintiff's
cervical and lumbar spine by an orthopedic surgeon, Defendant requests a second
examination by a spine surgeon. This request stems from the belief that a
specialist in spinal injuries is necessary to accurately assess and diagnose
the Plaintiff's cervical and lumbar conditions.
 
Opposition: Defendant seeks a second examination of the
cervical and lumbar spine, areas already examined on February 9, 2023. The
initial examination included a review of medical records, X-rays, MRIs, and a
physical assessment of both the cervical and lumbar spine, resulting in
specific diagnoses and prognoses.
 
Reply: Dr. Kvitne, the orthopedic surgeon who conducted the
initial examination does not specialize in spinal injuries. Defendant argues
that distinct and specialized examinations of these injuries are crucial for a
comprehensive defense. A specialist in spinal injuries is needed to accurately
evaluate the legitimacy of Plaintiff's neck and back complaints and to
determine their direct link to the incident in question.
 
 
ANALYSIS
 
Legal Standard 
 
C.C.P. §2032.220(a) provides, as follows:¿ 
In any case
in which a plaintiff is seeking recovery for personal injuries, any defendant
may demand one physical examination of the plaintiff, if both of the following
conditions are satisfied:¿ 
(1)¿The
examination does not include any diagnostic test or procedure that is painful,
protracted, or intrusive.¿ 
(2)¿The
examination is conducted at a location within 75 miles of the residence of the
examinee.¿ 
 
C.C.P. §2031.310 provides, as follows:¿ 
(a)¿If any party desires to obtain discovery by a physical
examination other than that described in Article 2 (commencing with¿Section 2032.210), or by a mental examination,
the party shall obtain leave of court.¿ 
(b)¿A motion for an examination under subdivision (a) shall
specify the time, place, manner, conditions, scope, and nature of the
examination, as well as the identity and the specialty, if any, of the person
or persons who will perform the examination. The motion shall be accompanied by
a meet and confer declaration under¿Section 2016.040.¿ 
(c)¿Notice of the motion shall be served on the person to
be examined and on all parties who have appeared in the action.¿ 
 
C.C.P. §2032.320(a) provides, as
follows: “The court shall grant a motion for a physical or mental examination
under¿Section 2032.310¿ for good cause shown.”¿ 
 
Good
cause generally requires a showing both of relevancy to the subject matter and
specific facts justifying discovery:¿ i.e., allegations showing the need for
the information sought and lack of means for obtaining it elsewhere.¿(Vinson v. Superior Court
(1987) 43 Cal. 3d 833, 840.) The requirement of a court order following a showing of
good cause is doubtless designed to protect an examinee's privacy interest by
preventing an examination from becoming an annoying fishing expedition (Id.)


1.      Discussion
 
a.       Meet
and confer requirement 
 
In
the motion, the Defendant asserts that they have fulfilled the meet and confer
obligation, as evidenced by an accompanying meet and confer declaration.
Furthermore, the Plaintiff does not contest this in their opposition.
 
b.      Good
cause for the second IME
 
The court shall grant a motion
for a physical or mental examination under¿Section 2032.310¿only for good cause shown.”¿ Generally, to find
“good cause,” the court requires a showing of both: (1) relevancy to the
subject matter of the litigation; and (2) specific facts justifying the
discovery, e.g., allegations showing the need for the information sought and
lack of means for obtaining the information elsewhere. (Vinson v. Superior
Court (1987) 43 Cal. 3d 833, 840.) The
requirement of a court order following a showing of good cause is doubtless
designed to protect an examinee's privacy interest by preventing an examination
from becoming an annoying fishing expedition (Id.)
Defendant
contends that Dr. Kvitne, who conducted the initial Independent Medical
Examination (IME), lacks specialization in spinal surgery. This concern does
not extend to any allegation of Dr. Kvitne's inability to properly assess the
cervical or lumbar spine, nor does it suggest that his examination was below
professional standards. The issue raised centers solely on the fact that Dr.
Kvitne is not a specialized spinal surgeon. Despite this, Defendant requests a
further examination by Dr. Weinstein, which involves assessments that are
generally within the purview of an orthopedic surgeon, such as visual and
physical evaluations of the cervical and lumbar spine and Plaintiff’s
movements.
Plaintiff
alleges a series of injuries, including those to the cervical and lumbar spine,
rendering the examination of these areas pertinent. However, Defendant's
rationale for seeking a second Independent Medical Examination (IME) by Dr.
Weinstein, grounded in his specialization in spinal surgery, fails to demonstrate
good cause for a second evaluation.
The
examination proposed by Dr. Weinstein, detailed in the motion (Motion at pg.
8), closely mirrors the assessments conducted by Dr. Kvitne on February 9,
2023. Notably, the components of Dr. Weinstein's examination that are specific
to his specialty, like evaluating the flexion, extension, strength, and
movement of the cervical and lumbar spine, have already been comprehensively
addressed by Dr. Kvitne (Richardson Declaration ¶18-20; Exhibit A).
Furthermore, Dr. Kvitne provided detailed diagnoses and prognoses based on his
assessment (Id. ¶ 29-30; Exhibit A). 
It thus appears that the information needed is already available to
Defendant.  
The
Defendant's reliance on cases such as Vinson v. Superior Court (1987) 43
Cal. 3d 833, 840 and Shapira v. Superior Court (1990) 224 Cal.App.3d
1249, 1254-1255 does not adequately support the request for a second IME given
that those cases do not directly address the issue of a significantly similar
second examination. Considering the substantial similarity between the
examinations conducted by Dr. Kvitne and those proposed by Dr. Weinstein, the
Defendant has not shown good cause for a second examination.
That all
said, the Court is denying the request without prejudice so that Defendant can,
if such information exists, provide further information, perhaps through a
declaration by Dr. Weinstein, as to what is needed that Dr. Weinstein will be
able to provide that is different from what Dr. Kvitne provided.   
CONCLUSION AND ORDER 
Defendant’s
Motion for An Order Compelling
Plaintiff Anna Granucci To Submit To A Second Independent Medical Examination
is hereby DENIED without prejudice.
