 
BACKGROUND
 
The Complaint was
filed on December 15, 2021, alleging two causes of action: 1) general
negligence and 2) premises liability. This personal injury case stems from a
slip and fall incident that occurred on December 21, 2019, wherein Plaintiff
Delia Ramirez alleges that Defendants Tarzana Treatment Center and Mokhtar
Zhoobin failed to properly maintain the property, leading to her slip/trip and
fall on a flight of stairs due to a dangerous condition on the premises.
 
On October 30, 2023,
Defendant Tarzana served Plaintiff with the first set of Requests for Admission
(RFAs) electronically. (Mayers Decl. ¶ 4). The responses were due by December
1, 2023. Plaintiff did not request an extension prior to the December 1, 2023,
deadline. (Mayers Decl. ¶ 7). Defendants served responses filled with only
objections on December 11, 2023. (Mayers Decl. ¶ 6, Exhibit C of Mayers Decl.).

 
 
ANALYSIS
 
I.          Request for Admissions
 
“Any party may obtain discovery . .
. by a written request that any other party to the action admit the genuineness
of specified documents, or the truth of specified matters of fact, opinion
relating to fact, or application of law to fact. A request for admission may
relate to a matter that is in controversy between the parties.”  CCP §
2033.010.  “Within 30 days after service of requests for admission, the
party to whom the requests are directed shall serve the original of the
response to them on the requesting party, and a copy of the response on all
other parties who have appeared . . . .”  CCP § 2033.250(a).
 
If a party to whom request for
admissions are served fails to provide a timely response, the party to whom the
request was directed waives any objections, including based on privilege or the
work product doctrine. CCP § 2033.280(a). The requesting party can move for an
order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters
specified in the request be deemed admitted, as well as for monetary sanctions.
CCP § 2033.280(b). The court shall issue this order unless the party to whom
the request was made serves a response in substantial compliance prior to the
hearing on the motion. CCP § 2033.280(c).
 
The parties do not dispute the following
facts: 1) Defendant's first set of Requests for Admission (RFAs) were served
electronically on October 30, 2023; 2) the deadline for the responses was
December 1, 2023, but none were produced; 3) no extension were sought before
the December 1, 2023 deadline; 4) Defendant served responses comprised of
solely objections on December 11, 2023. 
 
It is undisputed that the initial
responses were not served within the timeframe required by CCP § 2033.250(a),
thus failing to meet the deadline for a timely response. Pursuant to CCP §
2033.280(a), this failure results in the waiver of any objections, including
those based on privilege or the work-product doctrine.
 
Given this failure to provide
timely responses, the Movant is entitled to file a motion for an order deeming
the RFAs admitted and to request monetary sanctions in accordance with CCP §
2033.280(b). Such an order is mandated unless the party to whom the request was
directed serves a response in substantial compliance with CCP § 2033.220 prior
to the motion's hearing. CCP § 2033.280(c). Although the Plaintiff served
responses on December 11, 2023, these were comprised solely of objections and
thus did not represent a substantial compliance with CCP § 2033.220, which
requires a verified response in the form of either an admission, a denial, or a
statement of lack of knowledge sufficient to admit or deny.
 
Plaintiff's contention that an Informal
Discovery Conference is required is not well taken, as the authority cited by
Plaintiff pertains to motions to compel further discovery responses. The
current motion concerns the failure to timely respond to RFAs, not the adequacy
of further discovery responses.  
 
Accordingly, Defendant’s
request to deem as admitted RFAs Set One is GRANTED
 
 
2.         Sanctions
 
            Sanctions are mandatory against
the party, the attorney, or both whose failure to serve a timely response to
the request necessitated the motion to deem request for admissions as admitted.
CCP § 2033.280(c).
 
Defendants’ moving papers request sanctions
in the amount of $2,445.00. This request is based upon the preparation of Motion
to Compel at a rate of $265.00 per hour for 4 hours, to review any Opposition
and to prepare a Reply brief at a rate of $265.00 per hour for 3 hours, and to
prepare for and attend the hearing at a rate of $265.00 per hour for 2 hours,
and CRS reservation fee of $60.00. (Mayers Decl. ¶ 16). 
 
Considering the length of the
opposition and the fact that no reply brief was filed, the requested sanctions
for attorney fees are adjusted accordingly. The time allocated for reviewing
the opposition and preparing for a reply, initially estimated at 3 hours, is
reduced to 1 hour. Additionally, the preparation for and attendance at the
hearing, previously estimated to require 2 hours, is now adjusted to 1 hour.
Thus, the total sanctions award is adjusted to $1650.00.
