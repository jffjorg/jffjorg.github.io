And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling from a judge regarding a future court hearing. The case involves a slip and fall incident that occurred on December 21, 2019, and a complaint was filed on December 15, 2021. The defendant, Tarzana Treatment Center and Mokhtar Zhoobin, served requests for admission (RFAs) on October 30, 2023, but the plaintiff, Delia Ramirez, failed to provide timely responses. The defendant is seeking to deem the RFAs admitted and is requesting sanctions.

The judge finds that the plaintiff's failure to provide timely responses waived any objections, including those based on privilege or the work-product doctrine, and that the defendant is entitled to file a motion for an order deeming the RFAs admitted. The judge grants the defendant's request and deems the RFAs admitted.

The judge also awards sanctions in the amount of $1650.00, which is reduced from the initial request of $2445.00. The sanctions are based on the preparation of the motion to compel and the time spent reviewing the opposition and preparing for the hearing.

The judge rejects the plaintiff's contention that an informal discovery conference is required, finding that the current motion concerns the failure to timely respond to RFAs, not the adequacy of further discovery responses.
