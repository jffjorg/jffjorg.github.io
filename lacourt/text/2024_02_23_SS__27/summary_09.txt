And here is the English summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving a slip and fall incident on December 2, 2021, in which the Plaintiff, Anna Granucci, sustained multiple injuries. The Defendant has moved to compel the Plaintiff to undergo a second Independent Medical Examination (IME) to assess her cervical and lumbar spine injuries, arguing that Dr. Kvitne, the orthopedic surgeon who conducted the initial IME, lacks the expertise to fully evaluate spinal injuries. However, the Judge has denied the motion without prejudice, stating that the Defendant has not shown good cause for a second IME. The Judge notes that the examination proposed by Dr. Weinstein, the spine surgeon, closely mirrors the assessments conducted by Dr. Kvitne and that the information needed is already available to the Defendant. The motion is denied, but the Judge leaves the door open for the Defendant to provide further information as to what is needed that Dr. Weinstein will be able to provide that is different from what Dr. Kvitne provided.
