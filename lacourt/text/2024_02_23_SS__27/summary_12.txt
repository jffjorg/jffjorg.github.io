And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion for summary judgment. The defendant, BKM Office Environments, Inc., argued that it cannot be held liable for the alleged negligence in installing an overhead cabinet that injured the plaintiff, Julie Lawlor, because it did not directly install the cabinet and is not vicariously liable for the actions of its independent contractor, Leaders of Furniture.

The judge found that while the defendant presented some evidence that it did not directly install the cabinet, it also presented evidence that it was involved in the installation process, including providing materials and supervising the installation. The judge concluded that this evidence raises a triable issue of fact regarding the defendant's involvement in the installation and whether it had a duty of care to the plaintiff.

The judge also noted that the plaintiff presented additional evidence that raises disputes over material facts, including emails showing that the defendant had control over the installation process and the number of workers required for the installation. The judge concluded that these disputes also raise a triable issue of fact and that the defendant has not met its burden for summary judgment.

Therefore, the judge has denied the defendant's motion for summary judgment and the case will proceed to trial.
