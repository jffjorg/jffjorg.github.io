This is a tentative ruling in an employment action where the plaintiff, Gena Persons, seeks to compel further responses from the defendant, City of Pasadena, regarding her requests for production, sets two and three. The defendant has produced documents related to job opportunities and job descriptions, but the plaintiff argues that the production is incomplete and redacted. The defendant claims that all job opportunities are publicly available and has produced documents that can be accessed through the City's website. The plaintiff seeks additional information on job positions and job descriptions, as well as information on Katie Sullivan and Gena Person's work performance. The Court denies the motion as to set two and three, finding that the defendant's responses are sufficient and that the plaintiff can propound appropriate interrogatories for additional information. The Court also notes that the defendant's document production on litigation hold policy is incomplete and that the plaintiff should pose questions about the documents produced in the appropriate discovery vehicle.
