And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling on a motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication filed by the defendant, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, in an employment action brought by the plaintiff, Lisa Hollis. The plaintiff claims discrimination, retaliation, and failure to provide accommodations, while the defendant argues that there is no evidence of discriminatory motive and that the termination was due to budget cutting needs during the pandemic.

The court has reviewed the evidence and determined that there are triable issues remaining on the claims of discrimination, retaliation, and failure to provide accommodations. The motion for summary adjudication is denied as to these claims.

The court has granted the motion for summary adjudication as to the seventh cause of action, which alleges a violation of Labor Code Section 6401, because there is no private right of action under this section.

The court has denied the motion for summary adjudication as to the eighth cause of action, which alleges a violation of Labor Code Sections 6310-6311, because there is some minimal evidence that the plaintiff's termination could have been motivated by her complaint about COVID-19 protocols.

In summary, the motion for summary adjudication is granted as to the seventh cause of action, but is otherwise denied. The court will issue a final ruling after considering any objections to this tentative ruling.
