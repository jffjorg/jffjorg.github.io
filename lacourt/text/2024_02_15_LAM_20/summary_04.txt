And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that Defendant Rosecrans Avenue Property, LLC has successfully demonstrated that Plaintiffs Claudia Maravel and Isaura Alvarez have failed to comply with the Court's order to provide discovery responses. As a result, the Judge is imposing terminating sanctions, effectively dismissing the pleadings of the Plaintiffs with respect to the Defendant. The Judge is not awarding additional monetary sanctions. The ruling is based on California discovery law, which authorizes a range of penalties for conduct amounting to "misuse of the discovery process." The Judge concludes that the Plaintiffs' failure to comply with the discovery order is a willful and intentional act, and therefore, the terminating sanction is justified.
