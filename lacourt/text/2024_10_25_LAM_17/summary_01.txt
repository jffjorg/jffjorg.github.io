And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiffs' motion to set aside the order sustaining the defendants' demurrer. The plaintiffs filed a first amended complaint on April 24, 2024, alleging breach of fiduciary duties, breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing, fraud, and unjust enrichment. The defendants' unopposed demurrer was sustained on May 23, 2024, and the plaintiffs are now seeking to set aside that order. The judge notes that the plaintiffs' counsel, Mainak D'Attaray, admitted fault in failing to oppose the demurrer, but the motion is deficient because it does not include a copy of the proposed pleading, i.e., the draft opposition to the demurrer. Despite the defendants identifying these deficiencies in an August 23, 2024, filing, the plaintiffs did not prepare any reply or supplemental materials. The judge concludes that the motion to set aside is denied.
