And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer and motion to strike filed by the defendants. The defendants have demurred to the second cause of action for fraud-intentional misrepresentation, arguing that the complaint does not state a cause of action. The court has sustained the demurrer with leave to amend, meaning that the plaintiff has the opportunity to revise the complaint to address the deficiencies identified by the court.

The court has also granted the defendants' motion to strike the request for punitive damages and attorney fees from the complaint. The court found that the plaintiff failed to allege sufficient facts to state a claim for punitive damages and that the request for attorney fees was not supported by statute or agreement.

The court has given the plaintiff 30 days to amend the complaint to address the deficiencies identified by the court. The defendants are required to give notice of the tentative ruling.
