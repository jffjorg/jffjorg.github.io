SUMMARY
OF ACTION
Plaintiff
Deyanira Serafin de Campos (Plaintiff) filed this personal injury action
against Defendant Gussie Jenkins (Defendant) on May 14, 2024 alleging a cause
of action for motor vehicle negligence. 
The complaint alleges Defendant’s reckless driving caused Plaintiff to
suffer injuries and damages.  
 
Plaintiff
propounded on Defendant her Requests for Production, Set One on June 27, 2024.  Defendant did not serve responses by November
5, 2024.  
 
On
November 5, 2024, Plaintiff filed this motion to compel initial responses to her
Requests for Production, Set One. 
Defendant filed an opposition on November 21, 2024.  Plaintiff replied on November 25, 2024.  
 
Summary of Arguments
Plaintiff
argues the Court should grant this motion because Plaintiff granted Defendant
four (4) extensions to provide responses, but Defendant did not comply.  (Lingenfelter Dec., Esq., ¶¶ 3-6.)  Plaintiff also requests $1,310.00 in
sanctions against Defendant and Defendant’s counsel because Plaintiff gave
Defendant and her counsel a full and fair opportunity to submit responses
through multiple meet and confer efforts. 
(Lingenfelter Dec., ¶ 8.) 
 
In
opposition, Defendant argues it served its complete responses without
objections on November 18, 2024.  (Declaration
of Robert M. Yoakum, ¶ 4.)  Defendant’s
counsel, Robert M. Yoakum, claims the Defendant’s responses were late because
Yoakum had trouble contacting Defendant. 
(Yoakum Dec., ¶ 2.)  Defendant did
not understand that Yoakum represented her through her insurance company.  (Yoakum Dec., ¶¶ 2-3.)  After several emails and phone calls,
Defendant returned Yoakum’s phone messages. 
(Ibid.)  Defendant argues
Plaintiff’s sanctions request is excessive. 

 
In
reply, Plaintiff argues that even though Defendant served responses, the
responses contain an objection to request number 5. Defendant waived all
objections by failing to comply with four extension deadlines.  Plaintiff also asserts that her sanctions
request is not excessive.
 
Plaintiff’s Meet and Confer Attempts
Plaintiff
propounded on Defendant her Requests for Production, Set One on June 27,
2024.  (Declaration of Ernest J.
Lingenfelter, ¶ 3 Exh. 1.)  On July 31,
2024, Plaintiff’s counsel, Ernest Lingenfelter, inquired about responses, and
Defendant requested an extension to respond. 
(Lingenfelter, Esq., ¶ 4, Exh. 2.) 
Plaintiff granted an extension to respond by September 4, 2024.  (Ibid.)  Defendant did not serve responses by the
September 4th deadline.  Plaintiff
granted another extension to September 25, 2024.  Defendant did not serve responses by September
25th.  
 
On
September 26, 2024, Lingenfelter emailed Defendant’s counsel, Robert Yoakum, a
meet and confer letter requesting responses no later than October 3, 2024.  (Lingenfelter Dec., ¶ 5, Exh. 4.)  The letter also stated that Defendant waived
any objections due to Defendant’s failure to comply with the previous extension
deadlines.  (Lingenfelter Dec., ¶ 5, Exh.
4.)  Yoakum responded stating a family
medical emergency arose and requested another extension.  (Ibid.)  Plaintiff granted a two-week extension but
did not receive responses.  
 
Lingenfelter
attempted to meet and confer via email on October 14, 2024 and requested
responses without objection by October 18, 2024.  (Lingenfelter Dec., ¶ 6, Exh. 6.)  Yoakum replied he would follow up with
Lingenfelter later, but he never did.  
 
ANALYSIS
A
demanding party may move to compel responses to requests for production where
the responding party fails to provide any responses.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2031.300, subd. (b),
2030.290, subd. (b).)  The demanding
party must show the requests were properly served, that the time to respond
expired, and no response has been served. 
(Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific
Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th
390, 403-404.)  
 
The
responding party must respond separately to each demand by agreeing to comply,
stating an inability to comply, or objecting to all or part of the demand.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.210, subd. (a).)  The responding party must serve responses
within 30 days after the requests for production are served or according to an
agreed upon deadline extension.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2031.260, subd. (a)(1)-(3).) 

 
Failing
to respond within statutory time limits waives objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a).)  The court
may relieve the responding party of waiver if the responding party subsequently
served substantially compliant responses, and the party’s failure to serve
timely responses was due to mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.  (Ibid.; City of Fresno v. Superior
Court (1988) 205 Cal.App.3d 1459, 1467 [applying the same standards as
defaults under section 473, subdivision (b)].) 

 
Defendant
served responses to Plaintiff’s Requests for Admissions, Set One on November
18, 2024.  The Court notes that Defendant
did not attach a copy of its responses or a proof of service to its
opposition.  However, because Plaintiff
attached a copy of the responses to her reply and does not dispute that the
responses were served on November 18th, the Court deems them served.
 
Request
number 5 states: “All service records for any vehicle involved in the alleged
INCIDENT other than a vehicle containing the Plaintiff, since such vehicle was
first acquired by Defendant in this action to the date of the alleged INCIDENT.”  (Motion to Compel, Exh. 1, at p. 2.)
 
Defendant’s
response reads as follows:  
 
This request is
not calculated to lead to admissible evidence. Responding defendant does not
contend that there was a malfunction. In addition, after a diligent search and
a reasonable inquiry, it has been determined that Responding party is no longer
in possession, custody or control of any documents responsive to this demand.
 
(Plaintiff’s
Reply, Exh. 1, at p. 3.)
 
Although
Defendant’s supporting declaration states the delayed responses were due to Defense
counsel’s inability difficulty contacting Defendant, Defendant does not argue
this occurred due to pleads “mistake, inadvertence, and excusable neglect.”  Thus, Defendant has waived all objections to
Plaintiff’s Requests for Production, Set One. 

 
Additionally,
the Court strikes the following statements from Defendant’s response to request
number 5: “This request is not calculated to lead to admissible evidence.
Responding defendant does not contend that there was a malfunction.” Defendant
states this is not an objection, but it is clear the purpose behind these
statements is to voice Defendant’s discontent with the category of documents
sought and Defendant’s belief that the category is not relevant.  (See Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.240, subd.
(b)(1)-(2) [“[Objections must] [i]dentify with particularity any document,
tangible thing, land, or electronically stored information falling within any
category of item in the demand to which an objection is being made; [and] (2) [s]et
forth clearly the extent of, and the specific ground for, the objection.”].)  Defendant provides no legal basis for these
statements and the Court strikes them from Defendant’s response.  
 
The
Court finds that after striking these two statements, Defendant’s responses
satisfy sections 2031.240, 2031.230, and 2031.210.  
 
The Court denies Plaintiff’s
request to compel responses. 
 
Sanctions
The court must issue sanctions against any party who
“unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response
to a demand for inspection . . . unless, it finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.480,
subd. (j).)  The court may also award
monetary sanctions “ordering that one engaging in the misuse of the discovery
process, or any attorney advising that conduct, or both pay the reasonable
expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that
conduct.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030,
subd. (a).)  Misuses of discovery include
“[f]ailing to respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery” or
failing to meet and confer in person, telephonically, or by letter.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subds. (d),
(i).) 
 
Plaintiff requests sanctions in the amount of $1,310.00
against Defendant and Defendant’s counsel.  Defendant opposes Plaintiff’s request as
excessive and challenges the validity of the Lingenfelter Declaration.  
 
The Court notes that Plaintiff granted Defendant
several extensions over the past four (4) months. Defendant’s failure to comply
with these extensions was a misuse of discovery which led to Plaintiff
expending time and resources, including filing this motion, in order to receive
the discovery requested.  Accordingly,
the Court imposes sanctions against Defendant and her counsel.
 
Plaintiff’s counsel charges an hourly rate of
$250.00.  (Lingenfelter Dec., ¶ 8.)  The request includes the following: (1) 3
hours researching, drafting, and preparing this motion and the moving papers
($750.00); (2) 1 hour to review the opposition and draft a reply ($250.00); (3)
1 hour to appear remotely at the motion hearing ($250.00); and (4) a $60.00
filing fee.  (Ibid.)
 
The hourly rate is reasonable, but the time spent on
this motion is unreasonable.  This is a basic
motion to compel initial responses to requests for production.  The Court reduces the hours spent preparing
this motion to 2 hours.  
 
Accordingly, the Court grants Plaintiff’s request in
the reduced amount of $1,060.00: (1) 2 hours preparing this motion; (2) 1 hour
reviewing the opposition and drafting the reply; (3) 1 hour to attend motion
hearing; and (4) a $60.00 filing fee.
