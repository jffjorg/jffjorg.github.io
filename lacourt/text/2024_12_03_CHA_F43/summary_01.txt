And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted, in part, the motion to file a fourth amended complaint by the plaintiffs. The amended complaint will add new factual allegations and legal theories regarding the alter ego liability of the Newegg defendants and PDQ Pickup LLC. The judge has denied the request to add Jacob Joey Sanchez as an alter ego of the Newegg defendants.

The judge has ordered the plaintiffs to file and serve their fourth amended complaint within five days of the date of the order. The defendants have 20 days from service to respond.

The judge has also noted that the proposed amendments will not cause unnecessary delay or prejudice the defendants, and that the parties have six months to complete discovery and prepare for trial.

The judge has relied on California law and case precedent in making this ruling, including the Code of Civil Procedure and the California Vehicle Code. The judge has also considered the parties' arguments and evidence presented during the motion hearing.
