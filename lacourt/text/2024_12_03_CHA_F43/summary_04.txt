And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the plaintiff's motion to compel initial responses to requests for production. The plaintiff had requested that the defendant serve responses to the requests by November 5, 2024, but the defendant did not comply. The plaintiff granted the defendant multiple extensions, but the defendant still failed to serve responses.

The judge finds that the defendant has waived all objections to the requests for production and that the defendant's responses are substantially compliant with the requests. The judge also finds that the plaintiff's request for sanctions in the amount of $1,310.00 is excessive and reduces the amount to $1,060.00.

The judge awards the plaintiff $1,060.00 in sanctions against the defendant and her counsel for their failure to comply with the extensions and for the inconvenience and expense caused to the plaintiff as a result. The judge orders the defendant and her counsel to pay the sanctions to the plaintiff's counsel within 20 days.
