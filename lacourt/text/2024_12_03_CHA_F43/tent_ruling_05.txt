MOTION TO CONFIRM ARBITRATION AWARD
 
MOVING
PARTY: Weissman Law Firm and I. Donald Weissman
RESPONDING
PARTIES: Plaintiffs Natasha Robinson and David Maxim
 
RELIEF
REQUESTED
Court order confirming arbitration award and
judgment following binding arbitration.
 
RULING: The Court
grants the petition and confirms
the arbitration award of $9,996.39. 
 
SUMMARY OF ACTION
Weissman Law Firm and I. Donald Weissman
represented Natasha Robinson and David Maxim (plaintiffs) in a premises
liability and personal injury action, under a contingency fee Retainer
Agreement.  In November 2022, the Court
granted Weissman’s motion to withdraw as counsel over plaintiffs’ opposition.  
 
The
case proceeded to trial, and the Court entered judgment for Plaintiffs.  
 
In
December 2022, Weissman filed and served
an Attorney’s Lien against any judgment in the case for attorney’s fees and costs,
based upon the Retainer Agreement between Weissman, Robinson, and Maxim.  The Court denied Plaintiffs’ ex parte
application challenging the lien but granted their request to strike expert witness
fees.
 
Weissman
then demanded that Plaintiffs reimburse the costs of litigation pursuant to the
Retainer Agreement in the amount of $9,996.39. 
Plaintiffs did not make payments. 
 
Plaintiffs
filed a petition with the San Gabriel
Valley Bar Association to arbitrate their dispute.  Arbitration occurred by videoconference on
July 10, 2024; the Arbitrator awarded Weissman $9,996.39 on August 23,
2024.  Weissman served notice of the
award on Plaintiffs on August 31, 2024.
 
Plaintiffs
petitioned to correct or vacate the award; the petition was denied on September
24, 2024.
 
Weissman
filed a petition to confirm the
arbitration award and judgment on October 18, 2024.  Plaintiffs oppose the petition.  No reply has been filed.
 
 
 
 
 
Summary
of Arguments
Weissman
moves to confirm the arbitration award issued August 23, 2024 and a judgment.  
 
In
opposition, plaintiffs argue the Court should vacate the award because the
Arbitrator’s misconduct substantially prejudiced their rights by postponing the
arbitration hearing and showing preferential treatment for Weissman.  The Arbitrator also incorrectly calculated
the award amount and claimed he never received a substantial portion of Plaintiffs’
original exhibits.  The Arbitrator also
never responded to Robinson’s concerns and email inquiries.
 
Plaintiffs
also argue that the denial of their petition to vacate or correct the
arbitration award was procedurally deficient because Weissman served the
opposition and proof of service to the petition via email without all parties
first consenting to electronic service. 
Even though the San Gabriel Arbitration rules state that proofs of
service must be mailed, the Program allowed Weissman to email his opposition.
 
In
the alternative, if the Court still deems the arbitration award is justified,
respondents assert the Court should correct the arbitration award by
determining what fees petitioner is entitled to, removing the attorney’s lien
dated December 20, 2022, and awarding reasonable fees to Plaintiffs from the defendants
in this case.  The arbitration award
includes fees not allowed under Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5 such as
expert fees.  Plaintiffs also challenge the
adequacy of Weissman’s work on their behalf.
 
ANALYSIS
“Any
party to an arbitration in which an award has been made may petition the court
to confirm, correct or vacate the award.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1285.)  The petition must state the substance, or
attach copies of the arbitration agreement, the award, and any written opinion.
 (Code Civ. Proc., § 1285.4.)  The petitioner must serve the petition between
10 days and 4 years from the date the award was served on the petitioner.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1288, 1288.4.)  The other party may respond to the petition.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1285.2.) 
 
“If
a petition or response under this chapter is duly served and filed, the court
shall confirm the award as made, whether rendered in this state or another
state, unless in accordance with this chapter it corrects the award and
confirms it as corrected, vacates the award or dismisses the proceeding.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1286.)  The court may
not vacate or correct an award unless a petition or response requesting that
the award be vacated or corrected has been duly served and filed.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1286.4 &
1286.8.)  
 
“Once
a petition to confirm an award is filed, the superior court must select one of
only four courses of action: It may confirm the award, correct and confirm it,
vacate it, or dismiss the petition. [Citation.]”  (EHM Productions, Inc. v. Starline Tours of
Hollywood, Inc. (2018) 21 Cal.App.5th 1058, 1063.)  “If an award is confirmed, judgment shall be
entered in conformity therewith.”  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 1287.4.)  
 
 
The
court may not review “the merits of the dispute, the sufficiency of the
evidence, or the arbitrator’s reasoning, nor may we correct or review an award
because of an arbitrator’s legal or factual error, even if it appears on the
award’s face. Instead, we restrict our review to whether the award should be
vacated under the grounds listed in section 1286.2. [Citations.]”  (Roehl
v. Ritchie (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 338, 347.)  “Absent proof of one of the five grounds
contained in section 1286.2, a court may not vacate an award for legal or
factual error even if the error clearly appears on the face of the award and it
causes substantial injustice.”  (Luster
v. Collins (1993) 15 Cal.App.4th 1338, 1344.)   
 
The
court may vacate an arbitration award if it determines: 
 
(1) The
award was procured by corruption, fraud or other undue means;
(2) There
was corruption in any of the arbitrators;
(3) The
rights of the party were substantially prejudiced by misconduct of a neutral
arbitrator;
(4) The
arbitrators exceeded their powers and the award cannot be corrected without
affecting the merits of the decision upon the controversy submitted;
(5) The
rights of the party were substantially prejudiced by the refusal of the
arbitrators to postpone the hearing upon sufficient cause being shown therefor
or by the refusal of the arbitrators to hear evidence material to the
controversy or by other conduct of the arbitrators contrary to the provisions
of this title; and
(6) An
arbitrator making the award either: (A) failed to disclose within the time
required for disclosure a ground for disqualification of which the arbitrator
was then aware; or (B) was subject to disqualification upon grounds
specified in Section 1281.91 but failed upon receipt of timely demand
to disqualify himself or herself as required by that provision. However, this
subdivision does not apply to arbitration proceedings conducted under a
collective bargaining agreement between employers and employees or between
their respective representatives.
 
(Code
Civ. Proc., § 1286.2, subd. (a); Roehl v. Ritchie (2007) 147
Cal.App.4th 338, 347.) 
 
            Timeliness of the Petition
“Any
party to an arbitration in which an award has been made may petition the court
to confirm, correct or vacate the award.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1285.)  The petition must state the substance, or
attach copies of the arbitration agreement, the award, and any written opinion.
 (Code Civ. Proc., § 1285.4.)  The petitioner must serve the petition between
10 days and 4 years from the date the award was served on the petitioner.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1288, 1288.4.)  The other party may respond to the petition.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1285.2.) 
 
The award was made
on August 23, 2024 and served on Weissman on August 27, 2024.  Weissman filed and served this petition on October
18, 2024, more than 10 days after August 27, 2024, but 4 years before August
24, 2028. 
 
The petition is
timely.
 
 
            Service
of the Petition and Notice of Hearing
The petitioner
must serve the petition and notice of the hearing on the respondent “in the
manner provided in the arbitration agreement for the service of such petition
and notice” or “[i]f the arbitration agreement does not provide the manner in
which such service shall be made . . . [s]ervice within this State shall be
made in the manner provided by law for the service of summons in an action.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 1290.4, subd. (a), (b).)¿¿ 
 
Weissman filed the
petition, notice of hearing, and proof of service on October 18, 2024.  The proof of service reflects that Weissman served
Robinson the petition and notice of hearing to Robinson via email on that same
date.  
 
Service of the
petition and notice of hearing was proper.
 
            Confirmation of Arbitration Award
An arbitration
award is not directly enforceable until it is confirmed by a court and judgment
is entered.¿ (Code Civ. Proc.,  § 1287.6;
Jones v. Kvistad (1971) 19 Cal.App.3d 836, 840.)
 
On the merits, the
court must confirm the award as made, unless it corrects or vacates the award,
or dismisses the proceeding.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 1286; Valsan Partners
Limited Partnership v. Calcor Space Facility, Inc. (1994) 25 Cal.App.4th
809, 818.)  The petition must:¿ 
 
(a)  
Set
forth the substance of or have attached a copy of the agreement to arbitrate
unless the petitioner denies the existence of such an agreement.¿ 
(b)  
Set
forth the names of the arbitrators.¿ 
(c)  
Set
forth or have attached a copy of the award and the written opinion of the
arbitrators, if any.¿ 
 
(Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 1285.4.)  
 
Weissman’s
petition includes copies of the arbitration opinion and  award,  along with the ruling on Plaintiffs’ petition
to correct or vacate the arbitration award. 
(Weissman Dec., Exhs. A, B.) The petition does not include the
arbitrator’s name, but his  attached
exhibits identify Alex Hartounian as the arbitrator.  
 
Weissman  also
failed to attach  a copy of the
arbitration agreement to his petition.    However,  neither
party disputes the agreement’s existence, and  and Plaintiffs attached a copy of the arbitration
agreement to  their opposition.  The court may therefore reach the merits of
Weissman’s petition.  (See Puccinelli
v. Nestor (1956) 145 Cal.App.2d 48, 50.) 
 
Plaintiffs’
opposition to the petition  raises factual
 issues that  must be supported by admissible evidence.  However, Robinson’s declaration does not authenticate
or lay the foundation for any of Plaintiffs’ attached exhibits.  Because these exhibits are inadmissible,
Robinson’s opposition lacks evidentiary support.  (See Dept. of Human Resources v. Int’l
Union of Operating Engineers (2020) 58 Cal.App.5th 861, 882; Code Civ.
Proc., § 1290.2.)  Additionally, although
 Plaintiffs cite the applicable code
sections,  they cite no  case authority to support  their arguments and likewise fail to discuss
or analyze  those issues.   The Court therefore finds no grounds for
denying the petition to confirm the arbitration award.  
 
CONCLUSION
The Court grants
Weissman’s petition and confirms the arbitration award of $9,996.39.
