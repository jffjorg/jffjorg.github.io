SUMMARY
OF ACTION
Plaintiff
Chinyere Valerie Ibe (Plaintiff) filed this insurance discrimination action,
pro per, against Defendants Bamboo Insurance Services, Inc. Bamboo Ide8
Insurance Services, Inc., Sutton National Insurance Company, American Leak
Detection, Inc., 818 Restoration, Specialized Investigation, AKA Command
Investigations, LLC, and Does 1-10.
 
On
March 25, 2024, Plaintiff filed her first amended complaint (FAC) alleging
causes of action for: (1) Breach of the Duty of Good Faith and Fair Dealing;
(2) Bad Faith Denial of Insurance Claim; (3) Breach of the Contractual Duty to
Pay a Covered Insurance Claim; (4) Intentional Misrepresentation; (5)
Violations of Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code §§ 17200, et. seq.; (6) Unjust
Enrichment; and (7) Defamation. 
 
On
July 11, 2024, this Court sustained the demurrers of Defendants Sutton National
Insurance Company and 818 Restoration and Construction, LLC to Plaintiff’s
Fourth, Fifth, and Seventh causes of action with leave to amend and to her
Sixth Cause of Action without leave to amend.  Plaintiff’s Second Amended Complaint (SAC) was
due on August 12.  Instead of filing her
SAC, on that date she filed her first request for an extension of time to file
the SAC, with a hearing set for November 8. 
 
On
August 19, 2024, this Court sustained the demurrer of Bamboo Ide8 Insurance
Services, LLC (Bamboo Ide8).
 The Court gave Plaintiff leave to amend
her First, Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth, and Seventh causes of action.  Plaintiff’s SAC was then due on Monday,
September 18, 2024. On Friday, September 16, 2024, Plaintiff filed her second
request for an extension of time to file the SAC, with a hearing date of
December 4.
 
On
October 1, 2024, the Court granted 818 Restoration and Bamboo Ide8’s ex parte
applications and dismissed them from the case because Plaintiff had not filed
her SAC.  On October 3, 2024, the Court
granted Sutton National’s ex parte application and dismissed it on the same
basis. 
 
On
November 8, 2024, the Court deemed Plaintiff’s first motion moot because the
parties had been dismissed and the time to file the SAC had passed.  
 
The
Court also deems the second motion moot.  Plaintiff’s SAC was due on August 12, 2024,
but she instead filed this motion for more time to do so.  As a result, Sutton and 818 Restoration have
been dismissed from the action.
