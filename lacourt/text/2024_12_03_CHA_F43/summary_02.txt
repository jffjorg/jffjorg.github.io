And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

This is a tentative ruling on a motion for a second extension to file a Second Amended Complaint. The plaintiff, Chinyere Valerie Ibe, is seeking an extension until December 9, 2024, to file the SAC. However, the court deems the motion moot because the plaintiff failed to file the SAC multiple times and as a result, some of the defendants have been dismissed from the case. The court also notes that the plaintiff's first motion for an extension was deemed moot on November 8, 2024, and this second motion is similarly moot.
