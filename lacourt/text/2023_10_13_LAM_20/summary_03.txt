And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to compel responses to form interrogatories and production of documents. The plaintiff, Heang Krouch, failed to timely respond to the defendant's discovery requests, citing unforeseen circumstances, including the robbery of his attorney's office. The judge is sympathetic to the attorney's situation but notes that timely responses were not provided. The judge has ordered Krouch to provide responses without objections within 20 days. The judge has also declined to award sanctions at this time, considering the circumstances.
