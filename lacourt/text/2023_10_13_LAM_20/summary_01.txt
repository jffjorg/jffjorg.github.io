And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling denies the plaintiff's request for default judgment without prejudice. The plaintiff had requested a judgment of $9,735,110.08, consisting of damages, special damages, interest, costs, and attorney fees. The court found that the plaintiff failed to comply with certain requirements, including requesting dismissal of Does 1-10 and providing evidence of the defendants' wealth. The court also noted that an award of punitive damages requires evidence of the defendants' wealth, but found that the plaintiff's argument had merit given the aim of punitive damages to punish wrongdoing and protect the public from future misconduct. The court denied the request for default judgment, but instructed the plaintiff to give notice.
