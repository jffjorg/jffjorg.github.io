And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling issued by Judge Kevin C. Brazile denies the motion to consolidate and stay cases brought by Plaintiffs Tailor Kelly, et al. against Defendant Witmer Manor Partners, LP. The motion was defective due to the cases not being deemed related, and the Notice of Motion was not filed in one of the cases. The Court also sustained Defendant's evidentiary objections to the Declaration of Christian Oronsaye and granted Defendant's request for judicial notice.
