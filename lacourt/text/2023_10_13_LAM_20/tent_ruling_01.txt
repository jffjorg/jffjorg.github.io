BACKGROUND
On November 5, 2021, Plaintiff Shahla
Melamed (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Defendants Gabrijel Krstanovic
aka Gabriel Krstanovic, David Davutoglu, Vasel Malota, Seaside Construction
Management Company, LLC, 511 Seaward LLC, and Does 1 through 10 (collectively
“Defendants”) arising out of an alleged loan Plaintiff made to Defendants.
Plaintiff alleges causes of action for (1) breach of oral contract; (2) fraud;
(3) negligent misrepresentation; (4) money lent or paid; (5) money had and
received; and (6) financial elder abuse. 
On August 8, 2023, the Court granted
Plaintiff’s unopposed motion for terminating sanctions against Defendants.
Defendants’ answers were stricken and defaults were entered against them. 
            Before the Court is Plaintiff’s
Request for Court Judgment. 
DISCUSSION
            Code of Civil Procedure section 585
permits a default judgment after a defendant’s default has been entered. California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1800(a) requires a party seeking default judgment by
court judgment to use the mandatory Request for Entry of Default
(Application to Enter Default) (form CIV-100) and to file: “(1) Except in unlawful
detainer cases, a brief summary of the case identifying the parties and the
nature of plaintiff's claim; (2) Declarations or other admissible evidence in
support of the judgment requested; (3) Interest computations as necessary; (4)
A memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) A declaration of nonmilitary
status for each defendant against whom judgment is sought; (6) A proposed form
of judgment; (7) A dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought
or an application for separate judgment against specified parties under Code of
Civil Procedure section 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each
judgment; (8) Exhibits as necessary; and (9) A request for attorney fees if
allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.”
            Plaintiff
request a total judgment of $9,735,110.08, consisting of damages in the
amount of $3,700,000.00 as demanded in the complaint,[1]
special damages in the amount of $5,000,000.00, interest in the amount of
$838,328.90, costs in the amount of $730.00, and attorney fees in the amount of
$196,051.18. (Form CIV-100, ¶¶ 2, 7; see also [Proposed]
Judgment, ¶ 6 and Melamed Decl., ¶¶ 7-12.) Plaintiff used mandatory form CIV-100 (which includes a
declaration of nonmilitary status (¶ 8)) and complied with some of the other
requirements of CRC, rule 3.1800(a). Plaintiff submitted a
[Proposed] Judgment on Form JUD-100, a declaration calculating the interest due
on the $3,700,000.00 (Mickelson Decl. ¶ 2),
and Plaintiff’s counsel has properly requested fees pursuant to Local
Rule 3.214(a), in the amount of $196,051.18 (2% of the amount of total damages
[principle, interest, costs, and punitive damages] over $100,000 [which is 2%
of $9,539,058.90 plus $5,270].)
However, Plaintiff’s request for default
judgment is DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE for the following reasons:
First,
Plaintiff has not requested dismissal of Does 1-10.
Second,
while Plaintiff served the requisite statement of damages or notice of punitive
damages to Defendant Gabrijel Krstanovic, there is no proof of service for the
remaining defendants. (See Code Civ. Proc., §§ 425.11(c), 425.115.) Thus,
Plaintiff fails to show that all Defendants were on notice of punitive damages
sought. Further, Plaintiff fails to provide evidence of Defendants’ wealth. An
award of punitive damages requires evidence as to the defendant’s wealth. (Devlin
v. Kearny Mesa AMC (1984) 155 Cal.App. 3d 381, 390; Adams v. Murakami
(1991) 54 Cal.3d 105, 118.) Plaintiff requests that the Court follow the line
of cases represented by Cummings Med. Corp. v. Occupational Med. Corp.
(1992) 10 Cal.App. 4th 1291, 1298, which held that “where the defendant has
been guilty of fraud, punitive damages may properly be based on evidence of the
profitability of the defendant’s misconduct.” Here, fraud was the second cause
of action alleged against Krstanovic and Seaside, which they have now defaulted
to. (See First Amended Complaint)
The
Court finds Plaintiff’s argument to have merit given the aim of punitive
damages. “The purpose of punitive damages ‘is to punish wrongdoing and thereby
to protect [the public] from future misconduct, either by the same defendant or
other potential wrongdoers.’ (Adams v. Murakami (1991) 54 Cal.3d 105,
110, 284 Cal.Rptr. 318, 813 P.2d 1348.)” (Cummings Medical Corp. v.
Occupational Medical Corp. (1992) 10 Cal.App.4th 1291, 1298.) “As the court
in Adams recognized, the key question before the reviewing court is not ‘what
is the defendant’s net worth?’ Rather, the question is ‘whether the amount of
damages “exceeds the level necessary to properly punish and deter.” ’ (Id.,
at p. 110, 284 Cal.Rptr. 318, 813 P.2d 1348, citations omitted.)” (Id.
at p. 1299.) Thus, an punitive damages may be awarded based on evidence of the
profitability of the Defendants’ misconduct. 
Notwithstanding,
the default judgment is denied for the foregoing reasons. 
CONCLUSION
Plaintiff’s
Request for Default Judgment is DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.
 
Plaintiff to give notice.
