BACKGROUND
            On July 26, 2023, Plaintiffs Tailor
Kelly; Harlee Thames (suing by her guardian ad litem, Tailor Kelly); and
Deliylahs Thames (suing by her guardian ad litem, Tailor Kelly) filed a
complaint against Defendant Witmer Manor Partners, LP arising out of
Plaintiffs’ tenancy with the apartment buildings owned by Defendant. Plaintiffs
allege the following causes of action: (1) Breach of Implied Warranty of
Habitability; (2) Negligence; (3) Nuisance; (4) Breach of Quiet Enjoyment; (5)
Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress; (6) Unruh Civil Rights Act, Civil
Code section 51; (7) Anti-Harassment Statute, Cal. Civ. Code section 1940.2;
and (8) Illegal or Wrongful Eviction. 
            On August 4, 2023, Plaintiffs filed
a notice of related case of Witmer Manor Partners, LP v. Tailor Kelly (case
no. 23STUD08317). 
            On July 26, 2023, Plaintiffs filed
the instant motion to relate, consolidate and stay of cases pending hearing of
motion to consolidate. 
            On August 25, 2023, the Court deemed
the subject cases: 23STCV17595 and 23STUD08317 as not related because the
benefits of relation were not apparent for these types of cases. (See Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.300(a).)
            On October 2, 2023, Defendant filed
an opposition to the instant motion.
            On October 6, 2023, Plaintiffs filed
a reply. 
DISCUSSION
“When
actions involving a common question of law or fact are pending before the
court, it may order a joint hearing or trial of any or all the matters in issue
in the actions; it may order all the actions consolidated and it may make such
orders concerning proceedings therein as may tend to avoid unnecessary costs or
delay.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 1048, subd. (a).) The purpose of consolidation is to
enhance trial court efficiency by avoiding unnecessary duplication of evidence
and the danger of inconsistent adjudications. (See Todd-Stenberg v. Dalkon
Shield Claimants Trust (1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 976, 978-979.) 
This
motion is defective for two reasons. First, the cases are not deemed related. “Cases
may not be consolidated unless they are in the same department. A motion to
consolidate two or more cases may be noticed and heard after the cases,
initially filed in different departments, have been related into a single
department, or if the cases were already assigned to that department.” (Super.
Ct. L.A. County, Local Rules, rule 3.3(g)(1).) The Case No. 23STUD08317,
captioned Witmer Manor Partners, LP v. Tailor Kelly is in Department 93
and Case No. 23STCV17595, captioned Tailor Kelly, et al. v. Witmer Manor
Partners, LP is in Department 20. Further, this Court deemed the cases not
related. 
Second,
a Notice of Motion to consolidate cases must (1) include a list of all named
parties in each case, the names of those who have appeared, and the names of
their respective attorneys of record; (2) include the captions of all the cases
sought to be consolidated; and (3) be filed in each case sought to be
consolidated. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.350(a)(1).) The Notice of
Motion was not filed in Case No. 23STUD08317.
Evidentiary
Objections
Defendant’s
evidentiary objections to the Declaration of Christian Oronsaye is sustained in
full on the grounds that the testimony lacks foundation.
Request
for Judicial Notice
Defendant’s
request for judicial notice is granted in full. 
CONCLUSION
Accordingly,
the Motion to consolidate is DENIED.
Moving
party to give notice. 
            If counsel do not submit on the
tentative, they are strongly encouraged to appear by LACourtConnect rather than
in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
