BACKGROUND
            On November 17, 202l, Plaintiffs
Heang Krouch, Tieng Uch, Bryan Tamoriabowen, Luzmila Villalobos, Jeffrey
Marduce, Emad Sukkar, and Robert Gooch (collectively “Plaintiffs”) filed the
First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) against Defendant PR2020, LLC (“Defendant” or
“PR2020”).
            On May 1, 2023, the Court sustained
Defendant’s unopposed demurrer to the FAC.
            On May 2, 2023, Plaintiffs filed the
Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”) against Defendant alleging (1) breach of
contract, (2) breach of written contract, and (3) breach of the implied
covenant of good faith and fair dealing.
            On August 23, 2023, Defendant filed
the instant motions to compel responses to Form Interrogatories (“FROGS”) and
Requests for Production of Documents (“RPDs”) by Plaintiff Heang Krouch
(“Krouch”).
            On October 5, 2023, Krouch filed an
opposition to both motions.
            On October 9, 2023, PR2020 filed a
reply to both oppositions.
DISCUSSION
            PR2020 requests for an order
compelling Krouch to produce responses to FROGS, Set One and RPDs, Set One. 
            Although Krouch’s oppositions were
untimely filed, the Court in its discretion will consider all moving,
opposition, and reply papers.
Krouch
states he will provide responses and that there has been a delay due to
unforeseen circumstances which happened to his counsel. Krouch’s counsel states
that his house was robbed on July 20, 2023, that he is a solo practitioner, and
that as a result of files being lost, he had to rebuild all my files from
scratch, including calendars with all deadlines, any documents that he had been
drafting (such as the discovery responses to PR2020’s discovery requests).
(Sherman Decl. ¶¶ 4-9.) 
The
Court is sympathetic to attorney Sherman’s situation, however, timely responses
have not been provided. Further, Krouch provides no reason why he did not ask
for a further extension or respond to PR2020’s counsel’s email on August 8,
2023 regarding the overdue responses. Thus, the Motions are granted. Responses,
without objections, are to be provided within twenty days. 
The
Court declines to award sanctions at this juncture since the robbing of
attorney Sherman’s house constitutes a circumstance that would make the
imposition of the sanction unjust.
 
CONCLUSION
Accordingly,
the Motion to Compel FROGS and RPDs are GRANTED. 
Moving
party to give notice. 
            If counsel do not submit on the
tentative, they are strongly encouraged to appear by LACourtConnect rather than
in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
