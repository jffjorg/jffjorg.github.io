Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge will hear the matter on January 10, 2025. The Plaintiff, Michele Edison, filed a motion to compel the four defendants to respond to written discovery requests. The Plaintiff served the discovery requests on November 7, 2024, but the defendants failed to provide timely responses. In their opposition, the defendants stated that they served responses concurrently with their opposition, but did not attach a copy of the verified responses. The Judge notes that the Court cannot rule on the motion without determining whether all discovery responses have been provided.

The Judge also notes four other issues: (1) the defendants' complaint that the Plaintiff failed to meet and confer prior to filing the motion, which is not required; (2) the defendants' request for relief from waiver of objections, which is not properly before the Court; (3) the Plaintiff's complaint that the responses provided are not code compliant, which the Court makes no ruling on; and (4) the Plaintiff's failure to file separate motions for each discovery request, which the Court orders the Plaintiff to pay the additional 11 filing fees.

The Judge will hear from counsel to determine whether the defendants have unsuccessfully opposed the motion and whether sanctions are warranted.
