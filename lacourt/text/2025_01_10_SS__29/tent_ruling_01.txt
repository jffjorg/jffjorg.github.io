  Case Number:  21STCV31342    Hearing Date:   January 10, 2025    Dept:  29 Castro v. Cousseau 
21STCV31342
Motion to be Relieved as Counsel, filed by Plaintiff’s Counsel Albert Abkarian
& Associates.
 
Tentative
The motion is denied without prejudice.
Background
On August 24, 2021, Krystal Renee Castro,
Victor Andres Avila, Brisstelle Avila, and Viktor Amias Avila filed a complaint
against Thomaz Phillip Cousseau, Nissan North America Inc., and Rebecca Diane
Mullin (collectively “Defendants”) for negligence arising out of an automobile
collision on July 18, 2020.
On October 26, 2021, Defendants filed an
answer.
On December 23, 2024, Albert Abkarian & Associates (“Counsel”) filed a
motion to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff Krystal Renee Castro
(“Plaintiff”). No opposition has been filed. 
Legal
Standard
The court may order that an attorney be changed or
substituted at any time before or after judgment or final determination upon
request by either client or attorney and after notice from one to the other.
(Code of Civ. Proc., § 284(b).) An attorney is permitted to withdraw where
conflicts between the attorney and client make it unreasonable to continue the
representation. (See Cal. Rules of Prof. Conduct 3-700(C)(1).) “The
determination whether to grant or deny a motion to withdraw as counsel lies
within the sound discretion of the trial court.” (Manfredi & Levine v.
Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128, 1133.)   
 
An application to be relieved as counsel must be made on
Judicial Counsel Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion) (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1362(a)), MC-052 (Declaration) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.136(c)), and MC-053 (Proposed Order) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362(e)).   
 
Further, the requisite forms must be served on the client
and all other parties who have appeared in the case. (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.1362(d).) The court may delay effective date of the order relieving
counsel until proof of service of a copy of the signed order on the client has
been filed with the court. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(e).) 
 
Discussion
Counsel has
filed the Notice, Declaration, and Order to be Relieved as Counsel. However, proof
of service of this motion shows service on December 23, 2024. This service is
untimely as to Plaintiff who was required to be served by mail. (Code of Civ.
Proc., § 1005, subd. (b).)   Proper service should have been performed by no later
than December 12, 2024: 16 court days prior to the hearing plus 5 days for mail
service.
Accordingly, the
motion is DENIED without prejudice.
Conclusion
The motion to be
relieved as counsel is DENIED without prejudice.
Moving counsel
to give notice.
