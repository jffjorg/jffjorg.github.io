22STCV07478
Defendant’s Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings 
 
Tentative
The motion is granted.
Background
On March 1, 2022, Jose Guevara (“Plaintiff”) filed a
complaint against Alireza Shapoury (“Defendant”) and Does 1 through 100,
asserting causes of action for negligence and premises liability arising out of
an injury that allegedly occurred while plaintiff was performing yardwork for
Defendant on June 30, 2020.
 
On May 15, 2023, Defendant filed an answer. 
 
On October 5, 2023, Plaintiff filed a Notice of
Settlement of Entire Case.
 
On July 29, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel was relieved as
attorney of record. 
 
On November 21, 2024, the Court set the trial for March
3, 2025.  On the same date, the Court
granted Defendant’s motion to deem Plaintiff to have admitted the truth of the
matters specified in Requests for Admission (Set One).
 
On December 5, 2024, Defendant filed this motion for
judgment on the pleadings, along with a request for judicial notice. 
 
No opposition has been filed.
 
Legal Standard
A
defendant may move for judgment on the pleadings when the “complaint does not
state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action against that defendant.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 438, subd. (c)(1)(B)(ii).) 
“A motion for judgment on the
pleadings performs the same function as a general demurrer, and hence attacks
only defects disclosed on the face of the pleadings or by matters that can be
judicially noticed. Presentation of extrinsic evidence is therefore not proper
on a motion for judgment on the pleadings.”  (Cloud v. Northrop Grumman
Corp. (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 995, 999.)  “The standard for granting a motion
for judgment on the pleadings is essentially the same as that applicable to a
general demurrer, that is, under the state of the pleadings, together with
matters that may be judicially noticed, it appears that a party is entitled to
judgment as a matter of law.”  (Bezirdjian v. O'Reilly (2010) 183
Cal.App.4th 316, 321-322; accord Los Angeles Unified School
Dist. v. Torres Construction Corp. (2020) 57 Cal.App.5th 480,
494; Templo v.
State (2018) 24
Cal.App.5th 730, 735; Schabarum v. California Legislature (1998) 60
Cal.App.4th 1205, 1216; see also 1 Weil & Brown, California Practice Guide:
Civil Procedure Before Trial [2024] ¶ 7:275.)
 
Discussion
Plaintiff
asserts causes of action for negligence and premises liability. The basic elements of a
cause of action for negligence and for premises liability are the same: (1) the
existence of a legal duty;
(2) breach of that duty; (3) causation; and (4) resulting damages. (Brown
v. USA Taekwondo (2021) 11 Cal.5th 204, 213; Kesner v. Superior Court (2016) 1 Cal.5th 1132, 1158; Castellon v. U.S. Bancorp
(2013) 220 Cal.App.4th 994, 998.)
Defendant now moves for judgment on the pleadings.  The motion is based on the prior order of the
Court deeming Plaintiff to have admitted the truth of the matters specified in
Defendant’s Request for Admission (Set One).
In ruling on a motion for judgment on the pleadings, the Court is
limited to the material on the face of the pleadings and materials that are
judicially noticeable.  “[A]dmissions
or concessions of matters which cannot be reasonably be controverted are
properly considered on a motion for judgment on the pleadings.”¿ (Evans v.
California Trailer Court (1994) 28 Cal.App.4th 540, 549.)¿¿In ruling on a
motion for judgment on the pleadings, a court “may consider matters which may
be judicially noticed, including a party’s admissions or concessions which can
not reasonably be controverted.”  (Pang
v. Beverly Hospital (2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 986, 989-90.)  As the Court of Appeal stated in Del E.
Webb Corp. v. Structural Materials Co. (1981) 123 Cal. App. 3d 593, 604-05,
“The court will take judicial notice of records such as admissions, answers to
interrogatories, affidavits, and the like, when considering a demurrer, only
where they contain statements of the plaintiff or his agent which are
inconsistent with the allegations of the pleading before the court.”  
The Court takes judicial notice of its ruling on November 21, 2024,
granting Defendant’s motion for a deemed-admitted order.  “[A] deemed admitted order establishes, by
judicial fiat, that a nonresponding party has responded to the requests by
admitting the truth of all matters contained therein.” (Wilcox v.
Birtwhistle (1999) 21 Cal.4th 973, 979.) 
Accordingly, Plaintiff is deemed to have admitted the truth of the
following: 
(1)  
REQUEST
FOR ADMISSION NO. 1: Admit YOU have no facts to support YOUR cause of action
for Negligence, as asserted in YOUR Complaint. 
(2)  
REQUEST
FOR ADMISSION NO. 2: Admit YOU have no facts to support YOUR cause of action
for Premises Liability, as asserted in YOUR Complaint.
(3)  
REQUEST
FOR ADMISSION NO. 3: Admit YOU have no witnesses to support YOUR cause of
action for Negligence, as asserted in YOUR Complaint.
(4)  
REQUEST
FOR ADMISSION NO. 4: Admit YOU have no witnesses to support YOUR cause of
action for Premises Liability, as asserted in YOUR Complaint.
(5)  
REQUEST
FOR ADMISSION NO. 5: Admit YOU have no DOCUMENTS to support YOUR cause of
action for Negligence, as asserted in YOUR Complaint.
(6)  
REQUEST
FOR ADMISSION NO. 6: Admit YOU have no DOCUMENTS to support YOUR cause of
action for Premises Liability, as asserted in YOUR Complaint.
(7)  
REQUEST
FOR ADMISSION NO. 7: Admit YOU were not injured in the INCIDENT that occurred
on June 30, 2020, at the PREMISES as alleged in YOUR Complaint.
(8)  
REQUEST
FOR ADMISSION NO. 8: Admit Defendant Alireza Shapoury is not liable for YOUR
alleged damages, as alleged in YOUR Complaint.
(9)  
REQUEST
FOR ADMISSION NO. 9: Admit YOU have no damages as a result of the INCIDENT that
occurred on June 30, 2020,
at the PREMISES as alleged in YOUR Complaint.
(10)                  
REQUEST
FOR ADMISSION NO. 10: Admit Defendant Alireza Shapoury did not cause any
damages to YOU as a result of the INCIDENT that occurred on June 30, 2020, at
the PREMISES as alleged in YOUR Complaint.
(Exh. 1.)
Plaintiff’s admissions are
inconsistent with the allegations in the complaint as to the elements of the causes
of action for negligence and premises liability.  If the “proponent of the demurrer has shown
that he has conclusively negated a necessary element of plaintiffs’ cause of
action, thereby demonstrating that there is no factual basis for relief on any
theory reasonably contemplated by the pleadings,” then the demurrer must be
sustained.¿ (Sher v. Leiderman (1986) 181 Cal. App. 3d 867, 885-86.)¿ As
discussed above, the standard as to a demurrer equally applies to a motion for
judgment on the pleadings.¿ 
Because Plaintiff admitted (or is
deemed to have admitted) that he was not injured, that he has no damages, and
that Defendant is not liable, the causes of action in Plaintiff’s complaint fail
to state sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action.  
Accordingly, Defendant’s motion for judgment on the pleadings
is granted.
Plaintiff has not opposed the motion or sought leave to
amend.  Moreover, given the admissions,
there is no likelihood that Plaintiff could amend to state sufficient facts to
constitute a cause of action.  The motion
is granted without leave to amend.
Conclusion
The Court GRANTS
Defendant’s motion for judgment on the pleadings without leave to amend.
Moving Party is ORDERED to give notice.
