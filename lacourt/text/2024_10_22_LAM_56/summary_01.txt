```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has considered the motion filed by the Plaintiff, Daniel Lopez, for leave to amend pleadings, which is actually a request to add to the exhibit list. The Court notes that the motion was filed late, without proof of service, and that the Respondent, Women's Twentieth Century Club of Eagle Rock, filed an opposition. Despite these issues, the Court has decided to deny the motion, citing the principles of providing meaningful access to the courts for self-represented litigants. The Judge suggests that the parties may still add to the exhibit list, but notes that the Court will rule on the admissibility of each exhibit as it is introduced.
