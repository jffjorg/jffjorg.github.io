Here is a summary in English text:

The judge has granted the motion of In Hospitality, LLC to file a first amended complaint, add new defendant parties, and continue the trial. The motion was filed on January 29, 2024, and the judge has given In Hospitality, LLC seven days to file its proposed amended pleading. The judge found that In Hospitality, LLC substantially complied with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1324, and that there is no prejudice to any party. However, the judge is concerned about the risk of prejudice to both parties and non-parties if the motion is granted. The judge notes that adding new defendants within thirty days of trial would pose a significant risk of prejudice to those new defendants, and that adding a new claim with allegations of new conduct would also pose a significant risk of prejudice to the existing defendants. The judge has granted the motion despite these concerns, as it is in the furtherance of justice and would allow the parties to resolve all disputed matters in the same lawsuit.
