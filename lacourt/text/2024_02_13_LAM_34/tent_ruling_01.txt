  Case Number:  21STCV18889    Hearing Date:   February 13, 2024    Dept:  34 SUBJECT:        Motion for
Approval of PAGA Settlement
 
Moving Party: Plaintiff
Phillip Hamlin and Non-Party Efrain Cervantes 

Resp. Party:    None  
 
 
The Motion to Approve PAGA Settlement is DENIED without prejudice.  
 
PRELIMINARY COMMENTS:
 
        Plaintiff’s counsel seems to believe
that this case has been consolidated with Cervantes v. Mike Thompson
Recreation Vehicles, 19STCV31754.  It
has not.  Efraim Cervantes is not a party
to this action.  Therefore, settling this
case will have no effect on any proposed settlement in the Cervantes
action.  Further, since Cervantes is not
a party to this action, it is not clear to the Court that the settlement of
this case should even mention Cervantes. The Proposed Settlement Agreement
needs to be revised so that it pertains only to this case.
 
        Further, the Court wishes to advise the
parties that any monies not awarded the parties, their attorneys or the
administrator are expected to be re-allocated to the Aggrieved Employees.
 
 
BACKGROUND:
 
        On May 19,
2021, Plaintiff Phillip Hamlin filed his Complaint against Defendants Mike
Thompson Recreational Vehicles and Mike Thompson Recreational Vehicles, Colton
on a cause of action for violation of the Labor Code Private Attorneys General
Act of 2004 (“PAGA”).     
 
        On September
20, 2021, Defendants filed their respective Answers. 
 
        On October 21,
2022, the Court compelled arbitration of Plaintiff’s individual PAGA claims but
denied dismissal of the representative PAGA claims. 
 
        On January 12,
2024, Plaintiff filed Stipulation to Consolidate Actions for All Purposes. The
Stipulation contained a proposed order. The Stipulation would have consolidated
Case No. 19STCV31754 (a case pending before Department SS12, brought by Efrain
Cervantes) and Case No. 21STCV18889 (this case, pending before Department 34,
brought by Phillip Hamlin). 
 
        On January 12,
2024, the Clerk’s Office rejected the Stipulation because the two cases have
not been related. 
 
        On January 16,
2024, Plaintiff filed: (1) Motion for Approval of PAGA Settlement; (2)
Memorandum of Points and Authorities; (3) Declaration of Phillip Hamlin; (4)
Declaration of Efrain Cervantes; (5) Declaration of Fawn F. Bekam; (6) Proposed
Order; and (7) Certificate of Service. 
 
        On January 19,
2024, refiled the items previously filed on January 16, 2024. 
 
ANALYSIS:
 
I.         
Legal Standard
 
“This part shall be known and may be
cited as the Labor Code Private Attorneys General Act of 2004.” (Lab. Code, §
2698.)
 
“Notwithstanding any other provision
of law, any provision of this code that provides for a civil penalty to be
assessed and collected by the Labor and Workforce Development Agency or any of
its departments, divisions, commissions, boards, agencies, or employees, for a
violation of this code, may, as an alternative, be recovered through a civil
action brought by an aggrieved employee on behalf of himself or herself and
other current or former employees pursuant to the procedures specified in
Section 2699.3.” (Lab. Code, § 2699, subd. (a).)
 
In bringing an action pursuant to the Labor Code Private Attorneys
General Act of (2004) (“PAGA”), “the aggrieved employee acts as the proxy or
agent of state labor law enforcement agencies, representing the same legal right
and interest of those agencies, in a proceeding that is designed to protect the
public, not to benefit private parties.” (Amalgamated Transit Union, Local
1756, AFL-CIO v. Super. Ct. (2009) 46 Cal.4th 993, 1003, citations
omitted.)
 
        PAGA
claims, as well as settlements of PAGA claims, involve multiple statutory
requirements. (Lab. Code, § 2699, et seq.)
 
II.      
Discussion
 
The Court considers below the various statutory requirements of PAGA, as
well as whether the settlement meets the fair, reasonable, and adequate
standard.

“For cases filed on or after July 1,
2016, the aggrieved employee or representative shall, within 10 days following
commencement of a civil action pursuant to this part, provide the Labor and
Workforce Development Agency with a file-stamped copy of the complaint that
includes the case number assigned by the court.” (Lab. Code, § 2699, subd.
(l)(1).)
 
“The superior court shall review and
approve any settlement of any civil action filed pursuant to this part. The
proposed settlement shall be submitted to the agency at the same time that it
is submitted to the court.” (Lab. Code, § 2699, subd. (l)(2).)
 
2.         
Discussion
 
Plaintiff filed causes of action for various labor code violations,
including violations of Labor Code sections 201 through 204, 510, 1194, 1198,
and others. These sections are covered by Labor Code section 2699.5, and thus
the pre-complaint notice requirement to the Labor Workforce Development Agency
(LWDA) applies here. (Lab. Code, § 2699.3, subd. (a).)
 
Plaintiff’s Counsel declares that Plaintiff sent a notice letter to the
LWDA on September 13, 2019. (Decl. Bekam, ¶ 3 and Exh. 1.) Notably, this
initial notice letter to the LWDA only included claimant Efrain Cervantes. (Ibid.)
Plaintiff’s Counsel then sent an amended notice letter to LWDA on February 4,
2021, which included Plaintiff (Phillip Hamlin). (Decl. Bekam, ¶ 4 and Exh. 2.)
The Court finds that this meets the notice requirement under Labor Code
sections 2699.3 and 2699.5. 
 
Plaintiff’s Counsel provides evidence that the notice letter to LWDA on
February 4, 2021 included a copy of a first amended complaint for a different
case (Case No. 19STCV31754), but not a copy of the complaint filed in this
matter. (Decl. Bekam, Exh. 2.) The Court does not have sufficient
evidence to find that Plaintiff has sufficiently satisfied the notice
requirement under Labor Code section 2699, subdivision (l)(1).
 
Plaintiff’s Counsel provides email evidence of submission of a copy of
the proposed settlement to LWDA at the same time that it submitted the proposed
settlement to the Court. (Lab. Code, § 2699, subd. (l)(2); Decl. Bekam, ¶ 9 and
Exh. 4.) The Court finds that this meets the notice requirement under Labor
Code section 2699, subdivision (l)(2).
 
B.         
The PAGA Settlement
 
1.         
Legal Standard
 
“For all
provisions of this code except those for which a civil penalty is specifically
provided, there is established a civil penalty for a violation of these
provisions, as follows: . . . (2) If, at the time of the alleged violation, the
person employs one or more employees, the civil penalty is one hundred dollars
($100) for each aggrieved employee per pay period for the initial violation and
two hundred dollars ($200) for each aggrieved employee per pay period for each
subsequent violation.” (Lab. Code, § 2699, subd. (f)(2).)
 
“For purposes of this part, whenever
the Labor and Workforce Development Agency, or any of its departments,
divisions, commissions, boards, agencies, or employees, has discretion to
assess a civil penalty, a court is authorized to exercise the same discretion,
subject to the same limitations and conditions, to assess a civil penalty.”
(Lab. Code, § 2699, subd. (e)(1).)
 
“In any action by an aggrieved
employee seeking recovery of a civil penalty available under subdivision (a) or
(f), a court may award a lesser amount than the maximum civil penalty amount
specified by this part if, based on the facts and circumstances of the
particular case, to do otherwise would result in an award that is unjust,
arbitrary and oppressive, or confiscatory.” (Lab. Code, § 2699, subd. (e)(2).)
 
“Except as provided in subdivision
(j), civil penalties recovered by aggrieved employees shall be distributed as
follows: 75 percent to the Labor and Workforce Development Agency for
enforcement of labor laws, including the administration of this part, and for
education of employers and employees about their rights and responsibilities
under this code, to be continuously appropriated to supplement and not supplant
the funding to the agency for those purposes; and 25 percent to the aggrieved
employees.” (Lab. Code, § 2699, subd. (i).)
 
“Except as provided in paragraph
(2), an aggrieved employee may recover the civil penalty described in
subdivision (f) in a civil action pursuant to the procedures specified in
Section 2699.3 filed on behalf of himself or herself and other current or
former employees against whom one or more of the alleged violations was
committed. Any employee who prevails in any action shall be entitled to an
award of reasonable attorney’s fees and costs, including any filing fee paid
pursuant to subparagraph (B) of paragraph (1) of subdivision (a) or
subparagraph (B) of paragraph (1) of subdivision (c) of Section 2699.3. Nothing
in this part shall operate to limit an employee’s right to pursue or recover
other remedies available under state or federal law, either separately or
concurrently with an action taken under this part.” (Lab. Code, § 2699, subd.
(g)(1).)

Highlights of the Proposed PAGA Settlement
 
Among other things, the following are the highlights of the proposed PAGA
settlement:
 
(1)       Defendants will pay
a gross settlement amount of $450,000.00 (the “Gross Settlement Amount”). 
 
(2)       “PAGA Counsel” (who
are Plaintiff’s Counsel) will be paid up to one-third of the Gross Settlement
Amount (which would be $150,000.00) for fees. PAGA Counsel will also be paid up
to $30,000.00 (which is an additional 6.67% of the Gross Settlement Amount) in
expenses. Payment less than the amounts requested will be allocated to the
remainder of the “Net Settlement Amount” (which is the “Gross Settlement
Amount” minus these listed costs).  
 
(3)       CPT Group, Inc.
(the “Administrator”) will be paid up to $10,000.00, except for a showing of
good cause and as approved by the Court. This is 2.22% of the Gross Settlement
Amount. To the extent the Administration Expenses are less than $10,000.00 or
the Court approves payment less than $10,000.00, the remainder will be retained
in the Net Settlement Amount.
 
(4)       Plaintiff will be
awarded an individual settlement release payment of $10,000.00 (2.22% of the
Gross Settlement Amount), and that Non-Party Efrain Cervantes will be awarded
an individual settlement release payment of $45,000.00 (10% of the Gross
Settlement Amount). If the Court does not approve the individual settlement,
the Parties shall work in good faith to determine the value of the individual
settlement release that would be approved, however, it shall not permit
Plaintiff to withdraw from any individual settlement release. The remainder
will be placed in the Gross Settlement Amount. 
 
(5)       LWDA and the
Aggrieved Employees will receive 75% and 25%, respectively, of the remaining
$206,087.10.
 
 
(6)       There are estimated
to be 755 Aggrieved Employees who worked a total of 25,060 PAGA-relevant pay
periods. The Aggrieved Employees will receive payments from the Administrator
based on a division of the employee share of the PAGA penalties that is multiplied
by each employee’s number of PAGA-relevant pay periods. 
 
(7)       Aggrieved Employees
will have up to 180 days to cash their settlement checks, after which those
checks will be voided, and the funds represented by such checks will be sent to
the California Controller’s Unclaimed Property Fund in the name of the
Aggrieved Employee. 
 
(8)       Defendants have
agreed to not receive any reversion from the Gross Settlement Amount. 
 
(9)       The proposed PAGA
settlement also includes other terms, such as for distribution of the settlement
and release from claims.
 
(Decl. Bekam, Exh.
3.)
 
3.         
Attorneys’ Fees and Attorneys’ Costs
 
PAGA Counsel requests $150,000.00 in attorneys’ fees, which is one-third
of the Gross Settlement Amount. PAGA Counsel further requests $30,000.00 in
costs, which is an additional 6.67% of the Gross Settlement Amount. 
 
According to Plaintiff’s Counsel, they spent 248.9 hours on this matter.
(Decl. Bekam, ¶ 31.) The hours were incurred by six attorneys who are paid
between $500.00 per hour to $875.00 per hour. (Ibid.) Given the
information provided about each attorney, some of these hourly rates appear to
be inflated. (Id. at ¶¶ 18–29.) No invoices are provided that would
assist the Court in determining whether these hours were reasonably incurred.
In total, the amount of attorney’s fees claimed to have been incurred is
$168,820.00. 
 
The Court has not been provided with sufficient information to find that
this amount of attorney’s fees was reasonably incurred. The Court would like to
see invoices or other evidence in support of the hours and rates claimed. 
 
As to costs, the Court has reviewed the cost invoices provided and finds
that there has also been a significant amount of overbilling on costs. (Decl.
Bekam, Exh. 6.)
 
First, only $28,920.50 in costs were actually claimed ($27,245.10 in
costs for Efrain Cervantes and $1,675.40 for Phillip Hamlin), not $30,000.00.
(Decl. Bekam, Exh. 6.)
 
Second, this case has not been consolidated with any other case. Thus,
none of the costs associated with Efrain Cervantes are allowable. (Decl. Bekam,
Exh. 6, pp. 1–3.)
 
Finally, the Court did not order mediation in this case. Rather, the
Court only ordered the Parties’ respective counsel to meet and confer regarding
mediation. (See Minute Order dated October 21, 2021.) Thus, even if the Court
were to consolidate this matter, the Court declines to award mediation costs of
$21,650.00 for JAMS fees and mediation services. (Decl. Bekam, Exh. 6, pp.
1–2.) 
 
The Court will allow the $1,675.40 incurred for this case. The remaining
$28,324.60 that was allocated for costs in the settlement shall be retained in
the Net Settlement Amount.
 
4.         
PAGA Administrator Costs
 
PAGA Counsel requests that the Administrator be paid up to $10,000.00
(which is 2.22% of the Gross Settlement Amount) for expenses incurred in
administering the settlement.
 
The Court has not been provided with an invoice or declaration regarding
how this cost was calculated. 
 
Without further information, the Court cannot determine whether this
amount of costs for administering the settlement is reasonable. 
 
 
5.         
Remaining Civil Penalties for LWDA and Aggrieved
Employees
 
PAGA Counsel requests that LWDA and the Aggrieved Employees receive 75%
and 25%, respectively, of the Net Settlement Amount.
 
This division of the civil penalties is required pursuant to Labor Code
section 2699, subdivision i.
 
PAGA Counsel claim that the Net Settlement Amount is estimated to be
$206,087.10. The Court is unaware of how PAGA Counsel came to this specific
number and would like additional information. 
 
Moreover, the Net Settlement Amount will be larger given the reductions
to PAGA Counsel’s costs, and possibly to other costs. 
 
In any case, a division of 75% of the Net Settlement Amount to the LWDA
and 25% of the Net Settlement Amount to the Aggrieved Employees would be
appropriate, with any further savings being split similarly. 
 
6.         
Reversion of Funds
 
The settlement agreement gives Aggrieved Employees up to 180 days to cash
their settlement checks, after which those checks will be voided. Further, the
funds represented by such checks will be sent to California Controller’s
Unclaimed Property Fund.
 
        The Court finds that this would be
appropriate. 
 
7.         
Plaintiff’s Service Award
 
PAGA Counsel request that Phillip Hamlin (who is the plaintiff in this
matter) and Efrain Cervantes (who is not a party to this matter) obtain individual
settlement amounts. 
 
Each of these individuals has submitted a declaration in support of their
claims to the individual settlement amounts requested, which are $10,000.00 for
Phillip Hamlin (who declares he spent 25 hours working on this case and
believes he is owed much more than $10,000.00 for the hours he worked and was
not paid for, in addition to a claim of discrimination) and $45,000.00 for
Efrain Cervantes (who declares he spent 75 hours working on this case and
believes he is owed much more than $45,000.00 for the hours he worked and was
not paid for).
 
        Plaintiff Phillip Hamlin, a
non-attorney, is requesting $400 per hour for helping his attorneys.  The Court finds this “hourly rate” to be
unreasonable.  A more reasonable Service
Award would be $5,000.  If his attorneys
believe he should be reimbursed more than that for helping them, they can do so
out of their own attorney's fees award.
 
        Non-party Efrain Cervantes, a
non-attorney, is requesting $600 per hour for helping his attorneys.  However, Cervantes is not a party to this
action.  The Court does not understand
how it can approve a Service Award to him.
 
8.         
Notice of Release of Claims
 
PAGA Counsel provides a copy of the proposed notice to the Aggrieved
Employees. (Decl. Bekam, Exh. 5.)
 
The Court is not satisfied with the proposed notice. The Court would like
PAGA Counsel to submit a revised proposed notice, which should include (with
the capitalization, bolded font, and boxed formatting show below) the following
notice:
 



BY CASHING THIS
  CHECK, YOU ARE NOT GIVING UP ANY RIGHT TO SUE FOR ANY ALLEGED GRIEVANCES THAT
  YOU HAVE AGAINST MIKE THOMPSON RECREATIONAL VEHICLES AND ITS AFFILIATES



 
C.         
The Fair, Reasonable, and Adequate Standard
 
1.         
Legal Standard
 
The Court of Appeal has held “that a trial court
should evaluate a PAGA settlement to determine whether it is fair, reasonable,
and adequate in view of PAGA’s purposes to remediate present labor law
violations, deter future ones, and to maximize enforcement of state labor
laws.” (Moniz v. Adecco USA, Inc. (2021) 72 Cal.App.5th 56, 77,
citations omitted.)
 
“Despite the fact that a
representative action under PAGA is not a class action, and is instead a type
of qui tam
action, a standard requiring the trial court to determine independently whether
a PAGA settlement is fair and reasonable is appropriate. . . . Because many of
the factors used to evaluate class action settlements bear on a settlement’s
fairness—including the strength of the plaintiff's case, the risk, the stage of
the proceeding, the complexity and likely duration of further litigation, and
the settlement amount—these factors can be useful in evaluating the fairness of
a PAGA settlement.” (Moniz, supra, at pp. 76–77.)
 
2.         
Discussion
 
PAGA Counsel have provided a breakdown of the total potential penalties
possible, as well as a brief explanation of how they came to the settlement.
(Decl. Bekam, ¶¶ 13–15.)
 
The Court would like additional information on the settlement efforts
before the Court finds that this settlement meets the fair, reasonable, and
adequate standard. 
 
II.       
Conclusion
 
The Motion to Approve PAGA Settlement is DENIED without prejudice.
