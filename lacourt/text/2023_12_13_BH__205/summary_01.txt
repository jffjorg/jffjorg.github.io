And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion for reconsideration of the summary judgment granted in favor of the plaintiff. The defendant had claimed that the plaintiff failed to provide maintenance and repair services, which prevented him from providing dental services to his patients and resulted in a loss of over $300,000. However, the judge found that the defendant failed to present new or different facts or law to support his claim, and that he should have presented the evidence earlier. The judge also noted that the defendant had failed to show that he could not have presented the evidence earlier, and that he was required to submit admissible evidence in opposing a summary judgment. The judge concluded that the motion for reconsideration was denied because the court lacked jurisdiction to consider it after the entry of judgment in favor of the plaintiff.
