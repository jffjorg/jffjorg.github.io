And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling on the plaintiff's motion for leave to amend the complaint. The case involves a dispute between a homeowner and a homeowners' association over the association's failure to timely investigate and repair water damage to the homeowner's condominium unit. The plaintiff seeks to add new defendants, causes of action, and a new prayer for relief to the complaint. The Court grants the motion for leave to amend, finding that the amendments arise from the same basic facts as the original complaint and that there is no prejudice to the defendant. The Court also declines to consider the late-filed brief filed by the defendant.
