OPPOSING PARTIES


Defendants and Cross-Complainants California Physicians’
  Service dba Blue Shield of California and Blue Shield of California Life
  & Health Insurance Company



 
BACKGROUND
 
This case involves three
consolidated lawsuits in which Plaintiff Advanced Orthopedic Center, Inc.
(“Plaintiff” or “AOC”) brought claims against Defendants California Physicians’
Service dba Blue Shield of California and Blue Shield of California Life &
Health Insurance Company (“Defendants” or “Blue Shield”) for quantum meruit and
breach of implied contract, and Blue Shield’s cross-claims against AOC for
declaratory relief, relating to 31 patient claims.  
 
Following a bench trial, the Court
issued a statement of decision ruling in favor of Blue Shield as to all 31
patients at issue.  Judgment was entered
in favor of Blue Shield on August 25, 2023. 

 
On September 14, 2023, Blue Shield
filed a memorandum of costs, seeking $498,617, composed of $2,190 in filing and
motion fees; $33,303.90 in deposition costs; $26,974.88 in service of process fees;
$373,341.57 in witness fees; $27,788.87 in court reporter fees; $1,493.50 for
models, enlargements, and photocopies of exhibits; $549.40 in electronic
filing/service fees; and $32,974.88 in “other” costs, consisting of $32,378.88
for Trial Technician costs; $420 for attorney and trial staff lunches; and $176
in parking costs.
 
AOC now moves to tax Blue Shield’s
requested costs.  Blue Shield opposes the
motion and AOC replies.
 
At the hearing on April 25, the
Court continued the hearing to enable the parties to provide supplemental
briefing regarding the reasonableness of Blue Shield’s 998 offer and for
Plaintiff to address the completeness of its request for judicial notice.
 
Plaintiff subsequently filed a
supplemental brief and an Amended Request for Judicial Notice; Blue Shield
filed a supplemental opposition brief, a Request for Judicial Notice, and evidentiary
objections; and Plaintiff filed a supplemental reply and response to Blue
Shield’s evidentiary objections.
 
EVIDENCE
 
Blue Shield’s Objection to Nesbit
Decl. Filed with Original Reply Brief & Request for Judicial Notice Filed
Two Days After the Original Reply Brief
 
Blue Shield objects to the
Declaration of Alan Nesbit filed with AOC’s reply brief and to AOC’s “Response
to Evidentiary Objections to Declaration of Alan Nesbit,” which Blue Shield
characterizes as an improper sur-reply. 
Two days after the reply was filed, AOC also filed a “Request for
Judicial Notice in Response to Evidentiary Objections to Declaration of Alan
Nesbit” requesting judicial notice of various small claims judgments between
AOC and Blue Shield.
 
            The Court
does not generally consider reply evidence, as such deprives the opposing party
of a fair opportunity to respond.  (San
Diego Watercrafts, Inc. v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (2002) 102 Cal.App.4th
308, 316 [“due process requires a party be fully advised of the issues to be
addressed and be given adequate notice of what facts it must rebut in order to
prevail”]; see also Wall Street Network Ltd. v. New York Times Co.
(2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 1171.)  
 
            AOC argues
that because it challenged Blue Shield’s memorandum and put certain claimed
costs at issue, the burden shifted to Blue Shield to support its claimed costs,
and AOC was in no position to address those arguments until the reply.  Thus, AOC contends that the reply evidence
regarding the small claims cases should be allowed.
 
            The Court notes
that AOC raised the issue in its moving papers that Blue Shield’s settlement
offer was unreasonably low and made in bad faith.  Therefore, AOC had an obligation to raise the
issue of the small claims cases and to present evidence in connection with the
motion, which it did not do. 
 
            Therefore,
the Court sustains Blue Shield’s objection to the entire reply declaration of Alan
Nesbit as procedurally improper.  Because
the Court does not consider the reply declaration, it similarly does not
consider Blue Shield’s specific evidentiary objections to the reply declaration
or AOC’s responses to Blue Shield’s specific objections.  
 
For the same reasons, the Court also
denies AOC’s Request for Judicial Notice that was submitted two days after the
Reply brief was filed.
 
AOC’s Amended Request for
Judicial Notice
 
            AOC
requests the Court to take judicial notice of the following:
 
1. Case No. 22SMSC00298, Judgment entered June 22, 2022; 
2. Case No. 22SMSC00300, Judgment entered June 17, 2022;
3. Case No. 22SMSC00304, Judgment entered June 22, 2022; 
4. Case No. 22SMSC00307, Judgment entered June 17, 2022; 
5. Case No. 22SMSC00309, Judgment entered June 17, 2022; 
6. Case No. 22SMSC00312, Judgment entered June 17, 2022; 
7. Case No. 22SMSC00313, Judgment entered June 17, 2022; 
8. Case No. 22SMSC00352, Judgment entered September 16,
2022; 
9. Case No. 22SMSC00354, Judgment entered June 17, 2022; 
10. Case No. 22SMSC00357, Judgment entered April 29, 2022; 
11. Case No. 22SMSC00362, Judgment entered July 13, 2022; 
12. Case No. 22SMSC00365, Judgment entered July 19, 2022; 
13. Case No. 22SMSC00367, Judgment entered June 17, 2022; 
14. Case No. 22SMSC00369, Judgment entered June 17, 2022; 
15. Case No. 22SMSC00370,Judgment entered June 17, 2022; 
16. Case No. 22SMSC00371; Judgment entered June 17, 2022; 
17. Case No. 22SMSC00373, Judgment entered June 17, 2022; 
18. Case No. 22SMSC00374, Judgment entered June 17, 2022; 
19. Case No. 22SMSC00377, Judgment entered June 17, 2022;
and 
20. Case No. 22 SMSC00925, Judgment entered August 18, 2022.
 
Judicial notice may be taken of records of any court in this state.  (Evid. Code, § 452, subd. (d)(1).)  Because these documents are Court records, the
Court may take judicial notice of them. 
(Ibid.)   However, “while
courts are free to take judicial notice of the existence of each document in a
court file, including the truth of results reached, they may not take judicial
notice of the truth of hearsay statements in decisions and court files.  Courts may not take judicial notice of
allegations in affidavits, declarations and probation reports in court records
because such matters are reasonably subject to dispute and therefore require
formal proof.”  (Lockley v. Law Office
of Cantrell, Green, Pekich, Cruz & McCort (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 875,
882 [cleaned up].)  
 
Accordingly, the Court takes judicial notice not only of the existence of
the above judgments, but also the results reached and legal implications
thereof.

Blue Shield’s Request for Judicial Notice Filed with
Supplemental Opposition
 
            Blue Shield
requests the Court to take judicial notice of the following:
 
1. Docket for LASC Case No. 22SMSC00304 (Patient N.A.); 
2. Docket for LASC Case No. 22SMSC00377 (Patient K.A.);

            Similar to
AOC’s Amended Request for Judicial Notice, as explained above, the docket for
the above cases are all court records, and therefore the Court may take
judicial notice of them and their legal implications, but not of hearsay
statements contained therein.
 
LEGAL STANDARDS
 
“Except as otherwise expressly
provided by statute, a prevailing party is entitled as a matter of right to
recover costs in any action or proceeding.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1032, subd. (b).) 
“Prevailing party” includes, among other things, “a defendant where
neither plaintiff nor defendant obtains any relief, and a defendant as against
those plaintiffs who do not recover any relief against that defendant.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1032, subd. (a)(4).)
 
Code of Civil Procedure section
1033.5, subdivision (a) sets forth items that are allowable as costs. Allowable
costs under Section 1033.5 must be “reasonably necessary to the conduct of this
litigation rather than merely convenient or beneficial to its preparation” and
“reasonable in amount.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (c)(2)-(3).) “Items
not mentioned in [Section 1033.5] and items assessed upon application may be
allowed or denied in the court’s discretion.” (Id. at subd. (c)(4).)
 
On a motion to tax, “[i]f the items
appearing in a cost bill appear to be proper charges, the burden is on the
party seeking to tax costs to show that they were not reasonable or necessary.
On the other hand, if the items are properly objected to, they are put in issue
and the burden of proof is on the party claiming them as costs. Whether a cost
item was reasonably necessary to the litigation presents a question of fact for
the trial court and its decision is reviewed for abuse of discretion. However, because
the right to costs is governed strictly by statute a court has no discretion to
award costs not statutorily authorized.” (Ladas v. California State Auto.
Assn. (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 761, 774, internal citations omitted.) 
 
“The court’s first determination,
therefore, is whether the statute expressly allows the item, and whether it
appears proper on its face. If so, the burden is on the objecting party to show
them to be unnecessary or unreasonable.” (Nelson v. Anderson (1999) 72
Cal.App.4th 111, 131, internal citations omitted.)  The objecting party does not meet this burden
by arguing that the costs were not necessary or reasonable, but must present
evidence and prove that the costs are not recoverable.  (Litt v. Eisenhower Med. Ctr. (2015)
237 Cal.App.4th 1217, 1224; Seever v. Copley Press, Inc. (2006) 141
Cal.App.4th 1550, 1557.)
 
DISCUSSION
 
            Because
this case involves three consolidated cases, Blue Shield is a defendant,
cross-claimant, and plaintiff, and AOC is a plaintiff, cross-defendant, and
defendant.  Essentially, AOC sought
additional reimbursements from Blue Shield for care provided to various Blue
Shield insureds, and Blue Shield sought declaratory relief that the amounts
Blue Shield already paid AOC either equal or exceed the fair market value of
those services.  
 
            Regardless
of the parties’ statuses as “plaintiff” or “defendant,” Blue Shield prevailed
in every regard.  The judgment provided
that AOC takes nothing by way of its complaints and the Court declared that the
amount Blue Shield reimbursed Plaintiff either equals or exceeds the fair
market value of the services AOC provided.
 
            Thus, as
the party in whose favor judgment was entered following trial, Blue Shield is
the “prevailing party” and is generally entitled to recover its costs.   AOC does
not dispute that, but argues that certain costs Blue Shield seeks are
excessive.  Specifically, AOC challenges
the following costs:
 
(1)  
$280,247.05 in “expert witness fees;”
(2)  
$26,974.88 in process server fees for witnesses who
were not called to testify or deposed;
(3)  
Costs for exhibits not used at trial; and 
(4)  
$32,378.88 in miscellaneous costs for “live trial tech
assistance.”
 
Entitlement to Expert Witness
Fees
 
            Expert
witness fees are generally not allowable as costs under Section 1032, unless
ordered by the Court.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 1033.5.)
 
            Further, Code
of Civil Procedure section 998 augments Section 1032 to allow for the recovery
of some expert witness fees in situations where a settlement offer was presented
and rejected.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 998,
subd. (a) [“The costs allowed under Sections 1031 and 1032 shall be withheld or
augmented as provided in this section”].) 
Specifically:
 
(c) (1) If an offer made by a
defendant is not accepted and the plaintiff fails to obtain a more favorable
judgment or award, the plaintiff shall not recover his or her postoffer costs
and shall pay the defendant’s costs from the time of the offer. In addition, in
any action or proceeding other than an eminent domain action, the court or
arbitrator, in its discretion, may require the plaintiff to pay a reasonable
sum to cover postoffer costs of the services of expert witnesses, who are not
regular employees of any party, actually incurred and reasonably necessary in
either, or both, preparation for trial or arbitration, or during trial or
arbitration, of the case by the defendant.
 
[…]
 
(d) If an offer made by a plaintiff is
not accepted and the defendant fails to obtain a more favorable judgment or
award in any action or proceeding other than an eminent domain action, the
court or arbitrator, in its discretion, may require the defendant to pay a
reasonable sum to cover postoffer costs of the services of expert witnesses,
who are not regular employees of any party, actually incurred and reasonably
necessary in either, or both, preparation for trial or arbitration, or during
trial or arbitration, of the case by the plaintiff, in addition to plaintiff’s
costs.
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 998, subds. (c)-(d).)  
 
            However “[a]n
offeree cannot be expected to accept an unreasonable offer.”  (Elrod v. Oregon Cummins Diesel, Inc.
(1987) 195 Cal.App.3d 692, 699.)  Thus,
for purposes of Section 998, the settlement offer must have been
“reasonable.”  (Ibid.)  “Whether a section 998 offer is reasonable
must be determined by looking at circumstances when the offer was made.  However, the reasonableness of an offer
depends upon the information used to evaluate it. In many cases, a plaintiff
and a defendant will not have the same information when an offer is made. For
this reason, the reasonableness of an offer may lie in the eye of its
beholder.”  (Ibid.)  
 
            Here, Blue
Shield served AOC a Section 998 Offer to Compromise on February 2, 2023 to
settle the cases for $30,000 over and above the $26,033 Blue Shield had already
reimbursed AOC for the 31 patients at issue, with each party to pay its own
costs and fees.  (Sept. 26, 2023 Nesbit
Decl. ¶ 4;[1] Feb.
27, 2024 Fogarty Decl. ¶ 4 and Ex. 1 thereto at ¶¶ 1, 3; Statement of Decision,
Aug. 3, 2023.)  
 
AOC argues that Blue Shield’s offer
was not made in good faith because (1) it was unrealistically low; (2) AOC “had
been almost uniformly successful in his previous lawsuits against Blue Cross
for similar emergent billing disputes[;]” and (3) Blue Shield’s offer was made
before any depositions, including expert witness depositions, had been taken,
so AOC did not have the necessary information to adequately evaluate the offer
at the time it was made.  (Motion at pp.
7-9.)
 
Blue Shield counters that the offer
was made in good faith, because: 
 
1.    
Goel v. Regal (2017) 11 Cal.App.5th 1054,
1064-65 held that the market value of medical services is 150% of Medicare and Long
Beach Memorial Medical Center v. Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, Inc. (2021)
71 Cal.App.5th 323 held that the reasonable market value is determined by what
buyers negotiate in the free market, and is not dependent upon the factors that
ultimately became sticking points for AOC, such as the provider’s billed
charges, rental network agreements, or small claims judgments/settlements.
 
2.    
Prior to making its offer, Blue Shield provided AOC its
claims data and benchmark analysis, demonstrating what Blue Shield paid
contracted providers, Medicare, other non-contracted providers like AOC, and
out-of-network emergency fee schedule rates, demonstrating the $26,033 already
paid represented 240% of Medicare, 175% of the contracted rate for in-network
providers, and 193% of the rate it provides other non-contracted
providers.  (Fogarty Decl. ¶¶ 8-10 and
Ex. 4.)
 
3.    
Also prior to Blue Shield’s offer, AOC took a
deposition of Blue Shield’s person most knowledgeable (“PMK”), obtaining testimony
regarding the relevant benchmark data, which was an exhibit at the deposition.
(Fogarty Decl. ¶ 9 and Ex. 3.)
 
4.    
Blue Shield also served its expert witness disclosure
statement, which included their respective expert witness fees and areas of
testimony, prior to making its settlement offer to AOC.  (Fogarty Decl. ¶ 20 and Ex. 10.)
 
AOC argues for the first time in
reply that at the time Blue Shield made its offer of $30,000 (plus the $26,033
already paid), it already owed AOC $52,020.86 by virtue of several small claims
cases (not included in the 31 patient claims at issue here), and Blue Shield’s
offer “arguably” encompassed those small claims cases by virtue of Blue
Shield’s declaratory relief claims.  
 
The Court permitted the parties to
provide further briefing on the issue of the reasonableness of Blue Shield’s Section
998 Offer and to permit AOC to amend its request for judicial notice so the Court
may review the small claims judgments in determining the reasonableness of Blue
Shield’s offer.
 
In its supplemental brief, AOC
clarifies that of the thirty-one (31) claims at issue in this case, at the time
Blue Shield’s offer was made, twenty-one (21) of them had already been
adjudicated in small claims court in AOC’s favor, with judgments totaling
$49,651.75.  (AOC’s Supp. Brief at p. 2;
Nesbit Decl. ¶ 3.)  However, AOC has
requested the Court to take judicial notice of only 20 of the 21 judgments,
apparently omitting the judgment for patient M.B.P. (case no. 22SMSC02316.)  The judgment amounts provided by AOC total
$45,574.12 as follows:
 
Case Number              Patient             Principal
22SMSC00298           A.M.                $2,127.10
22SMSC00300           J.U.                  $2,349.45
22SMSC00304           N.A.                $2,007.61
22SMSC00307           J.B.                  $2,309.62
22SMSC00309           S.B.                 $2,552.05
22SMSC00312           B.G.                 $2,338.19
22SMSC00313           D.L.1.              $2,500.00
22SMSC00352           W.D.V.R.        $2,000.00
22SMSC00354           F.V.                 $2,484.53
22SMSC00357           Y.O.                $2,500.00
22SMSC00362           R.M.1              $2,500.00
22SMSC00365           J.Z.                  $2,500.00
22SMSC00367           S.P.                  $2,224.06
22SMSC00369           J.S.                  $2,124.22
22SMSC00370           A.S.                 $2,248.14
22SMSC00371           S.L.                 $2,140.27
22SMSC00373           D.D.                $2,500.00
22SMSC00374           A.H.                $1,561.88
22SMSC00377           K.A.                $2,500.00
22SMSC00925           G.R.                 $2,107.00
                        
                                    TOTAL:          $45,574.12
 
(See AOC’s Amended Request for Judicial Notice [case number
and principal amounts]; Blue Shield’s Exhibit 44 [case number and patient
initials].)
 
Because the disputed amounts the
parties litigated in small claims court represents the amounts that were still
disputed after Blue Shield had already reimbursed AOC $26,033 for these claims,
comparing apples to apples, Blue Shield’s offer of $30,000 was meant to
encompass the $45,574.12 in judgments AOC had already obtained.  As such, the crux of AOC’s argument is that
this offer was objectively unreasonable, because it was over $15,000 less than the
judgments AOC had already obtained on the same claims in small claims court.
 
Blue Shield argues that the Section
998 Offer also included a waiver of costs, which adds significant value here,
and is a strong factor in favor of finding that the offer was reasonable.  (Supp. Opp. at pp. 5-7.)
 
Further, at the time of the offer, February
2, 2023, Blue Shield had already appealed each of the 20 small claims judgments
outlined above, and they were all awaiting de novo trials.  (See Blue Shield’s Ex. 44 to Supplemental
Declaration of John Fogarty, June 3, 2024 [“Supp. Fogarty Decl.”].)  Exhibit 44 also indicates that M.B.P.’s small
claims case was not decided until March 24, 2023 (after Blue Shield made its
998 offer in February) and was appealed on April 14, 2024.  (Ibid.)
 
While they were awaiting de novo
trials, the 21 small claims cases (including M.B.P.’s case) were consolidated
with the other 10 claims at issue in this case based upon the stipulation of AOC
and Blue Shield, and all 31 patients’ claims were tried together in this Court,
where judgment was ultimately entered entirely in Blue Shield’s favor.  (Supp. Fogarty Decl. at ¶ 10 and Ex. 49;
Judgment, Aug. 25, 2023.)  Blue Shield’s ultimate
success constitutes a prima facie showing that the offer was
reasonable.  (Santantonio v.
Westinghouse Broadcasting Co. (1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 102, 116-117 (hereafter
Santantonio).)
 
AOC counters that the off was still
unreasonable, notwithstanding that the small claims judgments were appealed, because
AOC has a strong historical track record of prevailing on nearly all of its approximately
three hundred (300) cases against Blue Shield to recover the reasonable value
of services rendered.  (Nissanoff Decl.
¶¶ 5-6.)  AOC further argues that at the
time Blue Shield made the offer, AOC “had no way of learning that Defendants
were intending to spend approximately $380,000 on experts on a case which was
only worth $150,000 soaking wet.”  (AOC’s
Supp. Brief at pp. 4-5.)  
 
Blue Shield responds that at the
time of the 998 Offer, the parties had “tentatively agreed” to treat this case
as a Bellwether and “apply the determination at this trial as to the
market value for AOC’s services to the parties’ current and future
disputes.”  (Blue Shield’s Original Opp.
at pp. 11-12.)  Blue Shield elaborates, “as
early as January 2023, Dr. Nissanoff himself proposed that the decision at
trial would ‘apply not only for the specific codes [tried in that case], but
for all cpt codes based on her decision making process” and that ‘th[e]
idea works well for both parties as it creates closure for all emergent
future claims.’”  (Blue Shield’s Original
Opp. at p. 12:4-8 [quoting Ex. 28 to Maurer Decl.].)  Further, at the time of Blue Shield’s Section
998 Offer, AOC had Blue Shield’s expert disclosures, including the expert
witnesses’ hourly rates.  (Fogerty Decl.,
Feb. 27, 2024 at ¶ 20 and Ex. 10 thereto.)
 
As such, AOC believed, due to its
prior track record litigating identical claims against Blue Shield, it was
going to prevail again at the trial(s) de novo. 
Yet the record shows that at the time Blue Shield made the offer, AOC
had the data upon which Blue Shield based its valuation of the 31 patient
claims at issue, as well as the case law supporting Blue Shield’s position, Dr.
Nissanoff’s suggestion and a tentative agreement to treat the 31 at-issue
patient claims as a Bellwether, and Blue Shield’s expert disclosures,
including all hourly fees.  Accordingly,
AOC should have been aware at the time of the potential financial risks of turning
down Blue Shield’s Section 998 Offer.
 
Therefore, AOC has not demonstrated
that Blue Shield’s offer was unreasonable or made in bad faith when viewing the
offer in context.
 
Reasonableness of Expert
Witness Fees Sought
 
AOC argues that the $280,247.05 in
expert witness fees for work performed by other employees at expert witness
Bruce Deal’s company, Analysis Group, are improper.  AOC also objects to the experts’ expenses to
travel from Northern California and South Carolina to Los Angeles for the
trial, arguing that Blue Shield should have hired Los Angeles based expert
witnesses.  In reply, AOC also argues for
the first time that the hourly rate for Bruce Deal listed on the memorandum of
costs ($927) is higher than his rate listed on the expert witness designation
($890).  AOC also points out that the
rates for all Analysis Group employees listed on the Memorandum of Costs are
lower than the rates listed in the Analysis Group invoice.
 
Courts may properly award fees
incurred by a testifying expert’s staff. 
(Santantonio, supra, 25 Cal.App.4th at p. 124 [Trial court did
not abuse its discretion in awarding “separately itemized charges for staff
economists and other skilled employees who helped” the expert prepare for trial].)
 Thus, there is nothing inherently
improper about the $280,247.05 sought for time spent by Mr. Deal’s staff (at
lower hourly rates than Mr. Deal’s).
 
Nor has AOC provided any legal
support for its argument that Blue Shield should have obtained local expert
witnesses.  Blue Shield disclosed its
expert witnesses, their hourly rates, and their respective locations prior to
making the Section 998 offer.  Thus, AOC
was fully aware of the risk of paying these expert witnesses’ travel expenses
for trial when it rejected Blue Shield’s offer. 
 
With respect to the hourly rates, the
Court sees no issue with Blue Shield requesting reimbursement for less than the
amounts they were actually charged by Analysis Group.  Thus, the fact that the expert rates on the
billing invoices are higher than those sought in the memorandum of costs is
immaterial.
 
As for Mr. Deal’s rate being higher
on the memorandum of costs than was disclosed in the expert witness disclosure
available to AOC at the time of the Section 998 offer, AOC has not met its
burden to present evidence that the fees sought are not recoverable, because
the Nesbit declaration submitted in support of the motion did not include a
copy of Blue Shield’s expert witness disclosure, and AOC did not raise the
argument until the reply.  Nonetheless,
because Blue Shield submitted the disclosure as part of its opposition
evidence, the Court can confirm that Mr. Deal’s rate listed on the memorandum
of costs is indeed higher than the rate disclosed to AOC at the time Blue
Shield made its Section 998 offer.  Fairness
dictates AOC should only be responsible to pay the rate it was aware of at the
time it rejected Blue Shield’s offer.  As
such, the Court reduces Mr. Deal’s hourly rate from the $927 claimed to the
$890 disclosed, effectively reducing the $39,212.10 sought for the 42.30 hours
of Mr. Deal’s time by $1,565.10 to $37,647.
 
            Reasonableness
of Fees for Serving Witnesses Not Called to Testify 
 
AOC contends that the $26,974.88
costs incurred to serve each of the 31 patients at issue were not reasonably
necessary to the litigation, because their medical records were ultimately
obtained from subpoenas to their respective hospitals and none of the patients
were ultimately called to testify or deposed. 

 
Blue Shield counters that, in order
to obtain the underlying medical records, Blue Shield had to personally serve
each patient with the consumer notice required by Code of Civil Procedure
section 1985.3 and also personally serve each of the medical providers with a
subpoena and proof that it had personally served each patient with the
requisite notice.
 
AOC argues in reply that Blue
Shield already had the medical records, as they were submitted to Blue Shield
when they were first billed, and Plaintiff ultimately produced them in
discovery.  
 
AOC has not provided any legal
support for its argument that service of process costs are not allowed if the
records are ultimately obtained from another source.  Moreover, in light of the notice requirements
of Section 1985.3, the Court finds that service on each patient was reasonably
necessary for Blue Shield to seek and obtain the relevant medical records from
the hospitals.
 
Exhibit Costs
 
Code of Civil Procedure section
1033.5, subdivision (a)(13) expressly allows costs for “Models, the
enlargements of exhibits and photocopies of exhibits, and the electronic
presentation of exhibits, including costs of rental equipment and electronic
formatting, may be allowed if they were reasonably helpful to aid the trier of
fact.”
 
AOC first argues that costs
incurred to prepare exhibits that were ultimately not used at trial were also
not reasonably necessary to the litigation, but AOC does not identify any
exhibits that were not used for trial, or specify the costs associated with exhibits
that were not ultimately used.  
 
AOC also argues that the
preparation of exhibits is a job for a paralegal, and therefore all exhibit
costs should be excluded.  But Section
1033.5 expressly allows the recovery of the cost of exhibits “reasonably
helpful to aid the trier of fact.”  
 
            Reasonableness
of “Other” Trial Tech Fees
 
AOC finally challenges the
$32,378.88 in “other” costs sought for “Trial Technician.”  Specifically, the memorandum explains these
costs were incurred for “On the Record: Ken Kotarski and staff. Live trial tech
assistance, display of exhibits, etc. Create and revise opening statement and
closing argument power points. Create and revise power point demonstratives for
Blue Shield witnesses[.]”  With respect
to these costs, AOC simply argues “these are internal (paralegal or similar)
items of internal costs and are not compensable.”
 
            Blue Shield
provides several authorities in support of its request.  (See, e.g., Green v. County of Riverside (2015)
238 Cal.App.4th 1363, 1373-1374 [approving costs for technician to “monitor …
equipment and quickly resolve any glitches”]; Bender v. County of Los
Angeles (2013) 217 Cal.App.4th 968, 990-991 [costs incurred for personnel
to create and support PowerPoint presentations are recoverable.])  Moreover, Blue Shield has provided On the
Record’s itemized invoices, supporting the requested amount.  (Fogarty Decl. ¶ 19 and Ex. 9.)
 
            In Reply
AOC cites to a nearly thirty-year-old case, in which the appellate court disclaimed
the use of “high-tech litigation” that exceeds the amount at issue in the case,
explaining, “If a party litigant chooses unwisely to expend monies in trial
presentation in excess of the value of the case, utilizing advanced methods of
information storage, retrieval and display, when more conventional if less
impressive methods are available, the party must stand on its own costs.”  (Science Applications Inter. Corp. v.
Superior Court (1995) 39 Cal.App.4th 1095, 1103-1105 (hereafter Science
Applications).)  
 
            While digital
trial demonstratives may have been “high tech” in 1995, PowerPoint is now a
commonplace tool, and courtrooms are routinely equipped with camera and monitor
equipment by default.  The use and
proliferation of technological tools in the courtroom is especially pronounced
following the COVID-19 pandemic, during which many court proceedings were
conducted entirely remotely.
 
            Although $32,378.88
in trial technician costs may, at first glance appear to be high, it encompasses
thirty-four hours of in-courtroom tech support for the trial that lasted six
days. Moreover, it is AOC’s position that the case was worth $125,000.  (Reply at p. 2:27.)  Thus, the amount Blue Shield spent on
PowerPoint tech during the trial does not exceed the amount at issue in this
case, as it did in Science Applications.
 
            Therefore,
AOC has not provided a legal or factual basis to tax the requested trial tech
support costs.
 
CONCLUSION AND
ORDER
 
Therefore, the Court grants in part
and denies in part AOC’s motion to tax costs. 
The Court taxes $1,565.10 in costs sought for expert witness Bruce
Deal’s time, representing a decrease in Mr. Deal’s rate to the $890 hourly rate
represented in Blue Shield’s expert witness disclosure.  AOC’s motion is denied in all other respects.
 
Although AOC filed the motion to
tax costs, the Court orders Blue Shield to file and serve a proposed Order in
conformance with the Court’s ruling, and provide notice of the Court’s ruling,
forthwith.
