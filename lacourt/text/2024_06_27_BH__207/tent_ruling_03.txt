MOTION
 
On May 20, 2024, Plaintiff Hassan Aminghazaei filed the Verified
Complaint against Defendant Discover Bank[1]
(“Defendant” or “Discover”), alleging two causes of action for (1) Violation of
Statutory Duties (§1785.25(a) of California Civil Code Title 1.6, Chapter 3.5);
and (2) Violation of Section 17200 of California’s Business and Professions
Code.
 
Defendant demurs to both causes of action pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 430.10, subdivisions (c), (e), and (f) on the following grounds:  there is another case pending between the
same parties on the same causes of action; the complaint fails to state facts
sufficient to constitute a cause of action; and uncertainty, respectively.
 
Defendant’s demurrer is unopposed.
 
REQUEST
FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE
 
            Defendant requests judicial notice
of the following:
 
·      
Exhibit A – A true and correct copy of
the complaint filed by Plaintiff Case No. 23VECV00924 on March 1, 2023.
 
·      
Exhibit B – A true and correct copy of
the Minute Order issued by Department A of this Court on July 13, 2023 in Case
No. 23VECV00924 sustaining Defendant Discover’s Demurrer to the Second Cause of
Action in the complaint without leave to amend.
 
·      
Exhibit C – A true and correct copy of
the docket in related Case No. 23VECV00924 obtained by Discover’s counsel from
the court’s “Case Access” website on May 20, 2024.
 
Judicial notice may be taken
of records of any court in this state. 
(Evid. Code, § 452, subd. (d)(1).) 
Because the requested documents are court records, the Court may take
judicial notice of them.  (Ibid.)   However, “while courts are free to take
judicial notice of the existence of each document in a court file, including
the truth of results reached, they may not take judicial notice of the truth of
hearsay statements in decisions and court files.  Courts may not take judicial notice of
allegations in affidavits, declarations and probation reports in court records
because such matters are reasonably subject to dispute and therefore require
formal proof.”  (Lockley v. Law Office
of Cantrell, Green, Pekich, Cruz & McCort (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 875,
882 [cleaned up].)  
 
Accordingly, the Court takes
judicial notice of Exhibits B and C, and for Exhibit A, the Court takes
judicial notice of the existence of the Complaint and the fact that certain
allegations were made in case number 23VECV00924, but not the truth of the
allegations contained therein.
ANALYSIS
 
1.     DEMURRER
 
“It is black letter law that a demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of
the allegations in a complaint.”  (Lewis v. Safeway, Inc. (2015)
235 Cal.App.4th 385, 388.)  In testing the sufficiency of a cause of
action, a court accepts “[a]s true all material facts properly pled and matters
which may be judicially noticed but disregard contentions, deductions or
conclusions of fact or law.  [A court
also gives] the complaint a reasonable interpretation, reading it as a whole
and its parts in their context.”  (290
Division (EAT), LLC v. City & County of San Francisco (2022) 86
Cal.App.5th 439, 450 [cleaned up]; Hacker v. Homeward Residential, Inc.
(2018) 26 Cal.App.5th 270, 280 [“in considering the merits of a demurrer,
however, “the facts alleged in the pleading are deemed to be true, however
improbable they may be”].)
 
Further, in ruling on a demurrer, a court must “liberally construe”
the allegations of the complaint “with a view to substantial justice between
the parties.”  (See Code Civ. Proc., §
452.)  “This rule of liberal construction
means that the reviewing court draws inferences favorable to the plaintiff, not
the defendant.”  (Perez v. Golden Empire Transit Dist. (2012) 209
Cal.App.4th 1228, 1238.)   
 
In summary, “[d]etermining whether the complaint is sufficient as
against the demurrer on the ground that it does not state facts sufficient to
constitute a cause of action, the rule is that if on consideration of all the
facts stated it appears the plaintiff is entitled to any relief at the hands of
the court against the defendants the complaint will be held good although the
facts may not be clearly stated, or may be intermingled with a statement of
other facts irrelevant to the cause of action shown, or although the plaintiff
may demand relief to which he is not entitled under the facts alleged.”  (Gressley v. Williams (1961) 193
Cal.App.2d 636, 639.)
 
A.   
ANOTHER
ACTION PENDING
 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 430.10, subdivision (c) provides that a party may demur to a
complaint when “There is another action pending between the same parties on the
same cause of action.”
 
A review of RJN Ex. A shows
that Plaintiff previously filed a nearly identical complaint in case number 23VECV00924.  Both cases are brought by Plaintiff against
Discover and Does 1 to 20, inclusive. 
Both complaints allege the exact same two causes of action, and both
complaints stem from the same allegations that Discovery inaccurately reflected
Plaintiff’s outstanding balance to credit bureaus.  Moreover, the enumerated allegations of the
two complaints are almost entirely verbatim copies of one another.
 
Therefore, the Court sustains Defendant’s demurrer on the grounds that
there is already another action pending between the same parties on the same
causes of action.
 
2.    
LEAVE TO AMEND
 
A plaintiff has the burden of showing in what
manner the complaint could be amended and how the amendment would change the
legal effect of the complaint, i.e., state a cause of action. (See The
Inland Oversight Committee v. City of San Bernardino (2018) 27 Cal.App.5th
771, 779; PGA West Residential Assn., Inc. v. Hulven Int'l, Inc. (2017)
14 Cal.App.5th 156, 189.) A plaintiff must not only state the legal basis for
the amendment, but also the factual allegations sufficient to state a cause of
action or claim. (See PGA West Residential Assn., Inc. v. Hulven Int'l, Inc.,
supra, 14 Cal.App.5th at p. 189.) Moreover, a plaintiff does not meet his
or her burden by merely stating in the opposition to a demurrer or motion to
strike that “if the Court finds the operative complaint deficient, plaintiff
respectfully requests leave to amend.” (See Major Clients Agency v Diemer
(1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 1116, 1133; Graham v. Bank of America (2014) 226
Cal.App.4th 594, 618 [asserting an abstract right to amend does not satisfy the
burden].)
 
Here, Plaintiff did not oppose the demurrer and therefore, the
Court finds that Plaintiff has not met his burden.  
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
For the reasons stated, the Court sustains Defendant’s Demurrer to
both causes of action without leave to amend under Code of Civil Procedure section 430.10, subdivision (c).  
 
Further, Defendant shall file
proposed a proposed Order and Judgment in conformity with the Court’s ruling on
or before July 11, 2024.  
 
Further, the Court advances
and reschedules the Case Management Conference from July 9, 2024 to October 3,
2024 at 8:30 A.M. in Department 207.  
 
Defendant shall provide notice of the Court’s orders and file the
notice with a proof of service forthwith.
