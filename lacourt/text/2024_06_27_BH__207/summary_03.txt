And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by Discover Bank to a complaint filed by Hassan Aminghazaei. The demurrer argues that the complaint fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action and that there is another action pending between the same parties on the same causes of action. The judge has sustained the demurrer without leave to amend, meaning that the plaintiff's complaint will be dismissed. The judge has also ordered that a proposed order and judgment be filed by the defendant on or before July 11, 2024, and has rescheduled a case management conference to October 3, 2024.
