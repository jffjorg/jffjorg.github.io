And here is the English summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the motion for trial preference filed by plaintiff Chloé Van Oijen, who was two years old at the time of the incident and is currently two years old. The incident occurred on March 15, 2024, when a trash receptacle fell on top of the plaintiff. The plaintiff seeks to set the case for trial ahead of other cases due to her age, as allowed by Code of Civil Procedure section 36. The judge finds that the plaintiff has a substantial interest in the case and grants the motion for trial preference. The case will be set for trial not more than 120 days from the granting of the preference motion, and the case management conference is advanced and reset to June 27, 2024.
