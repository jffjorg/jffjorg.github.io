 Case Number:  BC649025    Hearing Date:   May 21, 2024    Dept:  K Chasity Jones’
Petition for Order Setting Hearing on Third-Party Claims for Funds held in
Account No. XXXX43 Held at Axos Bank (filed April 11, 2024) is DENIED.
Background   
Case No. BC649025
Plaintiffs Elizabeth Taylor (“Taylor”) and Chasity Jones (“Jones”) (together,
“Plaintiffs”) allege as follows:
Defendant Alkiviades David (“David”) was, at
all relevant times, the President, CEO and managing agent of Defendants Hologram
USA, Inc. (“Hologram”), Hologram USA Entertainment, Inc. (“Hologram
Entertainment”), FilmOn Media Holdings, Inc. (“FilmOn”), FilmOn.TV, Inc.
(“FilmOn TV”), FilmOn.TV Networks, Inc. (“FilmOn Networks”), Alki David
Productions, Inc. (“Alki David Productions”) and Anakando Media Group USA
(“Anakando”). In January 2015, Plaintiffs were hired by Defendants as account
executives on the company’s sales team. Throughout the duration of their
employment, Plaintiffs worked in a hostile, misogynistic workplace rife with
sexual innuendo and degrading behavior to women. David also sexually harassed,
assaulted and imprisoned Taylor and sexually harassed and assaulted Jones. In
May 2015, Defendants directed Taylor to falsify health insurance paperwork to
indicate a later hire date. On June 1, 2015, Taylor was terminated, which was
the same day she complained about sexual harassment and insurance fraud. In
October 2015, Defendants ordered Jones to sign a declaration against Taylor. On
November 15, 2016, Jones was terminated in retaliation for rebuffing David’s
sexual assault.
On February 2, 2017, Plaintiffs filed a complaint, asserting causes of
action against David, Hologram, Hologram Entertainment, FilmOn, FilmOn TV,
FilmOn Networks, Alki David Productions, Anakando (together, “Defendants”) and

On September 14, 2017, Plaintiffs filed a FAC, adding a single cause of
action for Gender Violence in Violation of Civ. Code § 52.4, which was asserted
by Jones only.
On July 11, 2017, the court granted Defendants’ “Motion for Separate
Trials.”
On January 30, 2018, Plaintiffs filed two “Amendment[s] to Complaint,”
wherein FOTV Media Networks Inc. (“FOTV”) was named in lieu of Doe 1 and
FilmOn.TV UK Limited (“FilmOn UK”) was named in lieu of Doe 2.

On August 28, 2019, the court granted Alki David Productions’, Anakando’s
and FOTV’s motion for nonsuit as to Taylor’s complaint. On September 3, 2019,
the court declared a mistrial as to all of Taylor’s claims, with judgment to be
entered on the FACC as follows: David to take nothing by virtue of the
cross-complaint.
On September 26, 2019, an “Amended Judgment
on Special Verdict Upon Acceptance of Remittitur” was entered as to Jones; that
day, an “Amended Notice of Entry of Judgment” was entered.

On February 21, 2020, Taylor filed a “Supplemental Complaint for Damages”
against David, Hologram, Hologram Entertainment, FilmOn, FilmOn Networks, Alki
David Productions, Anakando and FilmOn TV.
On August 26, 2020, the court sustained FilmOn’s, FilmOn Network’s, Alki
David Production’s and Anakando’s demurrer to Taylor’s Supplemental Complaint
for Damages without leave to amend; on September 24, 2020, an “Order of
Dismissal” was entered as to same.
On March 18, 2022, remittitur was filed, affirming the court’s September
26, 2019 amended judgment as to Jones.
On November 9, 2022, the court granted Jones’ Motion to Amend Judgment to
Add Harmonia Malibu, LLC (“HML”), as a Judgment Debtor. On December 5, 2022, HML
filed a “Notice of Appeal.”
On December 28, 2022, an “Amended Order for Sale of Dwelling Commonly
Known as 23768 Malibu Road, Malibu, California 90265” was entered. On March 21,

Legal Standard
“Not later than 15 days after the third-party claim is filed
with the levying officer pursuant to Section 720.120 or 720.220, or 15 days
after filing an undertaking pursuant to Section 720.610, either the creditor or
the third person may petition the court for a hearing to determine the validity
of the third-party claim and the proper disposition of the property that is the
subject of the claim.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 720.310, subd. (a).) “The hearing
may be held whether or not an undertaking has been filed but not if a deposit
has been made pursuant to Section 720.260.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 720.310, subd.
(b).) “The hearing shall be held within 20 days after the filing of the
petition unless continued by the court for good cause shown.” (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 720.310, subd. (c).)
“In a case where the third person has not filed with the
levying officer an undertaking to release the property pursuant to Chapter 6
(commencing with Section 720.610), if the creditor does not within the time
allowed under subdivision (b) of Section 720.140 file with the levying officer
an undertaking . . . that satisfies the requirements of Section 720.160, the
levying officer shall release the property unless it is to be held under
another lien or unless otherwise ordered by the court.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
720.170, subd. (a).) “Except as otherwise provided in this section, release is
governed by Section 699.060.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 720.170, subd. (b).) “If
personal property that has been taken into custody is to be released to the
debtor pursuant to Section 699.060 and the debtor has not claimed the property
within 10 days after notice was served pursuant to Section 699.060, the levying
officer shall release the property to the third person making the claim.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 720.170, subd. (c).) “A hearing may be had on the third-party
claim pursuant to Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 720.310) notwithstanding
the release of the property pursuant to this section.” (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 720.170, subd. (d) [emphasis added].)
Discussion
On April 11, 2024, Jones petitioned the court, per Code of
Civil Procedure §§ 720.170(d) and 720.310(c), for an order setting a hearing on
third-party claims for the funds in Account No. 712943 held at Axos Bank.
Request for Leave to File Sur-Replies
On May 10, 2024, Jones filed a “Request for Leave to File
Sur-Replies Re: Third Party Claims; [Proposed] Sur-Replies Attached as Exhibits
A & B.” The court denies Jones’ request. The Code of Civil Procedure does
not provide for the filing of a sur-reply. Further, the jurisdictional issue
raised by Bridgeford does not constitute “new argument.”
Analysis
On or about September 25, 2023, Jones’ counsel filed with
the San Diego County Sheriff (“Levying Officer) and served on Axos Bank, David,
HML, Hologram, Harmonia Trust D, Bridgeford and Khan a “Notice of Levy Under
Writ of Execution (Money Judgment) Under Corut Order Authorizing Levy On
Deposit Account In Name of Non-Judgment Debtor,” Levy No. 2023103606 to levy a
deposit account held in the name of Harmonia Trust D at Axos Bank. (Stevens
Decl., ¶ 30, Exhs, 18 and 19; Friedman Decl., ¶ 4, Exh. 1; Berger Decl., ¶ 12).
On October 16, 2023, Bridgeford filed (and served on Jones’ counsel and other
parties’ and non-parties’ counsel) its “Third-Party Claim in Response to
Chasity Jones’ Notice of Levy on Harmonia Trust D’s Deposit Accounts at Axos
Bank” and supporting papers. (Stevens Decl., ¶¶ 5-7, Exhs. 2-4; Friedman Decl.,
¶ 31.) On October 19, 2023, Bridgeford filed with the Levying Officer (and
served on Jones’ counsel and other parties’ and non-parties’ counsel) its
“Supplement to Third-Party Claim of Ownership In Response to Chasity Jones’ Notice
of Levy on Harmonia Trust D’s Deposit Accounts at Axos Bank.” (Stevens Decl., ¶
8, Exh. 5).
Jones did not oppose or respond to Bridgeford’s Third-Party
Claim of Ownership and failed to file an undertaking. (Bridgeford’s Reply,
2:15-16). Jones did not file a petition for a hearing on Bridgeford’s
Third-Party Claim of Ownership, as per Code of Civil Procedure § 720.310,
subdivision (a), within 15 days after Bridgeford filed with the Levying Officer
and served on Jones’ counsel its Third-Party Claim of Ownership. (Id.,
2:18-21).
On November 9, 2023, the Levying Officer terminated Jones’
levy and directed Axos Bank to release any and all of the property that was the
subject of Jones’ Notice of Levy. (Stevens Decl., Exh. 6; Berger Decl., ¶ 12,
Exh. 3.)
On March 27, 2024, Axos Bank filed its “Verified Third-Party
Claim of Security Interest.” (Berger Decl., ¶ 13, Exh. 4.)[1] On April
11, 2024, Jones filed a “Petition for Order Setting Hearing on Third-Party
Claims for the Funds In Account No. 712943 Held at Axos Bank” and a “Statement
in Opposition to Mar. 27, 2024 Third-Party Claim of Axos Bank for the
Funds In Account No. 712943 Held at Axos Bank.” On April 19, 2024, Jones filed
an “Amended Statement in Opposition to Mar. 27, 2024 Third-Party Claim of
Axos Bank for the Funds In Account No. 712943 Held at Axos Bank.”
The
aforesaid facts reflect that there is no active levy, which is needed before a
third-party claim can be made: “A third person claiming ownership or the right
to possession of property may make a third-party claim under this chapter in
any of the following cases if the interest claimed is superior to the
creditor's lien on the property: (a) Where real property has been levied upon
under a writ of attachment or a writ of execution. (b) Where personal property
has been levied upon under a writ of attachment, a writ of execution, a
prejudgment or postjudgment writ of possession, or a writ of sale.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 720.110.) Jones was required to file a petition for a hearing within
15 days after Bridgeford filed its Third-Party Claim of Ownership. (See Code
Civ. Proc. § 720.310, subd. (a); Ballagh v. Williams (1942) 50
Cal.App.2d 303, 304 [holding the court “was without jurisdiction to hear the
matter” because the petition was filed two days late under a prior version of
statute (i.e., former § 689) requiring the petition to be filed within 10 days
after the delivery of the claim to the levying officer]; Commercial Credit
Plan, Inc. v. Gomez (1969) 276 Cal.App.2d Supp. 831, 834 [“The law is also
clear that when 15 days have run from the filing of the third party claim and
no petition for hearing has been filed, the trial court in which the suit was
brought loses jurisdiction to hear the summary proceeding”].)
Jones
asserts that “[t]he rights to this property can be litigated if a levy is
released. The legislature specifically anticipated these circumstances. Section
720.430 reflects that a creditor cannot re-levy previously released property
unless there is a court order finding the debtor has rights to the property.”
(Amended Opp., 9:10-12). Code of Civil Procedure § 720.430 provides that “[i]f
property has been released pursuant to Section 720.170, 720.270, or 720.660, it
may be levied upon or otherwise sought to be applied to the satisfaction of the
judgment only if it is determined in the hearing on the third-party claim that
the debtor has an interest in the property that may be levied upon or otherwise
applied to the satisfaction of the judgment.”
The
court declines to hold a hearing on the third-party claim. (CCP § 720.170(d).)
First, Jones has not specifically shown that the property was released pursuant
to any of the sections cited therein in Section 720.430, including presumably
the most applicable -- Section 720.170. Additionally, Jones does not address or
provide authority providing relief under Section 720.170(d) when there is non-compliance
concerning Section 720.310. Here, it is clear that Jones did not timely file a
petition for a hearing so the court does not have jurisdiction to make any such
determination. Moreover, even if it did have jurisdiction to hear the matter,
the court declines its discretion to hear the matter because it appears the
request to adjudicate the third party claim is solely against Axos Bank and
does not include Bridgeford. The court does not seek to parse such claims at
this time.
Jones argues that the Levying Officer never served her with
a copy of Bridgeford’s and/or Axos Banks’ respective third-party claims.
(Stevens Decl., ¶¶ 31 and 32). This argument, however, does not somehow provide
the court with jurisdiction to issue a ruling at the instant hearing. At any
rate, Jones admits that Bridgeford served her (through counsel) with its
Third-Party Claim of Ownership. (Amended Opp., 8:3-4; see also Friedman Decl.,
¶¶ 5-8, Exhs. 2-5). Jones was also able to file her opposition and amended
opposition to Axos Banks’ Third-Party Claim and her petition for a hearing.
