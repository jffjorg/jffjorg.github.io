[1]              Axos Bank explains that “[a]fter
being served with Jones’ [‘][M]otion to [C]ompel [Axos Bank to Comply With Levy
on Deposit Account’ in March 2024], [it] was under the impression that an
active levy still existed, and served a third-party claim on the San Diego
County Sheriff and Jones. However, shortly after Axos served its third-party
clam, it learned that the September 2023 levy was terminated by
the San Diego County Sheriff’s Office on November 9, 2023, and therefore, no
active levy exists. Indeed, after Axos served its third-party claim on the
Sheriff, the Sheriff’s Office returned Axos’ third-party claim because, among
other things, the levy was released and terminated by the San Diego County
Sheriff.” (Axos Bank Reply, 4:28-5:8 [emphasis in original]; see also Berger
Decl., ¶¶ 13-14, Exhs. 4 and 5.)
