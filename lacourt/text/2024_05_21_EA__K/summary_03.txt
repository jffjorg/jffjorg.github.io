And here is the text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The court grants Sunnyland International Group's motion for leave to file its proposed Second Amended Answer. The court finds that the proposed affirmative defense of Lack of Consideration is properly supported by compliance with California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1324. The court also notes that Plaintiff Yongyi Liu does not oppose the motion on the basis of prejudice, but rather asserts that the proposed affirmative defense is "inapplicable and irrelevant." The court grants the motion, and Sunnyland International Group's Second Amended Answer is deemed filed and served as of the date of the hearing.
