[1]              Motion #1 was filed (and served via
email) on April 23, 2024 and set for hearing on May 21, 2024. On April 29,
2024, the court granted Lisee’s and Boudreau’s ex parte applications to shorten
the time for the hearing of their respective motions for good faith settlement
determination, to May 14, 2024. Motion #2 was thereafter filed on May 1, 2024
(and served via email on April 30, 2024). On May 13, 2024, the court continued
the scheduled May 14, 2024 hearing to May 21, 2024. On May 13, 2024, BPC and Boudreau
filed (and served via email) an “Amended Notice of Boudreau Parties’ Joint
Motion for Determination of Good Faith Settlement Pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure Sections 877 and 877.6,” advising therein of the new May 21, 2024
hearing date.


[2]              On March 14, 2022, Meritage’s
Motion for Summary Judgment was granted. Judgment was entered on November 21,
2022.


[3]              It appears to the court that BPC
and Boudreau may have inadvertently left off a portion of Exhibit C, inasmuch
as the last entry on page 3 therein is dated “02/02/18.” The court has counted
in excess of 60 complaints logged during the January 3, 2018 to February 2,
2018 time frame reflected on Exhibit C. 


[4]              Again, it appears to the court that
JLP may have inadvertently left off a portion of Exhibit F, inasmuch as the
last entry on page 3 therein is dated “02/02/18.”
