Background   
Case No. 21PSCV00427
Plaintiff Yongyi Liu (“Liu”) alleges as follows:
Liu is the equitable owner and is in
possession and control of the real property located at 636 East Boxwood Lane,
Azusa, California 91702 (“subject property”). On or about August 18, 2005, Liu
and Feng Li (“F. Li”) F. Li had a child, Meixi Li (“Meixi”). At the time Meixi
was born and to date, F. Li was and has been married to another woman. On July
27, 2012, F. Li purchased and gifted the subject property to Liu to help Liu
since she was raising Meixi by herself. Prior to and upon closing of the escrow
of the subject property, F. Li told Liu that he had purchased the subject
property for her and was giving it to her. F. Li told Liu he would transfer
title to the subject property at a future time. In or about early August 2012,
shortly before escrow closed on the subject property, F. Li asked Liu to come
to the United States with him so that he could transfer title on the subject
property from him to her and give possession of same to her. Liu came with her
mom, her other daughter Helin Xu (“Xu”), and Meixi and took possession of the
subject property; however, due to an unexpected event, F. Li had to return to
China before the transfer paperwork was completed. 
 
In or about December 2013, F. Li came to the
United States for a short trip; Liu was then in China. F. Li promised to
transfer title to the subject property to Liu when they were both in the United
States. In or about April 2014, F. Li was incarcerated in China on a 13-year
sentence. F. Li remains incarcerated. On March 27, 2021, while still
incarcerated, F. Li purportedly signed a grant deed granting the subject
property to Sunnyland International Group (“Sunnyland”). 
 
On or about April 14, 2021, F. Li sent a
Notice to Quit to Liu’s address in China, claiming therein that the subject
property was owned jointly by him and his wife, Jing Li (“J. Li”), and that
they had sold same to a third party. On April 16, 2021, Xi Lin (“Lin”) went to
Liu’s house and told Xu that Lin was the president of Sunnyland and demanded
possession of the subject property. Lin represented to Xu that F. Li had
transferred title of the subject property to Sunnyland to settle a loan he owed
to the company and placed a Notice to Quit on the front door of the subject
property. On April 26, 2021, Xu served a 30-day Notice to Terminate Tenancy at
Will on Liu. 
On May 21, 2021, Liu filed a complaint, asserting causes of action
against Sunnyland, Lin, F. Li, J. Li and Does 1-50 for:
1.                 
Quiet
Title
2.

Case No. 21WCUD00362
This is an unlawful detainer action regarding the subject property. On
June 10, 2021, Sunnyland filed a complaint for unlawful detainer against Xu,
Liu and Does 1-10.
On August 19, 2021, the court related and consolidated Case No.
21PSCV0042 with this case and designated Case No. 21PSCV0042 as the lead case.
Legal
Standard
“The court
may, in furtherance of justice, and on any terms as may be proper, allow a
party to amend any pleading…” (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (a)(1); and see §
576 [“Any judge, at any time before or after commencement of trial, in the
furtherance of justice, and upon such terms as may be proper, may allow the
amendment of any pleading or pretrial conference order”].)
“[T]he trial
court has wide discretion in allowing the amendment of any pleading.” (Bedolla v. Logan & Frazer (1975) 52
Cal.App.3d 118, 135.) “[I]t is irrelevant that new legal theories are
introduced as long as the proposed amendments relate to the same general set of
facts.” (Kittredge Sports Co. v. Superior
Court (1989) 213 Cal.App.3d 1045, 1048 [quotation marks and citation
omitted].) “[E]ven if the proposed legal theory is a novel one, the preferable
practice would be to permit the amendment and allow the parties to test its legal sufficiency by demurrer, motion for judgment on the
pleadings or other appropriate proceedings.” (Id. [quotation marks and citation omitted].) With that said, “the
failure of a proposed amendment to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause
of action or defense may support an order denying a motion to amend.” (California
Casualty Gen. Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (1985) 173 Cal.App.3d 274, 280,
disapproved of on other grounds in Kransco v. American Empire Surplus Lines
Ins. Co. (2000) 23 Cal.4th 390)
Courts must apply a policy of great liberality in permitting
amendments to pleadings at any stage of the proceedings, up to and including
trial, when no prejudice is shown to the adverse party. (Atkinson v. Elk Corp. (2003) 109 Cal.App.4th 739, 761.) However,
“even if a good amendment is proposed in proper form, unwarranted delay in
presenting it may—of itself—be a valid reason for denial. . . denial may rest
upon the element of lack of diligence in offering the amendment after knowledge
of the facts, or the effect of the delay on the adverse party.” (Roemer v. Retail Credit Co. (1975) 44
Cal.App.3d 926, 940.)
Also, “[a] motion to amend a pleading before trial must: (1)
Include a copy of the proposed amendment or amended pleading, which must be
serially numbered to differentiate it from previous pleadings or amendments;
(2) State what allegations in the previous pleading are proposed to be deleted,
if any, and where, by page, paragraph, and line number, the deleted allegations
are located; and (3) State what allegations are proposed to be added to the
previous pleading, if any, and where, by page, paragraph, and line number, the
additional allegations are located.” (Cal. Rules of Court (“CRC”), rule 3.1324,
subd. (a).)
Additionally, “[a] separate declaration must accompany the
motion and must specify: (1) The effect of the amendment; (2) Why the amendment
is necessary and proper; (3) When the facts giving rise to the amended
allegations were discovered; and (4) The reasons why the request for amendment
was not made earlier.” (CRC Rule 3.1324, subd. (b).)
Discussion
Sunnyland
moves the court for leave to file its proposed Second Amended Answer, which
adds the affirmative defense of Lack of Consideration.
Sunnyland’s motion reflects adequate compliance with CRC
Rule 3.1324, subdivisions (a) and (b). Sunnyland’s counsel Brian S. Edwards
(“Edwards”) represents that Plaintiff has not yet deposed Sunnyland’s PMK and
has not propounded any written discovery on Sunnyland; additionally, trial is
not until November 2024. (Edwards Decl., ¶ 4). Liu does not oppose the motion
on the basis of prejudice; instead, she asserts only that the aforesaid
proposed affirmative defense is “inapplicable and irrelevant.” (Opp., 2:8).
The motion is
granted. Sunnyland’s Second Amended Answer is deemed filed and served as of the
date of the hearing.
