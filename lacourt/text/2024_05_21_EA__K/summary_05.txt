And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge's tentative ruling discusses the case between Jones and Axos Bank, which revolves around the termination of a levy on a deposit account. Axos Bank believed that an active levy still existed, and therefore served a third-party claim on the San Diego County Sheriff's Office. However, the Sheriff's Office later returned the third-party claim, citing that the levy was actually terminated on November 9, 2023. The judge notes that Axos Bank was under the impression that the levy was still active, but the Sheriff's Office's actions suggest otherwise. The ruling highlights the importance of ensuring that all parties are aware of the current status of a levy.
