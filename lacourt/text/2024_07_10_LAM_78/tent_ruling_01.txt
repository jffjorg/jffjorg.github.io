  Case Number:  21STCV12444    Hearing Date:   July 10, 2024    Dept:  78  Superior Court of California¿ County of Los Angeles¿ Department 78¿ ¿ ENCINO NEWCASTLE HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION, Plaintiff(s), vs. DEL SOL PROPERTY MANAGEMENT, INC., et al., Defendant(s). Case No.:¿ 21STCV12444 Hearing Date:¿ July 10, 2024   [TENTATIVE] ORDER CONTINUING MOTION FOR OSC RE: CONTEMPT   On May 15, 2024, defendant/cross-complainant Del Sol Property Management, Inc. (“Del Sol”) filed the instant motion for an OSC Re: Contempt based on non-party HOA Management Professionals, Inc.’s (“HMP”) purported failure to produce business records pursuant to a subpoena issued on December 29, 2023. The hearing date is set for July 10, 2024. On May 28, 2024, HMP filed a motion to quash the December 29, 2023 deposition subpoena for production of business records issued by Del Sol. The hearing date is set for August 13, 2024.  Considering the relationship between Del Sol’s motion for contempt, and HMP’s motion to quash its underlying basis, the Court finds it in the interest of judicial efficiency and economy to continue Del Sol’s motion to be heard at the same time as HMP’s related motion.  Therefore, on its own motion, the Court CONTINUES Del Sol’s Hearing on Motion for an Order to Show Cause Re: Contempt (CCP 1209) to August 13, 2024 at 8:30 a.m. in Department 78 of Stanley Mosk Courthouse.   Moving Party is ordered to give notice.  DATED: July 9, 2024 __________________________ Hon.
