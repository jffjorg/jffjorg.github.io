And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer to the Plaintiff's First Amended Complaint and the motion to strike the First Amended Complaint. The Court sustains the demurrer to the first cause of action, which is the breach of contract, covenant of quiet enjoyment, and warranty of habitability, with leave to amend. The Court overrules the demurrer to the fifth cause of action, which is the violation of the Unfair Business Practices Act.

The Court grants the motion to strike punitive damages as to SRHT and as it relates to the breach of contract claim only. The Court finds that the Plaintiff's claims are sufficient to state a cause of action for unfair business practices, but notes that the Plaintiff's allegations of punitive damages must be more specific.

The Court orders the parties to meet and confer on the issues raised in this tentative ruling and to submit their concerns or objections by email. The Court will issue a final ruling on July 10, 2024.
