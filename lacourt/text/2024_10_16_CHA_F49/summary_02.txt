And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to compel arbitration in a case involving a breach of warranty claim. The defendant argued that the plaintiff agreed to arbitrate disputes arising from the sale of a vehicle, but the judge found that the evidence did not support this claim. The judge also held that the defendant, as a nonsignatory to the sales contract, did not have standing to enforce the arbitration clause. Finally, the judge concluded that the plaintiff was not estopped from denying arbitration because the claims did not rely on the specific terms of the underlying contract.
