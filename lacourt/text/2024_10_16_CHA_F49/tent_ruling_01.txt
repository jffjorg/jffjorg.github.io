BACKGROUND
 
On May 1, 2023, Plaintiff Trent Western (“Plaintiff” or
“Western”) filed the Complaint against Defendants Tony C.T. Lo, D.O. (“Lo”),
Gene L. Tran, D.O. (“Tran”), Facey Medical Group, The Kroger Co., Walgreens
Boots Alliance, Inc., and Does 1 through 25, alleging a single cause of action
for wrongful death due to medical malpractice. Subsequently, on March 27, 2024,
Defendants Lo, Tran, and Facey Medical Group filed their Answer to the
Complaint. Following this, on October 4, 2024, the Court dismissed Defendants
The Kroger Co. and Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. at Plaintiff’s request. 
 
On September 11, 2024, Tran filed the instant Motion to
Compel Plaintiff’s Responses to the Demand for Production and Inspection
of Documents, Set One (the “Motion”). 
 
No Opposition or Reply papers
have been received by the Court.
 
ANALYSIS
 
“Within 30 days after service of a demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling, the party to whom the demand is directed shall serve the
original of the response to it on the party making the demand, and a copy of
the response on all other parties who have appeared in the action, unless on
motion of the party making the demand, the court has shortened the time for
response, or unless on motion of the party to whom the demand has been directed,
the court has extended the time for response.” (Code Civ. Proc.
§ 2031.260, subd. (a).)
 
“If a party to whom a demand for
inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is directed fails to serve a timely
response to it, the following rules shall apply: (a) The party to whom the
demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is directed waives any
objection to the demand, including one based on privilege or on the protection
for work product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 2018.010). The court,
on motion, may relieve that party from this waiver on its determination that
both of the following conditions are satisfied: (1) The party has
subsequently served a response that is in substantial compliance with Sections
2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230, 2031.240, and 2031.280. (2) The party’s
failure to serve a timely response was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or
excusable neglect. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.300, subd. (a).)
 
A.   
Motion to Compel
Responses to Demand for Production and Inspection of Documents, Set One
 
Defendant Tran’s counsel, Paul
S. Cook (“Cook”), attests that on March 27, 2024, Plaintiff was served with the
first set of Demand for Production and Inspection of Documents (the “Demand”) by
email. (Cook Decl. ¶ 2, Ex. “A.”) The service of the Demand established the
deadline for Plaintiff to respond by April 30, 2024. On May 9, Plaintiff’s
counsel called defense counsel, and the parties agreed to extend the response
deadline to June 10, 2024. (Id. ¶ 4.) Subsequently, on June 14, 2024, Plaintiff’s
counsel emailed the defense counsel’s office that the responses would be
served next week. (Ibid.) Later, on June 27, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel
apologized for not providing a status update and had a personal health issue
and would continue to work with Plaintiff to complete the responses as soon as
possible. (Ibid.) However, as of the Motion's filing date, no responses
were received from Plaintiff. (Cook Decl. ¶ 6.)
 
Based on the above records,
the Court determines that Plaintiff failed to serve a timely response, thereby
waiving any objection to the demand, including those based on privilege or the
protection for work product, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.300,
subdivision (a).
 
Nevertheless, under Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.300,
subdivision (a), “[t]he court, on motion, may relieve that party from this
waiver on its determination that both of the following conditions are
satisfied: (1) The party has subsequently served a response that is in
substantial compliance with Sections 2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230, 2031.240,
and 2031.280. (2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response was the
result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.”
 
Here,
Plaintiff does not file an Opposition to the Motion. Nor does Plaintiff move
separately for relief from the waiver. Additionally, there is no record
indicating any responses have been subsequently served by Plaintiff prior to
the hearing. Consequently, the Court finds that relief under Code of Civil
Procedure section 2031.300, subdivision(a) is unavailable in this circumstance.
 
Based on the foregoing, the Court GRANTS the Motion.
 
CONCLUSION
 
Defendant Gene Tran, D.O.’s Motion to Compel
Plaintiff Trent Western’s Responses to Demand for Production and Inspection of
Documents, Set One, is GRANTED.
 
Plaintiff
Trent Western is ordered to serve responses, without objection, to Defendant Gene Tran, D.O.’s Demand for Production and Inspection of Documents, Set One,
within 20 days.
