MOVING PARTY:                 Defendant Wells Fargo Bank,
N.A.    
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Plaintiff John Christian Lukes
Motion to Compel Compliance with Court Order and for Issue and
Evidentiary Sanctions or, in the alternative, Monetary Sanctions
The court
considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers filed in connection with
this motion. 
EVIDENTIARY OBJECTIONS
The court rules on defendant
Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.’s evidentiary objections as follows:
Objection No. 1 is sustained. 
Objection No. 2 is overruled. 
DISCUSSION
Defendant Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (“Defendant”) moves the court for an
order                  (1) compelling plaintiff John Christian Lukes
(“Plaintiff”) to comply with the court’s September 6, 2023 order; (2) directing
Plaintiff to pay monetary sanctions to the court in the amount of $1,500
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 177.5; (3) awarding monetary
sanctions in favor of Defendant and against Plaintiff in the amount of $9,440; and
(4) imposing issue and evidence sanctions against Plaintiff to preclude him from
introducing or referencing any argument or evidence (i) of a purported contract
with Defendant that was formed, communicated, or memorialized in writing, (ii) that
the May 28, 2010 email, alleged in the First Amended Complaint (¶ 21), exists,
and (iii) that the statements by Sloan and Silk to Plaintiff in 2015 regarding
the portfolio were false.  Defendant
moves for this relief on the ground that Plaintiff has not complied with the
court’s September 6, 2023 order. 
If a party engages in the misuse of the discovery process, the court
may impose issue or evidence sanctions. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subds. (b), (c).)  The court may impose an issue sanction (1) “ordering
that designated facts shall be taken as established in the action in accordance
with the claim of the party adversely affected by the misuse of the discovery
process[,]” or (2) that prohibits “any party engaging in the misuse of the
discovery process from supporting or opposing designated claims or defenses.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd.
(b).)  “The court may impose an evidence
sanction by an order prohibiting any party engaging in the misuse of the
discovery process from introducing designated matters in evidence.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (c).)  “Discovery sanctions should be appropriate to
the dereliction, and should not exceed that which is required to protect the
interests of the party entitled to but denied discovery.  [Citation.] 
If a lesser sanction fails to curb misuse, a greater sanction is
warranted: continuing misuses of the discovery process warrant incrementally
harsher sanctions until the sanction is reached that will curb the abuse.”  (Victor Valley Union High School District
v. Superior Court of San Bernardin County (2023) 91 Cal.App.5th 1121, 1158
[internal quotations and citations omitted].) 
On September 6, 2023, the court issued an order granting in part, inter
alia, Defendant’s motion to compel Plaintiff’s further responses to Defendant’s
Requests for Production of Documents.[1]  (Sep. 6, 2023 Order, p. 6:4-5.)  The court ordered Plaintiff (1) to serve on
Defendant further written responses to Defendant’s Requests for Production of
Documents, numbers 1-12, 16, 20-42, 44-49, 51-59, and 62-71; (2) to produce to
Defendant all documents and things in Plaintiff’s possession, custody, or
control, which are responsive to those requests; (3) to use the search terms
set forth in the proposed search terms list attached to the email from Rachel
Lowe dated January 4, 2023; (4) to produce to Defendant all of the materials
produced in response to Defendant’s document demands in electronic form with
associated metadata; (5) to produce a privilege log in compliance with Code of
Civil Procedure section 2031.240; and (6) to pay monetary sanctions to
Defendant.  (Sep. 6, 2023 Order, p.
6:6-20.)  The court ordered Plaintiff to
provide the responses to discovery within 45 days of the date of the court’s
order, and to pay sanctions within 60 days of the date of the order.  (Sep. 6, 2023 Order, pp. 6:6-12,
7:15-16.)  
The court notes that, although Defendant asserts that the court’s
November 8, 2023 order on the parties’ stipulation extended Plaintiff’s
deadline to respond, the court disagrees. 
(Mot., p. 8:13-14; Lowe Decl., ¶ 18; Lowe Decl., Ex. K.)  While the stipulation states that Plaintiff “requested
30 additional days to supplement Plaintiff’s responses” to the discovery, the
stipulation does not state that Defendant stipulated to that extension, and the
order does not extend Plaintiff’s deadline to respond.  (Lowe Decl., Ex. K, Nov. 8, 2023 Stip. &
Order, pp. 2:23-26, 5:1-12.)  Thus, the
court finds that Plaintiff was required to serve his supplemental responses and
to produce responsive documents no later than 45 days after the court’s
September 6, 2023 order.  (Sep. 6, 2023
Order, p. 6:6-12.)
Defendant produced evidence, in support of its moving papers,
establishing that Plaintiff did not comply with the court’s September 6, 2023
order.  Specifically, as of January 10,
2024 (the date Defendant filed this motion) – i.e., more than 45 days after the
court’s September 6, 2023 order – Plaintiff had “not provided any supplemental
written responses to [Defendant’s] Requests for Production or produced any
additional documents, ESI, or metadata[.]” 
(Lowe Decl., ¶ 24.)
In his opposition, Plaintiff does not dispute that he has not fully
complied with the court’s order compelling him to serve written responses and to
produce responsive documents to certain of Defendant’s document demands.  Instead, Plaintiff has merely (1) presented
evidence establishing that he has provided a privilege log to Defendant, and
(2) asserted that he needs additional time to comply with the order.  (Leonardo Decl., ¶¶ 13 [counsel informed
Defendant’s counsel that he was unable to comply with the October 23, 2023
production deadline and requested a 30-day extension], 17-18 [counsel provided
an initial privilege log on March 16, 2024 and an updated log on April 23,
2024], 20 [“While some progress has been made on Lukes’ emails the project is
overwhelming”]; Opp., p. 7:14-16 [Plaintiff and counsel “are working toward the
production of the ESI for his email”].)  
Thus, the court finds that Defendant has met its burden to show that
Plaintiff has engaged in the misuse of the discovery process by (1) disobeying
the court’s September 6, 2023 order compelling him to provide discovery, and
(2) failing to respond to an authorized method of discovery (i.e., Defendant’s
Requests for Production of Documents). 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subds. (g), (d).)  The court further finds that the less severe
sanction of monetary sanctions, imposed by the court against Plaintiff in its
September 6, 2023 order, has not produced compliance with the court’s order or
the discovery process.  (Sep. 6, 2023
Order, p. 7:15-16; Victor Valley Union High School District, supra,
91 Cal.App.5th at p. 1158 [“The discovery statutes evince an incremental
approach to discovery sanctions, starting with monetary sanctions and ending
with the ultimate sanction of termination”] [internal quotations and citations
omitted].)  The court therefore finds
that Defendant has met its burden to show that evidence sanctions are
warranted.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§
2023.030, subds. (b), (c), 2031.310, subd. (i) [“if a party fails to obey an
order compelling further response, the court may make those orders that are
just, including the imposition of an issue sanction, [or] an evidence sanction”
and may also impose a monetary sanction in lieu of or in addition to that
sanction].) 
First, the court denies Defendant’s request to impose issue or
evidence sanctions that would preclude Plaintiff from introducing or
referencing argument and all evidence in support of his allegations that (1)
there exists a contract between Plaintiff and Defendant, (2) the May 28, 2010
email exists, and (3) the statements made by Timothy Sloan and Stephen
Silk in 2015 regarding the portfolio were false, because such sanctions are
not narrowly tailored to the prejudice caused by Plaintiff’s failure to serve written
responses and to produce responsive documents to Defendant’s Requests for
Production of Documents.  (Victor
Valley Union High School District, supra, 91 Cal.App.5th at p. 1158
[in choosing sanctions, the court should attempt to tailor the sanction to the
harm caused by the withheld discovery].) 
Second, the court grants Defendant’s request to impose an evidence
sanction precluding Plaintiff from introducing any writings (as that term is defined
in Evidence Code section 250), including electronically stored information,
relating to any contract alleged in Plaintiff’s First Amended Complaint. 
In the court’s September 6, 2023 order, the court (1) found that Plaintiff’s
response to Defendant’s Requests for Production of Documents, Set One, number 2
(i) included an incomplete statement of compliance, and (ii) included
objections that were without merit, and therefore (2) ordered Plaintiff to
serve a further written response and to produce responsive documents to
Defendant’s Requests for Production, Set One, number 2, which requested the
production of all documents and communications relating to “any contract
alleged in” Plaintiff’s complaint.  (Sep.
6, 2023 Order, pp. 2:16-20, 6:6-12; Lowe Decl., Ex. C, Pl. Responses to
Requests for Production, p. 3:25-27; Def. Sep. Statement, p. 12:13-15.)  Plaintiff did not serve further written
responses to this document demand and did not produce responsive documents
thereto as ordered by the court in its September 6, 2023 order.  (Lowe Decl., ¶ 24.)   Thus,
the court finds that, in order to remedy the prejudice suffered by Defendant as
a result of Plaintiff’s failure to serve a further written response and to
produce responsive documents to this document demand, Plaintiff should be
precluded from introducing writings related to any contract alleged in his
First Amended Complaint.  (Victor
Valley Union High School District, supra, 91 Cal.App.5th at p. 1158.)

Third, the court grants Defendant’s request to impose an evidence
sanction precluding Plaintiff from introducing any writings (as that term is defined
in Evidence Code section 250), including electronically stored information,
relating to Plaintiff’s allegation in paragraph 21 of his First Amended
Complaint that “Plaintiff [John Christian Lukes] sent an email to [Timothy J.]
Sloan confirming the terms of the Contract to which they had agreed[,]”
including the alleged May 28, 2010 email and any written responses thereto.  (FAC ¶¶ 16 [defining “Contract” to be the
finder’s fee contract formed between Cervenka and Lukes and Defendant], 21
[alleging the existence of the May 28, 2010 email].) 
In the court’s September 6, 2023 order, the court (1) found that
Plaintiff’s response to Defendant’s Requests for Production of Documents, Set
One, number 22 (i) included an incomplete statement of compliance, and (ii)
included objections that were without merit, and therefore (2) ordered
Plaintiff to serve a further written response and produce responsive documents
to Defendant’s Requests for Production, Set One, number 22, which requested the
production of all documents and communications relating to Plaintiff’s
allegation that “‘Plaintiff sent an email to Sloan confirming the terms of the
Contract to which they agreed,’ including the alleged May 28, 2010 email and
any responses thereto.”  (Sep. 6, 2023
Order, pp. 2:16-20, 6:6-12; Lowe Decl., Ex. C, Pl. Responses to Requests for
Production, p. 11:23-26; Def. Sep. Statement, p. 77:10-13.)  Plaintiff did not serve further written
responses to this document demand and did not produce responsive documents
thereto as ordered by the court in its September 6, 2023 order.  (Lowe Decl., ¶ 24.)   Thus, the court finds that, in order to
remedy the prejudice suffered by Defendant as a result of Plaintiff’s failure
to serve a further written response and to produce responsive documents to this
document demand, Plaintiff should be precluded from introducing writings relating
to the May 28, 2010 email.  (Victor
Valley Union High School District, supra, 91 Cal.App.5th at p.
1158.) 
The court notes that, in Plaintiff’s opposition, Plaintiff asserts
that he “testified that he does not have the email because he maintains that
his email account was hacked, [and] that certain emails including that one were
deleted and others are altered.”  (Mot.,
p. 5:18-19; Leonardo Decl., ¶ 20.) 
However, Plaintiff did not (1) provide competent evidence in support of
that assertion (including a copy of the transcript of Plaintiff’s deposition),
or (2) serve on Defendant a further written response stating that he is unable
to comply with that demand after conducting a diligent search and reasonable
inquiry because the particular item has been destroyed, lost, misplaced, or
stolen, or is no longer in his possession, custody, or control.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.230.)  The court further notes that Plaintiff’s
initial and amended responses to this document demand did not include such a
response.  (Lowe Decl., Ex. B, p. 5:25-28
[Pl. September 14, 2022 response to Request No. 22]; Lowe Decl., Ex. C, pp.
11:27-12:6 [Pl. October 21, 2022 amended response to Request No. 22].) 
Fourth, the court grants Defendant’s request to impose an evidence
sanction precluding Plaintiff from introducing any writings (as that term is
defined in Evidence Code section 250), including electronically stored
information, relating to Plaintiff’s allegation in paragraph 34 of the First
Amended Complaint that “the statements by [Timothy J.] Sloan and [Stephen] Silk
to Plaintiff in 2015 regarding the Portfolio transaction [as alleged in
paragraphs 30 and 31 in the First Amended Complaint] were false.”
In the court’s September 6, 2023 order, the court (1) found that
Plaintiff’s response to Defendant’s Requests for Production of Documents, Set
One, number 35 (i) included an incomplete statement of compliance, and (ii)
included objections that were without merit, and therefore (2) ordered
Plaintiff to serve a further written response and to produce responsive
documents to Defendant’s Requests for Production, Set One, number 35, which
requested the production of all documents and communications relating to Plaintiff’s
allegation in paragraph 34 of Plaintiff’s First Amended Complaint “that ‘the
statements by Sloan and Silk to [Plaintiff] in 2015 regarding the Portfolio
were false.’”  (Sep. 6, 2023 Order, pp. 2:16-20,
6:6-12; Lowe Decl., Ex. C, Pl. Responses to Requests for Production, p. 17:22-25;
Def. Sep. Statement, p. 137:20-23.) 
Plaintiff did not serve further written responses to this document
demand and did not produce responsive documents thereto as ordered by the court
in its September 6, 2023 order.  (Lowe
Decl., ¶ 24.)   Thus, the court finds
that, in order to remedy the prejudice suffered by Defendant as a result of
Plaintiff’s failure to serve a further written response and to produce
responsive documents to this document demand, Plaintiff should be precluded
from introducing writings relating to his allegation that Timothy Sloan and
Stephen Silk’s statements to him in 2015 regarding the portfolio were false.  (Victor Valley Union High School District,
supra, 91 Cal.App.5th at p. 1158.) 
Fifth, the court grants Defendant’s request for monetary sanctions.[2]  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2023.030, subd. (a), 2031.310,
subd. (i).)  The court finds that $8,150
((4 hours x $750 hourly rate for attorney Lowe) + (1 hour x $650 hourly rate
for attorney Crain) + (10 hours x $450 hourly rate for attorney Bolender)) is a
reasonable amount of sanctions to impose against Plaintiff.  (Lowe Decl., ¶¶ 27-30.) 
            Sixth, the court denies Defendant’s
request that the court further order Plaintiff to comply with the September 6,
2023 order because the court has already issued an order compelling Plaintiff
to provide the discovery set forth therein. 
Seventh, the court denies Defendant’s request that the court impose
sanctions against Plaintiff in the amount of $1,500, payable to the court,
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 177.5.
Finally, the court recognizes that this motion concerns the production
of electronically stored information.  However,
while “the court shall not impose sanctions on a party or any attorney of a
party for failure to provide electronically stored information that has been
lost, damaged, altered, or overwritten as the result of the routine, good faith
operation of an electronic information system[,]” Plaintiff did not present
argument or evidence establishing that the safe harbor provisions apply.[3]  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2031.310, subds. (j)(1),
2023.030, subd. (f)(1).) 
ORDER
            The court grants in part defendant
Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.’s motion to compel compliance with court order and for
issue and evidence sanctions or, alternatively, monetary sanctions as follows. 
            The court grants defendant Wells
Fargo Bank, N.A.’s motion for evidence sanctions against plaintiff John
Christian Lukes. 
            The court orders that plaintiff John
Christian Lukes is prohibited from introducing into evidence any writings (as
that term is defined in Evidence Code section 250), including electronically
stored information, relating to:  
(1) any contract alleged in plaintiff John Christian Lukes’s First
Amended Complaint, filed January 24, 2022;
(2) plaintiff John Christian Lukes’s allegation in paragraph 21 of his
First Amended Complaint that “Plaintiff [John Christian Lukes] sent an email to
[Timothy J.] Sloan confirming the terms of the Contract to which they had
agreed[,]” including the alleged May 28, 2010 email and any written responses
thereto; and 
(3) plaintiff John Christian Lukes’s allegation in paragraph 34 of the
First Amended Complaint that “the statements by [Timothy J.] Sloan and
[Stephen] Silk to Plaintiff [John Christian Lukes] in 2015 regarding the
Portfolio transaction [as alleged in paragraphs 30 and 31 in the First Amended
Complaint] were false.”
            The court grants defendant Wells
Fargo Bank, N.A.’s motion for monetary sanctions against plaintiff John
Christian Lukes. 
            The court orders plaintiff John
Christian Lukes to pay monetary sanctions to defendant Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.
in the amount of $8,150 within 30 days of the date of this order. 
            The court denies all other relief
requested in defendant Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.’s motion.
            The court orders defendant Wells
Fargo Bank, N.A. to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
