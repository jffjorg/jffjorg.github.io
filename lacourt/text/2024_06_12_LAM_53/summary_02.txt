And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the case and made a tentative ruling. The defendant has moved for monetary sanctions, which the court has granted in part. The court has also denied the defendant's motion to compel plaintiff's further responses to special and form interrogatories. The plaintiff has alleged that their email account was hacked and that certain emails were deleted or altered. However, the court notes that the plaintiff has not presented competent evidence to support these allegations. The plaintiff's claims of hacking are therefore disputed. The court will review this matter further before making a final ruling.
