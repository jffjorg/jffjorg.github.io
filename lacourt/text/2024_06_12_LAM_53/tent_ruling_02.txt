[1] Also
in the court’s September 6, 2023 order, the court granted in part Defendant’s
motions to compel Plaintiff’s further responses to its Special and Form
Interrogatories, and denied Defendant’s motion to compel Plaintiff’s further
responses to its Requests for Admission. 
(Sep. 6, 2023 Order, pp. 6:21-22, 6:3-4, 7:11-12.) 


[2] Although
the caption of this motion states that it is a motion for monetary sanctions in
the alternative, Defendant’s notice of motion and moving papers expressly
request monetary sanctions in addition to the other relief requested therein,
and not as an alternative to such relief. 
(Notice of Mot., p. 3:7-9; Mot., pp. 9:8-9, 9:27-28, 21:2-9, 22:7-11.)


[3] As
set forth above, although Plaintiff asserts that his email account was hacked
and that certain emails were deleted or altered, Plaintiff did not present (1) competent
evidence of that fact, or (2) argue that such deletions or alterations occurred
as a result of the routine, good faith operation of an electronic information
system as contemplated by the safe harbor provisions.  (Leonardo Decl., ¶ 21.)
