English-text summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The court has denied the defendants' motion to compel arbitration. The defendants sought to compel arbitration of a controversy between the parties, but the court found that the arbitration agreement was not properly authenticated. The defendants presented the declaration of Lena Song, VP of Human Resources for Defendant IGS Solutions, LLC, which stated that the plaintiff executed an arbitration agreement in August 2020. However, the plaintiff denied signing the agreement and presented testimony that he never signed any agreement. The court found that the defendants failed to meet their burden of establishing the existence of a valid agreement to arbitrate. The court also found that the agreement was unconscionably vague as to who is to bear the costs of arbitration and the parties' discovery rights.
