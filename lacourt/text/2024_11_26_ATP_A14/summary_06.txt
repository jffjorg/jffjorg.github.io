And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has granted Plaintiffs' Motion to Compel Deposition Attendance of a Person Most Qualified (PMQ) and has also awarded sanctions to Plaintiffs in the amount of $937.50. The Court found that General Motors LLC's objections to the deposition notice were without merit and that the Plaintiffs have good cause to seek the discovery information. The Court also noted that General Motors LLC failed to show substantial justification for not providing the PMQ and that the Plaintiffs' meet and confer efforts were sufficient. The Court ruled that the requested deposition testimony is relevant and necessary to the Plaintiffs' claims and that the Plaintiffs do not seek trade secret material. The Court also denied General Motors LLC's request for sanctions and awarded sanctions to Plaintiffs in the amount of $937.50.
