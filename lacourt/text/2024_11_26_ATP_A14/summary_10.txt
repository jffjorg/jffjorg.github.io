And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled on a motion to strike the First Amended Complaint filed by the City of Lancaster, Monique Coreen Molina, Gary L. Carrera, and Brenda Carrera. The plaintiffs, Cataleya Inez Lopez, Nia Violet Lopez, and Noah Alexander Gomez, brought this wrongful death action on behalf of the decedent, Joseph Oscar Lopez, who died as a result of a collision with a vehicle driven by Defendant Molina. The plaintiffs alleged that the defendants acted intentionally, recklessly, or carelessly, and sought punitive damages.

The judge found that the First Amended Complaint contains conclusory allegations of malice, which is insufficient to support a punitive damages award. The judge also found that the plaintiffs failed to meet the pleading standard required for punitive damages, and that the defendants are entitled to strike those portions of the complaint. The judge granted the motion to strike portions of the First Amended Complaint suggesting defendants acted intentionally, recklessly, or carelessly, and portions of the FAC in reference to punitive damages.

Additionally, the judge found that punitive damages are unavailable for the plaintiffs' wrongful death claim because the death did not result from a felony homicide claim for which defendant was convicted. The judge noted that while punitive damages are allowable in survival actions, the plaintiffs must meet the pleading standard required for the underlying negligence action.
