And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has considered the Plaintiff's Motion for Alternate Service and finds that the Plaintiff has provided sufficient evidence of due diligence in attempting to serve the Defendant with the complaint and summons. The process server has made multiple attempts to serve the Defendant at different times and dates, and despite the Defendant's efforts to evade service, the process server has been able to observe noises and lights on inside the Defendant's home while the Defendant's vehicle was present. The Judge notes that the Plaintiff has failed to cite any legal authority to support their request, but finds that the Plaintiff's actions are reasonable and that the Defendant is indeed evading service. Therefore, the Judge grants the Motion for Alternate Service and directs that the documents be served by posting at the Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles.
