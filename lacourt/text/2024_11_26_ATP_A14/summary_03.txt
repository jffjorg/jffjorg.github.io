And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge notes that RFP No. 10 was not mentioned in the Joint Informal Discovery Conference Statement filed on April 8, 2024. The Judge also clarifies the definitions of "ENGINE DEFECT" and "ELECTRICAL DEFECT" based on Separate Statements filed on May 15, 2024. According to these statements, "ENGINE DEFECT" refers to defects resulting in symptoms such as engine problems, oil leaks, and repair history concerns, while "ELECTRICAL DEFECT" refers to defects resulting in symptoms such as electrical system problems, collision switch issues, and camera function failures. The Judge also references the Lemon Law Addendum, which defines a "substantially similar customer complaint" as one that reports the same nature of symptom, malfunction, or repair problem as listed in a work order or repair order for the subject vehicle. The Judge's tentative ruling aims to clarify these definitions and provide a framework for understanding the disputes and issues in the case.
