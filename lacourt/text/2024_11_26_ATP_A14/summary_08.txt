Summary:

The Judge's Tentative Ruling denies the Defendant's Motion to Compel Arbitration and Request to Stay. The Defendant sought to compel arbitration and stay the court proceedings based on an arbitration clause in a Storage Agreement between the parties. The Court finds that the arbitration clause does not apply to the Plaintiff's claim, which arises from an accident involving a rental truck. The Court holds that the Defendant failed to meet its burden to establish a valid arbitration agreement and that the Plaintiff's claim is outside the scope of the Storage Agreement.
