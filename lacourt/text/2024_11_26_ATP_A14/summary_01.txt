Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling addresses a motion for terminating, issue, and/or evidentiary sanctions against defendants Antelope Valley Specialty Surgical Center, LLC and Brian Lai, M.D. for alleged misuse of the discovery process. The plaintiff, Saundra Putziger, alleges that the defendants failed to produce relevant images of a procedure performed on her in March 2020, which resulted in severe and permanent injuries. The plaintiff argues that the defendants intentionally destroyed or lost the images and that they had a duty to preserve them.

The defendants argue that they did not intentionally destroy or lose the images and that they had no duty to preserve them. They also argue that the plaintiff failed to prove that they destroyed or lost the images and that the motion is procedurally defective.

The Court finds that the plaintiff has failed to prove that the defendants intentionally destroyed or lost the images and that the motion is denied in its entirety. The Court also finds that the defendants did not have a duty to preserve the images and that the safe-harbor provision of California Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.030(f) applies.
