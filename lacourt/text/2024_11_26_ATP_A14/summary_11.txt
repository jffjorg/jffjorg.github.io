And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on RTMS's motion to compel AVH and Plaintiff to arbitration. The court has granted RTMS's motion to compel Plaintiff to arbitration, but denied the motion to compel AVH to arbitration. The judge found that AVH is not a party to the agreement and is not bound to the arbitration provision. The court also found that there is no consideration binding AVH to the agreement and that the agreement does not impose any obligation on AVH. Furthermore, the court lacks evidence of any sufficiently close preexisting relationship between RTMS and AVH. The case is stayed pending arbitration.
