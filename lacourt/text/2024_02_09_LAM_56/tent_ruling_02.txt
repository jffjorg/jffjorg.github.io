[1] Although
the pleading alleges that the Policy is included as an attachment, the FAXC
does not include a copy of the document. 
(See FAXC ¶ 19.)  The
body of the FAXC includes the text of certain provisions of the Policy.  (See FAXC ¶¶ 20-24.) 


[2] The
Motion is unopposed.  Any opposition
papers were required to have been filed and served at least nine court days
before the hearing under California Code of Civil Procedure (“CCP”)
section 1005, subdivision (b).  The Court
notes that Caring Heart’s opposition to the demurrer (the “Opposition”)
includes arguments that respond to the points raised in the Motion.


[3] The
Court has not considered the extrinsic evidence presented in the Opposition.
