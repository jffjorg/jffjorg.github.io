And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the motion for leave to file a third amended complaint by the plaintiff, YOGI SECURITIES HOLDINGS, LLC, against the defendants, FLOYD MAYWEATHER JR., et al. The proposed third amended complaint includes allegations of conspiracy and aiding and abetting theories of liability against the defendants.

The judge finds that the motion sets forth sufficient facts to permit the filing of the third amended complaint. The new allegations in the proposed third amended complaint solely pertain to the inclusion of conspiracy and aiding/abetting theories of liability which arise out of the underlying facts already alleged in the operative second amended complaint.

The judge notes that the proposed third amended complaint does not include the specific information that was learned from the defendants' discovery responses. The judge finds that the inclusion of alternative theories of liability in the third amended complaint will not prejudice the defendants.

The judge grants the motion with five days' leave to file the third amended complaint. The parties are ordered to give notice of this ruling, and parties who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed by the instructions provided on the court website.
