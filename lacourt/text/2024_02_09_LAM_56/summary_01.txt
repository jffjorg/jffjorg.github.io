And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has considered the demurrer and motion to strike filed by Moving Defendant, Certain Underwriters at Lloyd's of London, and the opposition and reply papers filed by Responding Party, Caring Heart In-Home Care Services, Inc.

The Court finds that the first and second causes of action for breach of contract and breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing are sufficient and overrules the demurrer.

The Court sustains the demurrer to the third cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty without leave to amend, finding that Caring Heart has conceded the issue and failed to provide facts to support the claim.

The Court grants the motion to strike with respect to the allegations concerning punitive damages, finding that the allegations are conclusory and insufficient to satisfy the heightened standard for alleging an entitlement to punitive damages.

The Court grants the motion to strike with respect to the allegation regarding attorney's fees stated in connection with the first cause of action, but allows Caring Heart to amend its claim within 20 days.

The hearing is scheduled for February 9, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. in Department 56.
