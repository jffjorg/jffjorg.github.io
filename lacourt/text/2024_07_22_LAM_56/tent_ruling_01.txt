MOVING
PARTY: Defendant CONTEMPORARY SERVICES CORPORATION (“Defendant”)
 
RESPONDING PARTY: Plaintiff
TIMOTHY SETTLES (“Plaintiff”’)
 
BACKGROUND
             On July 20, 2023, Plaintiff filed a form
complaint (the “Complaint”) against Defendant, asserting the following as causes
of action: 1) general negligence; 2) intentional tort; (3) intentional
infliction of emotional distress; 4) undue mental anguish; 5) bad faith
business practice; 6) defamation of character; and 7) violation of the
“doctrine of unclean hands.”
 
            On April 23, 2024, Plaintiff filed a
Request for Entry of Default and/or Clerk’s Judgment (“Request for Default”).  On the same day, the Clerk of Court issued a
Notice of Rejection of Default (“Notice of Rejection”), notifying Plaintiff
that the Request for Default was rejected for the reasons cited therein.  
 
            In a Minute Order dated May 23,
2024, the Court noted the Notice of Rejection of Default, and instructed
Plaintiff to resubmit the Request for Default by July 2, 2024.  On May 24, 2024 --before any revised Request
for Default was filed or accepted by the Court, Defendant filed a Demurrer to
the Complaint (the “Demurrer”), and concurrently filed a Motion to Strike
Portions of Plaintiff’s Complaint (the “Motion to Strike”).
 
            On July 8, Plaintiff filed a
document entitled “Plaintiff’s Request of the Court to Take Judicial Notice
That the Defendant’s Attorney Has No Standing to File Any Documents While in
Default, See Exhibits.” (“Plaintiff’s Request”.)
 
The
Court notes that Plaintiff is under the mistaken belief that Defendant is now
in default.  In fact, Plaintiff’s Request
for Default was rejected, as indicated on the exhibit attached to Plaintiff’s
Request’s Exhibit, and no subsequent Request for Default was submitted by
Plaintiff, much less entered by the Court. 
Therefore, Defendant is not in default and has indeed appeared in this
case by filing the Demurrer and the Motion to Strike.
 
            Recognizing Plaintiff’s misunderstanding,
the Court, which wishes all issues to be determined on their merit rather than
by a party’s erroneous failure to oppose, on its own motion, continues the
hearing for the Demurrer and Motion to Strike to August 14, 2024 at 8:30 a.m. in
order to allow Plaintiff to file a substantive opposition, if desired.  All opposition and reply papers will be due
based upon this new hearing date.
 
Moving
Party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.            
 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed
by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive an email
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off
calendar.
 
Dated this 22nd day of July 2024
