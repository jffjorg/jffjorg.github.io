And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the papers filed by the parties in this case and is making a tentative ruling. The case is a representative action filed by the plaintiff, Elizabeth Shuai Wong, against the defendant, Flipfit, fka Humans, Inc. and Nooruldeen Alaarif, alleging labor code violations. The defendant failed to respond to the plaintiff's discovery requests, but has since responded without objections. The plaintiff filed a motion to compel responses and the defendant has filed a motion to compel further discovery responses.

The judge finds that the defendant's responses were delayed due to unexpected medical issues experienced by the previous attorney handling the case and that there have been multiple changes in the counsel representing the defendant. The judge also notes that the plaintiff agreed to an extension for the defendant to provide responses and that the defendant complied with this deadline.

As a result, the judge is denying the motions to compel responses as moot and is denying the requests for monetary sanctions. The judge finds that, under the circumstances, there is substantial justification for the delayed responses and that monetary sanctions are not warranted. The judge is ordering the parties to give notice of this ruling and is setting the matter for hearing on July 22, 2024.
