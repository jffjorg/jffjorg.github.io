And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Timothy Settles vs. Contemporary Services Corp. The court notes that the plaintiff is under the mistaken belief that the defendant is in default, but in fact, the defendant is not in default and has appeared in the case by filing a demurrer and motion to strike. The court has continued the hearing on these motions to August 14, 2024, to allow the plaintiff to file a substantive opposition, if desired. The court has also instructed the plaintiff to resubmit its request for default and warned that if the plaintiff fails to do so, the motion will be placed off calendar.
