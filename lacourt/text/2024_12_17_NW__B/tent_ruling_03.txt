TRIAL
  DATE: NONE



 
I.      
BACKGROUND  
On May 17, 2022, Plaintiff Marshall Krupp
(“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Defendants Kroenke Sports &
Entertainment LLC (“Kroenke”), StadCo LA, LLC (“StadCo”), the Chargers Football
Company (“Chargers”), the Contemporary Services Corporation (“Contemporary
Services”), and Does 1 to 50 (collectively “Defendants”) alleging two causes of
action: (1) premises liability; and (2) negligence.
On October 27, 2023, Defendants Kroenke,
StadCo, and the Chargers filed a motion for summary judgment on Plaintiff’s
complaint.
On November 8, 2023, Contemporary Services
filed a motion for summary judgment on Plaintiff’s complaint.
On June 5, 2024, the action was reassigned to
the Honorable Karen Moskowitz in Department B at Van Nuys Courthouse East,
effective June 24, 2024.
On August 30, 2024, Kroenke, StadCo, and the
Chargers’s motion for summary judgment was granted in their favor. On the same
date, Contemporary Services’s motion for summary judgment was also granted in
their favor.
On November 15, 2024, Plaintiff filed the
instant motion for new trial of Kroenke Sports & Entertainment LLC, StadCo
LA, LLC, and the Chargers Football Company (hereinafter “Defendants”)’s motion
for summary judgment.
On November 27, 2024, Defendants filed their
opposition.
On December 4, 2024, Plaintiff filed their
reply.
 
II.         
LEGAL
STANDARD
The determination of a motion for new trial
rests so completely within the trial judge’s discretion that it will not be
disturbed on appeal unless a manifest and unmistakable abuse of discretion
clearly appears. (Schelbaurer v. Butler Mfg. Co. (1984) 35 Cal.3d 442,
452.) The rationale is that the trial judge is familiar with the evidence,
witnesses and proceedings of the case and is in the best position to determine
whether a new trial should be granted. (Jacoby v. Feldman (1978) 81 Cal.App.3d
432, 446.)  
A motion for new trial asks the trial court
to reexamine one or more issues of fact or law after a trial and decision by
judge or jury. (Cal. Code of Civ. Proc §§ 656 and 657.) Since the right to a
new trial is purely statutory, exact compliance is required with the procedural
steps for making and determining a motion for new trial. Any significant
departure from the procedural requirements deprives the trial court of power to
grant the motion. The grounds for new trial are also entirely statutory and,
thus, the motion must be based on one or more of the following statutory
grounds:
(1) Irregularity in the proceedings;
(2) Jury misconduct;
(3) Accident or surprise;
(4) Newly discovered evidence;
(5) Excessive or inadequate damages;
(6) Insufficient evidence;
(7) Verdict or decision “against law;” or
(8) Error in law during trial.
(CCP § 657(1)-(7).)
If a motion for new trial is “made for a
cause mentioned on the first, second, third and fourth subdivisions of Section
657, it must be made upon affidavits; otherwise, it must be made on the minutes
of the court.” (CCP § 658.) Thus, a motion for new trial based on irregularity
in the proceedings, misconduct of the jury, accident or surprise or newly
discovered evidence must be supported by affidavits. Other motions based on
insufficiency of the evidence, a verdict or decision against law, an error in
law or excessive or inadequate damages must be made on the minutes of the
court. It is “implicit in the statement of the grounds of the motion whether it
will be made upon affidavits or the minutes of the court, or both.” (Nichols
v. Hast (1965) 62 Cal.2d 598, 601.) 
An order granting summary judgment is
properly challenged by a motion for new trial. (Aguilar v. Atlantic
Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 858.) “Once judgment has been entered
. . . the court may not reconsider it and loses its unrestricted power
to change the judgment. It may correct judicial error only through certain
limited procedures such as motions for new trial and motions to vacate the
judgment.” (Passanti v. Williams (1990) 225 Cal.App.3d 1602, 1606.) Where
opposing party's evidence was sufficient to create triable fact issue, summary
judgment was “error in law” for the purposes of CCP § 657. (Brewer v.
Remington (2020) 46 Cal.App.5th 14, 23.)
 
III.      
DISCUSSION 
Plaintiff
moves for a new trial on the following grounds: (1) insufficient evidence; and (2)
the initial summary judgment was decided by error of law. (Motion p. 2:6-3-6.)
 
Insufficient
Evidence
Procedural
Deficiencies
As a preliminary matter, the Court
notes that Plaintiff failed to provide the minutes of the court upon which
their motion for new trial for insufficiency of the evidence relies. This
provision is a strict statutory requirement pursuant to CCP § 658. Therefore,
Plaintiff’s motion is denied for procedural deficiencies. However, for both
parties’ benefit, the Court now analyzes the motion’s substance.
 
Gross
Negligence
Plaintiff argues that there is an
insufficiency of the evidence to support granting of summary judgment since Defendants
failed to present any evidence negating Plaintiff’s gross negligence claim.
To support a theory of gross
negligence, “a plaintiff must allege facts showing either a want of even scant
care or an extreme departure from the ordinary standard of conduct.
[Citations].” (Anderson v. Fitness Internat., LLC (2016) 4 Cal.App.5th
867, 881.) Gross negligence “falls short of a reckless disregard of
consequences, and differs from ordinary negligence only in degree, and not in
kind. [Citations].” (Ibid.)
Plaintiff argues that Defendants moved
for summary judgment on the grounds that Plaintiff waived their liability, yet failed
to present evidence that they did not act with gross negligence, which may not
be barred by a waiver agreement. (Eriksson v. Nunnik (2011) 191
Cal.App.4th 826, 856.) Additionally, Plaintiff argues that they presented facts
which could form the basis for a jury’s determination of gross negligence as an
issue of fact. (Motion p. 5:14-16.)
However, Plaintiff misstates Defendants’
burden on a motion for summary judgment. Contemporary Services did not need to
disprove gross negligence since Plaintiff’s complaint failed to allege facts
that, on its face, support a theory of gross negligence. (See Joshi v.
Fitness International, LLC (2022) 80 Cal.App.5th 814, 828.) Plaintiff’s
complaint only pleads facts alleging the existence of a known defect and the
failure to cure it, stating, inter alia, that the “[subject premises]
was in a dangerous and defective condition because of the unsafe curb grade,
face, slope, width, height, depth, color and/or lack of visibility to
pedestrians. Defendants . . . created the dangerous and defective condition,
and/or knew or had notice of the . . . defective condition . . .” (Complaint ¶
15.) However, “conduct demonstrating the failure to guard against, or warn of,
a dangerous condition typically does not rise to the level of gross
negligence.” (Anderson v. Fitness International (2016) 4 Cal.App.5th
867, 881). Therefore, Plaintiff’s complaint did not allege facts giving rise to
gross negligence and, consequently, Defendants had no duty to defend against
such a claim.
 
Trivial
Defect
Plaintiff argues that the Court,
when finding that the subject curb defect was “trivial,” failed to consider
“the extensive evidence presented by Plaintiff which a jury could rely upon” to
find that the defect was not trivial in nature. (Motion p. 5:26 and 6:1-2.) However,
just because Plaintiff disagrees with how the Court weighed his evidence does
not mean there was an insufficiency of evidence for the purpose of CCP § 657.
“[A] new trial shall not be granted upon the ground of insufficiency of the
evidence . . . unless after weighing the evidence the court is convinced from
the entire record, including reasonable inferences therefrom, that the court or
jury clearly should have reached a different verdict or decision.” (CCP
§ 657)(emphasis added.) Here, Plaintiff argues that a triable issue of material
fact exists as to the trivial nature of the defect since Plaintiff’s view was
obstructed by the large crowd that he was walking with. (Motion p. 6:18-25.) In
determining whether a defect is trivial, the court “should consider whether the
walkway had any broken pieces or jagged edges and other conditions of the walkway
surrounding the defect, such as whether there was debris, grease, or water
concealing the defect, as well as whether the accident occurred at night in an
unlighted area or some other condition obstructed a pedestrian’s view of the
defect. [Citation].” (Stathoulis v. City of Montebello (2008) 164
Cal.App.4th 559, 567.) However, a large crowd is not a condition which
exacerbates the trivial nature of a defect. In fact, the evidence that there
was a large crowd and Plaintiff was the only individual to trip and fall over
the curb supports the Court’s initial finding that the defect was trivial in
nature. Therefore, Plaintiff fails to present new circumstances, fatcs, or
evidence showing that the initial motion for summary judgment was decided on an
insufficiency of the evidence.
 
Error of Law
A
motion for new trial based on error of law must be made on the minutes of the
court. (CCP § 658.) Once again, Plaintiff failed to include the minutes of the
court which their motion relies upon. Even assuming Plaintiff’s motion was not
procedurally deficient, Plaintiff only supports their argument with a
conclusory allegation that there are triable issues of material fact as to Defendants’
gross negligence and whether the defect was trivial in nature. (Motion p.
7:7-9.) As discussed supra, these arguments fail.
 
IV.   
CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff’s
motion for a new trial pursuant to CCP §§ 656 and 657 is DENIED.
