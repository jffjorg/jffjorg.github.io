  Case Number:  21STCV08660    Hearing Date:   December 17, 2024    Dept:  B Hearing:          12/17/2024
Re:                   21STCV08660,
Van Kirk, MTC Plaintiff’s Depo.
 
BACKGROUND
 
On November 7, 2023, Defendant Secure Property
Management Inc. (“Defendant”) initially noticed the deposition of Plaintiff
Kahlee Van Kirk (“Plaintiff”), for December 1, 2023. (Ruiz Decl. ¶ 3; Exh. A
[notice].) After Plaintiff retained new counsel, the parties agreed to
reschedule Plaintiff’s deposition to January 3, 2024. (Ibid. at ¶ 3;
Exh. B [correspondence].) After Plaintiff indicated further unavailability, the
deposition was rescheduled to April 5, 2024. (Ibid. at ¶¶ 4-6; Exh. C,
D, and E [meet and confer correspondences].) Plaintiff failed to appear for
their April 5, 2024, deposition. (Ibid. at ¶ 6.) At this time, defense
counsel initially learned that Plaintiff also suffered a back injury, had a
lumbar MRI, and saw a pain management doctor. (Ibid.) Based on this new
information, defense counsel served additional discovery on Plaintiff. (Ibid.
at ¶ 7.)
 
On
September 12, 2024, Defendant served their new notice of taking Plaintiff’s
deposition, scheduled for October 9, 2024. (Ruiz Decl. ¶ 9; Exh. F [notice].)
Plaintiff did not object. (Ibid. at ¶ 10.) However, Plaintiff failed to
appear at the noticed October 9, 2024, deposition. (Ibid. at ¶ 12; Exh.
I [certificate of non-attendance].) Neither Plaintiff nor Plaintiff’s counsel
provided a reason for their non-appearance. (Ibid. at ¶ 13.)
 
On
October 23, 2024, Defendant filed the instant motion to compel Plaintiff’s
deposition. Plaintiff did not file an opposition. 
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
Any party may obtain any discovery of
information, documents, land, property, or electronically stored information so
long as the discoverable matter is not privileged, is relevant to the subject
matter and can lead one to admissible evidence. (Cal. Code of Civ. Proc. §
2017.010.)
 
CCP § 2025.450 provides in
pertinent part the following:
 
“(a) If, after service of a
deposition notice, a party to the action or an officer, director, 
managing agent, or employee of a
party, or a person designated by an organization that
is a party under Section 2025.230,
without having served a valid objection under 
Section 2025.410, fails to appear for
examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce 
for inspection any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing 
described in the deposition notice,
the party giving the notice may move for an order 
compelling the deponent's attendance
and testimony, and the production for inspection             of any document, electronically stored
information, or tangible thing described in the          deposition notice.
 
(b) A motion under subdivision (a)
shall comply with both of the following:
  
(1) The motion shall set forth specific facts
showing good cause justifying the production for inspection of any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the
deposition notice.
 
(2) The motion shall be accompanied by a meet
and confer declaration under Section 2016.040 or, when the deponent fails
to attend the deposition and produce the documents, electronically stored
information, or things described in the deposition notice, by a declaration
stating that the petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire about the
nonappearance.
 
DISCUSSION
 
CCP § 2025.010 states
that “[a]ny party may obtain discovery . . . by taking in California the oral
deposition of any person, including any party to the action.” (CCP § 2025.010.)
Here, Defendant properly served each notice of deposition on Plaintiff. (Ruiz
Decl. ¶¶ 3 and 9; Exhs. A and F [notices].) Plaintiff did not object to these
notices. (Ruiz Decl. ¶ 10.) However, Plaintiff failed to appear at their
noticed April 5, 2024, and October 9, 2024, depositions. (Ruiz Decl. ¶¶ 6 and
12; Exh. I [certificate of non-appearance].)
 
Therefore, pursuant to
CCP §§ 2025.010 and 2025.450, the Court grants Defendant’s motion to compel
Plaintiff’s deposition. Plaintiff is ordered to appear for oral deposition
within 20 days of this hearing.
 
Sanctions
“[i]f a motion under [CCP § 2025.450(a)] is granted, the court shall
impose a monetary sanction . . . in favor of the party who noticed the
deposition and against the deponent or the party with whom the deponent is
affiliated, unless the court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust.” (CCP § 2025.450(g).)
Here, Plaintiff failed to appear for their properly noticed
depositions without substantial justification. Therefore, sanctions are
mandatory pursuant to CCP § 2025.450(g).
Defendant requests sanctions in the amount of $1,215.00, representing
4.5 hours of attorney work at an hourly rate of $170.00, a non-appearance fee
of $220.00, and a $60.00 filing fee. (Ruiz Decl. ¶ 14; Exh. J [non-appearance
invoice].) The Court awards sanctions against Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s
counsel, jointly and severally, payable within 20 days of this Order in the
reduced amount of $1,045.00 as no opposition was filed. 
CONCLUSION
 
For the foregoing
reasons, Defendant’s motion is GRANTED.
 
Plaintiff is ordered to
appear for oral deposition within 20 days of this hearing. Additionally,
Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s counsel, jointly and severally, are ordered to pay
$1,045.00 in sanctions to defense counsel within 20 days of this Order.
 
Moving party to give notice.
