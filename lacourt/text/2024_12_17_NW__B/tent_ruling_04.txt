Plaintiff City of Los Angeles’s Request
for Entry of Default
 
Defendant: Long Beach Towing &
Storage, Inc.
 
TENTATIVE RULING
            
Plaintiff’s request for default judgment
is DENIED.
            
BACKGROUND
            
Plaintiff City of Los Angeles (“City”)
filed a complaint on June 3, 2022, against Defendants Gregory Michael Hanley
(“Hanley”), Long Beach Towing & Storage, Inc. (“Long Beach Towing), and
Does 1 through 10 (collectively “Defendants”) alleging one cause of action for
motor vehicle negligence. Plaintiff alleges that, on or about June 3, 2020,
Defendants negligently operated or entrusted their vehicle as to cause injuries
and damages to Plaintiff.
 
On June 5, 2024, the case was reassigned
to the Honorable Karen Moskowitz in Department B at Van Nuys Courthouse East,
effective June 24, 2024.
 
On December 6, 2024, Plaintiff filed the
instant request for default judgment against Defendant Long Beach Towing.
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
Cal. Code of
Civ. Proc. § 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a party has failed
to timely respond or appear. (Cal. Code of Civ. Proc. § 585.) A party seeking
judgment on the default by the court must file a Request for Court Judgment,
and: (1) a brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other admissible
evidence in support of the judgment requested; (3) interest computations as
necessary; (4) a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) declaration of
nonmilitary status; (6) a proposed form of judgment; (7) a dismissal of all
parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application for separate
judgment under CCP § 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment;
(8) exhibits as necessary; and (9) a request for attorney’s fees if allowed by
statute or by the agreement of the parties. (Cal. Rules of Court Rule
3.1800.) 
 
 
ANALYSIS
 
Plaintiff seeks damages in the total
amount of $353,916.45, representing $353,294.99 in special damages and $621.46
in costs. (See CIV-100 Item 2.)
 
Plaintiff’s request for default judgment
is denied for the following deficiencies:
 
1.     
Plaintiff failed to provide a copy of the
Statement of Damages. (CRC 3.250(a)(20).)
2.     
Plaintiff failed to dismiss or request
entry of default for Defendant Gregory Michael Hanley. (CRC 3.1800(a)(7).)
3.      
CIV-100 and JUD-100 seek principal
damages greater than those specified in Plaintiff’s statement of damages.
 
Therefore, Plaintiff City of Los Angeles’s
request for default judgment against Defendant Long Beach Towing & Storage,
Inc. is DENIED. Plaintiff is put on notice that further denials for
deficiencies risk sanctions or dismissal pursuant to CCP § 538.410.
 
Moving party is ordered to give notice.
