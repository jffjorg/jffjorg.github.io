Significant Statements:
  - "The competing considerations to be evaluated are the policies of discouraging stale claims and compelling reasonable diligence balanced against the strong public policy which seeks to dispose of litigation on the merits rather than on procedural grounds."
  - "However, it is now well established that the policy [of preferring to dispose litigation on the merits] only comes into play when a plaintiff makes a showing of some excusable delay."

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion to dismiss the complaint filed by Federal Express Corporation against Alice Hsueh for failure to prosecute. The judge has found that Federal Express did not proceed with reasonable diligence in prosecuting the action, and that the case has not been brought to trial or conditionally settled within two years of filing the complaint. The judge notes that Federal Express did not attempt service of process until nearly two years after the complaint was filed, and that the company has not engaged in any settlement discussions or negotiations. The judge also finds that the case has become stale and that the evidence has disappeared, substantially prejudicing Hsueh. Therefore, the judge grants Hsueh's motion to dismiss the complaint with prejudice.
