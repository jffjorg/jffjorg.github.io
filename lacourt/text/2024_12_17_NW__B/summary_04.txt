The Plaintiff failed to provide a copy of the Statement of Damages, failed to dismiss or request entry of default for Defendant Gregory Michael Hanley, and the damages claimed in the request for default judgment are not supported by the Statement of Damages. The judge has ordered the Plaintiff to give notice of the denial and has warned that further denials for deficiencies may result in sanctions or dismissal.
