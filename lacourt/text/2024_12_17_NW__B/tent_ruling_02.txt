TRIAL DATE: NONE



 
I.       BACKGROUND
On May 6, 2022, Plaintiff Federal
Express Corporation (“FedEx”) filed a complaint against Defendant Alice Hsueh
(“Hsueh”) and Does 1 through 40 alleging two causes of action: (1) premises
liability; and (2) general negligence. FedEx alleges that, on May 28, 2020,
Lydia Rawlings, while acting within the scope of her employment with FedEx, sustained
injury on Hsueh’s property due to their negligence. (See Complaint.) As
a result, FedEx has paid out and continues to pay workers’ compensation
benefits to Lydia Rawlings.
On June 6, 2024, the case was
reassigned to the Honorable Karen Moskowitz in Department B of Van Nuys
Courthouse East, effective June 24, 2024.
On October 22, 2024, Hsueh brought
the instant motion to dismiss for failure to prosecute.
On
November 21, 2024, Plaintiff filed their opposition.
On
November 26, 2024, Hsueh filed their reply.
 
II.   
LEGAL STANDARD
Cal. Code of Civ. Procedure § 583.410
provides that an action can be dismissed under appropriate circumstances when
made “pursuant to the procedure and in accordance with the criteria prescribed
by rules adopted by the Judicial Council.” (CCP § 583.410(a) and (b).) This
criteria includes:
 
(1) The court's file in the case and the
declarations and supporting data submitted by the parties and, where
applicable, the availability of the moving party and other essential parties
for service of process;
(2) The diligence in seeking to effect
service of process;
(3) The extent to which the parties engaged
in any settlement negotiations or discussions;
(4) The diligence of the parties in pursuing
discovery or other pretrial proceedings, including any extraordinary relief
sought by either party;
(5) The nature and complexity of the case;
(6) The law applicable to the case, including
the pendency of other litigation under a common set of facts or determinative
of the legal or factual issues in the case;
(7) The nature of any extensions of time or
other delay attributable to either party;
(8) The condition of the court's calendar and
the availability of an earlier trial date if the matter was ready for trial;
(9) Whether the interests of justice are best
served by dismissal or trial of the case; and
(10) Any other fact or circumstance relevant
to a fair determination of the issue. 
 
Dismissal is also permitted when an action
has not been brought to trial within three years of its commencement. (CCP §
583.420(a)(2)(A).) Dismissal is even permitted two years after the action is
commenced “for delay in prosecution if the action has not been brought to trial
or conditionally settled within two years after the action was commenced
against the defendant.” (Cal. Rules of Court Rule 3.1340(a).)  
“‘The competing considerations to be
evaluated are the policies of discouraging stale claims and compelling
reasonable diligence balanced against the strong public policy which seeks to
dispose of litigation on the merits rather than on procedural grounds.’ [Citation.]
‘However, it is now well established that the policy [of preferring to dispose
litigation on the merits] only comes into play when a plaintiff makes a showing
of some excusable delay.’ [Citation.]” (Van Keulen v. Cathay Pacific
Airways, Ltd. (2008) 162 Cal.App.4th 122, 131.)
 
III.  ANALYSIS
Hsueh moves to dismiss FedEx’s
complaint with prejudice on the grounds that: (1) FedEx did not proceed with
reasonable diligence in the prosecution of this action as required by CCP §
583.410; and (2) the action has not been brought to trial or conditionally
settled within two years of filing its complaint.
 
Diligence
in Seeking to Effect Service of Process
The Court notes that FedEx did not
attempt service until February 2023, more than nine months after the complaint
was initially filed. (See Dorman October 19, 2023, Decl. at ¶ 7.) FedEx
argues that their decision to wait until damages were ascertained before
sending the complaint out for service “was not unreasonable under the
circumstances.” (Opposition p. 2:25-27.) However, the worker’s compensation
matter was resolved on October 4, 2022. (Dorman Decl. ¶ 5.) FedEx does not
explain its four-month delay in attempting service thereafter. In October 2023,
FedEx stated it would be filing an application for publication of service after
being unable to serve Hsueh. (Ibid. at ¶ 11.) However, FedEx did not
file an application for publication until January 2024. Once again, FedEx does
not explain this delay. Therefore, FedEx’s lack of diligence in seeking to
effect service of process weighs in favor of dismissal pursuant to CCP §
583.410.
 
Diligence
in Pursuing Discovery or Other Pretrial Proceedings
Hsueh answered on March 18, 2024.
FedEx has never indicated it is ready for trial, requested a trial date, or
sought any other pretrial proceedings or extraordinary relief. (Pugh Decl. ¶
4.) The parties have not engaged in any settlement discussions or negotiations.
(Ibid. at ¶ 5.) FedEx has not propounded any discovery on Hsueh. (Ibid.
at ¶ 8.) Therefore, FedEx demonstrates a lack of diligence in pursuing
discovery or other pretrial proceedings, weighing in favor of dismissal
pursuant to CCP § 583.410.
 
Nature
and Complexity of the Case
FedEx’s complaint includes two
causes of action: premises liability and general negligence. To succeed on
these claims, FedEx must prove whether Hsueh owed a duty of care, whether
Rawlings was harmed, whether Hsueh’s negligence was a substantial factor in
causing this harm, Rawlings’s damages resulting from the alleged harm, and
other fact-dependent determinations. (See Cal. Civ. Jury Instructions Nos. 400,
401, 430, 1000, 1001, and 1003.) As Hsueh notes, “this [action] is a fluid situation
that depends on the circumstances on the ground on May 28, 2020 [the date of
the underlying incident]. The fact-intensive nature of the case weighs in favor
of dismissal.” (Motion p. 20:18-19.)
 
Nature
of Any Extensions or Other Delay Attributable to Either Party
Hsueh has not sought any extensions
or otherwise delayed this action. Any delay is wholly attributable to FedEx, a
fact further weighing in favor of dismissal pursuant to § CCP 583.410.
 
Whether
Justice is Best Served by Dismissal or Trial of the Case
Here, the Court considers that the
evidence in this case has all but disappeared, substantially prejudicing Hsueh.
The Complaint references items on the subject property which have since been removed
or stolen. (Pugh Decl. ¶ 11; Lu Decl. ¶ 4.) Here, Hsueh could not avail herself
of discovery prior to service, which is the formal method by which to preserve
evidence. (Scarzella v. DeMers (1993) 17 Cal.App.4th 1762, 1771.)
Service was not effectuated until nearly two years after FedEx filed its
complaint. Courts may infer prejudice in cases involving unreasonable delays in
service. (Luti v. Graco, Inc. (1985) 170 Cal.App.3d 228, 233.)
 
Any
Other Fact Relevant to a Fair Determination of the Issue
The Court notes that FedEx filed an
untimely opposition to the instant motion. FedEx argues that its untimely
filing should not be considered as it resulted from a calendaring error. (Ibid.
at p. 4:5-8.) The Court would ordinarily overlook such an error. However,
this untimeliness only adds to the mounting evidence of FedEx’s failure to
diligently prosecute this action.
In
its untimely opposition, FedEx fails to explain its lack of diligence in prosecution.
Instead, the opposition claims that Hsueh has failed to show that FedEx’s delay
was unreasonable or that it prejudiced the defense. (Opposition p. 1:13-16.) However,
FedEx misstates the burden upon a motion to dismiss for failure to prosecute.
“[I]t is well established that the
policy [of preferring to dispose litigation on the merits] only comes into play
when a plaintiff makes a showing of some excusable delay.’ [Citation.]” (Van
Keulen v. Cathay Pacific Airways, Ltd. (2008) 162 Cal.App.4th 122, 131.)
 
IV.
 CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, the Court finds
that FedEx has failed to diligently prosecute this action pursuant to CCP §
583.130. Therefore, Defendant Hsueh’s motion to dismiss pursuant to CCP §
583.410 is GRANTED and the case is dismissed with prejudice.
Moving party is ordered to give notice.
