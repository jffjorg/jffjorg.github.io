And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge is inclined to award the incurred costs of $29,256.81 to the plaintiff's counsel instead of the capped amount of $40,000.00. This decision allows additional settlement money to go to the Labor and Workforce Development Agency (LWDA) and aggrieved employees. The judge also notes that a PAGA (Private Attorney General Act) action does not involve individual claims for Labor Code penalties, only civil penalties that the LWDA may assess. Therefore, a PAGA settlement should only preclude future PAGA enforcement and not employees' individual claims.
