BACKGROUND
 
This is a wage-and-hour
representative PAGA action.
 
In December 2023, the parties
participated in a mediation and reached a settlement.
 
Here, Plaintiff asks the Court to
approve the settlement.
 
LAW
 
PAGA permits an “aggrieved employee” to recover
Labor Code civil penalties on the Labor & Workforce Development Agency’s
(“LWDA”) behalf, if the LWDA declines to collect the penalties itself.  (Cal. Lab. Code, § 2699, subd. (a); see also Mejia
v. Merchants Building Maintenance, LLC (2019) 38 Cal.App.5th 723,
732-733.)  The California Supreme Court
has distinguished between Labor Code “civil penalties” that are “intended to
‘punish the employer’ for wrongdoing, often ‘without reference to the actual
damage sustained’” and “statutory damages” that “primarily seek to compensate
employees for actual losses incurred” – a PAGA action can recover only the
former.  (Z.B., N.A. v. Superior Court
(2019) 8 Cal.5th 175, 182, 198 [holding that Labor Code section 558 “amount
sufficient to recover unpaid wages” is not a “civil penalty” recoverable via
PAGA].) “A PAGA action is ‘fundamentally a law enforcement action designed to
protect the public and not to benefit private parties.’”  (Mejia, supra, 38 Cal.App.5th
at 732; see also Iskanian v. CLS Transportation Los Angeles, LLC (2014)
59 Cal.4th 348, 381.)
 
PAGA requires a court to “review and approve
any settlement of any civil action filed” under PAGA, but it does not provide
review and approval standards or guidelines. (Cal. Lab. Code, § 2699, subd. (l)(2).)  The California Supreme Court has interpreted PAGA
as requiring courts to ensure that “any negotiated [PAGA] resolution is fair
to those affected.”  (Williams v.
Superior Court (2017) 3 Cal.5th 531, 549, emphasis added).)  The parties affected by a PAGA settlement
include: (1) the LWDA, who receives 75% of settlement funds and is “bound by
the outcome of the proceeding to adjudicate the employee’s PAGA claim” (Mejia,
supra, 38 Cal.App.5th at 732); (2) the aggrieved employees, both party
and non-party, who receive 25% percent of settlement funds and are, like the
LWDA, bound by a PAGA action judgment; (3) plaintiffs’ counsel, who may be
awarded reasonable attorney fees and costs; and (4) defendant, who pays the
settlement.  
 
Moniz v. Adecco USA, Inc. (2021)
72 Cal.App.5th 56 provides greater detail about the standard courts
should apply when evaluating PAGA settlements. 
The opinion adopts the “fair, reasonable, and adequate” standard used in
class settlements.

Analysis
 
Plaintiff’s counsel’s declaration establishes
that, throughout the litigation, and in preparing for mediation, the parties
took part in informal discovery.  (See
Solouki Decl., ¶¶ 7-10.)  Plaintiff’s
counsel used the information to assess the value of the case and the associated
risks.  (See id. at ¶¶ 7-21.)  Ultimately, Plaintiff’s counsel came up with
maximum, minimum, and discounted estimates. 
(See id. at ¶¶ 22, 25.) 
Plaintiff’s counsel asserts that the gross settlement amount
($800,000.00) “is within a reasonable range, especially considering the
defenses Defendants raised” (ibid.; see also id. at ¶¶ 23-25) and that the
settlement is fair, reasonable, and adequate:
 
26. [] [T]he gross
PAGA Settlement is highly reasonable in light of the risks and uncertainties
associated with the PAGA claims in this case. The Settlement commits Defendants
to pay a sum large enough to punish Defendants for alleged violations and to deter
such alleged conduct in the future. At the same time, in light of the alleged
violations and defenses thereto, it is not so large as to be unjust, oppressive
or confiscatory. Based upon the foregoing, the proposed Settlement is fair,
reasonable, and in the best interest of the state of California and the
Aggrieved Employees 
 
27. Practically
speaking, if Plaintiff and other Aggrieved Employees continued litigating this
matter, Plaintiff and other Aggrieved Employees and the LWDA potentially could
have received nothing if the Court had agreed with Defendants’ position
especially in light of the volatility of this area of law, the aforementioned
defenses. The Settlement is reasonable in light of the risks involved in this
case – including the prospect of a potential adverse summary adjudication
ruling, defenses to the case, potential appeal, and potential costs which could
be forced on our client if Plaintiff and other aggrieved employees were not
successful. Counsel for Plaintiff and other Aggrieved Employees are convinced
that the proposed Settlement is fair based on the negotiations and a detailed
knowledge of the issues present in this action. The length and risks associated
with a motion for summary adjudication, trial, and other normal perils of
litigation have impacted the value of the claims and were all weighed in reaching
the proposed settlement. In light of the above, the proposed Settlement is well
within the range of reasonableness and should be granted approval. Plaintiff
believes that in providing employees with relief and obtaining penalties for
the LWDA, this Settlement furthers the purpose of PAGA to enforce compliance
with the Labor Code and should be approved. 
 
28. Counsel for

Settlement is fair based on the negotiations and a detailed knowledge of the
issues present in this action. The length and risks associated with a motion

impacted the value of the claims and were all weighed in reaching the proposed

Settlement furthers the purpose of PAGA to enforce compliance with the Labor
Code and should be approved.
 
(Id. at ¶¶ 26-28.)
 
The Court finds as follows.
 
Gross Settlement Amount
 
The gross settlement amount ($800,000.00) is
fair, reasonable, and adequate because the parties agreed to it via
arm’s-length mediation after investigation and discovery, it constitutes
approximately 13% of the maximum possible exposure, which is a reasonable
deduction given the risks and weaknesses, and it is hundreds of thousands of dollars
greater than Plaintiff’s counsel’s minimum estimate.  (See id. at ¶ 25.) 
 
Attorney Fees
 
The amount for attorney fees ($266,666.00)
is fair, reasonable, and adequate because Plaintiff’s counsel
represented Plaintiff on a contingency basis. 
(See Motion, p. 22.)  One-third of
the gross recovery is standard in contingency cases.
 
Attorney Costs
 
The amount for attorney costs (29,256.81)
is fair, reasonable, and adequate because, in addition to being modest in
general, it is less than 4% of the gross settlement amount.[1]
 
Administration Costs
 
The amount for administration costs
($15,000.00) is fair, reasonable, and adequate because it is unopposed and
within the range that this Court has approved in other complex cases. 
 
Incentive Award
 
Same analysis.  The amount for the incentive award
($5,000.00) is fair,
reasonable, and adequate because it is unopposed and within the Court’s
standard range.
 
Net Settlement Amount
 
The net settlement amount ($484,077.19) is
fair, reasonable, and adequate because it is approximately 61% of the gross
settlement amount.  The LWDA is entitled
to receive 75% ($363,057.89), and the aggrieved employees are entitled to
receive 25% ($121,019.30).  
 
Releases
 
The settlement agreement states:
 
5.1 Plaintiff
Herrera’s Release. Plaintiff Herrera and his respective former and present
spouses, representatives, agents, attorneys (including PAGA Counsel), heirs,
administrators, successors, and assigns generally, release and discharge
Released Parties from all claims, transactions, or occurrences that occurred
during the PAGA Period, including, but not limited to: (a) all claims that
were, or reasonably could have been, alleged, based on the facts contained in
the Herrera Complaint and the PAGA Notice (“Plaintiff Herrera’s Release”).
Plaintiff Herrera’s Release does not extend to any claims or actions to enforce
this Agreement, or to any claims for vested benefits, unemployment benefits,
disability benefits, social security benefits, workers’ compensation benefits
that arose at any time, or based on occurrences outside the PAGA Period.
Plaintiff Herrera acknowledges that Plaintiff Herrera may discover facts or law
different from, or in addition to, the facts or law that Plaintiff Herrera now
knows or believes to be true but agrees, nonetheless, that Plaintiff Herrera’s
Release shall be and remain effective in all respects, notwithstanding such
different or additional facts or Plaintiff Herrera’s discovery of them. 
 
5.2 Release by
Aggrieved Employees: 
 
All Aggrieved
Employees are deemed to release, on behalf of themselves and their respective
former and present representatives, agents, attorneys, heirs, administrators,
successors, and assigns, the Released Parties from the claims asserted under
the PAGA, as pled in the Herrera Complaint and the PAGA Notice, or that could
have been pled based on the factual allegations pled in the Herrera Complaint
and the PAGA Notice, on behalf of all current and former non-exempt employees,
who work or worked for Defendant at any time during the PAGA Period. 
 
5.3 Release by
PAGA Counsel: 
 
PAGA Counsel release
on behalf of their present and former attorneys, employees, agents, successors
and assigns the Released Parties from all claims for PAGA Fees incurred in
connection with the Herrera Complaint and the PAGA Period facts stated in the Herrera
Complaint and the PAGA Notice.
 
(Solouki Decl.,
Ex. 1, §§ 5.1-5.3, underlining in original.)
 
The Court is concerned about overbreadth.  Do the parties have standing to release
claims on behalf of heirs, etc.?  At
the hearing, counsel needs to address the scope of the releases.[2]
