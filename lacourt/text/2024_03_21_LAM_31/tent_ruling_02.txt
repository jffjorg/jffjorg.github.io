RESPONDING PARTY:     Plaintiff Baha
Tan Toksoz
 
 
I.          FACTUAL AND
PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND 
 
This is a breach of contract case.  According to the complaint, Plaintiff, Baha
Tan Toksoz, reached out to Chris Furie (“Furie”), a real estate broker, for
assistance in purchasing a property located at 943 N. Laurel Avenue in Los
Angeles, California.  Instead of
assisting Plaintiff with the purchase of 943 N. Laurel Avenue, Furie proposed
the purchase of 944 N. Laurel Avenue in Los Angeles, California (“Subject
Property”).  Furie represented that he
and his company, 944 Laurel, LLC (“944 Laurel”), were in the process of
purchasing the property from its owner, Alex Goodson (“Goodson”).  On November 5, 2019, Plaintiff eventually
entered into an oral lease agreement with Furie for the Subject Property.  The oral agreement had an option to
purchase.  
 
Pursuant to the agreement, Furie directed Plaintiff to
deposit $118,500 into escrow.  The escrow
deposit would be used by Defendants to purchase the Subject Property from
Goodson.  Furie assured Plaintiff that
those funds would be returned if escrow did not close.  Plaintiff was also directed to obtain
insurance for the property and to provide proof of same to the escrow.  However, in May of 2020, Furie notified
Plaintiff that escrow had terminated and that Plaintiff’s deposit of $118,500
was forfeited as liquidated damages.  Plaintiff did not know there was a liquidated
damages clause, let alone agree to said clause, nor was he given notice that the
escrow funds were in jeopardy.  Plaintiff
was further unaware that Furie and 944 Laurel were the previous owners of the
Subject Property, that they had sold it to Goodson, that Goodson had filed a
notice of recission for the Subject Property on April 1, 2018, and that Goodson
initiated litigation against Furie and 944 N. Laurel over misrepresentations
concerning the Subject Property.  That
litigation, filed on October 24, 2019 in Los Angeles Superior Court, Case No.
19STCV38262, was ongoing for nearly the entire duration of Plaintiff’s dealings
with Furie.  Plaintiff alleges that Furie
never intended to sell the Subject Property to Plaintiff and used Plaintiff’s deposit
of $118,500 to extract themselves out of the lawsuit with Goodson.
 
On April 30, 2021, Plaintiff filed a Complaint against
Defendants, Furie and 944 Laurel, LLC. 
On August 30, 2021, Plaintiff filed the First Amended Complaint (FAC)
alleging causes of action for (1) Breach of Contract, (2) Breach of Covenant of
Good Faith and Fair Dealing, (3) Breach of Fiduciary Duty, (4) Violation of
Bus. & Prof. Code § 17200, (5) Fraud, (6) Misrepresentation, (7)
Negligence, (8) Conversion, and (9) Violation of Penal Code § 496. 
 
On December 1, 2023, the court granted, in relevant part, Defendants’
motion for judgment on the pleadings to the Third Cause of Action for Breach of
Fiduciary Duty in the FAC with leave to amend.
 
On December 15, 2023, Plaintiff timely filed the Second
Amended Complaint (SAC).  The SAC now
asserts the Third Cause of Action for Breach of Fiduciary Duty against Furie
only.
 
On January 16, 2024, Defendants filed this demurrer to the
Third Cause of Action for Breach of Fiduciary Duty in the SAC. 
 
Plaintiff filed an opposition. Defendants replied. 
 
II.        LEGAL STANDARD FOR DEMURRER
 
A demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of the pleadings and
will be sustained only where the pleading is defective on its face.  (City
of Atascadero v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc. (1998) 68
Cal.App.4th 445, 459.)  “We treat the demurrer as admitting all material
facts properly pleaded but not contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact
or law.  We accept the factual allegations of the complaint as true and also consider
matters which may be judicially noticed.  [Citation.]”  (Mitchell
v. California Department of Public Health (2016) 1 Cal.App.5th 1000, 1007; Del
E. Webb Corp. v. Structural Materials Co. (1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 593, 604
[“the facts alleged in the pleading are deemed to be true, however improbable
they may be”].)  Allegations are to be liberally construed.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 452.)  In construing the allegations, the court is to give
effect to specific factual allegations that may modify or limit inconsistent
general or conclusory allegations.  (Financial Corporation of America
v. Wilburn (1987) 189 Cal.App.3rd 764, 769.)   
 
A demurrer may be brought if insufficient facts are stated
to support the cause of action asserted. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd.
(e).) “A demurrer for uncertainty is strictly construed, even where a
complaint is in some respects uncertain, because ambiguities can be clarified
under modern discovery procedures.” (Khoury v. Maly’s of California,
Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.)   


Where the complaint contains substantial factual
allegations sufficiently apprising defendant of the issues it is being asked to
meet, a demurrer for uncertainty will be overruled or plaintiff will be given
leave to amend.  (Williams v. Beechnut Nutrition Corp. (1986) 185
Cal.App.3d 135, 139, fn. 2.)  Leave to amend must be allowed where there
is a reasonable possibility of successful amendment.  (Goodman v.
Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.)  The burden is on the complainant
to show the Court that a pleading can be amended successfully.  (Ibid.)  
 
III.       DISCUSSION 
 
            “The
elements of a cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty are the existence of
a
fiduciary relationship, its breach, and damage proximately
caused by that breach.”  (Knox v. Dean
(2012) 205 Cal.App.4th 417, 432-33.)  No fraudulent
intent is required.  (See Civ. Code, §
1573 (defining “constructive fraud”).)  
 
            Defendants
argue the SAC still does not adequately allege the existence of a fiduciary
relationship between Furie and Plaintiff. 
A review of the SAC demonstrates otherwise.  The SAC adds the allegation that after Furie
informed Plaintiff that he didn’t qualify for 943 N. Laurel Ave., Furie
suggested Plaintiff consider purchasing the Subject Property: “At this point
since Defendant Furie was no longer seeking to obtain a loan for Plaintiff who
was very interested in obtaining the other property located at 944 N. Laurel,
Plaintiff informed Defendant Furie he had a friend who is a licensed real
estate agent and could assist Plaintiff with the transaction. Furie informed
Plaintiff getting his friend involved was not necessary since Defendant Furie
himself was also a licensed Real Estate Broker. By taking this action,
Defendant Furie transitioned from his role as a mortgage broker to that of real
estate broker Plaintiff.”  (SAC, ¶¶ 20,
72.)  As alleged, the reasonable
inference to be drawn is that Furie was acting as the seller and real
estate broker for the purchase of the Subject Property by dispelling
Plaintiff’s need to engage his friend to serve as a real estate agent.  This allegation overcomes Defendants’ argument
that the allegations merely portray Defendants as the seller, and Plaintiff as
the buyer, of the Subject Property.  This
inference is further buttressed by the allegations showing the course of
dealings between Furie and Plaintiff.  Prior
to the transaction involving the Subject Property, Plaintiff used Furie in his
capacity as a real estate professional in 2016. 
(SAC, ¶ 17.)  The relationship
between Plaintiff and Furie is professional in nature.  Plaintiff adequately alleges that Furie was
acting as Plaintiff’s real estate broker in connection to the purchase of the
Subject Property.  Furie therefore had a
fiduciary duty to disclose the pending litigation between Furie and Goodson regarding
the Subject Property.            
 
V.        CONCLUSION         
            Accordingly,
the demurrer to the Third Cause of Action is OVERRULED. 
            Defendants
are ordered to serve and file their Answer to the Second Amended Complaint
within 20 days.
            Plaintiff
to give notice.
