I.          FACTUAL AND
PROCEDRUAL BACKGROUND
 
            This is a wrongful
death case.  On December 18, 2021, Darrell
Caldwell (AKA Drakeo the Ruler) (“Mr. Caldwell” or “Decedent”) was stabbed backstage
at the “Once Upon A Time in LA” music festival (“Music Festival”).  Mr. Caldwell was 28 years old, and a hip hop
recording artist.  He was stabbed and
killed moments before going on stage.  
 
            In the First Amended Complaint, Plaintiff
Caiden Caldwell (Decedent’s son) as the Successor-in-Interest to the Estate of
Darrell Caldwell, by and through his guardian ad litem Tianna Purtue alleges: “Mr.
Caldwell’s lynching and eventual death at the hand of a violent mob of
purported members of a Los Angeles based Bloods gang, while Mr. Caldwell made
his way through the backstage area of the Banc of California performers stage,
where he was scheduled to perform just minutes following the violent attack,
was a result of a complete and abject failure of all Defendants to implement proper
safety measures in order to ensure the safety and well being of the artists
whom they invited and hired to their music festival.”  (FAC ¶ 2.)  Plaintiffs sued Defendant University of
Southern California (“USC”), along with numerous security
companies, for failing to keep the backstage area secure and safe. 
 
            On or about February 2, 2022, Plaintiff
filed the instant action, and filed a First Amended Complaint on or about August
7, 2023, alleging causes of action for (1) Negligence-Wrongful Death; (2) Wrongful
Death-Premises Liability; and (3) Negligent Hiring/Retention/Supervision
Training-Wrongful Death against all defendants. 

 
            On January 30,
2024, USC filed a motion to strike punitive damages allegations and the request
for medical expenses from the FAC. 
 
             On February 26, 2024, USC also filed a motion
to continue the discovery deadlines to the current trial date of March 10, 2025.
 
            Both
motions are unopposed.   
 
II.        MOTION TO STRIKE
 
a.      
Legal
Standard 
 
Any party, within
the time allowed to respond to a pleading, may serve and file a motion to
strike the whole pleading or any part thereof.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 435, subd.
(b)(1); Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1322, subd. (b).)¿ On a motion to strike,
the court may: (1) strike out any irrelevant, false, or improper matter
inserted in any pleading; or (2) strike out all or any part of any pleading not
drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of California, a court rule, or an
order of the court.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 436, subds. (a)-(b); Stafford v.
Shultz (1954) 42 Cal.2d 767, 782.)¿¿ 
 
“The grounds for a
motion to strike are limited to matters appearing on the face of the challenged
pleading or matters which must or may be judicially noticed. (§ 437, subd. (a);
Evid. Code, §§ 451, 452.).” (Garcia v. Sterling (1985) 176 Cal.App.3d
17, 20.)¿ 
 
b.     
Application
 
Judicial Notice
 
USC requests
judicial notice of the First Amended Complaint in the related action, Darrylene
Corniel v. Live Nation Worldwide, Inc., et al., LASC Case No.
22STCV07737, which demonstrate that Darrylene Corniel is the personal
representative of the Estate of Darrell Caldwell.  (Request for Judicial Notice (RJN), 1.) 
 
The unopposed
request is GRANTED.  (Evid. Code, § 452,
subd. (d).) 
 
Meet and Confer¿¿ 
¿ 
Defense counsel
has satisfied this the meet and confer requirement.¿(Declaration of Janine F.
Cohen, ¶¶ 5-16.)
 
Analysis
 
USC seeks an order
striking punitive damages allegations from the FAC because punitive damages are
not permitted under the wrongful death statute. 
The court agrees.  “The California
statutes and decisions . . . have been interpreted to bar the recovery of
punitive damages in a wrongful death action.”  (Tarasoff v. Regents of the University of
California (1976) 17 Cal.3d 425, 450; see also Pease v. Beech Aircraft
Corp. (1974) 38 Cal.App.3d 450, 460-462. “The damages recoverable in
[wrongful death] are expressly limited to those not recoverable in a survival
action under Code of Civil Procedure section 377.34.”  (Quiroz v. Seventh Ave. Center (2006) 140
Cal.App.4th 1256, 1264); see also Code Civ. Proc., § 377.61 (“In an action
under this article, damages may be awarded that, under all the circumstances of
the case, may be just, but may not include damages recoverable under Section
377.34.”). Code of Civil Procedure section 377.34 provides for the recovery of
“any penalties or punitive or exemplary damages that the decedent would have
been entitled to recover had the decedent lived.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 377.34, subd. (a).)  Thus, an heir suing for wrongful death cannot
recover punitive damages under California law.  (Ford Motor Co. v. Superior Court (1981)
120 Cal.App.3d 748, 751.)  This is true
even where the decedent’s death was caused by the defendant’s reckless and
wanton misconduct.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§
377.34, 377.61; Doak v. Superior Court for Los Angeles County (1968) 257
Cal.App.2d 825, 834-36.)   Here,
Plaintiff has brought a wrongful death action.  
Punitive damages are not recoverable. 
Accordingly, USC is entitled to an order striking the request for
punitive damages and all allegations supporting the request from the FAC.
 
USC also requests
an order striking the claim for medical expenses because such damages were
suffered by the Decedent, not by Plaintiff. 
As such, a claim for medical expenses belongs to the estate and must be
brought in a survival action on behalf of the estate.  The court agrees.  “[U]nder California’s survival law, an estate
can recover . . . the deceased plaintiff’s lost wages, medical expenses, and
any other pecuniary losses incurred before death.”  (Williams v. The Pep Boys Manny Moe &
Jack of California (2018) 27 Cal. App. 5th 225, 236, quoting County of
Los Angeles v. Superior Court (1999) 21 Cal. 4th 292, 304; Code Civ. Proc.,
§§ 377.30, 377.34.)  Damages recoverable
in a survival action are not recoverable in a wrongful death action.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 377.61.)
 
 Here, the FAC does not allege a survival cause
of action.  (See generally, FAC.)  And even if Plaintiff had alleged a survival
cause of action, he lacks standing to seek such damages on behalf of the
estate.  A cause of action which
“survives the death of the person entitled to commence an action or proceeding
. . . may be commenced by the decedent’s personal representative or, if none,
by the decedent’s successor in interest.”  (Code Civ. Proc. § 377.30.)  Here, Decedent’s mother, Darrylene Corniel is
the personal representative of Decedent’s estate.  (RJN 1, ¶ 20, Exs. A and B.)  Accordingly, USC is entitled to an order
striking the request for medical expenses from the FAC.
 
c.      
Conclusion
 
The unopposed
motion to strike is GRANTED.  Paragraphs
82 and 83 of the FAC and Paragraph 3 of the Prayer of the FAC is stricken.  
 
Leave to amend is
DENIED.
 
Defendant USC to
give notice.
 
III.      CONTINUE DISCOVERY DEADLINES
 
a.      
Legal
Standard 
 
Except as
otherwise provided, any party shall be entitled as a matter of right to
complete discovery proceedings on or before the 30th day, and to have motions
concerning discovery heard on or before the 15th day, before the date initially
set for trial of the action.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 2024.020, subd. (a).)¿ On
motion of any party, the court may grant leave to complete discovery
proceedings, or to have a motion concerning discovery heard, closer to the
initial trial date, or to reopen discovery after a new trial date has been
set.¿ This motion shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration
demonstrating a good faith effort at informal resolution.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., §
2024.050, subd. (a).)¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
 
The court shall
take into consideration any matter relevant to the leave requested, including,
but not limited to: (1) the necessity and the reasons for the discovery, (2)
the diligence or lack of diligence of the party seeking the discovery or the
hearing of a discovery motion, and the reasons that the discovery was not
completed or that the discovery motion was not heard earlier, (3) any
likelihood that permitting the discovery or hearing the discovery motion will
prevent the case from going to trial on the date set, or otherwise interfere
with the trial calendar, or result in prejudice to any other party, and (4) the
length of time that has elapsed between any date previously set, and the date
presently set, for the trial of the action.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 2024.050,
subd. (b).)
 
b.     
Application

 
On February 15,
2024, the court granted USC’s ex parte application to continue the trial
date.  Pursuant to USC’s request, the
jury trial scheduled for May 20, 2024 was continued to March 10, 2025.  However, because a court cannot continue
related discovery dates to the new trial date by ex parte motion, USC was
directed to file a noticed motion. 
Accordingly, the only issue to be decided is whether discovery dates
should also be continued to the new trial date. 

 
USC argues the
discovery deadlines should be continued because USC has only recently been
added as a defendant in this action and has therefore not been able to complete
discovery.  The court agrees.  USC is entitled to defend against Plaintiff’s
claims.  Given that lack of opposition to
this motion, no prejudice will result from continuing the discovery deadlines.
 
a.      
Conclusion
 
The unopposed
motion to continue discovery deadlines is GRANTED.  All discovery deadlines, including expert
discovery, are continued to the current trial date of March 10, 2025.
 
Defendant USC to
give notice.
 
IV.       DISPOSITIONS
 
            The
unopposed motion to strike is granted. 
Paragraphs 82 and 83 of the FAC and Paragraph 3 of the Prayer of the FAC
is stricken.  Leave to amend is denied.    
 
The unopposed motion to continue discovery deadlines is granted.  All discovery deadlines, including expert
discovery, are continued to the current trial date of March 10, 2025.
 
            Defendant
USC to give notice.
