And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has ruled on a demurrer filed by the defendants in a breach of contract case. The plaintiff, Baha Tan Toksoz, alleges that the defendants, Chris Furie and 944 Laurel, LLC, breached their fiduciary duty to him in connection with the purchase of a property. The judge has overruled the demurrer, finding that the plaintiff has adequately alleged a fiduciary relationship between Furie and Toksoz, and that Furie had a duty to disclose pending litigation between Furie and the property's owner, Alex Goodson. The judge has ordered the defendants to file their answer to the plaintiff's second amended complaint within 20 days.
