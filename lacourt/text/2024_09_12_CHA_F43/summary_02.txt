And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a personal injury case between Plaintiff Angelique Burrough and Defendant Costco Wholesale Corporation. The Plaintiff is seeking further responses to discovery requests that were propounded on September 1, 2023, but did not receive responses until June 5, 2024. The Defendant argues that the Plaintiff's meet and confer email lumped all the answers to the 55 discovery requests together and did not identify the specific issues with each answer.

The judge has ordered the parties to conduct a meaningful meet and confer, directly and not via email or letter. The parties are also ordered to file a joint statement of the remaining issues, which should briefly describe the matters in dispute, followed by the Plaintiff's arguments and then the Defendant's arguments. The judge will not decide the motion on the merits at this time due to the insufficiency of the meet and confer process.
