And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the motion for entry of judgment filed by Plaintiff Laysion, LLC. The motion is based on a settlement agreement made between the parties on March 6, 2024, which has not been complied with by Defendants Guillermo Macias and Colt International Clothing, Inc. Despite the fact that Defendants have paid only about one-third of the agreed-to sum of $350,000, Plaintiff is seeking to enforce the settlement agreement and obtain judgment. The judge has determined that the parties did enter into a valid and binding settlement agreement and that Plaintiff has made a prima facie showing of its entitlement to entry of judgment. The judge has ordered judgment to be entered in the amount of $210,000, plus interest and attorney fees and costs.
