Moving
Party to give notice. 
 
This action
for breach of contract was filed by Plaintiff MALEK & MALEK (“Plaintiff”)
against Defendants EDRIS PLASTICS, MFG., INC. (“Edris Plastics”); ERVIN
ISSAGHOLIAN (“Issagholian”) and Does 1 to 10 on
November 30, 2023. 
 
Plaintiff
moves for Orders deeming Requests for Admission (sets one) admitted as to
Defendants Edris Plastics and Issagholian. 
 
“If
a party to whom requests for admission are directed fails to serve a timely
response, the following rules apply: (a) The party to whom the requests for
admission are directed waives any objection to the requests…. The Court, on
motion, may relieve that party from this waiver on its determination that both
of the following conditions are satisfied: (1) The party has subsequently
served a response that is in substantial compliance with Sections 2033.210,
2033.220, and 2033.230. (2) the party’s failure to serve a timely response was
the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect…. (c) The court shall
make this order, unless it finds that the party to whom the requests for
admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a
proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial
compliance with Section 2033.220. It is mandatory that the court impose a
monetary sanction under Chapter 7…on the party or attorney, or both, whose
failure to serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated this
motion.” (CCP §2033.280.)  Unverified
responses “are tantamount to no responses at all.” (Appleton v. Superior
Court (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 632, 636.) No prior attempt to resolve the
matter informally is required.

RFAs were propounded on or about March 11, 2024 by email. 
 
In
Oppositions to the Subject Motions, Defendants indicates that untimely
responses were served on December 6, 2024. (See Prince Decl., ¶2, Ex. 1.)

untimely responses in “substantial compliance” with the Code were ultimately
served prior to this hearing, the Motions are DENIED as MOOT.
