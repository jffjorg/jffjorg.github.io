```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the City of Huntington Park's motion for the appointment of a receiver to address the public nuisance and imminent hazard posed by the Subject Property. The Property, located on East Florence Avenue, has been in a dilapidated state with numerous property maintenance and building code violations since October 2023. Despite notices and efforts by the City, the Defendants have failed to abate the conditions. The Bank of Hope, which has a U.S. Small Business Administration loan secured by the Property, has joined in the City's motion. The judge finds that the appointment of a receiver is necessary to bring the Property into compliance with city codes in a timely and cost-effective manner.
