And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The plaintiff, MALEK & MALEK, has filed a lawsuit against defendants EDRIS PLASTICS MFG., INC. and ERVIN ISSAGHOLIAN for breach of contract. The plaintiff has moved for orders deeming requests for admission (RFAs) admitted against the defendants. However, the defendants served untimely responses to the RFAs, and the plaintiff has moved to deem these responses as waived. The court has found that the defendants did serve responses subsequent to the hearing, which were in substantial compliance with the relevant code sections. Therefore, the motions are denied as moot.

The court has also awarded reasonable sanctions against the defendants under CCP §2033.280(c) for their failure to serve timely responses to the RFAs. The sanctions are mandatory and are awarded in the amount of $1,000.00 each to the defendants and their counsel.
