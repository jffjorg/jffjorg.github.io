#4
 
Petitioner MICHELLE CHAVEZs Unopposed Petition to Confirm Arbitration
Award is GRANTED. 
 
Moving Party to give notice. 
 
No Opposition filed as of December 16, 2024. 
 
Petitioner MICHELLE CHAVEZ (“Petitioner”) filed a Petition
to Confirm Contractual Arbitration Award on August 19, 2024. 
 
The petition has: (i) set forth the substance of the
agreement to arbitrate; (ii) set forth the name of the arbitrator; (iii)
attached a copy of the award and the written opinion of the arbitrator; and
(iv) is brought within four years after date of service of copy of award on
petitioner. (See CCP §1285.) The Petitioner meets all the requirements of the
statue. 
 
In Opposition, Plaintiffs argue that the Petition should be
denied because the Arbitrator exceeded his power by requiring that Plaintiff
Home Designers and Contractors, Inc. (“HDCI”) retain an attorney and then
refusing to postpone the arbitration hearing to give HDCI sufficient time to
comply with this requirement. 
 
The Unopposed Petition is GRANTED. Judgment shall be entered
in conformity therewith. (CCP §1287.4.)
