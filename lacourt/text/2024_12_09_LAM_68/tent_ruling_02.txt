REQUESTED
Motion
to Compel Responses to Form Interrogatories (set one)
 
SUMMARY
OF ACTION
Plaintiff Altman Apartments, LLC (Altman) manages certain
residential properties in Los Angeles. Plaintiff alleges an agreement with Defendant
People Assisting the Homeless (PATH) for the placement of qualified
individuals and families into Altman managed units in exchange for certain
negotiated rates. Plaintiff alleges payments stopped for certain tenants,
thereby leaving an outstanding balance of $335,323.44.
 
On January 29, 2024, Plaintiff filed a complaint for 1. Breach
Of Contracts; 2. Breach of Contract; 3. Common Count: Account Stated; 4. Common
Count: Open Book Account; 5. Common Count: Account Stated; 6. Common Count:
Open Book Account; and 7. Negligence. On March 11, 2024, PATH answered the
complaint, and filed a cross-complaint against Altman for Indemnification,
Apportionment of Fault, and Declaratory Relief. Altman answered the
cross-complaint on March 13, 2024.
 
RULING: Granted.
Plaintiff
Altman Apartments, LLC (Altman) moves to compel responses to Form
Interrogatories (set one) served on Defendant People Assisting the Homeless
(PATH). Plaintiff served Form Interrogatories (set one) on April 5, 2024.
[Declaration of Thomas Vincent, ¶ 2, Ex. A.] At the time of the filing of the
motion, no responses were received. [Id., ¶ 5.] Defendant in opposition represents
that former handling counsel left the firm on short notice, thereby requiring
reassignment of the cases. [Declaration of Serena Nervez, ¶ 3.] Upon
discovering the motion and missing discovery responses counsel proceeded to
prepare responses and represents service of responses by the time of the
hearing date. [Id., ¶ 6.] On reply, Plaintiff indicates that it has not
received any responses to the subject discovery. [Reply at p. 2:21-26.] 
 
Because
the opposition lacks proof of service of any responses, and only presents a
representation of responses to be served by the time of the hearing, the court
must grant the motion. Barring a showing of service of responses or
acknowledgment by Plaintiff at the time of the hearing, Defendant PATH is
ordered to serve verified responses to form interrogatories, without objections
within ten days. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a-b).) 
 
If
responses are determined served at the time of the motion, the court will
declare the motion moot. The court will not consider the quality of any
responses under this situation. (See Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific
Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 408–409.)
Plaintiff may bring a motion to compel further responses, if deemed necessary.
 
The
court appreciates the circumstances, but generally adheres to a policy of
sanctions when a valid motion only leads to responses after the filing of the
motion. Sanctions in the amount of $250, whether responses are served or not.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (c).) Sanctions are imposed joint and
severally against both counsel and PATH in the amount of $250 and payable
within 30 days of this order.
 
Second motions to compel discovery on December 10, 2024. Trial
set for April 14, 2025.
 
Plaintiff
to give notice.
