And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge rules in favor of the plaintiff, Altman Apartments, LLC, and grants its motion to compel responses to form interrogatories served on the defendant, People Assisting the Homeless (PATH). The defendant had failed to respond to the interrogatories, citing the departure of its handling counsel, but the court finds that the opposition lacks proof of service of any responses. The court orders the defendant to serve verified responses to the form interrogatories, without objections, within 10 days. If the responses are determined to have been served at the time of the motion, the court will declare the motion moot. The court also imposes sanctions of $250, payable within 30 days, jointly and severally against both counsel and PATH.
