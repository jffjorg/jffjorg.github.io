And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrers filed by Rajesh Thakkar and Nidhi Mittal to the First Amended Cross-Complaint (FACC) filed by Humble Retailers, Inc. and Satish Mahajan. The Court has SUSTAINED the demurrers with leave to amend.

The FACC alleges that Humble Retailers and Satish Mahajan have breached their contract with Thakkar and Mittal by failing to disclose material risks and by refusing to return the down payment. The Court finds that the FACC fails to plead sufficient facts to state a claim for breach of contract, conversion, specific performance, and declaratory relief.

The Court has SUSTAINED the demurrers to the FACC, finding that the FACC fails to plead sufficient facts to state a claim for breach of contract, conversion, specific performance, and declaratory relief. The Court has granted leave to amend the FACC, giving the parties 20 days to file an amended complaint.

The Court's ruling is based on its analysis of the legal standards governing demurrers, including the requirements for pleadings to state a cause of action and the need for pleadings to be supported by facts. The Court has carefully considered the parties' arguments and has ruled accordingly.
