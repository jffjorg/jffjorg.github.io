And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court denies Petitioner's motion for an award of attorneys' fees and costs under Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5. Petitioner argues that it was a successful party in this litigation because it delayed the enforcement of LAUSD's resolution requiring all students to obtain a COVID-19 vaccine, which ultimately led to the resolution being voided by the court in a related case. However, the court finds that Petitioner did not meet its burden of demonstrating a causal connection between its lawsuit and any changes made by LAUSD. The court notes that LAUSD's decision to delay enforcement of the resolution was likely due to its own decision-making process, rather than any influence from Petitioner's lawsuit. Therefore, the court finds that Petitioner was not a successful party in this litigation and is not entitled to an award of attorneys' fees and costs.
