  - "The entire controversy here turns on the meaning of 'reorganization' as the term is used in the last sentence of Article 16."
```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the petition and the opposition and is inclined to agree with the County's position. The dispute centers on the meaning of the word "reorganization" in Article 16 of the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the County and the Los Angeles County Professional Peace Officers Association. The court finds that the word "reorganization" is not limited to internal restructuring, but rather refers to the transfer, restructuring, and termination of work performed by represented employees, including the transfer of functions to private entities.

The court concludes that the waiver sentence in Article 16 modifies the preceding paragraphs and collectively refers to all actions the County may take and is obligated to take "in the event of transfer of functions." The court finds that the parties intended to waive their right to negotiate over the decision of any reorganization by the County during the life of the agreement.

Based on the foregoing, the petition is GRANTED/DENIED.
