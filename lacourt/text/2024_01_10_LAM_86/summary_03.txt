And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion filed by Petitioner, who is seeking attorneys' fees based on the results of a separate proceeding. The Judge notes that Petitioner's new allegations address independent study, face coverings, and violations of state education laws, but that Petitioner did not prevail in the original lawsuit. The Judge also finds that Petitioner's claim to attorneys' fees is based on a mischaracterization of the facts, as Petitioner did not obtain a single order requiring Respondent to take or refrain from taking some action. The Judge concludes that while the chronology of events may suggest a causal relationship between the events, the Judge needs more information to determine whether Petitioner is entitled to attorneys' fees.
