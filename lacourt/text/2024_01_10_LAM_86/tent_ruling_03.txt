[1] All
Respondents have opposed the motion. For ease, however, the court refers to a
single Respondent.


[2] After
the court enjoined Respondent from enforcing the Resolution in G.F. v. Los
Angeles Unified School District, Petitioner asserted allegations against
Respondent not specifically targeting the Resolution. Petitioner’s new allegations
addressed independent study, face coverings, violation of state education laws
and discrimination.


[3] Petitioner
cites no authority for the proposition it is entitled to an award of attorneys’
fees based on the results obtained in a separate (albeit related) proceeding.
To the extent Petitioner purports to rely on Grodensky v. Artichoke Joe’s
Casino (2009) 171 Cal.App.4th 1399, 1437, the Supreme Court granted review
of the decision and the citation is no longer valid. To the extent Petitioner relies
upon Graham v. DaimlerChrysler Corp., supra, 34 Cal.4th at 570 n.
4, the notion of “ultimately prevailing when the matter is set at rest” would
suggest a party could prevail under a catalyst theory—that is, “by means other
than a judgment or verdict.” (Ibid.)


[4] That
Petitioner claims “Petitioner is a successful party because it has prevailed on
the main issue of the initial lawsuit: to prevent enforcement of and to strike
down Respondents’ illegal [Resolution]” is a mischaracterization. (Memo
8:9-10.) Petitioner did not prevail in this litigation. Petitioner did not
obtain a single order requiring Respondent to take or refrain from taking some
action.


[5] “Because it
can be difficult to prove causation when a plaintiff seeks to recover under [a
catalyst] theory and ‘action is taken by the defendant after plaintiff's
lawsuit is filed,’ the chronology of events can give rise the inference that
the two events are causally related.” (MacDonald v. Ford Motor Company
(N.D. Cal. 2015) 142 F.Supp.3d 884, 891.)
