And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling on the applications for writs of attachment filed by San Marcos Pharmacy, Inc. (SMP) and Guadalupe Pharmacy, Inc. (GP) against Santa Maria Pharmacy, Inc. and Marcos Soliman. The applications seek to attach the property of the defendants in the amounts of $1,482,330, $643,251.50, and $1,123,523, respectively.

The court finds that the plaintiffs have demonstrated the probable validity of their claims against the defendants. SMP claims that it lent $1,450,000 to Santa Maria Pharmacy, Inc. and that the defendant failed to make payments. GP claims that it sold goods to Soliman and did not receive payment. Soliman is the sole shareholder and CEO of Santa Maria Pharmacy, Inc.

The court also finds that the attachments are proper under the Code of Civil Procedure sections 484.090 and 483.010. The court grants the applications for writs of attachment, but requires the plaintiffs to file undertakings in the amounts of $10,000 to secure the attachments.
