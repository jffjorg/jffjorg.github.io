English summary:
The case number is 23STCV07274 and the hearing date is September 27, 2023 in department 49. The plaintiffs are Brittany A Jackson and Sylvia Sheridan. The defendants are Hawkins Real Property Management, LLC and Todd Hawkins. Plaintiff Brittany Jackson alleges she moved into the property at 1426 W 25th Street in Los Angeles, CA, to care for her ailing grandmother, Katie Mae Hawkins. After Katie Mae Hawkins passed away, Plaintiff Sylvia Sheridan became the successor in interest. Plaintiff Jackson continued to pay rent after her grandmother's death. However, on December 1, 2022, Defendants allegedly changed the locks on the unit and removed Plaintiff’s belongings. Plaintiffs now bring causes of action for wrongful eviction, tenant harassment, nuisance, breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, intentional infliction of emotional distress, conversion, trespass to chattels, breach of implied in fact contract, breach of duty of good faith, unjust enrichment, and unfair business practices. Defendants demurrer to each cause of action in the Complaint, arguing that each is uncertain or fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. The court sustains the demurrer with 30 days leave to amend. The court also overrules Defendants’ demurrer to Plaintiffs’ request for punitive damages. If there is a stipulation, the recently filed First Amended Complaint will constitute the current amended complaint in this matter. Otherwise, Plaintiff must file and serve a standalone FAC consistent with this ruling.
