  - "The reallocation of community royalties indirectly resolves the issue of this Interpleader action, i.e., Baker's 50% share of the community royalties through BMI are payable to Marlo, including those currently being held and on deposit with the Court."
  - "The Court does not see any demarcation between royalties earned before and after the date of Judgment. As such, the Court sees no basis for limiting the effect of the Family Law Judgment, and interprets it to apply from the date of separation."

Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Clara Veseliza Baker aka Clair Marlo's motion for summary judgment in this interpleader action. The dispute arose from the distribution of community music royalties between Marlo and her ex-husband, Alexander Collin Baker. The Family Court Judgment, made on November 7, 2022, reallocated Baker's right to receive payment to Marlo, and ordered that royalty paying organizations, including BMI, pay all royalties to Marlo. The judge has determined that the Family Court Judgment applies from the date of separation, and that Marlo is entitled to receive the community music royalties, including those currently being held and on deposit with the Court. The judge has also rejected Baker's argument that the Judgment only applies from the date of entry, and that royalties earned before that date should be paid to Adam Bravery, LLC.
