  No.:  22STCV23508 
 
 
 
 Hearing Date: September 24, 2024



 
Defendant’s
motion for an order regarding contempt is GRANTED. 
 
On 7/20/2022,
Plaintiffs Ghazar Shabazyan and Gold Point Towing, Inc. (collectively,
Plaintiffs) filed suit against Berkshire Hathaway Homestate Insurance Company,
Redwood Fire and Casualty Insurance Company (Redwood), and Coverhound LLC dba
Coverhound Insurance Solutions, alleging: (1) breach of contract; (2) breach of
duty of good faith and fair dealing; (3) insurance broker negligence. 
 
            On 8/5/2024, Defendant Redwood Fire and Casualty
Insurance Company (Redwood) moves for an order holding plaintiff Gold Point
Towing, Inc., and Plaintiff’s counsel, Gregory Byberg, in contempt.
 
            The motion is unopposed. 
 
Discussion
 
            Defendant seeks: (1) an order holding plaintiff Gold
Point Towing, Inc., and plaintiff’s counsel, Gregory Byberg, in contempt
pursuant to Civil Code of Procedure section 1209(a)(5) for their willful
disregard and continuous disobedience of this Court’s orders entered on
November 20, 2023, and December 15, 2023; (2) an order compelling payment of
(a) monetary sanctions previously awarded against Gold Point and Mr. Byberg for
$2,800.00, and (b) payment of the costs owed to Redwood as a prevailing party
for $2,216.42; and (3) an order compelling Gold Point and its counsel to pay
attorneys’ fees associated with filing this motion for $1,645.00.
 
This
Court granted Redwood’s motion for terminating sanctions on March 27, 2024,
dismissing Plaintiff’s case against Redwood with prejudice. The dismissal was
entered based on Plaintiff’s failure to comply with the Court’s orders and
failure to prosecute its case against Redwood.
 
At
the time of the dismissal, there were pending unpaid monetary sanctions awarded
in favor of Redwood and against Plaintiff and its counsel, jointly and
severally, of $2,800. These monetary sanctions were previously entered by this
Court pursuant to orders dated November 20, 2023, and December 15, 2023, for
Gold Point’s and its counsel’s failure to comply with their discovery
obligations. After the dismissal, Redwood served and filed a memorandum of
costs seeking $2,216.42. That memorandum was unopposed. The monetary sanctions
and the costs owed to Redwood have not been paid.
 
A
willful failure to comply with a court order constitutes contempt. (Hassell
v. Bird (2018) 5 Cal.5th 522, 547; Koshak v. Malek (2011) 200
Cal.App.4th 1540, 1548.) The elements of proof necessary to support punishment
for contempt are (1) a valid order, (2) the alleged contemner's knowledge of
the order, and (3) noncompliance. (Inland Counties Reg’l Ctr., Inc. v. Superior
Court (2017) 10 Cal.App.5th 820, 827; Van v. LanguageLine Solutions
(2017) 8 Cal.App.5th 73, 81.) A person found guilty of contempt may be fined up
to $1,000 for each separate act of contempt. (CCP § 1218.)
 
Here,
Defendant submitted evidence that this Court entered an order on November 20,
2023, compelling Gold Point and its counsel to pay monetary sanctions of $1,400
in connection with Redwood’s motion to compel responses from Gold Point to its
Special Interrogatories, Form Interrogatories, and Request for Production of
documents. (Yu Decl. ¶ 2). This Court also entered an order on December 15,
2023, compelling Gold Point and its counsel to pay monetary sanctions for
$1,400 in connection with Redwood’s motion to deem requests for admission
admitted. (Yu Decl., ¶ 3). Both orders clearly compel Plaintiff and its counsel
to pay monetary sanctions in the total amount of $2,800. Gold Point and its
counsel were served with the orders and asked to pay the sanctions on multiple
occasions. (Yu Decl., ¶ 4). As evidenced by the counsel’s emails dated December
22, 2023, and March 15, 2024, Gold Point and its counsel were well aware of the
orders and their obligations under the orders. (Yu Decl., ¶ 5). Redwood
eventually filed a motion for terminating sanctions based on Gold Point and its
counsel’s noncompliance with the orders, and this Court dismissed Gold Point’s
case for failure to prosecute on March 27, 2024. (Yu Decl., ¶ 6)
 
After
the dismissal, Redwood filed a memorandum of costs seeking $2,216.42. (Yu
Decl., ¶ 7). Under California Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) section 1032(b), a
prevailing party is entitled as a matter of right to recover costs in any
action or proceeding. “Prevailing party” includes a defendant in whose favor a
dismissal is entered. CCP §1032(a)(4). Accordingly, Redwood is the prevailing
party who is entitled to recover costs.
 
In
addition to the penalties, a party or a party’s counsel found in contempt may
be ordered to pay reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs incurred by the party
initiating the contempt proceeding. CCP § 1218(a); Moore v. Superior Court
(2020) 57 Cal.App.5th 441, 463-65 (CCP § 1218(a) does not authorize award of
fees and costs if contempt is not for violation of court order).
 
In
sum, the Court finds Plaintiff to be in contempt. Plaintiff is ordered to pay
all outstanding sanctions owed to Defendants ($2,800.00), pay costs owed to
Defendants as prevailing party ($2,216.42), and is ordered to pay Defendants’
attorney fees associated with this motion ($1,645.00.)  
 
Based
on the foregoing, Defendant’s motion is granted. 
 
 
It is
so ordered.
