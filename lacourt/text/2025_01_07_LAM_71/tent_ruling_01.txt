Plaintiff  Hamid Mogadam’s unopposed motion to compel Defendant  Malcolm Tripp to provide further responses to his Requests for Admission (Set One)  is granted.  Defendant Malcolm Tripp to  provide further, Code-compliant responses to Plaintiff’s Requests for Admission  (Set One) within 20 days of this ruling.

Plaintiff moves unopposed  for an order to compel Defendant to respond to his Requests for Admission (Set  One) (“RFA”).  (Notice of Motion, pg. 1;  C.C.P. §2033.290(d).) Plaintiff also  requests an award of sanctions against Defendant in the total amount of $7,373.00  for his failure to substantively respond to the written discovery at issue and  the inability to demonstrate that he has acted with substantial justification  or that other circumstances exist that would make imposition of such sanctions  unjust.  (Notice of Motion, pg. 1.)[1]   1.      Motion to Compel FROG Having reviewed Plaintiff’s unopposed Motion to Compel Responses  from Defendant to Plaintiff’s FROG, the Court rules as follows.           On August 19, 2024,  Plaintiff served FROG on Defendant.   (Decl. of Witt ¶2.)  On September  20, 2024, Defendant’s counsel emailed Plaintiff’s counsel Defendant’s responses  to FROG, which was comprised of boilerplate objections.  (Decl. of Witt ¶3, Exh. D.)  Plaintiff now moves to compel responses to  the FROG. Plaintiff’s motion to compel responses is granted pursuant to C.C.P. §2030.290(b).  Defendant is ordered to provide verified  responses to Plaintiff’s FROG compliant with C.C.P. §§2030.210(a) and 2030.220 without  objections within 20 days. Moving Party is to give notice of this  ruling.    2.      Motion to Compel RFA Meet and Confer           A motion under subdivision (a) shall be accompanied by a  meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040.  (C.C.P. §2033.290(b)(1).) Plaintiff’s counsel declares  the parties participated in an IDC with this Court on October 17, 2024.  (Decl. of Witt ¶8.)  The Court deemed the issues in the IDC  unresolved.  (10/17/24 IDC Minute Order.)   Having reviewed Plaintiff’s unopposed  Motion to Compel Responses to RFA against Defendant, the Court rules as  follows. On August 19, 2024,  Plaintiff served RFA on Defendant.   (Decl. of Witt ¶2.)  On September  20, 2024, Defendant’s counsel emailed Plaintiff’s counsel Defendant’s responses  to RFA, which was comprised of objections.   (Decl. of Witt ¶3, Exh. C.)   Plaintiff now moves to compel Defendant to provide responses to Plaintiff’s  RFA.            Plaintiff’s motion to compel Defendant to provide responses  to Plaintiff’s RFA is improper; a motion to compel responses to an RFA does not  exist.  Where responses have  been timely served but are deemed deficient by the requesting party (e.g.,  because of objections or evasive responses), that party may move for an order  compelling a further response.  (C.C.P.  §2033.290.)  Here, Plaintiff’s notice of  motion is made under the proper subsection, §2033.290(d).  Because Plaintiff’s  motion is in effect a motion to compel further answers, and provides notice of  the proper C.C.P. subsection, the Court will consider Plaintiff’s motion.           Plaintiff’s motion is granted pursuant to C.C.P. §2033.290(a).  Defendant is  ordered to provide further, Code-compliant responses to the RFA within 20 days  of this ruling.           Plaintiff requests sanctions of $7,373.00 pursuant to C.C.P.  § 2033.290(d).  Defendant does not oppose  this request.  Accordingly, Plaintiff’s  request for sanctions is granted. Moving Party is to give  notice of this ruling.        Dated:  January  _____, 2025
