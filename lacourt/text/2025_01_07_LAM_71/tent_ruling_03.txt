   [1] The Court notes Plaintiff’s motion improperly  combines two motions to compel pertaining to two different discovery requests  into a single motion. A motion must be brought separately against each party  and discovery method at issue.  The  instant motion should have been filed as two separate motions and two filing  fees paid.  Instead, Defendant filed only  one motion and paid one filing fee. “[P]ayment of filing fees is both mandatory  and jurisdictional.”  (Hu v. Silgan  Containers Corp. (1999) 70 Cal.App.4th 1261, 1269.)  Therefore, Plaintiff owes this Court $60.00  in filing fees.
