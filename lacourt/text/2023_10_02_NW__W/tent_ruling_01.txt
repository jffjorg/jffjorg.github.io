DISCUSSION
 
Defendant PetSmart, LLC moves this court for an order
compelling Plaintiff to provide responses to Defendant’s Request for Production
of Documents (Set One).
 
Where a party fails to serve timely responses to
discovery requests, the court may make an order compelling responses. (CCP §§
2030.290, 2031.300, 2033.280; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific
Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 403.) A party that fails
to serve a timely response to the discovery request waives any objection to the
request, including one based on privilege or the protection of attorney work
product. (CCP §§ 2030.290(a), 2031.300(a), 2033.280(a); Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting,
Inc., supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at 404.) Pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 2033.010, the propounding party may also move for an order
that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in
the requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction. (CCP §
2033.280(b).)
 
On March 27, 2023, Defense counsel served to Plaintiff
Patricia Hart’s counsel its initial written discovery which included Form
Interrogatories, Set One, Special Interrogatories, Set One, and Demand for
Production of Documents, Set One. (Fazel Decl., ¶2, Exh. A.) Plaintiff’s
responses to the discovery was due on or before April 28, 2023. (Fazel Decl.
¶2.) Two days before the deadline, Plaintiff’s counsel requested a 30 day extension
of time to respond to that outstanding written discovery. (Fazel Decl. ¶3.)
Defense counsel agreed to extend Plaintiff’s deadline to respond to that
discovery to on or before May 28, 2023. (Fazel Decl., ¶3, Exh. B.) No further
extensions were requested. (Fazel Decl. ¶3.) Defense counsel did not receive any
responses on or before May 28, 2023 and on July 6, 2023, Defense counsel set
Plaintiff’s counsel a meet and confer letter regarding the status of the
belated discovery responses. (Fazel Decl. ¶¶3-4.) Defense counsel requested
Plaintiff provide verified responses without objections, or at the very least,
contact counsel to discuss by July 10, 2023. Plaintiff’s counsel never
responded to that letter. (Fazel Decl. ¶4.) However, Defense counsel has not
heard from Plaintiff nor were any responses provided. (Fazel Decl. ¶5.) At the
time of the filing of this Motion, Defendant states Plaintiff’s responses have
yet to be received. (Fazel Decl. ¶6.) 
 
As such, Defendant’s unopposed motion to compel
Plaintiff’s discovery responses to Defendant’s Request for Production of Documents,
Set One is GRANTED. Plaintiff is ordered to produce verified discovery
responses without objection in twenty days.
 
Sanctions
 
Defendant also seeks monetary sanctions in the amount
of $1,347.50 for Plaintiff’s failure to provide any responses whatsoever. 
 
If a propounding party moves for and obtains a court
order compelling a response, the court shall impose monetary sanctions against
the party failing to timely respond to interrogatories and demands for
inspection unless that party acted with substantial justification or the
sanction would otherwise be unjust. (CCP §§ 2030.290(c), 2031.300(c); Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc., supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at 404.) 
 
Defendant seeks $1,347.50 for reviewing the preparing
the motion, anticipating review of any opposition, drafting a reply, and
attending the hearing on the motion, which Defendant estimates to be 5.5 hours
in total. Defense counsel’s hourly rate is $245.00 an hour. Defense counsel also
adjusted the fees in light of Defendant’s concurrently filed discovery motions.

 
The court grants Defendant’s request for monetary
sanctions in the reduced amount of $551.25.
