And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has tentatively ruled that the Motion to Expunge Notice of Pendency of Action and Request for Attorney's Fees and Costs filed by Defendant Adnan Mohamed Aljojo is granted in part. The court finds that the lis pendens filed by Plaintiff Emad Aljojo lacks probable validity and is void due to procedural deficiencies. The court orders that the lis pendens be expunged and grants the request for attorney's fees in the amount of $10,500.00. However, the court awards no additional attorney's fees as the requested relief is duplicative of a similar motion filed in a related case. The court also grants the parties' respective requests for judicial notice.
