BACKGROUND
            
On March 24, 2022, Plaintiff Emad Aljojo sued Defendant
Adnan Mohamed Aljojo, alleging a single cause of action for Cancellation of
Written Instrument by Fraud in Factum and Non-Delivery. Plaintiff and Defendant
are siblings. Plaintiff alleges Defendant recorded a fraudulent deed
transferring Plaintiff’s real property to Defendant.
 
Before the Court is Defendant’s Motion to
Expunge Notice of Pendency of Action and Request for Attorney’s Fees and Costs.
Defendant moves to expunge the lis pendens filed by Plaintiff as to 4716
Melrose Avenue, Los Angeles, CA 90029 Defendant also seeks attorney’s fees in
the sum of $10,500.00. 
 
The motion is made on the grounds that “Plaintiff’s
alleged real property claim lacks probable validity . . . and/or the lis
pendens is void and invalid for failure to comply with the service and filing
requirements of Code of Civil Procedure § 405.22.” (Not. of Mot. at p. ii:14-18.)

 
JUDICIAL NOTICE
 
            The Court GRANTS the parties’ respective requests
for judicial notice. (Evid. Code §§ 452, 453.) 
 
ANALYSIS
 
When a motion to
expunge a lis pendens is filed, the burden is on the opposing party to show
that the complaint contains allegations of a real-property claim, and to show
the probable validity of the claim based upon a preponderance of evidence. (CCP
§§ 405.32, 405.31, 405.30; Howard S. Wright Construction Co. v. Superior Court
(2003) 106 Cal. App. 4th 314, 319.) “[T]he court shall order that the notice be
expunged if the court finds that the claimant has not established by a
preponderance of the evidence the probable validity of the real property claim.
The court shall not order an undertaking to be given as a condition of
expunging the notice if the court finds the claimant has not established the
probable validity of the real property claim.” (CCP § 405.32.) 
 
Plaintiff concedes that the lis pendens should be expunged due to
procedural deficiencies as to the filing and service. The Court need not
address the other arguments. 
 
            Plaintiff requests leave
to record another lis pendens. If Plaintiff wishes to record another lis
pendens, Plaintiff may file a motion requesting such relief. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 405.36.) 
 
            The Court awarded attorneys fees in
an identical motion in the related case NADIA KAMEL SALEM vs ADNAN ALJOJO. No. 22STCV09355.
The Court finds that further attorneys fees here would be duplicative and are
unnecessary.
