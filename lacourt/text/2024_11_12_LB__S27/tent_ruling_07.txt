 Case Number:  23LBCV02177    Hearing Date:   November 12, 2024    Dept:  S27 1.     Background
Facts
Plaintiff Mediterranean Shipping
Company (USA) Inc. (“Plaintiff”) sued defendant Green Valley Trucking, Inc.
(“Defendant”) on November 15, 2023 for breach of contract and related claims.
On August 22 and August 23, 2024,
respectively, Defendant moved for an order to compel Plaintiff to respond to
Defendant’s Form Interrogatories, Set One, and Requests for Production of
Documents, Set One. (On October 15, 2024, the Court granted an equivalent
motion to deem matters admitted for failure to timely respond to requests for
admission.)
On October 29, 2024, Plaintiff
filed its opposition. On November 1, 2024, Defendant replied.
 
2.     Motion
to Compel
a.     Legal
Standard
Pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.290, “[i]f a party to whom
interrogatories are directed fails to serve a timely response . . . [t]he party
to whom the interrogatories are directed waives any right to exercise the
option to produce writings under Section 2030.230, as well as any objection to
the interrogatories, including one based on privilege or the protection for
work product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 2018.010.  . .
.   [and] The party propounding the interrogatories may move for an
order compelling response to the interrogatories.”  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.290 (a)-(b).)  
Similarly,
under Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.300, “[i]f a party to whom a demand
for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is directed fails to serve a
timely response to it . . . [t]he party to whom the demand for inspection,
copying, testing, or sampling is directed waives any objection to the demand,
including one based on privilege or on the protection for work product under
Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 2018.010.  . . .   [and] The
party making the demand may move for an order compelling response to the
demand.  (Id., § 2031.300(a)-(b).)  
 
b.     Discussion
Plaintiff’s counsel’s declaration
and the exhibits to Plaintiff’s memoranda of authorities establish (1)
Plaintiff propounded the disputed discovery on May 10, 2024 (MPA, Exh. A), and
(2) at the time of filing, Plaintiff had received no response (Garber Decl., ¶
3). Plaintiff did not file a declaration of counsel supporting his form
interrogatories motion (he filed two Proposed Orders instead), but Defendant
did not deny Plaintiff’s contention in its opposition.
Each of Defendant’s oppositions
contends the motions should be denied because it “filed the attached responses
to Defendant’s [discovery]”. The oppositions have no attached exhibits, nor are
they signed, by Defendant or its attorney. Defendant’s oppositions are legally
inoperative.
Plaintiff is entitled to the order
it seeks.
 
 
c.     Sanctions
“The court shall impose a monetary
sanction under [section 2023.010 et seq.] against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel [initial
responses] ... unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290(c) [interrogatories],
2031.300(c) [requests for production].)
Defendant does not contend it was
substantially justified in its failure to serve responses or that sanctions
would otherwise be unjust. Sanctions are mandatory.
Plaintiff seeks an eminently
reasonable $960.00 in fees and costs in connection with each of its motions.
The Court grants both requests and imposes a total of $1,920.00 in sanctions
for both motions.
 
3.     Conclusion
Plaintiff’s motions are granted. Defendant
is ordered to provide Code-compliant responses to the disputed discovery,
without objections, and to pay $1,920.00 in sanctions to Plaintiff and/or its
counsel of record within thirty (30) days of this order.
Moving Plaintiff is ordered to give
notice.
