And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling denying the motion to consolidate the instant action (Case Number 23LBCV02005) with the Kroger Action (LASC Case No. 23STLC07801). The Court finds that the cases have not been deemed related and have not been related in a single department, which is a requirement for consolidation under Los Angeles County Court Rules, Rule 3.3(g)(1). Additionally, the Court finds that the motion is procedurally deficient because it did not comply with California Rules of Court, rule 3.350(a)(1)(A) and (C), and did not serve the motion on the sole plaintiff in the Kroger Action, The Kroger Company. The Court orders that the motion is denied without prejudice.
