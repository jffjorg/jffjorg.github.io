Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by the Long Beach Unified School District to the complaint filed by Jayar Vat, a minor, and his Guardian Ad Litem, Marliny Sok. The complaint alleges that the District is liable for premises liability and negligence due to an incident where Jayar Vat suffered burns on his face due to hot exposed metal pipes at Smith Elementary School.

The judge has sustained the demurrer, meaning that the complaint fails to adequately state a cause of action against the public entity. The judge has found that the complaint fails to specify an underlying statutory basis for liability and does not provide sufficient factual allegations to support the claim.

The judge has given the plaintiff 20 days to amend the complaint and has granted leave to amend. The parties are ordered to submit on the tentative ruling by sending an email to the court indicating their intention to do so.
