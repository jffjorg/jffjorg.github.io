  Case Number:  23LBCP00476    Hearing Date:   November 12, 2024    Dept:  S27 1.     Background
Facts
On December 26, 2023, Petitioners
Long Beach Reform Coalition and Corliss Lee (collectively, “Petitioners”) filed
a verified petition for peremptory writ of mandate (the “Petition”) against
Respondents Dean C. Logan, Registrar-Recorder/City Clerk for Los Angeles
County; Monique De La Garza, City Clerk of Long Beach (“City Clerk”); and Dawn
A. McIntosh, as City Attorney of Long Beach, Real Party in Interest (“City
Attorney”) alleging causes of action for: (1) peremptory writ of mandate to
amend title and summary of Measure RW pursuant to Cal. Election Code sections
3204 and 9295; and (2) peremptory writ of mandate to amend title and summary of
Measure RW pursuant to Cal. Election Code section 13314. Petitioners sought
amendment of the Title & Summary of Measure RW, which is a minimum wage
related ordinance for hotel workers in the City of Long Beach. 
On December 28, 2023, Petitioners
filed an ex parte application to shorten time for the hearing on the
Petition, which was opposed by Dean C. Logan in his official capacity as the
County of Los Angeles Registrar-Record/County Clerk. 
 
On January 3, 2024, the Court
granted the ex parte application filed by Petitioners. (01/03/24 Minute
Order.) The Court’s order provides that “[p]ursuant to Government Code sections
68086, 70044, California Rules of Court, rule 2.956, and the stipulation of the
appearing parties,” a certified shorthand reporter was “appointed as an
official Court reporter pro tempore” in the proceedings. (01/03/24 Minute Order
at p. 1.) The Court held a hearing on the Petition and heard testimony.
(01/03/24 Minute Order at p. 1.) The Court denied the Petition. (01/03/24
Minute Order at p. 2.) The Court ordered Respondents to submit a proposed
judgment for the Court’s signature. (01/03/24 Minute Order at p. 2.) 
 
On January 10, 2024, an order was
entered denying the Petition and entering judgment in favor of Respondents.   
 
On January 23, 2024, Respondents
City Attorney and City Clerk (collectively, “Respondents”) filed and served a
notice of entry of judgement. 
 
Also, on January 23, 2024,
Respondents filed and served a memorandum of costs in which Respondents request
$3,276.15 in costs for Court-ordered transcripts. The memorandum of costs was
served on Petitioners by mail. 
            
            On February
13, 2024, the Court issued an order awarding costs to Respondents and awarded
Respondents costs in the amount of $3,276.15.[1]
(02/13/24 Order at p. 2:10-13.) The Court’s order noted that Petitioners did
not file any objection to Respondents’ memorandum of costs within 15 days
pursuant to California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1700(b)(1), or otherwise file any
objection. (02/13/24 Order at p. 2:8-9.) 
 
On February 13, 2024, at 8:05 PM,
which was after entry of the Court’s order concerning costs, Petitioners filed
an objection to the memorandum of costs. Such objection, however, does not set
forth a hearing date or time for a hearing. The objection provides that
“Petitioners . . . hereby oppose and move to strike the Memorandum of Costs
filed by Respondents.” (Objection at p. 1: 19-20.) 
 
On May 23, 2024, Petitioners filed
and served the instant motion for hearing on objection to memorandum of costs,
which sets forth a hearing date and hearing time. (See Not. of Mot. at p.
1:13-14.) Pursuant to the motion, Petitioners “move . . . for an order setting
a hearing date for consideration of Petitioners’ Objection to Memorandum of
Costs filed on April 13, 2024 (sic).” (Not. of Mot. at p. 1:19-21.) 
 
Also, on May 23, 2024, Petitioners
filed a notice of lack of ruling on objection pursuant to CCP § 472(d), which
indicated that the objection had not been ruled upon by the Court as of such
date. 
 
            On October
29, 2024, Respondents filed an opposition to the motion. 
 
            As of November
5, 2024, no reply brief has been filed. Any reply brief was required to have
been filed and served at least five court days prior to hearing. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1005, subd. (b).)    
 
2.     Motion
to Tax Costs 
a.         Parties’ Positions 
Petitioners assert that the charges for court-ordered transcripts set
forth in the memorandum of costs are improper and are baseless. 
 
Respondents contend that: (1) the costs incurred are recoverable
pursuant to CCP § 1033.5(a)(9); (2) Petitioners’ motion is without legal basis
and is untimely; (3) a motion for reconsideration should be denied as untimely;
and (4) a motion for reconsideration should be denied for lack of justiciable
basis.
b.         Legal Standard 
“Except as otherwise provided by statute, a
prevailing party is entitled as a matter of right to recover costs in any
action or proceeding.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1032, subd. (b).) “The right to
recover . . . costs is determined entirely by statute.” (Gorman v. Tassajara
Development Corp. (2009) 178 Cal.App.4th 44, 71.) “In ruling upon a motion
to tax costs, the trial court’s first determination is whether the statute
expressly allows the particular item and whether it appears proper on its
face.” (Ibid.) “If so, the burden is on the objecting party to show the
costs to be unnecessary or unreasonable.” (Ibid.) “Where costs are not
expressly allowed by the statute, the burden is on the party claiming the costs
to show that the charges were reasonable and necessary.”  (Ibid.) “Whether a cost item was
reasonably necessary to the litigation presents a question of fact for the
trial court.” (Ibid., internal quotations omitted.) California Code of
Civil Procedure, Section 1033.5(c)(4) gives a court discretion to allow or deny
a claimed cost where it is not explicitly allowed or prohibited by Section
1033.5.
 
“[T]he items on a
verified cost bill are prima facie evidence the costs, expenses and services
listed were necessarily incurred.” (Hadley v. Krepel (1985) 167
Cal.App.3d 677, 682.) “There is no
requirement that copies of bills, invoices, statements, or any other such
documents be attached to the memorandum.” (Jones v. Dumrichob (1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 1258, 1267.) “Only if the
costs have been put at issue must supporting documentation be submitted.” (Ibid.) “If the items appearing on a cost bill
appear to be proper charges, the burden is on the party seeking to tax costs to
show that they were not reasonable or necessary.” (Ladas v. California State
Auto Assn. (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 761, 774.) “On the other hand, if the
items are properly objected to, they are put in issue and the burden of proof
is on the party claiming them as costs.” (Ibid.) “[T]he mere filing of a
motion to tax costs may be a proper objection to an item, the necessity of
which appears doubtful, or which does not appear to be proper on its face.” (Nelson
v. Anderson (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 111, 131, internal quotations omitted.)

 
c.         Timeliness  
“Any notice of motion to strike or tax costs must be served and filed 15
days after service of the cost memorandum. If the cost memorandum was served by
mail, the period is extended as provided in Code of Civil Procedure section
1013.” (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1700(b)(1).)  Where service is effectuated by mail “any
period of notice and any right or duty to do any act or make any response
within any period or on a date certain after service of the document, which
time period or date is prescribed by statute or rule of court, shall be
extended five calendar days . . . if the place or address and the place of
mailing is within the State of California . . . .” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1013,
subd. (a).) “If the last day for the performance of an act provided or required
by law to be performed within a specified period of time is a holiday, then
that period is hereby extended to and including the next day that is not a
holiday.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 12a, subd. (a).) 
 
The Court finds that the objection filed by Petitioners on February 13,
2024 is timely under Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1700(b)(1). The memorandum of
costs was served on Petitioners by mail on January 23, 2024. Thus, any
objection or motion to tax costs was required to have been filed and served by February
12, 2024. The Court, however, takes judicial notice on its own motion that
Monday, February 12, 2024 was a court holiday.[2] Thus,
the objection to the memorandum of costs was timely filed.
 
Although the objection was timely filed, the Court opines as to why
Petitioners did not provide a noticed hearing date and time on such objection.
“Notices must be in writing, and the notice of motion . . . must state when,
and the grounds upon which it will be made, and the papers, if any, upon which
it is to be based.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 1010.) A notice of motion must, on the
first page, set forth “[t]he date, time, and location, if ascertainable, of any
scheduled hearing and the name of the hearing judge if ascertainable.” (Cal.
Rules of Court, Rule 3.1110(b)(1).) 
 
Here, the Court finds that the objection to the memorandum of costs
cannot be construed as a motion because it did not articulate a hearing date or
hearing time. Thus, the Court finds that the purported objection is too
procedurally deficient to function as a noticed motion. It follows that the
noticed motion for hearing on objection to memorandum of costs—which was filed
on May 23, 2024—is untimely under Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1700(b)(1).
Petitioners should have filed and served a noticed motion to tax costs no later
than February 13, 2024. Here, Petitioners failed to file such motion within the
timeline articulated in Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1700(b)(1).
 
Thus, the Court denies Petitioners’ request to strike and/or tax Respondents’
costs. 
 
d.        Respondents’ Costs are
Proper   
Even if Petitioners’ objection or
the instant motion had been timely filed, the Court would have found that
Respondents’ claimed costs are proper. Transcripts of court proceedings ordered
by the court are allowable as costs. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (a)(9).)
The Court appointed the court reporter at the hearing on the Petition.
(01/03/24 Minute Order.) Further, a memorandum of costs is prima facie
evidence that the costs were reasonably and necessarily incurred. Petitioners
present no declarations or evidence to support their contention that the costs
for court-ordered transcripts were unnecessary or unreasonable. Petitioners
have presented only mere argument to support their contention that the costs
should be stricken. 
 
Therefore, the Court finds that
Respondents’ costs are proper, and Petitioners have not met their burden
challenging such costs. The Court will not strike or tax Respondents’
memorandum of costs. 
 
3.     Conclusion
The Court therefore DENIES the
objection to the memorandum of costs. The Court also DENIES the instant motion
to set a hearing on the objection to the memorandum of costs. 
 
Petitioners are ordered to give
