Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the petitioners' request to strike and/or tax the respondents' costs. The petitioners had objected to the respondents' memorandum of costs, claiming that the costs were improper and baseless. However, the judge found that the objection was procedurally deficient and too late, as it did not provide a noticed hearing date and time. The judge also found that the respondents' costs were proper and should be allowed, as they were incurred reasonably and necessarily in connection with the court proceedings. The judge denied the petitioners' request to strike and/or tax the respondents' costs, and ordered that the respondents be awarded their costs in the amount of $3,276.15.
