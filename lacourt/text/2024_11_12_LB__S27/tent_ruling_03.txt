 Case Number:  23LBCV00153    Hearing Date:   November 12, 2024    Dept:  S27 1.     Background
Facts
This action arises from an
automobile accident that occurred on August 27, 2022, at the intersection of
San Pedro and 16th Street in Los Angeles, CA. On January 26, 2023, Plaintiff
Ramona Cua, Allen Tambriz, by and through is guardian ad litem, Ramona
Cua, and Christian Tambriz, by and through his guardian ad litem, Ramona
Cua (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) filed a complaint against Defendants Wanda
Norman (“Norman”), Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority
(“LACMTA”), and Does 1 to 25, inclusive (collectively, “Defendants”) alleging
causes of action for: (1) motor vehicle; and (2) general negligence. 
 
On January 31, 2023, Ramona Cua was
appointed as guardian ad litem for Plaintiffs Allen Tambriz and
Christian Tambriz. 
On April 7, 2023, Defendants Norman
and LACMTA filed a joint answer to the complaint. 
 
On April 17, 2023, Defendant LACMTA
filed a cross-complaint against Cross-Defendant Francine Pearce (“Pearce”)
alleging causes of action for: (1) indemnification; (2) apportionment of fault;
and (3) declaratory relief. 
 
On August 23, 2023, Pearce filed a
complaint against Defendants LACMTA and Norman, alleging causes of action for:
(1) motor vehicle; and (2) general negligence. 

 
On August 25, 2023, Plaintiff
Ramona Cua filed an amendment to complaint, which identified Francine Detriech
Pearce as Doe 1. 
 
On September 26, 2023, Pearce filed
an answer to the cross-complaint.  
 
On June 14, 2024, Hadiar Awad, attorney
of record for Pearce concerning her affirmative complaint, filed a motion to be
relieved as counsel, which was denied by the Court, after hearing, on July 9,
2024. (07/09/24 Minute Order.) The Court denied the motion for, among other
defects, not containing an attorney declaration on mandatory judicial council
form MC-052 and the lack of a proposed order on mandatory judicial council form
MC-053. (07/09/24 Minute Order.)  
 
            On August
9, 2024, Haidar Awad filed another motion to be relieved as counsel for Pearce,
which was denied by the Court, after hearing, on September 5, 2024. (09/05/24
Minute Order.) The Court indicated that “Counsel declare[d] Client’s address
has been confirmed via skip trace, which did not identify any new address. Skip
trace is a method for determining potential addresses for service, but is not a
method for ensuring a person continues to live at a given address. If Counsel
is unable to confirm Client’s address by mail, return receipt requested,
telephone, and/or conversation, Counsel must re-file the motion and check box
3b(2), clarifying all efforts that have been made to confirm the address.”
(09/05/24 Minute Order at p. 1.) The Court further indicated that “Counsel’s
proof of service indicates Counsel served Client with the moving papers by
certified mail, return receipt requested. If Counsel appears and provides a
copy of the return receipt with Client’s signature, and/or lodges the signed
return receipt prior to the hearing, the Court will be satisfied on the issue
of service.” (09/05/24 Minute Order at p. 1.) The Court also denied the motion
on the additional ground that the motion was “set to be heard only one month
prior to the scheduled 10/07/24 trial date.” (09/05/24 Minute Order at p. 1.)      
 
            On
September 9, 2024, pursuant to a stipulation between the parties, the Court
entered an order continuing the trial date from October 7, 2024 to December 2,
2024.[1] 
 
            On October
17, 2024, Haidar Awad, Esq. and Maximus Law, APC filed the instant motion to be
relieved as counsel. 
 
2.     Motion
to be Relieved as Counsel 
a.         Legal Standard
The court may order
that an attorney be changed or substituted at any time before or after judgment
or final determination upon request by either client or attorney and after
notice from one to the other. (Code of Civ. Proc., § 284(2).) “The
determination whether to grant or deny a motion to withdraw as counsel lies
within the sound discretion of the trial court.” (Manfredi & Levine v.
Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128, 1133.)   
 
An application to
be relieved as counsel must be made on Judicial Counsel Form MC-051 (Notice of
Motion and Motion) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(a)), MC-052 (Declaration)
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(c)), and MC-053 (Proposed Order) (Cal. Rules
of Court, rule 3.1362(e)). The proposed order must specify all hearing dates
scheduled in the action or proceeding, including the date of trial, if
known.  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362(e).) 
 
Further, the
requisite forms must be served on the client and all other parties who have
appeared in the case. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(d).) The court may
delay the effective date of the order relieving counsel until proof of service
of a copy of the signed order on the client has been filed with the court.
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(e).) A motion to withdraw will not be granted
where withdrawal would prejudice the client. 
(Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915.)  
 
b.         Discussion  
Haidar Awad, attorney of record for Plaintiff, Francine Pearce, seeks to
be relieved as counsel, declaring the relationship is unreasonably difficult to
carry out and Plaintiff would benefit from a change of representation. 
 
Initially, the Court notes that the Form MC-051 is incomplete. In
section 1 of such form—where the name of the withdrawing attorney is to be
entered—Counsel has left such section blank. Ms. Pearce is entitled to proper
notice and Counsel should have set forth their name in Section 1 of Form
MC-051.   
 
Counsel declares that it has been unable to confirm Client’s current
address or locate a more current address for Client after: (1) mailing the
motion papers to Client’s last known address, return receipt requested; (2)
calling Client’s last known telephone number or numbers; and (3) conducting a
skip trace report, which was unable to locate any other possible address. (Form
MC-052 at Section 3b(2).) Counsel declares that it has been unable to
personally serve any document at Client’s last known address. (Form MC-052 at
Section 3b(2).)  
 
Counsel has not followed this Court’s instructions set forth in its
September 5, 2024 order. (09/05/24 Minute Order.) None of the proofs of service,
declarations of non-service, or unsigned return receipts attached to either the
Form MC-051, Form MC-052, or Form MC-053 shows that service of the instant
motion was attempted on Plaintiff Francine Detriech Pearce. Further, Counsel
has not provided a copy of a signed return receipt with the signature of
Plaintiff Francine Detriech Pearce. 
 
The Court finds that the issue of service has not been remedied. Counsel
should have undertook efforts to serve the instant motion on their client. The
fact that Counsel attempted to serve Client with past motions to be relieved as
counsel does not warrant the granting of the instant motion. 
 
3.     Conclusion
The Motion to be Relieved as
Counsel is DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.  
 
Haidar Awad, Esq. is ordered to
give notice.
