Court notes that its order contains an error indicating that costs are awarded
to Petitioners and that Petitioners filed a memorandum of costs. (See 02/13/24
Order.) Respondents, and not Petitioners, filed a memorandum of costs. Thus,
the order should reflect that Respondents are awarded costs in the amount of
$3,276.15 and not Petitioners.

may take judicial notice on its own motion. (Estate of Sanchez (2023) 95
