And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering the defendant's motion to compel the plaintiff's deposition and the defendant's request for sanctions. The plaintiff, Sandra Luz Sarmiento, filed a complaint against the defendant, Niko Llamas, alleging negligence and premises liability. The defendant served three separate notices of deposition, but the plaintiff failed to appear at each deposition. The plaintiff's counsel claimed to have scheduling conflicts and communication issues with the plaintiff, but the judge finds that these excuses are not convincing.

The judge grants the defendant's motion to compel the plaintiff's deposition and awards sanctions to the defendant in the amount of $5,025.00. The plaintiff is ordered to pay the sanctions within 30 days of the order. The parties are also ordered to schedule the deposition of the plaintiff within 30 days of the order.
