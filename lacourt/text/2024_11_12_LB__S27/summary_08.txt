The judge has denied Plaintiff Cecila L. Wong's motion to compel Defendant Leroy Stone to provide further responses to discovery requests. The judge found that Plaintiff's counsel did not make a good-faith effort to meet and confer with Defendant's counsel before filing the motion, as required by California Code of Civil Procedure section 2016.040. The judge also noted that Plaintiff's counsel's declaration did not demonstrate a sincere effort to resolve the matter.
