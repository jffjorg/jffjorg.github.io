And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to compel arbitration and stayed the action pending the completion of arbitration. The plaintiff, Christina Mary Balian, had filed a lawsuit against Macy's Inc. and others alleging employment discrimination, unlawful harassment, and other claims. The defendant moved to compel arbitration of the dispute, arguing that the plaintiff had signed an electronic agreement to arbitration as a condition of employment. The court found that the preponderance of evidence supported a finding that the plaintiff had electronically signed the New Hire Acknowledgement form, which contained an arbitration provision. The court also found that the plaintiff had not met her burden to show that the arbitration clause should not be enforced. Therefore, the defendant's motion to compel arbitration was granted, and the action was stayed pending the completion of arbitration.
