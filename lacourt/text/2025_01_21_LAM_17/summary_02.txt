And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion for a stay of proceedings in this case. The defendant argued that a stay is necessary pending the California Second Appellate District's decision in the Barrington Appeal, which involves similar allegations by current and former tenants of the defendant's apartment buildings. However, the judge finds that even if the Barrington Appeal resolves the identical issues being addressed in this case, it will not entirely resolve this claim. Therefore, granting a stay would create inefficiency and waste by indefinitely delaying litigation of this case. The judge concludes that insufficient grounds exist for a stay of proceedings, and the defendant's motion is denied.
