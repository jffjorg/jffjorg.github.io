Discussion 
 
            Defendants
argue that a stay is appropriate here, pending the California Second Appellate
District’s decision on the matter Stacy Kate Yeh vs. Barrington Pacific,
LLC, et al., Court of Appeal Case No. B337904 (the Barrington Appeal). 
 
Here, these
consolidated cases are brought by plaintiffs who are either current or former
tenants of Defendants’ apartment buildings throughout Los Angeles County and
who bring identical claims under the California Investigative Consumer
Reporting Agencies Act (ICRAA) for Defendants’ allegedly obtaining
investigative consumer reports about each of the plaintiffs during the
processing of their rental applications and the alleged failure to comply with
mandatory requirements, disclosures, and authorizations required under ICRAA. (See
Baarts Decl., ¶¶ 2-3.) Plaintiffs seek actual and statutory damages on the
basis that Defendants allegedly failed to provide proper disclosures in
compliance with ICRAA including providing a “box to check” on the Plaintiffs’
rental applications. (Id.) Allegedly, the “box to check” would have
provided the means for Plaintiffs’ to indicate if they wanted to obtain the
consumer investigation report obtained in relation to their application. (Id.)
 
Defendants
contend that the Barrington Appeal contains nearly identical allegations by
current and former tenants of its apartment buildings throughout Los Angeles
County, and is represented by the same counsel as Plaintiffs in this matter. 
 
On January
18, 2024, Barrington Pacific, LLC obtained a summary judgment ruling in its
favor, with the trial court there concluding that Plaintiffs lacked standing to
bring their claims under ICRAA because no actual damages had been suffered.
Plaintiffs appealed. Plaintiffs’ opening brief is due December 6, 2024 and
briefing is expected to conclude in early 2025. 
 
Defendants
argue that “[t]he Second Appellate District’s decision in the Barrington Appeal
will have a direct and precedential impact on this matter which seeks to
resolve the identical issues being addressed by the Barrington Appeal. If the
Judge Long’s ruling is upheld, it will provide substantial guidance to this
Court and the Parties in narrowing, resolving, or eliminating Plaintiffs’
claims. Its guidance will be invaluable in promoting judicial economy and
preserving the Parties’ resources.” (Motion to Stay, 4: 11-15.)
 
However, even
Defendants’ argument implicitly acknowledges that the Barrington Appeal will
not entirely resolve this claim, regardless of the outcome. Given that the
Appeal is in the very preliminary stages, as is this consolidated case, the
Court finds that a stay would actually create inefficiency and waste, by
indefinitely delaying litigation of this case while a ruling is challenged
which, regardless of the outcome, will not resolve this case. 
 
Accordingly,
the Court finds insufficient grounds for a stay of proceedings.
 
Based on the
foregoing, Defendants’ motion for a stay of proceedings is denied. 
 
It is so ordered.
