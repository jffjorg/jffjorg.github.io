And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, Arthur Wuthong Shi, has moved to strike the third cause of action for negligence in the complaint filed by the plaintiff, Jane Doe. The plaintiff alleges that the defendant owed her a duty of care to refrain from causing her harm or injuries, but breached that duty by touching her breasts and private parts. The plaintiff claims damages in an amount to be determined at trial, but no less than $1,000,000.00.

The defendant argues that the third cause of action is improperly drawn in conformity with the law because it alleges a specific amount of damages. The judge agrees with the defendant and grants the motion to strike the third cause of action, allowing the plaintiff 20 days to amend the complaint.

The judge also denies the defendant's request to seal the original complaint. The order will be served on the parties, and the defendant will provide notice of the order.
