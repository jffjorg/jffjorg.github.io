(“Motion & Flow”) filed a motion for leave to file the first amended answers (“FAAs”) to the complaints of Plaintiff, Zurich/Interstate, Westchester, Ascot, Berkshire, and NTS.  The Court is not in receipt of an opposition brief.On August 26, 2024, UAC filed a motion to compel NTS’s further responses to requests for production, set one (“RPD”).  On September 20, 2024, NTS filed an opposition brief.  On September 30, 2024, UAC filed a reply brief.On August 28, 2024, Petitioner/Plaintiff Deisi Martinez filed a petition for approval of compromise of claim or action or disposition of proceeds of judgment for minor Plaintiff Angela Savana Gonzalez.   The Court is not in receipt of an opposition brief.On September 6, 2024, UAC filed a motion to continue the trial date.  On September 26, 2024, UAC filed a notice of non-opposition to the motion to continue trial, stating that it was not in receipt of an opposition brief.On September 9, 2024, UAC filed a motion to sever and/or bifurcate trial.  On September 20, 2024, NTS filed an opposition brief.  On September 20, 2024, Parker Hannifin filed an opposition brief.  On September 20, 2024, Westchester Surplus Lines Insurance Company, Ascot Specialty Insurance Company, and Ascot Underwriting Ltd filed an opposition brief.  On September 30, 2024, UAC filed a joint reply brief.  MOTION FOR LEAVE TO FILE THE FIRST AMENDED ANSWERSA.   Legal StandardCCP § 473(a)(1) states: “The court may, in furtherance of justice, and on any terms as may be proper, allow a party to amend any pleading or proceeding by adding or striking out the name of any party, or by correcting a mistake in the name of a party, or a mistake in any other respect; and may, upon like terms, enlarge the time for answer or demurrer. The court may likewise, in its discretion, after notice to the adverse party, allow, upon any terms as may be just, an amendment to any pleading or proceeding in other particulars; and may upon like terms allow an answer to be made after the time limited by this code.”             CRC rule 3.1324 requires a motion seeking leave to amend to include a copy of the proposed pleadings, to identify the amendments, and to be accompanied by a declaration including the following facts:            1) The effect of the amendment;            2) Why the amendment is necessary and proper;            3) When the facts giving rise to the amended allegations were discovered; and            4) The reasons why the request for amendment was not made earlier.The Court’s discretion regarding granting leave to amend is usually exercised liberally to permit amendment of pleadings.  (Nestle v. Santa Monica (1972) 6 Cal.3d 920, 939.)  If a motion to amend is timely made and the granting of the motion will not prejudice the opposing party, it is error to refuse permission to amend.  (Morgan v. Superior Court of Los Angeles County (1959) 172 Cal.App.2d 527, 530.)B.    Discussion of Merits            Motion & Flow moves to amend the answers to the complaints of Plaintiff, Zurich/Interstate, Westchester, Ascot, Berkshire, and NTS.  The proposed FAAs are attached as Exhibits A to F.             Motion & Flow states that the proposed amendments do not delete any allegations.  It argues that it seeks to add the Witt v. Johnson (1961) 57 Cal.2d 57 affirmative defense to its answers to Plaintiff’s complaint at 8:16-26; Zurich/Interstate’s complaint at 1:1-11; Westchester’s complaint at 4:22-5:2; Ascot’s complaint at 4:25-5:7; Berkshire’s complaint at 5:1-11; and NTS’s complaint at 8:8-18.  (Mot. at p.4.)In support of the motion, Motion & Flow provides the declaration of its counsel Andrew C. Hubert.  Mr. Hubert states that the effect of the amendment is to include the Witt worker’s compensation offset as an affirmative defense.  (Hubert Decl., ¶3.)  He states that the amendments are necessary and proper because an offset would reduce and potential recovery against Motion & Flow.  (Id., ¶4.)  He states that his office discovered the facts giving rise to the amended allegations in June 2024.  (Id., ¶5.)  Mr. Hubert states that Decedent’s employer, NTS, did not become a party to the action until October 12, 2023, when it filed a complaint-in-intervention and the parties did not take NTS’s depositions until June 2024, which confirmed fault by NTS.  (Id.)             Based on the moving papers, the Court grants Motion & Flow’s motion for leave to file the proposed amended answers.  The motion papers and Mr. Hubert’s declaration address the factors under CRC Rule 3.1324.  In addition, the Court recognizes the liberal policy in allowing amendment.  “[T]he court's discretion will usually be exercised liberally to permit amendment of the pleadings.  The policy favoring amendment is so strong that it is a rare case in which denial of leave to amend can be justified.”  (Howard v. County of San Diego (2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 1422, 1428.) MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES            UAC moves to compel NTS’s further responses to RPD Nos. 13, 14, 17, 19, 21, 22, 23, 25, 29, 30, 40, 41, and 44. A.   TimelinessMotions to compel further responses must be brought within 45 days of receiving the verified or supplemental verified responses, or as otherwise on or before “any specific later date” to which the parties have “agreed in writing.”  (CCP § 2031.310(c).)  The 45-day limitation to move to compel further responses as to interrogatories and document requests is jurisdictional, and courts are without authority to rule on untimely motions to compel except just to deny them.  (See, e.g., Sexton v. Superior Court (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410; and Sperber v. Robinson (1994) 26 Cal.App.4th 736, 746 [later motion did not relate back to earlier motion taken off calendar].)  The deadline cannot be circumvented by propounding the same discovery again.  (Prof. Career Colleges etc. v. Superior Court (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 490, 492.)As a preliminary matter, NTS argues that the motion was not timely filed. UAC propounded the RPDs on NTS on March 6, 2024.  (Lee Decl., Ex. A [RPD requests].)  NTS served verified response on March 6, 2024 and served supplemental responses on April 19, 2024.  (Lee Decl., Ex. G [NTS’s Supplemental Responses to the RPD].)  The parties agreed that the deadline to file a motion to compel further was May 3, 2024.  (Lee Decl., Ex. F [NTS’s counsel’s 4/11/24 Email], Ex. H [UAC’s counsel’s 4/24/24 Letter].)  UAC filed this motion on August 26, 2024.UAC argues that it timely filed the motion based on its Exhibits E, F, and G.  However, Exhibit E includes UAC’s counsel’s meet and confer letter dated April 24, 2024 acknowledging that the motion deadline was May 3, 2024; Exhibit F includes NTS’s counsel’s April 29, 2024 letter stating that NTS would be amenable to participating in an Informal Discovery Conference (“IDC”); and Exhibit G includes emails dated April 29, 2024 regarding the parties’ willingness to participate in an IDC.  None of these letters or emails provide a written agreement to extend the deadline for a motion to compel further to any specific later date, as required under CCP § 2031.310(c).)  In the reply brief, UAC argues that it has been gathering evidence of NTS’s discovery abuses such that there has been no delay to UAC’s filing of the motion.  However, in order to overcome the 45-day jurisdictional limitation, there must be an agreement by the parties in writing that the time to file the motion was extended.  UAC has not met this burden.NTS argues that the parties agreed to attend an IDC, but the parties did not agree to extend the deadline beyond May 3, 2024.  NTS states that the IDC did not occur and that UAC did not request an extension to file this motion. Based on the evidence provided by the parties, the motion was not timely filed.  UAC’s filing of the motion on August 26, 2024 is untimely as it is over 45 days from NTS’s service of the supplemental responses to the RPD.  The timely filing of the motion is jurisdictional.  Thus, the Court lacks authority to rule on an untimely motion to compel further responses except to deny the motion.  As such, UAC’s motion to compel further responses to the RPD is denied.The Court further notes that even if it were to consider the merits of the motion, it would deny the motion as UAC’s separate statement in support of the moving papers is based on NTS’s initial responses and does not discuss NTS’s supplemental responses.No sanctions were requested. PETITION FOR APPROVAL OF COMPROMISE OF MINOR            Petitioner/Plaintiff Deisi Martinez filed a petition for approval of minor’s compromise on behalf of minor Plaintiff Angela Savana Gonzalez. Attachment 10(c) of the petition states that the Plaintiffs have reached a settlement for $17.5 million with UAC ($14,550,000 settlement amount), Motion & Flow ($2,050,000), Nino ($350,000), JCC CP ($350,000), and Parker Hannafin ($200,000).  The settlement will be allocated as follows: (1) $250,000 for claimant/minor Angela Savana Gonzalez; (2) $250,000 for Fernando Avilez; (3) $8,500,000 for Jesus Siordia; and (4) $8,500,000 for Irene Fombona.             Minor Angela Savana Gonzalez did not receive any medical care/treatment and thus did not incur any medical expenses.   (Pet., §7.)  Minor has recovered completely from the effects of the injuries.  (Pet., §8.) The parties anticipate that $62,500 (25%) of the settlement funds to be paid towards attorney’s fees.  Plaintiffs’ counsel Thomas Schultz filed a declaration pursuant to CRC Rule 7.955, which is attached as Attachment 13a to the petition.  The Retainer Agreement is attached as Exhibit 1 to the petition.  Litigation costs were not requested. The net settlement amount to be paid to minor Angela Savana Gonzalez is $187,500 (= $250,000 settlement amount - $62,500 attorney’s fees).  Petitioner requests that the Court order the disposition of the balance of the proceeds of the settlement as follows: “$187,500 be invested in a single-premium deferred annuity, subject to withdrawal only on authorization of the court. The terms and conditions of the annuity are specified in Attachment 18b(3).”  (Pet., § 18(b)(3).)  A copy of the terms and conditions of the annuity for the minor’s proposed structured settlement is attached as Exhibit 2 to the petition.  The Court has reviewed the petition and finds the settlement fair and reasonable. The parties have an agreement for attorney’s fees, which is attached to the petition, the declaration of counsel is sufficient to substantiate the work done in connection with this matter, and the petition is properly verified by Petitioner.  The Court is therefore inclined to grant the petition.  Per CRC Rule 7.952, Petitioner and the Claimant are required to attend the hearing on the petition.  The Court will therefore require attendance at the hearing in order to grant the petition.MOTION TO CONTINUE TRIAL DATEUAC moves to continue the trial date.  The jury trial is currently set for November 12, 2024. UAC argues that there is good cause for a trial continuance under the CRC Rule 3.1332 factors.  UAC states that approximately 13,000 documents have been exchanged and approximately 21 depositions have taken place.  UAC believes that additional depositions are still necessary, including the depositions of NTS personnel (Michael Shook, Richard Sanchez, and Daniel Parker); Parker Hannifin personnel (Ronal Moner); Motion & Flow personnel (Eddie Malone, Luis Gonzalez, Javier Demences, and Alex Kiss); non-party Boeing personnel (Scott Renitz); non-party Anaheim Fire investigators (Roger Domen and Nick Colonelli); non-party Fullerton Police investigators (Detective Pedroza); and Fire Safety First personnel.  (Montanari Decl., ¶11.)  UAC states that there are 6 pending inspections, which include: (1) a fire inspection of the equipment that commenced on January 31, 2024, which the parties agreed would be conducted in 2 phases (a) taking CT scans and x-rays (completed) and (b) additional testing of components (pending); (2) a microscopic and SEM analysis of the equipment; (3) the teardown of the hydraulic pump motor and check valve; (4) a crimper machine, which was allegedly used to assemble fittings onto hydraulic hoses used on the equipment under test (anticipated to take place October 19, 2024); (5) the power generator NTS used for testing UAC's equipment; and (6) NTS's HVAC system.  (Id., ¶12.)  UAC anticipates expert designations and exchanges to be conducted shortly thereafter.  (Id., ¶13.)    UAC also argues that this is its first request for a continuance, Plaintiffs filed this action on September 28, 2022 such that it is only 2 years old and there are no issues with the 5-year rule, and there are no alternative means to address the issue of gathering evidence for the multiple parties and consolidated actions.  The Court also notes that no parties have opposed the motion and that there are 3 motions for summary judgment, an Order to Show Cause re: Status of Representation of Defendant Norton Sales, Inc., and a Status Conference re: Mediation Completion scheduled for after the currently scheduled Jury Trial date (November 12, 2024).Pursuant to CRC, Rule 3.1332, the Court finds that UAC has shown good cause for granting a continuance.  Therefore, the Motion to Continue Trial is granted. MOTION TO SEVER/BIFURCATEUAC moves to sever/bifurcate the trial pursuant to CCP §§ 597, 598, and 1048. In the reply brief, UAC states that no parties opposed the motion to continue the trial date and that if the Court grants the motion to continue the trial, then “UAC can withdraw its motion to sever/bifurcate and refile based upon the new trial date.”  (Mot. at p.2.)As the Court intends to grant the motion to continue the trial date (with all deadlines tied to the new trial date), the Court takes the motion to sever/bifurcate off-calendar based on UAC’s representation that it will refile the motion. CONCLUSION AND ORDERDefendant Motion & Flow Control Products, Inc.’s motion for leave to file the first amended answers is granted.  Defendant is ordered to electronically file separate copies of the first amended answers following the hearing on this matter.Defendant/Cross-Defendant United Aeronautical Corporation’s motion to compel Plaintiff-in-Intervention NTS Technical Systems, LLC’s further responses to Requests for Production of Documents is denied. The Court is inclined to grant Petitioner Deisi Martinez’s Petition for Approval of Compromise of Claim or Action or Disposition of Proceeds of Judgment for Minor/Claimant Angela Savana Gonzalez.  Per CRC Rule 7.952, Petitioner and the Claimant are required to attend the hearing on the petition.  The Court will therefore require attendance at the hearing in order to grant the petition.  Defendant/Cross-Defendant United Aeronautical Corporation’s motion to continue trial is granted.  The Jury Trial is continued to June 30, 2025, at 9:30 a.m. in this department.  The Final Status Conference is continued to June 18, 2025, at 8:30 a.m. in this department.  All discovery, motion, and expert cut-off dates will be tied to the new trial date.Defendant/Cross-Defendant United Aeronautical Corporation’s motion to sever and/or bifurcate the trial is taken off-calendar based on the moving party’s representation that it will refile the motion based on the continued trial date.Each moving party shall provide notice of their respective order.
