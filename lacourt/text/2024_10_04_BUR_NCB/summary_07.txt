And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving Mahnaz Sadanian, who alleges that she was sexually assaulted and battered by Dr. Roger C. Lai and his staff while she was a patient at Providence St. Joseph Medical Center. Sadanian's husband, Isaac Toveg, also alleges that he has suffered a loss of consortium as a result of his wife's injuries.

The defendants, Burbank Emergency Medical Group and Dr. Lai, have filed a demurrer to the second amended complaint, arguing that it fails to allege sufficient facts to support the claims. The judge agrees with the defendants that the complaint fails to allege any facts pertaining to Burbank EMG, and that the claims for professional negligence and sexual assault and battery are not sufficiently pleaded.

The judge has sustained the demurrer to the 1st and 2nd causes of action, but has given the plaintiff 20 days to amend the complaint. The judge has also allowed the plaintiff a final opportunity to amend the 2nd cause of action, which alleges sexual battery and assault.

The judge's ruling is tentative, meaning that it is subject to change after further consideration and argument at the hearing on October 4, 2024.
