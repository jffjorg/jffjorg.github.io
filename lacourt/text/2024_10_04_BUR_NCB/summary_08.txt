Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The plaintiff, Maksim Merzel, is seeking to compel the deposition of General Motors' (GM) person most knowledgeable (PMK) regarding the inspection of his 2021 Chevrolet Bolt. The inspection was performed on February 14, 2023, and GM's engineer confirmed the electrical shocks emanating from the vehicle. The plaintiff is seeking damages for the defects in the vehicle.

GM objects to the deposition, claiming that the inspection was performed under the direction of its counsel and that the documents related to the inspection are protected by the attorney-client privilege and attorney work product doctrine. The judge has granted the motion in part, allowing the deposition of GM's PMK, but has also denied some of the requests for production of documents.

The judge has ordered GM to produce documents in response to certain requests for production (RPDs), including RPDs 1-9 and 13-20, and has denied GM's objections to RPDs 4, 5, 7, and 19-20. The judge has also ordered GM to provide a privilege log to identify the documents that are claimed to be privileged.

The judge has denied the plaintiff's request for sanctions, finding that GM's opposition was substantially justified. The motion is granted in part, and the parties are ordered to meet and confer to agree on a deposition date within 60 days. If the parties are unable to agree, the plaintiff may unilaterally notice the deposition.
