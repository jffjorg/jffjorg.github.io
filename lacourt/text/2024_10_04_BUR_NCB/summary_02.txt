And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge regarding three motions to compel further responses to requests for production of documents from defendants WSRE Florida, LLC, WSRE Georgia, LLC, and WSRE South Carolina, LLC. The motions were filed by plaintiff Matthew Bondarczuk.

The case involves allegations of breach of fiduciary duty, conversion, fraud, negligence, and breach of written contract, among other claims. The plaintiffs allege that Isaac Blocher, the manager of Shepherds LLC, made false promises to induce investment into the company and that he invested nearly all of the plaintiffs' funds with Aneaka English, who subsequently stole the money.

The defendants have filed a cross-complaint alleging accounting, declaratory relief, and violation of Business & Professions Code, § 17200 et seq. The court has sustained the defendants' demurrer to the cross-complaint and dismissed it without prejudice.

On September 23, 2024, a bankruptcy petition was filed by defendants Isaac Blocher and Kristie Blocher, which operates as a stay in actions against the debtors. The motions to compel further responses will be continued to October 18, 2024, to be heard concurrently with the plaintiffs' motion for terminating sanctions.
