If the recovery of money or damages is demanded, the amount demanded shall be stated.(b) Notwithstanding subdivision (a), where an action is brought to recover actual or punitive damages for personal injury or wrongful death, the amount demanded shall not be stated, but the complaint shall comply with Section 422.30 and, in a limited civil case, with subdivision (b) of Section 70613 of the Government Code.(CCP § 425.10.)  “Section 425.10, subdivision (b) prohibits a personal injury plaintiff from stating in the complaint the amount of damages claimed in order to protect defendants in these actions from adverse publicity resulting from inflated damage claims.”  (Barragan v. Banco BCH (1986) 188 Cal.App.3d 283, 303; see also Austin v. Regents of University of California (1979) 89 Cal.App.3d 354, 359 [“Under subdivision (b) of section 425.10 of the Code of Civil Procedure, no dollar amount of damages may be stated in an action for personal injuries.”].)             In the 3rd cause of action, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant owed Plaintiff (a minor) a duty of care to refrain from causing her harm or injuries, but Defendant breached that duty by touching her breasts and private parts.  (Compl., ¶¶42-45.)  Plaintiff alleges that as a result of Defendant’s negligence, she has been damaged in an amount to be determined at trial, but no less than $1,000,000.00.  (Id., ¶47.) The 3rd cause of action for negligence alleges a statement of damages.  While Plaintiff claims her allegations is merely a “range” and that damages will be determined at trial, she has nonetheless alleged a minimum claim of damages for a personal injury cause of action, which is improper.  The purpose of section 425.10 is to protect defendants in personal injury actions from adverse publicity resulting from prayers in complaints for greatly inflated damage claims bearing little relation to reasonable expectations of recovery.  (Plotitsa v. Superior Court (1983) 140 Cal.App.3d 755, 771.)  As such, the motion to strike is granted with leave to amend.In the reply brief, Defendant states that he has no objection to Plaintiff amending her complaint, but requests that the original complaint be sealed.  The request to seal the initial complaint was not properly made by way of a separate motion and, thus, will be denied. CONCLUSION AND ORDERDefendant Arthur Wuthong Shi’s motion to strike portions of the complaint in the 3rd cause of action for negligence is granted with 20 days leave to amend. Defendant shall provide notice of this order.
