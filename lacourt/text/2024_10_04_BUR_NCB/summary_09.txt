And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer and motion to strike filed by the defendants (Hayk Tarkhanyan, Yourcellparts.com, and Aeonz Electronics) in the case brought by the plaintiffs (Jose Guzman Jr., Maria Carmen Guzman, Jose Guzman Sr., and Tony Pineda).

The court has sustained the demurrer to the 1st and 3rd causes of action (negligence and premises liability) due to the lack of allegations regarding the relationship between Tarkhanyan and the defendants, and the failure to allege facts showing that Tarkhanyan's third-party criminal actions were reasonably foreseeable.

The court has also sustained the demurrer to the 2nd cause of action (intentional tort) due to the insufficient allegations of the cause of action, which do not clearly state what particular cause of action the plaintiffs are attempting to allege.

The court has granted the defendants 20 days' leave to amend the complaint.

The motion to strike the references to exemplary and/or punitive damages from the complaint is taken off-calendar as moot.

The defendants are ordered to provide notice of this order.
