And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel further responses to requests for admissions (RFAs) filed by Plaintiff Michael Green. The dispute centers around Defendant Royal Garden Apartments Inc.'s incomplete responses to RFAs Nos. 1-39, 41-59, and 61-71.

The court finds that Defendant's responses to RFAs Nos. 1-35 are not deficient and therefore denies the motion as to those requests. However, the court grants the motion with respect to RFAs Nos. 36-39, 41-59, and 61-71, finding that Defendant's responses were incomplete and did not comply with California Code of Civil Procedure Section 2033.220.

The court orders Defendant to provide further responses to those RFAs within 20 days of notice of this order. The court also declines to award sanctions to either party, finding that the outcome of the motion is sufficient to address the discovery dispute.

The court notes that the parties should make good faith efforts to resolve their discovery disputes and that the filing of additional discovery motions is stayed until further court order.
