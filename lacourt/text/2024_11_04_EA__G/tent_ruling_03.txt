 Case Number:  24PSCV00719    Hearing Date:   November 4, 2024    Dept:  G Defendants Signature  Healthcare Services, LLC and Aurora Charter Oak – Los Angeles, LLC’s Demurrer  to Plaintiff’s Second Amended Complaint Respondent: Plaintiff Lori  Keele TENTATIVE RULING Defendants Signature  Healthcare Services, LLC and Aurora Charter Oak – Los Angeles, LLC’s Demurrer  to Plaintiff’s Second Amended Complaint is OVERRULED. Defendants Signature  Healthcare Services, LLC and Aurora Charter Oak – Los Angeles, LLC are ordered  to answer Plaintiff’s Second Amended Complaint in ten (10) days. BACKGROUND This  a personal injury action arising from injuries sustained at a psychiatric  hospital. From March 9, 2023, to March 13, 2023, Plaintiff Lori Keele was  admitted to and received care at a psychiatric hospital operated by Defendants Signature  Healthcare Services, LLC (Signature) and Aurora Charter Oak – Los Angeles, LLC  (Aurora). During this time, Keele alleges staff sedated Keele without Keele’s  consent. Keele also alleges staff used force to restrain Keele which resulted  in Keele suffering a concussion and broken nose. On  March 8, 2024, Keele filed a complaint against Signature, Aurora, and Does  1-100, alleging the following causes of action: (1) medical malpractice, (2)  assault, and (3) battery.On  July 29, 2024, Keele filed a First Amended Complaint (FAC) against the same  defendants alleging the same causes of action. On September 5, 2024, the court  sustained Signature and Aurora’s demurrer to the FAC with leave to amend. On  September 25, 2024, Keele filed a Second Amended Complaint (SAC) against  Signature; Aurora; Emily Ackerman, M.D.; and Does 2-100, alleging the same  causes of action. On October  1, 2024, Signature and Aurora filed the present demurrer. Prior to filing, Signature  and Aurora’s counsel attempted to met and confer telephonically with Keele’s  counsel. (Charles Decl., ¶ 5.) A hearing  on the demurrer is set for November 4, 2024, along with a case management  conference. REQUEST FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE Signature  and Aurora request the court take judicial notice of a reporter transcript from  the hearing on their previous demurrer. The court GRANTS their request pursuant to  Evidence Code section 452, subdivision (d). (See Miller v. Superior Court (2002)  101 Cal.App.4th 728, 734, fn. 2.) ANALYSIS Signature  and Aurora demur to Keele’s entire SAC on the grounds that they are immune from  liability pursuant to Welfare and Institutions Code section 5278. For the  following reasons, the court OVERRULES their demurrer. Legal Standard Demurrer A  party may demur to a complaint on the grounds that it “does not state facts  sufficient to constitute a cause of action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd.  (e).) A demurrer tests whether the complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn  v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747 (Hahn).) When considering  demurrers, courts accept all well pleaded facts as true. (Fox v. JAMDAT  Mobile, Inc. (2010) 185 Cal.App.4th 1068, 1078.) In a demurrer proceeding,  the defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial  notice. (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968,  994.) “A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other  extrinsic matters. Therefore, it lies only where the defects appear on the face  of the pleading or are judicially noticed.” (SKF Farms v. Superior Court  (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 902, 905.) “The only issue involved in a demurrer hearing  is whether the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous matters,  states a cause of action.” (Hahn, supra, at p. 747.) Section 5278 Immunity Pursuant  to Welfare and Institutions Code section 5278, “[i]ndividuals authorized under  this part to detain a person for 72-hour treatment and evaluation pursuant to  Article 1 (commencing with Section 5150) or Article 2 (commencing with Section  5200), or to certify a person for intensive treatment pursuant to Article 4  (commencing with Section 5250) or Article 4.5 (commencing with Section 5260)  or Article 4.7 (commencing with Section 5270.10) or to file a petition  for post-certification treatment for a person pursuant to Article 6 (commencing  with Section 5300) shall not be held either criminally or civilly liable for  exercising this authority in accordance with the law.” “The  protected conduct is confined to the exercise of statutory authority to  detain, evaluate and treat against the patient’s wishes, and does not extend to  the manner in which evaluation and treatment are carried out. In other  words, liability arising from negligent evaluation or treatment is not  liability arising from the ‘exercis[e of] this authority in accordance with the  law.’” (Gonzalez v. Paradise Valley Hospital (2003) 111 Cal.App.4th 735,  741-742 (Gonzalez), quoting Welf. & Inst. Code, § 5278.) “Thus,  immunity under section 5278 does not extend to ‘negligent acts, intentional  torts, or criminal wrongs committed during the course of the detention,  evaluation, or treatment.’” (Julian v. Mission Community Hospital (2017)  11 Cal.App.5th 360, 393, quoting Gonzalez, supra, 111 Cal.App.4th  at p. 742 (Julian).) Discussion In  previously sustaining Signature and Aurora’s demurrer to the FAC, the court  found the FAC failed to allege any acts of negligence or intentional torts that  occurred aside from the decision by Signature and Aurora to detain and forcibly  medicate Keele without Keele’s consent. (09/05/2024 Ruling, p. 2.) The SAC adds  additional allegations. First,  the SAC alleges Signature and Aurora placed Keele on an involuntary hold  without probable cause. (SAC, ¶ 19(e).) A person may be placed on a 72-hour  involuntary hold pursuant to Welfare and Institutions Code section 5150 when  certain individuals, including the attending staff of a county-designated evaluation  and treatment facility, have probable cause to believe the person “as a result  of a mental health disorder, is a danger to others, or to themselves, or  gravely disabled.” (Welf. & Inst. Code, § 5150, subd. (a).) As a result,  immunity only applies when such probable cause exists. (See Jacobs v.  Grossmont Hospital (2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 69, 76 [“[T]he immunity of  section 5278 necessarily applies to individuals or entities who make the  decision to detain, when that decision is supported by probable cause.”].) Here,  the SAC alleges Keele was initially admitted to Signature and Aurora’s facility  on a voluntary basis on March 9, 2023, at 2:35 PM. (SAC, ¶ 18.) At the time of  admission, Keele expressed suicidal ideations, stating Keele “wanted to die.”  (SAC, ¶ 19(e).) On March 10, 2023, at 11:40 AM, the SAC alleges Signature and  Aurora’s staff converted Keele to an involuntary admission after Keele refused  to take medication. (SAC, ¶ 19.) Signature and Aurora’s involuntary hold was  also based on Keele’s suicidal ideations. (SAC, ¶ 19(e), Ex. C.) While the SAC  acknowledges Keele stated Keele wanted to die when Keele was voluntarily  admitted on March 9, the SAC alleges there was no change in Keele’s condition  or diagnosis that supported probable cause for involuntary commitment on March  10. (SAC, ¶ 19(e).) Instead, the SAC alleges that the involuntary commitment  was imposed as retaliation for Keele refusing medication that the SAC alleges  was unnecessary. (SAC, ¶ 19(e).) By  alleging there was no change in Keele’s condition that supported a change from  Keele’s earlier voluntary admission, the court   finds the SAC adequately alleges facts to support the allegation that  Signature and Aurora lacked probable cause to place Keele on a 72-hour hold. To  the extent Signature and Aurora may argue Keele’s refusal to take medications  itself was probable cause, the SAC alleges the medications were unnecessary.  (SAC, ¶ 17, 19.) Further,  because the  SAC adequately alleges Signature and Aurora lacked probable cause to place  Keele on an involuntary hold in the first place, the court finds that also then  precluded Signature and Aurora from forcibly medicating and sedating Keele  without Keele’s consent. Thus, based on the SAC’s allegations, the actions of  Signature and Aurora’s staff are not immunized by Welfare and Institutions Code  section 5278. As  an alternative basis for their demurrer, Signature and Aurora also argue the  second cause of action for assault and third cause of action for battery fail because  they inadequately allege vicarious liability or ratification. (Demurrer, p.  14:20-15:18.) An  employer is vicariously liable for the torts of its employees when committed  “in the scope of employment.” (Diaz v. Carcamo (2011) 51 Cal.4th 1148,  1154.) Here, the SAC adequately alleges a basis for such liability as the  allegations of battery and assault arise from Signature and Aurora’s staff  attempting to forcibly restrain and medicate Keele. Thus, the court finds this  alternative ground for demurrer also fails. Accordingly,  the court OVERRULES Signature and Aurora’s demurrer. CONCLUSION Based on the foregoing, Signature  and Aurora’s demurrer to Keele’s SAC is OVERRULED. Defendants Signature and  Aurora are ordered to answer the SAC in ten (10) days.
