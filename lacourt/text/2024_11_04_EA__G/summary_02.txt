And here is the English summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has reviewed Ao Bai's motion for leave to file a First Amended Complaint (FAC) adding a cause of action for breach of mandatory duty against the City. The court continues the hearing on the motion to allow Ao Bai's counsel to file a revised declaration that complies with California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1324, subdivision (b). The original declaration lacked the required language and failed to adequately address the factors required by the rule. The court continues the motion to allow Ao Bai's counsel to provide a revised declaration that meets the requirements of the rule. The hearing is set for a date to be determined at the hearing set in Department G (Pomona), along with a case management conference/status conference re: ADR/status of Defendant Hon Giang.
