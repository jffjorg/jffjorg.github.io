 Case Number:  23PSCV03536    Hearing Date:   November 4, 2024    Dept:  G Plaintiff Ao Bai’s Motion for Leave to File Amended  Complaint Respondent: NO OPPOSITION TENTATIVE RULING Plaintiff Ao Bai’s Motion for Leave to File Amended  Complaint is CONTINUED to a date to be determined at the hearing set in  Department G (Pomona). A supplemental briefing schedule will be set at the  hearing. BACKGROUND This  is a premises liability and wrongful death action. In April 2023, Lin Bai resided  at a property in La Puente allegedly owned by Defendants Thanh Hon Giang, Khanh  My Giang, and the Hon Giang Family Trust (the Giang Trust). On April 8, 2023,  Lin Bai died in a fire that broke out at the La Puente property due to  allegedly faulty electrical wiring. The La Puente property also allegedly lacked  functioning smoke alarms, fire suppression systems, and fire extinguishers. On November  13, 2023, Plaintiff Ao Bai, individually and as successor-in-interest to Lin  Bai, filed a complaint against the Giangs, the Giang Trust, and Does 1-50,  alleging (1) premises liability, (2) general negligence, and (3) wrongful  death. On  December 1, 2023, Ao Bai amended the Complaint to replace Doe 1 with Defendant  Ronn Giang. On March 20, 2024, Ao Bai amended the Complaint to replace Doe 2  with Defendant Hon Giang and Doe 3 with Defendant City of La Puente (the City). On  April 2, 2024, Ao Bai dismissed the City from the present action. On April 12,  2024, Ao Bai dismissed Khanh My Giang from the present action. On April 15,  2024, Ao Bai dismissed Thanh Hon Giang from the present action. On  July 29, 2024, Ao Bai amended the Complaint to replace Doe 4, erroneously named  “Doe 3,” with Defendant Richard Bash and Doe 5, erroneously named “Doe 4,” with  Defendant Masters Realty Services Inc. (Masters Realty), doing business as  Century 21 Masters. On  August 12, 2024, Ao Bai dismissed Bash and Masters Realty from the present  action. On  September 23, 2024, Ao Bai amended the Complaint to replace Doe 6, erroneously  named “Doe 5,” with Defendant Carlos Arturo Santibanez. On October 1, 2024, Ao  Bai amended the Complaint to replace Doe 7, erroneously named “Doe 6,” with the  City. On October  9, 2024, Ao Bai filed the present motion. A hearing on the motion is set for November  4, 2024, along with a case management conference/status conference re:  ADR/status of Defendant Hon Giang. ANALYSIS Ao  Bai seeks leave to file a First Amended Complaint (FAC) that adds a cause of  action for breach of mandatory duty against the City. For the following  reasons, the court CONTINUES Ao Bai’s motion. Legal  Standard “A  court may, in furtherance of justice, and on any terms as may be proper, allow  a party to amend any pleading.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (a)(1).) The  court’s discretion will usually be exercised liberally to permit amendments of  the pleadings. (Nestle v. City of Santa Monica (1972) 6 Cal.3d 920,  939.) “A motion to amend a pleading before trial must . . . [s]tate what allegations in the  previous pleading are proposed to be deleted, if any, and where, by page,  paragraph, and line number, the deleted allegations are located; and [s]tate what allegations are  proposed to be added to the previous pleading, if any, and where, by page,  paragraph, and line number, the additional allegations are located.”  (Cal.  Rules of Court, rule 3.1324(a).)  The declaration must also specify the  amendment’s effect, why it is necessary and proper, when the facts supporting  the amended allegations were discovered, and why the request was not made  earlier.  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1324(b).) If  the party seeking the amendment has needlessly delayed, and the delay has  prejudiced the opposing party, the court has the discretion to deny leave to  amend.  (See Hirsa v. Superior Court (1981) 118 Cal.App.3d 486, 490.)  Prejudice exists where the amendment would require delaying the trial,  resulting in loss of critical evidence, or added costs of preparation.  (Solit v. Tokai Bank, Ltd. New  York Branch (1999) 68 Cal.App.4th 1435, 1448.) Discussion In  this case, Ao Bao’s counsel failed to submit a proper declaration in support of  the present motion as required by California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1324,  subdivision (b).  Although Ao Bao’s  counsel did submit a declaration, it lacks the language required in Code of  Civil Procedure section 2015.5. And  even if counsel’s declaration was in proper form, it also fails to adequately  address the factors required in Rule 3.1324, subdivision (b) of the California  Rules of Court. While it generally states Ao Bai “wishes to file the FAC so that she may properly allege  the factual basis which underlie her Claims against the CITY,” it fails to  specifically state (1) the effect of the amendment and (2) why the amendment is  necessary and proper. And while it claims the connection between the creation of  a sink-room and the City’s permit became clear following investigation and  expert analysis in November 2023, it fails to state what became clear, when  it became clear, and why the request for amendment was not made  earlier. Accordingly, the court CONTINUES  the hearing on Ao Bai’s motion in order for counsel to file a  code-compliant declaration that adequately addresses the factors required in Rule 3.1324, subdivision (b) of the California Rules of  Court. CONCLUSION Based on the foregoing, Ao Bai’s motion for leave  to file a FAC is CONTINUED to a date to be determined at the hearing set in  Department G (Pomona). A supplemental briefing schedule will be set at the  hearing.
