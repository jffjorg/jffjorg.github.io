Summary:

The judge's tentative ruling is that the defendant's demurrer to the second amended complaint is overruled as to the first cause of action for declaratory relief, but sustained as to the second cause of action for unjust enrichment without leave to amend. The court finds that the plaintiff has a valid claim for declaratory relief as she has set forth facts showing the existence of an actual controversy relating to the rights and duties of the respective parties. The court also finds that the Moore/Marsden line of cases may support the plaintiff's alleged reimbursement rights to the property via equitable lien. The defendant's motion to strike certain allegations from the second amended complaint is denied in full.
