And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge is denying the plaintiff's petition to enter a foreign-country judgment because the plaintiff failed to file a proof of service and necessary dispositive motion. The plaintiff filed a complaint for entry of a California Court Judgment on August 4, 2023, alleging that the Higher People's Court of Jiangsu Province in China entered a judgment against defendants Suzhou Dingi and Shanghai Dingjin, and that defendant Ling has joint liability for satisfaction of the judgment. The plaintiff is seeking to enforce the foreign-country judgment, which grants or denies recovery of a sum of money, and is final, conclusive, and enforceable under the law of the foreign country. However, the judge finds that the plaintiff's failure to follow the proper procedure for recognition of a foreign-country judgment, as outlined in the Uniform Foreign-Country Judgments Recognition Act and the Code of Civil Procedure, requires the denial of the petition.
