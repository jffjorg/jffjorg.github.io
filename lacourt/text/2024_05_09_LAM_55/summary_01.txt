And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by Santa Clarita Electrical, Inc. (SCEI) to the First Amended Cross-Complaint (FACC) filed by Alliance Building Solutions (Alliance). The Court has overruled the demurrer, finding that the FACC adequately pleads the essential elements of the cause of action. The Court also rejected SCEI's argument that the FACC fails to allege specific contract provisions breached and did not require specific allegations of performance of contract conditions. The Court found that the FACC sufficiently alleges the facts constituting a breach of contract and that the parties have mechanisms for discovery to clarify any uncertainties. The Court ordered SCEI to answer the FACC within 15 days.
