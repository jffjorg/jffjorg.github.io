And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling addresses two motions: one to compel further responses to requests for production and another to compel further responses to requests for admission. Plaintiff Jonathan Botach seeks to compel Defendant Ateret DiVeroli to provide additional information in response to 52 requests for production and 48 requests for admission. The court finds that defendant's objections to these requests are valid, with the exception of requests for admission Nos. 1, 2, 4, 5, 7-9, 12-26, 28, and 29, which will be granted in part. The court also finds that defendant's responses to requests for admission were evasive and orders defendant to serve further verified responses without objections to these requests. Additionally, the court imposes $2,600 in sanctions against plaintiff for unreasonably opposing the motion to compel further responses to requests for production.
