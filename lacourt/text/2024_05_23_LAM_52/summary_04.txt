And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has granted the plaintiff's motion to deem the truth of specified matters and the genuineness of documents admitted as to defendant Metro Investments Group, Inc. and defendant Anthony Nowaid. The court has also ordered the defendants to pay sanctions of $750 to Metro and $625 to Anthony Nowaid within 30 days. The court's ruling is based on the plaintiff's failure to respond to requests for admission, which waived any objections and necessitated the motion to deem the matters and documents admitted.
