And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled on a demurrer filed by Rusnak Pasadena dba Rusnak Volvo Cars, challenging the complaint filed by Valarie B. Phillips. The judge has sustained the demurrer with leave to amend, meaning that Phillips has 20 days to revise her complaint to address the issues raised by Rusnak. The judge has also denied Rusnak's motion to strike as moot, since there will be no operative pleading from which to strike anything. The judge has found that the complaint fails to state a cause of action due to uncertainty and lack of clarity regarding the alleged contract between the parties. The judge has also ruled that the elements of a negligence claim are not adequately alleged and that the demurrer is sustained as to all causes of action asserted against Rusnak.
