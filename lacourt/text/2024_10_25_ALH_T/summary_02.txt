And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for attorney fees, ruling that the defendant had reasonable grounds to believe he would prevail at trial on the issues covered by the subject requests for admission. The judge found that the defendant reasonably relied on the testimony of his expert witness, Dr. Gregory Lercel, in establishing a good faith belief he would prevail at trial. The judge also noted that the plaintiff's motion tacitly acknowledged that the defendant had a legitimate evidentiary basis to believe he would prevail, and that the plaintiff had to overcome the opinions of the defendant's expert witness and the fact that the defendant was not always at fault in the case. As a result, the judge denied the plaintiff's motion for attorney fees, finding that the defendant did not have reasonable grounds to believe he would prevail and therefore should not be ordered to pay the expenses incurred by the plaintiff in proving the matters.
