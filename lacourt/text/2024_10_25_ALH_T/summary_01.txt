And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to enforce the settlement agreement, which requires the plaintiff to provide a complete and signed CMS Affidavit. The plaintiff had signed the settlement agreement on March 4, 2024, in which he agreed to provide an executed copy of the CMS Affidavit. However, the plaintiff returned an incomplete CMS Affidavit and refused to provide the requested information, citing that it was "private and confidential." The judge found that this failure to provide a complete CMS Affidavit was a material term of the settlement agreement and therefore the plaintiff's motion to enforce the settlement agreement was denied. The judge also granted the defendant's request for attorney fees and costs in the amount of $1,685.

The judge noted that the parties had stipulated to the court's jurisdiction to enforce the settlement agreement and that the agreement could only be reasonably interpreted as obligating the plaintiff to provide a completed Affidavit. The judge also mentioned that the completed CMS Affidavit was necessary for the defendants to comply with mandatory reporting requirements under the Medicare, Medicaid and SCHIP Extension Act of 2007.
