  Case Number:  21SMCV00574    Hearing Date:   November 15, 2023    Dept:  P Tentative Ruling 
Estevez v. General
Motors, LLC, Case No. 21SMCV00574
Hearing Date November
15, 2023 
Plaintiff
Estevez’s Motion for Attorney Fees (taken under submission 10/5/2023)
Defendant General
Motors Motion to Tax Costs 
 
As part of the
settlement of this lemon law matter, defendant agreed to pay attorney’s fees
and costs. On October 5, 2023 the court’s tentative order granted the fees motion
but disallowed certain items, which defense counsel argued were incorrectly
calculated. The court recalculates and amends its tentative ruling.
 
Estevez’s exhibit
22 (itemization of hours and fees) indicates attorney Gonzalez spent 10 hours
total on April 22, 27 and 29, 2021 drafting discovery requests at $300/hour. To
reflect a reasonable amount of time saved through counsel’s use of templates, the
time will be reduced from ten to four hours, a reduction of $1,800 (6 x 300). See
Cohen declaration, exhibit 22, pgs. 2-3. 
 
Exhibit 22
indicates Gonzales spent 5.1 hours drafting meet and confer letters. Exhibit 22,
pgs. 6-8, 18-19. 4.7 hours were billed at $325/hour, totaling $1,527.5, with .4
hours billed at $400/hour, totaling $160. Id., resulting in an average
billing rate of $330.88. 5.1 hours is excessive for these tasks, since the
letters were substantially similar to letters used in prior cases. The time
will be reduced by three hours billed at the average rate, for a reduction of $992.65
(3 x 330.88).
 
Exhibit 22
indicates Gonzalez spent 5.9 hours (August 30, 2022) preparing deposition
subpoenas and notices of deposition, .7 hours (September 2, 2022) reviewing and
editing the notices and 2 hours on (October 6, 2022) reviewing objections to
the subpoenas, billed at $400/hour. To reflect time saved by relying on
existing work product, and noting that 8.4 hours to prepare deposition notices
is not warranted, this is reduced by six hours or $2,400 (6 x 400).
 
Exhibit 22
indicates Gonzalez spent 5.9 hours (August 30, 2022) drafting deposition
subpoenas and .7 hours (September 2, 2022) editing those subpoenas at $400/hour.
Drafting subpoenas is not a complicated task. The amount of time spent is
excessive, and will be reduced by three hours, a reduction of $1,200 (3 x 400).

 
Exhibit 22
indicates Gonzalez spent 11 hours (January 30 and February 7, 2023) reviewing
supplemental discovery responses. Although the production was substantial,
Gonzalez is experienced in Song-Beverly cases and knew what materials she was
looking for within the production. 11 hours is more time than reasonably necessary
to review the production. The fees will be reduced by six hours, for a
reduction of $2,400. 
 
Exhibit 22 indicates
Gonzalez spent 5.3 hours at $300/hour (May 28, 2021) drafting discovery
responses. The amount will be reduced by 3 hours, or $900 (3 x 300). 
 
Finally, to
reflect time saved through the use of prior work product, the court will reduce
the time Gonzalez spent (February 7, 8 and March 1, 2023) drafting and revising
a motion to compel by four hours. Gonzalez billed at $400/hour, for a further
reduction of $1,600 (4 x 400). 
 
The other
requested fees and costs are reasonable and supported by billing records and
the nature of the tasks performed. The court reduces the requested fees from $74,525.50
by $11,292.65, for a fee award of $63,232.85. 
 
Motion to Tax
Costs 
If requested costs
appear proper on their face, a verified memorandum of costs is prima facie evidence
of their propriety, and the objecting party has the burden of them Ladas v.
California State Auto Ass’n. (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 751, 774-776
 
Estevez requests
$8,274.35 in costs. GM moves to tax $5,156.40, representing jury fees, mediation
fees, fees incurred serving non-party deposition notices and transcript fees
for those depositions, arguing they reflect unnecessary litigation activity
that did not contribute to the settlement of the case. 
 
The court disagrees
that third-party deposition fees were unreasonable and unrecoverable. Estevez alleges
he brought the vehicle to an authorized facility for repairs several times, but
the defects were not fixed. It was reasonable to depose third-party employees
at those facilities to corroborate these allegations. Although the case did not
go to trial, it was not unreasonable for Estevez to post jury fees. Finally, mediation
costs are not unreasonable. Estevez withdrew his request for $525 in court
reporter fees for a motion to compel further that never went forward.
 
Estevez is awarded
$7,749.35 in costs, representing $8,274.35 minus the withdrawn $525 in court
reporter fees.
