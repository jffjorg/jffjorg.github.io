ANALYSIS: 
 
Petitioner Silver
Star Construction Engineering, Inc. (“Petitioner”) filed the instant verified
Petition to Release Property from Lien against Respondent Frontline Fire
Protection (“Respondent”) on December 11, 2023. No response to the Petition has
been filed to date. 
 
Discussion
 
Petitioner moves to have the mechanic’s lien recorded
against its property by Respondent released. The Petition is brought pursuant
to Civil Code section 8480, which provides that the owner of the property may
petition the court for an order to release the property from the claim of lien
if the claimant has not commenced an action to enforce the lien within the time
provided in section 8460. (Civil Code, § 8480, subd. (a).)  
 
Section 8460 provides that “[t]he claimant shall commence an
action to enforce a lien within 90 days after recordation of the claim of
lien.” (Civil Code, § 8460, subd. (a).) Section 8460 further provides that
“[i]f the claimant does not commence an action to enforce the lien within that
time, the claim of lien expires and is unenforceable.” (Civil Code, § 8460,
subd. (a).) Section 8460 also provides that the 90-day time limit to commence
an action to enforce a lien does not apply if there was an agreement to extend
credit and a notice of that fact was recorded within 90 days after recordation
of the claim of lien or more than 90 days after recordation of the claim of
lien but before a purchaser or encumbrancer for value and in good faith
acquires rights in the property.  (Civil
Code, § 8460, subd. (b).)  
 
A property owner may not petition for a release order until
he or she gives the claimant notice demanding that the claimant execute and
record a release of lien claim at least ten days before filing the petition.
(Civil Code, § 8482.) Civil Code section 8484 requires that the petition for
release order be verified by the petitioner and allege the following:
 
(a) The date of recordation of the
claim of lien. A certified copy of the claim of lien shall be attached to the
petition.
(b) The county in which the claim of
lien is recorded.
(c) The book and page or series number
of the place in the official records where the claim of lien is recorded.
(d) The legal description of the
property subject to the claim of lien.
(e) Whether an extension of credit has
been granted under Section 8460, if so to what date, and that the time for
commencement of an action to enforce the lien has expired.
(f) That the owner has given the
claimant notice under Section 8482 demanding that the claimant execute and
record a release of the lien and that the claimant is unable or unwilling to do
so or cannot with reasonable diligence be found.
(g) Whether an action to enforce the
lien is pending.
(h) Whether the owner of the property
or interest in the property has filed for relief in bankruptcy or there is
another restraint that prevents the claimant from commencing an action to
enforce the lien.
 
(Civil Code, § 8484.) Regarding the merits, Petitioner has
satisfied the requirements of Civil Code sections 8482 and 8484. (Pet., ¶¶1-10
and Exhs. A-B.) Furthermore, there is no indication that an action to enforce
the lien has been commenced and the 90-day time period to commence an action
has now expired. (Ibid.)
 
Civil Code section 8486, subdivision (b) requires service of
the Petition and notice of hearing to “be made in the same manner as service of
summons, or by certified or registered mail, postage prepaid, return receipt
requested . . . .” (Civ. Code, § 8486, subd. (b).) Petitioner filed proof of
service of the Petition and the Notice of the Hearing Date by certified mail
with return receipt requested. (Proof of Personal Service, filed 12/22/23.)
This conforms to the statutory requirements for service. 
 
Finally, Petitioner requests attorney’s fees and costs
pursuant to Civil Code section 8488, subdivision (c). (Pet., ¶10.) Petitioner
incurred fees of $3,590.00 based on five hours of attorney time billed at
$625.00 per hour, and 1.5 hours of attorney time billed at $465.00 per hour.
(Pet., Lubka Decl., ¶4.) These reasonable fees are awarded to Petitioner.

Construction Engineering, Inc.’s Petition to Release Property from Mechanic’s
Lien is GRANTED. PETITIONER IS FURTHER AWARDED ATTORNEY’S FEES AND COSTS OF
$3,950.00. THE PROPOSED ORDER FILED ON DECEMBER 13, 2023 IS SIGNED AND ENTERED
