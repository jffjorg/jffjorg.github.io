 Case Number:  22STCV19201    Hearing Date:   October 4, 2023    Dept:  17 Superior Court of California County of Los Angeles   DEPARTMENT  17   TENTATIVE RULING      MAHMUD REZA SIAMIZADE                vs.   STEVEN MEIER, et al.       Case    No.:  22STCV19201          Hearing Date: October 4, 2023      Plaintiff’s  motion to compel further is DENIED. Plaintiff is sanctioned $700.00.   On 6/13/2022,  Plaintiff Mahmud Reza Siamizade (Plaintiff) filed suit against Steven Meier, LA  Peer Surgery Center, Gholamreza Siamizade, and Masoumeh Siamizade. On 6/20/023,  Plaintiff filed a third amended complaint (TAC) alleging: (1) professional  negligence—wrongful death; and (2) fraud.    Now,  Plaintiff moves to compel further responses from Defendant LA Peer (Defendant)  to Special Interrogatories (Sets Two and Three).    Discussion   The discovery  at issue was propounded by Plaintiff on Defendant on 5/23/2023 and 6/4/2023,  respectively.    As a  preliminary matter, the Court requires an IDC before a motion to compel further  is heard on the merits.    Second, Plaintiff’s  motion is procedurally and substantively defective. Plaintiff has not submitted  a separate statement for this motion nor has he provided any factual or legal  reasons for compelling further responses. (California Rules of Court Rule  3.1345(a)(2).)               The  Court finds sanctions against Plaintiff to be warranted. Plaintiff never  contacted Defendant to have a telephonic meet and confer discussion regarding  Defendant’s objections and responses to his discovery prior to filing his  Motion. Not only is such meet-and-confer required, but it could have led to  this procedurally defective motion being withdrawn without the need for a  hearing.    Based on the  foregoing, Plaintiff’s motion to compel further is denied. Plaintiff is  sanctioned $700.00. ($350/hr x 2 hr.)       It is so ordered.    Dated:  October     , 2023                                                                                                                                                                Hon.
