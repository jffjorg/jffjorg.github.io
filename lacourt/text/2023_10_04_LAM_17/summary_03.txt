Here is a summary in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling denying the Parkers' motion for reconsideration of the Court's previous rulings. The Parkers sought reconsideration based on new case law concerning the statute of limitations and lack of opportunity to respond to arguments and evidence. The Court finds that the new case law, FERC v. Vitol, has no persuasive application to the facts of this case. The Court also finds that the CDE did not improperly raise any argument for the first time in reply and that the Parkers failed to present new facts or law. The Court denies the Parkers' motion for reconsideration.
