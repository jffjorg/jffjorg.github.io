**English Summary:**

This tentative ruling denies the Parkers' motion to reconsider the Court's previous rulings in favor of the California Department of Education (CDE). 

The Parkers argued that the statute of limitations for CDE's breach of contract claim should be longer than the Court previously determined. They cited a recent federal case, FERC v. Vitol, for support.  However, the Court found FERC v. Vitol to be inapplicable because it involved a different legal issue and facts.  

The Parkers also argued that they were not given an opportunity to respond to new arguments raised by CDE in its reply brief. The Court disagreed, stating that CDE's arguments were responsive to the Parkers' own arguments raised in their opposition.


In conclusion, the Court found no basis to reconsider its earlier rulings and denied the Parkers' motion.

* The Court finds an insufficient basis to conclude that the CDE improperly raised any argument for the first time in reply, or that there were arguments or evidence presented there which the CDE was deprived an opportunity to respond to.

- The Parkers: moved for reconsideration of the Court's rulings
significant\_statements:
- The Parkers' motion for reconsideration is denied
- The Parkers are not entitled to reconsideration of the Court's rulings based on new case law or because they did not have an opportunity to address or respond to arguments and evidence that CDE first made in its reply briefing
- The Parkers' seek reconsideration based on a Ninth Circuit decision, FERC v. Vitol, which is not binding on this Court and not persuasive authority because the relevant statute of limitations analysis here turns on CCP section 337, a state statute, whereas the analysis in FERC v. Vitol turned on the interplay between the Federal Power Act and 28 U.S.C. section 2462
- The Parkers argue that the breaches of contract relevant to Case BC705147 must have occurred as soon as the OAH issued its decision, but the OAH decision does not indicate that Golden Day has to pay anything immediately
- The Parkers were not afforded an opportunity to respond to the new evidence and arguments raised by the Departmentâ€™s in its reply
- The Court finds an insufficient basis to conclude that the CDE improperly raised any argument for the first time in reply, or that there were arguments or evidence presented there which the CDE was deprived an opportunity to respond to
- The Parkers have failed to present new facts or law under section 1008
- If all parties to a motion submit, the court will adopt this tentative as the final order. If the department does not receive an email indicating the parties are submitting on the tentative and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion may be placed off calendar.
