The Court grants the Plaintiff's motion for final approval of the Class Action and PAGA settlement. The settlement provides for a non-reversionary Gross Settlement Amount of $2,600,000.00, which will be allocated to approximately 2,386 Class Members on a pro rata basis. The settlement also includes an award to Plaintiffs' Counsel and reimbursement of costs. The Court finds that the settlement is entitled to a presumption of fairness based on the conditions of arms-length bargaining, sufficient investigation and discovery, and experienced counsel. Since the preliminary approval of the settlement, only two Class Members have opted out and no Class Members have objected, which supports the presumption of fairness. The Court also finds the attorney fees requested by Plaintiffs' Counsel to be reasonable, roughly one-third of the preliminary approved GSA.
