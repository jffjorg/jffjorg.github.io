 Case
  No.:  21STCV11887 
 
 
 
 Hearing Date: October 4, 2023



 
            Plaintiff’s
motion for final approval of the Class Action and PAGA settlement is GRANTED. 
 
            On
3/29/2021, Plaintiff Luis Sanchez (Plaintiff) on behalf of himself and other
aggrieved employees filed suit against Brink’s Incorporated and Dunbar Armored,
Inc., seek civil penalties pursuant to the Private Attorney General Act (PAGA),
and Labor Code section 2698, et seq. 
 
            On
7/13/2023, this Court granted preliminary approval of the Class Action and PAGA
settlement. 
 
            Now,
Plaintiffs move for final approval of the class action settlement.
 
            The
motion is unopposed.  
 
Discussion
 
The Class
Action and PAGA Settlement Agreement and Class Action Notice (Settlement
Agreement) provide for the following: 
 
(1) A
non-reversionary Gross Settlement Amount of $2,600,000.00 allocated to
approximately 2,386 Class Members on a pro rata basis according to the number
of weeks each Class Member worked during the Class Period; 
 
(2) An award
of up to one-third of the Gross Settlement Amount (currently $866,666.67) and
up to $50,000.00 in reimbursement of costs to Plaintiffs’ Counsel for services
rendered as counsel on this matter; 
 
(3) Incentive
Award of up to $10,000.00 to each Plaintiff ($40,000.00 in total); 
 
(4)
Settlement Administration fees and costs of up to $20,550.00; and
 
(5) Payment
to the California Labor and Workforce Development Agency (LWDA) of $100,000.00
for civil penalties pursuant to PAGA. Seventy-five percent (75%) of this
payment will be paid to the California Labor and Workforce Development Agency
(LWDA Payment), and twenty-five percent (25%) will be paid to the Net
Settlement Amount for distribution to Class Members.
 
Reasonableness
and fairness are presumed where (1) the settlement is reached through
“arms-length bargaining”; (2) investigation and discovery are “sufficient to
allow counsel and the court to act intelligently”; (3) counsel is “experienced
in similar litigation”; and (4) the percentage of objectors “is small.” (Dunk
v. Ford Motor Co. (1996). 48 Cal. App. 4th 1794, 1802.) 
 
The Court
reviewed the proposed settlement for these conditions in its 7/13/2023 ruling
on the motion for preliminary approval. At preliminary approval, Plaintiffs
presented evidence that the Settlement is entitled to a presumption of fairness
because (1) the Settlement was reached through arm’s length bargaining after
formal mediation, (2) Plaintiffs conducted investigation, including both formal
and informal discovery, and analyzed Class Members’ time and payroll records,
and (3) Plaintiffs’ counsel are sufficiently experienced to be appointed Class
Counsel. (See Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Approval filed
3/28/2023.) Since then, the final Dunk factor has been satisfied: only
two Class Member have opted out, and no Class Members objected. As such,
nothing has changed since preliminary approval which would now negate the
presumption of fairness previously found. 
 
After review,
the Court also finds the attorney fees requested—$866,666.67, roughly one-third
of the preliminary approved GSA, and litigation costs of $26,193.12—to be
reasonable. (See Chavez v. Netflix, Inc. (2008) 162 Cal. App. 4th 43,
66, n.11 (“fee awards in class actions average around one-third of the recovery.”).
 
Based on the
foregoing, Plaintiffs’ motion for final approval of the settlement is granted. 
 
It is so ordered.
