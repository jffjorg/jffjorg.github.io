And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by the defendants, Mi in Fashion, Inc., Hyun S. Lee, and Young Mi Lee. The complaint alleges various Labor Code violations, including failure to pay overtime, minimum wage, and commissions, as well as fraud and unfair business practices.

The judge has overruled the demurrer as to the first, second, fifth, sixth, and ninth causes of action, finding that the allegations are sufficient to state a claim. However, the demurrer was sustained as to the fourth cause of action for fraud, as the allegations are too general and lack specificity.

The judge also sustained the demurrer as to individual defendants Hyun S. Lee and Young Mi Lee for the third and eighth causes of action, finding that they cannot be held liable as individuals for Labor Code violations.

Plaintiffs are given leave to amend the complaint and must serve and file the amended complaint on or before March 28, 2024.
