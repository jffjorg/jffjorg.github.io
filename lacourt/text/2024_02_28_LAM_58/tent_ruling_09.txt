            This
is an action arising from wage and hour employment claims. The Complaint alleges
numerous Labor Code violations. 
 
            On
January 17, 2024, the Court entered default against Defendant Celebrity Shutters and Blinds, Inc. and Gabriel Torres.
Does 1-20 have been dismissed. 
 
            Plaintiff
now moves for default judgment against Defendant Celebrity Shutters and Blinds,
Inc. and Gabriel Torres. The request for entry of default judgment is granted
in a reduced amount. 
 
Discussion
 
            Plaintiff
seeks default judgment in the amount of $59,272.24 against Defendants Celebrity
Shutters and Blinds, Inc. and Gabriel Torres, which includes $2,817.48 in
interest, $530 in costs, and $7,431 in attorney fees. 
 
            Plaintiff
submits adequate evidence to support his request for damages. (Hernandez Decl.,
¶¶ 2-13.) Further, the request for costs is substantiated. (CIV-100, ¶ 7.) 
 
            In
seeking attorney fees, Plaintiff request fees pursuant to Labor Code Sections
218.5, 226, and 1194.[1] Plaintiff
seek fees in the amount of $7,431 based on the lodestar method for time
reasonably incurred. (Casado Decl., ¶ 9, Ex. 5.) Attorney fees are granted in
the reduced amount of $1,844.81; the Court finds no reason to deviate from the
reasonable fee calculation for default cases set forth in LASC 3.214. 
 
            Finally,
the request for prejudgment interest seeks interest at 10% starting on July 31,
2023 until February 28, 2024. However, Plaintiff provides no explanation for
applying the 10% interest rate for contract claims under Civil Code section
3289, as opposed to the constitutional prejudgment interest rate of 7% set
forth in Civil Code section 3287. Thus, prejudgment interest will be reduced to
$1,971.63.
