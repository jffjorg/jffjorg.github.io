And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion for summary judgment in this case. The plaintiff, Fatoumata Doukoure, had filed a complaint against the Los Angeles Community College District (the defendant) for retaliation, harassment, and discrimination. The defendant argued that the plaintiff's claims were precluded by workers' compensation statutes, while the plaintiff argued that her FEHA claims were not barred by workers' compensation.

The judge found that the defendant had met its burden of showing that the plaintiff's first cause of action for retaliation and harassment in violation of FEHA failed, and that no triable issues of material fact existed. The judge also found that the defendant had met its burden of showing that the plaintiff's second cause of action for race discrimination in violation of FEHA failed, and that no triable issues of material fact existed.

The judge further found that the plaintiff had failed to establish a triable issue of material fact as to her third cause of action for failure to prevent retaliation, discrimination, and harassment in violation of FEHA. The judge noted that the plaintiff had not presented any evidence of discrimination or harassment by the defendant.

The judge exercised its discretion to consider the plaintiff's late-filed opposition papers, despite the defendant's objections. The judge also noted that courts liberally construe evidence in support of the party opposing summary judgment and resolve doubts concerning the evidence in favor of that party.
