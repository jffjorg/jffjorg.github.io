Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the plaintiff's motion to compel a site inspection at 1929 Curson Place, Los Angeles, California. The plaintiff served a notice of demand for permission to inspect the property, but the defendants objected on various grounds. The judge finds that the objections are meritless and that the property is relevant to the case. The judge also finds that the defendants have control over the property, despite the current tenant's occupancy, and that the defendant's objections to the inspection are without merit. The judge does not award monetary sanctions, as both parties' actions were warranted.
