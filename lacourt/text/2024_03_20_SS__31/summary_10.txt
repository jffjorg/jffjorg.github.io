And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the defendant's unopposed motion for terminating sanctions. The plaintiff, Julian Verdugo, failed to serve verified discovery responses, despite being ordered to do so by the court. The defendant, Lindsay Duvernay, served discovery requests, but the plaintiff failed to respond. The court has determined that the plaintiff's failure to comply with discovery obligations was willful and that lesser sanctions would not have been effective in curbing the abuse. As a result, the court is granting the defendant's motion and dismissing the plaintiff's action with prejudice. The court is also denying the defendant's request for monetary sanctions, as the imposition of terminating sanctions is sufficient to meet the ends of justice.
