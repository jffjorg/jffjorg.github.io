And here is the English-text summary:

The judge, Hon. Michelle C. Kim, has issued a tentative ruling granting a motion to be relieved as counsel filed by Plaintiff Danielle Fluegall's current attorney, Kate Jamsheed. The motion was filed due to a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship and the inability to obtain Plaintiff's signature for a substitution of attorney. Despite serving the notice and motion on Plaintiff at an address confirmed by a private investigator, Counsel has been unable to obtain the necessary signature. The motion is unopposed and the judge has granted it, allowing Plaintiff to seek new counsel or prepare for trial. The ruling is effective upon filing proof of service of the final order.
