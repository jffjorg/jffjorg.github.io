And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to compel a second physical examination of the plaintiff. The defendant's previous expert, Dr. Rosenberg, retired due to illness, and the defendant has selected a new expert, Dr. Kaplan. However, the plaintiff has already submitted to one physical examination with Dr. Rosenberg, and the judge does not find good cause to compel a second examination. The judge notes that the defendant did not detail the nature of the irreparable harm or substantial prejudice that would result from denying the motion, and therefore did not properly set forth good cause for the examination. The judge also notes that the defendant's statutory bases for the motion are inaccurate. The judge encourages the parties to meet and confer to resolve any remaining issues pertaining to additional examinations, and orders the defendant to give notice of the denial of the motion.
