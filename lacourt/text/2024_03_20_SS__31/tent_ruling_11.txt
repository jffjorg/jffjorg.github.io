BACKGROUND After counsel for plaintiff Justin Biggers (“Plaintiff”) withdrew from the matter, defendant Ralphs Grocery Company dba Ralphs (“Ralphs”) avers that it re-served its form interrogatories, set one, and special interrogatories, set one, directly on Plaintiff on December 14, 2023. (Mots. Gorokhovsky Decl. ¶ 9; Exhs. C.) Plaintiff has not served responses to date. Ralphs therefore seeks an order compelling Plaintiff to respond, without objections, to the outstanding discovery.  The instant motions were served on Plaintiff in pro per. The motions are unopposed.   II. MOTIONS TO COMPEL For a motion to compel initial discovery responses, all a propounding party must show is that it properly served its discovery requests, that the time to respond has expired, and that the party to whom the requests were directed failed to provide a timely response. (See Leach v. Superior Court (1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 902, 905 906.) Where a party fails to serve timely responses to discovery requests, the court may make an order compelling responses. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290; 2031.300; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 403.) A party that fails to serve timely responses waives any objections to the request, including ones based on privilege or the protection of attorney work product. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a); § 2031.300, subd. (a).)   Therefore, because the evidence shows Plaintiff was properly served with discovery and failed to respond, Ralphs’ unopposed motions are GRANTED. Plaintiff is ordered to serve verified responses to Ralphs’ form interrogatories, set one, and special interrogatories, set one, without objections, within thirty (30) days. (CCP §§ 2030.290(a),(b).)  III. SANCTIONS Sanctions are mandatory against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response, unless a court makes certain findings.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290(c).)¿ Plaintiff did not file any opposition. However, sanctions may be awarded, even though no opposition was filed, pursuant to CRC 3.1348(a). Ralphs seeks sanctions in the amount of $1,200 for each motion.      A court has discretion to award sanctions that are “suitable and necessary to enable the party seeking discovery to obtain the objects of the discovery he seeks” but they should not be punitive in nature or levied for the purposes of punishing an offending party. (Vallbona v. Springer (1996) 43 Cal.App.4th 1525, 1545.)  Ralphs is awarded one hour for each motion to compel, and one hour to appear at the hearing (awarded only once), at the requested rate of $190 per hour for a total of $570 in attorney’s fees. Further, Ralphs is awarded two motion filing fees of $60, for a total of $120 as costs.      Sanctions are sought and imposed against Plaintiff. Plaintiff is ordered to pay sanctions to Ralphs, by and through counsel of record, in the total amount of $690, within thirty (30) days.  Moving party is ordered to give notice.    PLEASE TAKE NOTICE: Parties are encouraged to meet and confer after reading this tentative ruling to see if they can reach an agreement. If a party intends to submit on this tentative ruling,¿the party must send an email to the court at¿sscdept31@lacourt.org¿with the Subject line “SUBMIT” followed by the case number.¿ The body of the email must include the hearing date and time, counsel’s contact information, and the identity of the party submitting.¿¿ Unless¿all¿parties submit by email to this tentative ruling, the parties should arrange to appear remotely (encouraged) or in person for oral argument.¿ You should assume that others may appear at the hearing to argue.¿¿ If the parties neither submit nor appear at hearing, the Court may take the motion off calendar or adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the Court.¿ After the Court has issued a tentative ruling, the Court may prohibit the withdrawal of the subject motion without leave.¿  Dated this 1th day of March 2024      Hon.
