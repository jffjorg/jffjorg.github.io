The judge finds that the plaintiff has placed her mental condition at issue and that good cause has been shown for the examination. The examination will be limited to whatever condition is "in controversy" in the action, and the proposed scope of the examination may not be expanded. The judge has also ordered the parties to meet and confer to draft a stipulated protective order to govern the disclosure and use of the raw test data and any audio-recording of the interview and examination.
