BACKGROUND  Plaintiff Julian Verdugo (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against defendant Lindsay Duvernay (“Defendant”) for damages arising from a motor vehicle collision. Defendant now moves for terminating sanctions against Plaintiff to dismiss Plaintiff’s action with prejudice for failing to serve verified discovery responses in compliance with the Court’s November 27, 2023 and November 28, 2023 Orders. Defendant further requests monetary sanctions. Plaintiff is in pro per. Any opposition was due on or before March 7, 2024; none was filed.    II. MOTION FOR TERMINATING SANCTIONS Legal Standard Code of Civil Procedure § 2023.030 gives the court the discretion to impose sanctions against anyone engaging in a misuse of the discovery process.  A court may impose terminating sanctions by striking pleadings of the party engaged in misuse of discovery or entering default judgment.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030(d).)  “[T]the trial court has broad discretion in selecting the appropriate sanction, and we must uphold the trial court's determination absent an abuse of discretion.”  (Dept. of Forestry & Fire Protection v. Howell (2017) 18 Cal.App.5th 154, 191, overturned on other grounds in Presbyterian Camp & Conference Centers, Inc. v. Superior Court (2021) 12 Cal.5th 493, 516 n. 17.)   A violation of a discovery order is sufficient for the imposition of terminating sanctions.  (Collison & Kaplan v. Hartunian (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 1611, 1620.)  Terminating sanctions are appropriate when a party persists in disobeying the court's orders.  (Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 771, 795-796.)   A terminating sanction is a "drastic measure which should be employed with caution."  (Deyo, 84 Cal.App.3d at 793.)  "A decision to order terminating sanctions should not be made lightly. But where a violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction."  (Mileikowsky v. Tenet Healthsystem (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 262, 279-280.)  While the court has discretion to impose terminating sanctions, these sanctions "should be appropriate to the dereliction and should not exceed that which is required to protect the interests of the party entitled to but denied discovery."  (Deyo, supra, 84 Cal.App.3d at 793.)  "[A] court is empowered to apply the ultimate sanction against a litigant who persists in the outright refusal to comply with his discovery obligations."  (Ibid.)  Discovery sanctions are not to be imposed for punishment, but instead are used to encourage fair disclosure of discovery to prevent unfairness resulting for the lack of information.  (See Midwife v. Bernal (1988) 203 Cal.App.3d 57, 64 [superseded on other grounds as stated in Kohan v. Cohan (1991) 229 Cal.App.3d 967, 971].)  Discussion Defendant asserts she served set one of form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and demand for production of documents on Plaintiff on March 30, 2023. Thereafter, Plaintiff’s counsel’s motion to be relieved as counsel was granted on July 14, 2023. Defense counsel avers that the written responses were due on or before August 14, 2023 pursuant to an extension, and that Plaintiff was given notice of the outstanding written discovery by her former counsel. (Mot. Castronovo Decl. ¶ 7.) After receiving no responses, defense counsel wrote a letter to Plaintiff in pro per, advising him of the outstanding discovery. (Id. at ¶ 8.) However, after Defendant received no responses or any communication from Plaintiff, Defendant filed her motions to compel. On November 27, 2023, the Court granted Defendant’s motion to compel form interrogatories, set one, and demand for production of documents, set one. (Min. Order, Nov. 27, 2023.) On November 28, 2023, the Court also granted Defendant’s motion to compel special interrogatories, set one. (Min. Order, Nov. 28, 2023.) Responses were to be due within twenty days. (Ibid.) Defense counsel served the Notices of the rulings on Plaintiff. (Castronovo Decl. ¶ 11.) To date, Plaintiff has not provided any responses pursuant to the Court’s Orders. (Id. at ¶ 12.) Here, there is no evidence that Plaintiff served responses to the outstanding discovery in compliance with this Court’s November 27, 2023 and November 28, 2023 Orders. Plaintiff does not oppose this motion and appears to have abandoned the case. Therefore, the Court concludes Plaintiff knew of his discovery obligations, knew of the Court Order compelling his compliance, and failed to demonstrate his non-compliance was not willful. Given Plaintiff’s failure to comply with his discovery obligations, failure to participate in litigation, failure to communicate with opposing counsel, and apparent disinterest in prosecuting his own action, the Court finds lesser sanctions would not curb the abuse.    Defendant’s motion for terminating sanctions is therefore GRANTED. Plaintiff’s action against Defendant is hereby dismissed without prejudice. Defendant’s additional request for monetary sanctions is denied because the imposition of terminating sanctions is sufficient to meet the ends of justice.     Moving party is ordered to give notice.   PLEASE TAKE NOTICE: Parties are encouraged to meet and confer after reading this tentative ruling to see if they can reach an agreement. If a party intends to submit on this tentative ruling,¿the party must send an email to the court at¿sscdept31@lacourt.org¿with the Subject line “SUBMIT” followed by the case number.¿ The body of the email must include the hearing date and time, counsel’s contact information, and the identity of the party submitting.¿¿ Unless¿all¿parties submit by email to this tentative ruling, the parties should arrange to appear remotely (encouraged) or in person for oral argument.¿ You should assume that others may appear at the hearing to argue.¿¿ If the parties neither submit nor appear at hearing, the Court may take the motion off calendar or adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the Court.¿ After the Court has issued a tentative ruling, the Court may prohibit the withdrawal of the subject motion without leave.¿  Dated this 19th day of March 2024      Hon.
