And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel the deposition of Avis Budget Car Rental, LLC's employee(s) most qualified (PMQ). The plaintiff, James Kay, has been trying to depose Avis' PMQ for over a year, but Avis has been delaying the deposition, citing a conflict and then a need to confirm the proper PMQs.

The judge finds that the parties have met and conferred on a mutually agreeable date for the PMQ deposition, but Avis has failed to appear for the deposition. The judge grants the plaintiff's motion to compel the deposition of Avis' PMQ, ordering the PMQ to appear for deposition at a date, time, and location to be noticed by the plaintiff.

The judge also orders the parties to meet and confer on a mutually agreeable date for the deposition of Avis' PMQ, who are responsive to the remaining categories noticed by the plaintiff. If Avis does not meaningfully participate in the meet and confer discussion, the plaintiff may unilaterally notice Avis PMQ's deposition.

The judge denies Avis' request for monetary sanctions, but grants the plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions in the amount of $3,683.20 for deposition costs and $1,600 for attorney's fees. The judge also orders Avis and its counsel to pay sanctions to the plaintiff in the amount of $5,344.85 within 20 days.
