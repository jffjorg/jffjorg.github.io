And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court rules that the plaintiff's allegations of intentional infliction of emotional distress and failure to repair are sufficient to support a claim. The defendants' demurrer to the fourth cause of action is denied. The court also denies the defendants' motion to strike punitive damages. The plaintiff alleges that the defendants initiated eviction proceedings in retaliation for his complaints about mold infestations and water leaks, and that the defendants failed to repair the issues despite being notified. The court finds that these allegations provide an adequate basis for a fact finder to conclude that the defendants' conduct was in reckless disregard of the probability of causing emotional distress.
