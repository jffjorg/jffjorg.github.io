And here is the English-text summary:

The judge, David S. Cunningham III, has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to seal settlement agreements in a wage-and-hour putative class action case (21STCV41402). The motion is granted in part, allowing the sealing of settlement amounts and private contact and/or identification information, if any, in the settlement agreements. However, the motion is denied in part, requiring that the remaining information in the settlement agreements be made public. The judge's ruling is based on the California Rules of Court, rule 2.550(d), which requires that the court find specific facts to support sealing a record, including an overriding interest that overcomes the right of public access to the record. The judge also cited case law, including Edmon & Karnow, Cal. Practice Guide: Civ. Proc. Before Trial (The Rutter Group June 2023 Update) and Universal City Studio, Inc. v. Superior Court (2003) 110 Cal.App.4th 1273. The judge's decision is intended to balance the right of public access to civil trials with the need to protect confidential information.
