And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to stay the case, Moxley v. Controls Fire Protection, LP, pending the resolution of a similar case, Bergman, which is already pending in San Diego County. The judge finds that the two cases are similar enough to warrant a stay, citing the rule of exclusive concurrent jurisdiction and the court's inherent authority to manage its proceedings. The defendant argues that the cases have identical causes of action and class definitions, and that staying the case will prevent duplicative efforts and inconsistent rulings. The judge notes that the plaintiff's assertion that the case has two unique causes of action is disputed, and that absolute identity of causes of action is not necessary. The judge also finds that there is no prejudice to the plaintiff and is willing to lift the stay for the limited purpose of allowing the plaintiff to file a petition for coordination.
