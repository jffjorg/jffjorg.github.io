TENTATIVE RULING
 
Defendant’s motion to stay is granted.
 
BACKGROUND
 
The instant case – Moxley
(23STCV18232) – is a wage-and-hour putative class action.  
 
Here, Defendant moves to stay Moxley
pending resolution of a similar, older wage-and-hour putative class action
called Bergman (37-2023-00004575-CU-OE-CTL), which is pending in San
Diego County.
 
DISCUSSION
 
Plaintiff contends the motion to
stay should be denied because Defendant fails to establish the elements of
abatement.  (See Opposition, pp. 9-12.)
 
The Court disagrees.  The motion is not based on abatement; it is
based on (1) the rule of exclusive jurisdiction, and (2) the Court’s inherent
authority.  (See Notice of Motion, p. 1.)
 
Exclusive Concurrent
Jurisdiction
 
“Although the rule of exclusive concurrent
jurisdiction is similar in effect to the statutory plea in abatement, it
has been interpreted and applied more expansively, and therefore may apply
where the narrow grounds required for a statutory plea [in] abatement do not
exist.  [Citation.]”  (People ex rel. Garamendi v.
American Autoplan, Inc. (1993) 20 Cal.App.4th 760, 770 (“Garamendi”).)  “Unlike the statutory plea [in] abatement, the
rule of exclusive concurrent jurisdiction does not require absolute
identity of parties, causes of action or remedies sought in the initial and
subsequent actions. [Citations.]” 
(Ibid., emphasis added.)  “If the
court exercising original jurisdiction has the power to bring before it all the
necessary parties, the fact that the parties in the second action are not
identical does not preclude application of the rule.”  (Ibid.)  “Moreover, the remedies sought in the
separate actions need not be precisely the same so long as the court exercising
original jurisdiction has the power to litigate all the issues and grant all
the relief to which any of the parties might be entitled under the pleadings.”  (Ibid., emphasis added.) 
 
Inherent Authority
 
Trial courts have inherent
authority to manage and control their proceedings, “including the inherent
authority to stay an action when appropriate . . . [to] overcome problems of
simultaneous litigation.”  (Jordache
Enterprises, Inc. v. Brobeck, Phleger & Harrison (1998) 18 Cal.4th
739, 758, emphasis added.)
 
Analysis
 
Given these rules, the Court
finds that Moxley should be stayed because:
 
* Bergman was filed first;

 
* Bergman is more advanced
(see Opposition, p. 1 [noting that a hearing on class certification is
scheduled for May 2024]; see also Motion, p. 2 [noting that discovery is taking
place, and the parties plan to attend mediation a week after the
class-certification hearing]);
 
* Defendant is the same in both
cases;
 
* Bergman’s class
definition and class period encompass Moxley’s class definition and
class period (see Defendant’s RJN, Ex. A, ¶ 20 [“All California citizens
currently or formerly employed by Defendants as nonexempt employees in the
State of California” from August 7, 2018 to the present]; see also Moxley
First Amended Complaint (“FAC”), ¶ 19 [“All current and former non-exempt
employees employed by Defendants in the State of California” from August 2,
2019 to the present]);
 
* Bergman and Moxley
have seven identical causes of action (see Opposition, pp. 6-7; see also Reply,
p. 1);  
 
* Plaintiff’s assertion that Moxley
has two unique causes of action is disputed (see Reply, pp. 2-3), and,
regardless, “absolute identity of .
. . causes of action” is unnecessary (Garamendi, supra, 20
Cal.App.4th at 770);
 
* absent a stay, the courts would need to duplicate case
efforts on the same issues and claims, and there would be a genuine risk of making duplicative or inconsistent
key rulings, orders, or judgments; and
 
* there is no prejudice.
 
Nevertheless, to the extent Plaintiff is interested in trying to
coordinate Bergman and Moxley, the Court is willing to lift the
stay for the limited purpose of letting him file a petition for coordination.
