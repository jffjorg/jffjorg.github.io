TENTATIVE RULING
 
The
motion to seal is granted as to (1) the settlement amounts, and (2) private
contact and/or identification information, if any, in the settlement
agreements.
 
The
motion to seal is denied as to the remaining information in the settlement
agreements.
 
Plaintiff
should submit redacted versions for the public file.
 
BACKGROUND
 
This is a wage-and-hour putative
class action.
 
Recently, the parties reached
settlements.  In part, the settlements
require Plaintiffs’ individual claims to be dismissed with prejudice and the
class claims to be dismissed without prejudice.
 
Here, Plaintiffs move to seal the
settlement agreements.
 
LAW
 
The court may order that a record be filed under seal only if
it expressly finds facts that establish: 
 
(1)  
There exists an
overriding interest that overcomes the right of public access to the record;
 
(2)  
The overriding
interest supports sealing the record; 
 
(3)  
A substantial
probability exists that the overriding interest will be prejudiced if the
record is not sealed; 
 
(4)  
The proposed sealing
is narrowly tailored; and 
 
(5)  
No less restrictive
means exist to achieve the overriding interest.
 
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.550(d).)
“These findings embody constitutional requirements for a request to seal
court records, protecting the First Amendment right of public access to civil
trials.  (Edmon
& Karnow, Cal. Practice Guide: Civ. Proc. Before Trial (The Rutter Group
June 2023 Update) ¶ 9:418, emphasis in original.) 
 
The
parties’ agreement to seal documents is not enough to support a motion to
seal.  (Id. at ¶ 9:417.1 [“Parties
sometimes operate under an informal arrangement pursuant to which documents are
‘deemed filed under seal’ unless an objection is made.  Such an arrangement ‘is entirely inconsistent
with the mandatory requirements of rules 2.550 and 2.551 and the constitutional
values informing those requirements.’”].)
 
“Only
the specific words of documents that constitute the sensitive material should
be sealed; generally, it is not permissible to seal the entire document.”  (Id. at ¶ 9:418.5.)
 
Case
law recognizes that confidential settlement agreements “may include information
that may warrant sealing[.]”  (Id. at ¶¶
9:418.5, 9:418.8; see also, e.g., Universal City Studio, Inc. v. Superior
Court (2003) 110 Cal.App.4th 1273.)  
 
But
“[a] settlement agreement . . . does not qualify for sealing after all
references to financial and other confidential data have been redacted.”  (Edmon & Karnow, supra, at ¶ 9:418.20.)
 
DISCUSSION
 
Given
these rules, the Court grants the motion to seal in part because:
 
* it
is unopposed;
 
* an
overriding interest exists in keeping the settlement amounts and private
contact and/or identification information, if any, confidential;
 
* the
overriding interest supports sealing the settlement amounts and private contact
and/or identification information;
 
*
there is a substantial probability that the overriding interest will be
prejudiced if the motion is denied; and
 
* the
sealing is narrowly tailored and the least restrictive means to protect the
overriding interest.
 
The
remaining information in the settlement agreements – i.e., all information
except the settlement amounts and private contact and/or identification
information – is nonconfidential and should not be sealed.  This portion of the motion to seal is denied.
 
Plaintiffs
should submit redacted versions for the public file that comply with these
rulings.
