LEGAL STANDARD: 
 
Evidentiary
Objections
 
This court is unaware of any legal
authority which requires a court to rule on evidentiary objections on a motion,
except as to a motion for summary motion/adjudication [CCP § 437c (q)] or
a special motion to strike [CCP § 425.16 (b)(2); see also, Sweetwater Union High School Dist. v. Gilbane Building Co. (2019)
6 Cal.5th 931, 947-949.] As such, this court respectfully declines to rule
on any of these objections.  This court is well aware of the rules of
evidence, and to how much weight, if any, should be given to any of the
proposed evidence.
 
Request for
Judicial Notice
 
The court denies Plaintiff’s
requests for judicial notice because they are identical to previous requests
for judicial notice and do not pertain to the pending issue.¿
 
Motion to Quash
 
A defendant may serve and file a notice of motion to quash
service of summons on the ground of lack of jurisdiction of the court over
it.  (Code Civ. Proc. (CCP) § 418.10,
subd. (a).)  CCP § 418.10 provides the
exclusive procedure for challenging personal jurisdiction at the outset.  (Roy v.
Superior Court (2005) 127 Cal.App.4th 337, 342.)  Although the defendant is the moving party,
the burden of proof is on the plaintiff to defeat the motion by establishing
that jurisdictional grounds exist.  (Mihlon v. Superior Court (1985) 169
Cal.App.3d 703, 710.) 
 
CCP § 413.10, subdivision (c) states “[e]xcept as otherwise
provided by statute, a summons shall be served on a person: . . . Outside the
United States, as provided in this chapter or as directed by the court in which
the action is pending, or, if the court before or after service finds that the
service is reasonably calculated to give actual notice, as prescribed by the
law of the place where the person is served or as directed by the foreign
authority in response to a letter rogatory. These rules are subject to the
provisions of the Convention on the “Service Abroad of Judicial and
Extrajudicial Documents” in Civil or Commercial Matters (Hague Service
Convention).”  Spain is a signatory to
the Hague Service Convention. 
(Convention Done at the Hague November 15, 1965; (Feb. 10, 1969) 20
U.S.T. 361, T.I.A.S. No. 6638.)   
 
ANALYSIS: 
 
Motion to Quash –
Hague Service Convention
 
Moving Defendant is a Spanish company headquartered in Spain
and contends that Plaintiff did not comply with the Hague Service Convention
because Plaintiff did not comply with CCP § 416.10.  Plaintiff did not address this argument at
all.[1]
 
“The Hague Service Convention states each signatory nation
shall designate a central authority through which service of process may be
effected. (Hague Convention, art. 2.) That authority receives documents and
serves them in accordance with either the internal law of the receiving state
or a compatible method requested by the sender. The authority then provides the
sender with a certificate of service. (Hague Convention, arts. 5, 6.)” (Kott v. Superior Court¿(1996) 45
Cal.App.4th 1126, 1134.)  
 
“Failure to properly serve a party who resides outside the
country under the Hague Service Convention renders all subsequent proceedings
void as to that person. [Citation] This is true even when the party
indisputably had notice of the action.” 
(In re Alyssa F. (2003) 112
Cal.App.4th 846, 852.)  “Failure to
comply with the Hague Service Convention procedures voids the service even
though it was made in compliance with California law. . . .” (Kott v. Superior Court (1996) 45
Cal.App.4th 1126, 1136 (Kott).)  “In cases governed by the Hague Service
Convention, service by mail is permissible if two conditions are met: first,
the receiving state has not objected to service by mail; and second, service by
mail is authorized under otherwise-applicable law.” (Inversiones Papaluchi S.A.S. v. Superior Court (2018) 20
Cal.App.5th 1055, 1065-66 (Inversiones).)
The validity of a service method “must come from California law.” (Id. at 1066 [referring to service by Federal
Express.])
 
CCP § 415.40 provides: “A summons may be served on a person
outside this state in any manner provided by this article or by sending a copy
of the summons and of the complaint to the person to be served by first-class
mail, postage prepaid, requiring a return receipt. Service of a summons by this
form of mail is deemed complete on the 10th day after such mailing.” CCP §
416.10(b) allows service of a summons on a corporation by delivering a copy to
the chief executive officer. (See also Dill
v. Berquist Construction Co. (1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 1426, 1434, 1436 (Dill) [“[I]n order to serve a corporate
defendant by mail at an address outside the state pursuant to section 415.40, a
plaintiff must mail the summons to a person to be served on behalf of the
corporation, i.e., to one of the individuals specified in section 416.10.”].) The
person authorized to accept service does not need to sign the return receipt so
long as the envelope is appropriately addressed. (Cruz v. Fagor America, Inc. (2007) 146 Cal.App.4th 488, 499-501 (Cruz).) A plaintiff may still
substantially comply with the statute if they demonstrate that the summons was
actually received by one of the persons to be served. (Dill, supra, at p. 1437-1439.)  
 
Here, there is insufficient evidence that Plaintiff complied
with CCP § 415.40 or § 416.10. First, there is no proof of service of summons
on file with the court indicating service by this method. As such, the court
cannot confirm to whom process was effected. Second, the evidence before the
court indicates that Plaintiff did not address the mailing to an authorized
individual pursuant to CCP § 416.10 because the return receipt shows it is
addressed to the corporate entity itself. (Metzger Decl. ¶ 27; Exhibit 9.) Third,
the transmittal letter is also addressed to the corporate defendant with a
subline indicating “ATTN” to the CEO. (Id.;
Exhibit 8.) While Dill allows for
substantial compliance with the statute, it is unclear if labeling a
transmittal letter “ATTN” to the CEO is enough to demonstrate that the summons
was actually received by one of the persons to be served under CCP § 416.10. (Dill, supra, at p. 1437.) As stated
above, Plaintiff did not address this at all in their briefing. (See Id. at 1439-1440 [“the burden is on the
plaintiff to prove the existence of jurisdiction by proving, inter alia, the
facts requisite to an effective service.”])
 
Therefore, the court GRANTS Moving Defendant’s motion to
quash service of summons.
 
Personal
Jurisdiction
 
The court declines to develop this argument as moot.
 
CONCLUSION:
 
            For
the foregoing reasons, the Court decides the pending motion as follows: 
 
1.      Motion
to Quash Service of Summons is GRANTED.
 
Moving party is to give notice. 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
