And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the motion for a protective order filed by Cedars-Sinai Medical Center (Defendant) and has denied the motion. The Defendant sought to prevent plaintiff Harmik Abrahamian from taking ten depositions, arguing that they would be overly burdensome and cumulative. However, the court found that the depositions are relevant to the case and seek information that is not cumulative. The court also found that the Defendant's motion lacks substantial justification and therefore has denied the motion.

Additionally, the court has granted plaintiff's request for sanctions and has ordered the Defendant to pay plaintiff's counsel $4,750 in attorney's fees no later than March 5, 2024.
