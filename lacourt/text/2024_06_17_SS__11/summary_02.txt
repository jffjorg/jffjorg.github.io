And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling addresses the case between Shangri-La and Holmes regarding the misappropriation of funds from Shangri-La for the construction and operation of Homekey Properties. The case was previously dismissed without prejudice on April 26, 2024. The petitioners claim that Holmes misappropriated public and private funds, and seek to hold him liable. BMO initially sought judicial foreclosure on three properties but now claims that those claims are moot and no longer implicate Homekey properties. Northstar states that the lenders have agreed to the AG's proposed use restrictions on the Homekey properties. The court intends to explore this representation during oral arguments.
