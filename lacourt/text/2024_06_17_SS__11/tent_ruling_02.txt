Petitioners claim Holmes, a former executive, misappropriated “public and
private funds from Shangri-La that were earmarked for the construction and

This case seeks to hold Holmes liable for the purported
misappropriations.

BMO states that it initially sought judicial foreclosure on three properties
but that those claims are now moot and that the case no longer implicates
Homekey properties.  (See BMO’s

Again, BMO Bank N.A. says the judicial foreclosure claims are now moot.  (See ibid.)

Northstar states that the lenders have agreed to the AG’s proposed use
restrictions on the Homekey properties. 
(See Northstar Opposition, p. 3.)

Shangri-La remains free to try to relate or consolidate the cases so that the
Monterey cases are in one courtroom in Monterey and the San Bernardino cases

(See, e.g., PDG’s Opposition, p. 4 [discussing the San Bernardino
cases].)
