## English Summary:

The judge granted in part and denied in part Plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to certain Requests for Production of Documents (RFPs) from Defendant, General Motors, LLC. 

The judge ruled that General Motors must provide further, verified responses to RFPs 16, 19-32, and 45-46 within 20 days. These RFPs concerned documents related to General Motors' warranty policy and procedures for evaluating lemon law claims.

The judge denied the motion as to RFPs 37-41, which were deemed overly broad and irrelevant because they requested "all" codes related to the vehicle, rather than codes specifically related to transmission and suspension issues.

The judge also denied Plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions against General Motors, finding that their opposition to the motion was not without substantial justification.

**Summary:**

The case summary involves Plaintiff Efrain Trujillo suing Defendant General Motors, LLC for violations of the Song-Beverly Act related to a 2021 GMC Canyon. Trujillo served General Motors with RFP, Set One, seeking further responses to specific requests. However, General Motors only objected and stated that no documents would be produced. After exchanging meet and confer letters and entering into a protective order, General Motors produced some documents, but didn't amend its responses. As a result, Trujillo is entitled to a supplemental response indicating whether General Motors has complied with RFPs 16, 19-32, and 45-46. However, the request for monetary sanctions is denied.
