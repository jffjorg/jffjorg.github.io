And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel further responses to requests for production (RFPs) from General Motors, LLC in a case alleging violations of the Song-Beverly Act. The case involves a 2021 GMC Canyon with defects and nonconformities in the transmission and suspension. General Motors responded to the RFPs with objections only, but later produced some documents under a protective order. The judge finds that General Motors failed to comply with discovery requests and orders the company to provide further, verified, and code-compliant responses to RFPs 16, 19-32, and 45-46 within 20 days of notice. The motion is otherwise denied, and the request for monetary sanction is denied.
