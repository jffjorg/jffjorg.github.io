And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the defendant's motion to compel Keck Medicine of USC to comply with a subpoena for business records. The defendant issued the subpoena and served it on Keck Medicine of USC, as well as serving a notice to consumer on the plaintiff. Neither the plaintiff nor Keck Medicine of USC objected to the subpoena or produced any documents. The court notes that the proof of service shows that the deposition subpoena was issued and served on the custodian of records for Keck Medicine of USC, and that a notice to consumer was served on the plaintiff. As a result, the court has ordered Keck Medicine of USC to serve documents responsive to the subpoena within 20 days of the ruling.
