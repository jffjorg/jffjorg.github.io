And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendants' motion to compel the deposition of the plaintiff, Bryan Maldonado. The plaintiff had failed to appear for multiple deposition notices and had not provided a valid reason for his absence. The judge has ordered the plaintiff to appear for deposition within 20 days of this order.

The judge has also granted the defendants' request for sanctions against the plaintiff and his counsel. The plaintiff and his counsel had failed to provide a valid reason for their failure to appear for the deposition, and the judge has ordered them to pay sanctions in the amount of $920. The judge has reduced the amount of sanctions requested by the defendants, as it was deemed unreasonable.

The judge's ruling is based on California Code of Civil Procedure sections 2025.010, 2025.410, 2025.450(a) and (b), which provide for the taking of depositions and the imposition of sanctions for failure to comply with the deposition notice. The judge has followed these statutory provisions in granting the defendants' motion and imposing sanctions on the plaintiff and his counsel.
