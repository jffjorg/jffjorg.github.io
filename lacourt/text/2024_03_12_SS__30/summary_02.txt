And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling is that the plaintiff's motion to set aside the dismissal of the case is granted. The case was mistakenly dismissed at the non-appearance case review without the presence of counsel, and the judge believes that this was due to court error. As a result, the judge sets an Order to Show Cause (OSC) to reconsider the dismissal and schedules it for 35 days from the hearing date. The plaintiff is ordered to file any responsive paperwork at least 5 days before the hearing.
