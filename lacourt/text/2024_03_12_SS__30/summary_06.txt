And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the defendants' unopposed motion to change the venue of the case from Los Angeles County to Orange County. The Judge finds that the proper venue lies in Orange County because the collision occurred there, and the defendants reside in that county. The plaintiff's alleged injuries also occurred in Orange County. The Judge orders the transfer of the matter to Orange County upon payment of a $50 transfer fee and a separate filing fee, and sets an OSC re sanctions in the amount of $100 against the plaintiff for failing to effectuate the transfer as ordered.
