  Case Number:  23STCP00511    Hearing Date:   November 16, 2023    Dept:  96 Tentative
Ruling -Swamp Capital, LLC v. James Shaw, 23SDTCP00511
The Court
has received a demurrer to the complaint and an opposition.
Plaintiff’s
complaint has three causes of action for 1) enforcing shareholder equity, 2)
declaratory relief to equity, and 3) transfer of court ordered shares.
Defendant
appears to demurrer to the complaint in its entirety rather than specifically
raising objections to specific causes of action.  In summary, Plaintiff claims they own 50
percent of shares acquired from previous litigant Tellez from a cannabis
company that Defendant owns the other 50 percent of shares.  Plaintiff claims Defendant has refused to recognize
them as co-owners, causing them harm. 
Defendant
disputes that Plaintiff has an ownership interest and therefore the demurrer
should be granted.  Plaintiff’s assertion
of fact that he owns 50 percent of the cannabis company is stated in the
complaint.  The court must accept facts
in the complaint as true when considering a demurrer.  Code of Civil Procedure Section 430.10. One
of those facts, Plaintiff’s 50 percent ownership, is in the complaint, and this
factual dispute Defendant raises cannot be litigated at this stage of the
proceedings. Therefore, this is not a proper subject of demurrer and therefore,
the demurrer is overruled.
