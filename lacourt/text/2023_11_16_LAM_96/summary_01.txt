And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has written a tentative ruling regarding a demurrer filed by Defendant James Shaw to a complaint filed by Plaintiff Swamp Capital, LLC. The complaint has three causes of action: enforcing shareholder equity, seeking declaratory relief, and transferring court-ordered shares. The Plaintiff claims to own 50% of the shares in a cannabis company, acquired from a previous litigant Tellez, and that the Defendant has refused to recognize them as co-owners, causing harm. The Defendant disputes the Plaintiff's ownership interest and argues that the demurrer should be granted. However, the Judge finds that the Plaintiff's assertion of fact regarding their 50% ownership is stated in the complaint and must be accepted as true when considering a demurrer. Therefore, the demurrer is overruled, and the case will proceed to hearing on November 16, 2023.
