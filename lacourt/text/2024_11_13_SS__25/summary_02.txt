And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, Winsa Group, Inc., has filed an unopposed motion to set aside the default that was entered against it on May 1, 2023. The court has considered the motion and has decided to continue the hearing to January 16, 2025, at 10:00 a.m. in Department 25 of the Spring Street Courthouse.

The court notes that the motion is unopposed, and the defendant has provided a satisfactory excuse for not presenting a defense to the original action. The court also finds that the defendant has demonstrated diligence in seeking to set aside the default once it was discovered.

However, the court has ordered the defendant to file a new proof of service, as the service that was made was only on the plaintiff and not on all parties in the action. The defendant must file and serve a new proof of service at least 16 court days before the next scheduled hearing. Failure to do so may result in the motion being placed off calendar or denied.
