ANALYSIS:
 
I.                   
Background

 
This action arises from multiple cases
brought by Plaintiff Charlie Ehrlich (“Plaintiff”) against Defendant Miami New
Times, LLC (“Defendant”) alleging defamation and defamation pro se causes of
action.  (Motion Catt Decl., Exh. A, FAC.)
 Defendant publishes online and print
editions of a newspaper in Miami, Florida and wrote about Plaintiff in one of
its articles titled, “A mysterious Hollywood script suggests O.J. had
company from Miami on that fateful night in 1994” (the “Article”). (Motion Catt
Decl. ¶ 2, Exh. A, FAC.) 
 
In Plaintiff’s first case, Plaintiff
contends Defendant’s Article contains false portrayals and defamatory
statements about Plaintiff and his alleged participation in multiple murders. (Motion
Catt Decl., Exh. A, FAC.) During the course of litigation in Florida, Defendant
subpoenaed documents from third party Erik Laibe (“Laibe”), a third party
witness and resident of California. (Motion Catt Decl., ¶ 3.) Defendant sought
the documents to show that Laibe entered into an agreement with Plaintiff “by
which he acquired the rights to commercially exploit Plaintiff’s life story,
specifically including ‘those portions of his life that have dealt with Mr.
Orenthal James [(“O.J.”)] Simpson, either directly or indirectly, without
limitations or restrictions,” and then wrote the movie script that was the
subject of Defendant’s Article. (Motion Catt Decl., ¶¶ 4-6, Exhs. B, C.) Laibe
failed to produce documents in response to the subpoena and a meet and confer
process. (Motion Catt Decl., ¶ 11, Exh. D.)
 
On October 17, 2022, Defendant filed a
Motion to Compel Compliance with Subpoena for production of documents in the Superior
Court of California, County of Los Angeles, alleging the requested materials
would show “(1) the extent to which Plaintiff participated in, or was otherwise
unaware of, the creation of the portion of the script that Plaintiff now
alleges is defamatory, and (2) whether Mr. Laibe acted independently in writing
something about Plaintiff that Plaintiff claims is false and defamatory.” (Motion
Catt Decl., Exh. D, Petn., p. 1.) 
 
Due to discovery deadlines in Florida,
Defendant deposed Laibe for the first time on October 18, 2022 while the Motion
to Compel Compliance with Subpoena was still pending before the Court. (Motion Catt
Decl., ¶ 13.) 
 
On March 29, 2023, the Honorable
Katherine Chilton granted Defendant’s Motion to Compel Compliance with Subpoena,
rejecting Laibe’s arguments that the documents were protected by the First
Amendment, the Shield Law, and the “work product” doctrine. (Motion Catt Decl.,
¶¶ 11, 14; Catt Decl., Exh. F.) Laibe did not appeal the order and produced the
requested materials. (Motion Catt Decl., ¶ 14, Exh. G.) 
 
While the first case was still
pending, Plaintiff filed a second action against Defendant (FL Case No. 2023-008866), wherein Defendant issued
a deposition subpoena for Laibe on February 15, 2024. (Motion Catt Decl., ¶ 17.)
It should be noted that the first and second cases were consolidated in Florida
State Court (Catt Decl., ¶ 16, fn. 1), but the second case’s complaint is not
part of the instant record.
 
On April 11, 2024, Defendant deposed Laibe;
however, Laibe refused to answer a series of questions at the deposition
because he alleged the questions sought information that was protected by the
First Amendment, the Shield Law, and the “work product” doctrine.  (Motion Catt Decl., ¶ 18, Exh. H.) 
 
On May 14, 2024, Defendant’s counsel,
Scott D. Ponce, emailed Laibe to meet and confer about his objections and
refusal to answer the deposition questions. (Motion Catt Decl., ¶ 19, Exh. H.)  
 
On May 17, 2024, Laibe responded,
stating he would not answer Defendant’s deposition questions and alleging that
Defendant’s May 14 email did not comply with meet and confer requirements. Further,
Laibe requested the “questions for which [Defendant] seek[s] further responses
and the good cause re uired to provide those answers in light of the
scope of the allegations against your client, including the necessity of the
answers for your defense.”[1]
(Motion Catt Decl. Exh. I.) 
 
On May 22, 2024, Defendant’s counsel
provided the list of deposition questions to Laibe and stated the answers to
the questions are warranted because “the court already re ected your
position that the First Amendment, Shield Law, and work product doctrine allow
you to refuse to provide this information.”[2]
(Motion Catt Decl. Exh. I.) Laibe did not respond. 
 
Defendant’s counsel subsequently wrote
a brief note following up on the May 22 email. Laibe did not respond. 
 
On June 10, 2024, Defendant filed the
instant Motion to Compel Deposition Answers of Laibe (the “Motion”). Defendant
does not request sanctions. No Opposition has been filed. On October 8, 2024,
Defendant filed a Reply noting Laibe’s failure to file an Opposition and requesting
the Court find Laibe’s failure to oppose the Motion as consent to grant the
Motion. (Reply, p. 1.) 
 
On June 24, 2024, Defendant personally
served Laibe with notice of the Motion hearing and Motion. (6/24/24 Proof of
Service.) 
 
On July 17, 2024, the Court found two
cases (22STCP03790 and 24STCP01890) to be related to the instant matter and
assigned all three cases to Commissioner Karine Mkrtchyan in Department 25 at
Spring Street Courthouse for all purposes. (7/17/24 Order.) 
 
On October 14, 2024, the Court ordered
Defendant to provide documentation of an adequate attempt to meet and confer as
well as a full and complete separate statement in conformance with California
Rules of Court and continued the Motion hearing to November 13, 2024. (10/14/24
Order.)
 
On October 22, 2024, Defendant filed a
status report responding to the October 14th Minute Order and attached a new
meet and confer declaration. (10/22/24 Status Report.) 
 
Subsequently, as a result of meet and
confer efforts, Defendant, joined by Laibe, filed a Stipulation and Proposed
Protective Order (“Stipulated Protected Order”), which was approved by the
Court on November 8, 2024. 
 
II.                
Procedural
Issues 
 
Defendant filed and served the Status
Report and Stipulated Protective Order by electronic service. 
 
III.             
Discussion
 
A.    Motion to Compel
 
Defendant seeks to compel 37
deposition answers of a third party, Mr. Laibe. (Motion, p. 1; Sep.
Statement, pp. 1-16.)  
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.480, subdivision (a)
provides that, “[i]f a deponent fails to answer any question or to produce any
document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing under the
deponent's control that is specified in the deposition notice or a deposition
subpoena, the party seeking discovery may move the court for an order
compelling that answer or production.”
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.480,
subdivision (b) states that a motion made under section 2025.480, subdivision
(a) shall be “made no later than 60 days after the completion of the record of
the deposition, and shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under
[s]ection 2016.040.”  A meet and confer
declaration “shall state facts showing a reasonable and good faith attempt at
an informal resolution of each issue presented by the motion.”  (Code of Civ. Proc., § 2016.040.)  
 
            A separate statement is required for
motions to compel answers at a deposition. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1345(a).) The separate statement must be “full and complete so that no person
is required to review any other document in order to determine the full request
and full response.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(c).) Further, material
“must not be incorporated into the separate statement by reference.” (Ibid.)
For each deposition question to which a response is requested, the separate
statement must include:  (1) the text of
the question demand; (2) the text of each response, answer, or objection; (3) a
statement of the factual and legal reasons for compelling further responses,
answers, or production as to each matter in dispute; (4) text of all
definitions, instructions, or other matters to understand the discovery
requests and responses, as necessary; (5) other requests and responses if the
“response to a particular discovery request is dependent on the response given
to another discovery request, or if the reasons a further response to a
particular discovery request is deemed necessary are based on the response to
some other discovery request”; and (6) summaries of relevant documents if the
“pleadings, other documents in the file, or other times of discovery are
relevant to the motion.”  (Ibid.) 
 
            Timeliness and Meet and Confer Requirements
 
            Defendant’s Motion is timely, as it
was filed on June 10, 2024, less than 60 days after the requisite deposition on
April 11, 2024. (Code of Civ. Proc., § 2025.480(b).) 
 
            On October 14, 2024, the Court found several deficiencies
with Defendant’s meet and confer efforts and ordered Defendant to provide
documentation of an adequate attempt to meet and confer. (10/14/24 Order.) 
 
On October 22, 2024 Defendant filed a status report and a new
meet and confer declaration. In the declaration, Defendant’s counsel Lindsay E.
Catt stated that beginning on October 15, 2024 and ending on October 22, 2024,
the “parties engaged in extensive meet and confer efforts, including exchanging
numerous emails and phone calls” and participating in a two-hour telephonic
conference. (Status Report Catt Decl., ¶¶ 4-5.) During the telephonic conference, the parties agreed
to file a stipulated protective order and agreed that, once the stipulated
protective order is in place, Laibe will sit for a continued deposition. (Status Report Catt Decl., ¶ 7.) Finally, Defendant agreed to withdraw the Motion after
a date and time is scheduled for Laibe’s continued deposition. (Status Report Catt Decl., ¶ 9.) 
 
The Court finds the meet and confer
requirement satisfied.
 
            Separate Statement 
 
            On October 14, 2024, the Court found several deficiencies
with Defendant’s separate statement and ordered Defendant to file a full and
complete separate statement in conformance with California Rules of Court.
(10/14/24 Order.) 
 
            However,
Defendant has not submitted a supplemental separate statement given the
parties’ tentative agreement to file a stipulated protective order, have Laibe
sit for a continued deposition once the stipulated protective order is in
place, and have Defendant withdraw the Motion once the parties have agreed on a
mutually agreeable date and time for Laibe’s further deposition. (Status Report,
p. 2; Status Report Catt Decl., ¶ 9.) 
 
            Given
the parties’ Stipulation and Protective Order, which was approved on November
8, 2024, the Court will not address the Motion at this time. 
 
IV.

LLC’s Motion to Compel Deposition Answers is CONTINUED to JANUARY 13, 2025 at 10:00

Deposition Answers have not been taken off calendar by moving party before the
