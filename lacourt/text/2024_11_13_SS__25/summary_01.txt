And here is a summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's motion to vacate dismissal, enforce settlement, and enter judgment against the defendant, Juan Julian Amezcua. The plaintiff, State Farm Mutual Auto. Ins. Co., filed an action against Amezcua and others arising from an automobile collision. The parties reached a settlement agreement, which was signed by all parties, including Amezcua's insurance carrier. Under the agreement, Amezcua was to pay a total sum of $9,438.58, with partial payments made. However, Amezcua failed to make further payments, which constitutes a default under the agreement. The plaintiff requests that a judgment of $3,822.09 be entered against Amezcua, which is the principal amount of $12,081.02, less payments received, plus suit costs and filing fees. The judge finds the settlement agreement to be valid and enforceable and grants the plaintiff's motion.
