ANALYSIS:
 
I.                   
Background

 
On February 1, 2024, Plaintiff Rosa
Torres (“Plaintiff”) filed an action against Samo Enterprises, Inc. dba Western
Motor Sport (“Samo Enterprises”), Westlake Services, LLC dba Westlake Financial
Services (“Westlake”), and Hudson Insurance Company (“Hudson”) (“Defendants”)
and Does 1-40, alleging causes of action for Violation of Consumers Legal
Remedies Act, Civil Code section 1750 et seq., Violation of California Business
and Professions Code section 17200, et seq., Claim Against Surety, and
Violation of Code of Civil Procedure sections 1281.97 and 1281.99. (Compl., p.
1.) 
 
On March 8, 2024, Hudson filed an
Answer.
 
On March 11, 2024, Plaintiff filed a
Motion to Compel Arbitration, For Court to Pick Arbitration Forum, and Request
for Stay. 
 
On June 18, 2024, the Court granted
Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Arbitration and ordered arbitration of this matter
to the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”). (6/18/24 Order.) The Court
stayed the action pending the completion of arbitration pursuant to Code of
Civil Procedure section 1281.4.
 
On September 19, 2024, Plaintiff filed
the instant Notice of Motion and Motion to Lift Stay (the “Motion”). 
 
No Opposition has been filed. 
 
II.                
Legal
Standard 
 
             “On petition of a party to an
arbitration agreement alleging the existence of a written agreement to
arbitrate a controversy and that a party to the agreement refuses to arbitrate
that controversy, the court shall order the petitioner and the respondent to
arbitrate the controversy if it determines that an agreement to arbitrate the
controversy exists, unless it determines that: (a) The right to compel
arbitration has been waived by the petitioner; or (b) Grounds exist for
rescission of the agreement.” (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1281.2(a)-(b).) As with
other types of agreements, “[t]he failure of the [party] to carefully read the
agreement and the amendment is not a reason to refuse to enforce the
arbitration provisions.” (Powers v. Dickson, Carlson & Campillo
(1997) 54 Cal.App.4th 1102, 1115.) “California law, ‘like [federal law],
reflects a strong policy favoring arbitration agreements and requires close
judicial scrutiny of waiver claims.’” (Wagner Const. Co. v. Pacific
Mechanical Corp. (2007) 41 Cal.4th 19, 31.) If the court orders
arbitration, then the court shall stay the action until “an arbitration is had
in accordance with the order to arbitrate or until such earlier time as the
court specifies.”  (See Code of Civ.
Proc., § 1281.4.)
 
Code of
Civil Procedure section 1281.4 provides, in pertinent part:  
 
“If a court
of competent jurisdiction, whether in this State or not, has ordered
arbitration of a controversy which is an issue involved in an action or
proceeding pending before a court of this State, the court in which such action
or proceeding is pending shall, upon motion of a party to such action or
proceeding, stay the action or proceeding until an arbitration is had in
accordance with the order to arbitrate or until such earlier time as the
court specifies.” (Emphasis added.)  
 
The trial
court’s“ ‘vestigial jurisdiction over the action at law consists solely of
making the determination, upon conclusion of the arbitration proceedings, of
whether there was an award on the merits (in which case the action at law
should be dismissed because of the res judicata effects of the arbitration
award) or not (at which point the action at law may resume to determine the
rights of the parties).’ ” (Cinel v. Christopher (2012) 203 Cal.App.4th
759, 769 (“Cinel”), citations omitted.) 
 
III.             
Discussion
 
 Here, Plaintiff
seeks an order lifting the arbitration stay entered on June 18, 2024. (Motion,
p. 3.) Plaintiff presents evidence demonstrating that, after this Court granted
his Motion to Compel Arbitration, Plaintiff filed a Statement of Claims with
the AAA on June 25, 2024. (Mot., p. 3; Heydari Decl., ¶¿4.) On August 5, 2024,
the AAA agreed to arbitrate the matter and requested that Defendants pay the
arbitration fees no later than the date of the invoice upon receipt. (Heydari
Decl., ¶ 5, Exh. 3.) Defendants failed to pay the required fees before August
20, 2024. (Heydari Decl., ¶ 6.) On August 20, 2024, the AAA sent the parties a
second letter advising the arbitration fees had not yet been paid and again
requested that Defendants submit the payment no later than September 4, 2024. (Heydari
Decl., ¶ 6, Exh. 4.) The AAA warned that failure to remit the requested payment
by September 4 would result in the arbitration file being closed. (Heydari
Decl., ¶ 6, Exh. 4.) The arbitration fees were not paid by September 6, 2024. (Heydari
Decl., ¶ 7.) On September 6, 2024, the AAA sent the parties a final letter
advising that the organization administratively closed their file in the matter
because of Defendants’ failure to pay the requested fees. (Heydari Decl., ¶ 7, Exh.
5.)  
 
Given the
AAA closed the parties’ file and declined to administer the case, the
arbitration proceedings have concluded without a decision on the merits. Accordingly,
the Court may lift the stay and proceed with trial. (See Code of Civ.
Proc., § 1281.4; Cinel, supra, 203 Cal.App.4th at p. 279.)
