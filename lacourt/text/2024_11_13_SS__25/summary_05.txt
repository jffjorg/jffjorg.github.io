And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the motion by plaintiff Rosa Torres to lift the stay and reopen the case. The motion was filed after the arbitration proceedings were administratively closed due to the defendants' failure to pay the required fees. The judge finds that the arbitration proceedings have concluded without a decision on the merits, and therefore, the stay can be lifted. The judge orders the case to proceed to trial, which is scheduled for July 31, 2025. The judge also sets a deadline for the parties to file their joint trial documents and requires them to personally appear on the date of trial.
