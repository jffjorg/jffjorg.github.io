ANALYSIS:
 
I.                   
Background

 
On March 29, 2024, Plaintiff Ian
Wallach (“Plaintiff”) filed a verified Complaint against Defendants Andrew John
Marton (“Marton”) and Child & Marton, LLP (“Child & Marton”) (“Defendants”)
alleging a single cause of action of Breach of Contract. (Comp., p. 1; ¶ 8.) 
 
On May 17, 2024, Defendants filed an
Answer. 
 
On June 6, 2024, Plaintiff consented
to electronic service (6/6/24 Consent to Electronic Service) and filed a
Demurrer to Defendants’ Answer. (6/6/24 Demurrer.) On July 2, 2024, the Court reminded
Plaintiff to abide by obligations under the Code of Civil Procedure to meet and
confer but ultimately overruled Plaintiff’s Demurrer. (7/2/24 Order.)
 
On July 18, 2024, Defendants filed a
Motion for Summary Judgment. This motion is currently set for hearing on December
18, 2024. 
 
  On July
29, 2024, Plaintiff filed a Motion for Leave to File a Verified First Amended
Complaint (“Verified FAC”). (7/29/24 Motion; 7/29/24 Verified Complaint.) On
September 26, 2024, the Court granted Plaintiff’s motion. (9/26/24 Order.) 
 
On September 30, 2024, Plaintiff filed
a “Cross Motion for Summary Judgment or, In the Alternative, Summary
Adjudication.” This motion is currently set for hearing with Defendants’ Motion
for Summary Judgment on December 18, 2024.
 
On October 8, 2024, Defendants filed
the instant Demurrer to Plaintiff’s Verified FAC (“Demurrer”). On October 22,
2024, Plaintiff filed an Opposition. On November 5, 2024, Defendants filed a
Reply with an accompanying declaration from Marton. 
 
II.                
Legal
Standard
 
“As a general matter, in a
demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading
or via proper judicial notice. (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co.
(2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) “A demurrer tests the pleading alone,
and not the evidence or facts alleged.” (E-Fab, Inc. v. Accountants,
Inc. Servs. (2007) 153 Cal.App.4th 1308, 1315.) As such, the court assumes
the truth of the complaint’s properly pleaded or implied factual allegations. (Ibid.)
The only issue a demurrer is concerned with is whether the complaint, as it
stands, states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147
Cal.App.4th 740, 747.)
A general demurrer may be
brought under Code of Civil Procedure section 430.10, subdivision (e) if
insufficient facts are stated to support the cause of action asserted or under
section 430.10, subdivision (a), where the court has no jurisdiction of the subject
of the cause of action alleged in the pleading. All other grounds listed in
Section 430.10, including uncertainty under subdivision (f), are special
demurrers. Special demurrers are not allowed in limited jurisdiction courts.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 92, subd. (c).) 
Where a demurrer is
sustained, leave to amend must be allowed where there is a reasonable
possibility of successful amendment. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18
Cal.3d 335, 348.) The burden is on the plaintiff to show the court that a
pleading can be amended successfully. (Id.; Lewis v. YouTube, LLC (2015)
244 Cal.App.4th 118, 226.) However, “[i]f there is any reasonable possibility
that the plaintiff can state a good cause of action, it is error to sustain a
demurrer without leave to amend.” (Youngman v. Nevada Irrigation Dist.
(1969) 70 Cal.2d 240, 245).
III.             
Discussion

 
A.    Meet and Confer
Code of Civil Procedure
section 430.41 requires that “[b]efore filing a demurrer pursuant to this
chapter, the demurring party shall meet and confer in person, by telephone, or
by video conference with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to
demurrer for the purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached
that would resolve the objections to be raised in the demurrer.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a).) The parties are to meet and confer at least five
days before the date the responsive pleading is due. (Code Civ. Proc., §
430.41, subd. (a)(2).) Thereafter, the demurring party shall file and serve a
declaration detailing their meet and confer efforts. (Code Civ. Proc., §
430.41, subd. (a)(3).) 
Here, Defendants failed to provide a
declaration attesting to the meet and confer efforts made about the issues
raised in the Demurrer prior to filing as required by Code of Civil Procedure
section 430.41, subdivision (a). The Court finds that Defendants have not
complied with the meet and confer requirement. 

            While the Court may not
overrule a demurrer for failure to adequately meet and confer (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 430.41(a)(4)), the Court previously cautioned the parties regarding meet and
confer obligations.  The Court admonishes
the parties to comply with the requirements of the Code of Civil Procedure. 
 
B.     Demurrer
 
Plaintiff’s Allegations in the
Verified FAC
 
            In the
FAC, Plaintiff alleges the following: (1) Plaintiff is an attorney who was
contacted, retained, and employed by Ariell Kirylo (“Kirylo”) to represent her
interests in legal proceeding in which she was a party (Verified FAC, ¶ 7); (2)
Plaintiff brought in Defendants as co-counsel to assist in the case (Verified
FAC, ¶ 7); (3) On October 5, 2021, a retainer agreement was entered into
between Plaintiff, Kirylo, and Defendants (Verified FAC, ¶ 8); (4) The retainer
agreement complied with all statutory and ethical requirements and expressly
provided a fee-sharing provision where Plaintiff and Defendants were to share
fees equally (Verified FAC, ¶ 9; Exh. A); (5) From October 2021 to March 2022,
Plaintiff met several times with Kirylo and exchanged hundreds of emails with
Defendants regarding this matter (Verified FAC, ¶ 10); (6) Plaintiff arranged
for investigations, site visits, and expert witnesses (Verified FAC, ¶ 11); (7)
The relationship between Plaintiff and Kirylo soured, and Marton informed
Plaintiff that Kirylo wanted to proceed solely with Marton as counsel on the
case (Verified FAC, ¶ 12); (8) Marton then proposed, drafted, and signed an
amended fee agreement, dated March 14, 2022, that Kirylo and Plaintiff signed
as well (Verified FAC, ¶¶ 13-14; Exh. B); (9) the March 14, 2022 agreement
stated that the “[c]lient acknowledges that attorney Ian M. Wallach, Esq. who
referred this matter to Child & Marton LLP has expended time and resources
in this matter and will receive a referral fee of twenty-five percent (25%) of
the Attorneys’ fees received by Child & Marton LLP. The attorneys’ fees
paid by Client will not be increased by reason of the referral fee. By signing
this agreement, Client confirms her consent to the terms of the payment of the
referral fee” (Verified FAC, ¶ 14); (10) Defendants settled one of the claims
of Kirylo for $500,000 and did not inform Plaintiff (Verified FAC, ¶¶ 16-17); (11)
on November 3, 2023, Defendants informed Plaintiff by letter they were no
longer willing to abide by the binding fee agreement, Plaintiff is only
entitled to 10 percent share for his referral fee, and Kirylo rescinded her
consent to the 25 percent referral fee (Verified FAC, ¶¶ 18, 21; Exh. C); (12) Defendants
gave Plaintiff $20,000, which was only ten percent of the recovered attorney
fees, and withheld $30,000, and Defendants stated they could not abide by the
March 14, 2022 agreement due to California Rule of Professional Conduct, Rule
1.5.1. (Verified FAC, ¶¶ 26-27.) 
 
Moving Party Position
 
Defendants demur to the Verified FAC
on the basis it does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action
because there is no valid and separate referral agreement between the parties,
Kirylo rescinded her consent to any fee-sharing agreement, and Marton was not
involved in his individual capacity. (Demurrer, pp. 10, 13, 21-22.) Defendants
contend the verified FAC does not establish Defendants assumed any contractual
obligation to a referral fee with Plaintiff, given the referral fee between
Plaintiff and Kirylo was revoked and there is no factual allegation in the
Verified FAC that Plaintiff and Defendants entered into a written referral fee agreement
or an agreement to a division of fees. (Demurrer, pp. 7, 16.) Further,
Defendants contend that while Plaintiff and Kirylo entered into referral fee,
the referral fee is not valid under the Rules of Professional Conduct as the lawyers
involved did not enter into a separate written fee-sharing agreement to divide
the fee. (Demurrer, pp. 8, 9, 17.) 
 
Defendants also contend the Verified
FAC fails to allege facts to state a cause of action against Marton in his
individual capacity rather than as a partner of Child & Marton. (Demurrer,
p. 19.) Finally, Defendants contend the verified nature of the Verified FAC
bolsters their claims as the evidence presented with the Verified FAC
demonstrating the parties’ lack of a contractual relationship must be accepted
as true and Plaintiff’s allegations regarding the terms of the fee agreement
between Plaintiff and Kirylo, and not Plaintiff and Defendants, are considered
judicial admissions. (Demurrer, p. 20.) 
 
                        Opposition
 
            In
Opposition, Plaintiff refutes the allegations in the Demurrer and contends the
facts pled in the Verified FAC establish a valid claim for breach of contract.
(Opp., p. 6.) Plaintiff rebuts Defendants’ argument that the fee referral
agreement does not bind Defendants by stating there exists an implicit
obligation for Defendants to be bound within Paragraph 14 of the agreement.
(Opp., p. 7.) Further, Plaintiff states Defendants do not provide any lawfully
recognized grounds to establish that Kirylo rescinded her consent and
terminated the referral agreement. (Opp., p. 7.) Plaintiff contends Defendants
erroneously conflate a client’s absolute right to discharge an attorney with a
client’s right to revoke consent for a fee-sharing arrangement, and Plaintiff
agrees that a client has an absolute right to terminate representation at any
time. (Opp., pp. 8-9.) Plaintiff also states Defendants misinterpret Rule of
Professional Conduct, Rule 1.5.1 to apply to a claim by a “referring attorney
against the referred-to attorney.” (Opp., p. 8.) Plaintiff asserts Defendants’
interpretation of the client’s right to rescind the fee agreement would lead to
absurd results and states the fee agreement does not contravene public policy.
(Opp., pp. 10-11.) 
 
            However,
Plaintiff concedes to Defendants’ argument that the instant action does not
pertain to Marton and seeks leave to amend to “cure the VAC’s defect as to this
defendant only.” (Opp., p. 3, fn. 2.) Plaintiff seeks leave to amend to allege
that “upon information and belief, Defendant Andrew John Marton entered into an
agreement with Ms. Kirylo to divert funds allocated to Plaintiff under the
March 14, 2022 agreement by having Ms. Kirylo claim that she ‘rescinded’ her
consent to the March 14, 2022 agreement entered around eighteen months
earlier.” (Opp., p. 13.) 
 
                        Reply
 
            In
Reply, Defendants acknowledge Plaintiff’s concession regarding Marton and
contend Plaintiff’s Verified FAC contains two fundamental defects: (1) Plaintiff
is not a defined party to the fee agreement, and (2) the fee agreement fails to
comply with California Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 1.5.1’s requirement
that attorneys themselves must enter into a written agreement to divide fees and
is unenforceable as against public policy. (Reply, pp. 1-2, 5.) Further,
Defendants contend there is no allegation in the Verified FAC that Defendants
received any consideration. (Reply, p. 4.) Additionally, Defendants state
Kirylo’s rescission of consent is proper under both statutory and case law.
(Reply, p. 6.) As to Plaintiff’s proposed amendments to the Verified FAC
regarding Marton, Defendants argue these amendments are manufactured, improper,
and extraneous and legally irrelevant to the Demurrer. (Reply, pp. 8-9.)
Finally, Defendants contend the verified nature of the Verified FAC precludes
amendment because Plaintiff cannot contradict his own verified allegations or
exhibits. (Reply, pp. 9-10.)  
 
            Defendants
also attach a declaration by Marton to the Reply wherein Marton declares that,
contrary to the speculation in the Opposition, “there is absolutely no
agreement between me and the client, Ariell Kirylo, to redirect funds allocated
to Mr. Wallach under the March 14, 2022 contingency fee agreement to her.”
(Reply, Marton Decl., ¶ 2.) 
 
                        Analysis
 
“To establish a cause of action for
breach of contract, the plaintiff must plead and prove (1) the existence of the
contract, (2) the plaintiff’s performance or excuse for nonperformance, (3) the
defendant’s breach, and (4) resulting damages to the plaintiff. 
[Citation.]”  (Maxwell v. Dolezal (2014) 231 Cal.App.4th 93, 97-98.)
“If the action is based on an alleged breach of a written contract, the terms
must be set out verbatim in the body of the complaint or a copy of the written
agreement must be attached and incorporated by reference.” (Harris v. Rudin,
Richman & Appel (1999) 74 Cal.App.4th 229, 307.) “A written contract
may be pleaded either by its terms – set out verbatim in the complaint or a
copy of the contract attached to the complaint and incorporated therein by
reference – or by its legal effect. [Citations.] In order to plead a contract
by its legal effect, plaintiff must ‘allege the substance of its relevant
terms. This is more difficult, for it requires a careful analysis of the
instrument, comprehensiveness in statement, and avoidance of legal
conclusions.’ [Citation.]” (McKell v. Washington Mutual, Inc. (2006) 142
Cal.App.4th 1457, 1489.) 
 
In Fracasse v. Brent (1972) 6
Cal.3d 784, the California Supreme Court upheld the trial court’s sustaining of
a general demurrer without leave to amend on an attorney’s complaint that
alleged his client breached their contract by discharging him and refusing to
give him the fee to which he would have been entitled thereunder. (Fracasse,
supra, 6 Cal.3d at pp. 786-787.) The Supreme Court further held that a discharge
by a client does not constitute a breach of contract (id., at pp.
790-791) and concluded that an attorney who has been discharged without cause
by the client may not “recover as damages the full fee specified in the
contract of employment,” but rather is limited to a “quantum meruit recovery
for the reasonable value of his services, upon the occurrence of any
contingency contemplated by this contract.” (Fracasse, supra, 6
Cal.3d at p. 786.) 
 
The Court finds that circumstances of
this case differ from those in Fracasse as unlike in Francasse, here,
the client is not part of the instant action, and the alleged facts and
attached contract do not demonstrate that Kirylo terminated Plaintiff’s
representation after the instant fee agreement; rather, Plaintiff pleads
termination by Kirylo occurred prior to the subject fee agreement entered
between Kirylo, Plaintiff, and Defendant(s). Accordingly, the breach of
contract raised in the instant action is against the law firm Child &
Marton – a signatory to the agreement – that was made before the client discharged
Plaintiff. Thus, Kirylo’s termination of representation by Plaintiff is not the
breach in question, and Defendant fails to allege facts or evidence otherwise.
Accordingly, the Court finds the instant matter is distinguishable from Fracasse.
(Fracasse, supra, 6 Cal.3d at pp. 786-787.)
 
Defendants also argue that Plaintiff
does not allege the elements required for a breach of contract cause of action
against Child & Marton. The Court disagrees. As to the existence of a
contract, Plaintiff alleges that, after Krylo terminated Plaintiff as counsel, the
parties entered into a contract and fee agreement signed by both parties and
Kirylo – namely, the March 22, 2022 agreement, the terms of which are both
included verbatim in the Verified FAC (Verified FAC, ¶ 14) and attached to the
Verified FAC. (Verified FAC, Exh. B.) Contrary to Defendants’ claims, the
Contract’s terms are reasonably susceptible to the pleaded meaning that a
contract exists between Plaintiff and Defendants. 
 
Regarding performance, the Complaint
alleges Plaintiff performed legal services by way of meeting and corresponding
with Kirylo and Defendants and arranging investigations, site visits, and
expert witnesses. (Verified FAC, ¶¶ 10-11.) As to breach, the Complaint alleges
Defendants stated they were unwilling to abide by the March 22, 2022 agreement
and declined to provide Plaintiff with 25 percent of the attorney’s fees
pursuant to the fee agreement from the $500,000 settlement of one of Kirylo’s
claims. (Verified FAC, ¶¶ 16-20, 26.) Finally, the Complaint alleges Plaintiff
suffered $30,000 damages as a result. (Verified FAC, ¶ 26.) 
 
As to Defendants’ claims regarding the
California Rules of Professional Responsibility, Defendants mischaracterize
Rule 1.5.1. Indeed, Rule 1.5.1 states, in pertinent part, “Lawyers who are not
in the same law firm shall not divide a fee for legal services unless (1) the
lawyers enter into a written agreement to divide the fee; (2) the client has
consented  in writing, either at the time
the lawyers entered into the agreement to divide the fee or as soon thereafter
as reasonably practicable…; and (3) the total fee charged by all lawyers is not
increased solely by reason of the agreement to divide fees.” The Comment to
Rule 1.5.1 then states that the “writing requirements of paragraphs (a)(1) and
(a)(2) may be satisfied by one or more writings.” (Italics added.) Here,
Plaintiff alleged facts that the parties, who are attorneys, entered into one
written agreement, which the Rules of Professional Responsibility
supports, to divide the fee, and the client consented in writing to the
agreement. There is no indication in the Verified FAC that the total fee
charged by all lawyers is not increased solely by reason of the agreement to
divide fees. Thus, Plaintiff’s allegations appear in conformance with Rule
1.5.1 of the California Rules of Professional Responsibility.
 
The Court agrees with the parties that
the Verified FAC fails to allege a cause of action as to Mortan, individually.  As mentioned, Plaintiff concedes to
Defendants’ argument that the instant action does not pertain to Marton and
seeks leave to amend to “cure the VAC’s defect as to this defendant only.”
(Opp., p. 3, fn. 2.) Plaintiff seeks leave to amend to allege that “upon
information and belief, Defendant Andrew John Marton entered into an agreement
with Ms. Kirylo to divert funds allocated to Plaintiff under the March 14, 2022
agreement by having Ms. Kirylo claim that she ‘rescinded’ her consent to the
March 14, 2022 agreement entered around eighteen months earlier.”
 
Where a demurrer is sustained, leave
to amend must be allowed where there is a reasonable possibility of successful
amendment. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.) The burden is
on the plaintiff to show the court that a pleading can be amended successfully.
(Id.; Lewis v. YouTube, LLC (2015) 244 Cal.App.4th 118, 226.) However,
“[i]f there is any reasonable possibility that the plaintiff can state a good
cause of action, it is error to sustain a demurrer without leave to amend.” (Youngman
v. Nevada Irrigation Dist. (1969) 70 Cal.2d 240, 245).
 
Accordingly, the Demurrer is SUSTAINED
with leave to amend as to Defendant Marton, individually.  The Demurrer is OVERRULED as to Child &
Marton, LLP. 
 
IV.             
Conclusion
& Order
 
For the foregoing reasons, the Demurrer
is SUSTAINED with leave to amend as to Defendant Marton.  The Demurrer is OVERRULED as to Defendant Child
& Marton, LLP.
 
Plaintiff’s Second Amended Complaint to
be filed within twenty (20) days of this Court’s ruling.  
 
Moving party is ordered to give notice
