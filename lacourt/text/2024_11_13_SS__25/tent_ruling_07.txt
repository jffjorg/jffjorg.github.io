ANALYSIS:
 
I.                   
Background

 
On July 19, 2024,
Plaintiff Zohrab Steve Haddad (“Plaintiff”)
filed an action against Defendant Vardan Antonyan (“Defendant”) alleging causes
of action for Malicious Prosecution, Intentional Infliction of Emotional
Distress, Perjury, and Request for Sanctions. (Compl., p. 1.) 
 
On
August 14, 2024, Defendant filed an Answer. Also on August 14, 2024, Defendant
filed the instant Motion to Dismiss with Prejudice Based on Collateral
Estoppel, Unclean Hands, and Bad Faith (“Motion”), with proof of service. 
 
On
September 25, 2024, Plaintiff filed an Opposition, erroneously titled as a
“Reply,” to Defendant’s August Motion, with proof of service. Defendant has not
filed a Reply.
 
On
September 30, 2024, Defendant filed a second Motion to Dismiss with Prejudice
Based on Collateral Estoppel, Unclean Hands, and Bad Faith (“the September
Motion”), with proof of service.
 
On
October 11, 2024, the Court continued the Hearing on the August Motion from
October 17, 2024 to November 13, 2024 due to the Court’s unavailability.
(10/11/24 Order.)
 
On
October 21, 2024, Defendant filed a third Motion to Dismiss with Prejudice
Based on Collateral Estoppel, Unclean Hands, and Bad Faith (“the October
Motion”), with proof of service.
 
While
Defendant has filed multiple Motions to Dismiss leading up to the instant
hearing, the Court addresses the Motion filed on August 14, 2024 at this time. 
 
II.                
Procedural
Issues
 
Defendant filed and served the Motion
by electronic service only. Self-represented litigants cannot be served
electronically unless they consent to receive electronic service. (Cal. Rules
of Court, rule 2.251; Code Civ. Proc., § 1010.6, subd. (c).) Here, Plaintiff is
self-represented, and there is nothing in the record indicating Plaintiff
manifested consent to receive electronic service. Additionally, the Motion’s
proof of service contains the incorrect case number and was not addressed to
Plaintiff. (8/14/24 Proof of Service.)
 
Thus, service of process is
defective.  However, since on October 11,
2024, the Court continued the Hearing on the August Motion from October 17,
2024 to November 13, 2024 due to the Court’s unavailability, and Plaintiff has
filed an opposition, the Court will exercise its discretion and decide the
Motion on its merits. 
 
Additionally, it appears the August,
September, and October motions are substantially similar to each other. The
Court reminds Defendant to refrain from filing duplicative motions. 
 
III.             
Legal
Standard & Discussion
 
Defendant requests the Court to dismiss
the Complaint with prejudice because the Complaint is frivolous and “pursued
only for the purposes of harassment and to misuse the judicial system.” (August
Motion, p. 1.)
 
As a preliminary matter, Defendant’s
Motion is not based on applicable statutory authority. Thus, the Court may use
its discretion to treat it as a General Demurrer. However, it appears that
Defendant is attempting to demur to the Complaint, which must be brought
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 430.10, et seq. A demurrer is also
subject to the meet and confer requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section
430.41, which states as follows: 
 
“Before filing a demurrer pursuant to
this chapter, the demurring party shall meet and confer in person or by
telephone with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for
the purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached that would
resolve the objections to be raised in the demurrer. If an amended complaint,
cross-complaint, or answer is filed, the responding party shall meet and confer
again with the party who filed the amended pleading before filing a demurrer to
the amended pleading.” 
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a).) 
 
The parties are to meet and confer at
least five days before the date the responsive pleading is due. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a)(2).) Thereafter, the demurring party shall file and
serve a declaration detailing their meet and confer efforts. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 430.41, subd. (a)(3).) Defendant is reminded to follow the requirements of
Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41 in the future.  
 
Thus, the Court will exercise its
discretion to treat the subject Motion as a General Demurrer. Barragan v. Banco
BCH (1996) 188 Cal. App. 3d 283, 299. 
 
            Complaint
- Factual Allegations
 
The Complaint alleges causes of action
for Malicious Prosecution, Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress,
Perjury, and Request for Sanctions. The Complaint alleges Defendant filed a frivolous
case (allegedly Case No. 22CHRO01629) to retaliate against Plaintiff because
Plaintiff’s supported the opposing parties in other cases Defendant is involved
in. (Compl., p. 4.) Plaintiff further alleges Defendant sent “humiliating mass
emails” to Plaintiff and copied members of the Shadow Mountain View Home
Association, which caused Plaintiff substantial emotional distress. (Compl., p.
4.) Plaintiff requests monetary sanctions in the amount of $8,490 for the
defense of a separate case (Case No. 22CHRO01629). (Compl., pp. 5-6.)
 
            Moving
Party Position
 
Defendant moves to dismiss the case because
of “collateral estoppel, unclean hands, and the Plaintiff’s documented bad
faith actions throughout this litigation.” (Motion, p. 1.)  Defendant contends Plaintiff’s claims
regarding “Haddad’s harassment, TRO violations, his request for attorney fees,
and Mr. Antonyan’s conduct” have been thoroughly adjudicated in Case No.
22CHRO01629 and Plaintiff is estopped from relitigating these issues. (Motion,
p. 3.) Defendant further alleges Plaintiff’s complaint is retaliatory, designed
to harass, and demonstrates bad faith. (Motion, pp. 3-4.) Defendant requests
document fees and sanctions pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 128 as
a result of this action. (Motion, p. 5.)
 
            Opposition
 
In Opposition, Plaintiff first
contends Defendant’s service of the Motion was improper as it was not addressed
to Plaintiff and failed to include the instant case number. (Reply, p. 3.) Plaintiff
further alleges Defendant has engaged in repeated “bad faith tactics” by making
false claims about other cases and misleading the court regarding fee requests.
(Reply, pp. 4-5.) Plaintiff also notes he served Defendant with a subpoena
regarding his repeated claim of a Temporary Restraining Order. (Reply, p. 2.) 
 
            Reply
 
Defendant did not file a Reply, but
instead appears to have submitted duplicative and/or amended versions of the
instant Motion. (9/30/24 Motion to Dismiss; 10/21/24 Motion to Dismiss.) 
 
            Analysis

 
“As a general matter, in a
demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading
or via proper judicial notice. (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co.
(2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) “A demurrer tests the pleading alone,
and not the evidence or facts alleged.” (E-Fab, Inc. v. Accountants,
Inc. Servs. (2007) 153 Cal.App.4th 1308, 1315.) As such, the court assumes
the truth of the complaint’s properly pleaded or implied factual allegations. (Ibid.)
The only issue a demurrer is concerned with is whether the complaint, as it
stands, states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147
Cal.App.4th 740, 747.)
A general demurrer may be
brought under Code of Civil Procedure section 430.10, subdivision (e) if
insufficient facts are stated to support the cause of action asserted or under
section 430.10, subdivision (a), where the court has no jurisdiction of the subject
of the cause of action alleged in the pleading. All other grounds listed in
Section 430.10, including uncertainty under subdivision (f), are special
demurrers. Special demurrers are not allowed in limited jurisdiction courts.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 92, subd. (c).) 
Where a demurrer is
sustained, leave to amend must be allowed where there is a reasonable
possibility of successful amendment. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18
Cal.3d 335, 348.) The burden is on the plaintiff to show the court that a
pleading can be amended successfully. (Id.; Lewis v. YouTube, LLC (2015)
244 Cal.App.4th 118, 226.) However, “[i]f there is any reasonable possibility
that the plaintiff can state a good cause of action, it is error to sustain a
demurrer without leave to amend.” (Youngman v. Nevada Irrigation Dist.
(1969) 70 Cal.2d 240, 245).
The elements of collateral
estoppel are “ ‘ “(1) A claim or issue raised in the present action is
identical to a claim or issue litigated in a prior proceeding; (2) the prior
proceeding resulted in a final judgment on the merits; (3) the party against
whom the doctrine is being asserted was a party or in privity with a party to
the prior proceeding; and (4) issue to be precluded was actually litigated and
necessarily decided.” ’ ” (Zevnik v. Superior Court (2008) 159
Cal.App.4th 76, 83.) 
            Here,
Defendant contends that collateral estoppel bars the instant action because the
issues surrounding certain actions have been thoroughly adjudicated in Case No.
22CHRO01629. Defendant has not filed a request for judicial notice of the other
matter; however, by nature of the Case Number “CHRO” appears to be a Petition
for Civil Harassment Restraining Order filed in 2022.  (Motion, p. 3.) Furthermore, Defendant fails
to allege how the specific claims or issues raised in the present action
are identical to a claim or issue litigated in a prior proceeding, besides a cursory
and conclusory statement that the “issues surrounding Haddad’s harassment, TRO
violations, his request for attorney fees, and Mr. Antonyan’s conduct in court
have been thoroughly adjudicated.” (Motion, p. 3.) Such a general statement
alone does not demonstrate how the issues and claims raised in Plaintiff’s
Complaint, which also include a cause of action for malicious prosecution that requires
previous legal action, is collaterally estopped. Further, Defendant fails to show
the issues to be precluded were actually litigated and necessarily decided, besides
presenting piecemeal copies of emails and a few alleged legal documents.
The Motion’s other
contentions raise general legal principles or defenses, and thus fail to allege
grounds for a general demurrer. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subds. (a), (e) [A
general demurrer may be brought (a) where the court has no jurisdiction of the
subject of the cause of action alleged in the pleading, or (e) if insufficient
facts are stated to support the cause of action asserted.] 
Accordingly, Defendant’s Motion
is DENIED. Defendant’s request for monetary sanctions is DENIED.
Sanctions
 
In opposition, Plaintiff asks for
sanctions against Defendant pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 128.5.
Sanctions under that statute, however, must be brought by separate motion.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 128.5, subd. (f)(1)(A).)  
 
IV.             
Conclusion
& Order
 
Defendant Antonyan Vardan’s Motion to Dismiss is
DENIED. 
 
BOTH PARTIES Request for Monetary
Sanctions are DENIED.
 
Moving party is ordered to
give notice.
