ANALYSIS:
 
I.                   
Background
 
 
In August 2021, Plaintiff Andres
Mendez Adames (“Plaintiff”) purchased a vehicle from Sana Auto Sales Co. (“Sana
Auto”). (Compl., ¶ 16.) Plaintiff
and Sana Auto entered into a vehicle Retail Installment Sales Agreement (the
“Contract”) at the time of the purchase. (Compl., ¶ 25; Motion, Sadr Decl., Exh. 2.) After
the sale, the Contract was assigned to Westlake Services, LLC dba Westlake
Financial Services (“Westlake”).
(Compl. ¶ 40; Motion, Mendez Adames Decl., ¶
3.) Plaintiff contends that Sana Auto misrepresented the condition and value of
the vehicle, and Plaintiff has “been damaged and suffered a loss as a
result.”  (Compl., ¶¶ 17, 21, 23-25, 42.)

 
On September 6,
2023, Plaintiff’s counsel sent a pre-filing demand later to Sana Auto and
Westlake on behalf of Plaintiff. (Sadr
Decl., ¶ 3, Exh. 1.) Plaintiff’s counsel did not receive a reply from
either party on or before September 5, 2024. (Sadr Decl., ¶ 4.) 
 
On March 12, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel
filed for arbitration with the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) on
behalf of Plaintiff against Sana Auto and Westlake. (Motion, p. 4; Motion, Sadr
Decl., ¶ 8.)  AAA did not accept
arbitration of the dispute as to Sana Auto due to an inability to serve.
(Motion, p. 4; Sadr Decl., ¶
9, Exh. 4.) AAA accepted arbitration of the dispute as to Westlake, but
Westlake failed to pay to initiate the arbitration. (Motion, Sadr Decl., ¶¶ 12-13, Exhs. 5, 6.) As a
result, AAA closed the case. (Motion,
Sadr Decl., ¶ 13, Exh. 7.)
 
On August 7, 2024, Plaintiff filed this action against Sana
Auto and Westlake (“Defendants”) and Does 1-40. (Compl., p. 1.) The Complaint
alleged causes of action for Violation of Consumers Remedies Act, Civil Code
section 1750, et seq., Violation of California Business and Professions Code
section 17200, et seq., Violation of Civil Code section 1632, Claim Against
Surety, and Violation of Code of Civil Procedure sections 1281.97 and 1281.99.
(Compl., p. 1.) 
 
On August 12, 2024, Plaintiffs filed
the instant “Petition to Compel Arbitration, Pick Arbitration Forum, and For an
Order Confirming Defendant Westlake Services, LLC is in Material Breach of the
Arbitration Clause, and an Order for Fees and Costs Associated with Arbitration
and Request for Stay” (the “Motion”) against Defendants Sana Auto and Westlake.

 
On August 27, 2024, Plaintiffs amended the Complaint to add the true name
of Doe 31 as Hudson Insurance Company (“Hudson”).
 
On September 30, 2024, Plaintiff filed proof of service of the Summons
and Complaint and Motion on Westlake and Hudson. Plaintiff filed no proof of
service as to Sana Auto. 
 
On October 4, 2024, Hudson was
dismissed without prejudice.
 
II.                
Procedural
Issues
 
Proof of personal service of the Motion and related
documents was filed on September 30, 2024, demonstrating Westlake was served on
September 9, 2024. (9/30/24 Westlake Proof of Service.) Proof of personal
service of the Motion and related documents was filed on September 30, 2024,
demonstrating Hudson was served on September 9, 2024. (9/30/24 Hudson Proof of
Service.) 
 
However, there is no proof of service demonstrating Sana
Auto was served in any manner. 
 
Plaintiff is ordered to submit supplemental papers
demonstrating proper service as to Sana Auto if Plaintiff intends for Sana Auto
to be a party to the action.
