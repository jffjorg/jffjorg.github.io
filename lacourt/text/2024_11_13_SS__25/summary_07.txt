And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Defendant Antonyan Vardan's Motion to Dismiss the case with prejudice. The judge found that the Motion was not properly served on the Plaintiff, and that the Defendant did not follow the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41 in bringing the Motion. The judge also found that the Motion did not adequately allege grounds for dismissal, and that the Defendant failed to demonstrate how the issues and claims raised in the Plaintiff's Complaint were identical to a claim or issue litigated in a prior proceeding.

Additionally, the judge denied both parties' requests for monetary sanctions. The judge noted that sanctions under Code of Civil Procedure section 128.5 must be brought by separate motion, and that the Plaintiff's request for sanctions was not properly brought.

The judge also reminded the Defendant to refrain from filing duplicative motions and to follow the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41 in the future.
