ANALYSIS:
 
I.                   
Background

 
On June 25, 2021, Plaintiff State Farm
Mutual Insurance Company (“Plaintiff”) filed an action against Defendant Juan
Julian Amezcua (“Amezcua”) and Oscar F. Diaz (“Diaz”) (“Defendants”) and Does
1-5 requesting damages of $12,081.02 arising from an automobile collision. (Compl.,
¶ 7, Prayer.) 
 
On November 1, 2021, Defendants filed
an Answer.
 
            On
December 23, 2022, the Court called the matter for trial, but Plaintiff’s
counsel represented the matter had settled. Accordingly, trial was placed off
calendar. (12/23/22 Order.)
 
            On
January 6, 2023, the matter was dismissed with prejudice as to Diaz only. (1/6/23
Request for Dismissal.) 
 
Also on January 6, 2023, Plaintiff
filed a “Stipulation for Entry of Judgment in the Event of Default” (the
“Stipulation”) between Plaintiff and Amezcua. (1/6/23 Stipulation.) 
 
On January 9, 2023, the Honorable Katherine
Chilton signed an order dismissing the action without prejudice as to Amezcua
and retaining jurisdiction under Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6. (1/9/23
Order.)
 
On September 18, 2024, Plaintiff filed
the instant Motion to Vacate Dismissal, Enforce Settlement, and Enter Judgment
Against Amezcua (the “Motion”). 
 
No Opposition was filed.   
 
II.                
Legal
Standard & Discussion 
 
Under Code of Civil Procedure, section
664.6: 
 
(a) If parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a writing signed by the
parties outside of the presence of the court or orally before the court, for
settlement of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon motion, may enter
judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement. If requested by the parties,
the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties to enforce the settlement
until performance in full of the terms of the settlement. 
 
(b) For purposes of this section, a
writing is signed by a party if it is signed by any of the following: 
 
(1) The party. 
(2) An attorney who represents the
party. 
(3) If an insurer is defending and
indemnifying a party to the action, an agent who is authorized in writing by
the insurer to sign on the party’s behalf. This paragraph does not apply if the
party whom the insurer is defending would be liable under the terms of the
settlement for any amount above the policy limits.” 
 
The Stipulation filed by Plaintiff was
signed by Amezcua on December 21, 2022, Amezcua’s counsel on December 22, 2022,
authorized representative for Plaintiff Doug Worley on December 30, 2022, and Plaintiff’s
counsel on January 6, 2023. (1/6/23 Stipulation, p. 4.) 
 
The Stipulation states Amezcua
is to pay a total sum of $9,438.58, reflecting $7,438.58 paid by Amezcua’s
insurance carrier and $2,000 to be paid by Amezcua through a $250.00
downpayment and then at a rate of $100 per month, beginning April 15, 2023 and
continuing on the fifteenth day of each month thereafter until paid in full. (1/6/23
Stipulation, ¶¶ 2, 4.) If Amezcua timely pays the $9,438.58 sum as described,
the Stipulation states Plaintiff shall forgive the remaining balance of its
principal claim as alleged in the Complaint. (1/6/23 Stipulation, ¶ 4.) 
 
The Stipulation further
states that failure to make a payment constitutes a default. (1/6/23
Stipulation, ¶ 6.)  In the event of
default of an installment payment, there is a 15-day grace period for Amezcua
to make payment, Plaintiff shall give written notice to Amezcua regarding the
default, and Amezcua shall be allowed an additional ten days from the date of
written notice to cure the default. (1/6/23 Stipulation, ¶ 8.) If Amezcua fails
to cure the default, the Stipulation states “Plaintiff may immediately cause
Judgment to be entered pursuant to the terms set forth in this Stipulation for
the full amount of the agreed upon judgment as set forth in Paragraph 1 less
any monies paid to date of the breach; and shall also file a partial
Satisfaction of Judgment for all sums previously paid pursuant to this
Stipulation.”  (1/6/23
Stipulation, ¶ 8.) The first paragraph of the Stipulation states that the
Judgment is for a total sum of $12,081.02 plus costs of suit and prejudgment
interest from the date of the loss less any monies paid to the date of the
breach. (1/6/23 Stipulation, ¶ 1.)
 
The Court finds the
Stipulation to be valid and enforceable under Code of Civil Procedure section
664.6. Plaintiff provides evidence that Amezcua made partial payment – Amezcua’s
insurance carrier paid a total of $7,438.58 and Amezcua made payments in the
total sum of $1,350.00. (Benson Decl., ¶ 5.) As of the date this Motion was
filed, however, Plaintiff had received no further payments from Amezcua since May
17, 2024. (Benson Decl., ¶ 5, 7.) Plaintiff also presents evidence of the
default payment letter sent to Amezcua on July 25, 2024 advising Amezcua of the
default and the remaining balance then due in the sum of $650.00. (Benson
Decl., ¶ 6, Exh. 2.) 
 
Plaintiff requests that a
judgment of $3,822.09, based on the principal amount of $12,081.02, less
payments received in the amount of $8,788.58 plus suit costs of $454.65
(reflecting $387.15 lawsuit filing fee and $67.50 service fee) and a filing fee
of $75, be entered against Amezcua. (Benson Decl., ¶ 9.) 
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s unopposed
Motion is GRANTED.
