ANALYSIS:
 
I.                   
Background

 
On March 13, 2023, Plaintiff Delbert Cannon
(“Plaintiff”) initiated this action against Defendants Douglas Center Partners,
LLC (“Douglas Center”), Winsa Group Inc. (“Winsa”), and Serena R. Khor aka
Serena Khor (“Khor”) (“Defendants”) and Does 1-10 alleging a violation of the Uhruh
Civil Rights Act. (Compl., p. 1.) 
 
On April 21, 2023, Douglas Center,
proceeding pro se, filed an Answer.
 
On April 26, 2023, Khor, proceeding
pro se, filed an Answer.
 
On May 1, 2023, default was entered
against Winsa. (5/1/23 Request for Entry of Default.) 
 
On September 9, 2024, the Court called
the matter for a Non-Jury Trial. (9/9/24 Order.) At the time of the hearing,
Douglas Center did not make an appearance, Winsa was in default, and Khor had
filed an Answer. Khor, representing herself, informed the Court “she intends to
obtain Legal Representation and also move to set aside and vacate the default
entered against Defendant Winsa Group Inc., so that an answer may be filed on
their behalf.” (9/9/24 Order.) The Court then scheduled a status conference for
November 14, 2024 and, at party’s request, continued the trial from that day to
April 15, 2025. (9/9/24 Order.) 
 
On October 9, 2024, Winsa filed the
instant Motion to Set Aside Entry of Default (the “Motion”).  The Court notes the Motion was filed by
electronic service only.
 
No Opposition has been filed.
 
II.        Legal
Standard
 
The court has broad discretion to
vacate the entry of default, default judgment, or a dismissal where the moving
party timely establishes a proper ground for relief.  (Cruz v. Fagor America, Inc. (2007)
146 Cal.App.4th 488, 495.)  Code of Civil
Procedure § 473, subdivision (b) contains two distinct provisions for relief
from default.  The first provision is
discretionary and broad in scope, providing: “The court may, upon any terms as
may be just, relieve a party or his or her legal representative from a judgment,
dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken against him or her through his or
her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.  Application for this relief shall be
accompanied by a copy of the answer or other pleading proposed to be filed
therein, otherwise the application shall not be granted, and shall be made
within a reasonable time, in no case exceeding six months, after the judgment,
dismissal, order, or proceeding was taken.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 473(b).) 
 
The general underlying purpose of
Section 473, subdivision (b) is to promote the determination of actions on
their merits.  (Even Zohar Const.
& Remodeling, Inc. v. Bellaire Townhouses, LLC (2015) 61 Cal.4th 830,
838-839.)  “Apart from any statute,
courts have the inherent authority to vacate a default and default judgment on
equitable grounds such as extrinsic fraud or extrinsic mistake.” (Bae v.
T.D. Service Co. of Arizona (2016) 245 Cal.App.4th 89, 97.) A motion
seeking such equitable relief “‘may be brought on such ground even though the
statutory period [for relief under Code of Civil Procedure section 473,
subdivision (b)] has run.’ [Citation.]” 
(Ibid.)  
 
Notably, in limited civil cases, the
grounds for equitable relief are extended to include “inadvertence or excusable
neglect.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 86, subd. (b).) 
 
To qualify for equitable relief from a
default judgment on the basis of extrinsic mistake or fraud, one must satisfy
three elements: “ ‘First, the defaulted party must demonstrate that it has a
meritorious case. Second, the party seeking to set aside the default must
articulate a satisfactory excuse for not presenting a defense to the original
action. Last [], the moving party must demonstrate diligence in seeking to set
aside the default once … discovered.’ ” (Rappleyea v. Campbell (1994) 8
Cal.4th 975, 982 (Rappleyea).)
 
While this stringent three-part test
applies to obtain relief on equitable relief from a default judgment, the
Supreme Court of California left open the question of whether the same test
applies where a default, but no judgment, has been entered. (See ibid.) 
 
III.       Discussion

 
Here, the Motion states that Winsa was
sued alongside its “sole owner, Serena Khor,” who appeared and answered the
Complaint. (Motion, p. 1.) Khor mistakenly thought she appeared on behalf of
both herself and Winsa as she was “a layperson [who] was not represented and
appeared pro per, and did not realize that she could not appear pro per on
behalf of Winsa as well.” (Motion, p. 1.) After Khor’s discovery that Winsa was
in default at the hearing on September 9, 2024, the Motion states Winsa
promptly brought the instant Motion, as directed by the Court, within 30 days
of the hearing. (Motion, p. 1; 9/9/24 Order.) 
 
Even under the stringent three-part
test of Rappleyea, the unique circumstances of this case entitle Winsa to
relief.
 
IV.       Procedural
Issues
 
However,  the Court notes service was made only on
Plaintiff and not to all parties in the action. (Motion, Proof of Service, p.
2.) Douglas Center Partners, LLC, a party to the action, has not been served. 
 
Accordingly, Winsa is ordered to file
a new proof of service.
 
V.        Conclusion
& Order
 
 
Defendant Winsa Group, Inc.’s unopposed
Motion to Set Aside the Default is CONTINUED TO at JANUARY 16, 2025 at
10:00 a.m. in Department 25 at the SPRING STREET COURTHOUSE. 
 
At least 16 court days before the next
scheduled hearing, Winsa Group, Inc. must file and serve a new proof of
service. Failure to do so may result in the Motion being placed off calendar or
denied. 
 
Moving party is ordered to
give notice.
