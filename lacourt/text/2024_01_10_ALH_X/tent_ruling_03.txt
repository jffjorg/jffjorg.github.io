REQUESTED

BACKGROUND
 
             This case arises out of Plaintiff Santander
Consumer USA Inc.’s (“Plaintiff”) lawsuit for claim and delivery for a 2022
Nissan Kick, Vehicle Identification Number 3N1CPSCVONL51O3O9
(“Subject Vehicle”). Plaintiff filed this complaint on September 14, 2023,
alleging four causes of action for (1) claim and delivery, (2) conversion, (3)
quiet title, and (4) declaratory relief. 
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
            Plaintiff’s
application for writ of possession is tentatively GRANTED upon Plaintiff’s
compliance with the undertaking requirement of section 515.010.
 
LEGAL STANDARD
 
“Upon the filing of the complaint or at any time thereafter, the
plaintiff may apply pursuant to this chapter for a writ of possession by filing
a written application for the writ with the court in which the action is
brought.” (Code Civ. Proc. section 512.010, subd. (a).) 
 
“The application shall be executed
under oath and shall include all of the following: [¶] (1) A showing of the basis of the
plaintiff’s claim and that the plaintiff is entitled to possession of the
property claimed. If the basis of the plaintiff’s claim is a written
instrument, a copy of the instrument shall be attached. [¶] (2) A showing that the
property is wrongfully detained by the defendant, of the manner in which the
defendant came into possession of the property, and, according to the best
knowledge, information, and belief of the plaintiff, of the reason for the
detention. [¶] (3) A
particular description of the property and a statement of its value. [¶] (4) A statement,
according to the best knowledge, information, and belief of the plaintiff, of
the location of the property and, if the property, or some part of it, is
within a private place which may have to be entered to take possession, a showing
that there is probable cause to believe that such property is located there. [¶] (5) A statement that the
property has not been taken for a tax, assessment, or fine, pursuant to a
statute; or seized under an execution against the property of the plaintiff;
or, if so seized, that it is by statute exempt from such seizure.” (Code Civ.
Proc. section 512.010, subd. (b).)
 
            “Prior to the hearing required by
subdivision (a) of Section 512.020, the defendant shall be served with all of
the following: [¶] (1) A
copy of the summons and complaint. [¶] (2) A Notice of Application and Hearing. [¶] (3) A copy of the
application and any affidavit in support thereof.” (Code Civ. Proc. section
512.030, subd. (a).)
 
DISCUSSION
 
Requirements of Code of Civil Procedure Section 512.010 
 
            Plaintiff
provides it is entitled to possession of the vehicle because Defendant Terence
Taylor failed to make payments for the Subject Vehicle. Plaintiff provides that
it was assigned the rights to the contract for the Subject Vehicle. (Vargas
Decl. ¶ 7, Exhibit A.) Plaintiff provides that Defendant defaulted under
the contract by failing to make payments starting on August 22, 2022. (Id. ¶
8.) Plaintiff provides Defendant owes $37,130.82 on the Subject Vehicle. (Ibid.)
Plaintiff provides that the Subject Vehicle was transferred to a body shop and accrued
fees totaling over $13,000. (Id. ¶ 10.) Plaintiff provides that the
wholesale value of the Subject Vehicle is $20,147.00 and the retail value of
the Subject Vehicle is $21,543.00. (Id. ¶ 14.) Plaintiff provides that
the Subject Vehicle is located at either Taylor’s residence or at On Star Auto
Club, Inc. (Id. ¶ 17.) Plaintiff also provides that the vehicle was
not taken for tax, assessment, or fine, pursuant to statute. (Id. ¶ 16.)

 
            Plaintiff has met the requirements of Code of Civil
Procedure section 512.010.
 
Issues at Hearing
 
            “At the hearing, a writ of
possession shall issue if both of the following are found: [¶] (1) The plaintiff has
established the probable validity of the plaintiff’s claim to possession of the
property. [¶] (2) The
undertaking requirements of Section 515.010 are satisfied.” (Code Civ. Proc.
section 512.060.)
 
            Plaintiff requests the undertaking requirement to be $40,294.00. Plaintiff’s
request to set the undertaking requirement at $40,294.00 is granted. 
 
CONCLUSION
 
            Plaintiff’s
application for writ of possession is tentatively GRANTED upon Plaintiff’s
compliance with the undertaking requirement of section 515.010.
