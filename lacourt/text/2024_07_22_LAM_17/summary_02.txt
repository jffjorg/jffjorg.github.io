And here is the English text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Anthony Kim v. Eunice J. Bodak, Case No. 23STCV12604. The Judge has granted Bodak's motion to set aside the entry of default. Bodak argues that she was never actually served with the lawsuit, despite the Proof of Service indicating personal service on 12/13/2023. The Judge finds that Bodak did not reside at the location where she was purportedly served and was living with her mother at her mother's residence as the conservator at the time of alleged service. The cross-complainants filed a notice of no objection to the motion. Based on these facts, the Judge has granted Bodak's motion to set aside the entry of default.
