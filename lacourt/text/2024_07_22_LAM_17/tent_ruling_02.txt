  vs.
 
EUNICE J. BODAK
 


 Case
  No.:  23STCV12604
 
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  July 22, 2024 



 
Bodak’s
motion to set aside the entry of default is GRANTED.
            
            On
6/2/2023, Plaintiff Anthony Kim, in pro per, filed suit against Eunice J.
Bodak, Sunok Ham Lee, Chares C. Yoo, Grace Eunhye Ryu, Wisdom Jeehye Ryu,
alleging quiet title. On 6/14/2023, Plaintiff filed a first amended complaint
(FAC) against the same parties alleging the same claim. 
 
            On
9/12/2023, Complainants Charles C. Yoo, Grace Eunhye Ryu, and Wisdom Jeehye Ryu
filed a cross-complaint against Eunice J. Bodak, alleging: (1) abuse of
process; (2) fraud; (3) indemnification; (4) equitable contribution; and (5)
declaratory relief. 
 
            On
1/18/2024, default was entered against Eunice J. Bodak (Bodak). 
 
            Now,
Bodak moves to set aside the entry of default. 
 
Discussion 
 
            Bodak
argues that default should be set aside because she was never actually served.
In support, Bodak notes that the Proof of Service indicates personal service by
the process server on 12/13/2023 at 6:10 pm. However, at the time of the
alleged service, Bodak did not reside at the location where she was purportedly
served. (See Motion, Exh. 2.) Moreover, at the time of alleged service,
she was living with her mother at her mother’s residence as the conservator. 
 
            Cross-Complainants
filed a notice of no objection to this motion.
 
            Based
on the foregoing, Bodak’s motion to set aside the entry of default is granted. 
 
It is so ordered.
