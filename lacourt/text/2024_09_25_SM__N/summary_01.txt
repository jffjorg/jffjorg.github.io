And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion of Specially Appearing Defendant 601 Fremont, LLC to quash the service of summons and complaint for lack of jurisdiction. The judge found that the defendant did not have sufficient contacts with California to establish personal jurisdiction, and therefore the court did not have the authority to exercise jurisdiction over the defendant. The defendant, a company organized and existing in Nevada, did not have any substantial, continuous, and systematic contacts with California, and the plaintiff failed to provide any evidence to demonstrate a basis for personal jurisdiction. The judge noted that the plaintiff had the initial burden to demonstrate facts establishing a basis for personal jurisdiction, and since the plaintiff failed to do so, the burden shifted to the defendant to show that the exercise of jurisdiction would be unreasonable. Since the defendant met this burden, the judge granted the motion to quash the service of summons and complaint.
