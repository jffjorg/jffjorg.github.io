 Case Number:  23STCV06014    Hearing Date:   September 25, 2024    Dept:  N TENTATIVE ORDERDefendants Vladimir Valsky, Val Serebryany, as trustee of the Serebryany Family Trust, and VIG Private Lending, Inc.’s Demurrer to Second Amended Complaint is SUSTAINED with thirty (30) days leave to amend.Plaintiff The Tash Family Trust, dated November 20, 2014, Raymond Tash, Trustee may amend its complaint only as authorized by the Court’s order and may not amend the complaint to add a new party or cause of action without having obtained permission to do so. (Harris v. Wachovia Mortgage, FSB (2010) 185 Cal.App.4th 1018, 1023.)Defendants Vladimir Valsky, Val Serebryany, as trustee of the Serebryany Family Trust, and VIG Private Lending, Inc. to give notice.REASONINGLegal Standard“[A] demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of the allegations in a complaint.” (Lewis v. Safeway, Inc. (2015) 235 Cal.App.4th 385, 388.) A demurrer can be used only to challenge defects that appear on the face of the pleading under attack or from matters outside the pleading that are judicially noticeable. (See Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994 [in ruling on a demurrer, a court may not consider declarations, matters not subject to judicial notice, or documents not accepted for the truth of their contents].) For purposes of ruling on a demurrer, all facts pleaded in a complaint are assumed to be true (Aubry v. Tri-City Hosp. Dist. (1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 967), but the Court does not “assume the truth of contentions, deductions, or conclusions of fact or law” (Moore v. Regents of University of California (1990) 51 Cal.3d 120, 125).Leave to amend must be allowed where there is a reasonable possibility of successful amendment. (See Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 349 [court shall not “sustain a demurrer without leave to amend if there is any reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by amendment”]; Kong v. City of Hawaiian Gardens Redevelopment Agency (2002) 108 Cal.App.4th 1028, 1037 [“A demurrer should not be sustained without leave to amend if the complaint, liberally construed, can state a cause of action under any theory or if there is a reasonable possibility the defect can be cured by amendment.”]; Vaccaro v. Kaiman (1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 761, 768 [“When the defect which justifies striking a complaint is capable of cure, the court should allow leave to amend.”].) The burden is on the complainant to show the Court that a pleading can be amended successfully. (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.)Meet and ConferAs an initial matter, the Court notes that Defendants Vladimir Valsky, Val Serebryany, as trustee of the Serebryany Family Trust, and VIG Private Lending, Inc. (“Defendants”)’s meet-and-confer efforts were insufficient, as Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41, subdivision (a)(3), requires filing a declaration with a demurrer describing the effort to meet and confer. Defendants have provided no such declaration, thereby frustrating the purpose of the meet-and-confer requirement, which is to determine whether the parties can reach an agreement as to the issues raised in the demurrer. Nonetheless, in the interest of judicial efficiency, the Court exercises its discretion to consider the merits of Defendants’ demurrer, but it notes that subsequent failures to comply with statutory obligations may result in a continuance of the hearing on the subject motion.First Cause of Action: Breach of ContractTo state a cause of action for breach of contract, Plaintiff The Tash Family Trust, dated November 20, 2014, Raymond Tash, Trustee (“Plaintiff”) must be able to establish “(1) the existence of the contract, (2) plaintiff’s performance or excuse for nonperformance, (3) defendant’s breach, and (4) the resulting damages to the plaintiff.” (Oasis West Realty, LLC v. Goldman (2011) 51 Cal.4th 811, 821.)Plaintiff alleges that, in early 2023, it entered into a contract with Defendants to postpone the foreclosure sale, for agreed-to consideration, which was paid by Plaintiff, but Defendants breached the agreement by conducting the foreclosure sale. (Second Am. Compl. ¶¶ 23-24.) Plaintiff refers to papers that were signed in February 2023 to postpone the sale (Second Am. Compl. ¶ 13), but Plaintiff provides no specific allegations as to the nature of the written contract. If a breach of contract claim “is based on alleged breach of a written contract, the terms must be set out verbatim in the body of the complaint or a copy of the written agreement must be attached and incorporated by reference.” (Harris v. Rudin, Richman & Appel (1999) 74 Cal.App.4th 299, 307.) If Plaintiff is referring to an oral agreement, “[a] mortgage or deed of trust [] comes within the statute of frauds,” as does “[a]n agreement to modify a contract that is subject to the statute of frauds,” such as a loan modification agreement or agreement to postpone a sale, and such agreements must be in writing to be valid. (Secrest v. Security National Mortgage Loan Trust 2002-2 (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 544, 552, 553.) Plaintiff argues that Civil Code section 2924g, subdivision (c)(1)(C), allows a sale to be postponed by oral agreement, but this does not preclude the requirement that for an agreement to postpone to be enforceable by one party, it must be in writing. While there may a basis to estop Defendants from asserting the statute of frauds, i.e., Plaintiff may have performed under the agreement, this has not been properly pled because Plaintiff has not sufficiently described the terms of the agreement. (See Secrest v. Security National Mortgage Loan Trust 2002-2, supra, 167 Cal.App.4th at p. 284.) Accordingly, Defendants’ demurrer to the first cause of action is SUSTAINED with thirty (30) days leave to amend.Second Cause of Action: Fraud“The elements of fraud are (a) a misrepresentation (false representation, concealment, or nondisclosure); (b) scienter or knowledge of its falsity; (c) intent to induce reliance; (d) justifiable reliance; and (e) resulting damage.” (Hinesley v. Oakshade Town Ctr. (2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 289, 294.) The facts constituting the alleged fraud must be alleged factually and specifically as to every element of fraud, as the policy of “liberal construction” of the pleadings will not ordinarily be invoked. (Lazar v. Superior Court (1996) 12 Cal.4th 631, 645.) To properly allege fraud against a corporation, the plaintiffs must plead the names of the persons allegedly making the false representations, their authority to speak, to whom they spoke, what they said or wrote, and when it was said or written. (Tarmann v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. (1991) 2 Cal.App.4th 153, 157.)Plaintiff alleges that an agreement was reached that refinancing would occur as to the subject property, but Defendants foreclosed on the property, and Defendants’ conduct had been intended to induce Plaintiff to enter into agreements with no intention to perform. (Second Am. Compl. ¶¶ 27-33.) Plaintiff fails to provide any specific facts about the representations made to him, i.e., there is no information as to who said what, when that person spoke, the authority to speak, and the nature by which representations were made. The nature of Defendants’ intention that Plaintiff rely is also unclear. This claim also suffers from the same issues regarding the statute of frauds as stated above. Thus, Defendants’ demurrer to the first cause of action is SUSTAINED with thirty (30) days leave to amend.Third Cause of Action: Wrongful Foreclosure“The elements of a wrongful foreclosure cause of action are: (1) The trustee or mortgagee caused an illegal, fraudulent, or willfully oppressive sale of real property pursuant to a power of sale in a mortgage or deed of trust; (2) the party attacking the sale (usually but not always the trustor or mortgagor) was prejudiced or harmed; and (3) in cases where the trustor or mortgagor challenges the sale, the trustor or mortgagor tendered the amount of the secured indebtedness or was excused from tendering.” (Citrus El Dorado, LLC v. Chicago Title Co. (2019) 32 Cal.App.5th 943, 948, quotation marks and brackets omitted.)Plaintiff asserts wrongful foreclosure based on the conduct alleged in the prior two causes of action, specifically the representations that the foreclosure sale would be postponed, but it was not. (Second Am. Compl. ¶ 38.) As with Plaintiff’s other claims, the Court has concerns about whether any agreement to postpone is subject to the statute of frauds, and Plaintiff has not sufficiently set forth the representations made to him or contract between Plaintiff and Defendants. Accordingly, Defendants’ demurrer to the third cause of action is SUSTAINED with thirty (30) days leave to amend.
