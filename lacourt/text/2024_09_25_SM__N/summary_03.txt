And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion of 601 Fremont, LLC (the defendant) to quash the service of summons and complaint for lack of jurisdiction. The defendant, a Nevada company, argues that the California courts do not have jurisdiction over it because it lacks sufficient contacts with California. The judge finds that the defendant's evidence establishes that it has no substantial, continuous, and systematic contacts with California, and therefore, the exercise of jurisdiction over it would not be fair or reasonable. The plaintiff has failed to demonstrate a basis for personal jurisdiction, and as a result, the motion to quash is granted.
