A demurrer can be used only to challenge defects that appear on the face of the pleading under attack or from matters outside the pleading that are judicially noticeable.
For purposes of ruling on a demurrer, all facts pleaded in a complaint are assumed to be true.
Leave to amend must be allowed where there is a reasonable possibility of successful amendment.

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by Defendants Vladimir Valsky, Val Serebryany, and VIG Private Lending, Inc. to the Second Amended Complaint filed by The Tash Family Trust. The Court sustains the demurrer to the first cause of action for breach of contract, fraud, and wrongful foreclosure with 30 days' leave to amend. The Court finds that the Plaintiff has not sufficiently pled the terms of the alleged contract and that the agreement to postpone the foreclosure sale may be subject to the statute of frauds. The Court also finds that the Plaintiff has not provided specific facts about the representations made by the Defendants and the nature of their intention to induce reliance. The Court notes that the Plaintiff may have a basis to estop the Defendants from asserting the statute of frauds, but this has not been properly pled. The Court exercises its discretion to consider the merits of the demurrer despite the Defendants' failure to comply with the meet-and-confer requirement.
