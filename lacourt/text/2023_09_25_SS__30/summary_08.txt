And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of MARICELA LEMUS vs JOSE PONCE, denying the defendant's motion to quash an amendment to the complaint. The amendment seeks to substitute a named defendant for a fictitious defendant. The court found that the plaintiff's opposition to the motion was devoid of any admissible facts that support the plaintiff's contention that they did not know the identity of the named defendant at the time of filing the complaint. The court also sustained an objection to Exhibit One of the opposition due to hearsay, lack of foundation, and no authentication. The court relied on California Code of Civil Procedure section 474, which allows a named defendant to be substituted for a fictitious defendant if the plaintiff was genuinely unaware of the named defendant's identity or of facts giving rise to a cause of action against the named defendant at the time of filing the complaint. The court noted that the plaintiff's lack of knowledge must be real and not feigned, but whether the plaintiff's ignorance was due to misinformation or negligence is irrelevant.

English text:
The tentative ruling for case number 22STCV27194, scheduled for September 25, 2023, in Dept 30, is denying the Motion to Quash filed by Ponce Recycling Incorporated (PRI). The plaintiff, Maricela Lemus, had specifically named PRI in paragraph 5 of the complaint. The plaintiff argued that she knew the name of the defendant but not their culpability. However, the court found that the opposition was devoid of any admissible facts that support the plaintiff's contention, as no declarations under penalty of perjury were filed. Therefore, the court denies the motion to quash.

The court sustained the objection to Exhibit One of the Opposition due to hearsay, lack of foundation, and no authentication. The court referred to Code Civ. Proc., section 474, which allows a named defendant to be substituted for a fictitious defendant if the plaintiff was genuinely unaware of the named defendant's identity or of facts giving rise to a cause of action against the named defendant. However, the plaintiff's ignorance must be real and not feigned, and the plaintiff's lack of knowledge due to misinformation or negligence is irrelevant.

In summary, the court denied the Motion to Quash filed by PRI and ordered the moving party and moving defendant to give notice. The court sustained the objection to Exhibit One of the Opposition due to hearsay, lack of foundation, and no authentication.

## Tentative Ruling Summary: 

**Case Number:** 22STCV27194 
**Hearing Date:** September 25, 2023
**Dept:** 30
**Plaintiff:** MARICELA LEMUS
**Defendant:** JOSE PONCE & PONCE RECYCLING INC. (PRI)

**Motion:** PRI's Motion to Quash Doe Amendment

**Ruling:** DENIED

**Key Points:**

* **Doe Amendment:** The plaintiff is attempting to substitute a named defendant (PRI) for a fictitious defendant ("Doe") in the lawsuit.
* **Legal Standard:** Code Civ. Proc., section 474 allows substitution of a named defendant for a fictitious defendant if the plaintiff was genuinely unaware of the named defendant's identity at the time of filing the complaint.
* **Plaintiff's Argument:** Plaintiff argues she knew the name of PRI but not their culpability at the time of filing.
* **Court's Finding:** The court finds the plaintiff's opposition lacks admissible evidence to support their claim of genuine ignorance of PRI's identity. The complaint itself suggests the plaintiff knew PRI was a potential defendant. 
* **Exhibit Objection:** The court sustained an objection to Exhibit One of the opposition due to hearsay, lack of foundation, and no authentication.

**Significant Statements:**

* The court emphasizes the plaintiff's lack of knowledge must be "real and not feigned."
* The court notes that whether the plaintiff's ignorance was due to misinformation or negligence is irrelevant.

**Case Citations:**

* San Diego Navy Broadway Complex Coalition v California Coastal Com. (2019) 40 CA5th 563, 579.
* Balon v Drost (1993) 20 CA4th 483, 488, 25 CR2d 12.



## English Summary:

The judge denied the motion by Ponce Recycling Inc. (PRI) to be removed from the lawsuit. PRI argued that the plaintiff, Maricela Lemus, knew their identity at the time she filed the lawsuit and therefore shouldn't be allowed to substitute them for a fictitious defendant ("Doe").  

The judge found that Lemus's arguments lacked sufficient evidence to support her claim that she genuinely didn't know PRI was a potential defendant. The complaint itself suggests Lemus was aware of PRI's involvement.

Furthermore, the judge rejected an exhibit submitted by PRI because it contained hearsay and lacked proper authentication.
