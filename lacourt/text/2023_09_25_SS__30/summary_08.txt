And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling denies PRI's motion to quash the Doe amendment. The court sustains the objection to Exhibit One of the opposition due to hearsay, lack of foundation, and no authentication. The court finds that the plaintiff, Maricela Lemus, knew the name of the defendant, Ponce Recycling Inc. (PRI), but not its culpability. The plaintiff's opposition lacks admissible facts to support this contention, and the court infers that the plaintiff knew PRI was or should have been a defendant in the action. Therefore, the court denies the motion to quash and orders the moving party to give notice.
