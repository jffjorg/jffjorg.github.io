And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to compel deposition, ordering the defendant to produce its most qualified person for deposition, provide verified responses to requests for production, and produce all responsive documents. The defendant had refused to appear at the deposition and refused to provide alternative dates, despite the plaintiff's timely service of the deposition notice. The judge finds that good cause appears and no prejudice is shown, and therefore grants the motion. The defendant is ordered to comply with the deposition notice and produce the required information within 30 days or a date agreed to by the parties.
