## English Summary: 

The judge has ruled in favor of the Plaintiffs (JUAN PEDRO SALAZAR-RODRIGUEZ, et al.) and granted their motion to compel a deposition of the Defendant (FEDEX GROUND PACKAGE SYSTEM, INC.). 

The judge ruled in this way because the Plaintiffs properly served a deposition notice, the Defendant never objected, and then refused to appear for the scheduled deposition. The Defendant also refused to provide alternative dates. Because the Defendant offered no valid reason for avoiding the deposition, the judge found "good cause" to compel it.

The Defendant is now ordered to produce a representative for the deposition, provide complete and accurate document responses, and schedule the deposition within 30 days or a mutually agreed upon date.
