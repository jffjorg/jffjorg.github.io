And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the Defendant's motions to compel further responses are denied as moot. The Judge also declines to award sanctions against either party. The Plaintiff had failed to file verified responses, which is equivalent to not filing responses at all. As a result, the Plaintiff has waived their objections. The Defendant had requested the motion to be heard, but the issues are now different. The Defendant must start the procedural requirements for a motion to compel further responses and meet the requirements of the 8th Amended Standing Order, which includes a meet and confer regarding the date of the Independent Counsel's Declaration (IDC). The IDC must be filed in person in Dept. 30. The Judge notes that the Plaintiff has served responses after the filing of the motions and the hearing date, and assumes that these responses are verified.
