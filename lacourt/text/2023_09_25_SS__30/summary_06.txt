## English Summary

In the case of *Gabriella Tranchina v. Uber Technologies, Inc.*, the judge granted Uber's motion to continue the trial date from November 16, 2023, to June 17, 2024. The judge also continued the final status conference to June 3, 2024. This decision was made because Uber filed a motion for summary judgment which is scheduled for a hearing on May 2, 2024.  The judge reasoned that given the court's current workload, the age of the case, and the number of pending motions, it would be unreasonable to expedite the summary judgment hearing.
