And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to continue the trial date, which was set for November 16, 2023. The new trial date is set for June 17, 2024, at 8:30 am, and the final status conference is continued to June 3, 2024, at 10:00 am. The court has also continued all trial-related deadlines. The judge based this decision on the fact that the defendant filed its motion for summary judgment timely, and that the court is experiencing congestion and has a number of pending motions already filed. The judge has declined to advance the hearing on the summary judgment motion, citing the court's congestion and the age of the case.
