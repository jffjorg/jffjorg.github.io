 Case Number:  22STCV25177    Hearing Date:   September 25, 2023    Dept:  30 ABDUL AZZIZ WILLAN vs DIANA ESCOLERO, et al.Motion to Compel Further Responses:  Form InterrogatoriesMotion to Compel Further Responses:  Special InterrogatoriesRuling:  Defendant's motions to compel responses are denied as moot.  Court declines to award sanctions. Moving party to give notice.. Discussion:  Defendant styles this motion as a motion to compel further.  However, because plaintiff never filed verified responses, this is an initial motion to compel.  Failure to file verified responses is tantamount to not filing responses at all.  (Appleton v. Superior Court (1988)
206 Cal.App.3d 632, 636.) Further, because the responses are untimely, Plaintiff has waived objections. Thus, no separate statement nor IDC was necessary.  Since the filing of the motions and the hearing date, Plaintiff has served responses, which given the reply, the Court assumes are verified. Defense still wants the motion heard, however, the issues are completely different. Defense must now start the procedural requirements for a motion to compel further responses, along with abiding by the 8th Amended Standing Order which requires a meet and confer regarding the date of the IDC.  Please note that IDCs in Dept. 30 must be in person.The Court declines to award sanctions against either party.
