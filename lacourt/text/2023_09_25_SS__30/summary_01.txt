The Court also awards sanctions to the Plaintiff, ordering the Defendant to pay $961.65 in monetary sanctions within 30 days. This is due to the Defendant's failure to serve timely responses to the RFAs, which waived any objections to the requests. The Court cites California Civil Procedure section 2033.280, which provides that a party who fails to serve a timely response to RFAs waives any objections.
