And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the motion of U.S. Law Group to be relieved as counsel-civil for Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant Kevin Lamb. The client, Kevin Lamb, failed to respond to numerous phone calls and emails over several months, making representation not practicable. Additionally, the client failed to pay past-due invoices. The judge finds that there are satisfactory procedures for moving forward without delay, such as the OSC set for July 12, 2024, regarding noncompliance. The client himself is not opposing the motion, and the opposition is asserting an adverse party's interests. The judge concludes that the court's discretion is sound in granting the motion, and will sign the proposed order submitted by counsel.
