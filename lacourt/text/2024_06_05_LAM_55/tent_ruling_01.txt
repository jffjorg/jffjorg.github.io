  Case Number:  22STCV14252    Hearing Date:   June 5, 2024    Dept:  55 NATURE OF PROCEEDINGS:
Plaintiff’s Motion For Terminating And Monetary Sanctions—Or, In The
Alternative, Issue, Evidence, And Monetary Sanctions—Against Defendants 6600
Selma Ave., LLC, Jayesh Kumar, And Madhuben Kumar For Violation Of Court’s
April 18, 2024 Order.
 
BACKGROUND
YOUNG MEN'S CHRISTIAN ASSOCIATION OF METROPOLITAN LOS
ANGELES (“Plaintiff”) brings this case against 6600 SELMA AVE., LLC, JAYESH
KUMAR, and MADHUBEN KUMAR (“Defendants”) for Defendants’ breach of a lease and
guaranty after Defendants stopped paying rent. On 4/18/24, the Court granted
Plaintiff’s motions to compel Defendants’ further responses to requests for admission, form
interrogatories and special interrogatories, and document production, and
ordered Defendants to serve further, verified responses and the document
production by 5/1/24. 
Now, Plaintiff moves for
terminating and monetary sanctions, or in the alternative, issue, evidentiary
and monetary sanctions, against Defendants for violating the 4/18/24 discovery
order.
LEGAL
STANDARD
Where a party willfully
disobeys a discovery order, courts have discretion to impose terminating,
issue, evidence, or monetary sanctions. E.g., Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2023.010(g),
2030.290(c); R.S. Creative, Inc. v. Creative Cotton, Ltd. (1999) 75
Cal.App.4th 486, 495.   
To avoid sanctions, the
burden of proving that a discovery violation was not willful is on the party on
whom the discovery was served. Cornwall v. Santa Monica Dairy Co. (1977)
66 Cal.App.3d 250, 252- 253.
ANALYSIS
Plaintiff seeks terminating
sanctions in the form of an order rendering judgment by default against
Defendants, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure, section 2023.030(d)(4).
Plaintiff also seek monetary sanctions of $34,000.00, which Plaintiff contends is
a reasonable estimate of the fees it will incur drafting and arguing the motion.
Alternatively, Plaintiff seeks issue, evidentiary, and/or monetary sanctions.
In support of this request, Plaintiff
contends that Defendants have willfully violated the Court’s 4/18/24 discovery
order. The Court issued the 4/18/24 order following Defendants’ failure to
serve further discovery responses even after an IDC with the Court, during which
Defendants had agreed to supplement responses. As Plaintiff notes, following
the 4/18/24 order, Defendants Jayesh Kumar and Selma submitted no further
responses, and Defendant Madhuben Kumar submitted unverified, re-formatted
versions of the same responses the Court had recognized as deficient in
connection with an IDC. Defendants have filed no opposition to meet their
burden to show an absence of willful disobedience of the discovery order. Defendants
therefore are subject to terminating and monetary sanctions due to their misuse
of the discovery process by willfully disobeying this Court’s order. 
CONCLUSION
The unopposed motion is
granted. For terminating sanctions, the Court strikes Defendants’ answers and
enters their default. The Court grants the entire amount of $34,000.00 in
monetary sanctions. 
Plaintiff may submit a
default judgment package using the CIV-100 and JUD-100 forms, in which
Plaintiff can include the $34,000 under the line item for attorney’s fees.
