And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion for entry of a stipulated consent judgment in a Proposition 65 case. The plaintiff, Tamar Kalooustian, sued Ancient Brands, LLC, alleging that they sold and distributed Organic Super Greens with excess lead without adequately warning consumers. The consent judgment aims to serve the public interest by limiting exposures to lead and providing clear and reasonable warnings to consumers. The judge finds that the proposed notices are clear, reasonable, understandable, and informative, and that the penalty of $5,000 and attorneys' fees of $40,000 are appropriate.
