 Case Number:  BC633176    Hearing Date:   June 5, 2024    Dept:  55 NATURE OF PROCEEDINGS:
Motion of U.S. Law Group to be Relieved as Counsel-Civil for
Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant Kevin Lamb.
BACKGROUND
This case resulted in a
stipulated judgment entered into by Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant/Judgment Debtor
Kevin Lamb (“Lamb”) and Defendants/Cross-Complainants/Judgment Creditors Steve
Nguyen, Steve Nguyen & Associates, Inc.; SNA Media, Inc.; and SNA Media,
LLC (“Cross-Complainants”).  
Now, counsel moves to be relieved as attorney of
record for Lamb, by declaring that the client failed to respond to numerous phone
calls and emails over the past several months, making representation not
practicable, and also the client has not paid past-due invoices.
LEGAL STANDARD
“The determination whether to grant or deny an
attorney 's motion to withdraw as counsel of record lies within the sound
discretion of the trial court, having in mind whether such withdrawal might
work an injustice in the handling of the case.” Lempert v. Superior
Court (2003) 112 Cal.App.4th 1161, 1173. 
A potential for disruption of orderly processes of
justice may justify denying a motion to be relieved as counsel of record. E.g.,
People v. Verdugo (2010) 50 Cal.4th 263, 311.
 
ANALYSIS
Here, the form notice, declaration, proposed order,
and proof of service sufficiently comply with the requirements for a motion to
be relieved as counsel. See
Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362. Further, moving counsel’s declaration shows
cognizable grounds for withdrawal: 

Client
     by conduct renders it unreasonably difficult for the member to carry out
     the employment effectively (e.g., noncooperation or
     noncommunication). Rules Prof. Conduct, rule 1.16(b)(4). Cf. Estate of Falco v. Decker
     (1987) 188 Cal.App.3d 1004, 1020
     (“We find no abuse of discretion in the trial court's implicit finding
     rejecting the contention that respondents' lack of cooperation justified
     appellants' withdrawal.”).
Client
     breaches an agreement or obligation to the member as to expenses or fees.
     Rules Prof. Conduct, rule 1.16; Lempert v. Sup. Ct. (2003) 112
     Cal.App.4th 1161, 1173.

Additionally, the client filed no opposing document in
order to show prejudice. See Rules Prof. Conduct, rule 1.16, subdiv. (d). 
Although Cross-Complainants’ opposition contends that
attorney withdrawal will be disruptive because the client will not be able to
timely respond to the discovery and contempt matters, the Court finds that
there are satisfactory procedures for moving forward without delay, such as the
OSC re sanctions set for 7/12/24 regarding noncompliance. 
Further, the opposition is asserting an adverse party’s
interests, while the client himself is not opposing the motion. As to law and
motion proceedings, generally litigants must assert their own rights rather
those of third parties. Matrixx Initiatives, Inc. v. Doe (2006) 138
Cal.App.4th 872, 877, 881
CONCLUSION
Therefore, the Court grants the motion, and will sign
the proposed order submitted by counsel.
