And here is the English text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the motion for protective order as to Requests No. 20 and 21, which seek to inspect Plaintiff Chantal G. Estive's third and fourth phones, and denied it as to Requests No. 18 and 19, which seek to inspect her first and second phones. The judge found that Defendant Agustin Quiroz has shown good cause for the requests to inspect the first and second phones, as Plaintiff has acknowledged the existence of responsive text messages involving the pertinent period of time on both phones. However, the judge concluded that the discovery sought as to the third and fourth phones is duplicative and more conveniently found in Defendant's possession. The judge also denied the parties' requests for sanctions.
