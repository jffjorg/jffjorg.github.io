 Case Number:  23STCV13104    Hearing Date:   January 22, 2024    Dept:  61 Defendants
Joseph H. Low IV and Joseph H. Low, Inc.’s Demurrer to the First Amended Complaint
is OVERRULED. 
 
I.                  
DEMURRER
A demurrer should be sustained only where the defects appear
on the face of the pleading or are judicially noticed. (Code Civ. Pro., §§
430.30, et seq.) In particular, as is
relevant here, a court should sustain a demurrer if a complaint does not allege
facts that are legally sufficient to constitute a cause of action. (See
id. § 430.10, subd. (e).) As the Supreme Court held in Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311:
“We treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded, but
not contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law. . . . Further, we
give the complaint a reasonable interpretation, reading it as a whole and its
parts in their context.” (Id. at
p. 318; see also Hahn. V. Mirda
(2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747 [“A demurrer tests the pleadings
alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters. Therefore, it lies only
where the defects appear on the face of the pleading or are judicially noticed.
[Citation.]”] 
 
“In determining whether the complaint is sufficient as
against the demurrer … if on consideration of all the facts stated it appears
the plaintiff is entitled to any relief at the hands of the court against the
defendants the complaint will be held good although the facts may not be
clearly stated.”  (Gressley v. Williams (1961) 193 Cal.App.2d 636, 639.)
 
“A demurrer
for uncertainty is strictly construed, even where a complaint is in some
respects uncertain, because ambiguities can be clarified under modern discovery
procedures.” (Khoury v. Maly’s of Cal., Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th
612, 616.) Such demurrers “are
disfavored, and are granted only if the pleading is so incomprehensible that a
defendant cannot reasonably respond.” (Mahan
v. Charles W. Chan Insurance Agency, Inc. (2017) 14 Cal.App.5th
841, 848.)
 
A demurrer should not be sustained without leave to amend if
the complaint, liberally construed, can state a cause of action under any
theory or if there is a reasonable possibility the defect can be cured by
amendment. (Schifando v. City of Los Angeles, supra, 31 Cal.4th
at p. 1081.) The demurrer also may be sustained without leave to amend where
the nature of the defects and previous unsuccessful attempts to plead render it
probable plaintiff cannot state a cause of action. (Krawitz v. Rusch
(1989) 209 Cal.App.3d 957, 967.)
 
Defendants Joseph H. Low IV and Joseph H. Low, Inc.
(Defendants) demurrer to the First Amended Complaint (FAC), seeking a stay of
this matter in favor of their later-filed interpleader action, and arguing that
Plaintiffs’ claims are substantively deficient. (Demurrer at pp. 4–7.)
 
Defendants’ demurrer is deficient. As explained in ruling
upon Defendants’ prior demurrer, the doctrine of exclusive concurrent
jurisdiction provides no basis to stay the present action in favor of a
later-filed case. (See Plant Insulation Co. v.
Fibreboard Corp. (1990) 224 Cal.App.3d
781, 786–787.) Also in the previous ruling, this court directed Defendants to
Code of Civil Procedure § 386, which states:
 
After
any such complaint or cross-complaint in interpleader has been filed, the court
in which it is filed may enter its order restraining all parties to the action
from instituting or further prosecuting any other proceeding in any court in
this state affecting the rights and obligations as between the parties to the
interpleader until further order of the court.
 
(Code Civ. Proc. § 386, subd. (f).) Defendants may thus seek
an order restraining the parties from further prosecuting this action in the
interpleader case. Defendants, once again, do not explain why this avenue is
unavailable to them.
 
Defendants’ substantive argument
is ill-explained and unpersuasive. They claim that Plaintiffs have failed to
endorse the settlement draft (Demurrer at pp. 5–6), but there is no matter in
the pleading or judicially noticeable materials that support this allegation,
beyond Defendants’ allegations in the interpleader action. Defendants’ argument
that Plaintiffs cannot enforce their attorney lien against them without a
judicial determination on the validity and amount of the lien against the client
is inapposite, as the client here, Alma Nunez, is a party to this action. (Mojtahedi
v. Vargas (2014) 228 Cal.App.4th 974, 978.)
The demurrer is therefore OVERRULED.
