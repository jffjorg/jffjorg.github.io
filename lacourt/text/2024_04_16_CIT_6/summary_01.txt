And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court denies the defendant's motion to compel binding arbitration. The defendant relies on the arbitration provision in the sales contract, which allows for arbitration of disputes arising out of the condition of the vehicle. However, the court finds that the defendant is not entitled to enforce the arbitration provision as a third-party beneficiary. The court also rejects the defendant's equitable estoppel argument, citing a split of authority on the point of law. The court concludes that the defendant is not intended to benefit from the contract and that allowing the defendant to compel arbitration would be inconsistent with the reasonable expectations of the contracting parties.
