The Court has considered the demurrer to the Third Amended Complaint filed by Defendant Campbell and the motion to strike portions of the complaint. The Court finds that the sole cause of action for defamation and libel per se is barred by the statute of limitations, and therefore, the demurrer must be sustained without leave to amend. The Court also finds that the motion to strike is moot. The Court grants Defendant Campbell's request for judicial notice and orders Defendant Campbell to give notice of this ruling. The parties who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court as directed by the instructions provided on the court website.
