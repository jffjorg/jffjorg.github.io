            The Court has considered the moving,

BACKGROUND
             This action arises out of habitability and
substandard conditions concerning Plaintiff’s tenancy at the premises located
on 3531 E. 6th Street, Los, Angeles, California. On August 19, 2019,
Plaintiffs Barbara Mendoza (“Plaintiff”), Johnny Ramirez, and Lisa Granado
filed a complaint against Defendants Danny Navarro (“Defendant”) and Does 1-5,
alleging (1) breach of implied warranty of habitability; (2) breach of
statutory warranty of habitability; (3) breach of covenant of quiet enjoyment;
(4) intentional infliction of emotional distress; (5) nuisance; (6) negligence.

 
            On May 21, 2021, the Court found
judgment for Plaintiff when Defendant failed to appear at trial. (05/21/2021
Judgment.) On March 22, 2022, the Court issued an abstract of judgment in favor
of Plaintiff against Defendant in the amount of $155,660.80. (03/22/2022
Abstract of Judgment.) 
 
            Defendant filed the instant motion
to vacate the judgment on September 21, 2023. On October 23, 2023, Plaintiff
filed an opposition. On October 25, 2023, Defendant filed a reply.

DISCUSSION
The Motion is brought
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure, section 473. The application for relief
must be made no more than six months after entry of the order from which relief
is sought and must be accompanied by an affidavit of fault attesting to the
mistake, inadvertence, surprise or neglect of the moving party or its attorney. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b); English v. IKON Business Solutions
(2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 130, 143.)  
Defendant’s Motion was not
timely brought less than six months after the Judgment.  Instead, the
Motion was filed almost 1 year and seven months after the Judgment. The
six-month deadline is jurisdictional and not subject to tolling.  (Manson,
Iver & York v. Black (2009) 176 Cal.App.4th 36, 42.)  Therefore,
the Court has no statutory authority to relieve Defendant from the dismissal
under this statute. 
 
When a motion to vacate a
judgment “is made more than six months after the default was entered, the
motion is not directed to the court’s statutory power to grant relief for
mistake or excusable neglect under Code of Civil Procedure section 473, but
rather is directed to the court’s inherent equity power to grant relief from a
default or default judgment procured by extrinsic fraud or mistake.’ 
[Citations.]”  (Gibble v. Car-Lene Research, Inc. (1998) 67
Cal.App.4th 295, 314.)  Extrinsic fraud occurs when a defendant is
deprived of his opportunity to present his claim or defense to the court, or
when he was kept ignorant or fraudulently prevented from fully participating in
the proceeding.  (Id. at p. 315.)  This does not include
circumstances when the party “‘has been given notice of the action and has had
an opportunity to present his case and to protect himself from any mistake or
fraud of his adversary, but has unreasonably neglected to do so.’”  (Ibid.) 
For extrinsic mistake, “[m]istake has been defined as ‘“ . . . the doing of an act under an
erroneous conviction, which act, but for such conviction, would not have been
done.”’ (Salazar v. Steelman (1937) 22 Cal.App.2d 402, 409 [71 P.2d
79].)  The same reasoning logically applies to a failure to act,—an
omission.”  (Aldrich v. San Fernando Valley Lumber Co. (1985) 170
Cal.App.3d 725, 738 (“Aldrich”).) 
 
To set aside a judgment or
order based on extrinsic mistake, the defaulted party must (1) show that it has
a meritorious case, (2) articulate a satisfactory excuse for not presenting a
defense to the original action, and (3) demonstrate that it was diligent in
seeking to set aside the default once it had been discovered.  (Id.) 
 
A court may properly consider papers that are not
timely filed pursuant to CCP section 1005(b) unless “substantial rights” are
affected.  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1300(d); Code Civ. Proc., § 475.)  The
appearance of a party at the hearing of a motion and his or her opposition to
the motion on the merits is a waiver of any procedural defects or
irregularities in a motion.  (Carlton
v. Quint (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 690, 697.) 

 
Defendant
moves to vacate the judgment on the grounds that Defendant was abandoned by his
attorney Shawn Golan (“Golan” or “counsel”) and misled for over two years into
believing that he was properly represented in this matter.  Defendant’s defense is that he did not
receive notice of the judgment and abstract of judgment and Golan did not him
about the judgment, despite their continued communication. (See Motion at p.
5-7.) 
 
            The Court notes that Plaintiff’s
opposition was not timely filed as it was due on October 20, 2023. It appears
that Defendant timely filed a reply and objections to Plaintiff’s evidence, so
it appears there has been no prejudice to Defendant. As such, the Court will
consider Plaintiff’s opposition in determining the merits of Defendant’s
motion.
 
            In opposition, Plaintiff argues that
Defendant has never retained any attorney in the litigation of this case and
Defendant was aware that he was unrepresented through the litigation but chose
to ignore it. Plaintiff also contends that Defendant has provided insufficient
evidence to support vacating the judgment against him. Plaintiff also asserts
that Defendant’s reliance on the Aldrich case is misplaced because that
case involved different facts from this case. Plaintiff asserts that Defendant
failed to act with reasonable diligence because he was aware of the events
during litigation and waived over 20 months to set aside the judgment. Last,
Plaintiff argues that she will be prejudiced if the court vacates the judgment due
to her suffering from memory lapse.
 
            In reply, Defendant argues that Plaintiff’s
opposition should be disregarded and not considered by the Court in ruling on
the motion to vacate. Defendant contends that Plaintiff’s counsel has violated
Rule 4.2(a) of the California Rules of Professional Conduct by communicating
with Defendant while he was represented by counsel. Defendant seeks the
disqualification of Plaintiff’s counsel Azuka L. Uzoh as remedy for her
misconduct. Defendant argues that Uzoh’s declaration contains hearsay and
statements made without personal knowledge that must be excluded. Defendant
also argues that he has shown a meritorious defense and Plaintiff fails to
demonstrate prejudice. 
 
            Defendant sets forth in his declaration that his acquaintance Angelyn
Gates referred him to Golan, an experienced litigation attorney. (Navarro Decl.
¶9.) On December 19, 2020, Defendant entered into a written engagement
agreement (“Retainer”) with Golan who agreed to represent him in the lawsuit. (Id. at ¶10, Ex. A.) Defendant communicated with Golan over email
regarding the trial date in the lawsuit, which was originally set for January
11, 2021, but Golan informed Defendant that the next hearing was a Final Status
Conference on April 6, 2021. (Id. at ¶11, Ex. C.) Defendant attests to
having continued communications with Golan from January 9, 2021, and several
months after through email and phone calls but was not aware that trial was
scheduled on April 12, 2021, on the day Golan planned to call him to discuss
the lawsuit. (Id. at 12, Ex. D.) 
 
 Defendant states that he continued to assume
Golan was properly representing him in the lawsuit after April 12, 2021, but
was surprised to receive in the mail the copy of an Abstract of Judgment issued
against him and subsequently emailed the documents to Golan. (Id. at
¶13, Ex. E.) Defendant spoke with Golan over the telephone after June 21, 2023,
who offered no explanation as to what happened and promised to have the
abstract and lien removed by the Recorder. (Id. at ¶14.) On August 18,
2022, Defendant learned that the Abstract and lien were still on record and
Golan promised he would file a motion to set aside the Abstract and lien. (Id.
at ¶15, Ex. F.) From September 21, 2022 to October 16, 2022, and January 30,
2023 to February 17, 2023, Defendant asserts that Golan did not provide any
updates about setting aside the Abstract and judgment or confirmation that a
motion had been filed. (Id. at ¶16-17, Ex. G, H.) Defendant asserts that
Golan informed him on June 19, 2023, that “he had “blown it” with my case, he
simply failed to show up for the trial in the lawsuit on April 12, 2021, or any
thereafter, and that in fact there was no hearing scheduled in June 2023 or any
other date. He promised me ... that he would get the judgment in the Lawsuit
removed as soon as possible and “make things right.”” (Id. at ¶18.)
Defendant also states Golan informed him he would reserve a court hearing date
of August 1, 2023, for a motion to vacate the judgment but failed to provide
him with a copy of the motion; Luis Torres visited Golan’s address, but Golan
emailed Defendant on July 31, 2023, that he would file a police report and informed
him not to contact him again and disputed that Defendant had paid him. (Id.
at ¶19-20. Ex. K.) Defendant retained Douglas Galanter as counsel on August 10,
2023, and attests that until June 19, 2023, he believed Golan would represent
him. (Id. at ¶¶ 20 and 23.) 
 
            Defendant first discovered the Abstract
of Judgment on June 20, 2022. (Navarro Decl. ¶13, Ex. E.) Defendant also actively communicated with his counsel
on the trial date of April 12, 2021. (Id. at ¶12, Ex. D.) Considering
the timing of Defendant’s learning about the abstract of judgment after
judgment was entered in the case, and the long period of inaction by Defendant
or counsel since the underlying events and Defendant’s discovery of the
judgment, the Court finds that Defendant’s timing was not reasonable, and that he
did not act diligently in seeking relief. 
 
            Defendant
contends he has a meritorious defense. However, Defendant merely states that Plaintiff’s
“[c]laims are without merit and unsupported by the true facts, and that Plaintiff’s
factual allegations are either false, exaggerated or misleading.” (Navarro
Decl. ¶5.) Furthermore, Defendant directs the Court to its answer to Plaintiff’s
complaint on January 28, 2020, where he denied the allegations of the Complaint
and asserts nineteen affirmative defenses. (Reply, at p. 9.) Defendant asserts
that he “never conducted a campaign to evict Plaintiff … never abandoned my
duties as a landlord and never intentionally refused to make repairs.” (Navarro
Supp. Decl. ¶20.)
 
            The Court cannot
grant relief under equitable grounds because Defendant has not shown extrinsic
fraud or mistake as grounds for granting such relief. Here, Defendant has not
indicated that he was prevented from exhibiting his case through the fraud or
deception of his opponent or the acts of Plaintiff.  Defendant attributes his counsel’s
incompetence as an extrinsic mistake, but Defendant has failed to provide an
attorney declaration of fault from Golan. Defendant regularly communicated
with counsel through email and phone calls and despite learning of the Abstract
of Judgment issued against him, Defendant continued to assume that counsel was
properly representing him. (Navarro Decl. ¶14.) While Defendant attests to Counsel’s error in failing to
show up for trial on April 12, 2021, Defendant must demonstrate that he has a
meritorious case against Plaintiff. Defendant has failed to demonstrate that he
has a meritorious case. Thus, Defendant has not met his burden of showing
extrinsic mistake or fraud. 
 
Accordingly,
the Court DENIES Defendant’s motion to vacate judgment on equitable grounds. 
 
Moving
Party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.            
 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed
by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive an email
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off
calendar.
