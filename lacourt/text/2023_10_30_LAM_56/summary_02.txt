The motion for terminating sanctions was filed by Defendant Gregory Yu on August 24, 2023, and no opposition was filed by Plaintiffs. The judge notes that Plaintiffs failed to respond to discovery requests, failed to comply with court orders, and failed to oppose this motion for terminating sanctions.
