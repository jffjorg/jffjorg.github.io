And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the motions, oppositions, and replies filed in this case and has made a tentative ruling. The case involves a dispute between the plaintiff, Barbara Mendoza, and the defendant, Danny Navarro, over a judgment entered against the defendant on May 21, 2021. The defendant seeks to vacate the judgment on the grounds of extrinsic mistake and equitable relief.

The judge has found that the defendant's motion is untimely and that the defendant has not shown a meritorious defense. The judge has also found that the defendant's counsel, Shawn Golan, failed to appear at trial on April 12, 2021, and that the defendant was unaware of the judgment and abstract of judgment until June 20, 2022.

The judge has concluded that the defendant has not met his burden of showing extrinsic mistake or fraud and has denied the defendant's motion to vacate the judgment. The judge has ordered the defendant to give notice of this ruling and has instructed the parties to submit any further arguments or evidence by email.
