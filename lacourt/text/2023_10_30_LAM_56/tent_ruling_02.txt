MOVING PARTY: Defendant
Gregory Yu
 
            The Court has considered the moving
papers.  No opposition papers were
filed.  The Court further notes that
although the Court has received notice of automatic stay based on the
bankruptcy filing of Defendant GJY Property Investment, Inc., LLC, it has not
issued an order staying the entire action, and the remainder of the action is
proceeding as to Plaintiffs’ claims as to, among other defendants, Gregory C.
Yu, moving party herein
 
BACKGROUND
            This consolidated action consists of
five actions arising out of a landlord/tenant relationship at a residential
property owned and managed by defendants. 
On
February 16, 2023, Defendant Gregory C. Yu (“Defendant”) filed: (1) a motion to
compel responses to the Form Interrogatories, Set 1 served on Plaintiffs Erik
Kitter and Nicholas Hartstein (“Plaintiffs”); (2) a motion to compel
Plaintiffs’ responses to Special Interrogatories, Set 1; (3) a motion to compel
Plaintiffs’ responses to Requests for Production, Set 1; and (4) a motion to
deem Requests for Admissions, Set 1 admitted against Plaintiffs. 
 
            On April 17, 2023, the Court granted
Defendant’s motion to compel Plaintiffs to serve responses to Form
Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories and Requests for Production and deemed
the Request for Admissions admitted. 
 
On
August 24, 2023, Defendant filed the motion for terminating sanctions. No
opposition is filed. 
 
DISCUSSION
            Terminating Sanctions 
CCP
section 2023.030 provides that, "[t]o the extent authorized by the chapter
governing any particular discovery method..., the court, after notice to any
affected party, person, or attorney, and after opportunity for hearing, may
impose... [monetary, evidence, and terminating] sanctions against anyone
engaging in conduct that is a misuse of the discovery process...." CCP
section 2023.010 provides that "[m]issues of the discovery process
include, but are not limited to, the following:... (d) Failing to respond or to
submit to an authorized method of discovery.... (g) Disobeying a court order to
provide discovery...." 
 
"The
trial court may order a terminating sanction for discovery abuse 'after
considering the totality of the circumstances: [the] conduct of the party to
determine if the actions were willful; the detriment to the propounding party;
and the number of formal and informal attempts to obtain the discovery.'"
(Los Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 377, 390 (quoting Lang
v. Hachman (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 1225, 1246).) "Generally, '[a]
decision to order terminating sanctions should not be made lightly. But where a
violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows
that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery
rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction.'" (Los
Defensores, supra, 223 Cal.App.4th at p. 390 (citation omitted).) 
 
"Under
this standard, trial courts have properly imposed terminating sanctions when
parties have willfully disobeyed one or more discovery orders." (Id.
(citing Lang, supra, 77 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1244- 1246); see, e.g., Collisson
X Kaplan v. Hartunian (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 1611, 1617-1622 (terminating
sanctions imposed after defendants failed to comply with one court order to
produce discovery); Laguna Auto Body v. Farmers Ins. Exchange (1991) 231
Cal App 3d 481, 491 (disapproved on other grounds in Garcia v. McCucchen
(1997) 16 Cal.4th 469, 478, n. 4) (terminating sanctions imposed against
plaintiff for failing to comply with a discovery order and for violating
various discovery statutes).)
 
            Defendant moves for terminating
sanctions on the grounds that Plaintiffs failed to comply with the Court’s
April 17, 2023 order compelling Plaintiffs to respond to Defendant’s discovery
requests. Defendant contends that if the Court is inclined to deny Defendant’s
motion for terminating sanctions, Defendant seeks an issue sanctions order
precluding Plaintiffs from presenting evidence of liability and damages. On April
17, 2023, the Court granted Defendant’s motions to compel Plaintiffs to respond
to Form Interrogatories, Set One, Special Interrogatories, Set One, and
Requests for Production, Set One. (04/17/2023 Minute Order.) The Court ordered Plaintiffs
to provide verified responses without objections to the discovery requests
within 20 days. (Id.)
 
            The Court finds terminating
sanctions against Plaintiffs are appropriate. Plaintiffs have failed to respond to discovery requests,
failed to comply with the Court's orders, and failed to oppose this motion for terminating sanctions.
Thus, it appears that Plaintiffs are disinterested in defending this case.
 
Monetary Sanctions 
A notice of
motion must state in writing the grounds upon which it will be made. (Gonzales
v. Superior Court (1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 1542, 1545.) A motion must state
the basis for the motion and the relief sought. (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule
3.1112(d).)  
 
Where
a party willfully disobeys a discovery order, courts have discretion to impose
terminating, issue, evidence, or monetary sanctions.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2023.010(d), (g),
2023.030; R.S. Creative, Inc. v. Creative Cotton, Ltd. (1999) 75
Cal.App.4th 486, 495.) 
 
Monetary
sanctions may be imposed “ordering that one engaging in the misuse of the
discovery process, or any attorney advising that conduct, or both pay the
reasonable expenses, including attorney's fees, incurred by anyone as a result
of that conduct…unless [the Court] finds that the one subject to the sanction
acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the
imposition of the sanction unjust.” 
(Code of Civ. Proc. § 2030.030(a).)
 
Defendant
moves for monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,960.00 against
 Plaintiffs. However, Defendant also further
requests monetary sanctions in the amount of $760.00 on the grounds that
Plaintiffs’ failure to comply with the Court’s order is without substantial
justification. The declaration of Defendant’s counsel, Or Zade, requests
sanctions in the amount of $1,960.00. (Zade Decl. ¶5.) Defendant’s counsel
charges an hourly rate of $180 per hour. (Id. at ¶4.) Counsel claims to
have spent three and a half (3.5) hours preparing this motion, supporting
declaration and exhibits and anticipates spending two and a half (2.5) hours
analyzing Plaintiffs’ opposition and preparing a reply, and spending three and
a half hours (3.5) hours on Amended Motion. (Id. at ¶5.)
Defendant
claims he will incur approximately $1,900.00 in fees, $60.00 in costs, for a total
amount of $1,960.00 relative to this motion. (Id.) 
 
            The Court finds that several
instances of billing were not reasonably incurred. It is also unclear to the
Court why Defendant is seeking an additional $760.00 in monetary sanctions without
attributing where the amount is derived from. Counsel’s billable rate of
$180.00 per hour is reasonable. However, no opposition is filed so Counsel will
not incur 2.5 hours in analyzing the opposition and preparing a reply.
Furthermore, as of this date, an Amended Motion has not been filed with the
Court, so Defendant’s counsel has not incurred 3.5 hours on the Amended Motion.
As a result, a reduction of sanctions is warranted given the motion is
unopposed. The Court notes that Counsel miscalculated the attorney’s fees of
approximately $1,900.00 to equal nine and a half (9.5) hours of time spent on
this matter, but the attorney’s fees should be approximately $1,710.00. Accordingly,
the reward is reduced by 3.5 hours or $630.00. The Court will impose monetary
sanctions against Plaintiffs in the reduced total amount of $690.00. 
 
            Defendant’s motion for terminating sanctions is
GRANTED as to Defendant Gregory Yu, ONLY. 
 
            The
Court awards Defendant Gregory Yu monetary sanctions in the amount of $690.00
against Plaintiffs. 
 
Moving
Party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.            
 
Parties who intend to submit on this tentative
must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed by the
instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive an email
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off
calendar.
