And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer and motion to strike filed by defendant David Campbell against the plaintiff, Barton Wayne Fishback. The plaintiff alleged defamation and libel per se against the defendant based on an email sent to employees of the County of Los Angeles Department of Public Works. The defendant argued that the plaintiff's claim is barred by the statute of limitations and does not state a valid cause of action.

The judge found that the plaintiff did not plead any facts that show an excuse, tolling, or some other basis for avoiding the statutory bar for filing a libel action within one year. Therefore, the judge sustained the demurrer without leave to amend, meaning that the plaintiff's claim is barred by the statute of limitations. The judge also found that the motion to strike is moot because the demurrer has been sustained.

The judge ordered the defendant to give notice of the ruling and noted that parties who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed by the instructions on the court website.
