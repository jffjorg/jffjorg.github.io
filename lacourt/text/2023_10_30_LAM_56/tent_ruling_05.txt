DISCUSSION 
DEMURRER 
            “A demurrer tests the sufficiency of
a complaint as a matter of law.”  (Durell v. Sharp Healthcare (2010) 183
Cal.App.4th 1350, 1358.) “[T]he court gives the complaint a reasonable
interpretation, and treats the demurrer as admitting all material facts
properly pleaded.”  (Id.)  “The court accepts as
true all material factual allegations, giving them a liberal construction, but
it does not consider conclusions of fact or law, opinions, speculation, or
allegations contrary to law or judicially noticed facts.”  (Shea
Homes Limited Partnership v. County of Alameda (2003) 110 Cal.App.4th 1246,
1254.)  In the demurrer context a court
“may also take notice of exhibits attached to the complain[t].”  (Holland
v. Morse Diesel Intern., Inc. (2001) 86 Cal.App.4th 1443, 1447.)  “If facts appearing in the exhibits
contradict those alleged, the facts in the exhibits take precedence.”  (Id.)
 
Issue No. 1: Sole Cause of Action
            Defendant Campbell argues that Plaintiff Fishback’s defamation claim
fails because: (1) it is barred by the statute of limitations and (2) does not
state any legal theory or cause of action. 
            
Statute
of Limitations  
            Defendant Campbell asserts that the
communication at issue occurred on April 22, 2014, but this present action was
not filed until September 28, 2022, more than eight years later. Defendant
Campbell further asserts that even if calculated from the date of discovery of
the subject email, September 16, 2014, Plaintiff Fishback’s present case is
still barred and subject to dismissal. As such, Defendant Campbell asserts that
the cause of action in the TAC fails. 
            
            Under California Code of Civil
Procedure, Section 340(c), within one year an action for libel and slander
must be brought. This statutory bar can be avoided if the plaintiff pleads
facts “which show an excuse, tolling, or some other basis….” (Ponderosa Homes, Inc. v. City of San Ramon (1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 1761, 1768.) Also,
“an important exception to the general rule of accrual is the ‘discovery rule,’
which postpones accrual of a cause of action until the plaintiff discovers, or
has reason to discover, the cause of action.” (WA Southwest 2, LLC v.
First American Title Ins. Co. (2015)
240 Cal.App.4th 148, 156-57.) Plaintiff relying on this discovery rule “must
plead (1) the time and manner of discovery and (2) the inability to have made
earlier discovery despite reasonable diligence.” (Id.)
            
            On the face of the TAC, Plaintiff Fishback alleges that
the email giving rise to this present action was discovered on April 22, 2014.
Plaintiff Fishback does not plead any facts which show an excuse, tolling, or
some other basis for avoiding the statutory bar for filing a libel action
within one year. Plaintiff Fishback’s opposition does not address the arguments
advanced by Defendant Campbell that Plaintiff Fishback’s claim is barred by the
statute of limitations. As such, Plaintiff Fishback has conceded to the
arguments of Defendant Campbell on this point. (Heglin v. F.C.B.A. Market (1945) 70 Cal.App.2d 803, 806.)
 
            Because the TAC’s sole claim is barred by the statute of
limitations, it is not necessary to address Plaintiff’s attack on the demurrer
and motion to strike on other grounds.  Moreover, as this is Plaintiff’s fourth unsuccessful
attempt to allege a valid cause of action that is not barred by the statute of
limitations, the demurrer must be sustained without leave to amend. 
 
            The Demurrer to the TAC is sustained without leave to
amend.  The Motion to Strike is MOOT.
Moving
Party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.            
 


 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed
by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive an email
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off
calendar.
