And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion filed by Defendant FCI Lender Services, Inc. to compel compliance with Rule 2.257 of the California Rules of Court. The motion was filed due to the plaintiff's failure to comply with the rule when filing his complaint, first amended complaint, and objection to declaration of non-monetary status. The plaintiff's signatures on these documents consisted of the symbol "/s/ Daniel A. Bond", which is not compliant with Rule 2.257(b)(1) because it is not unique to the declarant, capable of verification, under the sole control of the declarant, and linked to data in such a manner that if the data are changed, the electronic signature is invalidated. The plaintiff did not file an opposition to the motion, which creates an inference that the motion is meritorious.
