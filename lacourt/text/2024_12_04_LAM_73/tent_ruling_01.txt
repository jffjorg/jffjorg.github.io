TENTATIVE RULING
 
Defendant FCI
Lender Services, Inc.’s Motion to Compel Compliance with Rule 2.257 of the

I. BACKGROUND
 
On September
14, 2024, Plaintiff Daniel A. Bond filed the instant action against Defendants Roger
Anderson, an individual and as Trustee of the RWA Trust Dated March 14, 2014;
Genesee Land, LLC, a Nevada limited liability corporation; Mark Qi Wong, an
individual; FCI Lender Services, Inc., a California corporation; First Faith
Mortgage, a mortgage company; Robert Miller, an individual; and Eric Tran, an
individual. 
 
 On May 30, 2024, Plaintiff filed a First
Amended Complaint (“FAC”) alleging the following causes of action:
1.      Wrongful
Foreclosure 
2.      Violation of
California Homeowner Bill of Rights
3.      Violation of
Foreclosure Consultancy Laws
4.      Violation of
Usury Law
5.      Unfair
Business Practices
6.      Breach of
Fiduciary Duty
7.      Fraud 
8.      Negligence
9.      Cancellation
of Instrument
10.  Declaratory
Relief
11.  Temporary
Restraining Order, Preliminary Injunction, and Permanent Injunction
12.  Intentional
Infliction of Emotional Distress
13.  Negligent
Infliction of Emotional Distress
The FAC alleges the following. Defendants consist of individuals
and entities in the mortgage and hard money lending business who conspired with
each other to make high-interest and high-fee loans to Plaintiff - loans that
they knew and intended that Plaintiff could not pay back so that they could
seize the Plaintiff’s property located at 1095 South Genesee Avenue, Los
Angeles, CA 90019 (“Property”) for a small fraction of its value. Also, even though Plaintiff intended to grant, and did grant, a
security interest in the Property, he did so under false pretenses perpetrated
by Defendants, and Defendants have engaged in fraudulent practices warranting
cancellation of the loan.
On October 17, 2024, Defendant FCI
Lender Services, Inc. filed a Motion to Compel Compliance with Rule 2.257 of
the California Rules of Court
 
No opposition was filed.
 
II. DISCUSSION
Defendant FCI
Lender Services, Inc. (“FCI”) moves this Court for and order compelling
Plaintiff’s compliance with Rule 2.257 of the California Rules of Court. FCI
asserts that Plaintiff’s Complaint filed September 14, 2023, his First Amended
Complaint filed May 30, 2024, and his Objection to Declaration of Non-Monetary
Status filed on October 15, 2024 fail to comply with Rule 2.257. 
Rule 2.257(b)
provides in relevant part that: 
When a
document to be filed electronically provides for a signature under penalty of
perjury of any person, the document is deemed to have been signed by that
person if filed electronically provided that either of the following conditions
is satisfied: 
(1) The
declarant has signed the document using an electronic signature and declares
under penalty of perjury under the laws of the state of California that the
information submitted is true and correct. If the declarant is not the
electronic filer, the electronic signature must be unique to the declarant,
capable of verification, under the sole control of the declarant, and linked to
data in such a manner that if the data are changed, the electronic signature is
invalidated; or
(2) The
declarant, before filing, has physically signed a printed form of the document.
By electronically filing the document, the electronic filer certifies that the
original, signed document is available for inspection and copying at the
request of the court or any other party.
FCI asserts
that Plaintiff’s Complaint filed September 14, 2023, his First Amended
Complaint filed May 30, 2024, and his Objection to Declaration of Non-Monetary
Status were filed by Plaintiff’s attorney. Plaintiff’s signatures on these
documents consist of the symbols “/s/ Daniel A. Bond.” (Exs. 1-3.) However, Plaintiff’s
“/s/” signature is not compliant with Rule 2.257(b)(1) because it is not
“unique to the declarant, capable of verification, under the sole control of
the declarant, and linked to data in such a manner that if the data are
changed, the electronic signature is invalidated.” FCI contends that
Plaintiff’s counsel represented that Plaintiff had never signed a printed form
of the documents. (Cronin Decl., ¶ 6.) Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff has failed
to comply with Rule 2.257.
Plaintiff has
not filed an opposition. “A party who
has not timely filed written opposition to a motion…may not be afforded an
opportunity to offer oral argument at the hearing.” (Sexton v. Superior
Court (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410.) “The failure to file opposition
creates an inference that the motion or demurrer is meritorious.”¿ (Id.)¿
“In such cases, the court may hear argument limited to a request for a
continuance of the hearing in order to afford an opportunity for written
opposition.” (Id.) “[T]he rule is patently intended to prevent the
introduction of legal theories without prior notice to opposing counsel and the
court.” (Id.)
Accordingly, Defendant FCI
Lender Services, Inc.’s Motion to Compel Compliance with Rule 2.257 of the
California Rules of Court is GRANTED. 
 
III. DISPOSITION
 

Defendant
FCI Lender Services, Inc.’s Motion to Compel Compliance with Rule 2.257 of the
California Rules of Court is GRANTED.
