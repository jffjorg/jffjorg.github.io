And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has tentatively ruled in favor of the plaintiff's motion for entry of a stipulated consent judgment. The plaintiff, Ramy Kaufler Eden, brought this action against defendants EDCO Stations, Inc., TABBAA Family Limited Partnership, and TABBA Management Company for their alleged failure to provide clear and reasonable warnings under Proposition 65. The consent judgment requires the defendants to provide the "safe harbor" warning for service stations at the subject service station, located at 5050 E. Olympic Blvd., Los Angeles, California 90022. The court finds that the injunctive relief complies with Proposition 65, the attorneys' fees are reasonable, and the civil penalties are reasonable. The court grants the motion and approves the consent judgment.
