And here is the English text summary:

The proposed tentative ruling is regarding a motion to compel responses to form interrogatories and a request for sanctions against Yon Lai and his attorney, Allyson Thompson. The motion was filed by Plaintiff Karen Flores on October 2, 2023, and an opposition was filed by Defendant on November 22, 2023. The Plaintiff alleges that the Defendant failed to timely respond to discovery requests and seeks verified responses to her discovery requests. The Court finds that the motion is moot since the Plaintiff has received verified responses to her discovery requests on November 13, 2023. The Court also declines to impose sanctions against the Defendant, finding that the imposition of sanctions would be unjust. The Court encourages the parties to use the Court's Informal Discovery Conference program to resolve disputes in the future.
