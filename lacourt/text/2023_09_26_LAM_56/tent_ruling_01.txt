            MOVING
PARTY: Plaintiff
 
            RESPONDING
PARTY: Defendant The Board of Trustees of the California State University
(“Defendant”)
 
            The
Court has considered the moving, opposition and reply papers.  
 
BACKGROUND
This action arises out of an employment
relationship.  The currently operative
second amended complaint (the “SAC”) alleges: (1) discrimination; (2)
harassment; (3) retaliation; (4) failure to prevent, investigate and remedy harassment and
discrimination; (5) whistleblower retaliation; and (6)
reprisal/retaliation.  
On July 18,
2023, Plaintiff filed a motion to seal portions of documents that were filed as
evidence in support of Defendant’s motion for summary judgment
(the “Motion”).  
 
DISCUSSION
Under California
Rules of Court (“CRC”), rule 2.550 (c), unless confidentiality is
required by law, court records are presumed to be open.  (CRC, r. 2.550 (c).) 
Subject to certain exceptions, a court record must not be filed under seal
without a court order.  (Overstock.com, Inc. v. Goldman Sachs Group,
Inc. (2014) 231 Cal.App.4th 471, 486.)  A party requesting that a
record be filed under seal must file a motion or an application for an order
sealing the record.  (CRC, r. 2.551
(b).)  The motion or
application must be accompanied by a memorandum and
a declaration containing facts sufficient to justify the
sealing.  (Id.)  In order for
records to be sealed, a trial court must hold a hearing and expressly find
that: (1) there exists an overriding interest supporting closure and/or
sealing; (2) there is a substantial probability that the interest will be
prejudiced absent closure and/or sealing; (3) the proposed closure and/or
sealing is narrowly tailored to serve the overriding interest; and (4) there is
no less restrictive means of achieving the overriding interest.  (Universal
City Studios, Inc. v. Superior Court (2003) 110 Cal.App.4th 1273,
1279.)  Since court records are public records, the burden rests on the
party seeking to deny public access to those records to establish compelling
reasons why and to what extent these records should be made private.  (Mary
R. v. B. & R. Corp. (1983) 149 Cal.App.3d 308, 317.)  
 
 
            The Motion concerns three documents,
and Plaintiff’s arguments appear to be limited to redacting the identifying
information of third parties.  Defendant
objects to the wholesale sealing of the identified documents but does not
contest the propriety of redacting certain identifying information.  The redaction of third parties’ identifying
information is consistent with the discussion regarding the confidentiality
designations and sealing of documents in the Court’s June 21, 2023 and July 13,
2023 orders.  Based on the undisputed
privacy interests of third parties named in the documents, the Court GRANTS the
Motion.  The sealing order is limited to
the redaction of identifying information about third parties.
 
Moving party is ordered to give notice
of this ruling.
 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed
by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive an email
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off
calendar.
