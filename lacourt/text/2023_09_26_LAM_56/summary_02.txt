## English Summary

In this case, Clifford Dejong is suing American Honda Motor Co., Inc.  over the sale of a defective vehicle. The court previously ordered American Honda to produce more documents as part of the discovery process. Dejong now argues that American Honda did not fully comply with that order. 

The judge agrees in part, finding that American Honda's responses were insufficient. The judge has ordered American Honda to provide any remaining documents and clarify which documents, if any, they are withholding. 


The judge also criticized Dejong for not making a good faith effort to resolve the issue before filing the motion.  While the judge granted the motion, they denied requests from both sides for monetary sanctions.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel compliance with a previous court order. The motion was filed by the plaintiff, Clifford Dejong, who is suing American Honda Motor Co., Inc. and others for allegedly selling a defective vehicle. The court order in question required the defendant to produce further responses to the plaintiff's requests for production. The defendant failed to comply with the order, and the plaintiff is seeking to compel the defendant to produce the requested documents.

The judge grants the motion in part, ordering the defendant to produce any unproduced supplemental documents and provide statements of compliance that specify if and what documents have been withheld due to objections. The judge also denies the plaintiff's and defendant's requests for monetary sanctions.

The judge notes that the plaintiff's meet and confer effort was minimal, and it appears that the defendant has not produced any further documents despite the court order. The judge also expresses uncertainty about whether the defendant has withheld any documents to which it objects.

The judge orders the defendant to comply with the court's order within 20 days and denies the requests for monetary sanctions. The parties are advised to email the court if they intend to submit on this tentative ruling.
