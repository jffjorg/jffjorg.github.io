And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to seal documents filed by the plaintiff, Patrick Krug. The motion seeks to seal three documents that contain identifying information of third parties. The defendant, The Board of Trustees of the California State University, objects to the wholesale sealing of the documents but does not contest the propriety of redacting certain identifying information. The judge grants the motion, ordering the redaction of identifying information about third parties. The judge finds that the privacy interests of the third parties outweigh any potential public interest in accessing the documents. The judge also notes that the redaction of identifying information is consistent with previous court orders regarding confidentiality designations and sealing of documents.
