Judge Holly J. Fujie issued a tentative ruling on Plaintiff Patrick Krug's motion to seal portions of documents related to Defendant, The Board of Trustees of the California State University's motion for summary judgment.  The Court found that while court records are generally open,  Krug's request to redact identifying information of third parties in the documents is justified to protect their privacy. Therefore, the judge granted the motion to seal, but only to the extent of redacting identifying information. The court emphasized that the sealing order is narrowly tailored to serve the overriding interest of protecting third-party privacy.
