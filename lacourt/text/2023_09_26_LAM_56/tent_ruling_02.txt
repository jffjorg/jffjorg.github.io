MOVING PARTY: Plaintiff

 
RESPONDING PARTY:
Defendant American Honda Motor Co., Inc. (“Defendant”)
 
            The Court has considered the moving,
opposition and reply papers.   
 
BACKGROUND
            This action arises out of the sale of an allegedly
defective vehicle (the “Vehicle”) that was manufactured by Defendant.  The currently operative first amended
complaint (the “FAC”) alleges: (1) violation of Civil Code section 1793.2,
subdivision (d); (2) violation of Civil Code section 1793.2, subdivision (b);
(3) violation of Civil Code section 1793.2, subdivision (a)(3); and (4) breach
of the implied warranty of merchantability.
On May 8, 2023, the Court issued an order
compelling Defendant to produce further responses to Plaintiff’s Requests for
Production (“RFP”), Set One.  On June 30,
2023, Plaintiff filed a motion to compel compliance with the Court’s May 8,
2023 order (the “Motion”). 
 
DISCUSSION
Under California Code of Civil Procedure
(“CCP”) section 2031.310, subdivision (c), a motion to compel further responses
to a demand for inspection or production of documents may be brought based on:
(1) incomplete statements of compliance; (2) inadequate, evasive or incomplete
claims of inability to comply; or (3) unmerited or overly generalized
objections.  (CCP § 2031.310, subd.
(c).)  If a party fails to obey an order
compelling further response, the court may make those orders that are just,
including the imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a
terminating sanction.  (CCP § 2031.310,
subd. (i).)  
 
A statement that the party to whom a demand for
inspection, copying, testing, or sampling has been directed will comply with
the particular demand shall state that the production, inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling, and related activity demanded, will be allowed either in
whole or in part, and that all documents or things in the demanded category
that are in the possession, custody, or control of that party and to which no
objection is being made will be included in the production.  (CCP § 2031.220.)  If only part of an item or category of item
in a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is objectionable, the
response shall contain a statement of compliance, or a representation of
inability to comply with respect to the remainder of that item or
category.  (CCP § 2031.240, subd.
(a).)  If the responding party objects to the demand for
inspection, copying, testing, or sampling of an item or category of item, the
response shall do both of the following: (1) identify with particularity any document,
tangible thing, land, or electronically stored information falling within any
category of item in the demand to which an objection is being made; and (2) set
forth clearly the extent of, and the specific ground for, the objection.  (CCP § 2031.240, subd. (b).)  If an
objection is based on a claim of privilege, the particular privilege invoked
shall be stated.  (Id.)
 
            The
Court’s May 8, 2023 order directed Defendant to produce further responses to
RFPs regarding five categories of documents and to produce statements of
compliance in accordance with CCP section 2031.220.  Defendant served unverified supplemental
responses on May 26, 2023.  (Declaration
of Alexus B. Ringstad (“Ringstad Decl.”) ¶ 4.) 
On June 29, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel sent a meet and confer letter to
Defendant’s counsel regarding the sufficiency of the supplemental
responses.  (Ringstadt Decl., Exhibit
3.)  Defendant sent verifications on June
30, 2023.  (Declaration of Adjoa M.
Anim-Appiah (“Anim-Appiah Decl.”) ¶ 6, Exhibit D.)  
 
            The
Court observes that Plaintiff’s meet and confer effort was negligible based on
the proximity of the June 29, 2023 letter and the June 30, 2023 filing of the
Motion.  Nonetheless, it appears that no
further documents have been produced (although the Court is unable to determine
if the lack of further production is because Defendant previously produced all
relevant documents).  In addition, while
Defendant’s statements of compliance incorporate the language of CCP section 2031.220,
it is unclear whether Defendant has withheld any documents to which it
objects.  (See CCP § 2031.240.)
 
 
            Based
on the foregoing, the Court GRANTS the Motion in part.  Defendant is ordered to produce any
unproduced supplemental documents and provide statements of compliance that
specify if/what documents have been withheld pursuant to an objection within 20
days of the date of this order. 
Plaintiff’s and Defendant’s requests for monetary sanctions are DENIED. 
 
Moving party is ordered to give notice of
this ruling. 
 
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org
as directed by the instructions provided on the court website at
www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive an email and there
are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off
calendar.
