And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The Court grants the motion for a protective order filed by defendants Armando Berriz and Berriz Law Group, PC, limiting the number of special interrogatories that plaintiff The Law Offices of Jacob Emrani, APC can serve. The Court finds that plaintiff's propounding of 277 special interrogatories is excessive and unreasonable, and that the defendant's contention that the interrogatories are unwarranted is justified. The Court orders plaintiff to limit its interrogatories to 35 per defendant, and sanctions plaintiff and counsel Rodrigo Suarez $3,300 for their unsuccessful opposition to the motion.
