The court finds that the subpoena is valid and enforceable, and that Sunlight Financial, LLC is subject to personal jurisdiction in California. The court rejects Sunlight Financial, LLC's arguments that the subpoena is invalid because it is not "process" and that the court lacks jurisdiction over the documents at issue. The court also rejects Sunlight Financial, LLC's objections based on the lack of notice to consumers and the alleged undue burden of producing electronically stored information. The court orders Sunlight Financial, LLC to comply with the subpoena within 30 days.
