And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied a motion by Miles to renew or reconsider a prior decision denying a motion for summary judgment. The prior judge recused themselves due to a conflict of interest, and the current judge questioned whether they had jurisdiction to reconsider the decision. The judge found that they did have jurisdiction, but denied the motion for several reasons. Firstly, the motion was filed over two years after the prior decision, which is outside the 10-day limit for renewing a motion. Even if the 10-day limit did not apply, the judge found that the motion was not made with reasonable diligence. Secondly, the judge reviewed the moving papers and found that they were not sufficient to shift the burden of proof. Finally, the judge disagreed with Miles' arguments that Mashian's firm had personal knowledge of facts, but verified on information and belief, and that the two contracts were hermetically sealed from each other. The judge found that the contracts were related and that there was consideration for both agreements.
