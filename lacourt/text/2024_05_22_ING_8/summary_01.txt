And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The Court will hear arguments on May 22, 2024, regarding several motions, including Westmoreland's motion for sanctions, motions to compel further responses to discovery requests, and a motion to compel an in-person deposition of the plaintiff. The Court is inclined to order both counsel to attend an in-person meet and confer session to resolve the discovery disputes. The Court finds that the number and persistence of these disputes are disproportionate to the modest amount in controversy. The Court cites cases emphasizing the importance of civility in the legal profession and the negative impact of incivility on the profession.
