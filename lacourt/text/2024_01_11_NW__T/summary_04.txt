And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for relief from waiver. The motion is granted in part, allowing the moving party to seek relief from waiver only with regards to attorney-client communications. The motion is denied in all other aspects, as the responses filed by the responding party were not in substantial compliance with the required Code language. The Judge also finds that there is no evidence of excusable neglect and that the responding party did not provide sufficient explanation for the delay. The Judge orders the clerk to notify all parties of the ruling.
