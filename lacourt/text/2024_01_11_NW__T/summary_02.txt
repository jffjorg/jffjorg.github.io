The plaintiff, Brennan Cameron, sued the defendants for negligence arising from a car accident. The defendants' counsel, Brian S.

The court grants the motion, finding that the defendants are acting in good faith and that the cross-complaint concerns issues and parties already at issue in the action. The proposed cross-complaint must be filed within 20 days.
