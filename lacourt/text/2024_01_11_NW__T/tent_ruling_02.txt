 Case Number:  23VECV03056    Hearing Date:   January 11, 2024    Dept:  T 23VECV03056 BRENNAN CAMERON vs AXEL SEIFER[TENTATIVE] ORDER:  The Motion for Leave to File a Cross-Complaint is GRANTED.Introduction Plaintiff Brennan Cameron sues defendants Axel Seifert, The Seifert Group, Inc., and DOES 1 through 50, inclusive, (collectively, “Defendants”) for negligence arising out of a car accident. Defendants move for leave to file a cross-complaint.DiscussionDefendants advance the declaration of their counsel, Brian S. Dewey, who states that he was not aware that Defendant had retained counsel of his own to file a complaint for damages, and that on November 3, 2023, he received a call from defendant Alex Seifert’s counsel stating that he was going to file a claim for personal injury damages. (Decl. Dewey, ¶ 2.) It was at this time that Dewey’s office was notified that it should have filed a cross-complaint at the time of the filing of the answer to Plaintiff’s complaint. (Ibid.) Defendants further assert that the cross-complaint concerns issues and parties already at issue in the action, and that the basis for the cross-complaint arises out of the same auto accident. (Mot, pg. 4.) Leave must be granted to file a compulsory cross-complaint when the defendant is acting in good faith. (See Code Civ. Proc. § 426.50.)  No opposition was filed. Defendants’ motion is granted.  The proposed cross-complaint shall be filed within 20 days.
