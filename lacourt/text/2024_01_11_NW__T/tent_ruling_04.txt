 Case Number:  LC084069    Hearing Date:   January 11, 2024    Dept:  T LC084069 RICHARD WALTERS, ET AL. VS VASSAL BENFORD
Tentative ruling: Motion for relief from waiver
Granted in part as to attorney client communications only.  Otherwise, denied.
In seeking relief, the moving party must serve the late responses in substantial compliance.  The responses were not in substantial compliance as the responses fail to use Code compliant language.  Regardless of whether the documents are going to be produced, they need to be identifed as to whether there are or were responsive documents, who has possession of them, if they no longer exist, why, etc.
Because the responses were not in substantial compliance and are not Code compliant, the motion is denied except as to attorney client privilege in that there is no evidence by responding party of a knowing waiver.
Additionally, the explanation given does not show excusable neglect.  There is no explanation of who was reviewing the email, or whether the email was provided.
Clerk to give notice.
