And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to quash service of the summons and complaint. The defendant, Lani Hay, argued that the service by publication was defective because the plaintiff knew her address was ascertainable. However, the judge found that the plaintiff had attempted to serve the defendant by certified mail and in person, but the defendant had evaded service. The judge also found that the plaintiff's application to serve the defendant by publication was proper because it could not "with reasonable diligence" serve the defendant in another manner. As a result, the defendant's motion was denied, and she is ordered to file a responsive pleading to the complaint within 20 days of the order.
