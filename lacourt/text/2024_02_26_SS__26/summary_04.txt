Summary in English:

The tentative ruling is a denial of the defendants' motion for judgment on the pleadings. The defendants, LA Housing Solutions, LLC, Peerless Apartments, LLC, and Marc A. Schneider, argued that the parties executed a Mutual Release and Lease Termination Agreement, which bars the plaintiff's claim under Civil Code section 1950.5. However, the court finds that the release agreement does not cover the claim because it excludes claims brought under Civil Code section 1950.5. Additionally, the court notes that the defendants have failed to show that the plaintiff received an itemized statement detailing a lawful basis for the retention of the security deposit, which is a violation of Civil Code section 1950.5. Therefore, the defendants' motion is denied, and they are ordered to file and serve an answer to the first amended complaint within 20 days.
