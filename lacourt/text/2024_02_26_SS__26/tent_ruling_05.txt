ANALYSIS:
 
Plaintiff Douglas Melson (“Plaintiff”) propounded Form
Interrogatories, Set One, Requests for Production of Documents, Set One, and
Requests for Admission, Set One, on Defendant Mario Gonzalez, Jr. (“Defendant”)
on September 26, 2023. (Motions, Piazza, Jr. Decl., Exhs. A.) Despite a meet
and confer effort, to date, no responses have been served. (Id. at ¶¶6-9
and Exh. B.) 
 
Plaintiff filed the instant (1) Motion To Compel Responses
To Form Interrogatories, Set One, and Request For Sanctions; (2) Motion To
Compel Responses To Request for Production of Documents, Set One, and Request
For Sanctions; and (3) Motion To Deem Requests For Admission, Set One, Admitted
and Request For Sanctions on January 17. To date, no opposition has been filed.

 
Discussion
 
Based on Defendant’s failure to serve initial responses, the
Motions to compel responses to interrogatories and request for production, and
to deem admissions admitted are granted. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290;
2031.300; 2033.280.) There is no requirement for a prior meet and confer effort
before a motion to compel initial responses or deem admissions admitted can be
filed. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290; 2031.300; 2033.280.) Further, the motions
can be brought at any time after the responding party fails to provide the
responses. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290; 2031.300; 2033.280.) Therefore,
Plaintiff is entitled to an order compelling Defendant to serve verified
responses to the interrogatories and requests for production without
objections. The Court also deems the requests for admission admitted against
Defendant. 
 
Defendant’s failure to timely respond to the requests
constitutes a misuse of the discovery process. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010,
subd. (d).) Sanctions are appropriate under Code of Civil Procedure sections
2033.280, 2023.010 and 2023.030 and have been properly noticed. Therefore, the
requests for sanctions are granted against Defendant and counsel of record in
the total amount of $930.00 based on three hours of attorney time billed at $250.00
an hour, plus $180.00 in costs. (Motions, Piazza, Jr. Decl., ¶12.) The
sanctions are to be paid within 20 days’ service of this order.
 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiff Douglas Melson’s (1) Motion Compelling Responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One, and for Monetary Sanctions; (2) Motion
Compelling Responses to Request
for Production of Documents, Set One, and for Monetary Sanctions; and (3) Motion
Deeming Requests for Admission, Set One, Admitted, and for Monetary Sanctions,
are GRANTED. DEFENDANT MARIO GONZALEZ, JR. IS TO SERVE VERIFIED
RESPONSES WITHOUT OBJECTION TO THE INTERROGATORIES AND REQUESTS FOR PRODUCTION WITHIN
20 DAYS’ SERVICE OF THIS ORDER. DEFENDANT AND COUNSEL OF RECORD ARE JOINTLY AND
SEVERALLY ORDERED TO PAY SANCTIONS OF $930.00 TO PLAINTIFF’S COUNSEL WITHIN 20
DAYS’ SERVICE OF THIS ORDER.
