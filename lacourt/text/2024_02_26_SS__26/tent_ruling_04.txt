ANALYSIS:
 
Plaintiff
Gizella Wade (“Plaintiff”) filed the instant action for habitability
violations, nuisance, negligence, and breach of contract against Defendants LA
Housing Solutions, LLC, Peerless Apartments, LLC, and Marc A. Schneider
(“Defendants”) on April 10, 2023. Defendants filed a Demurrer to, and Motion to
Strike Portions of, the Complaint on May 15, 2023. The Demurrer was sustained
with leave to amend on September 14, 2023 and the Motion to Strike was placed
off calendar. (Minute Order, 09/14/23.)
 
Plaintiff filed
the First Amended Complaint on October 2, 2023, alleging a single cause of
action for bad faith retention of security deposit in violation of Civil Code
section 1950.5. Defendants filed the instant Motion for Judgment on the
Pleadings on January 25, 2024. Plaintiff filed an untimely opposition on
February 20, 2024; the filing deadline was February 9, 2024. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 1005, subd. (b).) Nor is the opposition accompanied by a proof of service
demonstrating that it was served on Defendants, as required by the notice
statute. (Ibid.) Accordingly, the Court will not consider the opposition
papers. 
 
Discussion
 
The First Amended Complaint alleges that Plaintiff was a tenant of
231 North La Peer Drive #106, Beverly Hills California (“the Premises”)
pursuant to a lease agreement with Defendant LA Housing Solutions, LLC. (FAC, ¶7.)
The monthly rental rate was $3,598.00 for a period of one year, with the term
to begin on August 11, 2022. (Ibid.) Plaintiff provided the sum of $6,396.00
as a security deposit. (Id. at ¶8.) Pursuant to an agreement for early
termination of the lease, Plaintiff vacated the Premises on November 3, 2022. (Id.
at ¶9.) Although more than nine months have passed since Plaintiff vacated the
Premises, the First Amended Complaint alleges that “Defendants have failed and
refused, and continues to fail and refuse, to provide Plaintiff with an
itemized statement detailing a lawful basis for Defendant’s retention of said
sums of Plaintiff’s security deposit, and the amount of any security received
and the disposition of the security, and has also failed and refused, to return
the said sums of the security deposit given to them by the Plaintiff despite
several demands to Defendants.” (Id. at ¶11.) This failure by Defendants
violates Civil Code section 1950.5(l). (Id. at ¶¶10, 12.) As a result of
the violation, Plaintiff has suffered actual damages in the amount of
$5,515.80. (Id. at ¶13.) 
 
The Motion is accompanied by a meet and
confer declaration as required by Code of Civil Procedure section 438. (Motion,
Tatikian Decl., ¶¶2-4 and Exhs. 1-2.) In support of the Motion, Defendants request that the Court take judicial
notice of the following documents: (1) the Mutual Release agreement, executed
on October 24, 2022; (2) Email correspondence from Plaintiff to Defendant
Schneider on December 6, 2022 advising that she received her security deposit;
and (3) Plaintiff’s verified responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One.
The Court takes judicial notice of the
documents pursuant to Cal. Evidence Code section 452, subdivisions (g) and (h).
(See Chacon v. Union Pacific Railroad (2020) 56 Cal.App.5th 565,
573 [holding that “The existence and contents of a written agreement may be the
proper subject of judicial notice if there is no factual dispute that the
document is genuine and accurate.”].) 
 
Defendants move for judgment on the pleadings on the grounds that the
parties executed a Mutual Release and Lease Termination Agreement (“the Release
Agreement”) pursuant to which Plaintiff agreed to release Defendants from any
and all obligations arising from the lease and tenancy. Under the Release
Agreement Plaintiff “agree[d] to release Beverly Hills Apartments LLC, LA
Housing Solutions LLC, and all related entities and owners, from any and all
obligations arising from the lease and tenancy following her move-out on
October 31, 2022.” (Motion, RJN, Exh. A.) The Release also states that “the
undersigned” is subject to a waiver of rights under Civil Code section 1542,
which protects the releasing party against the release of claims they do not
know or suspect to exist at the time of signing. (Ibid; Civ. Code, §
1542.) 
 
Defendants first argue that the Release Agreement covers all the claims
in this action because it includes a broad general release of “any claims
arising out of, based upon, or relating to, any and all claims arising from the
parties’ landlord tenant dispute, which alleged liability is disputed and
denied.” (Motion, RJN, Exh. A.) The Release Agreement also includes a waiver of
rights under Civil Code section 1542, barring claims of which the parties were
unaware at the time the Release Agreement was executed. (Ibid.) However,
the Release Agreement expressly excludes claims brought pursuant to Civil Code
section 1950.5 from its terms. (Ibid.) As the First Amended Complaint is
brought solely under Civil Code section 1950.5, Defendants have not shown from
the face of the First Amended Complaint and the request for judicial notice
that they are subject to the Release Agreement and the waiver of rights. 
 
Next, Defendants point out that Plaintiff’s email communication dated
December 6, 2022 and verified responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One, to
argue that Plaintiff admits receipt of the security deposit on December 2, 2022.
(Motion, RJN, Exh. B and Exh. C, pp. 4-5.) These documents, however, also fail
to show that the claim under Civil Code section 1950.5 is barred. Plaintiff’s
email states that she received the deposit on December 2, 2022. (Id. at
Exh. B.) This was not within 21 days of the alleged date Plaintiff vacated the
apartment, November 3, 2022. (FAC, ¶9.) The email also does not indicate that
Plaintiff received an itemized statement detailing a lawful basis for
Defendant’s retention of said sums of Plaintiff’s security deposit, and the
amount of any security received and the disposition of the security, which are
also alleged violations of Civil Code section 1950.5, subdivision (1). Indeed,
Plaintiff’s interrogatory responses expressly reiterate these violations. (Id.
at Exh. C, p. 4, Response 17.1.) 
 
Therefore, Defendants have not demonstrated the existence of judicially
noticeable facts that contradict the allegations in the First Amended Complaint
or otherwise bar Plaintiff from alleging a claim under Civil Code section
1950.5.

Housing Solutions, LLC, Peerless Apartments, LLC, and Marc A. Schneider’s Motion
for Judgment on the Pleadings is DENIED. DEFENDANTS ARE TO FILE AND SERVE AN
ANSWER TO THE FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT WITHIN 20 DAYS OF THIS ORDER.
