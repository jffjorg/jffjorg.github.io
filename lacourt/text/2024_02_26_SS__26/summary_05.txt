And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motions to compel responses to interrogatories and requests for production, and to deem requests for admission admitted. The defendant, Mario Gonzalez, Jr., is required to serve verified responses to the interrogatories and requests for production without objection within 20 days of the order. The judge has also ordered the defendant and their counsel to pay sanctions of $930.00 to the plaintiff's counsel within 20 days. The judge's ruling is based on the defendant's failure to serve initial responses and to timely respond to the plaintiff's discovery requests, which constitutes a misuse of the discovery process.
