(Insurance Code, § 10139.5(a).)
 
            Pursuant to
a personal injury settlement, Daniel Rivera  (“Transferor” or “Payee”) is entitled to
certain structured settlement payments. 
 
Rivera, as Transferor, and
Petitioner J Stone Street Originations, LLC have entered into a Purchase
Agreement, whereby Transferor agrees to transfer future payments totaling $254,061.60,
consisting of 240 payment of $1,058.59 each, beginning on January 1, 2038 and
ending on December 1, 2057, in exchange for a purchase price of $10,000.
(Amended Petition, Exh. A.)
 
The discounted present value of the amount
being sold is $79,001.63, calculated by applying the 5.20% discount rate
utilized by the Internal Revenue Service to value annuities in probate
proceedings. The purchase price was calculated using a discount rate of 16.20%.
If Transferor did not sell the right to receive structured settlement payments
but instead borrowed the net amount of $10,000.00 and paid that loan back in
installments with each of the payments transferor is now selling, the
equivalent interest rate would be 16.20%. (Amended Petition, Exh. A.)
 
All of this information has been properly
disclosed to the Transferor by way of the disclosure form in compliance with
Insurance Code § 10136, as required by § 10139.5(a)(3). (Amended
Petition, Exh. B.) Transferor was advised in writing to seek
independent professional advice, both legal and financial. (Id.) Transferor chose not to seek such
advice. (Amended Petition, Exh. E.)  The
Petitioner has complied with the disclosure requirements. (Ins. Code, §
10139.5(a)(2).)
 
The transfer agreement (Amended Petition, Exh.
A) complies with Insurance Code §§ 10136 and 10138 [§ 10139.5(a)(3)]; the
transfer does not contravene any applicable statute or order of any court or
other governmental authority (Ins. Code, § 10139.5(a)(4)). 
 
A copy of the relevant portion of the annuity
contract (summary) was attached, as required by Ins. Code § 10139.5(f)(2)(E). (Amended
Petition, Exh. C.)
 
A copy of the qualified assignment agreement was
submitted as required by Ins. Code § 10139.5(f)(2)(F). (Amended Petition, Exh.
C.)
 
A copy of the underlying structured settlement
agreement was attached as required by Ins. Code § 10139.5(f)(2)(G). (Amended
Petition, Exh. D.)

best interest of the Payee/Transferor, taking into account the welfare and
support of any dependents. (Ins. Code, § 10139.5(a)(1) & (b)(1) - (15).)  The Payee/Transferor understands the terms of
the transfer agreement, including those set forth in the § 10136 disclosure
statement (Ins. Code, § 10139.5(a)(5)).)

and election not to cancel the transfer agreement. (Rivera Decl., ¶ 16;
