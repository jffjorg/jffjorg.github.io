[1]              The motion was filed (and served
via email) on May 3, 2024, for a May 29, 2024 hearing, which reflects
insufficient Code of Civil Procedure §§ 1005, subdivision (b) (sixteen court
days’ notice) and 1010.6, subdivision (a)(3)(B) (two additional court days’
notice for electronic service) notice. Monday, May 27, 2024 is a court holiday
and is thus excluded for purposes of calculating notice. The motion was timely
filed, but should have been electronically served no later than May 2, 2024.
With that said, Plaintiffs has filed a substantive opposition: “It is well
settled that the appearance of a party at the hearing of a motion and his or
her opposition to the motion on its merits is a waiver of any defects or
irregularities in the notice of the motion.” (Tate v. Superior Court
(1975) 45 Cal.App.3d 925, 930.). The court, then, will proceed to rule on the
merits of the motion.


[2]              Huang has not sought mandatory
relief pursuant to an attorney affidavit of fault. Huang’s memorandum of points
and authorities, in fact, disavows any fault of counsel, reading “[o]ur law
firm suffered excusable neglect because we failed to properly calendar two case
management conference hearings, but through no fault of its own. . .”
(Motion, 8:22-23 [emphasis added].) Huang also blames Plaintiff for “fail[ing]
to provide proper notice.” (Id., 9:21). Pursuant to Luri v. Greenwald
(2003) 107 Cal.App.4th 1119, 1124, “[a] motion under section 473 for
discretionary relief accompanied by a declaration of an attorney suggesting
attorney fault does not require the trial court to grant relief under the
mandatory provision of section 473.”
