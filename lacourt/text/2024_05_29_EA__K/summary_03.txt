And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The Judge's tentative ruling is based on the information presented before today. The motion was filed electronically on May 3, 2024, which is sufficient, but should have been served earlier. The Judge notes that the appearance of the party at the hearing and their opposition to the motion waives any defects in the notice of the motion. The Judge will proceed to rule on the merits of the motion, taking into account the discretionary relief under section 473. The Judge also refers to two California court cases, Tate v. Superior Court and Luri v. Greenwald, and California Code of Civil Procedure sections 1005, 1010.6, and 473. The Judge notes that Huang's law firm suffered excusable neglect due to failure to properly calendar case management conference hearings, and also blames the plaintiff for failing to provide proper notice.
