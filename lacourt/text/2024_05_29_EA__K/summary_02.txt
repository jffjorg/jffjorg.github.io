And here is the English summary:

The Judge has denied the motion to set aside the entry of default and default judgment filed by Mao Lun Huang. Huang's counsel, Matthew Mullhofer, claimed that the law firm had an office in Irvine, California, but due to a mail issue, several correspondences were lost. The firm relocated to a new address, but still experienced mail issues. Additionally, the Judge found that Huang's counsel failed to appear at several case management conferences and the default prove-up hearing. The Judge concluded that these failures did not constitute excusable neglect warranting relief.
