  Case Number:  21PSCV00427    Hearing Date:   May 29, 2024    Dept:  K Defendant Xi Lin’s Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings
is DENIED. 
Background   
Case No. 21PSCV00427
Plaintiff Yongyi Liu (“Liu”) alleges as follows:
Liu is the equitable owner and is in
possession and control of the real property located at 636 East Boxwood Lane,
Azusa, California 91702 (“subject property”). On or about August 18, 2005, Liu
and Feng Li (“F. Li”) F. Li had a child, Meixi Li (“Meixi”). At the time Meixi
was born and to date, F. Li was and has been married to another woman. On July
27, 2012, F. Li purchased and gifted the subject property to Liu to help Liu
since she was raising Meixi by herself. Prior to and upon closing of the escrow
of the subject property, F. Li told Liu that he had purchased the subject
property for her and was giving it to her. F. Li told Liu he would transfer
title to the subject property at a future time. In or about early August 2012,
shortly before escrow closed on the subject property, F. Li asked Liu to come
to the United States with him so that he could transfer title on the subject
property from him to her and give possession of same to her. Liu came with her
mom, her other daughter Helin Xu (“Xu”), and Meixi and took possession of the
subject property; however, due to an unexpected event, F. Li had to return to
China before the transfer paperwork was completed. 
 
In or about December 2013, F. Li came to the
United States for a short trip; Liu was then in China. F. Li promised to
transfer title to the subject property to Liu when they were both in the United
States. In or about April 2014, F. Li was incarcerated in China on a 13-year
sentence. F. Li remains incarcerated. On March 27, 2021, while still
incarcerated, F. Li purportedly signed a grant deed granting the subject
property to Sunnyland International Group (“Sunnyland”). 
 
On or about April 14, 2021, F. Li sent a
Notice to Quit to Liu’s address in China, claiming therein that the subject
property was owned jointly by him and his wife, Jing Li (“J. Li”), and that
they had sold same to a third party. On April 16, 2021, Xi Lin (“Lin”) went to
Liu’s house and told Xu that Lin was the president of Sunnyland and demanded
possession of the subject property. Lin represented to Xu that F. Li had
transferred title of the subject property to Sunnyland to settle a loan he owed
to the company and placed a Notice to Quit on the front door of the subject
property. On April 26, 2021, Xu served a 30-day Notice to Terminate Tenancy at
Will on Liu. 
On May 21, 2021, Liu filed a complaint, asserting causes of action
against Sunnyland, Lin, F. Li, J. Li and Does 1-50 for:
1.                 
Quiet
Title
2.                 
Cancellation
of Instrument
3.

On August 19, 2021, the court related and consolidated this case with
Case No. 21WCUD00362 and designated this case as the lead case.
On September 30, 2021, Sunnyland filed a cross-complaint, asserting
causes of action against Liu, F. Li and M. Li for:

Declaratory
Relief
2.                 
Quiet
Title
3.

4.

On April 11, 2024, an “Order Entering Default Against Defendants Feng Li
and Jing Li” was entered.
The Final Status Conference is set for November 1, 2024. Trial is set for
November 8, 2024.
Case No. 21WCUD00362
This is an unlawful detainer action regarding the subject property. On
June 10, 2021, Sunnyland filed a complaint for unlawful detainer against Xu,
Liu and Does 1-10.
On August 19, 2021, the court related and consolidated Case No.
21PSCV0042 with this case and designated Case No. 21PSCV0042 as the lead case.
Legal
Standard
The rules
governing demurrers are generally applicable to a motion for judgment on the
pleadings. (Cloud v. Northrop Grumman
Corp. (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 995, 999; Code Civ. Proc., § 438, subd. (d)
[“The grounds for motion. . . shall appear on the face of the challenged
pleading or from any matter of which the court is required to take judicial
notice. Where the motion is based on a matter of which the court may take
judicial notice. . ., the matter shall be specified in the notice of motion, or
in the supporting points and authorities, except as the court may otherwise
permit”].)
A motion by a
plaintiff may only be made on the grounds “that the complaint states facts
sufficient to constitute a cause or causes of action against the defendant and
the answer does not state facts sufficient to constitute a defense to the
complaint.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 438, subd. (c)(1)(A).) A motion by a defendant
may only be made on the grounds that (1) “[t]he court has no jurisdiction of
the subject of the cause of action alleged in the complaint” or (2) “[t]he
complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action
against that defendant.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 438, subd. (c).)
Although a
nonstatutory motion “may be made at any time either prior to the trial or at
the trial itself” (Stoops v. Abbassi
(2002) 100 Cal.App.4th 644, 650 [quotation marks and citation omitted]), a statutory
motion cannot be made after entry of a pretrial conference order or 30 days
before the initial trial date, whichever is later, unless the court otherwise
permits. (Code Civ. Proc., § 438, subd. (e).)
Discussion
Lin moves the court,
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 438, for judgment on the pleadings as to
Liu’s complaint.
Request for Judicial Notice
The court rules on Lin’s Request for Judicial Notice (“RJN”)
as follows: Granted as to Exhibit 1 (i.e., Grant Deed recorded April 14, 2021)
and Granted as to Exhibit 2 (i.e., Long Form Deed of Trust and Assignment of
Rents recorded April 15, 2021).
Merits
Lin asserts that she “has never been on title and she is not
asserting title to, or any ownership interest in, the Property. The title
dispute here is between Plaintiff and Sunnyland” and argues that the instant
motion should be granted “[s]ince none of these causes of action applies to
relates [sic] to Lin.” (Motion, 4:7-10). Lin’s argument ignores Plaintiff’s alter
ego allegations in Paragraphs 8-15 of the complaint.
Lin also asserts that Miao Li, in whose favor Sunnyland
executed a Long Form Deed of Trust and Assignment of Rents (RJN, Exh, 2), was
not joined as a party to this action and that Plaintiff’s second cause of
action somehow fails based on this omission. As Liu points out, unless raised
by demurrer or answer, any objection for defect or misjoinder of parties is
automatically waived. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.80). Further, assuming arguendo
that Miao Li is considered to be an “indispensable party,” “the failure to join
indispensable parties does not deprive a court of the power to make a legally
binding adjudication between the parties properly before it.” (Doe v.
Regents of University of California (2022) 80 Cal.App.5th 282, 305
[internal quotations and citation omitted].)
Lin’s motion is denied.
