 Case Number:  22PSCV00260    Hearing Date:   May 29, 2024    Dept:  K Defendant Mao Lun
Huang’s Motion to Set Aside The Entry of Default and Default Judgment is DENIED.
Background[1]  
Plaintiff City of El Monte (“Plaintiff”) alleges as follows:
Mao Lun Huang (“Huang”) and Chun Xiao Liang (“Liang”), individually and
as Trustees of the Huang and Liang Family Trust (“Defendants”), own, inhabit
and/or operate the property located at 4723 Santa Anita Avenue in El Monte (“subject
property”). On June 12, 2020, members of the El Monte Police Department
(“Police”) executed a search warrant at the subject property after an
investigation was initiated into an illegal marijuana cultivation operation
taking place at the subject property. Upon executing the warrant, the Police
observed that the subject property was a warehouse with a large open interior.
There were numerous rooms constructed with drywall that did not appear
to be constructed in compliance with building safety codes. There were also
numerous exposed electrical wiring and electrical panels that were not in
compliance with building safety codes. It was determined the subject property
had been converted for illegal marijuana cultivation. Each room contained
numerous marijuana plants in various stages of growth. Additionally, industrial
lighting, electrical modifications, and air filtration systems commonly used in
the large-scale indoor cultivation of marijuana were observed throughout the
subject property. The Police seized marijuana
plants and marijuana cultivation equipment.
On March 17, 2022, Plaintiff filed a complaint, asserting
causes of action against Defendants and Does 1-100 for:
1.                 
Narcotics Abatement (Health & Safety Code §§ 11570
et seq.)
2.                 
Public Nuisance (Civil Code §§ 3479 et seq.)
3.                 
Violation of El Monte Municipal Code (EMMC Chapters
5.18 and Ch. 1.19)
4.                 
Violation of Unfair Competition Law (Business &
Professions Code §§ 17200 et seq.)
5.                 
Violation of MAUCRSA (Business & Professions Code
§§ 26000 et seq.)
On October 31, 2023, Defendants filed an answer.
On November 17, 2023, the matter came on calendar for Orders
to Show Cause Re: Why the Matter Should Not Be Dismissed and Re: Failure to
File Proof of Service and a Case Management Conference. No appearance was
made by Defendants; at that time, the court vacated the OSCs and continued
the CMC to December 18, 2023.
On December 18, 2023, the matter came on
calendar for a CMC. No appearance was made by Defendants; at that time,
the court continued the CMC to January 10, 2024. On January 4, 2024, a
“Notice Re: Continuance off Hearing and Order” was filed, wherein the court
continued the CMC set for January 10, 2024 to February 2, 2024; notice was
given to counsel.
On February 2, 2023, the
matter came on calendar for a CMC. No appearance was made by Defendants;
at that time, the court scheduled a default prove-up hearing for May 3, 2024.
On May 3, 2024, a
default prove up hearing was held; at that time, the court found Defendants in
violation of the complaint and advised that it would enter judgment, jointly
and severally, against them in the amount of $180,000.00. Judgment has not been
entered, to date.
Legal Standard
“The court may, upon any terms as may be just, relieve a party
or his or her legal representative from a judgment, dismissal, order, or other
proceeding taken against him or her through his or her mistake, inadvertence,
surprise, or excusable neglect. Application for this relief shall be
accompanied by a copy of the answer or other pleading proposed to be filed
therein, otherwise the application shall not be granted, and shall be made
within a reasonable time, in no case exceeding six months, after the judgment,
dismissal, order, or proceeding was taken . . .” (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd.
(b).)
Discussion
Huang moves the
court, pursuant Code of Civil Procedure § 473, for an order setting aside entry
or default and/or default judgment on the basis of excusable neglect.
At the outset, the
court notes that the instant motion was filed on behalf of Huang only, whereas
the reply brief is purportedly filed on behalf of both Huang and Liang. Liang
cannot “join” the motion via a reply brief. The following analysis pertains to
Huang only as the moving party:
Huang has moved for
discretionary relief, on the basis of excusable neglect. (Motion, 7:3, 8:6-7)[2].
“Excusable neglect is that neglect which might have been the act of a
reasonably prudent person under the same circumstances.” (Huh v. Wang
(2007) 158 Cal.App.4th 1406, 1419 [quotations and citation omitted]). 
Huang’s counsel
Matthew Mullhofer (“Mullhofer”) attests that “[t]he Law Offices of
Matthew C. Mullhofer had an office in Irvine, California, at 18012 Sky Park
Circle, Ste. 100A. Several correspondences were lost when sent to this address
due to the postal service’s inability to locate this Suite. This address
assigned by property management “Suite 100A” did not exist as a legal address
with the postal service. By the time our firm realized there was an address
discrepancy, we were constantly experiencing a delay or loss of our mail. After
unsuccessfully attempting to resolve the mail issue, we instead relocated our
office to our current location.” (Mullhofer
Decl., ¶ 5). Mullhofer further attests that “[a]lthough we relocated on
April 15, 2024, our office continues to encounter mail issues due to the same
discrepancy as we are still awaiting forwarded correspondence. We are also
dealing with the typical inconveniences of changing an address which contributed
to calendaring mistakes.” (Id., ¶ 6). Mullhofer lastly attests that “the Notice of Ruling served by Plaintiff’s
Counsel is defective. It is dated February 7, 2024, but was not filed until
April 30, 2024.” (Id., ¶ 7).
Huang’s motion
clarifies that “[o]ur law firm suffered excusable neglect because we
failed to properly calendar two case management conference hearings, but
through no fault of its own: the first absence was due to a problem with the
mail carrier at the Irvine office, which led to several lost correspondences
(See Mullhofer Declaration, ¶ 5) and then our addition of a second office
location caused a mistake in scheduling the next hearing. (See Mullhofer
Declaration, ¶ 6).” (Motion, 8:22-26).
The court docket,
however, reflects that Defendants’ counsel failed to appear at three CMCs
scheduled for November 17, 2023, December
18, 2023 and February 2, 2024, as well as at the May 3, 2024 default
prove up hearing. Further, Plaintiff’s counsel David R. Welch attests that his
office mailed the Notice of Ruling for the May 3, 2024 hearing, including the
court’s minute order from the February 2, 2024 CMC, on February 7, 2024, that
he send an email to Defendants’ counsel on April 27, 2024 with the Notice of
Ruling and minute order as an attachment, called Defendants’ counsel on May 1,
2024 and spoke with Defendants’ counsel on May 2, 2024, during which time
Defendants’ counsel advised that he intended to appear at the May 3, 2024
hearing. (Welch Decl., ¶¶ 5-7). In reply, Huang offers up a declaration from
attorney Hernan Simo, who attests that he tried to register with the court’s
website to remotely appear on behalf of Defendants on May 3, 2024, but was
unable to do so because “less than 30 minutes remained until the beginning of
the hearing.” (Simo Decl., ¶¶ 4-5). The foregoing failures, in the court’s view, do not constitute excusable
neglect warranting relief.
Huang’s motion is
denied.
