And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving fraudulent concealment. The defendant, American Honda Motor Co., Inc., demurred to the fifth cause of action, alleging that the complaint fails to sufficiently allege a cause of action for fraudulent concealment. The court has overruled the demurrer, finding that the allegations are sufficient to support the elements of fraudulent concealment.

The court has also denied the defendant's motion to strike the prayer for punitive damages. The court has ordered the defendant to file an answer within twenty days.

The court's ruling is based on the allegations in the complaint, which allege that the defendant concealed the existence of a defect in the subject vehicle, a 2020 Honda Civic, which caused the vehicle to malfunction and pose a safety risk. The court has found that the defendant had a duty to disclose the defect, but instead concealed it, intending to defraud the plaintiffs.

The court has also considered the economic loss rule, which may bar claims for purely economic losses. However, the court has found that the rule does not apply in this case, as the plaintiffs have alleged that they suffered harm beyond a broken contractual promise.

Finally, the court has denied the defendant's request to strike the prayer for punitive damages, finding that the claim for fraudulent concealment is not a Song-Beverly claim, which would support an award of attorney's fees under that Act.
