BACKGROUND
On March 6, 2024, Interinsurance
Exchange of the Automobile Club filed a petition to open superior court file
for purpose of establishing superior court jurisdiction over under-insured
motorist arbitration matters.
LEGAL AUTHORITY
Compel
If a party to whom interrogatories
are directed fails to serve a timely response, the propounding party may move
for an order compelling responses and for a monetary sanction.  CCP §2030.290(b).  The statute contains no time limit for a
motion to compel where no responses have been served.  All that need be shown in the moving papers
is that a set of interrogatories was properly served on the opposing party,
that the time to respond has expired, and that no response of any kind has been
served.  Leach v. Superior Court (1980) 111 Cal. App. 3d 902, 905-906. 
Compel further
45-Day Rule: 
This motion must be served within 45 days after service of the response
in question (extended if served by mail, overnight delivery, or fax; see CCP
§1013); otherwise, the demanding party waives the right to compel any further
response to the CCP §2031.010 demand. 
CCP §§2031.310(c), 2016.050; see Sperber
v. Robinson (1994) 26 Cal. App. 4th 736, 745.  The 45-day time limit is mandatory and
jurisdictional.  Sexton v. Superior Court (1997) 58 Cal. App. 4th 1403, 1410.  The parties, however, can also agree in
writing on a specific later date by which to file the motion to compel.  CCP §2031.310(c). 
Meet-and-Confer Requirement: 
The motion to compel further responses must be accompanied by a
declaration showing “a reasonable and good faith attempt” to resolve the issues
outside of court (so-called “meet and confer”). 
CCP §§2016.040, 2031.310(b)(2).
Separate Statement: 
Any motion involving the content of a discovery request or the responses
to such a request shall be accompanied by a separate statement.  This includes a motion to compel further
responses to demand for inspection of documents or tangible things.  CRC Rule 3.1020(a)(3).  
Interrogatories
CCP §2030.300 states:  “(a) On receipt of a response to
interrogatories, the propounding party may move for an order compelling a
further response if the propounding party deems that any of the following
apply:   (1) An answer to a particular
interrogatory is evasive or incomplete. . . . (3) An objection to an
interrogatory is without merit or too general. 
(b) A motion under subdivision (a) shall be accompanied by a meet and
confer declaration under Section 2016.040. (c) Unless notice of this motion is
given within 45 days of the service of the verified response, or any
supplemental verified response, or on or before any specific later date to
which the propounding party and the responding party have agreed in writing,
the propounding party waives any right to compel a further response to the
interrogatories. . . .”
CCP §2030.220 states:  “(a) Each answer in a response to
interrogatories shall be as complete and straightforward as the information
reasonably available to the responding party permits.  (b) If an interrogatory cannot be answered
completely, it shall be answered to the extent possible.  (c) If the responding party does not have
personal knowledge sufficient to respond fully to an interrogatory, that party
shall so state, but shall make a reasonable and good faith effort to obtain the
information by inquiry to other natural persons or organizations, except where
the information is equally available to the propounding party.”
Request for Production of Documents
On receipt of a response to an
inspection demand, the demanding party may move for an order compelling further
responses to the demand if the demanding party deems that any of the following
apply:  (1) a statement of compliance
with the demand is incomplete; (2) a representation of inability to comply is
inadequate, incomplete, or evasive; or (3) an objection in the response is
without merit or too general.  CCP
§2031.310(a).  A statement of compliance
shall state that the production, inspection, and related activity demanded will
be allowed either in whole or in part, and that all documents or things in the
demanded category that are in the possession, custody, or control of that party
and to which no objection is being made will be included in the production.  CCP §2031.220. 
A motion to compel further response
to requests for production “shall set forth specific facts showing good cause
justifying the discovery sought by the inspection demand.”  CCP § 2031.310(b)(1).  “To establish ‘good cause,’ the burden is on
the moving party to show both:  [1] Relevance to the subject matter (e.g.,
how the information in the documents would tend to prove or disprove some issue
in the case); and [2] Specific facts justifying discovery
(e.g., why such information is necessary for trial preparation or to prevent
surprise at trial).  The fact that there
is no alternative source for the
information sought is an important factor in establishing ‘good cause’ for
inspection.  But it is not essential in every case.”  Weil & Brown, Civil Procedure Before Trial, 8:1495.6 (citations omitted).  “Declarations are generally used to show the
requisite ‘good cause’ for an order to compel inspection.  The declarations must contain ‘specific facts’
rather than mere conclusions.”  Id. at 8:1495.7 (citation omitted).  “The declarations may be on information and
belief, if necessary.  However, in such
cases, the ‘specific facts’ supporting such information and belief (the sources
of the information) must also be alleged.” 
Id. at 8:1495.8 (citation
omitted).  “Most declarations are made by
the attorney for the moving party, who is usually more familiar with the
relevancy and ‘specific facts’ constituting ‘good cause’ for inspection.”  Id.
at 8:1495.9.
“If ‘good cause’ is shown by the moving
party, the burden is then on the responding party to justify any objections
made to document disclosure (the same as on motions to compel answers to
interrogatories or deposition questions. . . ).”  Id.
at 8:1496 (citation omitted).  
DISCUSSION
            Petitioner
Interinsurance Exchange of the Automobile Club requests an order compelling
respondent/claimant Nadia Weiss to respond to Form Interrogatories, Set One and
to respond further to Special Interrogatories, Nos. 14, 39, 40, 41, and 42 and
Requests for Production of Documents, Set One, No. 12, and to produce
responsive documents as to Nos. 21, 30, 31, 33, 36, 38, 40, 41, 42, and 44 and
to serve verifications.
            Petitioner
served written discovery on respondent Weiss on December 14, 2023.  Respondent’s responses were due on January
15, 2024.  On January 16, 2024,
petitioner’s counsel agreed to extend the deadline to respond to January 29,
2024.  On January 31, 2024, petitioner’s
counsel sent a follow up meet and confer requesting responses without
objections by February 5, 2024.  On
February 1, 2024, respondent requested an extension, and petitioner’s counsel
agreed to March 3, 2024.  On March 6,
2024, petitioner’s counsel sent a further meet and confer.  Shortly after, petitioner explains,
petitioner’s counsel received Weiss’ unverified responses to special
interrogatories and request for production of documents.  
Petitioner
contends that despite indicating that she would produce all medical records and
bills for medical providers, Weiss’ production consisted solely of a handful of
physician’s reports created months after the incident and that the documents
provided appear incomplete, including no billing records or history, no invoice
for services, and no patient intake forms. 
Petitioner also asserts that Weiss failed to provide her phone records
(see No. 12: cell phone call logs for 12/15/21), employee files, social media
regarding the accident, vacation documentation, other relevant social media
documents, prior shoulder treatment records, and any records relating to
subsequent accidents or incidents.  
On March
9, 2024, petitioner’s counsel sent a detailed meet and confer letter
identifying numerous deficiencies in Weiss’ discovery responses.  On March 14, 2024, petitioner’s counsel sent
another meet and confer as to the form interrogatories.  To date, petitioner’s counsel has not
received any responses to the form interrogatories.  Counsel has also not received verifications,
the “documents promised to be produced,” and verified further responses to the
identified deficient discovery.
The Court
finds that petitioner properly served discovery requests.  Respondent Nadia Weiss failed to serve
responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One. 
Respondent Weiss failed to serve verifications as to her responses to
Special Interrogatories, Set One and Requests for Production of Documents, Set
One.  Unverified discovery responses “are
tantamount to no responses at all.”  Appleton
v. Superior Court (1988) 206 Cal. App. 3d 632, 636.  Respondent failed to properly respond to Special
Interrogatories, Nos. 14, 39, 40, 41, and 42. 
Weiss’ responses do not comply with CCP §2030.220.  She also failed to properly respond to Request
for Production of Documents, No. 12, stating “N/A,” which does not comply with
CCP §2031.240.  Although it appears that
Weiss failed to produce responsive documents as to Nos. 21, 30, 31, 33, 36, 38,
40, 41, 42, 44, petitioner failed to address in the separate statement or the
notice of motion.  
The
motion to compel responses to form interrogatories, set one is GRANTED.
The
motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories, Nos. 14, 39, 40,
41, and 42 is GRANTED.  Weiss is also
ordered to serve a verification.
The
motion to compel further responses to request for production of documents, No.
12 is GRANTED.  Weiss is also ordered to
serve a verification.  The motion is
DENIED as to Nos. 21, 30, 31, 33, 36, 38, 40, 41, 42, and 44. 
 
            Sanctions
Under CCP § 2023.030(a), “[t]he
court may impose a monetary sanction ordering that one engaging in the misuse
of the discovery process, or any attorney advising that conduct, or both pay
the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a
result of that conduct. . . . If a monetary sanction is authorized by any
provision of this title, the court shall impose that sanction unless it finds
that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or
that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  Under CCP § 2023.010, an example of the
misuse of the discovery process is “(d) Failing to respond or to submit to an
authorized method of discovery.” 
Sanctions are mandatory in
connection with motions to compel further responses against any party, person,
or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel unless the
court “finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial
justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction
unjust.”  CCP § §2030.300(d),
2031.310(h).
Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1348(a)
states:  “The court may award sanctions
under the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel
discovery, even though no opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to
the motion was withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided to the moving
party after the motion was filed.” 
Petitioner requests a total of
$8580 against respondent Nadia Weiss and her counsel of record.  The Court finds that $2280 ($350/hr. x 6
hrs., $180 in filing fees) is a reasonable amount to be incurred against
respondent Weiss and her attorney of record.
