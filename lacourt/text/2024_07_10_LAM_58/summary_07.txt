And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's application for default judgment without prejudice. The plaintiff failed to meet the requirements for default judgment as set forth in California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1800. Specifically, the plaintiff failed to provide interest computations as necessary, dismiss parties against whom judgment is not sought, and substantiate the requested damages. Additionally, the plaintiff's declaration did not set forth the basis for the requested attorneys' fees. The judge will reconsider the application if the plaintiff corrects these deficiencies.
