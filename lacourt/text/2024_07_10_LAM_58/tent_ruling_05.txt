Motion for an Order Awarding Prejudgment Interest is granted. 
             

 
Background
 
This is an action for declaratory
relief. On April 4, 2023, Plaintiff Christopher Chong (“Plaintiff”) filed the
instant action for declaratory relief seeking – in relevant part – a judicial
declaration that Mardirossian Akragian LLP’s (“Defendant Mardirossian” or
“Defendant”) “claim to 45% of the settlement proceeds, which together with
costs totals $2,761,458.62, is neither a fair nor reasonable value of the legal
services provided in this matter.” (Complaint, ¶ 17.) Defendant Mardirossian
represented Plaintiff in the underlying action on a contingency-fee basis
against Porsche AG and the driver, Jose Guzman Figueroa, later adding Sharpe
Interior Systems, Inc. as a defendant. In May 2022, Sharpe Interior Systems,
Inc. and Jose Guzman Figueroa agreed to settle the suit in the underlying
action for $6,015,000. Plaintiff Chong fired Defendant Mardirossian, and on the
recommendation of new counsel, accepted the settlement Mardirossian negotiated
and received the proceeds.
 
On May 30, 2023, Defendant
Mardirossian filed a Cross-Complaint against Plaintiff for declaratory relief,
seeking a judicial declaration of the amount of attorney’s fees and costs owed
by Plaintiff to Defendant Mardirossian. 
 
On March 26, 2024, after hearing oral
argument, the Court granted Defendant Mardirossian’s motion for summary
judgment to the Complaint and also granted its motion for summary adjudication
as to the Cross-Complaint. (03/26/24 Minute Order.) 
 
On May 2, 2024, Defendant
Mardirossian filed the instant Motion for an Order Awarding Prejudgment
Interest. The motion is made on the grounds that it “is entitled to recover
damages certain or capable of being made certain by calculation, the right to
recover upon a particular day, and that [it] is, thus, entitled also to recover
interest thereon from that day.” (Not. of Mot. at p. 1:8-11.) 
 
On June 26, 2024, Plaintiff filed and
served an opposition to the motion. 
 
Judicial Notice 
 
            The Court
grants Defendant’s request for judicial notice. (Evid. Code §§ 452, 453.) 
 
Legal Standard 
 
“A person who is entitled to recover
damages certain, or capable of being made certain by calculation, and the right
to recover which is vested in the person upon a particular day, is entitled
also to recover interest thereon from that day, except when the debtor is
prevented by law, or by the act of the creditor from paying the debt."
(Civ. Code § 3287, subd. (a).) Pursuant to Civil Code section 3287(a), “the
court has no discretion, but must award prejudgment interest upon request, from
the first day there exists both a breach and a liquidated claim.” (Howard v.
American National Fire Ins. Co. (2010) 187 Cal.App.4th 498, 535.) “The test
for determining certainty under section 3287(a) is whether the defendant knew
the amount of damages owed to the claimant or could have computed that amount
from reasonably available information.” (Ibid.) “Uncertainty as to liability
is irrelevant. A dispute concerning liability does not preclude prejudgment
interest in a civil action.” (Ibid., emphasis in original.) “Any legal
rate of interest stipulated by a contract remains chargeable after a breach
thereof, as before, until the contract is superseded by a verdict or other new
obligation.” (Civ. Code, § 3289, subd. (a).) “If a contract entered into after
January 1, 1986, does not stipulate the legal rate of interest, the obligation
shall bear interest at a rate of 10 percent per annum after a breach.” (Civ.
Code, § 3289, subd. (b).) 
 
The statute authorizing prejudgment
interest is read liberally.  “ ‘It has
long been settled that [Civil Code] section 3287 should be broadly interpreted
to provide just compensation to the injured party for loss of use of money
during the prejudgment period. [Citation.]’ ” (Great Western Drywall, Inc.
v. role Construction Co., Inc. (2008) 166 Cal.App.4th 761, 768.)
 
Discussion
 
Defendant argues that the Court must
award it prejudgment interest at the rate of 10% per annum from as early as May
2022 but no later than August 2022. Plaintiff contends that Defendant should
not be awarded prejudgment interest because there is not a date certain
articulated in the motion as to when prejudgment interest should accrue. Additionally,
Plaintiff contends that Defendant should be limited to pre-judgment interest to
which it agreed. 
 
The Parties’ Evidence 
 
Defendant presents evidence that the
underlying action settled in May 2022 for $6,015,000.00. (Feit Decl., ¶ 3; Ex.
1 at pp. 15-6 to 15-10.) According to the parties’ retainer agreement,
Plaintiff agreed to pay Defendant a contingency fee of 45% of the gross
recovery of any settlement. (Feit Decl., ¶ 9 and Ex. 7.) On August 19, 2022,
Plaintiff signed a settlement agreement that Defendant law firm had negotiated
and accepted the benefits. On August 23, 2022, Defendant informed attorney Eric
George that, pursuant to the retainer agreement in the underlying action, it
was owed “45% of the gross recovery or $2,706.750.00 in legal fees. In addition
to the legal fees, we are owed $54,630.29 in costs and expenses advanced on
[Plaintiff’s] behalf. Since my firm performed all of the terms under the
Agreement of Employment of Counsel, please ask counsel for Sharpe Interior
Systems, Inc. and Mr. Guzman to prepare a check payable to [Defendant] in the
amount of $2,761.380.29.” (Feit Decl., ¶ 5; Ex. 3.) On August 24, 2022,
attorney Eric George agreed and notified Sharpe to segregate the sum of
$2,761,380.29 from the settlement amount, which was to be deposited into a bank
account, pending resolution of Defendant’s claim for attorney’s fees and costs.
(Feit Decl., ¶ 3, Ex. 1 at p. 15-12; Feit Decl., ¶ 6, Ex. 4.) The monies were
placed in a blocked account to be held in trust, pending resolution of
Defendant’s claim for attorney’s fees and costs. (Feit Decl., ¶ 3, Ex. 1 at pp.
15-12 and 15-15; Feit Decl., ¶¶ 7-8, Exs. 7-8.) On October 3, 2022, Sharpe
Interior Systems, Inc. sent a check in the amount of $2,746,380.29 payable to
Defendant and, on October 13, 2022, Jose Guzman Figueroa sent a check in the
amount of $15,000.00 payable to Defendant. (Feit Decl., ¶¶ 7-8; Exs. 5-6.)  
 
In opposition to the motion,
Plaintiff’s counsel, Eric M. George (“George”), declares that Defendant’s
entitlement to pre-judgment interest conflicts with several conversations that
he had with Garo Mardirossian in and after August 2022 concerning the
$2,761,380.29 to which he claimed an entitlement. (George Decl., ¶ 2.) Pursuant
to their purported agreement, under no circumstance would Defendant be entitled
to additional interest except for the interest that accrued when the funds were
placed in the blocked account. (George Decl., ¶ 2.) 
 
Appropriateness of Awarding
Prejudgment Interest 
 
The crux of Plaintiff’s opposition is
that Defendant never identifies a date certain for the accrual of pre-judgment
interest in the notice of motion or the motion itself. 
 
Plaintiff does not affirmatively
argue that pre-judgment interest should accrue on any particular date. Instead,
Plaintiff argues that Defendant does not identify a date certain for
pre-judgment interest. But in its motion, Defendant does identify as the latest
potential accrual date August 23, 2022, when Defendant demanded fees based on
the amount of the settlement.  
 
The Court has previously found that
Plaintiff ratified the settlement agreement on August 19, 2022, when he signed
it.  (March 26, 2024 minute order, at p.
8.) At that point, Plaintiff’s right to receive the settlement payment was
established and the amount of contingency fees was made certain by calculation.
As our Supreme Court explained 95 years ago: 
“The general rule is that interest is allowable from the time the sum in
suit becomes due, if the sum is certain or can be made certain by calculation.”
(Perry v. Magneson (1929) 207 Cal. 617, 623.)
 
              County of Solano v. Lionsgate Corp. (2005)
126 Cal.App.4th 741 is instructive as to the date of accrual of pre-judgment
interest. Lionsgate appealed a trial court order confirming an arbitrator’s
award to the County of Solano that included prejudgment interest. The Court of
Appeal affirmed that the County was entitled to prejudgment interest as of the
date the arbitrator’s final award was entered because that was the date “[t]he
award itself become a contractual obligation . . . .” (Id. at p. 753.)  Here, the contractual obligation of Plaintiff
to pay Defendant attorney’s fees arose when Plaintiff ratified the settlement
agreement on August 19, 2022. That is when Defendant’s right to contingency
fees vested and became certain by calculation. 
 
            Also in the
case at bench, Plaintiff’s settlement was an insurance policy limit payment
made on behalf of Defendant Sharpe.  The
date that insurance payment became a contractual obligation established the
accrual date for interest on the unpaid fees. The Ninth Circuit, applying
section 3287, affirmed a similar result when an insurer sought recovery of
payments advanced to an insured.  In Evanston
Ins. Co. v. OEA, Inc. (9th Cir. 2009) 566 F.3d 915, an insurer
advanced indemnity payments and defense costs to settle its insured’s
litigation under a reservation of rights. 
The carrier later sued its insured for reimbursement because the claims
were made before the insurance policy incepted. The district court granted
judgment for the insurer; the Ninth Circuit affirmed. With respect to the award
of prejudgment interest, the “district court found that the right of
reimbursement vested when [insurer] Evanston made payment to OEA and awarded
prejudgment interest from the time payments were made.” (Id. at p.
920.)  The Court of Appeals affirmed,
concluding, “Evanston is entitled to reimbursement for the funds expended . . .
and for prejudgment interest from the time the funds were expended.” (Id.
at p. 922.)
 
            Finally, the
Court rejects Plaintiff’s argument that Defendant “should be estopped from
seeking pre-judgment interest when it previously agreed to the placement of the
disputed funds in a joint, interest-bearing account. The action by [Defendant],
the reliance by Plaintiff, and the inequity of allowing a windfall by
[Defendant] . . . all exist in this case.” (Opp’n at p. 4:22-26.) The Court
finds that Plaintiff’s reliance on Glassman, supra, 90
Cal.App.5th 1281, 1321 is inapposite as Plaintiff has not articulated the
factors to show estoppel such as: (1) Defendant knowing the facts; (2)
Defendant’s intention to have his conduct acted upon or Plaintiff having the
right to believe that it was so intended; (3) Plaintiff’s ignorance of the true
state of facts; and (4) Plaintiff’s reliance on Defendant’s conduct to his
injury. (Glassman, supra, 195 Cal.App.3d 1308, 1321.) The
declaration of Mr. George fails to set forth grounds for estoppel.  Here, despite Plaintiff’s legal duty to honor
the fee agreement with Defendant, he has delayed resolving this matter.  Under those circumstances, imposition of
prejudgment interest fulfills the purpose of Civil Code section 3287 and is
appropriate.  
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing, the motion is granted and the Court awards
Defendant pre-judgment interest at the rate of 10% per annum from August 19,
2022 through the date of entry of judgment.
