And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the defendant's motion for an order awarding pre-judgment interest. The defendant is entitled to recover pre-judgment interest at the rate of 10% per annum from August 19, 2022, the date the plaintiff ratified the settlement agreement, to the date of entry of judgment. The court finds that the plaintiff's settlement was an insurance policy limit payment made on behalf of the defendant, and therefore, the date that insurance payment became a contractual obligation established the accrual date for interest on the unpaid fees. The court also rejects the plaintiff's argument that the defendant should be estopped from seeking pre-judgment interest when it previously agreed to the placement of the disputed funds in a joint, interest-bearing account.
