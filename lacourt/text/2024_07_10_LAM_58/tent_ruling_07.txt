Background
 
This is an unlawful detainer action
which arises from the alleged non-payment of rent. On July 24, 2023, Plaintiff
7561 Melrose, LLC (“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint—Unlawful Detainer against
Defendants Wesley Scott Reardan (“Reardan”), Tyler Steven Gonzalez
(“Gonzalez”), and Does 1 to 10. According to the Complaint, Plaintiff is
seeking forfeiture of the lease, reasonable attorneys’ fees, and damages at the
rate of $666.66 per day from July 13, 2023. (UD-100 at pp. 3-4.) 
 
On October 2, 2023, default was
entered against Defendants Reardan and Gonzalez. (10/03/23 Minute Order.)  
 
On October 30, 2023, judgment by
default was entered against Defendants Reardan and Gonzalez for possession
only. (10/30/23 Judgment.) 
 
On May 20, 2024, Plaintiff filed a
Request for Court Judgment form (CIV-100) seeking default judgment against
Defendants Reardan and Gonzalez in the sum of $196,301.50. Also, on such date, Plaintiff
filed a Proposed Judgment and Declaration of Parviz Sarshar (“Sarshar”) in
Support of Default Judgment. 
 
Legal Standard 
 
California Rules
of Court, Rule 3.1800 sets forth the requirements for default judgments. In
pertinent part, the rule dictates that a party must use form CIV-100 and file
the following documents with the clerk: (1) except in unlawful detainer cases,
a brief summary of the case identifying the parties and the nature of
plaintiff's claim; (2) declarations or other admissible evidence in support of
the judgment requested; (3)¿interest computations as necessary; (4) a
memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5)¿a declaration of nonmilitary status
for each defendant against whom judgment is sought; (6) a proposed form of
judgment; (7) a dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or
an application for separate judgment against specified parties under Code of
Civil Procedure section 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each
judgment; (8)¿exhibits as necessary; and (9)¿a request for attorney fees if
allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.  (Cal. Rules of
Court, Rule 3.1800(a)(1)-(9).) 
 
Discussion
 
Plaintiff seeks default judgment
against Defendants Reardan and Gonzalez. 
 
            The Court finds that Plaintiff has
failed to meet the requirements of California Rules of Court, Rule
3.1800 in order to obtain entry of default judgment against Defendants Reardan
and Gonzalez. Plaintiff has failed to: (1) provide interest computations as
necessary; and (2) dismiss parties against whom judgment is not sought as the
Doe defendants have not been dismissed. Plaintiffs have also failed to
substantiate the requested damages as no ledger or documentation is attached to
the declaration of Ms. Sarshar showing the amount of past due rent, late fees,
or holdover damages. Additionally, although requesting attorneys’ fees, Plaintiff
has not indicated whether the requested attorneys’ fees are allowed by statute
or agreement of the parties. The declaration of Ms. Sarshar fails to set forth the
basis for the requested attorneys’ fees. 
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s default judgment application is denied
without prejudice.
