 Case Number:  23STCV20122    Hearing Date:   March 6, 2024    Dept:  55 NATURE OF PROCEEDINGS:  DEFENDANT LOS ANGELES DODGERS LLC’S DEMURRER
TO PLAINTIFF THOMAS VALENTINE’S COMPLAINT
 
In this case, THOMAS VALENTINE (“Plaintiff”) seeks
damages against LOS ANGELES DODGERS LLC and GUGGENHEIM BASEBALL MANAGEMENT LLC related
to the Dodgers’ allegedly violating the Unruh Civil Rights Act, Civil Code
Section 51 (“Unruh Act”) when they asked Plaintiff to leave the stadium after
he refused to wear a mask while attending a game on August 20, 2021.  
Defendant LOS ANGELES DODGERS LLC (“Defendant”) brings
a demurrer to the single cause of action for violation of the Unruh Act.
Plaintiff opposes the demurrer.
Defendant correctly argues that the Unruh Act claim is
time-barred under the two-year statute of limitations (Code Civ. Proc., §
335.1) because the face of the Complaint shows that Plaintiff’s claim accrued
on August 20, 2021, but he did not file the Complaint until more than two years
late, on August 22, 2023. The Court therefore will sustain the demurrer. 
Defendant argues that the demurrer should be sustained
without leave to amend. Plaintiff argues that the Clerk rejected the Complaint
that was timely filed, simply because the address was not stated at the top of
the Complaint, and Plaintiff promptly corrected it.  
Courts generally allow at least one opportunity to
amend a complaint, after sustaining a demurrer. City of Stockton v. Sup.Ct.
(2007) 42 Cal.4th 730, 747; Cal. Prac. Guide: Civ. Pro. Before Trial (The
Rutter Group 2023) ¶7:129.
“The clerk has no discretion to reject a complaint
that substantially conforms to the local rules.”  Rojas v. Cutsforth (1998) 67
Cal.App.4th 774, 777.  A document is deemed filed when it is deposited with the
clerk with directions to file the paper where the clerk had no proper basis for
rejecting it.  Ibid. at 778. Generally,
documents are deemed filed when the court clerk receives them for filing,
during open hours, at the clerk’s place of business (with exceptions, including
failures to pay required fees, or to file documents in the proper form required
by the rules, or when clerks have no authority for rejecting documents).  E.g.,
Duran v. St. Luke's Hospital (2003) 114 Cal. App. 4th 457, 461-62;  Carlson v. Dep't of Fish & Game
(1998) 68 Cal. App. 4th 1268, 1276.  “If
a document is presented to the clerk’s office for filing in a form that
complies with the rules of court, the clerk's office has a ministerial duty to
file it....  Even if the document
contains defects, the clerk's office should file it and notify the party that
the defect should be corrected.…”  Voit
v. Sup. Ct.  (2011) 201 Cal.App.4th
1285, 1287.  See also CRC Rule 2.118(c)
(“For good cause shown, the court may permit the filing of papers that do not
comply with the rules in this chapter.”); and L.A.S.C. First Amended Gen. Ord.
¶ 7(a)(ii) (regarding possible relief for electronic filing errors).
Given law such as that referenced above, the Court concludes
there is a somewhat reasonable possibility of successfully amending the
Complaint. Therefore, the demurrer is sustained with leave to amend. Plaintiff
may serve and file a First Amended Complaint by 3/27/2024.
