And here is the English-text summary:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Thomas Valentine v. Los Angeles Dodgers LLC and Guggenheim Baseball Management LLC. The Plaintiff, Thomas Valentine, is seeking damages against the Defendants for allegedly violating the Unruh Civil Rights Act when they asked him to leave the stadium after he refused to wear a mask at a game on August 20, 2021.

The Defendant, Los Angeles Dodgers LLC, has brought a demurrer to the Plaintiff's single cause of action for violation of the Unruh Act, arguing that the claim is time-barred under the two-year statute of limitations. The Court has sustained the demurrer, finding that the Plaintiff's claim accrued on August 20, 2021, but he did not file the Complaint until more than two years late, on August 22, 2023.

However, the Court has also granted leave to amend the Complaint, finding that there is a somewhat reasonable possibility of successfully amending the document. The Plaintiff may serve and file a First Amended Complaint by March 27, 2024.
