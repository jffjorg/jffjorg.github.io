Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is granting ONNI's motion to file a proposed First Amended Cross-Complaint (FACC) to add Jerry Sorrentino, the sole owner and designated PMQ of Precision Construction Group, Inc., as a cross-defendant under an alter ego theory. The judge finds that ONNI has shown that it did not learn the bases for adding Sorrentino until after completing Sorrentino's second PMQ deposition in December 2023 and that Precision failed to produce documents related to the disposition of the funds. The judge concludes that allowing the FACC will require additional discovery and therefore will continue the trial to ensure the parties can complete discovery on the new pleading. The proposed FACC may be served and filed within 10 days, and the trial will be continued to a later date.
