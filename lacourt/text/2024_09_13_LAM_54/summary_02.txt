And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to quash service of summons filed by Specially Appearing Cross-Defendant Shragay Flags & Symbols Ltd. Shragay argues that the Court does not have personal jurisdiction over it, as it is incorporated in and operates out of Israel. However, the Court finds that there is specific personal jurisdiction over Shragay, as it is alleged to have acted as the US subsidiary, agent, and alter ego of Flag & Symbol, LLC, and was directly involved in the manufacture of products to be sold in California by Value Price, LLC. The Court therefore denies Shragay's motion to quash service of summons.
