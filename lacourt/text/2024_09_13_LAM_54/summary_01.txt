And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiffs' motion to set aside the dismissal of their case. The plaintiffs had alleged that they were unaware that one of the defendants, U Work, was a suspended corporation at the time of the settlement agreement, and therefore, the settlement was void. However, the judge found that the plaintiffs had not diligently moved to set aside the dismissal and that the statutory time limits for setting aside dismissal did not apply to cases of extrinsic fraud. Additionally, the judge found that the March 16, 2022 order dismissing the action was not "void" under Section 473(d) of the California Code of Civil Procedure. As a result, the judge denied the plaintiffs' motion to set aside the dismissal.
