And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving a motion to compel responses to discovery and a request for sanctions. The defendant, Laurence Kim, moved to compel responses to discovery and sought sanctions against the plaintiffs, Ines Aquino, Emily Morales, and Michelle Morales. The discovery was served on June 4, 2024, and responses were due on July 10, 2024. The plaintiffs requested an extension to respond, which the defendant granted initially but denied subsequently. The plaintiffs eventually served their responses on July 22, 2024. Because the responses have been served, the judge has denied the motions as moot. The judge also notes that, since the defendant is not represented by an attorney, they cannot recover attorney's fees sanctions.
