(2) Motions to Compel Responses to

Moving Party: Defendant Laurence Kim
Responding Party: Plaintiffs Ines Aquino, Emily
Morales, and Michelle Morales
 
T/R:      DEFENDANT’S MOTIONS TO COMPEL RESPONSES
TO DISCOVERY ARE DENIED.
 
DEFENDANT’S REQUESTS FOR SANCTIONS ARE
DENIED.
 
DEFENDANT TO NOTICE. 
 
If the parties wish to submit on the tentative, please
email the courtroom at SMCdept54@lacourt.org with
notice to opposing counsel (or self-represented party) before 8:00 am on the
day of the hearing.
The Court considers the moving papers,
opposition, and reply.
 
When timely responses to
interrogatories are not received, “[t]he party propounding the interrogatories
may move for an order compelling response to the interrogatories.”  (CCP § 2030.290(b).) “If a party to whom a demand
for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is directed fails to serve a
timely response to it. . .  [t]he party
to whom the demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is directed
waives any objection to the demand, including one based on privilege or on the
protection for work product. . . .  The
party making the demand may move for an order compelling response to the
demand.”  (CCP § 2031.300(a)–(b).)
 
Defendant moves compel responses to FIs
and RPDs, set one, from Plaintiffs. Defendant served the discovery on June 4,
2024. Responses were due on July 10, 2024. Plaintiffs requested an extension to
respond to July 22, 2024, which Defendant granted. Plaintiffs then requested an
additional extension, which Defendant denied. In opposition, Plaintiffs
represent that responses were served on July 22, 2024 by email, and
verification followed on July 31, 2024. 
 
As responses have been served, the
motions are DENIED as moot. The Court notes that Defendant, who is not
represented by an attorney, cannot recover attorney’s fees sanctions.
