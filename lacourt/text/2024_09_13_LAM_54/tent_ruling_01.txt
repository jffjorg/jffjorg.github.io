DISMISSAL IS DENIED.

CCP § 473(d) provides that “[t]he court
may . . . on motion of either party after notice to the other party, set aside
any void judgment or order.” “Extrinsic fraud occurs when a party is deprived
of his opportunity to present his claim or defense to the court, where he was
kept in ignorance or in some other manner fraudulently prevented from fully
participating in the proceeding.” (Gibble v. Car-Lene Research, Inc.
(1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 295, 315.) The statutory time limits on relief under CCP
§§ 473(b) and 473.5 do not apply, but once the purported extrinsic fraud or
mistake is discovered, a party is expected to proceed diligently to seek
relief. (Rappleyea v. Campbell (1994) 8 Cal.4th 975, 983-984.)
 
The parties executed a settlement
agreement in January 2021. The action was voluntarily dismissed on March 16,
2022. On September 12, 2022, the Court granted Plaintiffs’ motion to enforce
the settlement and enter judgment against U Work and Guillermo Rubio. On March
6, 2023, Plaintiffs moved to set aside the settlement, asserting that they were
unaware Defendant U Work was a suspended corporation at the time of settlement
agreement, precluding U Work from entering into a settlement agreement. The
Court denied this motion because Plaintiffs did not provide law stating the Court
had authority to set aside the settlement.
 
Though the statutory time limits for
setting aside dismissal do not apply to cases of extrinsic fraud, Plaintiff has
not diligently moved to set aside the dismissal. Dismissal was entered more
than two years ago. Plaintiff has known of the facts giving rise to this motion
for at least a year. In addition, Plaintiff has not shown that the March 16,
2022 order is “void” under Section 473(d). 
 
Plaintiff’s motion is DENIED.
