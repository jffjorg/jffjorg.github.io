## English Summary:

**Case:** This is an insurance subrogation case where Progressive Select Insurance Company (Progressive) is suing Ervin Flores for damages.

**Background:** In 2018, Flores was driving and lost control of his vehicle, causing a collision with another car driven by Patricia Quintero.  Progressive paid Quintero's medical and property damage expenses under her insurance policy. Progressive then sued Flores for negligence to recover those expenses.

**Current Status:** Flores failed to respond to the lawsuit, resulting in a default judgment being entered against him. Progressive has now applied for a default judgment.

**Judge's Ruling:** Based on the evidence presented, the judge has tentatively ruled to grant Progressive's application for default judgment. This means Flores will be held liable for the $63,844.41 Progressive paid to Quintero, plus $519 in costs, for a total of $64,363.41.
