The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Lucinda Uzeta Hernandez v. Adam Torres, Lisa Torres, Rosie Gutierrez, Joshua Gutierrez, Rosa Torres, Florentino Torres, Juan Jose Uzeta, and Marrisa I. Uzeta. The case involves a dispute over the ownership of a residential property in La Puente, California, and the judge has ordered the parties to meet and confer to resolve their differences.

The judge has also ordered the parties to file a supplemental declaration describing their meet and confer efforts at least nine court days before the next scheduled hearing. The judge has CONTINUED the demurrers filed by the defendants to a date to be determined at the hearing in Department G (Pomona).

The judge's ruling is based on the parties' failure to adequately meet and confer, as required by Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41. The judge has discretion to order the parties to meet and confer to resolve their differences, and the judge has exercised that discretion in this case.
