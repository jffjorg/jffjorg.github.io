## English Summary

The judge is considering two demurrers filed by different groups of defendants in a quiet title lawsuit. The lawsuit involves a property dispute over a house in La Puente (the "La Puente Property"). The plaintiff, Lucinda Uzeta Hernandez, alleges that other defendants, including Rosa and Florentino Torres, Juan Jose Uzeta, and Adam, Lisa, Rosie, and Joshua Gutierrez, have wrongfully obtained ownership or control of the property through various actions like misrepresentation, fraud, and financial exploitation.

The judge has decided to **continue the hearing** because the defendants did not adequately meet and confer with the plaintiff's attorney before filing their demurrers. This means the defendants must discuss the case with the plaintiff's attorney again to try to resolve their disagreements. They need to file a declaration with the court detailing their meeting and conferral efforts before the next hearing.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is continuing the demurrers filed by the defendants (Adam Torres, Lisa Torres, Rosie Gutierrez, Joshua Gutierrez, Rosa Torres, Florentino Torres, Juan Jose Uzeta, and Marrisa I. Uzeta) to the plaintiff's (Lucinda Uzeta Hernandez) first amended complaint. The defendants seek to dismiss certain causes of action, including slander of title, financial and elder abuse, intentional infliction of emotional distress, fraud, and false imprisonment.

The judge finds that the parties did not adequately meet and confer before filing the demurrers, and therefore orders the defendants' counsel to meet and confer with the plaintiff's counsel to discuss the pleadings and file a supplemental declaration describing the meet and confer efforts. The hearing date is being continued to a date to be determined.

The judge is requiring the parties to meet and confer to discuss the issues and potentially resolve the objections to the demurrers. This is to ensure that the parties have a meaningful discussion about the pleadings and to reduce the number of issues or eliminate the need for a demurrer.

Here is an English text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The case involves a dispute over the ownership of a residential property in La Puente, California. The plaintiff, Lucinda Uzeta Hernandez, is seeking to quiet title to the property, which she claims was transferred to her in 1976. The defendants, including Rosa Torres, Florentino Torres, Juan Jose Uzeta, and others, are contesting the ownership of the property. The defendants have filed demurrers to the plaintiff's First Amended Complaint, arguing that certain causes of action are defective. The judge has found that the parties did not adequately meet and confer before filing the demurrers, as required by Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41. Therefore, the judge has continued the hearing to a future date, ordering the parties to further meet and confer in an attempt to resolve the issues. The judge has also ordered the defendants' counsel to file a supplemental declaration describing their meet and confer efforts at least nine court days before the next scheduled hearing.
