```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Plaintiff Rosindo Sandoval's motion to vacate the order sending the parties to arbitration. The judge found that the Q&B Defendants did not materially breach the arbitration agreement by failing to pay the $8,000 deposit on time. The judge also found that the AAA did not comply with the statutory requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 1281.98 by failing to send the invoice to the parties directly.

The judge has granted the Q&B Defendants' motion to compel arbitration, finding that a valid agreement to arbitrate exists and that the agreement encompasses the dispute at issue. The judge has denied the Q&B Defendants' request for sanctions, as it was not requested in a separate motion.

The dispute arose from allegations of employment discrimination and harassment by David Caudillo and Francisco Arroyo against Rosindo Sandoval, a veteran with disabilities. Sandoval filed a complaint against Q&B Foods, Caudillo, Shimono, and Arroyo, and the parties subsequently stipulated to submit to arbitration. The Q&B Defendants moved to compel arbitration and requested sanctions, while Sandoval moved to vacate arbitration.
