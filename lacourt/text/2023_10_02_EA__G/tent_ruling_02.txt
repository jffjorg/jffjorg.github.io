for Default Judgment
Respondent: NO OPPOSITION
TENTATIVE RULING
Plaintiff Progressive Select Insurance Company’s Application
for Default Judgment is GRANTED.
BACKGROUND
This
is an insurance subrogation action arising from an automobile accident. In
November 2018, Defendant Ervin Flores was driving eastbound on State Route 60
in Diamond Bar. While it was raining, Flores lost control of the vehicle and
swerved in front of a vehicle operated by Patricia Quintero, causing the two
vehicles to collide. Pursuant to an automobile insurance policy held by
Quintero, Plaintiff Progressive Select Insurance Company (Progressive) paid
Quintero a total of $63,844.41 for personal injuries and property damage.
On January
26, 2023, Progressive filed a complaint against Flores and Does 1-20 for motor
vehicle negligence. On February 10, Progressive’s process server served Flores
with substitute service in Los Angeles.
On June
20, 2023, default was entered against Flores. On August 22, Progressive
submitted the present application for default judgment.
An
OSC Re: Default/Default Judgment is set for October 2, 2023.
LEGAL STANDARD
Code
of Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a
party has filed to timely respond or appear.  A party seeking judgment on
the default by the court must file a Request for Court Judgment, and: (1) a
brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other admissible evidence in
support of the judgment requested; (3) interest computations as necessary; (4)
a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) a proposed form of judgment; (6) a
dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application
for separate judgment under CCP § 579, supported by a showing of grounds for
each judgment; (7) exhibits as necessary; and (8) a request for attorneys’ fees
if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.  (Cal. Rules of
Court 3.1800.)
ANALYSIS
Progressive
seeks default judgment against Flores in the total amount of $64,363.41,
including $63,844.41 in damages and $519 in costs. Because the court finds Progressive
has submitted sufficient evidence, the court GRANTS their application
for default judgment.
CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, Progressive’s
application for default judgment is GRANTED.
