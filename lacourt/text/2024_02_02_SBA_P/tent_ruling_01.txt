BACKGROUND
            On October 18, 2021, Plaintiff Lidia
Barba initiated this against defendants Peter Seav (“Seav”), Bunthoeurn Plong
(“Plong”), Jane Doe and Does 1 through 50, alleging the following causes of
action: (1) Discrimination in Violation of the FEHA (Gov’t Code §§ 12940, et
seq.); (2) Harassment in Violation of the FEHA (Gov’t Code §§ 12940, et
seq.); (3) Failure to Prevent Discrimination and Harassment in Violation of

Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress; (7) Negligent Infliction of
Emotional Distress; (8) Negligence; (9) Negligent Hiring and Supervision; and
(10) Wrongful Constructive Termination in Violation of Public Policy. 
            On May 20, 2022, plaintiff

            On January 18, 2023, plaintiff filed

Inc. (“TK Donuts”) as defendants.
            On January 24, 2023, plaintiff filed
an Amendment to Complaint, naming Phickheang In (“In”) as a defendant. 
            On July 31, 2023, plaintiff filed
the operative First Amended Complaint against defendants Plong, Inc. TK Donuts,
Rose Donuts and Ice Cream TK Fam and Does 3 through 50, alleging the following
causes of action: (1) Sexual Harassment in Violation of the FEHA; (2) Battery;
(3) Assault; (4) Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress; (5) Sexual

            On October 20, 2023, Defendants In,
TK Donuts, and TK Fam filed their respective demurrers to the FAC, which are
set to be heard on March 3, 2023.
            Now, Defendants In, TK Donuts, and

each of their Requests for Judicial Notice on June 15, 2023 and October 20,
2023. No opposition has been filed. 
 
LEGAL AUTHORITY
California Rules of Court (“CRC”),
Rule 2.550(c) states:  “Unless confidentiality is required by law, court
records are presumed to be open.”  But a party may move to seal records
pursuant to Rules 2.550-2.551.  CRC Rule 2.551(b)(1) states:  “A
party requesting that a record be filed under seal must file a motion or an application
for an order sealing the record.  The motion or application must be
accompanied by a memorandum and a declaration containing facts sufficient to
justify the sealing.”  CRC Rule 2.550(d) states:  “The court may
order that a record be filed under seal only if it expressly finds facts that
establish:   
(1) There exists an overriding
interest that overcomes the right of public access to the record; 
(2) The overriding interest
supports sealing the record; 
(3) A substantial probability
exists that the overriding interest will be prejudiced if the record is not
sealed; 
(4) The proposed sealing is
narrowly tailored; and 
(5) No less restrictive means exist
to achieve the overriding interest.” 
 
DISCUSSION
            Defendants
In, TK Donuts, and TK
Fam requests the court to retroactively seal a portion of an exhibit filed in
their respective Requests for Judicial Notice because this repeated exhibit
inadvertently includes an unredacted social security number.  Motion at pp. 3-4; Takhsh Decl. ¶¶ 3-5.  In order to further protect this private
information, the motion does not identify the specific exhibit but defendants’
counsel will provide this information on the day of the hearing.  Motion at pg. 3, fn. 1.
The court
makes the following findings of facts that establish the requirements set forth
in CRC Rule 2.550(d):  
(1) There
exists an overriding interest in protecting disclosure of an individual’s
private information, such as a social security number.  See Takhsh Decl. ¶
3. 
(2) The
overriding interest of protecting the individual supports sealing the records
because such information is sensitive and private.   
(3) A
substantial probability exists that the overriding interest of protecting this
information will be prejudiced if the records are not sealed.  See CRC
Rule 1.201.
(4) The
proposed sealing is narrowly tailored to only include the social security
number.  
(5) No
less restrictive means exist to achieve the overriding interest because of the
nature of the record to be sealed.  
The
motion is therefore GRANTED.   The court orders defendant to
file a duplicate copy of the exhibits with appropriate redactions that are
consistent with this ruling within 5 days. 
Defendant
is ordered to give notice of ruling.
