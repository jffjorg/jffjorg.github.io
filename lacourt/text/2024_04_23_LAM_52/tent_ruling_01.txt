  Case Number:  23STCV03290    Hearing Date:   April 23, 2024    Dept:  52 Defendant
Reiko Durwood’s Motion to Continue Trial 
            Defendant Reiko Durwood moves to
continue the trial of this action by 6 months. 
“The court may grant a
continuance only on an affirmative showing of good cause requiring” it.  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(c).)  
            Defendant
shows good cause to continue the trial.  Good
cause includes “[t]he unavailability of trial counsel because of death,
illness, or other excusable circumstances.” 
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(c)(3).)  The trial is set for June 24, 2024.  Defendant’s counsel is engaged to try another
case beginning June 10.  (Lewin Decl., ¶
2.)  He also may have a conflicting trial
in a long cause trial set for May 20, 2024. 
(Id., ¶ 3.)  
            When
ruling on a motion to continue trial, the court must consider “[w]hether there
was any previous continuance” (rule 3.1332(d)(2)), among other factors.  Plaintiff filed this action on February 14,
2023, and defendant answered on May 18, 2023. 
The trial has not been continued before. 
Continuing the trial serves the interests of justice.   
            Defendant Reiko Durwood’s motion to
continue trial is granted.  The
court hereby continues the final status conference from June 10, 2024,
to January 6, 2025, at 9:00 a.m.  The
court hereby continues the jury trial from June 24, 2024, to January 22,
2025, at 10:00 a.m.  All pretrial
deadlines are continued to follow the new trial date.
