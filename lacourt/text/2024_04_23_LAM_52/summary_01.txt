And here is the English-text summary:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Reiko Durwood, granting her motion to continue the trial by six months. The trial was originally set for June 24, 2024, but due to Defendant's counsel having a conflicting trial on June 10, 2024, and possibly another on May 20, 2024, the Court has continued the trial to January 22, 2025. The Court considered the Defendant's showing of good cause, including the unavailability of trial counsel due to conflicting trials, and concluded that continuing the trial serves the interests of justice. The Court also continued the final status conference to January 6, 2025, and all pretrial deadlines to follow the new trial date.
