* "The Complaint is permissible to the extent relating to the additional promotions that were not encompassed in the SAC in 20STCV27418."
* "If Sklar is also seeking to pursue the prior promotions and other misconduct discussed in the SAC, these claims would be stayed given that they are pending against the County in 20STCV27418."

Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge is considering the demurrer filed by the defendants, County of LA and Ricardo Garcia, and is deciding whether to sustain or overrule the demurrer. The Plaintiff, Michael Sklar, filed a Complaint alleging FEHA discrimination, retaliation, harassment, and failure to prevent misconduct. The defendants demurred, arguing that the claims are the same as those in a previous action, 20STCV27418. The Judge is sustaining the demurrer, but granting the Plaintiff 20 days to amend the Complaint to clearly indicate the adverse actions that are at issue and that are different from those in 20STCV27418. The Judge notes that the harassment claim is somewhat different in that it mentions spoliation and includes other new allegations about further promotions, but is uncertain as to what allegations/claims are directly at issue within this action. The Judge is also granting the request for judicial notice.
