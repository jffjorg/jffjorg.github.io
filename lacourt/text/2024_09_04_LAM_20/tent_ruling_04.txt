 On September 20, 2023, Plaintiff Michael Sklar filed the operative Complaint for (1) FEHA discrimination, (2) FEHA retaliation, (3) FEHA harassment, and (4) FEHA failure to prevent misconduct. Defendants County of LA and Ricardo Garcia now demur to the Complaint because there is another action pending between the same parties on the same cause of action.  Specifically, they contend that this suit is “the same as an earlier filed action Sklar 1 [(20STCV27418)] that is set to begin trial on March 3, 2025. . . . The Complaint is exactly the same as the proposed Third Amended Complaint in Sklar 1 that Plaintiff could not obtain leave of court to file.” Plaintiff focuses on the fact that this action was deemed not to be related to 20STCV27418.When considering demurrers, courts read the allegations liberally and in context, and “treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded, but not contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law.” (Serrano v. Priest (1971) 5 Cal.3d 584, 591.)  “A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters. Therefore, it lies only where the defects appear on the face of the pleading or are judicially noticed. The only issue involved in a demurrer hearing is whether the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous matters, states a cause of action.”  (Hahn v. Mirda¿(2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.)  It is error “to sustain a demurrer without leave to amend if the plaintiff shows there is a reasonable possibility any defect identified by the defendant can be cured by amendment.”  (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital Dist.¿(1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 967.)“A plea in abatement pursuant to section 430.10, subdivision (c), may be made by demurrer or answer when there is another action pending between the same parties on the same cause of action. (Lawyers Title, supra, 151 Cal.App.3d at p. 459; Childs v. Eltinge, supra, 29 Cal.App.3d at p. 848.) In determining whether the causes of action are the same for purposes of pleas in abatement, the rule is that such a plea may be maintained only where a judgment in the first action would be a complete bar to the second action. (Lord v. Garland (1946) 27 Cal.2d 840, 848 [168 P.2d 5].) Where a demurrer is sustained on the ground of another action pending, the proper order is not a dismissal, but abatement of further proceedings pending termination of the first action. (§ 597; Lord v. Garland, supra, at p. 850; Franchise Tax Board v. Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. (1978) 87 Cal.App.3d 878, 884 [151 Cal.Rptr. 460]; Childs v. Eltinge, supra, at p. 848.)”  (Plant Insulation Co. v. Fibreboard Corp. (1990) 224 Cal.App.3d 781, 787–88.) To determine whether the same causes of action are asserted, courts employ the primary rights theory.  (Brinton v. Bankers Pension Services, Inc. (1999) 76 Cal.App.4th 550, 557.)  Under the primary rights theory, the invasion of one primary right gives rise to a single cause of action, which consists of (1) a primary right possessed by the plaintiff, (2) a corresponding primary duty owed by the defendant, and (3) a delict or wrong by the defendant which consists in a breach of the primary right and corresponding duty.  (Ibid.)  At bottom, a cause of action is based on the harm suffered, as opposed to the legal theory articulated.  (Ibid.)In 20STCV27418, Sklar filed a Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”) alleging claims for FEHA discrimination, harassment, retaliation, and failure to prevent misconduct—which are the same claims here.  The SAC also asserted a whistleblower retaliation claim.  Thereafter, the court in 20STCV27418 dismissed the harassment and whistleblower claims pursuant to a demurrer.  Sklar then filed a motion for leave to file a third amended complaint (“TAC”) wherein he sought to allege that he had been subject to further discrimination, harassment, and retaliation in that, since the filing of the Complaint, he was passed up for seven additional promotions.  The TAC sought to reassert all claims.  The motion for leave to file the TAC was denied.  Sklar then filed another motion to file a TAC and this time asserted that Plaintiff could not have moved earlier for an amendment due to Defendants’ spoliation of evidence.  That motion was also denied.  The claims for FEHA retaliation and FEHA harassment were eliminated against the County pursuant to their summary judgment motion.  The Complaint herein is permissible to the extent relating to the additional promotions that were not encompassed in the SAC in 20STCV27418.  Indeed, these would constitute new causes of action, and the denial of a motion for leave to amend does not typically preclude a separate lawsuit on such claims.  It is not clear if Sklar is also seeking to pursue the prior promotions and other misconduct discussed in the SAC.  If so, these claims would be stayed given that they are pending against the County in 20STCV27418.  The Complaint is uncertain in this regard and requires amendment to clearly indicate the adverse actions that are at issue and that are different from those in 20STCV27418.  Garcia was dismissed from 20STCV27418 such that there is no claim apparently pending against him therein.  Thus, the issue for Garcia would seem to be res judicata.  “Res judicata precludes the relitigation of a cause of action only if (1) the decision in the prior proceeding is final and on the merits; (2) the present action is on the same cause of action as the prior proceeding; and (3) the parties in the present action or parties in privity with them were parties to the prior proceeding.”  (Zevnik v. Superior Court (2008) 159 Cal.App.4th 76, 82; see also Ferraro v. Camarlinghi (2008) 161 Cal.App.4th 509, 541 n.21 [distinguishing between claim preclusion (res judicata) and issue preclusion (collateral estoppel)].)  Here, the harassment claim is somewhat different in that it mentions spoliation and includes other new allegations about further promotions.  On the other hand, it also includes allegations from the SAC that were dismissed and, in this regard, there is again uncertainty as to what allegations/claims are directly at issue within this action.  The Court notes that Defendants never challenged whether the substantive elements for Plaintiff’s claims were properly pleaded.  In sum, the Demurrer is sustained, with 20 days leave to amend.  The RJNs are granted.Moving parties to give notice.If counsel do not submit on the tentative, they are strongly encouraged to appear by LACourtConnect rather than in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
