Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in this case, addressing the issue of duty and causation in the motion for summary judgment. The court notes that the plaintiff's statement of special circumstances (SS) has overwhelmed the court, making it difficult to focus on the one issue at hand. The court finds that the plaintiff's reliance on Jackson v. Hardy is inapposite and that the defendants do not meaningfully address the issue of duty and causation.

The court concludes that the issue of causation was not adequately addressed in the motion and reply, and is therefore waived. The court also finds that the defendants' objections to the plaintiff's evidence are conclusory and are therefore overruled. The court notes that the plaintiff's expert, Brad Avrit, stated that the Ethanac Road entrance/exit was closed on the date of the accident, which is relevant to the issue of duty and causation.

The court references several cases, including Jackson v. Hardy, Schwartz v. Helms Bakery Limited, Gerard v. Wilson Holding Co., and Hernandez v. Jensen, to support its conclusions. The court concludes that the defendants' motion for summary judgment is denied, and that the issue of duty and causation must be addressed at trial.
