And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the petition filed by Christina Montano, guardian ad litem for Aliyah Richards, a minor, seeking approval of a compromise of the claim. The compromise arises from a slip and fall accident that occurred on February 16, 2022, in which Aliyah suffered a right forearm displaced radius shaft re-fracture. The court has approved the compromise, which results in a settlement of $17,500.00, with Aliyah entitled to $11,331.91 after attorney fees and expenses. The court's decision is based on the provisions of CCP ยง372(a)(1), which requires that minors, individuals who lack legal capacity, or individuals for whom a conservator has been appointed appear in court through a guardian or conservator, guardian ad litem, or a judge.
