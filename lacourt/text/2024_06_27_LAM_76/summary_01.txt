And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses a motion by the defendant, National Carrier Exchange, Inc., to compel responses to form interrogatories, special interrogatories, requests for production of documents, and to have requests for admissions deemed admitted, as well as a request for sanctions. The defendant had combined four motions into one, only paid one filing fee, and only reserved one hearing date. The court will address all four motions, but its order will not take effect until the plaintiff pays an additional $180 in filing fees. The judge also orders the plaintiff to serve and file verified responses to discovery requests by June 28, 2024, and denies the defendant's request for sanctions as the notice of motion did not comply with Civil Procedure Code, ยง 2023.040.
