And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to dismiss the case. The defendant, Robert Nagle/HLR Wright Rd, LLC, is a pro per litigant who is seeking to dismiss the case after a judgment was entered in favor of the plaintiffs on January 3, 2024. The judge ruled that there is no authority for this motion since judgment has already been entered, and that pro per litigants are not entitled to special treatment. The judge cited two California court cases, Harding v. Collazo and Gamet v. Blanchard, to support this ruling. The hearing date is set for June 27, 2024.
