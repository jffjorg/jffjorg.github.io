  Case Number:  20STCV35697    Hearing Date:   June 27, 2024    Dept:  76             Plaintiff alleges that he was
subjected to disability discrimination and sexual harassment and wage and hour
violations, and was wrongfully terminated. 
 
Defendant National Carrier
Exchange, Inc. moves to compel responses to form interrogatories, special
interrogatories, request for production of documents and to have requests for
admissions deemed admitted, as well as for sanctions.
 
TENTATIVE RULING
            
            Defendant
improperly combined four motions into one motion, only paid one filing fee, and
only reserved one hearing date. Although the Court will address all four
motions, the Court’s order will not take effect until Plaintiff pays an
additional $180 in filing fees. 
 
            Attached
to the Declaration of Kevin Mahoney in support of the Opposition are unverified
responses served by Plaintiff’s prior counsel on March 8, 2022. However,
Defendant served the discovery requests on December 6, 2021, so the March 8,
2022 were untimely and all objections were waived. Moreover, unverified
responses are tantamount to no responses at all[1].
A motion to compel further responses only begins to run upon the service of
verified responses[2].   
 
            Plaintiff
is ordered to serve and file verifications by June 28, 2024. At that point,
Defendant’s time to move for further responses—in light of the objections
having been waived, and the substantive responses now verified—will begin to
run. If Plaintiff wishes to seek relief from waiver, a noticed motion is
required. 
 
            Defendant’s
request for sanctions is DENIED. The notice of motion did not comply with Civ.
Proc. Code, § 2023.040, which requires that the notice of motion identify every
person, party and attorney against whom the sanction is sought, and specify the
type of sanction sought.
