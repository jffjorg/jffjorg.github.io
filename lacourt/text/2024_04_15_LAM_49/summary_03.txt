This tentative ruling grants Friedman & Chapman, LLP's motion to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff Andre Butler in a breach of habitability action. The Plaintiffs, Deborah Furbush, Andrew Butler, and Adonis Brown, allege that the property owned or managed by Wagner Strand, LLC displays various habitability issues, including lack of hot water, mold and mildew, and rodent infestations. The motion is unopposed. The court finds that good cause for withdrawal has been demonstrated, as the client has become unresponsive and counsel is unable to provide discovery responses. Therefore, the motion is granted and counsel is ordered to give notice.
