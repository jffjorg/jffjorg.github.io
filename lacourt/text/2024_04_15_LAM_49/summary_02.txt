And here is the English-text summary of the Tentative Ruling:

The court has granted the defendants' motion to quash service of the summons and complaint, finding that the service by mail and acknowledgment of receipt is incomplete because the defendants did not sign or return the acknowledgment of receipt forms. The court also denied the defendants' motion to dismiss the action for delay in prosecution without prejudice, as the defendants did not provide the required 45-day notice of the motion.
