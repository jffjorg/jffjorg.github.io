And here is the English-text summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling:

The Judge grants the Plaintiff's Motion for Leave to File a First Amended Complaint. The Plaintiff seeks to add new causes of action for intentional concealment, breach of contract, and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing against the Defendants. The Plaintiff argues that it did not learn of the facts underlying the new claims and allegations until conducting discovery in the Fall of 2023. The Defendants oppose the motion, arguing that the claims are barred by the applicable statute of limitations and that the amendments would be highly prejudicial. However, the Court finds that the Plaintiff's motion complies with the applicable rules and that the Defendants have not demonstrated they will be unduly prejudiced by the amendments. The Court grants the motion and orders the Plaintiff to file and serve a stand-alone First Amended Complaint within 10 days.
