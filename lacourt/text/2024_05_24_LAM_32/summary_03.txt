And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the plaintiff's motion to redact documents. The plaintiff had claimed that the defendant had exposed her real name in certain filings, despite a protective order to proceed under a pseudonym. The judge has granted the motion to redact, ordering the defendant's filings to be sealed and redacting the plaintiff's name and telephone numbers. The judge has also denied the defendant's request for sanctions. The court has ordered the defendant to file the redacted documents within 20 days.
