     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
defendants’ motion for terminating
  sanctions




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On December 3, 2021, Plaintiffs
Gregory Kingston, Paul Kingston, Gail Kingston, and Victoria Kingston-Allen
filed this action against Defendants The Estate of Robert Blaisch, The Estate
of Kenneth Eldon, and State Farm Insurance Company. The operative First Amended
Complaint, filed July 25, 2022, alleges (1) personal injury and property
damage, (2) breach of contract, (3) breach of the implied covenant of good
faith and fair dealing, and (4) bad faith denial of insurance coverage. 
            Plaintiffs owned a duplex in Los
Angeles, in which Robert Blaisch and Kenneth Eldon were tenants. The duplex
burned down in a fire due to the alleged negligence of Blaisch and Eldon, who
perished in the fire. Plaintiffs bring the first cause of action for personal
and property damage against the estates of Blaisch and Eldon. Plaintiffs bring
the second through fourth causes of action against State Farm for denying
insurance coverage after the fire. 
The claims against State Farm were subsequently
dismissed on summary judgment, leaving only the first cause of action for
personal injury and property damage, which is only brought by Plaintiff Gregory
Kingston against the Estates of Kenneth Eldon and Robert Blaisch. Therefore,
the only remaining parties are Plaintiff Gregory Kingston and the two estates.
On February 21, 2024, the Court granted
Defendants’ eight motions to compel responses from Plaintiff. The Court ordered
responses within 15 days and imposed monetary sanctions. 
On April 12, 2024, Defendants filed the
instant motion for terminating sanctions based on Plaintiff’s failure to abide
by the court order. Plaintiff has not filed an opposition. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
The Court may impose monetary or
nonmonetary sanctions against a party engaging in misuse of the discovery
process. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030.) Misuse of the discovery process is
defined as, among other things, failing to respond to an authorized method of
discovery, making an evasive response to discovery, or disobeying a court order
for discovery. (Id., § 2023.010.) If a lesser sanction fails to curb
misuse, a greater sanction is warranted: continuing misuses of the discovery
process warrant incrementally harsher sanctions until the sanction is reached
that will curb the abuse. (Doppes v. Bentley Motors, Inc. (2009) 174
Cal.App.4th 967, 992.) “The penalty should be appropriate to the dereliction,
and should not exceed that which is required to protect the interests of the
party entitled to but denied discovery.” (Wilson v. Jefferson (1985) 163
Cal.App.3d 952, 959.) Generally, two facts are prerequisite to the imposition
of nonmonetary sanctions: (1) there must be a failure to comply with a court
order; and (2) the failure must be willful. (Biles v. Exxon Mobil Corp.
(2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1327.) 
DISCUSSION
            The subject discovery was propounded
back in July 2023, and Defendant granted multiple extensions and requested
multiple trial continuances while awaiting Plaintiff’s responses. (Hawkins
Decl. ¶¶ 5-6, 10-12, 15.) To date, Plaintiff has failed to provide the
court-ordered responses or pay the court-ordered sanctions. (Id., ¶ 21.)

Given the history of motions to compel and
monetary sanctions against the plaintiffs in this case, and the fact that
Plaintiff has failed to produce responses even with multiple extensions and a
court order, it is apparent that lesser sanctions will not suffice. Under these
circumstances, terminating sanctions are warranted. 
Although the Estate of Elden propounded
the subject discovery requests, the interests of both Defendants are
sufficiently aligned such that the discovery applied to both Defendants, and
both were equally prejudiced by Plaintiff’s failure to respond. Therefore, the
Estate of Blaisch is entitled to benefit from the terminating sanction. (See Parker
v. Wolters Kluwer United States, Inc. (2007) 149 Cal.App.4th 285, 300-02.) 
CONCLUSION
            Defendants’ motion for terminating
sanctions is GRANTED.
