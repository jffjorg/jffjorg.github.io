And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The tentative ruling sustains the defendants' demurrer to the complaint without leave to amend. The plaintiff, Zuly Mejia de Martir, alleges that the defendants, Ana Helena Rankovic, D.D.S., and Ana Helena Rankovic, D.D.S., Inc., committed dental malpractice, intentional misconduct, lack of informed consent, pain and suffering, and emotional distress. The defendants filed a demurrer to the complaint, arguing that it fails to state a cause of action. The plaintiff argues that the defendants intentionally caused her harm and that she suffers from depression and anxiety. The court finds that the plaintiff's claims for intentional misconduct, pain and suffering, and emotional distress are not standalone causes of action and are therefore subject to demurrer. The court also finds that the plaintiff's allegations of emotional distress do not meet the severity standard for intentional infliction of emotional distress. The defendants shall file an answer within 20 days of the order.
