And here is the English summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted defendant Mega International, LLC's motion to compel arbitration, finding that defendant has proven an arbitration agreement by a preponderance of the evidence. The judge has also stayed the representative PAGA claims pending arbitration. The judge's ruling is based on the fact that plaintiff signed an arbitration agreement on January 15, 2023, and that the individual claims asserted in the complaint (except for the PAGA representative claim) are subject to arbitration. The judge has concluded that a stay is warranted to prevent duplicative litigation and inconsistent findings.
