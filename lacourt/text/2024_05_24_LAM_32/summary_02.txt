And here is the English summary:

This is a tentative ruling by the court regarding a motion for summary judgment filed by the defendants, Terrence Budd, Matthew Budd, and Hugo Budd. The plaintiff, Elise Fahey, is seeking to recover a supposed inheritance from Decedent Harold Budd, who allegedly agreed to give her 25% of his royalties in exchange for her care and companionship. The defendants argue that they had no knowledge of the alleged contract and therefore cannot be liable for interfering with the contract. The court finds that the defendants have met their initial burden of disproving an essential element of the claim, and since the plaintiff does not oppose the motion and presents no evidence raising a triable issue, the first cause of action fails as a matter of law. The court also finds that the second cause of action fails as a matter of law. Since the first two causes of action fail, the constructive trust remedy necessarily fails. Therefore, the court grants the defendants' motions for summary judgment.
