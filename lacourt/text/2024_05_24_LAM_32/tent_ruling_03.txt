JANE DOE,
                        Plaintiff,
            v.
 
LUIS DIAZ ROJAS, 
                        Defendant.
  


 
  Case No.:  22STCV41020
  Hearing Date:  May 24, 2024
 
     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
plaintiff’s motion to redact   




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On December 30, 2022, Plaintiff Jane
Doe filed this action against Defendant Luis Diaz Rojas stemming from an
alleged sexual assault. 
            On March 22, 2024, the Court denied
Plaintiff’s motion to seal documents, finding that Plaintiff did not provide
sufficient information on the information that needed to be sealed. 
            On April 9, 2024, Plaintiff filed
the instant motion to redact, once again arguing that Defendant has exposed her
real name in certain filings. Defendant filed his opposition on May 13, 2024.
Plaintiff filed her reply on May 15, 2024. 
            On May 15, 2024 Plaintiff filed a
notice of lodging of unredacted copy of Notice. 
          
LEGAL STANDARD
“Unless confidentiality is required by
law, court records are presumed to be open.” (Cal. Rules of Ct., Rule
2.550(c).) “The court may order that a record be filed under seal only if it
expressly finds facts that establish: (1) There exists an overriding interest
that overcomes the right of public access to the record; (2) The overriding
interest supports sealing the record; (3) A substantial probability exists that
the overriding interest will be prejudiced if the record is not sealed; (4) The
proposed sealing is narrowly tailored; and (5) No less restrictive means exist
to achieve the overriding interest.” (Id., Rule 2.550(d).) “A record
must not be filed under seal without a court order.” (Id., Rule
2.551(a).)  
DISCUSSION
            On February 8, 2023, the Court
granted Plaintiff’s motion for a protective order to proceed under the Doe
pseudonym. Thus, all references to Plaintiff’s real name must be redacted prior
to filing. 
Plaintiff filed the instant motion
claiming that defense counsel only redacted some documents but not others.
Plaintiff expresses a concern that defense counsel may be covertly inserting
Plaintiff’s name in various filings in violation of the protective order. However,
as with her prior motion to seal, Plaintiff provides no information on the
filings that purportedly contain her real name. Plaintiff should have provided
the filing date and page number where the violation occurs. That information is
not confidential or subject to redaction. 
In the Lodged documents, Plaintiff points
out that her name is mentioned on page 29 of Defendant’s Motion to Compel Further
Responses to Request for production of documents filed on October 13,
2023.  In the Lodged documents, Plaintiff
points out that her telephone number, though blacked out, is still visible on
pages 55-61, including page 59 of Defendant’s Motion to Compel Further Responses
to Request for production of documents filed on October 13, 2023. In the Lodged
documents, Plaintiff claims that her name is on pages 20 and 25 of Defendant’s Opposition
to Plaintiff’s Motion for a Protective Order filed on January 2, 2024..  
CONCLUSION
            Plaintiff’s motion to redact is GRANTED.  Court orders Defendant’s Motion to Compel Further
Responses to Request for production of documents filed on October 13, 2023, and
Defendant’s Opposition to Plaintiff’s Motion for a Protective Order filed on January
2, 2024 to be sealed.  Defendant shall
file within 20 days Defendant’s Motion to Compel Further Responses to Request
for production of documents filed on October 13, 2023 and Defendant’s Opposition
to Plaintiff’s Motion for a Protective Order filed on January 2, 2024 with
Plaintiff’s name and telephone numbers redacted.  Hardcopies of the redacted documents shall be
filed directly in Department 32. The redacted documents should not be efiled.
Sanctions are denied.
