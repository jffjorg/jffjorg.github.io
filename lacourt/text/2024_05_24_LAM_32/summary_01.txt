And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

"The Court grants Defendant's motion for terminating sanctions against Plaintiff Gregory Kingston for his failure to comply with court orders and provide discovery responses. The Court finds that Plaintiff's repeated failures to comply with court orders and provide discovery responses warrant the imposition of terminating sanctions. The Court orders Plaintiff to provide the court-ordered responses and pay the court-ordered sanctions. The Court also finds that the interests of both Defendants are sufficiently aligned such that the discovery applied to both Defendants, and both were equally prejudiced by Plaintiff's failure to respond."
