  order RE:
plaintiff’s demurrer to answer 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On August 23, 2023, Plaintiff
Elizabeth Beissel, as administrator of the estate of Barry Floyd Dungy, filed
this action against Defendants Ara Kassabian and Ara Kassabian CPA, A
Professional Corporation. The complaint asserts causes of action for (1) breach
of oral contract, (2) breach of written contract, (3) common count – account
stated, (4) quasi-contract, (5) accounting, (6) fraud, and (7) declaratory
relief. Plaintiff filed the operative First Amended Complaint on December 20,
2023.
            Plaintiff is the daughter of
decedent Barry Lloyd Dungy, who operated a tax and accounting practice. (FAC ¶
9.) In May 2021, Plaintiff received an offer from Defendant Kassabian to
purchase the clients of Dungy’s practice. (Id., ¶ 10.) Kassabian sent a
Tentative Proposal, providing that Defendants would pay Plaintiff 20% of
revenues collected from the clients for two years. (Id., Ex. A.)
Kassabian allegedly represented that his attorneys would be drafting a more
definitive agreement, but this agreement was never exchanged, so the parties
allegedly proceeded under the Tentative Proposal. (Id., ¶ 12.) Plaintiff
alleges that she accepted the Proposal and handed over Dungy’s client
information. (Ibid.) 
            Plaintiff alleges that Kassabian
failed to make a good faith effort to transition the Dungy clients to his
practice, instead focusing on the few most profitable clients and neglecting
the majority of clients. (FAC ¶ 15.) By ignoring most of the Dungy clients,
Kassabian allegedly collected much less revenue from the clients than Dungy
himself did when he was alive, which meant that Plaintiff received a miniscule
return based on her 20% interest. (Id., ¶ 17.) Kassabian also allegedly
failed to pay Plaintiff for certain clients that were serviced. (Id., ¶
18.) Kassabian now denies any binding agreement between himself and Plaintiff
and claims that he has no legal obligation to pay anything to Plaintiff. (Id.,
¶ 19.) This action followed.      
            Defendants filed their answer on
April 10, 2024, issuing a general denial and asserting 26 affirmative defenses.

            On April 22, 2024, Plaintiff filed
the instant demurrer to the answer. Defendants filed their opposition on May
13, 2024. Plaintiff filed her reply on May 15, 2024.
LEGAL STANDARD
A demurrer for sufficiency tests whether
the complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) When
considering demurrers, courts read the allegations liberally and in
context. (Taylor v. City of Los
Angeles Dept. of Water and Power (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1228.)
In a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of the
pleading or by proper judicial notice. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.30, subd.
(a).) A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other
extrinsic matters. (SKF Farms v. Superior
Court (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 902, 905.) Therefore, it lies only where the
defects appear on the face of the pleading or are judicially noticed. (Ibid.) The only issue involved in a
demurrer hearing is whether the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with
extraneous matters, states a cause of action. (Hahn, supra, 147 Cal.App.4th at 747.)
MEET AND CONFER
Before filing a demurrer or a motion to
strike, the demurring or moving party is required to meet and confer with the
party who filed the pleading demurred to or the pleading that is subject to the
motion to strike for the purposes of determining whether an agreement can be
reached through a filing of an amended pleading that would resolve the
objections to be raised in the demurrer. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 430.41, 435.5.)
The Court notes that Plaintiff has complied with the meet and confer
requirement. (See Sarni Decl.)
DISCUSSION
Plaintiff argues that the answer fails to
allege sufficient facts to constitute a defense. However, Defendant’s answer
pleads ultimate facts sufficient to inform Plaintiff of the nature of the
affirmative defenses. Any remaining ambiguities may be resolved in discovery.
(See Ludgate Ins. Co. v. Lockheed Martin Corp. (2000) 82 Cal.App.4th
592, 608.) A pleading
need
not be a “model of clarity” to survive demurrer. (A.J. Fistes Corp. v. GDL
Best Contractors, Inc. (2019) 38 Cal.App.5th 677, 695.) 
CONCLUSION
Plaintiff’s demurrer is OVERRULED.
