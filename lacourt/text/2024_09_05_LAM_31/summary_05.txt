And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion for leave to conduct a psychiatric examination of the plaintiff, John M.E.L. Doe, to determine the causes of his alleged psychological harm. The plaintiff was sexually abused by his teacher, Vance Miller, while a student at Hamilton Music Academy. The defendant, Los Angeles Unified School District, seeks to conduct a psychiatric examination to determine the causes of the plaintiff's alleged psychological harm.

The judge found that good cause exists for the examination because the plaintiff's responses to interrogatories and deposition testimony indicate that he attributes his intimacy problems to the abuse. The judge also found that the defendant's expert, Dr. James R. High, needs to inquire into the plaintiff's sexual history to determine the causes of his alleged psychological harm.

The judge ordered the plaintiff to appear for a psychiatric examination with Dr. High at a mutually agreeable date and time within 60 days of the court's order. The plaintiff is not to be sanctioned for opposing the motion, as he acted with substantial justification.
