And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion to strike the answer filed by PW Place LLC, a corporation, due to the company's default in the case. The judge rules that a corporation cannot appear in court without licensed counsel, and since PW Place LLC was in default when it filed its answer, it was not entitled to take any further steps in the litigation. The judge also cites prior court cases to support the ruling. As a result, the answer filed by PW Place LLC is stricken, and the plaintiffs are free to pursue default proceedings against the company.
