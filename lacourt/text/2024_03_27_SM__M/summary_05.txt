And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motions of defendants Todd Krauss and A. George Glasco to vacate the defaults taken against them. The defendants had argued that they mistakenly did not file a responsive pleading because they believed, in good faith, that a stay had been imposed on November 20, 2023. The judge found that the defendants had demonstrated reasonable "mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect" by relying on the stay of the entire action through the date of default. The judge also found that the plaintiff had not demonstrated that the defendants actually knew or had reasonable notice that the stay was lifted as to this action. As a result, the judge ordered that the defendants' demurrers be heard on August 21, 2024, and that defendant Krauss file his demurrer by March 29, 2024.
