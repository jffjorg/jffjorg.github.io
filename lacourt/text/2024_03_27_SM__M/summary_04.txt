And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling grants the defendants' motions to compel arbitration and orders the entire action to be stayed pending the completion of the arbitration. The court finds that there are valid, separate arbitration agreements between the plaintiff and each defendant, and that the contracts are substantially identical and involve factually identical breaches. The court also finds that there are interrelated issues of law and fact that risk inconsistent rulings if tried separately. The defendants argue that the court cannot order the cases consolidated because the contracts vest authority to decide "any dispute" between the parties with an arbitrator, and not the court. The court agrees and concludes that the arbitrator has exclusive authority to decide any dispute regarding the joinder of parties or consolidation of arbitration proceedings.
