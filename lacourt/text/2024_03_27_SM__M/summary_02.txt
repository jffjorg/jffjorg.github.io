And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings. The defendant argued that the plaintiff, YT Solutions India Pvt., is an Indian corporation that is not registered to do business in California and is therefore prohibited from maintaining any litigation in Superior Court until it registers and pays the requisite fees. The judge found that the plaintiff's complaint does not allege that it transacted intrastate business, and therefore the defendant's motion is based on a bald assertion that is extrinsic to the pleadings. The judge also noted that the record does not demonstrate that the plaintiff transacted any intrastate business and that the defendant's evidence was of limited value. As a result, the judge denied the defendant's motion.
