And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The plaintiff, Tammy Williams, moves for a continuance of the trial and related dates for at least 90 days from the current trial date of April 8, 2024. The plaintiff argues that there have been certain developments and delays in discovery that require additional time before trial. The defendant does not oppose the continuance. The judge grants the motion, citing good cause for the continuance. The plaintiff has demonstrated an excused inability to obtain material evidence despite diligent efforts. The judge sets a new trial date for May 2025 and orders related dates, including discovery cut-off, to follow the new trial date per statute.
