Case Number: 23STCP03872
Hearing Date: June 27, 2024
Dept: 85
Douglas Peter Richter v. California Department of Industrial Relations, et al.

Tentative Decision:
  - Demurrer to Second Amended Petition (SAP) sustained without leave

Plaintiff:
  - Douglas Peter Richter

Defendants:
  - California Department of Industrial Relations
  - Department of Labor Standards Enforcement (DLSE)
  - Ethera Clemons (Hearing Officer)
  - Wendy Corleto
  - Cristina Zamora
  - Karen Betancur
  - Lilia Garc√≠a-Brower

Summary:
  The judge's tentative ruling sustains the demurrer to the SAP without leave. The SAP alleges seven causes of action in traditional mandamus, including violations of procedural due process, equal protection, and statutory rights. The judge finds that the SAP fails to state a cause of action for several reasons, including lack of concrete factual allegations, failure to exhaust administrative remedies, and lack of jurisdiction.

Key Issues:
  - Exhaustion of administrative remedies
  - Jurisdiction
  - Structural and procedural challenges to the Labor Commissioner's statutory process
