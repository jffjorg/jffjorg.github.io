 Case Number:  23STCV17883    Hearing Date:   June 27, 2024    Dept:  85 
Monrovia-Myrtle,
LLC v. Khoury, 23STCV17883

Tentative decision on application
for right to attach order: granted 




 
Plaintiff Monrovia-Myrtle, LLC (“Monrovia”) applies for
right to attach order against Defendants George Khoury (“Khoury”). 
The court has read and considered the moving papers, opposition,
and reply, and renders the following tentative decision. 
 
A. Statement of
the Case
1. Complaint
On July 31, 2023, Plaintiff Monrovia filed a Complaint
against Defendant Khoury, doing business as Stix Ride Shop (“Stix”), alleging
causes of action for: (1) breach of written lease; (2) account stated; and (3)
money had and received.  The Complaint alleges
in pertinent part as follows.
Monrovia is the owner of 421 S. Myrtle Avenue, Monrovia, CA
91016 (“Property”).  Compl., ¶5.  On or about December 20, 2019, Monrovia and Khoury
entered into a commercial lease agreement for the Property (“Lease Agreement”)
for a term of five years commencing January 1, 2020 through December 31,
2024.  Compl., ¶8, Ex. 1.  In consideration for the use of the Property,
Khoury agreed to pay Monrovia base rent as of April 1, 2020 of $3,294.00 per
month, with rent to increase in accordance with the Lease Agreement.  Compl., ¶9. 
Khoury also agreed to pay Monrovia for utilities, a share of the
property taxes, and insurance (“Common Area Maintenance Expenses”).  Compl., ¶10.
Monrovia performed all terms, conditions and covenants of
the Lease Agreement except as excused by Khoury’s conduct.  Compl., ¶12. 
Khoury materially breached the Lease Agreement in that they failed to
pay Monrovia rent for April 2020. 
Compl., ¶¶12-13.  In April 2023,
Monrovia served Khoury with notices to pay/perform or quit, but he failed to
perform as required by the notices. 
Compl., ¶14.  On April 26, 2023,
Monrovia filed a complaint for unlawful detainer based upon the notices.  Compl., ¶14.
On or about July 12, 2023, Khoury vacated the Property.  Compl., ¶15. 
As a result of Khoury’s breach of the Lease Agreement, there is due,
owing and unpaid an amount not less than $130,000, including the rent,
commissions to brokers (if any), attorney’s fees incurred due to prior breaches
related to construction to the Property, physical damage to the Property, and
related charges and the unpaid balance of the term of the Lease Agreement, plus
interest at the maximum rate allowed by law. 
Compl., ¶16.
Monrovia seeks (1) attorney’s fees on the first cause of
action pursuant to the terms of the Lease Agreement; (2) damages in an amount
not less than $130,000 on the first, second, and third causes of action; (3)
interest at maximum rate allowable by law; (4) costs of suit incurred herein;
and (5) other and further relief as the court may deem just and proper.  Compl., p. 5.
 
2. Course of Proceedings 
On August 16, 2023, Plaintiff Monrovia filed proof of
service of the Summons and Complaint via personal service on Defendant Khoury,
effective August 15, 2023. 
On September 11, 2023, Defendant Khoury filed his Answer. 
 
B. Applicable Law
            Attachment
is a prejudgment remedy providing for the seizure of one or more of the
defendant’s assets to aid in the collection of a money demand pending the
outcome of the trial of the action.  See
Whitehouse v. Six Corporation, (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 527, 533.  In 1972, and in a 1977 comprehensive
revision, the Legislature enacted attachment legislation (CCP §481.010 et
seq.) that meets the due process requirements set forth in Randone v.
Appellate Department, (1971) 5 Cal.3d 536. 
See Western Steel & Ship Repair v. RMI, (12986) 176
Cal.App.3d 1108, 1115.  As the attachment
statutes are purely the creation of the Legislature, they are strictly
construed.  Vershbow v. Reiner,
(1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 879, 882.




            A
writ of attachment may be issued only in an action on a claim or claims for
money, each of which is based upon a contract, express or implied, where the
total amount of the claim or claims is a fixed or readily ascertainable amount
not less than five hundred dollars ($500). 
CCP §483.010(a).  A claim is
“readily ascertainable” where the amount due may be clearly ascertained from
the contract and calculated by evidence; the fact that damages are unliquidated
is not determinative.  CIT
Group/Equipment Financing, Inc. v. Super DVD, Inc., (2004) 115 Cal.App.4th
537, 540-41 (attachment appropriate for claim based on rent calculation for
lease of commercial equipment).
            All
property within California of a corporation, association, or partnership is
subject to attachment if there is a method of levy for the property.  CCP §487.010(a), (b).  While a trustee is a natural person, a trust
is not.  Therefore, a trust’s property is
subject to attachment on the same basis as a corporation or partnership.  Kadison, Pfaelzer, Woodard, Quinn &
Rossi v. Wilson, supra, 197 Cal.App.3d at 4.
            If
the action is against a defendant who is a natural person, an attachment may be
issued only on a commercial claim which arises out of the defendant’s conduct
of a trade, business, or profession.  CCP
§483.010(c).  Consumer transactions
cannot form a basis for attachment.   CCP
§483.010(c); Kadison, Pfaelzer, Woodard, Quinn & Rossi v. Wilson,
(1987) 197 Cal.App.3d 1, 4 (action involving trust property was a commercial,
not a consumer, transaction).
            The
plaintiff may apply for a right to attach order by noticing a hearing for the
order and serving the defendant with summons and complaint, notice of the
application, and supporting papers any time after filing the complaint.  CCP §484.010. 
Notice of the application must be given pursuant to CCP section 1005,
sixteen court days before the hearing.  See
ibid.
            The
notice of the application and the application may be made on Judicial Council
forms (Optional Forms AT-105, 115).  The
application must be supported by an affidavit showing that the plaintiff on the
facts presented would be entitled to a judgment on the claim upon which the
attachment is based.  CCP §484.030.  
            Where
the defendant is a corporation, a general reference to “all corporate property
which is subject to attachment pursuant to subdivision (a) of Code of Civil
Procedure Section 487.010” is sufficient. 
CCP §484.020(e).  Where the
defendant is a partnership or other unincorporated association, a reference to
“all property of the partnership or other unincorporated association which is
subject to attachment pursuant to subdivision (b) of Code of Civil Procedure
Section 487.010” is sufficient.  CCP
§484.020(e).  A specific description of
property is not required for corporations and partnerships as they generally
have no exempt property.  Bank of
America v. Salinas Nissan, Inc., (“Bank of America”) (1989) 207
Cal.App.3d 260, 268.
            Where
the defendant is a natural person, the description of the property must be
reasonably adequate to permit the defendant to identify the specific property
sought to be attached.  CCP §484.020(e).  Although the property must be specifically
described, the plaintiff may target for attachment everything the individual
defendant owns.  Bank of America v.
Salinas Nissan, Inc., (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 260, 268.
            A
defendant who opposes issuance of the order must file and serve a notice of
opposition and supporting affidavit as required by CCP section 484.060 not
later than five court days prior to the date set for hearing.  CCP §484.050(e).  The notice of opposition may be made on a
Judicial Council form (Optional Form AT-155). 

            The
plaintiff may file and serve a reply two court days prior to the date set for
the hearing.  CCP §484.060(c). 
            At
the hearing, the court determines whether the plaintiff should receive a right
to attach order and whether any property which the plaintiff seeks to attach is
exempt from attachment.  The defendant
may appear the hearing.  CCP
§484.050(h).  The court generally will
evaluate the attachment application based solely on the pleadings and
supporting affidavits without taking additional evidence.  Bank of America, supra, 207
Cal.App.3d at 273. A verified complaint may be used in lieu of or in addition
to an affidavit if it states evidentiary facts. 
CCP §482.040.  The plaintiff has
the burden of proof, and the court is not required to accept as true any
affidavit even if it is undisputed.  See
Bank of America, supra, at 271, 273.



            The
court may issue a right to attach order (Optional Form AT-120) if the plaintiff
shows all of the following: (1) the claim on which the attachment is based is
one on which an attachment may be issued (CCP §484.090(a)(1)); (2) the
plaintiff has established the probable validity of the claim (CCP
§484.090(a)(2)); (3) attachment is sought for no purpose other than the
recovery on the subject claim (CCP §484.090(a)(3); and (4) the amount to be
secured by the attachment is greater than zero (CCP §484.090(a)(4)). 
            A
claim has “probable validity” where it is more likely than not that the
plaintiff will recover on that claim. 
CCP §481.190.  In determining this
issue, the court must consider the relative merits of the positions of the
respective parties.  Kemp Bros.
Construction, Inc. v. Titan Electric Corp., (2007) 146 Cal.App.4th 1474,
1484.  The court does not determine
whether the claim is actually valid; that determination will be made at trial
and is not affected by the decision on the application for the order.  CCP §484.050(b).
            Except
in unlawful detainer actions, the amount to be secured by the attachment is the
sum of (1) the amount of the defendant’s indebtedness claimed by the plaintiff,
and (2) any additional amount included by the court for estimate of costs and
any allowable attorneys’ fees under CCP section 482.110.  CCP §483.015(a); Goldstein v. Barak
Construction, (2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 845, 852.  This amount must be reduced by the sum of (1)
the amount of indebtedness that the defendant has in a money judgment against
plaintiff, (2) the amount claimed in a cross-complaint or affirmative defense
and shown would be subject to attachment against the plaintiff, and (3) the
value of any security interest held by the plaintiff in the defendant’s
property, together with the amount by which the acts of the plaintiff (or a
prior holder of the security interest) have decreased that security interest’s
value.  CCP §483.015(b).  A defendant claiming that the amount to be
secured should be reduced because of a cross-claim or affirmative defense must
make a prima facie showing that the claim would result in an attachment
against the plaintiff.
            Before
the issuance of a writ of attachment, the plaintiff is required to file an
undertaking to pay the defendant any amount the defendant may recover for any
wrongful attachment by the plaintiff in the action.  CCP §489.210. 
The undertaking ordinarily is $10,000. CCP §489.220.  If the defendant objects, the court may
increase the amount of undertaking to the amount determined as the probable
recovery for wrongful attachment.  CCP
§489.220.  The court also has inherent
authority to increase the amount of the undertaking sua sponte.  North Hollywood Marble Co. v. Superior
Court, (1984) 157 Cal.App.3d 683, 691.
 
C. Statement of Facts
Monrovia is the
owner and landlord of the Property.  Fox
Decl., ¶3.  On or about December 20,
2019, Monrovia and Khoury signed the Lease Agreement.  Fox Decl., ¶1, Ex. 1.  The Lease Agreement was fully negotiated
between Monrovia and Khoury, and the terms agreed to and negotiated were
incorporated into the Lease Agreement. 
Fox Decl., ¶2.
Khoury took
possession of the Property in January 2020 and had possession until at least
July 2023.  Fox Decl., ¶4.  The “use” provided under the Lease Agreement
is a skate shop.  Khoury told Fox that that
this was his usual business, that he would operate a skate shop at the Property,
and that he had in the past and currently operated and managed other skate
shops under the name “Stix,” including locations at 119 E. Lime Avenue,
Monrovia, California 91016, 1011 Mission Street, South Pasadena, California 91030
and 456 West 1st Street, Claremont, California 91711.  Fox Decl., ¶5, Ex. 2.
The rent is due on
the first day of each month under the Lease Agreement.  Fox Decl., ¶8.  Starting January 1, 2020, the rent was $3,294
per month.  Fox Decl., ¶6.  Khoury paid the January 2020 rent along with
the security deposit.  Fox Decl., ¶7.  In addition to the base rent, Khoury was to
pay $841.80 per month for taxes, insurance and common areas maintenance
expenses (“CAM Charges”).  Fox Decl.,
¶9.  All monies due under the Lease
Agreement including the CAM Charges are considered rent.  Fox Decl., ¶10.
The rent was to
increase in accordance with the terms of the Lease Agreement each year until
the end of the Lease Agreement terms. 
Fox Decl., ¶11.  
On April 1, 2020,
Khoury failed to pay the rent due.  Fox
Decl., ¶12.  On April 5 and 20, 2023,
Monrovia served a three-day notice to pay rent or quit for Khoury’s failure to
pay rent of $12,508.65.  Fox Decl., ¶13,
Ex. 3.  Payment was required within three
days of service of the notice.  Fox
Decl., ¶13.  On April 8, 2023, the period
in the notice expired and Khoury failed to comply.  Fox Decl., ¶14.
On April 26, 2023,
Monrovia filed an unlawful detainer complaint against Khoury for recovery of
possession of the Property in LASC Case No. 23AHCV00914 (“UD Action”).  Fox Decl., ¶15.
On May 25, 2023,
Monrovia and Khoury entered into a Moveout Agreement.  Fox Decl., ¶16, Ex. 4.  Despite Khoury’s contention that the Moveout
Agreement prevents Monrovia from suing him for monies due for the balance of
the term of the Lease Agreement, Section 3 and 4 of the Moveout Agreement do
not apply to Monrovia.  Fox Decl., ¶17.  Furthermore, Section 2.7 of the Moveout
Agreement expressly states that Monrovia does not waive its claims for back
rent, future rent through the end of the Lease term, or other damages due under
the Lease Agreement.  Fox Decl., ¶17. 
On July 12, 2023,
Khoury vacated the Property in accordance with the Moveout Agreement.  Fox Decl., ¶18. 
Since at least
August 2023, Monrovia has marketed the Property retained a commercial real
estate agent and listed the Property on commercial websites.  Fox Decl., ¶19.  Monrovia has obtained a new tenant for the
Property with a commencement date of December 1, 2023, and rent to commence
April 1, 2024 (Common Area Expenses are to be paid by the replacement tenant as
of December 1, 2023).  Fox Decl., ¶20,
Ex. 5.
The Lease Agreement
provides for the recovery of the real estate broker commission for the replacement
lease.  Fox Decl., ¶21.  Monrovia owes a real estate broker commission
of $2,141.10 for procuring the replacement tenant, which is at least 4% of the
base rent for the replacement tenant, i.e., $4,117.50 per month times 0.4 times
13 months equaling $164.70 per month. 
Fox Decl., ¶21, Ex. 6.  
The Lease Agreement
provides for recovery of attorney’s fees and costs.  Fox Decl., ¶¶22, 31, Ex. 1.  Monrovia incurred $5,231.75 in attorney’s
fees and costs drafting the lease for the replacement tenant.  Fox Decl., ¶22.  Monrovia seeks to recover 32.50% of this
amount, which is $1,700.31 ($5,231.75 times 32.50%; the lease with the
replacement tenant is 40 months and the overlap is 13 months from December 1, 2023
through December 1, 2024).  Fox Decl.,
¶22.  
As a result of
Khoury’s breach of the Lease Agreement, $37,449.35 is unpaid from Khoury to
Monrovia, which includes the base rent and Common Area Expenses.  Fox Decl., ¶¶ 24-29.  Monrovia is entitled to recover the balance
of the term of the Lease Agreement pursuant to Civil Code Section 1951.2 and
the provisions of the Lease Agreement. 
Fox Decl., ¶¶ 25-29, Ex. 7. 
Neither Khoury nor any third party has paid any of the $37,449.35 owed
to Monrovia.  Fox Decl., ¶30.
Monrovia’s claim for
money against Khoury is not secured by any real property.  Fox Decl., ¶32.  This application for a right to attach order
is not sought for any purpose other than the recovery of monies owed to
Monrovia.  Fox Decl., ¶32.  Monrovia has no information or belief that
its claims against Khoury are discharged or that the prosecution of Khoury is
stayed in any Bankruptcy proceeding under Title 11 of the United States
Bankruptcy Code.  Fox Decl., ¶32.
The Lease Agreement
entitles Monrovia to recover all costs and expenses of enforcement, including
attorney fees.  Fox Decl., ¶31.   Monrovia has incurred $19,107 in attorney
fees to date.  Rosenbaum Decl., ¶¶ 12-14,
17, Ex. 8.  Monrovia’s counsel expects
that Monrovia will incur at least another $50,000 in fees, a total of $64,650.  Rosenbaum Decl., ¶¶ 15, 17.  Monrovia’s counsel anticipates costs of at
least $10,000, including at least two depositions.  Rosenbaum Decl., ¶16.
 
D. Analysis
Plaintiff Monrovia applies
for a right to attach order against Defendant Khoury in the amount of
$97,449.35, which includes estimated attorney fees of $50,000 and estimated
costs of $10,000. 
 
1. A Claim Based
on a Contract and on Which Attachment May Be Based
            A
writ of attachment may be issued only in an action on a claim or claims for
money, each of which is based upon a contract, express or implied, where the
total amount of the claim or claims is a fixed or readily ascertainable amount
not less than five hundred dollars ($500). 
CCP §483.010(a).  
            Monrovia’s
claim is based on the Lease Agreement. 
It has a claim on which to base
attachment.
 
            2. An Amount Due That is Fixed
and Readily Ascertainable 
            A
claim is “readily ascertainable” where the damages may be readily ascertained
by reference to the contract and the basis of the calculation appears to be
reasonable and definite.  CIT
Group/Equipment Financing, Inc. v. Super DVD, Inc., (2004) 115 Cal.App.4th
537, 540-41.  The fact that the damages
are unliquidated is not determinative.  Id.  But the contract must furnish a standard by
which the amount may be ascertained and there must be a basis by which the
damages can be determined by proof.  Id.
(citations omitted).
            Monrovia
seeks unpaid base rent and Common Area expenses as well as the balance of the
term of the Lease pursuant to Civil Code section 1951.2.  Monrovia 
has calculated the unpaid base rent and CAM Charges from April 1, 2020
through December 1, 2024, charge for real estate commission and attorney fees
for a replacement lease, and a credit for security deposit, yielding a total
owed rent of $37,449.35.  Fox Decl., Ex.
7.
Monrovia also estimates its attorney fees and costs in this
lawsuit at $64,650 and $10,000,
respectively.  Rosenbaum Decl., ¶¶ 15,
17.  Monrovia only includes an estimated
$50,000 in attorney fees in this application.
The estimated total
rent of $37,449.35 and estimated $50,000 in attorney fees and estimated $10,000
in costs total $97,449.35.  This amount
is readily ascertainable from the Lease Agreement. 
 
            3. Probability of Success
            A
claim has “probable validity” where it is more likely than not that the
plaintiff will recover on that claim. 
CCP §481.190.  In determining this
issue, the court must consider the relative merits of the positions of the
respective parties.  Kemp Bros.
Construction, Inc. v. Titan Electric Corp., (2007) 146 Cal.App.4th 1474,
1484.  The court does not determine
whether the claim is actually valid; that determination will be made at trial
and is not affected by the decision on the application for the order.  CCP §484.050(b).
Monrovia provides
evidence that it is the owner and landlord of the Property.  Fox Decl., ¶3.  On or about December 20, 2019, Monrovia and
Khoury signed the Lease Agreement.  Fox
Decl., ¶1, Ex. 1.  Khoury took possession
of the Property in January 2020 and had possession until at least July
2023.  Fox Decl., ¶4.  
The rent was due on
the first day of each month under the Lease Agreement.  Fox Decl., ¶8.  Starting January 1, 2020, the rent was $3,294
per month.  Fox Decl., ¶6.  Khoury paid the January 2020 rent along with
the security deposit.  Fox Decl.,
¶7.  In addition to the base rent, Khoury
was to pay $841.80 per month for CAM Charges. 
Fox Decl., ¶9.  All monies due
under the Lease Agreement including the CAM Charges are considered rent.  Fox Decl., ¶10.  The rent was to increase in accordance with
the terms of the Lease Agreement each year until the end of the Lease Agreement
terms.  Fox Decl., ¶11.  
On April 1, 2020,
Khoury failed to pay the rent due.  Fox
Decl., ¶12.  As a result of Khoury’s
breach of the Lease Agreement, $37,449.35 is unpaid.  Fox Decl., ¶¶ 24-29.  
Khoury opposes on
three grounds.  First, he argues that he
signed the Lease Agreement, which is only the most recent lease between the
parties, because it in part entitled him to modify the premises and operate a
tattoo parlor.  Yet, Monrovia’s
principal, Ted Fox, unreasonably withheld approval for the operation of a
tattoo parlor, resulting in lost income. 
Opp. at 2-3.  As Monrovia replies,
Khoury provides no evidence supporting this argument.  Reply at 2.
Second, Khoury
argues that attachment will cause him irreversible harm.  Opp. at 3. 
That also is unsupported, but it is irrelevant.  A seizure of assets through attachment can
harm a defendant, but that does not make it unlawful.
Third, Khoury
contends that the Moveout Agreement, which included a partial payment of unpaid
rent, provides that the Lease Agreement is terminated and forfeited.  As such, Monrovia waived any right to additional
rent, back or future.  Opp. at 3-4.  
This argument is not
fleshed out or supported by case law. 
Khoury argues that the Moveout Agreement’s termination of the Lease
Agreement waived Monrovia’s right to collect damages.  Monrovia relies on the fact, however, that
the Moveout Agreement expressly provides that Monrovia is not waiving any claim
for back rent, future rent, or other damages. 
App. at 14; Reply at 4 (citing Ex. 1, §2.7).  For this purpose, the Moveout Agreement
released claims against Monrovia but not claims against Khoury. Ex. 1, §3.  At this stage, Monrovia has shown a
probability of success that it may continue to collect unpaid past and future
rent.
            
4. Attachment Based on Commercial Claim
            If
the action is against a defendant who is a natural person, an attachment may be
issued only on a commercial claim which arises out of the defendant’s conduct
of a trade, business, or profession.  CCP
§483.010(c).  Consumer transactions
cannot form a basis for attachment.   CCP
§483.010(c); Kadison, Pfaelzer, Woodard, Quinn & Rossi v. Wilson, (“Kadison”)
(1987) 197 Cal.App.3d 1, 4 (action involving trust property was a commercial,
not a consumer, transaction).
The “use” provided
under the Lease Agreement is a skate shop.  Khoury told Fox that that this was his usual
business, that he would operate a skate shop at the Property, and that he had
in the past and currently operated and managed other skate shops under the name
“Stix”.  Fox Decl., ¶5, Ex. 2.  Monrovia’s action against Khoury arises
out of his conduct of a business.  
 
            5.
Attachment Sought for a Proper Purpose 
            Attachment
must not be sought for a purpose other than the recovery on the claim upon
which attachment is based.  CCP §484.090(a)(3).  Monrovia seeks
attachment for a proper purpose.
 
            6.
Description of Property to be Attached
            Where
the defendant is a natural person, the description of the property must be
reasonably adequate to permit the defendant to identify the specific property
sought to be attached.  CCP §484.020(e).  Although the property must be specifically
described, the plaintiff may target for attachment everything the individual
defendant owns.  Bank of America v.
Salinas Nissan, Inc., (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 260, 268. The requirement of
specificity avoids unnecessary hearings where an individual defendant is
willing to concede that the described property is subject to attachment.  Ibid. 
A general list of categories - e.g., “real property, personal
property, equipment, motor vehicles, chattel paper, negotiable and other
instruments, securities, deposit accounts, safe-deposit boxes, accounts
receivable, general intangibles, property subject to pending actions, final
money judgments, and personal property in decedents’ estates” – is
sufficient.  Ibid. 
            Monrovia
seeks to attach interests in real property except leasehold estates with
unexpired terms of less than one year; accounts receivable; chattel paper;
equipment; farm products; inventory; general intangibles and final money
judgments arising out of the conduct by the defendant of a trade, business, or
profession; money on the premises where a trade, business, or profession is
conducted and elsewhere; deposit accounts; negotiable documents of title;
instruments; securities; minerals or the like to be extracted; and any
community property that would be subject to enforcement of judgment obtained in
this case.  The description of attachable
property is adequate.
 
            E. Conclusion
            The
application for a right to attach order against Defendant Khoury is granted the
amount of $97,449.35.  Monrovia has not
submitted a proposed right to attach order and must do so in two court days or
it will be waived.  No writ shall
issue until Monrovia posts a $10,000 undertaking.
