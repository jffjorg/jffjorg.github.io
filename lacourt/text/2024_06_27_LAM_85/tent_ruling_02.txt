Richter filed both a ten-page opposition and an 18-page memorandum of points
and authorities.  Collectively, they
grossly exceed the 15-page limit of CRC 3.1113(d).  Respondents point out that the court
previously warned Richter about exceeding the page limits of 3.1113(d) and that
they would be strictly enforced for this demurrer.  The court has exercised its discretion to
read and consider only the ten-page opposition, which appears to more directly
address Respondents’ position than the other document.


[2]
Respondents’ request for judicial notice of the ODA (Ex. 1) is granted.  Evid. Code §452(c).


[3] Richter
argues that the demurrer is untimely. 
Opp. at 1.  Not so.  The SAP was deemed filed on May 9, 2024 and
the demurrer was filed and served on May 22, 2024, within the 30 day deadline
of CCP section 430.40(a).


[4]
Respondents also argue that individual Respondents have quasi-judicial
immunity.  Dem. at 7-8.  Richter suggests that this immunity is
qualified, at least for hearing officer bias, but it is absolute.  Falls v. Superior Court, (1996) 42
Cal.4th 1031, 1037.  The
demurrer is sustained for the individual Respondents sued in their personal
capacity.
