And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a minor's compromise case involving a motor vehicle versus pedestrians accident. The case involves two minors, Gael Sebastian Tobar and Luna Celeste Tobar, who were injured in the accident on April 6, 2022. The defendant, Gary W. Klein, has agreed to pay $32,500.00 and $100,000.00 to the minors respectively in settlement of their claims.

However, the judge has identified several defects in the petition and proposed orders, including inconsistencies in the settlement amounts, lack of medical records, and unclear attorney fees and costs. The judge has ordered the petitioner to file an amended petition and proposed orders correcting these defects.

The hearing will be continued, and the judge has advised counsel to use separate reservation numbers for each petition in the future.
