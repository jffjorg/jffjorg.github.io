Case #24CHCV00858
 
MINOR’S
COMPROMISE
 
Petition filed on 9/24/24.
 
MINOR: Gael Sebastian Tobar
GAL: Reynaldo I. Tobar (parent)
DEFENDANT: Gary W. Klein
 
SUMMARY OF ACTION: This action arises out of motor
vehicle versus pedestrians accident.  On
4/6/22, plaintiffs, including minor, were walking through an intersection on a
green light when they were hit by a vehicle driven by Defendant Gary W. Klein.
 
Minor, who was just under 1 year old at the time of the
incident, suffered mood changes, restlessness and trouble sleeping.  Minor was treated at Kaiser.  Minor has completely recovered from her
injuries.
 
AMOUNT OF SETTLEMENT: Defendant Klein to pay $32,500.00  
 
MEDICAL EXPENSES: $0
 
ATTORNEY FEES: $8,125.00
 
COSTS: $775.00
 
AMOUNT TO BE PAID TO MINOR: $23,600.00 to be
deposited into an insured account subject to withdrawal only on authorization
of the court.
 
RULING: The hearing will be continued.
 
The petition suffers from the following defects: 
 
(1) No.11.b.(1) indicates that the total amount offered
to others in settlement is $32,500.00. 
However, No.11.b.(5) indicates that the total is $200,000.00.
 
(2) No.13.b. in the petition indicates costs in the total
amount of $775.00 for various items without breaking down the cost for each
item.  This is the same amount claimed in
the petition on behalf of Luna Celeste Tobar. 
As such, it is not clear if the attorney is seeking double recovery for
the same costs or whether they are apportioned among the minors and the adult
plaintiff/their father/GAL.  
 
(3) Although the petition says the minor was treated at
Kaiser Permanente, no medical records are attached to the petition.  (See Petition, Nos.7 and 8, No
Attachment 8)
 
(4) The attorney-client retainer agreement does not
indicate that it was signed on behalf of the minor.  (See Attachment 17a, pdf 22).
 
(5) The proposed Order Approving Compromise incorrectly
indicates that the attorney fees to be awarded from the minor’s settlement are
$25,000.00 and there is to be reimbursement of $435.00 in expenses to minor’s
attorney.  (See proposed Order,
No.8.a.(1) and (2))
 
(6) No.5.b. in the Order to Deposit Funds in Blocked
Account is not marked.
 
 
The hearing will be continued.  Petitioner is ordered to file an amended
petition and amended proposed orders correcting the above-noted defects.
 
The Court notes that counsel has improperly used the same
reservation number for two petitions.  Counsel
is advised that in the future separate reservations are required for each
petition.Dept. F47
