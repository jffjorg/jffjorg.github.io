And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Defendant Gustavo Medina's motion to deem admitted the truth of all matters specified in his Requests for Admissions, served on Plaintiff Zulma Suraya Ovando Ramos. The motion was filed on July 17, 2024, and Ramos failed to respond to the requests. The judge notes that there is an issue with service of the motion on Plaintiff Palacios' counsel, but since Palacios has dismissed her complaint with prejudice, the issue is moot.

The judge has also granted Defendant's motions to compel discovery responses, seeking an order compelling Ramos to provide responses, without objections, to Defendant's Demand for Production of Documents, Set 1, and Form Interrogatories, Set 1. The motions were filed on July 17, 2024, and July 24, 2024, respectively, and Ramos has failed to respond. The judge notes that Ramos' failure to respond to the demands and interrogatories entitles Defendant to orders compelling Ramos to provide responses without objections.

The judge has ordered Ramos to provide responses to Defendant's Demands for Production of Documents, Set 1, and Form Interrogatories, Set 1, within 30 days.
