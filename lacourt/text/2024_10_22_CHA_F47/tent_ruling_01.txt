Case #23CHCV00887
 
MOTION TO DEEM
REQUESTS FOR ADMISSIONS ADMITTED
 
Motion filed on 7/17/24.  Notice of Change of Hearing Date filed on
8/7/24.
 
MOVING PARTY: Defendant Gustavo Medina
RESPONDING PARTY: Plaintiff Zulma Suraya Ovando Ramos
 
RELIEF REQUESTED: An order deeming
admitted the truth of all matters specified in Defendant Gustavo Medina’s
Requests for Admissions, Set 1, served on Plaintiff Zulma Suraya Ovando
Ramos.  

 
RULING: The motion is granted.
 
SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This is a personal injury action which arises out of a
motor vehicle accident that occurred on 5/24/21 in Pacoima, California.  On 3/28/23, Plaintiffs Zulma Suraya Ovando
Ramos (Ramos) and Olivia Capristo Palacios (Palacios), represented by counsel,
filed this action against Defendant Gustavo Medina (Defendant).  Defendant contends that the accident was caused
by Ramos.
 
On 1/8/24, Ramos’ counsel’s motion to be relieved as
counsel was granted leaving Ramos representing herself in this action.  The same law firm still represents Palacios (the
other plaintiff) in this action.  On
1/22/24, Defendant served Ramos, by mail, with Requests for Admissions, Set 1,
making responses due on or before 2/26/24. 
(Glazer Decl. ¶¶3, 5, Ex.A). 
Since no responses were received, on 3/11/24, Defendant sent Ramos a
meet and confer letter regarding the overdue responses and requesting responses
without objection by 3/21/24.  (Id.
¶¶3, 6, Ex.B).  No responses were served.  (Glazer Decl. ¶7).
 
Therefore, on 7/17/24, Defendant filed and served the
instant motion seeking an order deeming admitted the truth of all matters
specified in Defendant’s Requests for Admissions, Set 1, served on Ramos.  The motion was originally scheduled for
hearing on 4/4/25 but was rescheduled to be heard on 10/14/24.  On 8/7/24, Defendant filed and served a notice
of the rescheduled hearing date.  The
proofs of service attached to the motion, notice of changed hearing date and
notice of  no opposition filed by
Defendant on 10/4/24 were properly served on Ramos by mail at her address of
record.  However, the same documents were
not served on the correct email address of record for Palacios’ counsel.  
 
On 6/6/24, Palacios’ counsel filed and served a Notice of
Change of Handling Attorney indicating that effective immediately the new
handling attorney was Daniel V. Infuso and all further correspondence,
pleadings, discovery and inquiries should be made to the attention of the new
handling attorney and electronic service should be made on both of the
following email addresses: dinfuso@valerolawgroup.com
and mvenegas@valerolawgroup.com.  Despite the foregoing, the motion related
documents were served on Palacios’ counsel by email at esapir@valerolawgroup.com.  
 
Neither Ramos nor Palacious opposed or otherwise
responded to the motion.  
 
ANALYSIS 

 
Due to Ramos’ failure to serve responses to the subject
Requests for Admissions, Defendant is entitled to an order deeming the matters
admitted.  CCP 2033.280.  However, as noted above, there is an issue
with service of the motion on Ramos’ co-plaintiff’s counsel.
 
Due to the service issue as to Palacios and the fact that
Palacios’ attorney did not appear at the 10/14/24 hearing, the matter was
continued to 10/22/24 to determine whether Palacios had any opposition to the
motion.  (See 10/14/24 Minute
Order).  
 
On 10/16/24, Palacious dismissed her complaint with
prejudice rendering any notice issues as to her moot.  
 
CONCLUSION
 
The motion is granted.
