Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel initial and further discovery responses. The plaintiffs, Fabrizio and Natalia Blanco, have moved to compel the defendant, HM DG Inc., to provide initial discovery responses within 10 days, without objections, to three sets of discovery requests. The defendant has failed to serve timely responses to the requests.

The court has denied the motions to compel initial and further responses to the first set of requests for production of documents (RPDs) and the motion to compel further responses to the special interrogatories (SROGs). However, the court has granted the motion to compel initial responses to the form interrogatories (FROGs) and has imposed sanctions of $1,500.00 against the defendant and its counsel.

The court has ordered the defendant to provide responses within 10 days, and the sanctions are payable to the plaintiff's counsel within 30 days. The court has also denied the plaintiff's request for sanctions of $1,300.00 per motion.
