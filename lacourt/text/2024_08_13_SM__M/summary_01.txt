Case Number: 24SMCV00099
Hearing Date: 2024-08-13
Department: M
Case Name: Fanfixapp LLC v. Passes Inc., et al.
Plaintiff: Fanfixapp LLC
Defendant: Passes Inc.
Motion: Demurrer and Motion to Strike
Legal Standard:
  - A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters.
  - A "demurrer does not, however, admit contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law alleged in the pleading, or the construction of instruments pleaded, or facts impossible in law."

  - The seventh cause of action under Penal Code section 502 is well-stated and would survive a challenge on demurrer.
  - The first, third, and sixth causes of action are displaced by CUTSA.
