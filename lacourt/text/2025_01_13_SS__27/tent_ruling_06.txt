[TENTATIVE] ORDER RE MOTION FOR
  GOOD FAITH SETTLEMENT

Legal
Standard 
In
a case involving two or more alleged joint tortfeasors, a party may seek a
court order under Code of Civil Procedure section 877.6 determining that a settlement
between the plaintiff and one or more of the alleged tortfeasors is in good
faith. A judicial determination of good faith “bar[s] any other joint
tortfeasor … from any further claims against the settling tortfeasor … for
equitable comparative contribution, or partial or comparative indemnity, based
on comparative negligence or comparative fault.” (Code Civ. Proc. §
877.6(c).) 
In
evaluating whether a settlement has been made in good faith, courts consider
the following factors, as set forth by the California Supreme Court in the
landmark case Tech-Bilt, Inc. v. Woodward-Clyde & Associates (1985)
38 Cal.3d 488:  
    
   1) “a rough approximation of
plaintiffs’ total recovery”; 
    
   2) “the settlor’s proportionate
liability”; 
3)
“the amount paid in settlement”; 
         4) “the allocation of the settlement
proceeds among plaintiffs”; 
5) “a recognition that a settlor
should pay less in settlement than he would if he were found liable after a
trial”; 
    
   6) the settling party's “financial
conditions and insurance policy limits”; 
7)
any evidence of “collusion, fraud, or tortious conduct aimed to injure the
interests of nonsettling defendants.” (Id. at 499.)
 “Practical considerations obviously require
that the evaluation be made on the basis of information available at the time
of settlement.” (Ibid.) 
The
“good faith” concept in Code of Civil Procedure section 877.6 is a flexible
principle imposing on reviewing courts the obligation to guard against the
numerous ways in which the interests of nonsettling defendants may be unfairly
prejudiced. (Rankin v. Curtis (1986) 183 Cal. App. 3d 939, 945.)
Accordingly, under Tech-Bilt, the party asserting the lack of “good
faith” may meet this burden by demonstrating that the settlement is so far
"out of the ballpark" as to be inconsistent with the equitable
objectives of the statute. (Tech-Bilt, supra, 38 Cal.3d at 499-500.)
Such a demonstration would establish that the proposed settlement was not a
“settlement made in good faith” within the terms of section 877.6. (Ibid.)  
The
Supreme Court explained that Code of Civil Procedure section 877.6 is designed
to further two equitable policies:  
1)
encouragement of settlements; and  
2)
equitable allocation of costs among joint tortfeasors.   (Ibid.)   
Those
policies would not be served by an approach which emphasizes one to the virtual
exclusion of the other. (Ibid.) Accordingly, a settlement will not be
found in good faith unless the amount is reasonable in light of the settling
tortfeasor's proportionate share of liability. (Std. Pac. of San Diego v. A.
A. Baxter Corp. (1986) 176 Cal. App. 3d 577, 589.) Or, as the California
Supreme Court has stated, a “defendant’s settlement figure must not be grossly
disproportionate to what a reasonable person, at the time of the settlement,
would estimate the settling defendant’s liability to be.” (Tech-Bilt, supra,
38 Cal.3d at 499.) 
When
a motion seeking a determination under Code of Civil Procedure section 877.6 is
not opposed, the burden on the moving parties to show that the settlement was
made in good faith is slight. (City of Grand Terrace v. Superior Court
(1987) 192 Cal.App.3d 1251, 1261 [holding that a “barebones motion” including a
declaration setting forth “a brief background of the case is
sufficient”].)  
When
a good faith motion is contested, however, the moving parties have the initial
burden of producing evidence in support of the requested good faith
determination. (Id. at pp. 1261-1262.) “Section 877.6 and Tech-Bilt
require an evidentiary showing, through expert declarations or other means,
that the proposed settlement is within the reasonable range permitted by the
criterion of good faith.” (Mattco Forge v. Arthur Young & Co. (1995)
38 Cal.App.4th 1337, 1351.) “Substantial evidence” is required. (Id. at
p. 1352.) A declaration from a settling defendant’s attorney that states, in
conclusory fashion, that the client has little, or no share of the liability
may not be sufficient. (Greshko v. County of Los Angeles (1987) 194
Cal.App.3d 822, 834-35; see also 3 Weil & Brown, California Practice Guide:
Civil Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter Group 2023) ¶¶ 12:774,
12:872-873.)   
The
ultimate burden of persuasion is on the party opposing the good faith
determination.  The “party asserting a lack of good faith shall have the
burden of proof on that issue.”  (Code Civ. Proc. § 877.6(d); see also 3
Weil & Brown, supra, at ¶ 12:875.)  
Background
On
May 15, 2023, Plaintiff filed this personal injury case, which involves a
single-car accident occurring at approximately 7:00 PM on May 11, 2022, near
the intersection of Mulholland Drive and Torreyson Drive. At that time,
Plaintiff was traveling northbound on Torreyson Drive, which intersects with
Mulholland Drive. Plaintiff drove straight northbound across Mulholland Drive
and went down the hill, sustaining serious injuries that rendered her
paraplegic.
Defendants
Daniel Sussman and Maria Sussman (hereinafter "the Sussmans") are the
owners and residents of 7744 Torreyson Drive, Los Angeles, California 90046, a
property adjacent to Mulholland Drive and near the ridge over which Plaintiff’s
vehicle careened.  Plaintiff contends
that the Sussmans allowed extensive vegetation on their property to obscure a
stop sign at the intersection of Torreyson Drive and Mulholland Drive.
Plaintiff further alleges that, because the relevant stop sign was obscured by
overgrown vegetation on the Sussmans' property, she was unable to see the stop
sign, failed to stop, and careened over the ridge, resulting in her severe
injuries.
Following
the exchange of written discovery, on August 29, 2024, the Sussmans and
Plaintiff entered into a settlement agreement for the Sussmans’ insurance
policy limit of $2.5 million. On November 14, 2024, the Sussmans filed an
application for a determination of good faith settlement, stating that a
settlement of $2.5 million had been entered into by the settling parties for
the Sussmans’ insurance policy limit. The alleged damages amount to
approximately $36 million to $39 million, consisting of:
1.  
Past Medical Specials: $1,633,053.00
2.  
Future Medical Care and Services
(pursuant to a life-care plan created by Dr. Sharon Kawai): $12,436,661.00
3.  
General Damages for Past and Future Pain
and Suffering: $20,000,000.00
4.  
Loss of Future Earnings: Between
$2,213,049.00 and $4,934,758.00
The Sussmans presented
evidence regarding both the City’s and Plaintiff’s liability, thereby arguing
that despite the high amount of alleged damages, the settlement was made in
good faith because the City and Plaintiff bore the majority share of the
responsibility for damages to Plaintiff. 
Discussion
The
City filed an opposition. The City does not contend that the settlement
resulted from collusion, fraud, or any type of misconduct but makes the sole
argument that the settlement amount is disproportionate to Defendant Sussman’s
liability and Plaintiff’s total recovery. Specifically, the City argues that “the
settlement amount of $2.5 million is roughly 6% of plaintiff’s claimed damages.
While it is true that for a settlement to be one in “good faith” it need not
exactly arithmetically track the potential exposure of the settling defendant,
it must not be grossly disproportionate. The City contends that: (1) 6% of a
potential jury award is “out of the ballpark”; (2) the Sussmans were in the
best position to remedy the obstructed sign and their liability would be
primary; and (3) it would be inequitable to cut off the City’s potential
indemnity rights in this matter by a finding the subject settlement was in
‘good faith’”.
The
Court disagrees for various reasons. First, evidence at the time of the
settlement shows that Plaintiff potentially bore portions of the
responsibility. Photographs of the scene of the incident show that although the
stop sign is obscured by the foliage, a portion of the stop sign is still
visible, the horizontal white line adjacent to the stop sign was noticeable,
and the presence of the ridge Plaintiff careened over was clearly visible from
the intersection of Mulholland and Torreyson. (Application at pp.
294-344.)  An argument can be made that a
reasonably prudent driver would have noticed that a stop was required at the
relevant intersection to avoid careening over the ridge, regardless of the
presence of overgrown vegetation on the Subject Property. 
Second,
photographs also support Plaintiff’s allegation that there were (1) no barriers
at the northern edge of the intersection; (2) no signs warning motorists that
the roadway ended; and (3) insufficient markings and shadowing on the roadway indicating
that the roadway ended. The City potentially failed to ensure the safety of its
roadways, including the placement of proper signage, barriers, and markings to
prevent accidents. Furthermore, although the Sussmans potentially bore
responsibility to trim their bushes so the tree would not overgrow and obscure
the stop sign, ultimately, the maintenance of the stop sign is the City’s
responsibility. 
Third,
although Plaintiff alleges total damages of $36 million, Plaintiff acknowledges
that it is unlikely a jury will award this sum. Plaintiff concedes that she
faces a sizable risk of loss and comparative liability. Plaintiff’s rough
approximation of her recovery is $5 million. In Horton
v. Superior Court (1987) 194 Cal.App.3d 727, the court
stated: "In determining a settling defendant's equitable proportionate
share of liability, the judge does not look to the plaintiff's claim for
damages; rather the judge tries to determine a 'rough approximation' of what
the plaintiff would actually recover if the case should go to trial. Although
the sums paid may be grossly disproportionate to the sums prayed for in the
complaint, they are not out of proportion to what the trial court might have
considered the probable recovery of plaintiffs should they prove their
case." (Kohn v. Superior Court
(1983) 142 Cal.App.3d 323, 328.) The total alleged damages of $36 million are
not controlling, as the judge does not consider that figure in determining
rough approximation of total recovery. 
Fourth,
$2.5 million represents Defendant’s insurance policy limit. In cases involving
insurance limits, courts have found settlements to be in good faith even with
significantly lower settlement-to-value ratios than in the present case. (See,
e.g., Bay Development, Ltd. v. Superior Court
(1990) 50 Cal.3d 1012, 1028 [finding a $30,000 settlement reasonable in
litigation involving a claim for $1 million in damages]; Cahill
v. San Diego Gas & Electric Co. (2011) 194 Cal.App.4th
939, 969-970 [$25,000 settlement on a $40 million estimated value]; Horton
v. Superior Court (1987) 194 Cal.App.3d 727 [value of the
case was estimated at $320,000; the judge determined the case was worth less
than $150,000, and a $50,000 settlement was not “out of the ballpark”]; Kohn
v. Superior Court (1983) 142 Cal.App.3d 323 [the Court
found that a settlement of $6,000 from each joint tortfeasor was in good faith,
even though plaintiffs sought $500,000 in general damages from all
defendants].)
Considering
all factors, the Court finds the rough approximation of recovery to be much
lower than the alleged $36 million and determines Plaintiff’s own evaluation of
$5 million to be more reasonable. Furthermore, based on the evidence presented,
the Court finds a significant possibility that Plaintiff and the City bear a
large portion of the liability. Also, $2.5 million represents Defendant’s
insurance policy limit. Accordingly, the settlement amount is well within the
ballpark. Thus, the Court finds the settlement was made in good faith.
