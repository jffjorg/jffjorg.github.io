Legal
Standard
Contempt
is any act, in or out of court, “which tends to impede, embarrass or obstruct
the court in the discharge of its duties.”¿
(In re Shortridge (1893) 99 Cal. 526, 532.) Civil Contempt procedures
are set forth in Code of Civ. Proc. §§1209 through 1222. Section 1209 provides
that certain acts or omissions are contempts of the authority of the court.
Specifically, subsection (a)(5) states that any “disobedience of any lawful
judgment, order, or process of the court.” Under these rules, a proceeding for
adjudication of constructive contempt is customarily initiated by the issuance
of an Order to Show Cause. (In re Rose (1949) 90 Cal. App. 2d 299, 304.)
The proceeding is also initiated by the filing of an affidavit or declaration,
stating the facts constituting the alleged contempt, in order to confer
jurisdiction upon the court to exercise its contempt powers over the accused. (In
re Liu (1969) 273 Cal. App. 2d 135, 140-41.)  Since a contempt
proceeding is quasi-criminal in nature, the accused person is entitled to due
process, or the procedural safeguards available to a person accused of a
criminal charge, including the right to know the exact nature of the charge
against him/her so that he/she can prepare and present his/her defense. (Id.,
at 141.) The accused must be shown, beyond a reasonable doubt, that he/she had
the ability to comply with the subject court order; the burden of proof on this
issue lies with the party seeking to have the accused held in contempt. (Id.,
at 141-42.) 
Discussion
On
July 15, 2021, Plaintiff filed this motor vehicle accident case. On July 11,
2024, Defendant filed and served Motions to Compel Plaintiff's Responses to
Form Interrogatories and Requests for Production of Documents, Set Three. On
August 13, 2024, the Court heard the motions and ordered Plaintiff to provide
responses to the discovery at issue and pay monetary sanctions in the amount of
$2,000 by September 12, 2024.
Although
Plaintiff timely served her discovery responses, both she and her counsel have
failed to pay the court-ordered sanctions. On September 24, 2024, Defendant
sent correspondence to Plaintiff requesting payment of the court-ordered
sanctions, to which Plaintiff never responded.
As
a result, on October 22, 2024, Defendant filed and served a Motion regarding
the unpaid sanctions. On November 18, 2024, the parties reached a settlement
agreement, which was communicated to the Court, resulting in all pending
hearing dates being vacated. As part of this agreement, Defendant agreed to
waive the unpaid sanctions. However, Plaintiff subsequently retracted from the
settlement agreement and filed an ex parte petition to reinstate the trial
date, which the Court granted. Consequently, the previously ordered sanctions
remain due and payable to Defendant. As of the filing of this Motion on
December 10, 2024, Defendant has not received the court-ordered sanctions and
moves the Court for contempt proceedings. No opposition has been filed.
CCP
Section 1209(a)(5) provides that disobedience of any lawful judgment, order, or
process of the Court constitutes contempt of the Court's authority. On August
13, 2024, the Court issued a lawful order requiring Plaintiff to pay monetary
sanctions to Defendant by September 12, 2024. Plaintiff has failed to comply
with the Court's order and has not paid the ordered sanctions to Defendant as
of this date. Therefore, Defendant’s request for issuance of an Order to Show
Cause regarding contempt is GRANTED. (In re Rose
(1949) 90 Cal.App.2d 299, 304.) The Court hereby sets an Order to Show Cause Re: Contempt
for ______.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at
SSCDEPT27@lacourt.org indicating intention
to submit on the tentative as directed by
the instructions provided on the court’s website at www.lacourt.org.  Please be advised that if you submit on the
tentative and elect not to appear at the hearing, the opposing party may
nevertheless appear at the hearing and argue the matter.  Unless you receive a submission from all
other parties in the matter, you should assume that others might appear at the
hearing to argue.  If the Court does not
receive emails from the parties indicating submission on this tentative ruling
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the Court may, at its discretion,
adopt the tentative as the final order or place the motion off calendar.
