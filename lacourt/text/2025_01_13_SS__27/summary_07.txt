Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the plaintiff, Rodney Antonio Howard, granting his motion to compel the defendant, Denali Water Solutions, LLC, to provide verified responses to discovery requests. The defendant failed to serve verified responses to the discovery requests, and the plaintiff granted the defendant an extension to serve the responses. The defendant served the responses on November 8, 2024, but they were unverified. The judge found that the defendant waived all objections to the discovery requests and that the unverified responses are tantamount to no response at all. As a result, the judge granted the plaintiff's motion to compel the defendant to provide verified responses to the discovery requests. The judge also ordered the defendant to pay $2,000 in sanctions to the plaintiff for its failure to comply with the discovery requests.
