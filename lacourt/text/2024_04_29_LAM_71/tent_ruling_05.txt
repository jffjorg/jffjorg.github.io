JOEL WERTMAN,  
  
         vs.
 
HOWARD FUCHS, et al.


 Case No.: 
  23STCV08191
 
 
 
 Hearing
  Date:  April 29, 2024



 
Defendant Joseph Altman’s unopposed
demurrer to Plaintiff Joel Wertman’s first amended complaint
is overruled as moot.
 
Defendant Joseph Altman (“Altman”) (“Defendant”) demurs unopposed
to Plaintiff Joel
Wertman’s (“Wertman”) (“Plaintiff”) first amended complaint (“FAC”) on the
grounds this Court lacks jurisdiction over Altman, Plaintiff’s causes of action
against Altman are procedurally improper pursuant to Civil Code §1714.10, the
claims asserted are barred by the doctrine of preclusion, the claims are barred
by the statute of limitations, and the FAC is uncertain and fails to state
facts sufficient to state a cause of action against Altman. (Notice of Demurrer, pgs. 1-2; C.C.P. §430.10(e); CRC, Rule 3.1320.)
 
Background
Plaintiff filed his initial complaint (“Complaint”) on April 13,
2023, against Altman and Non-moving Defendant Howard Fuchs (“Fuchs”).  Plaintiff filed the operative FAC on January
29, 2024, alleging three causes of action: (1) declaratory relief; (2)
declaratory relief; and (3) declaratory relief.
On April 19, 2024, Wertman filed a dismissal of the 1st cause of
action and Altman only.  (4/19/24 Request
for Dismissal.)
           Altman’s demurrer
is overruled as moot based on the fact Wertman dismissed him entirely from this
action on April 19, 2024.
 
Conclusion
Altman’s demurrer to Plaintiff’s FAC is overruled as moot. 
Moving Party to give notice.
