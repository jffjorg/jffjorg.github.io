And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the demurrer filed by Defendant Joseph Altman to the Plaintiff's first amended complaint is overruled as moot. The Plaintiff, Joel Wertman, had filed an initial complaint on April 13, 2023, and an amended complaint on January 29, 2024. The Defendant demurred to the amended complaint on grounds of lack of jurisdiction, procedural impropriety, statute of limitations, and uncertainty of the claims. However, the Plaintiff subsequently filed a request for dismissal of the 1st cause of action on April 19, 2024, which renders the Defendant's demurrer moot.
