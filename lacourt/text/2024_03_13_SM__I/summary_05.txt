And here is the English text summary:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in this case, assigning the matter to a referee to make a recommendation on how to proceed. The court has not read the defendant's response, which was filed yesterday morning. The court believes that the parties will not be able to resolve the matter in good faith and is tired of the constant back-and-forth between them. The referee will have the authority to hear from experts, make a final determination, and recommend sanctions for bad faith. The parties will be required to submit a joint list of six potential referees, along with their CVs and hourly rates. The matter will be continued for approximately three months, at which time the court will appoint the referee and set a new hearing date. The referee may also recommend whether the defendant is entitled to a refund of monies already paid.
