And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to set aside a default judgment against Orange Team. Orange Team was in default since May 2023, but waited almost nine months to move to vacate the default. The judge finds that Orange Team's delay was likely tactical and not due to excusable neglect or a defect in service. However, the judge also notes that there is a strong public policy favoring resolution of cases on their merits. The judge is inclined to grant the motion, but with certain conditions. Orange Team may file its answer, but no cross-action, within two court days. The judge warns Orange Team not to abuse the privilege by serving a raft of discovery at the last second. The judge also conditions the granting of the motion on Orange Team's agreement not to notice the deposition of any party or witness who has already been deposed. The judge will not entertain a request from Orange Team or anyone else to continue the trial or any deadline.
