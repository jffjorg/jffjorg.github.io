And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion by the defendant to set aside a default judgment that was entered against them. The defendant claims that the service of process was not properly made because the process server did not have authority to serve them. The judge has reviewed the evidence presented and is inclined to deny the motion. The judge believes that the process server did leave the papers with the receptionist, even if she was employed by a different company. The judge is concerned that the defendant's delay in responding to the lawsuit is tactical, rather than accidental, and is considering allowing the plaintiff to withdraw their opposition in return for an early trial date.
