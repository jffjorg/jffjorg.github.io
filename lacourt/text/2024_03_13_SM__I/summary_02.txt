And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a landlord-tenant dispute over a cross-complaint for conversion. The former tenant took the HVAC unit when they left the premises, and the landlord claims this is a conversion of property. The tenant argues that the lease clause states that the HVAC unit is a trade fixture belonging to the tenant and cannot be converted. The court agrees that the clause is ambiguous and cannot be determined on a pleading motion alone. The issue is better resolved at summary adjudication or trial. The tenant has 30 days to answer the cross-complaint.
