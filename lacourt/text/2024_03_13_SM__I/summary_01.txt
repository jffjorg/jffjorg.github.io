And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

This is a tentative ruling for a default prove up hearing and an OSC re: Dismissal for failure to appear at the last hearing. The plaintiff seeks a default judgment of $866,776, which includes $48,249.99 in unpaid rent as of January 1, 2020, and $536.11 per day in holdover damages from January 1, 2020, to the date of judgment. The court has questions about the holdover damages, specifically whether RADG is still in the building and whether the plaintiff has any evidence showing that the space could not be re-let. The court also questions the amount of fees sought by the plaintiff. The court will continue the hearing until August 2024 to allow the defense counsel's motion to withdraw to be heard.
