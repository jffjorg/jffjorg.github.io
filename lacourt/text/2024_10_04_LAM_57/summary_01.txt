In the case of 20STCV03322, the Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the Plaintiffs' motion to compel the deposition of the Defendant's Person Most Qualified and four individuals. The Judge agrees with the Defendant's position that the temporal scope of the deposition topics and the topics themselves are too broad. The motion is denied as to the deposition of the Person Most Qualified, citing that the Plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate the need to depose the highest ranking employee of the entity. The motion is also denied as to the deposition of three of the four individuals, as the Plaintiffs' separate motion is deemed moot.
