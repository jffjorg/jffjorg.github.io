  Case Number:  20STCV03322    Hearing Date:   October 4, 2024    Dept:  57 Plaintiffs' motion to compel the deposition of Defendant Los Angeles Community College District's Person Most Qualified is denied.   The Court agrees with the position of the Defendants set forth in their opposition to the motion that the temporal scope of the deposition topics and the topics themselves are too broad.  Plaintiffs' separate motion to compel the depositions of four individuals would appear to be moot as to three of them -- Dones, Mirkhanian and Shewfelt.  The motion is denied as to Limbaugh, the President of Los Angeles Community College District, because Plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate the need to depose in this case the highest ranking employee of the entity.
