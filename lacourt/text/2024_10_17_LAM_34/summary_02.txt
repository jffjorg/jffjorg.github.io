Here is a brief summary of the tentative ruling:

The court grants Plaintiff Rebeka Rodriguez' motion to enforce the settlement agreement and motion to seal the settlement information. The parties agreed on the settlement terms, including the amount of the settlement, and the court finds that the parties entered into a valid and binding settlement. The court also finds that there is an overriding interest to protect the confidential information of the parties, and that the proposed sealing is narrowly tailored and necessary to achieve that interest.
