Soon, counsel for defendant American Southwest Chamber of Commerce USA. The motion is granted, and the hearing is continued to a later date. The Judge notes that the breakdown in the attorney-client relationship does not result in prejudice, and therefore, the motion should be granted. The Judge also requires the proposed order to be revised and filed by a certain deadline. The parties who intend to submit on this tentative ruling must send an email to the Court, and if they do not appear at the hearing, the opposing party may still argue the matter.
