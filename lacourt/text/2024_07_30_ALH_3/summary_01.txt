And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion for summary judgment/adjudication filed by Peng, a cross-defendant, against Tseng's cross-complaint. The dispute centers around the alleged Housing Agreement between Peng and Tseng, which Peng claims was never formed. Peng argues that there is no written evidence of the alleged agreement and that there are no "sufficiently definite terms" to determine the existence of a breach. Tseng, on the other hand, alleges that Peng breached the Housing Agreement by moving out of the residence and failing to pay for services.

The judge has found that there are triable issues of material fact regarding the formation of the alleged Housing Agreement and the alleged services provided by Tseng. The judge has also rejected Peng's arguments that the alleged Housing Agreement is barred by the statute of frauds and that the cross-complaint fails to state a claim.

The case will proceed to the hearing, and the parties are advised to be prepared to argue their positions.
