      CASE NO.: 23AHCV02077
 
[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER RE: MOTION TO BE RELIEVED 
 
Dept.
  3
8:30
  a.m.
July 30,
  2024




 


 


 



 
Michelle
 E. Soon seeks to be relieved as counsel of record for defendant
 American Southwest Chamber of Commerce USA on grounds that there has
 been a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship. Absent a showing
of resulting prejudice, an attorney’s request for withdrawal should be granted.
(People v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398, 406.) 
Counsel’s Motion complies with
California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1362. The Court notes that trial in this
matter is set for November 3, 2025, and no prejudice will result from granting
this motion. However, the proposed order must be separately filed and Items 3b
and 5a must be signed. In addition, Item 6 should reflect that the address
provided is the defendant’s “current” address and must include a telephone
number.
The hearing is therefore continued to
______________ at 8:30 a.m. in Department 3 of the Alhambra Courthouse. The
revised proposed order should be filed no later than 5 court days before the
date of the hearing.        
Moving party to give notice.
 
Dated
this 30th
day of July 2024
