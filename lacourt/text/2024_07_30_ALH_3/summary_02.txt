And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the defendant's motion to tax costs. The plaintiffs filed a lemon law action against the defendant, General Motors LLC, and the case was settled. However, the plaintiffs are requesting certain costs associated with the litigation, and the defendant is disputing the reasonableness and necessity of these costs.

The Court has reviewed the costs and has denied the defendant's motion to tax costs in part. The Court has allowed the plaintiffs to recover costs associated with jury fees, filing fees for discovery motions, service of process costs, photocopies of exhibits and demonstratives, filing fees for notice of change of address, and document download costs.

The Court has also denied the defendant's motion to strike certain costs, including costs associated with obtaining copies of the Court's minute orders and costs associated with preparing trial binders.

The Court has exercised its discretion to allow certain costs as reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation, including costs associated with photocopies of exhibits and demonstratives.

The Court has denied the defendant's motion to tax costs and has ordered the parties to submit their oppositions to the tentative ruling by the date specified.
