On February 23, 2023, Plaintiff Maxwell
+ Bessie, Inc. (Plaintiff) filed the complaint alleging damages arising from breach
of contract against Defendant Michael Onagbesan (Defendant) and Does 1 through 10.
On June 27, 2023, Plaintiff filed the operative first amended complaint.
 
On March 8,
2024, Plaintiff moved to compel initial responses to special interrogatories,
set one, and requests for production, set one, on the grounds that Defendant
failed to respond despite having been served with discovery requests on August
14, 2023. Defendant did not file any opposition, and on April 18, 2024, the
court ordered Defendant to comply with Plaintiff’s discovery requests. 
 
Defendant
continued to fail to respond to Plaintiff’s discovery requests, and on June 17,
2024, Plaintiff filed this motion for evidentiary sanctions. No opposition has
been filed. On August 13, 2024, the court ordered Defendant to meet and confer
with Plaintiff as to any outstanding discovery responses and comply with the
April 18, 2024 court order to provide discovery responses. 
 
Defendant failed
to provide outstanding discovery responses to make any attempt to meet and
confer with Plaintiff. On October 1, 2024, the court ordered monetary sanctions
against Defendant and continued the hearing on the motion for evidentiary
sanctions to October 22, 2024 to allow Defendant one last chance to comply with
the August 13, 2024 order.
 
On October 14,
2024, Counsel for Plaintiff Maxwell + Bessie, Inc. filed a Declaration as to
Status of Discovery.  Therein, Counsel’s
Declaration provides that the parties have engaged in meet and confer process
and have agreed to extend the due date for Defendant’s responses by 14 calendar
days until Tuesday October 29, 2024. (Decl. Reynolds, ¶ 5). Counsel’s Declaration
also provides that the parties are willing to continue the Trial date to a date
in December 2024 to allow for time to further discuss outstanding discovery
issues and engage in potential settlement discussions. (Decl. Reynolds, ¶ 6.)

Defendant to
Comply with Court Discovery Orders Issued 04/18/2024 is
