And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to be relieved as counsel filed by Counsel Charles D. May, Esq., Eduardo Osorio, and Tharpe & Howell on behalf of Defendant Selina G. Salibaba. The motion is opposed by Plaintiff Pamela Sue Clark, who argues that Counsel has not made adequate efforts to contact Defendant and that permitting withdrawal at this late stage of the case would cause undue prejudice to Defendant.

The judge finds that Counsel has demonstrated a reasonable basis for withdrawal, namely the breakdown in the attorney-client relationship, but notes that the case is set for trial on December 19, 2024, and that Counsel has not complied with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362. Therefore, the judge continues the motion to allow Counsel to correct the defects and file supplemental moving papers. The motion is continued to December 10, 2024, at 10:00 a.m. in Department 25 of the Spring Street Courthouse.
