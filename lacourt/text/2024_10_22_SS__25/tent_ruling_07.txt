ANALYSIS:
 
I.                   
Background
 
On March 1, 2024, Petitioner filed the
instant Petition to Declare Mobile Home Abandoned (Petition) against
Respondents Sylvia Vargas aka Ines S. Vargas and Armando Vargas (Respondents).  Pursuant to Civil Code § 798.61, Petitioner
seeks a declaration that the mobilehome located at 3530 Damien Ave., Space 62,
La Verne CA 91750, described as 1965 American, HUD Label RAD1285549, Serial No.
CAFLY08A25068SH12/ CAFLY08B25068SH12 (Mobile Home) is abandoned.  (Pet. ¶¶ 1-2.)  Petitioner also seeks storage charges in the
amount of $26.63 per day owed from September 1, 2023. (Pet. at ¶ 26.)
 
On April 4, 2024, default was entered against Respondents.
No opposition has been filed. 
 
II.                
Legal
Standard & Discussion 
 
A.    Determination of “Abandoned Mobilehome”—Civ. Code § 798.61(a)(1)
 
            Pursuant
to Civil Code § 798.61(a)(1), an “‘abandoned mobilehome’ means a mobilehome
about which all of the following are true:
 
(A) It is located in a mobilehome park
on a site for which no rent has been paid to the management for the preceding
60 days.
 
(B) It is unoccupied.
 
(C) A reasonable person would believe
it to be abandoned.
 
(D) It is not permanently affixed to
the land.”
 
            Petitioner
submits the declaration of Keith Rumbolo, on-site manager for Petitioner.  (Rumbolo Decl., ¶ 1.) Respondent Sylvia
Vargas is the registered owner of the Mobile Home.  (Rumbolo Decl., ¶ 4; Ex. 1.) There are
no legal owners of the Mobile Home. (Rumbolo Decl., ¶ 15.) Respondents are
known tenants of the Mobile Home under the lease agreement with Petitioner.
(Rumbolo Decl., ¶ 5.)
 
            Rumbolo explains
that, to the best of his knowledge and belief, the Mobilehome is unoccupied and
was unoccupied prior to December 13, 2023, the date of posting the 30-Day
Notice.  (Rumbolo Decl., ¶¶ 9-10.)  The Mobilehome is not permanently affixed to
the space and is located in the Park on a site for which no rent or storage
fees have been paid since July 2023.  (Rumbolo
Decl., ¶ 17.)
 
            The court finds that
the Mobilehome falls within the Civil Code § 798.61’s definition of abandoned.”

 
B.     Notice of Belief of Abandonment—Civ. Code § 798.61(b)
 
Civil Code § 798.61(b) requires: 
 
“After
determining a mobilehome in a mobilehome park to be an abandoned mobilehome,
the management shall post a notice of belief of abandonment on the mobilehome
for not less than 30 days, and shall deposit copies of the notice in the United
States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the homeowner at the last known
address and to any known registered owner, if different from the homeowner, and
to any known holder of a security interest in the abandoned mobilehome.  This notice shall be mailed by registered or
certified mail with a return receipt requested.”
 
On December 13, 2023, a 30-day Notice
of Belief of Abandonment was posted on the Mobilehome.  (Rumbolo Decl., ¶ 10; Ex. 3.)  On the same day, the Notice was mailed via
certified mail, return receipt requested, to Respondents at 3530 Damien Ave.,
Space 62, La Verne, CA 91750.  ((Rumbolo Decl., ¶ 12; Ex. 4.)
 
The court finds that Petitioner has
satisfied the requirements of § 798.61(b).
 
C.     Petition for Judicial Declaration—Civ. Code § 798.61(c)
 
Civil Code § 798.61(c)(1) states:
 
“Thirty or more days following posting pursuant to
subdivision (b), the management may file a petition in the superior court in
the county in which the mobilehome park is located, for a judicial declaration
of abandonment of the mobilehome. A proceeding under this subdivision is a
limited civil case. Copies of the petition shall be served upon the homeowner,
any known registered owner, and any known person having a lien or security
interest of record in the mobilehome by posting a copy on the mobilehome and
mailing copies to those persons at their last known addresses by registered or
certified mail with a return receipt requested in the United States mail,
postage prepaid.”
 
On March 1, 2024, more than 30 days
after posting and serving the Notice of Belief of Abandonment, Petitioner filed
the instant Petition.  Petitioner has
submitted proof that the Petition was served on Respondents individually on March
7, 2024, by posting a copy of the Petition 3530 Damien Ave., Space 62, La
Verne, CA 91750, and mailing the
Petition to the same address via certified mail, return receipt requested.  (3-08-24 Proofs of Service.) Respondents have
not provided any response to Petitioner or Petitioner’s agent.  (Rumbolo Decl., ¶ 16.)
 
            The court
finds the service requirements of § 798.61(c) have been satisfied.
 
D.   
Charges,
Attorney’s Fees, and Costs
 
Civil Code § 798.61(d)(2) states:
 
“If, at the hearing, the petitioner shows by a
preponderance of the evidence that the criteria for an abandoned mobilehome has
been satisfied and no party establishes an interest therein at the hearing and
tenders all past due rent and other charges, the court shall enter a judgment
of abandonment, determine the amount of charges to which the petitioner is
entitled, and award attorney's fees and costs to the petitioner.”
 
Petitioner seeks monthly storage charges of $26.63 per day
for an unspecified period of time, from the filing of the petition on March 1,
2024 until Respondents have paid all amounts due and removed the Mobile Home or
Petitioner has sold the Mobile Home. (Pet., Prayer for Relief, ¶ 2.) The daily
charge is based on the monthly rent for the mobilehome site. (Rumbolo Decl., ¶
17.)
 
Petitioner also seeks attorney’s
fees and costs “in an amount according to proof” but does not request a
specific sum. (Pet., Prayer for Relief, ¶ 3.) Petitioner has not filed a
declaration setting out attorney’s fees. Thus, the court does not award the
costs requested.
 
The court finds the storage charges
requested to be reasonable but cannot grant storage charges in an uncertain
amount in the manner Petitioner requests. The court grants Petitioner’s request
for storage charges in the amount of $4,873.29, calculated based on the time
between the abandonment of the Mobile Home on September 1, 2023 and the filing
of the Petition on March 1, 2024.
 
Petitioner has not filed a proposed
order. Petitioner is ordered to file a proposed order.
 
III.

Petitioner Cordova Estates’s unopposed
Petition to Declare Mobilehome Abandoned is GRANTED.  Petitioner is awarded $4,873.29 in storage

a corrected proposed “Judgment for Abandonment” consistent with this Court’s
ruling, within ten  (10) days of this
Court’s order..
