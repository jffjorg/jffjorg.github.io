 
BACKGROUND
 
On January 8, 2024, Plaintiff Luxe Development, Inc. dba
Luxe Home Solutions, Inc. (Plaintiff) filed a complaint against Defendants
Judith Taylor (Defendant) and Does 1 through 10. On July 31, 2024, Plaintiff
filed the operative second amended complaint (SAC) against Defendant alleging
causes of action for: (1) breach of written contract, (2) quantum meruit, and
(3) foreclosure of lien. 
 
On August
26, 2024, Defendant filed a demurrer to the second cause of action. The court
notes that the demurrer was not filed with an accompanying proof of service.
 
On October
8, 2024, Plaintiff filed an opposition to the demurrer. 
 
Defendant is admonished to file a
proof of service for any motions filed with the court. Defendant, in its prior
demurrer to the first amended complaint, also failed to file accompanying
proofs of service for its demurrer and its reply.
 
MOVING PARTY
POSITION
 
            Defendant
argues that quantum meruit is not a cause of action and such cause of action is
not available when there is an express contract pled.   
 
OPPOSITION
 
            On
opposition, Plaintiff argues that quantum meruit is a valid cause of action and
that Defendant is incorrect that quantum meruit cannot be pled alongside a
claim for breach of written contract when pled only in the alternative. 
 
REPLY
 
            As of
October 11, 2024, Defendant has not filed a reply.   
 
 
ANALYSIS
 
I.          Demurrer
A.               
Meet and Confer Requirement  
            Before
filing a demurrer, the moving party must meet and confer in person, by
telephone, or by video conference with the party who filed the pleading to
attempt to reach an agreement that would resolve the objections to the
pleading. (Code Civ. Proc. § 430.41.) “Any determination by the court that the
meet and confer process was insufficient shall not be grounds to overrule or
sustain a demurrer.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a)(4).)
            The court
finds that the meet and confer requirement has been met. Defendant’s counsel,
James Howard, declares that around August 23, 2024, he discussed the demurrer
with Plaintiff’s counsel. (Howard Decl., ¶ 2.) Mr. Howard and Plaintiff’s
counsel, however, were unable to come to a resolution. (Howard Decl., ¶ 2.) 
B.        Legal Standard 
A demurrer for sufficiency
tests whether the complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda
(2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747 (Hahn).) In a demurrer proceeding, the
defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial
notice. (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.)
In assessing a demurrer, the court “treat[s] the demurrer as admitting all
material facts properly pleaded, but not contentions, deductions or conclusions
of law.” (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) “The only issue
involved in a demurrer hearing is whether the complaint, as it stands,
unconnected with extraneous matters, states a cause of action.” (Hahn, supra,
147 Cal.App.4th at p. 747.)  A complaint
will be upheld against a demurrer if it pleads facts sufficient to place the
defendant on notice of the issues sufficient to enable the defendant to prepare
a defense.  (Doe v. City of Los
Angeles (2007) 42 Cal.4th 531, 549-50.) “Generally it is an abuse of
discretion to sustain a demurrer without leave to amend if there is any
reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by amendment.” (Goodman
v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 349.) A “[p]laintiff must show in what
manner he can amend his complaint and how that amendment will change the legal
effect of his pleading.” (Ibid.) In analyzing a demurrer, the
Court construes a complaint “liberally by drawing reasonable inferences from
the facts pleaded.” (Rodas v. Spiegel (2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 513, 517.)
1.         Second Cause of Action for Quantum
Meruit       
 
“Quantum meruit
refers to the well-established principle that the law implies a promise to pay
for services performed under circumstances disclosing that they were not
gratuitously rendered. To recover in quantum meruit, a party need not prove the
existence of a contract, but it must show the circumstances were such that the
services were rendered under some understanding or expectation of both parties
that compensation therefor was to be made.” (Chodos v. Borman (2014)
227 Cal.App.4th 76, 96 (citations and quotation marks omitted).) “[I]n
order to recover under a quantum meruit theory, a plaintiff must establish both
that he or she was acting pursuant to either an express or implied request for
such services from the defendant and that the services rendered were intended
to and did benefit the defendant.” (Day
v. Alta Bates Medical Center
(2002) 98 Cal.App.4th 243, 248.)
 
“A plaintiff may
not . . . pursue or recover on a quasi-contract claim if the parties have an
enforceable agreement regarding a particular subject matter.” (Klein v.
Chevron U.S.A., Inc. (2012) 202 Cal.App.4th 1342, 1388 (Klein).) A
cause of action for quantum meruit “is a quasi-contract claim for the
reasonable value of services rendered.” (Jogani v. Superior Court (2008)
165 Cal.App.4th 901, 909.) A plaintiff is prohibited from alleging a
quasi-contract cause of action where a plaintiff’s “breach of contract claim
[pleads] the existence of an enforceable agreement and their [quantum meruit]
claim [does] not deny the existence or enforceability of that agreement.” (Klein,
supra, 202 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1389-90.)
 
The court has already, in its July
31, 2024 notice of ruling on Defendant’s prior demurrer, determined that
quantum meruit is a valid cause of action.
 
The second cause of action for
quantum meruit in the second amended complaint incorporates the allegations of
the breach of contract cause of action.
 
The second amended complaint
alleges the following: on January 24, 2023, Plaintiff and Defendant entered
into a contract (the “Contract”) for renovations to 3645 Cardiff Ave., Unit
110, Los Angeles, CA 90034 (the “Project”) owned by Defendant. (SAC, ¶ 12; Ex.
2.) The Contract contained milestone installment payments for twelve discreet
phases of construction totaling $94,090.00. (SAC, ¶ 13.) The Contract did not
provide for a completion deadline for the Project. (SAC, ¶ 13.) Construction of
the Project began as scheduled and was completed. (SAC, ¶ 14.) In September and
October of 2023, Plaintiff requested that Defendant pay all amounts outstanding
under the Contract, and Defendant did not pay as agreed, which breached the
Contract. (SAC, ¶ 15.) On or about October 11, 2023, Plaintiff recorded a
Mechanic’s Lien in the principal amount of $18,618.00 with interest thereon at
the rate of 7 percent per annum from October 12, 2023. (SAC, ¶ 16.) Plaintiff
alleges that Defendant breached the Contract and that it has been damaged due
to such breach. (SAC, ¶¶ 29-30.) 
 
The second cause
of action for quantum meruit in the second amended complaint incorporates the
allegations of the breach of contract cause of action. (SAC, ¶ 31.) However,
Plaintiff clarifies that it is pleading quantum meruit only in the alternative
to breach of contract, and only if the express written contract is
unenforceable, void, non-existent, or otherwise inapplicable to the case. (SAC,
¶ 32.) Under Klein, a plaintiff may “plead inconsistent claims that
allege both the existence of an enforceable agreement and the absence of
an enforceable agreement.” (Klein, supra, 202 Cal.App.4th at p.
1389.) Plaintiff has adequately alleged the absence of an enforceable agreement
in its second cause of action. 
 
            The Court therefore OVERRULES
Defendant’s demurrer to the second cause of action in the second amended
complaint. 
 

 
II.        Conclusion 
 
            Based on the foregoing, Defendant’s demurrer to the second
cause of action in the first amended complaint is OVERRULED. 
 
Defendant’s
Answer is ordered to be filed within ten (10) days of this Court’s Ruling.
 
            Moving party is ordered to give
notice of ruling.
