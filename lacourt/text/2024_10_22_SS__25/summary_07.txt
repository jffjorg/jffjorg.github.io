And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the unopposed petition to declare a mobile home abandoned, filed by The Fountains La Verne MHP Associates, LP (Petitioner). The mobile home, located in La Verne, California, has been abandoned since September 1, 2023, and no rent has been paid since July 2023. The court finds that the mobile home meets the definition of an abandoned mobile home under Civil Code § 798.61 and that Petitioner has satisfied the requirements of § 798.61(b) by posting a 30-day notice of belief of abandonment and mailing it to the homeowners and registered owners.

The court awards Petitioner $4,873.29 in storage charges, calculated based on the time between the abandonment of the mobile home and the filing of the petition. The court also orders Petitioner to file a corrected proposed "Judgment for Abandonment" consistent with this ruling, within 10 days of the order.
