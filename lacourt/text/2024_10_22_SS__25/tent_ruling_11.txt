BACKGROUND 
 
This
case arises out of a contract dispute. 
On March 11, 2024, self-represented Plaintiff John Jenkins (“Plaintiff”)
filed his Complaint against Defendant Mary D. Castillo dba Help U Legal, Inc.
(“Defendant”) asserting nine causes of action. 
 
On
May 29, 2024, self-represented Defendant filed the instant demurrer to
Plaintiff’s Complaint without motion to strike. 
Defendant filed an Answer on the same day. 
 
On
June 24, 2024, Plaintiff filed his opposition. 

 
On
August 15, 2024, the Court denied Defendant’s request to reschedule the hearing
on the matter.  
 
On
August 19, 2024, the Court on its own motion continued the Demurrer to October
22, 2024. 
 
Trial
is set for September 8, 2025. 
 
ANALYSIS
 
Defendant demurs to each
cause of action alleged in the Complaint for sufficiency and uncertainty.
 
As an initial matter, the Court notes that the opening
memoranda motion exceeds 15 pages, and Defendant failed to make an application
to file a memorandum which exceeds the length permitted under California Rules
of Court, rule 3.1113, subdivision (d).  However,
the Court exercises its discretion to consider the arguments.  Further, a demurrer for uncertainty is not
permitted in a limited jurisdiction.  (Code of
Civ. Proc. § 92(c).) 
 
 
I.          Meet and Confer 
 
“Before filing a demurrer ... , the demurring party shall meet and
confer in person or by telephone with the party who filed the pleading that is
subject to demurrer for the purpose of determining whether an agreement can be
reached that would resolve the objections to be raised in the demurrer.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a).)
 
Here, Defendant did not attach a meet and confer declaration, and
thus the Court finds that Defendant has not satisfied its meet and confer
obligations.  Nonetheless, the Court
exercises its discretion to consider Defendant’s demurrer. 
 
II.        Legal Standard  
 
A demurrer is a procedure to object to a pleading set forth
under Code of Civil Procedure section 430.10, et seq.¿ Because a
demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic
matters, a demurrer analysis considers only those defects which appear on the
face of the pleading or are judicially noticed.¿ (SKF Farms v. Superior
Court (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 902, 905.)¿ When considering demurrers, courts
assume the truth of the facts alleged in the pleading and read the allegations
liberally and in context.¿ (Schifando v. City of Los Angeles (2003) 31
Cal.4th 1074, 1081.) 
 
A demurrer for sufficiency attacks a pleading on the ground
that it does not contain facts sufficient to state a cause of action.¿ (Code
Civ. Proc., § 430.10 (e); Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.)¿
Parties may also demur to causes of action individually. 
 
A demurrer for uncertainty is
appropriate where the pleading is so poorly written that the defendant cannot
reasonably respond.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10 (f); Khoury v. Maly’s of
California, Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.)
 
First Cause of Action for Embezzlement
 
Embezzlement is
not a civil cause of action in California. (See Pen. Code § 503; Mohebbi v.
Khazaen (N.D. Cal. 2014) 50 F.Supp.3d 1234, 1257.) The civil equivalent of embezzlement is
conversion. (See Ferrick v. Santa Clara University (2014) 231
Cal.App.4th 1337, 1347, brackets in original [“Embezzlement
requires conversion of trusted funds [or property] coupled with intent to
defraud…”]) 
 
“Conversion is the wrongful exercise of dominion over the property
of another. The elements of a conversion claim are: (1) the plaintiff’s
ownership or right to possession of the property; (2) the defendant’s
conversion by a wrongful act or disposition of property rights; and (3)
damages.” (Lee v. Hanley (2015) 61 Cal.4th 1225, 1240.)  A conversion claim for money must specify a specific
sum at issue.  (Haigler v.
Donnelly (1941) 18 Cal.2d 674, 681.) 
 
Embezzlement is not a civil cause of
action, but the Court may construe Plaintiff’s first cause of action as one for
conversion.  The Complaint states no
facts under this cause of action nor does the Complaint incorporate facts from
preceding paragraphs.  The Court finds the Complaint fails to allege sufficient facts to constitute a
cause of action for conversion.
 
Second Cause of Action for Breach of Contract 
To state a cause of
action for breach of contract, Plaintiff must be able to establish “(1) the
existence of the contract, (2) plaintiff’s performance or excuse for
nonperformance, (3) defendant’s breach, and (4) the resulting damages to the
plaintiff.”  (Oasis West Realty, LLC
v. Goldman (2011) 51 Cal.4th 811, 821.)
The second cause of action suffers from
the same defects as the first cause of action. 

  
Third Cause of Action for Fraud 
“The elements of fraud are (a)
a misrepresentation (false representation, concealment, or nondisclosure); (b)
scienter or knowledge of its falsity; (c) intent to induce reliance; (d)
justifiable reliance; and (e) resulting damage.” (Hinesley v. Oakshade Town
Ctr. (2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 289, 294.) The facts constituting the alleged
fraud must be alleged factually and specifically as to every element of fraud,
as the policy of “liberal construction” of the pleadings will not ordinarily be
invoked. (Lazar v. Superior Court (1996) 12 Cal.4th 631, 645.) To
properly allege fraud against a corporation, the plaintiffs must plead the
names of the persons allegedly making the false representations, their
authority to speak, to whom they spoke, what they said or wrote, and when it
was said or written. (Tarmann v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. (1991) 2
Cal.App.4th 153, 157.)
The Court finds that the
Complaint fails to plead the elements of fraud and with the specificity
required. 
Fourth Cause of Action for Violation of California Code of
Regulations section 1304.1 Bait and Switch
The fourth cause of action fails because California Code of
Regulations section 1304.1 merely defines “Bait and Switch Advertising.”  As such, it cannot be the basis for a cause
of action. 
Fifth Cause of Action for Legal Malpractice
 
“To state a cause of action for legal malpractice, a plaintiff
must plead (1) the duty of the attorney to use such skill, prudence, and
diligence as members of his or her profession commonly possess and exercise;
(2) a breach of that duty; (3) a proximate causal connection between the breach
and the resulting injury; and (4) actual loss or damage resulting from the
attorney’s negligence.”  (Kumaraperu
v. Feldsted (2015) 237 Cal.App.4th 60, 66, quotation marks omitted.)
The Court finds that the Complaint
fails to allege sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action for legal
malpractice as the Complaint merely alleges “legal
malpractice based on negligence.”  
 
Sixth Cause of Acton for Elder Abuse
To state a cause of action
for elder abuse and neglect, plaintiff must allege “[p]hysical abuse, neglect,
abandonment, isolation, abduction, or other treatment with resulting physical
harm or pain or mental suffering.”  (Welf.
& Inst. Code, § 15610.07, subd. (a)(1).)  Acts which are prohibited under the Elder
Abuse Act provisions of the Welfare and Institute Code “do not include acts of
simple professional negligence, but refer to forms of abuse or neglect
performed with some state of culpability greater than mere negligence.”  (Covenant Care, Inc. v. Superior Court
(2004) 32 Cal.4th 771, 781 (Covenant Care).)  To constitute abuse and neglect within the
meaning of the Elder Abuse Act, thereby triggering the enhanced remedies
available under the Act, plaintiff “must demonstrate by clear and convincing
evidence that defendant is guilty of something more than negligence; he or she
must show reckless, oppressive, fraudulent, or malicious conduct,” with
recklessness referring “to a subjective state of culpability greater than
simple negligence, which has been described as a “deliberapartte disregard” of
the “high degree of probability” that an injury will occur,” and “[o]ppression,
fraud and malice [involving] intentional or conscious wrongdoing of a
despicable or injurious nature.”  (Sababin
v. Superior Court (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 81, 88-89, quotation marks
omitted.)
Like third cause of action for fraud, the Complaint fails to meet the heightened standard of pleading for
an elder abuse claim.  
Seventh Cause of Action for Violation of Business and
Professions Code section 13741 Illegal Conversion of Property 
 
Business and Professions Code section 13741 states:
(a)  
 It is unlawful for any person or other legal
entity to make any deceptive, false, or misleading statement by any means
whatever regarding quality, quantity, performance, price, discount, or saving
in the sale or selling of any commodity regulated pursuant to this chapter.
 
(b)  
Any manufacturer or packager of any
product subject to this chapter and sold in this state shall provide, upon
request, to a duly authorized representative of the department documentation of
any claim made on his or her product's label.
 
The Complaint’s seventh cause of
action alleges that Defendant violated section 13741 “by causing pain and
suffering for denying the return of finance that was done under illegal
conversion of property,” however section 13741 does not concern
conversion.  A conversion claim for money
must specify a specific sum at issue.  Further,
the seventh cause of action is duplicative of the first cause of action for
embezzlement, which is construed as conversion.  The Complaint fails to allege sufficient facts
to constitute a cause of action for conversion. 

 
Eight
Cause of Action for Violation of Civil Code sections 1714(a), 3333, 3281, and 1708 (Not Performing
Contractual Agreement) 
 
The eight cause of action is duplicative
of the second cause of action for breach of contract. 
 
Ninth Cause of Action for Violation of
Civil Code section 3345 (Treble Damages)
 
Civil Code
section 3345 applies to actions brought by, on behalf of, or for the benefit of
senior citizens or disabled persons to redress unfair or deceptive acts or
practices or unfair methods of competition.  (Civ. Code, § 3345(a).)  Section 3345(b) allows for a recovery of up to three times
the amount of a monetary award whenever “a trier of fact is authorized by a
statute to impose either a fine, or a civil penalty or other penalty, or any
other remedy the purpose or effect of which is to punish or deter,” if the
trier of fact finds any of the factors identified in the statute to exist.
 
The Complaint
alleges “Defendant violated C.C. § 3345 treble
damages for redressing unfair or deceptive acts, or dereliction of duty.” Section 3345 applies to fraud and unfair business practices
targeting the elderly and allows a plaintiff to seek treble punitive damages as
well as statutory fines.  However, the
Court has found that the third cause of action for fraud fails because it does not meet the heightened
standard of pleading that fraud must be specifically pled.  Further, section 3345 is not intended to allow redress for the types
of conduct constituting elder abuse and neglect as defined in the Welfare and
Institutions Code.  
 
Leave to Amend 
 
The burden
is on the plaintiff to prove there is a reasonable possibility that any defects
in the pleading can be cured by amendment.  (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311,
318.)  California law holds that leave to
amend is to be granted liberally, to accomplish substantial justice for both
parties.  (Hirsa v. Superior Court
(1981) 118 Cal.App.3d 486, 489.)

Help U Legal, Inc.’s Demurrer is SUSTAINED with leave to amend.

Amended Complaint within 30 days.
