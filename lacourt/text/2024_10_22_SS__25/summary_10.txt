Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled on Defendant's demurrer to the second cause of action for quantum meruit. The judge finds that quantum meruit is a valid cause of action and that the second cause of action in the second amended complaint has adequately pleaded the absence of an enforceable agreement. The judge overrules the demurrer and orders Defendant to file an answer within 10 days. The judge also orders the moving party to give notice of the ruling. The judge notes that the meet and confer requirement has been met, and the court has already determined that quantum meruit is a valid cause of action.
