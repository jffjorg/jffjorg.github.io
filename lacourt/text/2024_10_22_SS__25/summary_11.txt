And here is a summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of John Jenkins v. Mary D. Castillo dba Help U Legal, Inc. (Case No. 24STLC01749). The defendant has filed a demurrer without a motion to strike, arguing that the plaintiff's complaint does not state a cause of action. The judge has sustained the demurrer with leave to amend, meaning that the plaintiff has 30 days to file a new complaint that addresses the issues raised by the demurrer.

The judge found that the plaintiff's complaint failed to plead the elements of fraud and elder abuse, and that the causes of action for embezzlement, breach of contract, and legal malpractice were inadequately pleaded. The judge also found that the complaint failed to specify a specific sum at issue in the claims for conversion and treble damages.

The judge has ordered the plaintiff to file a First Amended Complaint that addresses these issues and to clearly identify the defendant(s) being named in the action. The defendant is ordered to give notice of the ruling.
