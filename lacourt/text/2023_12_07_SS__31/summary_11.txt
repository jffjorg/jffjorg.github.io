And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the motion to be relieved as counsel without prejudice. The motion was filed by the attorney, Khashayar Eshraghi, on behalf of the plaintiff, Justin Biggers, due to the plaintiff's lack of cooperation in providing verifications for overdue discovery. However, the judge noted that the attorney of record for the plaintiff is actually Daniel Azizi, not Eshraghi, and that Eshraghi failed to provide sufficient information on the investigative service he used to locate the plaintiff's current address. The judge ordered the moving counsel to provide further detail on this matter if a new motion is filed. The parties are encouraged to meet and confer to reach an agreement, and if they intend to submit on the tentative ruling, they must send an email to the court.
