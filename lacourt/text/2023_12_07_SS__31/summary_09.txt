And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively granted the motion of Plaintiff Eduardo Galeno's counsel, Tofer & Associates and Sara Martinez, Esq., to be relieved as counsel. The motion was unopposed and was granted due to a conflict of interest and the counsel's inability to contact the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff is currently incarcerated and has been transferred several times, making it difficult for the counsel to reach him. The judge has ordered the counsel to give notice and has given the Plaintiff sufficient time to seek other counsel or prepare for the upcoming trial on August 26, 2024. The parties are encouraged to meet and confer to reach an agreement, and if necessary, to submit written arguments or appear remotely or in person for oral argument.
