And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the defendant's motion for terminating sanctions and dismissing the plaintiff's action. The plaintiff failed to comply with a court order to serve verified discovery responses and pay monetary sanctions. The defendant served a notice of the court's order on the plaintiff, and despite a letter from defense counsel requesting compliance, the plaintiff failed to respond. The judge concludes that the plaintiff's failure to comply with discovery obligations was willful and that lesser sanctions would not curb the abuse. As a result, the plaintiff's action is dismissed, and the defendant's motion for terminating sanctions is granted.
