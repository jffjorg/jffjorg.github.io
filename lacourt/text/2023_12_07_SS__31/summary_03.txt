English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling addresses Plaintiff David Medina's renewed motion for terminating sanctions against New Beginnings Christian Discipleship for disobeying the Court's September 2, 2022 order compelling verified responses to Plaintiff's discovery requests. The Court previously denied the motion due to Plaintiff's failure to pay an additional filing fee, but the renewed motion has cured this defect. The Court notes that New Beginnings failed to comply with the discovery order and that Defendant Grogan filed unverified discovery responses on behalf of New Beginnings. The Court denies the motion for terminating sanctions at this time, but sets an OSC re: Why Defendant New Beginnings' Answer Should Not Be Stricken for New Beginnings to find counsel to represent it. The Court also orders Plaintiff to give notice.
