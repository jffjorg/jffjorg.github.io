 Case Number:  22STCV09232    Hearing Date:   December 7, 2023    Dept:  31 DEPT:   31 OSC DATE:  12/07/2023 CASE NAME/NUMBER:  22STCV09232 UNITED FINANCIAL CASUALTY COMPANY vs MAURO FARIAS, et al. REQUEST FOR COURT JUDGMENT AGAINST [DEFAULTING PARTY]:  MAURO FARIAS ROSALBA FARIAS RECOMMENDATION:  DENY for the reasons below.   TENTATIVE  Plaintiff seeks reimbursement for the amount it paid for its insured’s damages in the principal amount of $55,385.64 in this subrogation claim against Defendants Mauro Farias (“Mauro”) and Rosalba Farias (“Rosalba”) (collectively, “Defendants”). Plaintiff also seeks costs in the amount of $553.   The request for default judgment submitted on November 3, 2023 is DENIED for the following reasons:  Mauro is identified as the driver of the vehicle, and Rosalba is identified as the owner of the vehicle. However, Cal. Veh. Code § 17151 provides the liability of the owner is limited to $15,000 for the injury to one person in any one accident, and limited to the amount $5,000 for damage to property of others in any one accident. Plaintiff seeking $55,939.14 against both Defendants, jointly and severally, necessarily exceeds the statutory cap on Rosalba.   Plaintiff’s proposed judgment must notate on JUD-100, item 7, specifically limiting Rosalba’s liability to no more than permissible per Vehicle Code § 17151. Plaintiff must specify the amount sought against Rosalba within the limitations of Vehicle Code § 17151 on CIV-100, Item 1(d). Plaintiff may recover the remainder of the judgment sought against Mauro, the driver.  Plaintiff is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
