The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the motion to be relieved as counsel, filed by Jacob O. Partiyeli, Esq. (Counsel) on behalf of the plaintiff, Jennifer Dominguez. The motion was made because the plaintiff has failed to respond to Counsel's telephone calls and letters, resulting in irreconcilable differences between the parties. The judge is satisfied with Counsel's explanation of how he was able to confirm the plaintiff's current address through the plaintiff's neighbors and has conditionally granted the motion. The ruling is effective upon filing proof of service of the final order. The judge encourages the parties to meet and confer to reach an agreement and notes that if a party intends to submit to the tentative ruling, they must send an email to the court with the subject line "SUBMIT" followed by the case number.
