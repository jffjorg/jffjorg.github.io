And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has granted the request for default judgment filed on October 24, 2023 in the amount of $501,521.60. The damages awarded include $42,100 against Josiah Dawson and Sally Sanchez, jointly and severally, for a portion of the special damages within the limitations of California Civil Code section 1714.1. Additionally, Dawson is liable for $375,518.97 for general damages, $83,072.99 for the remaining past medical specials, and $829.64 in costs. The court did not award punitive damages due to the lack of evidence regarding Dawson's financial condition, net worth, and ability to pay.
