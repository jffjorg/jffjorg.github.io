 Case Number:  20STCV30675    Hearing Date:   December 7, 2023    Dept:  31 SUPERIOR COURT OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA  FOR THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES - CENTRAL DISTRICT  KENYCE SMITH and ABIGAIL GREY, Plaintiff(s),  vs.  CODY ARAGHACHI, ET AL.,  Defendant(s). ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) )       CASE NO: 20STCV30675  [TENTATIVE] ORDER RE (1) MOTION TO COMPEL DISCOVERY RESPONSES, AND (2) MOTION TO DEEM ADMISSIONS ADMITTED  Dept. 31 1:30 p.m.  December 7, 2023  I. Motion to Compel Defendants Uber Technologies, Inc., Rasier, LLC, and Rasier-CA, LLC (collectively, “Uber Defendants”) propounded request for production of documents (“RPDs”), set one, on Plaintiff Abigail Grey (“Plaintiff”) on July 21, 2023. (Stinson Decl, ¶ 3; Exh. 1.) After receiving no responses, Uber’s counsel sent a meet and confer letter to Plaintiff’s counsel requesting responses no later than October 6, 2023. To date, Plaintiff has not served responses. (Id. at ¶ 5.) The Uber Defendants therefore seek an order compelling Plaintiff to respond, without objections, to the outstanding discovery.  As of November 22, 2023, the motion is unopposed. For a motion to compel discovery responses, all a propounding party must show is that it properly served its discovery requests, that the time to respond has expired, and that the party to whom the requests were directed failed to provide a timely response. (See Leach v. Superior Court (1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 902, 905 906.) Where a party fails to serve timely responses to discovery requests, the court may make an order compelling responses.  (2031.300; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 403.)  A party that fails to serve timely responses waives any objections to the request, including ones based on privilege or the protection of attorney work product.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a).)   Therefore, because the evidence shows Plaintiff was properly served with discovery and failed to respond, the Uber Defendants’ unopposed motion is GRANTED. Plaintiff Abigail Grey is ordered to serve verified responses to the Uber Defendants’ RPDs, set one, without objections, within fifteen (15) days. (2031.300(a),(b).)  II. Motion To Deem Admitted Under Code of Civil Procedure 2033.280(b), failure to respond to requests for admission in a timely manner allows the requesting party to “move for an order that…the truth of any matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted” by the party that failed to respond.  The requesting party’s motion must be granted by the court, “unless [the court] finds that the party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220.”  (Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.280(c).)   The Uber Defendants propounded requests for admissions (“RFAs”), set one, on Plaintiff on July 21, 2023. (Stinson Decl, ¶ 3; Exh. 1.) The evidence shows that the Uber Defendants properly served RFAs, set one, on Plaintiff and Plaintiff failed to respond. Furthermore, as Plaintiff did not oppose the motion, there is no evidence that any responses in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220 were served before the hearing on the motion.  Therefore, the Uber Defendants’ unopposed motion is granted.  (CCP §2033.280(b).)  The Uber Defendants’ RFAs, set one, are deemed admitted against Plaintiff Abigail Grey.   III. Sanctions Sanctions are mandatory against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling, unless a court makes certain findings.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., 2031.300(c).)¿ Plaintiff did not file any opposition. However, sanctions may be awarded, even though no opposition is filed pursuant to CRC 3.1348(a). Further, “It is mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion.”  (CCP § 2033.280(c).) The Uber Defendants request $1,386.65 for each motion.   The Uber Defendants are awarded 1 hour to prepare each motion and one hour to appear at the hearing, all at the requested rate of $250 per hour, for a total of $750 in attorney’s fees. Further, the Uber Defendants are awarded two motion filing fees of $61.65, for a total of $123.30 as costs.      Sanctions are imposed against Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s counsel, jointly and severally. Plaintiff and/or Plaintiff’s counsel are ordered to pay sanctions to the Uber Defendants, by and through counsel of record, in the total amount of $873.30, within twenty (20) days.  Moving Defendants are ordered to give notice.    PLEASE TAKE NOTICE: Parties are encouraged to meet and confer after reading this tentative ruling to see if they can reach an agreement. If a party intends to submit on this tentative ruling,¿the party must send an email to the court at¿sscdept31@lacourt.org¿with the Subject line “SUBMIT” followed by the case number.¿ The body of the email must include the hearing date and time, counsel’s contact information, and the identity of the party submitting.¿¿ Unless¿all¿parties submit by email to this tentative ruling, the parties should arrange to appear remotely (encouraged) or in person for oral argument.¿ You should assume that others may appear at the hearing to argue.¿¿ If the parties neither submit nor appear at hearing, the Court may take the motion off calendar or adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the Court.¿ After the Court has issued a tentative ruling, the Court may prohibit the withdrawal of the subject motion without leave.¿  Dated this 6th day of December 2023      Hon.
