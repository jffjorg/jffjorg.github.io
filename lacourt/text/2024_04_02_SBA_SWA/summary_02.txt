```yaml
Case Number: SC127639
Case Name: Barry Judenfriend v. Steven M. Miller, et al.
Proceeding: Motion for Retrial/New Trial per CCP ยง616
Responding Party: Defendants
Tentative Ruling: Denied

Background:
  - Plaintiff's Claims: (multiple)
  - Defendant's Actions: (multiple)

Facts:
  - Plaintiff was in financial distress due to health issues
  - Defendant Miller and NMRI made misrepresentations to Plaintiff
  - Plaintiff relied on these misrepresentations and stopped making mortgage payments
  - Defendant Dube acquired the First Bank Second Mortgage and foreclosed on the property

Procedural History:

  - Virtanen v. O'Connell (2006) 140 Cal.App.4th 688: Court's discretion in granting retrial

Analysis:

  - Retrial would lead to confusion and potentially conflicting verdicts
  - Plaintiff's claim for non-economic loss appears to be barred by the "economic loss rule"
  - Evidence does not support a reasonable basis for a "clear and convincing" case supporting a finding of "fraud, malice or oppression" against NMRI

Conclusion:
  - Plaintiff's motion for retrial denied
```

English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling is to deny Plaintiff's motion for retrial. The judge finds that the claims on which the jury failed to return a verdict are not sufficiently distinct and severable from those on which they returned a verdict. Retrial would lead to confusion and potentially conflicting verdicts. Additionally, Plaintiff's claim for non-economic loss appears to be barred by the "economic loss rule". The evidence presented at trial did not support a reasonable basis for a "clear and convincing" case supporting a finding of "fraud, malice or oppression" against NMRI.
