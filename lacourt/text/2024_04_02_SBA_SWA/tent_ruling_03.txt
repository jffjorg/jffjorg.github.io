[1] NMRI refers to Plaintiff’s request as one for
new trial.  As Plaintiff points out in
his briefs, he is not technically requesting a new trial, nor may he given that
not all claims have been resolved and no judgment entered.  Plaintiff is requesting a retrial on those
claims for which the jury did not reach a verdict.  The request will be referenced as one for
retrial.  (Virtanen v. O’Connell (2006)
140 Cal.App.4th 688, 696, fn 1 (“While Virtanen filed a motion
styled as one for a partial “new trial,” as a technical point the motion is
properly characterized as one for a partial retrial under Code of Civil
Procedure section 616.  Consequently, we
will describe the motion as having been for a partial retrial.”)
