And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Defendant Eva Ferris' motion to strike punitive damages from the plaintiff's complaint. The plaintiff, Marisa Maravilla, had alleged that the defendants were aware of the probability of harm and consciously disregarded it, but the judge found that the plaintiff's allegations did not rise to the level of conduct that would warrant punitive damages. The judge noted that the plaintiff's claims failed to demonstrate that the defendants knew or should have known that there was a high probability of harm, rather than just a potential for harm. As a result, the judge granted the defendant's motion to strike punitive damages, but gave the plaintiff 30 days to amend their complaint to plead sufficient facts to support a claim for punitive damages.
