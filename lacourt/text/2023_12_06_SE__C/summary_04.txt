And here is a summary in English text:

The Court's tentative ruling denies Dyno Autosales, Inc.'s motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication in its entirety. The Court also denies Dyno Autosales, Inc.'s motion for summary adjudication as to Plaintiff Elizabeth A. Velasco's claims. The Court finds that there are triable issues of material fact regarding the defendant's obligations under the express warranty and the implied warranty of merchantability. The Court also finds that the defendant's motion for summary adjudication as to the third cause of action, negligent repair, lacks merit.

The Court grants Plaintiff's motion for summary adjudication as to Defendant's first through thirty-seven affirmative defenses, but continues the matter to December 13, 2023 to allow Defendant to correct procedural defects in its opposition papers. The Court instructs Defendant to refile its opposition papers that comply with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1350 and Code of Civil Procedure § 437c(b)(3) within one court day of this order.
