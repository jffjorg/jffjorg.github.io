And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has taken the defendants' counsel's motion to be relieved as counsel under submission. The motion is based on the grounds under Rules of Professional Conduct Rule 3-700(C), which allows an attorney to withdraw from representation if the client insists on presenting a claim or defense that is not warranted under existing law, seeks to pursue an illegal course of conduct, or breaches an agreement or obligation to the member. The judge has not found good cause for the motion based on the attached declaration, but the counsel has requested to present evidence at the hearing. The judge is considering granting the motion based on any of the grounds under Rule 3-700(C).
