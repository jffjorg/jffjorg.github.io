And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling denies the Defendants' motion for summary adjudication as to the third cause of action for Violation of Ralph Civil Rights Act. The Plaintiff, Michelle Provost-Sierks, alleges that she was sexually assaulted by an EMT in an ambulance on November 10, 2018, and claims that the assault was motivated by the Defendant's perception of her sex. The Judge finds that the Plaintiff's allegations and deposition testimony are sufficient to show that the Defendant committed violence against the Plaintiff on account of her sex. The Judge also finds that the third cause of action is timely, despite the Defendants' argument that it is barred by the one-year statute of limitations for claims brought under the Unruh Civil Rights Act.
