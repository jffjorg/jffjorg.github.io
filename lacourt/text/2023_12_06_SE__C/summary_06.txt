The court has tentatively ruled in favor of the plaintiff, Juan Moreno, in his lawsuit against American Honda Motor, Co.

The defendant is ordered to answer the complaint within 30 days. The court found that the plaintiff's fraud claim is not preempted by federal law, that the plaintiff has sufficiently pled a duty to disclose, and that the economic loss rule does not bar the plaintiff's fraud claim. Additionally, the court denied the defendant's motion to strike the claim for punitive damages, finding that the plaintiff has properly alleged a fraud cause of action.
