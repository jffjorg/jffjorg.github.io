CASE NO.:  21NWCV00227
HEARING:   12/6/23 @ 9:30 AM
#1
 
Plaintiff’s Motions to Compel Compliance and
Deem Matters Admitted are GRANTED.
Moving Party to give NOTICE.
 
Plaintiff
Javier Ortegon (Plaintiff) moves to compel compliance with Defendant Steven
Mitchell’s (Defendant Mitchell) responses to Plaintiff’s Request for Production
(set one) and to deem matters admitted against Defendant Carolina Cortazar
(Defendant Cortazar). Plaintiff seeks sanctions against Defendant Mitchell and
Defendant Cortazar.
Background
This
is a landlord-tenant dispute between Plaintiff and Defendants Carolina
Cortazar, Steven Mitchell, and Carlos Sandoval (collectively Defendants).
Plaintiff alleges that Defendants unlawfully entered the leased property on
several occasions, threatened Plaintiff, removed Plaintiff’s personal property,
and wrongfully evicted Plaintiff.
Late-Oppositions
Defendants’
late filed oppositions will be considered for these Motions.
Motion
to Compel Compliance
“If
a party filing a response to a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or
sampling under Sections 2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230, 2031.240, and 2031.280
thereafter fails to permit the inspection, copying, testing, or sampling in
accordance with that party's statement of compliance, the demanding party may
move for an order compelling compliance.” (CCP § 2031.320.)

Plaintiff served his Requests for Production
(set one) on Defendant Cortazar. Defendant Cortazar responded on April 14, 2022
stating that she would comply with Requests Nos. 1-7. However, Defendant
Cortazar has not produce any responsive documents as of the date of this
hearing. Defendant Cortaar argues that Plaintiff failed to meet and confer,
however, CCP § 2031.320 does not require a meet and confer declaration.
Additionally Defendant Cortazar argues that the motion is improper because she
objected to the Requests. However, the responses state that she would “comply
with the request by producing copies of responsive documents ….” Thus, a motion
to compel compliance is appropriate. Thus, Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel
Compliance is granted.
Motion to Deem Matters Admitted
“If a party to whom requests for admission are
directed fails to serve a timely response, the following rules apply … (b) The requesting
party may move for an order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth
of any matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted … (c) The court
shall make this order, unless it finds that the party to whom the requests for
admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a
proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial
compliance with Section 2033.220.” (CCP § 2033.280.)
Plaintiff served his Requests for Admission
(set one) on Defendant Mitchell on July 25, 2023. Defendant Mitchell’s
responses were due on August 28, 2023. However, Defendant Mitchell did not
respond on August 28, 2023. Defendant filed with the Court a declaration
stating and attaching his responses which were served on December 5, 2023. Thus,
Plaintiff’s Motion to Deem Matters Admitted is denied.
Sanctions
Sanctions are mandatory against any party,
person, or attorney who fails to timely serve responses to requests for
admission or who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response
to interrogatories unless the one subject to sanctions acted with substantial
justification or other circumstances make the imposition of sanctions unjust.
(CCP §§ 2031.320(b), 2033.280(c).) 
Sanctions may be awarded, even though no opposition is filed pursuant to
CRC 3.1348(a).
Plaintiff seeks $2,524.37 in sanctions against
Defendant Mitchell consisting of 4.5 hours preparing the motion and 2.5 hours
reviewing the opposition and drafting a reply at $350.00 per hour and $74.37 in
filing fees. The Motion is unopposed and the Court finds that the amount of
time requested to draft a basic discovery motion is excessive. Sanctions will
be awarded in the reduced amount of $1,124.37.
Plaintiff seeks $1,824.77 in sanctions against
Defendant Cortazar consisting of 3 hours preparing the motion and 2 hours
reviewing the opposition, drafting a reply, and attending the hearing at
$350.00 per hour and $74.77 in filing fees. The Motion is unopposed. Sanctions
will be awarded in the reduced amount of $1,474.77.
Ex Parte Application for Protective
Order
Defendants apply ex parte for an order staying
the depositions of Defendants, quashing the notice of depositions, and a
protective order from Defendants responding to further written discovery or
appearing at any deposition by Plaintiff or in the alternative an order
shortening time for hearing on the motion. Defendants’ application for an order
shortening time for hearing on the Defendants’ Motion for Protective Order is
GRANTED. Defendants’ Motion for Protective Order is set for January 17, 2024 at
10:30 AM in Dept. C. Briefing schedule is per code.
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s
Motion to Compel Compliance is GRANTED. Defendant Mitchell is to comply with
his response allowing inspection, copying, testing, or sampling of Requests for
Production Nos. 1-7 within 20 days of this Order. Plaintiff’s Motion to Deem
Matters Admitted is GRANTED. Plaintiff’s request for sanctions is GRANTED and
imposed against Defendant Mitchell and his counsel of record, jointly and
severally, in the reduced amount of $1,124.37 and against Defendant Cortazar
and her counsel of record, jointly and severally, in the reduced amount of
$1,474.77.
