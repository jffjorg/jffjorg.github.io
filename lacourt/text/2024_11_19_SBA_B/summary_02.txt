And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied the defendant's motion to compel arbitration and stay the case. The defendant, Clear Recovery Center, LLC, argued that the plaintiff, Jane Doe, had signed admission and financial agreements that contained an arbitration provision. However, the court found that the defendant had not met its burden to show the existence of an arbitration provision, as the agreements were not signed by the plaintiff and did not contain the signature block for the dispute resolution clause. The court also found that even if an arbitration provision existed, it was narrow and did not encompass the plaintiff's tort claims. Therefore, the motion to compel arbitration and stay the case was denied.
