Summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer hearing in the case of Marci Bertuzzi (plaintiff) vs. Timothy Mutton (defendant). The demurrer was filed by the defendant, arguing that the complaint fails to state sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action for removal of managing member and gross mismanagement.

The Judge has sustained the demurrer with leave to amend as to the first cause of action for removal of managing member, finding that the allegations are insufficient to constitute a cause of action. The Judge has ordered the plaintiff to allege facts showing that she is entitled to have the Court remove the defendant as manager.

The Judge has sustained the demurrer without leave to amend as to the sixth cause of action for gross mismanagement, finding that there is a lack of statutory and/or case authority that "gross mismanagement" is an independent cause of action.

The Judge has ordered the defendant to give notice of the ruling.
