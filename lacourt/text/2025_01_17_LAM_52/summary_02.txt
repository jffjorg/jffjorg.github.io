And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Gallery Department LLC's motion to quash the deposition subpoena to Pierre Towns. The judge found that defendant's arguments based on notice to employees under Code of Civil Procedure section 1985.6 and claims of privilege were weak and did not apply to the situation. The judge also found that defendant did not establish a legitimate privacy interest in the documents sought. The judge ordered defendant and its counsel to pay plaintiff $4,500 in sanctions for making the motion in bad faith and without substantial justification.
