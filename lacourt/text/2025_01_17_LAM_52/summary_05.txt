And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Adheesh Bhate v. Deepak Gosain, denying the plaintiff's request for default judgment. The reason for this decision is that the plaintiff has not provided sufficient proof of service of the summons on the defendant. The address listed as the location where the defendant was served is incomplete, and the plaintiff has also served the defendant with numerous papers by mail at a different address. Additionally, the plaintiff's default application has two defects: it does not properly request entry of judgment, and it fails to request prejudgment interest. As a result, the Judge has vacated the default of the defendant and denied the plaintiff's request for default judgment.
