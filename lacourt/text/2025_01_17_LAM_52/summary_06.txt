And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the County of Los Angeles's demurrer to the second amended complaint's second cause of action for retaliation under the Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA) is sustained without leave to amend. The judge finds that the plaintiff, Andrew Rodriguez, has not alleged sufficient facts to establish a cause of action under Government Code section 12940, subdivision (h), which requires that the plaintiff's actions demonstrate some degree of opposition to or protest of the defendant's conduct or practices based on the employee's reasonable belief that the employer's action or practice is unlawful. The judge concludes that the plaintiff's allegations of taking medical leave, submitting doctor's notes, and protesting conditions of employment do not constitute protected activity under FEHA. The judge also notes that the plaintiff has already amended the complaint twice and fails to demonstrate how the complaint can be amended to cure the defect in the second cause of action.
