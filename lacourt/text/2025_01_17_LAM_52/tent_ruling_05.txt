 Case Number:  24STCV14432    Hearing Date:   January 17, 2025    Dept:  52 Order to Show Cause Re: Entry of
Judgment
Plaintiff Adheesh Bhate requests court judgment by
default against defendant Deepak Gosain. 

Insufficient
Proof of Service of Summons
The court cannot enter default judgment because
plaintiff has not shown valid proof of service of summons on Gosain.  “ ‘[A] default judgment
entered against a defendant who was not served with a summons in the manner
prescribed by statute is void.’ ”  (Braugh
v. Dow (2023) 93 Cal.App.5th 76, 88.) 
The only proof of service of summons on Gosain states: “Address
where the party was served: Woodley Ave Van Nuys, CA 91436.”  (POS, ¶ 4.) 
The address is incomplete.  It
does not include the address number that should precede the street name.  The court further notes that plaintiff has
served numerous papers by mail to defendant at 12722 Millenium, #422, Playa
Vista, CA 90094.  
Without adequate proof of service, the court must
vacate defendant Gosain’s default.
Other
Defects
Plaintiff’s default application also has two other
defects.  First, plaintiff did not
properly request entry of judgment.  “A
party seeking a default judgment on declarations must use mandatory Request
for Entry of Default (Application to Enter Default) (form CIV-100).”  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1800(a).)  Though plaintiff submitted a form CIV-100,
plaintiff only checked the box for “entry of default.”  Plaintiff did not check the boxes or fill out
the section indicating plaintiff requests court judgment by default.  (CIV-100, caption & § 1.d.)    
Second, plaintiff seeks prejudgment interest without
properly requesting it or explaining how the amount was calculated.  A plaintiff who requests prejudgment interest
in a default judgment must provide “[i]nterest computations as necessary.”  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1800(a)(3).)  Plaintiff’s request for entry
of default includes other amounts in the “judgment to be entered” (CIV-100, §
2) but does not include any request for interest (§ 2.c).  Plaintiff’s proposed judgment on form
JUD-100, however, includes $57,541.60 in prejudgment interest at the annual
rate of 7.00%.  (JUD-100, ¶ 6.a(2).)  To recover prejudgment interest, plaintiff must
request it on the form CIV-100 and must provide interest computations showing
how the amount was calculated.  
Disposition
Plaintiff’s request for default judgment is denied.  The court hereby vacates the default
of defendant Deepak Gosain.
