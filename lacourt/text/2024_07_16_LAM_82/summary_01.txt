```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants Officer Mancia's petition for writ of administrative mandate, remanding the case to the Board of Rights for reconsideration. The judge finds that the administrative disapproval of Officer Mancia's tactics was not supported by the evidence and was based on a misunderstanding of LAPD policy.

The judge concludes that there was no "substantial deviation" from LAPD policy or training without justification, as Officer Mancia's failure to change position did not deviate from the training or policy. The judge also finds that the hearing officer failed to consider potential justifications for the tactics and did not properly evaluate the crossfire situation.

The judge notes that the LAPD's policy does not prohibit crossfires and requires officers to be aware of the potential and respond to it, which Officer Salsgiver eventually did. The judge also finds that the failure to call for backup was not a basis for the administrative disapproval.

Overall, the judge's tentative ruling is a victory for Officer Mancia, as it allows him to have his case reconsidered by the Board of Rights and potentially clears his name of any wrongdoing.
