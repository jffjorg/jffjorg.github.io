Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to reopen discovery regarding Dial Transport Inc.'s employment file. The plaintiff seeks to reopen discovery after a deposition revealed that Dial is no longer in possession of the file, which was lost sometime in November 2023. The judge found that the plaintiff did not sufficiently explain the necessity and reasons for the discovery, nor did they demonstrate diligence in seeking the discovery. The judge also noted that the motion was procedurally defective in failing to set forth efforts to meet and confer. As a result, the motion is denied, and the plaintiff is ordered to provide notice and file a proof of service.
