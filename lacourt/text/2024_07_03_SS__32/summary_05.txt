And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the motions for summary adjudication filed by Defendant The Vons Companies, Inc. and has issued a tentative ruling. The plaintiff, Ryan Cain Newell, filed a complaint against the defendant and others for injuries sustained during a physical altercation at a Vons grocery store.

The defendant moves for summary adjudication, arguing that there is no evidence that it breached a duty of care and that it did not know that the security guard, Phillip Wade, was unfit. The plaintiff argues that Wade was an employee of GSSI, Inc. and that the defendant exercised sufficient control over him.

The court finds that there are triable issues of fact regarding the existence of a duty and whether the defendant breached its duty. As a result, the motion for summary adjudication of the negligence cause of action is denied.

The court also grants the defendant's motion for summary adjudication as to the negligent hiring, supervision, and retention cause of action, finding that the plaintiff fails to meet his burden to show a triable issue of fact in this regard.

Accordingly, the court orders that the defendant's motion for summary adjudication of the negligence cause of action is denied, and the defendant's motion for summary adjudication as to the negligent hiring, supervision, and retention cause of action is granted.
