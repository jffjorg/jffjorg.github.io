[1] Though
Plaintiff asserts in Opposition that Defendant’s Separate Statement fails to
comply with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1350, the Court excuses the
defect and declines to deny based on procedural grounds. (See Opp., 9.) 


[2] The
Court notes Plaintiff’s Separate Statement was filed on June 26, 2024. The
opposition was due June 18, 2024. In reply, Defendant asserts Plaintiff served
the Separate Statement on June 25, 2024. (Reply, 2.) However, since it appears
Defendant was not prejudiced by the late filing, the Court will consider
Plaintiff’s Separate Statement. 


[3] Although
Defendant cites to cases regarding this theory of liability (see, e.g., Motion
at p. 7), Defendant presents no facts in its separate statement. The complaint
alleges this theory of liability. (See Complaint ¶ 34-35.) Defendant argues
that Plaintiff does not have evidence regarding this theory of liability, but
does not establish that Plaintiff cannot reasonably obtain such evidence. (Aguilar,
supra, 25 Cal.4th at 845.)


[4] No facts
are presented in the separate statement regarding the scope of agency. (See
Reply at pp. 3-4.)
