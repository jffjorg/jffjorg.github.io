And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is in response to a motion to compel responses from the defendant to plaintiff Alyssa Bersig's special interrogatories, set two. The plaintiff seeks monetary sanctions and the defendant opposes. The Judge notes that the plaintiff propounded the special interrogatories on February 22, 2024, and the defendant served responses on April 24, 2024. However, the plaintiff seeks to compel further responses to numbers 51-61, which contained only objections. The Judge continues the motion, requiring the parties to meet and confer by telephone to attempt to resolve their dispute. If they are unable to reach a resolution, they must appear for an informal discovery conference on July 23, 2024. The Judge orders the parties to file a joint status report two days in advance, setting forth which issues remain and any additional arguments.
