LEGAL
STANDARD
 
Under Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.480,
 
“(a)
If a deponent fails to answer any question or to produce any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing under the deponent's
control that is specified in the deposition notice or a deposition subpoena,
the party seeking discovery may move the court for an order compelling that

(b)
This motion shall be made no later than 60 days after the completion of the

“The
court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or

party seeking the discovery or the hearing of a discovery motion, and the
reasons that the discovery was not completed or that the discovery motion was
not heard earlier.¿ (3) Any likelihood that permitting the discovery or hearing
the discovery motion will prevent the case from going to trial on the date set,
or otherwise interfere with the trial calendar, or result in prejudice to any
other party.¿ (4) The length of time that has elapsed between any date
previously set, and the date presently set, for the trial of the action.”¿

unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial
justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction
unjust.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc., section 2024.050, subd. (c).)¿¿¿
 
MEET
AND CONFER
 
The Declaration of Emily T. Zinn, Defendants’ counsel, shows that she
inquired about the missing data in Dr. Hashish’s produced documents, and
followed up on May 13, 2024 via email. (Zinn Decl. ¶ 13–15, Exh. H.) Therefore,
the meet and confer requirement is met. 
 
DISCUSSION
 
As an initial matter, since discovery is closed, Defendants first
move for leave to reopen discovery to hear the underlying motion to compel
further. 
 
Here, Defendants seek to compel further responses to the request for
production, numbers 9, 16, 17, 19, and 22 from Plaintiff’s retained biomechanics
expert, Dr. Rami Hashish. Plaintiff designated Dr. Hashish on April 2, 2024.
(Zinn Decl. ¶ 3, Exh. A.) On April 3, 2024, Defendants noticed Dr. Hashish’s
deposition, which included a request for production of documents. The
deposition was re-noticed on April 11, 2024, set for April 25, 2024. (Id.
¶ 5, Exh. C.) Defendants finally re-noticed the deposition a third time, due to
Dr. Hashish’s unavailability, set for May 2, 2024. (Id. ¶ 6, Exh. D.) On
April 29, 2024, Dr. Hashish produced his expert file. Defendants contend the
documents did not contain the data used to make his calculations. Dr. Hashish
was deposed on May 2, 2024. 
 
Plaintiff filed the instant motion to compel further documents on
June 3, 2024, particularly to produce the data used in his calculations. 
 
Therefore, given the shortened expert discovery period, the Court
finds that Defendants acted diligently in bringing this motion. The discovery
also appears important to Defendant’ case and production will unlikely delay
trial. Therefore, the Court reopens discovery for the purpose of hearing the
underlying motion. 
 
In opposition, Plaintiff contends “Dr. Hashish provided all
his inputs and outputs, calculations, formulas, and all research he relied on.”
(Opp., 4.) 
 
In
reply, Defendants still contend that no data was produced. Although Defendants
contend that the data was not produced because it was based on propriety
software, this issue is not raised in Plaintiff’s opposition. Therefore,
because this issue was not raised in opposition, and Plaintiff does not contend
the data was produced, the motion to compel further is granted. 
 
The
Court declines to award sanctions as they were not requested by either party. 
 
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
 
Accordingly, Defendants’ motion to Compel Further Responses to
Requests for Production of Documents is granted. Plaintiff shall produce the
data relied upon by Dr. Hashish within 5 days. 
 
Defendants
to provide notice and file a proof of service of such.
