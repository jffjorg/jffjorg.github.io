And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case where the plaintiff has filed a separate statement and the defendant has filed an opposition. The judge notes that the plaintiff's separate statement was filed late, but since the defendant was not prejudiced by the delay, the judge will consider the statement. The judge also notes that the defendant has presented no facts to support its theory of liability, and that the complaint alleges the same theory. The judge encourages the defendant to establish that the plaintiff cannot reasonably obtain evidence to support its claims. The judge will consider the parties' arguments and make a final ruling at a later date.
