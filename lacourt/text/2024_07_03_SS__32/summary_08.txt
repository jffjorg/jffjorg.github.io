Summary in English text:

This tentative ruling denies Petitioner Paul David Levy's motion to compel arbitration and stay all judicial proceedings pending the completion of arbitration. The motion is denied due to procedural defects, including the failure to serve notice of motion and moving papers on non-moving parties and the lack of a copy of the purported insurance contract and a declaration pursuant to section 11580.2(f). The court finds that the moving party has not met its burden of proof to show the existence of a written agreement to arbitrate the controversy.
