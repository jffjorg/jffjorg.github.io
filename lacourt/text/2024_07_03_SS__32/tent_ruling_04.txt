[1] As the
Court previously noted when Defendants first applied for a determination of
good faith settlement, they provided no evidence of Plaintiff’s approximate
total recovery or evidence of their proportionate liability. Again, Defendants
provide here no evidence of Plaintiff’s approximate total recovery or evidence
to dispute Uber’s contention that Plaintiffs are claiming over $1 million in
medical costs. Moreover, Defendants again provide no evidence regarding their
proportionate liability, or even dispute Uber’s evidence that Defendants caused
the accident. Accordingly, moving Defendants’ citation to Bay Development,
Ltd. v. Superior Court (1990) 50 Cal.3d 1012, 1028 does not support their
position. There, the moving defendants presented evidence that they bore only
minor responsibility and presented evidence that the $1 million damages figure
was grossly exaggerated. (Id.) Although moving Defendants argue that
they have not filed an answer, have conducted no written discovery, and the
settlement was based on the information at the time of the settlement, they
have not presented the Court with what information was available to them at the
time of the settlement, that bears on the analysis of the plaintiffs’ total
recovery and proportionate liability.


[2] This
declaration was not provided with the first application for determination of
good faith settlement, but rather was submitted only at the time of the reply.
