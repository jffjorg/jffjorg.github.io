Summary:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for determination of good faith settlement in the case of 21STCV28134. The defendants, Adrienne Lombard and Cynthia Lombard, have entered into a settlement with the plaintiffs, Kenny Reese and Michele Bias, for $14,290.00 in exchange for dismissing the complaint against them with prejudice. The settlement amount represents the total remaining policy limits of $30,000 towards Aguilar and the plaintiffs. The opposing party, Uber Technologies, Inc., argues that the settlement is not proportionate to the defendants' liability. The Court finds significant the declaration of Adrienne Lombard, which states that her policy limits were $30,000 per accident and she has no other insurance policies or assets. The motion is continued to October 2, 2024, for Uber to complete discovery relating to Adrienne Lombard's claims of insolvency and insurance.
