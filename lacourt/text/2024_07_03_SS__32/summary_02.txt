And here is the summary of the tentative ruling:

This tentative ruling denies the petition for minors' compromise filed by Lucia Flores on behalf of her daughter, Setareh Flores, without prejudice. The petition was unopposed, and the court found that the petition was deficient in various ways. Specifically, the petition did not include amounts in 10b next to each defendant, and item 11b(5) was incomplete. The court also found that the entry in item 12a(3) contradicted other values in 12a. Additionally, the court noted that the proposed order reflected that the Medi-Cal lien had already been paid, but this was not reflected in the petition. The court denied the petition and ordered the petitioner to give notice and file a proof of service of such.
