Motion
  to Compel Arbitration




MOVING PARTY:


Petitioner Paul David Levy 




OPPOSING PARTY:


Unopposed



 
 
BACKGROUND
 
On July 27, 2022, Plaintiff Paul David Levy filed a complaint against
Margarita Salas, Gladys S. Salas, Socorro Salas, and Doe 1 to 50 for negligence
related to a motor vehicle accident that occurred on July 30, 2020. 
 
On May 10, 2024, Petitioner Paul David Levy (“Petitioner”) filed the
instant petition to compel arbitration with Respondent Farmers Insurance
pursuant to the Uninsured/Underinsured Motorist clause in his insurance
contract. Petitioner also seeks to stay this action pending resolution of the
arbitration. No opposition has been filed. 
 
LEGAL
STANDARD 
 
“Insurance Code section 11580.2 requires insurers to
provide coverage for bodily injury or wrongful death caused by uninsured
motorists. Subdivision (f) of this statute provides that if the insurer and the
insured cannot agree whether the insured is legally entitled to recover damages
from an uninsured motorist and the amount of such damages, those issues shall
be determined by arbitration. (Ins. Code, § 11580.2, subd. (f).)” (Bouton v.
USAA Casualty Ins. Co. (2008) 43 Cal.4th 1190, 1193.) 
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 1281.2 permits a party to
file a petition to request that the Court order the parties to arbitrate a
controversy.¿ Under section 1281.2, a party is permitted to file a motion to
request an order directing the parties to arbitrate a controversy.¿ Section
1281.2 also states that the Court may grant the motion if the Court determines
that an agreement to arbitrate the controversy exists.¿ 
 
When a motion to compel arbitration is filed and
accompanied by prima facie evidence of a written agreement to arbitrate the
controversy, the court itself must determine whether the agreement exists and,
if any defense to its enforcement is raised, whether it is enforceable.¿(Rosenthal
v. Great Western Financial Sec. Corp. (1996) 14 Cal.4th 394, 413.)¿ The
moving party bears the burden of proving its existence by a preponderance of
the evidence because the existence of the agreement is a statutory prerequisite
to granting the petition.¿(Ibid.)¿ 
 
Since binding arbitration is a matter of contract, the
parties may freely delineate the area of its application, and a proceeding to
compel arbitration is in essence a suit in equity to compel specific
performance of a contract.¿(Freeman v. State Farm Mutual Auto Insurance Co.
(1975) 14 Cal.3d 473, 479; Morris v. Zuckerman (1967) 257 Cal.App.2d 91,
96.)¿Arbitration, as a general rule, should be upheld by the court, unless it
can be said with assurance that an arbitration clause is not susceptible to an
interpretation covering the asserted dispute.¿(Bos Material Handling, Inc.
v. Crown Controls Corp. (1982) 137 Cal.App.3d 99, 105; O’Malley v.
Wilshire Oil Co. (1963) 59 Cal.2d 482, 490-491.)¿The court should,
nonetheless, give effect to the parties’ intentions in light of the usual and
ordinary meaning of the contractual language and the circumstances under which
the agreement was made.¿(Victoria v. Superior Court (1985) 40 Cal.3d
734, 744.)¿ 
 
Under Insurance Code section 11580.2, subdivision (i)(2),
any arbitration instituted pursuant to an uninsured motorist policy shall be
concluded within five years from the institution of the arbitration proceeding.
(Ins. Code, § 11580.2 subd. (i)(2)(A).) Further, the provisions of Insurance
Code section 11580.2 are deemed to be a part of every uninsured motorist
policy. (See Quintano v. Mercury Casualty Co. (1995) 11 Cal.4th 1049,
1053; Harford Fire Insurance Co. v. Macri (1992) 4 Cal.4th 318, 324; Travelers
Indemnity Co. v. Kowalski (1965) 233 Cal.App.2d 607, 609.)  
 
There are two “common themes” in case law interpreting the
scope of arbitration under section 11580.2 subdivision (f): “(1) arbitration of
issues other than liability and damages is appropriate if the parties have
contractually agreed to arbitrate more than is required by section 11580.2,
subdivision (f); and, (2) only issues of liability and damages may be decided
in an arbitral forum if the parties did not agree to arbitrate more than is
required by section 11580.2, subdivision (f).” (Bouton v. USAA Cas. Ins. Co.
(2008) 43 Cal.4th 1190, 1197.)  
 
“If the insured has or may have rights to benefits, other
than nonoccupational disability benefits, under any workers’ compensation law,
the arbitrator shall not proceed with the arbitration until the insured's
physical condition is stationary and ratable. In those cases in which the
insured claims a permanent disability, the claims shall, unless good cause be
shown, be adjudicated by award or settled by compromise and release before the
arbitration may proceed.” (Ins. Code § 11580.2(f).) 
 
“Any
demand or petition for arbitration shall contain a declaration, under penalty
of perjury, stating whether (i) the insured has a workers' compensation claim;
(ii) the claim has proceeded to findings and award or settlement on all issues
reasonably contemplated to be determined in that claim; and (iii) if not, what
reasons amounting to good cause are grounds for the arbitration to proceed
immediately.” (Ins. Code § 11580.2(f).) 
 
DISCUSSION
 
First,
there is no proof of service of this petition on Farmers Insurance. Code of Civil
Procedure section 1005 requires “written notice” of a motion including the
date, time and location of the hearing on a motion. A moving party’s failure to
serve the notice of motion and moving papers on a non-moving party violates the
basic principles of procedural due process under the federal and state
constitutions – notice and an opportunity to be heard.¿ (Logan v. Zimmerman
Brush Co. (1982) 455 U.S. 422, 428 [minimum due process requires notice and
opportunity for hearing appropriate to the nature of the case]; Horn v.
County of Ventura (1979) 24 Cal.3d 605, 612 [due process principles require
reasonable notice and opportunity to be heard].) 
 
Additionally,
Petitioner has not attached a copy of the purported insurance contract. There
also is no declaration pursuant to section 11580.2(f). 
 
Therefore, due to the procedural defects, the motion to
compel arbitration is denied. 
 
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
 
Therefore, Petitioner Paul David Levy’s motion to compel arbitration
and stay all judicial proceedings pending the completion of arbitration is DENIED.

 
Moving party shall provide notice of the Court’s ruling and file a
proof of service of such.
