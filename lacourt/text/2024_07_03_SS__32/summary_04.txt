And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering the defendant's application for a determination of good faith settlement. The defendant has not provided any evidence of the plaintiff's approximate total recovery or their proportionate liability. The judge notes that the defendant's previous submission did not provide any evidence to dispute Uber's contention that the plaintiff is claiming over $1 million in medical costs. The defendant's citation to Bay Development, Ltd. v. Superior Court (1990) does not support their position, as the defendants in that case presented evidence that they bore only minor responsibility and that the damages figure was grossly exaggerated. The judge is awaiting the defendant's submission of the information that was available to them at the time of the settlement, which would bear on the analysis of the plaintiff's total recovery and proportionate liability.
