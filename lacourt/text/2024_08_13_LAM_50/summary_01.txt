And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has continued the hearing on the defendants' motion for summary adjudication due to the voluminous number of evidentiary objections filed by both parties. The judge orders the parties to meet and confer in a serious and good faith effort to resolve and eliminate the objections. The parties are to reduce the objections to just a few and set forth the remaining material objections in a joint statement. The joint statement must be filed with the court on or before a specified date. The court will review the remaining objections with the parties at a hearing on the motion, which will be set at the hearing on objections. If necessary, the parties may file and serve revised briefing and evidence. The revised evidence may eliminate objectionable material, but no new evidence or argument may be submitted unless it is a result of compromises reached during the meet and confer process.
