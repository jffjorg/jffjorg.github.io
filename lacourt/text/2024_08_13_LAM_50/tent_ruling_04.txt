[TENTATIVE] ORDER
  RE:  
 
PLAINTIFF’S REQUEST FOR DEFAULT JUDGMENT
 




            
Plaintiff
Navy Federal Credit Union (“Plaintiff”) requests entry of default judgment
against Defendant Artium AME, Inc. Plaintiff seeks judgment in the total amount
of $59,530.19, comprising $56,977.14 in damages, $2,029.54 in attorney’s fees,
and $523.51 in costs.
On
June 17, 2024, the Court issued an Order on Plaintiff’s request for default
judgment, providing, inter alia, as follows: 
 
“The Court notes a few
defects with the submitted default judgment package. 
 
First, on December 1, 2023,
Plaintiff filed a proof of service indicating that the summons and Complaint
were personally served on “Atrium AME Inc” on November 30, 2023.
(Emphasis added.) However, Plaintiff seeks entry of default judgment against “Artium
AME, Inc.” and the defendant named in the Complaint is “Artium AME, Inc.”
(Emphasis added.) Thus, the spelling of the defendant’s name on the proof of
service appears to be incorrect. 
 
Second, this is an action on a loan
contract (Compl., pp. 3-4), but Plaintiff has not provided the original of the note.
In lieu of the original, Plaintiff may also provide a declaration explaining
loss or unavailability, along with a proposed order to accept a copy in lieu of
the original. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1806; Kahn v. Lasorda's Dugout, Inc. (2003) 109 Cal.App.4th 1118,
1124.).” (June 17, 2024 Order at pp. 1:18-2:2.) 
The Court’s June 17, 2024 minute
order in this action provides, inter alia, that “[t]he Court continues
the hearing on the request for Default Judgment as to defendant Atrium Ame
Inc., as follows: Plaintiff to file and serve the corrected Proof of Service
and the Declaration and Order regarding the unavailability of the note by July
17, 2024. It appears that Plaintiff filed the corrected Proof of Service but
the default clerk rejected it. It appears that the default clerk may have made
an error based upon the name in the docket for this file which identifies the
defendant as Atrium AME, Inc. The Court accepts the corrected Proof of Service.

However, it does not appear that
Plaintiff filed the declaration and proposed order regarding the original of
the note. The Court will discuss these issues with counsel at the hearing.
