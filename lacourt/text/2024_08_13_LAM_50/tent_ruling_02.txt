[TENTATIVE] ORDER
  RE:
 
PLAINTIFF’S REQUEST FOR DEFAULT JUDGMENT  




            
Plaintiff
Danielle Hines (“Plaintiff’) appears to request entry of default judgment
against Defendant Cameron Moore, dba Beyond Vegan Eats, dba Juice Bae. The July
3, 2024 “Declaration of Danielle Hines in Support of Request for Court
Judgment” asserts, inter alia, that “[i]n total, Defendant owes me
$139,250.00 in damages.” 
The
Court notes a number of defects with the submitted default judgment package.
First, Plaintiff did not
file any request for court judgment (Form CIV-100). Pursuant to California Rules of Court, rule 3.1800,
subdivision (a), “[a] party seeking a default
judgment on declarations must use mandatory Request for Entry of Default (Application to Enter Default) (form
CIV-100)…” 
Second,
Plaintiff has not filed a proposed judgment on Form JUD-100. A party seeking a
default judgment¿must file “[a] proposed form of judgment.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1800, subd. (a)(6).) 
 
 Third, as discussed,
Plaintiff did not file any request for court judgment on Form CIV-100. Thus,
Plaintiff also did not file any declaration of nonmilitary status. Pursuant to California Rules of Court, rule 3.1800,
subdivision (a)(5), the request for court judgment must include “[a]
declaration of nonmilitary status for each defendant against whom judgment is
sought.”
Fourth, Plaintiff’s
operative First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) names Does 1 through 25 as
defendants. Plaintiff has not sought to dismiss the doe defendants. A party
seeking a default judgment must file “[a] dismissal of all parties against whom
judgment is not sought or an application for separate judgment against
specified parties under Code of Civil Procedure
section 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment…” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1800, subd.
(a)(7).)¿ 
Fifth, in her supporting
declaration, Plaintiff states that “[b]etween January 2020 and April 2020, I
was not paid any wages owed. As a result, Defendant owes me $8,500 ($500 per
week for 17 weeks).” (Hines Decl., ¶ 21.) However, this appears to be
inconsistent with the allegations of the FAC. In the FAC, Plaintiff alleges
that “[f]rom on or about January 6, 2020 to in or about mid-April 2020, Mr.
Moore and Beyond Vegan paid Ms. Hines a flat rate of $500.00 per week.” (FAC, ¶
7.) The Court notes that Code of Civil Procedure
section 580, subdivision (a) “limits a trial court’s jurisdiction to grant
relief on a default judgment to the amount stated in the complaint.” (Dhawan v. Biring (2015) 241 Cal.App.4th 963, 968.) “[I]n all default
judgments the demand sets a ceiling on recovery.” (Finney
v. Gomez (2003) 111 Cal.App.4th
527, 534.)
Sixth,
Plaintiff seeks overtime wages in the amount of $6,375.00 for the period of
January 2020-April 2020, and overtime wages in the amount of $16,875.00 for the
period of April 2020 through November 2020. (Hines Decl., ¶¶ 17-18.) Plaintiff
seeks overtime wages for 20 hours per week for these periods. (Ibid.) However, it is unclear how Plaintiff
calculated this amount. In addition, it appears that Plaintiff may have
included the overtime wages for April 2020 twice in her calculations. (See
Hines Decl., ¶¶ 17-18.) 
Seventh, it appears
Plaintiff also requests damages for missed meal and rest breaks twice for April
2020. (Hines Decl., ¶¶ 19-20.)
Eighth,
Plaintiff states that “[a]s a result of Defendant’s conduct, I have suffered
and continue to suffer emotional distress in the form of anxiety and
depression. The amount of my noneconomic damages is $50,000.00.” (Hines Decl.,
¶ 25.) The Court does not find that Plaintiff’s supporting declaration provides
sufficient facts supporting the emotional distress damages requested.
Ninth,
Plaintiff states that “[i]n January 2022, I mitigated my damages by finding
full time employment at $23 per hour. Before mitigation, the amount of wages I
would have made would be approximately $41,250.00 ($750 per week x 55 weeks).”
(Hines Decl., ¶ 24.) However, Plaintiff appears to seek the $41,250.00 in
damages, as Plaintiff seeks a total of $139,250.00 in damages. (Hines Decl., ¶¶
24, 26.) It is unclear on what basis Plaintiff seeks the requested $41,250.00
in damages. (Hines Decl., ¶ 24.) As discussed, Plaintiff alleges in the FAC
that “[f]rom on or about January 6, 2020 to in or about mid-April 2020, Mr.
Moore and Beyond Vegan paid Ms. Hines a flat rate of $500.00 per week.” (FAC, ¶
7.) In addition, Plaintiff alleges that “[o]n or around the end of April 2020,
Mr. Moore started to pay Ms. Hines $750.00 per week.” (FAC, ¶ 10.) 
Based
on the foregoing, the Court denies Plaintiff’s apparent request for default
judgment without prejudice. The Court will discuss with Plaintiff a schedule
for resubmission of the default judgment package.
