And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is denying the plaintiff's request for default judgment against the defendant without prejudice. The judge notes several defects with the plaintiff's default judgment package, including the failure to file a request for court judgment, a proposed judgment, and a declaration of nonmilitary status. The judge also finds that the plaintiff's supporting declaration lacks sufficient evidence to support the requested emotional distress damages. Additionally, the judge questions the plaintiff's calculations for overtime wages and the request for damages for missed meal and rest breaks. The judge orders the plaintiff to resubmit the default judgment package and will discuss a schedule for resubmission with the plaintiff.
