ORDER RE:  
 
PLAINTIFF’S REQUESTS FOR DEFAULT JUDGMENT
 




            Plaintiff Immigrant
Rights Defense Council, LLC (“Plaintiff”) requests entry of default judgment
against Defendants Edmund Robert Soracco and Americas Legal Immigration
Foundation (jointly, “Defendants”). Plaintiff seeks judgment in the total
amount of $32,440.58, comprising $1,165.58 in costs and $31,275.00 in
attorney’s fees. Plaintiff also seeks a judgment that “Defendants are
permanently enjoined from further violating the Immigration Consults Act (ICA)
and engaging in the business of an immigration consultant. Defendants’
liability for attorney’s fees and costs is joint and several.” (See
proposed judgment, Item 8.) 
The Court notes that Item 8 of the proposed judgment (Form JUD-100) references
an “Immigration Consults Act.” It appears this is a typo. The Court will revise
the form to refer to the “Immigration Consultants Act.” 
Plaintiff seeks a judgment providing, inter
alia, that “Defendants are permanently enjoined from further violating the
Immigration Consults [sic] Act (ICA) and engaging in the business of an
immigration consultant…” In support of this request for relief, Plaintiff’s
counsel’s declaration and Plaintiff’s brief in support of the request cite to Business and
Professions Code, section 22446.5, subdivision (b), which provides that “[a]ny other
party who, upon information and belief, claims a violation of this chapter has
been committed by an immigration consultant may bring a civil action for
injunctive relief on behalf of the general public and, upon prevailing, shall
recover reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs.” In the Court’s June 10, 2024
Order on Plaintiff’s previous request for default judgment, the Court cited Business
and Professions Code section 22446.5, subdivision (b),
and noted that “Plaintiff does not appear to provide any further legal
authority specifically supporting its request for an injunction prohibiting Defendants
from engaging in the business of an immigration consultant.” (June 10, 2024
Order at p. 2:7-9.) In its brief in support of the instant request, Plaintiff
states, inter alia, that “[t]he undersigned is not aware of any legal
authorities or even legislative materials that explain how courts are to
interpret Business & Professions Code section
22446.5 subd. (b).” (Plaintiff’s Brief at p. 4:10-11.) 
             In Kim v.
Westmoore Partners, Inc. (2011) 201 Cal.App.4th
267, 287, discussed in the Court’s June 10, 2024 Order, the Court of
Appeal noted that if the relief requested in the complaint consists of  “either nonmonetary relief, or monetary
relief in amounts which require either an accounting, additional evidence, or
the exercise of judgment to ascertain (such as emotional distress damages, pain
and suffering, or punitive damages), the plaintiff must request entry of
judgment by the court… (Internal quotations omitted, emphasis in original,
underline added.) In this case, the specific violations of the ICA by Defendants
were identified in the Complaint and those violations have been deemed admitted
by virtue of the default that was entered. Those violations justify the injunction
requested, namely, permanently enjoining Defendants from “engaging in the
business of an immigration consultant.”

Based on the foregoing, the Court grants Plaintiff’s request for entry
of default judgment. The Court has signed the Judgment with the one correction
noted above. No appearance at the hearing is required.
