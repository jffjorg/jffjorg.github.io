ORDER RE: 
 
DEFENDANTS’
  MOTION FOR SUMMARY ADJUDICATION
 



 
The motion for summary adjudication
brought by Defendants Peter Georges, Rodini Park, LP, Rodini Park Playa Vista,
LLC, Tzatziki, LLC, Willcore Corporation, Hash Restaurant, and Big Fat Pita
(collectively, “Defendants”) is continued as set forth below. 
The parties have
interposed 40 evidentiary objections. Due to the voluminous number of objections, the hearing on the
motion will be continued to a date that will be set at the Hearing on
Objections discussed below.
The Court orders the parties to meet and confer by telephone or in
person in a serious and good faith effort to resolve and eliminate the
objections. The only objections that should remain are those that pertain to material evidence regarding material issues. Keeping the
rules of evidence in mind, the parties should be able to reduce the objections
to just a few. If any material objections
remain unresolved, the parties are to set them forth in a joint statement with
the text, the objection, and the argument of each side in favor of their
respective positions regarding the remaining material objections, along with a
space for a ruling.
The joint statement
must be filed on or before _______ with a
courtesy copy delivered to Department 50. The Court will review any
remaining objections with the parties at a hearing on _______________ at 2:00 p.m. (the “Hearing on Objections”). The
date for the hearing on the motion will be set at the Hearing on Objections.
If necessary, based upon the resolutions reached during the meet and
confer process and/or at the Hearing on Objections, the parties may
respectively file and serve revised briefing and evidence. The revised evidence
may eliminate objectionable material; however, no new evidence or new argument is to be submitted unless it is as a
result of compromises reached during the meet and confer process. In
the event that revised briefing and evidence is necessary, the Court will
discuss with the parties a briefing schedule for the revised briefing at the
Hearing on Objections.  
Defendants are ordered
to give notice of this Order.
