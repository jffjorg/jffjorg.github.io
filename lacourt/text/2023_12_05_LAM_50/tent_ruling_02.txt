Background
Plaintiff
John Chou (“Plaintiff”) filed this action on October 20, 2021 against
Defendants Air Tiger Express (USA) Inc. (“ATE”) and Matthew Tran (jointly,
“Defendants”). The Complaint alleges causes of action for (1) discrimination on
the basis of age, (2) harassment, (3) retaliation, (4) failure to prevent
discrimination, harassment, or retaliation, and (5) wrongful termination in
violation of public policy. 
In the Complaint, Plaintiff alleges that he
“was employed by ATE for approximately seventeen years, beginning in or around
April 23, 2003, as an Operations Clerk. Plaintiff worked for ATE until his
unlawful termination on March 31, 2020.” (Compl., ¶ 14.) “In or about March of 2019, Stehanie Hang was
promoted to Branch Manager and became Plaintiffs supervisor. Stephanie Hang
moved Plaintiff to the Customer Service Department.” (Compl., ¶ 21.) “Angelita
Gavino, Plaintiff’s co-worker, was also assigned to the Customer Service
Department.” (Compl., ¶ 21.) “In or about May 2019, Plaintiff’s co-worker
Angelita Gavino asked Stephanie Hang to go out to lunch with both her and Matt Tran.” (Compl., ¶ 22.) Plaintiff
alleges that “during the lunch meeting, Matt Tran stated ‘those idiot old men
upstairs from accounting are pissing me off.’ Matt Tran was referring to
Plaintiff and other personnel over the age of 40 years. Matt Tran further
stated to Stephanie Hang that, ‘she should terminate both John Chou and Joseph
because they are both old mother fuckers.’ Matt Tran further stated, ‘If am
ever promoted, I would get rid of all the old people.’” (Compl., ¶ 22.)  
Plaintiff alleges that “[i]n or about November
2019, Matt Tran was promoted to Assistant Manager in Customer Service. Matt
Tran would treat Plaintiff with disdain during their interactions, which
confused Plaintiff as to why. Matt Tran would treat Plaintiff as if he were
incompetent or mimic him as being slow. Tran would stare at Plaintiff and would
otherwise intentionally try to make Plaintiff feel uncomfortable. On several
occasions Angelita Gavino overheard Matt Tran using profanity against Plaintiff
saying, ‘that old motherfucker.’” (Compl., ¶ 24.) Plaintiff alleges that “[o]n or about February
25, 2019, Plaintiff complained to his supervisor Stephanie Hang about Matt
Tran’s discriminatory comments regarding Plaintiffs age.” (Compl., ¶ 26.)  
Plaintiff alleges that “[o]n or about March
20, 2020, the governor of the State of California announced a mandatory state
lockdown.” (Compl., ¶ 27.) “Defendants advised all employees to work from
home and take the company laptop home with them. Defendants then sent out an
email to all employees announcing that all employees would be getting an 8%
payroll deduction. However, neither Plaintiff nor the older employees received
a copy of this email and were not offered a payroll reduction.” (Compl., ¶ 28.) Plaintiff
alleges that [o]n or about March 23, 2020, Plaintiff (age 63) was informed that
he and Angelita Gavino (age 56 with a disability), and ‘Patty’ (age 48 with a
disability) were all going to be terminated from their jobs.” (Compl., ¶ 29.)  
Plaintiff’s counsel states
that “[o]n March 27, 2023, Plaintiff served Special Interrogatories, Set
Three.” (Denis Decl., ¶ 2.) On June 2, 2023, ATE served responses to
Plaintiff’s Special Interrogatories, Set Three. (Denis Decl., ¶ 2, Ex. A.)
Plaintiff’s counsel and ATE’s counsel engaged in meet and confer correspondence
concerning the asserted deficiencies in ATE’s responses. (Denis Decl., ¶¶ 3-4.)

On
August 10, 2023, the parties participated in an Informal Discovery Conference
(“IDC”). The Court’s August 10, 2023 minute order provides, inter alia,
that “[p]arties fulfilled their IDC requirement regarding the
issues set forth in their IDC Statements filed July 24, 2023 and August 1,
2023.” The Court notes that Plaintiff filed an IDC Statement on July 25, 2023
for the IDC scheduled for August 10, 2023, which provides, inter alia,
that “Plaintiff has filed his MTC related to Plaintiff’s Special Interrogatories
Set Three, specifically, to Numbers 77-83, 90, 94, 96, 101-102, 106-113.” 
Plaintiff
now moves for an order requiring ATE to serve further responses
to Plaintiff’s Special Interrogatories, Set Three, Numbers 94, 96, 101-102,
106, and 108-113. Plaintiff also seeks monetary sanctions against ATE and its
attorneys. ATE opposes. 
Legal Standard
Each answer to an interrogatory must be as “complete and
straightforward as the information reasonably available to the responding party
permits.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.220, subd. (a).)
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section
2030.300, subdivision (a), “[o]n receipt of a
response to interrogatories, the propounding party may move for an order
compelling a further response if the propounding party deems that any of the
following apply: (1) An answer to a particular interrogatory is evasive or incomplete.
(2) An exercise of the option to produce documents under Section 2030.230 is unwarranted or the required
specification of those documents is inadequate. (3) An objection to an interrogatory is without
merit or too general.” 
Such
a motion must be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (b)(1).) 
Discussion 
As set forth above, Plaintiff moves
for an order requiring ATE to serve further responses to
Plaintiff’s Special Interrogatories, Set Three, Nos. 94, 96, 101, 102, 106, 108,
109, 110, 111, 112, and 113. 
As an initial matter, in the
opposition, ATE provides evidence that on November 16, 2023, ATE served
further responses to Plaintiff’s Special Interrogatories, Set Three. (Watts
Decl., ¶ 11, Ex. H.) These November 16, 2023 responses include further
responses to Special Interrogatories Nos. 94, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, and 113.
(Ibid.) Thus, the Court finds that Plaintiff’s
instant motion is moot as to these special interrogatories. Accordingly, only
Special Interrogatories Nos. 96, 101, 102, and 106 remain at issue. 
Special Interrogatory No. 96 provides, “[p]rovide the name or names of
the person(s) who made the decision to terminate certain ATE employees in
2020?” (Denis Decl., ¶ 2, Ex. A.) ATE’s response indicates, inter alia,
“[s]ubject to and without waiving the foregoing objections, Defendant responds
as follows: Defendant limits its response to the ATE Los Angeles Branch office
in March 2020: Stephanie Hang, Jeff Chow, Rosa Gutierrez, Joseph Yuen and Juan
Herrarte.” (Ibid.) ATE’s objections include,
inter alia, that the interrogatory “is unduly burdensome, harassing and
oppressive,” and “is not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of
admissible evidence…” (Ibid.) 
In his amended separate statement, Plaintiff asserts that
“[d]ecision-makers in any employment case is [sic] always relevant and should
be produced with verified responses. Plaintiff’s theory is that he and others
who were of a certain age and/or disabled or both, were terminated without
being given an opportunity or even being given the information, to accept a
wage reduction [or other accommodation] rather than a final termination…”
(Plaintiff’s Amended Separate Statement at p. 4:7-11.) ATE counters that “[t]his
is precisely what Defendant did – it provided the names of the persons who made
the decision to terminate employees in Defendant’s Los Angeles office at the
time of Plaintiff’s layoff.” (ATE’s Separate Statement at p. 4:14-16.) 
Plaintiff also appears to assert that it is improper for ATE to limit
the response to Special Interrogatory No. 96 to the year 2020, or to the Los
Angeles office. (Plaintiff’s Amended Separate Statement at p. 4:21-23.) ATE counters
that “who was involved at [ATE’s] various other offices or during other
terminations other than the COVID layoff in March 2020 is irrelevant, as well
as being harassing, burdensome and oppressive.” 
(ATE’s Separate Statement at p. 4:18-20.) ATE asserts that “the
interrogatory, read literally, would require Defendant to investigate if any
person in a global corporation was terminated in 2020 at any time for any
reason (whether for cause or not) and then investigate who made that decision.”
(Id. at p. 4:21-23.) The Court agrees that
ATE’s objection to Special Interrogatory No. 96 on the grounds of relevance has
merit. The Court thus denies Plaintiff’s motion as to this request. 
Special Interrogatory No. 101 provides, “[s]tate whether any ATE
employees were terminated in 2021.” (Denis Decl., ¶ 2, Ex. A.) ATE’s response
to this interrogatory consists solely of objections, specifically, that
“Defendant objects to this interrogatory on the grounds and to the extent it is
vague and ambiguous; it is irrelevant, as it seeks information after Plaintiff
was terminated; it is unduly burdensome, harassing and oppressive; it seeks
information that is confidential and protected by an individual’s
constitutional privacy rights under the U.S.
Constitution, Article 1, Section 1 and the California
Constitution, Article 1, Section 1, as well as federal and state statutory
and common law; it is not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of
admissible evidence; it calls for speculation; and it lacks foundation.” (Ibid.) 
In his amended separate statement, Plaintiff asserts that “[w]hat
actions after the layoff is relevant to see the motive of the company…This
interrogatory investigates whether, the company laid off any other employees…” (Plaintiff’s
Amended Separate Statement at p. 5:11-13.) ATE asserts that “this interrogatory
would require [ATE] to review the personnel files of a global corporation with
numerous offices to see if any employee was terminated, with or without cause,
starting almost a year after Plaintiff was laid off. It is irrelevant,
burdensome, harassing and not calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible
evidence.” (ATE’s Separate Statement at p. 6:8-11.) Indeed, Plaintiff does not
appear to articulate why any terminations that took place in 2021 are relevant
to Plaintiff’s claims pertaining to his alleged termination in March 2020.
(Compl., ¶ 14.) Based on the foregoing, the Court finds that there is merit to
ATE’s objections to Special Interrogatory No. 101 on the basis of relevance.
The Court thus denies the motion as to Special Interrogatory No. 101. 
Special Interrogatory No. 102 provides, “[w]ho participated in the
decision as to the ‘company business plan’, as to which employees would be
terminated?” (Denis Decl., ¶ 2, Ex. A.) ATE’s response to this interrogatory
provides, inter alia, “[s]ubject to and without waiving the foregoing
objections, Defendant responds as follows: Defendant limits its response to the
ATE Los Angeles Branch office in March 2020: In response to a plan directed by
David Xiao, President and CEO, Stephanie Hang, Jeff Chow, Rosa Gutierrez,
Joseph Yuen and Juan Herrarte selected various individuals for termination.” (Ibid.) 
In his amended separate statement, Plaintiff argues that “[a] plan to
deal with Covid was implemented with [sic] was supposed to be a salary
reduction and a 15% lay-off across the company. However, the layoffs were at
select places and not ‘across the nation,’ and effected [sic] Long-term
employees…with the company. Plaintiff is investigating who made these ‘business
plans.’…” (Plaintiff’s Amended Separate Statement at p. 6:21-25.) The Court
notes that Plaintiff does not appear to provide any evidence in support of this
assertion. 
Plaintiff also argues in the separate statement as to Special
Interrogatory No. 102 that “the improper objection of defendant also, in
unilaterally limiting the response to 2020, or to the Los Angeles office, also
applies to more than one interrogatory.” (Plaintiff’s Amended Separate
Statement at p. 7:10-11.) ATE argues that “who was involved at Defendant’s
various other offices is irrelevant, as well as being harassing, burdensome and
oppressive. Defendant would also note that this interrogatory seems specifically
to request the identity of participants in the ‘company business plan,’ made in
relation to COVID-19, so the date restriction to March 2020 is called for in
the request, not an improper unilateral restriction.” (ATE’s Separate Statement
at p. 7:12-16.) Plaintiff does not appear to respond to this point in the reply
or articulate why information concerning matters later than 2020 or outside the
Los Angeles Branch office would be relevant as to Special Interrogatory No.
102.  
Based on the foregoing, the Court does not find that Plaintiff has
demonstrated good cause for a further response to Special Interrogatory No.
102, and denies the motion as to this request. 
Special Interrogatory No. 106 provides, “[s]tate the total number of
employees terminated in 2020, nationwide, between March and December 2020.”
(Denis Decl., ¶ 2, Ex. A.) ATE’s response provides, inter alia, “[s]ubject
to and without waiving the foregoing objections, Defendant responds as follows:
Defendant limits its response to March 2020. Pursuant to Cal.
Code of Civ. Proc. § 2030.230, Defendant specifies the following writings
from which the answer may be derived or ascertained: ATE-CHOU 000270, which has
been previously produced…” (Ibid.) ATE’s
objections include that Special Interrogatory No. 106 “is duplicative, as it is
almost an exact duplicate of Special Interrogatory 68…” (Ibid.)

ATE’s counsel indicates that on January 26, 2023, Plaintiff served ATE
with Plaintiff’s Special Interrogatories, Set Two. (Watts Decl., ¶ 8, Ex. E.)
Special Interrogatory No. 68 in Plaintiff’s Special Interrogatories, Set Two
provides, “[s]tate the total number of employees terminated in 2020,
nationwide, from ATE or its affiliates.” (Ibid.)

ATE asserts that “[p]ropounding the exact same interrogatory multiple
times is a violation of Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 2023.010(c)…” (Opp’n at p.
4:17-18.) Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010, subdivision (c) provides that “[m]isuses of the discovery process include, but are not
limited to, the following:…(c) Employing a discovery method in
a manner or to an extent that causes unwarranted annoyance, embarrassment, or
oppression, or undue burden and expense.”

ATE also asserts that “[w]hen
Plaintiff asked identical questions earlier and failed to submit a motion to
compel, he cannot now ask the same question again and file a motion, seeking to
‘reset the clock.’” (Opp’n at p. 4:23-25.) ATE cites to Prof'l Career Colleges, Magna Inst. v. Superior Court (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d
490, 492, where the “[p]laintiff
served a first set of interrogatories on defendant PCC on May 25, 1988.
Included as Interrogatory Number 10 was a demand that PCC state the present or
last known address of each student who was enrolled in the private security
certificate program in the period between July 27, 1987, and October 10, 1987.
On July 14, 1988, PCC served its responses, in which it objected to Number 10…Plaintiff made
no motion to compel further response…” Then, “[o]n
September 1, 1988, plaintiff served a second set of interrogatories on PCC.
Although most of the questions were new, the question set out as Number 10 of
the first set reappeared as Number 14 of second set. The sole change was that
it now sought the name, as well as the address, of each student, and specified
that the persons about whom information was sought had been enrolled in the
private security program ‘at Professional Career Colleges.’” (Ibid.)
“When PCC objected that Number 14 was the same as Number 10 of the first set,
plaintiff finally filed and served a motion to compel further answers…” (Ibid.)

The Court of Appeal in Prof'l Career Colleges found that “[i]n the
context of this case it would be an absurdity to say that a party
who fails to meet the time limits of section 2030
may avoid the consequences of his delay and lack of diligence by propounding
the same question again. Such a construction of the statute would obviously
encourage delay and provide no incentive to attempt to resolve any dispute with
the opposing party. The Legislature has explicitly stated that unless a
party moves to compel further response within 45 days of the unsatisfactory
response, he waives any right to
compel a further response. We hold that this means what it says; plaintiff’s
motion was therefore untimely.” (Prof'l Career Colleges, Magna Inst. v. Superior
Court, supra, 207
Cal.App.3d at p. 494
[emphasis omitted].) The Court notes that Plaintiff does not appear to
address this authority or respond to the foregoing points pertaining to
Special Interrogatory No. 106 in the reply. 
Based on the foregoing, the Court finds that ATE’s objection to
Special Interrogatory No. 106 on the grounds that it is duplicative of Special
Interrogatory No. 68 has merit. The Court thus denies Plaintiff’s motion as to
this request. 
Lastly, Plaintiff states that he “has expended time and effort in
bringing this motion and seeks attorneys’ fees/sanctions in the sum of
$7,860.00.” (Mot. at p. 12:23-25.) In addition, ATE “requests monetary
sanctions against Plaintiff and his counsel in the amount of $9,100.00 to
compensate Defendant for the time and expense associated with preparing this
Opposition and appearing at the hearing.” (Opp’n at p. 14:10-12.) 
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.300, subdivision (d), “[t]he court shall impose a monetary sanction…against any
party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to
compel a further response to interrogatories, unless it finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” The Court finds that
Plaintiff acted with substantial justification in presenting his position, and thus
declines to award sanctions against Plaintiff. The Court also denies
Plaintiff’s request for sanctions.  
            Conclusion                                                                          
Based on the foregoing, the Court denies Plaintiff’s motion to compel
further responses. 
ATE is ordered to give notice of
this Order.
