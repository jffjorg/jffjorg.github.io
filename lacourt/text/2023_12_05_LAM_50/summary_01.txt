Summary:

The Judge, Hon. Rolf M. Treu, has issued a tentative ruling granting the Plaintiff's motion for leave to file a First Amended Complaint. The Plaintiff's original Complaint was filed on July 30, 2021, and alleges causes of action for quiet title, constructive trust, and accounting. The Plaintiff seeks to add new causes of action for tort of deceit and cancellation of instruments, as well as new factual allegations. The Defendant opposes the motion, arguing that the Plaintiff failed to sign his declaration, that the Plaintiff does not provide sufficient information about the changes to the proposed First Amended Complaint, and that the motion is untimely and will prejudice the Defendant. The Court finds that the Plaintiff's motion is timely and that the proposed First Amended Complaint does not contradict the allegations of the original Complaint. The Court grants the Plaintiff's motion and orders the Plaintiff to file and serve the First Amended Complaint within 3 days of the date of the Order.
