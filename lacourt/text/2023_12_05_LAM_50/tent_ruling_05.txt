TENTATIVE RULING
  RE:
 
ORDER TO SHOW
  CAUSE RE PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION



 
Background
Plaintiff Denise Wheeler (“Plaintiff”) filed
this action on September 21, 2023 against Defendant Center Street Lending
Corporation (“Defendant”). The Complaint asserts causes of action for (1) violation
of Civil Code section 2923.55 and (2) violation of Business and Professions Code section 17200 et seq.

In
the Complaint, Plaintiff alleges that at all relevant times, she owned the
property located at 637 E 29th Street, Los Angeles CA 90011. (Compl., ¶ 7.) Plaintiff
alleges that “[i]n mid-2015, a fire virtually destroyed most of the Property
and left it in severe disrepair.” (Compl., ¶ 9.) Plaintiff alleges that “[o]n
August 20, 2015, Plaintiff received a refinance from [Defendant] in the amount
of $350,000.00.” (Compl., ¶ 10.) “In the loan origination process, Plaintiff
was told by [Defendant] to use a different address for her personal residence.
Plaintiff alleges that [Defendant] knew Plaintiff’s only residence was the
property but was told to use a different address to fund the loan.” (Compl., ¶
11.) “In February 2016, the loan came due, and Plaintiff was unable to pay the
balloon amount.” (Compl., ¶ 13.) “In September 2017, [Defendant] filed a Notice
of Default. On December 26, 2017, [Defendant] filed a Notice of Trustee’s
Sale.” (Compl., ¶ 14.) 
Plaintiff
further alleges that “[o]n January 18, 2018, Plaintiff filed for Chapter 11
Bankruptcy. Plaintiff made payments throughout the bankruptcy until early 2023
when [Defendant] filed a Motion for Relief from stay.” (Compl., ¶ 15.) “The
Bankruptcy court granted the Motion for Relief from stay and [Defendant]
recorded a new Notice of Default on May 31, 2023.” (Compl., ¶ 16.) Plaintiff
alleges that “[o]n September 5, 2023, Defendant recorded a Notice of Trustee’s
Sale and set the property for auction on October 3, 2023. Despite the fact that
Defendant failed to contact Plaintiff to ‘assess her financial situation and
explore options to avoid foreclosure’ as required by Civil
Code 2923.55, Defendant intends to proceed [sic] the sale...” (Compl., ¶
18.) 
            On September 28, 2023, the Court
issued a minute order providing, inter alia, that “[t]he…EX-PARTE
APPLICATION FOR A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER TO RESTRAIN RECORDING OF A NOTICE
OF TRUSTEES SALE filed by Denise Wheeler, an individual on 09/27/2023 is
Granted.” 
Per
the Court’s September 28, 2023 Order, the Temporary Restraining Order provides
that “Pending hearing on the below Order to Show Cause, Defendants, and their
employees, agents and/or any other person or entity acting with them or on
their behalf are restrained and enjoined from conducting a Trustee’s Sale for
the property located at 637 E 29th Street, Los Angeles CA 90011.” The September
28, 2023 Order further provides, “TO DEFENDANTS AND THEIR COUNSEL OF RECORD,
You are ordered to appear on 10-19-23…at 2 pm…in Dept 50 of this Court…to show
cause as to why a preliminary injunction should not be issued enjoining
conducting of a Trustee’s Sale for the property located at 637 E 29th Street,
Los Angeles CA 90011.”
On
September 29, 2023, Plaintiff filed a “Notice of Order to Show Cause Re
Preliminary Injunction” providing, inter alia, that “Plaintiff’s
ex-parte application shall constitute the moving papers.” On October 5, 2023,
Defendant filed an “Opposition to Plaintiff’s Motion for Preliminary
Injunction.”  
On
October 19, 2023, the Court held a hearing on the “Order to Show Cause Re: Re: [sic]
Temporary Restraining Order to Restrain Recording of a Notice of Trustees
Sale.” (See October 19, 2023 Minute Order.) In the October 19, 2023
minute order, the Court noted, inter alia, that “Plaintiff provides new
evidence with the reply in support of the assertion that she ‘lives in the
property,’ which ‘entitles her to HBOR protections.’…The Court will provide
Defendant with an opportunity to address the evidence provided for the first
time in connection with Plaintiff’s reply.” (October 19, 2023 Minute Order, p.
8.) The Court continued the hearing on the Order to Show Cause Re Preliminary
Injunction to December 5, 2023, and noted that “Defendant may file and serve by
November 30, 2023 at 5:00 p.m. a surreply addressing the evidence submitted by
Plaintiff in connection with her reply filed on October 12, 2023.” (Ibid.) 
On
November 30, 2023, Defendant filed a “Surreply in Support of Defendant’s
Opposition to Plaintiff’s Motion for Preliminary Injunction.” 
Requests for Judicial Notice 
            The Court grants Defendant’s request
for judicial notice filed in support of the opposition as to Exhibits A and B
attached to the request. The Court also grants Defendant’s request for judicial
notice filed in support of Defendant’s surreply. 
Discussion
“In determining whether to issue a preliminary
injunction, the trial court considers two related factors: (1) the likelihood
that the plaintiff will prevail on the merits of its case at trial, and (2) the
interim harm that the plaintiff is likely to sustain if the injunction is
denied as compared to the harm that the defendant is likely to suffer if the
court grants a preliminary injunction.” (Donahue
Schriber Realty Group, Inc. v. Nu Creation Outreach (2014) 232
Cal.App.4th 1171, 1177 [internal quotations omitted].) “[A]n
order granting or denying a preliminary injunction does not amount to an
adjudication of the ultimate rights in controversy. Its purpose is to preserve
the status quo until the merits of the action can be determined.” (White v. Davis (2003) 30
Cal.4th 528, 554 [emphasis omitted].) “The trial court’s
determination must be guided by a ‘mix’ of the potential-merit and interim-harm
factors; the greater the plaintiff’s showing on one, the less must be shown on
the other….” (Church of Christ
in Hollywood v. Superior Court (2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 1244, 1251-1252.) “The
ultimate goal of any test to be used in deciding whether a preliminary
injunction should issue is to minimize the harm which an erroneous interim
decision may cause.” (White v. Davis, supra, 30 Cal.4th at p. 554 [emphasis omitted].) The burden is on
the party seeking injunctive relief to show all elements necessary to support
issuance of a preliminary injunction. (O'Connell v.
Superior Court (2006) 141 Cal.App.4th 1452, 1481.)
A.    Likelihood of Success on the Merits
A preliminary injunction must not issue unless
it is “reasonably probable that the moving party will prevail on the merits.” (San
Francisco Newspaper Printing Co. v. Superior Court (Miller) (1985) 170
Cal.App.3d 438, 442.) The “likelihood of success on the merits and the balance-of-harms
analysis are ordinarily ‘interrelated’ factors in the decision whether to issue
a preliminary injunction.” (White v. Davis, supra,
30 Cal.4th at p. 561.) “The presence or absence of each factor is usually a
matter of degree, and if the party seeking the injunction can make a
sufficiently strong showing of likelihood of success on the merits, the trial
court has discretion to issue the injunction notwithstanding that party’s
inability to show that the balance of harms tips in his favor.” (Ibid.) However, this does not mean that a
trial court may grant a preliminary injunction on the basis of the
likelihood-of-success factor alone when the balance of hardships dramatically
favors denial of a preliminary injunction. (Ibid.)  
As set forth above, Plaintiff alleges causes
of action for violation of Civil Code section 2923.55
and violation
of Business and Professions Code section 17200 et
seq. Plaintiff asserts that she is likely to succeed on the merits of
her claims. 
As
to the first cause of action, Civil Code section 2923.55, subdivision (a) provides that “[a] mortgage servicer, mortgagee, trustee,
beneficiary, or authorized agent shall not record a notice of default pursuant
to Section 2924 until all of the
following: (1) The mortgage servicer has satisfied the requirements of
paragraph (1) of subdivision (b). (2) Either 30 days after initial contact is made as required by
paragraph (2) of subdivision (b) or 30 days after satisfying the due diligence
requirements as described in subdivision (f). (3) The mortgage servicer complies with subdivision (c) of Section 2923.6, if the borrower has provided a
complete application as defined in subdivision (h) of Section 2923.6.” 
Civil Code section 2923.55, subdivision
(b)(2) provides as follows: 
 
“A mortgage servicer shall
contact the borrower in person or by telephone in order to assess the
borrower’s financial situation and explore options for the borrower to avoid
foreclosure. During the initial contact, the mortgage servicer shall advise the
borrower that he or she has the right to request a subsequent meeting and, if
requested, the mortgage servicer shall schedule the meeting to occur within 14
days. The assessment of the borrower’s financial situation and discussion of
options may occur during the first contact, or at the subsequent meeting
scheduled for that purpose. In either case, the borrower shall be provided the
toll-free telephone number made available by the United States Department of
Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to find a HUD-certified housing counseling
agency. Any meeting may occur telephonically.” 
In addition, Civil Code
section 2923.55, subdivision (c) provides that “[a] notice of default
recorded pursuant to Section 2924 shall
include a declaration that the mortgage servicer has contacted the borrower,
has tried with due diligence to contact the borrower as required by this
section, or that no contact was required because the individual did not meet
the definition of ‘borrower’ pursuant to subdivision (c) of Section 2920.5.” 
In the first cause of action, Plaintiff alleges
that Defendant did not fulfil the requirements of Civil Code section 2923.55, subdivision (b)(2) or Civil Code section 2923.55,
subdivision (c). (Compl., ¶ 21.) More specifically, Plaintiff alleges that
“Defendant
recorded the NOD without sending the NOD to Plaintiff or contacting Plaintiff
‘in person or by telephone’ to assess her financial situations [sic] and
explore options to avoid foreclosure. Additionally, the Notice of Trustee’s
Sale (‘NOTS’) also fails to include the above required declaration and is not
appropriately executed…” (Compl., ¶
22.) Plaintiff alleges that “Defendant also failed to include a
declaration that the mortgage servicer has contacted the borrower…” (Compl., ¶
24.) 
In addition, in the second cause of action for
violation of Business and Professions Code section
17200 et seq., Plaintiff alleges that “Defendant’s
violation of California Civil Code § 2923.55
constitute [sic] unfair business practices in violation of California Business and Professions Code § 17200 et seq.”
(Compl., ¶ 29.) The Court notes that “[t]he
UCL is codified in Business and Professions Code
section 17200 et seq. The UCL prohibits any unlawful, unfair or
fraudulent business act or practice.” (Berryman
v. Merit Property Management, Inc. (2007)
152 Cal.App.4th 1544, 1554 [internal quotations omitted].) 
In
her declaration in support of the motion, Plaintiff states that “I am, and at
all relevant times mentioned herein was, a resident of LOS ANGELES County,
California, and am the rightful and lawful owner of real property commonly
known as 637 E 29th Street, Los Angeles CA 90011…The property is my personal and
principal residence.” (Wheeler Decl., ¶ 2.) Plaintiff indicates that on “August
20, 2015, [she] received a refinance from [Defendant] in the amount of
$350,000.00.” (Wheeler Decl., ¶ 5.) “In February 2016, the loan came due, and
[Plaintiff] was unable to pay the balloon amount.” (Wheeler Decl., ¶ 8.) 
Plaintiff
further states that in September 2017, Defendant filed a Notice of Default, and
on December 26, 2017, Defendant filed a Notice of Trustee’s Sale. (Wheeler
Decl., ¶ 9.) On January 18, 2018, Plaintiff filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy.
(Wheeler Decl., ¶ 10.) The Bankruptcy court then granted Defendant’s Motion for
Relief from stay, and Defendant recorded a new Notice of Default on May 31,
2023. (Wheeler Decl., ¶ 11, Ex. A.) The Notice of Default attached as Exhibit
“A” to Plaintiff’s declaration includes a document titled “Beneficiary
Declaration of Compliance with (or Exception From) Civil
Code Section 2923.5 and Authorization of Agent (For Notice of Default),”
which states, inter alia, that “[t]he provisions of Civil Code section 2923.5 do not apply, because [X]
the property is NOT THE BORROWER’S PRINCIPAL RESIDENCE…” (Wheeler Decl., ¶ 11,
Ex. A.) Plaintiff states in her declaration that “I further allege that
[Defendant] is aware I live, and has [sic] always lived, in the Property
because representatives frequently told me, ‘We are looking into programs
available because you live in the property, but they are not yet available for
participation with our company.’” (Wheeler Decl., ¶ 12.) 
 Plaintiff states that “[o]n September 5, 2023,
Defendant recorded a Notice of Trustee’s Sale and set the property for auction
on October 3, 2023.” (Wheeler Decl., ¶ 13.) Plaintiff asserts in her
declaration that “[d]espite the fact that Defendant failed to contact me to
‘assess my financial situation and explore options to avoid foreclosure’ as
required by Civil Code 2923.55, Defendant intends
to proceed the sale and continue pretending it does not need to comply with Civil Code 2923.55.” (Wheeler Decl., ¶ 13.) 
In
the opposition, Defendant asserts that Plaintiff is unlikely to prevail on the
merits. More specifically, Defendant asserts that “Plaintiff cannot plead or
prove a violation of Civil Code section 2923.55
when the subject loan is a business purpose loan and the property is not
owner-occupied.” (Opp’n at p. 3:3-6.) In addition, Defendant asserts that “Plaintiff’s claim for Unfair
Business Practices fails with the other causes of action.” (Opp’n at p. 4:3.) 
Defendant
cites to Civil Code section 2923.55, subdivision (h), which provides that “[t]his section shall apply only to
mortgages or deeds of trust described in Section
2924.15.” 
Pursuant to Civil Code section 2924.15, subdivision (a), “[u]nless otherwise provided, paragraph (5) of
subdivision (a) of Section 2924 and Sections
2923.5, 2923.55, 2923.6, 2923.7, 2924.9, 
2924.10, 2924.11, and 2924.18 shall apply only
to a first lien mortgage or deed of trust that meets either of the following
conditions: (1) (A) The first lien mortgage or deed of trust is secured by
owner-occupied residential real property containing no more than four dwelling
units. (B) For purposes of this paragraph, ‘owner-occupied’ means that
the property is the principal residence of the borrower and is security for a
loan made for personal, family, or household purposes.”
            Defendant asserts that here, “Plaintiff made
numerous representations to Defendant, and to the Bankruptcy Court, that the
Property was an income property and that she did not reside there.” (Opp’n at
p. 3:13-14.) Defendant submits the Declaration of Luis Montero, an “Authorized
Agent” for Defendant. (Montero Decl., ¶ 1.) Mr. Montero states that
“Defendant’s business records referenced above reflect that on or about July
22, 2015, Plaintiff prepared a loan application with Paradyme Investment
Funding (‘Paradyme’) in order for Paradyme to act as a broker for origination
of a loan from Defendant.” (Montero Decl., ¶ 4.) Mr. Montero asserts that because
“Plaintiffs loan originated by a through a [sic] loan broker, Paradyme,” “Defendant
would not have been involved with or able to advise Plaintiff in the filling
out of loan documents, including any alleged advice to perjure herself.”
(Montero Decl., ¶ 9.) 
Mr.
Montero further indicates that “on or about August 10, 2015, Plaintiff obtained
the Loan from Defendant in the original amount of $350,000. Repayment of the
Loan was secured by a Deed of Trust, Security Agreement and Fixture Filing
(with Assignment of Rents and Leases) (the ‘Deed of Trust’) against the
Property, which was recorded on August 20, 2015…” (Montero Decl., ¶ 5, Ex. 2.)
Defendant notes that the Deed of Trust states that “[e]ach of the following
shall be considered an event of default of this Deed: a. Any Borrower or
Guarantor occupying 637 East 29th Street, Los Angeles, CA 90011 as their
residence…” (Montero Decl., ¶ 5, Ex. 2, p. 3.) Defendant states that it “does
not offer loans for primary residences and never has. Further, Defendant has no
plans to offer loans for primary residences.” (Montero Decl., ¶ 8.) 
            In addition, Mr. Montero attaches as
Exhibit 3 to his declaration a “Borrower Certification of Business Purpose of
Loan and Use of Loan Proceeds” which concerns the “Property Address: 637 East
29th Street, Los Angeles, CA 90011.” (Montero Decl., ¶ 6, Ex. 3.) This document
states, inter alia, that “I, Denise L. Wheeler (“Borrower”), certify
that I (we) am (are) applying for a loan for BUSINESS PURPOSES ONLY.” (Ibid.) This certification document further
provides that “Borrower represents and warrants to Lender the preceding and
understands Lender would not make a loan to Borrower if any of these statements
proved incorrect: a) This loan is a commercial loan for business purposes only;
and b) Borrower does not occupy subject property as their primary residence and
does not intend to occupy the subject property as their primary residence; and
c) Borrower is not acquiring the subject property as a second home and does not
intend to occupy the subject property as their second home…” (Ibid.) 
Defendant
also asserts that on or about July 30, 2015, Plaintiff signed a letter stating,
inter alia, that “I leave [sic] in the city of Culver City because of
the better environment and schools in the area. The duplex that burned down
usually generates me over $5200 in rents per month.” (Montero Decl., ¶ 7, Ex.
4.) 
In
the reply, Plaintiff does not appear to address the foregoing evidence. However,
Plaintiff asserts that she “lives in the property,” which “entitles her to HBOR
protections.” (Reply at p. 3:14-15.) Plaintiff states that she “attests and
provides evidence that she lived in the Property for decades, but most
relevantly as of May 31, 2023, when Defendant recorded the operative Notice of
Default.” (Reply at p. 3:15-16.) In support of this assertion, Plaintiff cites
to the “Wheeler Dec., generally.” (Reply at p. 3:16-17.) As set forth above, in
her declaration in support of the motion, Plaintiff states that “I am, and at
all relevant times mentioned herein was, a resident of LOS ANGELES County,
California, and am the rightful and lawful owner of real property commonly
known as 637 E 29th Street, Los Angeles CA 90011…The property is my personal
and principal residence.” (Wheeler Decl., ¶ 2.) 
Plaintiff
also submits a declaration in support of the reply, which provides that “I have
lived at 637 E 29th Street, Los Angeles CA 90011 for over two decades.”
(Wheeler Reply Decl., ¶ 2.) Plaintiff states in her declaration in support of
the reply that “I receive mail at the property and declare it as my personal
residence to all applicable government agencies, including the IRS, DMV, County
of Los Angeles, and Social Security Office of Administration. I have raised all
my children at the Property as well. Attached to this declaration is
documentation proving I live at the Property for all relevant times mentioned
in this suit.” (Wheeler Reply Decl., ¶ 3, Ex. A.) Plaintiff also asserts that
Defendant “knew and knows I live at the Property. Center Street sends mail
addressed to me at the property (‘Exhibit B’.) In addition, I have had several
conversations with [Defendant] over the phone in which they acknowledged I
lived at the property.” (Wheeler Reply Decl., ¶ 5, Ex. B.) 
In
the surreply, Defendant notes that “Plaintiff’s reply provides letters from
Defendant regarding the Property dated April 2016 and May 2016. These documents
are irrelevant to show that at the time the Notice of Default was issued on May
31, 2023 (Complaint, Ex. A.), the Property was her principal residence.”
(Surreply at p. 3:19-21.) Defendant also notes that “Plaintiff’s declaration
provides no letters or evidence showing that in April 2023 or May 2023 she was
living at the Property.” (Surreply at p. 5:22-23.) Defendant notes that the
letters attached to Plaintiff’s reply declaration (other than the 2016 letters
from Defendant) post-date May 2023. (Wheeler Reply Decl., ¶ 3, Ex. A.) The
letters include, inter alia, a “Social Security Administration Benefit
Verification Letter” that appears to be dated September 21, 2023; a document
from “Mission Lane” that lists a “Statement Billing Period” of August 24, 2023
– September 23, 2023; a document titled “State of California Direct Deposit
Advice” that lists the date September 26, 2023; a Los Angeles Department of
Water & Power bill with a notice date of September 21, 2023; and a bill
with an invoice date of August 20, 2023. (Ibid.)

In
the surreply, Defendant also asserts that “Plaintiff’s Reply provides a series
of documents to attempt substantiate the Property as her principal residence,
however Plaintiff’s own bankruptcy statements and recorded documents show that
this residence was not her principal place of residence and instead was a
rental property used for income purposes only.” (Surreply at p. 2:24-27.) 
As
discussed above, Defendant provides evidence of a “Voluntary Petition for
Individuals Filing for Bankruptcy” filed on January 18, 2018 by Plaintiff.
(Defendant’s RJN, Ex. A.) The Petition lists “1191 1/2 West 38th Street Los
Angeles, CA 90037” after “Where you live.” (Defendant’s RJN, Ex. A, p. 2.)  
Defendant
also notes that Plaintiff attaches to her reply declaration a driver’s license
that lists an issue date of October 6, 2020. (Wheeler Reply Decl., ¶ 3, Ex. A.)
The driver’s license lists the address “637 E 29th St Los Angeles, CA 90011,”
the address of the subject property at issue. (Compl., ¶ 1; Wheeler Reply Decl.,
¶ 3, Ex. A.) Defendant asserts that Plaintiff’s driver’s license conflicts with
her bankruptcy filings. Defendant indicates that on October 23, 2020, Plaintiff
filed a “Debtor’s Post Confirmation Status Conference Report No. 2” in the U.S.
Bankruptcy Court for the Central District of California in the matter In re:
Denise Latrice Wheeler, Case No. 2:18-bk-10597. (Defendant’s Surreply RJN,
Ex. H.) Defendant notes that the proof of service attached to this document
states, inter alia, “Debtor: Denise Latrice Wheeler 1191 1/2 West
38th Street Los Angeles, CA 90037.” (Ibid.,
emphasis added.) 
In
addition, Defendant indicates that on May 23, 2023, a “Declaration of Lionel E.
Giron in Support of Application for Compensation for Law Offices of Lionel E.
Giron Period January 2, 2019 through April 18, 2023” was filed in the
Bankruptcy matter In re: Denise Latrice Wheeler, Case No. 2:18-bk-10597.
(Defendant’s Surreply RJN., Ex. N.) The Declaration states, inter alia,
that “on April 19, 2023 [his] office served a copy of the Application for
Compensation to Mrs. Wheeler at 1191½ West 38th Street, Los Angeles, CA 90037.”
(Defendant’s Surreply RJN., Ex. N, ¶ 5.)
Defendant
states that “Plaintiff’s residence in May 2023 is important because the Notice
of Default was recorded on May 31, 2023.” (Surreply at p. 5:27-28.) Defendant’s
request for judicial notice in support of the surreply includes a “Notice of
Default and Election to Sell Under Deed of Trust, Security Agreement and
Fixture Filing (With Assignment of Rents and Leases)” recorded on May 31, 2023.
(Defendant’s Surreply RJN, Ex. O.) In the Complaint, Plaintiff alleges that
“[t]he Bankruptcy court granted the Motion for Relief from stay and CENTER
STREET recorded a new Notice of Default on May 31, 2023.” (Compl., ¶ 16.) 
Indeed,
although Plaintiff asserts in the reply that she “provides evidence that she
lived in the Property for decades, but most relevantly as of May 31, 2023…”
(Reply at p. 3:15-16), Plaintiff’s reply declaration does not appear to
specifically show that Plaintiff lived at the subject property on May 31, 2023.
Rather, Plaintiff states that she “lived at 637 E 29th Street, Los Angeles CA
90011 for over two decades.” (Wheeler Reply Decl., ¶ 2.) 
As discussed in the
Court’s October 19, 2023 Order, Defendant also asserts in the opposition that
“Plaintiff’s entire Complaint is barred by her failure to tender,” and that “[a] party seeking
to challenge a foreclosure sale appears in equity, and is thus required to do
equity before a court will exercise its equitable powers.” (Opp’n at p.
4:7-8; 4:10-11.) Defendant cites to Arnolds Management Corp. v. Eischen (1984) 158 Cal.App.3d
575, 578-579, where the
Court of Appeal noted that “[i]t is settled that an action to set aside a trustee’s sale for irregularities
in sale notice or procedure should be accompanied by an offer to pay the full
amount of the debt for which the property was security. This rule is premised upon the equitable
maxim that a court of equity will not order that a useless act
be performed. Equity will not interpose its remedial power in the accomplishment
of what seemingly would be nothing but an idly and expensively futile act, nor
will it purposely speculate in a field where there has been no proof as to
what beneficial purpose may be subserved through its intervention.” (Internal
quotations and citations omitted.) 
In
the reply, Plaintiff asserts that she is not required to allege tender here.
Plaintiff cites to Pfeifer v. Countrywide Home Loans, Inc. (2012) 211 Cal.App.4th
1250, 1280, where the
Court of Appeal noted that “[a] full tender must be made to set aside a foreclosure sale, based on
equitable principles. Courts, however, have not required tender when the lender
has not yet foreclosed and has allegedly violated laws related to avoiding
the necessity for a foreclosure.” (Internal
quotations, citation, and emphasis omitted.) In the opposition, Defendant
acknowledges that Plaintiff “seeks an order prohibiting foreclosure of
the real property located at 637 E 29th Street, Los Angeles CA 90011…” (Opp’n
at p. 1:2-3.) 
As discussed in the
Court’s October 19, 2023 Order, Defendant also asserts that Plaintiff’s
Complaint is barred by the doctrine of judicial estoppel. Defendant cites to Hamilton v. State Farm Fire & Cas. Co. (9th Cir. 2001) 270 F.3d 778, 782, where the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals noted that “Judicial estoppel is an equitable doctrine that
precludes a party from gaining an advantage by
asserting one position, and then later seeking an advantage by taking a clearly
inconsistent position.” (Emphasis omitted.) “In the
bankruptcy context, a party is judicially estopped from asserting a cause of
action not raised in a reorganization plan or otherwise mentioned in the debtor’s
schedules or disclosure statements.” (Id. at p. 783.) The Hamilton Court held that “Hamilton is
precluded from pursuing claims about which he had knowledge, but did not
disclose, during his bankruptcy proceedings, and that a discharge of debt by a
bankruptcy court, under these circumstances, is sufficient acceptance to
provide a basis for judicial estoppel, even if the discharge is later vacated.”
(Id. at
p. 784.)
Defendant indicates that here, on January 18,
2018, Plaintiff filed a “Voluntary
Petition for Individuals Filing for Bankruptcy” in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court
for the Central District of California, Case No. 2:18-bk-10597.” (Defendant’s
RJN, Ex. A.) Defendant states that Plaintiff did not disclose any claims
against Defendant or dispute the subject loan in the petition. (Defendant’s
RJN, Ex. A.) Defendant asserts that “because Plaintiff’s claims appear to have
arisen before or during the bankruptcy, Plaintiff should be judicially estopped
from pursuing his [sic] claims in this action.” (Opp’n at p. 6:1-2.) 
In the reply, Plaintiff counters that “Defendant cannot
argue that Plaintiff’s claims existed both before and during the bankruptcy.
Plaintiff claims that on May 31, 2023, Defendant recorded a Notice of Default
and executed an affidavit that it was not required to contact her pursuant to
2923.55, because the property was not her primary residence. This took place
after the bankruptcy closed.” (Reply
at p. 4:4-7, emphasis omitted.) As set forth above, Plaintiff indicates that
Defendant “recorded a new Notice of Default on May 31, 2023.” (Wheeler
Decl., ¶ 11, Ex. A.) Plaintiff alleges
that “Defendant recorded the NOD without fulfilling the requirements (2) and
(c) set forth in California Civil Code § 2923.55…”
(Compl., ¶ 21.) As discussed above, Defendant provides evidence of a “Voluntary
Petition for Individuals Filing for Bankruptcy” filed on January 18, 2018.
(Defendant’s RJN, Ex. A.) Defendant also provides evidence of a “Debtor’s Post
Confirmation Status Report filed in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Central
District of California, Case No. 2:18-bk-10597 on April 17, 2023.” (Defendant’s
RJN, Ex. B.) Thus, the Court does not find that Defendant has demonstrated that
Plaintiff’s complaint is barred by the doctrine of judicial estoppel. 
As
to the second factor of interim
harm, the Court finds that Plaintiff has established that the balance of harms
tips in her favor, as discussed in further detail below. “The trial court’s determination must be guided by a ‘mix’
of the potential-merit and interim-harm factors; the greater the plaintiff’s
showing on one, the less must be shown on the other to support [a restraining
order]…” (Church of Christ in Hollywood v. Superior Court,
supra, 99 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1251-1252.) As discussed, Plaintiff states
that she has “lived at 637 E 29th Street, Los Angeles CA 90011
for over two decades,” (Wheeler Reply Decl., ¶ 2), however, she does not appear
to specifically indicate whether she lived at this property on May 31,
2023.  The Court is thus inclined to provide
Plaintiff with an opportunity to respond to the evidence submitted in
connection with Defendant’s surreply. 
B.    
Interim Harm to the Parties
“To obtain a preliminary
injunction, a plaintiff ordinarily is required to present evidence of the
irreparable injury or interim harm that it will suffer if an injunction is not
issued pending an adjudication of the merits.” (White v. Davis, supra, 30
Cal.4th at p. 554.) “In evaluating interim harm, the trial
court compares the injury to the plaintiff in the absence of an injunction to
the injury the defendant is likely to suffer if an injunction is issued.” (Shoemaker v. County of Los Angeles (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 618, 633.) 
Plaintiff cites to Andrews v. San
Bernardino (1959)
175 Cal.App.2d 459, 463, where the
Court of Appeal noted that “[w]ith respect to the issuance of a
preliminary injunction the trial court had the duty of weighing with great care
the question of which party was most likely to be severely injured by the
granting or denial of the preliminary injunction…It is a rule so universally
followed and so often stated as to need only to be referred to that the
granting, denying, dissolving, or refusing to dissolve a preliminary or
temporary injunction rests in the sound discretion of the trial court upon a consideration
of all the particular circumstances of each individual case…It is further the
rule that The discretion, however should be exercised in favor of the party
most likely to be injured.” (Internal quotations and citation omitted.) 
Plaintiff asserts that “the balance of
hardships overwhelmingly favors Plaintiff. Plaintiff stands to lose title to
her property…As such, Plaintiff stands to suffer irreparable harm. On the other
hand, Defendant faces minimal hardship beyond the mere inability to foreclose.” (Mot. at p. 6:9-12.) Plaintiff states in her supporting
declaration that “I will face irreparable harm if the sale of my primary
residence goes forward…” (Wheeler Decl., ¶ 14.) 
In the opposition, Defendant asserts that the
balancing of the harms favors Defendant. Defendant asserts that its “business
requires that capital be readily available for investment in new projects at
short notice. Defendant’s funds have now been tied-up in the Property for far
longer than ever intended based on the original February 8, 2016 maturity date
and Plaintiff is not entitled to an additional extension as a result of the
present lawsuit which is a meritless delay tactic.” (Opp’n at p. 6:24-27.) The
Court notes that Defendant does not appear to provide any evidence in support
of the foregoing. 
Based on the foregoing, the Court finds that Plaintiff has
established that the balance of harms tips in her favor.
Conclusion
Based
on the foregoing, the Court continues the hearing on the Order to Show Cause Re
Preliminary Injunction to January 4th, 2024 at 2:00 p.m. Plaintiff
may file and serve by December 27, 2023 at 5:00 p.m. a response addressing the
evidence submitted by Defendant in connection with its surreply filed on November
30, 2023.  
The Court’s September 28, 2023 Temporary
Restraining Order shall remain in full force and effect pending the continued
hearing date on the Order
to Show Cause Re Preliminary Injunction and
the Court’s issuance of a ruling regarding the Order to Show Cause Re Preliminary
Injunction. 
Plaintiff
is ordered to give notice of this Order.
