Case Summary:
The judge's tentative ruling is to DENY the Motion to Set Aside Judgment and Quash Any Writ of Possession/Execution filed by Defendant Ciristen Joseph. The motion was filed on April 29, 2024, and the judge has reviewed the case file and arguments presented.

Background:
The case involves an unlawful detainer complaint filed by Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company against Ciristen Joseph and others. A default judgment was entered against Joseph on February 16, 2024. Joseph subsequently filed a motion to set aside the judgment and quash any writ of possession or execution.

Analysis:
The judge analyzed the motion under three different statutes: Code of Civil Procedure section 473(b), which provides for relief from a judgment or order taken against a party through mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect; Code of Civil Procedure section 473.5, which allows a party to set aside a default judgment and defend the action; and Code of Civil Procedure sections 473(d), 128(a)(8), and 86(b)(3), which relate to clerical mistakes, void judgments, and limited civil cases.

The judge found that Joseph did not demonstrate any "extrinsic fraud, mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect" that would justify relief under Code of Civil Procedure section 473(b). The judge also found that Joseph did not meet the requirements for relief under Code of Civil Procedure section 473.5, including the failure to attach an answer or other pleading proposed to be filed in the action.

The judge concluded that the motion was without merit and DENIED the Motion to Set Aside Judgment and Quash Any Writ of Possession/Execution.
