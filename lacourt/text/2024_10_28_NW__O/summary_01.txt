And here is the summary in English text:

This tentative ruling is regarding a motion to compel further responses to requests for admission filed by Plaintiff Eduardo Gonzalez Martinez against Defendant Kia America, Inc. The Plaintiff alleges that he purchased a defective 2020 Kia Forte, but the Defendant has refused to replace or repurchase the vehicle, in violation of the Song-Beverly Act.

The Court finds that the Plaintiff's motion is timely, as it was filed within the 47-day window after the Defendant served its responses to the requests for admission. The Court also finds that the Plaintiff is entitled to further responses to its requests for admission Nos. 12, 13, and 33, as the Defendant's objections are not justified.

However, the Court sustains the Defendant's objections to RFA No. 34, as the phrase "automotive experience" is vague, ambiguous, and overly broad, and is not calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.

The Court orders the Defendant to provide code-compliant responses without objection to the Plaintiff's requests for admission Nos. 12, 13, and 33 on or before November 15, 2024. The Court also denies the Plaintiff's request for sanctions, as it finds that the Defendant's opposition to the motion was substantially justified.
