     CASE NO.: 24VECV01386
 
ORDER GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART PLAINTIFF’S
  MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER DISCOVERY RESPONSES TO PLAINTIFF’S FIRST SET OF REQUESTS FOR ADMISSION TO
  DEFENDANT



 
I.              
BACKGROUND 
Plaintiff
Eduardo Gonzalez Martinez (“Plaintiff”) alleges he purchased a defective 2020
Kia Forte (“Subject Vehicle”) on July 4, 2023, but that Defendant Kia America,
Inc (“Defendant”) has refused to replace or repurchase the Subject Vehicle, in
violation of its obligations under the Song-Beverly Act. (See, e.g., Complaint,
¶¶ 16-26.)
Plaintiff now
moves to compel Defendant’s further discovery responses to his requests for
admission (“RFAs”).  
II.           
PROCEDURAL
HISTORY
On March 27,
2024, Plaintiff filed his Complaint, alleging (1) Violation of Song-Beverly
Act- Breach of Express Warranty; and (2) Violation of Song-Beverly Act Section
1793.2. 
On May 1,
2024, Defendant filed its Answer. 
On August 9,
2024, Plaintiff filed the instant Motion to Compel Further Responses to his
RFAs (“Motion”).
On August 23,
2024, the Court issued its Addendum re: Lemon Law Case.
On September
9, 2024, the parties executed a Protective Order. 
On October
15, 2024, Defendant filed its Opposition. 
On October
21, 2024, Plaintiff filed his Reply. 
III.        
LEGAL STANDARD 
Under Code of
Civil Procedure § 2033.290, a requesting party may move for further responses
to requests for admissions when responses have been timely served but the
requesting party finds the requests evasive or incomplete or objections without
merit or too general. No further responses can be ordered, however, to RFAs
that have been unqualifiedly denied, even if the facts are unquestionably true.
(See Holguin v. Superior Court (Hoage) (1972) 22 Cal.App.3d 812, 820.)
IV.         
MEET AND CONFER
Before bringing a motion to compel further responses to any
discovery request, the moving party is required to make efforts to meet and
confer in good faith and must submit a declaration attesting to those efforts.
(See Code Civ. Proc. §§ 2031.310(b)(2), 2030.300(b)(1), and 2033.290(b)(1).)
“A meet and confer declaration in support of a motion shall state facts showing
a reasonable and good faith attempt at an informal resolution of each issue
presented by the motion.” (Id. at § 2016.040.) However, a discovery
motion should not be denied automatically based upon the reason that the moving
parties failed to meet and confer in good faith. (See Obregon v.
Superior Court (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 424, 434.) 
Plaintiff’s counsel filed a declaration attesting to the parties’
meet and confer efforts, which consist of an exchange of letters. (See Declaration
of Phil Thomas filed August 9, 2024 (“Thomas Decl.”), ¶¶ 7-9, Exs. C-E.) 
The Court generally does not consider an exchange of letters
sufficient to satisfy Plaintiff’s meet and confer obligations. The Court will
nonetheless rule on Plaintiff’s Motion in the interest of judicial efficiency.  
V.            
ANALYSIS
A.            
Plaintiff’s Motion is Granted
1.              
Plaintiff’s Motion is Timely
Notice of a
motion to compel further responses must be given within 45 days of service of
verified responses or supplemental responses, or on or before any specific
later date to which the parties have agreed in writing. (See Code Civ.
Proc. §§ 2031.230(c),
2030.300(c),
2033.290(c).) When responses are served by mail, that time is extended by five
days. (See id. at § 1013(a).) Electronically served responses extend the
time to file a motion by two days. (See id. at § 1010.6(a)(3).) If such
notice is not given timely, the propounding party waives any right to compel a
further response. (See id.)¿¿ ¿¿
Here, Defendant
served its responses to Plaintiff’s RFAs on June 25, 2024, via email. (See Thomas
Decl., ¶ 6, Ex. B.) Plaintiff filed the instant Motion on August 9, 2024,
within the applicable 47-day window. (See Motion.)   
2.              
RFAs
Plaintiff
moves to compel Defendant’s further responses to its RFAs Nos. 12, 13, 33, and
34. (See Plaintiff’s Separate Statement in Support of Motion (“SS”).)
RFA No. 12
states “[a]dmit that YOU track the number of YOUR vehicles repurchased or
replaced in California.” 
RFA No. 13
states “[a]dmit that YOU are notified when a warranty repair is performed to a
Kia vehicle at your Authorized repair facility.”
RFA No. 33
states “[a]dmit that YOU have no written training materials for the persons
that YOU task with analyzing a California consumer’s request for a vehicle
repurchase.”
And RFA No.
34 states “[a]dmit that YOU do not require automotive experience for the
persons that YOU task with analyzing a California consumer’s request for a
vehicle repurchase.”
To each,
Defendant responded with objections only. (See SS, RFAs Nos. 12, 13, 33,
34.) 
Defendant argued
RFA No. 12 is vague, compound, overly broad, not calculated to lead to the
discovery of admissible evidence, and potentially seeks privileged information.
Defendant
argued RFAs No. 13, 33, and 34 are vague, seek confidential and/or privileged
information, and are not calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible
evidence. 
Plaintiff is
entitled to further responses to its RFAs Nos. 12, 13, and 33, but not to RFA
No. 34. As an initial matter, the Court overrules Defendant’s objections based
on confidential or privileged information, as the parties have executed a
Protective Order. The Court also overrules Defendant’s other objections as they
pertain to RFAs Nos. 12, 13, and 33 but sustains Defendant’s objections as they
pertain to RFA No. 34, as it finds the phrase “automotive experience” to be vague,
ambiguous, and overly broad, and as such not calculated to lead to the
discovery of admissible evidence. 
Based on the
foregoing, the Court GRANTS IN PART and DENIES IN PART Plaintiff’s Motion and
orders Defendant to provide code-compliant responses without objection to
Plaintiff’s RFAs Nos. 12, 13, and 33 on or before November 15, 2024.

VI.         
SANCTIONS
“The court shall impose a monetary sanction¿. . .¿against any
party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to
compel¿. . .” responses to
interrogatories, requests for production, or request for admission, absent
substantial justification or other circumstances that make imposing the
sanctions unjust.¿(Code Civ.
Proc. §§ 2030.290(c), 2031.300(c), & 2033.290(d).)
Similarly,¿“[t]he court may impose a monetary sanction ordering
that one engaging in the misuse of the discovery process, or any attorney
advising that conduct, or both pay the reasonable expenses, including
attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct.” (Code Civ.
Proc. § 2023.030(a).) Misuse of the discovery process includes “[f]ailing to
respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery,” and “[d]isobeying¿a court order to provide discovery.” (Code Civ.
Proc. § 2023.010(d), (g).) 
The Court denies Plaintiff’s request for sanctions
because it finds Defendant’s opposition to the motion was substantially justified.


VII.      
CONCLUSION
Based on the
foregoing, the Court GRANTS IN PART Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Further
Responses to its RFAs and orders Defendant to provide code-compliant responses
without objection Plaintiff’s RFAs Nos. 12, 13, and 33 on or before November
15, 2024.
Finally, the
Court DENIES Plaintiff’s request for discovery sanctions. 
IT IS SO
ORDERED.
DATED:      October 28, 2024
