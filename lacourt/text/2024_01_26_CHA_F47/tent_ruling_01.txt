SUMMARY
ADJUDICATION
 
Motion filed on 9/14/23.
 
MOVING PARTY: Defendants Patricia and Jesus Gallegos
RESPONDING PARTY: Defendant Ava Inc. dba Reliable Roofing

NOTICE: ok
 
RELIEF REQUESTED: An order summarily
adjudicating the 3rd cause of action for Interpleader in Plaintiff
Accredited Surety and Casualty, Inc.’s complaint in favor of Defendants
Patricia and Jesus Gallegos (the Gallegos) and awarding the Gallegos the
entirety of the $12,500 in bond proceeds previously deposited with the Court on
12/15/21.  

 
RULING: The motion is granted.
 
SUMMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises out of claims made on a bond issued by
Plaintiff Accredited Surety and Casualty Company (Plaintiff) to Defendants Ava
Inc. dba Reliable Roofing and Vahe Gevorkovich Kalashyan (collectively, the Ava
Defendants).
 
On 1/9/20, Plaintiff filed this action for: (1) Indemnity
against the Ava Defendants; (2) Reimbursement
against the Ava Defendants and (3) Interpleader against several claimants,
including Defendants Patricia and Jesus Gallegos (the Gallegos).  The defendants named in the 3rd
cause of action had all hired the Ava Defendants to provide construction
services which the defendants in the 3rd cause of action claimed
were grossly substandard and defective. 
Each of the defendants named in the 3rd cause of action was a
claimant on the $15,000 bond issued by Plaintiff to the Ava Defendants.  In relation to the 3rd cause of
action, Plaintiff deposited $12,500 with the court with Plaintiff retaining
$2,500 for its attorneys’ fees and costs. 
The 1st and 2nd causes against the Ava Defendants
have been dismissed.  (Separate Statement
(SS) 1, 5).  The Gallegos are the only
remaining claimants on the bond funds deposited with the court as all other
claimant defendants have been dismissed. 
(SS 5-6).
 
The Gallegos contend they have suffered more than $12,500
in damages; therefore, they are entitled to payment of the remaining bond
funds.  On 9/14/23, the Gallegos filed
and served the  instant motion seeking an
order summarily adjudicating the 3rd cause of action for
Interpleader in Plaintiff’s complaint in favor of the Gallegos and awarding the
Gallegos the entirety of the $12,500 in bond proceeds previously deposited with
the court on 12/15/21.  No opposition or
other response to the motion has been filed. 

 
 
 
ANALYSIS
 
The Gallegos have presented unrefuted evidence that they
contracted with Reliable Roofing (part of the Ava Defendants) to repair and
install a roof on the Gallegos’ home; that Reliable Roofing failed to perform
its contractual obligations which resulted in the Gallegos terminating the
contract and hiring others to remedy and correct Reliable Roofing’s defective
work resulting the Gallegos incurring economic losses in the amount of
$18,137.00.  (SS 11-12).  
 
Based on the foregoing, the Gallegos are entitled to have
the 3rd cause of action in Plaintiff’s complaint adjudicated in
their favor and to recover the $12,500.00 in bond proceeds previously deposited
with the court.  See CCP
437c(f)(1).  
 
CONCLUSION
 
The motion is granted.
 
The Court notes that the Gallegos failed to
electronically bookmark the exhibits attached to the declarations filed in
support of the motion as required by CRC 3.1110(f)(4).  The Gallegos’ counsel is warned that in this
department, failure to comply with this rule in the future may result in
matters being continued so that papers can be resubmitted in compliance with
the rule, papers not being considered and/or the imposition of sanctions.
