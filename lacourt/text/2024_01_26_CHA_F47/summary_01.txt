And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion filed by the Gallegos, seeking an order summarily adjudicating the 3rd cause of action for Interpleader in favor of the Gallegos and awarding them the entirety of the $12,500 in bond proceeds previously deposited with the court. The Gallegos had contracted with Reliable Roofing to repair and install a roof on their home, but Reliable Roofing failed to perform its contractual obligations, resulting in the Gallegos incurring economic losses. The Gallegos are the only remaining claimants on the bond funds, and the judge has determined that they are entitled to have the 3rd cause of action adjudicated in their favor and to recover the bond proceeds.
