  Case Number:  19STCV20880    Hearing Date:   April 22, 2024    Dept:  82 Juan Carlos Chavez
v. Immaculate Roofing Company, Inc.
Case No.
19STCV20880
Ex Parte
Application
 
            Plaintiff
Juan Carlos Chavez (“Plaintiff”) filed this employment action against
Immaculate Roofing Company, Inc. (“Defendant”) on June 14, 2019.  The deadline for this case to proceed to
trial under Code of Civil Procedure section 583.310 is December 29, 2025.  (See Court’s Minute Order, dated September
18, 2023.)
 
            Defendant
filed an ex parte application to continue the trial date (currently set for May
21, 2024) and all related dates for the following reasons: (1) Defendant’s
former counsel was forced to withdraw due to his health conditions, and new
counsel substituted into the case on April 12, 2024; and (2) Plaintiff’s
deposition has not yet been completed. 
In addition, the court has another trial set for May 21, 2024, and at
present, no judge has been assigned permanently to Department #39.  The court has reviewed and considered
Plaintiff’s opposition, but it does not change the necessity of a trial
continuance.
 
            Based upon
the foregoing, the court orders as follows:
 
            1.         The court grants the ex parte
application to continue the trial date and to set the discovery deadlines based
on the new trial date.
 
            2.         The court advances and vacates the
final status conference and trial date.
 
            3.         The court shall hold a trial setting
conference on May 14, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. in Department #39.  
 
            4.         The court orders the parties to
meet-and-confer concerning all remaining depositions, e.g., Plaintiff’s
deposition, and be prepared to discuss the dates with the court.  If the parties have not selected a date, the
court will do so at the trial setting conference.
 
            5.         Defendant’s counsel shall provide
notice and file proof of service with the court.
