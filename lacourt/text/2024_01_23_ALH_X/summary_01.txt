And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied Defendant Rudy Loya's motion to set aside default and default judgment entered against him. The Defendant had argued that the service of the complaint was improper and that he was excusably negligent in failing to respond to the lawsuit. However, the judge found that the Defendant failed to provide sufficient legal authority and evidentiary support to demonstrate that service was improper. Additionally, the judge determined that the Defendant's excuses for not responding to the lawsuit, including his busy schedule and preference for electronic communication, did not demonstrate excusable neglect. The judge noted that the Defendant had failed to show a proper ground for relief and that the burden of proof lies with the party seeking relief.
