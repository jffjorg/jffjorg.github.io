And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge rules that the plaintiff's motions to compel responses to discovery requests are granted. The defendant, City of Los Angeles, failed to serve timely responses to the plaintiff's discovery requests, and therefore, all objections to the interrogatories and requests for production are waived. The court orders the defendant to provide verified, objection-free responses to Set Two of the plaintiff's Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, and Request for Production of Documents. Additionally, the court deems the plaintiff's Request for Admissions, Set One, admitted against the defendant.

The court also grants the plaintiff's request for sanctions against the defendant in the amount of $630, consisting of 1 hour of counsel's hourly rate and $180 in filing fees. The defendant is ordered to pay the sanctions within 20 days of the order.

The judge's ruling requires the defendant to provide the discovery responses and pay the sanctions within the specified timeframe.
