[1] Defendant argues Plaintiff’s
motions are untimely because they were electronically served.  As such, Plaintiff was required to
electronically serve these motions on September 11, 2023, not September 14,
2023.  However, this argument fails given
that the parties agreed in writing to allow Plaintiff to file these motions on
September 14, 2023, and Defendant was able to file oppositions.
