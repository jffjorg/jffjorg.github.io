And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling is a decision by Judge Kerry Bensinger regarding a motion to compel compliance with deposition subpoenas for personal appearance and production of documents. The motion was filed by the defendants, Soto Provision, Inc. and Salvador Gabriel, seeking to compel nonparty Ramin Ghaneeian to appear for deposition and Rockpoint Funding, LLC to produce a person most knowledgeable for deposition. The plaintiffs, California Joint Powers Insurance Authority, filed oppositions and the defendants filed replies.

The judge finds that the motions are procedurally defective because they were not personally served on the nonparties, as required by California Rules of Court, rule 3.1346. The judge orders that the hearing for the motions be continued to November 2, 2023, to allow the defendants to personally serve the nonparties with the motions. The defendants must file proof of service no later than 5 court days before the hearing.
