PETITIONS
TO APPROVE MINOR’S COMPROMISE



 
MOVING PARTY:               Petitioner
Mardell Gully
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     No opposition 
 
 
            Claimants,
Olivia Gully (“Olivia”) and Avery Gully (“Avery”), minors, by and through their
parent, Petitioner, Mardell Gully, have agreed to settle her claims against Defendant, Edward Lopez. 
 
            Claimant
Olivia has agreed to release their claims against Defendant in exchange for $5,000.  If approved, $1,000 will be used for
attorney’s fees, leaving a settlement balance of $4,000 to be paid or delivered
to the guardian or the conservator of Claimant’s estate.
 
            Claimant
Avery has agreed to release their claims against Defendant in exchange for
$5,000.  If approved, $1,000 will be used
for attorney’s fees, leaving a settlement balance of $4,000 to be paid or
delivered to the guardian or the conservator of Claimant’s estate. 
            
            Court
approval is required for all settlements of a minor’s claim.  (Probate Code §§ 3500, 3600, et seq.; Code Civ. Proc. § 372.)  The petition must be verified and “must
contain a full disclosure of all information that has any bearing on the reasonableness
of the compromise, covenant, settlement, or disposition.”¿ (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 7.950.)¿¿
 
            Upon
review, the Court finds that the settlements are fair and reasonable, as are
the request for attorney’s fees.  However,
the Petitions each indicate at Item 18a(1) that there is a guardianship of the
estate of each Claimant.  However,
Petitioner fails to establish the existence of the guardianship or that
Petitioner is permitted to compromise the claim on behalf of Olivia and Avery.  If there is no guardianship of the estate,
Petitioner should select Item 18b and one of the sub-options therein.[1]
            Accordingly,
the hearings for these Petitions are CONTINUED to October 23, 2023, at 1:30
p.m. in Department 27 of the Spring Street Courthouse.  Petitioner to file amended Petitions
consistent with this order later than 5 court days before the hearing date.
 
Moving party to give notice.
