[1] The Court also directed Technology
Insurance to file a request to reopen discovery.  However, the parties thereafter stipulated to
continue the trial date and all related dates, including discovery.  (See 9/19/23 Stipulation for Continuance of
Trial and All Related Dates.)  As such,
the request to reopen discovery is moot.  The Court further notes that the Stipulation
does not provide for a continuance of this motion for summary judgment, nor
does it state whether Technology Insurance would have an opportunity to file an
opposition.
