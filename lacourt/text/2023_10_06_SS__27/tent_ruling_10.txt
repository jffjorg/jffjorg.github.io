DEMURRER
WITH MOTION TO STRIKE



 
MOVING PARTY:               Defendant
City of Los Angeles
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     Plaintiff Crystal
Lambert
 
 
I.          BACKGROUND
 
            On May 9, 2022, Plaintiff, Crystal Lambert, initiated this
action against Defendants, Child Care Careers LLC, City of Los Angeles
(“City”), and Mexican American Opportunity Foundation, for (1) Negligence, (2)
Premises Liability, and (3) Respondeat Superior.  Plaintiff alleges she was working as a
substitute teacher at Preschool & Day Care Staffing Firm at 3440 Wilshire
Blvd Suite 1111, Los Angeles, California (the “Premises”) when a student assaulted
Plaintiff.  Plaintiff further alleges the
Defendants owned, maintained, controlled, managed, and operated the Premises.  Plaintiff seeks punitive damages.
 
            On August 31,
2023, the City filed this Demurrer and Motion to Strike punitive damages from the
Complaint.  
 
Plaintiff opposes the demurrer and the City replies.  The motion to strike is unopposed.
 
II.        LEGAL STANDARD FOR DEMURRER  
 
A demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of the pleadings and
will be sustained only where the pleading is defective on its face.  (City
of Atascadero v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc. (1998) 68
Cal.App.4th 445, 459.)  “We treat the demurrer as admitting all material
facts properly pleaded but not contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact
or law.  We accept the factual allegations of the complaint as true and also consider
matters which may be judicially noticed.  [Citation.]”  (Mitchell
v. California Department of Public Health (2016) 1 Cal.App.5th 1000, 1007; Del
E. Webb Corp. v. Structural Materials Co. (1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 593, 604
[“the facts alleged in the pleading are deemed to be true, however improbable
they may be”].)  Allegations are to be liberally construed.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 452.)  In construing the allegations, the court is to give
effect to specific factual allegations that may modify or limit inconsistent
general or conclusory allegations.  (Financial Corporation of America
v. Wilburn (1987) 189 Cal.App.3rd 764, 769.)   
 
A demurrer may be brought if insufficient facts are stated
to support the cause of action asserted.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10,
subd. (e).)  “A demurrer for uncertainty is strictly construed, even where
a complaint is in some respects uncertain, because ambiguities can be clarified
under modern discovery procedures.”  (Khoury v. Maly’s of California,
Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.)   


Where the complaint contains substantial factual
allegations sufficiently apprising defendant of the issues it is being asked to
meet, a demurrer for uncertainty will be overruled or plaintiff will be given
leave to amend.  (Williams v. Beechnut Nutrition Corp. (1986) 185
Cal.App.3d 135, 139, fn. 2.)  Leave to amend must be allowed where there
is a reasonable possibility of successful amendment.  (Goodman v.
Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.)  The burden is on the complainant
to show the Court that a pleading can be amended successfully.  (Ibid.)  
 
III.      JUDICIAL NOTICE
 
            The City requests judicial notice of the following:
(1) Plaintiff’s Claim for Damages No. C22-18920 filed with the City of Los
Angeles on April 18, 2022; (2) U.S. Census Bureau Data for the Cities of
Beverly Hills and Los Angeles; (3) California Secretary of State Records of
ChildCare Careers LLC Filings; and (4) Screen shot and Printouts from the
ChildCare Careers LLC Website.  Given the
ruling herein, the Court need not address the request for judicial notice.  
            
IV.       DISCUSSION
 
C.  Meet and Confer
 
Defense counsel has complied with the meet and confer
requirement.¿ (See Declaration of Margaret Shikibu, ¶¶ 3-10.)
 
D.  Analysis
 
The Complaint is
subject to demurrer for at least two reasons. 
First, common law causes of action cannot be asserted against a public
entity.  “Under the Government Claims Act
(Gov. Code, § 810 et seq.), there is no common law tort liability for public
entities in California; instead, such liability must be based on statute.”  (Guzman v. County of Monterey¿(2009)
46 Cal.4th 887, 897.)  Here, the
Complaint sets forth causes of action against the City— negligence, premises
liability, respondeat superior—which sound in common law.  Plaintiff argues there are statutory bases
for her claims.  However, the Complaint
is devoid of allegations showing which statutes apply.  
 
Second, a
complaint against a public entity must allege compliance with the Government
Claims Act.  “[A] plaintiff must
allege facts demonstrating or excusing compliance with the claim presentation requirement.”  (State of California v. Superior Court (2004)
32 Cal.4th 1234, 1243.)  Here, the Complaint does not allege whether she
has complied with the applicable claims statute.  
 
In sum, the
Complaint is deficient.  Plaintiff does
not provide any meritorious or relevant argument to the contrary.  The demurrer is SUSTAINED.
 
IV.        CONCLUSION
            
The demurrer is sustained. 
Leave to amend is granted.
 
Plaintiff Cyrstal Lambert is ordered to serve and file a First
Amended Complaint within 30 days of this order. 

 
Defendant City of Los Angeles is ordered to serve and file its
responsive pleading within 30 days of service of the First Amended Complaint.
 
The motion to strike is moot.
 
Moving party to give notice.
