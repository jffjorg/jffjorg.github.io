MOTION
TO BE RELIEVED AS COUNSEL



 
MOVING PARTY:               Bradley
S. Wallace, The Wallace Firm, PC
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     No opposition
 
 
I.          INTRODUCTION
 
On September 1, 2023, Bradley S. Wallace, counsel for Plaintiff,
Nathan Strauss, filed this Motion to be Relieved as Counsel.  
 
            The Motion
is unopposed.
 
II.        LEGAL STANDARDS 
 
California Rule of Court rule 3.1362 (Motion to Be Relieved
as Counsel) requires (1) notice of motion and motion to be directed to the
client (made on the Notice of Motion and Motion to be Relieved as Counsel—Civil
form (MC-051)); (2) a declaration stating in general terms and without
compromising the confidentiality of the attorney-client relationship why a
motion under Code of Civil Procedure section 284(2) is brought instead of
filing a consent under Code of Civil Procedure section 284(1) (made on the
Declaration in Support of Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil
form (MC-052)); (3) service of the notice of motion and motion and declaration
on all other parties who have appeared in the case; and (4) the proposed order
relieving counsel (prepared on the Order Granting Attorney's Motion to Be
Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-053)). 
 
The court has discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw,
and such a motion should be granted provided that there is no prejudice to the
client, and it does not disrupt the orderly process of justice.  (See Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21
Cal.App.4th 904, 915.)  
 
III.       DISCUSSION 
 
Bradley S. Wallace seeks to be relieved as counsel of record
for Plaintiff for the following reason: “Attorney and client have a conflict of
interest that precludes further representation of client.  There has been a breakdown in the attorney
client relationship that precludes further representation.  Attorney is unable to represent client as a
result of this breakdown and conflict. 
Due to the nature of the breakdown and conflict, attorney is precluded
from disclosing the exact nature of the breakdown and conflict in this
Declaration [California Rules of Professional Conduct 3-1700[a] – attorney
withdrawal must not prejudice client] but will discuss the nature of the
conflict with the court in camera if so required.”  (MC-052.) 
 
 
Absent a showing of resulting prejudice, an attorney’s
request for withdrawal should be granted.  (People v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d
398, 406.).  
 
Upon review, the Court finds the Motion complies with
California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362. 
Accordingly, the motion is GRANTED.
 
IV.       CONCLUSION         
 
            The motion is granted and effective
upon the filing of the proof of service of this signed order upon Plaintiff.
Moving party to give notice.
