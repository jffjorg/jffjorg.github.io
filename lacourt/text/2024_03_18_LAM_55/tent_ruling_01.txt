  Case Number:  22STCV18090    Hearing Date:   March 18, 2024    Dept:  55  
NATURE OF PROCEEDINGS:
Petition of JOSE GARCIA for Approval of Compromise of Claim or Action or
Disposition of Proceeds of Judgment for Minor or Person With a Disability.
 
BACKGROUND
In this case, Plaintiffs seek damages against
Defendants MOGA 1967, LP and SWAMI International, Inc., related to habitability
issues in Plaintiffs’ home. In January 2024, Plaintiffs filed a notice of
settlement of the case. Plaintiff Jose Garcia, as guardian ad litem of three-year
old Plaintiff Josiah Garcia, filed a petition requesting approval of a $15,000 settlement
as to Josiah Garcia. 
LEGAL STANDARD
Courts considering whether to approve a minor’s compromise
determine whether petitioners, such as guardians, are acting in the best
interests of the minor. Code Civ. Proc. §372(a)(3); Scruton v. Korean Air
Lines Co. (1995) 39 Cal.App.4th 1596, 1603-07. “[T]he protective role the
court generally assumes in cases involving minors, [is] a role to assure that
whatever is done is in the minor’s best interests….  [I]ts primary concern is whether the
compromise is sufficient to provide for the minor’s injuries, care and
treatment.”  Goldberg v. Sup. Ct.
(1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 1378, 1382.  Judicial
discretion in approving petitions for minors’ compromises, and ordering
distributions, and local court policies, must be applied in the best interests
of minors, in a case-by-case method, tailored to the circumstances.  Christensen v. Sup. Ct. (1987) 193
Cal.App.3d 139, 142-44.
ANALYSIS
A petition for court approval of a compromise under
Code of Civil Procedure section 372 must comply with California Rules of Court
rules 7.950, 7.951, and 7.952. 
Here, the Court cannot rule on the petition because the
Petitioner did not fill out all the required parts of the mandatory petition.
Specifically, the Petitioner did not address item 8, regarding the current
state of any injuries of the minor. See CRC Rule 7.950(4). Whether the minor
has, or does not have, ongoing injuries, is a major factor in ascertaining
whether the settlement amount is in the best interests of the minor.  If the minor has fully recovered, then
$15,000 is a fair settlement for the reported suffering, and the Court would
grant the petition.  That amount is
comparable to many other similar habitability case settlements seen in the
court, a three-year-old minor who suffered fright, annoyance, asthma symptoms,
fear, nervousness, recurring anxiety, discomfort and embarrassment.
Courts may order that funds to be received by a minor
must be deposited in a financial institution. CRC Rule 7.953(a). Per item 18(b)
on the mandatory petition, Petitioner must include attachment 18(b)(2) with the
name, branch, and address of the financial institution where the balance of the
settlement (after deducting the attorney’s fees and costs) will be deposited. Currently,
the petition does not contain such information. 
CONCLUSION
For the reasons stated above, the Court cannot grant
the petition submitted by the Petitioner. The parties are back in Department 55
on 3/21/24 for the OSC re Dismissal (Settlement). If Petitioner submits a
revised petition at or before the 3/21/24 OSC, with a proof of service showing
electronic service of such revised petition on Defendants, the Court will consider
the revised petition at the OSC hearing.
