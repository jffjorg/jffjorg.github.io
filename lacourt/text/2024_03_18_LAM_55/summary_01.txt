And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling in a case involving a petition for approval of a $15,000 settlement for a three-year-old minor, Josiah Garcia, who suffered from habitability issues in his home. The petition was filed by Jose Garcia, the minor's guardian ad litem. The judge cannot grant the petition because the Petitioner did not fill out all the required parts of the mandatory petition, specifically item 8 regarding the current state of any injuries of the minor. The judge also notes that the Petitioner did not provide information about the financial institution where the settlement funds will be deposited. The parties are scheduled to appear in court on March 21, 2024, for an OSC re Dismissal (Settlement). If a revised petition is submitted at or before the OSC hearing, the judge will consider it.
