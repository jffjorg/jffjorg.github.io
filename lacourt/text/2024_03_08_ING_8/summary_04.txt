And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling sustaining the demurrer filed by the defendants, U.S. Bank National Association and Clarisa Espinoza, to the plaintiff's Complaint. The plaintiff, Collin J. Burt, has alleged causes of action for common counts, intentional tort-grand theft, and motor vehicle negligence. However, the judge finds that the plaintiff's Complaint lacks sufficient facts to support these causes of action.

The judge notes that the plaintiff's Complaint is uncertain and fails to label the parties and claims, making it difficult for the defendants to respond. The judge also finds that the plaintiff has not alleged sufficient facts to state a cause of action for common counts, intentional tort-grand theft, or motor vehicle negligence.

The judge grants the plaintiff 20 days to amend the Complaint and sustains the demurrer in full. The defendants are ordered to give written notice of the ruling.
