And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the motion to enter stipulation for judgment brought by the plaintiff, Groundwork Group Inc. dba Frontline Finish, against the defendants, HC Automotive, Inc., HNL Automotive Inc., Payless Cars, Inc., and HK Automotive, Inc. The motion seeks to enforce a settlement agreement between the parties and obtain a judgment in the amount of $67,849.76.

The parties entered into a settlement agreement on February 6, 2023, which provided for payment alternatives, including an optional payment deferral. The defendants failed to pay by May 15, 2023, and the plaintiff sent notices of delinquency to the defense counsel. Despite these notices, the defendants failed to cure their delinquency.

The court finds that the plaintiff has carried its burden in ensuring all requirements of Code of Civil Procedure ยง 664.6, and therefore grants the motion to enter stipulation for judgment. The court orders the entry of judgment in the amount of $67,849.76, which includes the principal balance, accrued interest, costs, and attorneys' fees. The plaintiff is ordered to give notice.
