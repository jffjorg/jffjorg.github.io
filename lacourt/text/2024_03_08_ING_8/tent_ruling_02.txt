I. BACKGROUND¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿ 
A. Factual¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿ 
On
October 19, 2022, Gail Chelebian (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against
General Motors LLC (“GM”). On January 12, 2023, Plaintiff filed a First Amended
Complaint (“FAC”) alleging causes of action for: (1) Violation of
Subdivision(D) of Civil Code section 1793.2; (2) Violation of Subdivision(B) of
Civil Code section 1793.2; (3) Violation of Subdivision (A)(3) of Civil Code
Section 1793.2; (4) Breach of the Implied Warrant of Merchantability; ad (5)
Fraudulent Inducement – Concealment. This action is based on the fact that on
or about December 29, 2017, Plaintiff entered into a warranty contract
regarding a 2017 Chevrolet Bolt EV, VIN 1G1FX6S0XH4189565 (the “Subject
Vehicle” or “Bolt”). (See FAC, ¶ 6.)
 
According
to the moving papers, on January 27, 2023, Plaintiff propounded Requests for
Production of Documents, Set One, seeking documents relating to GM’s internal
investigation and analysis, among other things, of the claimed battery Defects.
Specifically, Plaintiff notes she requested that Defendant produce documents
concerning: (A) The Subject Vehicle (i.e., RFP Nos. 1, 7); (B) GM’s Internal
Knowledge and Investigation regarding the Battery Defects in 2017 Chevrolet
Bolt EV Vehicles (i.e., RFP Nos. 17, 23, 24, 25, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42);
(C) Summaries, Memoranda, and Power Points regarding the Battery Defects in
2017 Chevrolet Bolt EV Vehicles (i.e., RFP Nos. 43, 44, 45); (D) Song Beverly
Act and Buyback Policies and Procedures (i.e., RFP No. 58, 59, 68); (E)
Communication With Governmental Agencies and Suppliers regarding the Battery
Defects in 2017 Chevrolet Bolt EV Vehicles (i.e., RFP Nos. 76, 78, 79); (F)
Dealer Agreements and GM’s Financial Documents (i.e., RFP Nos. 85); and (G)
Other Documents Related To The Subject Vehicle’s Battery Defects (i.e., RFP
Nos. 90, 91, 92, 93). 
 
However,
Plaintiff asserts that GM responded insufficiently to the discovery requests by
either: (1) completely refusing to produce any documents for an overwhelming
majority of the requests (i.e., RFP Nos. 17, 23, 24, 25, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41,
42, 43, 44, 45, 58, 59, 68, 76, 78, 79, 85, 90, 91, 92, 93) and (2) limiting
the scope of discovery to include only the Subject Vehicle (i.e., RFP Nos. 1,
7, 17, 23, 24, 25, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 58, 59, 68, 76, 78,
79, 90, 91, 92, and 93). As such, Plaintiff has filed this Motion to Compel.
Prior to the last hearing on this motion, the parties filed a joint statement
noting that the remaining RFPs at issue were: 17, 23, 24, 25, 36, 37, 38, 39,
40, 41, 42, 76, 78, 79, and 90.
 
On
September 13, 2023, this Court GRANTED the Motion to Compel Further Responses,
in part, as to RFP Nos. 1, 7, 24-25, 42-45, 58-59, 68, 76, 78-79, and 90-93. The
Court ordered compliance, verified responses, and production of documents, by
November 6, 2023. 
 
On
November 6, 2023, GM served supplemental responses to RFP Nos. 1, 7, 24-25,
42-45, 58-59, 68, 76, 78-79, and 90-93. However, Plaintiff argues that
Defendant’s document production remains deficient, non-Code compliant, and
contrary to the Court’s September 13, 2023. As such, Plaintiff has brought this
Motion to Compel Compliance with the Court’s Order. 
 
B. Procedural¿¿¿ 
¿¿ 
            On
January 30, 2024, Plaintiff filed this Motion to Compel Defendant’s Compliance
with the Court’s September 13, 2023 Discovery Order. On February 26, 2024,
Defendant filed this opposition. To date, no reply brief has been filed. 
 
II. ANALYSIS¿¿ 
 
A.    Legal Standard 
 
 A party must respond to interrogatories within 30 days
after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subd. (a).) If a party to whom
interrogatories are directed does not provide timely responses, the requesting
party may move for an order compelling responses to the discovery. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (b).) The party also waives the right to make any
objections, including one based on privilege or work-product protection. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).) There is no time limit for a motion to
compel responses to interrogatories other than the cut-off on hearing discovery
motions 15 days before trial. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2024.020, subd. (a); Code
Civ. Proc., 2030.290.) No meet and confer efforts are required before filing a
motion to compel responses to the discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290; Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 390, 411
 
B.    
Discussion 
 
Plaintiff contends that the supplemental responses produced
on November 6, 2023, were unverified, and are not code-compliant because
Defendant wrote that GM “complied in whole,” without affirming that a diligent
search and a reasonable inquiry has been made in an effort to comply with the
demand or stating GM is not withholding any document based on any objections
and/or privileges. Further, Plaintiff takes issue with the fact that GM has not
produced specific documentation as to each of the requests. 
 
In opposition, Defendant GM argues this motion is moot
because it has complied in whole and produced all documents in its possession,
custody, or control. However, GM does not address the verification issue nor
does GM address the motion’s assertion that GM did not state it had conducted a
diligent search and reasonable inquiry.  The
fact that GM did not provide a verification for its November 6, 2023 Supplemental
Responses might be enough to justify this motion, except that the Randolph
Declaration filed in support of this motion concedes the verification was provided
3 days after the supplemental responses. 
Paragraph 7 of the Randolph Declaration asserts that GM did not produces
Electronically stored information or emails relating to any internal
investigation of the claimed Battery Defect; the Opposition asserts that GM
produced a spreadsheet of ESI detailing other customer complaints, technical documents,
and a spreadsheet of internal investigation documents.  Because Plaintiff filed no Reply brief, the Court
has no ability to determine whether Plaintiff concurs that the ESI re other customer
complaints was or was not contained in a chart as the Court had indicated in
its discovery order, whether the internal investigation chart refenced in the opposition
does or does not comply with the Court’s Discovery Order, and the Court does
not know if Plaintiff concurs with Ms. Habib’s declaration where she asserts
there was no further meet and confer about GM’s compliance with the Court’s
discovery order before this motion was filed. 

 
The Court seeks oral argument from Plaintiff on these
points, BRIEFLY, so the Court can ascertain whether the absence of a Reply brief
and declaration was tantamount to a concession of GM”s position, or whether Plaintiff
is inclined to stand on only its moving papers (which are largely rebutted by the
Opposition), and the Separate Statement as to which GM has not specifically
responded in writing so the Court seeks oral argument from GM as detailed below.  Further, the Court will ask Plaintiff to
explain why a statement of full compliance is insufficient, in light of CCP
section 2031.22 which seems to authorize the responding party to so state.  The Court will not seek argument as to why the
moving papers citation to the Santana case uses the 3-1/2 year old Westlaw
citation instead of the official
citation (Santana v FCA (2020) 56
Cal.App.5th 334), but the Court notes for future reference that when
relying on prior briefing that may be years old, counsel should confirm that the
citation and the law relied upon from a prior brief is still valid.  
 
The Court also seeks BRIEF oral argument from GM as to why
the verification was not provided together with the Supplemental Responses, whether
GM did or did not produce the “single document that evidence the date and
circumstances” that a GM engineer first learned of a battery charging, melting,
or burning problem in a Volt as ordered as to RFP No. 24 and 25, and whether GM
did or did not produce any TSB, work instruction or repair procedure
disseminated to the dealer body to address a customer complaint of failure to
maintain or reach full charge, battery-related fire, melting, or burning complaint
in or applicable to a 2017 Volt as required by RFP 42.  IF GM will orally argue that it Did produce
such responsive documents, the Court will want to know the Bates number or
numbers of the responsive documents(s).   As to RFP 76, the Court seeks oral argument form
GM as to whether it did or did not produce a communication with NHTSA or EPA
regarding the battery issues described in the Court’s Discovery Order as to
2017 Chevy Volts, and if so what is the Bates number or numbers of the responsive
documents produced.  As to RFPs 78 and 79,
is it GM’s position that it did not submit any EWR or TREAD reports to NHTSA as
to the battery issues described in the Court’s Discovery Order as to 2017 Chevy
Volts, or that there was an EWR and/or TREAD report and if so what is the Bates
number or numbers of the responsive documents produced.  
 
The Court will not order prospective sanctions of any daily
amount on the record currently before it; the Court is willing to excuse the 3-day
delay in GM providing the verification so long as GM agrees it is barred from
arguing or offering evidence later in the case that the November 9 verification
did not apply to the Court-ordered Supplemental Responses and documents
produced on November 6.
