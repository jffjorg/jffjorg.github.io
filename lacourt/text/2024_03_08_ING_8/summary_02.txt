And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge is considering a motion to compel Defendant's compliance with the Court's September 13, 2023 discovery order. The Plaintiff, Gail Chelebian, alleges that Defendant, General Motors, LLC, failed to properly respond to discovery requests and is seeking sanctions. The Judge is seeking oral argument on several points, including whether Defendant complied with the Court's discovery order, whether Defendant produced all responsive documents, and whether Defendant verified its supplemental responses. The Judge is also seeking clarification on several issues, including whether Defendant produced specific documentation as to each of the requests and whether Defendant conducted a diligent search and reasonable inquiry. The Judge will not order prospective sanctions of any daily amount on the record currently before it, but will excuse the 3-day delay in Defendant providing verification so long as Defendant agrees it is barred from arguing or offering evidence later in the case that the November 9 verification did not apply to the Court-ordered Supplemental Responses and documents produced on November 6.
