  CASE NO.: 24STCV01033
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING MOTION TO BE RELIEVED
  AS COUNSEL
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
May 16, 2024



 
The
Law Offices of Adam Zolonz A.P.C., counsel of record for Plaintiff Leonardo Batistella,
seeks to be relieved as counsel.  Counsel’s
declaration states that Plaintiff’s conduct has rendered it unreasonably difficult
for counsel to carry out the representation effectively, and there has been a breakdown
in communication that renders effective representation impossible.  No party opposed the motion.
Absent
a showing of resulting prejudice, an attorney’s request for withdrawal should be
granted.  (People v. Prince (1968)
268 Cal.App.2d 398, 406.)  Counsel’s motion
complies with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362.  Trial has not yet been rescheduled, and there
is no prejudice to Plaintiff.
With
the continuance of the Case Management Conference, the proposed order will no longer
reflect the correct upcoming hearing dates. 
Before signing the order, the Court will correct this information.
The
unopposed motion to be relieved is GRANTED and effective upon filing a proof of
service showing service of the signed Form MC-053 order and this order on Plaintiff
Leonardo Batistella and all parties who have appeared.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
 
        
Dated this 16th day of May 2024
