And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling grants the motion to be relieved as counsel, allowing The Law Offices of Adam Zolonz A.P.C. to withdraw from representing Plaintiff Leonardo Batistella. The court finds that the plaintiff's conduct has made it impossible for counsel to continue representing him effectively, and there has been a breakdown in communication. Since no party opposed the motion, the court grants the motion and orders that the proof of service be filed with the court. The case management conference will continue, and the court will correct the upcoming hearing dates.
