And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants in part the motion to set the case for trial and to advance the case for trial to a date before August 1, 2024. The judge determines that the case is not subject to dismissal for failure to serve the defendant within three years, as the plaintiff filed the complaint on August 1, 2019, and the defendant was served on September 19, 2019. The judge also determines that the five-year rule for bringing the case to trial may be tolled due to the default judgment entered on January 23, 2020. The judge sets a trial date in or before November 2024 and orders supplemental briefing on the tolling of the five-year rule.
