  CASE NO.: 19STCV27319
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING IN PART MOTION
  TO SET CASE FOR TRIAL AND TO ADVANCE CASE FOR TRIAL TO A DATE BEFORE AUGUST 1,
  2024 
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
May 16, 2024



 
On April 18, 2023, the Court
granted Defendant Genrik Nazaryan’s motion to set aside default and default judgment.  Defendant’s answer was filed the same day.  No further action is reflected on this case’s
docket.
On
March 5, 2024, Plaintiff Adel Tanious filed a motion to set the case for trial for
a date before August 1, 2024.
According
to Plaintiff, because he filed this action on August 1, 2019, trial must be set
before August 1, 2024 to avoid dismissal. 
(Motion at p. 4; see Code Civ. Proc., § 583.310.)  Defendant argues that “Plaintiff has done nothing
towards bringing this matter to trial or conclusion,” and the case should already
be dismissed for failure to serve him within three years.  (Opposition at pp. 2-7.)
A.        The Court Will Not Dismiss This Action
Under the Three-Year Rule.
“A
plaintiff must serve ‘a defendant within three years after the action is commenced
against the defendant.’  (§ 583.210, subd.
(a).)  ‘[A]n action is commenced at the time
the complaint is filed.’  (Ibid.)  Dismissal is mandatory where a plaintiff fails
to serve a defendant within the statutory time limits.  (§ 583.250, subd. (b).)”  (Inversiones Papaluchi S.A.S. v. Superior Court
(2018) 20 Cal.App.5th 1055, 1061.)  “Service
requirements ‘are mandatory and are not subject to extension, excuse, or exception
except as expressly provide by statute.’ 
(§ 583.250, subd. (b).)  The Legislature
has articulated four conditions that toll the time for service.  (§ 583.240, subd. (a).)  The conditions ‘must be construed strictly against
the plaintiff.’  [Citation.]”  (Id. at pp. 1061-1062.)  The exceptions include “The defendant was not
amenable to the process of the court,” and “Service, for any other reason, was impossible,
impracticable, or futile due to causes beyond the plaintiff’s control.”  (Code of Civ. Proc., § 583.240, subd. (a), (d).)
Plaintiff
filed this action on August 1, 2019, and the proof of service reflects substituted
service on September 19, 2019.  Plaintiff
thereafter obtained entry of default and default judgment.  Although the Court later vacated that entry of
default and default judgment due to improper service, at the time, Plaintiff represented
that Defendant had been timely served.  Based
on the status of this case as of the January 23, 2020 entry of default, service
of process on Defendant was no longer possible because Defendant had purportedly
already been served.  Defendant’s answer was
filed on April 18, 2023 when the default was vacated.  Accordingly, because Defendant has appeared in
this action and submitted to jurisdiction, Plaintiff need not re-serve him.
Moreover,
even if this case were subject to dismissal due to failure to timely serve
Defendant, the Court would not act on such a request when it is made only in opposition
to a motion.
B.        The Time to Bring This Case to Trial is
Extended Until At Least February 1, 2025.
An
action must be brought to trial within five years.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 583.310.)  However, after this case was filed, the Judicial
Council of California adopted Emergency Rule 10(a), which provides a six-month extension
to bring an action to trial.  (See Ables
v. A. Ghazale Brothers, Inc. (2022) 74 Cal.App.5th 823, 827-828.)  With an August 1, 2019 filing date, the actual
deadline to bring this action to trial is now February 1, 2025.
To
guarantee a timely trial in case of unexpected continuances, the Court will set
a trial date in or before November 2024.
C.        The Time to Bring This Case to Trial May
Be Further Extended.
Plaintiff’s
counsel “has now undertaken additional research” and contends that the five-year
period is tolled because (1) the August 2, 2021 default judgment made the case “impossible,
impractical or futile” to bring to trial (Code Civ. Proc., § 583.340, subd. (c));
and (2) the case “was already brought to trial in the non-jury prove up when the
court took testimony from the plaintiff.” 
(See Reply.)
Defendant
has not had an opportunity to address this tolling argument.  The Court therefore orders supplemental briefing
about any tolling of the five-year rule as a result of the default judgment.
Additionally,
the time to bring an action to trial may be extended by the parties’ written stipulation
or oral agreement made in open court if that agreement is entered in the minutes
of the court or a transcript is made.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 583.330.)  The parties are directed
to meet and confer about whether they can agree on a period of time.
D.        Conclusion
The
motion to set case for trial is GRANTED IN PART.
Final
Status Conference is scheduled for [in or before November 2024] at 9:00 a.m.
Trial
is scheduled for [in or before November 2024] at 9:00 a.m.
No
later than June 14, 2024, each party shall file and serve a supplemental brief regarding
tolling.  Alternatively, no later than
June 14, 2024, the parties may file a stipulation to extend the deadline for trial.
An
Order to Show Cause Re: Tolling or Extension of Five-Year Rule is scheduled for
June 28, 2024 at 8:30 a.m.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
