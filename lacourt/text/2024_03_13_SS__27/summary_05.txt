And here is the summary in English text:

The Honorable Lee S. Arian has issued a tentative ruling in the case of YOUNATAN SAMOUHA vs KAMYAR ANSARI, et al. The case involves a motion by Plaintiff to set aside the dismissals of Defendants Albert Massachi and Crystal Investments, LLC, and Defendant Tal Ohana.

The Judge denied the motion to set aside the dismissals of Defendants Albert Massachi and Crystal Investments, LLC, as it was untimely filed. However, the Judge granted the motion to set aside the dismissal of Defendant Ohana, as it was timely filed and supported by an affidavit from Plaintiff's attorney, Joshua Kohanbash, acknowledging his mistake, inadvertence, or negligence.

The Judge relied on California Code of Civil Procedure section 473(b) and various case law to arrive at this decision. The Judge also found that Plaintiff's attorney was negligent in relying on promises from the opposing party without a specific written agreement for cooperation in exchange for dismissing Defendant Ohana.

The tentative ruling is subject to change if any party intends to submit written arguments. If no party submits, the Judge may adopt the tentative ruling as the final order of the Court.
