Background¿ 
¿ 
On January 31,
2022, Plaintiff filed a negligence lawsuit against Defendants Ashes to Ashes
Corporation and Macera Crematory, alleging that Mr. Zamudio's body was cremated
without the presence or consent of his family members, contrary to their
explicit wishes for a witnessed cremation. On February 15, 2024, Defendant
Macera moved the Court to continue the trial date currently set for July 16,
2024, to a date after March 26, 2025. The primary reason for this request is
that Macera plans to file a motion for summary judgment and reserved the
earliest hearing date, which was February 24, 2025.  That date is well beyond the current trial
date of July 16. 2024. None of the parties involved in this action oppose this
motion.
 
Legal Standard¿and Analysis¿ 
¿ 
Although continuances of trials are
disfavored, each request for a continuance must be considered on its own
merits.¿ (CRC Rule 3.1332(c).)¿ The Court may grant a continuance only on an affirmative showing
of good cause requiring the continuance.¿ (CRC Rule 3.1332(c).) The Court may look to the following factors
in determining whether a trial continuance is warranted: (1) proximity of the
trial date; (2) whether there was any previous continuance of trial due to any
party; (3) the length of the continuance requested; (4) the availability of
alternative means to address the problem that gave rise to the motion; (5) the
prejudice that parties or witnesses will suffer as a result of the continuance;
and (6) whether trial counsel is engaged in another trial.¿ (See generally, CRC Rule 3.1332(d)(1)-(11).)¿ Additional factors for the Court to consider include: a party’s
excused inability to obtain essential testimony, documents, or other material
evidence despite diligent efforts; whether all parties have stipulated to a
continuance; and any other fact or circumstance relevant to the fair
determination of the motion or application.¿ (CRC Rule 3.1332(c), (d).)¿¿A trial court cannot refuse to hear a summary judgment motion filed
within the time limits of California Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) § 437c. (Wells
Fargo Bank, N.A. v. Superior Court (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 918, 919.)¿ 
¿¿ 
The motion for summary judgment (MSJ) in
question is scheduled for a hearing on February 24, 2025. The current trial
date is July 16, 2024. Continuing the trial date so Defendant’s motion for
summary judgment can be heard constitutes good cause. Thus, the Motion to
Continue Trial is GRANTED.  The new trial date is set for April ____, 2025
at 8:30 a.m. and all pretrial dates are continued in accordance with the
new trial date.  The Final Status Conference is continued to March __, 2025,
at 10:00 a.m.
