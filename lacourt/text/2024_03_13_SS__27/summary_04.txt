And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to compel non-party Montclair Emergency Medical Associates to comply with the defendant's notice of deposition subpoena for production of business records. The defendant served the subpoena on April 28, 2023, and Montclair failed to respond. The defendant then moved the court to compel Montclair's compliance on November 22, 2023, well beyond the 60-day deadline specified in CCP § 2025.480(b). The judge found that the motion was late and therefore denied it.
