And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on a motion for judgment on the pleadings filed by the plaintiff, Heidy Garcia, against the defendant, In-Home Support Services (IHSS). The plaintiff's motion was filed on January 29, 2024, but the court cannot determine the basis for the motion because the plaintiff states "no answers," despite the fact that an answer was filed by the defendant on February 28, 2024. The court has examined the defendant's answer and concludes that it is legally sufficient. Therefore, the court denies the plaintiff's motion for judgment on the pleadings.
