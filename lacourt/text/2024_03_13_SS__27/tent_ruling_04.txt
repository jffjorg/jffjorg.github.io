Background
On April 11, 2022, Plaintiff initiated this
auto accident lawsuit, alleging a rear-end collision by Defendant Gabriel
Carrillo, employed by Howard Roofing Company, Inc. To evaluate Plaintiff's
claims, Defendants served Notices and Deposition Subpoenas for Production of
Business Records on Plaintiff’s medical provider, Montclair Emergency Medical
Associates on April 14, 2023. Following initial objections from Plaintiff
concerning the subpoena's scope, the parties reached an agreement. On April 28,
2023, Defendants issued the finalized subpoena to Montclair, requesting medical
and billing records for specified body parts from April 16, 2010, to July 11,
2022. Montclair failed to respond to the subpoena. Consequently, on November
22, 2023, Defendant moved the Court to compel Montclair’s compliance with the
subpoena. No opposition was filed.
 
Legal Standard and Analysis
 
CCP
§ 2025.480(a) provides that “[i]f a deponent fails
to answer any question or to produce any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing under the deponent's control that is specified
in the deposition notice or a deposition subpoena, the party seeking discovery
may move the court for an order compelling that answer or production.”
CCP § 2025.480 includes a time limit. If a nonparty
disobeys a deposition subpoena, the subpoenaing party may seek a court order
compelling the nonparty to comply with the subpoena within 60 days after
completion of the deposition
record. (CCP § 2025.480(b); Unzipped
Apparel, LLC v. Bader (2007) 156 CA4th 123, 127.) The deposition record is
“complete” either on the date documents are specified for production or on the
date objections are served. (Board of Registered Nursing v. Sup.Ct. (Johnson
& Johnson) (2021) 59 Cal. App. 5th 1011, 1032-1033.) 
 
Defendants’ most
recent subpoena was served on April 28, 2023. (Exhibit A.) Plaintiff did not
object to the subpoena. Under the April 28 2023 subpoena, Montclair was ordered
to produce the business records by May 26, 2023. (Exhibit A.) Since no
objection was filed, the 60-day deadline is calculated from May 26, 2023, the
date the documents were specified for production. (Board of Registered
Nursing v. Sup.Ct. (Johnson & Johnson) (2021) 59 CA5th 1011,
1032-1033.) The deadline to file a motion to compel was therefore July 25,
2023. However, the present motion was filed on November 22, 2023, well beyond
the 60-day deadline. Thus, the present motion is late and therefore DENIED.
