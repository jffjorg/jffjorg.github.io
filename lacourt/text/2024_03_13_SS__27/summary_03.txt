And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion to continue the trial date from July 16, 2024, to April ____, 2025, at 8:30 a.m. The motion was unopposed by all parties involved in the action. The reason for the continuance is that the defendant, Macera Crematory, plans to file a motion for summary judgment and needs more time to prepare for the hearing, which is scheduled for February 24, 2025. The judge has considered the factors for granting a continuance, including proximity of the trial date, whether there was any previous continuance of trial, the length of the continuance requested, and whether trial counsel is engaged in another trial. The judge has also taken into account the additional factor that the motion for summary judgment must be heard within the time limits of California Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) ยง 437c.
