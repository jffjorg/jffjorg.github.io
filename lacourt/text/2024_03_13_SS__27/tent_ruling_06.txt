Ruling:                     Plaintiff’s Motion for Judgment on The Pleadings Is DENIED
 
 
On December 11, 2023, Plaintiff, appearing in
pro per, filed a general negligence claim against Defendant IHSS. Defendant
filed an answer on February 28, 2024, denying all allegations and asserted that
the claim is barred by the statute of limitations and the Government Claims
Act. On January 29, 2024, Plaintiff filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings
against Defendant's answer. However, the court cannot determine the basis for
the motion. Plaintiff states "no answers," yet an answer was filed.
The Court has examined Defendant's answer and concludes that Defendant has
filed a legally sufficient answer.  Thus,
the present motion is DENIED.
