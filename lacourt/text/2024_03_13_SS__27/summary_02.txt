And here is a summary in English text:

Judge Lee S. Arian issued a tentative ruling in the case of YOUNATAN SAMOUHA vs KAMYAR ANSARI, et al. regarding a motion to set aside the dismissals of defendants Albert Massachi and Crystal Investments, LLC, and defendant Tal Ohana.

The plaintiff, YOUNATAN SAMOUHA, alleged that he was violently thrown by a security guard at an event hosted by the defendants on May 11, 2021. The plaintiff filed the original complaint on June 9, 2022, and an amended complaint on September 22, 2022. The defendants added Leon Group and Stranger Than Us LLC to the lawsuit on February 21, 2023.

The plaintiff dismissed defendants Albert Massachi and Crystal Investments, LLC on April 10, 2023, and defendant Tal Ohana on June 13, 2023. The plaintiff then moved to vacate these dismissals, claiming that there was an agreement with the defendants to focus the litigation on Stranger Than Us LLC and Leon Group, contingent upon the cooperation of these entities following the dismissal of Massachi, Crystal Investments, and Ohana. However, the plaintiff claims that the defendants have not engaged in meaningful settlement discussions or fulfilled their cooperation promises.

The judge denied the plaintiff's motion to vacate the dismissals of defendants Albert Massachi and Crystal Investments, LLC, finding that the motion was untimely and that the plaintiff had not demonstrated excusable neglect. However, the judge granted the plaintiff's motion to vacate the dismissal of defendant Tal Ohana, finding that the plaintiff's attorney had demonstrated negligence and that the dismissal was contrary to the agreement with the defendants.

The judge also noted that the plaintiff's attorney had acknowledged his mistake, inadvertence, or negligence in an affidavit and that the plaintiff's counsel had relied on promises from the opposing party without specific written agreement for cooperation in exchange for dismissing defendant Ohana.
