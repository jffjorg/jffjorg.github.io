And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling grants counsel's motion to withdraw as counsel for the plaintiff, citing a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship. The court notes that the situation with the plaintiff has only deteriorated since the motion was filed. The plaintiff had filed an opposition in pro per, stating they have been unable to secure alternative counsel. The court has discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw, and such a motion should be granted provided there is no prejudice to the client and it does not disrupt the orderly process of justice. The court cites Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915, in support of its decision.
