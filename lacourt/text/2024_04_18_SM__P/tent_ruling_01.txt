Counsel Lavi’s Motion to be Relieved as CounselHearing
date: 4/18/24 Daniel
Lavi, counsel for plaintiff, seeks to withdraw, citing a breakdown in the
attorney client relationship. MC-052, Declaration of Lavi. Plaintiff filed an
opposition, in pro per, stating she has been unable to secure alternative
counsel. No trial date has been set, so there is no prejudice to plaintiff. The court has
discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw, and such a motion should be
granted provided that there is no prejudice to the client and it does not
disrupt the orderly process of justice. See Ramirez
v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915. Counsel seeks
withdrawal based on a breakdown of the attorney client relationship (Lavi
decl., para. 2). Counsel states the situation with plaintiff has only
deteriorated since the motion was filed. (See Lavi decl.) 

















Counsel filed the
mandatory forms and served plaintiff and all parties. The proposed order was
submitted (MC-053). GRANTED.
