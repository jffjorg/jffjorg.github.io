And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has denied the Motion for Reconsideration filed by the Cross-Complainants (Maurice and Karen Starrantino) seeking to reconsider the Court's March 21, 2024, order sustaining Cross-Defendant Triscenic's Demurrer. The Court found that the Cross-Complainants' motion is entirely based on their arguments that the Court got the ruling wrong on the demurrer, and not on new or different facts, circumstances, or law as required by CCP § 1008(a). The Court also noted that the Settlement Agreement attached to the Cross-Complaint bars claims from the time period preceding the settlement agreement. The Court denied the motion without awarding sanctions as the evidence did not support the elements of CCP § 128.7.
