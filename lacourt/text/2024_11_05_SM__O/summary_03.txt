And here is a summary of the tentatively ruling in English:

The court grants the motion for preliminary injunction and orders the defendant, SN Servicing Corporation, to be enjoined from conducting the trustee's sale on the subject property. The court finds that the plaintiff, Attilo Armeni and Laurel Armeni, has demonstrated irreparable harm and a likelihood of prevailing on their claim for violation of Cal. Civ. Code § 2923.6.

The court finds that the defendant's denial of the plaintiff's mortgage assistance application was improper and that the plaintiff's appeal of the denial was timely and sufficient. The court also finds that the defendant's failure to offer the plaintiff a loan modification or workout plan as required by Cal. Civ. Code § 2923.6(b) was a violation of the statute.

The court orders the plaintiff to post an undertaking of $1,847.93 per month during the course of litigation to ensure that the defendant will not sustain any damages as a result of the injunction. The court also grants the motion for preliminary injunction and orders the defendant to be enjoined from conducting the trustee's sale on the subject property.

The court's ruling is based on the following facts: the plaintiff owned the property since 1999 and took out a first-position loan with Countrywide Bank in 2006. The defendant became the loan servicer at some point thereafter. The plaintiff filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy in 2019 and the bankruptcy was terminated in 2020. The plaintiff submitted a request for mortgage assistance to the defendant in 2024, which was denied. The plaintiff appealed the denial and submitted a new loss mitigation application, which was also denied.
