And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The plaintiff, Adrienne Edelstein, has filed a motion for trial preference under CCP § 36(a) due to her age and alleged health issues. However, the court finds that the plaintiff's counsel, Greyson Goody, does not provide a declaration satisfying the statutory requirement of CCP § 35(a). Specifically, Goody's declaration does not directly state the impact of the plaintiff's health on her interest in the litigation. The court notes that CCP § 36(a) requires a showing that the party's health is such that a preference is necessary to prevent prejudicing the party's interest in the litigation. The court denies the plaintiff's motion for trial preference without prejudice, citing the lack of a sufficient declaration and the need for a more specific showing of the impact of the plaintiff's health on her interest in the litigation.
