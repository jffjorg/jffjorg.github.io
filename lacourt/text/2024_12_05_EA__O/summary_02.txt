- "The substance of an injunction, not its form, determines whether it is mandatory or prohibitory." (Opp.)
- "Solicitation of signatures entails more active participation by the patrons (i.e., engaging with the activist and reading and signing papers) whereas leafletting would not require active participation by a patron." (Judge's statement)
- "There is insufficient/no evidence that Plaintiff's activities are causing a substantial disruption, a blanket ban is unconstitutional." (Judge's statement)

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a request from a plaintiff who is seeking to distribute leaflets at shopping centers. The plaintiff is unemployed and is asking that a bond be waived, which the judge grants. The judge also notes that the plaintiff's leaflet is attached to a declaration from a marketing expert, which includes altered spelling to avoid censorship algorithms.

The judge concludes that the relief sought by the plaintiff is a mandatory injunction, rather than a prohibitory one, because it requires the defendant to alter its rules on content-neutral speech. The judge also finds that the plaintiff's activities are not causing a substantial disruption and that a blanket ban on leafleting is unconstitutional.

The judge references several cases, including Pruneyard, Davenport, and Daly, to support their conclusion. The judge also notes that the plaintiff's activities have been reported by some, but not many, customers/patrons and that the plaintiff is seeking to talk with a class of individuals who do not form the majority of those who visit the shopping centers.

Overall, the judge's tentative ruling suggests that the plaintiff's request for leafleting permission will be granted, but with some limitations.
