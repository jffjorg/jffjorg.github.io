SUMMARY
OF ACTION
On
September 10, 2022, plaintiff Carlos Valdez moved into an apartment building
owned and/or managed by defendants ASB Watermarke Owner, LLC, A Delaware
Corporation, with the assistance of a Section 8 voucher. Plaintiff provided a
security deposit and a September 10, 2022, was scheduled. Plaintiff maintains Defendant
improperly represented Plaintiff’s qualification for the rental via acceptance
of the Section 8 certificate, and/or a promise to submit the required paperwork
with the relevant compliance agency(ies). According to Plaintiff, both parties
maintain the other was responsible for establishing compliance and
participation into the Section 8 program. Apparently, no payments were made,
and Plaintiff was subsequently residing in an unaffordable unit, thereby
leading to an unlawful detainer action (23STUD02401).
 
On
June 16, 2023, Plaintiff, in pro per, filed complaint for Negligent
Misrepresentation. On July 21, 2023, Plaintiff, in pro per, filed a first amended
complaint for Negligent Misrepresentation, Intentional Infliction of Mental
Distress, and Source of Income Discrimination.
 
RULING: Granted.
Defendant ASB Watermarke Owner, LLC, A Delaware Corporation
(ASB), moves to quash service of the summons and complaint on grounds of
invalid service. Defendant contends the “UPS mail” to Todd A. Brisco APC, was
both never received by Brisco, and Brisco is only counsel on the unlawful
detainer cause and not an authorized agent for service of ASB. The court
electronic filing system shows no opposition or reply at the time of the
tentative ruling publication cutoff.
 
A plaintiff has the initial burden to establish valid
statutory service of a summons and complaint. (Summers
v. McClanahan (2006) 140 Cal.App.4th 403,
413; Dill v. Berquist Const. Co.,
Inc. (1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 1426, 1439-40; Floveyor Internat. v. Sup. Ct. (1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 789, 794.) The
proof of service was filed on November 7, 2023, and indicates service on ABS
“via UPS mail” on June 17, 2023. The receipt indicates the recipient as Todd
Brisco on June 19, 2023. Counsel denies it is an agent for service of the ASB
entity. [Declaration of Veronica Guzman.]
 
Any and all lawfully operating
corporations in the State of California must present an agent for service.
(Corp. Code, §§ 1502, 1505, 16310.) Service on a
corporate entity is required to be completed on the agent for service. (Code Civ.
Proc., §§ 17701.16.) Plaintiff was required to execute proper service on the
proper agent/entity. (Code Civ. Proc., 415.10, et seq.)
 
The service of process is therefore determined invalid. The
unopposed motion is granted.
 
The court will set further dates at the concurrent Case
Management Conference.
 
Defendant
to provide notice.
