And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the defendant's motion to quash service of the summons and complaint. The plaintiff, Carlos Valdez, alleges that the defendant, ASB Watermarke Owner, LLC, A Delaware Corporation, improperly represented his qualification for a rental unit and that he was subsequently living in an unaffordable unit. The plaintiff filed a complaint for Negligent Misrepresentation and a first amended complaint alleging Intentional Infliction of Mental Distress and Source of Income Discrimination.

The defendant contends that the service of the summons and complaint was invalid because the "UPS mail" was never received by the attorney, Todd A. Brisco, who is only counsel on the unlawful detainer cause and not an authorized agent for service of the ASB entity. The court finds that a plaintiff has the initial burden to establish valid statutory service of a summons and complaint, and that the proof of service filed on November 7, 2023, indicates service on ASB "via UPS mail" on June 17, 2023, but the receipt indicates the recipient as Todd Brisco on June 19, 2023.

The court concludes that any and all lawfully operating corporations in the State of California must present an agent for service, and that service on a corporate entity is required to be completed on the agent for service. Therefore, the service of process is determined invalid, and the unopposed motion is granted.
