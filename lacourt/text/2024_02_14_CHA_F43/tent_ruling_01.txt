SUMMARY OF
ACTION AND ANALYSIS
 
In this case,
the parties settled in Plaintiff’s favor. After Defendants failed to follow the
terms of the settlement agreement, judgment was entered in Plaintiff’s favor on
May 30, 2023, though there has been some dispute as to the necessity of the
judgment. 
 
As the
prevailing party on contracts containing provisions for attorney fees, in this
case a commercial lease, Plaintiff is entitled to attorney fees. Plaintiffs
filed this motion pursuant to Civ. Code § 1717, which allows for the recovery
of attorney fees when a contract contains a fees provision. Both the lease
between the parties and the settlement agreement allowed for the recovery of
attorney fees for the prevailing party.
 
Plaintiff is
requesting $14,052.50 in attorney fees from Defendant ($12,265.00 for the invoices
through March 31, 2023, plus an expected $1,787.50 related to the judgment and
this motion). (Park Decl., ¶ 13.) Plaintiff argues that the attorney fees that it
has requested were reasonable and necessary. Plaintiff’s attorney’s hourly rate
has been $275.00 an hour throughout this action. (Park Decl., ¶ 9.)
 
A prevailing
party is entitled to recover its attorneys’ fees when authorized by contract,
statute, or law. (See CCP § 1033.5(a)(10); Cal. Civ. Code § 1717(a).) “A successful
party means a prevailing party, and [a party] may be considered prevailing
parties for attorney’s fees purposes if they succeed on any significant issue
in litigation which achieves some of the benefit the parties sought in bringing
suit.” (Bowman v. City of Berkeley (2005) 131 Cal.App.4th 173, 178.)
 
Plaintiff is
the prevailing party by virtue of the fact that the parties settled in
Plaintiff’s favor. Plaintiff has requested a total of $14,052.50 in attorney
fees.
 
Given the
nature of the case, the Court finds that the amount of attorney fees requested
by Plaintiff is reasonable. Additionally, the Court does not find that
Plaintiff’s hourly rates were unreasonable. No adjustment will be made to the
amount request by Plaintiff. 
 
Plaintiff’s
motion for attorney fees is granted in the amount of $14,052.50.
 
Defendants are
ordered to pay $14,052.50 to Plaintiff’s attorney within 30 days.
