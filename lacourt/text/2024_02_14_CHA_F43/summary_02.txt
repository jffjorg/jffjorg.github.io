And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the motion for leave to file a third amended complaint filed by the plaintiffs, Albert Hughes, III, and Sabrina Crawford. The plaintiffs seek to add a new cause of action to their complaint and request damages. The defendants, Laura De Leon and FF Properties LP, and the Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company, have opposed the motion, arguing that the amendments have no merit and would be subject to demurrer, and that the Northwestern Mutual would be prejudiced by the amended complaint.

The court has found that the defendants have failed to show how they would be prejudiced by allowing the plaintiffs to amend their complaint. The court has also noted that the trial date has not been set, so the trial would not be delayed.

The court has also pointed out that the defendants' arguments that the plaintiffs' additions are without merit are not something to be decided in a motion for leave to amend. The court has granted the motion, but noted that the plaintiffs' motion for leave to amend must also meet certain procedural requirements, including providing page, paragraph, and line numbers for the deleted and added allegations. The court has found that the plaintiffs have met these requirements.

The court has taken off calendar any demurrers to the second amended complaint and has ordered the moving party to give notice.
