And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The defendant, Aviana Macias, moves to strike the portions of the plaintiff's complaint requesting punitive and exemplary damages. The defendant argues that the plaintiff's complaint does not contain allegations that adequately support the claim for punitive damages against any named defendant as a matter of law. The court denies the defendant's motion to strike. The court finds that the plaintiff has pled sufficient facts to support a claim for punitive damages, including that the defendant followed the plaintiff to her car, yelled at her, and accused her of trying to steal. The court concludes that these allegations are sufficient for a jury to potentially find that the assault, battery, and intentional infliction of emotional distress claims were committed with oppression or malice.
