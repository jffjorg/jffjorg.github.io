Case No. 23GDCV02452
Trial Date: UNSET
Case Name: WENDERSON ALEXANDRINO, an individual; v. FCA US LLC, a Delaware
Limited Liability Company, and DOES 1-10, inclusive
TENTATIVE
RULING – COMPEL RESPONSES 
BACKGROUND
Plaintiff, Wenderson Alexandrino, filed a Complaint on 11/17/2023
alleging three causes of action for: (1) Violation of Song-Beverly Act – Breach
of Express Warranty; (2) Violation of Song-Beverly Act – Breach of Implied
Warranty; and (3) Violation of the Song-Beverly Act Section 1793.2.
 
RELIEF REQUESTED¿ 
Plaintiff, Wenderson Alexandrino, moves for an order to compel responses,
without objections, to Plaintiff’s Requests for Production of Documents, Set
One. Plaintiff’s Requests for Production of Documents, Set One, was initially
served and propounded on Defendant by Plaintiff on January 9, 2024.
 
This Motion is made pursuant to
California Code of Civil Procedure, sections 2033.280, 2023.010, and 2023.030
on the basis that Plaintiff properly served upon Defendant, Requests for
Production of Documents, Set One, and Defendant has failed to serve timely
responses. Plaintiff’s RFPs seek information directly relevant and material to
their claims under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act. Thus, Plaintiff
seeks an order compelling Defendant to produce responses, without objections,
within 10 calendar days of the Court’s order.

LEGAL
STANDARD – COMPEL RESPONSES, INSPECTION DEMANDS
Within
30 days after service of a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or
sampling, the party to whom the demand is directed shall serve the original of
the response to it on the party making the demand, and a copy of the response
on all other parties who have appeared in the action, unless on motion of the
party making the demand, the court has shortened the time for response, or
unless on motion of the party to whom the demand has been directed, the court
has extended the time for response. (CCP §2031.260(a).)
If a party to whom a demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling is directed fails to serve a timely response to it, the
party making the demand may move for an order compelling response to the
demand. (CCP §2031.300(b).)
If a party to whom a demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling is directed fails to serve a timely response to it, the
party to whom the demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is
directed waives any objection to the demand, including one based on privilege
or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section
2018.010). (CCP §2031.300(a).) “The court, on motion, may relieve that
party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following
conditions are satisfied: (1) The party has subsequently served a response that
is in substantial compliance with Sections 2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230,
2031.240, and 2031.280. (2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response was
the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.” (CCP
§2031.300(a)(1)-(2).)
Unlike a motion to compel further responses, a motion
to compel responses is not subject to a 45-day time limit, and the propounding
party does not have to demonstrate either good cause or that it satisfied a
“meet and confer” requirement. (Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v.
Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 404
citing Weil and Brown, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (The
Rutter Group 2006) ¶¶8:1137 to 8:1144, pp. 8F-59 to 8F-60, ¶¶ 8:1483 to 8:1489,
pp. 8H-29 to hH-30 (Weil & Brown).)
 
TENTATIVE RULING 
On January 9, 2024,
Plaintiff served Requests for Production of Documents, Set One. (Sogoyan Decl.
¶8.) Plaintiff’s counsel emailed Defendant’s counsel a meet and confer on March
11, 2024 about overdue responses and how objections were waived. (Sogoyan Decl.
¶12.) As of the date of Plaintiff’s counsel’s declaration contained in
Plaintiff’s motion [March 22, 2024, see Sogoyan Declaration ¶14], Plaintiff’s
counsel has not received responses. (Sogoyan Decl. ¶10.)

Defendant’s
counsel submitted an untimely Opposition on 4/24/2024. The Court will utilize
its discretion and consider the untimely Opposition.
 
In Opposition, Defendant’s
counsel [Vanessa Van Dao] states that responses were served to the instant
discovery request on April 22, 2024. [Confusingly, although Dao states that responses
were served on April 22, 2024, Exhibit A attached to the Opposition appears to
show that responses were served on April 10, 2024.] Either way, responses were
served after the instant motion was filed on March 22, 2024.
 
Defendant has a
section in its Opposition discussing the reason for its untimely responses and
how it can have relief from waiver of objections because its served responses
that were substantially compliant, and its failure to timely respond was due to
mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. Defendant appears to be under the
assumption that it can be relieved from waiver of objections based on its
Opposition; however, this is incorrect. Whether or not Defendant is relieved
from its waiver of objections, Defendant would have to file a separate motion
for relief from waiver of objections under CCP §2031.300(a)(1)-(2).
 
Since Defendant
has served responses to the instant discovery, Plaintiff’s motion is DENIED as
moot; however, the issue of sanctions is not moot since the responses were
provided after the filing of this motion.
 
 
 
Sanctions – RFPs
CCP § 2031.300(c) states:
Except as provided
in subdivision (d), the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to a demand for
inspection, copying, testing, or sampling, unless it finds that the one subject
to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.
 
(CCP § 2031.300(c).)
 
“The court may award sanctions under the Discovery Act
in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery, even though no
opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to the motion was withdrawn,
or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party after the motion
was filed.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1348(a).) 
 
Sanctions Ruling


The Court will
hear from the parties regarding sanctions.
