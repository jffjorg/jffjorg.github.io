And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling on a summary judgment motion filed by Cross-Defendant and Cross-Complainant, Rika Corporation dba Diversified Metalworks, against Defendant, Cross-Complainant, and Cross-Defendant, Kern Steel Fabrication, Inc. The motion is based on Labor Code §3864, which requires a written agreement between the employer and the third person (in this case, Kern) prior to the injury. The court has considered the opposition papers and finds that Diversified established that the clear language of §3864 bars Kern's claims against Diversified. The court grants the motion for summary judgment in favor of Diversified and orders Diversified to give notice.
