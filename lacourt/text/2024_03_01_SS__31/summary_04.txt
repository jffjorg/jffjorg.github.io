And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's unopposed motion to compel a third physical examination of the plaintiff with Dr. Kaloostian, a neurosurgeon. The motion was filed on November 17, 2023, and no opposition was filed. The examination is limited to the plaintiff's alleged spinal injury, which is in controversy in the action. The judge construes the plaintiff's failure to oppose as consent to the granting of the motion. The parties are ordered to meet and confer to determine the date and time for the examination, and the plaintiff is required to appear for the examination.
