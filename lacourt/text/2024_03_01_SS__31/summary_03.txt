And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to compel compliance with the subpoena for Plaintiff's medical records without prejudice. The defendant had sought to compel the VA Long Beach Healthcare System to produce the records, but the judge found that the defendant had not properly served the VA Long Beach with the motion. The judge also noted that the VA Long Beach refused to comply with the subpoena without a signed authorization form from the plaintiff. The judge encourages the parties to meet and confer to see if they can reach an agreement, and advises them to submit any objections or disagreements in writing or orally.
