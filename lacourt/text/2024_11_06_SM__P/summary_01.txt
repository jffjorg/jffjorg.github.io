```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the defendant Joseph Rubin's request to bifurcate the claims against him from those against his father, Stuart Rubin, or in the alternative, permission to file a motion for summary judgment (MSJ). The court has also considered the plaintiff Gary Stiffelman's opposition to bifurcation.

The court has determined that there is a significant risk of overlap and inefficiency should the claims be bifurcated, as many witnesses would be necessary for trial and there would be potential duplication of effort. The court has also found that Joseph's assertion that the claims against him could be litigated in three days is unrealistic, given the anticipated 35.5 to 73 hours of witness testimony.

As a result, the court has declined to bifurcate the claims, but has allowed Joseph to file a motion for summary judgment. The court has given Joseph 30 days to prepare his papers, assuming that he can complete them within that time frame.
