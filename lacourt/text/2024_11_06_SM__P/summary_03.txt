And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering an ex parte application by ACRL 100, LLC (plaintiff) for a temporary restraining order and an order to show cause re: preliminary injunction against J. J. Pacific Investment Co. and AC Investment Group (defendants). The plaintiff seeks to preserve access to its parking lot, which it claims is via a prescriptive easement over the defendants' property. The defendants argue that the plaintiff's use of their property is not open and notorious, but rather a neighborly accommodation.

The court finds that the parties offer contradictory declarations regarding the existence of a prescriptive easement and the length of the plaintiff's use of the defendant's property. The court also notes that the defendants have installed bollards and chains to prevent access to their parking lot, and that the plaintiff has only recently begun to use the lot in the way that it claims is adverse.

The court concludes that there are no exigent circumstances necessitating ex parte relief, and therefore denies the plaintiff's application.
