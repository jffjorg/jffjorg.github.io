And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the defendant's motion to set aside the default. The defendant, Mary Gallardo, had argued that she never received notice of the lawsuit due to allegedly defective substitute service on her son, Robert Gallardo. However, the defendant failed to provide declarations from herself and her son as ordered by the court, and her defense counsel, Stein, failed to comply with court orders and submitted a supplemental declaration that included hearsay statements. The court had previously ordered the defendant to provide information about her whereabouts on the date of service and the date she learned of the lawsuit, as well as a declaration from her son regarding service. Despite these orders, the defendant failed to provide the required information, leading the court to deny the motion to set aside the default.
