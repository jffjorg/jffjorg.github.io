Here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has granted the defendant's motion to compel plaintiff's response to Form Interrogatories, Set One. The defendant served the interrogatories on May 4, 2023, and granted a three-week extension on June 6, 2023. Despite the extension, the plaintiff has not responded. The court finds that the plaintiff has failed to respond to discovery requests and has waived all objections. The court also awards the defendant monetary sanctions in the amount of $315, which represents 1.5 hours of attorney time. The plaintiff and her counsel of record are jointly and severally liable for the sanctions. The court orders the plaintiff to serve properly verified responses, without objections, to the Form Interrogatories, Set One, within 30 days. The defendant is to provide notice and file a proof of service of the sanctions.
