Here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The court grants the motion to set aside the dismissal of the complaint. The case was dismissed on December 7, 2023, due to Plaintiffs' counsel's failure to properly calendar the trial-related dates. However, this failure constitutes excusable neglect, and the court finds that the motion is timely and has been properly served. The court grants the motion and sets the matter for an Order to Show Cause re Dismissal and/or Monetary Sanctions for Failure to Enter Default on June 11, 2024 at 8:30 a.m. in Department 32 of the Spring Street Courthouse.
