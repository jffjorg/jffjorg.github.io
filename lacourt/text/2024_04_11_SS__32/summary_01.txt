And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the motion to relieve counsel, Nathan S. Miller, from representing plaintiff Alexander Ramirez. The judge found that the motion was not properly served and that the counsel did not provide sufficient notice of the hearing. The judge also noted that the counsel listed the incorrect Court address on the moving papers and did not confirm the plaintiff's address. The judge stated that the counselor must take reasonable steps to avoid reasonably foreseeable prejudice to the client's interests and must comply with the rules of professional conduct. The judge denied the motion to relieve counsel, and the counselor is required to provide notice of the court's ruling and file proofs of service.
