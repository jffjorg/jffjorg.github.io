And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has decided to continue the hearing on Plaintiff Benjamin Avi Harris' Application for Default Judgment to a date to be determined. The judge has several concerns about the application, including the lack of a declaration of non-military service, a proposed judgment, and a breakdown of the costs sought in the memorandum of costs. The judge also questions the basis for the $37,900 in compensatory damages claimed by the plaintiff. Additionally, the judge finds that the plaintiff has failed to prove that he is entitled to emotional distress damages, as he does not provide sufficient evidence to support his claims. The judge orders the plaintiff to amend his default judgment package to cure these deficiencies before the hearing.
