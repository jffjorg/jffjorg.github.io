Here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied Defendant Talmadge Johnson's motion to continue the trial date, which includes resetting the discovery cutoff date. The judge found that there is no good cause to continue the trial, as trial has already been continued once and Defendant had already had an opportunity to obtain counsel. The judge also noted that Defendant's lack of preparedness for trial due to insufficient information is not a basis to continue the trial. The judge cited California Rules of Court, rules 3.1332(b), (c), and (d), and relevant case law to support the denial of the motion.
