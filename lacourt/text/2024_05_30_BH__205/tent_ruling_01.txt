  Case Number:  22SMCV00766    Hearing Date:   May 30, 2024    Dept:  205 HEARING DATE:  May 30, 2024 JUDGE/DEPT:  Moreton/Beverly Hills, 205 CASE NAME: Strategic Funding Source, Inc. v. Santa Monica Observer Newspaper d/b/a Santa Monica Observer/Signature Filing, et al. CASE NUMBER:  22SMCV00766  COMP. FILED:  May 26, 2022    PROCEEDINGS:  REQUEST FOR ENTRY OF DEFAULT JUDGMENT MOVING PARTY:  Strategic Funding Source, Inc. RESPONDING PARTY: Santa Monica Observer Newspaper, SNMC LLC and David Ganezer BACKGROUND This case arises from a breach of a loan agreement.  Plaintiff Strategic Funding Source, Inc. entered into two written loan agreements with Defendants Santa Monica Observer Newspaper, SNMC LLC and David Ganezer.  One agreement was entered on August 31, 2021 for $32,300 (“August Agreement”) and another on October 18, 2021 for $6,000 (“October Agreement”, and collectively the “Agreements”).  Ganezer executed the Agreements in his capacity as owner of Santa Monica Observer Newspaper and SNMC LLC and in his individual capacity as personal guarantor.    Under the August Agreement, Defendants were required to make available for automatic withdrawal a weekly payment of $254.  Under the October Agreement, Defendants were required to make available for automatic withdrawal a weekly payment of $48.   Defendants defaulted on the Agreements by (1) violating one or more terms, covenants and conditions of the Agreements, (2) making false, incorrect, incomplete or misleading representations or warranties in the Agreements, and (3) failing to pay all sums due and owing under the Agreements.  This action ensued.   On May 26, 2022, Plaintiff filed a Complaint against Defendants.  The Complaint alleges four claims for (1) breach of contract-August Agreement, (2) breach of contract-October Agreement, (3) breach of contract (Guaranty)-August Agreement, and (4) breach of contract (Guaranty)-October Agreement.   Plaintiff filed a proof of service showing Defendants were personally served on June 8, 2022.  Plaintiff successfully requested the entry of Defendants’ default, which was entered by the Clerk’s Office on July 20, 2022, March 13, 2023 and August 28, 2023.  Plaintiff requested a default judgment on April 24, 2024.  Plaintiff served Defendants by mail with both the Request for Entry of Default and Request for Default Judgment.    RELIEF REQUESTED  Default judgment against Defendants for $39,196.84 consisting of (1) damages in the amount of $31,959, (2) interest of $5,279.80, (3) attorneys’ fees of $1,348.77, and (4) costs of $609.27.    ANALYSIS  Code Civ. Proc. § 585 sets forth the two options for obtaining a default judgment. First, where the plaintiff’s complaint¿seeks compensatory damages only, in a sum certain which is readily ascertainable from the allegations of the complaint or statement of damages, the clerk may enter the default judgment for that amount. However, if the relief requested in the complaint is more complicated, consisting of either nonmonetary relief, or monetary relief in amounts which require either an accounting, additional evidence, or the exercise of judgment to ascertain, the plaintiff must request entry of judgment by the court. In such cases, the plaintiff must affirmatively establish his entitlement to the specific judgment requested.¿ (Kim v. Westmoore Partners, Inc. (2011) 201 Cal.App.4th 267, 287.) Section 585 also allows for interest, costs and attorney fees, where otherwise allowed by law. (Code of Civ. Proc. § 585(a).)  Multiple specific documents are required, such as: (1) form CIV 100, (2) a brief summary of the case; (3) declarations or other admissible evidence in support of the judgment requested; (4) interest computations as necessary; (5) a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (6) a proposed form of judgment; (7) a dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application for separate judgment under Code Civ. Proc. § 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment; (8) exhibits as necessary; and (9) a request for attorneys’ fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.  (CRC Rule 3.1800.)  Here, Plaintiff has properly complied with the requirements for a default judgment. Substantively, Plaintiff declares via declaration that Defendants have defaulted by failing to make payments due under the Agreements.  The supporting evidence (the Agreements and Merchant Statement) is authenticated by declaration.  Plaintiff seeks interest in the amount of $5,279.87 which calculation is supported by declaration.  Plaintiff seeks attorneys fees pursuant to Section 3.3 of the Agreements, and the calculation of the attorneys’ fees (for $1,347.87) is supported by declaration.  Plaintiff also seeks costs of $609.27 which is supported by declaration and itemized in item 7 of CIV-100 form.  Procedurally, Plaintiff properly served Defendants more than 30 days prior to requesting entry of default and default judgment, correctly completed JC Form CIV-100 in a manner that would not void or put at issue the entry of default, provided a declaration of non-military status, requested dismissal of the fictitious defendants, and filed a proposed judgment (JUD-100).   As default has already been entered, default judgment is appropriate here.   CONCLUSION AND ORDER   For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff Strategic Funding Source, Inc.’s Request for Default Judgment against Defendants Santa Monica Observer Newspaper, SNMC LLC and David Ganezer is GRANTED.  Judgment is awarded in favor of Plaintiff in the amount of $39,196.84. The Order to Show Cause is discharged.
