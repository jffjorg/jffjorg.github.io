And here is a brief summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the cross-defendants' demurrer to the cross-complaint's third through sixth causes of action. The Judge has sustained the demurrer as to the third cause of action for concealment without leave to amend, finding that the claims are barred by the economic loss rule. The Judge has overruled the demurrer as to the third and fourth causes of action for misrepresentation, finding that the claims are pleaded with specificity and that Mason has alleged actual reliance on Hexadyne's misrepresentations. The Judge has also overruled the demurrer as to the sixth cause of action for false promise, finding that the claim is specific and alleges Hexadyne's promise to solicit orders from customers in Japan with no intention to perform. The Judge has denied the motion to strike, as it is premised on the sustaining of the demurrer to Mason's fraud claims, but the demurrer has been overruled as to some of Mason's fraud claims.
