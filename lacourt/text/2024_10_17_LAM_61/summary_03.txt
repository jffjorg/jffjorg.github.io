And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

This tentative ruling denies Defendant Mohamed Aboselim's demurrer and motion to dismiss the complaint filed by Plaintiff Zoleta Frison-Randler. The court finds that the complaint is sufficient as it stands and that the demurrer and motion to dismiss are flawed. The Defendant argues that the Plaintiff lacks standing to prosecute the agreement due to a prior adjudication in Gossai v. Frison-Randler, but the court finds that there was no final decision on the merits in the prior action. The court also finds that the Defendant's arguments regarding ill-pleaded breach of contract and lack of jurisdiction are without merit. The court concludes that the demurrer and motion to dismiss are therefore overruled and denied.
