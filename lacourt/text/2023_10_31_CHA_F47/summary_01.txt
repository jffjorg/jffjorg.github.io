And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion for summary judgment, ruling that the plaintiff's breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing claims have no merit. The court found that the plaintiff's refusal to accept the assignment to fill its water tanker with fire retardant excused the defendant's further performance under the contract, and that the defendant had no obligation to reassign the plaintiff or use its services for the duration of the Dixie Fire. The court also found that the plaintiff's breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing cause of action was essentially the same as its breach of contract claim, and that the defendant's conduct did not deviate from socially useful business practices in a way that would justify tort liability.
