Defendants Kirk Aguilera, Gordon Fraser, Carter Herrin, Kevin Honaker,
Nick Hoover, Carmen Josef, Josh Mozer, Ricardo Oropeza, Rudy Quintana and Leidy
Rivera’s Unopposed Motion for Leave to File a Cross-Complaint is GRANTED and
shall be efiled within 10 days.Introduction Defendants Kirk Aguilera, Gordon Fraser, Carter Herrin,
Kevin Honaker, Nick Hoover, Carmen Josef, Josh Mozer, Ricardo Oropeza, Rudy
Quintana and Leidy Rivera (collectively, Defendants) moved for leave to file
the Proposed Cross-Complaint (PXC) against Plaintiffs Brown & Brown, Inc.
and Hays Companies, Inc. (collectively, Plaintiffs).  Plaintiffs filed a notice of non-opposition
on February 28, 2024.Discussion Defendants argued that the PXC is compulsory and the motion
was made in good faith.  Defendants
provided that the claims in the PXC are related to the claims in the underlying
complaint because Plaintiffs are maintaining the claims regarding alleged
violations of the non-solicitation clauses in the employment agreement despite
passage of law making the prosecution of same unlawful.  (Bus. & Prof. Code, secs. 16600, 16600.1,
16600.5.)  Defendants asserted that they
bring the motion in good faith.  Based
upon these unopposed contentions, the Court finds good cause for the requested
relief.











The motion for leave to file the PXC is GRANTED.
