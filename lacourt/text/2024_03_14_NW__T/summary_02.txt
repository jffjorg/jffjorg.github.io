Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion filed by defendants Kirk Aguilera, Gordon Fraser, Carter Herrin, Kevin Honaker, Nick Hoover, Carmen Josef, Josh Mozer, Ricardo Oropeza, Rudy Quintana, and Leidy Rivera to file a cross-complaint against the plaintiffs, Brown & Brown, Inc. and Hays Companies, Inc. The motion was unopposed by the plaintiffs, and the judge has granted the motion, allowing the defendants to file their cross-complaint within 10 days. The cross-complaint is related to the claims in the underlying complaint and alleges that the plaintiffs are maintaining claims regarding alleged violations of non-solicitation clauses in employment agreements despite the passage of law making the prosecution of such claims unlawful.
