And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has made a tentative ruling in the case of T Lewis v Financial Bonanza. The Judge has reviewed the documents and has decided not to continue the default hearing. If the plaintiff wishes to proceed solely on the basis of the documents, they can inform the court at the ex parte hearing on March 14, 2024, and the court will take it under submission. Otherwise, the hearing will go forward as scheduled on March 15, 2024, at 3 p.m. or at an alternative time of 1:30 or 2 p.m. The Judge has also denied the request for a statement of decision, citing CCP 632, which only applies to trials of fact. The request for punitive damages, which is included in the first amended complaint, will be considered along with other evidence presented in support of the default judgment.
