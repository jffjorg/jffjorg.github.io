  - "Because the agreement requires 'non-binding' arbitration, the Court is not authorized to enforce the agreement per Code of Civil Procedure section 1281.2 because there is no finality and it is not a binding decision."
  - "Monetary sanctions under this statute are required to be made separately from any other motion or request to the court."

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case between Linda Nguyen, an individual, and Sky Zone, LLC and SZ Socal, LLC, dba Sky Zone Van Nuys, fka SZ Van Nuys Capital Partners, LLC. The defendants moved to compel arbitration and stay the action, and also requested attorneys' fees and/or sanctions. The plaintiff, Linda Nguyen, requested sanctions under Code of Civil Procedure sections 128.5 and 128.7.

The judge ruled that the defendants' motion to compel arbitration and stay the action is denied because the defendants' "arbitration" agreement requires "non-binding" arbitration, which does not meet the requirements for an enforceable arbitration agreement. The judge also ruled that the defendants' request for attorneys' fees and costs is denied because the defendants are not the prevailing parties on the motion to compel arbitration.

The judge also denied the parties' requests for sanctions under Code of Civil Procedure sections 128.5 and 128.7 because the requests were made within the moving and opposing papers and not separately made, and because the parties failed to comply with the 21-day safe harbor rule. The judge noted that the defendants' request for sanctions under Code of Civil Procedure section 128.5 is also improper because it was not made separately from other requests to the court and did not provide proper notice and opportunity to be heard.
