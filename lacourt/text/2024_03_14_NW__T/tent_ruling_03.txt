 Case Number:  23VECV01451    Hearing Date:   March 14, 2024    Dept:  T 23VECV01451
THEYS V DIMATTIA
Tentative
ruling:  Ex parte application to continue
the trial is denied. NO GOOD CAUSE SHOWN.  The court will hear the MSJ on 4/12/2024 (which
is 74 days from the filing of the MSJ) and continue the FSC to the date of the
trial on 4/25/2024. 
The court notes
that the MSJ was filed on 1/29/2024 which was already too late for the matter
to be heard up to 30 days before trial.   Therefore, the MSJ was untimely when it was
filed. 
The court
had multiple open slots for MSJ between the filing and 30 days before
trial.  Even so, had moving party come in
ex parte, the court would have special set the MSJ.  The maximum time to wait for an MSJ has been approximately
3-4 months in this department.  There
were 2 slots in April before the MSJ cutoff, neither of which was used by
defendant.
When the
court held the CMC on 11/15/2023, both counsel indicated that there would be no
problem with starting the trial as scheduled (see Minutes 11/15/2023.  Counsel were advised that the court would not
continue the trial date.  The court reminded
counsel again on 11/15/2023 that the court would not be inclined to continue
the trial date.  If counsel has conflicts
with other trials in April, then he can move those dates.
