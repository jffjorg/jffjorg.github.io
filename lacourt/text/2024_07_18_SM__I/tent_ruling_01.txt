  Case Number:  19SMCV01008    Hearing Date:   July 18, 2024    Dept:  I This matter was originally set for earlier this week, but
the court was in trial and it had to be moved. 
In the order moving the hearing, the court stated that if the new date
was not convenient for counsel, it would work with counsel to find a new
date.  The court is informed that today
is not convenient for at least some counsel (and it turns out the court is in
trial, albeit a different one).  The
court’s staff will work with counsel to find a date that works for all.  The court suggests a Friday, as the court
tends not to hear trials on that day. 
For now, the court will set a placeholder date, but the date now set is
really to make sure that a real date gets put on the calendar.
 
The court apologizes for the scheduling snafu.
