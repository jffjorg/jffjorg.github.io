And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has made a ruling on a motion filed by the defendant to strike parts of the plaintiff's request for damages. The plaintiff is seeking damages due to a breach of contract and damage to the premises. The defendant is arguing that the plaintiff did not suffer any lost rental income because the plaintiff's principal's son is occupying the premises. The judge has denied the defendant's request to strike the plaintiff's request for lost rental income, stating that it is not proper to consider extrinsic facts. The judge has also admonished the defense to tone down their rhetoric, suggesting that it may be a sign of a weak case. The judge has granted the defendant's motion to strike the plaintiff's request for lost parking income, but only in part. The judge has given the defendant 3 court days to respond to the ruling.
