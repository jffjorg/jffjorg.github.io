PURSUANT TO CCP §473(d) AND THE COURT’S

PLAINTIFF TO NOTICE. 
 
If the parties wish to submit on the
tentative, please email the courtroom at SMCdept54@lacourt.org with notice to opposing counsel
(or self-represented party) before 8:00 am on the day of the hearing.
 
These matters came before the Court on
November 21, 2024; the Court continued them for supplemental briefing on
whether the judgment entered on August 1, 2024 pursuant to Plaintiff’s Ex Parte
Application should be vacated.  Plaintiff
did not file any supplemental briefing. 
Defendant filed supplemental briefing on January 7, 2025.  Having reviewed the original moving papers,
opposition papers, reply papers and Defendant’s supplemental briefing, the
Court vacates its July 17, 2024 order granting Plaintiff’s Ex Parte Application
for Entry of Judgment, and the subsequent judgment entered on August 1,
2024.  
 
As such, Plaintiff’s Motion for
Attorney’s Fees is DENIED and Defendant’s Motion to Compel Filing of
Acknowledgment of Full Satisfaction of Judgment is DENIED.  There is no judgment in this matter that
would support an award of attorney’s fees or an Acknowledgment of Full
Satisfaction of Judgment.
 
On July 11, 2024, Plaintiff filed an Ex
Parte Application for Entry of Judgment against Defendants, pursuant to Code of
Civil Procedure §664.6.  On July 17,
2024, the Court granted the ex parte application pursuant to its authority
under section 664.6.  
 
“If parties to a pending litigation
stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties outside the presence of the court
or orally before the court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the
court, upon motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement
agreement.”  (Former CCP §664.6(a), added
by Stats. 2023, c. 478 (A.B.1756), § 12, eff. Jan. 1, 2024 and repealed and
replaced with new version on January 1, 2025 by Stats. 2023, c. 478 (A.B.1756),
§ 13, eff. Jan. 1, 2024, operative Jan. 1, 2025on January 1, 2025.)[1]  “A writing is signed by a party if it is
signed by any of the following:  (1) the
party.  (2)  An attorney who represents the party…”  (Former CCP §664.6(a), added by Stats.2023,
c. 478 (A.B.1756), § 12, eff. Jan. 1, 2024 and repealed and replaced with new
version on January 1, 2025 by Stats.2023, c. 478 (A.B.1756), § 13, eff. Jan. 1,
2024, operative Jan. 1, 2025.) 
 
Prior to January 1, 2021, judgment
could only be entered pursuant to CCP §664.6 where the parties themselves signed
the settlement agreement.  (Levy v.
Supr. Ct. (1995) 10 Cal.4th 578, 586 (settlement agreement
signed by counsel could not be enforced pursuant to CCP §664.6, which required
the agreement to be signed by “litigants” themselves); Gauss v. GAF Corp. (2002)
103 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119 (“The cases following Levy have
recognized no exceptions to the rule that litigants themselves must sign a
settlement for it to be enforceable under section 664.6).)  Since CCP §664.6 was amended on January 1,
2021, judgment may be entered on a settlement agreement if signed by (1) the
party; (2) an attorney who represents the party; or (3) if the party is an
insurer, an agent who is authorized in writing by the insurer to sign on the
insurer’s behalf.  (Former CCP §664.6,
added by Stats.2020, c. 290 (A.B.2723), § 1, eff. Jan. 1, 2021 and repealed and
replaced with new version by Stats.2023, c. 478 (A.B.1756), § 12, eff. Jan. 1,
2024.)  
 
The Settlement Agreement and Release of
All Claims filed on July 11, 2024 was (1) not signed by Plaintiff Patrick
Melville, but by Steven B. Melville and (2) not signed by Defendants. Steven B.
Melville is neither a party to the action nor Plaintiff’s attorney.
 
As the Court noted in its November 21,
2024 tentative ruling, Steven B. Melville did not automatically become a party
after Plaintiff died in February 2024. 
Steven B. Melville was a non-party at the time he signed the Settlement
Agreement and is still a non-party, having never complied with the procedure
under CCP §377.30, et seq. to substitute in as the plaintiff.
 
Plaintiff failed to present any
evidence of a written settlement agreement “signed by the parties” in support
of the Ex Parte Application to Enter Judgment Against Defendants Pursuant to
CCP §664.6.  The Court had no authority
to enter judgment pursuant to CCP §664.6 on August 1, 2024.
 
The Court’s July 17, 2024 order
granting Plaintiff’s Ex Parte Application for Entry of Judgment was erroneous,
and the subsequent judgment entered on August 1, 2024 is void on its face.  The judgment is properly vacated under CCP
§473(d).  “A judgment is ... void on its
face when the invalidity is apparent upon an inspection of the judgment-roll.”  (Dill v. Berquist Construction Co.
(1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 1426, 1441.)  Whether
a judgment is void “does not hinge on evidence: A void judgment's invalidity
appears on the face of the record, including the proof of service.”  (Trackman v. Kenney (2010) 187
Cal.App.4th 175, 181.)
 
In the alternative, the Court reconsiders
its July 11, 2024 order pursuant to its inherent powers.  Having done so, the Court finds that the
Settlement Agreement is not signed by any parties to the action, as defined
under CCP §664.6.  “A trial court has
inherent power to reconsider an interim ruling on its own motion…[¶]  Furthermore, it is immaterial what may have
triggered a trial court's insight that its interim order might be erroneous.”  (Coastline JX Holdings LLC v. Bennett
(2022) 80 Cal.App.5th 985, 1000-1000.  Whether the “judge has an unprovoked flash of
understanding in the middle of the night or acts in response to a party's
suggestion, if a court believes one of its prior interim orders was erroneous,
it should be able to correct that error no matter how it came to acquire that
belief.”  (Id. (quoting Le
Francois v. Goel (2005) 35 Cal.4th 1094, 1108.)  The judgment entered on August 1, 2024 is
vacated.  
 
The prior tentative ruling issued on
November 21, 2024 is set forth below. Its the reasoning is adopted in
full.  
 
---------------------------------
 
The Court considers the moving papers,
oppositions, and replies.
 
Plaintiff
moves for an award of attorney’s fees to enforce the parties’ settlement agreement
and to enforce the judgment entered by the Court on August 1, 2024. Defendants
oppose and move to compel Plaintiff to file an acknowledgement of full
satisfaction of judgment. 
The
parties reached a settlement in May 2024, agreeing that Defendants would pay
Plaintiff $15,000.00 within 30 days. A notice of settlement was filed on May
23, 2024. Defendants sent a formal agreement. Plaintiff’s counsel returned a copy
signed not by Plaintiff, but by Plaintiff’s brother Steven Melville. Defendants
objected to this signature. Plaintiff’s counsel informed Defendants’ counsel
that Plaintiff had died several months prior, and that Steven Melville was
Plaintiff’s successor-in-interest. Defendants again objected, stating that
Melville had not filed a successor-in-interest declaration as required by CCP §
377.32. 
Two
days later, on July 11, 2024, Plaintiff filed an ex parte application to
enforce the settlement and enter judgment, claiming Defendants had breached the
agreement by failing to pay the settlement within 30 days. The Court granted
the ex parte and entered judgment on August 1, 2024. 
On
September 16, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel received a check for $15,000.00 from
Defendants. On September 30, 2024, Plaintiff filed the motion for attorney’s
fees.
Plaintiff
seeks $18,000.00 in attorney’s fees and $2,716.16 in costs to enforce the
judgment under CCP § 685.040. In opposition, Defendants assert that the motion
is untimely under CCP § 685.080 because judgment was satisfied before Plaintiff
filed the motion. Defendants also argue that they did not breach the settlement
because Plaintiff did not sign the agreement. In reply, Plaintiff asserts the
motion is timely because Defendant did not satisfy the judgment in full, having
failed to include an additional $189.06 in interest that accrued on the
judgment between August 1, 2024 and September 16, 2024.
Code
of Civil Procedure § 664.6 allows the Court enter judgment according to a
written settlement “signed by the parties outside of the presence of the
court.” “[A] writing is signed by a party if it is signed by any of the following:
(1) The party. (2) An attorney who represents the party.” (CCP § 664.6(b).)
Here, the agreement was not signed by Plaintiff, who was deceased before the
parties settled, nor by a successor-in-interest who had filed the necessary
declaration, nor by counsel. Additionally, the agreement attached to the ex
parte application to enforce the settlement does not include Defendants’
signatures or Defendants’ counsel’s signature. 
The
Court believes it may not have had authority to enforce the settlement and
enter judgment under CCP § 664.6. Code of Civil Procedure § 473(d) and the
Court’s inherent authority allow the Court set aside void judgments. (See e.g. Sec.
Pac. Nat. Bank v. Lyon (1980) 105 Cal.App.3d Supp. 8, 13, “A judgment or
order that is void on its face can be set aside on motion or on the court's own
motion at any time after its entry by the court that rendered the judgment or
made the order.”) If the judgment is void, Plaintiff is not entitled to recover
attorney’s fees and costs to enforce it, and Defendants are not required to pay
interest on it. 
The
Court requires additional briefing from the parties as to whether the judgment
should be set aside.  
The motions are CONTINUED.
