DEFENDANT TO NOTICE.
 
            The Court
considers the moving papers. No opposition has been received. 
 
A party must
respond to interrogatories and requests for production of documents within 30
days after service. (CCP § 2030.260(a); CCP § 2031.260(a).) When timely responses to interrogatories are not received,
“[t]he party propounding the interrogatories may move for an order compelling
response to the interrogatories.” (CCP § 2030.290(b).) The party also waives the right to
make any objections, including one based on privilege or work-product
protection. (CCP § 2030.290(a); CCP § 2031.300(a).)
 
            Defendant moves
to compel Plaintiff Ronal Dominguez’s responses to Form Interrogatories, Set
One. Defendant served the subject discovery on September 3, 2024. Responses
were due on October 1, 2024. As of the filing of the instant motion, Defendant
has not received responses. Plaintiff has not opposed this motion to show that
responses have been served. Accordingly, Defendant's motion to compel Plaintiff
Ronal Dominguez’s responses to Form Interrogatories, set one, is GRANTED. 
 
            Defendant
seeks $705.00 in sanctions for three hours of attorney time at $215 per hour,
plus the $60 filing fee. Defendant requests sanctions for 1.5 hours spent preparing
the motion, 0.5 hours reviewing and replying to Plaintiff’s anticipated
opposition, and 1 hour for appearance at the hearing. As Plaintiff filed no opposition,
the Court awards Defendant a reduced amount of $597.50 for 2.5 hours of work and
the $60 filing fee. Defendant’s request for sanctions is GRANTED in the amount
of $597.50.
