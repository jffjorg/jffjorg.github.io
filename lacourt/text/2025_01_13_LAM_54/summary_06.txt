The court's ruling is based on the fact that Plaintiff failed to respond to the discovery requests, despite the deadline having passed. The court notes that under California Code of Civil Procedure, a party must respond to interrogatories and requests for production of documents within 30 days after service, and that the party propounding the interrogatories may move for an order compelling response.
