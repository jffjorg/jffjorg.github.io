BACKGROUND
            
On October 3, 2024, Plaintiff
RJ Broadway LLC filed an unlawful detainer Complaint against Web Apps Agency,
LLC (WAA). On October 18, 2024 Plaintiff substituted DOE 1 for Broadway
Innovation House, Inc. (BIH). The Complaint alleges Plaintiff and Defendants
entered into a lease agreement on October 19, 2020 where Defendants would agree
to pay the rent of $8,381.00 monthly. Plaintiff alleges Defendants breached the
lease and filed this action for recovery of the premises and unpaid rent by
Defendants. 
 
Defendants filed an
Answer on November 13, 2024. The Answer was filed by Marcus Brown as pro per.
Before the Court is Plaintiff’s Motion to Strike the Answer of
Defendant Web Apps Agency LLC and Defendant Broadway Innovation House Inc (the
Motion). No opposition was filed.   
 
ANALYSIS
The court may, upon motion, or at any time in its discretion, and upon
terms it deems proper, strike any irrelevant, false, or improper matter
inserted in any pleading. (Code Civ. Proc. §436, subd. (a).) The court may also
strike all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with
the laws of this state, a court rule, or an order of the court. (Code Civ. Proc.
§436, subd. (b).) The grounds for a motion to strike are that the pleading has
irrelevant, false, or improper matter, or has not been drawn or filed in
conformity with laws. (Code Civ. Proc. §436.) The grounds for moving to strike
must appear on the face of the pleading or by way of judicial notice. (Code Civ.
Proc. §437.)
 
            Plaintiff argues
that: (a) the Answer was untimely filed in violation of Code Civ. Proc.
§1167.3; (b) Defendants failed to serve Plaintiff’s counsel; and (c) entities
cannot represent themselves. The Court agrees with each argument and grants the
Motion. 
 
            Code Civ.
Proc. §1167.3 requires that an answer be filed no more than five days after
service. Defendants were personally served with the Summons and Complaint on
October 31, 2024.Defendants’ Answer was not filed until November 13, 2024. The
Answer is untimely. 
 
            On November
13, 2024, Defendants’ pro per representative Marcus Brown filed a proof
of service with the Court that purports to show service on RJ Broadway LLC at
660 Lombardy Pl., San Marino, CA 91108. This is not the address of Plaintiff’s
counsel;  service was improper. 
 
            The answer
filed by Defendants is defective as a matter of law because entities cannot
represent themselves in Court. (CLD Construction, Inc. v. City of San Ramon
(2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 1141, 1145.)
