And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge Maurice Leiter in a case between RJ Broadway LLC (Plaintiff) and Web Apps Agency LLC and Broadway Innovation House Inc. (Defendants). The Plaintiff filed a motion to strike the Answer of the Defendants, which was unopposed. The court grants the motion based on the following grounds: (1) the Answer was untimely filed, (2) the Defendants failed to serve the Plaintiff's counsel, and (3) entities cannot represent themselves in court. The court notes that the Answer was filed outside the five-day limit specified in Code of Civil Procedure §1167.3, and the proof of service provided by the Defendants was improper. Furthermore, the court holds that entities cannot represent themselves in court, citing CLD Construction, Inc. v. City of San Ramon (2004). The court's decision is based on California Code of Civil Procedure sections 436, 436(b), and 1167.3. The hearing date is scheduled for January 13, 2025, in Department 54.
