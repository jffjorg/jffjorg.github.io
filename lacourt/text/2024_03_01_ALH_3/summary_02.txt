And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling grants plaintiff JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s motion for summary judgment on its remaining claim for breach of contract against defendants Adarn Inc. dba Metro Furniture, John Yueh, and Yapeng Liu. The ruling is based on a declaration by Shirley A. White, a Special Credits Analyst II with Chase, which authenticates multiple documents related to the loan agreement and guaranty agreements between Chase and Adarn. The documents show that Adarn failed to pay under the terms of the contract and is in default, and that Yueh and Liu failed to cure Adarn's default, causing them to default on their guaranty agreements. The ruling finds that plaintiff has met its burden to establish the elements of its breach of contract claim, and that defendants did not raise a triable issue of material fact. Therefore, summary judgment in favor of Chase is granted.
