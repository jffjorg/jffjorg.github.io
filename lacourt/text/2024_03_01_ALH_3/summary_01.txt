And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by the California State Lottery Commission (Defendant) to the First Amended Complaint (FAC) filed by Jose Rivera (Plaintiff). The demurrer is unopposed.

The Court found that the Plaintiff's claim for declaratory relief fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action because: (1) California lottery regulations and the Powerball Group Rules prevent Defendant from paying Plaintiff lottery winnings under the facts alleged in the FAC, (2) Defendant is only permitted to pay a prize once, and (3) Defendant owes no duty to Plaintiff.

The Court also found that the Plaintiff's premise relies on the allegation that his lottery ticket was stolen, so he had no winning ticket to present to the State Lottery to claim the prize and did not present a winning ticket to the State Lottery.

As a result, the Court sustains the demurrer without leave to amend, meaning the Plaintiff cannot state a claim against the Defendant and cannot amend the FAC to cure the defects.

The Court notes that the Plaintiff failed to oppose the demurrer or show how amendment would be possible, and therefore, the demurrer is sustained without leave to amend.
