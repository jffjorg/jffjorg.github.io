Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Lashunda Pruitt v. Nationstar Mortgage, LLC dba Mr. Cooper. The case involves an alleged wrongful foreclosure and Nationstar's demurrer to the plaintiff's first amended complaint. The court has sustained Nationstar's demurrer on the grounds that the plaintiff's claims are barred by the statute of limitations. Specifically, the court found that the plaintiff's alleged violations of Civil Code sections 2923.5 and 2924.9 occurred in 2019, more than three years ago, and that the plaintiff failed to plead sufficient facts to demonstrate delayed discovery and diligence. The court has given the plaintiff leave to amend its complaint to allege sufficient facts to bring its statutory claims within the delayed discovery rule. The case will proceed with an amended complaint, and Nationstar is ordered to give notice.
