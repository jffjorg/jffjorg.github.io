1.    
Background
This is an action arising from an alleged wrongful
foreclosure. Plaintiff Lashunda Pruitt as power of attorney for Georgia Pruitt
(“Plaintiff”) alleges in the complaint that defendant Nationstar Mortgage LLC
dba Mr. Cooper (“Nationstar”) recorded a notice of default on a mortgage taken
out by Plaintiff without, within the statutorily required period, contacting
Plaintiff to notify her of possible foreclosure or discuss foreclosure
alternatives. Plaintiff alleges that defendants NewRez, LLC dba Shellpoint
Mortgage Servicing (“Shellpoint”) and US Bank Trust National Association (“US
Bank”) subsequently wrongfully foreclosed on the mortgage.
The First Amended Complaint (“complaint”) alleges
causes of action for violation of Civil Code section 2923.5 and violation of
Civil Code section 2924.9 against Nationstar. The complaint alleges causes of
action for wrongful foreclosure and unfair business practices against
Shellpoint and US Bank.
2.    
Demurrer
Nationstar demurs to the first and second causes of
action of the complaint, for violation of Civil Code section 2923.5 and Civil
Code section 2924.9, on the grounds that the complaint fails to allege facts
sufficient to state a cause of action.[1]
Nationstar contends that the cause of action for violation of Civil Code
section 2923.5, which requires a mortgage servicer to contact a borrower about
options to avoid foreclosure at least thirty days before filing a notice of
default, fails because Nationstar filed a California Declaration of Compliance
along with the notice of default, which under Civil Code section 2924 creates a
rebuttable statutory presumption of compliance with Civil Code section 2923.5. 
Nationstar further contends that Plaintiff’s claims
against Nationstar are barred by the statute of limitations because the statute
of limitations for a violation of the Homeowner’s Bill of Rights is three years
and the statute of limitations began to run in 2019, when Nationstar filed the
notice of default.
In opposition, Plaintiff argues that she was available
by phone or mail and never received a phone call or any written communication
from Nationstar regarding options to avoid foreclosure or foreclosure
alternatives either before or after Nationstar filed the notice of default.
In reply, Nationstar contends that Plaintiff’s
statement that she received no mail or messages from Nationstar in 2019 is
conclusory and insufficient to overcome the presumption arising from the filing
of the declaration of compliance. Nationstar further contends that Plaintiff
failed to address the statute of limitations argument, which constitutes an
abandonment of that argument.
3.    
Demurrer
standards
A demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the complaint
states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747
(Hahn).)¿When considering demurrers, courts read the allegations
liberally and in context. (Taylor v. City of Los Angeles Dept. of Water and
Power (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1228.)¿In a demurrer proceeding, the
defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial
notice.¿(Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968,
994.)¿“A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other
extrinsic matters.¿Therefore, it lies only where the defects appear on the face
of the pleading or are judicially noticed.”¿(SKF Farms v. Superior Court
(1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 902, 905.) “The only issue involved in a demurrer hearing
is whether the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous matters,
states a cause of action.”¿(Hahn, supra, 147 Cal.App.4th at p.
747.)¿
The ultimate facts alleged in the complaint must be
deemed true, as well as all facts that may be implied or inferred from those
expressly alleged.¿(Marshall v. Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher (1995) 37
Cal.App.4th 1397, 1403; see also Shields v. County of San Diego
(1984) 155 Cal.App.3d 103, 133 [stating, “[o]n demurrer, pleadings are read
liberally and allegations contained therein are assumed to be true.”]) “The
court does not, however, assume the truth of contentions, deductions or
conclusions of law. [Citation.]” (Durell v. Sharp Healthcare (2010) 183
Cal.App.4th 1350, 1358.)
 
4.     Request for Judicial Notice
Nationstar requests that the court take
judicial notice of the deed of trust executed by Georgia Pruitt on November 10,
2006 and recorded on December 7, 2006, with the Instrument No. 20062716376,
securing the principal amount of $163,000.00, and encumbering the real property
located at 715 North Dwight Avenue, Compton, California 90220.  The court GRANTS Nationstar’s request for
judicial notice.
5.    
Discussion
          a. The complaint states a claim for
violation of Civil Code § 2923.5.
Civil
Code § 2923.5 mandates that a mortgage servicer contact the borrower at least
thirty days in advance of filing a notice of default in order to “assess the
borrower's financial situation and explore options for the borrower to avoid
foreclosure.” Civil Code § 2924.9 provides that, within five business days of
filing a notice of default, a mortgage servicer that offers foreclosure
prevention alternative shall send the borrower a written communication
containing information about the alternatives and the process to be considered
for a foreclosure prevention alternative. 
Defendant contends that the filing of the Notice of Default creates a
rebuttable presumption that can only be refuted by facts, not conclusory allegations.  However, the authorities relied upon by
Defendant do not relate to the sufficiency of the allegations in a pleading to
state a cause of action.  Instead, they
address issues of evidence and proof.  Moreover,
Civil Code § 2924 does not address pleading requirements. 
Plaintiff alleges that Nationstar failed to
contact her by phone or written communication about options to avoid
foreclosure at least thirty days before filing the notice of default. Although
Nationstar contends that its filing of a California Declaration of Compliance
creates a rebuttable presumption that the required communication was made, Plaintiff’s
allegation creates competing accounts as to the possibility of compliance with
Civ. Code § 2923.5.  (Mabry v. Superior Court (2010) 185 Cal.App.4th 208, 235-236.)  A demurrer is “ “simply not the appropriate
procedure for determining the truth of disputed facts.’ ” (Joslin v. H.A.S. Ins.
Brokerage (1986) 184 Cal.App.3d 369, 374; Skov v. U.S. Bank (2012) 207 Cal.App.4th 690, 696 [assuming the
truth of the plaintiff’s allegations, a disputed issue of compliance with Civil
Code § 2923.5 cannot be resolved at the demurrer stage]; see also Barrionuevo v. Chase Bank,
N.A. (N.D.Cal.2012) 885 F.Supp.2d 964, 976-977 [borrower’s allegation
that bank did not contact them before filing the notice of default was
sufficient to state a violation of Civ. Code § 2923.5, despite judicial notice
taken of declaration in notice of default that asserted statutory compliance]; Argueta v. J.P. Morgan Chase
(E.D.
Cal. 2011) 787 F.Supp2d 1099, 1107 [despite judicial notice of Notice of
Default including declaration of compliance with Civ. Code § 2325.5, plaintiff’s
allegations were sufficient to preclude dismissal where plaintiffs alleged they
did not receive phone calls, phone messages, or letters before the Notice of
Default was recorded].)  
Plaintiff has therefore alleged facts sufficient
to state a claim for violation of Civil Code § 2923.5.  
          b. Plaintiff has not alleged
sufficient facts to plead around the statute of 
    limitations
defense apparent from the allegations in the complaint.
Defendant contends that both of plaintiff’s
statutory claims are barred by the statute of limitations.  Code of Civil Procedure section 388 provides
that the statute of limitations for a cause of action created by statute is
three years. Civil Code sections 2923.5 and 2924.9 were statutorily created as
part of the Homeowner’s Bill of Rights (See Schmidt v. Citibank, N.A. (2018) 28 Cal.App.5th 1109).  The three-year statute of limitations
applicable generally to claims for statutory violations applies to nonjudicial
foreclosures allegedly violating a Civil Code provision.  (Engstrom v. Kallins (1997) 49 Cal.App.4th 773, 782 n.8—addressing wrongful
foreclosures, and Civ. C. §1799.91(a) requiring creditor notice to co-signors,
and observing that the plaintiff, “apparently concedes the applicability of Code
of Civil Procedure section 338, subdivision (a), which provides a three-year
statute for ‘[a]n action upon a liability created by statute, other than a
penalty or forfeiture.’”) 
Generally, a cause of action begins to accrue,
and the statute of limitations begins to run, when the cause of action is
completed with all of its elements. (Fox v. Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc. (2005) 35 Cal.4th 797, 806.) “An exception to
the general rule for defining the accrual of a cause of action – indeed, the ‘most
important’ one – is the discovery rule. [Citation.]  It may be expressed by the Legislature or
implied by the courts.  [Citation.] It
postpones accrual of a cause of action until the plaintiff discovers, or has
reason to discover, the cause of action.” 
(Holman,
supra at 195, citing Norgart v. Upjohn Co. (1999) 21 Cal.4th 383, 395.)  
The common-law discovery rule is available
when the three-year statute of limitations for an action upon a liability
created by statute, other than a penalty or forfeiture applies.  (Holman v. County of Butte (2021) 68 Cal.App.5th 189, 194 (“Holman”)—dismissal of plaintiff’s suit reversed
where trial court erroneously sustained defendant’s demurrer without leave to
amend after concluding that plaintiff failed to present authority to support
application of the delayed discovery rule to the applicable statute of
limitations as set forth in C.C.P. § 338, subdiv. (a).)   
In order to rely on the discovery rule for
delayed accrual of a cause of action, a plaintiff whose complaint shows on its face
that his claim would be barred without the benefit of the discovery rule must
specifically plead facts to show (1) the time and manner of discovery and
(2) the inability to have made earlier discovery despite reasonable diligence. In
assessing the sufficiency of the allegations of delayed discovery, the court
places the burden on the plaintiff to show diligence; conclusory allegations
will not withstand demurrer.  (Fox v. Ethicon Endo-Surgery,
Inc.
(2005) 35 Cal. 4th 797, 808.)
Nationstar filed notice of default on
September 4, 2019. Both the alleged violation of Civil Code section 2923.5 and
the alleged violation of Civil Code section 2924 took place in 2019, more than
three years ago. Though the common-law discovery rule is available to claims
governed by Code of Civil Procedure § 338, subdiv. (a), Plaintiff has not
alleged any facts indicating when Plaintiff discovered the notice of default
had been filed, or that Plaintiff was not aware of her default or Nationstar’s
notice of default.
Accordingly, the court will sustain the
demurrer on statute of limitations grounds, with leave for Plaintiff to amend her
complaint to allege sufficient facts to bring her statutory claims within the
delayed discovery rule. 
6.    
Conclusion

Based on the
foregoing, the court SUSTAINS Nationstar’s demurrer with leave to amend.  Plaintiff shall file an amended pleading not
later than twenty (20) days after this order.

Nationstar is ordered to give notice.
