[Tentative]
  Order RE:
 
defendant and cross-complainant’s motion to
  strike answer
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                 Defendant and cross-complainant
1153 Roscomare Project, LLC   
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Unopposed
Motion to Strike Answer
The court
considered the moving papers filed in connection with this motion.  No opposition papers were filed.
DISCUSSION
Defendant and cross-complainant 1153 Roscomare Project, LLC
(“Cross-Complainant”) moves the court for an order striking the answer to its
First Amended Cross-Complaint filed by cross-defendant RS Carpentry, Design
& Remodeling Inc. (“Cross-Defendant”) and entering Cross-Defendant’s
default.  Cross-Complainant moves for
this relief on the ground that Cross-Defendant is a corporation unrepresented
by counsel. 
“[U]nder
a long-standing common law rule of procedure, a corporation, unlike a natural
person, cannot represent itself before courts of record in propria persona, nor
can it represent itself through a corporate officer, director or other employee
who is not an attorney.  It must be represented by licensed counsel in
proceedings before courts of record.”  (CLD Construction, Inc. v. City
of San Ramon (2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 1141, 1145.)  
Cross-Defendant
is a corporation.  (Booth Decl., Ex. A
[Articles of Incorporation for Cross-Defendant].)  Thus, Cross-Defendant is required to be
represented by counsel in this action.  (CLD
Construction, Inc., supra, 120 Cal.App.4th at p. 1145.)  However, on September 20, 2023,
Cross-Defendant filed a “Substitution of Attorney” form (Judicial Council form
MC-050), stating that it was substituting in to represent itself in this action
in place of attorney Raviv Netzah. 
(Cross-Def. Sep. 20, 2023 Substitution of Attorney, MC-050, ¶¶ 1-2.)  Cross-Defendant has not (1) filed another
Substitution of Attorney form, stating that it is now represented by counsel,
or (2) filed an opposition or other evidence with the court establishing that
it has since retained counsel. 
Thus, the
court finds that Defendant is improperly representing itself in propria
persona.  The court therefore grants
Cross-Complainant’s motion to strike Cross-Defendant’s answer to its First
Amended Cross-Complaint.  (CLD
Construction, Inc., supra, 120 Cal.App.4th at p. 1145; Code Civ.
Proc., § 436, subd. (b) [court may strike any pleading “not drawn or filed in
conformity with the laws of this state”].) 
ORDER
            The court grants defendant and
cross-complainant 1153 Roscomare Project, LLC’s motion to strike answer. 
            The court orders that the “Answer to
First Amended Cross-Complaint” filed by cross-defendant RS Carpentry Design
& Remodeling Inc. on April 24, 2023, is stricken. 
            The court orders defendant and
cross-complainant 1153 Roscomare Project, LLC to file a Request for Entry of
Default (Judicial Council form CIV-100) as to cross-defendant RS Carpentry
Design & Remodeling Inc. no later than 10 days from the date of this order.

            The court sets an Order to Show
Cause re entry of default (as to cross-defendant RS Carpentry Design &
Remodeling Inc.) for hearing on January 24, 2025, at 8:30 a.m., in Department
53. 
            
The court orders defendant and cross-complainant 1153 Roscomare
Project, LLC to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
 
DATED:  March 28, 2024
