And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The court grants defendant and cross-complainant 1153 Roscomare Project, LLC's motion to strike the answer filed by cross-defendant RS Carpentry, Design & Remodeling Inc. The court finds that cross-defendant, a corporation, is improperly representing itself in propria persona and has not filed a new Substitution of Attorney form or opposition to establish that it has retained counsel. As a result, the court strikes the answer and orders the defendant to file a request for entry of default. The court sets an order to show cause for hearing on January 24, 2025, to determine whether to enter default.
