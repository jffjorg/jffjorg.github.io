  Case Number:  23SMCV00538    Hearing Date:   May 16, 2024    Dept:  O Case  Name:  DeCastro v. Peter, et al.    Case No.:                    23SMCV00538    Complaint Filed:                   3-14-23      Hearing Date:            5-16-24   Discovery C/O:                     1-24-25      Calendar No.:            11   Discover Motion C/O:          2-10-25     POS:                           OK   Trial Date:                             2-24-25    SUBJECT:                 MOTION TO COMPEL RESPONSES TO  RFPs (SET TWO) MOVING  PARTY:   Plaintiff Jose DeCastro RESP.  PARTY:         Defendant Michael  Pierattini                                        TENTATIVE  RULING             Plaintiff  Jose DeCastro’s Motion to Compel Responses to RFPs (Set Two) is DENIED.               DeCastro’s  motion was reserved as a Motion for Sanctions.   DeCastro’s motion is not a Motion for Sanctions but a Motion to Compel  Further Responses to RFPs pursuant to CCP §2031.310.                 DeCastro  failed to submit a mandatory CRC Rule 3.1345 Separate Statement.  DeCastro’s failure to include a separate  statement is not fatal, however, given that Pierattini submits a copy of his  responses to the RFPs and there are only four RFPs at issue.  (Katrinak Dec., Ex. A.)                 DeCastro’s  Motion is not supported by a meet and confer declaration.  DeCastro merely verifies the points and  authorities.  DeCastro fails to cite any  authority allowing him to rely on a verified memo of points and authorities in  lieu of the meet and confer declaration required under CCP §§2016.040 and  2030.310(b).  (See CCP §2015.5  (listing “declaration” and “verification” separately).                 Moreover,  Plaintiff fails to establish good cause for further responses.  The burden is on the moving party seeking to  compel further responses to RFPs to show both relevance to the subject matter  and specific facts justifying discovery.   (Glenfed Develop. Corp. v. Superior Court (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th  1113, 1117.)  Once good cause is  established by the moving party, the burden then shifts to the responding party  to justify any objections made to document disclosure.  (Hartbrodt v. Burke (1996, 2nd Dist.)  42 Cal.App.4th 168, 172-174.)                     Plaintiff  contends the RFPs are intended to solicit information for defenses to  Pierattini’s cross-complaint against him.   The RFPs in dispute seek documents regarding the “Deposition of Jose  DeCastro” scheduled for January 25, 2023, including the scheduling and planning  of the deposition, receipts for payments for the deposition and receipts for  refunds in connection with the deposition.   (Motion, Ex. 1.)  None of these  RFPs are tied to the cross-complaint or any of the substantive issues raised by  either the complaint or the cross-complaint.                  Plaintiff’s  motion is therefore denied for failure to provide a proper meet and confer  declaration and failure to demonstrate good cause for further responses.  As the prevailing party, Defendant Pierattini  is entitled to sanctions pursuant to CCP §2031.310(h).  Defendant requests sanctions in the amount of  $4500 (10 hours @ $450/hr).  The amount  requested is reasonable.                 Plaintiff’s  Motion to Compel Further Responses is DENIED.   Plaintiff is ordered to pay sanctions to defendant in the amount of $4,500 within 60  days.  Case  Name:  DeCastro v. Peter, et al.    Case No.:                    23SMCV00538    Complaint Filed:                   3-14-23      Hearing Date:            5-16-24   Discovery C/O:                     1-24-25      Calendar No.:            11   Discover Motion C/O:          2-10-25     POS:                           OK   Trial Date:                             2-24-25    SUBJECT:                 (1)  DEMURRER TO AMENDED ANSWER                                     (2)  MOTION FOR SANCTIONS PURSUANT TO CCP §128.7 MOVING  PARTY:   (1)  Plaintiff Jose DeCastro                                     (2)  Defendant Michael Pierattini RESP.  PARTY:         (1)  Defendant Michael Pierattini                                     (2)  None .   TENTATIVE  RULING             Plaintiff  Jose De Castro’s Demurrer to Pierattini’s Amended Answer is OVERRULED.  Defendant Pierattini’s Motion for Sanctions  pursuant to CCP §128.7 is DENIED.   I.  Demurrer to  Answer—OVERRULE               A.  Untimeliness is mere irregularity               Plaintiff  DeCastro admits that his demurrer was untimely filed but claims it was due to  his inability to meet and confer.  A  demurrer to an answer must be filed within 10 days after service of the  answer.  (CCP §430.40.)  An automatic 30-day extension is granted if  the parties are unable to meet and confer at least 5 days before the demurrer  is due, if a declaration under penalty of perjury attesting to a good faith  attempt to meet and confer is filed.   (CCP §430.41.)  DeCastro did not  file a CCP §430.41(a)(2) declaration and he is therefore not entitled to a  30-day extension.               However, if  a demurrer is presented late, the court may in its discretion strike it from  the files, or it may deny the request to strike and hear the demurrer.  Delay is only an irregularity.  (5 Witkin, Cal. Proc. (6th  ed. 2024), Pleadings, §979.)  “Even  assuming for argument's sake that the demurrer was filed late, the trial court  nevertheless had discretion to entertain it.   There is no absolute right to have a pleading stricken for lack of  timeliness in filing where no question of jurisdiction is involved, and where,  as here, the late filing was a mere irregularity; the granting or denial of the  motion is a matter which lies within the discretion of the court.”  (McAllister v. County of Monterey  (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 253, 281–282.)                 Plaintiff’s  demurrer to the answer was due on January 16, 2024, 10 days plus two court days  after the amended answer was filed and served by email on January 2, 2024.  Plaintiff’s demurrer was filed 15 days later  on January 31, 2024.  The delay of 15  days was a mere irregularity and it would be an abuse of discretion to strike  or refuse to hear the demurrer based on such untimeliness.                 B.  Amended Answer sufficiently states facts to  constitute a defense   “A party against whom an answer has  been filed may object, by demurrer as provided in Section 430.30, to the answer  upon any one or more of the following grounds: (a) The answer does not state facts sufficient to constitute  a defense. (b) The answer is uncertain. As used in this subdivision,  “uncertain” includes ambiguous and unintelligible.”  (CCP §430.20.)               An answer  fails to raise any material issue or state a defense where it expressly or  substantially admits or does not sufficiently deny all the material allegations  of the complaint and sets up no new matter that is sufficient to bar or defeat  the action.  (Adjustment Corp. v.  Hollywood Hardware & Paint Co. (1939) 35 Cal.App.2d 566, 569-570.)  Demurrer to an answer must be overruled if any  defense to the complaint is properly alleged.   (South Shore Land Co. v. Petersen (1964) 226 Cal.App.2d 725,  733–734 (demurrer to answer properly overruled based on sufficiently pled  general denial)(“if one of the defenses or counterclaims is free from the  objections urged by demurrer, then a demurrer to the entire answer must be overruled”).                 “An  affirmative defense must be pleaded in the same manner as if the facts were set  forth in a complaint. In other words, the general requirement of stating the  ultimate facts applies and, where particularity in pleading is necessary in a  complaint, it is equally necessary in an affirmative defense involving the  issue.”  (5 Witkin, Cal. Proc. (6th  ed. 2024) Plead, § 1122; see also Timberidge Enterprises, Inc. v. City of  Santa Rosa (1978) 86 Cal.App.3d 873, 879-880 (demurrer to answer asks  whether the answer raises a defense to the plaintiff's stated cause of action).)  Pleadings are meant “to inform ...  adversaries of the nature of the cause which they state against them with  sufficient particularity to advise them of the issue they will be required to  meet at the trial of the action.”  (Lewis  v. Fahn (1952) 113 Cal.App.2d 95, 100.)   Facts that establish a complete discharge of defendant's previously  accrued liability must be specially pleaded.   (5 Witkin, Cal. Proc., supra, §1122.)               Defendant  Pierattini’s Amended Answer sets forth a general denial.  A demurrer can only be sustained to the  answer if there are no facts to constitute a defense.  General denial of each and every allegation  in Plaintiff’s complaint is a defense to the action.                 In  addition, based on a review of the affirmative defenses asserted, sufficient  ultimate facts are alleged to state each of the affirmative defenses.  (5 Witkin, Cal. Proc., supra, Pleadings,  §§392 and 1122.)  Evidentiary facts are  not required.  (5 Witkin, Cal. Proc.,  supra, Pleadings, §§392 and 1122.)  Of  the affirmative defenses alleged, only the statute of limitations defense is  subject to the additional requirement that the particular statute of  limitations be alleged.  Pierattini does  that.  (Amended Answer, ¶7, 6th  Affirmative Defense.)                 Pierattini’s  10th affirmative defense for offset is also not an improper request  for affirmative relief.  Offset is  properly raised in the answer.  (CCP  §431.70 (“Where cross-demands for money have existed between persons at any  point in time when neither demand was barred by the statute of limitations, and  an action is thereafter commenced by one such person, the other person may  assert in the answer the defense of payment in that the two demands are  compensated so far as they equal each other, notwithstanding that an  independent action asserting the person's claim would at the time of filing the  answer be barred by the statute of limitations.”))               Demurrer to  Defendant Pierattini’s Amended Answer is overruled.     II.  Motion for CCP  §128.7 Sanctions—DENY               A.  Applicable Law               “By  presenting to the court, whether by signing, filing, submitting, or later  advocating, a pleading, petition, written notice of motion, or other similar  paper, an attorney or unrepresented party is certifying that to the best of the  person's knowledge, information, and belief, formed after an inquiry reasonable  under the circumstances, all of the following conditions are met:  (1) It is not being presented primarily for  an improper purpose, such as to harass or to cause unnecessary delay or  needless increase in the cost of litigation.   (2) The claims, defenses, and other legal contentions therein are  warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for the extension,  modification, or reversal of existing law or the establishment of new law.  (3) The allegations and other factual  contentions have evidentiary support or, if specifically so identified, are  likely to have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further  investigation or discovery.”  (CCP  §128.7(b).)               “Under  section 128.7, a court may impose sanctions if it concludes a pleading was  filed for an improper purpose or was indisputably without merit, either legally  or factually.  [¶]  A claim is factually frivolous if it is ‘not  well grounded in fact’ and is legally frivolous if it is ‘not warranted by  existing law or a good faith argument for the extension, modification, or  reversal of existing law.’  In either  case, to obtain sanctions, the moving party must show the party's conduct in  asserting the claim was objectively unreasonable.  A claim is objectively unreasonable if any  reasonable attorney would agree that it is totally and completely without  merit.”  (Bucur v. Ahmad (2016)  244 Cal.App.4th 175, 189 (CCP 128.7 sanctions properly imposed where it was  obvious that plaintiffs’ claims were barred by res judicata, judicial  admissions and judicial estoppel).)                 An action  that is not legally or factually frivolous cannot be presented for an improper  purpose.  “Having concluded that the  claims presented in the second amended complaint were nonfrivolous, we must  also conclude that they were not presented for an improper purpose.” (Ponce v. Wells Fargo Bank (2018) 21 Cal.App.5th 253,  265.)                 B.  Pierattini fails to establish a violation of  CCP §128.7 warranting sanctions               Defendant  Pierattini moves for CCP §128.7 sanctions in the amount of $10,410 against  Plaintiff for filing his demurrer to Pierattini’s Amended Answer.  Pierattini argues Plaintiff violated the  requirements of CCP §128.7(b)(1)-(b)(3), because (1) he filed a demurrer to the  Amended Answer knowing that it was untimely and no extension applied under CCP  §430.41; (2) he maintained he had an extension under CCP §430.41 when he did  not; (3) he was responsible for his own inability to meet and confer before  filing the demurrer.  Based on these reasons,  Defendant maintains the demurrer was frivolous and filed in bad faith.               As  discussed above, untimeliness of a demurrer is a mere irregularity and the  Court always has discretion to hear an untimely demurrer.  Here, the demurrer was only untimely by  approximately two weeks and it would have been an abuse of discretion to strike  it on grounds of untimeliness.  As such,  Plaintiff’s filing of an untimely demurrer does not violate CCP  §128.7(b)(1)-(3).                 Plaintiff’s  baseless assertion that he was entitled to a 30-day extension under CCP §430.41  is not grounds to impose CCP §128.7 sanctions.   Again, the untimeliness of the demurrer would not have prevented the  Court from hearing the merits of the demurrer.   At worst, Plaintiff misrepresentation of his right to an extension was  immaterial.                 Plaintiff’s  failure to satisfy the meet and confer requirement also does not violate CCP  §128.7(b)(1)-(3).  Plaintiff attempted to  meet and confer and exchanged several emails with Defendant regarding his  objections to the Amended Answer.   (Demurrer, DeCastro Dec., 6:4-24.)   Moreover, based on the emails exchanged between the parties, they  sufficiently met and conferred on the substance of Plaintiff’s objections and  were at an impasse.  Although CCP  §430.41(a) requires that the meet and confer take place by telephone, video  conference or in person, the parties satisfied the substantive purpose of the  meet and confer requirement.  Plaintiff’s  filing of the demurrer despite the parties’ failure to meet and confer in  person, by telephone or video conference does not amount to a violation of CCP  §128.7 given the circumstances.                 Moreover,  ordinarily, the only consequence for failing to meet and confer prior to filing  a demurrer is to continue the demurrer so that the parties can meet and  confer.  Failure to meet and confer is  not grounds to sustain or overrule the demurrer.  (CCP §430.41(a)(4).)                 Defendant Pierattini’s  Motion for Sanctions pursuant to CCP §128.7 is denied.
