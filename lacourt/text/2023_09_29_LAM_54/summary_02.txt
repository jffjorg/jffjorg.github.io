Case Number: 22STCP03038
Hearing Date: September 29, 2023
Dept: 54

Superior Court of California
County of Los Angeles

Case Parties:
  - Petitioner: Save Our Rural Town
  - Respondents: County of Los Angeles, Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors

Case Summary:
  - Petitioner challenges the adoption of the Safety Plan Element of the General Plan, arguing that the County failed to analyze the environmental impacts associated with the OurCounty Sustainability Plan programs and the adoption of Policy S 4.1.
  - The Court considered the opening brief, opposition brief, and reply brief, as well as the certified administrative record.
  - The Court found that the implementation of the OurCounty programs is still a future action that is too early in the planning process to allow meaningful analysis of any potential impacts.
  - The Court concluded that CEQA does not require consideration of the environmental impacts of the Sustainability Programs, and the County's negative declaration is proper.
  - The Court denied Petitioner's request for a writ of administrative mandamus and denied Petitioner's request for declaratory relief and injunctive relief.

Key Points:
  - The Court found that the OurCounty programs are still in the planning stage and that any environmental review would be premature and wholly speculative.
  - The Court concluded that Policy S 4.1 serves a legitimate government purpose and is not arbitrary or unreasonable.
  - The Court found that Policy S 4.1 does not require an EIR under CEQA.
  - The Court denied Petitioner's claim that Policy S 4.1 is preempted by Government Code ยง 65302(g)(3) and the Map Act.
