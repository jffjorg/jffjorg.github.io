And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

This tentative ruling addresses a motion by defendants to confirm an appraisal of the plaintiff's share in Hassen Holding Company, Inc. (HHC) for $97,833.00. The defendants argue that the appraisal was conducted in accordance with California Corporations Code Section 2000, which allows for a shareholder buyout in certain circumstances. The plaintiff opposes the motion, arguing that the appraisers relied on speculative financial documents and refused to consider evidence showing a single enterprise comprised of various entities.

The court declines to rule on the motion at this time, as it requires weighing evidence and making factual findings that are better suited for trial. The trial is currently set for November 13, 2023. The court will continue the motion to December 7, 2023, at 9:00am.
