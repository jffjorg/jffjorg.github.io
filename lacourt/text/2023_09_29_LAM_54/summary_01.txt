And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

This tentative ruling addresses a motion by defendants to confirm an appraisal of the plaintiff's share in Hassen Holding Company, Inc. (HHC) for $97,833.00. The defendants argue that the appraisal was conducted in accordance with California Corporations Code Section 2000, which allows for a shareholder buyout in certain circumstances. The plaintiff opposes the motion, arguing that the appraisers relied on speculative financial documents and refused to consider evidence showing a single enterprise comprised of various entities.

The court declines to rule on the motion at this time, as it requires weighing evidence and making factual findings that are better suited for trial. The trial is currently set for November 13, 2023. The court will continue the motion to December 7, 2023, at 9:00am.

**English Text Summary:**

In this case, the Plaintiff, Ziad Alhassen, is disputing the valuation of their shares in the Defendant company, Hassen Holding Company, Inc. (HHC).  Defendants have moved to confirm an appraisal that values Plaintiff's shares at $97,833.00. Plaintiff argues that the appraisal is flawed and requests a higher valuation.

The central disagreement revolves around how profits from HHC's subsidiaries have been distributed.  Defendants maintain that profits were allocated to a related entity, Dighton, to repay capital contributions, resulting in a lower share value for HHC. Plaintiff contends that the subsidiaries should be viewed as a single enterprise and that these profits should be considered differently. 

The Judge has deferred a decision on the motion until after a trial scheduled for November 13, 2023. This will allow the Court to weigh evidence and assess the factual disputes surrounding the valuation of the shares. The motion is currently continued to December 7, 2023.

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the Defendants' motion to confirm the appraisal of Plaintiff's share in Defendant Hassen Holding Company (HHC). The motion is continued to December 7, 2023, at 9:00 AM. The Court declines to rule on the motion before trial, as it requires weighing evidence and making factual findings related to issues at trial. The trial is set for November 13, 2023. The motion to confirm the appraisal is based on an appraisal of the fair value of the shares, which was conducted by three disinterested appraisers. The appraisers determined that HHC's interest in one subsidiary was 1%, rather than the 45% set forth in the subsidiary partnership agreement. The Plaintiff challenges the appraisal calculation, asserting that the appraisers relied on financial documents that are speculative and without foundation, and refused to consider evidence showing a single enterprise comprised of various entities. The Court will consider the evidence and make a determination at trial.

The motion is a special proceeding under California Corporations Code section 2000, which allows the corporation or holders of 50% or more of the voting power to avoid dissolution by purchasing the shares of the plaintiff at their fair value. The dispute centers around the fair value of Plaintiff's share in Defendant HHC, with the Defendants seeking to confirm an appraisal of $97,833.00. The Plaintiff opposes the motion, challenging the documents relied on by the appraisers and the calculation method used.

The Court declines to rule on the motion before trial, citing the need to weigh evidence and make factual findings related to issues at trial. The motion is continued to December 7, 2023, at 9:00 am.
