 Case Number:  21STCV33353    Hearing Date:   January 26, 2024    Dept:  31 SUPERIOR COURT OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA  FOR THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES - CENTRAL DISTRICT  MARINA RUIZ and JAZMIN GUZMAN,¿ Plaintiff(s),¿¿ vs.¿ ¿FERNANDO CAZARES, ET AL.,¿  Defendant(s). ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) )       CASE NO: 21STCV33353  [TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING UNOPPOSED MOTION TO COMPEL  Dept. 31 1:30 p.m.  January 26, 2024  I.  Motion to Compel Defendant Fernando Cazares ("Defendant Cazares”) propounded form interrogatories, set one, on Plaintiff Marina Ruiz (“Plaintiff Ruiz”) on June 6, 2023. After receiving no response by July 10, 2023, defense counsel granted Plaintiff’s counsel’s request for an extension up until August 21, 2023. However, Plaintiff Ruiz has not served responses to date. Defendant Cazares therefore seeks an order compelling Plaintiff Ruiz to respond, without objections, to the outstanding discovery and to pay sanctions.  Any opposition was due on or before January 12, 2024; the motion is unopposed. For a motion to compel discovery responses, all a propounding party must show is that it properly served its discovery requests, that the time to respond has expired, and that the party to whom the requests were directed failed to provide a timely response. (See Leach v. Superior Court (1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 902, 905 906.) Where a party fails to serve timely responses to discovery requests, the court may make an order compelling responses. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 403.) A party that fails to serve timely responses waives any objections to the request, including ones based on privilege or the protection of attorney work product. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).)   The Court notes that the motion and proposed order indicates both Defendants Cazares and Fidel Calderon propounded the discovery at issue. However, the evidence demonstrates Defendant Cazares as the only asking party. Therefore, the Court limits the following order to the evidence provided. Because the evidence shows Plaintiff Ruiz was properly served with discovery by Defendant Cazares and failed to respond, Defendant’s motion is GRANTED.  Plaintiff Ruiz is ordered to serve verified responses to Defendant Cazares’ form interrogatories, set one, without objections, within fifteen (15) days of this Order (CCP §§ 2030.290(a),(b).)  II. Sanctions Sanctions are mandatory against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response, unless a court makes certain findings.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290(c), 2031.300(c).)¿ Plaintiff Ruiz did not file any opposition. However, sanctions may be awarded, even though no opposition was filed, pursuant to CRC 3.1348(a). Defendant Cazares seeks sanctions in the amount of $900 for the motion.     Defendant Cazares is awarded 1 hour to prepare the motion, and 1 hour to appear at the hearing, at the requested rate of $225 per hour, for a total of $500 in attorney’s fees. Further, Defendant Cazares is awarded one motion filing fee of $60, as costs.    Sanctions are sought and imposed against Plaintiff Ruiz and her counsel, jointly and severally. Plaintiff Ruiz and/or her counsel are ordered to pay sanctions to Defendant Cazares, by and through counsel of record, in the total amount of $560, within fifteen (15) days.  Moving party is ordered to give notice.    PLEASE TAKE NOTICE: Parties are encouraged to meet and confer after reading this tentative ruling to see if they can reach an agreement. If a party intends to submit on this tentative ruling,¿the party must send an email to the court at¿sscdept31@lacourt.org¿with the Subject line “SUBMIT” followed by the case number.¿ The body of the email must include the hearing date and time, counsel’s contact information, and the identity of the party submitting.¿¿ Unless¿all¿parties submit by email to this tentative ruling, the parties should arrange to appear remotely (encouraged) or in person for oral argument.¿ You should assume that others may appear at the hearing to argue.¿¿ If the parties neither submit nor appear at hearing, the Court may take the motion off calendar or adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the Court.¿ After the Court has issued a tentative ruling, the Court may prohibit the withdrawal of the subject motion without leave.¿  Dated this 25th day of January 2024      Hon.
