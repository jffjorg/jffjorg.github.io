And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

At the hearing on January 2, 2024, counsel for the plaintiff failed to appear. The court continued the motion to allow counsel to appear and discuss available dates for the deposition. The matter was continued to January 26, 2024. The plaintiff's counsel later filed a declaration explaining that their failure to appear was due to a calendaring error. The defendant's counsel objected to the continuance, citing California Rule of Court 3.1304 (d) and arguing that the court had two options: take the motion off calendar or rule on the motion. The court has overruled the defendant's objection and will proceed with the hearing as scheduled.
