[1] At the hearing on January 2, 2024,
counsel for Plaintiff failed to appear. 
The court continued the motion to allow counsel to appear, and, in
particular, to discuss available dates for the deposition.  The matter was continued to January 26,
2024.  On January 3, 2024, counsel for
Plaintiff filed a declaration explaining that his failure to appear was due to
a calendaring error.  On January 10,
2024, counsel for Defendant filed an objection to the continuance of the
hearing on the motion.  Defense counsel
cites to California Rule of Court 3.1304 (d) and argues the court had two
options at the hearing when confronted by Plaintiff’s counsel’s failure to
appear: take the motion off calendar or rule on the motion.  Defense counsel cites the rule and objects
but provides no remedy.  If the court had
adopted its tentative, the matter would have been decided against Defendant;
and if the court had taken the matter off calendar, the court has the authority
to put the matter on calendar on its own motion, which would lead us back to
where we are now.  (See R & A
Vending Services v. City of Los Angeles (1985) 172 Cal.App.3d 1188, 1193 [“The
court for good cause has discretion in the control and regulation of its
calendar or docket. [Citation.] It is permissible for good cause to delay a
trial or hearing to a later date or to drop or strike a case from the calendar,
to be restored on motion of one or more of the litigants or on the court's own
motion.”].)  Defendant’s objection is
overruled.

documents.
