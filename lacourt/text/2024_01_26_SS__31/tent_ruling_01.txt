Background Plaintiff Stephanie De La Rosa (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Defendant Hamza Krofess (“Defendant”) for damages arising from a motor vehicle incident.   At this time, Defendant moves to enforce the Court’s orders by issuing judgment on monetary sanctions and to issue a writ of execution. Defendant asserts that on November 10, 2022, December 12, 2022, and February 23, 2023, the Court issued Orders granting Defendant’s motions to compel and imposing monetary sanctions against Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s counsel in the collective sum of $1,640.00. Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s counsel were ordered to pay the sanctions within 20 days, but Defendant avers that the sanctions have not been paid.  Any opposition was due on or before January 12, 2024. No opposition was filed.   II. Request for Judicial Notice Defendant requests the Court to take judicial notice of (1) the Court’s November 10, 2022 Order imposing monetary sanctions in the amount of $460 against Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s attorney of record, (2) the Court’s December 12, 2022 Order imposing monetary sanctions in the amount of $460 against Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s attorney of record, and (3) the Court’s February 23, 2023 Order imposing monetary sanctions in the amount of $660 against Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s attorney of record.  The requests are granted.   III. Motion for Entry of Judgment “ ‘Judgment’ means a judgment, order, or decree entered in a court of this state.”  (CCP § 680.230.)  “ ‘Money judgment’ means that part of a judgment that requires the payment of money.”  (Id. at § 680.270.)  “[A]fter entry of a money judgment, a writ of execution shall be issued by the clerk of the court, upon application of the judgment creditor, and shall be directed to the levying officer in the county where the levy is to be made and to any registered process server.”  (Id. at § 699.510(a).)  “Sanctions orders have the force and effect of a money judgment.”  (Constellation-F, LLC v. World Trading 23, Inc. (2020) 45 Cal.App.5th 22, 30, citing Newland v. Superior Court (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 608, 615.)  “[M]any attorneys seem to be unaware that monetary sanction orders are enforceable through the execution of judgment laws. [Citation.] These orders have the force and effect of a money judgment, and are immediately enforceable through execution, except to the extent the trial court may order a stay of the sanction.”  (Newland, 40 Cal.App.4th at 615.)    Here, as Defendant argues, monetary sanctions orders have the force and effect of a money judgment. Thus, the proper recourse to recover sanctions would be for Defendant to enforce the sanctions order as a money judgment pursuant to the Enforcement of Judgments Law.  (CCP § 680.010, et seq.; see Newland, 40 Cal.App.4th at 615.)  Because sanctions orders are enforceable as money judgments, the remedy to enforce payment of monetary sanctions is to obtain and levy a writ of execution on assets of the debtor. Plaintiff does not oppose the motion, and a failure to oppose a motion may be deemed a consent to the granting of the motion. (CRC, Rule 8.54 (c).)   Based on the foregoing, Defendant’s motion is GRANTED.     Defendant is ordered to give notice.    PLEASE TAKE NOTICE: Parties are encouraged to meet and confer after reading this tentative ruling to see if they can reach an agreement. If a party intends to submit on this tentative ruling,¿the party must send an email to the court at¿sscdept31@lacourt.org¿with the Subject line “SUBMIT” followed by the case number.¿ The body of the email must include the hearing date and time, counsel’s contact information, and the identity of the party submitting.¿¿ Unless¿all¿parties submit by email to this tentative ruling, the parties should arrange to appear remotely (encouraged) or in person for oral argument.¿ You should assume that others may appear at the hearing to argue.¿¿ If the parties neither submit nor appear at hearing, the Court may take the motion off calendar or adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the Court.¿ After the Court has issued a tentative ruling, the Court may prohibit the withdrawal of the subject motion without leave.¿  Dated this 25th day of January 2024      Hon.
