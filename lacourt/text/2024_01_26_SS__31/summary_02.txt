And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's unopposed motion for leave to file a First Amended Complaint (FAC). The plaintiff, Paul Martin, is seeking to add Lincoln LT, Inc. as a new defendant to the action. The plaintiff's counsel's declaration provides that the FAC is necessary because the plaintiff did not discover Lincoln until after discovery. The court notes that the plaintiff's motion complies with California Rules of Court Rule 3.1324(a) and (b) and that the proposed amendment is timely. The court grants the motion, ordering the plaintiff to file a separate copy of the proposed FAC within ten days of the date of the order and to give notice.
