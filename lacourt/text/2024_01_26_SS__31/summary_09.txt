And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge Michelle C. Kim in a case between Progressive Insurance Company (Progressive) and Nicholas Pfeiffer (Claimant). The case involves an uninsured motorist arbitration matter. Progressive filed a petition to open a superior court file, and the parties exchanged offers to compromise under CCP §998. Claimant's offer of $84,999.99 was not accepted, and Progressive's offer of $15,001.00 was not accepted either. The arbitration award was $35,290 in favor of Claimant. Claimant filed a Memorandum of Costs seeking total costs of $4,697.05, and Progressive moved to strike those costs. The Court ruled that Progressive's motion to tax costs is granted, and Claimant is not entitled to costs under CCP §998. The Court's decision is based on the fact that Claimant did not achieve a better result between the offer and the actual arbitration award against Progressive, and therefore Claimant is not entitled to costs under CCP §998.
