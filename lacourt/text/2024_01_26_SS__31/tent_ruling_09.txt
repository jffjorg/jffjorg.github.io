Background   On November 10, 2022, Petitioner Progressive Insurance Company (“Progressive”) filed a petition to open a superior court file for purposes of obtaining jurisdiction over this uninsured motorist arbitration (UIM) matter between Progressive and Claimant Nicholas Pfeiffer (“Claimant”).     On April 25, 2022, Claimant served Progressive with an offer to compromise per CCP §998 in the amount of $84,999.99. (Calendo Decl. Exh. B.) On September 12, 2022, Progressive served Claimant with an offer to compromise per CCP §998 in the amount of $15,001.00. (Id. at Exh. C.) On March 21, 2023, Claimant once more served Progressive with an offer to compromise per CCP §998 in the amount of $84,999.99. (Id. at Exh. D.) It is undisputed that neither party accepted each other’s CCP §998 offers, and the matter proceeded to arbitration. On October 4, 2023, this UIM matter proceeded before Neutral Arbitrator Hon. Mark V. Mooney (“Judge Mooney”). On October 13, 2023, Judge Mooney issued a statement of decision, concluding that the total value of the case was $50,290, but because Claimant had already received $15,000 from the primary tortfeasor, Claimant was awarded $35,290 from Progressive. (Id. at Exh. E.)  On October 27, 2023, Claimant filed a Memorandum of Costs seeking total costs of $4,697.05.   On November 7, 2023, Progressive moved to strike Claimant’s Memorandum of Costs. Claimant opposes the motion, and Progressive filed a reply.   II. Motion to Tax Costs Timeliness of Motion  “Any notice of motion to strike or to tax costs must be served and filed 15 days after service of the cost memorandum… If the cost memorandum was served electronically, the period is extended as provided in Code of Civil Procedure section 1010.6(a)(4).”  (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1700(b)(1).) The Memorandum of Costs was filed on October 27, 2023, and the motion to tax costs was filed on November 7, 2023. The motion is therefore timely.  Discussion In general, the “prevailing party” is entitled as a matter of right to recover costs for suit in any action or proceeding. (CCP, §1032(b); Santisas v. Goodin (1998) 17 Cal.4th 599, 606; Scott Co. Of Calif. v. Blount, Inc. (1999) 20 Cal.4th 1103, 1108.)  Assuming the “prevailing party” requirements are met, the trial court has no discretion to order each party to bear his or her own costs of suit.  (Michell v. Olick (1996) 49 Cal.App.4th 1194, 1198; Nelson v. Anderson (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 111, 129.)  Courts have held that the cost shifting provisions of CCP § 998 apply in UIM arbitrations, absent contractual language to the contrary. (Pilimai v. Farmers Ins. Exch. Co. (2006) 39 Cal. 4th 133, 139-145; Storm v. Standard Fire Ins. Co. (2020) 52 Cal. App. 5th 636.) Progressive contends Pfeiffer’s section 998 offer of $84,999.99 fell short of the arbitration award of $35,290, and therefore Pfeiffer is not entitled to costs. The Court agrees.   CCP § 998 provides in relevant part: “(a) The costs allowed under Sections 1031 and 1032 shall be withheld or augmented as provided in this section. …  (d) If an offer made by a plaintiff is not accepted and the defendant fails to obtain a more favorable judgment or award in any action or proceeding other than an eminent domain action, the court or arbitrator, in its discretion, may require the defendant to pay a reasonable sum to cover postoffer costs of the services of expert witnesses, who are not regular employees of any party, actually incurred and reasonably necessary in either, or both, preparation for trial or arbitration, or during trial or arbitration, of the case by the plaintiff, in addition to plaintiff's costs.”  Claimant offered $84,999.99 under section 998, which was not accepted. Progressive obtained a more favorable judgment because the arbitration award of $35,290 against Progressive is less than the amount Claimant offered. Thus, a straightforward reading of CCP § 998 provides that the cost shifting provisions do not apply here. Progressive’s own section 998 offer of $15,001.00 is immaterial in this context, because Claimant obtained a more favorable judgment and thus Claimant is not obligated to pay Progressive’s costs under section 998 (c)(1) – this, however, is not the issue of the present motion. The policy behind the statutory penalty for a party who rejects an offer to compromise and then fails to obtain a more favorable judgment is to encourage settlement by providing a strong financial disincentive to a party, whether it be a plaintiff or a defendant, who fails to achieve a better result than that party could have achieved by accepting his or her opponent's settlement offer; conversely, by awarding costs to the putative settler, the statute provides a financial incentive to make reasonable settlement offers. (Madrigal v. Hyundai Motor Am. (2023) 90 Cal. App. 5th 385, 398.) Here, Claimant did not achieve a better result between the offer and the actual arbitration award against Progressive. Thus, Claimant is not entitled to costs under section 998, and to hold otherwise would contravene the plain reading and purpose of the statute.  Based on the foregoing, Progressive’s motion to tax costs in its entirety is GRANTED.
