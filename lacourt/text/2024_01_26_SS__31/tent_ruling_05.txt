MOTION
TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES TO DISCOVERY 



 
MOVING PARTY:               Plaintiffs
NBZ Investments, LLC, et al.
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     Defendant Castle
Mortgage Corporation
 
 
On May 5, 2023, Plaintiffs, NBZ Investments, LLC, and Neda
and Behzad Zaman, filed this motion to compel Defendant, Castle Mortgage
Corporation, to provide further responses to Plaintiffs’ Request for Production
of Documents, Set Two, Nos. 93-109.  Plaintiffs
request sanctions against Defendant and its counsel.  The motion is accompanied by a concise
outline of the discovery issues rather than a separate statement.
 
            The parties
have not participated in an Informal Discovery Conference (IDC) prior to the hearing
of this motion.  The court further notes that Plaintiffs have filed two
other motions to compel which are set to be heard on January 30, 2024 and
February 16, 2024.  The parties have yet
to participate in an IDC with respect to those motions.  Accordingly, the court will continue this
motion and the January 30, 2024 motion to February 16, 2024 at 8:30 a.m. to
allow the parties to participate in an IDC. 
The parties are to notify the court if more time is needed to schedule
an IDC.
 
Clerk of the Court to give notice.
