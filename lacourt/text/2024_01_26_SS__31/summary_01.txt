The tentative ruling grants the defendant's unopposed motion to enforce the court's orders by issuing judgment on monetary sanctions and to issue a writ of execution. The defendant seeks to enforce the court's orders imposing monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,640.00, which the plaintiff and plaintiff's counsel failed to pay. The court grants the motion based on the defendant's argument that sanctions orders have the force and effect of a money judgment and are immediately enforceable through execution. The court orders the defendant to give notice and encourages the parties to meet and confer to reach an agreement. If a party intends to submit on this tentative ruling, they must send an email to the court with the subject line "SUBMIT" followed by the case number.
