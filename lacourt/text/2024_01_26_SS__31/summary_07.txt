And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to compel the defendant's deposition. The defendant, Johann Peeters, had objected to the deposition and refused to provide alternate dates. The judge finds that the defendant's objection was invalid and that the plaintiff's motion is timely. The judge orders the defendant to appear for deposition and imposes sanctions against the defendant in the amount of $1,060. The sanctions are mandatory and are intended to punish the defendant for his failure to comply with the discovery process.
