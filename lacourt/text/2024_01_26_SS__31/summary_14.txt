Summary in English:

The Judge, Michelle C. Kim, has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Norma Morrison v. PIH Health Good Samaritan Hospital, ET AL. The case involves a fall on hospital property, allegedly caused by the security guard's pushing of a patient into the plaintiff. The defendant has moved to strike the allegations and prayer for punitive damages, which the Judge has granted. The Judge found that the allegations do not rise to the level of despicable conduct required for punitive damages and that the plaintiff's claims are based on negligence rather than malice, oppression, or fraud. The Judge also denied the plaintiff's request for leave to amend the complaint to state a claim for punitive damages. The Judge ordered the parties to meet and confer after reading the tentative ruling to see if they can reach an agreement, and if not, to submit written arguments or appear remotely or in person for oral argument.
