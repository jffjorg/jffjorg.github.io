Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has considered the motions to compel discovery responses and sanctions filed by Plaintiff Jose Morales against Defendant Jose Noyola. The Court finds that Defendant failed to respond to Plaintiff's discovery requests, despite being properly served and having failed to object. The Court grants Plaintiff's motions to compel discovery responses and orders Defendant to serve verified responses to Plaintiff's form interrogatories and request for production of documents without objections within 20 days.

The Court also awards sanctions to Plaintiff in the amount of $250 for the motion to compel form interrogatories only. The Court reduces the amount requested due to a technical error in the declaration supporting the motion to compel request for production of documents.

The Court orders Defendant and Defendant's counsel to pay sanctions to Plaintiff in the total amount of $250 within 20 days. The Court encourages the parties to meet and confer to reach an agreement, and if they do not, they should arrange to appear remotely or in person for oral argument.
