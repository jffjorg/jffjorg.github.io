MOTION
FOR JUDGMENT ON THE PLEADINGS



 
MOVING PARTY:               Plaintiff
Morrison Express Corporation (USA)
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     No opposition
 
 
I.          BACKGROUND
 
            On February 24, 2023, Plaintiff, Morrison Express
Corporation (USA), filed a Complaint against Defendant, MFS Supply, LLC, for (1)
breach of written contract, (2) breach of oral contract, (3) account stated, and
(4) quantum meruit.  As alleged,
Plaintiff’s business includes importing, freight forwarding and logistical services.  Pursuant to a written and oral contract, Plaintiff
provided such services to Defendant. The bill amounted to $80,290.70.  Defendant did not pay the bill. 
 
            On April
24, 2023, Plaintiff served Defendant with discovery requests, including
Requests for Admissions (RFA), Set One. 
Defendant did not respond to the RFAs. 
On July 31, 2023, Plaintiff filed a motion to deem the RFAs admitted against
Defendant.  The court granted the
unopposed motion on September 12, 2023.  Plaintiff
served Defendant with a Notice of Ruling on the same day.
 
            On October 31,
2023, Plaintiff filed this motion for judgment on the pleadings based on the
deemed admissions.  Plaintiff seeks a
judgment in the sum of $102,346.94, consisting of the principal amount due of
$80,290.70 as stated in the Complaint, $13,302.24 in interest, $8,019.00 in
attorney fees, and $735.00 for costs of suit. 
 The motion was served on Defendant
by mail.
 
            Defendant
has not filed an Opposition.
 
II.        LEGAL STANDARD FOR JUDGMENT ON THE
PLEADINGS
 
“A motion for
judgment on the pleadings performs the same function as a general demurrer, and
hence attacks only defects disclosed on the face of the pleadings or by matters
that can be judicially noticed.  [Citations.]”  (Burnett v.
Chimney Sweep (2004) 123 Cal.App.4th 1057, 1064.)  The court must
assume the truth of all properly pleaded material facts and allegations, but
not contentions or conclusions of fact or law.  (Blank v. Kirwan
(1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318; Wise v. Pacific Gas and Elec. Co. (2005) 132
Cal.App.4th 725, 738.)  “A judgment on the pleadings in favor of the
defendant is appropriate when the complaint fails to allege facts sufficient to
state a cause of action.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 438, subd.
(c)(3)(B)(ii).)”  (Kapsimallis v. Allstate
Ins. Co. (2002) 104
Cal.App.4th 667, 672.)  “Presentation of extrinsic evidence is therefore
not proper on a motion for judgment on the pleadings.  [Citation.]” 
(Cloud v. Northrop Grumman Corp. (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 995, 999.) 
Allegations are to be liberally construed. (Code Civ. Proc., § 452.)  In
construing the allegations, the court is to give effect to specific factual
allegations that may modify or limit inconsistent general or conclusory
allegations. (Financial Corporation of America v. Wilburn (1987) 189
Cal.App.3rd 764, 769.)   
 
If the motion for judgment on the pleadings is granted, it
may be granted with or without leave to amend. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 438, subd.
(h)(1).)  “Where a demurrer is
sustained or a motion for judgment on the pleadings is granted as to the
original complaint, denial of leave to amend constitutes an abuse of discretion
if the pleading does not show on its face that it is incapable of
amendment.”  (Virginia G. v. ABC
Unified School Dist. (1993) 15 Cal.App.4th 1848, 1852 (emphasis
added).)
 
A failure to oppose a motion may
be deemed a consent to the granting of the motion.  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 8.54(c).)
 
III.      DISCUSSION
 
A.    Judicial Notice
Plaintiff requests judicial notice of the following
documents: (1) the court’s 9/12/2023 minute order granting Plaintiff’s motion
to deem matters admitted (Request for Judicial Notice (RJN) 1), and (2) Plaintiff’s
motion to deem matters admitted which includes the RFAs served on Defendant
(RJN 2.).  
The unopposed request is GRANTED.  (Evid. Code, § 452, subd. (d); Pang
v. Beverly Hospital, Inc. (2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 986, 989-90.)
B.    
Meet and Confer 
 
The parties shall meet and confer in person or by telephone
at least five days before the date a motion for judgment on the pleadings is
filed.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 439, subd. (a)(2).)  Plaintiff’s counsel has not satisfied the
meet and confer requirement.  (See generally
Declaration of Jeffrey S. Flashman.)  However, a determination by the court that the meet and confer
process was insufficient shall not be grounds to grant or deny the motion for
judgment on the pleadings. (Code Civ. Proc., § 439, subd. (a)(4).)  Accordingly, the court exercise its
discretion to consider the merits of the motion.
 
C.    
Timeliness
 
            According
to Code of Civil Procedure, section 438, subdivision (e), “[n]o motion may be
made pursuant to this section if a pretrial conference order has been entered
pursuant to Section 575, or within 30 days of the date the action is initially
set for trial, whichever is later, unless the court otherwise permits.”  
 
            Here, this
motion was filed on October 31, 2023.  A
pretrial conference order has not been entered and trial is currently scheduled
for February 20, 2024.  The court finds
the motion is timely.
 
D.   
Analysis
 
            Plaintiff
argues the motion should be granted because the truth of the RFAs have been
deemed admitted against Defendant.  Specifically,
the following admissions have been deemed admitted: 
 
o  
Defendant is liable to Plaintiff for
breach of written and oral contract.  (RJN
2, RFA Nos. 53 and 54.)
o  
Defendant is liable to Plaintiff for
interest at the rate of 1.5% per month pursuant to contract.  (RJN 2, RFA No. 55.)
o  
Defendant is liable to Plaintiff for
attorney’s fees pursuant to contract.  (RJN
2, RFA No. 56.)
o  
Defendant is liable to Plaintiff in
the total sum of $80,290.70 for unpaid invoices.  (RJN 2, RFA Nos. 4-52.)
 
            These
admissions conclusively establish Plaintiff’s claims against Defendant.  Defendant provides no argument to the
contrary.
 
IV.       CONCLUSION
 
Accordingly,
the unopposed motion for judgment on the pleadings is GRANTED.  
 
Moving party to give notice.
