And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling grants Defendant Cazares' unopposed motion to compel discovery responses from Plaintiff Ruiz. Defendant Cazares propounded form interrogatories on June 6, 2023, but Plaintiff Ruiz failed to respond by the deadline. Despite a granted extension, Plaintiff Ruiz has still not served responses. The court finds that Defendant Cazares has shown that it properly served the discovery requests, the time to respond has expired, and Plaintiff Ruiz failed to provide a timely response. As a result, the court orders Plaintiff Ruiz to serve verified responses to Defendant Cazares' form interrogatories without objections within 15 days.

Additionally, the court awards sanctions to Defendant Cazares in the amount of $560, which includes $500 in attorney's fees and $60 in filing fees. The court also orders Plaintiff Ruiz and her counsel to pay sanctions jointly and severally.
