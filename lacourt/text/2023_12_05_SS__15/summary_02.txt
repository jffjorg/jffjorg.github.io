And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling by the judge grants the motion for trial preference filed by plaintiff Vito Mirabile. Mr. Mirabile, who is 75 years old and has malignant pleural mesothelioma, has a significant decrease in physical and mental stamina and suffers from congestive heart failure, high PSA, limited mobility, and takes numerous medications. The court finds that Mr. Mirabile has a substantial interest in the action and needs a preference to prevent prejudicing his interest in the litigation due to his declining health. The defendants opposed the motion, arguing that the medical records are stale and unreliable and that Mr. Mirabile's declaration contradicts the medical records. However, the court finds that the most recent evidence supports the conclusion that preference is necessary to allow Mr. Mirabile to participate in the litigation and trial while he is still physically and mentally able. The trial is scheduled for April 1, 2024 at 9 a.m., and a status conference regarding the trial setting order is set for December 12, 2023 at 9:00 a.m.
