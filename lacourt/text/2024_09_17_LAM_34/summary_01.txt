And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge denies the defendants' motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication, which was filed in response to the plaintiff's First Amended Complaint (FAC). The FAC alleges that the defendants, Carlos Sotelo and VIP Enterprises, Inc. dba KW VIP Properties, failed to represent the plaintiff in the purchase of real property as agreed upon in the Purchase Agreement. The plaintiff claims that the defendants made misrepresentations to the seller's brokers about the plaintiff's reasons for canceling the Purchase Agreement, which resulted in the plaintiff losing $225,000 and incurring legal fees.

The Judge finds that the defendants have not met their initial burden of proof to show that there are no triable issues of material fact. The court does not agree with the defendants' arguments that the gravamen of the FAC is indemnity and that the seller's Amended Counterclaim is relevant to the FAC. The Judge concludes that the FAC alleges negligence and breach of fiduciary duty by the defendants, and denies the motion for summary judgment.
