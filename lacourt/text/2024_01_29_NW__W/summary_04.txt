And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to strike portions of the plaintiff's complaint, but with leave to amend. The defendant argued that the plaintiff's complaint fails to plead specific facts sufficient to support a claim for punitive damages, as required by California Civil Code §3294. The judge agreed that the plaintiff has not sufficiently alleged that the defendant intended to injure the plaintiff, and that the plaintiff's allegations are based on mere negligence rather than intentional behavior. The judge also found that the plaintiff has not sufficiently alleged that a managing agent of the defendant was involved in the alleged wrongful conduct. However, the judge did find that the plaintiff has alleged facts that could support a claim of intentional behavior, including the defendant's failure to disclose material facts and its failure to maintain the premises in a reasonably safe condition. The judge gave the plaintiff leave to amend its complaint to correct these deficiencies.
