And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on Defendant Jomar Construction, Inc.'s motion for a good faith settlement. The motion was unopposed, and the court found that the settlement was made in good faith. The settlement was for a full dismissal, release, and payment of $30,000. The court considered the factors set forth in Tech-Bilt Inc. v. Woodward-Clyde & Associates, including a rough approximation of the plaintiff's total recovery, the amount paid in settlement, and the allocation of settlement proceeds among plaintiffs. The court also considered the financial conditions and insurance policy limits of the settling defendants, as well as the existence of any collusion, fraud, or tortious conduct aimed to injure the interests of non-settling defendants. The court concluded that the settlement was made in good faith and granted the motion.
