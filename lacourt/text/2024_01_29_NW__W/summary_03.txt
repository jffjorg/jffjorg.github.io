Summary of the Tentative Ruling:

The Court has ruled in favor of the Plaintiff, Marshall R. Cole, on the demurrer filed by the Defendants, Kamran Fattahi and Kathy Hosseini. The Court has found that the Plaintiff has sufficiently alleged a cause of action for negligence, trespass, nuisance, and wrongful discharge of water. The Court has overruled the Defendants' demurrer to each of these causes of action, finding that the Plaintiff has alleged sufficient facts to support each claim. The Court's ruling is based on the allegations in the Plaintiff's complaint, which describe a landslide that occurred on January 9-10, 2023, and the resulting damage to the Plaintiff's property. The Court has found that the Plaintiff has alleged a legal duty owed by the Defendants to use due care, a breach of that duty, causation, and damage to the Plaintiff's property, and that the Defendants failed to properly maintain their property, leading to the landslide.
