And here is the English text summary:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge Thomas D. Long granting in part the motion for sanctions brought by Plaintiff BRAVHART LP against Defendant DAVID BLAIR SHOTTS et al. The motion was filed on July 3, 2024, and the Court heard the motion on July 15, 2024. The Court found that the Defendant failed to comply with the Court's Standing Order and was not ready to try the case on the date of the trial, June 17, 2024. The Court ordered Defendant's counsel to pay sanctions of $1,343.00 to Plaintiff's counsel within 30 days. The Jury Trial remains scheduled for July 29, 2024 at 9:00 a.m. If any party is not prepared for trial on that date, the Court may construe that unreadiness as a waiver of their demand for a jury.
