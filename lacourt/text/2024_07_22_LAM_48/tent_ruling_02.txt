Semerjian is not counsel of record for Defendant, and Defendant’s actual counsel
of record states that she is the lead trial attorney and “a solo practitioner.”  (Cole Decl. ¶¶ 1, 12.)  This Department’s Courtroom Information requires
lead trial counsel to appear in person at the FSC and at trial.  (See also LASC Local Rule 3.25(f)(2).)
