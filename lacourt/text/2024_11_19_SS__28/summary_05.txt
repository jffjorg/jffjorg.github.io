And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling sustaining the demurrer to the first amended complaint filed by Ivan Garcia against the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority. The demurrer was filed by the defendant, and the judge found that the first amended complaint still does not plead with particularity facts that support a claim against a public entity under Vehicle Code section 17001. The judge notes that the complaint does not specifically describe the nature of the alleged "wrongful act or omission" or "negligence" of the defendant or its agents or employees. The judge grants the defendant 30 days leave to amend the complaint.
