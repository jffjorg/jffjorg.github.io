And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying without prejudice the petition to approve the compromise of minor plaintiff Toahiti Chong's claims filed by his guardian ad litem Darlene Chong. The petition seeks approval of a $300,000 settlement, which includes medical expenses paid by various parties. However, the petition lacks sufficient evidence to support the assertions about medical expenses paid by Aloha Care, a private health insurance or self-funded plan, and waiving reimbursement of those expenses. The court also finds that the petition does not provide sufficient evidence to support the assertions about the amount charged by Cedars Sinai Medical Center and the amount by which those charges were reduced. As a result, the court denies the petition without prejudice and orders the petitioner to file proof of service of this ruling with the court within five days.
