The Court finds that Lemus has failed to show new or different facts, circumstances, or law to support his motion. The Court denies Lemus's motion for reconsideration and affirms its previous order denying the motions to compel. The Court orders the moving party to give notice of this ruling and to file proof of service of this ruling with the Court within five days.
