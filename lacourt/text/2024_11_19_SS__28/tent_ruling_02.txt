LEGAL STANDARD 
          Code of Civil Procedure section

“(a) If a
subpoena requires the attendance of a witness or the production of books,
documents, electronically stored information, or other things before a court,
or at the trial of an issue therein, or at the taking of a deposition, the
court, upon motion reasonably made by any person described in subdivision (b),
or upon the court’s own motion after giving counsel notice and an opportunity
to be heard, may make an order quashing the subpoena entirely, modifying it, or
directing compliance with it upon those terms or conditions as the court shall
declare, including protective orders. In addition, the court may make any other
order as may be appropriate to protect the person from unreasonable or
oppressive demands, including unreasonable violations of the right of privacy
of the person. 
“(b) The
following persons may make a motion pursuant to subdivision (a): 
“(1) A party. 
“(2) A
witness. 
“(3) A
consumer described in Section 1985.3. 
“(4) An
employee described in Section 1985.6. 
“(5) A person
whose personally identifying information, as defined in subdivision (b) of
Section 1798.79.8 of the Civil Code, is sought in connection with an underlying
action involving that person’s exercise of free speech rights.
