PARTY’S REQUEST 
Lemus asks the Court to reconsider its order denying
Lemus’s motions to compel Magali Manzanares’s and Richard
Manzanares’s further responses to requests for production of documents and
requests for admission and for sanctions. 
LEGAL STANDARDS 
Code of Civil
Procedure section 1008, subdivision (a), provides: 
“(a)    When an
application for an order has been made to a judge, or to a court, and refused
in whole or in part, or granted, or granted conditionally, or on terms, any
party affected by the order may, within 10 days after service upon the party of
written notice of entry of the order and based upon new or different facts,
circumstances, or law, make application to the same judge or court that made
the order, to reconsider the matter and modify, amend, or revoke the prior
order. The party making the application shall state by affidavit what
application was made before, when and to what judge, what order or decisions
were made, and what new or different facts, circumstances, or law are claimed
to be shown.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1008, subd. (a).) 
          The
party moving for reconsideration under Code of Civil Procedure section 1008,
subdivision (a), “must provide a satisfactory explanation for failing to
present the information at the first hearing; i.e., a showing of reasonable
diligence.”  (L. Edmon & C. Karnow,
Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (Rutter 2024) ¶ 9:329, p.
9(l)-162.) 
DISCUSSION 
Lemus asks the Court to reconsider its September 10,
2024 order denying Lemus’s motions to compel further discovery responses.  According to Lemus, before the September 10,
2024 hearing, Lemus’s waiver or abandonment of his right to proceed with these
motions “was not an issue that was raised at any time, either by the Court or
Defendants.” 
In fact, on April 30, 2024, in opposition to Lemus’s
motion to compel further responses to requests for production, Magali
Manzanares argued, “. . . [T]here is the problem of [Lemus’s] delay: no
explanation or justification is given for [Lemus’s] failure to refile the
subject motion until four months after the original dates were vacated. Based
on this conduct and belated refiling, the court should consider the motion as
having been abandoned and deny it. [Citations.]”  (4/30/24 Opposition p. 2.) 
The Court finds that Lemus has failed to show new or
different facts, circumstances, or law. 
The Court denies Lemus's motion for reconsideration.
CONCLUSION 
          The
Court DENIES Plaintiff Rolando Lemus’s motion for
reconsideration of the Court’s September 10, 2024 order. 
Moving party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Moving party is ordered to file the proof of service
of this ruling with the Court within five days.
