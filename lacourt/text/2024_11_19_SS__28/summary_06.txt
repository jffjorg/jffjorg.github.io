And here is a summary in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Mario Alfredo Martinez Herrera and Mario Martinez Tochez v. Precision Moving & Storage Corporation. The Court grants the defendant's motion to compel the plaintiff's responses to requests for production of documents, special interrogatories, and form interrogatories. The Court orders the plaintiff to serve verified code-compliant responses without objections and to produce the requested documents and information by December 19, 2024.

The Court denies the defendant's request for monetary sanctions, as the plaintiff did not make or oppose a motion to compel responses to interrogatories or a demand for inspection. The Court finds that other statutes addressing misuse of the discovery process do not allow for a sanctions award in this case.

The Court's ruling is based on California Code of Civil Procedure sections 2030.290, 2031.300, and 2023.010, which govern the discovery process and the imposition of sanctions. The Court cites the California Supreme Court's decision in City of Los Angeles v. Pricewaterhousecoopers, LLP (2024) 17 Cal.5th 46, which holds that a court may not rely on section 2023.030 to override the limitations prescribed by other applicable sanctions provisions.
