  Case Number:  20STCV48628    Hearing Date:   November 19, 2024    Dept:  28           Having considered the petitioning papers, the Court rules  as follows.  BACKGROUND  On  December 21, 2020, Plaintiff Toahiti Chong (“Plaintiff”), a minor, by and  through his guardian ad litem Darlene Chong, filed this action against  Defendants City of Los Angeles, Blueberry & Chicken, LLC, and Does 1-25 for  general negligence and premises liability.  On  February 10, 2021, Defendant Blueberry & Chicken, LLC filed an answer.  On  February 24, 2023, the Court dismissed Defendant Blueberry & Chicken LLC  without prejudice at Plaintiff’s request.  On  December 22, 2023, Plaintiff filed a notice of settlement.  On October  8, 2024, Petitioner Darlene Chong (“Petitioner”) filed a petition to approve  the compromise of minor Plaintiff’s action.  PETITIONER’S REQUESTS  Petitioner  asks the Court to approve the compromise of the pending action of minor Plaintiff  Toahiti Chong.  DISCUSSION  The  petition provides the following information:  Gross  settlement amount:                               $300,000.00 Total  medical expenses:                                  $142,315.54 Medical  expenses paid:                                   $17,045.09 Reductions:                                                     $123,289.71           To be paid/reimbursed from proceeds:             $1,980.74           Liens:                                                              0 (12a(5)) or $1,980.74 (12b(5)(a)(ii))           Attorney’s fees:                                              $90,000.00           Costs:                                                              $5,294.29           Net balance:                                                    $202,724.97  Section  12a(1) of the petition states that total medical expenses were $142,315.54.  Section 12a(3) of the petition states that  this amount was subject to $123,289.71 in reductions. This should mean that the  remaining amount ($19,025.83) is to be reimbursed from the settlement proceeds.  However, Section 12a(4) states that only $1,980.74 is to be paid or reimbursed  from the settlement proceeds.  Petitioner  attempts to account for the remaining $17,045.09 in medical expenses by  asserting in Section 12b(2) of the petition that “Aloha Care,” described as “private  health insurance or a self-funded plan,” paid $17,045.09 of Plaintiff’s medical expenses and does  not request reimbursement.  However, Petitioner  has not filled out the portion of Section 12b(2), which requires Petitioner to  specify whether Aloha Care is (a) an Employee Retirement Income Security Act  (ERISA) insured plan, (b) an ERISA self-funded plan, (c) a Non-ERISA insured  plan, or (d) a Non-ERISA self-funded plan.   In addition, Petitioner has not provided evidence supporting her  assertions that (1) Aloha Care paid $17,045.09 of Plaintiff’s medical expenses and  (2) Aloha Care does not request reimbursement of $17,045.09 from the settlement  proceeds.  Section 12b(5)(b)(i) of the petition states that House Call Doctor charged  $500.00 for medical care, received payment of $500.00, and did not reduce the  charges.  Petitioner has submitted a  receipt stating that Plaintiff paid the bill for $500.00 and no insurance  covered the bill.  Section 12b(5)(b)(ii) of the petition states that Cedars  Sinai Medical Center charged $138,336.12 for medical care, received payment of $16,545.09, and reduced the amount owed by $121,791.03.  Section 12b(5)(b)(ii) also states that no  amount of these charges will be paid from the settlement proceeds.  Petitioner has not submitted evidence  supporting the assertions about the amount Cedars Sinai charged, the amount by which Cedars Sinai reduced its charges, and the amount Cedars Sinai was paid.  Together, the amounts paid to House Call Doctor and Cedars  Sinai total $17,045.09, the amount which Petitioner asserts Aloha Care paid and  does not seek reimbursement for.  However, as noted, Petitioner has not provided evidence supporting the assertions about Aloha Care's payment of medical expenses and waiver of reimbursement.  In addition, the receipt from House Care Doctor states that Plaintiff, not  insurance, paid the $500.00 bill.   The  Court denies the petition.  CONCLUSION  The  Court DENIES without prejudice the petition to approve the compromise of minor  Plaintiff Toahiti Chong’s claims filed by Petitioner Darlene Chong on October 8,  2024.  Petitioner  is ordered to give notice of this ruling.  Petitioner  is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court within  five days.
