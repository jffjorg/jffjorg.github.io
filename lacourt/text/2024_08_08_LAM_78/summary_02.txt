And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants in part the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to requests for production of documents (RPDs) from the defendant, Rampart Investment Corp. The defendant had failed to provide code-compliant responses to the RPDs, and the plaintiff had repeatedly requested further responses. The judge finds that the defendant's responses were deficient and fails to specify why it is unable to respond to certain requests. The judge also agrees with the plaintiff that the defendant's objections to certain requests are valid because they are not narrowly tailored and violate confidentiality rights of third parties.

The judge grants the motion to compel further responses to RPDs, set one, as to Nos. 1-24 and Nos. 28-32 only, and orders the defendant to provide further code-compliant responses to these requests within 20 days. The judge also awards sanctions to the plaintiff, including 2 hours of attorney fees at a reduced rate of $400 per hour and one motion filing fee of $60, for a total of $800 in attorney fees and $60 in costs. The judge orders the defendant and/or its counsel to pay sanctions to the plaintiff in the total amount of $860 within 20 days.
