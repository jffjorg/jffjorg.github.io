 Case Number:  22STCV16957    Hearing Date:   April 9, 2024    Dept:  28 Having
considered the petitioning papers, the Court rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On
May 23, 2022, Plaintiff Gianni Ortu (“Plaintiff”), by his guardian ad litem
Nataliya Ortu, filed this action against Defendants Alba Sierra (“Defendant”)
and Does 1-10 for motor vehicle negligence. 
On
October 10, 2022, Defendant filed an answer. 
On
February 23, 2024, Petitioner Nataliya Ortu (“Petitioner”) filed a petition to
approve the compromise of Plaintiff’s action, to be heard on April 9, 2024. 
Trial
is currently scheduled for May 20, 2024. 
PETITIONER’S REQUEST 
Petitioner
Nataliya Ortu asks the Court to approve the compromise of the pending action of
Plaintiff Gianni Ortu. 
DISCUSSION      
Based
on the attachments, it appears that Plaintiff’s total medical expenses were $1,057,299.75
($1,021,199.17 for Rawlings/Kaiser plus $36,100.58 for Medi-Cal). Therefore, Section 12a(1) of the petition (total
medical expenses) apparently should be $1,057,299.75, not $1,021,199.17. 
Based
on the attachments, the total reduction amount appears to be $1,049,662.36.  (Medical expenses billed to Rawlings of $1,021,199.17 minus reimbursement
of $5,500 comes to $1,015,699.17 in reductions. 
For Medi-Cal, payments $36,100.58 minus reimbursement of $2,137.39 comes
to $33,963.19 in reductions.  Together, the
reduction amounts ($1,015,699.17 plus $33,963.19) come to $1,049,662.36.)  Therefore, Section 12a(3) of the petition
(amount of negotiated, statutory, and contractual reductions) apparently should be
$1,049,662.36, not $1,013,561.78. 
The difference
between the total medical expenses ($1,057,299.75) and the total reduction
amount ($1,049,662.36) is $7,637.39, the amount to be paid or reimbursed from
the settlement proceeds.  Therefore, Section 12a(4) of the petition, which lists $7,637.39
as the total medical expenses to be paid or reimbursed from the settlement
proceeds, appears to be correct.  Section
12a(5), the lien amount, also appears to be correct. 
Section
12a(2) of the petition (medical expenses paid) apparently should be $826,578.68,
not $790,478.10.  ($790,478.10 paid by the
plan plus $36,100.58 paid by Medi-Cal).  Section
12b(4) (amount paid by Medi-Cal) should be $36,100.58, not $38,100.58 based on the letter from the
Department of Health Care Services. 
The
figure in Section 12b(2)(f)(ii)(B) apparently should be $784,978.10, not $5,500.00 (the
amount of the reduction from the plan’s payment of $790,478.10 to the $5,500.00 amount it will accept as reimbursement).  $5,500.00 should be entered in the last line of
12b(2)(f), which asks for the amount of total reimbursement to the plan. 
Petitioner
must submit a proposed order along with a revised petition. 
CONCLUSION 
The Court DENIES without prejudice the petition for
approval of the compromise of the pending action of Plaintiff Gianni Ortu filed
by Petitioner Nataliya Ortu on February 23, 2024. 
          Petitioner is ordered to give notice of the ruling. 
Petitioner
is ordered to file the proof of service of the ruling with the Court within
five days.
