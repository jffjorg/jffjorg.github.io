  Case Number:  21STCV16121    Hearing Date:   April 9, 2024    Dept:  28 Having  considered the moving papers, the Court rules as follows.  BACKGROUND  On  April 28, 2021, Plaintiff Joshua Olaoniye (“Plaintiff”)  filed this action against Defendants Goldenvoice, LLC (“Goldenvoice”), AEG  Presents, LLC (“AEG”), Apex Security Group, Inc. (“Apex”), and Does 1-50 for  negligence and battery.  On  October 11, 2022, Apex filed an answer.  On  October 31, 2022, Plaintiff filed a first amended complaint against the same  defendants for negligence, battery and  false imprisonment.  On  February 1, 2023, the Court sustained Apex’s demurrer to Plaintiff’s false  imprisonment claim without leave to amend and granted Apex’s motion to strike  Plaintiff’s request for attorney’s fees with leave to amend.  On  March 16, 2023, Apex filed an answer.  On  March 12, 2024, Apex filed a motion for terminating sanctions or, in the  alternative, for issue and evidentiary sanctions, and for monetary sanctions,  to be heard on April 9, 2024.  Plaintiff  has not filed an opposition.  The  trial is currently set for September 9, 2024.  PARTY’S REQUESTS  Apex  asks the Court to issue terminating sanctions or, in the alternative, issue  and/or evidentiary sanctions. Apex also asks the Court to award monetary  sanctions.  LEGAL STANDARD  A.   Monetary, issue, evidentiary, and terminating  sanctions  Code  of Civil Procedure section 2023.030 provides in part:  “To the extent authorized by the chapter governing any  particular discovery method or any other provision of this title, the court,  after notice to any affected party, person, or attorney, and after opportunity  for hearing, may impose the following sanctions against anyone engaging in  conduct that is a misuse of the discovery process:  “(a) The court may impose a monetary sanction ordering  that one engaging in the misuse of the discovery process, or any attorney  advising that conduct, or both pay the reasonable expenses, including  attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct. The court may  also impose this sanction on one unsuccessfully asserting that another has  engaged in the misuse of the discovery process, or on any attorney who advised  that assertion, or on both. If a monetary sanction is authorized by any provision  of this title, the court shall impose that sanction unless it finds that the  one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other  circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.  “(b) The court may impose an  issue sanction ordering that designated facts shall be taken as established in  the action in accordance with the claim of the party adversely affected by the  misuse of the discovery process. The court may also impose an issue sanction by  an order prohibiting any party engaging in the misuse of the discovery process  from supporting or opposing designated claims or defenses.  “(c) The  court may impose an evidence sanction by an order prohibiting any party  engaging in the misuse of the discovery process from introducing designated  matters in evidence.  “(d) The court may impose a terminating sanction by  one of the following orders:  “(1) An order striking out the pleadings or parts of  the pleadings of any party engaging in the misuse of the discovery process.  “(2) An order staying further proceedings by that  party until an order for discovery is obeyed.  “(3) An order dismissing the action, or any part of  the action, of that party.  “(4) An order rendering a judgment by default against  that party.  “(e) The court may impose a contempt sanction by an  order treating the misuse of the discovery process as a contempt of court.  “(f) (1) Notwithstanding subdivision (a), or any other  section of this title, absent exceptional circumstances, the court shall not  impose sanctions on a party or any attorney of a party for failure to provide  electronically stored information that has been lost, damaged, altered, or  overwritten as the result of the routine, good faith operation of an electronic  information system.  “(2) This subdivision shall not be construed to alter  any obligation to preserve discoverable information.  (Code Civ.  Proc., § 2023.030.)           B.   Sanctions for failure to comply with Court order compelling response to demand for inspection            Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.300, subdivision (c),  provides in part:   “If  a party . . . fails to obey [an] order [under Code of Civil Procedure section  2031.300, subdivision (b)] compelling a response [to a demand for inspection,  copying, testing, or sampling], the court may make those orders that are just,  including the imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a  terminating sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In  lieu of or in addition to this sanction, the court may impose a monetary  sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010).”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300,  subd. (c).)                C.   Sanctions for failure to comply with Court order compelling response to interrogatories  Code  of Civil Procedure section 2030.290, subdivision (c), provides in part:   “If  a party then fails to obey an order [under Code of Civil Procedure section  2030.290, subdivision (b)] compelling answers [to interrogatories], the court  may make those orders that are just, including the imposition of an issue  sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction under Chapter 7  (commencing with Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in addition to that sanction,  the court may impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with  Section 2023.010).”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (c).)  A  violation of a discovery order supports the imposition of terminating  sanctions. (Collison & Kaplan v. Hartunian (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th  1611, 1620.) Terminating sanctions are appropriate when a party persists in  disobeying the court's orders. (Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d  771, 795-796 (Deyo).)  A  terminating sanction is a "drastic measure which should be employed with  caution." (Deyo, supra, 84 Cal.App.3d at p. 793.) "A  decision to order terminating sanctions should not be made lightly. But where a  violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows  that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery  rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction." (Mileikowsky v. Tenet Healthsystem (2005)  128 Cal.App.4th 262, 279-280 (Mileikowsky).)    DISCUSSION  On  January 4, 2024, the Court made the following rulings:  ·                  The Court granted  the motion of Apex, AEG, and Goldenvoice to compel Plaintiff to attend his  deposition and ordered Plaintiff to appear for his deposition by February 5,  2024. ·                  The Court granted  Apex’s motion to compel Plaintiff to respond to Apex’s requests for production  of documents and ordered Plaintiff to provide verified, code-compliant  responses without objections and to produce the documents, electronically  stored information, and/or other things requested without objections by  February 5, 2024. ·                  The Court granted  Apex’s motion to compel Plaintiff to respond to Apex’s special interrogatories  and ordered Plaintiff to provide verified, code-compliant responses to the  special interrogatories without objections by February 5, 2024. ·                  The Court granted  Apex’s motion to compel Plaintiff to respond to Apex’s form interrogatories and  ordered Plaintiff to provide verified, code-compliant responses to the form  interrogatories without objections by February 5, 2024. ·                  The Court granted  Apex’s motion to deem admitted matters specified in Apex’s requests for  admission and deemed admitted the matters specified in Apex’s requests for  admission. ·                  The Court granted  Apex’s request for monetary sanctions and ordered Plaintiff and his counsel,  jointly and severally, to pay Apex $2,925.60, consisting of $1,240.65 for the  motion to compel Plaintiff’s deposition, $561.65 for the motion to compel  Plaintiff’s response to requests for production of documents, $561.65 for the  motion to compel Plaintiff’s response to interrogatories, and $561.65 for the  motion to deem admitted matters specified in requests for admission.  Apex  argues that Plaintiff has failed to comply with the January 4, 2024 order  because he has not provided verified code-compliant responses to the request for  production of documents, special interrogatories, or form interrogatories, and  has not paid the monetary sanctions.   Therefore, Apex argues, the Court should award terminating sanctions and  dismiss Plaintiff’s claims against Apex.  The  Court denies Apex’s request for terminating sanctions.  Plaintiff has violated one discovery order to  date.  Apex has not shown that less  severe sanctions would be ineffective in producing compliance with the  discovery rules. (See Mileikowsky, supra, 128 Cal.App.4th at pp. 279-280.)  In  the alternative, Apex asks the Court to impose issue or evidentiary sanctions  on Plaintiff by ruling, among other things that “Plaintiff [is] prohibited from  supporting his claim for negligence” and that “Plaintiff [is] prohibited from  supporting his claim for battery.”  The  requested rulings are indistinguishable from terminating sanctions, which the  Court has concluded are premature.  Apex  also asks the Court to impose issue or evidentiary sanctions based on the Court’s  January 4, 2024 order deeming admitted matters specified in Apex’s requests for  admission.  Because these facts are  already deemed admitted, the Court will not make duplicative findings in the  form of issue or evidentiary sanctions.  In  addition, Apex requests monetary sanctions of $3,861.65.  Sanctions are authorized by Code of Civil  Procedure sections 2031.300, subdivision (c) (failure to comply with order  compelling response to demand for inspection) and 2030.290, subdivision (c) (failure  to comply with order compelling response to interrogatories).  The request is based on ten hours of attorney  time at a rate of $280.00 per hour, a $61.65 filing fee, and $1,000.00 under  Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.050.  The  Court grants sanctions of $1,561.65 based on two hours of attorney time at a reasonable  rate of $250.00 per hour, one filing fee, and $1,000.00 under Code of Civil  Procedure section 2023.050 based on the Court’s finding that Plaintiff did not  respond in good faith to an inspection demand made under Code of Civil  Procedure section 2031.010.  (See Code  Civ. Proc., § 2023.050, subd. (a)(1).)  CONCLUSION  The  Court GRANTS IN PART Defendant Apex Security Group, Inc.’s motion for  terminating sanctions or, in the alternative, issue and evidentiary sanctions,  and monetary sanctions, and orders Plaintiff Joshua Olaoniye and his counsel, jointly and severally, to pay Defendant Apex Security Group,  Inc. $1,561.65 by May 3, 2024.  In all  other respects, the Court DENIES the motion.  The  Court sua sponte modifies its January 4, 2024 order to specify that Plaintiff Joshua Olaoniye and his counsel, jointly and  severally, are ordered to pay Defendant Apex Security Group, Inc. sanctions of  $2,925.60 by May 3, 2024.  Moving  party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.  Moving  party is ordered to file a proof of service of this ruling with the Court  within five days.
