And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the defendants' motion to stay proceedings, which was based on the argument that the parties and primary witnesses reside in Nevada and the plaintiff engaged in forum shopping. The judge finds that this motion is essentially a recycled version of the defendants' previous motion to dismiss on forum non conveniens grounds, and that the defendants have failed to meet their burden to justify a stay of the case. The judge also notes that the defendants' motion is untimely, as it was not made within the 10-day period allowed for motions for reconsideration. The judge further finds that the defendants' motion is an improper motion for reconsideration, disguised as a different type of motion seeking different relief while using the same arguments as the prior motion.
