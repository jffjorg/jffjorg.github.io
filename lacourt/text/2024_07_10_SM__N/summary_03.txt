Summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling denies Plaintiff HOF REO 1 LLC's motion for summary judgment or, in the alternative, summary adjudication. The motion is based on Plaintiff's allegations that Defendants Eliyahu Marciano and Anthony Marciano failed to pay rent since acquiring title to the property. The Judge finds that Plaintiff has not established its claim for unlawful detainer as to the first two notices, as they exceed the one-year limit. The Judge also finds that Plaintiff has not provided evidence that it informed Defendants of the name, telephone number, and address of the person or entity to whom rent payment must be made, as required by Civil Code section 1962, subdivision (c). The motion is denied.
