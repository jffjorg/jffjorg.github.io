 Case Number:  23SMCV03537    Hearing Date:   July 10, 2024    Dept:  N TENTATIVE RULINGPlaintiff Goldrich Kest, LLC’s Motion to Compel Further Responses from Certain Underwriters at Lloyd’s of London, Ategrity Specialty Insurance Company and Axis Surplus Lines Insurance Company to Requests for Production (Set One) and Special Interrogatories (Set One) is GRANTED in part. Defendants Certain Underwriters at Lloyd’s, London, Syndicate 4444; Ategrity Specialty Insurance Company; and Axis Surplus Insurance Company shall provide supplemental responses to Plaintiff Goldrich Kest, LLC’s Special Interrogatories (Set One) Nos. 3, 16, 17, 18, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 57, and 59 within thirty (30) days of entry of this order. Defendants Certain Underwriters at Lloyd’s, London, Syndicate 4444; Ategrity Specialty Insurance Company; and Axis Surplus Insurance Company shall provide supplemental responses to Plaintiff Goldrich Kest, LLC’s Requests for Production (Set One) Nos. 1, 2, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, and 16, insofar as Defendants have possession of, access to, or control of responsive documents, within thirty (30) days of entry of this order.Plaintiff Goldrich Kest, LLC to give notice.REASONINGIf a party that has propounded interrogatories or requests for production of documents believes that the responses received are evasive or incomplete, or that an objection to the interrogatories or requests for production of documents is without merit or too general, the propounding party may bring a motion to compel further responses to the interrogatories. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300, subd. (a), 2031.310, subd. (a); see also Best Products, Inc. v. Superior Court (2004) 119 Cal.App.4th 1181, 1189-1190 [motion to compel proper to challenge “boilerplate” responses].)“Unless notice of this motion is given within 45 days of the service of the verified response, or any supplemental verified response, or on or before any specific later date to which the propounding party and the responding party have agreed in writing, the propounding party waives any right to compel a further response” to the interrogatories or requests for production of documents. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300, subd. (c), 2031.310, subd. (c).) This timeliness requirement is mandatory, and in some sense may even be considered a matter of jurisdiction, and the Court therefore “[has] no power to make an order compelling further answers where the propounding party failed to serve this motion within the statutory time.” (Prof’l Career Colls., Magna Inst., Inc. v. Superior Court (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 490, 493; see also Vidal Sassoon, Inc. v. Superior Court (1983) 147 Cal.App.3d 681 [same].)   A motion to compel further responses must be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Code of Civil Procedure section 2016.040. (See Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300, subd. (b)(1), 2031.310, subd. (b)(2).) A meet and confer declaration must “state facts showing a reasonable and good faith attempt at an informal resolution of each issue presented by the motion.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2016.040.) California Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(a) requires that any motion to compel further responses to discovery contain a separate statement with the text of each request, the response, and a statement of factual and legal reasons for compelling further.Plaintiff Goldrich Kest, LLC (“Plaintiff”) moves for further responses to its Requests for Production (Set One) Nos. 1, 2, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, and 16 and Special Interrogatories (Set One) Nos. 3, 16, 17, 18, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 57, and 59 propounded on Defendants Certain Underwriters at Lloyd’s, London, Syndicate 4444; Ategrity Specialty Insurance Company; and Axis Surplus Insurance Company (“Defendants”); for an order requiring Defendants to search for, collect, and produce all documents and electronically-stored information responsive to Requests for Production Nos.1, 2, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, and 16; and for an order requiring Defendants to provide privilege logs identifying all responsive documents that have been withheld or redacted. Insofar as Plaintiff asks for further responses to its Special Interrogatories (Set One) Nos. 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, and 85, the Court will not order any such responses because those requests were not identified in the notice of motion. The Court also will not consider a request for sanctions that is not stated in the notice of motion. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.040.) The Court has reviewed the requests at issue, as well as Defendants’ responses to the same, and hereby rules as follows:Defendants shall provide supplemental responses to Special Interrogatories (Set One) Nos. 3, 16, 17, 18, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 57, and 59. Each of the interrogatories seeks discoverable information, specifically, information relevant to Defendants’ basic business operations, Defendants’ identification of certain employees involved with the claim at issue, and Defendants’ process as to the claim at issue. As to Requests for Production (Set One) Nos. 1, 2, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, and 16, Defendants must provide all documents responsive to these requests, as they, too, seek discoverable information. The Court cannot order Defendants to produce documents which do not exist. However, as to documents possessed by Defendants’ claims administrator, sub-consultants, and counsel, the Court will not order production of documents possessed by a third party which is not in Defendants’ possession and for which Defendants do not have access and control. The Court has not considered any supplemental responses here.Accordingly, Plaintiff Goldrich Kest, LLC’s Motion to Compel Further Responses from Certain Underwriters at Lloyd’s of London, Ategrity Specialty Insurance Company and Axis Surplus Lines Insurance Company to Requests for Production (Set One) and Special Interrogatories (Set One) is GRANTED in part. Defendants Certain Underwriters at Lloyd’s, London, Syndicate 4444; Ategrity Specialty Insurance Company; and Axis Surplus Insurance Company shall provide supplemental responses to Plaintiff Goldrich Kest, LLC’s Special Interrogatories (Set One) Nos. 3, 16, 17, 18, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 57, and 59 within thirty (30) days of entry of this order. Defendants Certain Underwriters at Lloyd’s, London, Syndicate 4444; Ategrity Specialty Insurance Company; and Axis Surplus Insurance Company shall provide supplemental responses to Plaintiff Goldrich Kest, LLC’s Requests for Production (Set One) Nos. 1, 2, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, and 16, insofar as Defendants have possession of, access to, or control of responsive documents, within thirty (30) days of entry of this order.
