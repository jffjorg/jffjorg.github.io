```

Here is a brief summary of the tentative ruling:

The Court has reviewed the motion to compel further responses to Defendant's Request for Production of Documents, Set One. The Court finds that Plaintiff has failed to provide complete and consistent discovery responses, and has engaged in discovery abuse. The Court will deny the motion to compel further responses, as Plaintiff has not shown that he has made a diligent search and reasonable inquiry for responsive documents. The Court will also decline to impose monetary sanctions in favor of Plaintiff, as Plaintiff has a history of discovery abuse and the Court finds it unjust to impose sanctions against Defendant.
