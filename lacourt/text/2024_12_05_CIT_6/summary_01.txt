And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court grants the petition to compel arbitration and stays the court action pending completion of the arbitration. The moving parties, Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, Inc., Kaiser Foundation Hospitals, and Southern California Permanente Medical Group, have met their burden of establishing the existence of a valid arbitration agreement between the parties. The agreement covers the plaintiff's medical malpractice claim, and the parties have failed to oppose the petition. Therefore, the court finds that the moving parties are entitled to an order compelling arbitration and staying the court action.
