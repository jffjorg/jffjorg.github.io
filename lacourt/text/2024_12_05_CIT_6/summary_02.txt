And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a lemon law case between Gilberto Guerrero (plaintiff) and American Honda Motor Co., Inc. et al. (defendants). The plaintiff filed a motion to compel further responses to his request for production of documents, set one, which includes 31 requests. The defendants opposed the motion, arguing that their responses were adequate and that some requests were too vague or overly broad. The judge denied the plaintiff's motion, finding that the defendants' responses were sufficient and that the plaintiff's requests were not properly tailored to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. The judge also found that the phrasing of one request was problematic and that the language was vague and overly broad. The defendants are ordered to provide notice of the court's ruling within five calendar days.
