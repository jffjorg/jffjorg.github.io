And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the petition to compel compliance with the subpoena duces tecum and ordered Aref Bhuiya, M.D. to produce the medical records of patients 1-5 for the date ranges specified in the investigational subpoenas. The judge found that the State Medical Board and Department of Consumer Affairs has good cause to issue the subpoenas and that the patients' privacy rights are outweighed by the state's legitimate interest in ensuring that the public receives medical care that conforms with the standard of care. The judge also rejected Bhuiya's argument that the patients must be joined in the case, finding that the patients were provided with adequate notice and opportunity to object to the subpoena.
