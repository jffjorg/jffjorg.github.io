Here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motions to transfer venue and compel depositions brought by the Defendant, American Honda Motor Co. The Defendant seeks to transfer the case to Yuba County and to compel depositions of the Plaintiffs, Michelle and Anthony Bernardino.

The Judge has denied the Defendant's motion to transfer venue, finding that the Defendant waived its right to challenge venue by not bringing the motion in a timely manner. The Judge has also granted the Defendant's motion to compel depositions of the Plaintiffs, ordering them to sit for deposition on or before October 31, 2024.

The Judge has conditioned its ruling on the payment of $60 in filing fees by the Defendant within 10 days of the order. The Judge has also noted that the Defendant improperly combined multiple motions into one filing, which is not allowed under the court's rules.

The Judge has given notice to all parties to submit on the tentative ruling by contacting the courtroom via email by 4:00 p.m. the day before the hearing.
