And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, Renee Lotenero and Steve Siegrist, and against the defendant, BMW of North America, LLC, in a motion to tax costs. The plaintiffs sought to recover costs from the defendant, who had previously offered to settle the case for $45,000 but did not accept the offer. The court found that the defendant was entitled to recover costs of $448.59, but taxed $3,095.30 of the defendant's costs, including travel and meal expenses, as not reasonably necessary to the litigation. The court noted that the defendant had not shown that it was reasonably necessary to have counsel from the San Francisco office of Lewis Brisbois cover the trial, and that the travel expenses were not compensable under California law.
