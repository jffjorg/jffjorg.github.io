STATEMENT
OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
            This is a lemon law action filed on April 12, 2022. Plaintiffs signed a
Retail Installment Sales Contract to buy a 2017 BMW i3 which had electrical
system defects. Plaintiffs sued the manufacturer, BMW of North America, LLC,
for breach of warranty under the Song Beverly Act. A jury verdict was rendered
on July 3, 2024 in favor of Plaintiffs and against Defendant. 
 
Plaintiffs move to tax costs in the
memorandum of costs filed by Defendant. 
            
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Plaintiffs’
Motion to Tax Costs is GRANTED. Item 16 of Defendant’s Memorandum of Costs is
taxed in the amount of $3,095.30.  Defendant is, therefore, entitled to recover
costs of $448.59.
 
DISCUSSION:
 
Plaintiffs
move to tax costs in the memorandum of costs filed by Defendant.

Legal Standard 
 
In general, the “prevailing party” is entitled as a matter
of right to recover costs for suit in any action or proceeding. (Code Civ.
Proc. §1032(b); Santisas v. Goodin (1998) 17 Cal.4th 599, 606; Scott Co.
Of Calif. v. Blount, Inc. (1999) 20 Cal.4th 1103, 1108.)  “Prevailing
party” includes a defendant as against those plaintiffs who do not recovery any
relief against that defendant.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 1032(a)(4).) Assuming the
“prevailing party” requirements are met, the trial court has no discretion to order
each party to bear his or her own costs of suit.  (Michell v. Olick
(1996) 49 Cal.App.4th 1194, 1198; Nelson v. Anderson (1999) 72
Cal.App.4th 111, 129.) 
 
Defendant’s claim for costs is
grounded in an offer to Plaintiffs to compromise for $45,000 pursuant to Code
of Civil Procedure section 998. Plaintiffs did not accept that offer, and
subsequently secured less than the value of that offer after a jury trial. Section
998(b) of the Code of Civil Procedure states, in relevant part:
 
(b) Not less than 10 days prior to
commencement of trial or arbitration (as provided in Section 1281 or 1295) of a
dispute to be resolved by arbitration, any party may serve an offer in writing
upon any other party to the action to allow judgment to be taken or an award to
be entered in accordance with the terms and conditions stated at that time. The
written offer shall include a statement of the offer, containing the terms and
conditions of the judgment or award, and a provision that allows the accepting party
to indicate acceptance of the offer by signing a statement that the offer is
accepted. Any acceptance of the offer, whether made on the document containing
the offer or on a separate document of acceptance, shall be in writing and
shall be signed by counsel for the accepting party or, if not represented by
counsel, by the accepting party.
 
(Code Civ. Proc. § 998(b).) If an
offer made by a defendant is not accepted and the plaintiff does not obtain a
more favorable judgment or award, the defendant is entitled to recover costs
from the time of the offer and may seek post-offer costs for expert witnesses
who are not regular employees of any party, provided those costs were actually
incurred and reasonably necessary to the trial. (Code Civ. Proc. § 998(c)(1).)
 
Allowable costs under Section 1033.5 must be reasonably
necessary to the conduct of the litigation, rather than merely convenient or
beneficial to its preparation, and must be reasonable in amount.  An item
not specifically allowable under Section 1033.5(a) nor prohibited under
subdivision (b) may nevertheless be recoverable in the discretion of the court
if they meet the above requirements (i.e., reasonably necessary and reasonable
in amount).  If the items appearing in a cost bill appear to be proper
charges, the burden is on the party seeking to tax costs to show that they were
not reasonable or necessary. (Ladas v. California State Automotive Assoc.
(1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 761, 773-774.)  On the other hand, if the items are
properly objected to, they are put in issue and the burden of proof is on the
party claiming them as costs.  (Ibid.) Whether a cost item was
reasonably necessary to the litigation presents a question of fact for the
trial court and its decision is reviewed for abuse of discretion.  (Ibid.) 
However, because the right to costs is governed strictly by statute, a court
has no discretion to award costs not statutorily authorized.  (Id.) 
Discretion is abused only when, in its exercise, the court “exceeds the bounds
of reason, all of the circumstances being considered.”  (Ibid.)   
 
Timeliness of Motion
 
“Any notice of motion to strike or to tax costs must be
served and filed 15 days after service of the cost memorandum. If the cost
memorandum was served by mail or email, the period is extended as provided in
Code of Civil Procedure section 1013.”  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1700(b)(1).) Here,
Defendant served the memorandum of costs by electronic service on August 9,
2024. (Memorandum of Costs POS.) This motion was filed and served on August 28,
2024. Accounting for the manner of service, the motion is timely brought. 
 
Analysis
 
Plaintiffs challenge portions of Defendant’s request for
“other” costs listed in Item 16 of Defendant’s Memorandum of Costs.
Specifically, Plaintiffs contend that Defendant’s requests for $786 in
transcript costs and $2,309.30 in travel & meal expenses are improper.
Defendant, in opposition, concedes that the request for trial transcript costs
is inappropriate, but disputes the challenge to travel and meal expenses.
 
Plaintiffs contend that Defendant’s request for $2,309.30
in travel and meal expenses is an improper cost not reasonably necessary to the
costs of litigation. Although travel expenses to attend depositions are
expressly authorized under Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5(a)(3)(C),
other travel expenses do not enjoy such esteem. Moreover, courts have found
that routine expenses for local travel are not reasonably necessary to
the conduct of the litigation, and therefore are not recoverable under section
1033.5(c). (See Ladas v. Cal State Auto Assn. (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 761,
775-76.) Plaintiffs assert that it was Defendant’s choice to use counsel from
San Francisco, rather than local counsel, and thus have not shown the travel
costs to be reasonably necessary to the litigation.  Defendant’s support for securing these
out-of-town travel expenses is not persuasive. 
Its reliance on Chaaban v. Wet Seal, Inc. (2012) 203 Cal.App.4th
49, 59-60, does not support recovery of expenses for trial counsel’s travel
from out of town to attend trial, because the expenditures reimbursed in that
case covered travel expenses for depositions outside the forum and, thus, were
compensable under Section 1033.5.  The
other authorities cited are rulings by federal courts based on federal cost
recovery standards and, thus, do not govern costs bills submitted in state
court.  Under California law, Defendant
is required to demonstrate that it was reasonably necessary to have counsel
from the San Francisco office of Lewis Brisbois cover the trial, even though
the firm has a large Los Angeles office with multiple attorneys who could have
defended at trial.  Defendant has offered
no evidence or argument that would allow the Court to find that such a standard
has been satisfied.  Thus, the Court
finds this cost item should be taxed. 
 
The Court therefore finds that Item 16 of the Memorandum of
Costs should be taxed in the amount of $3,095.30, based on the Parties’
agreement that the request for trial transcript costs is improper and
Defendant’s failure to show that trial counsel’s travel expenses were
reasonably necessary.   
 
CONCLUSION: 
 
            Accordingly,
Plaintiffs’ Motion to Tax Costs is GRANTED. Item 16 of
Defendant’s Memorandum of Costs is taxed in the amount of $3,095.30.  Defendant
is, therefore, entitled to recover costs of $448.59.
 
            Moving
Parties to give notice.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.

conduct a hearing if any party appears. By submitting on the tentative you
have, in essence, waived your right to be present at the hearing, and you
should be aware that the court may not adopt the tentative, and may issue an
order which modifies the tentative ruling in whole or in part.
