As for the summary in English text:

Judge Theresa M. Traber's tentative ruling is a response to a motion for trial preference filed by Plaintiffs Martin Melendez-Murillo and Rufina Barajas. The motion is opposed by 24 defendants, who raise concerns about discovery and motion proceedings. The Plaintiffs seek trial preference under Code of Civil Procedure section 36(d) and (e), citing medical documentation that concludes that Mr. Melendez-Murillo's condition raises substantial medical doubt of survival beyond six months. The Court finds that the medical documentation presented is insufficient to meet the "clear and convincing" standard for trial preference. The Court orders the Plaintiffs to provide the medical documentation referenced in the supporting declaration and directs the Parties to meet and confer regarding joint stipulations governing discovery and pre-trial motion proceedings. The motion is continued to October 30, 2024.
