**Case Summary:**

The court issued a tentative ruling on Crossroads Equipment Lease and Finance, LLC's motion for summary adjudication. The motion was filed on March 7, 2024, seeking summary adjudication of two causes of action: breach of written agreement and breach of guaranty.

**First Cause of Action: Breach of Written Agreement**

The court denied the motion as to this cause of action because DDL Trucking Inc., the defendant, has not yet appeared in the action and is currently in default. The court noted that the entry of default terminates a defendant's rights to take any further affirmative steps in the litigation.

**Second Cause of Action: Breach of Guaranty**

The court granted the motion as to this cause of action. The court found that Crossroads Equipment Lease and Finance, LLC has met its burden of showing that there are no triable issues of material fact as to the breach of guaranty. Lan, the guarantor, did not oppose the motion and failed to establish the existence of a triable issue of material fact or a defense to this cause of action.

**Conclusion**

The court denied the motion for summary adjudication as to the First Cause of Action and granted the motion as to the Second Cause of Action.
