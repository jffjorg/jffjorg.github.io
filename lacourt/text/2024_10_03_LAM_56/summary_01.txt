And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to amend the First Amended Complaint, which was filed on August 20, 2024. The plaintiff seeks to add new facts, legal theories, and eleven additional causes of action to the complaint. The judge finds that it is now too late for the plaintiff to move to amend the complaint, as the trial is set for November 5, 2024, and the proposed amendments would likely prejudice the defendants due to additional discovery that the amendments would entail. The judge notes that the plaintiff's delay in presenting the motion may be a good reason for denial, and that allowing the amendments would only delay the trial further. The judge also points out that the action must be brought to trial within five years after it is filed, and that almost five years have passed since the case was filed in December 2019.
