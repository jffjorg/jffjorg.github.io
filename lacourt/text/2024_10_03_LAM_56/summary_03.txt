And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to continue the trial date and all related dates. The trial, previously scheduled for December 9, 2024, is now continued to March 9, 2026, and the final status conference is continued to February 23, 2026. The court's ruling is based on California Rules of Court rule 3.1332(c), which provides that continuances are disfavored but may be granted on an affirmative showing of good cause. The court finds that the defense counsel's 18-month suspension is a good cause for the continuance, as it has rendered the case unready for trial. The court has also continued all pre-trial deadlines and briefing schedules accordingly.
