And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has considered the demurrer to Defendant's Cross-Complaint and has ruled that some of the causes of action are sufficient, while others are defective. The Court finds that Defendant has sufficiently alleged the elements of a breach of contract, but that the Cross-Complaint fails to state the duty of care and a breach of duty, which are essential elements of a negligence cause of action. The Court sustains the demurrer to the fourth cause of action for intentional misrepresentation without leave to amend. The Court also sustains the demurrer to the fifth cause of action for unjust enrichment, the sixth cause of action for violation of Business and Professions Code section 17200, and the eighth cause of action for injunctive relief. The Court overrules the demurrer to the first and second causes of action. The moving party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
