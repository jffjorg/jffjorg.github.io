BACKGROUND
             On April 2, 2024, Plaintiff filed the
operative First Amended Complaint asserting the following causes of action: (1)
breach of written contract; (2) breach of implied warranty; (3) for money paid;
(4) open book account; (5) unjust enrichment; (6) negligence; (7) intentional
misrepresentation; (8) false promise; (9) fraudulent suppression  of material fact; (10) disgorgement –
violation of B & P Code §§ 7031, et seq.; (11) unfair competition
and business practices (B & P Code § 17200); (12) declaratory relief; and
(13) action on contractor’s license bond.
 
            On June 10, 2024, Defendant filed a
cross-complaint (“Cross-Complaint”) asserting the following causes of action:

misrepresentation; (5) unjust enrichment; (6) violation of Business and
Professions Code section 17200 et seq.; (7) retaliation; and (8)
injunctive relief.
 
            On July 2, 2024, Plaintiff filed the
instant demurrer to Defendant’s Cross-Complaint (“Demurrer”).  Defendant filed a late opposition on October
1, 2024.  The Court, in its discretion,
will consider the late-filed opposition.

DISCUSSION
Legal Standard
“The primary function of a pleading is to give the
other party notice so that it may prepare its case [citation], and a defect in
a pleading that otherwise properly notifies a party cannot be said to affect
substantial rights.”  (Harris v. City
of Santa Monica (2013) 56 Cal.4th 203, 240.)  “A demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of
the factual allegations in a complaint.” (Ivanoff v. Bank of America, N.A. (2017)
9 Cal.App.5th 719, 725.)  The Court looks
to whether “the complaint alleges facts sufficient to state a cause of action
or discloses a complete defense.” (Id.) 
The Court does not “read passages from a complaint in isolation; in
reviewing a ruling on a
demurrer, we read the complaint ‘as a whole and its
parts in their context.’ [Citation.]” (West v.
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (2013) 214 Cal.App.4th 780, 804.)  The Court “assume[s] the truth
of the properly pleaded factual allegations, facts
that reasonably can be inferred from those
expressly pleaded and matters of which judicial notice
has been taken.” (Harris, supra, 56 Cal.4th p. 240.) “The
court does not, however, assume the truth of contentions, deductions or
conclusions of law. [Citation.]” (Durell v. Sharp
Healthcare (2010) 183 Cal.App.4th 1350,
1358.)
 
            As a general matter, in a demurrer
proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via
proper judicial notice.  (Donabedian
v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.)  “The only issue a demurrer is concerned with
is whether the complaint, as it stands, states a cause of action.  (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th
740, 747.)
 
Leave
to amend must be allowed where there is a reasonable possibility of successful
amendment.  (Goodman v. Kennedy
(1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 349 (court shall not “sustain a demurrer without leave to
amend if there is any reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by
amendment”); Kong v. City of Hawaiian Gardens Redevelopment Agency (2002)
108 Cal.App.4th 1028, 1037 (“A demurrer should not be sustained without leave
to amend if the complaint, liberally construed, can state a cause of action
under any theory or if there is a reasonable possibility the defect can be
cured by amendment.”).)  The burden is on
the complainant to show the Court that a pleading can be amended
successfully.  (Blank v. Kirwan
(1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.)
 
Defendant’s
Business Name
As
a preliminary matter, the Court addresses the issue of ambiguity in Defendant’s
business name.  Plaintiff asserts that
Defendant cannot maintain this action under the entity names under which
Defendant is suing, and requests judicial notice of printouts of the Secretary
of State and CSLB websites to support his assertions.  In the Cross-Complaint, Defendant attached a
screenshot purportedly showing that it holds a valid and active license status.
 It is therefore evident that Defendant’s
business name is in dispute.
 
A
demurrer, however, is not the appropriate procedure for determining the truth
of disputed facts, including disputes regarding the name of an entity or
business name.  Although the existence
of a document may be judicially noticeable, the truth of statements contained
in the document and its proper interpretation are not subject to judicial
notice if those matters are reasonably disputable. (StorMedia, Inc. v.
Superior Court (1999) 20 Cal.4th 449, 457, fn. 9.)  StorMedia stated: “In ruling on a
demurrer, a court may consider facts of which it has taken judicial notice.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.30, subd. (a).)  This includes the existence of a document.  When judicial notice is taken of a document,
however, the truthfulness and proper interpretation of the document are
disputable.  (Joslin v. H.A.S. Ins.
Brokerage (1986) 184 Cal.App.3d 369, 374.) 

 
Joslin
stated:
“Taking judicial notice of a document is not the same as accepting the truth of
its contents or accepting a particular interpretation of its meaning. (See Middlebrook–Anderson
Co. v. Southwest Sav. & Loan Assn. (1971) 18 Cal.App.3d 1023, 1038 [96
Cal.Rptr. 338].) On a demurrer a court's function is limited to testing the
legal sufficiency of the complaint. (Marina Tenants Assn. v. Deauville
Marina Development Co. (1986) 181 Cal.App.3d 122, 127 [226 Cal.Rptr. 321].)
‘A demurrer is simply not the appropriate procedure for determining the truth
of disputed facts.’ (Ramsden v. Western Union (1977) 71 Cal.App.3d 873,
879 [138 Cal.Rptr. 426].) The hearing on demurrer may not be turned into a
contested evidentiary hearing through the guise of having the court take
judicial notice of documents whose truthfulness or proper interpretation are disputable.
(See Del E. Webb Corp. v. Structural Materials Co. (1981) 123 Cal.App.3d
593, 605 [176 Cal.Rptr. 824].)” Joslin, supra, at page 375, 228
Cal.Rptr. 878 stated further, “ ‘judicial notice of matters upon demurrer will
be dispositive only in those instances where there is not or cannot be a
factual dispute concerning that which is sought to be judicially noticed.’ (Cruz
v. County of Los Angeles (1985) 173 Cal.App.3d 1131, 1134 [219
Cal.Rptr. 661].)”
 
Thus,
Plaintiff’s assertions regarding any ambiguity in Defendant’s entity or business
name can be more properly addressed through discovery, and is not properly the subject
of this demurrer.
 
First Cause of
Action: Breach of Contract
“The
standard elements of a claim for breach of contract are: ‘(1) the contract, (2)
plaintiff’s performance or excuse for nonperformance, (3) defendant’s breach,
and (4) damage to plaintiff therefrom.’”  (Wall Street Network, Ltd. v. New York
Times Co.¿(2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 1171, 1178.)¿ 
 
The
Cross-Complaint alleges that Plaintiff and Defendant “entered into a written/oral
construction contract (hereinafter “the Contract”), wherein [Defendant] agreed
to perform certain construction work, and [Plaintiff] agreed to pay for said construction
work” (Cross-Complaint, ¶ 9), that “[t]he total agreed-upon cost for the
construction work under the Contract was $175,000.00” (Id., ¶ 10), that
“[Defendant] performed all conditions, covenants, and promises required on
their part” (Id., ¶ 11), and that “[Plaintiff] breached the Contract by
failing to pay the full amount owed for the construction work.  Specifically, [Plaintiff] has only paid
$117,155.00 and has failed and refused to pay the remaining balance, of
$57,845, and there is now due, owing, and unpaid the sum of $73,317.30” (Id.,
¶ 12).  The Cross-Complaint further
alleges that “As a result of [Plaintiff’s] breach, [Defendant] has suffered
damages in an amount to be proven at trial, but not less than $73,317.30.”  (Id., ¶ 24.)
 
Here,
the Court finds that Defendant has sufficiently alleged the elements of a
breach of contract.  Complainants
alleging breach of contract are not required to attach the contract, or to
plead terms verbatim.  (Miles v.
Deutsche Bank Nat’l Trust Co. (2015) 236 Cal.App.4th 394, 402.)  
 
Accordingly,
the demurrer as to the first cause of action is OVERRULED.
 
Second Cause of
Action: Open Book Account
“The
elements of an open book account cause of action are: 1. That plaintiff and
defendant had financial transactions ... ; 2. That plaintiff ... kept an
account of the debits and credits involved in the transactions; 3. That
defendant owes plaintiff money on the account; and 4. The amount of money that
defendant owes plaintiff.”  (State
Comp. Ins. Fund v. ReadyLink Healthcare, Inc. (2020) 50 Cal. App. 5th 422,
449 [internal brackets, quotation marks, and paragraph references omitted].)
 
Plaintiff
demurs to this cause of action, arguing that a cause of action for an open book
account is a common count theory of recovery, and that a quantum meruit
recovery is inconsistent with recovery for breach of written contract.  Plaintiff asserts that quantum meruit
recovery that is contrary to an express contractual term is not allowed.  
 
A
pleading, however, may properly set forth alternative theories in varied and
inconsistent counts.  (Rader Co. v.
Stone (1986) 178 Cal. App. 3d 10, 15, 223.) 
Thus, a party is not precluded by law from alleging in one cause of
action the breach of a contract and an inconsistent theory of recovery in
another cause of action.  (Id.)
 
Here,
Defendant has sufficiently alleged the above elements of an open book account
cause of action.  (Cross-Complaint, ¶¶
27-29.)  The demurrer as to the second
cause of action is, therefore, OVERRULED.
 
Third Cause of
Action: Negligence
“In
order to state a cause of action for negligence, the complaint must allege
facts sufficient to show a legal duty on the part of the defendant to use due
care, a breach of such legal duty, and the breach as the proximate or legal
cause of the resulting injury.”  (Bellah
v. Greenson (1978) 81 Cal.App.3d 614, 619.)
 
Here,
the Cross-Complaint states: “[Plaintiff] owed a duty of care to [Defendant] to [describe
the duty] (Cross-Complaint, ¶ 31), and that “[Plaintiff] breached that duty
by [describe the negligent act]” (Id., ¶ 32) (Emphasis added.)  Clearly thus, the Cross-Complaint fails to
state the duty of care and a breach of duty, which are essential elements of a
negligence cause of action.
 
Thus,
the demurrer as to the third cause of action is SUSTAINED with thirty days
leave to amend.
 
Fourth Cause of
Action: Intentional Misrepresentation
“The elements of a negligent misrepresentation are
‘(1) the misrepresentation of a past or existing material fact, (2) without
reasonable ground for believing it to be true, (3) with intent to induce
another's reliance on the fact misrepresented, (4) justifiable reliance on the
misrepresentation, and (5) resulting damage.’ 
(Borman v. Brown (2021) 59 Cal. App. 5th 1048, 1060.)  
 
Here,
Defendant attempts to state a claim for intentional misrepresentation based on
the allegations that Plaintiff “filed a frivolous complaint and sought an
injunction for the removal of the mechanic’s lien, falsely asserting that [Defendant]
was not a duly licensed contractor in the State of California and that [Defendant]
had breached the Contract.” 
(Cross-Complaint, ¶¶ 35-36.)  
 
California’s
litigation privilege is broad and provides substantial protection against
derivative lawsuits arising from judicial proceedings.  (People v.
Potter Handy, LLP (2023) 97 Cal.App.5th 938.)  Importantly, the privilege covers even
statements that are false, fraudulent, or made with malice.  (Olsen v. Harbison (2010) 191
Cal.App.4th 325; Herterich v. Peltner  (2018) 20 Cal.App.5th 1132). This means that,
generally, intentional misrepresentations made in the course of judicial
proceedings are protected from tort claims, including those for intentional
misrepresentation.
 
Thus
here, even assuming the truth of Defendant’s allegations that Plaintiff made
false statements in filing a complaint and seeking an injunction against
Defendant, a claim for intentional misrepresentation based on those allegations
fails.
 
Accordingly,
the demurrer to the fourth cause of action is SUSTAINED without leave to amend.
 
Fifth Cause of
Action: Unjust Enrichment
The
elements of unjust enrichment are 1) receipt of a benefit, 2) unjust or
wrongful retention of the benefit, and 3) at the expense of another.  (Peterson v. Cellco Partnership (2008)
164 Cal.App.4th 1583, 1593; Lectrodryer v. SeoulBank (2000) 77
Cal.App.4th 723, 726; Marina Tenants Assn. v. Deauville Marina Development
Co. (1986) 181 Cal.App.3d 122, 134; Hirsch v. Bank of Amer. (2003)
107 Cal.App.4th 708, 716, 722.)
 
Here,
the Cross-Complaint alleges: “[Plaintiff] has been unjustly enriched at the
expense of [Defendant] by receiving [describe the benefit] without
providing fair compensation.” 
(Cross-Complaint, ¶ 42.) (Emphasis added.)  The Cross-Complaint evidently fails to state
the benefit received by Plaintiff, and thus does not sufficiently state a cause
of action.
 
Accordingly,
the demurrer to the fifth cause of action is SUSTAINED with thirty days leave
to amend.
 
Sixth Cause of
Action: Violation of Business and Professions Code Section 17200
            The elements for this cause of
action are: 1) a business practice; 2) that is unfair, unlawful or fraudulent;
and 3) authorized remedy.  (Bus. &
Prof. Code, § 17200; Paulus v. Bob Lynch
Ford, Inc. (2006) 139 Cal.App.4th 659, 676; People ex rel. Dept. of Motor Vehicles v. Cars 4 Causes (2006) 139
Cal.App.4th 1006, 1016 (“An ‘unlawful’ practice requires violation of another
statute, and a business practice may be ‘unfair’ even if not otherwise
proscribed by statute as long as the practice is not expressly authorized by
law.”); Bank of the West v. Superior
Court (1992) 2 Cal.4th 1254, 1266 (“The Unfair Business Practices Act
defines ‘unfair competition’ as any ‘unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business
practice and unfair, deceptive, untrue or misleading advertising….’ (§ 17200.)  (Puentes
v. Wells Fargo Home Mortg., Inc. (2008) 160 Cal.App.4th 638, 645 (“‘[A]
breach of contract may ... form the predicate for Section 17200 claims,
provided it also constitutes conduct that is ‘unlawful, or unfair, or
fraudulent.”’”); ibid. (“fraudulent”
in section 17200 does not mean common-law fraud, but only that members of the
public likely would be deceived); ibid.
at pp. 646-649 (apart from practices based upon fraud, the definition of
“unfair” is uncertain, and has been defined in several ways, including harm to
consumers, and threats to competition); Consumer
Advocates v. Echostar Satellite Corp. (2003) 113 Cal.App.4th 1351, 1362 (to
be actionable unfair business practices, representations must be likely to
deceive a reasonable consumer, and not akin to puffing); Cansino v. Bank of Amer. (2014) 224 Cal.App.4th 1462, 1473-1474
(section 17200 claim does not require anticompetitive business practices, but
also encompasses the public's right to protection from unlawful conduct)
 
            Here, the Cross-Complaint merely
alleges in a vague and conclusory manner that Plaintiff’s “conduct as described
above constitutes unlawful, unfair, and/or fraudulent business acts and
practices in violation of California Business and Professions Code Section 17200
et seq.”  Defendant fails to allege any
specific facts showing how Plaintiff performed any unlawful, unfair or
fraudulent business act or practice.  
 
            Thus, the demurrer to the sixth
cause of action is SUSTAINED with thirty days leave to amend.
 
Seventh
Cause of Action: Retaliation
            Under California's Fair Employment
and Housing Act (FEHA), retaliation claims are associated with employment
relationships.  (Jones v. Lodge at Torrey Pines
Partnership (2008) 42 Cal.4th
1158; Light v. Department of Parks &
Recreation (2017) 14
Cal.App.5th 75.)
 FEHA includes provisions against
retaliating against employees for participating in protected activities, and covers
scenarios where an employer might retaliate, including demoting, suspending, or
denying employment benefits to an individual due to their involvement in
protected activities.  Independent
contractors, however, do not generally receive the same protections under FEHA
as employees.  (Garcia v. Border Transportation
Group, LLC (2018) 28
Cal.App.5th 558.)
 
            The Cross-Complaint does not allege
an employment relationship.  Rather,
Defendant alleges having entered into a construction contract with Plaintiff
where Defendant agreed to perform construction work for Plaintiff for pay.  (Cross-Complaint ¶ 9.)
 
            Hence, Defendant’s retaliation claim
fails and the demurrer is SUSTAINED without leave to amend.  
 
Eight
Cause of Action: Injunctive Relief
            “Injunctive relief is a remedy not a
cause of action. [Citations.]  A cause of action must exist before a court
may grant a request for injunctive relief.”  (Allen v. City of
Sacramento (2015) 234 Cal.App.4th 41, 65; accord, City of South
Pasadena v. Department of Transportation (1994) 29 Cal.App.4th 1280, 1293
(“A permanent injunction is merely a remedy for a proven cause of action. It
may not be issued if the underlying cause of action is not established.”’); Roberts
v. Los Angeles County Bar Assn. (2003) 105 Cal.App4th 604, 618; McDowell
v. Watson (1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 1155,1159.)
 
            Therefore, the Court SUSTAINS the
demurrer to the sixth cause of action for injunctive relief without leave to
amend.   
 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
