MOVING PARTIES: Attorneys
Sean Benjamin Solis (“Solis”) and T. Markus Funk (“Funk”)
 
BACKGROUND
             On August 7, 2024, Plaintiffs filed their
complaint asserting the following causes of action: (1) declaratory relief; (2)
breach of duty of care; (3)           breach
of duty of loyalty; (4) aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty; (5) unjust
enrichment; (6) fraud; (7) breach of contract; (8) breach of covenant of good
faith and fair dealing; (9) fraudulent transfer; (10) usury; (11) accounting;
and (12) constructive trust.  
 
On
August 22, 2024, attorneys Solis and Funk filed their respective applications
(the “Applications”) to be admitted pro hac vice to represent Defendants
Berlekamp Family Investments LLC, David Berlekamp, Persis Berlekamp and Bronwen
O’Wril in this action.  
 
The
Court has considered the Applications.  No opposition papers were
filed.  Any opposition papers were required to have been filed and served
at least nine court days prior to the hearing under California Code of Civil
Procedure section 1005, subdivision (b).
 
DISCUSSION
             California Rules of Court (“CRC”)
rule 9.40 provides that an attorney in good standing in another jurisdiction
may apply to appear pro hac vice in this State by way of written
application upon due notice to all interested parties, as well as service on
the State Bar in San Francisco with payment of a $50 fee, provided that the
attorney (a) is not a California resident, (b) does not work in California, and
(c) does not perform regular or substantial business, professional or other
activities in California. 
 
An
application for pro hac vice admission must set forth: (1) the applicant
attorney’s residence and office addresses; (2) the courts to which the
applicant attorney has been admitted and dates of admission; (3) a
representation that the attorney applicant is a member in good standing in the
courts of admission and is not currently suspended or disbarred in any court;
(4) the title of each court and action in which the applicant attorney has
appeared pro hac vice in this State in the prior two years; and (5) the
name, address and phone number of the active California State Bar member with
whom the applicant is associated.  (CRC, rule
9.40(d).)
 
The
Court finds that Solis and Funk each have established that they satisfied the
requirements to appear as counsel pro hac vice pursuant to CRC, rule
9.40.
 
The
Court, therefore, GRANTS the Applications, and each of them.
 
Moving
parties are ordered to give notice of this ruling.       
 
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org
as directed by the instructions provided on the court website at
www.lacourt.org.  If the department does
not receive an email and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion
will be placed off calendar.
 
Dated this 3rd day of October 2024
