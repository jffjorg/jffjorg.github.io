MOVING PARTY: Plaintiff
JOSE JUAREZ (“Plaintiff”)
 
RESPONDING PARTY: None
            
The
Court has considered the moving papers. 
No opposition has been filed.  Any
opposition was required to have been filed and served at least nine court days
prior to the hearing.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 1005, subd. (b).)
 
BACKGROUND
On
November 15, 2022, Plaintiff filed a complaint alleging 22 causes of action
arising out of an employment relationship.  On December 12, 2022, Defendants Gregorio
Juarez, Uriel Juarez and Grejur Co LLC (collectively, “Defendants”) filed a
cross-complaint alleging(1) battery; and (2) intentional infliction of
emotional distress.
             
Plaintiff
now moves this Court for an order continuing trial for the reason that defense counsel
has been suspended from the practice of law for a period of 18 months,
apparently to end in August 2025.  (Motion,
p. 2)  There has been no substitution of
attorney for Defendants, and Plaintiff is unable to proceed with discovery and
trial.  (Id.)
 
DISCUSSION
California Rules of Court (“CRC”) rule 3.1332(c)
provides that, although continuances are “disfavored,” each request must be
considered on its own merits, and the court may grant a continuance on an
affirmative showing of good cause requiring the continuance.  That subsection also includes a non-exhaustive
list of possible grounds for a continuance.
 
The Court finds good cause for a trial continuance,
specifically due to “unavailability of counsel”, resulting in an “unanticipated
change in the status of the case as a result of which the case is not ready for
trial.”  (CRC rule 3.1332(c)(3) and (7).)
 
RULING
 Accordingly, Plaintiff’s Motion
to Continue Trial Date and All Related Dates is GRANTED.
 
Trial
in this matter, currently scheduled for December 9, 2024, is continued to March
9, 2026.  The Final Status Conference,
currently scheduled for November 26, 2024, is continued to February 23, 2026.  All pre-trial deadlines and briefing schedules
are continued in accordance with the new dates.
 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.            
 
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at
SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed by the instructions provided on the court
website at www.lacourt.org.  If the
department does not receive an email and there are no appearances at the
hearing, the motion will be placed off calendar.
 
Dated this 3rd day of October 2024
