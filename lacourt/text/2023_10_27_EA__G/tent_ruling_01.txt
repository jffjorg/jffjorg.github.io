BACKGROUND
This
is a personal injury action arising from an automobile collision. In July 2021,
Plaintiff Jaye Ann Aquino was involved in an automobile collision with
Defendant Carlos Ledezma at the intersection of East Amar Road and Witzman
Drive in West Covina.
On November
9, 2022, Aquino filed a complaint against Ledezma and Does 1-10, alleging a
cause of action for motor vehicle negligence. On April 26, Aquino’s process
server personally served Ledezma in La Puente.
On August
3, 2023, default was entered against Ledezma. On October 20, Aquino submitted
the present application for default judgment.
An
OSC Re: Default/Default Judgment is set for October 27, 2023.
LEGAL STANDARD
Code
of Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a
party has filed to timely respond or appear.  A party seeking judgment on
the default by the court must file a Request for Court Judgment, and: (1) a
brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other admissible evidence in
support of the judgment requested; (3) interest computations as necessary; (4)
a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) a proposed form of judgment; (6) a
dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application
for separate judgment under CCP § 579, supported by a showing of grounds for
each judgment; (7) exhibits as necessary; and (8) a request for attorneys’ fees
if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.  (Cal. Rules of
Court 3.1800.)
ANALYSIS
Aquino
seeks default judgment against Ledezma in the total amount of $15,988.28,
including $15,068 in damages and $920.28 in costs. Because the court finds Aquino
has submitted sufficient evidence, the court GRANTS Aquino’s application
for default judgment. 
CONCLUSION 
Based
on the foregoing, Aquino’s application for default judgment is TENTATIVELY
GRANTED and the court will enter default judgment for Aquino in the amount
of $15,988.28 upon Aquino’s
dismissal of the Doe Defendants in this action pursuant to Rule 3.1800,
subdivision (a)(7) of the California Rules of Court.
