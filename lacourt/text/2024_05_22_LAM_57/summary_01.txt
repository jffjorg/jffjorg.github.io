```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that Jacob's demurrer to Zvi's Fifth Cause of Action for breach of fiduciary duty and Sixth Cause of Action for constructive fraud is overruled. The judge finds that the allegations in the TAC sufficiently allege that Jacob breached his common law fiduciary duty to Zvi in multiple ways. The judge also finds that the allegations in the TAC satisfy the elements of the existence of a duty and breach of that duty, and that the claim for constructive fraud is adequately alleged.

Regarding the disputes, the judge denies Jacob and Naomi's motion to strike the naming of "Doe Defendants" as respondents in the Fifth and Sixth Causes of Action in the TAC. The judge also denies Jacob and Naomi's request for monetary sanctions.

Regarding the discovery motions, the judge grants Zvi's motion to compel Naomi to provide further responses to requests for admission and form and special interrogatories, and grants Zvi's motion to compel Jacob to provide further responses to requests for admission and form and special interrogatories. The judge denies Zvi's request for monetary sanctions.

The judge's ruling is subject to change at the hearing on May 22, 2024.
