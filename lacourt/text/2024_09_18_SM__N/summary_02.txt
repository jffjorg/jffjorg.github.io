```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendant's demurrer to the plaintiff's complaint. The defendant's demurrer to the first cause of action (negligence) is sustained with 30 days' leave to amend, as the plaintiff's claim is currently deficient. The defendant's demurrer to the second cause of action (statutory liability for failure to provide a safe place of employment) is sustained without leave to amend, as the claim is duplicative of the negligence claim and lacks a basis in law. The judge has granted the defendant's request for judicial notice of the plaintiff's complaint. The plaintiff is allowed to amend his complaint only as authorized by the court's order and may not amend the complaint to add a new party or cause of action without having obtained permission to do so.
