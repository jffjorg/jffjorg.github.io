And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled on the demurrers filed by defendants Brian J. Nissel and Dahlia Nissel to the complaint filed by plaintiffs Daniel Lavaee and Roxanna Lavaee. The judge has sustained the demurrers, meaning that the complaint does not adequately state a cause of action against the defendants. The judge has given the plaintiffs 30 days to amend their complaint to address the defects identified in the demurrer. The judge has also denied the defendants' motions to strike portions of the complaint as moot, since the demurrer has already addressed the issues raised by the motion. The judge has ruled that the complaint does not provide sufficient notice of the claims against the defendants and that the defendants are not properly identified in the pleading. The judge has cited various California court decisions in support of the ruling, including Harris v. Wachovia Mortgage, FSB and Lewis v. Safeway, Inc.
