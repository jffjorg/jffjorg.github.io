And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling denies the Plaintiff's motion to withdraw an admission made in response to a request for admission. The Plaintiff, appearing pro per, argues that the admission was the result of her former attorney's incompetence or deliberate refusal to cooperate. The Judge finds that the Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect, as required by CCP § 2033.230. The Judge notes that the Plaintiff's allegations of incompetence or deliberate refusal to cooperate do not constitute a mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. The Judge's ruling is based on the legal standard set forth in CCP § 2033.300, which requires the court to resolve doubts in favor of the party seeking relief. The Judge encourages the parties to submit on this tentative ruling by email or appear remotely or in person for oral argument.
