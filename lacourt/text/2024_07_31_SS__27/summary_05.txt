Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to quash a subpoena served on Plaintiff's insurance company. The subpoena requested disclosure of information relating to the subject incident, including medical information and information protected by attorney-client privilege. The court held that the right to privacy of the Plaintiff outweighs the need for the disclosure, and therefore granted the motion to quash the subpoena in part. The court allowed disclosure of the Plaintiff's insurance file relating to the subject incident only, and limited disclosure of medical information to those alleged by the Plaintiff. The court also required a privilege log for information protected by attorney-client privilege that is withheld. The court will allow the parties to submit written arguments on the tentative ruling, and will hold an oral argument on July 31, 2024.
