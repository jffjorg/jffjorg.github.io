English-text summary:

The tentative ruling addresses the defendant's motions to compel discovery responses from the plaintiff. The defendant served discovery requests on June 27, 2023, and granted an extension to August 30, 2023, for responses. However, the plaintiff did not serve responses until January 19, 2024, without objection. The defendant's request for sanctions is denied because it failed to identify all parties against whom sanctions were sought. The plaintiff acted with substantial justification in serving belated responses. The court grants the defendant's motions to compel and orders the plaintiff to serve responses within 15 days. Additionally, the court notes that the plaintiff filed a substitution of attorney on August 11, 2023, reflecting his pro per status, but has not since filed a new substitution of attorney despite being represented by counsel.
