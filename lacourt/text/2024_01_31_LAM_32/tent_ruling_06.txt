     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
defendant eric samules’ motion to
  reclassify 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On December 22, 2023, Plaintiff
Rescore Hollywood, LLC filed this unlawful detainer action against Defendants
Eric Samules and Sara Samules. The complaint alleges past-due rent in the
amount of $26,675. 
            On January 10, 2024, Defendant Eric
Samules filed the instant motion to reclassify the case from unlimited to limited
jurisdiction. 
LEGAL STANDARD
“A trial court has authority to conduct a
pretrial hearing [a Walker hearing] to obtain information about whether the
amount of the judgment will require reclassification.” (Stern v. Superior
Court (2003) 105 Cal.App.4th 223, 229.) “Under the Walker standard, a
matter may be
reclassified
as a limited civil action ‘when (i) the absence of jurisdiction is apparent
before trial from the complaint, petition, or related documents, or (ii) during
the course of pretrial litigation, it becomes clear that the matter will ‘necessarily’
result in a verdict below the superior court's jurisdictional amount....’” (Ytuarte
v. Superior Court (2005) 129 Cal.App.4th 266, 276.) 
DISCUSSION
            Defendant moves for reclassification
on the grounds that the complaint reveals that damages are necessarily below
the jurisdictional amount. Specifically, the complaint alleges back rent of
$26,675. Defendant argues that this is below the $35,000 threshold imposed by
statute. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 86(a)(1).) 
            Initially, the Court notes that there
is no proof of service of the motion. The motion is denied for lack of proper
service. 
            Additionally, the motion fails on
the merits. At the time the complaint was filed, the prior versions of Code of
Civil Procedure sections 85 and 86 were in effect, and the jurisdictional
minimum was $25,000. The amended Sections 85 and 86, which increased the
minimum to $35,000, did not go into effect until January 1, 2024. In
California, “statutes ordinarily are interpreted as operating prospectively in
the absence of a clear indication of a contrary legislative intent.” (Quarry
v. Doe I (2012) 53 Cal.4th 945, 955.) “[A] statute may be applied
retroactively only if it contains express language of retroactivity or if other
sources provide a clear and unavoidable implication that the Legislature
intended retroactive application.” (Myers v. Philip Morris Companies, Inc.
(2002) 28 Cal.4th 828, 844.) Sections 85 and 86 do not contain any express language
of retroactivity, nor is there any other indication that the provisions were
meant to apply retroactively. 
Because the jurisdictional limit in effect
on December 22, 2023 was $25,000, Plaintiff correctly filed its action in an
unlimited jurisdiction court. The revised Sections 85 and 86 do not apply
retroactively and thus do not transform this action into a limited jurisdiction
case. The action is correctly classified as unlimited. 
CONCLUSION
            Defendant’s motion to reclassify is
DENIED.
