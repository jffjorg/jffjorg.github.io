CURTIS CASH,
                        Plaintiff,
            v.
 
CITY OF LOS ANGELES, 
                        Defendant.
  


 
  Case No.:  23STCV06117
  Hearing Date:  January 31, 2024
 
     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
defendant’s motions to compel responses 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On March 20, 2023, Plaintiff Curtis
Cash filed this action against Defendant City of Los Angeles, asserting a
single cause of action for whistleblower retaliation under Labor Code section
1102.5. 
            On January 5, 2024, Defendant filed
the instant four motions to compel responses to interrogatories and requests
for production. Plaintiff’s counsel filed a response declaration on January 19,
2024.  
LEGAL STANDARD
Discovery responses are due 30 days after
service of the requests, unless the parties stipulate or the court orders
otherwise. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.260(a), 2031.260(a), 2033.250(a).) If a responding
party fails to respond in time, the propounding party may move for an order
compelling the responses or deeming matters admitted. (Id., §§
2030.290(b), 2031.300(b), 2033.280(b).) The responding party also waives its
objections. (Id., §§ 2030.290(a), 2031.300(a), 2033.280(a).)  
DISCUSSION
            Defendant served the subject
discovery on June 27, 2023. (Levine Decl. ¶ 3.) Defendant granted an extension
to August 30, 2023 for responses. (Id., ¶ 4.) Plaintiff’s counsel
subsequently claimed that Defendant failed to serve Form Interrogatories – Employment.
(Ibid.) Defendant believes it properly served that set, but nonetheless
served it again on August 14, 2023. (Ibid.) As of the filing of this
motion, Defendant has not received any responses, despite Plaintiff’s
assurances that responses would be served by October 2023. (Id., ¶ 5.) Plaintiff
served belated responses without objection on January 19, 2024. (Selik Decl. ¶
13.) 
            Defendant’s request for sanctions is
denied because Defendant failed to “identify every person, party, and attorney
against whom the sanction is sought” in the notice of motion. (See Code Civ.
Proc., § 2023.040.) Additionally, Plaintiff acted with substantial justification.
(Selik Decl. ¶¶ 6-12.) 
CONCLUSION
            Defendant’s motions to compel are
GRANTED. Plaintiff shall serve responses to the subject discovery within 15
days. Sanctions are denied.  
            Additionally, the Court notes that
Plaintiff filed a Substitution of Attorney on August 11, 2023, reflecting his pro
per status. Plaintiff has not since filed any other Substitution of
Attorney even though he is currently represented by Evan Selik of McCathern LLP.
Plaintiff shall file a substitution of attorney reflecting Evan Selik as his
current attorney within 10 days of this order.
