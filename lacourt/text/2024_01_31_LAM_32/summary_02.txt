And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer and motion to strike filed by Defendant TURSS. The ruling sustains the demurrer as to the second and third causes of action with leave to amend, and overrules it as to the first cause of action. The motion to strike is granted as to injunctive relief with leave to amend, and denied in all other respects.

The judge found that the complaint adequately pled a violation of the Investigative Consumer Reporting Agencies Act (ICRAA), but failed to state an invasion of privacy. The judge also found that the prayer for declaratory relief was premature and that injunctive relief was not available.

The judge granted the defendant's motion to strike the prayer for injunctive relief, but denied it as to the other prayers for relief. The judge also denied the defendant's motion to strike the prayer for punitive damages, finding that the allegations in the complaint were sufficient to support such a claim.

The ruling is subject to change after considering further arguments and evidence at the hearing scheduled for January 31, 2024.
