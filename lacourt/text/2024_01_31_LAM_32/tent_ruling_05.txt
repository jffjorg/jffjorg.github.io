     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
defendants’ motion to compel arbitration
  




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On October 3, 2023, Plaintiff Chris
Barnes, as executor of the estate of Eltezer Barnes, filed this action against
various Defendants, asserting causes of action for breach of contract, breach
of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, fraud, breach of
implied warranty, violations of the Business and Professions Code, negligence,
and elder abuse. 
            On December 27, 2023, Defendants
Sunlight Financial and Cross River Bank filed the instant motion to compel
arbitration. Plaintiff has not filed an opposition.  
LEGAL STANDARD
The Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) states
that “[a] written provision in any . . . contract evidencing a transaction involving
commerce to settle by arbitration a controversy thereafter arising out of such
contract or transaction . . . shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable,
save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any
contract.” (9 U.S.C. § 2.) The term “involving commerce” is interpreted to mean
simply “affecting commerce” to give the FAA the broadest reach possible, and
does not require a transaction that is actually “within the flow of interstate
commerce.” (See
Allied-Bruce Terminix Co. v. Dobson (1995) 513 U.S. 265, 273-74; Citizens
Bank v. Alafabco, Inc. (2003) 539 U.S. 52, 56.) Moreover, parties may agree
to apply the FAA notwithstanding any effect on interstate commerce. (Victrola
89, LLC v. Jaman Properties 8 LLC (2020) 46 Cal.App.5th 337, 355.) 
“On petition of a party to an arbitration
agreement alleging the existence of a written agreement to arbitrate a controversy
and that a party to the agreement refuses to arbitrate that controversy, the
court shall order the petitioner and the respondent to arbitrate the
controversy if it determines that an agreement to arbitrate the controversy exists….”
(Code Civ. Proc, § 1281.2.) “The party seeking arbitration bears the burden of
proving the existence of an arbitration agreement, and the party opposing arbitration
bears the burden of proving any defense, such as unconscionability.” (Pinnacle
Museum Tower Assn. v. Pinnacle Market Development (US), LLC (2012) 55
Cal.4th 223, 236.)
DISCUSSION
“The moving party ‘can meet its initial
burden by attaching to the motion or petition a copy of the arbitration
agreement purporting to bear the opposing party's signature.’” (Gamboa v.
Northeast Community Clinic (2021) 72 Cal.App.5th 158, 165, quoting Bannister
v. Marinidence Opco, LLC (2021) 64 Cal.App.5th 541, 543-44.) 
On February 22, 2021, Eltezer Barnes
signed a loan agreement with Cross River, acknowledging that she “agree[d] to
the terms of this note, including the additional terms and conditions below and
the attached arbitration provision.” (Carpenter Decl., Ex. A, p. 4.) The
arbitration provision provides that the parties “agree that either party may
elect to require arbitration of any Claim under this Provision.” (Id. at
p. 13.) A “claim” includes “any claim, dispute or controversy between
you and us (or any Related Party) that arises from or relates in any way to
this Note (including any amendment, modification or extension of this Note),
the Contractor Agreement, the work performed by the Contractor or a
subcontractor; the System . . . .” (Ibid.) A “related party” includes Sunlight
Financial. (Ibid.) 
Therefore, the agreement covers the claims
asserted in the complaint and covers both moving Defendants. Plaintiff, operating
as executor of Eltezer Barnes’ estate and suing on claims stemming from the
loan agreement, is equally bound by the arbitration agreement though he is not
a signatory. (See Thomas
v. Westlake
(2012) 204 Cal.App.4th 605, 613; Goldman v. KPMG, LLP (2009) 173 Cal.App.4th
209, 220.)  
The Court finds that Defendants have
proven the existence of an arbitration agreement. The burden thus shifts to
Plaintiff to articulate a defense against enforcement. Plaintiff does not
oppose the motion and therefore concedes that his claims must be arbitrated.
CONCLUSION
            Defendants’ motion to compel
arbitration is GRANTED. The case is stayed in its entirety pending the outcome
of arbitration.
