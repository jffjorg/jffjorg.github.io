And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendant's motion to reclassify the case from unlimited to limited jurisdiction. The defendant, Eric Samules, argued that the complaint alleges damages of $26,675, which is below the $35,000 threshold imposed by statute. However, the judge denied the motion on two grounds: first, the defendant failed to provide proof of service of the motion, and second, the motion fails on the merits. The judge concluded that the jurisdictional limit in effect on December 22, 2023, when the complaint was filed, was $25,000, and therefore the action is correctly classified as unlimited. The judge ruled that the revised Sections 85 and 86 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which increased the jurisdictional minimum to $35,000, do not apply retroactively and do not transform this action into a limited jurisdiction case.
