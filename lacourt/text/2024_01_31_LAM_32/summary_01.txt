And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the defendants' motion to stay proceedings on the representative PAGA claims is granted. The stay was previously ordered pending the California Supreme Court's decision in Adolph v. Uber Technologies, Inc. The Plaintiff, Asia Thompson, attempted to conduct discovery on the representative PAGA claims, which is a violation of the Court's order. The Judge agrees with the defendants that the stay should remain in place to prevent duplicative litigation and inconsistent findings. The arbitrator's findings may have a dispositive effect on the representative PAGA claims, particularly on the issue of Plaintiff's standing as an "aggrieved employee".
