And here is the summary in English text:

This tentative ruling by the judge addresses the motion to compel arbitration filed by the defendants, Sunlight Financial and Cross River Bank, in the lawsuit filed by Chris Barnes, as executor of the estate of Eltezer Barnes, against various defendants, including LA Green Development Inc. The motion was filed in response to the plaintiff's lawsuit, which alleged causes of action including breach of contract, fraud, and negligence.

The judge finds that the defendants have proven the existence of an arbitration agreement signed by Eltezer Barnes, which covers the claims asserted in the complaint. The judge concludes that the plaintiff is equally bound by the arbitration agreement, despite not being a signatory. The burden shifts to the plaintiff to articulate a defense against enforcement, but since the plaintiff has not filed an opposition to the motion, the court grants the motion and stays the case pending the outcome of arbitration.
