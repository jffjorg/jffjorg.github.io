And here is the English text summary:

The tentative ruling of Judge Theresa M. Traber is that the Plaintiff's motion to quash a third-party subpoena for testimony and records is denied. The Plaintiff, Jan Williams, in pro per, moved to quash the subpoena, but failed to provide the court with a copy of the subpoena or its contents. As a result, the court cannot rule on the adequacy or propriety of the subpoena. The Plaintiff bears the burden to demonstrate that the subpoena is improper, but failed to meet this burden. The court therefore denies the Plaintiff's motion to quash the subpoena.
