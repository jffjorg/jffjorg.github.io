And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the plaintiff's motion for appointment of counsel and has denied it without prejudice. The court found that the plaintiff has not provided sufficient evidence to support a finding of exceptional circumstances that would warrant the special appointment of counsel. The court noted that a court's discretionary authority to appoint counsel is not unlimited and that any appointment must be based on exceptional circumstances. The plaintiff's motion was filed on April 16, 2024, but no proof of service of the summons and complaint has been filed. The court also discussed the procedures for the appointment of a Guardian ad Litem under the California Code of Civil Procedure.
