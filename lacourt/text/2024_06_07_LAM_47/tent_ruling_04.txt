MOTION

J.J.
 
RESPONDING PARTY(S): No response on
eCourt as of 6/5/24
 
 
STATEMENT
OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
            This is a child sexual abuse action that was filed on December 29, 2022. Plaintiff
alleges that he was assaulted by adult leaders, members, or volunteers of the
Youth & Family Club of Pomona Valley in 2010. 
 
Attorney James West, Counsel for
Plaintiff John Doe #1, moves to be relieved as counsel. 
            
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Attorney James West, Counsel for
Plaintiff John Doe #1, moves to be relieved as counsel. 
 
Moving Counsel filed all three required forms (MC-051,
-052, and -053) and included a proof of service as required by California Rules
of Court rule 3.1362(d).  Moving Counsel’s
declaration states that the Plaintiff was served by mail at his last known
address, with the address ostensibly confirmed by mail return receipt requested.
(MC-052 ¶ 3.) However, the declaration also states that Moving Counsel has been unable to
locate or contact Plaintiff since February of 2024, and has been unable to
confirm the address is current despite mailing the papers to the last known
address, calling the client’s last known phone numbers, contacting the client’s
family, or searching public records. (MC-052 ¶¶2, 3(b)(2).) 
 
In general, an attorney may withdraw with
or without cause so long as the withdrawal would not result in undue prejudice
to the client’s interest – i.e., counsel cannot withdraw at a critical point in
the litigation, because that would prejudice client, but can withdraw
otherwise. (Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal. App. 4th 904,
915.) The court has discretion to deny an attorney’s request to withdraw where
the withdrawal would work an injustice or cause undue delay in the proceeding,
but the court’s discretion in this area is one to be exercised reasonably. (Mandell
v. Superior Court (1977) 67 Cal.App.3d 1, 4.)   
 
Here, trial in this matter is set
for October 1, 2024. (MC-052 ¶ 6b.) The next hearing in this matter is a
post-mediation status conference scheduled for July 16, 2024 (¶4b.) There is
also a Final Status Conference set for September 16, 2024. The risk of
prejudice is somewhat elevated due to the relative proximity of trial in four
months. However, Moving Counsel seeks to withdraw from representation because
he has been unable to contact the client so as to carry out effective
representation. (MC-052 ¶ 2.) The Court finds the complete absence of the
client is good cause to permit withdrawal, notwithstanding the proximity of the
trial date. 
 
Accordingly, Attorney James West’s
Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel for Plaintiff John Doe #1, J.J. is GRANTED.
 
This ruling is conditioned on
Moving Counsel giving notice of this ruling on all parties and filing proof of
service with the Court. 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.

should be noted that if you submit on a tentative ruling the court will still
conduct a hearing if any party appears. By submitting on the tentative you
have, in essence, waived your right to be present at the hearing, and you
should be aware that the court may not adopt the tentative, and may issue an
order which modifies the tentative ruling in whole or in part.
