TO QUASH THIRD-PARTY SUBPOENA FOR 
TESTIMONY
AND RECORDS

 
MOVING PARTY:               Plaintiff Jan Williams, in pro per.
 
RESPONDING PARTY(S): Defendant County
of Los Angeles, 
 
CASE
HISTORY:
·        
11/01/19: Complaint filed. 
·        
05/11/20: First Amended Complaint filed.
 
STATEMENT
OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
            This is an employment discrimination action. Plaintiff alleges that Defendants
subjected her to multiple adverse employment actions and ultimately terminated
her based on her age and disability. 
 
Plaintiff moves to quash a
deposition subpoena for personal appearance of her physician, Paula
Bailey-Walton, M.D., and for medical records purportedly served on her
physician.
            
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
            Plaintiff moves to quash a
third-party subpoena for records to her physician. 
 
            Code of Civil Procedure section
1987.1 provides:
 
If
a subpoena requires the attendance of a witness or the production of books,
documents, or other things before a court, or at the trial of an issue therein,
or at the taking of a deposition, the court, upon motion reasonably made by any
person described in subdivision (b), or upon the court's own motion after
giving counsel notice and an opportunity to be heard, may make an order
quashing the subpoena entirely, modifying it, or directing compliance with it
upon those terms or conditions as the court shall declare, including protective
orders. In addition, the court may make any other order as may be appropriate
to protect the person from unreasonable or oppressive demands, including
unreasonable violations of the right of privacy of the person.
 
(Code Civ. Proc. § 1987.1(a).) There is no meet and
confer requirement in section 1987.1. There is no requirement for a showing of
good cause for production of documents in connection with a deposition
subpoena. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2020.510(b); Terry v. SLICO (2009) 175
Cal.App.4th 352, 358.)
 
            Here,
however, neither party provides the Court with a copy of the subpoena nor its
contents reproduced verbatim. The Court therefore cannot rule on the adequacy
or propriety of the subpoena because the papers do not establish what is
sought. As moving party, the Plaintiff bears the burden to demonstrate that the
subpoena is improper. By failing to produce the subpoena, Plaintiff has not met
this burden. 
 
            Accordingly,
Plaintiff’s Motions to Quash Third-Party Subpoena is DENIED. 
 
            Moving
Party to give notice.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.

            Any party may submit on the
tentative ruling by contacting the courtroom via email at Smcdept47@lacourt.org by no later than 4:00 p.m. the day
before the hearing. All interested parties must be copied on the email. It
should be noted that if you submit on a tentative ruling the court will still
conduct a hearing if any party appears. By submitting on the tentative you
have, in essence, waived your right to be present at the hearing, and you
should be aware that the court may not adopt the tentative, and may issue an
order which modifies the tentative ruling in whole or in part.
