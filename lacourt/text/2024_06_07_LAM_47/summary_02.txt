And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling denies the defendant's motion to set aside the order compelling discovery responses. The defendant claims that its former counsel failed to communicate with the agent of the defendant, but the court finds multiple issues with the defendant's explanation. The court notes that the defendant did not retain substitute counsel until eight months after losing contact with its original counsel, and did not bring the motion to set aside the order until ten months after the order was entered. The court concludes that the defendant has not demonstrated a satisfactory excuse for not originally defending the motion, and has not shown diligence in seeking to set aside the order.
