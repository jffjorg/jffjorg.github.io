And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award is granted. The arbitrator did not fully address the issue of the cross-complaint, which demanded dissolution of the LLC. However, the Court finds that the arbitrator's failure to conclusively rule on the matter did not prejudice the plaintiff's interests. The arbitrator's award serves to settle the entire controversy, and the plaintiff does not explain how the failure to award relief sought constitutes substantial prejudice to the defendant's rights. The Court is not persuaded that the arbitration award must be vacated on any of the bases asserted by the plaintiff.
