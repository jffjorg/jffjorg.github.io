And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling grants Defendant's Motion to Compel Further Responses to Form Interrogatories in part, ordering Plaintiffs to provide further verified, code-compliant responses without objections as to Interrogatory No. 17.1 Request No. 26. The ruling also denied Defendant's Motion to Compel Further Responses to Requests for Admissions. The Court found that Plaintiffs' responses to the requests for admissions were not evasive because they did not contradict the decedent's prior testimony. The Court also denied Defendant's Request for Sanctions against Plaintiffs. The ruling is conditioned on payment of $60 in filing fees by Defendant within 10 days.
