Legal Authority to Set Aside Order
 
            Defendant
brings this motion under Code of Civil Procedure section 473(b) and the Court’s
inherent equitable authority. Section 473(b) provides: 
 
The court may, upon
any terms as may be just, relieve a party or his or her legal representative
from a judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken against him or her
through his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. Application
for this relief shall be accompanied by a copy of the answer or other pleading
proposed to be filed therein, otherwise the application shall not be granted,
and shall be made within a reasonable time, in no case exceeding six
months, after the judgment, dismissal, order, or proceeding was taken.
 
(Code Civ. Proc. § 473(b)[emphasis added].) The six-month time limit is
jurisdictional. (Pulte Homes Corp. v. Williams Mechanical, Inc.
(2016) 2 Cal.App.5th 267, 273.) Thus, the time to bring this motion to set
aside an order from July 11, 2023 expired on January 8, 2024 under section
473(b). 
 
            That said,
Defendant also brings this motion under the Court’s equitable authority to set
aside prior orders. Although case law discussing this form of relief is primarily
concerned with defaults and default judgments, rather than interlocutory
orders, the Court has the inherent authority to vacate prior orders on equitable
grounds such as extrinsic fraud or mistake. (See Bae v. T.D. Service Co. of
Arizona (2016) 245 Cal.App.4th 89, 97.) There is no time limit as to when a
motion under the Court’s equitable powers may be brought. (See Kramer v.
Traditional Escrow, Inc. (2020) 56 Cal.App.5th 13, 29.) However, the
Court’s ability to grant relief under its inherent power is narrower than its
power under Code of Civil Procedure section 473(b). (Carroll v. Abbot
Laboratories, Inc. (1982) 32 Cal.3d 892, 901, fn.8.) Further, a party
seeking to set aside an order pursuant to the Court’s equity power “must make a
substantially stronger showing of the excusable nature of his or her neglect
than is necessary to obtain relief under ... section 473.” (In re Marriage
of Stevenot (1984) 154 Cal.App.3d 1051, 1074.) As stated by our Supreme
Court, “[w]hen a default judgment has been obtained, equitable relief may be
given only in exceptional circumstances. ‘[W]hen relief under section 473 is
available, there is a strong public policy in favor of granting relief and
allowing the requesting party his or her day in court. Beyond this period there
is a strong public policy in favor of the finality of judgments and only in
exceptional circumstances should relief be granted.’” (Rappleyea v. Cambpell
(1994) 8 Cal.4th 975, 981-82.) 
 
            A party
seeking relief under the Court’s equitable powers must satisfy a “stringent”
three-pronged test: (1) a satisfactory excuse for not presenting a defense; (2)
a meritorious defense; and (3) diligence in seeking to set aside the prior
order. (Rappleyea v. Cambpell (1994) 8 Cal.4th 975, 982-83.)

Analysis
 
            Defendant
moves to set aside the Court’s July 19, 2023 order compelling Defendant to
provide code-compliant responses without objections to Plaintiff’s Form
Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, and Requests for Production, and
deeming Plaintiff’s Requests for Admissions as Admitted. The undisputed facts
giving rise to this motion are that on November 16, 2022, Plaintiff served form
interrogatories, special interrogatories, requests for production, and requests
for admissions on Defendant through its counsel of record via electronic
service. (See July 19, 2023 Minute Order p.3.) Defendant did not respond to any
of the discovery by the statutory deadline of December 20, 2023. (Id.)
Plaintiff thereafter moved to compel responses to the interrogatories and
requests for production and to deem the truth of the requests for admissions,
with a hearing on the motions to compel responses to interrogatories scheduled
for July 12, 2023. (See July 12, 2023 Minute Order.) No opposition to those
motions was ever filed. (Id.) The parties attended an Informal Discovery
Conference on February 21, 2023, at which time, pursuant to an oral
stipulation, Defendant was permitted to serve and file a Motion for Relief from
Waiver of Objections to be heard on July 12, 2023, with the parties to file a
joint statement of remaining discovery issues by June 1, 2023. (February 21,
2023 Minute Order.) No Motion for Relief from Waiver of Objections or Joint
Statement was ever filed. Moreover, at the July 12, 2023 hearing, the office of
Defendant’s then-counsel, Jonathan Dawson, advised the Court that Attorney
Dawson had been in a vehicle accident and was in the emergency room. (July 12,
2023 Minute Order.) The hearing was continued to July 19, 2023, to
coincide with the remaining two motions on requests for production and requests
for admissions. (Id.) On July 19, 2023, there were no appearances for
Defendant and no responses had been provided. (July 19, 2023 Minute Order.) The
Court therefore adopted its tentative, granting all four motions. (Id.) 
 
            Defendant
now brings this motion for relief from that order on the basis that Defendant’s
former counsel, Attorney Jonathan Dawson, failed to communicate with
Defendant’s authorized agent, Jamie Koo. Ms. Koo states that Attorney Dawson
ceased to communicate with her regarding the status of the case after February
16, 2023, though they “did have other discussions about other unrelated
matters” until July 7. (Declaration of Jamie Koo ISO Mot. ¶ 6.) Ms. Koo states
that she never received a copy of the discovery served by Plaintiff until she
received it from her current counsel, and that Attorney Dawson also never
informed Ms. Koo of the then-pending discovery motions. (Koo Decl. ¶¶ 7, 9.)
After July 7, 2023, Ms. Koo states that she was completely unable to contact
Attorney Dawson despite “numerous emails, calls, and texts.” (Id. ¶ 8.) Ms.
Koo states that she retained California Property Law Group to represent her on
March 5, 2024, but does not account for the eight months between losing contact
with Defendant’s counsel and retaining substitute counsel. (Koo Decl. ¶ 11.) 
 
            The Court finds
multiple issues with Defendant’s explanation. First, the contention that
Attorney Dawson never discussed the instant case with the agent of his client draws
considerable skepticism and leads the Court to question whether Defendant has a
satisfactory excuse for not originally defending the motion. Second, as
Plaintiff points out in opposition, Defendant fails to explain the appearance
of Attorney Dawson at the February 2, 2024 hearing, at which the Court
discharged an Order to Show Cause Re: Why Answer Should Not Be Stricken for
Failure to Appear and Order to Show Cause Re: Sanctions for Failure to Appear.
(February 2, 2024 Minute Order.) Third, and most crucially, Defendant totally
neglects to explain why, if it lost contact with its counsel on July 7, 2023,
it did not retain substitute counsel until March 5, 2024 and did not bring this
motion until May 6, 2024, ten months later. Defendant’s declaration thus
demonstrates neither a satisfactory excuse for failing to defend previously nor
diligence in seeking to set aside the order once it was entered under the more
stringent standard for equitable relief. 
 
CONCLUSION:

 
            Accordingly,
Defendant’s Motion to Set Aside Order is DENIED. 
 
            Moving
Party to give notice.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
