The court finds that the risk of prejudice is somewhat elevated due to the relative proximity of trial in four months. However, the court considers the complete absence of the client as good cause to permit withdrawal, despite the proximity of the trial date. The motion is granted conditioned on Moving Counsel giving notice of this ruling on all parties and filing proof of service with the Court.
