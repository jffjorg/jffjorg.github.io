 Case Number:  23STCV30212    Hearing Date:   August 7, 2024    Dept:  55 NATURE OF PROCEEDING: Plaintiff’s Motions to Compel
Responses to Requests for Production, Set One; Special Interrogatories, Set
One; and Requests for Admission, Set One
 
In this Lemon Law case, Plaintiff Faviola Pablo filed
motions to compel discovery responses to her document requests, special interrogatories,
and requests for admission. As set forth in Plaintiff’s motions, Defendant FCA
US, LLC did not serve responses to the discovery requests served on Defendant
on February 2, 2024. Thus, Plaintiff filed her motions to compel such responses
on July 9, 2024.
Defendant’s opposition argues that the motions are moot
because it served responses on July 31, 2024. Defendant’s responses, attached
to the opposition, do not contain a verification and thus are tantamount to no
response at all. Moreover, Defendant’s responses contain objections even though
the responses are untimely, and Defendant has waived its objections. Defendant
contends that its objections are permitted because its untimely responses are
due to mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. But Defendant provides no
attorney declaration explaining the facts regarding  this purported mistake, inadvertence, or excusable
neglect. The Court sees no grounds to conclude Defendant’s utter failure to
respond to the discovery requests is due to any mistake, inadvertence, or excusable
neglect. The bottom line is Defendant waived its objections when it failed to
respond timely. Luckily for Defendant, Plaintiff did not seek any sanctions in
her motions. (Although Defendant inexplicably argued against awarding sanctions
in its opposition.) 
The motions to compel are granted. Defendant shall serve
verified responses, without objections, to all of the discovery requests, by 5
p.m. on 8/16/2024.
