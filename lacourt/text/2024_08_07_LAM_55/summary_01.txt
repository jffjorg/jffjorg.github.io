And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on the demurrers filed by defendants Capital Benefit, Inc., Marcel Bruetsch, and Mural Media. The demurrers were filed in response to the plaintiff's Third Amended Complaint (TAC), which alleges claims of quiet title, fraud, breach of contract, and negligence. The judge has sustained the demurrers to the quiet title claim against Mural Media, the fraud claim against Marcel/Capital Benefit, and the breach of contract claim against Capital Benefit. The judge has also ordered a hearing on the demurrer to the negligence claim against Marcel/Capital Benefit. The judge's ruling is based on the parties' additional briefing and the lodged TAC, and concludes that the plaintiff's claims fail to plead compliance with the tender rule, lack specificity, and do not state a claim.
