Here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The tentative ruling is regarding a motion to compel discovery responses in a Lemon Law case. Plaintiff Faviola Pablo filed motions to compel discovery responses to her document requests, special interrogatories, and requests for admission after Defendant FCA US, LLC failed to serve timely responses. The Defendant argued that the motions are moot because it served responses on July 31, 2024, but the Court found that the responses were untimely and did not contain a verification, thus waiving the objections. The Court granted the motions to compel and ordered the Defendant to serve verified responses, without objections, to all discovery requests by August 16, 2024.
