The Court denies Plaintiff’s default
judgment packet.  
The Court sets a hearing on an order
to show cause why the complaint should not be dismissed and/or Plaintiff’s
counsel sanctioned $250 for failing to enter default judgment (California Rule
of Court, rule 3.110(h)) on December 27, 2024, at 8:30 AM in Department 71 at
Stanley Mosk Courthouse for the following reasons:

1.     Proposed
Judgment is not on JUD-100, and the proposed judgment does not include the fees
requested on the CIV-100 form. Further, the CIV-100 form does not include the
relief requested on the proposed judgment submitted to the court.
 
2.     Plaintiff’s
declaration does not provide exhibits with sufficient foundation to provide
claim of ownership to the property in question.
