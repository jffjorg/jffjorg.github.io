Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has tentatively denied the plaintiff's unopposed motion for an order approving a PAGA Settlement Agreement reached between the plaintiff and the defendant. The settlement agreement was reached after mediation and includes provisions for the release of claims by the plaintiff and representative action members. The court considered objections to certain provisions of the settlement agreement, including a provision that releases the defendant from all liability for PAGA penalties arising from any violation of Labor Code ยง2802. The court modified the settlement agreement by adding a sentence limiting the release of PAGA penalty claims arising from alleged violations of Labor Code ยง2802 to claims based on the facts and theories asserted in the plaintiff's PAGA letter. The motion is denied without prejudice.
