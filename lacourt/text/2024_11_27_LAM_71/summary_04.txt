And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's default judgment packet and has set a hearing to determine why the complaint should not be dismissed and/or the plaintiff's counsel should be sanctioned $250 for failing to enter a default judgment. The judge's decision is based on several reasons, including the fact that the proposed judgment is not in the correct format and does not include the fees requested, and the plaintiff's declaration lacks sufficient foundation to support its claim of ownership to the property in question. The judge has ordered the hearing to take place on December 27, 2024, at 8:30 AM in Department 71 at the Stanley Mosk Courthouse.
