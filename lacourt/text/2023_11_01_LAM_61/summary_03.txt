Significant Statements:
  - "An appeal does not stop the running of interest, and to obtain such result the obligor must make a sufficient tender." (Beeler v. American Trust Co.)
  - "A tender of performance must be free from any conditions which the creditor is not bound, on his part, to perform." (Civ. Code § 1494)
  - "By the affirmance of the judgment in this court it was declared that plaintiff should not have appealed the case. It was further declared that defendants' tender in effect was sufficient in amount to cover all plaintiff's just claims, and therefore should have been accepted when made. Plaintiff could refuse to accept the tender, and prosecute his appeal, but he thereby assumed the risk of losing the use of this money pending the appeal in case of an affirmance of the judgment." (Ferrea v. Tubbs)
  - "The motion to tax costs is therefore GRANTED in part. Plaintiff is entitled to post-judgment interest from the date of entry of the judgment to June 2, 2021, the date tender was made."
