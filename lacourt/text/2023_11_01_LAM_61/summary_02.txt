Summary:

The judge's tentative ruling sustains Oakwood Construction and Restoration Services, Inc.'s demurrer to the complaint as to the fourth, fifth, and sixth causes of action with leave to amend. The motion to strike is denied as moot. The ruling finds that Oakwood is not liable for intentional interference with contract and civil conspiracy because it is alleged to be an agent of Allstate Insurance Company, and the agent's immunity rule applies. The court also finds that the plaintiff's claims under the California Unfair Competition Law are insufficient and do not state a cause of action.
