And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion filed by the defendants to compel the deposition of the person most knowledgeable ("PMK") from the plaintiff's former employer, Professional Security Consultants ("PSC"), and to reopen discovery for the limited purpose of conducting this deposition. The motion is unopposed.

The judge denies the motion to compel PSC's attendance, as PSC has declared its willingness to produce a witness at a later date, and PSC was not given notice of the motion.

The judge grants the motion to reopen discovery for the limited purpose of conducting the deposition of PSC's PMK, as the plaintiff has not provided evidence to support his claim for lost income and future lost wages. The deposition must be completed by December 13, 2024.

The judge also notes that the court shall impose a monetary sanction against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to extend or to reopen discovery, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.
