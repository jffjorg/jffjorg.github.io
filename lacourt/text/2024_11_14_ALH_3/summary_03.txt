And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on General Motors, LLC's demurrer and motion to strike the claims made by Efrain de la Fuente against the company. The judge has sustained General Motors' demurrer to the Fourth Cause of Action for fraud, finding that Plaintiff has failed to plead affirmative misrepresentations with the requisite specificity. The judge has also sustained General Motors' demurrer to the Fifth Cause of Action for violation of the UCL, finding that Plaintiff has failed to plead a duty of disclosure and has not alleged a violation of another law.

However, the judge has overruled General Motors' demurrer to the Fifth Cause of Action, finding that Plaintiff has adequately stated a claim for unfair competition. The judge has granted General Motors' motion to strike Plaintiff's prayer for exemplary and punitive damages, finding that the FAC fails to include any basis for these remedies.

The judge has given General Motors 20 days' leave to amend its demurrer, and has given Plaintiff 20 days' leave to amend its FAC. The judge has also scheduled a hearing on the matter for November 14, 2024.
