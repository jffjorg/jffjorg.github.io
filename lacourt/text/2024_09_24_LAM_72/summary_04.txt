And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Marielita Palacios v. Fandom, Inc. The plaintiff alleges that Fandom, Inc. violated the California Invasion of Privacy Act (CIPA) by installing and using a code on its website that collected the plaintiff's IP address. The defendant demurred to the complaint and moved to strike certain portions of it.

The judge sustains the demurrer with leave to amend, meaning that the plaintiff has 15 days to amend its complaint to cure the defects identified by the court. The judge also denies the motion to strike as moot, since the demurrer has been sustained.

The judge concludes that the Accused Code is not a pen register because it does not collect destination information, but rather collects IP addresses of website visitors. The judge also notes that the plaintiff has not alleged that the Accused Code collects incoming information directed toward the plaintiff's computer, and therefore the court does not find that the code constitutes a trap and trace device.

The judge grants the parties' requests for judicial notice and takes notice of the submitted legislative materials as public records. The judge also cites various California court cases and statutes in its ruling.
