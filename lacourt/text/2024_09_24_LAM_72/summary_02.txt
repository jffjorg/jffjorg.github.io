Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for summary adjudication brought by Zurich American Insurance Company against Mitsubishi Electric US, Inc. The case involves a subrogation action brought by Zurich against Mitsubishi for breaching an indemnification agreement related to an elevator accident at a DoubleTree hotel.

The judge has granted summary adjudication on issues 4 and 8, which relate to whether Mitsubishi owes a duty to indemnify Zurich and whether Zurich has standing to pursue remedies against Mitsubishi. However, the judge has denied summary adjudication on the remaining issues, including whether Mitsubishi was at fault for the elevator accident and whether Mitsubishi has a duty to indemnify Zurich.

The judge's ruling is based on the testimony of expert witness Joseph Stabler, who originally testified that Mitsubishi was at fault for the elevator accident, but later changed his testimony to suggest that RIM was at fault. The judge has found that Stabler's prior testimony is not binding on Mitsubishi, and that there are triable issues of fact as to whether Mitsubishi has a duty to indemnify Zurich.
