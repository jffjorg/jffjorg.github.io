And here is the English summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the defendant BMW of North America, LLC's motion to stay the proceedings pending the California Supreme Court review of the appellate decision in Rodriguez v. FCA US, LLC. The defendant argued that if the Supreme Court affirms the decision, the plaintiff's claims will necessarily fail. However, the judge ruled that the plaintiff's claims are based on an independent Certified Pre-Owned warranty issued with the purchase of the used car, and therefore, the outcome of the Rodriguez case is not determinative. The judge noted that the defendant issued a Certified Pre-Owned warranty with the plaintiff's purchase, and this warranty is not based on the balance of a prior existing warranty. The judge concluded that a stay pending the outcome in Rodriguez is unwarranted.
