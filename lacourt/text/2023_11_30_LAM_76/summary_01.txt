And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling addresses a motion to strike the request for punitive damages and demurrers to the first amended complaint. The plaintiff, Henry Hojjati, alleges that the City of Los Angeles discriminated against him due to his physical disability and national origin/ancestry, and retaliated against him for engaging in protected activities under the Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA). The City of Los Angeles demurs to the complaint and moves to strike portions thereof.

The court overrules the demurrer to the first, fourth, and fifth causes of action, which allege discrimination and retaliation. The court also overrules the demurrer to the sixth cause of action, which alleges that the City of Los Angeles failed to prevent discrimination and retaliation from occurring or continuing.

The court grants the motion to strike the request for punitive damages, finding that punitive damages cannot be recovered against a public entity. The court also finds that the City of Los Angeles failed to accommodate the plaintiff's disability, but notes that this failure is not an adverse employment action for purposes of a FEHA discrimination claim.

The court orders the City of Los Angeles to answer the remaining allegations of the first amended complaint within 10 days. The court also notes that the plaintiff's allegations of discrimination and retaliation are sufficient to state a cause of action for purposes of a demurrer, regardless of the plaintiff's ability to prove the claim.
