RULING: Granted.
Plaintiff,
Jane RS Doe moves to compel moves to compel further responses to Request for
Production of Documents (set one), numbers 7, 10, 12, 13, 17, and 20-23, from
Defendant Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD). Plaintiff contends the
objections lack merit and a compelling interest for production exists. LAUSD in
opposition reiterates the broad scope of the requests, lack of narrow
tailoring, privileges, and privacy protections. Plaintiff in reply challenges
any withholding of documents, and at a minimum, requires production of a privilege
log. On the privacy objections, Plaintiff cites to the parties’ protective
order and ability to redact names. Plaintiff denies any burdensome arguments.

The
responses are collectively presented: “Responding Party incorporates by
reference the general objections set forth above as though fully set forth
herein. Responding Party further objects to request as vague, ambiguous and
impermissibly overbroad. Responding Party objects to the extent that this
request seeks information which is not reasonably calculated to lead to the
discovery of admissible evidence. Responding Party objects to this request to
the extent that it seeks information that violates the attorney work product
doctrine, attorney-client privilege, and/or the official information privilege.
Responding Party objects to this request on the grounds that it seeks
information that is private, privileged, and/or confidential that, if
disclosed, would constitute an unwarranted invasion of the privacy rights of
Responding Party or third parties under the United States Constitution, the
California Constitution, and/or any statutory or common law rights of privacy
or confidentiality, including Government Code section 6254(c).”
 
The vague, ambiguous and uncertain for of question
objections also lack merit. Defendants may not intentionally misconstrue a work
for obstreperous purposes. “Indeed,
where the question is somewhat ambiguous, but the nature of the information
sought is apparent, the proper solution is to provide an appropriate response.”
(Deyo v.
Kilbourne (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 771,
783 superseded by statute on unrelated ground as stated in Guzman v. General Motors Corp. (1984)
154 Cal.App.3d 438, 444.) “But ‘[f]or discovery purposes, information is relevant if
it “might reasonably assist a party in evaluating the case, preparing for
trial, or facilitating settlement….” [Citation.]
Admissibility is not the test and information, unless privileged, is
discoverable if it might reasonably lead to admissible evidence. [Citation.]
These rules are applied liberally in favor of discovery [citation], and
(contrary to popular belief), fishing expeditions are permissible in some
cases. [Citation.]’ (Citations.)”
(Cruz v. Superior Court (2004)
121 Cal.App.4th 646, 653–654.) 
 
 
The
requests are not vague, ambiguous, or seek irrelevant information. Nevertheless,
Plaintiff essentially requests LAUSD create an index of all former complaints
brought against LAUSD for the last 18 years involving every single student and
staff member. While the court disagrees with the form of question and relevance
objections, the court finds validity in the overbroad objection. (Obregon v. Superior
Court (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 424, 431; Calcor Space Facility, Inc. v. Superior Court (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th
216, 224–225.)
 
“Although
appellate courts have frequently stated ‘fishing expeditions’ are permissible
in discovery, there is a limit. ... In Greyhound Corp. v. Superior Court (1961) 56 Cal.2d 355 [], the seminal case in California
civil discovery, the court gave examples of improper ‘fishing’ which clearly
apply here: ‘The method of “fishing” may be, in a particular case, entirely
improper (i.e., insufficient identification of the requested information to
acquaint the other party with the nature of information desired, attempt to
place the burden and cost of supplying information equally available to both
solely upon the adversary, placing more burden upon the adversary than the
value of the information warrants, etc.). Such improper methods of 'fishing'
may be (and should be) controlled by the trial court under the powers granted
to it by the statute.” (Id. at pp. 384-385.) The concerns for avoiding undue burdens
on the “adversary” in the litigation expressed in Greyhound apply with even
more weight to a nonparty.’” (Calcor
Space Facility, Inc. v. Superior Court, supra, 53 Cal.App.4th at pp.
224–225.)
 
The
sheer scope and volume of the demand requires curtailing the vastness of the
request. The court adheres to a policy of limiting claims to the subject
Plaintiff and relevant circumstances in order to allow for robust adjudication
of the claims. 
 
Plaintiff
presents its pro forma proof of the meet and confer effort by simply
reiterating the necessity of the claim as completely relevant without
consideration to the actual time in the complaint: Berendt began molesting
Plaintiff in 2007, and was arrested in 2012. LAUSD counters as to the longer
time frame and involvement of persons beyond defendant Berendt, and presumably
beyond the actual campus. Nothing in the motion provides any address to these
valid objections. The court also considers the privilege objections. 
 
The attorney-client privilege attaches to a confidential
communication between the attorney and the client and bars discovery of the
communication irrespective of whether it includes unprivileged material.” (Costco Wholesale
Corp. v. Superior Court (2009) 47 Cal.4th 725, 734.) The transmission
of information between third parties and counsel also maintain attorney client
privilege protection, if the communication is in further interest of the
client. (Evid. Code, § 952.) “Once that party establishes facts necessary to
support a prima facie claim of privilege, the communication is presumed to have
been made in confidence and the opponent of the claim of privilege has the
burden of proof to establish the communication was not confidential or that the
privilege does not for other reasons apply.” (Costco Wholesale Corp. v. Superior Court, supra, 47 Cal.4th at p. 733.) 
 
The work product privilege applies where the sought after
documents contains Defendant’s “impressions, conclusions, opinions or legal
research or theories,” the information is protected by the work product
doctrine. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2018.030(c).) “An
objecting party may be entitled to protection if it can make a preliminary or
foundational showing that answering the interrogatory would reveal the
attorney's tactics, impressions, or evaluation of the case, or would result in
opposing counsel taking undue advantage of the attorney's industry or
efforts”].) (Coito v.
Superior Court (2012) 54 Cal.4th
480, 502.) Notes, statements, and impressions of the case are protected
by the work product doctrine. A list of potential witnesses is not work
product. (Id. at p. 495; Nacht & Lewis Architects, Inc. v.
Superior Court (1996) 47 Cal.App.4th 214, 217–218.)
 
The court cannot determine the basis of the subject
privilege objections. LAUSD suggests potential incident reports, but given the
overbroad nature of the requests, the court cannot determine meaningful
distinctions between notice of activity and pre-litigation incident reports
coming under the guise of work product to attorney client privilege material. The
court therefore declines to determine the validity of the objections and
instead directs the presentation of any and all material into a privilege log (as
discussed further below). 
 
The privacy interests however raise valid objections. The
privilege protections for students remain undisputed. Again given the broad
swath of requests, and the recitations of the standards, but otherwise limited
actual factual consideration to the potentially impacted students, the court
declines to contemplate the scope of any compelling interests for purposes of
the subject motion. The court also declines to
consider order the disclosure of identifying information under the protective
order, or engage in a third party notification system, if applicable
given the numerous statutory provisions. (See Pioneer Electronics (USA), Inc. v. Sup. Ct. (2007) 40 Cal.4th 360,
374-375; Belaire-West Landscape, Inc. v.
Sup. Ct. (2007) 149 Cal.App.4th 554, 561-562; Los Angeles Gay & Lesbian
Center v. Superior Court (2011) 194 Cal.App.4th 288, 307, 311.)
 
Rather
than outright deny the motion on grounds of overbroad parameters, or simply
compel a privilege log, however, the court offers boundaries for the parties to
establish in a more meaningful meet and confer effort and further production. The
court finds Plaintiff remains entitled to information for the years of
attendance in the subject school with Berendt as Plaintiff’s principal teacher
and/or years Berendt interacted with Plaintiff even if Plaintiff were not part
of Berendt’s classroom. It remains unclear when Plaintiff presumably progressed
to middle school and left the campus, but if the dates coincide, Plaintiff also
remains entitled to information involving Berendt up to the arrest date in
2012. The court finds no basis compelling production following either
graduation from elementary school or after Barendt became incarcerated for
purposes of the subject action. 
 
Plaintiff
may also conduct discovery into persons knowledgeable and responsible for
student welfare and faculty behavior. Such inquiry can include potential actual
or constructive knowledge based on prior or concurrent student reports
regarding Barendt. 
 
The
court otherwise finds a lack of sufficient support for discovery after the
arrest, especially given no other identified perpetrator or central figure, and
Plaintiff cannot recover punitive damages against the school district. (Lopez
v. Watchtower Bible & Tract Society of New York, Inc.
(2016) 246 Cal.App.4th 566, 591-594; see Doe v. Roman Catholic
Archbishop of Los Angeles (2021) 70 Cal.App.5th 657, 675-676.) If
other potential victims chose to come forward with claims against another staff
or faculty member, said potential plaintiff(s) may bring their own, separate
claims.
 
The
court therefore GRANTS the motion subject to further meet and confer efforts
delineating a time frame and limited to the campus. The court orders
supplemental production upon said agreed upon limitations. Any continued
privilege objections shall include a privilege.
 
The minimum amount of sanctions for each motion to compel
production of documents increased to $1,000 per motion. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2023.050, subd. (a)(1).) 
 
(a)
Notwithstanding any other law, and in addition to any other sanctions imposed
pursuant to this chapter, a court shall impose a one-thousand-dollar ($1,000) sanction, payable to the requesting party, upon a party,
person, or attorney if, upon reviewing a request for a sanction made pursuant
to Section 2023.040, the court finds any of the following:
(1) The
party, person, or attorney did not respond in good faith to a request for the
production of documents made pursuant to Section 2020.010, 2020.410, 2020.510,
or 2025.210, or to an inspection demand made pursuant to Section 2031.010.
(2) The
party, person, or attorney produced requested documents within seven days
before the court was scheduled to hear a motion to compel production of the
records pursuant to Section 2025.450, 2025.480, or 2031.320 that is filed by
the requesting party as a result of the other party's, person's, or
attorney's failure to respond in good faith.
(3) The
party, person, or attorney failed to confer in person, by telephone, letter, or
other means of communication in writing, as defined in Section 250 of the
Evidence Code, with the party or attorney requesting the documents in a
reasonable and good faith attempt to resolve informally any dispute concerning
the request.
 
(Code
Civ. Proc., § 2023.050)
 
Plaintiff requests sanctions, and the code entitles Plaintiff
to a minimum $1,000 recovery. Nevertheless, “[t]he
court may excuse the imposition of the sanction required by subdivision (a) if
the court makes written findings that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.050, subd. (c).) The reasons
documented in the order regarding the overbroad scope of discovery, lack of a
meaningful meet and confer effort, and minimal support for the valid concerns
raised by LAUSD, constitute a sufficient basis to forego imposition of
sanctions at this stage of the discovery dispute. 
 
The court does not conduct
independent discovery conferences. The court invites the parties to consider a
discovery referee if further guidance remains required over concerns requiring
review of privacy protected information.
 
Motion for Protective Order/Motion to Quash set for May 22,
2024.
 
Plaintiff to give notice.
