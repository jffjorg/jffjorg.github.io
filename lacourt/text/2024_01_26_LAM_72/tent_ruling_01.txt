Plaintiff Credilogical Systems, LLC (“Plaintiff”) seeks
default judgment against Defendant Albert Joseph Salas (“Defendant”)
 
Plaintiff requests:
 
(1) a
judicially-ordered foreclosure of the real property located at 1932 Thomas
Street, Los Angeles, California 90031; and
 
(2) costs in the amount of $513.45.
 
The Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s request for default judgment.
 
Background
 
On January 15, 2020, Plaintiff obtained a Judgment Quieting
Title to the real property located at 1932 Thomas Street, Los Angeles,
California 90031 against Defendant.
 
Plaintiff filed this action on February 22, 2021, raising a
claim for judicial foreclosure.
 
Default was entered against Defendant on July 9, 2021.
 
Plaintiff filed this application for default judgment on
January 19, 2024.
 
Legal Standard
 
CCP § 585 permits entry of a judgment after a Defendant has
failed to timely answer after being properly served.  A party seeking judgment on the default by
the Court must file a Form CIV-100 Request for Court Judgment, and: 
 
(1) Proof of service of the complaint and summons;
(2) A dismissal of
all parties against whom judgment is not sought (including Doe defendants) or
an application for separate judgment under CCP § 579, supported by a showing of
grounds for each judgment (CRC 3.1800(a)(7);
(3) A declaration
of non-military status as to the defendant (typically included in Form CIV-100)
(CRC 3.1800(a)(5));
(4) A brief summary of the case (CRC 3.1800(a)(1)); 
(5) Admissible
evidence supporting a prima facie case for the damages or other relief requested
(Johnson v. Stanhiser (1999) 72
Cal.App.4th 357, 361-362); 
(6) Interest computations as necessary (CRC 3.1800(a)(3)); 
(7) A memorandum of
costs and disbursements (typically included in Form CIV-100 (CRC 3.1800(a)(4));

(8) A request for
attorney’s fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties (CRC
3.1800(a)(9)), accompanied by a declaration stating that the fees were
calculated in accordance with the fee schedule as per Local Rule 3.214.  Where a request for attorney fees is based on
a contractual provision the specific provision must be cited; (Local Rule
3.207); and
(9) A proposed form
of judgment (CRC 3.1800(a)(6));
(10) Where an
application for default judgment is based upon a written obligation to pay
money, the original written agreement should be submitted for cancellation (CRC
3.1806). A trial court may exercise its discretion to accept a copy where the
original document was lost or destroyed by ordering the clerk to cancel the
copy instead (Kahn v. Lasorda's Dugout, Inc. (2003) 109 Cal.App.4th
1118, 1124);
(11) Where the
plaintiff seeks damages for personal injury or wrongful death, they must serve
a statement of damages on the defendant in the same manner as a summons (Code
Civ. Proc. § 425.11, subd. (c), (d)).
 
 
(California Rules
of Court rule 3.1800.)
 
Pursuant to Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5(a)(1), items are
allowable as costs under Section 1032 if they are “filing, motion, and jury
fees.”
 
A party who defaults only admits facts well pleaded in the
complaint or cross-complaint.  (Molen
v. Friedman (1998) 64 Cal.App.4th 1149, 1153-1154.)  Thus, the complaint must state a claim for
the requested relief.
           
 
Discussion
 
Service of the Complaint and Summons
 
          According
to the proof of service filed on May 28, 2021, Defendant was served on May 11,
2021 at 1932 Thomas Street, Los Angeles, CA 90031 via substitute service on Flora
Salas.
 
 
Dismissal of Other Parties
 
The Doe defendants were dismissed from the action on September
2, 2022, pursuant to Plaintiff’s request.
 
 
Non-Military Status
 
Calvin F. Love avers to Defendant’s non-military status.
 
 
Summary of the Case
 
Plaintiff provides a brief summary of the case in the
Declaration of John Welsome. Plaintiff adequately pleads its cause of action in
the Complaint.
 
 
Evidence of Damages
 
“Code of Civil Procedure section 580 prohibits the entry of
a default judgment in an amount in excess of that demanded in the complaint.”  (Kim v. Westmoore Partners, Inc. (2011)
201 Cal.App.4th 267, 286.) Moreover, “a statement of damages cannot be relied
upon to establish a plaintiff's monetary damages, except in cases of personal
injury or wrongful death.” (Ibid.) “In all other cases, when recovering
damages in a default judgment, the plaintiff is limited to the damages
specified in the complaint.” (Ibid.)
 
Here, Plaintiff does not seek damages, but rather seeks the
remedy of judicial foreclosure.
 
 
Interest
 
Plaintiff does not seek damages or interest.
 
 
Memorandum of Costs and Disbursements
 
Plaintiff includes a memorandum of costs in the submitted
Form CIV-100, averring that it expended $513.45 in costs.
 
 
Attorney’s Fees
 
          Plaintiff
does not seek attorney’s fees.
 
 
Proposed Form of Judgment
 
          Plaintiff
has submitted a proposed form of judgment consistent with the foregoing.
 
 
Submission of the Written Agreement
 
          California
Rule of Court 3.1806 states that “unless otherwise ordered” judgment upon a
written obligation to pay money requires a clerk’s note across the face of the
writing that there has been a judgment. Because this is not such a case, that
requirement does not apply.  
 
 
Statement of Damages
 
Plaintiff does not need to submit a statement of damages
because this is not a personal injury or wrongful death case.
