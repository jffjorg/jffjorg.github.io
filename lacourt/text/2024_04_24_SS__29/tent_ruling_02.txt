 Case Number:  20STCV35691    Hearing Date:   April 24, 2024    Dept:  29 Motion for Monetary Sanctions filed by Defendants Richard
Marc Zucker and Shaw Industries Group, Inc.
 
Tentative
The motion is denied.
Background
On September 17, 2020, Yanera Cooper (“Plaintiff”) filed
a complaint against Richard Marc Zucker, and Shaw Industries, Inc. for negligence
arising out of an automobile accident on the 405 Freeway.  The complaint states that the accident
occurred on October 3, 2020, but that must be a typographical error, as the
complaint was filed in September 2020.  
 
On April 15, 2022, Richard Marc Zucker and Shaw
Industries Group, Inc, erroneously sued as Shaw Industries, Inc., (collectively
“Defendants”) filed an answer.
 
On April 2,
2024, Defendants filed a motion for reimbursement of expenses incurred for the
late cancelation of the deposition of Plaintiff’s expert.
 
No opposition
has been filed. 
 
Legal Standard
In
Chapter 7 of the Civil Discovery Act, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010,
subdivision (d), defines “[m]isuses of the discovery process” to include
“[f]ailing to respond to or to submit to an authorized method of
discovery.”  
Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.030 states:
“To the extent authorized by the chapter governing any
particular discovery method or any other provision of this title, the court,
after notice to any affected party, person, or attorney, and after opportunity
for hearing, may impose the following sanctions against anyone engaging in
conduct that is a misuse of the discovery process.
(a)  The court may impose a monetary sanction
ordering that one engaging in the misuse of the discovery process, or any
attorney advising that conduct, or both pay the reasonable expenses, including
attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct. … “

Discussion
On July
18, 2023, the parties exchanged expert designations. (Mathis Decl., ¶ 4.)
Plaintiff designated Mr. John Smith as her accident reconstruction and
biochemical expert; on August 2, 2023, Defendants served notice of deposition for
the August 14, 2023 for Mr. Smith. (Id., ¶¶ 5, 6.) Plaintiff’s counsel
objected a week later. (Id., ¶ 7.) On September 20, 2023, Defendants
served an amended notice of deposition of Mr. Smith for October 10, 2023. (Id.,
¶ 9.) Timely objections were not served, and Defendants’ counsel followed-up
with Plaintiff’s counsel five days before the deposition. (Id., 11.) The
day before Mr. Smith’s deposition, Plaintiff’s counsel alerted Defendants that
the depositions could not proceed. (Id., ¶ 12.) Defendants contend they
incurred fees due to the late cancellation of Mr. Smith’s deposition, and
request $2,307.50 in monetary sanctions. (Id., ¶ 15.)
 
Plaintiff
has not filed an opposition. 
 
Defendants
seek monetary sanctions under Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.030.  Defendants argue that Plaintiff and her
counsel have engaged in conduct that is within the definition of “misuse of the
discovery process” under section 2023.010, subdivision (d).
 
The
request for sanctions is denied.  
 
Section
2023.010 includes definitions of “misuse of the discovery process” but does not
itself authorize sanctions.
 
Section
2023.030 provides for sanctions only “[t]o the extent authorized by the chapter
governing any
particular discovery method or any other provision of this title.”
 
As the Court of Appeal
recently held in an opinion written by Justice Moor in City of Los Angeles v. PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLC (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 466, “sections 2023.010
and 2023.030 do not independently authorize the trial court to impose monetary
sanctions for misuse of discovery … without regard to any other provision of
the Discovery Act.”  (Id. at p.
504.)  The Court is aware that the
California Supreme Court has granted review of the City of Los Angeles
case, but the Court notes that the order granting review, filed on January 25,
2023, states that pending review, the appellate opinion “may be cited,”
including “for its persuasive value.” 
The Court finds the reasoning of Justice Moor to be persuasive. 
Conclusion
The Court DENIES Defendants’ motion for
sanctions. 
Moving
Party is ordered to give notice.
