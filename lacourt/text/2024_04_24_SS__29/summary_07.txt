And here is the English-text summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Court has granted Pibe's motion to consolidate the Ornelaz Action (Case No. 22STCV33027) and the Talamantes Action (Case No. 23BBCV00602) for all purposes. The two cases arise out of a single motor vehicle accident in May 2022, and both involve similar causes of action against an overlapping group of defendants. The Court finds that consolidation of the cases will promote efficiency and avoid unnecessary duplication of effort. No party has opposed the motion, and therefore it appears that consolidation would not cause any party to suffer undue or unfair prejudice. The Ornelaz Action will be the lead case, and all future filings must be made in the Ornelaz Action.
