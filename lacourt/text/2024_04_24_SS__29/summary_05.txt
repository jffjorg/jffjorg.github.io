The court has granted Infinity Insurance Company's motion for leave to intervene in the case. The case involves a motor vehicle accident on March 22, 2020, and a complaint was filed by Jorge Gomez and Guadalupe Gomez against Teron Liggins, Trino Naranjo, and others. Infinity is the insurance carrier for Naranjo, who has failed to communicate with his counsel.

Therefore, the court granted Infinity's motion to intervene and allowed it to file a complaint-in-intervention within 10 days.
