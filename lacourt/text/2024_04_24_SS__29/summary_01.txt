And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling denies the Defendant's motion for leave to file a cross-complaint. The Defendant seeks to file a cross-complaint against the driver of the other vehicle in the 2023 accident and Roe defendants. However, the Court finds that it would not be in the interests of justice to allow the Defendant to file the proposed cross-complaint at this late date. The case has been pending for five years, and trial is set to begin in approximately two weeks. The Defendant waited over eight months to seek leave to file the cross-complaint and has not provided an adequate explanation for the delay. The Court concludes that the motion is denied.
