And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge has written a tentative ruling on a motion for monetary sanctions filed by the defendants, Richard Marc Zucker and Shaw Industries Group, Inc. The plaintiff, Yanera Cooper, filed a complaint against the defendants for negligence arising from an automobile accident. The defendants filed a motion for reimbursement of expenses incurred for the late cancellation of the deposition of the plaintiff's expert. The defendants seek $2,307.50 in monetary sanctions. However, the Judge denies the motion, citing the Court of Appeal's recent holding that sections 2023.010 and 2023.030 of the Civil Discovery Act do not independently authorize the trial court to impose monetary sanctions for misuse of discovery.
