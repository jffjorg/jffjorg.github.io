 Case Number:  23STCV23139    Hearing Date:   April 24, 2024    Dept:  29 Defendant’s
motion to compel Plaintiff Susan Mizrahi to respond to Form Interrogatories
(Set One) and Special Interrogatories (Set One)
Tentative
The
motion is granted.
The
requests for sanctions are denied.
Background
This
case arises out of an accident that occurred on November 10,
2021.  According to the Complaint, Plaintiffs Amnon Mizrahi and Susan
Mizrahi (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) were injured when they were struck by
their improperly secured vehicle after it rolled off a flat bed tow
truck.  (Complaint, ¶¶ 10-23.)
On
September 25, 2023, Plaintiffs filed the Complaint in this action against
Carmel Towing & Transport, Inc.; Bert’s Garage, Inc.; Automobile Club of
Southern California (“AAA”), and Does 1 through 25.  Plaintiffs
assert causes of actions for premises liability; negligence; vicarious
liability; and loss of consortium.  
AAA
filed its Answer to the Complaint on October 17, 2023.
On
November 30, 2023, AAA served discovery, including Form Interrogatories (Set
One) and Special Interrogatories (Set One) to Plaintiff Susan Mizrahi. (Harwood
Decl., ¶ 3 & Exhs. A-B.)  Plaintiffs did not respond to these
discovery requests.  (Id., ¶ 5.)
On March
4, 2024, AAA filed this motion to compel.  AAA also seeks sanctions.
Plaintiff has not filed
any opposition.
Legal Standard
A party
must respond to interrogatories within 30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2030.260, subd.(a).) If a party to whom interrogatories are directed
does not provide a timely response, the propounding party may move for an order
compelling response to the interrogatories. (Id., § 2030.290, subd.
(b).) There is no time limit for a motion to compel initial responses, and no
meet and confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2030.290; Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007)
148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules
of Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who fails to
provide a timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).)
When a
party moves to compel initial responses to interrogatories, “the court shall
impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010)
against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the
motion], unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (c).)
In Chapter 7 of the Civil Discovery Act, Code of Civil
Procedure section 2030.030 provides that the court may impose sanctions “[t]o
the extent authorized by the chapter governing any particular discovery method
or any other provision of this title.”  Code of Civil Procedure
section 2023.010, subdivision (d), defines “[m]isuses of the discovery process”
to include “[f]ailing to respond to or to submit to an authorized method of
discovery.”  Where a party or attorney has engaged in misuse of the
discovery process, the court may impose a monetary sanction in the amount of
“the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a
result of that conduct.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.020, subd.
(a).)
Discussion
Defendant
AAA served Plaintiff Susan Mizrahi with form interrogatories and special
interrogatories on November 30, 2023.  (Harwood Decl., ¶ 3 &
Exhs. A-B.)  Plaintiff has not responded.  (Id., ¶
5.)
AAA need
not show anything more.  The motion to compel is GRANTED. 
AAA’s
request for sanctions is denied.
Defendant
seeks sanctions under section 2030.290, subdivision (c), and section
2023.030. 
Section
2030.290, subdivision (c) authorizes an award of sanctions against a party or
attorney “who unsuccessfully makes or opposes” a motion to compel initial
responses.  Here, no opposition was filed, and so no award of
sanctions is authorized under this provision. 
 Section
2023.030 does “not independently authorize the
trial court to impose monetary sanctions for misuse of discovery.”  (City
of Los Angeles v. PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLC (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th
466, 504.)  (The Court is aware that the California Supreme Court has
granted review of the City of Los Angeles case, but the Court
notes that the order granting review, filed on January 25, 2023, states that
pending review, the appellate opinion “may be cited,” including “for its
persuasive value.”  The Court finds the reasoning of Justice Moor in
the City of Los Angeles case to be persuasive.)
Conclusion
The
Court GRANTS AAA’s motion to compel.
The
Court ORDERS Plaintiff Susan Mizrahi to provide written, code-compliant, and
verified responses, without objection, to AAA’s Form Interrogatories (Set One)
and Special Interrogatories (Set One) within 21 days of notice.
The
Court DENIES AAA’s request for sanctions.
Moving
party to give notice.
