further responses to Keolis’ Special Interrogatories, Set 1, Nos. 11, 19, 13,

ANALYSIS
 
CCP 2030.220 provides: 
 
“(a) Each answer in a response to interrogatories
shall be as complete and straightforward as the information reasonably
available to the responding party permits.
(b) If an interrogatory cannot be
answered completely, it shall be answered to the extent possible.
(c) If the responding party does
not have personal knowledge sufficient to respond fully to an interrogatory,
that party shall so state, but shall make a reasonable and good faith effort to
obtain the information by inquiry to other natural persons or organizations,
except where the information is equally available to the propounding party.”
 
Responses to interrogatories are due within 30 days after
service of the interrogatories.  CCP
2030.260(a).
 
CCP 2030.290 provides, in relevant part:
 
“If a party to whom interrogatories
are directed fails to serve a timely response, the following rules apply:
(a) The party to whom the
interrogatories are directed waives any right to exercise the option to produce
writings under Section
2030.230, as well as any objection to the interrogatories, including one
based on privilege or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4
(commencing with Section
2018.010). . . .”
 
Upon receipt of responses to interrogatories, the
propounding party may move for an order compelling further responses if the
propounding party deems that an answer is evasive or incomplete.  CCP 2030.300(a). 
 
In response to Special Interrogatory 10, Plaintiff stated
that she did receive Social Security Disability benefits (SSD).  Special Interrogatory 11 asks if Plaintiff
was receiving Social SSD to state: (a) the date she
applied for SSD, (b) the date she was awarded SSD, (c) the time period she had
been receiving SSD, (d) the nature of the injury Plaintiff claimed that
resulted in the award of SSD and (e) the date the injury occurred for which SSD
was awarded.  Plaintiff’s response of
“unknown” to subsections (a)-(c) is insufficient as there is no indication that
Plaintiff made any effort to obtain the information as required by CCP
2030.220.  The information is relevant to
Plaintiff’s claims and damages in this case.
 
Special Interrogatories 13, 31, 36 and 37 ask for
information regarding Plaintiff’s medical history for the last seven years (i.e.,
where/from whom she received evaluations, diagnoses, care, treatment).  Plaintiff’s 7/24/23 responses to the
interrogatories served on 6/1/23 were untimely. 
Therefore, Plaintiff waived the right to exercise the option to produce
writings under CCP 2030.230 as Plaintiff has done in response to these
interrogatories.  CCP 2030.290(a).  Similarly, Plaintiff waived the right to object
by claiming that the information is equally available to Keolis.  
 
Special Interrogatory 19 asks Plaintiff to provide the
dates of her residency at all board and care facilities, nursing facilities,
adult day care facilities and/or residential care facilities that Plaintiff was
a patient or resident at any time. 
Plaintiff’s response is incomplete and evasive.  Plaintiff has not met her obligation to make
a reasonable inquiry to obtain the necessary information.  
 
Special Interrogatories 40, 41 and 44 ask for information
regarding Plaintiff’s medical expenses and medical special damages.  As noted above, since Plaintiff failed to
timely respond to the interrogatories, her reference to documents in response
to these interrogatories is insufficient. 
CCP 2030.290(a).
 
Special Interrogatories 65, 68 and 71 ask for information
regarding persons that have knowledge regarding Plaintiff’s claim that Keolis’
staff was incompetent, Keolis’ conduct was a willful and conscious disregard of
Plaintiff’s rights and safety and that Plaintiff was carelessly dropped on the
bathroom floor.  Again, Plaintiff’s
reference to documents is improper due to her untimely responses.  CCP 2030.290(a).
 
Keolis is entitled to an award of sanctions against
Plaintiff and her attorney, Steven C. Gambardella, for their failure to comply
with their discovery obligations.  CCP
2023.010(h), (i); CCP 2023.030; 2030.300(d). 
However, the sanctions requested, $1,800.00, are reduced to $1,200.00 (1
hour to prepare the motion + 2 hours to prepare the separate statement + ½ hour
to prepare for the hearing + ½ hour to appear = 3 hours multiplied by
$300/hour).   
 
CONCLUSION
 
The motion is granted. 
Further responses are due and sanctions are payable within 15 days.
