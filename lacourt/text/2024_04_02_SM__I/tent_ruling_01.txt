  Case Number:  21SMCV00857    Hearing Date:   April 2, 2024    Dept:  I The matter is here for a status conference re:
Settlement.  The court received a notice
of conditional partial settlement.  The
court understands “partial” in that the settlement does not affect the severed
portion of the case.  However, the court
must better understand “conditional.” 
The court will not delay or postpone the trial unless there is an
enforceable agreement under 664.6.  The
court assumes that the parties required the long weekend to put it to bed,
which is fine.  But otherwise, the court
needs to know whether to call a venire tomorrow.
