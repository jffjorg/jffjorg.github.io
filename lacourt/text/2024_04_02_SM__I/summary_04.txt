Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English:

The court has reviewed the motion to continue the trial and is inclined to deny it. The court notes that motions to continue are disfavored and that the parties have not demonstrated sufficient diligence to justify a continuance. The court has assigned trial slots and did so well in advance, and the fact that this case is set for trial on April 22, 2024 means that other cases could not go on that date. The court notes that the parties have not completed discovery and that the defense did not commit to mediating earlier in the case. The court sees no diligence by the parties that would justify a continuance and believes that the delay is the fault of the parties, rather than unforeseen.
