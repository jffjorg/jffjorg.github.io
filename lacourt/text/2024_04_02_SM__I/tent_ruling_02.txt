 Case Number:  21SMCV01769    Hearing Date:   April 2, 2024    Dept:  I The court is not sure what is remaining of this case.  The court sees that the cross-complaint has
been dismissed, but the court is unsure if the complaint remains live.  If the case has been fully dismissed, then
the court will VACATE THE TRIAL DATE and no further hearings are required.
 
However, if the case remains live, the court is
concerned.  The FSC order was given no
later than 9/8/23, but no FSC papers have been filed.  The court will inquire as to why that might
be.  Of course, the matter is NOT READY
FOR TRIAL and the court will therefore VACATE THE TRIAL DATE.  However, whether sanctions are appropriate
depends on the reasons why nothing was filed. 
Having said that, if the reason is that the case is settled then that,
of course, is excellent cause.
