And here is the English text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling is that the defendant's failure to make timely payments is a breach of the settlement agreement. The defendant wrote two checks, one for $100,000 and one for $50,000, but stopped payment on both after writing them. The $100,000 check was returned to the defendant's account, but the $50,000 check was not. The court finds that the defendant's actions were deliberate and not a mere mistake. The court grants the plaintiff's application for judgment and orders the defendant to pay the outstanding amount. The court suggests that the plaintiff consider requiring the defendant to make a "security" payment in advance to mitigate the risk of future defaults.
