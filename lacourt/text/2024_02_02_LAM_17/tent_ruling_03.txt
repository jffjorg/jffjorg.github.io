[1] Little was presented with regard to
Stacy other than Mom has lived with her for years sharing a room with Stacy’s
daughter.  Stacy did not appear in court.

 





[2] The scope of Defendant’s contribution is discussed in detail
below.

 





[3] Defendant testified she gave her
mother the $400 a week depicted in the photos so Mom could pay it back to her
for rent.  This begs the question: if
Daughter was paying for Mom’s rent, how could Mom accumulate $54,000 in back
rent?

 





[4] Richard testified he is a
cement finisher for the City of Los Angeles, and previously worked as an
insurance claims adjuster.  He also
testified to applying a roof coating to Hatteras himself.

 





[5] While the timing is unclear, at some
point Alpha was fixed and sold. Mom bounced between living at Stagg and with
Stacy.  

 





[6] The e-mails indicate Safeco adjusters
made multiple attempts and left messages for Defendant, and the insurance
company had also arranged for a water remediation specialist, Paul Davis
Restoration, to take immediate action to prevent mold growth. Additionally, cross-complainant
Richard, as a former insurance adjuster, testified it was his opinion the water
leaks would have been covered by insurance.

 





[7] The Court declines
Defendant’s request that appraisals be performed with the house in its present
condition.  The present horrific
condition is due entirely to Defendant’s actions, inactions, and lifestyle.  Permitting such an appraisal is contrary to public
policy for any heir subject to a UPHPA partition action would merely trash the
place and buy it back at a reduced appraised price.

 





[8] While the Court notes Defendant objected to the appointment
of Mr. Taylor, Defendant did not propose any other names or options in her
Opposition to the Proposed Statement of Decision or the hearing on January 25,
2024, that followed it.

 





[9] 2005 (Exh. 21), 2006 (Exh. 22), … 2023
(Exh. 39).

 





[10] In mid-2021, Mom stopped
writing paper checks and started paying by electronic bank transfer.

 





[11] Defendant made a big deal during the
trial about having to pay for the majority of the maintenance at Hatteras. In
Defendant’s written closing argument, Defendant introduced several new
accounting exhibits that included documents that were not discussed in the
testimony nor introduced into evidence. 
These late compilations could not be considered.

     Furthermore,
the Court does not find maintenance an expense that should be shared because
Defendant, Richard, and their two children lived at Hatteras while Mom was
forced to live elsewhere. After reviewing the photos in Exh. 6, the Court
concludes any wear and tear to the property (including maintenance) could not be
fairly attributed to a non-resident.

 





[12] The amount of $943.94 was the amount
for the first mortgage at Hatteras. 
Defendant presented many, many check fronts OR bank statements
for that amount but never both.

 





[13] The Court does not make a habit of referencing unadmitted
exhibits, however those mentioned were testified to by Defendant and at the
same time are relevant in that they seriously undermined Defendant’s
credibility.

 





[14] Also see, Exh. 101-31 versus 33-114;
Exh. 101-32 versus Exh. 36-115; and Exh. 101-33 versus 36-154; Exh. 101-34
versus Exh. 37-33. 

 





[15] These “Buy Hatteras” checks were
marked as Exhibits 101:13,15,16 but never introduced into evidence.

 





[16] The date Mom bought the Alpha
condominium and moved to Glendale.
