And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to continue the trial, which is currently set for March 11, 2024. The plaintiff sought a continuance due to a mediation deadline on March 8, 2024, and a pending motion for leave to file an amended complaint on March 5, 2024. However, the judge found no good cause to grant the continuance, citing that the parties have had over a year to prepare for the trial, the mediation deadline came and went, and the parties have repeatedly been advised to treat the trial date as firm. The judge also noted that the decision to not prepare for the trial does not amount to good cause. The case is set to proceed as scheduled.
