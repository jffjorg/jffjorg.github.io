HASMIK

         vs.
 
COUNTY
  OF LOS ANGELES 
 
                                         


 Case No.: 
  22STCV11119
 
 
 
 Hearing
  Date:  February 2, 2024



 
Plaintiff’s motion to continue
trial is DENIED. 
 
            On
4/1/2022, Plaintiff Hasmik Yaghobyan (Plaintiff) filed suit against County of
Los Angeles and Fermando Lemus, alleging: (1) sexual harassment; (2) sexual
battery; (3) retaliation; (4) failure to prevent discrimination; (5) disability
discrimination; (6) failure to accommodate; and (7) failure to engage in the
interactive process. 
 
            Now,
Plaintiff moves to continue trial.
 
Discussion
 
            Trial
is currently set in this matter for 3/11/2024. Plaintiff seeks a continuance
for  the following reasons: (1) mediation
is set to take place on 3/8/2024, just one business day before trial and more
than a week after the Final Status Conference (FSC); (2) there is a pending
motion for leave to file a FAC set for 3/5/2024, less than one week before the
scheduled trial. Plaintiff notes that the parties have stipulated to a
continuance. 
 
However, the
Court finds no good cause exists to grant the continuance. The power to
determine whether a continuance is warranted is an incident of the trial
court’s broad and inherent power to control the scheduling of proceedings
before it. (See Cottle v. Super. Ct. (1992) 3 Cal.App.4th 1367, 1376). 
 
First, the
trial date was set on 11/10/2022. As such, the parties have been aware of the
trial date for over a year, and have had extensive time to prepare with this
trial date in mind.
 
Second, the
mediation deadline came and went on 12/12/23, with the parties refusing to
agree on an MSC date. 
 
Third, the
Court has repeatedly advised the parties to treat the trial date as firm. The
Court’s calendar is impacted, and it cannot accommodate trial continuances
which are a function of the parties’ decision not to prepare. The decision to
not take the trial date seriously does not amount to good cause. 
 
            Based
on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s motion to continue trial is denied. 
 
It is so ordered.
