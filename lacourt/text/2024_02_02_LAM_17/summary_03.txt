And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses the dispute between the parties regarding the partition of the property, Hatteras, and the amount of back rent owed. The judge notes that the defendant, Richard, did not appear in court, while the plaintiff, Mom, has lived with Stacy and her daughter for years. The judge questions the defendant's claim that she gave her mother $400 per week for rent, given the accumulation of $54,000 in back rent.

The judge declines the defendant's request for appraisals, citing the defendant's actions, inactions, and lifestyle as the cause of the property's current condition. The judge also finds that maintenance at Hatteras should not be shared, as the defendant, Richard, and their two children lived at the property while Mom was forced to live elsewhere.

The judge notes that the defendant objected to the appointment of Mr. Taylor, but did not propose any alternative names or options. The court also finds that the defendant's late-submitted accounting exhibits were not considered and that the "Buy Hatteras" checks were not introduced into evidence.

The judge's ruling is subject to change based on further evidence and argument.
