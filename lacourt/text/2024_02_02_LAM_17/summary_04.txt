And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants All In Credit Union (AICU) leave to file a First Amended Cross-Complaint (FAXC) against Entron Holding, Inc. and others. The FAXC seeks to add Sunlight Financial LLC as a cross-defendant for breach of contract and alleges that Entron did not obtain permits to do the solar panel work and went out of business after receiving payment from AICU. The Judge agrees to grant leave to amend based on the strong policy favoring leave to amend, citing Atkinson v. Elk Corp. (2003) 109 Cal.App.4th 739, 761. The ruling states that no meaningful prejudice will result to any party given that trial is not until August 2024.
