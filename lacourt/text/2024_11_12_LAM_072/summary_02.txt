And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the motion to strike the prayer for punitive damages filed by the plaintiff, Yazmin Sambrano. The motion was filed by the defendants, Karen Manucharyan and Karen Yesayan, who argue that the plaintiff failed to allege facts that would support a claim for punitive damages. The judge agrees, finding that the plaintiff's allegations are conclusory and lack specific factual assertions that would show oppression, malice, or fraud by the defendants. The judge relies on California law, including California Code of Civil Procedure § 436 and California Civil Code § 3294, in reaching its decision. The judge notes that punitive damages are only appropriate when a defendant acts with malice, oppression, or fraud, and that the plaintiff's allegations do not meet this standard.
