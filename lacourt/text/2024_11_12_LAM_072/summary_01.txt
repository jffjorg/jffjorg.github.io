And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge denies the Plaintiff's motion for declaratory relief, which seeks a declaration that Labor Code § 240.11 requires employees at salons/barbershops to be paid all hours worked at twice the minimum wage when commission is included as part of their compensation. The Judge finds that the controversy is not ripe for determination because it is a past dispute involving a terminated employment relationship, and declaratory relief is only available to prevent future wrongs. The Judge also notes that the Plaintiff's allegations regarding the wage he was owed are properly litigated alongside the rest of his wage and hour claims.
