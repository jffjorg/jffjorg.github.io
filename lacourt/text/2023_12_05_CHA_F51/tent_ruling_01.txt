  Case Number:  22CHCV00394    Hearing Date:   December 5, 2023    Dept:  F51 MOTION TO BE
RELIEVED AS COUNSEL

Los Angeles Superior Court Case # 22CHCV00394

 
Motion filed: 6/28/23 
 
MOVING ATTORNEY: Steffanie Stelnick (“Counsel”)
CLIENT: Plaintiff Napa Industries, LLC (“Plaintiff”)
NOTICE: OK
 
RELIEF REQUESTED: An order relieving Counsel as attorney
of record for Plaintiff. 
 
TENTATIVE RULING: The motion is denied without
prejudice.
 
In a civil action, an attorney may
move to be relieved as counsel at any time during the proceedings after giving
notice to his client. (Code Civ. Proc. § 284.) The moving attorney shall file
with his motion: (1) a notice of the motion, directed to the client using
Judicial Council form MC-051; (2) a declaration in support of the motion using
Judicial Council form MC-052; and (3) a proposed order granting the motion; all
to be served on the client and all other parties who have appeared in the case.
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362.) If the notice is served on the client by
mail, the motion must also be supported by a declaration “stating facts showing
that either: (A) The service address is the current residence or business
address of the client; or (B) The service address is the last known residence
or business address of the client and the attorney has been unable to locate a
more current address after making reasonable efforts to do so within 30 days
before the filing of the motion to be relieved.” (Id., subd.
(d)(1).)  
 
On 9/27/23, at a previous hearing
on the instant motion, the Court found that “it does not appear that Counsel
served NPI Debt Fund with this motion and the accompanying papers. The motion
is continued to allow for service on this party. All other statutory
requirements for the motion have been satisfied.” (9/27/23 Min. Order, p. 2.)
 
Since that hearing date, no updated
proof of service of the instant motion and accompanying papers on NPI Debt Fund
has been filed. Instead, Counsel filed a Substitution of Attorney substituting
Plaintiff as its own new legal representative. (11/28/23 Sub. of Attorney.)
 
“Under a long-standing common law
rule of procedure, a corporation, unlike a natural person, cannot represent
itself before courts of record in propria persona, nor can it represent itself
through a corporate officer, director or other employee who is not an attorney.
It must be represented by licensed counsel in proceedings before courts of
record.” (CLD Construction, Inc. v. City of San Ramon (2004) 120
Cal.App.4th 1141, 1145; see also Merco Constr. Engineers, Inc. v. Municipal
Court (1978) 21 Cal.3d 724, 730 (“A corporation cannot in fact appear in
court except through an agent.”).) 
 
“The rule requiring that a licensed
attorney must represent a corporation is not limited in application to
corporations but also applies to unincorporated associations and other
entities. The fundamental rule is that ‘[a] person who is not an attorney
authorized to practice law in this state cannot represent anyone other than
himself.’” (1 Cal. Affirmative Def. § 18:14 (2d ed.), quoting Roddis v. Strong
(1967) 250 Cal.App.2d 304, 311.)
 
Based on the foregoing, the Court
finds that Plaintiff may not be self-represented, and the Substitution of
Attorney is therefore invalid. The Court denies the instant motion without
prejudice.
