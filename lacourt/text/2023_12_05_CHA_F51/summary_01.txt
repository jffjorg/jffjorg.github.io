And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Napa Industries, LLC (Plaintiff) vs. NPI Debt Fund (Defendant), case number 22CHCV00394. The motion filed by Counsel, Steffanie Stelnick, on June 28, 2023, seeks an order relieving her as attorney of record for Plaintiff. The Court previously found that Counsel did not serve NPI Debt Fund with the motion and accompanying papers, and the motion was continued to allow for service. However, no updated proof of service has been filed, and instead, Counsel filed a Substitution of Attorney substituting Plaintiff as its own new legal representative.

The Court finds that Plaintiff, being an unincorporated association, must be represented by licensed counsel and cannot represent itself. Therefore, the Substitution of Attorney is invalid, and the Court denies the instant motion without prejudice.
