  Order RE:
 
plaintiff’s motion to compel further
  responses to special interrogatories
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                 Plaintiff Seran Ng, D.M.D.,
Inc.
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Defendant Yang Lu
Motion to Compel Further Responses to Special Interrogatories
The court
considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers filed in connection with
this motion. 
EVIDENTIARY OBJECTIONS
The court rules on plaintiff Seran
Ng, D.M.D. Inc.’s evidentiary objections, filed on April 25, 2024, as follows:
Objections Nos. 1 and 8 are overruled. 
Objections Nos. 2-7 and 9 are sustained. 
DISCUSSION
Plaintiff Seran Ng, D.M.D. Inc. (“Plaintiff”) moves the court for an
order (1) compelling defendant Yang Lu (“Defendant”) to serve further responses
to Plaintiff’s Special Interrogatories, Set Ten, numbers 136 and 137, and (2)
awarding monetary sanctions in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant in the
amount of $3,621.65.
The court finds that Defendant has not shown that Plaintiff’s motion
is untimely because it was filed after Defendant filed a motion for a
protective order.  The court also finds that,
for purposes of this motion, Defendant has not shown that she was not required
to answer the subject two special interrogatories on the ground that Plaintiff
propounded more than 35 interrogatories because Plaintiff has submitted
evidence establishing that it submitted a declaration that satisfies Code of
Civil Procedure sections 2030.030 and 2030.050. 
(Chan Decl., Ex. A, p. 4 [Chan declaration regarding additional
discovery].)  Although Defendant filed a
motion for a protective order on December 20, 2023, Defendant did not move to
advance the September 30, 2024 hearing date on her motion until April 24, 2024
(1) because she believed that the court would grant her motion for summary
judgment, and (2) two days before the first hearing on Plaintiff’s pending
motions to compel her further responses to discovery.[1]  (Apr. 24, 2024 Ex Parte App., p. 6:3-18.)
The court grants Plaintiff’s motion to compel Defendant’s further
responses to Special Interrogatories, numbers 136 and 137 because Defendant’s
objections to those interrogatories are without merit.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (a)(3).)

The court grants Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions against
Defendant.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2030.300, subd. (d).)  The court
finds that $1,661.65 ((4 hours x $400 hourly rate) + $61.65 filing fee) is a
reasonable amount of sanctions to impose against Defendant in connection with
this motion.  (Chan Decl., ¶¶ 23-25.) 
The court denies Defendant’s request for monetary sanctions against
Plaintiff.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2030.300, subd. (d).) 
ORDER
            The court grants plaintiff Seran Ng,
D.M.D. Inc.’s motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories. 
            Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 2030.300, the court orders defendant Yang Lu to serve further, full and
complete answers to plaintiff Seran Ng, D.M.D. Inc.’s Special Interrogatories,
numbers 136 and 137, which comply with Code of Civil Procedure sections
2030.210-2030.250, within 20 days of the date of service of this order. 
            The court orders defendant Yang Lu
to pay monetary sanctions to plaintiff Seran Ng, D.M.D. Inc. in the amount of $1,661.65
within 30 days of the date of service of this order. 
The court orders plaintiff Seran Ng, D.M.D. Inc.  to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
 
DATED:  May 2, 2024
