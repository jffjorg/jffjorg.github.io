And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has denied Plaintiff Yessenia Perez's request for default judgment against Defendant Dr. Sebi's Cell Food, LLC. The court found two defects in the Plaintiff's request. First, the Plaintiff did not file a mandatory Request for Entry of Default. Second, the court found that even if the Plaintiff had filed that document, it would not be able to enter default judgment against the Defendant because the Plaintiff's Complaint does not specify the amount of damages sought. The court cited California law and previous court decisions to support its decision, stating that a judgment awarding any amount of damages in excess of that demanded in the complaint would be void.
