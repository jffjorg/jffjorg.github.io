  Order RE:
 
plaintiff’s request for court judgment by
  default
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                 Plaintiff Yessenia Perez
 
RESPONDING PARTY:        n/a
Request for Court Judgment by Default
Plaintiff Yessenia Perez (“Plaintiff”) requests that the court enter
default judgment in her favor and against defendant Dr. Sebi’s Cell Food, LLC
(“Defendant”) in the total amount of $286,858.47, consisting of (1) $8,480 in
special damages, (2) $250,000 in general damages,      (3) $25,000 in attorney’s fees, (4)
$834.47 in costs, and (5) $2,544 in prejudgment interest.  (Memo., pp. 6:22-7:5.)
The court notes two defects in Plaintiff’s request for default
judgment. 
First, Plaintiff did not file with the court the mandatory Request for
Entry of Default (made on Judicial Council form CIV-100), required by
California Rules of Court, rule 3.1800(a). 
Second, even if Plaintiff had filed that document, the court finds
that it would not be able to enter default judgment against Defendant in any
amount because Plaintiff’s Complaint does not specify the amount of damages
sought against Defendant.   
“The relief granted to the plaintiff, if there is no answer, cannot
exceed that demanded in the complaint . . . .” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 580, subd. (a).)  “Thus, ‘in all default judgments the demand
sets a ceiling on recovery,’ and a judgment purporting to grant relief beyond
that ceiling is void for being in excess of jurisdiction.  [Citation.]” 
(Sass v. Cohen (2020) 10 Cal.5th 861, 863.)  “Where no amount of damages is demanded any
amount awarded is by definition greater than the amount demanded.”  (Falahati v. Kondo (2005) 127
Cal.App.4th 823, 830-831.) 
Here, Plaintiff’s Complaint does not demand a certain amount of
damages against Defendant, and instead (1) alleges that Plaintiff has suffered
damages “in an amount according to proof[,]” and (2) prays “[f]or damages
according to proof[.]”  (Compl.,
¶¶ 32, 42, 49, 56, 70, 79, 90; Compl., Prayer, ¶¶ 1, 4, 5.)  Thus, the entry of default judgment awarding any
amount of damages in favor of Plaintiff against Defendant would be void for
being in excess of jurisdiction.  (Sass,
supra, 10 Cal.5th at p. 863; Falahati, supra, 127
Cal.App.4th at pp. 830-831.) 
The court therefore denies plaintiff Yessenia Perez’s request for
court judgment by default against defendant Dr. Sebi’s Cell Food, LLC. 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
