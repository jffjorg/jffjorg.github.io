HOWARD’S MOTION TO TAX COSTS
Defendant and
cross-complainant Howard Management Group (“Howard”) moves the court for an
order (1) striking the memorandum of costs filed by cross-defendant Pacific
Coast Elevator Corporation d/b/a Amtech Elevator Services (“Amtech”) or,
alternatively, (2) taxing various costs. 
First, the court finds that
Howard has not shown that Amtech’s memorandum of costs was not filed within the
time limits set forth by California Rules of Court, rule 3.1700.
“A prevailing party who claims
costs must serve and file a memorandum of costs within 15 days after the date
of service of the notice of entry of judgment or dismissal by the clerk under
Code of Civil Procedure section 664.5 or the date of service of written notice
of entry of judgment or dismissal, or within 180 days after entry of judgment,
whichever is first.”  (Cal. Rules of Ct.,
rule 3.1700, subd. (a)(1).) 
The parties do not dispute
that (1) Howard filed a Request for Dismissal of its Cross-Complaint, which
alleged causes of action against defendant and cross-defendant 1544 9th Street,
LLC (“9th Street”) and Amtech, on February 9, 2024, (2) pursuant to that
request, the clerk dismissed Howard’s Cross-Complaint on February 13, 2024, and
(3) Amtech filed and electronically served its memorandum of costs on February
26, 2024.  (Feb. 9, 2024 Request for
Dismissal; Feb. 26, 2024 Memo. of Costs, MC-010.)  The parties do dispute, however, whether the
court’s January 5, 2024 order granting Amtech’s motion for determination of
good faith regarding the settlement that it entered into with plaintiff Sofia
Nemzer (“Plaintiff’) constitutes a dismissal of Howard’s Cross-Complaint.  The court finds that it does not. 
The court acknowledges that a
“trial court has the inherent power to dismiss a cross-complaint for equitable
indemnity, without notice, when the alleged indemnitor has entered into a good
faith settlement with the claimant.”  (Hale
v. Laden (1986) 178 Cal.App.3d 668, 670.) 
However, the cases relied on by Howard concerned a trial court’s
authority (1) to dismiss a cross-complaint in connection with motions for
determination of good faith settlement and a request for dismissal or order
barring a claim for comparative indemnity, and (2) to dismiss a cross-complaint
upon an ex parte request to do so based on a prior determination of a good
faith settlement.  (Greshko v. County
of Los Angeles (1987) 194 Cal.App.3d 822, 828 [city and county
cross-defendants filed motions for determination of good faith settlement, and
(1) city cross-defendant “also moved for dismissal[,]” and (2) county
cross-defendant “sought an order barring [the] claim for comparative
indemnity”], 830 [determining that the court did not err in striking the
cross-complaint “which, after the good faith determination, became irrelevant
to resolution of the remaining issues”]; Hale, supra, 178
Cal.App.3d at p. 672.)  In those instances,
the trial court was determined to have been permitted to strike the
cross-complaints because they had become “irrelevant to resolution of the
remaining issues” upon the good faith determination.  (Hale, supra, 178 Cal.App.3d at
p. 673.) 
Here, the court’s January 5,
2024 order did not grant a request by Amtech to dismiss Howard’s
Cross-Complaint, although the court may have had the authority to do so.  Thus, the court finds that its January 5,
2024 order does not constitute a dismissal of Howard’s Cross-Complaint, such
that the 15-day deadline to file the memorandum of costs began to run on the
date of service of the notice of entry of the order.  Amtech filed its memorandum of costs on
February 26, 2024, within 15 days after the date that Howard’s Cross-Complaint
was dismissed (i.e., February 13, 2024). 
(Cal. Rules of Ct., rule 3.1700, subd. (a)(1).) 
Second, the court finds that
Howard has not shown that Amtech is not a prevailing party on its
Cross-Complaint.  Howard dismissed its
Cross-Complaint against, inter alia, Amtech, with prejudice, on February
13, 2024.  (Feb. 9, 2024 Request for
Dismissal.)  Thus, Amtech is a prevailing
party on Howard’s Cross-Complaint.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 1032, subd. (a)(4) [prevailing party includes “a defendant
in whose favor a dismissal is entered”].) 
Third, the court finds that
Howard has not shown that Amtech’s requested costs should be offset by the
settlement amount of $35,000 with Plaintiff pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 877.  That statute “directs that
‘claims’ against nonsettling defendants be reduced by the amount of the
settlement consideration.”  (Reed v.
Wilson (1999) 73 Cal.App.4th 439, 444.) 
“[T]he word ‘claims’ in section 877 generally refers to a claim of
liability for damages and not to costs awarded to a prevailing party after a
claim of liability has been adjudicated.” 
(Id. at pp. 444-445.) 
Thus, section 877 does not allow for an offset of costs.  (Ibid.) 
Fourth, the court grants
Howard’s request to tax $613.35 in costs. 
The court finds that Howard
has met its burden to show that the following costs were not reasonably
necessary to the conduct of the litigation regarding Howard’s Cross-Complaint
against Amtech: (1) $37.95 in costs incurred in filing Amtech’s answer to 9th
Street’s Cross-Complaint; (2) $513.75 in fees to reserve a hearing on a motion
for summary judgment, which Amtech never filed; and (3) $61.65 for “Good Faith
Settlement” dated November 6, 2023, since (i) Amtech did not file its motion
for determination of good faith settlement until December 8, 2023 and (ii)
Amtech appears to have also requested $37.95 in filing costs for that motion on
December 15, 2023.  (Memo. of Costs,
MC-011, ¶¶ 1, subds. (c), (e), (f); Kelly Decl., ¶ 6 [Amtech paid the
$513.75 nonrefundable reservation fee but did not file the motion]; Code Civ.
Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (c); Adams v. Ford Motor Co. (2011) 199
Cal.App.4th 1475, 1486 [the burden is on the party challenging costs “to
demonstrate that they were not reasonable or necessary”].)  
The court notes that Howard
has also argued that the $3,150 in mediation costs were not reasonably
necessary because (1) the referenced April 5, 2023 mediation did not occur, and
       (2) no mediation was conducted by
Adjudicate, Inc.  (Memo. of Costs,
MC-011, ¶ 16.)  Amtech has submitted
evidence, in its opposition, explaining that it incorrectly identified the
mediation provider to be Adjudicate, Inc. and listed the invoice date of April
5, 2023, instead of the date on which the mediation occurred.  (Kelly Decl., ¶ 7; Kelly Decl., Ex. C
[Judicate West invoice in the amount of $3,150].)  The court finds that the costs incurred in
mediation were reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation and are
reasonable in amount, and therefore exercises its discretion to allow these
costs.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5,
subd. (c).) 
9TH STREET’S MOTION TO STRIKE COSTS OR,
IN THE ALTERNATIVE, TAX COSTS
Defendant and
cross-complainant 9th Street moves the court for an order (1) striking the
memorandum of costs filed by Amtech or, alternatively, (2) taxing various
costs. 
 
First, the court finds that
9th Street has not met its burden to show that Amtech’s memorandum of costs was
untimely on the ground that it was filed more than 15 days after notice of
entry of the court’s January 5, 2024 order granting its motion for
determination of good faith settlement for the same reasons set forth above in
connection with Howard’s motion to tax costs.  (Feb. 9, 2024 Request for Dismissal of 9th
Street’s Cross-Complaint [dismissing 9th Street’s Cross-Complaint on February
13, 2024]; Memo. of Costs filed Feb. 26, 2024; Cal. Rules of Ct., rule 3.1700,
subd. (a).) 
Second, the court finds that
9th Street has not shown that it may enforce the waiver provision of the
settlement agreement entered into by and between Plaintiff and Amtech.  
The court acknowledges that
the “General Release and Settlement Agreement” between Plaintiff and Amtech (1)
states that the parties “will each pay their own costs, attorney fees, and
expenses with respect to the ACTION[,]” and (2) defines “ACTION” to be
Plaintiff’s Second Amended Complaint, Howard’s cross-action, and 9th Street’s
cross-action.  (River Decl., Ex. K, pp.
3, 1.)  However, the settlement agreement
was entered into by and between Plaintiff and Amtech.  (Id. at p. 1.)  9th Street has not presented evidence or argument
establishing that it—a nonsignatory and nonparty—may enforce the terms of the settlement
agreement as a third-party beneficiary or pursuant to any other legal
doctrine.  9th Street, for example, did
not present evidence or argument establishing that a motivating purpose of
Plaintiff and Amtech was to benefit it, or whether permitting 9th Street to
enforce this provision is consistent with the objectives of their settlement
agreement, such that the court could find that 9th Street is permitted to enforce
the waiver of costs provision against Amtech. 
(Goonewardene v. ADP, LLC (2019) 6 Cal.5th 917, 829-830 [factors
to determine existence of a third-party beneficiary].) 
Third, the court grants 9th
Street’s request to tax $1,225.21 in costs.
The court finds that 9th
Street has met its burden to show that the following costs were not reasonably
necessary to the conduct of the litigation as to 9th Street’s Cross-Complaint
against Amtech: (1) $510.24 in costs incurred to file an answer to Howard’s
Cross-Complaint; (2) $37.95 in filing fees to file an opposition to Howard’s
motion to compel; (3) $37.95 in filing fees to file, on March 30, 2023,[1] a notice of entry of the
court’s order denying Howard’s motion; (4) $513.75 in fees to reserve a hearing
on a motion for summary judgment, which Amtech never filed; (5) $61.65 in fees for
“Good Faith Settlement” dated November 6, 2023, since Amtech     (i) did not file its motion for
determination of good faith settlement until December 8, 2023 and   (ii) appears to have also requested $37.95 in
filing costs for that motion on December 15, 2023; (6) $37.65 in filing fees to
file an opposition to Howard’s motion to compel on December 5, 2023; (7) $13.01
in filing fees to file a statement of non-opposition to Howard’s motion to
compel on December 5, 2023; and (8) $13.01 in filing fees to file a statement
of non-opposition to Howard’s motion to compel on December 5, 2023.  (MC-011, ¶ 1, subds. (a), (b), (d), (e), (f),
(g), (h), (i); Mar. 30, 2023 Notice of Entry of Order filed by Amtech
[providing notice that the court denied Howard’s motion to compel]; Kelly
Decl., ¶ 6; Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (c); Adams, supra,
199 Cal.App.4th at p. 1486.) 
The court finds that 9th
Street has not met its burden to show that the costs incurred in connection
with various depositions was not reasonably necessary to the conduct of this
litigation.  Although 9th Street asserts
that those depositions were taken by or of other parties, 9th Street has not
shown that Amtech’s costs in obtaining those deposition transcripts were not
reasonably necessary to the conduct of this litigation, and Amtech has asserted
that, in order to defend itself against 9th Street’s Cross-Complaint, it had to
attend and participate in various depositions. 
(Opp., p. 6:11-15; Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (c).) 
Further, as to the costs
incurred in mediation, the court has found, as set forth above in connection
with Howard’s motion to strike, that (1) the costs incurred in mediation were
reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation and are reasonable in
amount, and               (2) Amtech presented
evidence showing that it erroneously identified the incorrect mediation
provider, but supported its request for costs of the July 21, 2023
mediation.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 1033.5, subd. (c); Kelly Decl., Ex. C [Judicate West invoice for
$3,150].)
