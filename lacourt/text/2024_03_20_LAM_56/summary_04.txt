Summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge Holly J. Fujie regarding a motion for leave to amend cross-complaint filed by Defendant and Cross-Complainant Jeremy Daniels-Stock. The motion seeks to remove causes of action for Receivership and Involuntary Dissolution and add new evidentiary facts to existing claims. The Court has considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers and finds that Cross-Defendants would be prejudiced by allowing the amendment at this late stage in the case and so close to trial. The Court therefore DENIES the motion for leave to amend.
