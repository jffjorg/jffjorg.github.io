AND RELATED CROSS-ACTIONS










 
 

MOVING
PARTIES: Plaintiffs Dr. Payam Vahedifar and Shadi Vahedifar 
RESPONDING
PARTY: Defendants Bita Paya, Brian Paya and the Paya Family Trust (collectively,
“Responding Defendants”) 
 
The
Court has considered the moving, opposition and reply papers.
 
BACKGROUND
            This action arises out of a
landlord/tenant relationship. 
Plaintiffs’ complaint (the “Complaint”) alleges: (1) violation of Civil
Code section 1950.5; (2) statutory fraud or deceit and common law fraud; (3)
intentional misrepresentation; (4) negligent misrepresentation; (5) fraudulent
concealment; (6) negligence; (7) negligence per se; (8) conversion; (9) breach
of fiduciary duty; (10) breach of contract; (11) breach of the implied covenant
of good faith and fair dealing; (12) violation of Business and Professions Code
section 17200 et seq; (13) intentional infliction of emotional distress; (14)
negligent infliction of emotional distress; (15) unjust enrichment and
restitution; (16) intentional interference with contractual relations; and (17)
conspiracy to breach contract and to interfere with contractual relations.  
 
Plaintiffs
move to deem Requests for Admissions (“RFAs”), set one, admitted against Responding
Defendants.  Plaintiffs electronically served
the subject discovery separately on each of the three Responding Defendants on
June 29, 2023. Responses were due no later than August 1, 2023 pursuant to CCP
§ 2031.010.  Responding Defendants failed
to timely serve their responses and did not request an extension.  Responding Defendants responded on September
21, 2023, denying each request on the ground that they lacked sufficient
information.  
 
DISCUSSION
If a party fails to provide a timely
response to an RFA, the party waives any objection to the requests. 
(C.C.P. § 2033.280(a).)  Moreover, “[t]he requesting party may move for an
order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters
specified in the requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary
sanction. . . .”  (C.C.P. § 2033.280(b).) 
 
            Defendants argue in
opposition that the proper legal mechanism here is a motion to compel further
responses, not a motion to deem admitted, because Defendants served responses
to the RFAs.  The Court
agrees; therefore, the Motions are DENIED.
 
 
 
Monetary Sanctions
Plaintiffs
seek sanctions in the amount of $2,184.95.  Sanctions are mandatory under CCP § 2033.280,
but the amount must be reasonable.  Here,
Plaintiffs’ counsel seeks sanctions to compensate him for 4 hours at an hourly
rate of $500.00 plus a $60.00 filing fee and $1.65 handling fee for each of the
three motions.  The Court finds counsel’s
request excessive and awards sanctions of $1,184.95 instead, corresponding to
two hours of attorney time plus applicable costs.  The request for sanctions is therefore GRANTED
in part.
 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
 
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at
SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed by the instructions provided on the court
website at www.lacourt.org.  If the
department does not receive an email and there are no appearances at the
hearing, the motion will be placed off calendar.
