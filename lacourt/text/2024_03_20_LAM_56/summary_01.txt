English-text summary:

The court has considered the motion for summary judgment filed by Chevron Corporation, which seeks to dismiss the negligence claim brought by SSI Refrigerated Express, Inc. against Utility Trailer Manufacturing Company and Chevron Corporation. The claim arises from the mislabeling of a drum of hydraulic oil as motor oil, which was used by SSI Refrigerated Express, Inc. and resulted in damage to their semi-fleet.

The court finds that Chevron Corporation has not met its initial burden of showing that there is no triable issue of material fact and that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. The court notes that Chevron Corporation has failed to explain the relevance of certain documents and has not pointed out the relevant portions of those documents. The court also finds that the responses provided by SSI Refrigerated Express, Inc. in discovery do not show that they have no evidence.

Therefore, the court denies the motion for summary judgment. The parties are ordered to give notice of this ruling, and the court will review any further submissions before making a final decision.
