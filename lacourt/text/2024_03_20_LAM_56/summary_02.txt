And here is the summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling is regarding a motion to deem Requests for Admissions (RFAs) admitted against the responding defendants. The plaintiffs, Dr. Payam Vahedifar and Shadi Vahedifar, served the RFAs on June 29, 2023, and the responding defendants, Bita Paya, Brian Paya, and the Paya Family Trust, failed to timely serve their responses. The plaintiffs are seeking to deem the RFAs admitted and are also seeking sanctions in the amount of $2,184.95. The judge agrees with the defendants that the proper legal mechanism is a motion to compel further responses, not a motion to deem admitted, and therefore denies the motion. The judge also awards sanctions in the amount of $1,184.95, corresponding to two hours of attorney time plus applicable costs.
