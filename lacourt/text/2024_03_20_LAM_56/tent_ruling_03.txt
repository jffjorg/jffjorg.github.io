BACKGROUND
            This is an unlawful detainer action.
On November 1, 2023, judgment was entered by the Court after trial in favor of
Plaintiff and against Defendant Ted J. Suh (“Defendant”) in the amount of
$85,214.14, consisting of $34,100 in past-due rent, $39,576.59 in holdover
damages, $10,516 in attorneys’ fees, and $1,021.55 in costs. 
 


 
DISCUSSION
            Plaintiff moves for
attorneys’ fees in the amount of $10,516 as the prevailing party to litigation
related to enforcement of a contract providing for fees. 
 
The Court DENIES the motion as moot. As stated above, the November 1,
2023 judgment of $85,214.14 already includes $10,516 in attorney fees. 
 
Moving party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
 
 
Parties who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to
the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed by the instructions provided on
