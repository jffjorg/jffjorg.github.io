MOTION TO STRIKE

Los Angeles Superior Court
Case # 23BBCV00195




 
MP:  


 
Janina Mariduena and
  Luis Rodriguez, Defendants




RP:  


Adrian Reyes,
  Plaintiff



 
ALLEGATIONS: 
 
On January
27, 2023, Adrian Reyes (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Antonella R.
Mariduena (“Defendant”) and Does 1-50 (collectively “Defendants”) asserting the
following causes of action: (1) breach of lease; (2) violation of Los Angeles
Municipal §
49.99.2; (3) tortious breach of warranty of habitability; (4) breach of the
covenant of quiet enjoyment; (5) negligence; (6) violation of the Los Angeles
Rent Stabilization Ordinance; (7) nuisance; (8) violation of the California
Business and Professions Code § 17200 et seq.; (9) violation of Los Angeles
Municipal Code § 45.33; (10) retaliatory eviction; and (11) harassment &
unlawful intimidation – California Civil Code § 1940.2. 
 
The Complaint alleges the following, among other things. Plaintiff and Defendant have been in a landlord-tenant
relationship since 2017. Plaintiff asserts that Defendant breached the lease
by, failing to properly maintain the Property, failing to provide habitable
premises, and allowing unsafe conditions to exist at the Property. In addition,
the Defendants retaliated against Plaintiff by filing two frivolous unlawful
detainer lawsuits in retaliation for him exercising his rights as a tenant. 
  
HISTORY: 
 
On May 12, 2023, Plaintiff amended his Complaint to substitute Defendants
Janina Mariduena and Luis Rodriguez (collectively, “Defendants”) for the
defendants sued fictitiously as Does 1 and 2, respectively. 
 
On
October 5, 2023, Defendants filed the instant motion, seeking an order striking
portions of the Complaint as a Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation (“SLAPP”).
Defendants argue those portions arise from their right to petition. 
 
On January
16, 2024, Plaintiff filed his opposition. 
 
On
January 22, 2024, Defendants filed their objection to the opposition, arguing
the opposition was untimely. The hearing for the motion was initially set for
January 26, 2024, but on January 24, 2024, the Court continued the hearing to
its current date, March 1, 2024.
 
On
January 24, 2024, Plaintiff filed a supplemental request for judicial notice in
support of his opposition to the motion.

 
ANALYSIS:
 
I.                  
REQUESTS
FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE
 
On
January 16, 2024, Plaintiff filed a request for judicial notice of the
following:
 
·        
Exhibit
A: Los Angeles Housing Department determination letter in re applicability of
the Los Angeles Rent Stabilization Ordinance to the property at 7641 Tujunga
Ave, North Hollywood, CA 91605.
·        
Exhibit
B: Complaint filed in Los Angeles Superior Court (“LASC”) Case Number
22VEUD01233.
·        
Exhibit
C: Complaint filed in LASC Case Number 22VEUD01937.
·        
Exhibit
D: January 23, 2023 Order granting Plaintiff’s motion for judgment on the
pleadings in re LASC Case Number 22VEUD01937.
·        
Exhibit
E: County of Los Angeles Ordinance No. 196585 effective on 3/31/20.
·        
Exhibit
F: County of Los Angeles Ordinance No. 196606 effective on 5/12/20.
·        
Exhibit
G: County of Los Angeles Resolution dated January 25, 2022.
·        
Exhibit
H: Los Angeles County Department of Consumer & Business Affairs document
dated April 11, 2022.
·        
Exhibit
I: City of Los Angeles Resolution dated January 24, 2023.
 
The Court
grants the unopposed requests for judicial notice. (See Evidence Code § 452(c) and (d) [allowing
courts to take judicial notice of official acts of the legislature and court
records]; Crawley v. Alameda County Waste Management Authority (2015)
243 Cal.App.4th 396, 401, fn. 2 [granting the Alameda County Waste Management Authority’s
unopposed request for judicial notice of its notice to property owners because
the notice was an official act under Evidence Code section 452(c)].)
 
 
On
January 24, 2024, Plaintiff filed and served a supplemental request for
judicial notice, seeking judicial notice of the following documents. 
 
·        
Exhibit J:
Minute Order dated January 19, 2024, granting Plaintiff’s motion for summary
judgment in unlawful detainer Case Number 23PDUD03028
·        
Exhibit K:
Order dated January 22, 2024, granting the motion for summary judgment in the
same case mentioned above (23PDUD03028)
 
The Court denies the request for judicial notice of those
documents in Case Number 23PDUD03028 because that case is irrelevant for the
purposes of this motion. (See AL Holding Co. v. O’Brien & Hicks, Inc.
(1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 1310, 1313, fn. 2 [“a court must decline to take judicial
notice of material that is not relevant …”].) Here, 23PDUD03028 is not
mentioned in the Complaint, and the instant motion challenges Paragraphs 21 and
60, which only mention Van Nuys Superior Court Case Numbers 22VEUD01233 and 22VEUD019327.
 
 
II.               
EVIDENTIARY

·        
Objection
to the declaration of Janina Mariduena: OVERRULED. 
·        
Objection
to the declaration of Luis Rodriguez: OVERRULED. 
 
III.            
LEGAL
STANDARD 
 
“An
anti-SLAPP motion ‘requires the court to engage in a two-step process. First,
the court decides whether the defendant has made a threshold showing that the
challenged cause of action is one arising from protected activity… If the
court finds that such a showing has been made, it then determines whether the
plaintiff has demonstrated a probability of prevailing on the claim.’ ‘Under
section 425.16, subdivision (b)(2), the trial court in making these
determinations considers ‘the pleadings, and supporting and opposing affidavits
stating the facts upon which the liability or defense is based.’” Premier Medical Management Systems, Inc. v.
California Insurance Guarantee Association (2006) 136 Cal.App.4th 464, 472
(Citations Omitted).)
 
“Resolution
of an anti-SLAPP motion involves two steps. First, the defendant must establish
that the challenged claim arises from activity protected by section
425.16. [Citation.] If the defendant makes the required showing, the burden
shifts to the plaintiff to demonstrate the merit of the claim by establishing a
probability of success. We have described this second step as a ‘summary-judgment-like
procedure.’ [Citation.] The court does not weigh evidence or resolve
conflicting factual claims. Its inquiry is limited to whether the plaintiff has
stated a legally sufficient claim and made a prima facie factual
showing sufficient to sustain a favorable judgment. It accepts the plaintiff’s
evidence as true, and evaluates the defendant’s showing only to determine if it
defeats the plaintiff’s claim as a matter of law.” (Baral v. Schnitt (2016)
1 Cal.5th 375, 384-85 (Baral).) As to the second step inquiry, a
plaintiff seeking to demonstrate the merit of the claim “may not rely solely on
its complaint, even if verified; instead, its proof must be made upon competent
admissible evidence.” (Sweetwater Union High School Dist. v. Gilbane
Building Co. (2019) 6 Cal.5th 931.)
“[S]ection
425.16 provides no mechanism for granting anti-SLAPP motions with leave to
amend.” (Martin v. Inland Empire Utilities Agency (2011) 198 Cal.App.4th
611, 629 [italics removed].)
 
IV.            
MERITS 
 
As an
initial matter, Defendants object to Plaintiff’s opposition, arguing that it
was untimely filed and served.
 
The Court
exercises its discretion to consider the late-filed papers. (Cal. Rules of
Court, Rule 3.1300(d) [“No paper may be rejected for filing on the ground that
it was untimely submitted for filing. If the court, in its discretion, refuses
to consider a late-filed paper, the minutes or order must so indicate”].)
Prong 1: Arising
from Protected Activity 
 
“A cause
of action is subject to a special motion to strike if the defendant shows that
the cause of action arises from an act in furtherance of the defendant’s
constitutional right of petition or free speech in connection with a public
issue and the plaintiff fails to demonstrate a probability of prevailing on the
claim.” (Digerati Holdings, LLC v. Young
Money Entertainment, LLC (2011) 194 Cal.App.4th 873, 883 [citations omitted]
(“Digerati”).)
 
“An ‘act
in furtherance of a person’s right of petition or free speech under the United
States or California Constitution in connection with a public issue’ is defined
by statute to include ‘(1) any written or oral statement or writing made before
a legislative, executive, or judicial proceeding, or any other official
proceeding authorized by law, (2) any written or oral statement or writing made
in connection with an issue under consideration or review by a legislative,
executive, or judicial body, or any other official proceeding authorized by
law, (3) any written or oral statement or writing made in a place open to the
public or a public forum in connection with an issue of public interest, or (4)
any other conduct in furtherance of the exercise of the constitutional right of
petition or the constitutional right of free speech in connection with a public
issue or an issue of public interest.’ If the defendant shows that the cause of
action arises from a statement described in clause
(1) or (2) of section 425.16, subdivision (e), the defendant is not required to separately demonstrate
that the statement was made in connection with a ‘public issue.’” (Digerati, supra, 194 Cal.App.4th at
p. 883 [citations omitted].)
 
“A
cause of action is one ‘arising from’ protected activity within the meaning of section 425.16, subdivision (b)(1)
only if the defendant’s act on which the cause of action is based was an act in
furtherance of the defendant’s constitutional right of petition or free speech
in connection with a public issue. In deciding whether the ‘arising from’ requirement is satisfied,
‘the court shall consider the pleadings, and supporting and opposing affidavits
stating the facts upon which the liability or defense is based.’ Whether the ‘arising
from’ requirement is satisfied depends on the ‘gravamen or principal thrust’ of
the claim. A cause of action does not arise from protected activity for
purposes of the anti-SLAPP statute if the protected activity is merely
incidental to the cause of action.” (Digerati,
supra, 194 Cal.App.4th at pp. 883-884 [emphasis added; citations omitted].)

 
“An
anti-SLAPP motion need not be directed at a cause of action in its entirety,
but ‘may be used to attack parts of a count as pleaded.’ [Citation.] Thus, when
a cause of action is supported by allegations of both protected and unprotected
activity, the anti-SLAPP statute applies to the former but does not reach the
latter.” (Symmonds v. Mahoney (2019) 31 Cal.App.5th 1096, 1104.)
 
Here,
Defendants move to strike the Complaint’s second cause of action for violation
of Los Angeles Municipal Code § 49.99.2 in its entirety (or, alternatively, portions of
Paragraph 21 under that claim) and Paragraph 60(c), which is under the ninth
cause of action for violation of Los Angeles Municipal Code § 45.33. 
 
Defendants argue that those
portions of the Complaint should be stricken because they arise from Defendants
serving termination notices on Plaintiff and allegedly instituting an unlawful
detainer action on Plaintiff, which are protected activities. 
 
“The filing of an unlawful
detainer complaint is anti-SLAPP protected activity, as is service of a notice
of termination preceding an unlawful detainer complaint.” (Winslett v. 1811
27th Avenue, LLC (2018) 26 Cal.App.5th 239, 248.) 
 
Here, the Court agrees that
Paragraphs 21(b), (c), (d), (e), and (f) in the Complaint arise from protected
activity, and none of the arguments Plaintiff raises in his opposition are
persuasive. In those paragraphs, Plaintiff clearly alleges that the defendants
violated Los Angeles Municipal Code § 49.99.2 by serving him with eviction notices and filing two unlawful
detainer proceedings (Case Numbers 22VEUD01233 and 22VEUD01937) without
complying with various ordinances. In those paragraphs, Plaintiff is not
alleging only statutory violations as he argues in his opposition. He is
seeking to hold the Defendants liable for serving him with eviction notices and
filing unlawful detainer actions against him. Those are protected activities. 
 
The Court also agrees Paragraph
60(c) allegations arise from protected activity. In that paragraph, Plaintiff
alleges that Defendants violated Los Angeles Municipal Code § 45.33 by “[t]hreatening or
taking action to terminate any tenancy including service of any notice to quit
or other eviction notice or bringing action to recover possession of a rental
unit based on facts which the landlord has no reasonable cause to believe to be
true.” Since the only examples Plaintiff gives of Defendants allegedly “threatening
or taking action” to terminate his tenancy are Defendants (1) serving him with
eviction notices and (2) filing an unlawful detainer action against him, the
Court finds the allegations in Paragraph 60(c) also fall under the anti-SLAPP
statute because, as stated above, serving an eviction notice and filing an
unlawful detainer action are protected activities. 
 
Notwithstanding the above findings,
Defendants have failed to meet their burden of showing why Paragraph 21 should
be stricken in its entirety when it is based on some unprotected conduct. For
example, Paragraph 21(a) alleges that the Defendants violated Los Angeles Municipal Code § 49.99.2 by failing “to comply with the initial Protections Notice of
the Anti-Eviction Ordinance ...,” and Paragraph 21(g) alleges that the
Defendants violated the municipal code by “[h]arassing Plaintiff on numerous
occasions between 2021 and up until the present.” Defendants have not shown how
those activities arise from their right to petition or other protected
activity. The Court finds that those paragraphs only allege statutory
violations of Los
Angeles Municipal Code § 49.99. 
 
For the reasons set forth above,
the Court finds that Defendants
have met their burden of establishing Paragraph 60(c) and Paragraph 21(b), (c),
(d), (e), and (f) arise from activity protected by Section 425.16.
However, Defendants have failed to meet their burden as to the rest of
Paragraph 21. 
 
Accordingly,
with regard to Paragraph
60(c) and Paragraph 21(b), (c), (d), (e), and (f), the burden shifts to the Plaintiff
to demonstrate the merit of his claims by establishing a probability of success.
 
Second
Prong: Probability of Prevailing 
 
Defendants argue that Plaintiff cannot prevail on her allegations
in Paragraph 60(c) and
Paragraph 21(b), (c), (d), (e), and (f) because of the litigation privilege. 
 
Plaintiff
does not address the litigation privilege argument in his opposition.
 
“The litigation privilege, codified at Civil Code section
47, subdivision (b), provides that a ‘publication or broadcast’ made as part of
a ‘judicial proceeding’ is privileged. This privilege is absolute in nature,
applying ‘to all publications, irrespective of their maliciousness.” (Silberg
v. Anderson (1990) 50 Cal.3d 205, 216.) “The usual formulation is that
the privilege applies to any communication (1) made in judicial or
quasi-judicial proceedings; (2) by litigants or other participants authorized
by law; (3) to achieve the objects of the litigation; and (4) that [has] some
connection or logical relation to the action.” (Id. at 212.) “The privilege ‘is not limited to
statements made during a trial or other proceedings, but may extend to steps
taken prior thereto, or afterwards.’ (Citation)” (Action Apartment Association,
Inc. v. City of Santa Monica (2007) 41 Cal.4th 1232, 1241.) “[T]he
privilege is ‘an “absolute” privilege, and it bars all tort causes of
action except a claim of malicious prosecution.’ (Citations)” (Hagberg
v. California Federal Bank (2004) 32 Cal.4th 350, 360.)
 
The Court
finds that the Defendants’ alleged acts of filing and refusing to dismiss the
unlawful detainer cases (22VEUD01233 and 22VEUD01937) fell
under the litigation privilege. (Compl., ¶ 21(d)-(f).)
 
Accordingly, since Plaintiff has not disputed Defendants’
litigation defense, the Court finds that he has failed to meet his burden of
showing a probability of prevailing on the merits as to his allegations in
Paragraph 21, subsections (d) through (f).
 
With
regard to the allegations that Defendant served Plaintiff with eviction notices
in bad faith, “[a]
notice of eviction is a communication regarding prospective litigation, and, as
such, it is not necessarily part of a judicial proceeding.” (Action
Apartment Assn., Inc. v. City of Santa Monica (2007) 41 Cal.4th 1232, 1250 (“Action
Apartment”).)
 
Therefore,
“courts have developed a test for determining when a communication regarding
prospective litigation is subject to the litigation privilege.” (Action
Apartment Assn., supra, 41 Cal.4th at p. 1251.)
 
“A prelitigation communication is privileged only when it
relates to litigation that is contemplated in good faith and under serious
consideration.” (Action
Apartment Assn., supra,
41 Cal.4th at p. 1251.)
 
Here, the Complaint alleges that Defendants served
Plaintiff with eviction notices in bad faith. (Compl., ¶¶ 21(b)-(c), 60(c).) 
 
“During the second prong of a court’s anti-SLAPP
analysis, a defendant bears the burden of proving a privilege’s applicability.”
(Neurelis, Inc. v. Aquestive Therapeutics, Inc. (2021) 71 Cal.App.5th
769, 794.)
 
To prove that Plaintiff’s allegations that they never
served him with eviction notices in bad faith, Defendants submit their
declarations in which they testify that at no time has Defendant Antonella R.
Mariduena been their agent or employee, and at no time have they (1) been in a
landlord-tenant relationship with Plaintiff, (2) owned the Property, or (3) been
agents or employees of Defendant Antonella R. Mariduena. (Motions, declarations
of Janina Mariduena and Luis Rodriguez, ¶ 4.) Defendant Luis Rodriguez adds: “At
no time have I ever served, or otherwise caused to be serve any notice relating
to any tenancy of Plaintiff at any portion of said premises, and at no time has
any notice been served by anyone without contemplation of institution of filing
an unlawful detainer action upon defendants.” (Motion, Rodriguez Decl., ¶ 4.)
 
In opposition, Plaintiff argues that Antonella R.
Mariduena testified at her deposition that Defendants are her agents and
property managers for the property. (Opposition, pp. 5:22-6:2 [citing “Plt Depo, 19:18-20:4, 36:5-14”].)
 
However, the Court has not
found the evidence Plaintiff cites in support of that argument in the papers he
has submitted with his opposition. Most importantly, showing that Defendants
were agents of Defendant Antonella R. Mariduena is not enough to establish that
(1) Defendants, in fact, served Plaintiff with eviction notices and (2) that
they served those eviction notices in bad faith. 
 
Accordingly, since
Defendants have disputed having any landlord-tenant relationship with Plaintiff
and there is no evidence they served any eviction notices to Plaintiff in bad
faith, the Court finds that Defendants have established the litigation privilege
applies to the eviction notices allegations in Paragraphs 21(b) to (c) and 60(c).
 
Notwithstanding the above
findings, in his opposition, Plaintiff also points to the fact that he obtained
favorable terminations in Case Numbers 22VEUD01233 (because the defendant in
that case dismissed it) and 22VEUD01937 (because Plaintiff prevailed in a
motion for judgment on the pleadings) to imply that he has also shown a
probability of prevailing in his allegations in Paragraphs 21 and 60(c) against the moving defendants.
 
However, the Court has
taken judicial notice of those cases and notes that Defendants (i.e., the ones
bringing this motion) are not named anywhere in those lawsuits. 
 
For the
reasons set forth above, the Court finds that Plaintiff has failed to meet his
burden of establishing a probability of succeeding in his allegations in
Paragraphs 60(c) and 21(b)(f). 
 
Attorney’s
Fees and Costs 
 
“‘In any
action subject to [the special motion to strike], a prevailing defendant ...
shall be entitled to recover his or her attorney’s fees and costs. If the court
finds that a special motion to strike is frivolous or is solely intended to
cause unnecessary delay, the court shall award costs and reasonable attorney’s
fees to a plaintiff prevailing on the motion, pursuant to [Code of Civil
Procedure] [s]ection 128.5.’ (Code Civ. Proc., § 425.16, subd. (c).)” (Ketchum
v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1131.) “Thus, under Code of Civil
Procedure section 425.16, subdivision (c), any SLAPP defendant who brings a
successful motion to strike is entitled to mandatory attorney fees.” (Ibid.)
 
However, “because
the anti-SLAPP provisions refer to attorney fees and costs without indicating
any restrictions on how they are to be calculated, [the California Supreme
Court has] accordingly presume[d] that the Legislature intended courts use the
prevailing lodestar adjustment method.” (Ketchum, supra, 24
Cal.4th at p. 1136.)
 
“[A] court
assessing attorney fees begins with a touchstone or lodestar figure, based on
the ‘careful compilation of the time spent and reasonable hourly compensation
of each attorney ... involved in the presentation of the case.’ [Citation.]” (Ketchum,
supra, 24 Cal.4th at pp. 1131-1132.)
 
Here,
Defendants seeks attorney’s fees and costs of $3,660, consisting of 5 hours
defense counsel spent on the moving papers, 2 hours they anticipated spending
on the reply, and 1 hour they anticipated spending at the hearing, a total of 8
hours at counsel’s billing rate of $450 per hour (equals $3,600), plus a $60
filing fee. (Motion, Declaration of H.G. Long, ¶ 6.)
 
However, “only those fees and costs incurred in
connection with the portion of the anti-SLAPP motion that is granted may be
recovered.” (Richmond Compassionate Care Collective v. 7 Stars Holistic
Foundation (2019) 33 Cal.App.5th 38, 45.)
 
Here, the Court has found that the Defendants failed to
meet their burden under the first prong with regard to Paragraph 21(a) in their
Complaint. 
 
Accordingly, Defendants’ request for attorney’s fees and costs is GRANTED, but
in the reduced amount of $2,760, representing 6 hours of defense counsel’s time
at their billing rate of $450 per hour, plus a $60 filing fee.
