MOVING PARTY: Petitioner Bill Me Later, Inc.
(“Petitioner”)
RESPONDING PARTY: Respondents Elevate Beauty
Medspa; and Medik Abramyan (collectively, “Respondents”)
NOTICE: OK
 
RELIEF REQUESTED: Entry of judgment against
Respondents, and an order (1) confirming the arbitration award in favor of
Petitioner titled Award of Arbitrator and dated December 1, 2023, and (2) and
awarding petitioner interest on the amount of the award at the legal rate from
January 1, 2024, and Petitioner’s costs in this proceeding.
 
TENTATIVE RULING: The unopposed petition is granted.
 
BACKGROUND
 
This is a collections action in
which Petitioner alleges that on 8/10/22, it extended a loan to respondent
Elevate Beauty Medspa, guaranteed by respondent Medik Abramyan. Thereafter,
Respondents defaulted on the loan and failed to make any outstanding payments.
On 10/17/23, the parties conducted an arbitration of the instant claims,
pursuant to a written agreement. On 12/1/23, the arbitrator found in favor of
petitioner and issued a final arbitration award in the amount of $115,124.72.
 
On 3/20/24, Petitioner filed the instant petition to confirm
the arbitration award. No opposition has been filed to date.
¿ 
ANALYSIS
 
“Any party to an arbitration in
which an award has been made may petition the court to confirm, correct or
vacate the award.” (Code Civ. Proc. §
1285.) “If a petition or response under this chapter is duly served and filed,
the court shall confirm the award as made, whether rendered in this state or
another state, unless in accordance with this chapter it corrects the award and
confirms it as corrected, vacates the award or dismisses the proceedings.”
(Code Civ. Proc. §
1286.) “If an award is confirmed, judgment shall be entered in conformity
therewith.” (Code Civ. Proc. §
1287.4.)
 
Here, the Court notes that the
instant petition is unopposed. The Court also notes that Petitioner has filed
four separate proofs of service indicating service of the instant petition and
accompanying papers on Respondents as follows:
·        
4/20/24 substituted service on Medik Abramyan
(4/22/24 POS);
·        
4/22/24 service on Medik Abramyan by U.S. mail
(4/22/24 POS);
·        
4/29/24 personal service on Elevate Beauty
Medspa (5/3/24 POS); and
·        
5/8/24 personal service on Elevate Beauty Medspa
(5/10/24 POS).
 
Based on the foregoing, the Court confirms the arbitration
award and enters judgment thereon.
 
CONCLUSION
 
The unopposed petition is granted.
