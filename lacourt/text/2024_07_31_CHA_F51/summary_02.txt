The judge has made a tentative ruling on the petition to confirm the arbitration award. The petition was filed by Bill Me Later, Inc. (the Petitioner) against Elevate Beauty Medspa and Medik Abramyan (the Respondents) on March 20, 2024. The Petitioner alleges that it extended a loan to the Respondents, which was guaranteed by Medik Abramyan, but the Respondents defaulted on the loan and failed to make any outstanding payments. The parties conducted an arbitration on October 17, 2023, and the arbitrator issued a final arbitration award in favor of the Petitioner on December 1, 2023, in the amount of $115,124.72.

The Petitioner has filed the instant petition to confirm the arbitration award, and no opposition has been filed to date. The judge notes that the petition is unopposed and that the Petitioner has filed four separate proofs of service indicating service of the petition and accompanying papers on the Respondents.

Based on the foregoing, the judge confirms the arbitration award and enters judgment thereon.
