And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by the court regarding a motion to seal exhibits A, B, E, and J filed by non-party Alexander J. Davis. The exhibits are attached to defendants' motion in limine No. 4 and opposition to plaintiff's motion in limine Nos. 10-11. The court finds that there is an overriding interest in sealing the exhibits, as they contain confidential and sensitive information about the finances and business practices of Davis and his investors and business partners. The court also determines that the proposed sealing is narrowly tailored and that no less restrictive means exist to achieve this overriding interest. Therefore, the motion to seal is granted.

The exhibits at issue were previously filed in the public record by parties in this action, but the court finds that they should be sealed to protect the confidential and sensitive information they contain. The court held a hearing and made express findings in support of its decision to grant the motion to seal.
