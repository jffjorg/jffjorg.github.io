Background
Pleadings
Pursuant to a December 6, 2023
Complaint, Plaintiff Rafael Davila Madrigal, aka Rafael Davila, individually
and doing business as 4 Wheel Auto Dismantler, and dba 4 Wheel Truck & Van
Dismantlers (Davila Madrigal), and Alicia Brisila Davila (Brisila Davila)—both
in pro per (collectively, the Davila Parties)—sue Defendants Union Mutualista
De San Jose (Union Mutualista), Paulino Lopez (Lopez) as President of Union
Mutualista, Rafael Barraza as President of Union Mutualista (Barraza), and Does
1 through 20.
(The Court refers to Plaintiffs
Davila Madrigal and Brisila Davila as the “Davila Parties” for ease of
reference where the parties stand both as plaintiffs and defendants, and where
the Plaintiffs in the lead action share this surname.)
The Complaint alleges claims of (1)
Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress (IIED) and (2) Breach of Unfair
Business Practices Act, § 17200.
The claims arise from allegations
that the Davila Parties leased commercial premises from Defendants for the
purpose of operating a car dismantling business and that Defendants engaged in
conduct amounting to IIED and unfair business practices by: (1) increasing the
Davila Parties’ monthly rent from $2,000 to $2,500 and then from $2,500 to
$5,000 per month, with the dates of those increases not specifically alleged,
for the purpose of vacating the property quickly for sale; and (2) demanding
that the Davila Parties vacate the premises with only a month’s notice despite
being on notice that the Davila Parties needed more time to remove heavy
equipment from the premises, including the relocating of the Davila Parties’ car
parts, heavy machinery, containers, recycling equipment and machinery,
multi-dismantling machinery and equipment, vehicles, trucks, and car rim
crushers, etc.
Related Cases
On December 28, 2023, the Davila
Parties—in pro per—filed a notice of related case identifying 23LBUD02282, Union
Mutualista De San Jose v. Davila Madrigal, et al. (the Unlawful Detainer or
UD Action), and 23STCV29782, Davila Madrigal, et al. v. Union Mutualista De
San Jose, et al. (this, the Civil Action) as related cases.
On January 4, 2024, Department S13
of the South District, Deukmejian Court, granted a motion for summary
adjudication filed by Union Mutualista in relation to the second cause of
action in the UD Action.
On January 12, 2024, the Court
related all three actions, made the Civil Action the lead case, and assigned the
two actions to this Court for all purposes.
On January 30, 2024, Union
Mutualista filed a demurrer in the Civil Action.
On February 15, 2024, Union
Mutualista filed an ex parte application seeking entry of judgment in the UD
Action following its successful motion for summary adjudication.
On February 20, 2024, the Court
entered the proposed judgment in the UD Action.
Motion Before the Court
On December 28, 2023, the Davila
Parties also filed a motion to consolidate the Civil Action with the UD Action.
On February 2, 2024—after summary
adjudication was granted in the UD Action on January 4, 2024, but before the UD
judgment on February 20, 2024—Union Mutualista opposed the motion to
consolidate and filed a request for judicial notice.
No reply appears in the record.
The Davila Parties’ motion is now
before the Court.
 
Request
for Judicial Notice
Per Union Mutualista’s request, the
Court takes judicial notice of the Department S13 January 4, 2024 summary
adjudication minutes, the January 8, 2024 proposed order relating to that
motion, and a copy of Union Mutualista’s demurrer in the Civil Action, filed
January 30, 2024. (Opp’n, RJN, Exs. 1-3.)
 
Motion to Consolidate
Legal
Standard
When
cases involving a common question of law or fact are pending in the same
superior court, i.e., in the same county, the cases can be consolidated on a
party’s motion or on the court’s own motion under Code of Civil Procedure
section 1048, subdivision (a).
Cases
can be consolidated for (1) all purposes (Hamilton v. Asbestos Corp.
(200) 22 Cal.4th 1127, 1147; see Code Civ. Proc., § 1048, subd. (a)), (2) for
trial (Stubblefield Constr. Co. v. City of San Bernardino (1995) 32
Cal.App.4th 687, 701; see Code Civ. Proc., § 1048, subd. (a)), or (3) for
limited purposes, e.g., discovery or pretrial matters (see Code Civ. Proc., §
1048, subd. (a); see, e.g., State v. Altus Fin., S.A. (2005) 36 Cal.4th
1284, 1293 [cases consolidated for discovery and pretrial matters]; Austin
B. v. Escondido Un. Sch. Dist. (2007) 149 Cal.App.4th 860, 870 [cases
consolidated for discovery and trial]; Frieman v. San Rafael Rock Quarry,
Inc. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 29, 33 [cases consolidated for discovery and
pretrial determinations]).
To
prevail on a motion to consolidate, a movant must establish that (1) the cases
are pending before the same court, (2) the cases share a common question of law
or fact, and (3) the benefits of consolidation outweigh the burdens. (See Code
Civ. Proc., § 1048, subd. (a).)
Order
Consolidating Actions: MOOT.
Here,
the UD Action and Civil Action are pending before the same Court (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1048, subd. (a)) and have been related, as required by the Local Rules
prior to consolidation (Super. Ct. L.A. County, Local Rules, rule 3.3, subd.
(g)(1)).
However,
the moving papers and the opposition were filed prior to judgment in the UD
Action springing from Union Mutualista’s successful summary adjudication
motion, which has effectively mooted the thrust of the arguments there. (See
Mot., pp. 7-8 [convenience and judicial economy in consolidating cases for
discovery and trial, thus saving on costs for court reporters, appearances,
witness costs, and transcript costs]; cf. 1/4/24 23LBUD02282 Minutes [summary
adjudication]; 2/20/24 Judgment; see also Opp’n, pp. 4-5 [need for precedence
of the UD Action over the Civil Action], 5-6 [cf. consolidation runs afoul of
rule of consolidating UD actions with other proceedings, and demurrer will
dispose of Civil Action].)
No
reply appears in the record.
The
Court determines that the UD judgment has mooted a determination on
consolidation insofar as there is no need for joint discovery or trial
determinations. A res judicata effect flows from the UD judgment and can be
raised in challenges to the pleadings or evidence as applicable.
The
Davila Parties’ motion is thus MOOT. 

Conclusion
Plaintiffs Rafael Davila Madrigal and Alicia Brisila Davila’s Motion to
Consolidate is MOOT.
