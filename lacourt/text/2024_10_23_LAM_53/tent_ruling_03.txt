MOVING PARTY:                 Plaintiff Immigrant Rights
Defense Council, LLC    
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Unopposed
Motion to Deem Admissions Admitted and for Sanctions
The court
considered the moving papers filed in connection with this motion.  No opposition papers were filed. 
DISCUSSION
Plaintiff Immigrant Rights Defense Council, LLC (“Plaintiff”) moves
the court for an order (1) deeming admitted each Request for Admission served
on defendant Edward Lasseville (“Defendant”), and (2) awarding monetary
sanctions in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant in the amount of
$3,992.15.
First, as a threshold matter, the court notes that, on April 11, 2024,
Defendant filed a motion to quash service of summons and complaint in this
action, which the court denied on July 12, 2024.  (July 12, 2024 Order, p. 7:18-19.)  Thereafter, on July 23, 2024, Defendant filed
a document entitled “Specially Appearing to Notice a Filed Petition for Writ of
Mandamus Per Code Civ. Proc., § 418.10(c),” in which Defendant advised the
court that he filed a petition for writ of mandate with the Court of Appeal on
July 23, 2024.  (July 23, 2024 Notice, p. 1:12-14.)  On July 24,
2024, the Court of Appeal issued an order which denied the petition.
On October 9, 2024, Defendant filed a document entitled “Specially
Appearing to Notice the Court per Code Civ. Proc. § 418.10(c) of Election to
Exercise Federal Right to Petition for Certiorari; Declaration.”  (Oct. 9,
2024 Notice.)  In that notice, Defendant stated, inter alia, that
the California Supreme Court denied discretionary review of the Court of
Appeal’s denial of his writ of mandate. 
(Oct. 9, 2024 Notice, p. 1:11-14.) 
In his October 9, 2024 notice, Defendant also stated that (1) he “has
elected to pursue the federal right of petitioning for a writ of certiorari
before the United States Supreme Court[,]” and (2) “[i]t is [Defendant’s]
intention to file the petition for certiorari with the Supreme Court of the
United States before its last day of Dec. 31, 2024.”  (Oct. 9, 2024 Notice, pp. 1:14-17, 3:12-13.)  However, Defendant has not filed a notice with
the court representing that he has filed a petition with the Supreme Court of
the United States, or authority establishing that such a filing would operate
as a stay of this action as alleged against him or does not require him to
respond to discovery requests.  For
example, while the court acknowledges that section 418.10 provides that the
time for a defendant to file a responsive pleading is extended if the defendant
files a notice that he has petitioned for a writ of mandate, Defendant’s
petitions for writ of mandate have been denied, and Defendant has not filed
(and does not seek to file) a petition for writ of mandate with the Supreme
Court of the United States.  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 418.10, subd. (c).) 
 Thus, because the court denied
Defendant’s motion to quash service of summons, and because the Court of Appeal
and California Supreme Court denied Defendant’s petitions for writ of mandate,
the court finds that the court has jurisdiction over Defendant.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 410.50, subd. (a) [“the
court in which an action is pending has jurisdiction over a party from the time
summons is served on him as provided by Chapter 4 (commencing with Section
413.10)”].) 
Second, the court finds that Plaintiff has properly served Defendant
with this motion by mail at the address for Defendant stated in his motion to
quash service of summons filed on April 11, 2024, and Defendant’s notices filed
on July 23, 2024, and October 9, 2024.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 1013, subd. (a) [for service by mail, any notice or other paper
shall be “addressed to the person on whom it is to be served, at the office
address as last given by that person on any document filed in the cause and
served on the party making service by mail; otherwise at that party’s place of
residence”]; Mot., p. 9 [proof of service of moving papers on Defendant at 3110
Canal Point Road, Hacienda Heights, California, 91745]; Def. Mot. to Quash
filed April 11, 2024, p. 1:1-5 [listing Defendant’s address to be 3110 Canal
Point Road, Hacienda Heights, California, 91745]; Def. July 23, 2024 Notice, p.
1:1-4 [same]; Def. Oct. 9, 2024 Notice, p. 1:1-4 [same].) 
The court therefore rules on the merits of Plaintiff’s motion. 
If a party to whom requests for admission are directed fails to serve
a timely response, the court shall, upon motion by the propounding party, order
that the matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted unless the court
finds that the party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has
served substantially compliant responses before the hearing on the motion.¿
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subds. (b), (c).)¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
Plaintiff served Defendant with its Requests for Admission, Set One,
on June 26, 2024, by mail at the address for Defendant stated in his motion to
quash service of summons filed on April 11, 2024, and Defendant’s notices filed
on July 23, 2024, and October 9, 2024. 
(Medvei Decl., Ex. 1, p. 14 [proof of service of Requests for Admission,
Set One, on Defendant at 3110 Canal Point Rd., Hacienda Heights, California,
91745].)  Defendant did not serve timely
responses and had not served responses as of the date that Plaintiff filed this
motion.  (Medvei Decl., ¶ 5.)  Defendant has not filed opposition papers or
other evidence with the court establishing that he served, before the hearing
on this motion, proposed responses that are in substantial compliance with
section 2033.220.  The court therefore
grants Plaintiff’s motion.  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).) 
The court grants Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c) [“It
is mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose
failure to serve a timely responses to requests for admission necessitated this
motion”].)  The court finds that $860 ((2
hours x reasonable $400 hourly rate) + $60 filing fee) is a reasonable amount
of sanctions to impose against Defendant in connection with this motion.  (Medvei Decl., ¶ 6.) 
ORDER
            The court grants plaintiff Immigrant
Rights Defense Council, LLC’s motion to deem requests for admission admitted
and for sanctions as follows. 
            Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 2033.280, subdivision (b), the court orders that the truth of the
matters specified in plaintiff Immigrant Rights Defense Council, LLC’s Request
for Admissions, Set One, served on defendant Edward Lasseville on June 26, 2024,
is deemed admitted. 
            The court orders defendant Edward
Lasseville to pay monetary sanctions to plaintiff Immigrant Rights Defense
Council, LLC in the amount of $860 within 30 days of the date of service of
this order. 
            The court orders plaintiff Immigrant
Rights Defense Council, LLC to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
 
DATED:  October 23, 2024
