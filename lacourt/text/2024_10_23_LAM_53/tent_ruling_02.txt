Government Code section 12960 was amended effective January 1, 2020 to set
forth a three-year statute of limitations. 


[2] The
court notes that an adverse job assignment may constitute an adverse employment
action in some circumstances.  (Doe,
supra, 43 Cal.App.5th at p. 734.) 
However, Plaintiff’s allegations make clear that Plaintiff has based
this cause of action not on an adverse job assignment that affected the terms
of his employment, but rather on a job assignment that conflicted with his work
restrictions and accommodations.  (FAC ¶
61 [Plaintiff suffered the adverse employment action of “reassignment to job
posts in violation of his work restrictions”] [emphasis added].) 


[3] The
court does not rule on whether Defendant’s other accommodations were reasonable
since (1) such a ruling could not find that Defendant met its burden to show
that the cause of action, in its entirety, has no merit, and (2) summary
adjudication is proper only if it completely disposes of a cause of
action.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd.
(f)(1).)
