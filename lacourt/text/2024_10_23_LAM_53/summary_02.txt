And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge is considering a case where the Plaintiff claims to have suffered an adverse employment action due to a job reassignment that conflicted with their work restrictions and accommodations. The Judge notes that an adverse job assignment can be an adverse employment action in some cases, but the Plaintiff's claims are based on a job reassignment that conflicted with their work restrictions and accommodations, rather than affecting the terms of their employment. The Judge is not ruling on whether the Defendant's accommodations were reasonable, as this would not completely dispose of the cause of action. The Judge's tentative ruling is intended to guide the parties and the court before the next hearing.
