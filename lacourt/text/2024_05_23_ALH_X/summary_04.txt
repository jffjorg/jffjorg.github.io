```

And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to set aside the default judgment. The defendant claims he did not receive actual notice of the lawsuit, but the plaintiff's counsel claims that eight prior attempts to personally serve the defendant were unsuccessful. The defendant also claims that he was improperly noticed by publication, but the evidence suggests that he was evading service. The judge has denied the motion, citing the legal standard that a party may serve and file a notice of motion to set aside a default or default judgment if they did not receive actual notice of the lawsuit.
