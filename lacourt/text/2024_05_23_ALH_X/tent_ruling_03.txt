RELIEF
REQUESTED 
To compel Defendants Chung Huei Lin and Willy Ling’s (collectively,
“Defendants”) responses to Requests for Admissions, Set One and Form
Interrogatories, Set One. Plaintiff also seeks monetary sanctions in the amount
of $3,261.65 against Defendants. 
             
 
BACKGROUND
On
March 9, 2023, Plaintiff Chia Huey Lin (“Plaintiff”) filed the
Complaint against Defendants for quiet title. On May 26, 2024, Defendant Willy
Ling filed a Cross-Complaint against Plaintiff. 
 
On
January 30, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant improperly combined discovery motions.
As of May 6, 2024, Defendants have not filed an opposition. 
 
On
May 9, 2024, the Court granted the Motion to Compel Form
Interrogatories, Set One and continued to May 23, 2024, the Motion to Compel
Requests for Admissions, Set One. The Court also ordered defendant Willy
Ling "to respond to the RFAs with simple Yes or No responses within 10
days." (Minute Order 5/9/24.) As of May 21, 2024, it is unclear whether
defendant Willy Ling failed to respond to the RFAs per the Court’s order. 
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
The Requests for Admissions, Set One
are deemed admitted against Defendants. 
 
Sanctions are
denied because they were previously granted on May 9, 2024, and this would be
duplicative. 
 
Plaintiff is ordered to provide notice of this
ruling.  
 
LEGAL STANDARD
 
Where a party fails to timely respond to a request for
admission, the propounding party may move for an order that the genuineness of
any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the requests be deemed
admitted.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).)¿ The party who failed
to respond waives any objections to the demand, unless the court grants them
relief from the waiver, upon a showing that the party (1) has subsequently
served a substantially compliant response, and (2) that the party’s failure to
respond was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.¿ (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subds. (a)(1)-(2).)¿ The court shall grant a motion to
deem admitted requests for admissions, “unless it finds that the party to whom
the requests for admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on
the motion, a proposed response to the requests for admission that is in
substantial compliance with Section 2033.220.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280,
subd. (c).)¿ 
 
DISCUSSION
 
Requests for
Admissions, Set One 
 
Here, on
August 8, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel’s office served Form Interrogatories, Set
One on each of the Defendants in this action. (Lin Decl. ¶ 2; Ex. 1.) Plaintiff
provided multiple extensions per Defendants’ counsel’s requests. (Id. at
¶ 3.) On January 3, 2024, Defendant’s counsel served a motion to withdraw which
was granted on February 5, 2024.  To
date, Defendants have not responded to the discovery request. (Id. at ¶
4.) Defendants did not file an opposition. The Court also ordered defendant
Willy Ling "to respond to the RFAs with simple Yes or No responses within
10 days." (Minute Order 5/9/24.) As of May 21, 2024, it is unclear whether
defendant Willy Ling failed to respond to the RFAs per the Court’s order. Thus, if
Defendant Willy Ling and Chung Huei Ling did not respond to the RFAs, Plaintiff
is entitled to an order deeming the Requests for Admission, Set One, admitted
against Defendants. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280.)¿ 
 
Monetary Sanctions
 
Plaintiff requests monetary sanctions against Defendants,
jointly or severally in the amount of $3,261.65.  
 
Sanctions are
denied because they were previously granted on May 9, 2024, and this would be
duplicative. 
 
CONCLUSION
 
The Requests for Admissions, Set One
are deemed admitted against Defendants. 
 
Sanctions are
denied because they were previously granted on May 9, 2024, and this would be
duplicative. 
 
Plaintiff is ordered to provide notice of this
ruling.
