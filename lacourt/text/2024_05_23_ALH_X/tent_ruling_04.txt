RELIEF
REQUESTED 
             
            Defendant moves for
an order granting relief from the default judgment filed in this court on
November 21, 2023, and entered in this court on November 21, 2023, because he
was erroneously served by publication on November 3, 2023.
 
BACKGROUND
 
            This action
arises out of a motor vehicle accident which occurred on June 30, 2021. On
April 14, 2023, Plaintiff GERALD GATES (“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint for
negligence against Defendants Joseph Florentino Duarte, Florentino Duarte (collectively,
“Defendants”) and Does 1 through 25 alleging motor vehicle negligence and
general negligence. 
 
            On March
20, 2024, the Court entered default as to Joseph Florentino Duarte. 
 
            On April
11, 2024, Defendant Joseph Florentino Duarte filed the instant motion. 
 
            On May 10,
2024, Plaintiff filed his opposition. 
 
            As of May
21, 2024, no reply has been filed. 
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
Defendant’s motion to set aside
default is DENIED. 
 
 
LEGAL STANDARD
 
“When
service of a summons has not resulted in actual notice to a party in time to
defend the action and a default or default judgment has been entered against
him or her in the action, he or she may serve and file a notice of motion
to set aside the default or default
judgment and for leave to defend the action. The notice
of motion shall be served and filed within a reasonable time, but in no event
exceeding the earlier of: (i) two years after entry of a default judgment
against him or her; ¿or (ii) 180 days
after service on him or her of a
written notice that the default or
default judgment has been entered.” (Code Civ. Proc. section 473.5, subd. (a).)
 
DISCUSSION
 
            Defendant argues that the motion to set aside default should be granted because
he did not receive actual notice of the case since, he was improperly noticed
by publication. Defendant provides his declaration stating that he has always
resided at 622 East Shrode Ave, Duarte, CA 91010. (Duarte Decl. ¶¶ 4,8-9;
Vallejo Decl. ¶ 12.) He further attests that he never received notice of the
lawsuit or was not aware of any attempts to be served with the lawsuit any time
in May of 2023.(Id. at ¶ 5.) Moreover, Defendant claims that he did not
receive actual or formal notice of this lawsuit until March 29, 2024, when he was
informed by his insurance company that there was a default filed against him. (Id.
at ¶ 12.) In opposition, Plaintiff
submits the declaration of his counsel, Byron M. Purcell who declares that eight
prior attempts to personally serve Defendant at 622 East Shrode Ave, Duarte, CA
91010 were unsuccessful by two different process servers. (Purcell Decl. ¶¶
9,13.) Although Defendant claims he
did not receive actual notice, the eight separate service of process attempts
at varying times shows that publication was proper. For instance, the first
four service attempts took place on May 9, 14, 17, and 22, 2023 ranging from
7:21 pm, 8:32 am, 1:30 pm, and 7:45 pm. The second set of attempts took place
on August 24, 25, 27, and 28, 2023, ranging from 7:50 pm, 8:25 pm, 8:46 am, and
6:52 pm. Process servers stated that there was no access to the front door
because of unleashed dogs, locked gates, fenced yard, and no answer to calls.
(Vallejo Decl. ¶¶ 7, 10; Exs. B-C.) Moreover, Mr. Purcell
provides letters sent from December 5, 2023, to August 22, 2023, between
Mercury Insurance and Plaintiff’s counsel which shows that a copy was sent to
Defendant. (Purcell Decl. ¶ 17; Exs. H-I.) Therefore, the evidence suggests that
is more likely than not that Defendant was evading service. 
 
CONCLUSION
 
            Thus, Defendants’
motion to set aside default and default judgment is DENIED. 
 
            Moving Party
to give notice.
