And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

This tentative ruling addresses the motion to compel initial form interrogatories, set one, and requests for admissions, set one, as well as the request for monetary sanctions. The court finds that the requests for admissions, set one, are deemed admitted against the defendants. The court denies the request for monetary sanctions because they were previously granted on May 9, 2024, and would be duplicative. The court orders the plaintiff to provide notice of this ruling.
