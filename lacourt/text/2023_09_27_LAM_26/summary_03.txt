Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge is considering a motion to be relieved as counsel filed by Joseph B. Ollinger, the counsel for Harriet Farmer. The motion is based on Harriet Farmer's failure to cooperate with Ollinger, including her failure to respond to his attempts to contact her via phone, email, text message, and Facebook Messenger. Ollinger has been unable to verify Harriet Farmer's current address and has made numerous attempts to contact her, including visiting her residence and a mailbox store. The judge is inclined to grant the motion, but Ollinger must file a corrected proposed order that includes the client's last known address for service purposes, as well as all upcoming hearings set as of the date of the filing of the order. The proposed order must also identify all upcoming hearings and list the address of the Court in all items.
