  [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
defendant’s motion to tax costs
 



 
Procedural
Background
            On
December 23, 2019, Plaintiffs Maria Del Carmen Valdovinos Rosales and Christina
P. Alquisiras Valdovinos (jointly “Plaintiffs”) filed the instant action
arising out of their lease of a 2018 Kia Optima (“the Subject Vehicle”).  On July 10, 2020, Plaintiffs filed the
operative first amended complaint (“FAC”) against Kia Motors America, Inc.
(“Defendant”) asserting causes of action for (1) violation of the Song-Beverly
Act –  breach of express warranty; (2)
violation of the Song-Beverly Act – 
breach of implied warranty; (3) violation of the Song-Beverly Act
section 1793.2; (4) fraudulent inducement – 
concealment; and (5) fraudulent inducement – intentional
misrepresentation.  
            On
June 16, 2022, Plaintiffs filed a notice of settlement of the entire
action.  On December 29, 2022, Plaintiffs
filed a memorandum of costs.  On January
18, 2023, Defendant filed the instant motion to tax costs.  On September 13, 2023, Plaintiffs filed an
opposition.  On September 19, 2023, Defendant
filed a reply.
 
Legal Standard
“A prevailing party is entitled ‘as a
matter of right’ to recover costs in any action or proceeding unless a statute
expressly provides otherwise.”  (Segal
v. ASICS America Corp. (2022) 12 Cal.5th 651, 658.)  “Section 1033.5 sets forth the types of
expenses that are and are not allowable as costs under section 1032.
Specifically, subdivision (a) of section 1033.5 describes items that are ‘allowable
as costs,’ subdivision (b) describes items ‘not allowable as costs, except when
expressly authorized by law,’ and section 1033.5(c)(4) provides that ‘[i]tems
not mentioned in this section and items assessed upon application may be
allowed or denied in the court's discretion.’” 
(Ibid.)
For a cost to be recoverable, it must be
reasonably necessary to the litigation and reasonable in amount. (Perko’s Enterprises, Inc. v. RRNS Enterprises
(l992) 4 Cal.App.4th 238, 244.) If the items appearing in a cost bill appear to
be proper charges, the burden is on the party seeking to tax costs to show that
they were not reasonable or necessary. (Ladas
v. California State Automotive Assoc. (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 761,
773-74.)  On the other hand, if the items
are properly objected to, they are put in issue, and the burden of proof is on
the party claiming them as costs. (Id.)  
California Rule of Court, Rule 3.1700
requires that “[a]ny notice of motion to strike or to tax costs must be served
and filed 15 days after service of the cost memorandum. If the cost memorandum
was served by mail, the period is extended” by up to 20 days. (Cal. Rules of
Court, Rule 3.1700(b)(1).) Additionally, “[T]he court may extend the times for
serving and filing the cost memorandum or the notice of motion or tax costs for
a period not to exceed 30 days.” (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1700(b)(3).)  
 
Discussion
            Defendant
seeks to tax a total of $26,982.28 in costs as follows (1) $588.75 in filing
and motion fees, claimed under Item 1; (2) $7,366.54 in deposition costs,
claimed under Item 4; (3) $690.25 in service of process costs, claimed under
Item 5; (4) $105.00 in ordinary witness fees, claimed under Item 8a; (5)
$8,826.75 for expert witness fees, claimed under Item 8b; (6) $3,810.72 for
delivery of binders; pick up trial boxes; delivery of thumb drive; etc.,
claimed under Item 11; (7) $4,207.00 for Court reporter fees, claimed under
Item 12; and (8) $1,387.27 for attorney services and messengers, overnight and
CourtCall, claimed under Item 13.
“If items on a memorandum of costs appear
to be proper charges on their face, those items are prima facie evidence that
the costs, expenses, and services are proper and necessarily incurred.
[Citation.] The burden then shifts to the objecting party to show them to be
unnecessary or unreasonable.”  (Doe v.
Los Angeles County Dept. of Children & Family Services (2019) 37
Cal.App.5th 675, 693.)  “[T]he objecting
party has the burden to show that a cost item is unrecoverable because it was
not necessary to the litigation.”  (Hooked
Media Group, Inc. v. Apple Inc. (2020) 55 Cal.App.5th 323, 338.)  “It
is not necessary that the [moving party], …, accompany the motion to tax cost
with any affidavit.”  (State of
California v. Meyer (1985) 174 Cal.App.3d 1061, 1075.)  However, more than a bare objection is needed
to rebut the presumption that fees were reasonable and necessarily
incurred.”  (State of California,
supra, 174 Cal.App.3d at p.1075.)
Here, Plaintiff is a prevailing buyer under the Song-Beverly
Act.  “Section 1794, subdivision (d),
permits the prevailing buyer to recover both ‘costs’ and
‘expenses.’”  (Jensen v. BMW of North
America, Inc. (1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 112, 137.)  
The Legislature
added the “costs and expenses” language to section 1794 in 1978. (Stats. 1978,
ch. 991, § 10, p. 3065.) An analysis by the Assembly Committee on Labor,
Employment, and Consumer Affairs states: “Indigent consumers are often
discouraged from seeking legal redress due to court costs. The addition of
awards of 'costs and expenses' by the court to the consumer to cover such
out-of-pocket expenses as filing fees, expert witness fees, marshall’s fees,
etc., should open the litigation process to everyone.” (Assem. Com. on Labor,
Employment & Consumer Affairs, Analysis of Assem. Bill No. 3374 (May 24,
1978) p. 2.)
(Id.
at p.138.)
“[T]he Legislature amended section 1794 to
provide for the recovery of “costs and expenses.” The legislative
history indicates the Legislature exercised its power to permit the recovery of
expert witness fees by prevailing buyers under the Act[.]”  (Ibid.)  “[T]he Legislature intended the phrase ‘costs
and expenses’ to cover items not included in ‘the detailed statutory definition
of “costs” ’ set forth in Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5.”  (Warren v. Kia Motors America, Inc. (2018)
30 Cal.App.5th 24, 42.)  Therefore, a
prevailing buyer is entitled to “costs and expenses” that have been “determined
by the court to have been reasonably incurred by the buyer in connection with
the commencement and prosecution of such action.”  (Civ. Code, § 1794(d).)
 
Filing
Fees
Filing fees are expressly allowable as
costs. (CCP §1033.5(a)(1).)  Thus, the burden
is on Defendant to show that the filing costs of $588.75 were not reasonably necessary
for the litigation.  Defendant fails to
meet this burden.  Defendant merely
claims that each of the filing fees sought were unsuccessful and therefore
cannot be recovered.  However, the mere
fact that the motions were unsuccessful alone does not show that they were not
reasonably necessary for the litigation. 
This is a bare objection which is insufficient to tax a permitted cost.  (State of California, supra, 174
Cal.App.3d at p.1075.)  Moreover, many of
the cited motions were not adversely determined against Plaintiffs but rather
taken off calendar such as the motion to compel deposition.  Thus, Defendant fails to show that these
motions were not reasonably necessary.
 
Deposition
Costs
            Defendant seeks to tax $7,366.54 in
deposition costs, $690.25 in service of process costs, and $105.00 in witness
fees.  The costs for taking, video
recording, and transcribing necessary depositions are expressly permitted as
costs.  (CCP § 1033.5(a)(3)(A).)  Similarly, service of process and witness
fees are expressly permitted.  (CCP §
1033.5(a)(4),(7).)  Therefore, the burden
is on Defendant to show that the costs are unnecessary or unreasonable.  Defendant fails to do so.  
            Defendant merely claims that the fees
for deposing service technicians were unnecessary because “[a]s attorneys who
specialize in this area of the law, Plaintiffs’ attorneys know there is no reason
to take the depositions of service advisors and technicians because the service
advisors and technicians keep a contemporaneous record of their work on the
repair orders they prepare each time they work on a vehicle. Plaintiffs’
attorneys also know the service advisors and technicians work on hundreds of
vehicles each year and cannot remember each one.”  (Motion at p.3:9-15.)  However, Defendant has failed to submit any
evidence to support this claim.  A memorandum
is not evidence, and “the court must disregard ‘facts’ contained in an
unverified statement.”  (Smith, Smith
& Kring v. Superior Court (Oliver) (1997) 60 Cal.App.4th 573, 578.)  Defendant similarly claims that the
deposition of Defendants expert Alberto P. Perez was excessive.  However, Defendant fails to explain how this
cost is excessive.  At best, Defendant
merely makes a bare objection to the cost. 
This is insufficient to tax a permitted cost.  (State of California, supra, 174
Cal.App.3d at p.1075.)  
 
Expert
Witness Fees
            Expert witness fees are generally
not permitted unless ordered by the court under Code of Civil section
1033.5(a)(8) or “except when expressly authorized by law.”  (CCP § 1038(b).)  However, Plaintiffs are prevailing buyers
under the Song-Beverly Act.  “Section
1794, subdivision (d), permits the prevailing buyer to recover both ‘costs’ and
‘expenses.’”  (Jensen v. BMW of North
America, Inc. (1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 112, 137.)  
 
The Legislature
added the “costs and expenses” language to section 1794 in 1978. (Stats. 1978,
ch. 991, § 10, p. 3065.) An analysis by the Assembly Committee on Labor,
Employment, and Consumer Affairs states: “Indigent consumers are often
discouraged from seeking legal redress due to court costs. The addition of
awards of 'costs and expenses' by the court to the consumer to cover such
out-of-pocket expenses as filing fees, expert witness fees, marshall’s fees,
etc., should open the litigation process to everyone.” (Assem. Com. on Labor,
Employment & Consumer Affairs, Analysis of Assem. Bill No. 3374 (May 24,
1978) p. 2.)
(Id.
at p.138.)
“[T]he Legislature amended section 1794 to
provide for the recovery of “costs and expenses.” The
legislative history indicates the Legislature exercised its power to permit the
recovery of expert witness fees by prevailing buyers under the Act[.]”  (Ibid.)  “[T]he Legislature intended the phrase ‘costs
and expenses’ to cover items not included in ‘the detailed statutory definition
of “costs” ’ set forth in Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5.”  (Warren v. Kia Motors America, Inc. (2018)
30 Cal.App.5th 24, 42.)  Therefore, a
prevailing buyer is entitled to “costs and expenses” that have been “determined
by the court to have been reasonably incurred by the buyer in connection with
the commencement and prosecution of such action.”  (Civ. Code, § 1794(d).)
Expert Fees clearly fall within the
intended expenses and legislative history of Civil Code section 1794.  (Jensen, supra, 35 Cal.App.4th at
p.138.)  Moreover, expert witness fees
are expenses that are clearly reasonably incurred by the buyer with the
commencement and prosecution of such action. 
However, not all of the claimed expert fees are reasonable nor incurred
in connection with the Song-Beverly Claims.
Plaintiff retained expert Barbara Luna to
testify as to punitive damages, Defendant’s financial condition and net worth,
and the valuation of damages and the financial impact of damages on
Defendant.  (Douglas Decl. ¶ 5, Exh.
2.)  Only civil penalties are available
for the Song-Beverly claims – not punitive damages.  Thus, the punitive damage testimony could
only be for the non-Song-Beverly Claims. 
As such, the fees incurred in connection with retaining expert Barbara
Luna are not recoverable.  Accordingly, a
reduction of $3,578.75 in costs is warranted.
As to expert Anthony Micale, the expert
fee is excessive.  As Plaintiffs’ Counsel
stated under oath during expert witness disclosure, Micale’s hourly rates were $350.00
per hour for providing deposition testimony and or consulting with the
retaining attorney, $350.00 per hour for vehicle inspections and investigations
and $150.00 per hour for travel and additional $0.55 per mile.  (Douglas Decl. ¶ 7, Exh. 4.)  In stark contrast, on the invoice provided, Micale
claimed expert fees of 8.75 hours at $400 per hour and 4 hours at $425 per
hour.  (Douglas Decl. ¶ 8, Exh. 5.)  These hourly rates are plainly inconsistent
with Plaintiffs’ counsel’s statements under oath.  The Court concludes that the reasonable hourly
rates were those represented by Counsel under oath.  Thus, a further reduction of $737.50 is
warranted.
 
Models,
Blowups, and Photocopies
            Defendant seeks to strike the
entirety of costs claimed for models, blowups, and photocopies of exhibits.  These fees are expressly permitted.  (CCP § 1033(a)(13).)  Further these costs appear reasonable given
that the action nearly proceeded to trial. 
Defendant’s mere objection that these costs were not reasonably incurred
is insufficient.
 
Court
Reporter Fees
            Defendant contends that the court
reporter fees are excessive on their face because they exceed the Los Angeles
Superior Court fee schedule and are therefore not reasonably incurred.  In general, transcripts of proceedings not
ordered by the court are not recoverable costs. 
(CCP § 1033.5(b)(5).) 
Accordingly, the Costs are only permitted if reasonably incurred with
the Song-Beverly Claims.  
            The summary adjudication proceeding related
only to the fraud claims.  (Order 7/23/21.)  Thus, the court reporter fees relating to
that hearing are not recoverable under Civil Code § 1794.  However, the remaining Court reporter fees do
appear to be reasonably incurred in connection with the Song-Beverly
claims.  Accordingly, the court reporter fees
are taxed a total amount of $645.00. 
 
Messenger
Fees
Here, the memorandum of costs denotes that
Plaintiff incurred $1,387.27 in messenger courtesy copy fees, overnight, and
CourtCall fees.  While these fees are not
expressly authorized as an allowable cost under Code of Civil Procedure section
1033.5, nor are they precluded.  The
Court finds that the messenger fees for motions and other filed documents were
reasonably necessary for litigation of this action to provide curtesy copies to
the Court.  Accordingly, the Court
declines to tax these costs.  However, as
guidance for future cases, all counsel are hereby informed that to minimize costs,
the Court does NOT require courtesy copies.
 
Attorney
Fees in Opposition
            In opposition, Plaintiff seeks
attorney fees in the amount of $2,970.00 spent opposing the instant
motion.  However, attorney fees must be
sought through a motion unless the fees are fixed without the necessity of a
court determination.  (Cal. Rules of
Court, Rule 3.1702.)  Moreover, such a
motion would be untimely.  (Cal. Rules of
Court, Rule 3.1702(b)(1).)  Accordingly, Plaintiffs’
request for fees in opposition is DENIED.
 
 
CONCLUSIONS AND
ORDER
            Based on the forgoing, Defendant Kia
Motors America, Inc.’s motion to tax costs is GRANTED IN PART as to $4,316.25
in expert witness fees and $645.00 in court reporter fees. 
            Moving Party is ordered to provide
notice of this order and file proof of service of such.
