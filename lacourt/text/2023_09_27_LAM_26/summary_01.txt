Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion by Kia Motors America, Inc. (Defendant) to tax costs in an ongoing lawsuit brought by Maria Del Carmen Valdovinos Rosales and Christina P. Alquisiras Valdovinos (Plaintiffs) related to a lease of a 2018 Kia Optima. The Plaintiffs are seeking to recover costs of $26,982.28, while the Defendant is seeking to reduce the amount of recoverable costs.

The judge finds that some of the costs claimed by the Plaintiffs are recoverable, including filing fees, deposition costs, service of process costs, and witness fees. However, the judge reduces the amount of expert witness fees claimed by the Plaintiffs by $4,316.25 and court reporter fees by $645.00.

The judge also denies the Plaintiffs' request for attorney fees in opposition to the motion to tax costs, finding that such fees must be sought through a motion and that the request is untimely.

Overall, the judge's tentative ruling grants the Defendant's motion to tax costs in part, reducing the amount of recoverable costs. The judge orders that the Defendant provide notice of the order and file proof of service of such.
