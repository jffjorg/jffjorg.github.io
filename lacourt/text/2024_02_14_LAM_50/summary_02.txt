And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has considered the parties' motions and has issued a minute order granting Cho's special motion to strike the third cause of action of Haywood's FAC. Cho has also filed a notice of motion for judgment on the pleadings, which will be heard on February 14, 2024. The Court construes the motion as directed to the first and second causes of action of Haywood's FAC, which allege breach of contract and breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The Court notes that the California Supreme Court has held that the statute of limitations begins to run when a plaintiff suspects or should suspect that their injury was caused by wrongdoing, and that this rule is applicable to the case at hand. The Court will consider these matters further at the hearing.
