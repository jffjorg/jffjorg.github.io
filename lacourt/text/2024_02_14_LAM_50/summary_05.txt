And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied Eric Knipe's motion for a new trial. The motion was filed on January 18, 2024, and was scheduled to be heard on February 1, 2024. However, Knipe failed to serve his notice of intention to move for new trial on the parties in a timely manner, and his moving papers were not all filed and served within the required time period. The Judge has found that Knipe's motion is fatally defective and must be denied. The Judge has also ordered Feldman to provide notice of this ruling.
