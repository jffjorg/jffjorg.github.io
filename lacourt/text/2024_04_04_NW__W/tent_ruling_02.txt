BACKGROUND
 
This is an unlawful detainer. On October 24, 2023, Plaintiff
Robert Allen, as Trustee of the 1989 Allen Revocable Trust, filed the unlawful
detainer against Defendant TayMLis Foods, Inc. On October 16, 2023, Plaintiff had
caused the Defendant to be served with a Three Day Notice to Pay Rent or Quit.
Plaintiff alleges Defendant owed the sum of $40,475.00 in rent.
 
[TENTATIVE] RULING:
 
Defendant’s Motion to Set Aside the Judgment and any
default, and to quash any writ of possession/execution is DENIED. 
 
DISCUSSION
 
Defendant TayMLis Foods, Inc. moves the court to set aside
the judgment entered against Defendant on the grounds they did not receive
Notice of the Trial from the Court. 
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 594 provides that a trial
may not take place in a party’s absence without proof that the absent party was
given at least five days’ notice of the trial in an unlawful detainer action,
or ten days’ notice if served by mail.  (CCP §§ 594(a) and 594(b).) 
A judgment entered following a trial conducted in violation of this requirement
is void.  (Urethane Foam Experts, Inc. v. Latimer (1995) 31
Cal.App.4th 763, 767.)  Further, when a defendant that has filed an answer
fails to appear at trial, the judge should confirm that the defendant was
properly served with notice of the trial under CCP § 594(a).  (Heidary
v. Yadollahi (2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 857, 862.)  If the judge finds that
the defendant was properly served with notice, the judge may proceed with the
trial and enter judgment against the defendant.  (Id. at
864.)   
 
Defendant states she called the court and was told about a
Case Management Conference scheduled for January 3, 2024 but was not informed
of the trial that occurred December 26, 2023. Defendants state they did not
discover the trial had occurred until they had appeared for the Case Management
Conference. 
 
The court finds Defendant received proper notice of the
trial. On December 5, 2023, Defendant was served by mail with a notice of the trial
set for December 26, 2023 at 9:30 AM. The court did not receive any Return to
Sender. Furthermore, this notice occurred more than five days before trial in
the unlawful detainer action. On the date of the trial, the court confirmed the
Defendant was successfully served a notice of trial. (See December 26, 2023
Order.) Defendant has not presented any evidence of surprise, mistake,
excusable neglect or inadvertence nor lack of actual notice.   Further, the court notes that a corporation
cannot appear without legal representation. 
Thus, the motion to set aside is not properly presented and may not be
considered.  
 
Accordingly, the motion to set aside judgment is DENIED.
