And here is a brief summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling denies the defendant's motion to set aside the judgment and quash the writ of possession/execution. The defendant, TayMLis Foods, Inc., argues that they did not receive notice of the trial, which was held on December 26, 2023. However, the Judge finds that the defendant received proper notice of the trial on December 5, 2023, and that the defendant did not present any evidence of surprise, mistake, excusable neglect or inadvertence, or lack of actual notice. Therefore, the motion is denied.
