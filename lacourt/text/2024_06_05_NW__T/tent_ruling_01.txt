  Case Number:  23VECV00341    Hearing Date:   June 5, 2024    Dept:  T 23VECV00341
Visionary Construction v 15719 Vanowen St
 
Tentative
ruling:  Motion for defendant from
default: Grant.  The court finds that plaintiff
agreed to set aside the default and there is evidence that plaintiff’s counsel
knew about counsel for defendant before default was entered but no fair notice
was given. Mr. Melkonian’s email of 3/3/2024 admits that he spoke with defense
counsel “almost one year ago” which would have been prior to entry of default. Default
was entered on 5/3/2023 and no notice of entry was served. A proposed
stipulation was sent to plaintiff’s counsel on 2/1/2024 but it was not signed
and returned although there are many references to plaintiff agreeing to sign
it.  Accordingly, the motion filed on
5/1/2024 is timely.  The default entered on
5/3/2023 is vacated.  The answer on file
5/1/2024 will stand.  Case management
conference will be continued.
