And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The Judge grants in part the motion for sanctions brought by the defendants against the plaintiff Michael Zellner. The plaintiff's amended answer is stricken, and $5,560 in sanctions and $61.65 in fees are awarded against the plaintiff's counsel. The defendants seek $33,384.87 in monetary sanctions, but the court finds that the plaintiff's complaint lacks factual or legal support and that the amended answer was filed without reasonable legal basis. The court finds that the defendants are entitled to limited sanctions against the plaintiff's counsel associated with the filing of the motion.
