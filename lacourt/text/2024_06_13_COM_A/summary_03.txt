And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling is a continuation of a hearing on a petition for change of name. The court previously continued the hearing due to the petition being incomplete. The judge required the petitioner, Rudi Teneal Rudolph, to complete form NC-110 in full, particularly item 7 and subparts. However, the court's file does not reflect that the petitioner complied with the prior order. Therefore, the court continues the hearing to July 30, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. in Department A of the Compton Courthouse.
