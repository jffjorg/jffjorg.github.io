[TENTATIVE] ORDER CONTINUING THE HEARING ON PETITION FOR CHANGE OF
NAME
              
The court
previously continued this hearing from May 14, 2024, as the petition for change
of name was incomplete. Petitioner was required to complete form NC-110 in full,
particularly at Item 7, and subparts thereto. The court’s file does not reflect
that Petitioner complied with the court’s prior order. Accordingly, the Court
continues the hearing to July 30, 2024,  at 8:30 a.m. in Department A of the Compton
Courthouse.
