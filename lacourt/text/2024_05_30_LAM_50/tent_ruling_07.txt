[1]The Court also notes that Defendants raise a few
arguments for the first time in connection with reply, such as that “the
Waxwing POS is untimely…The Waxwing POS alleges that service was made on
January 11, 2024, a week after Plaintiffs were required to serve the
complaint.” (Reply at pp. 3:26-4:2.) As an initial matter, Defendants do not
cite any legal authority to support this assertion. In addition, “[p]oints raised for the first time in a reply brief will ordinarily not be considered, because
such consideration would deprive the respondent of an opportunity to counter
the argument.¿” (American Drug Stores, Inc.
v. Stroh (1992) 10 Cal.App.4th
1446, 1453¿.) Moreover, as
to the evidence submitted for the first time in connection with Defendants’
reply, the Court notes that “¿[t]he general rule of motion practice…is that new
evidence is not permitted with reply papers.¿”¿(¿Jay¿v. Mahaffey¿(2013) 218 Cal.App.4th 1522, 1537.)
