And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is a summary of the case between Plaintiff Cesar Cotto and Defendant Claim Jumper Acquisition Company LLC. The Plaintiff requests a default judgment against the Defendant for violating the Unruh Civil Rights Act (UCRA) by not making their website "www.claimjumper.com" accessible to blind and visually impaired individuals. The Court previously denied the Plaintiff's request for default judgment without prejudice, but the Plaintiff submitted a new proposed judgment correcting the defects identified in the Court's previous order. The Court finds that the Plaintiff has sufficiently supported his request and grants the Plaintiff's request for default judgment, ordering the Defendant to make their website accessible to all individuals.
