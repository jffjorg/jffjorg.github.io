ORDER RE:
AMENDED MOTION
  FOR PROTECTIVE ORDER RE: DEPOSITION OF DEFENDANT GLORIA MARTINE-SENFTNER [sic]
  AND MARTINEZ LAW GROUP P.C




AND RELATED CROSS-ACTION


 



 
Defendants Gloria Martinez-Senftner and Martinez Law Group P.C.
(jointly, the “Martinez Defendants”) move for a protective order that prohibits
Plaintiff Curtis R. Olson from taking Defendants’ deposition.
The Martinez Defendants’ motion will be
continued to a new date as set forth below. NO HEARING WILL TAKE PLACE ON
MAY 30, 2024.    
Pursuant to the
Court’s power to “amend and control its process and orders so as to make them
conform to law and justice” (Code Civ. Proc., § 128, subd. (a)(8)), the Court
orders the parties in this case to participate in a meet and confer with the
Court (“Informal Discovery Conference” or “IDC”). Lead or other
designated counsel for the parties with full authority are ordered to
participate in person in an IDC. After consulting with opposing counsel
regarding available dates, the Martinez Defendants must make a prompt reservation for the IDC using the
Court’s online reservation system. The Martinez Defendants must file Dept. 50’s one-page IDC form in the department
seven days prior to the IDC, and the responding parties may file the same form
in the department setting forth a response three days prior to the IDC.   
Once the Martinez Defendants have confirmed an IDC date, the Martinez Defendants must use the Court’s online reservation system to continue
the motion to a post-IDC discovery hearing date. The parties are ordered to
have with them whatever materials are needed to make the IDC session productive
and successful. Prior to the IDC date, lead or other designated counsel for the
parties, with full authority, are to meet and confer, in person or via
telephone in a further attempt to resolve as many of the
issues as possible before the IDC. (See CRC Rule 3.670, subd. (f)(2).)
If the parties resolve their discovery disputes before the IDC date, the Martinez
Defendants are ordered to take both the IDC and the
motion off calendar as soon as possible. 
The Martinez Defendants
are ordered to provide notice of this Order.
