ORDER RE:  
 
PLAINTIFF’S REQUEST FOR DEFAULT JUDGMENT
 




            
Plaintiff
Cesar Cotto (“Plaintiff”) requests entry of default judgment against Defendant Claim
Jumper Acquisition Company LLC (“Defendant”). Plaintiff seeks judgment in the
total amount of $4,834.00, comprising $4,000.00 in damages, $504.00 in costs,
and $330.00 in attorney fees. Plaintiff also seeks a “[p]reliminary and
permanent injunction enjoining Defendant CLAIM JUMPER ACQUISITION COMPANY LLC,
a Nevada limited liability company, (“Defendant”) from further violation of
UCRA, Civil Code section 51 et. seq, with respect to its website
“www.claimjumper.com” and a preliminary and permanent injunction requiring
Defendant to take the steps necessary to make “www.claimjumper.com” readily
accessible to and usable by blind and visually impaired individuals.” (See
Proposed Judgment, “Attachment to Court Judgment: Section 8.”) 
On
March 21, 2024, the Court issued an Order denying Plaintiff’s request for
default judgment without prejudice. In addition, the Court issued a minute
order on March 21, 2024 providing, inter alia, that “[t]he Court denies
Plaintiff’s request for default judgment without prejudice. On or before April
22, 2024 Plaintiff will file a new proposed judgment with a courtesy copy
delivered to Department 50.” On March 28, 2024, Plaintiff submitted a new
proposed judgment. Plaintiff’s new proposed judgment corrects the
defects identified in the Court’s March 21, 2024 Order. The Court finds that
Plaintiff has sufficiently supported his request with the submitted
declarations and evidence.
Based on the foregoing,
Plaintiff’s request is granted, and the Court will sign the proposed judgment
submitted on March 28, 2024. 
No appearance at the
hearing is necessary.¿¿
