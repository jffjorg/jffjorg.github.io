Here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge notes that the defendant has raised some arguments for the first time in their reply brief, including that the service of complaint was untimely. However, the defendant does not cite any legal authority to support this assertion. The judge also notes that points raised for the first time in a reply brief are typically not considered, as it would deprive the respondent of an opportunity to counter the argument. Additionally, the judge notes that new evidence is not permitted with reply papers.
