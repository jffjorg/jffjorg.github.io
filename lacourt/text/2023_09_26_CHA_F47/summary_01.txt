If the Plaintiff does not amend, the claim will be dismissed without prejudice, meaning they can bring it back up later if new evidence emerges.  This ruling reflects the Judge's initial assessment of the facts and legal arguments presented by both sides.

**Tentative Ruling**
================

**Case Number:** 21CHCV00794
**Hearing Date:** September 26, 2023
**Dept:** F47 Dept.

**Summary:**

The Court has considered the demurrer and motion to strike filed by Defendant Miles Chemical Company, Inc. (Miles Chemical) against Plaintiff Estate of Rosa Pleitez, by and through her husband, Rigoberto Pleitez (Plaintiff). The Court has ruled that:

* The demurrer to the 2nd cause of action (survival action) is overruled.
* The motion to strike is granted without leave to amend as to the prayer for attorney fees.
* The motion to strike is granted as to the allegations regarding and prayer for punitive damages, with the option for Plaintiff to amend within 30 days or to move to amend later if facts to support the claim are discovered.

**Facts:**

The case arises from Plaintiff's claim that Decedent Rosa Pleitez was exposed to chemicals and caustic products produced by Miles Chemical while employed as a janitor, resulting in her death. Plaintiff alleges that Miles Chemical engaged in reckless and wanton conduct, knowing the products were defective and posed a grave risk to consumers.

**Dispute:**

Miles Chemical contends that the survival cause of action is uncertain and that the prayer for punitive damages lacks sufficient specific facts.

**Analysis:**

* The demurrer to the survival action was based on the ground that the allegations are unclear. However, the First Amended Complaint adequately alleges the bases for the claim, and any further clarification needed by Miles Chemical can be obtained through discovery.
* The motion to strike the prayer for attorney fees was granted as it does not allege any basis for recovery authorized by contract, statute, or law.
* The motion to strike the allegations regarding and prayer for punitive damages was granted as the First Amended Complaint lacks sufficient specific facts to support a claim for punitive damages.

**Intentions:**

The Court intends to grant leave to amend the prayer for punitive damages, giving Plaintiff 30 days to do so or the option to move to amend later if facts to support the claim are discovered.

**Significant Statements:**

* "Punitive damages are proper only when the tortious conduct rises to levels of extreme indifference to the plaintiff's rights, a level which decent citizens should not have to tolerate." (Lackner, 2006)
* "Mere negligence, carelessness or recklessness, alone, is insufficient to support a claim for punitive damages." (Bell, 1989)
* "A claim for punitive damages must be pled with particularity." (Brosseau, 1977)
