Additionally, the Judge has granted the motion to strike the Plaintiff's request for punitive damages, but has given the Plaintiff the option to amend their complaint within 30 days to provide further evidence to support the claim for punitive damages. If the Plaintiff does not amend, the claim will be dismissed without prejudice, meaning they can bring it back up later if new evidence emerges.  This ruling reflects the Judge's initial assessment of the facts and legal arguments presented by both sides.
