SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises out of Plaintiff Estate of Rosa
Pleitez, by and through her husband, Rigoberto Pleitez’s (Plaintiff) claim that
from 10/13/19 through at least 9/21/20, Decedent Rosa Pleitez (Decedent) was
exposed to chemicals and caustic products produced, manufactured, distributed
and/or sold by Defendant Miles Chemical Company, Inc. (Miles Chemical) and
others while employed as a janitor for Carbonite Industries in Riverside,
California.  (FAC ¶¶ 1, 2).  It is alleged that Decedent developed
catastrophic interstitial lung disease with major injury and disability that
affected her ability to work and support herself and her family and ultimately,
was a substantial factor in her death on or about 3/26/22.  (FAC ¶2). 
The First Amended Complaint alleges that the substances Decedent was
exposed to were scientifically known to cause and/or contribute to the
development of interstitial lung disease and directly caused or contributed to
Decedent's death.  (FAC ¶3).  Plaintiff alleges that Decedent did not
receive adequate warning regarding the potential for injury and development of
injury and development of lung injury or interstitial lung disease from
Defendant.  (FAC ¶4).  Plaintiff also alleges that Defendants
engaged in the business of testing, developing, designing, manufacturing,
selling, distributing, and promoting their chemical products which are
defective and unreasonably dangerous to consumers, including Decedent.  (FAC ¶19). 
Additionally, Plaintiff alleges that Defendants knew or had reason to
know that the products which they produced, manufactured, distributed and/or
sold to Decedent's employer were defective and were inherently dangerous and
unsafe when used in the manner instructed and provided by Defendants.  (FAC ¶¶ 25, 42).  Further, Plaintiff alleges that Defendants
wrongfully concealed information concerning the dangerous nature of their
chemicals and made false and/or misleading statements concerning the safety of
Defendants’ products.  (FAC ¶¶ 34, 38, 47).  Plaintiff alleges that Defendants breached
their duty of reasonable care and failed to exercise ordinary care in the
design, research, development, manufacturing, testing, marketing, supply,
promotion, advertisement, packaging, sale and distribution of their chemical
products.  (FAC ¶¶ 46, 48, 55).  Plaintiff also alleges that    Defendants’ reckless, wanton and conscious
disregard of the known defects in their products and associated health risks
known to be caused or contributed by their chemical products, amounts to
willful, malicious misconduct that supports an award of punitive damages
against Defendants. (FAC ¶¶ 51, 57).   
 
On 10/8/21, Plaintiffs Rosa Pleitez and Rigoberto Pleitez
filed the original complaint in this action asserting causes of action for: (1)
Strict Liability – Design Defect, (2) Strict Liability – Failure to Warn, (3)
Negligence, (4) Breach of Implied Warranty and (5) Loss of Consortium.  Thereafter, Plaintiff Rosa Pleitez died.  On 5/24/23, Plaintiff Estate
of Rosa Pleitez, by and through her husband, Rigoberto Pleitez filed a
First Amended Complaint asserting causes of action for: (1) Wrongful Death and
(2) Survival Action.  After meet and
confer efforts failed to resolve the issues Defendant Miles Chemical had with
the First Amended Complaint, on 8/7/23, Miles Chemical filed and served the
instant demurrer to the 2nd cause of action in the First Amended
Complaint.  Additionally, Miles Chemical
filed and served the instant motion to strike which seeks to strike portions of
the First Amended Complaint relating to punitive damages and attorney’s fees
(FAC ¶¶51, 57, Prayer ¶3 and Prayer (second) ¶3).  Plaintiff has opposed the demurrer and motion
to strike and Miles Chemical has filed replies to the oppositions.  
 
ANALYSIS
   
Demurrer
 
The demurrer is based on the ground that Plaintiff’s 2nd
cause of action, survival action, is uncertain. 
CCP 430.10(f).
 
In a survival action, the damages recoverable by a
decedent’s representative or successor in interest on the decedent’s cause of
action are limited to the loss or damage that the decedent sustained or
incurred before death.  CCP 377.34.
 
Miles Chemical contends that Plaintiff’s survival cause
of action is uncertain because the original complaint brought by Decedent,
while she was alive, included causes of action for strict liability – design
defect, strict liability – failure to warn, negligence, and breach of implied
warranty and it is unclear which of those claims are being asserted on behalf
of Decedent in the second cause of action in the First Amended Complaint.
 
The First Amended Complaint supersedes the original
complaint which ceases to have any effect as a pleading or as a basis for
judgment.  See State
Compensation Insurance Fund (2010) 184 CA4th 1124, 1130-1131 (internal
citations omitted).  The First Amended
Complaint adequately alleges the bases for the survival action claim and the
claim is not so uncertain that Miles Chemical cannot respond.  (See FAC ¶¶52-57).  Any further clarification needed by Miles
Chemical can be obtained through discovery.   

 
Motion to Strike
 
A motion to strike may be used to challenge a request for
improper damages.  Caliber Bodyworks,
Inc. 134 CA4th 365, 384-385; Grieves (1984) 157 CA3d 159, 166-168;
CCP 436(a).
 
Attorney’s fees are only recoverable when authorized by
contract, statute or law.  CCP
1033.5(a)(10).  The First Amended
Complaint does not allege any of the foregoing bases to support the prayer for
attorney’s fees nor does Plaintiff address Miles Chemical’s request to strike
the prayer for attorney’s fees in the opposition to the motion to strike other
than to conclude that it is adequately pled. 
(See Opposition to Motion to Strike, p.3:11-13).  
 
Punitive damages may be imposed where it is proven by
clear and convincing evidence that the defendant has been guilty of oppression,
fraud, or malice.  Civil Code 3294(a).  As used in Civil Code 3294 “‘[m]alice’ means
conduct which is intended by the defendant to cause injury to the plaintiff or
despicable conduct which is carried on by the defendant with a willful and
conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others;” “‘[o]ppression’ means
despicable conduct that subjects a person to cruel and unjust hardship in
conscious disregard of that person's rights;” and “‘[f]raud’ means an
intentional misrepresentation, deceit, or concealment of a material fact known
to the defendant with the intention on the part of the defendant of thereby
depriving a person of property or legal rights or otherwise causing injury.”  Civil Code 3294(c).
 
"'Punitive damages are proper only when the tortious
conduct rises to levels of extreme indifference to the plaintiff's rights, a
level which decent citizens should not have to tolerate.' [Citation.]"  Lackner (2006) 135 CA4th 1188, 1210; See
also Tomaselli (1994) 25 CA4th 1269, 1287; Mock (1992) 4
CA4th 306, 331.  Mere negligence,
carelessness or recklessness, alone, is insufficient to support a claim for
punitive damages.  Bell (1989) 212
CA3d 1034, 1044; Hughes (1989) 215 CA3d 832, 847. 
 
In order to support a claim for punitive damages, a
complaint must allege “ultimate facts of the defendant’s oppression, fraud, or
malice.”  Cyrus (1976) 65 CA3d
306, 316-317; Blegen (1981) 125 CA3d 959, 963.  Additionally, a claim for punitive damages
must be pled with particularity.  Brosseau
(1977) 73 CA3d 864, 872.  Further, with
regard to a corporate defendant such as Miles Chemical, Plaintiff has failed to
plead facts showing the requisite intent on the part of a corporate leader or
that the conduct of an employee which would support a claim for punitive
damages was authorized or ratified by an officer, director or managing
agent.  See Cruz (2000) 83
CA4th 160, 167; White (1999) 21 C4th 563, 572; Civil Code 3294(b).     
 
Here, the First Amended Complaint does not plead
sufficient specific facts to support a claim for punitive damages against Miles
Chemical.  Plaintiff has not alleged
facts showing the type of intentionally tortious conduct on the part of Miles
Chemical which is necessary to support a claim for punitive damages.  Allegations that Miles Chemical knew or
should have known its products posed a grave risk are insufficient to meet the
requisite pleading standard for punitive damages.  (See FAC ¶¶26.f, 33, 34, 37, 43, 44,
48.i, 51, 57).  The opposition
essentially concedes that Plaintiff does not currently have sufficient facts to
support a claim for punitive damages by arguing that “Plaintiff has not yet
conducted discovery and depositions in this matter and believe that Defendant
MILES had knowledge of their products and failed to warn and allow the safety
of the consumers to be at risk so that Defendant MILES would not have to modify
or alter the product or packaging or warnings all due to the financial cost.”  (See Opposition to Motion to Strike,
p.5:20-24).   
 
CONCLUSION
 
The demurrer is overruled.  
 
The motion to strike is granted without leave to amend as
to the prayer for attorney fees (Prayer, (second) ¶3, p.23:5).
 
The motion to strike is granted as to the allegations
regarding and prayer for punitive damages. 
The Court would normally grant leave to amend based on the liberal
policy of allowing amendments and since this is only the First Amended
Complaint.  However, it is not clear how
Plaintiff will obtain the facts to support the claim in 30 days, which is the
amount of time the Court usually allows for amendment after a motion to strike
is granted.  Therefore, Plaintiff has the
option of having the motion to strike as to the allegations regarding and
prayer for punitive damages granted with 30 days leave to amend.  Or, having the motion to strike as to the
allegations regarding and the prayer for punitive damages granted without leave
to amend, but without prejudice to Plaintiff making a later motion to amend to add
a claim for punitive damages, if facts to support such a damage claim are
discovered.  
 
If Plaintiff chooses the second option, Miles Chemical’s
answer will be due within 30 days.
