And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer and motion to strike filed by Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and Cedars-Sinai Health System. The demurrer was challenged on the basis of insufficient factual basis and improper naming of Cedars-Sinai Health System as a defendant. The judge overruled the demurrer as to the challenge of Cedars-Sinai Health System and the negligent infliction of emotional distress cause of action, and sustained with leave to amend as to the negligent misrepresentation cause of action.

The motion to strike the punitive damages allegations was granted, and the parties agreed to strike the claims as to the subject defendants.

The judge also granted 30 days leave to amend on a first demurrer, and set a hearing date for October 3, 2024, for the demurrer filed by the Medtronic defendants.
