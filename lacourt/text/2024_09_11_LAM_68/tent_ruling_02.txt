On June 5, 2024, the court entered judgment on the case
in favor of Defendant Akzo Nobel Coatings, Inc. as to the complaint of
Plaintiff Bronze-Way Plating Corporation. The judgment included recovery of
costs.
 
RULING: Granted in Part/Denied in Part.
Plaintiff Bronze-Way Plating Corporation moves to tax
items within the memorandum of costs filed by Defendant Akzo Nobel Coatings,
Inc. Plaintiff moves on grounds that the costs are not authorized, lack
sufficient support, and were therefore not reasonably and necessarily incurred.
Defendants in opposition maintains all costs were reasonably incurred.
Plaintiff in reply reiterates the propriety of certain costs, in particular the
pro hac vice incurred costs, the subpoena costs, and cross-complaint fees.
 
California Rule of Court, Rule 3.1700 requires that “Any
notice of motion to strike or to tax costs must be served and filed 15 days
after service of the cost memorandum.” (Cal. Rules Court, rule, 3.1700(b)(1).) The
time for filing is extended for mail or electronic service pursuant to either
Code of Civil Procedure sections 1010.6, subdivision (a)(4) or 1013. Additionally,
“[t]he party claiming costs and
the party contesting costs may agree to extend the time for serving and filing
the cost memorandum and a motion to strike or tax costs. This agreement must be
confirmed in writing, specify the extended date for service, and be filed with
the clerk. In the absence of an agreement, the court may extend the times for
serving and filing the cost memorandum or the notice of motion to strike or tax
costs for a period not to exceed 30 days.” (Cal. Rules Court, rule, 3.1700(b)(3).)

 
The memorandum of costs was filed and served on June 21,
2024, by electronic service. “Any document that is
served electronically between 12:00 a.m. and 11:59:59 p.m. on a court day shall
be deemed served on that court day. Any document that is served electronically
on a noncourt day shall be deemed served on the next court day.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1010.6, subd. (a)(4).) “Any period of notice, or any right or duty to
do any act or make any response within any period or on a date certain after
the service of the document, which time period or date is prescribed by statute
or rule of court, shall be extended after service by electronic means by two
court days...” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1010.6, subd. (a)(4)(B).) The motion was
timely filed on July 9, 2024.
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5 sets forth the costs
recoverable by the prevailing party. To recover a cost, it must be reasonably
necessary to the litigation and reasonable in amount. (Perko’s Enterprises, Inc. v. RRNS Enterprises (l992) 4 Cal.App.4th
238, 244.) In reviewing a motion to tax costs, a guiding principle is that all
costs must be “reasonably necessary to the litigation” and “reasonable in need
and amount.” (Acosta v. SI Corporation (2005) 129 Cal.App.4th 1370, 1380.)
 
If an item of cost is expressly allowed by statute and if items appear on their face to be
proper, the verified memorandum of costs is prima facie evidence of their
propriety, shifting the burden of proof to the objecting party to show that the
items were unnecessary or unreasonable. (Ibid.; Nelson v. Anderson (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 111, 131-132.) If
the items appearing in a cost bill appear to be proper charges, the burden is
on the party seeking to tax costs to show that they were not reasonable or
necessary. (Ladas v. California State
Automotive Assoc. (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 761, 773-74.)  On the other hand, if the items are properly
objected to, they are put in issue and the burden of proof is on the party
claiming them as costs. (Id.) “Only after such costs are challenged by a
motion to tax do the parties need to justify their claims by submitting
documentation of the costs they have incurred.” (Bach v. County of Butte (1989) 215 Cal.App.3d 294, 308.) Costs
not expressly permitted under Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5,
subdivision (a), but not expressly denied under Code of Civil Procedure section,
subdivision (b), may be recovered in a court’s discretion. (Science
Applications International Corporation v. Superior Court (1995) 39
Cal.App.4th 1095, 1103.)  
 
Courts have discretion to disallow costs that were
unreasonably incurred. (Michell v. Olick
(1996) 49 Cal.App.4th 1194, 1201.) 
Cost awards are reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard. (El Dorado Meat Co. v. Yosemite Meat and
Locker Service, Inc. (2007) 150 Cal.App.4th 612, 616; Gibson v. Bobroff (1996) 49 Cal.App.4th
1202, 1209.)
 
The right to recovery of costs remains unchallenged. The
memorandum of costs includes four items: filing and motion fees, deposition
costs, electronic filing fees, and other, enumerated as follows:
 
1. Filing and motion fees, $995
4. Deposition costs, $1,803.84
11. Court reporter fees as established by statute, $2,148.64
14. Fees for electronic filing or service, $590.19
16. Other, $3,970
TOTAL COSTS of $7,359.03
 
Plaintiff identifies 39 separate challenges within the
four categories. Plaintiff represents the total challenged fees amount to $5,080.07,
thereby leaving an unchallenged amount to $2,278.96. The court lists each and
every contested item from the motion.

Notwithstanding the 39 individually challenged items, the motion and reply
lacks actual address of each and every item number (see below), and instead
presents the challenge through consideration based on either party or purpose
of the costs. The court begins with the cross-complaint related items.
 
Plaintiff asserts no right to collect costs for unrelated
matters. Defendant in opposition counters the subject fees, including the
cross-complaint related litigation, were incurred as a result of Defendant’s
necessity in filing the cross-complaint upon being named a defendant by
Plaintiff. Defendant also notes that nothing in the recovery of costs limits
the recuperation to only the immediate parties, and instead applies to the litigation
in general.
 
Recovery of costs is limited to the prevailing party.
Defendant was only the prevailing party against Plaintiff. (Code Civ. Proc., §
1032.) California law definitively identifies a cross-complaint as a “separate
action.” (Shepard
& Morgan v. Lee & Daniel, Inc.
(1982) 31 Cal.3d 256, 260-261; Bertero
v. National General Corp. (1974) 13 Cal.3d
43, 51; Pacific Finance Corporation v.
Superior Court of Los Angeles County
(1933) 219 Cal. 179, 182.)  The
court finds no support for recovery against an unrelated party in a “separate”
action after successfully prevailing on the action only between the parties.
The motion is therefore GRANTED as to items 1.b, 1.c., 14 (9-28-22 Answer) and 16.
The court cannot otherwise determine any other fees related exclusively to the
cross-complaint. 
 
Plaintiff next challenges the subpoena costs on grounds
of insufficient itemization and records. Defendant maintains all records
relates to the motion for summary judgment, and presents a supplemental
declaration with further cost support identifying the basis of the fees.
[Declaration of Timothy Coughlin.] Plaintiff in reply presents significantly
more detailed address of the basis of said costs through challenge to the
“necessity” of such discovery in support of the motion for summary judgment.
Plaintiff also maintains less costly methods for conducting discovery with the
California Franchise Tax Board could have also occurred, such as basic
discovery versus a more costly subpoena. 
 
The court declines to find said costs unreasonable. A
retrospective challenge to what was deemed material in a successful summary
judgment motion in no way renders the prior costs unreasonable. The court also
finds the conclusions of Defendant timely receiving necessary discovery through
less costly means based on speculative assumptions. [See Declaration of Arbel
Illya filed with the reply.] Plaintiff brought the action, and Defendant was
entitled to conduct discovery, present law and motion, and prepare for trial,
on a time frame subject to their management. Plaintiff may not both bring suit
and dictate the means and timeliness for preparation. The court finds the costs
reasonable. [Id., Ex. B-E.] The motion is denied as to these items.
 
Finally, on pro hac vice fees, Plaintiff challenges the
necessity of retaining out of state counsel for this action. Defendant
maintains the out of state counsel serve Defendant nationwide, and provided
representation on a number of cases, including groundwater contamination. The
court finds nothing unreasonable in the defendant seeking admission of out of
state counsel given the relationship with the law firm, and familiarity with
the issues. The motion is denied as to these items.
 
The court therefore grants the motion to tax as to the
identified cross-complaint related items, and denies the remainder of the
motion. 
 
Plaintiff to give notice to
parties.
