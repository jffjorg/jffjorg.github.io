Part/Sustained with Leave to Amend in Part.
Request
for Judicial Notice: Denied.
·        
The court cannot take judicial notice of
documents filed with a state agency for any factual findings for the truth of
the matter asserted unless and until an official action on the document under
authority of the director occurs. (Cal. Evid. Code § 452, subd. (c); Friends
of Shingle Springs Interchange, Inc. v. County of El Dorado (2011) 200 Cal.App.4th 1470, 1484; Elmore
v. Oak Valley Hospital Dist. (1988) 204 Cal.App.3d 716,
721.)
·        
The court declines to make a finding of
undisputed facts from within the content of the filed document itself given the
objections. (Evid. Code § 452, subd. (h).)
 
 
Defendants Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and Cedars-Sinai
Health System, submits the subject demurrer to the negligent misrepresentation
and negligent infliction of emotional distress causes of action. Defendants
challenge the two causes of action on grounds of insufficient factual basis,
and an improperly named defendant, Cedars-Sinai Health System. Plaintiffs in
opposition contends any challenge based on the status of Cedars-Sinai Health
System improperly relies on extrinsic evidence, and the complaint sufficiently
articulates the two challenged causes of action. Defendants in reply reiterates
the position regarding Cedars-Sinai Health System, challenges the opposition
response to the demurrer to the negligent misrepresentation and negligent
infliction of emotional distress causes of action. 
 
A demurrer is an objection to a pleading, the grounds for
which are apparent from either the face of the complaint or a matter of which
the court may take judicial notice. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.30, subd. (a); see
also Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) The purpose of a
demurrer is to challenge the sufficiency of a pleading “by raising questions of
law.” (Postley v. Harvey (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 280, 286.) “In the
construction of a pleading, for the purpose of determining its effect, its
allegations must be liberally construed, with a view to substantial justice
between the parties.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 452.) The court “ ‘ “treat[s] the
demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded, but not contentions,
deductions or conclusions of fact or law . . . .” ’ ” (Berkley v. Dowds
(2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 518, 525.) In applying these standards, the court
liberally construes the complaint to determine whether a cause of action has
been stated.  (Picton v. Anderson
Union High School Dist. (1996) 50 Cal.App.4th 726, 733.)
 
“A demurrer for uncertainty is strictly construed, even
where a complaint is in some respects uncertain, because ambiguities can be
clarified under modern discovery procedures.” (Khoury v. Maly's of
California, Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616; Williams v.
Beechnut Nutrition Corp. (1986) 185 Cal.App.3d 135, 139 [“[U]nder our
liberal pleading rules, where the complaint contains substantive factual
allegations sufficiently apprising defendant of the issues it is being asked to
meet, a demurrer for uncertainty should be overruled or plaintiff given leave
to amend.]
 
The demurrer of Cedars-Sinai Health System based on its
entity status relies on extrinsic information not subject to judicial notice.
The demurrer is overruled on this basis.
 
12th
Cause of Action: Negligent Misrepresentation
Defendants
challenge the factual deficiency of the subject cause of action. Plaintiffs
specifically reference section IV of the complaint as well as the incorporated
provisions in the tenth and eleventh causes of action for Medical Negligence
and Failure to Obtain Informed Consent.
 
“Negligent misrepresentation is
a separate and distinct tort, a species of the tort of deceit. ‘Where the
defendant makes false statements, honestly believing that they are true, but
without reasonable ground for such belief, he may be liable for negligent misrepresentation, a
form of deceit.’” (Bily v. Arthur Young & Co. (1992) 3 Cal.4th 370, 407.) “The tort
of negligent misrepresentation does not require scienter or intent to
defraud. (Citation.) It encompasses ‘[t]he assertion, as a
fact, of that which is not true, by one who has no reasonable ground for
believing it to be true’ (Citation), and ‘[t]he positive assertion, in a manner
not warranted by the information of the person making it, of that which is not
true, though he believes it to be true’ (Citation)…’” (Small v. Fritz
Companies, Inc. (2003) 30 Cal.4th
167, 173–174.) Misrepresentations must be made about past or existing
fact. (Neu-Visions Sports, Inc. v.
Soren/McAdam/Bartells (2000) 86 Cal.App.4th 303, 309–310; Agricultural Ins. Co. v. Superior Court
(1999) 70 Cal.App.4th 385, 390.) Misrepresentations must
be made about past or existing fact. Opinions are not treated as
representations of fact. (Neu-Visions
Sports, Inc. v. Soren/McAdam/Bartells (2000) 86 Cal.App.4th 303, 309–310; Agricultural Ins. Co. v. Superior Court
(1999) 70 Cal.App.4th 385, 390.) 
 
The operative cause of action consists of the pled elements
with limited to no factual articulation. Section IV of the complaint presents
extensive product liability allegations regarding the device itself, but it
remains unclear how said product liability allegations support the basis of
negligent misrepresentation as to the health care providers. [Comp., ¶¶ 188,
189(c-d).] While Defendants apparently concede to the validity of the pled
allegations in the tenth and eleventh causes of action for medical negligence
and failure to obtain informed consent for purposes of the demurrer, and the
subject cause of action incorporates the prior allegations, the actual cause of
action still lacks any specific distinction from the prior causes of action
articulating separate and independent misrepresentation under the standard. (See
Cobbs v. Grant, supra, 8 Cal.3d
at p. 243; Jamison v. Lindsay (1980)
108 Cal.App.3d 223, 243; Conte v. Girard Orthopaedic Surgeons Medical Group, Inc. (2003)
107 Cal.App.4th 1260, 1267.) A failure to communicate constitutes different
considerations not part of the claim for misrepresentation. The demurrer is
sustained with leave to amend as to this cause of action.
 
13th
Cause of Action: Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress
Defendants challenge the subject cause of action on grounds
that Plaintiffs fail to allege a contemporaneous awareness of the injury
producing event, thereby supporting a claim for bystander emotional distress. Plaintiffs
in opposition alleges contemporaneous awareness of a substantial injury causing
event as a result of the overdose caused during the procedure.
 
“The law of negligent infliction of emotional distress in
California is typically analyzed ... by reference to two ‘theories' of
recovery: the ‘bystander’ theory and the ‘direct victim’ theory.” (Burgess v. Superior Court (1992) 2
Cal.4th 1064, 1071.) Under the bystander theory, the plaintiff seeks to recover
damages for serious emotional distress suffered as a result of an injury to a
close family member. Recovery is limited as a matter of public policy to those
cases where the plaintiff was present at the scene of the injury-producing
event and was aware that the event was causing injury to the victim. (Id. at pp. 1072-1073; Thing v. La Chusa (1989) 48 Cal.3d 644,
667-668.) “To be sure, Thing’s
requirement that the plaintiff be contemporaneously aware of the
injury-producing event has not been interpreted as requiring visual perception
of an impact on the victim. A plaintiff may recover based on an event perceived
by other senses so long as the event is contemporaneously understood as causing
injury to a close relative.” (Bird v.
Saenz (2002) 28 Cal.4th 910, 916; Krouse
v. Graham (1977) 19 Cal.3d 59, 76; Wilks
v. Hom (1992) 2 Cal.App.4th 1264, 1273.
The medical context can present a situation where the bystander must be
aware that the care and treatment rendered by the health care provider directly
caused the emotional response inducing event. (Bird v. Saenz, supra, 28 Cal.4th at p. 916; Morton v. Thousand Oaks Surgical
Hospital (2010) 187 Cal.App.4th 926, 935 Breazeal v. Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital (1991) 234
Cal.App.3d 1329, 1342; Golstein v.
Superior Court (1990) 223 Cal.App.3d 1415, 1427.)
 
The complaint alleges Edward Bubar’s presence during the
“refill” procedure and observation of the subsequent complications from the
conduct of the treating physician. [Comp., ¶¶ 44, 194.] The court acknowledges
the conclusive nature of the pleading, but declines to engage in qualitative
distinction given the sufficiency of the elements. (Bird v. Saenz, supra, 28 Cal.4th at p. 916.)

 
The demurrer is overruled as to this cause of action.
 
 
Motion to Strike: Granted.
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and Cedars-Sinai Health System
move to strike the punitive damages allegations. Plaintiffs agree to strike the
claims as to the subject defendants, and the parties will present a
stipulation. The court grants the motion to strike.
 
 
In summary, the demurrer of Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and
Cedars-Sinai Health System is overruled as to the challenge of Cedars-Sinai
Health System and the negligent infliction of emotional distress cause of
action, and sustained with leave to amend as to the negligent misrepresentation
cause of action. The motion to strike is granted; the parties may present the
stipulation as to the existing or any potential amended pleadings. 
 
The court normally grants 30 days leave to amend on a first
demurrer. A demurrer brough by the Medtronic defendants remains set for October
3, 2024. Any first amended complaint potentially rendering the next demurrer
moot would be required at the time of the opposition due date, which is
September 19, 2024 (September 27, 2024, is a court holiday). (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 472.) The filing of any amended complaint following the lapse of the
opposition date can still require a ruling on the submitted demurrer, which the
court will consider in future rulings should the pled complaint limit reach a
third amended pleading. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (e)(1).) The moving
parties may request a continuance of the October 3, 2024, demurrer, but the
court otherwise leaves the hearing date as scheduled. 
 
Defendants Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and Cedars-Sinai
Health System to give notice to all parties.
