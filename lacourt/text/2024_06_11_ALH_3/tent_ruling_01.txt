I.           
INTRODUCTION 
This action
was originally filed by plaintiff Universal Shopping Plaza (“Plaintiff”) on
November 30, 2022, as an unlawful detainer regarding the commercial real
property located at 140 West Valley Blvd. #222, San Gabriel, California 91776
(“Premises”) against defendant Vege Paradise Restaurant Inc. (“Defendant”). 
Defendant
vacated the Premises, which converted the action to a civil case for damages.
Therefore, on March 16, 2023, Plaintiff filed the operative First Amended
Complaint (“FAC”) which added Scott Huang (“Huang”) (Vege and Scott Huang
collectively referred to as “Defendants”) as a guarantor and plead two causes
of action against Defendants: 1) Breach of Lease; 2) Breach of Guaranty.
On February
13, 2024, Plaintiff filed this unopposed motion for summary judgment. 
II.         
LEGAL STANDARD
In reviewing a motion for summary
judgment, courts must apply a three-step analysis: “(1) identify the issues
framed by the pleadings; (2) determine whether the moving party has negated the
opponent’s claims; and (3) determine whether the opposition has demonstrated
the existence of a triable, material factual issue.” (Hinesley v. Oakshade Town Center (2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 289, 294.)
Summary judgment is granted when, after the Court’s consideration of the
evidence set forth in the papers and all reasonable inferences accordingly, no
triable issues of fact exist and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a
matter of law. (CCP
§ 437c(c); Villa
v.¿McFarren (1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 733, 741).¿¿
III.       
DISCUSSION 
Plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment
is premised on requests for admission which were deemed admitted by the Court
on September 19, 2023. “[A] deemed admitted order establishes, by judicial
fiat, that a nonresponding party has responded to the requests by admitting the
truth of all matters contained therein.” (Wilcox
v. Birtwhistle (1999) 21 Cal.4th 973, 979.) Requests for admissions
“differs fundamentally from the other five discovery tools (depositions,
interrogatories, inspection demands, medical examinations, and expert witness
exchanges) . . . [because] admission requests seek to eliminate the need for proof: ‘The purpose of the admissions
procedure . . . is to limit the triable issues and spare the parties the burden
and expense of litigating undisputed issues.’ Sometimes, the admissions
obtained will even leave the party making them vulnerable to summary
judgment.”  [Citations.]  Matters that are admitted or deemed admitted
through RFA discovery devices are conclusively established in the litigation
and are not subject to being contested through contrary evidence. [Citation.]”
(St. Mary v. Superior Court (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 762, 775.)
“The standard elements of a claim for
breach of contract are: ‘(1) the contract, (2) plaintiff’s performance or
excuse for nonperformance, (3) defendant’s breach, and (4) damage to plaintiff
therefrom.’” (Wall Street Network, Ltd. v. New York Times Co. (2008) 164
Cal.App.4th 1171, 1178.) Based on the deemed admissions, Plaintiff has shown
that there are no triable issues of material fact. 
It is undisputed that Plaintiff and Defendant
entered into a lease for the Premises (“Lease”). (UMF No. 2.) Plaintiff
fulfilled all of its obligations under the Lease. (UMF No. 17.) Defendant
breached its contractual obligations under the Lease by failing to timely pay
rent due under said contract. (UMF No. 11.) Further, Defendant failed to repair
and decommission the Premises in accordance to the Lease when it moved out,
thus requiring Plaintiff to incur additional expenses billed to Defendant
pursuant to the Lease. (UMF No. 10.) These repairs were charged to Defendant in
accordance with Civil Code Section 1950.7. (UMF No. 10.) Therefore, as a direct
and proximate result of Defendant’s breach, Plaintiff has suffered damages
totaling $177,643.99 and prejudgment interest of $29,196.00 for a total
judgment of $206,839.99. (UMF No. 15.) Defendant has admitted it owes at least
$205,000.00 to Plaintiff. (UMF No. 13.) Defendant has also admitted it has no
valid defenses to the present case. (UMF No. 19.)
With respect to Huang, it is undisputed
that Huang executed a guaranty in connection with the Lease whereby he
personally guaranteed all financial obligations of Defendant under the Lease
(“Guaranty”). (UMF No. 3.) The terms of the Guaranty set forth Huang’s
obligation to pay any sums due under the Lease in the event Defendant failed to
do so. (UMF No. 3.) Plaintiff fulfilled all of its obligations under the
Guaranty, but Huang breached the Guaranty by failing to timely pay all rent and
other charges owed by Defendant pursuant to the Lease. (UMF Nos. 12, 17.) Huang
owes at least $205,000.00 pursuant to the Guaranty because as a direct and
proximate result of Defendant’s breach, Plaintiff has suffered damages totaling
$177,643.99 and prejudgment interest of $29,196.00 for a total judgment of
$206,839.99. (UMF Nos. 14,15.) Huang has also admitted he has no valid defenses
to the present case. (UMF No. 20.)
VI.    CONCLUSION
          In light of
the foregoing, the Plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment is GRANTED.
Moving party to give notice.  
Dated this 11th
day of June
