Defendant/cross-complainant Shirley A.
Miller (“Miller”) seeks a default judgment against cross-defendant Xiaoye Zhang
(“Zhang”) in this interpleader action filed by plaintiff Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.

Miller’s proposed judgment incorrectly
states that the judgment is on the complaint, rather than Miller’s
cross-complaint. Nevertheless, the Court interlineates the proposed judgment to
indicate the correct pleading and enters default judgment in favor of Miller.
The Clerks is ordered to release the interpleaded funds and disburse the funds
via check to Miller’s counsel, mailed to Grant | Shenon, A Professional Law
Corporation, at 15165 Ventura Blvd. Suite 200, Sherman Oaks, CA 91403.
