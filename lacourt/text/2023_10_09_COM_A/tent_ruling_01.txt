[TENTATIVE]
ORDER DENYING
 THE PETITION FOR CHANGE OF NAME
 
Petitioner filed this Petition on January
 30, 2023, for an Order for Change of Name to Lizeth
 Margarita Bonilla Dominguez to add her mother’s last name. As Petitioner
is a minor, a Criminal History Assessment is not required. However, the
Petition was signed by only one parent, and there is no indication that the
other parent was served with the Order to Show Cause.
The Court continued this hearing twice
to permit Petitioner to serve the other parent with the order to show cause and
to publish the order to show cause for the required time period. The Court’s
file does not reflect that Petitioner complied with the May 11 or August 24, 2023,
orders.
           Accordingly, the
petition is DENIED.
