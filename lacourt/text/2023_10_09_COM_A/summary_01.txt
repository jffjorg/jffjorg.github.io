Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling to deny the petition for a name change filed by Lizeth Margarita Bonilla, a minor, to add her mother's last name. The petition was filed on January 30, 2023, and the court issued an Order to Show Cause, which was not served on the other parent. Despite the court's orders to continue the hearing twice to permit service of the Order to Show Cause, the petition was not complied with. As a result, the petition is denied.
