Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has considered the demurrer and motion to strike filed by Caltrans, and the demurrer filed by HACLA. The Court finds that petitioners do not qualify as "occupants" or "tenants" under the Roberti Act because they do not have a lease with Caltrans. The Court also finds that petitioners waived their right to assert claims under the Roberti Act by signing PTUAs. The Court concludes that the PTUAs are not underground regulations prohibited by the Administrative Procedure Act.

The Court sustains the demurrer filed by Caltrans and HACLA, and denies the motion to strike filed by Caltrans. The Court also sustains the demurrer filed by HACLA. The Court does not address the other arguments raised by Caltrans and HACLA.

The Court finds that all of petitioners' causes of action are based on the Roberti Act, and none survive the demurrer. The Court does not grant leave to amend the petition.
