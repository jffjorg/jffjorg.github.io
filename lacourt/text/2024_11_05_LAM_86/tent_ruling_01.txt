Real Party in Interest.
 


 




 


 


 


 



Petitioner
Jason J. Bemowski petitions for a writ of mandate directing respondent
California Public Employees’ Retirement System to accept petitioner’s
application for industrial disability retirement. 
 
I.       Factual Background
 
A.          
Public
Employees’ Retirement Law
 
Respondent
California Public Employees’ Retirement System (“CalPERS”) “is a unit of the
Government Operations Agency responsible for administering the retirement
systems for the State of California and ‘contracting agencies’—local public
agencies that have ‘elected to have all or part of [their] employees become
members of this system and that ha[ve] contracted with [CalPERS] for that
purpose.’” (Marzec v. California Public Employees Retirement System
(2015) 236 Cal.App.4th 889, 896, citing Gov. Code §§ 20001, 20002, 20004,
20022, 20028.)[1]

 
Pursuant
to the Public Employees’ Retirement Law (“PERL”), the
Board of Administration of the California Public Employees’ Retirement System
(“Board”) manages
and controls pensions for public employees. (Gov. Code § 20120-20122.) “The
board shall determine who are employees and is the sole judge of the conditions
under which persons may be admitted to and continue to receive benefits under
this system.” (§ 20125.) Subject to the PERL, “the board shall determine and
may modify benefits for service and disability.” (§ 20123.) 
 
“When
it is established that a member of PERS ‘is incapacitated physically or
mentally for the performance of his or her duties in the state service and is eligible
to retire for disability, the [Board of Administration of the Public Employees
Retirement System] shall immediately retire [the member] for disability….’” (Haywood
v. American River Fire Protection Dist. (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 1292, 1303,
quoting Gov. Code § 21156.) “Incapacity for performance of duty” means “disability
of permanent or extended duration, which is expected to last at least 12
consecutive months or will result in death, as determined by the board, or in
the case of a local safety member by the governing body of the contracting
agency employing the member, on the basis of competent medical opinion.” (Gov.
Code § 20026.) Disability pension laws are designed to help employees who are
medically unable to perform their usual duties, not those who are unwilling to
maintain the standards of public service. (Haywood, 67 Cal.App.4th at
1304.) Disability pension laws “are not intended to require an employer to
pension-off an unwilling employee in order to maintain the standards of public
service.” (Id. at 1304-05.)
 
B.          
Petitioner’s
Employment, Arrest, and Discipline
 
Petitioner
was employed by real party City of Chino (“City”) as a Police Officer,
effective December 24, 2001. (AR 17.)[2]
His highest rank at the time of his termination was Police Sergeant. (AR 97.) By
virtue of his employment, he is a local safety member of CalPERS subject to
Government Code sections 21154 and 21156. 
 
In
January 2019, the Roseville Police Department initiated a criminal
investigation of petitioner based on an allegation that, on December 23, 2018, he
engaged a minor to perform acts of prostitution. (AR 99, 121-24.) After a
two-month investigation, on March 7, 2019, petitioner was arrested and booked
at San Bernadino County Central Jail for violations of Penal Code sections
261.5, subdivision (a), unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor, and 647,
subdivision (b), prostitution. (AR 99.)
 
On
the day of his arrest, the City served petitioner with a Notice of Relief from 
Duty.
This Notice stated, in relevant part: 
 
You
are immediately relieved from duty as a City employee and pending the results
of an investigation for acts, or failures to act, which may be grounds for
disciplinary action. The relieving of an employee from duty is not a
disciplinary action. You will be on a Leave of Absence, with pay, for purposes
of salary, benefits and service time, until further notice. (AR 82, 646.) 
 
On
March 11, 2019, the City issued a memorandum advising petitioner that he was
the subject of a personnel complaint. This memorandum notified petitioner: “[T]he
investigation being conducted concerning allegations that you have engaged in
conduct that, if found true, could violate sections of the Chino Police
Department [“Chino PD”] Operations Manual….” (AR 84.) Petitioner acknowledged
receipt of this memorandum on March 13, 2019. (AR 206 [HT 44:13-15].) 
 
On
September 17, 2019, the City’s Chief of Police issued a Notice of Intent to
Discipline (“Notice of Intent”), advising petitioner of the City’s intent to
terminate his employment. The Notice of Intent alleged eight separate grounds
for discipline, six of which were sustained. The sustained grounds included
violations of Chino PD Manual policies regarding conduct, performance, and
discriminatory harassment. The Notice of Intent cited petitioner’s alleged
commission of criminal sex acts with a minor on December 23, 2018, as well as his
alleged inappropriate communications with other Chino PD personnel, as acts in
support of the proposed termination. (AR 90-95.) Petitioner acknowledged
receipt of the memorandum on September 17, 2019. (AR 95.) 
 
On
October 1, 2019, the City’s Chief of Police issued a Notice of Discipline,
which stated, in part: 
 
On
September 17, 2019, I issued you a Notice of Intent to Discipline wherein I
informed you of my intent to terminate you from your position. You received
this notice on September 17, 2019. The Notice of Intent contained the specific
grounds and bases for the issuance of this level of discipline. Additionally,
the Notice provided you with information on how to exercise your procedural
rights pursuant to Skelly v. State Personnel Board (1975) 15 Cal.3d 194.
At your request, the Skelly meeting was scheduled for October 1, 2019.
On September 30, 2019, your attorney, Mr. Goldwasser informed me via email that
you would not be appearing for the prescheduled October 1, 2019 Skelly meeting.
As a result, you have waived your right to appeal at the Skelly level.
Therefore, please consider this notice of the Department’s decision to sustain
the termination, effective today October 1, 2019. (AR 97, 647-48.)


 
C.          
Application
for Industrial Disability Retirement
 
While
on administrative leave, petitioner filed a workers compensation claim and
applied for industrial disability retirement (“IDR”). He filed his workers’
compensation claim against the City on March 11, 2019, asserting that he had
suffered dislocated shoulders and lower back pain since October 2002. (AR 88.)
On April 3, 2019, petitioner applied for IDR based on his alleged left and
right shoulder dislocations and back injury. (AR 51-63.) In November 2019,
CalPERS received the October 1, 2019 notice of petitioner’s termination. (AR 22,
97.) 
 
On
December 4, 2019, both petitioner and the City were notified of CalPERS’
determination to cancel petitioner’s application for IDR based on the City’s
termination of his employment. (AR 65.) CalPERS asserted that petitioner’s IDR
application was barred by operation of law based on Haywood v. American
River Fire Protection. District (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 1292; Smith v.
City of Napa (2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 194; In the Matter of the
Application for Industrial Disability Retirement of Robert Vandergoot (2013)
CalPERS Precedential Decision 13-01 (Vandergoot); and In the Matter
of Accepting the Application for Industrial Disability Retirement of Phillip D.
MacFarland (2016) CalPERS Precedential Decision 16-01 (MacFarland).
 
D.          
Administrative
Proceeding
 
Petitioner
filed a timely appeal and requested an administrative hearing, which was
limited to the issue of “whether respondent Bemowski is eligible for disability
retirement based on an orthopedic (bilateral shoulders, back) condition, or
whether his eligibility for industrial disability retirement is precluded by
operation of Haywood and Smith.” (AR 26.) That hearing was held
on July 26, 2021, and the Proposed Order of Administrative Law Judge (“ALJ”)
Ji-Lan Zang was made on August 26, 2021. (AR 163, 264.) At the November 17,
2021 CalPERS Board Meeting, the Board remanded the case back to ALJ Zang for
consideration of further evidence. (AR 312, 317.) The State Agency Request to
Set Remand Hearing was filed on January 7, 2022. (AR 364.) 
 
Following
the Board’s rejection of an initial Proposed Decision that granted petitioner’s
appeal based on inapplicable case law, the matter proceeded to a remand hearing
on October 25, 2022. At the hearing on remand, Lieutenant Brian Cauble from the
Chino PD testified. Lieutenant Cauble was part of the Chino PD Professional
Standards Unit at the time of petitioner’s arrest, placement on administrative
leave, and termination, and was personally involved in the investigation into petitioner’s
misconduct. Lieutenant Cauble testified about various emails and other
documents reviewed during petitioner’s personnel investigation. (AR 511-40,
649-51.) Lieutenant Cauble testified that petitioner repeatedly refused to
participate in the personnel investigation into his misconduct. He also
testified that petitioner refused to attend an investigatory interview and did
not show up at his arbitration hearing. (See AR 544.) Lieutenant Cauble
confirmed that the City did not fire petitioner due to a disabling medical
condition or to preempt an otherwise valid claim for disability retirement. Petitioner
was fired because of his misconduct. (AR 651.) 
 
In
an affidavit dated September 14, 2020, Nancy Franklin, police sergeant at the
Chino Police Department, Professional Standards Unit, stated that petitioner
was permanently separated from the City effective October 1, 2019. (AR 79.)
Sergeant Franklin further declared that the City’s decision to terminate petitioner
was based entirely on the Notice of Intent and its supporting facts. She
reiterated that the City “did not terminate [petitioner] as a result of any
alleged disabling medical condition, or to prevent or preempt [petitioner] from
filing a claim for disability retirement.” (AR 79.)
 
Petitioner
also testified at the hearing on remand. He disputed that he delayed or avoided
participation in his personnel investigation by claiming that he was unable to
submit to an interview because he was under medical care. (AR 651.) Petitioner admitted
the conduct that ultimately led to his arrest, felony conviction, and
termination. (AR 651.) Petitioner also admitted to pleading nolo contendere to
a felony charge, which made him a convicted felon. (AR 651.) Petitioner
testified that he attempted to apply for IDR the day after his March 7, 2019,
arrest and placement on administrative leave. (AR 649.) He claimed his decision
to apply for IDR was unrelated to his arrest and placement on leave the
previous day. (AR 649 [petitioner testified that he did not receive Notice of
Intent until 9/17/19].)
 
Petitioner
emphasized that, on March 7, 2019, he was placed on administrative leave, which
is not a disciplinary action. (AR 649.) Petitioner also testified that, during
his administrative leave, he received his pay and benefits and made
contributions towards his CalPERS benefits. Petitioner testified that he did
not receive the Notice of Intent until September 17, 2019, more than five
months after he submitted his IDR application to CalPERS on April 3, 2019. The
City terminated petitioner for cause on October 1, 2019. (AR 649.)
 
Petitioner
presented a medical report prepared by Dr. Ronny G. Ghazal in his workers’
compensation claim. (AR 152-57.) Petitioner had been seen by Dr. Ghazal on May
9, 2019, and again on June 12, 2019 for a “final evaluation.” (AR 152-53.) Dr.
Ghazal prepared his declaration of his findings and recommendation in a report
dated July 16, 2019. (AR 157.) Based on his tests and observations, Dr. Ghazal
declared that petitioner could not perform his job based on his then current
physical condition and therefore he was a “Qualified Injured Worker.” (AR 156.)
Dr. Ghazal’s declaration also identified petitioner’s date of injury as March
7, 2018. (AR 152.) 
 
ALJ
Zang issued a Proposed Decision after remand denying petitioner’s appeal on
January 9, 2023. (AR 657.) The Board of Administration for CalPERS adopted the
Proposed Decision at its Board Meeting on February 14, 2023. (AR 658-60, 696.)
 
II.      Procedural History
 
            On
April 7, 2023, petitioner Jason J. Bemowski filed a Verified Petition for Peremptory
Writ of Mandate. On February 1, 2024, petitioner filed a First Amended Verified
Petition for Peremptory Writ of Mandate. On February 16, 2024, respondent California
Public Employees’ Retirement System filed an Answer. On June 24, 2024, real
party in interest City of Chino filed a Return. 
 
            On
September 5, 2024, petitioner filed an opening brief. On October 7, 2024, CalPERS
and the City both filed oppositions. On October 22, 2024, petitioner filed a
reply.       The Court has received an
electronic and hard copy of the administrative record. 
 
III.     Standard of Review
 
Under CCP § 1094.5(b),
the pertinent issues are whether the respondent has proceeded without
jurisdiction, whether there was a fair trial, and whether there was a
prejudicial abuse of discretion. An abuse of discretion is established if the
agency has not proceeded in the manner required by law, the decision is not
supported by the findings, or the findings are not supported by the evidence.
(CCP § 1094.5(b).)
 
Because the
administrative decision substantially affects a fundamental vested right, the
Court exercises its independent judgment on the record. (See Prentice
v. Board of Admin. (2007) 157 Cal.App.4th 983, 988.) “Retirement benefits
of the nature involved here have long been held to be a vested and fundamental
right.” (Molina v. Board of Admin. (2011) 200 Cal.App.4th 53, 60
[petition concerning right to receive pension benefit “in an amount specified
by law”]; O’Connor v. State Teachers’ Retirement System (1996) 43
Cal.App.4th 1610, 1620 [same].)
 
Under the independent
judgment test, “the trial court not only examines the administrative record for
errors of law, but also exercises its independent judgment upon the evidence
disclosed in a limited trial de novo.”
(Bixby, 4 Cal.3d at 143.) The court
must draw its own reasonable inferences from the evidence and make its own
credibility determinations. (Morrison v.
Housing Authority of the City of Los Angeles Board of Commissioners (2003)
107 Cal. App. 4th 860, 868.)  
 
 “In exercising its independent judgment, a
trial court must afford a strong presumption of correctness concerning the
administrative findings, and the party challenging the administrative decision
bears the burden of convincing the court that the administrative findings are
contrary to the weight of the evidence.” 
(Fukuda v. City of Angels
(1999) 20 Cal.4th 805, 817, internal quotations omitted.) When an appellant
challenges “‘the sufficiency of the evidence, all material evidence on the
point must be set forth and not merely their own evidence.” (Toigo v. Town
of Ross (1998) 70 Cal.App.4th 309, 317.) 

 
 
 
IV.     Analysis
 
            Petitioner contends that he is
entitled to disability retirement because he was a fully paid employee at the
time he applied for IDR, or alternatively, his right to disability retirement
had matured before his employment was terminated. 
 
            “[W]here…an employee is fired for
cause and the discharge is neither the ultimate result of a disabling medical
condition nor preemptive of an otherwise valid claim for disability retirement,
the termination of the employment relationship renders the employee ineligible
for disability retirement regardless of whether a timely application is filed.”
(Haywood v. American River Fire Protection Dist. (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th
1292, 1307.) This is because “disability retirement laws contemplate the
potential reinstatement of that relationship if the employee recovers and no
longer is disabled.” (Id. at 1296.) Such laws are not intended to
require an employer to pension-off an unwilling employee in order to maintain
the standards of public service. (Ibid.) 
 
However,
“if a plaintiff were able to prove that the right to a disability retirement
matured before the date of the event giving cause to dismiss, the dismissal
cannot preempt the right to receive a disability pension for the duration of
the disability.” (Smith v. City of Napa (2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 194, 206.)
“A vested right [to a disability retirement] matures when there is an
unconditional right to immediate payment.” (Ibid.) As applicable here,
the maturity date is “when the pension board determined that the employee was
no longer capable of performing his duties.” (Ibid.) In cases where there
has not been any determination of eligibility, a court could deem the right to
a disability retirement to have matured where the applicant (1) “had an
impending ruling on a claim for a disability pension that was delayed, through
no fault of his own, until after his dismissal” or (2) “was eligible for a
CalPERS disability retirement, such that a favorable decision on his claim
would have been a foregone conclusion (as perhaps with a loss of limb).” (Id.
at 207.)
 
            Here, petitioner’s employment was
terminated on October 1, 2019 due to his felony conviction. (AR 90-95, 97, 647-48.)
Further, that termination was not the result of any disabling medical condition
or any attempt to preempt a valid claim of disability retirement. Two officers
with the Chino Police Department’s Professional Standards Unit testified that petitioner
was terminated because of petitioner’s misconduct. (AR 79, 90-95, 651.) Due to
the felony conviction, petitioner could no longer serve as a police officer. (See
Gov. Code § 1029(a)(1).) Accordingly, regardless of petitioner’s paid
status at the time he applied for IDR, petitioner was not eligible for
disability retirement because his employment relationship with the City was severed.

 
            Petitioner is thus not entitled to approval
of his IDR application unless he can prove that his right to a disability
retirement matured before the termination of his employment. (Smith, 120
Cal.App.4th at 206.) Although petitioner submitted his application on April 3,
2019 (AR 51-63), which was before his termination, the CalPERS Board never
approved petitioner’s application, let alone prior to April 3, 2019. Indeed,
the Board declined to accept petitioner’s application on December 4, 2019,
after petitioner had been terminated. (AR 65.) Petitioner thus never had a
right to a disability retirement that had matured. 
 
            Petitioner fails to demonstrate any
exception to a determination of eligibility by the CalPERS Board. Petitioner has
not shown that his April 3, 2019 IDR application was delayed until after his
dismissal. Petitioner only asserts without citation to authority or evidence
that the application should have been approved by the Board before his
application was cancelled on December 4, 2019. (Reply at 2:12-16; Fukuda, 20 Cal.4th at 817 [party challenging administrative
decision bears burden of persuasion]; Evid. Code § 664 [agency is presumed to
have regularly performed its official duties].) 
 
With
respect to whether petitioner was eligible for a disability retirement such
that a favorable decision on the IDR application was a foregone conclusion,
petitioner relies on the report from Dr. Ghazal with respect to his workers’
compensation claim, wherein Dr. Ghazal stated that petitioner is a “Qualified
Injured Worker” and that the date of injury was March 7, 2018. (AR 152-59.) To
begin with, “a workers’ compensation ruling is not binding on the issue of
eligibility for disability retirement because the focus of the issues and the
parties is different.” (Smith, 120 Cal.App.4th at 207.) Unlike, for
example, the loss of a limb, petitioner’s purported shoulder and back injuries were
certainly subject to dispute as to whether they rendered him substantially unable
to perform his duties and therefore eligible for disability retirement. (Ibid.)
Accordingly, petitioner’s workers’ compensation report is insufficient to
establish an eligibility to disability retirement.  (Ibid. [finding that entitlement to
disability retirement could not rest on the plaintiff’s equivocal medical
evidence].) 
 
Petitioner
relies on Willens v. Commission on Judicial Qualifications (1973) 10
Cal.3d 451 to assert that, because he was on paid administrative leave and was
making CalPERS contributions when he applied for IDR, he is entitled to
disability retirement. In Willens, the Supreme Court held that a judge charged
for criminal conspiracy and bribery but not yet convicted may still be entitled
to disability retirement, even though the charges had resulted in automatic
disqualification from acting as a judge. (Willens, 10 Cal.3d at 456.)
The Supreme Court relied on the principle that an accused is presumed innocent
until proven guilty. (Id. at 457.) 
 
However,
Willens was based on the Judges’ Retirement Law (id. at 456-57),
whereas petitioner is subject to PERL as a local safety member.  As observed by the Court of Appeal, Willens
“turns on peculiarities of the office of judge.” (Smith, 120
Cal.App.4th at 204.)  Notably, the
California Constitution explicitly provided that indicted judges are entitled
to keep their salary, which includes retirement benefits, while the charges are
pending. (Willens, 10 Cal.3d at 456, citing Cal. Const., art. VI,
§ 18, sub. (a).) By contrast, petitioner can point to no similar provision
for other public employees. Moreover, the judge in Willens presented
evidence of physical and emotional disabilities at the time of his IDR
application. (Willens, 10 Cal.3d at 455.) Here, by contrast, for the
reasons stated above, petitioner has presented insufficient evidence to
establish that he would have been granted disability retirement. Petitioner’s
citation to Willens is thus unavailing. 
 
            Based on the foregoing, petitioner
fails to meet his burden to demonstrate an abuse of discretion in CalPERS’
decision not to accept petitioner’s application for industrial disability
retirement.
 
V.      Conclusion
 
The petition is DENIED. Pursuant to Local Rule
3.231(n), respondent California
Public Employees’ Retirement System shall prepare, serve, and ultimately file a
proposed judgment.
