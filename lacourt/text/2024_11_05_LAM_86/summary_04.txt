And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case Americredit Financial Services v. Melanie Dorfman et al. The ruling addresses an application for a writ of possession filed by Americredit Financial Services, which seeks to take possession of a 2019 Volkswagen Jetta from Melanie Dorfman and MLUX Autobody.

The judge finds that Americredit Financial Services has established a probably valid claim to possession of the vehicle, as Melanie Dorfman has defaulted in payment on the agreement and Americredit Financial Services is entitled to take possession of the vehicle.

However, the judge denies the application for a writ of possession as to Melanie Dorfman because Americredit Financial Services has failed to provide proof of service on her as required by law.

The judge grants the application for a writ of possession as to MLUX Autobody, finding that Americredit Financial Services has established probable cause that MLUX Autobody is holding the vehicle without written authorization from the registered owner, and that MLUX Autobody has waived its statutory lien on the vehicle.

The judge also finds that Americredit Financial Services is not required to provide an undertaking because the amount owed ($20,022.34) exceeds the market value of the vehicle ($13,568.00).

The judge orders that Americredit Financial Services submit a proposed order on Judicial Council form CD-120 by November 7, 2024.
