```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court is considering a demurrer filed by the defendants, Rafael Navarro and Florina Navarro, to dismiss the lawsuit filed by the plaintiffs, Vilma Carpano, Emilia Aguiluz, and Fernanda Aguiluz. The plaintiffs allege that the defendants breached the implied warranty of habitability and failed to correct substandard conditions in the property located at 598 East 11th Street, Pomona, California 91766.

The court finds that the doctrine of res judicata does not apply, as the previous unlawful detainer action did not address the breach of the implied warranty of habitability. Additionally, the court denies the defendants' argument that the minor plaintiffs lack standing to sue because they are not parties to the lease agreement.

The court also determines that Ms. Navarro is properly joined as a defendant in this action, despite the defendants' argument that she is misjoined. The court notes that the allegations of the Complaint may be liberally constructed to establish that the plaintiffs were tenants at the property prior to January 2020.

Finally, the court rules that the demurrer is overruled, and the defendants are ordered to serve and file their Answer to the Complaint within 10 days of the date of this order.
