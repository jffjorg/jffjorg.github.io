And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to set aside default and remove to federal court. The motion is granted in part, and the defaults entered on March 8, 2024, and March 26, 2024, are vacated. The judge finds that the defaults were entered based on ineffective service, and the service of process was defective. The judge also finds that the Attorney General was not properly served, and that the service was not made at an official office of the Attorney General. The judge grants the motion to set aside default and remove to federal court, and the defaults are vacated. The motion to advance default judgment hearing under the Trading With The Enemy Act is moot.
