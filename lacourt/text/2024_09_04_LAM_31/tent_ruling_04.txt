DEFENDANTS’
MOTION FOR ORDER SETTING ASIDE DEFAULT BASED UPON DEFECTIVE NOTICE, AND REMOVAL
TO FEDERAL COURT
 
PLAINTIFF’S
MOTION TO ADVANCE DEFAULT JUDGMENT HEARING UNDER THE TRADING WITH THE ENEMY ACT



 
 
I.          INTRODUCTION
 
On December 12, 2023, Plaintiff Sophia Henry, a
self-represented litigant, filed this action against Defendants Rob Bonta,
acting as California Attorney General for the State of California (“Bonta”),
Ana M. Lasso, acting as Director of Department of General Services Office of
Risk and Insurance Management for State of California (“Lasso”), the State of
California (the “State”), Employment Development Department (“EDD”), and Paid
Family Leave Office—Fresno (“PFLO”) (collectively, “Defendants”), arising from the
denial of Plaintiff’s Paid Family Leave claim. 
Plaintiff seeks relief for alleged wrongdoing on the basis that she is
“under consular jurisdiction pursuant to Treaty Law as Bloodright Heir by
Blood, Deed, Creed, and Custom to: i) Treaty of Peace with Morocco of 1787/1836
(signed at Meccanez; copy at Tangiers) between the United States of North
America and Moroccan Empire, which is in full force and effect under Article 25
of the Treaty of Peace and Friendship of 1836, and the organic Constitution for
the United States of North America.” 
Based on those rights, Plaintiff alleges she was entitled to, and
wrongfully denied, benefits in the amount of “Three Thousand Four Hundred
Eighty ($3,480.00) Dollars.” 
 
Based on her treaty rights, Plaintiff further alleges that Defendants
“are responsible in some manner for the claimed tortious interference with
Trade and Commerce by irreparable injury to Plaintiff through: i) economic
hardship / mental anxiety / psychological and emotional distress caused by
failure / refusal or delay to make payment under an insurance policy; ii) bad
faith; iii) wrongfully disqualifying benefits; iv) wrongfully subjecting
insured to biased claims handling; v) wrongfully withdrawing benefits due; vi)
adopting an inconsistent position in refusing claim; vii) breach of contract;
viii) breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing by failure to
investigate claim; ix) violation of California Insurance Code § 790.035; x)
violation of California Labor Code § 5814; xi) violation of California Civil
Code § 3294; and xii) violation of 15 § U.S.C. § 1; 15 U.S.C. § 2; 15 U.S.C. § 45;
15 U.S.C. § 1125; 19 U.S.C. § 1592.”  
 
Before the court are two motions: (1) Defendants’ Motion for
Order Setting Aside Default Based Upon Defective Notice, and Removal to Federal
Court, and (2) Plaintiff’s Motion to Advance Default Judgment Hearing Under the
Trading With The Enemy Act (TWEA). 
Because Defendants’ Motion is meritorious for the reasons discussed
herein, the court does not reach Plaintiff’s Motion to Advance.
 
II.        DEFENDANTS’
MOTION FOR ORDER SETTING ASIDE DEFAULT
 
A.   
Relevant
Background
 
Plaintiff commenced this action on December 12, 2023.  On the same day, Plaintiff filed proofs of
service indicating each Defendant was served on a purportedly authorized agent
for service of process named “Ivan,” an EDD Employee., at 888 Figueroa St., #
200, Los Angeles, CA 90017 (the “Figueroa Address”).  EDD, the State, and PFLO were served at 855 M.
Street, Ste 810, Fresno, CA 93721 (“M. Street”).  Bonta was served at 2550 Mariposa Mall, Room
5090, Fresno, CA 93721.  
 
On December 14, 2023, Plaintiff filed additional proofs of
service indicating that EDD, Bonta, the State, and Lasso were served at the Figueroa
Address.  PFLO was again served at M.
Street.  Plaintiff filed what appears to
be duplicate proofs of service of December 14, 2023.
 
            On February
21, 2024, Plaintiff filed two motions: (1) Motion for An Order Establishing
Admissions and for Sanctions, and (2) Motion for Order Compelling Answers to
Interrogatories and for Sanctions (collectively, “Discovery Motions.”). 
The Discovery Motions were asserted against all Defendants.  The hearing
was scheduled for May 3, 2024.
 
On March 8, 2024, Plaintiff filed identical proofs of
service of December 14, 2023.  On the
same day, the clerk of the court entered default against the State, EDD, and
PFLO.  
 
            On March
14, 2024, Defendant specially appeared to object to service.  
 
On March 21, 2024, and March 26, 2024, Plaintiff filed
identical proofs of service of December 14, 2023 as to Lasso and Bonta.
 
            On March 26, 2024, the clerk of the
court entered default against Bonta and Lasso. 

 
On May 3, 2024, Defendant specially appeared at the hearing
for Plaintiff’s Discovery Motions. 
Defendant learned for the first time that default had been entered
against all Defendants.
 
On July 8, 2024, Defendants filed this Motion for Order
Setting Aside Default Based Upon Defective Notice, and Removal to Federal Court.  The motion is accompanied by a proposed
Notice of Removal and Answer.
 
The motion is unopposed.[1]
 
B.    
Analysis
 
Defendants argue that, under Code of Civil Procedure section
585.5, it is mandatory for the court to set aside the default and remove this action
to federal court.
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 585.5 states, in relevant
part:
 
(a) Every application to enter default under
subdivision (a) of Section 585 shall include, or be accompanied by, an
affidavit stating facts showing that the action is or is not subject to Section
1812.10 or 2984.4 of the Civil Code or subdivision (b) of Section 395.  
 
(b) When a default or default judgment has been entered
without full compliance with Section 1812.10 or 2984.4 of the Civil Code, or
subdivision (b) of Section 395,[2]
the defendant may serve and file a notice of motion to set aside the default or
default judgment and for leave to defend the action in the proper court. The
notice of motion shall be served and filed within 60 days after the defendant
first receives notice of levy under a writ of execution, or notice of any other
procedure for enforcing, the default judgment.
 
(c) A notice of motion to set aside a default or
default judgment and for leave to defend the action in the proper court shall
designate as the time for making the motion a date prescribed by subdivision
(b) of Section 1005, and it shall be accompanied by an affidavit showing under
oath that the action was not commenced in the proper court according to Section
1812.10 or 2984.4 of the Civil Code or subdivision (b) of Section 395. The
party shall serve and file with the notice a copy of the answer, motion, or
other pleading proposed to be filed in the action.
 
(d) Upon a finding by the court that the motion was
made within the period permitted by subdivision (b) and that the action was not
commenced in the proper court, it shall set aside the default or default
judgment on such terms as may be just and shall allow such a party to defend
the action in the proper court.
 
 Here, Defendants’
motion does not comply with Section 585.5. 
Specifically, the motion is not accompanied by an affidavit showing
under oath that this action was not commenced in the proper court according to
Section 1812.10 or 2984.4 of the Civil Code or subdivision (b) of Section 395.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 585.5, subd. (c).)  The default may not be set aside pursuant to
Section 585.5. 
            
            Alternatively, Defendants argue they are entitled to relief
under Code of Civil Procedure section 473 because they were never served with
the summons and complaint.  The court
agrees.  
 
“Section 473(b) provides for both discretionary and
mandatory relief.” (Pagnini v. Union Bank, N.A. (2018) 28 Cal.App.5th
298, 302.) An application for relief under this section must be made no more
than six months after entry of the judgment, dismissal, order, or other
proceeding from which relief is sought and must be accompanied by an affidavit
of fault attesting to the mistake, inadvertence, surprise or neglect of the
moving party or its attorney.  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 473, subd. (b); English v. IKON Business Solutions (2001) 94
Cal.App.4th 130, 143.)  Relief under this
section is mandatory when based on an attorney affidavit of fault; otherwise,
it is discretionary. (Id.) 
 
Here, Defendants establish the defaults were entered based
on ineffective service.  Plaintiff’s
proofs of service indicate that a person named “Ivan” was served on behalf of
Defendants on December 12, 2023 and December 14, 2023 at the Figueroa Address.  This alleged service is defective for two
reasons.  
 
First, under California law, Plaintiff must serve a summons
on the Attorney General for all actions against the state. (Gov. Code § 955.4,
subd. (a).)  Service of documents against
the Attorney General and a public agency must be made to the proper person in
the proper place. (Code Civ. Proc. § 473.) California Rules of Court require
that service be made on the Attorney General when a suit is brought against a
state officer in his or her official capacity.  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 8.29(c).) However,
the Attorney General may only be sued by serving the papers on the Attorney
General personally, or at an official office. 
None of the addresses alleged by Plaintiff are official offices of the
Attorney General.  (Emmons Decl. ¶ 2.) 
 
Second, Defendants submit the Declaration of Ivan Jones III
to establish that Mr. Jones is the only person named “Ivan” at the Figueroa
Address and further, that he was not working at the Figueroa Address on either
December 12, 2023 or December 14, 2023.  (Jones
III Decl., ¶¶ 3-4.)  Plaintiff could not
have served Mr. Jones.  Further, even if
Plaintiff had served Mr. Jones, he is not the authorized agent for service of
process for any defendant.  (Emmons
Decl., ¶ 2.)  
            
III.      CONCLUSION
 
Accordingly, Defendants’ unopposed Motion for Order Setting
Aside Default and Removal to Federal Court is GRANTED IN PART.  The defaults entered on March 8, 2024, and
March 26, 2024 are VACATED pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 473.  
 
Given that the court has set aside the defaults, Defendants
motion for removal is MOOT at this time.  
 
            Plaintiff’s
Motion to Advance Default Judgment Hearing Under the Trading With The Enemy Act
(TWEA) is MOOT. [3]
 
Defendants to give notice.
