[1] The parties argue over the
application of the case Landeros v. Pankey (1995) 39 Cal.App.4th 1167.  Landeros is inapposite.  There, two tenants leased a house for a
period of three years, beginning in 1989. (Id. at p. 1170.) The
landlords initiated an unlawful detainer action alleging a failure to pay rent
for two months in 1992. (Ibid.) The action was resolved by a stipulated
judgment based on a written agreement that was narrowly confined to the action
and which lacked “any comprehensive language typically employed to indicate a
settlement of any and all issues in dispute.” (Id. at p. 1171.) Later,
the tenants sued their landlord for breach of the warranty of habitability,
alleging the house was unsafe and defect-ridden during the entire period they
occupied it. (Id. at p. 1169.) The trial court sustained a demurrer to
their complaint without leave to amend on the ground that collateral estoppel
arising from the judgment in the unlawful detainer action barred the
action.  (Landeros, supra, 39
Cal.App.4th at p. 1170.)  The
appellate court reversed, concluding that the collateral estoppel effect of the
judgment could not be determined in the context of a demurrer, as “[a] prior
stipulated or consent judgment is subject to construction as to the parties'
intent.” (Id., at p. 1172.)  Unlike
Landeros, the prior unlawful detainer action was resolved by judgment after
a non-jury trial on the merits. There is no stipulated judgment subject to
construction of the parties’ intent.
