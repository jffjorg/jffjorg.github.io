And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling discusses the motion for attorneys' fees filed by the plaintiff, Gloria Ford, in the case 20STCV43619. The case is related to a property dispute between Ford and the defendant, Corina Sullivan. The court previously issued a Final Statement of Decision and entered Judgment. Ford is seeking attorneys' fees under Code of Civil Procedure sections 874.010(a) and 874.040. The court finds that Ford's request for attorneys' fees is not apportioned by interest in the property and that Ford has not sufficiently broken down why under equity that 100% of Ford's legal fees should be borne by Sullivan instead of in proportion to the parties' interests. The court is inclined to consider additional briefing by Sullivan and permits Ford to file an additional brief addressing the sur-reply. The motion for attorneys' fees is continued to February 9, 2024, and Ford is to give notice and file proof of service of any additional brief.
