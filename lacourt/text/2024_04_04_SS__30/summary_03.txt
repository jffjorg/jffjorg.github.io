And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling by the Judge grants Plaintiff Marvin Amaya's motion to compel responses to special interrogatories. The Defendant, Jonatan Villalobos, is ordered to provide responses without objection to the Plaintiff's request for special interrogatories, set one, within 20 days of the order. The Judge also denies the Plaintiff's request for sanctions.

The Plaintiff propounded Form Interrogatories, Set One, on the Defendant on January 15, 2024, and responses were due on February 17, 2024. However, the Defendant failed to provide responses. The Court finds that the Plaintiff is entitled to a court order directing the Defendant to provide verified responses without objections to the discovery requests served on the Defendant.

The Plaintiff sought sanctions against the Defendant, but the Judge denied the request, citing that Code of Civil Procedure ยง 2030.290(c) mandates the imposition of sanctions only when the motion was unsuccessfully opposed, and the motion was not opposed. The Judge also denied the Plaintiff's request for sanctions under CCP section 2023.010 for the misuse of discovery, citing a previous case that states that "sections 2023.010 and 2023.030 do not independently authorize the trial court to impose monetary sanctions for misuse of discovery."
