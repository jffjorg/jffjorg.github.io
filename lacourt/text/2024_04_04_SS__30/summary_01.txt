The cross-complaint seeks express indemnity, equitable indemnity, and declaratory relief based on the same occurrence as the underlying complaint. The judge finds that the cross-complaint is compulsory because it arises out of the same transaction as the underlying complaint. The defendant did not act in bad faith in filing the cross-complaint, and therefore the motion must be granted. The defendant is ordered to file and serve the proposed cross-complaint within 10 days of the hearing on this motion.
