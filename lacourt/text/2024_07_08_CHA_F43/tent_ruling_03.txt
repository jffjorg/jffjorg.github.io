SUMMARY
OF ACTION
Plaintiff
John Labidi (Plaintiff) seeks to recover the property located at 17011 Gledhill
Street, Northridge, CA 91325. The property is a single family dwelling. On
January 30, 2024, Defendant Don Bratton (Defendant) was served with a Three-Day
Notice to Pay Rent or Quit. The Three-Day Notice to Pay Rent or Quit was on a
form provided by the California Association of Realtors. (See Comp., Ex. 2.) At
the time the Notice was served, Defendant owed past-due rent in the amount of
$50,600.00. 
 
In
Plaintiff’s complaint filed on February 5, 2024, Plaintiff alleged a cause of
action for unlawful detainer based on Defendant’s failure to pay rent or quit. 
 
Defendant
filed this motion for summary judgment on June 28, 2024. No separate statement
was filed with the motion. Defendant argues in his motion that Plaintiff does
not have a cause of action under the Los Angeles Just Cause Ordinance (LAJCO)
because the Three-Day Notice did not state the number of bedrooms in the
dwelling, as is required by the Los Angeles Municipal Code (LAMC) to bring an
action for the non-payment of rent.
 
On
July 2, 2024, an ex parte application was heard to move the hearing date up on
this motion to July 8, 2024, which is the same day as the jury trial in this
case. No opposition to the motion has been filed as of July 5, 2024.
 
ANALYSIS
The
purpose of a motion for summary judgment “is to provide courts with a mechanism
to cut through the parties’ pleadings in order to determine whether, despite
their allegations, trial is in fact necessary to resolve their dispute.”  (Aguilar
v. Atl. Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.)  “Code of Civil Procedure section 437c,
subdivision (c), requires the trial judge to grant summary judgment if all the
evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence’
and uncontradicted by other inferences or evidence, show that there is no
triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to
judgment as a matter of law.”  (Adler v. Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7
Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.)
 
The pleadings frame the issues for motions, “since it is those
allegations to which the motion must respond. (Citation.)” (Scolinos v. Kolts (1995) 37 Cal. App.
4th 635, 640-641; FPI Development, Inc. v. Nakashima
(1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 367, 382-383; Jordan-Lyon
Prods., LTD. v. Cineplex Odeon Corp. (1994) 29 Cal.App.4th 1459, 1472.)
“On a motion for summary judgment, the initial burden is always on the moving
party to make a prima facie showing that there are no triable issues of
material fact.” (Scalf v. D.B. Log Homes,
Inc. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1519.) A defendant moving for summary
judgment “has met his or her burden of showing that a cause of action has no
merit if the party has shown that one or more elements of the cause of action .
. . cannot be established.”  (CCP §
437c(p)(2).) “Once the defendant . . . has met that burden, the burden shifts
to the plaintiff . . . to show that a triable issue of one or more material
facts exists as to the cause of action or a defense thereto.” (Ibid.)
 
CCP
§ 437c(b)(1) requires that the supporting papers for a motion for summary
judgment include a separate statement: “The supporting papers shall include a
separate statement setting forth plainly and concisely all material facts that
the moving party contends are undisputed…The failure to comply with this
requirement of a separate statement may in the court’s discretion constitute a
sufficient ground for denying the motion.”
 
“Although
a party moving for summary judgment must include a separate statement that sets
forth the material facts it contends are undisputed (citation), a trial court
is not required to deny a motion simply because the moving party has not done
so and may, in its discretion, consider evidence contained elsewhere in the
motion. (Citation.) In the exercise of this discretion, the trial court should
consider whether the facts are ‘relatively simple’ and were ‘clearly called to
the attention of court and counsel’; whether ‘evidence is not referenced, is
hidden in voluminous papers, and is not called to the attention of the court at
all’; and, most importantly, whether, despite the absence of a proper separate
statement, the opposing party has sufficient notice of the evidence it must
dispute to defeat the motion. (Citation.)” (Varshock v. Department of
Forestry & Fire Protection (2011) 194 Cal.App.4th 635, review denied.)
 
While
it would be within the Court’s discretion to deny the motion for summary
judgment based on Defendant’s failure to include a separate statement, the
Court is not required to do so, and will not do so in this case. The facts in
this case are relatively simple. Defendant, in his motion, called to the
attention of the Court that the Three-Day Notice to Pay Rent or Quit attached
as Exhibit 2 to Plaintiff’s complaint did not include the number of bedrooms,
as is required by LAMC § 165.03(A).
 
LAMC
§ 165.03(A) states that a landlord may bring an action where: “The tenant has
defaulted in the payment of rent to which the landlord is entitled; provided,
however, that the landlord's right to evict a tenant lawfully in possession of
residential housing under this subsection is limited to defaults in payment
where the amount due exceeds one month of fair market rent for the Los Angeles
metro area set annually by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development
for an equivalent sized rental unit as that occupied by the tenant. The written
notice to the tenant required under Section 165.05 of this article shall state
the number of bedrooms in the tenant’s rental unit.”
 
Failure
to comply with provisions of this Article of the LAMC may be used as an
affirmative defense to eviction. (LAMC § 165.07; see also Roxbury Lane LP v.
Harris (2023) 88 Cal.App.5th Sup. 9, 15.) Furthermore, Defendant argues
that the premises is subject to LAJCO’s protections because Defendant has
continuously and lawfully occupied the premises for at least six months
pursuant to LAMC § 165.04.
 
Based
on the foregoing and the general principle that courts strictly construe the
statutory proceedings which regulate unlawful detainers (see Lamanna v.
Vognar (1993) 17 Cal.App.4th Supp. 4, 6), Defendant’s motion for summary
judgment is granted on the basis that Plaintiff’s Three-Day Notice to Pay Rent
or Quit, which is the basis for Plaintiff’s complaint, failed to comply with
the requirements of the LAMC and the LAJCO
 
CONCLUSION
The motion for summary judgment is granted.
