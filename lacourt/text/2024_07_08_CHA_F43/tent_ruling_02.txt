Minaskanian
Trial Date: N/A
 
MOTION FOR JUDGMENT ON THE PLEADINGS
 
MOVING PARTY: Plaintiff JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A.
RESPONDING PARTY: Defendant Tania Minaskanian
 
RELIEF REQUESTED
Judgment entered on behalf of Plaintiff JPMorgan Chase
Bank against Defendant.
 
RULING: The motion is granted.
 
SUMMARY OF ACTION 
Plaintiff JP Morgan Chase Bank N.A. (Plaintiff) filed
this action against Defendant Tania Minaskanian (Defendant) on November 13,
2023. This is an action for money damages from a credit card account. The
complaint filed by Plaintiff has common count causes of action including open
book account, account stated, money lent by plaintiff to defendant at defendant’s
request, for money paid, laid out, and expended to or for defendant at
defendant’s special instance and request. 
 
Defendant failed to respond to Plaintiff’s requests for
admissions served on Defendant on January 2, 2024, so on April 22, 2024, this
Court heard Plaintiff’s motion to deem requests for admissions admitted and
deemed the requests admitted. 
 
The matters that were deemed admitted were the following:
(1) Tania Minaskanian had a credit account number XXXXXXXXXXXX6239 issued by
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (for the purposes of these requests, JPMorgan Chase
Bank, N.A. shall mean and refer to JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., and/or its
predecessor, if any), (2) Tania Minaskanian received periodic statements
regarding credit account number XXXXXXXXXXXX6239 issued by JPMorgan Chase Bank,
N.A., (3) As of November 10, 2023, the balance owed by Tania Minaskanian on
credit account number XXXXXXXXXXXX6239 was $35,373.05, (4) No payments have
been made on credit account number XXXXXXXXXXXX6239 issued by JPMorgan Chase
Bank, N.A. since November 10, 2023, and (5) The last payment on credit account
number XXXXXXXXXXXX6239 issued by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. was made within the
3 years immediately prior to November 10, 2023.
 
Because these matters were deemed admitted, Plaintiff
filed this motion on June 5, 2024. In Plaintiff’s motion, Plaintiff argues that
because those matters were deemed admitted, Defendant admits the allegations
that Defendant owes the debt and has no valid affirmative defenses. Therefore,
Plaintiff argues that judgment should be granted in Plaintiff’s favor. 
 
Request for Judicial Notice: Plaintiff has requested that
the Court take judicial notice of this Court’s April 22, 2024, Minute Order
deeming Plaintiff’s requests for admissions admitted. The Court takes judicial
notice of this minute order.
 
ANALYSIS
If the moving party for judgment on the pleadings is a
plaintiff, the motion may be made on the grounds that the complaint states
facts sufficient to constitute a cause or causes of action against the
defendant and the answer does not state facts sufficient to constitute a
defense to the complaint. (CCP § 438(c)(1)(A).) The grounds for the motion must
appear on the face of the pleading or from matters that may be judicially
noticed. (CCP § 438(d).) 
 
In ruling on a motion for judgment on the pleadings, the
Court “may consider matters that may be judicially noticed, including a party’s
admissions or concessions which cannot reasonably be controverted.” (Pang v.
Beverly Hosp., Inc. (2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 986, 989-990.) CCP § 2033.410(a)
provides: “Any matter admitted in response to a request for admission is
conclusively established against the party making the admission in the pending
action, unless the court has permitted withdrawal or amendment of that admission
under Section 2033.300.”
 
It has been established, based on the admissions that were
deemed admitted, that Defendant owes Plaintiff $35,373.05 in credit card
payments. All of the elements of Plaintiff’s account stated cause of action have
been satisfied. Furthermore, the admissions establish that none of the defenses
in Defendant’s answer have merit. Judgment on the pleadings is appropriate. No
leave to amend Defendant’s answer shall be given because there is no
possibility that Defendant could cure the defect.
 
When a motion for judgment on the pleadings is granted
without leave to amend, judgment shall be entered forthwith in accordance with
the motion. (CCP § 438(h)(3).) Defendant is not being given leave to amend her
answer, so judgment is entered in favor of Plaintiff.
 
Plaintiff’s motion for judgment on the pleadings is granted
without leave to amend. Judgment is entered in favor of Plaintiff in the amount
of $35,373.05. The Court will sign the Proposed Judgment on the Pleadings that
Plaintiff filed on June 5, 2024.
