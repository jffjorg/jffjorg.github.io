And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to stay the case pending a filing in Indiana. The defendant, Thor Motor Coach, Inc., has requested that the court stay the action based on a forum selection clause in the warranty registration form and limited warranty. The clause indicates that any legal disputes based on the warranty must be heard in Indiana.

The judge has found that the forum selection clause is enforceable under California Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) ยง 410.30 and that the burden is on the plaintiff to demonstrate that the clause is unreasonable. The judge has also found that the clause is mandatory and requires the lawsuit to be filed in Indiana.

The judge has granted the motion to stay the case pending a status report showing that an action was filed in Indiana and that the defendant accepted jurisdiction and did not oppose the utilization of the Song-Beverly Act. The date for the status report will be set at the hearing on this motion.
