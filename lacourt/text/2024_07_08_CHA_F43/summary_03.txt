Significant Statements:

  - "Code of Civil Procedure section 437c, subdivision (c), requires the trial judge to grant summary judgment if all the evidence submitted, and 'all inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence' and uncontradicted by other inferences or evidence, show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." (Adler v. Manor Healthcare Corp.)
  - "The Court is not required to deny the motion for summary judgment based on Defendant's failure to include a separate statement, and will not do so in this case."
