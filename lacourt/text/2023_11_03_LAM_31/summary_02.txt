And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the defendant's motion to enforce the settlement agreement between the plaintiff and the defendant is continued to the first available date for hearing, January 23, 2024, at 9:00 a.m. The judge requires the settlement agreement to be submitted for review before making a determination as to its enforceability. The judge notes that the parties dispute whether the agreement is enforceable, whether it constitutes a settlement agreement or a settlement term sheet, and whether the parties to be bound are identified in the agreement. The judge also notes that the parties have not submitted the agreement for review, and that it is necessary to review the agreement before making a determination. Therefore, the motion is continued to allow the defendants to file the agreement.
