 Case Number:  23STCV05305    Hearing Date:   November 3, 2023    Dept:  31 TENTATIVE
 
Defendant’s demurrer
is OVERRULED. 
 
Legal Standard 
 
A demurrer for sufficiency tests
whether the complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.)
When considering demurrers, courts read the allegations liberally and in
context. (Taylor v. City of Los Angeles Dept. of Water and Power (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1216,
1228.) The court “treat[s] the demurrer as admitting all material facts
properly pleaded, but not contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law
….” (Berkley v. Dowds (2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 518, 525).) In a demurrer
proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via
proper judicial notice. (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994).)
A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic
matters; therefore, it lies only where the defects appear on the face of the
pleading or are judicially noticed. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 430.30, 430.70.) The
only issue involved in a demurrer hearing is whether the complaint, as it
stands, unconnected with extraneous matters, states a cause of action. (Hahn,
supra, 147 Cal.App.4th at 747.) 
 
Meet and Confer 
The
demurrer and motion to strike are accompanied by the declaration of Felton T. Newell, which satisfies the meet and confer
requirement. (Code Civ. Proc. § 430.41.)  
Discussion
Defendant demurs to the seventh, tenth, and eleventh causes of action
for breach of contract, unpaid overtime wages, and intentional infliction of
emotional distress. 
I.                
Seventh Cause of Action for Breach of
Contract
 
Defendant cites cases including Miller v. State of
California (Miller), 18 Cal. 3d 808 (Cal. 1977) for the proposition
that public employment in California is not held by contract but by statute. Miller
and Defendant’s other cited authorities concern employment with civil service
positions whose terms and conditions are fixed by statute in Division 5 of
Title 2 of the Government Code, beginning with section 18000.  (See
Miller, 18 Cal.3d at 811-814.)  These cases cannot be read as a
general statement that the employment of every employee who works for a public
entity in any capacity is statutory and not contractual.   
 
Defendant thus fails to demonstrate that Plaintiff’s seventh
cause of action fails because her employment was established by statute instead
of by contract.  The court therefore OVERRULES the demurrer to the seventh
causes of action.   
 
II.              
Tenth Cause of Action for Unpaid Overtime
 
Labor Code section
1194, subdivision (a), provides, “any employee receiving less than … the legal
overtime compensation applicable to the employee is entitled to recover in a
civil action….” Plaintiff’s allegation that she was not paid for overtime hours
worked is sufficient to state a cause of action for failure to pay overtime at
this stage of the pleadings. 
Defendant also argues that Plaintiff’s claims for
unpaid wages equally fails as she neglects to plead the amount of wages owed. However,
the Court does not need to resolve this argument, as a demurrer does not lie
only as to a portion of a cause of action.
If there are sufficient allegations to entitle plaintiff to relief, other allegations
cannot be challenged by general demurrer. (Daniels v. Select Portfolio
Servicing, Inc. (2016) 246 Cal.App.4th
1150, 1167; See also Sheehan v. San Francisco 49ers, Ltd.
(2009) 45 Cal.4th 992, 998 (stating that the sustaining of a demurrer may only
be upheld if the complaint fails to state a cause of action under any possible
legal theory).)
Defendant’s
demurrer as to the tenth cause of action is OVERRULED.
 
III.            
Eleventh
Cause of Action for Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress (“IIED”)
 
“The Government Claims Act ([Gov’t Code] § 810 et seq.) establishes
the limits of common law liability for public entities, stating: ‘Except as
otherwise provided by statute: [¶] (a) A public entity is not liable for an
injury, whether such injury arises out of an act or omission of the public
entity or a public employee or any other person.’  (§ 815, subd. (a),
italics added.)”  (Miklosy v Regents of Univ. of Cal. (Miklosy)
44 Cal. 4th 876, 899 (2008).)  The California Supreme Court has confirmed
that section 815 abolishes all common law tort liability for public
entities.  (Id.)   
 
Section 815 contains a number of exceptions, the most relevant
of which is section 815.2, which states: 
 
(a) A public entity is liable for injury
proximately caused by an act or omission of an employee of the public entity
within the scope of his employment if the act or omission would, apart from
this section, have given rise to a cause of action against that employee or his
personal representative. 
(b) Except as otherwise provided by
statute, a public entity is not liable for an injury resulting from an act or
omission of an employee of the public entity where the employee is immune from
liability. 
 
(Gov’t Code § 815.2.)  “The policy underlying the Act is
that liability is the rule, immunity the exception.”  (Michael J. v.
Los Angeles Cnty. Dept. of Adoptions (Michael J), 201 Cal.App.3d
859, 866-867 (1988).) 
 
Courts have recognized that the Government Claims Act does not
provide blanket immunity to a public entity on an IIED claim and that the
public entity can be held liable if the employee is not separately immune from
liability.  Compare Blanco v. Cnty. of Kings (Blanco), 142
F.Supp.3d 986, 1003-1004 (E.D. Cal. 2015) (denying a motion to dismiss where a
plaintiff had adequately pled the elements of an IIED claim against a public
employee and the defendant failed to address the issue of vicarious liability)
with Hansen v. Dep’t of Corr. & Rehab. (Hanson), 171
Cal. App. 4th 1537, 1547 (Cal. Ct. App. 2008) (finding a public entity was
immune from an IIED claim because the employee was immune from tort liability
for any acts done by the employee in preparation for formal judicial or
administrative proceedings).   
 
Plaintiff argues
that Defendant is vicariously liable for the tortious conduct of its employees
under Government Code § 815.2. Defendant argues in reply that Plaintiff has not
pled any facts to establish an individual employee is liable for IIED. However,
Defendant has not provided any authority that says the employee must be
identified at the pleading stage. The demurrer to the eleventh cause of action
for IIED is therefore OVERRULED.
Conclusion
Based on the foregoing, Defendant’s
demurrer is OVERRULED. 
Moving party is
ordered to give notice.
