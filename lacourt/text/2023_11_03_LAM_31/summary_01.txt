And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge rules that the unopposed motion for attorney fees filed by Cross-Complainants Rachel D. Son and Dennis H. Son is GRANTED. The motion is based on Paragraph 40 of the subject lease, which provides for attorney fees to the prevailing party in an amount not exceeding $1,000. The judge finds that Cross-Complainants are the prevailing party as they recovered a monetary amount and dismissal was entered in their favor. The judge also finds that the hourly rate and hours expended by Cross-Complainants' attorney, Richard P. Keavney, are reasonable. Therefore, the judge awards attorney fees in favor of Cross-Complainants and against Cross-Defendants Eva Salinas Luna and Bartolo Millan in the amount of $1,000.
