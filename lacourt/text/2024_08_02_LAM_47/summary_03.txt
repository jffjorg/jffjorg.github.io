And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the plaintiff's motion to tax trial costs and costs on appeal. The plaintiff alleged that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties to a limited liability company and seeks to recover trial costs and costs on appeal. The judge finds that the defendants are entitled to costs under Code of Civil Procedure section 1032 and that the plaintiff's challenge to these costs is without merit. The judge also finds that the plaintiff's argument that Corporations Code section 17709.02 is the exclusive basis for an award of litigation expenses is without merit. The judge concludes that the plaintiff's motion to tax costs is denied in its entirety.
