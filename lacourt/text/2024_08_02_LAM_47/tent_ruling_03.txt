Legal Standard 
 
In general, the “prevailing party” is entitled as a matter
of right to recover costs for suit in any action or proceeding. (Code Civ.
Proc. §1032(b); Santisas v. Goodin (1998) 17 Cal.4th 599, 606; Scott Co.
Of Calif. v. Blount, Inc. (1999) 20 Cal.4th 1103, 1108.)  Assuming the
“prevailing party” requirements are met, the trial court has no discretion to
order each party to bear his or her own costs of suit.  (Michell v.
Olick (1996) 49 Cal.App.4th 1194, 1198; Nelson v. Anderson (1999) 72
Cal.App.4th 111, 129.) A defendant who is dismissed from the action is the
“prevailing party.”  (Code Civ. Proc. §1032(a)(4).) This is so whether the
dismissal is voluntary or involuntary.  (Santisas, 17 Cal.4th at 606.)  
 
Allowable costs under Section 1033.5 must be reasonably
necessary to the conduct of the litigation, rather than merely convenient or
beneficial to its preparation, and must be reasonable in amount.  An item
not specifically allowable under Section 1033.5(a) nor prohibited under
subdivision (b) may nevertheless be recoverable in the discretion of the court
if they meet the above requirements (i.e., reasonably necessary and reasonable
in amount).  If the items appearing in a cost bill appear to be proper
charges, the burden is on the party seeking to tax costs to show that they were
not reasonable or necessary. (Ladas v. California State Automotive Assoc.
(1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 761, 773-774.)  On the other hand, if the items are
properly objected to, they are put in issue and the burden of proof is on the
party claiming them as costs.  (Ibid.) Whether a cost item was
reasonably necessary to the litigation presents a question of fact for the
trial court and its decision is reviewed for abuse of discretion.  (Ibid.) 
However, because the right to costs is governed strictly by statute, a court
has no discretion to award costs not statutorily authorized.  (Id.) 
Discretion is abused only when, in its exercise, the court “exceeds the bounds
of reason, all of the circumstances being considered.”  (Ibid.)   
 
Defendants’
Late Opposition
 
            Plaintiff objects to late service of
the opposition. Defendant filed and served his Opposition to this motion by
email on July 23, 2024, 8 court days before the date the motion was scheduled
to be heard. Any opposition must be served nine court days before the
date of the hearing, plus two court days if served electronically. (Code
Civ. Proc. §§ 1005(b); 1010.6.) The opposition was therefore not timely served.
However, as Plaintiff was able to file and serve a reply brief, the Court finds
that this defect in service is not prejudicial. 
 
Request for
Judicial Notice
 
            Plaintiff requests that the Court
take judicial notice of the Court’s May 18, 2016 order denying Defendants’
motion to require Plaintiff to furnish an undertaking in support of a
derivative action. Plaintiff’s request is GRANTED pursuant to Evidence Code
section 452(d) (court records). 
 
// 
Challenge to Trial Costs
 
“Any notice of motion to strike or to tax costs must be
served and filed 15 days after service of the cost memorandum. If the cost
memorandum was served by mail or email, the period is extended as provided in
Code of Civil Procedure section 1013.”  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1700(b)(1).) Plaintiff
offers no explanation of how his motion is timely with respect to trial costs
where (1) the Memorandum of Costs for trial was served on February 16, 2023;
(2) Plaintiff previously moved to tax those costs; and (3) the Court
ruled on that motion on June 30, 2023, granting that motion in part and denying
it in part. (See June 30, 2023 Minute Order.) Plaintiff’s assertion that he was
“denied due process” when the Amended Judgment was entered awarding those costs
is without merit: Plaintiff litigated the proper award of costs and secured a
partial reduction of the cost award and objected to the proposed Amended
Judgment applying that award. Those objections were overruled in their
entirety. (April 23, 2024 Minute Order.) Plaintiff is not entitled to
relitigate the Court’s ruling except by way of a renewed motion pursuant to
Code of Civil Procedure section 1008(b), with which Plaintiff makes no effort
to comply. These procedural violations are more than sufficient for the Court
to reject Plaintiff’s challenge to the trial costs. Moreover, for the reasons
stated below, Plaintiff’s challenge to both trial and appellate costs is
without substantive merit.
 
Timeliness of
Challenge to Appellate Costs. 
 
“Any notice of motion to strike or to tax costs must be
served and filed 15 days after service of the cost memorandum. If the cost
memorandum was served by mail or email, the period is extended as provided in
Code of Civil Procedure section 1013.”  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1700(b)(1).) Here, Defendants
served the memorandum of costs on appeal by electronic service on May 29, 2024.
(Memorandum of Costs POS.) 15 days plus two court days places the deadline for
this motion on June 14, 2024. This motion was filed and served on June 10,
2024.  The motion is therefore timely. 
 
Challenge to
Appellate Costs
 
            Plaintiff contends that Defendant is
not entitled to costs on appeal because, according to Plaintiff, Corporations
Code section 17709.02 is the exclusive basis for an award of litigation
expenses, including costs, in a derivative action. Subdivision (b) of that
statute authorizes a defendant in a derivative action to move for an order
requiring the plaintiff to furnish security up to $50,000 for reasonable
expenses incurred in connection with the action. (Corp. Code § 17709.02(b.) However,
as Defendant states in opposition, the weight of authority is contrary to
Plaintiff’s position. For example, in Brusso v. Running Springs Country
Club, Inc. (1991) 228 Cal.App.3d 92, the Court of Appeal rejected the
argument that the identical language in Corporations Code section 800 displaced
the right to recover fees under Civil Code section 1717. (Brusso v. Running
Springs Country Club, Inc. (1991) 228 Cal.App.3d 92, 102.) Plaintiff’s
contention that Brusso was concerned with an agreement that contained a
fees and costs provision is immaterial: the holding of Brusso is that Corporations
Code section 800 is not an exclusive remedy. As Corporations Code section
17709.02 contains identical language, that holding is equally applicable here. 
 
More directly, West Hill Farms Inc. v. RCO
Ag Credit Inc., which Plaintiff cites, expressly states that while section
800 does not provide a basis for a prevailing defendant to recover attorney’s
fees and costs in excess of the $50,000 limit, it does not limit liability for
fees and costs that are independently recoverable under a contract or another
statute. (West Hill Farms Inc. v. RCO Ag Credit Inc. (2009) 170
Cal.App.4th 710, 713 fn.3.) Freeman v. Goldberg, on which Plaintiff
principally relies, is inapposite, because our Supreme Court was only
confronted there with the issue of whether a defendant could recover attorney’s
fees where a bond was ordered, the plaintiff failed to post the bond, and the
action was dismissed on that ground. (Freeman v. Goldberg (1961) 55
Cal.2d 622, 626.) Here, in contrast, no bond was ordered, and Defendant
ultimately prevailed at trial, thus entitling him to costs under Code of Civil
Procedure section 1032(a), and on appeal, thus entitling him to costs on appeal
under Rule of Court 8.891(a)(1) and by express order of the Court of Appeal.
(April 19, 2024 Remittitur; see also Cal. Rule of Court 8.891(a)(1); Code Civ.
Proc. § 1034(b).) 
 
Plaintiff’s Corporations Code
argument is without merit as to both the trial costs and costs on appeal. As Plaintiff
offers no other basis for challenging the claimed costs, Plaintiff’s motion
must be denied in its entirety. 
 
CONCLUSION:
 
            Accordingly, Plaintiff’s Motion to
Tax Costs is DENIED.
 
            Moving party
to give notice, unless waived.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.

            Any party may submit on the
tentative ruling by contacting the courtroom via email at Smcdept47@lacourt.org by no later than 4:00 p.m. the day
before the hearing. All interested parties must be copied on the email. It
should be noted that if you submit on a tentative ruling the court will still
conduct a hearing if any party appears. By submitting on the tentative you
have, in essence, waived your right to be present at the hearing, and you
should be aware that the court may not adopt the tentative, and may issue an
order which modifies the tentative ruling in whole or in part.
