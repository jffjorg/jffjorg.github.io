  RE:

Motion to Seal Second Amended Identification of Trade Secrets and
Mottram Declaration
Plaintiff Forex Express Corp., d/b/a WireCash (“Plaintiff”) filed the
pending motion to seal on March 14, 2024, requesting that the court issue an
order sealing (1) Plaintiff’s Second Amended Identification of Trade Secrets,
lodged and received by the court on or about March 14, 2024, and (2) the “Declaration
of Geoffrey Mottram Regarding Inadequacy of Plaintiff Forex Express Corp.,
d/b/a WireCash’s Second Amended Identification of Trade Secrets” dated March 5,
2024 and filed by defendants Inter & Co. Payments, Inc. and Inter &
Co., Inc. on March 5, 2024. 
The court has not received an unredacted version of the “Declaration
of Geoffrey Mottram Regarding Inadequacy of Plaintiff Forex Express Corp.,
d/b/a WireCash’s Second Amended Identification of Trade Secrets.”  Thus, the court exercises its discretion to
continue the hearing on Plaintiff’s motion so that (1) defendants Inter &
Co. Payments, Inc. and Inter & Co., Inc. can lodge an unredacted copy of
the declaration with the court, and (2) the court can review the unredacted
version of the subject declaration to rule on Plaintiff’s motion to seal. 
The court orders that the hearing on plaintiff Forex Express Corp.,
d/b/a WireCash’s motion to seal Second Amended Identification of Trade Secrets
and Mottram Declaration is continued from May 17, 2024 to May 31, 2024, at
10:00 a.m., in Department 53. 
The court orders defendants Inter & Co. Payments, Inc. and Inter
& Co., Inc. to lodge an unredacted copy of the “Declaration of Geoffrey
Mottram Regarding Inadequacy of Plaintiff Forex Express Corp., d/b/a WireCash’s
Second Amended Identification of Trade Secrets” dated March 5, 2024 with the
court no later than May 20, 2024.
The court orders plaintiff Forex Express Corp., d/b/a WireCash to give
notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
