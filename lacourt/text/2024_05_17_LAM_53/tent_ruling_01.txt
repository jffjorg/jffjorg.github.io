MOVING PARTY:                 Plaintiff Gerardo Contreras    
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Unopposed
Motion for Approval of PAGA Settlement
The court considered
the moving papers filed in connection with this motion.  No opposition papers were filed. 
DISCUSSION
Plaintiff Gerardo Contreras (“Plaintiff”) seeks an order approving the
settlement of his claims under the Labor Code Private Attorneys General Act of
2004 (Labor Code, § 2698, et seq.) (“PAGA”), set forth in the “Individual
Labor Code Claims and PAGA Settlement Agreement” (the “Settlement”), entered
into by and between Plaintiff, on the one hand, and defendants Leon’s
Transmission Service, Inc., and John Paul Armstrong (“Defendants”) on the other
hand.  
The parties have reached a settlement of $225,000.  (Koleson Decl., Ex. 6, Settlement, ¶ 3.1.) 
Labor Code section 2699,
subdivision (l)(2) provides that “[t]he superior court shall review and approve
any settlement of any civil action pursuant to” PAGA.  The court’s review of PAGA settlements “ensur[es] that any negotiated
resolution is fair to those affected.”¿ (Williams v. Superior Court (2017)
3 Cal.5th 531, 549.)¿ In an effort to aid the court in the determination of the
fairness of the settlement, Wershba v. Apple Computer, Inc. (2001) 91
Cal.App.4th 224, 244-245 (disapproved on other grounds), discusses factors that
the court should consider when determining the reasonableness of a settlement
agreement.¿ “[A] presumption of fairness exists where: (1) the settlement is
reached through arm’s-length bargaining; (2) investigation and discovery are
sufficient to allow counsel and the court to act intelligently; (3) counsel is
experienced in similar litigation; and (4) the percentage of objectors is
small.”¿ (Id. at p. 245.)¿ “[T]he test is not the maximum amount
plaintiffs might have obtained at trial on the complaint, but rather whether
the settlement is reasonable under all of the circumstances.”¿ (Id. at
p. 250.)¿¿¿ 
The court
has reviewed (1) the terms of the Settlement, including (i) the amounts of the
gross settlement, the individual labor code claims payment to Plaintiff,
Plaintiff’s enhancement award, the PAGA payments, and the attorney’s fees and
litigation expenses, (ii) the release of claims, and (iii) the settlement
administration procedures; (2) the declaration of Plaintiff’s attorney, Jenna
Koleson, in which Koleson states that (i) the parties engaged in significant
discovery, including propounding 32 sets of discovery, taking witness
interviews, and conducting depositions, (ii) the parties engaged in two
full-day mediations on April 16, 2020 and October 12, 2022, and (iii) the
parties thereafter agreed to a global settlement on December 6, 2023; and (3)
the declaration of Plaintiff, in which Plaintiff describes his involvement in
this action.  (Koleson Decl., Ex. 6,
Settlement, ¶¶ 1.11, 1.12, 1.13, 1.16, 1.17, 1.24, 3.1-3.2.4, 5, 7; Koleson
Decl., ¶¶ 18, 6, 8-9; Contreras Decl., ¶¶ 5-8.) 
Based on the argument and evidence set forth in Plaintiff’s motion and
the declarations of Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s counsel, the court finds that the
Settlement is fair, adequate, and reasonable. 
(Wershba, supra, 91 Cal.App.th at pp. 244-245.)  The court therefore grants Plaintiff’s motion.
 
 
ORDER
            The court grants plaintiff Gerardo
Contreras’s motion for approval of PAGA settlement.
            The court will sign and file the
“[Proposed] Order and Judgment Granting Approval of PAGA Settlement,” lodged by
plaintiff Gerardo Contreras on March 7, 2024. 
            The court orders plaintiff Gerardo
Contreras to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
 
DATED:  May 17, 2024
