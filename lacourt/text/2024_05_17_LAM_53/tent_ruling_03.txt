  Order RE:
 
petition for order compelling arbitration
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                 Petitioner The Greenspan
Company a/k/a The Greenspan Co. / Adjusters International        
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Unopposed
Petition for Order Compelling Arbitration
Petitioner The Greenspan
Company, aka The Greenspan Co. / Adjusters International (“Petitioner”) filed
the pending Petition for Order Compelling Arbitration against respondents
Lavkumar Barot and Ingrid Barot (“Respondents”) on January 23, 2024. 
Thereafter, Petitioner
continued the hearing on its Petition various times.  On March 5, 2024, Petitioner filed an
“Amended Notice of Hearing on Petition for Order Compelling Arbitration,” which
stated the hearing date on the Petition to be April 10, 2024.  (Mar. 5, 2024 Amended Not., p. 1:10-22.)  On April 4, 2024, Petitioner filed a “Second
Amended Notice of Hearing on Petition for Order Compelling Arbitration,” which
(1) stated the new hearing date on the Petition to be May 17, 2024, and (2)
included a memorandum of points and authorities in support of the
Petition.  (Apr. 4, 2024, Second Amended
Not., p. 1:19-22.) 
On May 14, 2024, Petitioner
filed two proofs of service as to Respondents, establishing that Respondents
had been served, by substituted service, with, inter alia, the “Amended
Notice of Hearing,” civil case management documents, and the Petition, on May
8, 2024.  (POS-010 Forms, ¶¶ 2,
5.)  The court notes two issues with
service. 
First, the two proofs of
service state that Petitioner served Respondents with the “Amended Notice of
Hearing on Petition for Order Compelling Arbitration” which, as set forth
above, stated the previous hearing date of April 10, 2024, and not the current
hearing date of May 17, 2024.  (Mar. 5,
2024 Amended Not., p. 1:19-22; POS-010 Forms, p. 3, Attachment [listing
“Amended Notice of Hearing” as document served].)  The two proofs of service doe not state that Petitioner
served on Respondents its “Second Amended Notice of Hearing on Petition for
Order Compelling Arbitration,” which states the current hearing date of May 17,
2024.  (POS-010 Forms, p. 3, Attachment.)
 Thus, it appears that Petitioner did not
provide Respondents with notice of the May 17, 2024 hearing on the Petition. 
Second, even if the two proofs
of service were to show service of the Second Amended Notice of Hearing on
Respondents, Petitioner did not give Respondents sufficient notice of the
hearing on its Petition.  Specifically,
Petitioner served Respondents with the Petition only seven court days before
the May 17, 2024 hearing, and therefore did not provide Respondents with
sufficient notice.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
1005, subd. (b) [“all moving and supporting papers shall be served and filed at
least 16 court days before the hearing”].) 
Thus, the court exercises its
discretion to continue the hearing on Petitioner’s Petition in order to give
Petitioner an opportunity to provide Respondents with sufficient notice of the
hearing on the Petition. 
ORDER
            The
court orders that the hearing on petitioner The Greenspan Company, aka The
Greenspan Co. / Adjusters International’s Petition for Order Compelling
Arbitration is continued to August 14, 2024, at 10:00 a.m., in Department 53. 
The court orders that the Case
management Conference is continued from June 4, 2024 to August 14, 2024, at
10:00 a.m., in Department 53.
            The
court orders petitioner The Greenspan Company, aka The Greenspan Co. /
Adjusters International (1) to give notice of this ruling to respondents
Lavkumar Barot and Ingrid Barot, and (2) to file the notice of ruling and proof
of service of the notice of ruling with the court. 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
