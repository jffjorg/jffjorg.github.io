And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendants' motion for leave to conduct a mental examination of the plaintiff. The plaintiff had previously agreed to a mental examination, but it was terminated by the examiner without any data or reports being provided. The defendants have shown good cause for the examination, as the plaintiff has placed her mental health at issue. However, the court finds that the defendants' proposed conditions for the examination are contrary to law, specifically the requirement to record the entire examination by audio technology. The court cannot disregard the clear command of the statute, which gives the examinee the right to record the examination. The court has denied the motion on this basis.
