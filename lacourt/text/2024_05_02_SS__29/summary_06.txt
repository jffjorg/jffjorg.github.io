And here is the summary in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to continue the trial for a short period of time. The defendant, Mario Gonzalez, filed the motion on April 8, 2024, requesting a 60-day continuance. The plaintiff, Mayra Elizalde, did not oppose the motion. The judge found that there is good cause to continue the trial because the parties are engaged in settlement discussions and have agreed to defer expert discovery to continue settlement negotiations. The judge also noted that the parties have only had one prior continuance in this matter. As a result, the trial date was continued for approximately 60 days.
