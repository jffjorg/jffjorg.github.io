And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge grants the defendant's motion to compel the deposition of the plaintiff. The plaintiff failed to appear for deposition twice, despite being served with notice. The defendant followed up with the plaintiff to inquire about the nonappearance, but received no response. The Judge finds that the defendant has shown good cause for the production of documents and that the plaintiff has an obligation to sit for a properly noticed deposition. The motion is granted, and the plaintiff is ordered to appear for deposition on May 2, 2024, at 10:00 am at the Law Offices of Daniels, Fine, Israel, Schonbuch & Lebovits, LLP.
