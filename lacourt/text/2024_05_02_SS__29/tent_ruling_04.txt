Motion for Order Deeming Admitted as True the Matters Specified in Requests for
Admission (Set One)
 
Rulings
The motion is denied.
Background
This case arises out of an alleged slip and
fall incident in a Sprouts market on North Western Avenue in San Pedro on October
11, 2019.
On September 20, 2021, Edith Reynolds
(“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against SF Markets, LLC; Sprouts Farmers Market;
Sprouts Farmers Market dba Sprouts; and Does 1 to 25, asserting causes of
action for negligence and premises liability. 
On September 30, 2021, Plaintiff amended her
complaint to name Sprouts Farmers Market, Inc. as Doe 1. (Plaintiff named
additional defendants on November 5, 2021, and subsequently filed a request to
dismiss those defendants on May 23, 2022.)
On December 3, 2021, Defendant SF Markets,
LLC (“SF”) filed an answer. 
On October 12 and 14, 2022, Plaintiff amended
her complaint to name Single Source Security, Inc. dba Protos Security as Doe 1
and Single Source Security, LLC as Doe 2.
On February 28, 2023, Single Source Security,
LLC filed an answer to the complaint and a cross-complaint against Prudent
Security Solutions, Inc. (“Prudent”) and Does 1 through 500.
On March 1, 2023, Plaintiff amended her
complaint to name Prudent as Doe 3.
On May 10, 2023, SF filed a cross-complaint
against Single Source Security, LLC dba Protos Security and Roes 1 through
50.  On the same day, SF amended the
cross-complaint to name Prudent as Roe 1.
On July 20 and 21, 2023, Prudent filed an
answer to the complaint and a cross-complaint against SF; First Washington
Realty, Inc. (“First Washington”); GRI Park Plaza, LLC (“GRI”); Sprouts Farmers
Market; Sprouts Farmers Market dba Sprouts; and Moes 1 through 30.
On August 1, 2023, SF, First Washington, and
GRI filed an answer to Prudent’s cross-complaint.
As is relevant to the motions before the
Court and set for hearing on May 2, 2024, SF served Single Source Security,
Inc. dba Protos Security with discovery on September 6, 2023, including Requests
for Admission (Set One).  (Crossin Decl.,
¶ 2 & Exh. A.)  As to Single Source
Security, Inc. dba Protos Security, service was made by electronic transmission
to the attorneys at the Acker & Whipple firm.  (Id., Exh. A.)
Single Source Security, Inc. dba Protos
Security did not respond to the discovery. 
SF sent a letter to attorney Childers at the Acker & Whipple firm on
November 28, but no response was received. 
(Id., ¶ 3 & Exh. B.)
On March 13, 2024, SF filed this motion for a
deemed admitted order. 
No timely opposition was filed.
On April 29, 2024, three days before the
hearing, Single Source Security, LLC, filed a statement of non-opposition to
the motion, along with a copy of verified responses to the Requests for
Admission by Single Source Security, LLC, served on April 29.
Legal Standard
A party must
respond to requests for admission within 30 days after service. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.250, subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests for admission are directed
does not provide a timely response, the propounding party “may move for an
order that … the truth of [the] matters specified in the requests be deemed
admitted.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).) There is no time
limit for such a motion, and no meet and confer efforts are required. (See id.,
§ 2033.280; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement
be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who fails to provide a
timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (a).) 
The court “shall”
make the order that the truth of the matters specified in the request be deemed
admitted unless the court “finds that the party to whom the requests for
admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a
proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial
compliance with Section 2033.220.”  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c); see St. Mary v. Super. Ct. (2014)
223 Cal.App.4th 762, 778-780.)
“It is mandatory
that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a
timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion [to deem
admitted the truth of the matters specified in the requests for admission].”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd.
(c).)
In Chapter 7 of
the Civil Discovery Act, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010, subdivision
(d), defines “[m]isuses of the discovery process” to include “[f]ailing to
respond to or to submit to an authorized method of discovery.”  Where a party or attorney has engaged in
misuse of the discovery process, the court may impose a monetary sanction in
the amount of “the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by
anyone as a result of that conduct.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (a).)
Discussion
SF served Requests for Admission (Set One) on
Single Source Security, Inc. dba Protos Security on September 6, 2023.  (Crossin Decl., ¶ 2 & Exh. A.)  Single Source Security, Inc. dba Protos
Security was served by email to the attorneys at the Acker & Whipple
firm.  (Id., Exh. A.)
There are, however, two Single Source
Security entities that have been named in this action.  SF filed its cross-complaint against Single
Source Security, LLC, dba Protos Security. 
That entity has appeared in this action and is represented by Mr.
Childers of the Acker & Whipple firm.
SF propounded the discovery at issue,
however, to a different entity: Single Source Security, Inc., dba Protos
Security.  That entity has been named as
a defendant to Plaintiff’s complaint but has not appeared (whether through the
Acker & Whipple firm or otherwise).  
Moreover, the motion to compel seeks a deemed
admitted order (and sanctions) as against Single Source Security, Inc. dba
Protos Security.  No relief is sought
against Single Source Security, LLC.
Single Source Security, LLC and Single Source
Security, Inc. appear to be different entities. 
Service on one (LLC) is not service on the other (Inc.).  Notice to one is not notice to the
other.  Accordingly, service of discovery
directed to Single Source Security, Inc. on counsel for Single Source Security,
LLC is not valid.  Nor is notice to
counsel for the LLC entity adequate notice to the Inc. entity.
Accordingly, the motions for a deemed
admitted order as against Single Source Security, Inc. is denied.  No relief can be granted as to Single Source
Security, Inc., as the discovery was not served on it or its counsel of
record.  No relief can be granted as to
Single Source Security LLC as the notice of motion does not state that any
relief is sought against that entity.
This is not a matter of a mere typographical
error, as SF asserted at a prior hearing. 
It is a matter of proper notice and due process.  
Conclusion
The Court DENIES the motion for a deemed admitted order and
for sanctions.
Moving party is ORDERED to give notice.
