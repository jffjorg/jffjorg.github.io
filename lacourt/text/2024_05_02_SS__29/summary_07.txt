The court finds that Plaintiffs satisfied the statutory meet-and-confer requirement and that their motions are timely filed. The court also finds that Defendant Guerra did not serve timely responses to the Requests for Admission (Set One) and the Form Interrogatories (Set Two), and therefore waived any objections. The court will hear from counsel regarding the amended responses and whether the court should compel further responses.
