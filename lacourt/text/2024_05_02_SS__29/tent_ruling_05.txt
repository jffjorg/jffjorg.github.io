 Case Number:  21STCV34734    Hearing Date:   May 2, 2024    Dept:  29 Motion to Compel the Deposition of Plaintiff filed by Defendant
Nassor Whitehead.
 
Tentative
The motion is granted.
Background
On September 20, 2021, Lavel Flowers (“Plaintiff”) filed
a complaint against Lyft, Inc. (“Lyft”), Nassor Whitehead (“Defendant”), and
Does 1 through 10, asserting causes of action for negligence, assault, battery,
and negligent hiring and supervision causes of action arising out of bicycle
and automobile accident occurring on September 24, 2019, on Sunset Boulevard in
Hollywood.  On December 15, 2021, and
January 11, 2022, Lyft and Defendant filed their answers.
 
On October 25, 2023, the Court
granted the motion of counsel for Plaintiff to be relieved.
 
Trial is scheduled for June 7, 2024.
 
As is relevant to this motion, on March 10, 2023,
Defendant served a notice that he would take the deposition of Plaintiff on April
12, 2023.  (Cook Decl., ¶ 2 & Exh.
A.)  No objection was filed, and
Plaintiff failed to appear.  (Id.,
¶¶ 3-6 & Exhs. B-E.)  Defendant
inquired about the nonappearance and was informed that Plaintiff was ill.  (Id., ¶ 7.).  
 
Following the withdrawal of Plaintiff’s counsel, on February
13, 2024, Defendant served a notice that he would take the deposition of Plaintiff
on February 28. (Id., ¶ 13 & Exh. L.)  Service was made on the address provided in
the order granting the motion to be relieved. 
(Ibid.)  The notice was
returned as undeliverable.  (Id., ¶ 14 & Exh. M.)  Defendant tried to reach Plaintiff by
phone and left a message, and Plaintiff did not return the call.  (Id., ¶ 15.)  Plaintiff did not appear for the
deposition.  (Id., ¶¶ 16-17 &
Exh. N.)  Defendant reached out to
Plaintiff by voice mail and mail to inquire about the non-appearance and
received no response.  (Id., ¶¶ 18-21
& Exhs. O-P.)  
 
On March 28, 2024, Defendant filed this motion to compel.
Plaintiff was served at the address in the court order granting the motion to
be relieved.  Defendant does not seek
sanctions.
 
No opposition has been filed. 
 
Legal Standard
“Any
party may obtain discovery … by taking in California the oral deposition of any
person, including any party to the action.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.010.) 
Code of Civil Procedure sections 2025.210 through 2025.280 provide the
requirements for (among other things) what must be included in a deposition
notice, when and where depositions may be taken, and how and when the notice
must be served.  
“The
service of a deposition notice … is effective to require any deponent who is a
party to the action or an officer, director, managing agent, or employee of a
party to attend and to testify, as well as to produce any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing for inspection and
copying.”  (Id., § 2025.280, subd.
(a).)
Section
2025.410, subdivision (a), requires any party to serve a written objection at
least three days before the deposition if the party contends that a deposition
notice does not comply with the provisions of sections 2025.210 through
2025.280.
“If,
after service of a deposition notice, a party to the action or an officer,
director, managing agent, or employee of a party, or a person designated by an organization
that is a party under Section 2025.230, without
having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails to appear for
examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for¿inspection any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the
deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move for an order compelling
the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the production for inspection of
any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in
the deposition notice.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (a).)  Any such motion to compel
must show good cause for the production of documents and, when a deponent has
failed to appear, the motion must be accompanied “by a declaration stating that
the petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire about the
nonappearance.”  (Id., subd.
(b).)  
Discussion
Defendant has twice noticed the deposition of Plaintiff,
and twice Plaintiff has failed to appear. 
(Cook Decl., ¶¶ 2-6, 13-17 & Exhs. A, E, L, N.)  Each time Plaintiff followed up with
Plaintiff to inquire about the nonappearance. 
(Id., ¶¶ 7, 18-21.).  
 
The Court is aware that there may be an issue with the
address that Plaintiff’s counsel provided for Plaintiff at the time of the granting
of the motion to withdraw.  But that is
the only address for Plaintiff that the Court has on file, it is presumptively
correct, and Defendant cannot do any more than serve Plaintiff at the address
that Plaintiff has on file with the Court. 
Accordingly, service of the second notice of deposition, as well as of
this motion, is adequate.
 
Plaintiff
has an obligation under the Civil Discovery Act to sit for a properly noticed
deposition.  The motion is granted.
 
Conclusion
 
The
Court GRANTS Defendant’s motion to compel the deposition of Plaintiff.
 
The Court
ORDERS Plaintiff to appear for deposition and answer questions under oath on
May __, 2024, at 10:00 am, at the Law Offices of Daniels, Fine, Israel,
Schonbuch & Lebovits, LLP, 1801 Century Park East, Ninth Floor, Los
Angeles, California 90067.
 
Moving party is ORDERED to give notice.
