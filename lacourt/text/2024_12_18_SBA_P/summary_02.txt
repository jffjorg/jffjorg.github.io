And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the defendants' motion to set aside the default judgment entered against them. The defendants argue that the default was the result of their attorney's mistake, and that they intended to file a demurrer and motion to strike before default was entered. The judge finds that the motion is timely and that the defendants are not at fault for failing to file a response. The judge relies on Code of Civil Procedure section 473(b), which allows a court to relieve a party from a judgment taken against them through their attorney's mistake. The judge grants the motion and orders the defendants to give notice of the ruling.
