 Case Number:  24TRCV03565    Hearing Date:   December 18, 2024    Dept:  P Demurrer to Plaintiff’s ComplaintMoving Parties: Defendants Javier Espinosa and Carlos EspinosaResponding Party: Plaintiff Friend N Buddy GroupRULINGThe court considered the moving papers and opposition. Defendants’ demurrer is OVERRULED in its entirety.PROCEDURAL BACKGROUNDOn October 29, 2024, Plaintiff Friend N Buddy Group LLC (“Plaintiff”) filed an Unlawful Detainer action against Defendants Javier Espinosa d/b/a Speed Fix Restoration (“Javier”) and Carlos Espinosa d/b/a Speed Fix Restoration (“Carlos”) (collectively, “Defendants”).On November 6, 2924, Defendants filed the instant demurrer. Plaintiff filed an opposition on December 3, 2024.FACTUAL BACKGROUNDOn June 1, 2023, Defendants entered into a written Lease Agreement (“Lease”) with Plaintiff, in which Defendants agreed to pay Plaintiff $8,000 on the first of each month to rent a property (“Property”) located at 13615 Crenshaw Blvd. #C, Hawthorne, CA 90250. (Complaint, ¶¶ 3a, 6.) Plaintiff is the owner of the Property. (Complaint, ¶ 4.)The Property is a residential property. (Complaint, ¶ 7.) Defendants were served with a three-day notice to quit or pay rent. (Complaint, ¶ 9.) The notice was served by personally handing a copy of the notice to Defendants on October 23, 2024. (Complaint, ¶ 10a.)At the time the notice was served, the rent due was $38,000.00. (Complaint, ¶ 12.) The fair rental value of the Property is $266.66 per day. (Complaint, ¶ 13.)Plaintiff attaches a copy of the Lease, the three-day notice to quit, and proof of service of notice to the Complaint.LEGAL STANDARDA party may demur to a complaint on the grounds that it “does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (e).) A party may also demur to a complaint on the grounds that the complaint is uncertain. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (f).) A demurrer tests whether the complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) A special demurrer for uncertainty under Code of Civil Procedure section 430.10, subdivision (f), is disfavored and will only be sustained where the pleading is so bad that defendant or plaintiff cannot reasonably respond—i.e., cannot reasonably determine what issues must be admitted or denied, or what counts or claims are directed against him or her. (Khoury v. Maly’s of Calif., Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.)When considering demurrers, courts accept all well pleaded facts as true. (Fox v. JAMDAT Mobile, Inc. (2010) 185 Cal.App.4th 1068, 1078.) “A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters. Therefore, it lies only where the defects appear on the face of the pleading or are judicially noticed.” (SKF Farms v. Superior Court (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 902, 905.) “The only issue involved in a demurrer hearing is whether the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous matters, states a cause of action.” (Hahn, supra, 147 Cal.App.4th at p. 747.) On demurrer, a court does “not accept contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law.” (Simonyan v. Nationwide Insurance Company of America (2022) 78 Cal.App.5th 889, 895.)Although courts construe pleadings liberally, sufficient facts must be alleged to support the allegations pled to survive a demurrer. (Rakestraw v. California Physicians' Serv. (2000) 81 Cal.App.4th 39, 43.) Where a demurrer is sustained, leave to amend must be allowed where there is a reasonable possibility of successful amendment. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 349.) The burden is on the party who filed the pleading subject to demurrer to show the court that a pleading can be amended successfully. (Ibid.)DISCUSSIONMoving Party’s ArgumentThe complaint is uncertain and fails to state any cause of action. Further, Plaintiff does not have standing to sue.Opposing Party’s ArgumentCode Civ. Proc. section 1166 determines the pleading requirements for an unlawful detainer complaint, all of which are met here. The demurrer was clearly made in bad faith, and the court should impose sanctions for the filing of a frivolous motion.Merits of the MotionA. Meet and ConferBefore filing a demurrer, the demurring party is required to meet and confer “in person, by telephone, or by video conference with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to the demurrer for the purposes of determining whether an agreement can be reached through a filing of an amended pleading that would resolve the objections to be raised in the demurrer.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a).)Defendants did not attach a meet and confer declaration. Accordingly, the court finds that the parties have not satisfied the meet and confer requirements. However, the court will still discuss the merits of the demurrer.B. Sufficiency of AllegationsA cause of action for unlawful detainer must allege the following elements: (1) a verified complaint; (2) facts on which the plaintiff seeks to recover; (3) description of premises with reasonable certainty; (4) amount of rent in default, if the action is based on paragraph (2) of §1161; (5) specifically the method used to serve the defendant with the notice or notices of termination; (6) in action regarding residential property, unless agreement is oral, landlord lacks possession of writing, or action is based solely on Code Civ. Proc. section 1161, subd. (2), attachments including copies of (a) notices of termination served on the defendant, (b) any written lease or rental agreement regarding the premises, including any addenda or attachments to the lease. (Code Civ. Proc. §1166; see also Palm Property Investments, LLC v. Yadegar (2011) 194 Cal.App.4th 1419, 1425 [alleging and proving proper service on lessees of a valid three-day notice to pay or quit is essential to declaring lessors’ judgment for possession under §1161].)The three-day notice “must advise the tenant of the alleged breach. If it does not do so, the tenant cannot know whether to comply with the notice to quit or remain in possession and contest the landlord’s allegations.” (Delta Imports, Inc. v. Municipal Court of Los Angeles Judicial District (1983) 146 Cal.App.3d 1033, 1036; Bevill v. Zoura (1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 694, 697-698 [strict compliance with statutory mandate as to contents of notice required].)Here, Plaintiff’s complaint is verified by Plaintiff’s attorney. The Complaint further alleges that Plaintiff is the owner of the Property described above, Plaintiff entered into a written Lease with the Defendants, Defendants owe $38,000.00 in rent, and Defendants were personally served with a three-day notice to quit on October 23, 2024. Plaintiff has also attached a copy of the Lease and proof of service of notice to the Complaint. The notice to quit informs Defendants that they owe $38,000.00 in rent.Plaintiff has met all the requirements of Code Civ. Proc. section 1161. Accordingly, the court finds that Plaintiff has pleaded sufficient facts to state a cause of action for unlawful detainer.Thus, the court OVERRULES Defendant’s demurrer.C. UncertaintyA demurrer to a pleading lies where the pleading is uncertain, ambiguous, or unintelligible. (Code Civ. Proc. § 430.10, subd. (f).) “A demurrer for uncertainty is strictly construed, even where a complaint is in some respects uncertain, because ambiguities can be clarified under modern discovery procedures.” (Khoury v. Maly’s of California, Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616, disapproved on other grounds in Quelimane Co. v. Stewart Title Guar. Co. (1998) 19 Cal.4th 26, 46 [holding claims for unfair business practices need not be pled specifically, impliedly disapproving Khoury].) As a result, a special demurrer for uncertainty is not intended to reach failure to incorporate sufficient facts in the pleading but is directed only at uncertainty existing in the allegations already made. (People v. Taliaferro (1957) 149 Cal.App.2d 822, 825, disapproved on other grounds in Jefferson v. J.E. French Co. (1960) 54 Cal.2d 717, 719-720 [statute of limitations question].)Plaintiff alleges that Defendants breached the Lease by failing to make the required rent payments. Defendants were served with a notice to quit but did not comply.The court finds that the Complaint is not so ambiguous that Defendants are unaware of the issues they are to meet.Accordingly, the court OVERRULES the special demurrer for uncertainty.D. Lack of StandingDefendants argue that Plaintiff does not have standing to sue but do not further brief this issue.Accordingly, the court declines to address this argument at this time.CONCLUSIONBased on the foregoing, Defendants’ demurrer is OVERRULED in its entirety.Plaintiff is ordered to give notice of ruling.
