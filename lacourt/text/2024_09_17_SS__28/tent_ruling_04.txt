LEGAL STANDARD 
A.   Demand for inspection 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2031.300 provides in part: 
“If a party to whom a demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling is directed fails to serve a timely response to it, the
following rules shall apply: 
“(a) The party to whom the demand for inspection,
copying, testing, or sampling is directed waives any objection to the demand,
including one based on privilege or on the protection for work product under
Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve
that party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following
conditions are satisfied: 
“(1) The party has subsequently served a response that
is in substantial compliance with Sections 2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230,
2031.240, and 2031.280. 
“(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response
was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
“(b) The party making the demand may move for an order
compelling response to the demand. 
“(c) Except as provided in subdivision (d), the court
shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes a motion to compel a response to a demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction
acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the
imposition of the sanction unjust. . . .” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300,
subds. (a), (b), (c).)  
B.   Interrogatories 
          Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.290 provides in part: 
“If a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails
to serve a timely response, the following rules apply: 
“(a) The party to whom the interrogatories are
directed waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings under
Section 2030.230, as well as any objection to the interrogatories, including
one based on privilege or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4
(commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that
party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following
conditions are satisfied: 
“(1) The party has subsequently served a response that
is in substantial compliance with Sections 2030.210, 2030.220, 2030.230, and
2030.240. 
“(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response
was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
“(b) The party propounding the interrogatories may
move for an order compelling response to the interrogatories. 
“(c) The court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to
interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust. . . .” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290.)  
DISCUSSION 
A.   Gayatri’s motion to compel responses to request for
production of documents 
On
June 10, 2024, Gayatri served request for production of documents, set one, on
Plaintiff. 
On
July 12, 2024, Plaintiff served unverified objection-only responses. 
Gayatri
argues that the unverified objections are the equivalent of no responses and the Court should compel Plaintiff to provide verified substantive responses, without objections, and
responsive documents. 
Plaintiff’s
objections did not require a verification. 
(See Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.250, subd. (a) [“The party to whom the
demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is directed shall sign the
response under oath unless the response contains only objections”].) 
When
a party believes that objections to a request for production of documents are
without merit or are too general, the party may file a timely motion to compel
further responses under Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.310 after meeting
and conferring with opposing counsel.  Under
the Eighth Amended Standing Order, the Court will not hear a motion to compel
further discovery responses under Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.310 until
after the moving party schedules and participates in an Informal Discovery Conference. 
The
Court denies the motion. 
B.   Gayatri’s motions to compel responses to special and form
interrogatories 
On
June 10, 2024, Gayatri served special interrogatories, set one, and form
interrogatories, set one, on Plaintiff. 
On
July 12, 2024, Plaintiff served unverified objection-only responses. 
Gayatri
argues that the unverified objections are the equivalent of no responses and the Court should compel Plaintiff to serve verified substantive responses without objections. 
Plaintiff’s
objections did not require a verification. 
(See Code Civ. Proc., §2030.250, subd. (a) [“The party to whom the interrogatories
are directed shall sign the response under oath unless the response contains
only objections”].) 
When
a party believes that objections to interrogatories are without merit or are
too general, the party may file a timely motion to compel further responses
under Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.300 after meeting and conferring
with opposing counsel.  Under the Eighth
Amended Standing Order, the Court will not hear a motion to compel further
discovery responses under Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.300 until after
the moving party schedules and participates in an Informal Discovery
Conference. 
The
Court denies the motions. 
C.   Sanctions 
 Plaintiff has not requested sanctions and has
not provided a declaration stating the amount of time his counsel spent opposing Gayatri's unsuccessful motions.  Therefore, the Court does
not impose sanctions on Gayatri under Code of Civil Procedure sections 2031.300,
subdivision (c), and 2030.290, subdivision (c).  
CONCLUSION 
The Court DENIES Defendant Gayatri Hospitality, LLC’s motion to compel Plaintiff
Joshua Lee Miller’s responses to request
for production of documents, set one, and for sanctions. 
The Court DENIES Defendant
Gayatri Hospitality, LLC’s motion to compel Plaintiff Joshua Lee Miller’s
responses to special interrogatories, set one, and for sanctions. 
The Court DENIES Defendant Gayatri Hospitality, LLC’s
motion to compel Plaintiff Joshua Lee Miller’s responses to form
interrogatories, set one, and for sanctions. 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Moving
party is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court
within five days.
