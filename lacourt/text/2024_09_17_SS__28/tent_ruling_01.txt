  Case Number:  21STCV42883    Hearing Date:   September 17, 2024    Dept:  28 Having
considered the moving papers, the Court rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
A.   Prior proceedings 
On
November 22, 2021, Plaintiff Berenice Murillo (“Plaintiff”) filed this action
against Defendants American Dream Logistics, Inc. (“American Dream”), Doe
Driver, and Does 1-100 for motor vehicle tort and general negligence. 
On
December 6, 2021 and July 25, 2023, Plaintiff amended the complaint to replace
Doe Driver with Defendant Ramon Chacon (“Chacon”). 
On
December 13, 2022, the clerk entered American Dream’s default.  On June 2, 2023, the Court set aside the
default based on the stipulation of Plaintiff and American Dream. 
On
September 27, 2023, Chacon and American Dream filed an answer. 
 On July 17, 2024, Plaintiff amended the
complaint to include Defendants Freight Systems, LLC as Doe 1 and BNSF Railway Company ("BNSF") as
Doe 2. 
On
September 6, 2024, BNSF filed an answer and a cross-complaint against
Cross-Defendants American Dream, Chacon, and Does 1-50 for apportionment of
fault, indemnification, and declaratory relief. 
B.   This motion 
On
August 9, 2024, Plaintiff filed a motion for relief from potential jury trial
waiver.  The motion was set for hearing
on September 17, 2024.  No opposition has
been filed. 
Trial
is currently scheduled for April 28, 2025. 
PARTY’S REQUEST 
Plaintiff
asks the Court to grant relief from waiver of jury trial. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 631 provides in part: 
“(a) The right to a trial by jury as declared by
Section 16 of Article I of the California Constitution shall be preserved to
the parties inviolate. In civil cases, a jury may only be waived pursuant to
subdivision (f). 
* * *
 “(f) A party waives trial by jury in any of the
following ways: 
* * *
  “(4) By failing
to announce that a jury is required, at the time the cause is first set for
trial, if it is set upon notice or stipulation, or within five days after
notice of setting if it is set without notice or stipulation. 
“(5) By failing to timely pay the fee described in
subdivision (b), unless another party on the same side of the case has paid
that fee. 
* * *
 “(g) The court may, in its discretion upon just terms,
allow a trial by jury although there may have been a waiver of a trial by
jury.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 631,
subds. (a), (f)(4) & (5), (g).) 
“
‘The right to a jury trial is a basic and fundamental part of our system of
jurisprudence . . . In case of doubt, therefore, the issue should be resolved
in favor of preserving a litigant’s right to trial by jury.’”  (R. Fairbank et al., Cal. Practice Guide:
Civil Trials and Evidence (Rutter 2022) ¶ 2:311, p. 2-68 (Cal. Practice Guide),
quoting Byram v. Superior Court (1977) 73 Cal.App.3d 648, 652; see Grafton
Partners v. Superior Court (2005) 36 Cal.4th 944, 958 [“any ambiguity or
doubt concerning the waiver provisions of section 631 must be ‘resolved in
favor of according to a litigant a jury trial’ ”].) 
“While
the matter is discretionary, ‘it is well settled that, in light of the public
policy favoring trial by jury, a motion to be relieved of a jury waiver should
be granted unless, and except, where granting such a motion would work serious
hardship to the objecting party.’ ” 
(Cal. Practice Guide, supra, ¶ 2:317, pp. 2-69 to 2-70, quoting Boal
v. Price Waterhouse & Co. (1985) 165 Cal.App.3d 806, 809.)  “Stated differently, ‘The Court abuses its
discretion in denying relief where there has been no prejudice to the other
party or to the court from an inadvertent waiver.’”  (Id. at p. 2-70, quoting Gann v.
William Bros. Realty, Inc. (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 1698, 1704.) 
“The
prejudice which must be shown to justify [denial of relief from jury trial
waiver] is prejudice from granting relief from the waiver, as opposed to
prejudice from a jury trial.” (Cal. Practice Guide, supra, ¶ 2:320, p.
2-70.) 
DISCUSSION 
Plaintiff inadvertently failed to post jury fees prior
to the commencement of the initial case management conference or within one
year of the date the action was filed.
 Plaintiff has now posted jury fees. 
The
Court finds that granting Plaintiff relief from waiver of a jury trial will not
prejudice the other parties.  The Court
exercises its discretion to grant the motion. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court GRANTS Plaintiff Berenice Murillo's motion for relief from jury
trial waiver. 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Moving
party is ordered to file proof of service of this ruling within five days.
