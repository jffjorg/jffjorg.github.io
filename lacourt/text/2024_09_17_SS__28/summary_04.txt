And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the motions filed by Gayatri Hospitality, LLC (Gayatri) to compel Plaintiff Joshua Lee Miller to respond to requests for production of documents and interrogatories. Gayatri argues that Plaintiff's unverified responses are equivalent to no responses and that the Court should compel Plaintiff to provide verified substantive responses without objections. The judge finds that Plaintiff's objections did not require verification and that Gayatri's motions are premature as Plaintiff has not requested sanctions. Therefore, the judge denies Gayatri's motions to compel responses to requests for production of documents and interrogatories. The judge also denies Gayatri's motion for sanctions as Plaintiff has not requested sanctions and has not provided a declaration stating the amount of time his counsel spent opposing Gayatri's unsuccessful motions. The judge orders the moving party to give notice of this ruling and to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court within five days.
