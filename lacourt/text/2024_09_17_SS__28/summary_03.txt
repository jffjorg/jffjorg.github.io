And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion filed by Defendant Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (Metro) for leave to file a first amended answer. The motion was filed on August 9, 2024, and is set for hearing on September 17, 2024. The Plaintiff, Kamal Rashad Hawkins, has not filed an opposition to the motion.

The Judge has considered the moving papers and the legal standards applicable to the motion. Under California Code of Civil Procedure section 473(a)(1), the Court has the discretion to allow a party to amend a pleading or proceeding in furtherance of justice. The Court has also considered the principles of liberality in allowing amendments to answers, as well as the potential for prejudice to the opposing party.

The proposed first amended answer raises an affirmative defense based on Civil Code section 3333.4, which provides that a person injured in a motor vehicle accident cannot recover non-economic losses if the injured person was uninsured at the time of the accident. Metro asserts that it only recently discovered that Plaintiff was uninsured at the time of the accident and that it did not previously include this affirmative defense in its answer.

The Judge has concluded that the motion should be granted, as the Court is not aware of any prejudice that will result from granting Metro's motion. The Court orders Metro to file and serve a first amended answer within 10 days of the hearing on this motion.
