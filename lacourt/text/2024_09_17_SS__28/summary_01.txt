And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the motion for relief from jury trial waiver filed by the plaintiff, Berenice Murillo, and has ruled in her favor. The plaintiff had inadvertently failed to post jury fees prior to the commencement of the initial case management conference or within one year of the filing of the action. However, the plaintiff has now posted the necessary fees. The court finds that granting relief from waiver of jury trial will not prejudice the other parties. Therefore, the court exercises its discretion to grant the motion and orders that the plaintiff's jury trial waiver be lifted.
