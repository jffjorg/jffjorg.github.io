The meet and confer requirement is identical for demurrers to complaints. (CCP
ยง 430.41(a).) Like CCP ยง 435.5, and as Defendant persuasively argued at the
hearing on the motion to strike, the appropriate remedy is to deny the motion
for failing to meet and confer. The court is hard-pressed to conclude that the
Legislature also wanted courts to impose sanctions since they failed to include
it in either of these sections.
