STATEMENT OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS: 
 
On December 19, 2022, Plaintiffs Andrew Stafford and Alexa
Greger (Plaintiffs) filed a Complaint against Defendant Christine Fadley
(Defendant) with nine causes of action for: (1) Private Nuisance, (2)
Intentional Influence to Vacate, (3) Termination of Estate, Civil Code § 789.3
(4) Business and Professions Code §§ 17200, (5) Slander/Defamation, (6) Breach
of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment, (7) Breach of Implied Covenant of Good Faith
and Fair Dealing, (8) Violation of California Civil Code § 1946.2, and (9)
Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress. Plaintiffs allege that they were
tenants of the Subject Property, which was owned and/or managed by Defendant.
During Plaintiffs time at the Subject Property, Defendant locked the gate to
prevent Plaintiffs from entering. Additionally, Defendant turned off electrical
power and glued the locks shut to further prevent Plaintiffs from entering the
Subject Property. Defendant also attempted to increase Plaintiffs’ rent by 37%,
increasing it from $2,700 to $2,700, or stating that Plaintiffs have to vacate.
 
On May 25, 2023, the court SUSTAINED Defendant’s Demurrer as
to the 5th Cause of Action, with leave to amend, and OVERRULED as to the
remaining causes of action. The court also DENIED Defendant’s Motion to Strike.
 
On June 12, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a First Amended Complaint
(FAC) with the same causes of action as the Complaint alleged in the caption,
however, the Eighth Cause of Action states it is for Conversion of Private
Property. 
 
On November 13, 2023, the court OVERRULED Defendant’s
demurrer to the FAC and DENIED Defendant’s Motion to Strike.
 
On December 5, 2023, Defendant filed an Answer. Defendant
also filed a Cross-Complaint against Cross-Defendants Andrew Stafford and Alexa
Greger (Cross-Defendants) with five causes of action for: (1) Breach of
Contract, (2) Negligence, (3) Intentional Misrepresentation, (4) Negligent
Misrepresentation, and (5) Unjust Enrichment. 
 
On December 20, 2023, Plaintiff filed a Motion to Strike
Answer to Complaint.
 
On December 20, 2023, Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant also filed a
Demurrer to the Cross-Complaint.
 
On February 13, 2024, Defendant filed a First Amended Answer
to Verified First Amended Complaint.
 
On February 13, 2024, Defendant/Cross-Complainant filed a
First Amended Cross-Complaint (FACC).
 
On March 21, 2024, Cross-Defendants filed an Answer to the
FACC.
 
On March 21, 2024, Plaintiff filed a instant Motion to
Strike Defendant’s Answer in its Entirety, or Alternatively, Portions of
Defendant’s Answer to Complaint; Request for Entry of Default (MTS). On June 5,
2024, Defendant filed an opposition. On June 12, 2024, Plaintiff filed a reply.
 
On March 26, 2024, Defendant filed a Declaration in support
of the instant Motion for Sanctions to preserve the hearing date. 
 
On May 3, 2024, Defendant filed the instant motion for
sanctions. On June 12, 2024, Plaintiffs filed an opposition. On June 18, 2024,
Defendant filed a reply.
 
LEGAL STANDARD: 
 
Motion for
Sanctions
 
Under Code of Civil Procedure section 128.7 subdivision
(b), by filing a pleading, an attorney certifies, “to the best of [their]
knowledge, information, and belief, formed after an inquiry reasonable under
the circumstances,” that the pleading meets all of the following
conditions:¿  
 
1.                 
It
is not being presented primarily for an improper purpose, such as to harass or
to cause unnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of litigation. 
2.                 
The
claims, defenses, and other legal contentions therein are warranted by existing
law or by a nonfrivolous argument for the extension, modification, or reversal
of existing law or the establishment of new law. 
3.                 
The
allegations and other factual contentions have evidentiary support or, if
specifically, so identified, are likely to have evidentiary support after a
reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery. 
4.                 
The
denials of factual contentions are warranted on the evidence or, if
specifically, so identified, are reasonably based on a lack of information or
belief.¿ 
 
Under section¿128.7, a¿court¿may¿impose sanctions if it
concludes a pleading was filed for an improper purpose or was indisputably
without merit, either legally or factually.¿¿(Bucur v. Ahmad¿(2016) 244 Cal.App.4th 175, 189-190.)¿A claim is
factually frivolous if it is “not well grounded in fact” and is legally
frivolous if it is “not warranted by existing law or a good faith argument for
the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law. [Citation.]”¿(Ibid.)¿“In either case, to
obtain¿sanctions, the moving party must show the party's conduct in asserting
the claim was objectively unreasonable. [Citation.]”¿¿(Ibid.)¿“A claim is objectively unreasonable if ‘any reasonable
attorney would agree that [it] is totally¿and completely without merit.’”¿¿(Id. citing In re Marriage of Flaherty (1982) 31 Cal.3d 637, 650.) 
 
Under section 128.5, “[a] trial court may order a party,
the party’s attorney, or both, to pay the reasonable expenses, including
attorney’s fees, incurred by another party as a result of actions or tactics,
made in bad faith, that are frivolous or solely intended to cause unnecessary
delay.” Actions or tactics include “filing and service of a complaint.” (Civ.
Code Proc., § 128.5, subd. (b)(1).) “‘Frivolous’ means totally and completely
without merit or for the sole purpose of harassing an opposing party.” (Civ.
Code Proc., § 128.5, subd. (b)(2).) “Whether sanctions are warranted [under
section 128.5] depends on an evaluation of all the circumstances surrounding
the questioned action. [Citation.]’ [Citation.]” (Wallis v. PHL Associates, Inc. (2008) 168 Cal.App.4th 882, 893.) 
 
“[A]s with [Federal] Rule 11 (28 U.S.C) sanctions, Code of
Civil Procedure section 128.7 sanctions¿should be made with restraint,
[citation] and are not mandatory¿even if a claim is frivolous.”  (Peake v. Underwood¿(2014) 227
Cal.App.4th 428, 448, as modified on denial of reh'g (July 17,
2014).)   
 
“The award of sanctions for a frivolous action [or tactic]
under Code of Civil Procedure section 128.5 is within the sound discretion of
the trial court. [Citation.]’” (Wallis v.
PHL Associates, Inc., supra, 168
Cal.App.4th at p. 893.) 
 
Request for
Judicial Notice
 
The court
grants Defendant’s request for judicial notice as to Exhibits 1 and
2. (Evid. Code § 452(d), (h); See Kalnoki
v. First American Trustee Servicing Solutions, LLC (2017) 8 Cal.App.5th
23,37.) However, the court only takes judicial notice of the foregoing
documents only as to “the existence, content and authenticity of public records
and other specified documents”; it does not take judicial notice of the truth
of the factual matters asserted in those documents. (Dominguez v. Bonta (2022) 87 Cal. App. 5th 389, 400.)¿¿ 
 
ANALYSIS: 
 
21-Day Safe Harbor Rule 
 
“Section 128.7 provides for a
21-day period during which a party may avoid sanctions by withdrawing the
offending pleading or other document. [Citations].”  (Bucur v. Ahmad, supra, 244 Cal.App.4th at p. 190.)  “If a
party does not take advantage of the [21-day] safe harbor period by withdrawing
a frivolous filing, a court has broad discretion to impose sanctions.” 
(Ibid.) 
 
Here, Defendant served Plaintiffs
notice of this motion April 30, 2024 by U.S. Mail.  (Motion, Proof of
Service.) Plaintiffs had 21 calendar days plus 5 calendar days, until June 4,
2024, to withdraw the Motion to Strike Amended Answer to avoid sanctions. (CCP
§ 1013(a).) However, Plaintiffs did not withdraw the Motion to Strike the
Answer by that time.  
 
Accordingly, Plaintiffs are not
protected from sanctions by the 21-day safe harbor rule.
 
Legally and/or
Frivolous Pleading
 
Defendant contends that Plaintiffs improperly filed their
Motion to Strike the Amended Answer because they failed to meet and confer and
untimely filed it. Plaintiffs contend the Motion to Strike the Amended Answer
has merits because Defendant included a prohibited General Denial in their
response to the Verified Complaint. Defendant replies that Plaintiff’s failure
to meet and confer warrants sanctions. Defendant also reduces their sanctions
request to $7,685.29 in attorneys’ fees and $185.29 in costs. 
 
Here, sanctions are not warranted. First, an incentive to
timely file a motion to strike is to deny an untimely one, not to issue
sanctions awards. Second, the court is not persuaded that failure to meet and
confer, while it would have saved the court time and judicial resources, is
sufficient grounds to award sanctions. Defendant argues that the meet and
confer requirement is mandatory since the CCP states that “the moving party shall meet and confer” before filing
a motion to strike. (CCP § 435.5(a).) However, CCP § 435.5 does not provide for
sanctions should a party fail to meet and confer, and the closest analogy
Defendant provides is to sanctions awarded for discovery motions. So, while
meeting and conferring before filing the motion to strike was mandatory,
awarding sanctions for failing to meet and confer is not.[1]
Similarly, there is no evidence Plaintiff’s counsel’s failure to meet and
confer demonstrates bad faith rather than mistake, despite Defendant’s vigorous
advocacy. Third, Plaintiffs raised a valid point in their Motion to Strike the
Amended Answer because Defendant inappropriately included a General Denial in
the Amended Answer. 
 
Finally, even if the court entertained Defendant’s sanctions
request, it is unreasonable. This motion and the briefing submitted with the
Motion to Strike the Amended Answer are substantively identical. Indeed, the
only difference is Defendant’s inclusion of argument voiced at the hearing on
the motion to strike. 
 
Accordingly, the court DENIES Defendant’s Motion for
Sanctions.
 
CONCLUSION:
 
            For
the foregoing reasons, the Court decides the pending motion as follows: 
 
1.      Motion
for Sanctions is DENIED.
Moving party is to give notice. 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
