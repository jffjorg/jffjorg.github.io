And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to quash subpoenas issued by Brian Yang and Jerry Xu to obtain financial documents from NYAM, LLC's banking records. The subpoenas were issued as part of a lawsuit alleging breach of fiduciary duty, breach of contract, and other claims against defendants Michel Amar, Alec Amar, Bit.Management, LLC, NYAM, LLC, and Multiple Application Technology, LLC. The defendants contend that the subpoenas are overbroad and invade NYAM's privacy rights. The Judge has decided to narrow the subpoenas to involve only transactions between BIT, MAP, and Bit Mining International LLC, and has also temporally limited the subpoenas to a specific period. The Judge has granted the motion to quash in part, and has modified the protective order to allow parties to designate documents as confidential after receiving them from a third-party.
