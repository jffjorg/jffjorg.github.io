And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving Brendan Schulz, a plaintiff who alleges that Pitzer College and several defendants failed to accommodate him as a student after he suffered a concussion because of his Jewish faith. Schulz seeks to compel further responses to his special interrogatories and set a deadline for responses. The defendants argue that the motion is untimely, as they agreed to an extended deadline of September 8, 2023, only if Schulz served revised interrogatories by August 7, 2023, which he did not do. The judge disagrees, finding that the agreement does not make the deadline contingent on past acts. The judge grants the motion as to interrogatories nos. 1-5 and 7, but denies it as to interrogatory no. 6, which is overbroad and overburdensome. The judge orders further responses to be provided within 30 days.
