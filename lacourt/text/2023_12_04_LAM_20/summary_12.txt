And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case brought by Plaintiff Brendan Schulz against Defendants Pitzer College, Janet Schwing, Nigel Boyle, and Melvin Oliver. The Plaintiff seeks to compel further responses to his special interrogatories, which include questions about Pitzer College's failure to accommodate him as a student after he suffered a concussion due to his religious beliefs. The Judge has ruled that the Plaintiff's motion is granted in part, compelling further responses to interrogatories nos. 1-5 and 7, but is denied as to interrogatory no. 6, which is overbroad and overburdensome. The Judge has ordered that further responses be provided within 30 days.
