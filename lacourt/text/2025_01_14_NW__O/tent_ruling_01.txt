     CASE NO.: 23STCV14887
 
 
ORDER GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART DEFENDANTS’
  MOTIONS TO COMPEL PLAINTIFFS’ FURTHER RESPONSES TO DEFENDANTS’ REQUEST FOR
  PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS, SET ONE



 
I.              
BACKGROUND 
This case arises
out of a habitability dispute between tenant Plaintiffs Talia Meyer (“Talia”) and
Jonathan Meyer (“Jonathan”)(collectively, “Plaintiffs” or “Cross-Defendants”)
and landlord Defendant Mohammad Senemar (“Senemar”), in both his individual capacity
and his capacity as trustee for Defendant M T Senemar Separate Property Trust
(“Trustee”)(collectively, “Defendants” or “Cross-Complainants”). 
On October
26, 2023, Cross-Complainants filed a Cross-Complaint, alleging (1) Equitable
Indemnification; (2) Comparative Indemnity; (3) Declaratory Relief; (4)
Equitable Apportionment of Fault; (5) Contribution; and (6) Negligence.  
Senemar now
seeks to compel both Jonathan and Talia’s further responses to his requests for
production of documents (“RFPs”). Trustee now seeks to compel Jonathan’s
further responses to his RFPs. 
The Court
will address all three motions with this single order. 
II.           
PROCEDURAL
HISTORY
On June 26,
2023, Plaintiffs filed their Complaint, alleging (1) Negligence; (2) Breach of
Implied Warranty of Habitability; and (3) Violation of the Los Angeles Rent
Stabilization Anti-Harassment Ordinance, § 43.30 et seq.
On August 3,
2023, the Court denied Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction. 
On September
20, 2023, Defendants filed their Answer.
On October
26, 2023, Cross-Complainants filed a Cross-Complaint, alleging (1) Equitable Indemnification;
(2) Comparative Indemnity; (3) Declaratory Relief; (4) Equitable Apportionment

On April 9, 2024,
Cross-Complainants filed an amended Cross-Complaint to add Cross-Defendants as parties.
On June 10,
2024, the Court granted in part and denied in part Plaintiffs’ Motions to
Compel Further. 
On June 24,
2024, Cross-Defendants filed their Answer.

2024, Defendants filed nine Motions to Compel Plaintiffs’ further responses,
including the instant Senemar Motion to Compel Further Responses to RFPs from
Jonathan, the instant Trustee Motion to Compel Further Responses to RFPs from
Jonathan, and the instant Senemar Motion to Compel Further Responses to RFPs
from Talia.

III.        
LEGAL STANDARD
A.            
Request for Production of Documents 
In responding to a request for
production of documents, a party must provide one of the following: (1) a
legally adequate statement of compliance; (2) a statement of inability to
comply; or (3) an objection to the particular demand. (See Code Civ.
Proc. § 2031.210(a).)[1] If any objections are made,
they must: (1) “[i]dentify with particularity any document …
falling within any category of item in the demand to which an objection is
being made”; and (2) “[s]et forth clearly the extent of, and the specific
ground for, the objection.”¿(Id. at § 2031.240(b).) A statement that the
responding party is unable to comply with a particular demand “shall affirm
that a diligent search and a reasonable inquiry has been made in an effort to
comply with that demand”; “shall also specify whether the inability to comply
is because the particular item or category has never existed, has been
destroyed, has been lost, misplaced, or stolen, or has never been, or is no
longer, in the possession, custody, or control of the responding party”; 
and “shall set forth the name and address of any natural person or organization
known or believed by that party to have possession, custody, or control of that
item or category of item.” (Id. at § 2031.230.) 
A party who
believes a responding party has served (1) an incomplete statement of
compliance, (2) an inadequate, incomplete, or evasive statement of compliance,
or (3) an unmeritorious objection can move for an order compelling further
responses but must “set forth specific acts showing good cause justifying the
discovery sought by the demand.” (See id. at §§
2031.310(a)-(b)(1).)
IV.         
NOTICE
Notice of a
motion to compel further responses must be given within 45 days of service of
verified responses or supplemental responses, or on or before any specific
later date to which the parties have agreed in writing. (See Code Civ.
Proc. §§ 2031.230(c),
2030.300(c),
2033.290(c).) When responses are served by mail, that time is extended by five
days. (See id. at 1013(a).) If such notice is not given timely, the
propounding party waives any right to compel a further response. (See id.)¿¿ ¿¿
Here,
Plaintiffs served their discovery responses on Defendants on July 22, 2024. (See
Declaration of Andrew Morrell filed October 1, 2024 (“Morell Decl.”), ¶¶ 4-6,
Exs. B-D.) The parties agreed to grant Defendants until October 7, 2024, to
file their motions to compel further responses. (See Morrell Decl., ¶ 9,
Ex. G.) Defendants filed the instant motions on October 1, 2024. Defendants’
motions are timely.  
V.            
MEET AND CONFER
Before bringing a motion to compel further responses to any
discovery request, the moving party is required to make efforts to meet and
confer in good faith and must submit a declaration attesting to those efforts.
(See Code Civ. Proc. §§ 2031.310(b)(2), 2030.300(b)(1), and 2033.290(b)(1).)
“A meet and confer declaration in support of a motion shall state facts showing
a reasonable and good faith attempt at an informal resolution of each issue
presented by the motion.” (Id. at § 2016.040.) However, a discovery
motion should not be denied automatically based upon the reason that the moving
parties failed to meet and confer in good faith. (See Obregon v.
Superior Court (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 424, 434.) 
Defendants filed a declaration attesting to the parties’ meet and
confer efforts. (See Morrell Decl., ¶¶ 5-10, Exs. B-G.) It appears that
instead of Ms. Janoobi, a different attorney at her firm took the initial
laboring oar to meet and confer with Plaintiffs’ counsel. Given the breakdown
in civility and communication between Ms. Janoobi and Plaintiff’s counsel in
the past, this was a wise decision as evidenced by this Court’s prior observations
reflected in its orders – and subsequent experience with Ms. Janoobi on October
21, 2025 – in the case. Nevertheless, given Plaintiff’s counsel’s failure to
provide the Court with any details regarding his response to Mr. Morrell’s meet
and confer letter dated August 19, 2024, the Court is left but one conclusion:
that Mr. Nava failed to engage in the meet and confer process in any way
whatsoever, either in writing or by telephone. This is inexcusable. Thus, the
Court finds Defendants have fulfilled their meet and confer requirements and
thus turns its attention to the merits of the motions. 
VI.         
ANALYSIS
Three motions
to compel further are presently before the Court. The Court will first address Senemar’s
Motion to Compel Jonathan’s Further Responses, then Senemar’s Motion to Compel
Talia’s Further Responses, and, finally, Trustee’s Motion to Compel Jonathan’s
Further Responses.[2]  
A.            
The Court Grants in Part and Denies in
Part Senemar’s Motion to Compel Jonathan’s Further Responses to Senemar’s RFPs 
Senemar moves
to compel Jonathan’s further responses to his RFPs Nos. 1-6 and 8-73. (See
Separate Statement in Support of Senmar’s Motion to Compel Jonathan’s Further
Responses to RFPs.) 
1.              
RFPs Nos. 1-4, 6, 8-22, 24-48, 50,
52-53, 55-58, 60-68, 70-71
To RFPs Nos.
1-4, 6, 8-22, 24-48, 50, 52-53, 55-58, 60-68, and 70-71, Jonathan provided the
following boilerplate response:
“Plaintiff
objects to this Request on the grounds that it is grossly overbroad, vague, and
ambiguous; that it is overbroad as to time; that is compound and/or duplicative
of other discovery requests; that it seeks privileged information, including
information protected from disclosure by the attorney-client privilege and/or
the work product doctrine and/or the physician-patient and/or
psychotherapist-patient and/or governmental information privilege; that it
seeks information in violation of Plaintiff’s privacy rights; that it seeks
material neither relevant to this action nor reasonably calculated to lead to
the discovery of admissible evidence; that it is unduly burdensome and
oppressive; that it seeks information equally if not solely available to
Defendant; that it fails to specify the documents sought with sufficient
particularity; and that it is intended to vex, injure, annoy, and harass
Plaintiff.  
Subject to
and without waiver of the aforementioned objections, Plaintiff Responds as
follows: Plaintiff will produce all responsive documents within his possession,
custody or control to which he makes no objection.”
Senemar is
entitled to further responses to RFPs Nos. 1-4, 6, 8-22, 24-48, 50, 52-53,
55-58, 60-68, and 70-71, as Jonathan’s responses are not code-compliant. As an
initial matter, the Court overrules Jonathan’s objections. Jonathan must
identify with particularity each document being objected to and the specific
ground for the objection. (See Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.240(b)(1)-(2).) To
the extent Jonathan believes a request asks for privileged documents, Jonathan
must identify the particular privilege invoked and “sufficient factual
information for other parties to evaluate the merits of that claim, including,
if necessary, a privilege log.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.240(c)(1).) Simply put,
Code of Civil Procedure § 2031.210(a) presents a multiple-choice question
requiring respondents to select one of three specific options; it does not
allow for fill in the blank or vague “will produce” responses.
The Court
therefore GRANTS Senemar’s Motion as to RFPs Nos. 1-4, 6, 8-22, 24-48, 50,
52-53, 55-58, 60-68, and 70-71 and orders Jonathan to provide
code-compliant responses, including production of all responsive documents, on
or before January 31, 2025. 

2.              
RFPs Nos. 49, 51, 54, 59, 69, 72-73
RFP No. 49
seeks “[a]ny and all videos of the SUBJECT PROPERTY taken at any time during
YOUR TENANCY at the SUBJECT PROPERTY.” 
RFP No. 51 seeks
“[a]ny DOCUMENT and WRITINGS about the condition of the SUBJECT PROPERTY YOU
allege in YOUR complaint.”
RFP No. 54
seeks “[a]ny and all black and white or color photographs of the DEFENDANT.”
RFP No. 59
seeks “[a]ny and all statements whether written, recorded or transcribed,
obtained from any DEFENDANT.”
RFP No. 69
seeks “[a]ny and all color photographs and video recordings of the SUBJECT
PROPERTY.” 
RFP No. 72
seeks “[a]ny and all audio recordings of the DEFENDANT.”
And RFP No.
73 seeks “[a]ny and all video recordings and surveillance videos of the
DEFENDANT.”
To each, Jonathan
responded with the same objections and “Plaintiff will produce…” sentence,
listed above. 
To each of Jonathan’s
responses, Senemar replied with the following reason for further responses:
“CCP §
2031.280(a) requires that ‘any document or category of documents produced in
response to a demand … shall be identified with the specific request number to
which the documents respond.’ The documents Plaintiff have produced, to the
extent they have, do not comply. A blanket ‘responding party will comply and
produce all documents’ is not code compliance response.  Plaintiff Produced hundreds of pages of
documents with no identification or bates stamps. It is impossible for
defendants to look through the documents and guess which documents respond to
which request. Additionally based on Plaintiffs’ boilerplate objections
defendants cannot ascertain what documents plaintiffs are withholding or the
basis for withholding documents. Defendants are entitled to all evidence
including photographs of the incident to prepare the defense of their case.
Plaintiffs are required to identify documents they are withholding and the
specific objection and reason for withholding the documents.”
Senemar is
not entitled to further responses to RFPs Nos. 49, 51, 54, 59, 69, and 72-73 as
they are overbroad as to time and/or scope and as such are not reasonably
calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. Moreover, Senemar made
no attempt to reasonably tailor his requests, nor does Senemar’s argument in
support of his Motion provide any additional information about what he is
seeking or why, for example, black and white photographs of Defendant would be
relevant. If Senemar had offered some kind of alternative to his all or nothing
approach, the Court might be more inclined to grant his Motion as to these RFPs.
However, it is Senemar’s Motion and thus his burden of proof. Accordingly, the
Court declines to tailor Senemar’s requests without such guidance and thus
finds it appropriate to sustain Jonathan’s objections concerning overbreadth
and specificity. The Court overrules all other objections. 
The Court
therefore DENIES Senemar’s Motion as to RFPs Nos. 49, 51, 54, 59, 69, and 72-73.

3.              
RFPs Nos. 5 and 23
The Court
DENIES Senemar’s Motion as to RFPs Nos. 5 and 23, as these RFPs are duplicative
of RFPs Nos. 4 and 22, respectively. 
Based on the
foregoing, the Court GRANTS Senemar’s Motion as to RFPs Nos. 1-4, 6, 8-22,
24-48, 50, 52-53, 55-58, 60-68, and 70-71 and orders Jonathan to provide
code-compliant responses, including production of all responsive documents, on
or before January 31, 2025. The Court DENIES Senemar’s Motion as to RFPs Nos.
5, 23, 49, 51, 54, 59, 69, and 72-73. 
B.            
Senemar’s Motion to Compel Talia’s
Further Responses to Senemar’s RFPs is Granted in Part and Denied in Part
Senemar moves
to compel Talia’s further responses to his RFPs Nos. 1-13, 15-20, and 22-39. (See
Separate Statement in Support of Senmar’s Motion to Compel Talia’s Further
Responses to RFPs.) 
1.              
RFPs Nos. 1-13, 15-16, 19-20, and 22-39
To RFPs Nos. 1,
3-13, 15-16, 19-20, and 22-24, 27-31, and 33-38, Talia provided the following
response:
///
“Plaintiff
objects to this Request on the grounds that it is grossly overbroad, vague,
and  ambiguous; that it is overbroad as
to time; that is compound and/or duplicative of other discovery requests; that
it seeks privileged information, including information protected from
disclosure by the attorney-client privilege and/or the work product doctrine
and/or the physician-patient and/or psychotherapist-patient and/or governmental
information privilege; that it seeks information in violation of Plaintiff’s
privacy rights; that it seeks material neither relevant to this action nor
reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence; that it
is unduly burdensome and oppressive; that it seeks information equally if not
solely available to Defendant; that it fails to specify the documents sought
with sufficient particularity; and that it is intended to vex, injure, annoy,
and harass Plaintiff.  
Subject to
and without waiver of the aforementioned objections, Plaintiff Responds as
follows: Plaintiff will produce all responsive documents within her possession,
custody or control to which She makes no objection.”
To RFPs Nos.
2, 25-26, 32, and 39, Talia provided the above objections only. Senemar is
entitled to further responses to RFPs Nos. 1-13, 15-16, 19-20, and 22-39, as Talia’s
responses are either not code-compliant or assert baseless objections. As an
initial matter, the Court overrules Talia’s objections. Talia must identify
with particularity each document being objected to and the specific ground for
the objection. (See Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.240(b)(1)-(2).) To the extent
Talia believes a request asks for privileged documents, Talia must identify the
particular privilege invoked and “sufficient factual information for other
parties to evaluate the merits of that claim, including, if necessary, a
privilege log.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.240(c)(1).) Simply put, Code of Civil
Procedure § 2031.210(a) presents a multiple-choice question requiring
respondents to select one of three specific options; it does not allow for fill
in the blank or vague “will produce” responses.
The Court
therefore GRANTS Senemar’s Motion as to RFPs Nos. 1-13, 15-16, 19-20, and 22-39
and orders Talia to provide code-compliant responses without objection, including
production of all responsive documents, on or before January 31, 2025. 
2.              
RFPs Nos. 17-18
RFP No. 17
seeks “[a]ll DOCUMENTS memorializing each injury YOU suffered prior to the
INCIDENT to body parts YOU now claim were injured as a result of the INCIDENT.”
RFP No. 18
seeks “[a]ll DOCUMENTS that identify each HEALTH CARE PROVIDER who provided
HEALTH CARE to YOU prior to the INCIDENT to body parts YOU now claim were
injured as a result of the INCIDENT.”
To each, Talia
responded with the same objections and “Plaintiff will produce…” sentence,
listed above. 
To each of
Talia’s responses, Senemar replied with the following reason for further
responses:
“CCP §
2031.280(a) requires that ‘any document or category of documents produced in
response to a demand … shall be identified with the specific request number to
which the documents respond.’ The documents Plaintiff have produced, to the
extent they have, do not comply. A blanket ‘responding party will comply and
produce all documents’ is not code compliance response.  Plaintiff Produced hundreds of pages of
documents with no identification or bates stamps. It is impossible for
defendants to look through the documents and guess which documents respond to
which request. Additionally based on Plaintiffs’ boilerplate objections
defendants cannot ascertain what documents plaintiffs are withholding or the
basis for withholding documents. Defendants are entitled to all evidence
including photographs of the incident to prepare the defense of their case.
Plaintiffs are required to identify documents they are withholding and the
specific objection and reason for withholding the documents. Further yet,
plaintiffs in their response to interrogatories state they have videos of the
defendants, the defendants agents and employees, coming and going, repairing
the property and moving plaintiffs’ furniture out. Defendants are entitled to
all the videos relating to the facts, witnesses and evidence in this action.” 
Senemar is
not entitled to further responses to RFPs Nos. 17 and 18 as they are overbroad
in time and as such are not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of
admissible evidence. Senemar made no attempt to reasonably tailor his requests
by time period. The Court thus finds it appropriate to sustain Talia’s
objections concerning overbreadth. The Court overrules all other objections. 
The Court
therefore DENIES Senemar’s Motion as to RFPs Nos. 17 and 18. 
Based on the
foregoing, the Court GRANTS Senemar’s Motion as to RFPs 1-13, 15-16, 19-20, and
22-39 and orders Talia to provide code-compliant responses without objection, including
production of all responsive documents, on or before January 31, 2025. The
Court DENIES Senemar’s Motion as to RFPs Nos. 17 and 18. 
C.            
Trustee’s Motion to Compel Jonathan’s
Further Responses to Trustee’s RFPs is Granted in Part and Denied in Part
Trustee moves
to compel Jonathan’s further responses to its RFPs Nos. 1-11, 13-20, and 22-39.
(See Separate Statement in Support of Trustee’s Motion to Compel Jonathan’s
Further Responses to RFPs.) 
1.              
RFPs Nos. 1-11, 13, 15-16, 19-20, and
22-39
To RFPs Nos. 1,
3-11, 13, 15-16, 19-20, 22-24, 27-31, and 33-38, Jonathan provided the
following response:
“Plaintiff
objects to this Request on the grounds that it is grossly overbroad, vague,
and  ambiguous; that it is overbroad as
to time; that is compound and/or duplicative of other discovery requests; that
it seeks privileged information, including information protected from
disclosure by the attorney-client privilege and/or the work product doctrine
and/or the physician-patient and/or psychotherapist-patient and/or governmental
information privilege; that it seeks information in violation of Plaintiff’s
privacy rights; that it seeks material neither relevant to this action nor
reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence; that it
is unduly burdensome and oppressive; that it seeks information equally if not
solely available to Defendant; that it fails to specify the documents sought
with sufficient particularity; and that it is intended to vex, injure, annoy,
and harass Plaintiff.  
Subject to
and without waiver of the aforementioned objections, Plaintiff Responds as
follows: Plaintiff will produce all responsive documents within his possession,
custody or control to which he makes no objection.”
To RFPs Nos.
2, 25-26, 32, and 39, Jonathan provided the above objections only. Trustee is
entitled to further responses to RFPs Nos. 1-11, 13, 15-16, 19-20, and 22-39,
as Jonathan’s responses are either not code-compliant or assert baseless
objections. As an initial matter, the Court overrules Jonathan’s objections. Jonathan
must identify with particularity each document being objected to and the
specific ground for the objection. (See Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.240(b)(1)-(2).)
To the extent Jonathan believes a request asks for privileged documents, Jonathan
must identify the particular privilege invoked and “sufficient factual
information for other parties to evaluate the merits of that claim, including,
if necessary, a privilege log.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.240(c)(1).) Simply put,
Code of Civil Procedure § 2031.210(a) presents a multiple-choice question
requiring respondents to select one of three specific options; it does not
allow for fill in the blank or vague “will produce” responses.
The Court
therefore GRANTS Trustee’s Motion as to RFPs Nos. 1-11, 13, 15-16, 19-20, and
22-39, and orders Jonathan to provide code-compliant responses without
objection, including production of all responsive documents, on or before
January 31, 2025. 
2.              
RFPs Nos. 14, and 17-18
RFP No. 14
seeks “[a]ll DOCUMENTS memorializing or reflecting in any fashion the income
YOU received from any source whatsoever during the past ten years, including
but not limited to wage or salary stubs, W-2 forms, accounting work papers,
papers used to calculate tax payments, interest and dividend income records,
contracts and banking records of any sort.”
RFP No. 17
seeks “[a]ll DOCUMENTS memorializing each injury YOU suffered prior to the
INCIDENT to body parts YOU now claim were injured as a result of the INCIDENT.”
RFP No. 18
seeks “[a]ll DOCUMENTS that identify each HEALTH CARE PROVIDER who provided
HEALTH CARE to YOU prior to the INCIDENT to body parts YOU now claim were
injured as a result of the INCIDENT.”
To each, Jonathan
responded with the same objections and “Plaintiff will produce…” sentence,
listed above. 
To each of Jonathan’s
responses, Trustee replied with the following reason for further responses:
“CCP §
2031.280(a) requires that ‘any document or category of documents produced in
response to a demand … shall be identified with the specific request number to
which the documents respond.’ The document’s Plaintiff have produced, to the
extent they have, do not comply. A blanket ‘responding party will comply and
produce all documents’ is not code compliance response.  Plaintiff Produced hundreds of pages of
documents with no identification or bates stamps. It is impossible for
defendants to look through the documents and guess which documents respond to
which request. Additionally based on Plaintiffs’ boilerplate objections
defendants cannot ascertain what documents plaintiffs are withholding or the
basis for withholding documents. Defendants are entitled to all evidence
including photographs of the incident to prepare the defense of their case.
Plaintiffs are required to identify documents they are withholding and the
specific objection and reason for withholding the documents. Further yet,
plaintiffs in their response to interrogatories state they have videos of the
defendants, the defendants agents and employees, coming and going, repairing
the property and moving plaintiffs’ furniture out. Defendants are entitled to
all the videos relating to the facts, witnesses and evidence in this action.” 
Trustee is
not entitled to further responses to RFPs Nos. 14, and 17-18 as they are
overbroad in time and as such are not reasonably calculated to lead to the
discovery of admissible evidence. Trustee made no attempt to reasonably tailor its
RFPs Nos. 17 and 18 by time period, and ten years of income related documents is
unnecessary. The Court thus finds it appropriate to sustain Jonathan’s
objections concerning overbreadth. The Court overrules all other objections. 
The Court
therefore DENIES Trustee’s Motion as to RFPs Nos. 14 and 17-18. 
Based on the
foregoing, the Court GRANTS Trustee’s Motion as to RFPs Nos. 1-11, 13, 15-16,
19-20, and 22-39, and orders Jonathan to provide code-compliant responses
without objection, including production of all responsive documents, on or
before January 31, 2025. The Court DENIES Trustee’s Motion as to RFPs Nos. 14,
and 17-18.
VII.      
SANCTIONS
“The court shall impose a monetary sanction¿. . .¿against any
party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to
compel¿. . .” responses to
interrogatories, requests for production, or request for admission, absent
substantial justification or other circumstances that make imposing the
sanctions unjust.¿(Code Civ.
Proc. §§ 2030.290(c), 2031.300(c), & 2033.290(d).)
Similarly,¿“[t]he court may impose a monetary sanction ordering
that one engaging in the misuse of the discovery process, or any attorney
advising that conduct, or both pay the reasonable expenses, including
attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct.” (Code Civ.
Proc. § 2023.030(a).) Misuse of the discovery process includes “[f]ailing to
respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery,” and “[d]isobeying¿a court order to provide discovery.” (Code Civ.
Proc. § 2023.010(d), (g).) 
First, the Court finds Plaintiffs’ responses were
made without substantial justification and DENIES Plaintiffs’ requests for
sanctions. The Court will next address the reasonableness of the sanctions.
Senemar requests $2,940.00 in discovery sanctions
for its Motion to Compel Jonathan’s Further Responses, accounting for 4.5 hours
to draft the Motion, 4 hours to draft the separate statement, 2.5 hours to
review Jonathan’s Opposition and draft a Reply, and 1 hour for the hearing,
plus the $60.00 filing fee, at a billing rate of $240.00/hr. 
Senemar requests $2,940.00 in discovery sanctions
for its Motion to Compel Talia’s Further Responses, accounting for 4.5 hours to
draft the Motion, 4 hours to draft the separate statement, 2.5 hours to review
Talia’s Opposition and draft a Reply, and 1 hour for the hearing, plus the
$60.00 filing fee, at a billing rate of $240.00/hr. 
Finally, Trustee requests $2,940.00 in discovery
sanctions for its Motion to Compel Jonathan’s Further Responses, accounting for
4.5 hours to draft the Motion, 4 hours to draft the separate statement, 2.5
hours to review Jonathan’s Opposition and draft a Reply, and 1 hour for the
hearing, plus the $60.00 filing fee, at a billing rate of $240.00/hr. 
In total, Defendants’ request $8,820.00 in discovery
sanctions. The Court finds Defendants’ counsel Andrew Morrell’s (“Morrell”)
hourly rate of $240.00 reasonable given the prevailing rates in the Greater Los
Angeles area for attorneys with his level of experience. However, given the
overlapping issues and Defendants’ duplicated hearing requests, the Court finds
it appropriate to award Morrell $3,000.00 in discovery sanctions, which
accounts for 3.5 hours of drafting time per Motion and separate statement [10.5
total hours], 1 hours of drafting time per Reply [2 total hours][3], and 1 hour to attend the hearing, plus the $60.00
filing fee. 
Plaintiffs’ counsel shall pay Defendants’ counsel $3,060.00
in discovery sanctions on or before February 28, 2025.
