The judge, Hon. Michelle C. Kim, has granted American Guard Services' (AGS) motion for terminating sanctions against Justin Biggers' complaint. The judge has dismissed the complaint due to Biggers' failure to comply with discovery orders and his absence from the case. According to CCP section 2023.030, the court may impose terminating sanctions against anyone engaging in conduct that is a misuse of the discovery process. Since Biggers has not complied with any prior discovery orders, the court has granted AGS' motion and dismissed the complaint.
