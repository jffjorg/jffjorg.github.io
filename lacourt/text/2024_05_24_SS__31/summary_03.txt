And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Maria Quintero and Breanna Rios vs. Kandice Alexander Sisco, Inc. The plaintiffs, represented by counsel, have moved to compel defendant Kandice Alexander Sisco to appear for her deposition. The defendant is in pro per, meaning she is representing herself in the case. The plaintiffs served the defendant with the deposition notice via electronic mail on September 19, 2023. However, the defendant did not explicitly consent to electronic service, which is required under California Code of Civil Procedure ยง 1010.6(c). The judge has denied the motion to compel deposition without prejudice, meaning the plaintiffs can re-file the motion if they can demonstrate proper service of the deposition notice. The parties are encouraged to meet and confer to see if they can reach an agreement.
