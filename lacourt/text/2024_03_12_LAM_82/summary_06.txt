And here is a summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to dismiss or compel mandatory dispute resolution between the Global Education Collaborative (GEA) and the Los Angeles Unified School District (District). The dispute arises from GEA's facilities request, which the District denied, and GEA's subsequent initiation of a dispute resolution process under Element 14 of its charter.

The judge finds that the District failed to meet its burden to demonstrate grounds to dismiss the petition and that the District waived its right to enforce the dispute resolution procedures in the charter. The judge concludes that the motion is denied.
