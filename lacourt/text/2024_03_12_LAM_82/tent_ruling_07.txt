[1]           The Court notes that petitioner objects
to the District’s Written Response based on lack of authentication. (See
Pet. Objections to Evidence at 4.) However, petitioner itself relies on the
contents of that written response to argue that the District waived the right
to enforce the dispute resolution procedures. (Opp. at 7:6-9, 11:13-12:9.) Respondent
does not take any position concerning petitioner’s objection. (See Reply
at 11-12, fn. 4.) Accordingly, the Court considers the contents of the Written
Response.
