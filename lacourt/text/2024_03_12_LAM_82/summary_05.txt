And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled to deny the petition for relief from Government Code Section 945.4 filed by Daniel Anselmo Velasquez. Velasquez was injured in a motor vehicle collision caused by an intoxicated driver, Roberto Morelos, who was employed by the City of Los Angeles. Velasquez failed to file a claim with the City within the required six-month period, and his subsequent application to present a late claim was denied. Velasquez's petition for relief is based on his claim that he was not diligent in presenting his claim due to a mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. However, the judge finds that Velasquez's averments are insufficient to establish reasonable diligence. The judge notes that Velasquez's counsel had access to the first page of the traffic collision report, which indicated that Morelos was employed by the City, and that Velasquez did not explain why this report was not sufficient to file a timely claim. The judge concludes that Velasquez failed to demonstrate the diligence necessary to obtain relief under Government Code Section 946.6 and denies the petition.
