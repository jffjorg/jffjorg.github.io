And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the petition for writ of mandate brought by Elizabeth Cruz, seeking to set aside the decision denying her Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) benefits. The judge found that Cruz has not met her burden of proof under CCP § 1094.5 to show a prejudicial abuse of discretion or a denial of a fair trial, or that the respondents proceeded without or in excess of jurisdiction. Additionally, Cruz has not met her burden of proof under CCP § 1085 to demonstrate a ministerial duty on the part of the respondents or her entitlement to performance of that duty. The judge notes that Cruz failed to file an opening brief and lodge the administrative record as ordered, and that the absence of a memorandum is an admission that the motion is not meritorious and may be denied.
