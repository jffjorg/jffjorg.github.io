[TENTATIVE] RULING ON VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT
  OF ADMINISTRATIVE MANDAMUS
 
Dept. 82 (Hon. Curtis A. Kin)




NANCY FARIAS, et al.,
 
 
 


 
 
 
Respondent.
 







 

 



 


 


 


 

 


Petitioner
Elizabeth Cruz petitions for a writ of mandate directing respondents Nancy
Farias, in her capacity as Director, California Employment Development
Department, and California Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board to set aside the
decision denying her Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (“PUA”) benefits. 
 
I.           
Factual
Background
 
Petitioner
provided private tutoring services as an independent contractor. (Pet. ¶¶ 4,
5.) After the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, petitioner applied for PUA
assistance, because she was left with contracts for three students to finish
and could not obtain any other teaching positions due to the closure of
schools. (Pet. ¶¶ 8, 10.)
Business
owners, self-employed workers, and independent contractors who were out of
business or had significantly reduced their services due to the pandemic and
were denied regular unemployment benefits could apply for PUA benefits. (Pet. ¶
1.)
 
The
Employment Development Department (“EDD”) approved petitioner’s application.
(Pet. ¶ 10.) On March 8, 2020, petitioner began receiving weekly benefits in
the amount of $167. (Pet. ¶ 11.) 
 
At
a hearing on April 4, 2021, petitioner was told she had to demonstrate progress
toward returning to work. (Pet. ¶ 12.) On December 3, 2021, petitioner was told
that the evidence she provided to EDD was insufficient to demonstrate that she
planned to be self-employed or employed. (Pet. ¶ 14.) 
 
On
December 13, 2021, petitioner appealed the decision of the EDD. (Pet. ¶ 26.)
Petitioner’s hearing took place on April 4, 2022 by phone before the California
Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board (“Board”). (Pet. ¶¶ 27, 28.) On April 20,
2022, the administrative law judge (“ALJ”) denied the appeal, finding that
petitioner did not substantiate her self-employment from January 1, 2019
through March 8, 2020. (Pet. ¶ 28.) 
 
On
April 27, 2022, petitioner appealed. (Pet. ¶ 30.) On April 20, 2022, the Board
adopted the decision of the ALJ.[1]
(Pet. ¶ 31.) 
 
 
II.      Procedural History
 
            On
December 20, 2022, petitioner filed a Verified Petition for Administrative Mandamus
and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief. No answer has been filed. However,
respondent California Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board specially appeared
during the trial setting conference on July 18, 2023. 
 
            On
July 18, 2023, the Court set the hearing on the writ petition for March 12,
2024. (7/18/23 Minute Order.) The Court ordered petitioner’s opening brief to
be filed sixty days prior to the hearing date, i.e., by January 12, 2024. The
Court ordered petitioner to file a reply and lodge the administrative record fifteen
days prior to the hearing date, i.e., by February 26, 2024. Counsel for petitioner
was present at the trial setting conference. 
 
            Petitioner
has not filed an opening brief in support of the petition or a reply brief. No
opposition brief has been received. The parties have not lodged the administrative
record.
 
III.     Analysis
 
The
petition for writ of mandate is brought pursuant to CCP § 1094.5. (Pet. ¶¶ 16,
24, 25, 32, 34-38.) Under CCP § 1094.5, “the party challenging the
administrative decision bears the burden of convincing the court that the
administrative findings are contrary to the weight of the evidence.” (Fukuda
v. City of Angels (1999) 20 Cal.4th 805, 817; see also Bixby v. Pierno (1971)
4 Cal.3d 130, 139.) “In a section 1094.5 proceeding, it is the responsibility
of the petitioner to produce a sufficient record of the administrative
proceedings; otherwise the presumption of regularity will prevail, since the
burden falls on the petitioner attacking the administrative decision to
demonstrate to the trial court where the administrative proceedings were unfair,
were in excess of jurisdiction, or showed prejudicial abuse of discretion.” (Elizabeth
D. v. Zolin (1993) 21 Cal.App.4th 347, 354.)
 
Petitioner
also seeks traditional or ordinary mandamus relief pursuant to CCP § 1085.
(Pet. ¶ 24; see also Pet. at 12:1-2, 12:17-18, 13:7-8, 14:1-2.) “There
are two essential requirements to the issuance of a traditional writ of
mandate: (1) a clear, present and usually ministerial duty on the part of the
respondent, and (2) a clear, present and beneficial right on the part of the
petitioner to the performance of that duty.” (California Assn. for Health
Services at Home v. State Dept. of Health Services (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th
696, 704.) “An action in ordinary mandamus is proper where…the claim is that an
agency has failed to act as required by law.” (Id. at 705.) An agency is
presumed to have regularly performed its official duties. (Evid. Code § 664.)
“The petitioner always bears the burden of proof in a mandate proceeding
brought under Code of Civil Procedure section 1085.” (California
Correctional Peace Officers Assn. v. State Personnel Bd. (1995) 10 Cal.4th
1133, 1154.)
 
A
memorandum of points and authorities is required for a noticed motion,
including for mandamus. (See CRC 3.1113(a); Local Rule 3.231(b)
[describing noticed motion procedure for prerogative writs].) The absence of a
memorandum is an admission that the motion is not meritorious and may be
denied. (CRC 3.1113(a).) “The memorandum must contain a statement of facts, a
concise statement of the law, evidence and arguments relied on, and a
discussion of the statutes, cases, and textbooks cited in support of the
position advanced.” (CRC 3.1113(b); see also Local Rule 3.231(i)(2)
[opening brief must cite to administrative record].)
 
Rule
of Court 3.1113 “rests on a policy-based allocation of resources, preventing
the trial court from being cast as a tacit advocate for the moving party’s
theories”. (Quantum Cooking Concepts, Inc. v. LV Associates, Inc. (2011)
197 Cal.App.4th 927, 934.) A reviewing court “will not act as counsel for
either party to an appeal and will not assume the task of initiating and
prosecuting a search of the record for any purpose of discovering errors not
pointed out in the briefs.” (Fox v. Erickson (1950) 99 Cal.App.2d 740,
742.) The Court cannot evaluate arguments that are not made in the briefs and
cannot make the parties’ arguments for them. (Nelson v. Avondale HOA
(2009) 172 Cal.App.4th 857, 862-63 [argument waived if not raised]; Pfeifer
v. Countrywide Home Loans, Inc. (2012) 211 Cal.App.4th 1250, 1282 [same].)
 
On
July 18, 2023,
the Court held a trial setting conference. (7/18/23 Minute Order.) The Court
ordered petitioner to serve and file the opening brief at least 60 days prior
to the hearing date of March 12, 2024. (7/18/23 Minute Order.) Petitioner was
ordered to lodge the administrative record on the same day the reply brief was
filed. (7/18/23 Minute Order.)
 
No
opening brief was filed, timely or otherwise. No administrative record was
lodged, timely or otherwise. Accordingly, petitioner has not met her burden of
proof under CCP § 1094.5  to show a
prejudicial abuse of discretion or a denial of a fair trial, or that respondent
proceeded without or in excess of jurisdiction. Petitioner also has not met her
burden of proof under CCP § 1085 to demonstrate a ministerial duty on the part
of respondents or her entitlement to performance of that duty.
 
IV.     Conclusion
 
            The
petition is DENIED.
