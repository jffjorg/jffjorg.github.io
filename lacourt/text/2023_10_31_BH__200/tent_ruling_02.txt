Judge Brenda Penny had appointed Solomon as GAL in
the Trust case on January 31, 2019. Previously, Solomon was appointed as court
appointed counsel (“CAC”) for Mimi in the conservatorship case. He was never
appointed as GAL in the conservatorship case.

Here, Mimi’s conservator would have that power if she lacked capacity to revoke
or amend the trust. (Johnson v. Kotyck (1999) 76 Cal.App.4th
83, 88) 
 


[4] While holding the right to revoke may conflict with Philip’s
own individual interest as beneficiary, if there were grounds to revoke the
Trust, no such grounds have been identified. Moreover, ultimately any actions
he does or does not take will be subject to judicial review on his seeking
discharge and submitting a final accounting for approval. In the interim,
Solomon as Mimi’s GAL has raised no concern. 


[5] In fact, para. 9 of the petition does not allege Philip
is bringing the petition for Mimi as sole beneficiary, though he does allege
she is sole beneficiary. Para. 1 alleges his status as conservator of her
estate. 


[6] Healey has also not shown how that Philip is a Trust
beneficiary himself is now relevant.
