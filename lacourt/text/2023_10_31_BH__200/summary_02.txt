And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling of Judge Brenda Penny addresses the issue of Philip's ability to revoke a trust created by Mimi, the sole beneficiary. Philip, as conservator of Mimi's estate, has petitioned to revoke the trust. The judge notes that while Philip's individual interest as beneficiary may conflict with his role as conservator, there are no grounds to revoke the trust. The judge also cites Johnson v. Kotyck (1999) 76 Cal.App.4th 83, 88, which states that the conservator would have the power to revoke or amend the trust if Mimi lacked capacity to do so. The judge concludes that Philip's actions as conservator will be subject to judicial review and that Solomon, the GAL, has raised no concerns about the petition.
