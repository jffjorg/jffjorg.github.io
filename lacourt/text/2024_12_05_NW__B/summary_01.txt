And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to set aside the dismissal of the case. The plaintiff had filed the action against several defendants, alleging premises liability and general negligence, after slipping and falling on October 16, 2018. The case was dismissed for failure to prosecute after the plaintiff failed to appear at two final status conferences. The plaintiff claims that the dismissal was due to a calendaring error, but the motion fails to include an affidavit of fault as required by California Code of Civil Procedure § 473(b) and does not include the proposed pleading to be filed. The judge finds that the plaintiff's argument has merit, but the motion must be denied due to the lack of required documentation.
