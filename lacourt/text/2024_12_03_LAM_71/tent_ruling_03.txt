AMR BELTAGUI,

FRUIT STREET

 Case No.: 
  23STCV30347
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  December 3, 2024



 
Defendants
Fruit Street Health, P.B.C.’s, Laurence Girard’s, and Christopher Meatto’s demurrer
to Plaintiff Amr Beltagui, M.D.’s 6th cause of action in his first amended complaint
is sustained with 20 days leave to amend and overruled as to the 7th
cause of action.
 
          Defendants Fruit
Street Health, P.B.C. (“FSH”), Laurence Girard (“Girard”), and Christopher
Meatto (“Meatto”) (collectively, “Defendants”) demur to Plaintiff Amr Beltagui,
M.D.’s (“Beltagui”) (“Plaintiff”) first amended complaint (“FAC”) on the
grounds the 6th and 7th causes of action do not state facts sufficient to
constitute causes of action and/or are stated ambiguously and unintelligibly.  (Notice of Demurrer, pg. 2; C.C.P.
§§430.10(e), (f).)
 
Meet and Confer
Before filing a demurrer, the
moving party must meet and confer in person, by
telephone, or by video conference with the party who
filed the pleading to attempt to reach an agreement that would resolve the
objections to the pleading and obviate the need for filing the demurrer.  (C.C.P. §430.41, emphasis added.) 
Defendants’ counsel failed to
submit a meet and confer declaration with the instant demurrer in violation of C.C.P.
§430.41.  However, failure to
sufficiently meet and confer is not grounds to overrule or sustain a demurrer.  (C.C.P. §430.41(a)(4); Dumas v. Los Angeles
County Board of Supervisors (2020) 45 Cal.App.5th 348, 355; Olson v.
Hornbrook Community Services District (2019) 33 Cal.App.5th 502, 515.)  Accordingly, the Court will consider
Defendants’ demurrer.
Based on Defendants’ previous
failure to meet and confer on a demurrer to Plaintiff’s initial Complaint, the
Court notes that it has the discretion to continue the hearing, or take the
motion off calendar, and order a conference pursuant to C.C.P. §430.41(c)
before ruling on a demurrer where (1) the demurring party failed to file a
declaration reporting on the meet and confer, or (2) the other party refused to
meet or failed to meet in good faith.  A
party’s violation of C.C.P. §430.41 might draw C.C.P. §128.5 sanctions.  Continued violations of the meet and
confer requirement may result in future consequences to Defendants.
 
          Background
          Plaintiff
filed his initial complaint on December 12, 2023, against Defendants alleging
seven causes of action: (1) sale of unqualified security; (2) operating an
unlicensed broker-dealer; (3) recission/damages pursuant to Corp. Code §25401;
(4) breach of fiduciary duty; (5) constructive fraud; (6) negligence; and (7)
damages pursuant to Penal Code §496.  
          On August 12,
2024, this Court overruled Defendants’ demurrer to the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and
5th causes of action, and sustained Defendants’ demurrer to the 6th and 7th
causes of action with 20 days leave to amend. 
(See 8/12/24 Minute Order.)
          On August
12, 2024, Plaintiff file the operative FAC. 
Plaintiff’s causes of action arise from Plaintiff’s alleged purchase of
FSH stock and options, which Plaintiff alleges were not registered or qualified
securities for sale.  (See FAC
¶¶7-13.)
          Defendants
filed the instant demurrer on September 16, 2024.  Plaintiff filed his opposition on November
18, 2024.  As of the date of this hearing
no reply has been filed.
 
Summary of
Demurrer
Defendants demur
to the 6th and 7th causes of action on the basis they fail to state facts
sufficient to constitute causes of action, is uncertain, and is barred by the
applicable statute of limitations. 
(Demurrer, pgs. 3-5.)
 
Legal Standard
“[A] demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of the allegations in a
complaint.” (Lewis v. Safeway, Inc. (2015) 235 Cal.App.4th 385,
388.)  A demurrer can be used only to
challenge defects that appear on the face of the pleading under attack or from
matters outside the pleading that are judicially noticeable.  (See Donabedian v. Mercury Insurance Co. (2004)
116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994 [in ruling on a demurrer, a court may not consider
declarations, matters not subject to judicial notice, or documents not accepted
for the truth of their contents].)  For
purposes of ruling on a demurrer, all facts pleaded in a complaint are assumed
to be true, but the reviewing court does not assume the truth of conclusions of
law.  (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital
District (1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 967.)
 
Failure to State
a Claim
Negligence (6th
COA)
“The elements of
a cause of action for negligence are well established. They are (a) a legal
duty to use due care; (b) a breach of such legal duty; [and] (c) the breach as
the proximate or legal cause of the resulting injury.”  (Ladd v. County of San Mateo (1996) 12
Cal.4th 913, 917, internal quotations omitted.)
Plaintiff alleges
at all times described herein, each of the Defendants owed Plaintiff a duty of
care to conduct themselves as would a reasonable issuer of securities and of
persons selling securities.  (FAC ¶41.)
Plaintiff alleges
each of the Defendants breached that duty of care by not ensuring that the securities
they were selling were registered or met an exemption and not adequately
disclosing the risks and prospects of Plaintiff making a profit on the
securities they sold him.  (FAC ¶42.)
Plaintiff alleges
he was supplied with a Private Placement Memorandum (“PPM”) purportedly
disclosing the risks of investing in FSH and requiring that each investor be an
“Accredited Investor.”  (FAC ¶43.)
Plaintiff alleges
he filled out and signed the PPM as instructed by Girard.  (FAC ¶44.) 
Plaintiff alleges the PPM, in accordance with SEC rules and regulations,
required that FSH obtain documentation proving that all investors meet the
Accredited Investor definition.  (FAC
¶44.)  Plaintiff alleges he filled out
whatever sections Girard told him to, and was not aware of the Accredited
Investor requirement, or what the term even meant.  (FAC ¶44.)
Plaintiff alleges
on October 31, 2023, Girard sent Plaintiff an email asking for a letter from Plaintiff’s
CPA verifying Plaintiff’s status as an accredited investor.  (FAC ¶45.)
Plaintiff alleges
Plaintiff had no such letter.  (FAC
¶46.)  Plaintiff alleges On November 1,
2023, Girard asked him to visit a website, www.verifyinvestor.com and supply it
with his tax returns so they can verify him as an Accredited Investor.  (FAC ¶46.)
Plaintiff alleges
on or about November 3, 2023, Plaintiff Googled the term “Accredited Investor” to
find out what it meant.  (FAC ¶47.)  Plaintiff alleges he discovered at that time
the meaning of the term Accredited Investor and discovered that by selling
securities to him, FSH was unlawfully selling unqualified securities.  (FAC ¶47.)
Plaintiff alleges
as a result of Defendants’ acts, errors, and omissions set forth above,
Plaintiff has suffered detriment in that he gave Defendants the majority of his
life savings, by reason of which Plaintiff has been damaged in an amount
believed to be at least in the sum of $475,000. 
(FAC ¶48.)
As he did in his
demurrer to the complaint, Defendant’s continues to argue that the 6th
cause of action is barred by the two-year statute of limitations in C.C.P.
§335.1.   C.C.P. §335.1 applies to negligence causes of
action resulting in personal injury or death. 
The applicable statute of limitations is two years set forth in C.C.P.
§339 because Plaintiff’s cause of action arises from an obligation or liability
not founded upon an instrument of writing. 
Therefore, allegations in Plaintiff’s cause of action for negligence are
barred by the two-year statute of limitations in C.C.P. §339 and allegations of
negligence occurring in November 2021 are therefore barred because Plaintiff
filed his Complaint on December 12, 2023.
Plaintiff fails
to allege in his pleading that the statute of limitations is tolled.  “In order to rely on the discovery rule for
delayed accrual of a cause of action, ‘[a] plaintiff whose complaint shows on
its face that his claim would be barred without the benefit of the discovery
rule must specifically plead facts to show (1) the time and manner of discovery
and (2) the inability to have made earlier discovery despite reasonable
diligence.’” (Alexander v. Exxon Mobil (2013) 219 Cal.App.4th 1236, 1251,
quoting Fox v. Ethicon Endo–Surgery, Inc. (2005) 35 Cal.4th 797, 808.)  Plaintiff’s allegations do not meet the
pleading requirements necessary to rely on the discovery rule for delayed
accrual of a cause of action. 
Specifically, Plaintiff fails to allege the inability to have made the
earlier discovery alleged despite reasonable diligence.  (Id.)
Accordingly,
Defendant’s demurrer to Plaintiff’s 6th cause of action is sustained with
20 days leave to amend.
 
          Damages Pursuant to Penal Code §496
(7th COA)
Penal
Code §496 provides that “any person who has been injured by a violation of
subdivision (a) or (b) may bring an action for three times the amount of actual
damages, if any, sustained by the plaintiff, costs of suit, and reasonable
attorney’s fees.”  (Pen. Code §496(c).)
“While
[Penal Code §496(a)] covers a spectrum of impermissible activity relating to
stolen property, the elements required to show a violation of section 496(a)
are simply that (i) property was stolen or obtained in a manner constituting
theft, (ii) the defendant knew the property was so stolen or obtained, and
(iii) the defendant received or had possession of the stolen property.”  (Switzer v. Wood (2019) 35 Cal.App.5th 116, 126, as modified (May
10, 2019), quoting Lacagnina v. Comprehend Systems, Inc. (2018) 25 Cal.App.5th 955, 970 [stating elements
of Penal Code §496 offense].)
“A
violation of section 496(a) may, by its own terms, relate to property that has
been ‘stolen’ or ‘that has been obtained in any manner constituting theft or
extortion.’”  (Id.,
quoting Pen. Code §496(a).)
          Plaintiff alleges Defendants, and each
of them, violated Penal Code §496 by receiving from Plaintiff property, in the
form of money, which they knew had been obtained by fraudulent and dishonest
means, i.e., misrepresentation of the nature and risks of the investments
offered.  (FAC ¶50.)
          Plaintiff alleges his investment monies
were stolen by means of fraudulent inducement. 
(FAC ¶51.)  Plaintiff alleges he
has asked for the monies to be returned, but Defendants have refused.  (FAC ¶51.)
          Plaintiff alleges by reason of the
foregoing, Plaintiff has been damaged in the amount of $475,000, or according
to proof, and are entitled to the relief described in the statute, including but
not limited to treble damages, attorneys’ fees, and interest.  (FAC ¶52.)
          Plaintiff sufficiently alleges his $475,000
was “stolen” or “[was] obtained in any manner constituting theft or
extortion.”  (Pen. Code §496(a).)  Plaintiff alleges Defendants, and each of
them, violated Penal Code § 496 by receiving from
Plaintiff
property, in the form of money.  (FAC
¶50.)  Plaintiff alleges his investment
monies were “stolen by means of fraudulent inducement,” which constitutes an
allegation of theft.  (FAC ¶51.) Section 496(a)
extends to property “that has been obtained in any manner constituting theft.”  (Bell v. Feibush (2013) 212
Cal.App.4th 1041, 1048.)
          Accordingly, Defendants’ demurrer to
Plaintiff’s 7th cause of action is overruled.
 
          Conclusion
Defendants’
demurrer to Plaintiff’s 6th causes of action is sustained with 20 days
leave to amend and overruled as to the 7th cause of action.
Moving Party to give
notice.
