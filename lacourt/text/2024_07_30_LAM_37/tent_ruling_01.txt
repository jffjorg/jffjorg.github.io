Background
 
On August 8, 2023, David Feeley
(“Feeley) and Porter Ranch Physical Therapy, Inc. (“Porter Ranch PT”)
(collectively “Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint against Jeffrey R. Vargo
(“Vargo”); Vargo Physical Therapy (“Vargo PT”) (collectively “Defendants”); and
Does 1 to 50. Plaintiff alleges that he was part of a joint venture with
Defendants to operate a chain of physical therapy clinics until he was
wrongfully ousted from the joint venture. 
 
The First Amended Complaint
(“FAC”) alleges six causes of action: (1) Breach of Contract; (2) Conversion;
(3) Breach of Fiduciary Duty; (4) Civil Theft (Pen. Code § 496(c)); (5)
Declaratory Relief; and (6) Violation of Corp. Code §§ 1601, 1602.) 
 
On April 8, 2024, Plaintiffs
dismissed the sixth cause of action. 
 
On April 26, 2024, the court
sustained Defendants’ demurrer to the FAC with leave to amend but overruled the
demurrer to the second cause of action for conversion. (Order 04/26/2024.) 
 
On May 20. 2024. Plaintiff
filed the operative Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”) alleging five causes of
action: (1) Breach of Contract; (2) Conversion; (3) Breach of Fiduciary Duty;
(4) Receipt of Stolen Property (Pen. Code § 496(c)); (5) Declaratory Relief;
and (6) Violation of Corp. Code §§ 1601, 1602.)
 
Defendants now demurrer to the
SAC and move to strike portions of the SAC. Plaintiffs oppose the motions. The
matter is now before the court. 
 
Discussion
 
I.         Legal Standard
 
A.        Demurrer 
 
A demurrer is an
objection to a pleading, the grounds for which are apparent from either the
face of the complaint or a matter of which the court may take judicial notice.
(CCP § 430.30, subd. (a); see also Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311,
318.)¿“To survive a demurrer, the complaint need only allege facts
sufficient to state a cause of action; each evidentiary fact that might
eventually form part of the plaintiff’s proof need not be alleged.”¿(C.A. v.
William S. Hart Union High School Dist. (2012) 53
Cal.4th 861, 872.)¿For the purpose of testing the sufficiency of the cause of action, the
demurrer admits the truth of all material facts properly pleaded.¿ (Aubry v.
Tri-City Hospital Dist. (1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 966-967.)¿A demurrer “does
not admit contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law.”¿(Daar v.
Yellow Cab Co. (1967) 67 Cal.2d 695, 713.)¿¿ 
 
B.        Motion to Strike 
 
¿Any party, within the time allowed to respond to a pleading
may serve and file a notice of motion to strike the whole or any part thereof.
(CCP § 435(b)(1); CRC, rule 3.1322(b).) The court may, upon a motion or at any
time in its discretion and upon terms it deems proper: (1) strike out any
irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading; or (2) strike
out all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the
laws of California, a court rule, or an order of the court. (CCP § 436(a)-(b); Stafford
v. Shultz (1954) 42 Cal.2d 767, 782 [“Matter in a pleading which is not
essential to the claim is surplusage; probative facts are surplusage and may be
stricken out or disregarded”].)¿¿¿¿ 
 
C.        Leave to Amend 
 
“Where the defect raised by a motion to strike or by demurrer
is reasonably capable of cure, leave to amend is routinely and liberally
granted to give the plaintiff a chance to cure the defect in question.” (CLD
Construction, Inc. v. City of San Ramon (2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 1141, 1146.)
The burden is on the complainant to show the Court that a pleading can be
amended successfully. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.)¿¿¿ 
 
II.        Demurrer[1]
 
A.        Alter-Ego and
Conspiracy Allegations
 
Defendants demur to the entire SAC on the basis that the
civil conspiracy and alter ego allegations are insufficient to sustain any of
the causes of action alleged against Defendant Vargo. 
 
“To succeed on
their alter ego claim, plaintiffs must be able to show: (1) such a unity of
interest and ownership between the corporation and its equitable owner that no
separation actually exists, and (2) an inequitable result if the acts in
question are treated as those of the corporation alone.” (Leek v. Cooper
(2011) 194 Cal.App.4th 399, 417.) However, on demurrer, the court does not
consider whether the plaintiff will be able to prove the allegations. (See Stevens
v. Superior Court (1986) 180 Cal.App.3d 605, 609–610; Fisher v. San
Pedro Peninsula Hospital (1989) 214 Cal.App.3d 590, 604.)  
 
Instead, the court
focuses on whether the complaint sets forth facts sufficient to put the
defendant on notice about what the plaintiff is complaining about and what
remedies are being sought. (Leek, supra, 194 Cal.App.4th at p.
415.) “The particularity required in pleading
facts depends on the extent to which the defendant in fairness needs detailed
information that can be conveniently provided by the plaintiff.” (Ludgate
Ins. Co. v. Lockheed Martin Corp. (2000) 82 Cal.App.4th 592, 608.) Detailed pleading is not required to allege an alter ego
theory of liability.¿Indeed, “[i]t is not even essential, apparently, that ...
the alter ego doctrine always be specifically pleaded in the complaint in order
for it to be applied in appropriate circumstances. [¶] ... [Citation.] ...
[C]ourts have followed a liberal policy of applying the alter ego doctrine
where the equities and justice of the situation appear to call for it rather
than restricting it to the technical niceties depending upon pleading and
procedure. It is essential principally that a showing be made that both
requirements, i.e., unity of interest and ownership, and the promotion of
injustice by the fiction of corporate separate existence, exist in a given
situation.”¿ (First Western Bank & Trust Co. v. Bookasta (1968) 267
Cal.App.2d 910, 915 [italics omitted]; see Rutherford Holdings, LLC v. Plaza
Del Rey (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 221, 236 [stating “only ‘ultimate rather
than evidentiary facts' ” necessary to support alter ego theory].)¿ 
 
The SAC alleges that a unity of ownership and interest exits
between Defendants Vargo and Vargo PT. (SAC, ¶ 11.) 
 
The SAC alleges on information and belief that Vargo
commingled his own personal funds with those of Vargo PT and that he dominated
the controlled the company, failed to follow corporate formalities, and used
Vargo PT’s funds for his personal expenses without sufficient capital for the
type of business he conducted through Vargo PT and for foreseeable liabilities.
(SAC, ¶¶ 11, 24, 39.) 
 
This included “withdrawing substantially all of the funds
from the corporation to himself for his sole benefit.” (SAC, ¶ 12.) Accordingly,
Vargo used Vargo PT as a mere shell to conduct his own personal activities.
(SAC, ¶ 11.) Moreover, an injustice would result because Vargo represented to
Plaintiff that he would be involved in the joint venture agreement. (SAC, ¶¶ 12,
14, 15, 28.) Despite these representations, in January 2023, Vargo locked
Plaintiff out of the joint venture. (SAC, ¶¶ 23, 31.) Afterward, Vargo and
Vargo PT diverted the Plaintiffs’ monthly distribution and profit share to
themselves and for Vargo's own personal benefit. (SAC, ¶¶ 24, 39, 44, 50.) Plaintiff’s
ouster was done at the direction of Vargo who completely dominated and
controlled Vargo PT. (SAC, ¶ 31.) Accordingly, an injustice would result if the
corporate veil were not pierced and Vargo is made personally liable for the
acts and liabilities of Vargo PT. (SAC, ¶ 12.) 
 
At
the pleading stage, Plaintiffs are not required to allege evidentiary facts,
only ultimate facts to support a claim for alter ego liability. (Rutherford
Holdings, LLC, supra, 223 Cal.App.4th at p. 236.) “The distinction
between conclusions of law and ultimate facts is not at all clear and involves
at most a matter of degree.” (Burks
v. Poppy Const. Co.
(1962) 57 Cal.2d 463, 473 [explaining that “courts have permitted allegations
which obviously included conclusions of law and have termed them ‘ultimate
facts' or ‘conclusions of fact.’”].) “What is important is that the complaint
as a whole contain sufficient facts to apprise the defendant of the basis upon
which the plaintiff is seeking relief.” (Perkins v. Superior Court (1981)
117 Cal.App.3d 1, 6.) 
 
Having
examined the SAC in its entirety, the court finds that Plaintiffs have pled
sufficient allegations to support a finding of alter ego liability. Specifically,
that Vargo shares a unity of interest and ownership in Vargo PT and that an
injustice would result if Vargo PT is treated as a sole actor because Vargo PT
is a mere shell of Vargo and Vargo used Vargo PT as his personal piggy bank and
to divert Plaintiffs’ share of the monthly distribution and profit share. 
 
The
demurrer to the entire SAC based on improperly pled alter ego allegations is
overruled. The court declines to decide if Plaintiff’s civil conspiracy
allegations are sufficient because no civil conspiracy is alleged as to a
specific cause of action and a demurrer on this basis would not dispose of an
entire cause of action. “A
demurrer cannot rightfully be sustained to part of a cause of action or to a
particular type of damage or remedy.” (Kong v. City of Hawaiian Gardens
Redevelopment Agency (2002) 108 Cal.App.4th 1028, 1047.)
 
Based
on the above the demurrer to the entire SAC based on failure to pled alter ego liability
of civil conspiracy is overruled. 
 
B.        Sham Pleading Doctrine 
 
Defendants assert that
Plaintiff improperly altered certain allegations and that such allegations
should be disregarded as a sham pleading. (Compare FAC ¶ 14 (“Feeley would also retain his
shares of Porter Ranch PT, while sharing the profits from that office 50/50
with Vargo PT.”), with SAC ¶ 15 (“Feeley would retain his shares of Porter
Ranch PT, while splitting the profits from the Porter Ranch clinic 50/50 with
Vargo and Vargo PT.”) “Under the sham pleading doctrine, plaintiffs are
precluded from amending complaints to omit harmful allegations, without
explanation, from previous complaints to avoid attacks raised in demurrers or
motions for summary judgment.”  (Deveny
v. Entropin, Inc. (2006) 139 Cal.App.4th 408, 425.)  
 
Plaintiff asserts that the exclusion of Vargo in the FAC as participating
in the profit split is a typo limited to one sentence that is corrected in the
SAC and the FAC stated facts showing that Vargo participated in the profit
sharing. (See FAC, ¶¶ 2, 26, 36.)
 
The court finds there is no sham pleading and that even if
there was, it would not warrant sustaining the demurrer as to the alter ego
allegations. 
 
C.        Fourth Cause
of Action - Receipt of Stolen Property (Pen. Code § 496(c)
 
Penal Code § 496(c) allows any
person injured by receipt of stolen property under Penal Code § 496(a) to
“bring an action for three times the amount of actual damages, if any,
sustained by the plaintiff, costs of suit, and reasonable attorney’s fees.”
(Pen. Code, § 496(a).) 
 
The
California Supreme Court in Siry Investment, L.P. v. Farkhondehpour
(2022) 13 Cal.5th 333 determined that to prevail under Penal Code § 496
Plaintiff must prove “theft” as defined by Penal Code § 484 and not common law
fraud. To prove theft, a plaintiff must establish criminal intent on the part
of the defendant beyond ‘mere proof of nonperformance or actual falsity.’” (Id.
at 361-362 citing People v. Ashley (1954) 42 Cal.2d 246, 264.)
 
Penal
Code § 484(a) defines theft as: 
 
(a) Every person who 
[1] shall feloniously steal, take,
carry, lead, or drive away the personal property of another, or 
[2] shall fraudulently appropriate
property which has been entrusted to him or her..., or 
[3] shall knowingly and designedly, by
any false or fraudulent representation or pretense, defraud any other person of money, labor or real or personal
property... is guilty of theft. 
 
Defendants demur to the fourth cause of action because the SAC
fails to allege facts that Vargo or Vargo PT had the requisite felonious intent
to commit theft. 
 
The SAC alleges: 
 
Defendants have received, concealed, or
withheld property that they knew was obtained through theft. This includes,
without limitation, the receipt of money Defendants knew belonged to Plaintiffs
as Plaintiffs’ share of profit distributions from clinics that the parties
owned and joint ventures.
 
(SAC, ¶ 45.) 
 
The court agrees that the above allegations are insufficient
to show “theft” as defined by section 484(a). Plaintiffs’ opposition also fails
to point out to other allegations in the SAC that show Defendants acted with
the requisite felonious intent for section 496(a) liability. Moreover, the
California Supreme Court in Siry II, imposed a “criminal intent” element
for section 496(a) liability that requires the defendant not “innocently or inadvertently, but with careful planning and
deliberation reflecting the requisite criminal intent.” (Siry, supra,
13 Cal.5th at p. 362 [italics added].)
 
Therefore,
the demurrer to the fourth cause of action is sustained with leave to amend. 
 
III.      Motion to
Strike
 
Defendants move to strike the conversion cause of action on the
basis that Plaintiff exceeded the scope of leave granted by this court’s order
sustaining in part Defendants’ demurrer to the FAC. 
 
Defendants assert that the SAC added additional allegations
about the Defendants’ alleged conversion of the property. (SAC, ¶ 37.) The
court overruled the demurrer to the conversion cause of action. 
 
“The plaintiff may not amend the complaint to add a new
cause of action without having obtained permission to do so, unless the new
cause of action is within the scope of the order granting leave to amend.” (Harris v. Wachovia Mortgage, FSB (2010) 185 Cal.App.4th 1018, 1023.) The court finds that
because the demurrer to the conversion cause of action was overruled, any new
allegations or facts added to the conversion cause of action are within the
scope of the order granting leave to amend because no new causes of action or
new Defendants were added to the pleading. If Defendants felt the demurrer to
the conversion claim was erroneous or that the new allegations rendered the
conversion claim insufficient, Defendants were free to challenge the claim by
demurrer. (See Ion Equipment Corp. v. Nelson (1980) 110 Cal.App.3d 868, 877.)  
 
Defendants’
motion to strike is denied. 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendants’ demurrer to the SAC is
overruled and sustained in part. The demurrer is sustained with 10 days leave
to amend as to the fourth cause of action and is otherwise overruled.
Defendants’ motion to strike is denied. The court sets an OSC RE: Amended
Complaint for August 15, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. Defendant to give notice.
