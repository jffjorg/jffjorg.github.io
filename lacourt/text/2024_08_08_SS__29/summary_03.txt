And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has tentatively ruled that the hearing will be continued to August 15, 2024, at 1:30 pm. Before the hearing, Counsel must file proof of service of the motion and supporting papers on the Plaintiff and bring a courtesy copy to the Court. The Court also orders Counsel to give notice of the continuance to the Plaintiff and file proof of service of such notice. The Court wants to hear from the Plaintiff regarding whether she agrees or disagrees with Counsel's withdrawal as counsel and also wants to hear from Plaintiff's counsel, the Plaintiff, and the Defendants regarding the issue of prejudice and whether a further continuance of trial should be ordered.
