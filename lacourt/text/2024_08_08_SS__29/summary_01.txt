Summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion filed by the Plaintiff, Peter Valdes, seeking evidence, issue, and terminating sanctions against the Defendant, Costco Wholesale Corporation. The Plaintiff contends that the Defendant has failed to comply with discovery orders, including failing to produce all training videos responsive to Request No. 6. The Judge has previously granted the Plaintiff's motion to compel production of documents, but the Defendant has only produced low-quality videos. The Judge has denied the Plaintiff's request for sanctions, finding that the Plaintiff has not shown sufficient prejudice from the Defendant's failure to produce the additional documents. The Judge has also rejected the Defendant's argument that the motion is untimely, finding that the ex parte application to continue trial was based on the Plaintiff's need for additional time to bring a motion for sanctions. The Judge has concluded that the Plaintiff's motion is denied without prejudice as it relates to the Defendant's violation of the May 1 Minute Order.
