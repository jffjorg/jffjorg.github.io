Tentative
The

or does not agree that her lawyer should be relieved from representing her.

Background
On February 24, 2022, Plaintiff Molly Jean
Sliwoski (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Defendant Extended Stay
America, Inc.; ESA P Porfolio Operating Lessee, LLC (“ESAP”); and Does 1
through 100, asserting causes of action for negligence and premises
liability.  Plaintiff alleges that on September 29, 2020, while
Plaintiff was visiting a guest at Defendant’s premises, she sat on a bench, the
bench collapsed, and she sustained injuries as a result.
On March 30, 2022, ESAP filed its answer.
On July 21, 2022, Plaintiff amended the complaint
to name ESH Hospitality, Inc., as Doe 1.
On September 19, 2022, Defendant ESA Management,
LLC (“ESAM”), erroneously sued as Extended Stay America, Inc. and ESH
Hospitality, Inc., filed its answer.
On June 12, 2023, Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint
(“FAC”).  On June 16, 2023, ESAP and ESAM (collectively,
“Defendants”) filed an answer to the FAC.
On June 20, 2024,
Justin Farahi (“Counsel”) filed this motion to be relieved as counsel. No
opposition has been filed. 
 
The hearing was
initially set for July 22.  On June 25,
the Court denied Plaintiff’s ex parte application to advance the hearing; the
Court also ordered Counsel to be present in person at the hearing, as the Court
“may wish to hear from counsel in chambers regarding the basis of the request
for a continuance.”
 
Following the
cyber attack on the Los Angeles Superior Court that began on or about July 19,
2024, the Court was unable to proceed with the hearing on July 22 and continued
the hearing to August 8, 2024.
 
On July 30, 2024,
Counsel filed a declaration stating that he is unable to attend the hearing in
person on August 8 and asking that the hearing be continued to a date on or
after August 13.
 
Trial is currently
set for August 26, 2024.
 
Legal
Standard
The court may order that an attorney be changed or
substituted at any time before or after judgment or final determination upon
request by either client or attorney and after notice from one to the other.
(Code of Civ. Proc., § 284(b).) An attorney is permitted to withdraw where
conflicts between the attorney and client make it unreasonable to continue the
representation. (See Cal. Rules of Prof. Conduct 3-700(C)(1).) “The
determination whether to grant or deny a motion to withdraw as counsel lies
within the sound discretion of the trial court.” (Manfredi & Levine v.
Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128, 1133.)   
 
An application to be relieved as counsel must be made on
Judicial Counsel Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion) (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1362(a)), MC-052 (Declaration) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(c)),
and MC-053 (Proposed Order) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362(e)).   
 
Further, the requisite forms must be served on the client
and all other parties who have appeared in the case. (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.1362(d).) The court may delay effective date of the order relieving
counsel until proof of service of a copy of the signed order on the client has
been filed with the court. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(e).) 
 
Discussion
Counsel has
filed the Notice, Declaration, and Order to be Relieved as Counsel for
Plaintiff. In the Declaration, Counsel contends Plaintiff was to be served by
personal service. (Decl., No. 3.a.(1).) 
No sufficient proof
of personal service has been filed with the Court.
At the request
of Counsel, the hearing is CONTINUED to August 15, 2024, at 1:30 pm.
The Court ORDERS
Counsel to file with the Court, prior to the hearing, proof of service of the
motion and supporting papers on Plaintiff (and to bring a courtesy copy to the
Court at the time of the hearing).
Conclusion
The Court CONTINUES
the hearing is CONTINUED to August 15, 2024, at 1:30 pm, in Department 29 of
the Spring Street Courthouse.
The Court ORDERS
Counsel to file with the Court, prior to the hearing, proof of service of the
motion and supporting papers on Plaintiff (and to bring a courtesy copy to the
Court at the time of the hearing).
The Court ORDERS
Counsel to give notice of this continuance, including to Plaintiff; to file proof
of service of such notice; and to bring a courtesy copy of the proof of service
to Court at the time of the hearing.
