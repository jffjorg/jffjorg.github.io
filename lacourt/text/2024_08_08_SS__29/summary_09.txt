Summary in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to quash four subpoenas issued by the defendant to obtain the plaintiff's medical records. The subpoenas were issued for records from various health care providers, including Dr. Yuan, Northeast Valley Health Corporation, Randy Martin, OMD, and Neurological Institute of Los Angeles. The plaintiff argued that the subpoenas invade her right to privacy and that the requested records are not relevant to the case. The court agreed that the subpoenas are a serious intrusion into the plaintiff's privacy, but found that the defendant has a legitimate interest in obtaining some of the requested records. The court granted the motion to quash the subpoena directed to Dr. Yuan, but modified the other subpoenas to limit them to records related to the plaintiff's neck, lower back, hips, gluteal area, head, shoulder, pelvis, feet, and hands, and to records from five years prior to the accident to the present. The court denied the motion to quash the remaining subpoenas.
