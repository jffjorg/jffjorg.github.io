Legal
Standard
The court may order that an attorney be changed or
substituted at any time before or after judgment or final determination upon
request by either client or attorney and after notice from one to the other.
(Code of Civ. Proc., § 284(b).) An attorney is permitted to withdraw where
conflicts between the attorney and client make it unreasonable to continue the
representation. (See Cal. Rules of Prof. Conduct 3-700(C)(1).) “The
determination whether to grant or deny a motion to withdraw as counsel lies
within the sound discretion of the trial court.” (Manfredi & Levine v.
Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128, 1133.)   
 
An application to be relieved as counsel must be made on
Judicial Counsel Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion) (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.1362(a)), MC-052 (Declaration) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.136(c)), and
MC-053 (Proposed Order) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362(e)).   
 
Further, the requisite forms must be served on the client
and all other parties who have appeared in the case. (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.1362(d).) The court may delay effective date of the order relieving
counsel until proof of service of a copy of the signed order on the client has
been filed with the court. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(e).) 
 
Discussion
 
Counsel has
filed the Notice, Declaration, and Order to be Relieved as Counsel on July 24,
2024 for the August 8, 2024 hearing. Proof of service shows service on
Plaintiff on July 25, 2024. Papers related to this motion needed to be served
on Plaintiff 16 court days prior to the hearing, July 17, 2024. (see Code of
Civ. Proc., §§ 1005(b).) Therefore, service in Plaintiff is untimely.
Further, service
on the remaining parties is untimely, as two additional court days for
electronic service, requires other parties to be served on July 15, 2024;
parties were served on July 19. (see Code of Civ. Proc., §§ 1005(b), 1010.6(a)(3)(B).)
Accordingly, the
hearing on the motion is CONTINUED.
Conclusion
The Court
CONTINUES the hearing for approximately 30 days.
The Court ORDERS
Plaintiff’s counsel to give notice to Plaintiff and all other parties who have
appeared and have not been dismissed at least 16 court days prior to the
hearing and to file proof of service with the Court.
