Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion for terminating sanctions. The defendant had sought to terminate the case due to the plaintiff's failure to comply with the court's order and the requirements of the Civil Discovery Act. However, the judge found that the defendant had not presented sufficient evidence of repeated and willful misuse of the discovery process, and that less severe sanctions had not been pursued. The judge also noted that a terminating sanction would create a "windfall" for the defendant, and that the primary purpose of discovery sanctions is to obtain compliance with the Civil Discovery Act and the court's orders, not to punish.
