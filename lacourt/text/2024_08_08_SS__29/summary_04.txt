Summary:

The Judge denies Defendant Jerome Winfield's motion to reopen discovery in the case of Calzada Martinez v. Winfield. The motion is denied for two independent reasons: (1) Defendant failed to meet and confer with the parties before filing the motion, as required by Code of Civil Procedure section 2024.050; and (2) Defendant did not show a basis to reopen discovery, as he had ample opportunity to conduct discovery before the cutoff date and failed to demonstrate diligence in seeking the discovery he now contends is critical. The Judge concludes that Defendant has not shown good cause for reopening discovery and denies the motion.
