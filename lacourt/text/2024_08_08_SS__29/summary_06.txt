- A terminating sanction should not be imposed until the court has attempted less severe alternatives and found them to be unsuccessful and/or the record clearly shows lesser sanctions would be ineffective.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the defendant's motion for terminating sanctions. The defendant had sought to have the plaintiff's case terminated due to the plaintiff's failure to comply with discovery orders. However, the judge found that the defendant had not presented sufficient evidence to show that the plaintiff's actions were willful and repeated, and that less severe sanctions would not lead to compliance with the discovery rules. The judge noted that a terminating sanction would create a "windfall" for the defendant and would not serve the purpose of obtaining compliance with the discovery rules. The judge also indicated that the defendant had not pursued lesser sanctions, such as monetary sanctions or evidence sanctions, and therefore the motion for terminating sanctions was denied.
