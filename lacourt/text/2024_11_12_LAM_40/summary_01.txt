And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled to take off calendar the defendant's motion for leave to file a 20-page demurrer. The reason for this decision is that the defendant failed to serve the plaintiff with the motion. The proof of service filed by the defendant indicates that the motion was filed in the court's e-filing system, but it does not show that the motion was delivered to the plaintiff. Additionally, the proof of service does not make the required disclosures with respect to service of the motion on the plaintiff. The judge is following the rules of the California Code of Civil Procedure and the California Rules of Court, which require that proof of electronic service be filed at least five court days before the hearing.
