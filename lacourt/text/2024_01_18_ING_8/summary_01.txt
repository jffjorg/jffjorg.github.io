And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's request for sanctions against the plaintiff's law firm in the amount of $2,500. The judge found that the plaintiff's law firm failed to provide discovery responses in a timely manner, despite multiple extensions being granted. The judge also found that the law firm's former counsel departed from the firm without resolving outstanding discovery requests, which contributed to the delay. The judge reduced the amount of sanctions from the requested $5,900 to $2,500, taking into account the duplicative court reporter fees and the fact that no opposition was filed to the motions to compel. The judge ordered the plaintiff and/or the plaintiff's law firm to pay the sanctioned amount to the defendant's counsel by February 1, 2024.
