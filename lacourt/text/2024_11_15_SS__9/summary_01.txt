And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is ordering the plaintiff, Blanca A. Amezcua, to retain licensed counsel to proceed with the class action lawsuit. The plaintiff has failed to comply with previous court orders to file a substitution of counsel and appear at a hearing. The plaintiff has also failed to file a class certification motion, which was due on November 8, 2024. The judge is setting a new hearing for January 22, 2025, at which the plaintiff must explain why sanctions, including dismissal and striking of class allegations, should not be imposed for failure to comply with the court's orders. The plaintiff is also ordered to file a declaration explaining the failure to appear and comply with the court's orders by January 3, 2025. If the plaintiff fails to appear at the next hearing, it will be deemed consent to strike and dismiss all class allegations. The judge is also lifting the stay on all discovery and setting the matter for a bench trial on March 10, 2025.
