And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion from the plaintiff to gather information about the defendant, Jogani, in relation to his business dealings and ownership of the Subject Property. Specifically, the plaintiff is seeking to know whether Jogani has divested himself of any interests he once held in the property, and whether Jogani denies being the owner of the property. The judge will also evaluate whether Jogani has used the California court system to sue others, including seeking evictions against his tenants. To support their motion, the plaintiff has presented three forms of evidence, including a jury verdict form, a court order, and Secretary of State records showing Jogani as the sole director of J.K. Properties, Inc. The judge will consider these documents in making a ruling.
