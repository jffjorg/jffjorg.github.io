And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion for determination of good faith settlement. The defendant moved for this determination after reaching a settlement with the plaintiff for a confidential amount. The settlement released the defendant from all present and prospective claims arising between the parties. The defendant argued that it would have had very low proportionate liability, if any at all, and that the settlement amount was "within the ballpark" of its potential liability. The judge found that the settlement was fairly agreed upon and made in good faith, based on the lack of objections and evidence of bad faith, as well as the defendant's very low potential liability.
