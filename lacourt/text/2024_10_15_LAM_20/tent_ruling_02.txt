BACKGROUND
On May 18, 2023, Madison-MF McCadden CA
LLC (Plaintiff) filed an unlawful detainer complaint against Victor Vicente (Defendant),
seeking repayment of past due rent pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section
1161(2). The complaint alleges that Defendant failed to pay Plaintiff rent in
the amount of $3,840.00/month from April 1, 2022 and March 1, 2023 ($46,080.00
total). Plaintiff past-due rent, reasonable attorney fees, and forfeiture of
the rental agreement.
On June 6, 2023, Defendant demurred
claiming Plaintiff’s complaint is improperly unverified. The court overruled
Defendant’s demurrer. (07/19/2023 - Minute Order.)
On July 24, 2023, Defendant filed an
answer denying all factual allegations and asserting fifteen (15) affirmative
defenses including retaliatory eviction and breach of the implied warranty of
habitability.
On July 29, 2024, Defendant filed a motion
for summary judgment. On August 23, 2024, the court took the motion off the
calendar because Plaintiff filed a Notice of Stay of Proceedings for Bankruptcy
on August 22, 2024. (08/23/2024 - Minute Order.)
On August 23, 2024, the court ordered a
stay in this case because Defendant filed for Bankruptcy. (08/23/2024 - Minute
Order.) Defendant’s Bankruptcy case was dismissed on September 9, 2024. (Motion
for Summary Judgment, Exh. 3, at p. 4.)
On September 19, 2024, Defendant filed
this motion for summary judgment.
As of October 8, 2024, no opposition has
been filed.

DISCUSSION
Applicable
Law
A motion for summary judgment shall be
granted if all the papers submitted show that there is no triable issue as to
any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a
matter of law. (Code Civ. Proc. § 437c, subd. (c).) A party may also bring a
noticed motion for summary adjudication that one or more causes of action has
no merit. (Code Civ. Proc. § 437c, subd. (f)(1).) 
The moving party has the initial burden to
show either (1) one or more elements of the cause of actions cannot be
established, or (2) a complete affirmative defense to the cause of action
exists. (Code Civ. Proc. § 437c, subds. (o), (p)(2).) The moving party may
demonstrate that an element of a cause of action cannot be established by
showing that the plaintiff does not possess, and cannot reasonably obtain,
needed evidence. (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co.¿(2001) 25 Cal.4th
826, 854.) 
Once the moving party meets its burden,
the burden shifts to the opposing party to show that a triable issue of material
fact exists as to that cause of action or a defense thereto. (Id. at p.
849.) The opposing party may not rely upon the mere allegations or denials of
the pleadings to show that a triable issue of material fact exists but,
instead, must “set forth the specific facts showing that a triable issue of
material fact exists as to that cause of action or a defense thereto.” (Ibid.;
Code Civ. Proc. § 437c, subd. (p)(2).) A triable issue of material fact exists
if the evidence would allow a reasonable trier of fact to find the underlying
fact in favor of the opposing party in accordance with the applicable standard
of proof. (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co., supra, 25 Cal.4th
at p. 850.)
In analyzing motions for summary judgment,
courts must apply a three-step analysis: “(1) identify the issues framed by the
pleadings; (2) determine whether the moving party has negated the opponent’s
claims; and (3) determine whether the opposition has demonstrated the existence
of a triable, material factual issue.” (Hinesley v. Oakshade Town Center (2005)
135 Cal.App.4th 289, 294.) “[T]he pleadings determine the scope of relevant
issues on a summary judgment motion.” (Nieto v. Blue Shield of California
Life & Health Ins. Co.¿(2010) 181 Cal.App.4th 60, 74.) The court
considers all the evidence and all of the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom
and must view such evidence in the light most favorable to the opposing party.
(Id. at 843; All of US or None - Riverside Chapter v. Hamrick¿(2021)
64 Cal.App.5th 751, 783.)
 Request for Judicial Notice
None.
Evidentiary Objections
None.
Application
to Facts
Plaintiff moves for summary judgment on
the sole cause of action for unlawful detainer. In support, Plaintiff attaches
the Declaration of Mark Jaime, Community Manager and agent for Plaintiff, the
Written Lease Agreement between Plaintiff and Defendant, the Three-Day Notice
of Default, and Notice of Bankruptcy Dismissal. (Jaime Decl., Exhs. 1,2, 3.)

Cause
of Action: Unlawful Detainer for Nonpayment of Rent
A tenant is guilty of lawful detainer for
nonpayment of rent when: “(1) the tenant is in possession of the premises; (2)
that possession is without permission; (3) the tenant is in default for
nonpayment of rent; (4) the tenant has been properly served with a written
three-day notice; and (5) the default continues after the three-day notice
period has elapsed.” (KB Salt Lake III, LLC v. Fitness Internat., LLC
(2023) 95 Cal.App.5th 1032, 1045; Code Civ. Proc. § 1161, subd. (2).) A section
1161 unlawful detainer action is “subject to the COVID-19 Tenant Relief Act of
2020 (Chapter 5 (commencing with Section 1179.01)) if the neglect or
failure to perform other conditions or covenants of the lease or agreement is
based upon the COVID-19 rental debt.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 1161, subd. (2).)
First, Plaintiff attests that it owns
the residential real property located at 1714 N. McCadden Place, #1417,
Hollywood, CA 90028 (the Premises). (Compl., at p. 1; Undisputed Material Facts
[UMFs] No. 1; Declaration of Mark Jaime [Jaime Decl.], ¶ 2.) Plaintiff attests
that Defendant occupies the Premises pursuant to a written rental agreement (the
Lease). (Compl., at p. 2; UMFs No. 2; Jaime Decl., ¶ 3, Exh. 1, at p. 1.) Under
the Lease, rent is due in the amount of $3,840.00 on the first of each month.
(Compl., at p. 2; UMGs No. 3; Jaime Decl., ¶ 4, Exh. 1, at p. 1.) Plaintiff
attests that Defendant did not pay monthly rent from April 1, 2022 - March 31,
2023. (UMFs No. 4; Jaime Decl., ¶ 5.)
Next, Plaintiff attests that it served
Defendant with the Three-Day Notice (the Notice) on March 21, 2023, demanding
past due rent for the period of April 1, 2022 to March 31, 2023. (Compl, at p.
3; UMFs No. 6; Jaime Decl., ¶ 7.) Plaintiff states that because it found no
person of suitable age and discretion at the Premises, Plaintiff mailed a copy
of the Notice in United States Mail in a sealed envelope with postage fully
prepaid and addressed to Defendant at the Premises and posted the Notice in a
conspicuous place on the Premises. (Compl., at p. 3; UMFs No. 5; Jaime Decl., ¶
6, Exh. 2, at p. 1.) Plaintiff does not know Defendant’s current place of
employment. (Compl., at p. 3; UMFs No. 5; Jaime Decl., ¶ 6, Exh. 2, at p. 1.) Plaintiff
attests that Defendant has not remedied the default or vacated the Premises as
of the filing of the instant motion. (UMFs Nos. 7, 12; Jaime Decl., ¶¶ 8, 12.)
Finally, Plaintiff states it has received no
rental or other financial compensation or assistance for the amount demanded in
the Notice or for rent which accrued after the Notice date. (UMFs Nos. 8-9;
Jaime Decl., ¶¶ 9-10.) Plaintiff also contends that it has no pending
applications for rental assistance or other financial compensation for the
amount demanded in the Notice or for rent which accrued after the Notice date.
(UMFs Nos. 10-11; Jaime Decl., ¶¶ 11-12.)
The court finds that Plaintiff has met its
initial burden demonstrating that no triable issue of material fact exists as
to Defendant’s unlawful detainer of the Premises. The burden now shifts to
Defendant to show a triable issue of material fact exists. 
Defendant did not file an opposition. (Code Civ. Proc. § 437c, subd. (b)(2)
[“Any opposition to the motion shall be served and filed not less than 14 days
preceding the noticed or continued date of hearing, unless the court for good
cause orders otherwise.”].)
Accordingly, the court finds that no
triable issue of material fact exists and that Plaintiff is entitled to
judgment as a matter of law.
 
Plaintiff has established all elements of unlawful
detainer
Defendant currently remains in possession
of the Premises, without Plaintiff’s permission. Defendant has not paid rent
since before April 1, 2022. Plaintiff served Defendant at the Premises by
posting the Notice conspicuously and mailing the Notice to Defendant at the
Premises. Finally, Defendant continues to default on rent payments. 
Accordingly, Defendant has met its burden
of establishing unlawful detainer for nonpayment of rent.
The court now address Defendant’s defenses
to Plaintiff’s cause of action.
 
Defendant’s
defenses fail because Defendant did not allege sufficient facts or provide
evidence to support its allegations. 
Defendant’s answer asserted several
defenses including retaliatory eviction and breach of the implied warranty of
habitability. (Answer, ¶¶ 3-17.)
 
1.     Eleventh
Affirmative Defense: Retaliatory Eviction
“[A] landlord may not engage in specified
conduct against a tenant who is not in default on rent, including ‘bring[ing]
an action to recover possession,’ because of a tenant’s lawful and peaceable
exercise of any rights under the law or because of a tenant’s complaints
regarding habitability. However, a landlord retains the right to bring an
action to recover possession ‘for any lawful cause.’ To recover possession for
a good faith, nonretaliatory reason, the landlord must give the tenant notice
of such grounds and, if controverted, the landlord must prove the truth of the
reason stated.” (Coyne v. De Leo (2018) 26 Cal.App.5th 801, 805, quoting
Code Civ. Proc. § 1942.5, subds. (a), (d), (f), (g).) The tenant has the burden
to prove a retaliatory motive by “a preponderance of the evidence.” (Western
Land Office, Inc. v. Cervantes (1985) 175 Cal.App.3d 724, 744.)
Defendant’s answer asserts that Plaintiff
filed this action because Defendant exercised tenant rights such as engaging in
tenant organizing activities. (Answer, ¶ 13.) Defendant provides no further
factual allegations or evidence specifying what these activities were. Plaintiff
argues it brought this action to seek past-due rent payments, not to retaliate
against Defendant. (Motion for Summary Judgment, pg. 9:1-4.)
The court finds that Defendant has not
supported its retaliatory eviction defense because Defendant fails to allege
sufficient factual allegations and because Defendant is currently in default.
Accordingly, Defendant’s retaliatory
eviction defense fails.
 
2.     First
and Twelfth Affirmative Defenses: Breach of Implied Warranty of Habitability
A breach of the implied warranty of
habitability “may be raised as a defense in an unlawful detainer action.” (Green
v. Superior Court (1974) 10 Cal.3d 616, 619.) ¿“The elements of a cause of
action for breach of the implied warranty of habitability ‘are the existence of
a material defective condition affecting the premises’ habitability, notice to
the landlord of the condition within a reasonable time after the tenant’s
discovery of the condition, [and that] the landlord was given a reasonable time
to correct the deficiency, and resulting damages.’” (Peviani v. Arbors at
California Oaks Property Owner, LLC (2021) 62 Cal.App.5th 874, 891, quoting
Erlach v. Sierra Asset Servicing, LLC (2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 1281,
1297.)
Defendant contends that Plaintiff breached
the implied warranty of habitability, alleging: “mold contamination in the
master bedroom, a persistent cockroach infestation, a malfunctioning water
heater, soiled or contaminated plumbing connected to the kitchen sink, a
defective air conditioning unit, and an inoperable dish washing machine.”
(Answer, ¶ 3.) Plaintiff asserts that Defendant has not met “notice” burden
because Plaintiff did not allege facts stating Defendant notified Plaintiff of
need for repairs before withholding rent. (Motion for Summary Judgment, pg. 10:12-17.)

The court finds that Defendant has failed
to establish the notice requirement by not alleging sufficient factual allegations
or evidence to counter Plaintiff’s claims. Because Defendant cannot establish
the notice element, the court does not go into an in-depth analysis of the
other elements.
Accordingly, Defendant’s implied warranty
of habitability defense fails.
 
The court concludes that because Defendant
fails to show a triable issue of material fact with respect to Plaintiff’s
cause of action, summary judgment is granted.
            
CONCLUSION
            Plaintiff’s motion for summary
judgment is GRANTED.
            Plaintiff to give notice.
