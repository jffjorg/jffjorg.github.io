And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Defendant Haresh Jogani's motion to reconsider the court's order granting Plaintiffs' ex parte application for a continuance. The court found that Defendant Jogani's claims of being an Apex Deponent under the Apex Doctrine do not apply in this case, as the deposition is limited to questions relating to jurisdiction. The court also found that Defendant Jogani's failure to respond to Plaintiffs' discovery requests and his attempts to mischaracterize the scope of the deposition are not sufficient grounds for reconsideration. The ruling is subject to change after consideration of any written opposition or reply.
