[1] Note that Plaintiffs’ ex parte
application explicitly states they are seeking the following information:
 . . . whether [Defendant
Jogani] alleges he has divested himself of any interests which he once held,
whether Mr. Jogani denies being the owner of the Subject Property at issue in
this litigation, who the purported owners are if not Mr. Jogani, as well as Mr.
Jogani’s business dealings in Los Angeles County over the last several years.
The inquiry will further evaluate whether Mr. Jogani has availed himself of
courts in California, including by seeking evictions against his tenants and
otherwise using the Court system to sue others relating to what Plaintiffs
believe is his massive business empire within Los Angeles County. 
(Plaintiffs’ Ex Parte Application at p.
5.) 


[2] Plaintiffs present three forms of
evidence which suggest Defendant Jogani has contacts with Los Angeles County
including a Jury Verdict Form (Jogani v. Jogani); a Los Angeles County
Superior Court order on a motion of apportionment (Jogani v. Jogani); and
Secretary of State records filed in April 2024 naming Defendant Jogani as the
sole director of J.K. Properties, Inc. (See Declaration of Ved Dashputre, ¶¶
3-5, Exhs. B, C, D.)
