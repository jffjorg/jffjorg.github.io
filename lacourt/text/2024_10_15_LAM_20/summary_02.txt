And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge rules in favor of the Plaintiff, Madison-MF McCadden CA LLC, and grants their motion for summary judgment. The Plaintiff sued the Defendant, Victor Vicente, for unlawful detainer, claiming that the Defendant failed to pay rent from April 1, 2022 to March 31, 2023. The Defendant filed an answer with affirmative defenses, including retaliatory eviction and breach of the implied warranty of habitability. The Plaintiff filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that the Defendant failed to meet its burden of showing a triable issue of material fact.

The Judge finds that the Plaintiff has met its initial burden and that the Defendant did not file an opposition to the motion. The Judge concludes that the Defendant's defenses fail because the Defendant did not allege sufficient factual allegations or evidence to support its claims. As a result, the court grants the Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment and orders the Defendant to vacate the premises.
