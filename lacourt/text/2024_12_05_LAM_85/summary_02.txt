As for the English text summary:

This tentative ruling addresses a request by the County for judicial notice of certain records related to a case involving Galvez and the County of Los Angeles. The records in question include a request for hearing, a special notice, and a decision by a hearing officer. The court agrees to take judicial notice of the County's Civil Service Rules and the hearing officer's decision, but denies judicial notice of Exhibits B and C, which are part of the Commission's file but not yet part of an administrative record. The court also distinguishes a previous case, Zazueta v. County of San Benito, on the grounds that Galvez did not submit to binding arbitration and the Commission has not issued a final decision in the County's favor on the statute of limitation issue.
