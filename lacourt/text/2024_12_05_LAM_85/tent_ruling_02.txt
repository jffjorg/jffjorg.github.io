[2] The
County requests that the court takes judicial notice of County of Los Angeles
Civil Service Rules (“CSR”) 4.13 and 4.14, and the following records from County
of Los Angeles Civil Service Commission (“Commission”) Case Number 22-66: (a) Galvez’s
request for hearing dated February 4, 2022 (Ex. A), (b) the Commission’s
special notice dated October 11, 2023 (Ex. B), and (c) the hearing officer’s
decision dated March 18, 2024 (Ex. C).  The CSRs are judicially noticed.  Evid. Code 452(b).  The Commission hearing officer’s decision is
judicially noticed (Evid. Code §452(c)) but Exhibits B and C, while part of the
Commission’s file, are not yet part of an administrative record and judicial
notice is denied.


[3] In Zazueta v. the
County of San Benito, (1995) 38 Cal.App.4th 106, 113. The petitioner peace
officer submitted his termination for sexual harassment to binding arbitration
and the arbitrator’s decision upheld his termination.  Id. at 109.  He filed a petition for mandamus, invoking
both CCP section 1094.5 and POBRA’s initial jurisdiction.  Id. at 109-10.  The appellate court held that he waived any
issue not presented to the arbitrator for purposes of CCP section 1094.5 and
waived his POBRA rights by participating in the arbitrator.  The court noted: “While represented by
counsel, petitioner specifically requested binding arbitration and never sought
judicial review under Government Code section 3309.5 until after the arbitrator
ruled in favor of respondent.”  Id.
at 113.
Galvez distinguishes Zazueta on the grounds that he
did not submit to binding arbitration and the Commission has not issued a final
decision in the County’s favor on the statute of limitation issue.  Opp. at 9. 
The court agrees. Zazueta expressly distinguished Mounger
by differing an arbitration from an administrative appeal.  Id. at 113.
