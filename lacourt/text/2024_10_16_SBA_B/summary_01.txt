And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the motion to strike portions of the answer, specifically the affirmative defenses at paragraphs 6-24, affirmative relief, and the exhibits. The Judge finds that the answer is deficient in failing to separately state the defenses and that several paragraphs are irrelevant or improper. The Judge also grants the motion to compel defendant Elliott Weathersby to respond without objections to plaintiff Susan Spell's form interrogatories and request for production, and deems admitted the truth of the matters specified in plaintiff's request for admissions.

The Judge orders defendant Elliott Weathersby to respond to plaintiff's form interrogatories, Set One, within twenty days, and to produce all documents and things in his possession, custody, or control, which are responsive to plaintiff's request, within twenty days. The Judge also orders the truth of the matters deemed admitted in plaintiff's request for admissions against defendant Elliott Weathersby.

The Judge declines to award plaintiff $1000 in monetary sanctions against defendant, as the plaintiff is seeking attorney fees for services rendered by an attorney who advised her on the discovery motion. The Judge finds that the case cited by the plaintiff, Mix v. Tumanjan Development Corp. (2002) 102 Cal. App. 4th 1318, is inapplicable and that the plaintiff is not entitled to attorney fees.

The Judge's tentative ruling is subject to change based on any opposition or further submissions from the parties.
