[Tentative]
  Order RE:
 
plaintiff’s motion to deem the truth of all
  matters specified in requests for admission, set one, admitted
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                 Plaintiff Kimberly Lucero      
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Defendant General Motors LLC
Motion to Deem Truth of All Matters Specified in Requests for Admission
Admitted
The court
considered the moving papers, opposition papers, and reply declaration filed in
connection with this motion. 
DISCUSSION
Plaintiff Kimberly Lucero (“Plaintiff”) moves the court for an order
(1) deeming admitted the truth of all matters specified in Plaintiff’s Requests
for Admission, Set One, served on defendant General Motors LLC (“Defendant”),
and (2) awarding monetary sanctions in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant
in the amount of $2,004.15.
If
a party to whom requests for admission are directed fails to serve a timely
response, the court shall, upon motion by the propounding party, order that the
matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted unless the court finds
that the party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has served
substantially compliant responses before the hearing on the motion.¿ (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.280, subds. (b), (c).)¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
Plaintiff
served Defendant with the Requests for Admissions, Set One, on March 8, 2023,
by mail.  (Yashar Decl., Ex. 1.)  Defendant did not serve timely responses to
this discovery and had not served responses as of the date that Plaintiff filed
this motion (June 23, 2023).  (Yashar
Decl., ¶¶ 3-5.)  In opposition,
Defendant has submitted evidence establishing that it served, on August 9,
2023, responses to this discovery. 
(Valencia Decl., Ex. B.)  The
court finds that Defendant’s proposed responses are “in substantial compliance
with Section 2033.220” and therefore is required to deny Plaintiff’s motion.[1] 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).) 
The court
grants Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)  The court finds that $1,791.65 ((4 hours $425
hourly rate) + $91.65 filing fees) is a reasonable amount of sanctions to
impose against Defendant in connection with this motion.  (Yashar Decl., ¶¶ 8-9.) 
ORDER
            The court denies plaintiff Kimberly
Lucero’s motion to deem truth of all matters specified in requests for
admissions, set one, admitted. 
            The court grants plaintiff Kimberly
Lucero’s request for monetary sanctions. 
            The court orders defendant General
Motors LLC to pay sanctions to plaintiff Kimberly Lucero in the amount of
$1,791.65 within 30 days of the date of this order. 
The court orders plaintiff Kimberly Lucero to give notice of this
ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
DATED:  March 20, 2024
