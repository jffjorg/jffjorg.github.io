2019, the Court entered Judgment in favor of Bow Tie, and against Plaintiff. 
 
II.       Post-Judgment
Procedural History
 
        Since
the entry of the Judgments, this case has had a long procedural history. Of
relevance to this motion is the following: 
 
On October 30, 2019,
the Court awarded $143,137.60 in attorney’s fees in favor of Bow Tie and
against Plaintiff. This award was for the fees incurred pre-Judgments. The
motion for attorney’s fees was unopposed. 
 
        On
November 15, 2019, Plaintiff appealed the Judgments. 
 
        On
June 29, 2020, the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal and ordered Respondents
to recover costs on appeal. Other appeals in the subsequent months were also
dismissed, with Respondents to recover costs on appeal. 
 
        On

designated case BC697147 as the lead case. 
 
On April 7, 2021, the
Court awarded $51,577.50 in attorney’s fees in favor of Bow Tie and against
Plaintiff. On April 15, 2021, the Court entered Judgment as such. The motion
for attorney’s fees was unopposed. 
 
On December 14, 2021,
the Court of Appeal considered an appeal (Appeal No. B303369, or “Lee I”)
and dismissed it. The Court of Appeal affirmed that dismissal when it was
appealed again (Appeal No. B308739, or “Lee II”). 
 
On May 24, 2022,
regarding Lee II, the Court awarded: (1) $24,570.65 in attorney’s

2023 but kept the original briefing schedule.

2023, Plaintiff filed her Objection Constitutional to Award of Attorney Fees
(“Opposition”). In support of her Opposition, Plaintiff concurrently filed: (1)
Declaration; (2) Exhibit List; (3) Request for Judicial Notice; and (4) Proof
of Service. 
 
ANALYSIS:
 
I.         
Preliminary
Issue
 
The original hearing date for United’s Motion re Lee V and Bow
Tie’s Motion re Lee V was September 28, 2023. Because the Court’s
continuance kept the original briefing schedule, Plaintiff’s Opposition was due
on September 20, 2023 (which was five court days prior to September 28, 2023,
taking into account the holiday observed on September 22, 2023). As Plaintiff’s
Opposition was submitted on September 25, 2023, it was late. However, the Court
still considers the late-filed Opposition. 
 
II.      
Requests
for Judicial Notice
 
A.      United and Bow Tie’s Requests for Judicial
Notice
 
United and Bow Tie both request that the Court take judicial notice of:
 
(1)      
The
Court of Appeal Docket in Appeal No. B322423; and
 
(2)      
The
Remittitur in Appeal No. B322423.
 
The Court GRANTS judicial notice of these items. 
 
 
B.      Plaintiff’s Request for Judicial Notice
 
Plaintiff requests that the Court take
judicial notice of: 
 
(1)      
Nine
filings from an unrelated case (Case No. 21STCV35370); and
 
(2)      
The
Complaint from the related case (Case No. 20STCV14403).
 
The
Court DENIES as irrelevant judicial notice to each of these items. “Although a court may judicially notice a
variety of matters (Evid. Code, § 450 et seq.), only relevant material
may be noticed.” (Am. Cemwood Corp. v. Am. Home Assurance Co. (2001) 87
Cal.App.4th 431, 441, fn. 7, quotation omitted, italics in original.)
 
III.    
Legal
Standard
 
“Except as otherwise expressly provided by statute, a
prevailing party is entitled as a matter of right to recover costs in any
action or proceeding.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1032, subd. (b).)
 
“‘Prevailing party’ includes the party with a net monetary
recovery, a defendant in whose favor a dismissal is entered, a defendant where
neither plaintiff nor defendant obtains any relief, and a defendant as against
those plaintiffs who do not recover any relief against that defendant. If any
party recovers other than monetary relief and in situations other than as
specified, the ‘prevailing party’ shall be as determined by the court, and
under those circumstances, the court, in its discretion, may allow costs or not
and, if allowed, may apportion costs between the parties on the same or adverse
sides pursuant to rules adopted under Section 1034.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1032,
subd. (a)(4).)
 
Attorneys’ fees are allowed as costs when authorized by
contract, statute, or law. (Code Civ. Proc, § 1033.5, subd. (a)(10)(B).)
 
IV.     
Discussion
 
A. 
    The Parties’ Arguments
 
United and Bow Tie separately move
the Court to award $10,668.75 in attorney’s fees and costs for Appeal No.
B322423. (United’s Motion
re Lee V, p. 6:5–6; Bow Tie’s Motion re Lee V, p. 6:5–6.)
 
United and Bow Tie argue: (1) that
the motions are timely; (2) that they are entitled to their attorney’s fees on
appeal; (3) that the amount of fees requested is appropriate; (4) that the
hourly rate is reasonable; and (5) that the number of hours is reasonable. (United’s Motion re Lee V, p. 2:25,
3:5, 4:1, 5:18, 5:24; Bow Tie’s Motion re Lee V, p. 2:25, 3:5, 4:1,
5:18, 5:24.)
 
Plaintiff opposes the motions,
arguing: (1) that Plaintiff was stripped of her right to a jury trial; (2) that
Plaintiff did not involuntarily waive her right to a jury trial; (3) that
Plaintiff’s constant facing threat of forfeiture and seizure is evidence of her
lack of waiver of writ remedy; and (4) that this Court has jurisdiction to
vacate the two Judgments dated September 16, 2019 and restore Plaintiff to the
status quo ante. (Opposition, pp. 4:17–18, 5:18–19, 6:16–17, 7:10–11.)
 
B. 
    Waiver of the Right to a Jury
 
“Trial by jury is an inviolate right and shall be secured to
all, but in a civil cause three-fourths of the jury may render a verdict. A
jury may be waived in a criminal cause by the consent of both parties expressed
in open court by the defendant and the defendant’s counsel. In a civil cause a
jury may be waived by the consent of the parties expressed as prescribed by
statute. . . .” (Cal. Const., art. I, § 16.)
 
“The right to a
trial by jury as declared by Section 16 of Article I of the California
Constitution shall be preserved to the parties inviolate. In civil cases, a
jury may only be waived pursuant to subdivision (f).” (Code Civ. Proc., § 631,
subd. (a).)
 
“At least one
party demanding a jury on each side of a civil case shall pay a nonrefundable
fee of one hundred fifty dollars ($150), unless the fee has been paid by
another party on the same side of the case. . . .” (Code Civ. Proc., § 631,
subd. (b).)
 
“The fee described in subdivision (b)
shall be due on or before the date scheduled for the initial case management
conference in the action, except as follows . . . .” (Code Civ. Proc., § 631,
subd. (c), specific exceptions omitted.)
 
“A party waives trial by jury in any of
the following ways: . . .  (5) By failing
to timely pay the fee described in subdivision (b), unless another party on the
same side of the case has paid that fee.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 631, subd. (f)(5).)
 
“The court may, in its
discretion upon just terms, allow a trial by jury although there may have been
a waiver of a trial by jury.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 631, subd. (g).)
 
Code of Civil Procedure
section 631 “holds inviolate the right to trial by jury, and prescribes that a
jury may be waived in civil cases only as
provided in subdivision (d) [now subdivision (f), as of the 2012 amendments to
the statute] of its provisions.” (Grafton Partners v. Super. Ct. (2005)
36 Cal.4th 944, 951, emphasis in original.)
 
“Where the right to jury is threatened, the
crucial focus is whether any prejudice will be suffered by any party or the
court if a motion for relief from waiver is granted. A trial court abuses its
discretion as a matter of law when relief has been denied where there has been
no prejudice to the other party or to the court from an inadvertent waiver.” (Wharton
v. Super. Ct. (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 100, 104, cleaned up.)
 
“Failure to prepare
trial documents in accordance with local rules does not fall within any of the
means of waiver specified in section 631.” (Amato
v. Downs (2022) 78 Cal.App.5th 435, 445, citations omitted.) It is in
excess of the court’s jurisdiction and reversible error per se for a trial
court to rule that the right to a jury was waived by a failure to prepare trial
documents in accordance with local rules. (Ibid.)
 
“When the state
Constitution or an applicable statute affords a party a right to a jury trial
in a civil action, a trial court has no power or authority to deny a request
for a jury, and therefore, under Abelleira, a
trial court's denial of a request for jury trial may be reviewed prior to trial
by a petition for an extraordinary writ.” (Shaw v. Super. Ct. (2017) 2
Cal.5th 983, 991, citing Abelleira v. Dist. Ct. of App. (1941) 17 Cal.2d
280.)
 
“A party must preserve his record. Thus, it is
well established that a party cannot without objection try his case before a
court without a jury, lose it and then complain that it was not tried by jury. As stated in the recent Tyler case, wherein defendants proceeded to try
the case before a judge without objecting to the absence of a jury, ‘Defendants
cannot play 'Heads I win. Tails you lose' with the trial court.’” (Taylor v.
Union P. R. Corp. (1976) 16 Cal.3d 893, 900, quoting Tyler v. Norton (1973)
34 Cal.App.3d 717, 722, and cleaned up elsewhere; accord Mackovska v.
Viewcrest Rd. Props. LLC (2019) 40 Cal.App.5th 1, 15 [“The Supreme Court
has made clear that such improper gamesmanship arises when a party loses a case
after proceeding with a court trial without
objecting to the absence of a jury and then complains the
case was erroneously tried to the court.”], emphasis in original.)
 
C.      The Relevant Procedural History
 
On March 7, 2018, Plaintiff filed
her Complaint in this matter.
 
On July 17, 2018, the initial Case
Management Conference was held in this matter. 
 
On August 27, 2018, the Court noted
that Plaintiff “has not posted jury fees and failure to timely post jury fees
is a waiver of jury. Jury fees shall be posted prior to the next hearing or the
Court will find that jury has been waived by plaintiff.” (Minute Order dated
August 27, 2018, p. 4.) 
 
On December 6, 2018, the Court noted
again that Plaintiff “has not posted jury fees and failure to timely post jury
fees is a waiver of jury. Jury fees shall be posted forthwith or the Court will
find that jury has been waived.” (Minute Order dated December 6, 2018, p. 1.) 
 
On December 7, 2018, Plaintiff filed
her Notice of Posting Advance Jury Fees. 
 
On August 16, 2019, the Court noted
while Plaintiff posted jury fees, she “did not file the required jury trial documents.
Absent a valid explanation, the Court finds that plaintiff has waived jury.”
(Minute Order dated August 16, 2019, pp. 1–2.) 
 
A non-jury trial was then held in
this matter from August 27 to 29, 2019. 
 
No motion for a new trial or other post-judgment
motions were filed on the issue of jury waiver. More than four years after the
non-jury trial in this matter, this appears to be the first time Plaintiff has
brought up the issue of jury waiver in any post-judgment motion — much less in
any of the half dozen appeals filed in this matter. (Further, it is not clear
to the Court that Plaintiff is even entitled to raise this issue in her
Opposition, given that the issue at hand is attorney’s fees, not vacatur of the
judgment.)
 
D. 
    The Substantive
Issue with Plaintiff’s Arguments
 
Pursuant to the Constitution, the
Legislature has statutorily allowed waiver of the right to a jury in only a
limited number of ways, one of which is failure to timely pay the
statutorily-required jury fee. (Cal. Const., art. I, § 16; Code Civ. Proc., §
631, subds. (a), (b), (c), (f)(5).) As none of the statutorily-listed
exceptions to the normal due date for jury fees applies here, the jury fees in
this matter were due “on or before the date scheduled for the initial case
management conference in the action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 631, subd. (c).) More
specifically, the jury fees were due by July 17, 2018, which was the date of
the initial Case Management Conference in this matter. As Plaintiff did not
post the jury fees until December 7, 2018, Plaintiff waived trial by jury. 
 
The Court, then sitting in
Department 30, had “discretion upon just terms” to “allow a trial by jury
although there may have been a waiver of a trial by jury.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
631, subd. (g).) Based on the relevant minute orders, it appears the Court may
not have fully considered prior to trial the issue of jury waiver, nor did it
have the benefit of the recent ruling in Amato, supra, 78
Cal.App.5th at p. 445. Regardless of how the Court understood this issue before
trial, Plaintiff did not move the Court to exercise its discretion under Code
of Civil Procedure section 631, subdivision (g), and the Court did not sua
sponte exercise its discretion under that same subdivision to allow a jury
trial. The Court is not aware of any case law that indicates a trial court
declining to sua sponte allow a jury trial under subdivision (g) is an
abuse of discretion. It was Plaintiff’s responsibility to move for relief, and
she did not do so. 
 
        (The Court is aware of a
recent case that holds “a party who did not seek writ review of an order denying
relief from jury waiver under section 631 must demonstrate actual prejudice
when challenging the order on appeal. Requiring such a showing does not deprive
the appellant of the constitutional right to a jury trial and is consistent
with the public policies of conserving judicial resources and promoting
judicial economy by avoiding repetitive litigation—relevant factors in the
exercise of a court's discretion under section 631, subdivision (g).” (TriCoast
Builders, Inc. v. Fonnegra (2022) 74 Cal.App.5th 239, 247–248, citations
omitted, review pending at TriCoast Builders, Inc. v. Fonnegra (Cal.,
Apr. 27, 2022) 293 Cal. Rptr. 3d 93.) That case is currently pending
review before the California Supreme Court. The Court’s argument would stand even
if TriCoast Builders, Inc. is disapproved because Plaintiff never moved
the Court for relief prior to trial pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section
631, subdivision (g).)
 
 
E. 
    The Procedural Issue with Plaintiff’s
Arguments
 
Even if Plaintiff should have
received a jury trial under Code of Civil Procedure section 631, subdivision
(g), this relief is now procedurally foreclosed. 
 
Plaintiff was allowed to file a
pre-trial motion for relief from waiver of jury trial. (See Wharton, supra,
231 Cal.App.3d at p. 104; see also Massie v. AAR Western Skyways, Inc. (1992)
4 Cal.App.4th 405, 412.) 
 
Plaintiff was also allowed to file a
pre-trial petition for an extraordinary writ if she believed that the Court had
improperly denied her request for a jury trial. (See Shaw, supra,
2 Cal.5th at p. 991.) 
 
Plaintiff was even allowed to file
post-judgment motions, such as a motion for new trial. (See Code Civ. Proc., §
657.) 
 
But Plaintiff failed to take any of
these actions. 
 
Plaintiff has not presented the
Court with any evidence that she preserved her record on this issue, despite it
being “well established that a party cannot without objection try his case before a
court without a jury, lose it and then complain that it was not tried by jury.”
(Taylor, supra, 16 Cal.3d at p. 900.)
 
Thus, aside from Plaintiff’s
arguments being completely irrelevant to the issue at hand (which is whether
there are any issues with the attorney’s fees and costs requested by United and
Bow Tie for winning the appeal in Lee V), Plaintiff’s arguments are both
substantively incorrect and procedurally unavailing.  
 
F.       Defendants’
Arguments
 
The Court agrees with United and Bow
Tie that their motions are timely, that they are entitled to their attorney’s
fees on appeal, that their costs claimed ($570.65, each) are reasonable, and
that the hourly rate of $750.00 is reasonable. 
 
However, given that many of the past
filings in this matter have, mutatis mutandis, been identical — whether
they be motions for attorney’s fees, filings on appeal, and so on — it is now
unreasonable for United’s and Bow Tie’s Counsel to claim that 56.9 hours (28.45
each for United and Bow Tie) were spent on this matter. (Although not critical
to this analysis, the Court notes that the invoices attached to the motions
only list 21.20 hours spent.) These motions are essentially identical to the
motions filed on May 18, 2023 and July 19, 2023. (The only changes were a
single bolded paragraph added on page 2, which argues that the amount requested
is very reasonable. Yet Defense Counsel requests 4.80 hours of work for each of
the motions; this is, in and of itself, unreasonable.) A reasonable attorney
would not have spent more than five hours of work on these motions. 
 
The Court will award attorney’s fees
and costs in the total amount of $4,891.30. This accounts for five hours of
work at $750.00 per hour, plus the combined costs of $1,141.30.  
 
V.        
Conclusion
 
United’s Motion re Lee V is GRANTED. Attorney’s fees and costs
are awarded in favor of United and against Plaintiff in the total amount of
$2,445.65. 
 
Bow Tie’s Motion re Lee V is GRANTED. Attorney’s fees and costs
are awarded in favor of United and against Plaintiff in the total amount of $2,445.65.
