And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the plaintiffs' unopposed motion for terminating sanctions, strikes the defendant's answer, and enters default against the defendant. The judge declines to award additional monetary sanctions, but orders that a default judgment be entered on a future date. The judge's decision is based on the defendant's failure to respond to discovery requests, disobey court orders, and lack of participation in the litigation. The judge cites relevant case law and statutes in support of the decision.
