ANALYSIS:
 
I.         
Legal
Standard
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.030 gives
the court the discretion to impose sanctions against anyone engaging in a
misuse of the discovery process. A court may impose terminating sanctions by
striking pleadings of the party engaged in misuse of discovery or entering
default judgment. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (d).) A violation of a
discovery order is sufficient for the imposition of terminating sanctions. (Collison
& Kaplan v. Hartunian (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 1611, 1620.) Terminating
sanctions are appropriate when a party persists in disobeying the court's
orders. (Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 771, 795–96.)
 
A terminating sanction is a "drastic
measure which should be employed with caution." (Id. at p. 793.)
"A decision to order terminating sanctions should not be made lightly. But
where a violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence
shows that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the
discovery rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate
sanction." (Mileikowsky v. Tenet Healthsystem (2005) 128
Ca1.App.4th 262, 279–80.)
 
While the court has discretion to impose terminating
sanctions, these sanctions "should be appropriate to the dereliction and
should not exceed that which is required to protect the interests of the party
entitled to but denied discovery." (Deyo, supra, 84
Cal.App.3d at p. 793.) "[A] court is empowered to apply the ultimate
sanction against a litigant who persists in the outright refusal to comply with
his discovery obligations." (Id.) Discovery sanctions are not to be
imposed for punishment, but instead are used to encourage fair disclosure of discovery
to prevent unfairness resulting for the lack of information. (See Midwife v.
Bernal (1988) 203 Cal.App.3d 57, 64 [superseded on other grounds as stated
in Kohan v. Cohan (1991) 229 Cal.App.3d 967, 971.)
 
"A trial court has broad discretion to
impose discovery sanctions, but two facts are generally prerequisite to the
imposition of nonmonetary sanctions . . . (1) absent unusual circumstances,
there must be a failure to comply with a court order, and (2) the failure must
be willful." (Biles v. Exxon Mobil Corp. (2004) 124 Cal.App.4th
1315, 1327; but see Reedy v. Bussell (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 1272, 1291
["willfulness is no longer a requirement for the imposition of discovery
sanctions."].)
 
II.       Discussion 
 
Plaintiffs move the Court to issue terminating sanctions against
Defendant by striking Defendant’s answer and entering default against
Defendant. (Motion, p. 5:19–21.) Plaintiffs further request $1,300.00 in
monetary sanctions. (Ibid.) Plaintiff argues that these requests for
relief are appropriate because Defendant has not responded to the discovery
requests, Defendant has disobeyed the Court’s order regarding discovery, and
Plaintiffs’ Counsel has spent two hours at $650.00 per hour on this Motion. (Id.,
Decl. Diaz, ¶¶ 6–7.)
 
Defendant did not oppose the motions to compel, nor has Defendant
opposed this Motion, which if granted, would terminate the case. The Court has
no evidence before it that indicates Defendant complied with the Court’s order
or that any sanction would result in Defendant serving responses to Plaintiffs’
discovery requests. 
 
The Court is also aware that:
 
·       Defendant had default entered against it for
failing to file an answer (although that default was later vacated);
·       Defense counsel has never yet appeared at any
hearing before this Court;
·       The Court has previously imposed monetary
sanctions on Defense counsel;
·       Defendant did not oppose the previous motion
to compel it to respond to discovery 
·       Defendant has not opposed this motion for
terminating sanctions.
 
Lastly, the Court posted its original tentative granting the request
for terminating sanctions on September 21, 2023.  As of October 19, 2023, defendant has still
not filed an opposition to this motion.
 
In short, Defendant has not participated in this litigation.  
 
 
III.    
Conclusion
 
The Motion is
GRANTED.  Defendant’s Answer is
STRICKEN. Default is ENTERED against Defendant. 
 
        The Court declines to award monetary sanctions
in addition to the terminating sanctions that are being imposed. 
 
The Court sets an OSC re Entry of Default Judgement
for December ___, 2023.
