And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying American Honda Motor Co., Inc.'s (Honda) motion to compel arbitration in the case of Elena Rubio vs. American Honda Motor Co., Inc. The case involves allegations of defects and nonconformities in a 2018 Honda Accord, which Rubio claims were not repaired despite multiple attempts. Honda sought to compel arbitration, but failed to present admissible evidence of a written agreement to arbitrate. The Judge notes that the burden of proof lies with Honda to establish the existence of an arbitration agreement, and since they failed to do so, the motion must be denied. The Judge also observes that the document presented by Honda is not relevant to the case because it is a Retail Installment Sales Contract between a different party and a different vehicle.
