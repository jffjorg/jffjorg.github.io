Case No.:  23AHCV00796
 
 
[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER DENYING DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR AN ORDER COMPELLING ARBITRATION
 
 
Date:   September
  25, 2023
Time:  8:30 a.m.
Dept.:  P



 
          
 
I.        INTRODUCTION
          In this action, Plaintiff Elena Rubio (Rubio) alleges
claims under the Song-Beverly Act against Defendant American Honda Motor Co.,
Inc. (Honda). Rubio alleges she purchased a 2018 Honda Accord in 2018, and that
Honda issued certain written warranties as to the vehicle. Rubio alleges the
vehicle was delivered with defects and nonconformities to warranty, including
with the suspension, electrical, and structural systems. 
          Rubio alleges she took the vehicle to an authorized repair
facility but that Honda was unable to conform the vehicle to warranty after a
reasonable number of repair attempts. Before the Court is Honda’s motion to
compel arbitration. 
Honda
has not presented admissible evidence of a written agreement between the
parties containing an arbitration provision. 
Accordingly, the motion is denied. 
 
II.       LEGAL
STANDARD
Code
Civ. Proc. §1281 provides: “A written agreement to submit to arbitration an
existing controversy or a controversy thereafter existing is valid,
enforceable, and irrevocable, save upon such grounds as exist for the
revocation of any contract.”
Code
Civ. Proc. §1281.2 provides that upon petition of a party to an arbitration
agreement alleging the existence of a written agreement to arbitrate and a
party’s refusal to submit to arbitration, the court shall order the parties to
arbitrate the controversy if it determines that an agreement exists, unless it
determines that the right to arbitrate has been waived, that grounds exist for
revocation, or that a party to the agreement is also party to a pending
litigation arising out of the same facts and there exists a possibility of
conflicting rulings on a common issue of fact or law.  
 
III.     ANALYSIS
          A. There Is No Admissible Evidence of Written Agreement
to Arbitrate
          When a petition to compel arbitration
is “filed and accompanied by prima facie evidence of a written agreement to
arbitrate the controversy, the court itself determines whether the agreement
exists and, if any defense to its enforcement is raised, whether it is
enforceable.” Rosenthal v. Great Western Fin. Securities Corp. (1996) 14 Cal.4th 394,
413. “[T]he facts are to be proven by affidavit or declaration and documentary
evidence, with oral testimony taken only in the court’s discretion.” Id. at 413-414.
          A party seeking to compel arbitration has the burden of
establishing the existence of a written agreement to arbitrate. Gamboa v.
Northeast Community Clinic (2021) 75 Cal.App.5th 158, 164 [“The burden of
persuasion is always on the moving party to prove the existence of an
arbitration agreement with the opposing party by a preponderance of the
evidence”].
          In support of its motion, Honda offers the declaration of
one of its attorneys, Ali Ameripour. Attached to the Ameripour Declaration as
Exhibit 2 is a copy of what Ameripour states is Rubio’s Retail Installment
Sales Contract. Rubio’s objection that Ameripour lacks personal knowledge to
authenticate the attached Retail Installment Sales Contract is sustained. The
Ameripour Declaration does not contain facts demonstrating personal knowledge
of this document. The writing is therefore not admissible. 
          B. The Agreement Does Not Require Rubio to Arbitrate
with Honda 
          As Honda has not presented admissible evidence of a written
arbitration agreement, the motion must be denied. No further analysis is
required. Nevertheless, the Court has examined the document, and makes the
following observations: 
          Exhibit 2 to the Ameripour Declaration is a Retail
Installment Sales Contract between Mykaylar Macias and Hyundai of Roseville. Neither
are parties to this litigation, and the vehicle referenced is not the one at
issue in this litigation. Thus, even if Exhibit 2 were admissible, it would
not provide a basis for an order compelling arbitration between the parties in
this case. 
          
IV.     ORDER
          Honda’s motion to compel arbitration is denied.  Plaintiff is ordered to give notice.
