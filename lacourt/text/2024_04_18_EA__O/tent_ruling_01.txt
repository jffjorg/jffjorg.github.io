  Case Number:  22PSCV00917    Hearing Date:   April 18, 2024    Dept:  O Tentative Ruling
 
Plaintiff’s
Counsel Waverly Phou, Esq.’s Motion to be Relieved as Counsel is GRANTED,
effective upon [see below]. 
 
Background
 
This is a
contracts case. Plaintiff Shenzhen E-Fly Logistics Co., Ltd alleges the
following against Defendants Los Angeles WorldCPS Inc., a California
Corporation, and LLP Global Inc., a California Corporation: In May 2021, the
parties entered into an agreement wherein Plaintiff contracted with Defendants to relabel and store
Plaintiff’s cargo goods returned from the Amazon Distribution Center. Instead,
Defendants sold the goods to a third part, causing damages in excess of
$600,000.
 
On August 24,
2022, Plaintiff filed suit.
 
On December
30, 2022, Plaintiff filed its first amended complaint (FAC) for: 
 
1.     Breach of Contract
2.     Fraud 
3.     General Negligence
4.     Conversion
 
On January
31, 2023, Defendants filed a General Denial.
 
On February
26, 2024, the court held an IDC indicating the following: “By the end of
this week (March 1, 2024), Plaintiff shall review what has been provided and
reach out to Defendant LLP Global as to what the relationships of the two
corporate defendants may or may not be, and if there is a way of getting
Plaintiff the answers she may be looking for. By no later than March 22, 2024,
parties shall give each other the information requested, and meet and confer to
decide as to whether or not further Informal Discovery Conference (IDC) is
needed.”
 
On April 2, 2024, Plaintiff’s Counsel filed the instant
motion.[1] 
 
Discussion
 
Plaintiff’s Counsel seeks to be relieved as counsel because
“Client is non-responsive and has not paid attorney fees for months.” (MC-052
form.) 
 
Here, as all parties have been duly served, all forms
(MC-051, 052, and 053) have been filed, and there are no substantive motions on
calendar to raise concerns of immediate prejudice, the court finds good cause
in granting the motion. To the extent there may be prejudice by way of this
order, Plaintiff has not filed an opposition to explain any. 
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing, the motion of Counsel Waverly Phou
is GRANTED, effective upon serving
this court’s order relieving Counsel sent to Plaintiff, Defendants, and all
other parties who have appeared in the case.
