And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling is a summary of the judge's thinking based on the information presented before the court. The judge notes that substantial evidence is defined as evidence that is "of ponderable legal significance, reasonable in nature, credible, and of solid value." The plaintiff has cited to several cases, including Silver Organizations Ltd. v. Frank, to argue that the court's "modicum of discretion" rule was criticized in those cases. However, the plaintiff's argument that the motion was filed at a late stage of the case is unfounded, as it may take an attorney a couple of months to file a motion. Therefore, the judge does not find that there was an unreasonable delay in filing the motion.
