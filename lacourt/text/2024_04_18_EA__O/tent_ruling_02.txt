According to CCP section 1005 subdivision (b), “All moving and supporting papers shall be
served and filed at least 16 court days before the hearing.” Here, 16
court days before the scheduled 4/18/24 hearing is 3/26/24. However, Plaintiff
did not file the motion until 4/2/24, meaning that inadequate notice was
provided. That said, as the proof of service provides that the parties were
provided with sufficient notice by 3/26/2024 such that there was ample time to
file an opposition, the court will exercise its discretion to overlook this
statutory defect.
