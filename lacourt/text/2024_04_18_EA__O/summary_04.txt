And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling outlines the facts of the case, including the accident involving a child and a dog on a property owned by Maria. The judge notes that Maria is the property owner, and Plaintiff and Lucia are tenants living in separate units. The judge finds that Lucia is responsible for the accident because she did not obey the no dog policy and continued to live on the property despite an unlawful detainer action. The judge also notes that Plaintiff is responsible because she was aware of the dog on the property. The judge references a court case, Lazar v. Lazar's Estate, which states that an estate cannot be sued. The judge's ruling is subject to change after further consideration and argument from the parties.
