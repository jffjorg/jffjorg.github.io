And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

"Ralphs Grocery Company's Motion for Leave to File Cross-Complaint is GRANTED. The court finds that the delay in filing the motion was due to oversight, and there is no showing of bad faith. The court also finds that there is no showing of prejudice to the plaintiff. The court must grant the motion unless there is a showing of bad faith or prejudice. In this case, the court is unpersuaded by the plaintiff's arguments that Ralphs' delay was due to bad faith. The court grants the motion and allows Ralphs to file a cross-complaint against the plaintiff."
