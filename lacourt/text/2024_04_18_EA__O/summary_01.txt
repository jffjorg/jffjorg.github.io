And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants Plaintiff's Counsel Waverly Phou's motion to be relieved as counsel due to the client's non-responsiveness and failure to pay attorney fees for months. The motion is granted as there is no substantive motion on calendar to raise concerns of immediate prejudice. The judge finds good cause in granting the motion.
