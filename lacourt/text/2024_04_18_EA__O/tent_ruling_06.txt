[1] Substantial evidenced is defined is evidence ... “ ‘of ponderable legal significance, ... reasonable in nature, credible,
and of solid value.’” (Silver, supra, 217 Cal.App.3d at p.
99 quoting Bowers v. Bernards (1984) 150 Cal.App.3d 870, 873.) 


[2] It is unclear
whether Plaintiff is using the cases to support its position or undermine its
position because Plaintiff cites to Silver Organizations Ltd. v. Frank (1990) 217 Cal. App.
3d 94, 99 to argue that the rule regarding the court’s “modicum of discretion”
as in Gherman and Foot’s Transfer, infra, was criticized
in Silver Organizations Ltd. 
 


[3] For this reason,
Plaintiff’s argument that the motion is made “at this late stage of the case”
(Opp. p. 5:7-9) is unfounded. 
 


[4] And as it may take
an attorney a couple of months to file a motion, there is arguably no unreasonable
delay as the information was learned 1/26/24 and the motion was filed less than
3/22/24, less than two months later.
