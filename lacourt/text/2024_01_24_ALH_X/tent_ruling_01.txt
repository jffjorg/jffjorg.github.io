BACKGROUND
 
            This case arises out of Plaintiff
Kyle Patterson’s (“Plaintiff”) claim that Defendant Maranatha High School
improperly denied his children access to their school. Plaintiff filed this
complaint on August 21, 2023.

Defendant’s demurrer is OVERRULED and its motion to strike is
DENIED as moot.
 
Plaintiff is granted leave to file a second amended complaint
within 20 days of the date of this order. 
 
LEGAL STANDARD
 
Demurrer 
 
A general
demurrer may be taken to a complaint where “[t]he pleading does not state facts sufficient to
constitute a cuse of action.” (Code of Civ. Proc. § 430.10(e).) A demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the
complaint states a cause of action.  (Hahn
v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal. App. 4th 740, 747.) In a demurrer proceeding, the
defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading or by proper judicial
notice.  (Code Civ. Proc. section
430.30(a).)  A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or
other extrinsic matters.  (SKF Farms v. Superior Court (1984) 153
Cal. App. 3d 902, 905.)  The only issue involved in a demurrer hearing is
whether the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous matters,
states a cause of action.  (Hahn v.
Mirda, supra, 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.)
 
Additionally, a
special demurrer to a complaint may be brought on the ground the pleading is
uncertain, ambiguous, or unintelligible. Code Civ. Proc section 430.10(f); Beresford Neighborhood Assn. v. City of
San Mateo (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 1180, 1191.) A demurrer based
on uncertainty is disfavored and will be strictly construed even when the
pleading is uncertain in some respects. (Khoury v. Maly's of California, Inc. (1993) 14
Cal.App.4th 612, 616.) A demurrers based on uncertainty are “granted only if
the pleading is so incomprehensible that a defendant cannot reasonably
respond.” (Lickiss v. Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (2012) 208
Cal.App.4th 1125, 1135.) 
 
Motion to Strike
 
Any party, within the time allowed to respond to a pleading
may serve and file a notice of motion to strike a pleading or any part
thereof.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 435, subd. (b)(1).)  The
court may, upon a motion, or at any time in its discretion, and upon terms
it deems proper, strike any irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in
any pleading.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 436, subd. (a).)  The court may
also strike all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with
California law, a court rule, or an order of the court.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 436, subd. (b).)  An immaterial or irrelevant allegation is one that is
not essential to the statement of a claim or defense; is neither pertinent to
nor supported by an otherwise sufficient claim or defense; or a demand for
judgment requesting relief not supported by the allegations of the
complaint.  (Code Civ. Proc., 431.10, subd. (b).)  The grounds for
moving to strike must appear on the face of the pleading or by way of judicial
notice.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 437.)   
 
DISCUSSION
 
            Defendant
purportedly objects to and moves to strike Plaintiff’ “first amended complaint”
Plaintiff filed his initial complaint on August 21, 2023. On October 23, 2023,
Plaintiff attempted to file an amended complaint that was rejected.
Additionally, it appears that the “amended complaint” may not have been served
on Defendant as no proof of service was attached or filed. After the rejection
of the amended complaint, Plaintiff applied for appointment as Guardian Ad
Litem and retained counsel. 
 
            Here,
procedural irregularities has created confusion among the parties as to what
the operative pleading at issue is. In opposition, Plaintiff requests leave to
amend the pleadings to correct any issues.
 
            Code of
Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (a)(1), provides, in part: “The court
may, in furtherance of justice, and on any terms as may be proper, allow a
party to amend any pleading or proceeding by adding or striking out the name of
any party, or by correcting a mistake in the name of a party, or a mistake in
any other respect; and may, upon like terms, enlarge the time for answer or
demurrer. The court may likewise, in its discretion, after notice to the
adverse party, allow, upon any terms as may be just, an amendment to any
pleading or proceeding in other particulars; and may upon like terms allow an
answer to be made after the time limited by this code.”
 
Plaintiff is granted leave to file a second amended
complaint.
 
CONCLUSION
 
Defendant’s demurrer is OVERRULED and its motion to strike is
DENIED as moot.
 
Plaintiff is granted leave to file a second amended complaint
within 20 days of the date of this order.
