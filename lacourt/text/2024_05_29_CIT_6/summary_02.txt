And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the motion of Charles O. Agege to be relieved as counsel for the plaintiff, without prejudice. The motion is unopposed. The judge notes that the declaration and proposed order submitted by Counsel do not provide sufficient information to determine whether the breach of the fee agreement is material and whether Counsel gave the plaintiff a reasonable warning of intent to withdraw unless the plaintiff fulfilled the fee agreement or performed his obligations. The judge also finds that the declaration does not identify the time and location of the next hearings in the matter. Therefore, the judge orders Counsel to give notice of this ruling and file proof of service of same within five calendar days.
