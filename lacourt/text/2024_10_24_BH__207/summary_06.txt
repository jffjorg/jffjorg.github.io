The court has granted a motion to appoint a successor arbitrator in a case where the original arbitrator was disqualified. The motion was brought by Wasser, Cooper & Mandles P.C. (WCM) and is unopposed. The court has appointed Roy Paul, Judge (Ret.) as the successor arbitrator, with Scott Gordon, Judge (Ret.) as an alternative in case Judge Paul is unable to serve. The motion is based on a declaration by Ira M. Friedman, which states that Respondent Douglas Schrier disqualified the original arbitrator, Judge Bobb, on September 17, 2024. The court has also ordered WCM to provide notice of the order and file the notice with proof of service.
