MOTION


Motion to Appoint Successor Arbitrator




MOVING PARTY


Petitioner Wasser, Cooper & Mandles P.C.




OPPOSING PARTY


(none)



 
BACKGROUND
 
            On July 25, 2024, the Court granted
Petitioner Wasser Cooperman & Mandles P.C.’s (“Petitioner”) petition to
compel Respondent Douglas Schrier (“Respondent”) to arbitration and appointed
Aviva Bobb, Judge (Ret.) as arbitrator. 
(Minute Order, Jul. 25, 2024.)  
 
Petitioner now moves for an order to appoint a successor Arbitrator on
the grounds that Respondent disqualified Judge Bobb as arbitrator.  The petition is unopposed.    
 
ANALYSIS
 
            In support of the motion, Petitioner
provides the Declaration of Ira M. Friedman, which provides:
 
4. On September 17, 2024, Respondent DOUGLAS SCHRIER
("SCHRIER") disqualified Judge Bobb as the Arbitrator in the within
matter. A copy of SCHRIER's disqualification sent to ARC is attached hereto as
Exhibit "B" and incorporated by reference. 
 
5. On behalf of WCM, I request that the Court appoint a successor
Arbitrator appointing either the Honorable Scott Gordon or the Honorable Roy
Paul as an Arbitrator in the within matter. Both of these retired judges have
extensive experience in Family Law, which is required by WCM's retainer
agreement.
 
(Friedman
Decl. ¶¶ 4-5.)  
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
Therefore, the Court
grants Petitioner’s motion and appoints Roy Paul, Judge (Ret.) as successor
arbitrator.  Further, in the event Judge
Paul is disqualified or otherwise unavailable to serve as arbitrator, the Court
alternatively appoints Scott Gordon, Judge (Ret.) as successor arbitrator.
 
Petitioner shall provide
notice of the Court’s order and file the notice with a proof of service forthwith.
