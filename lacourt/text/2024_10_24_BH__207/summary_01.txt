And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on two motions in limine filed by the cross-defendants. The first motion seeks to exclude evidence and testimony regarding the condition of any portion of the defendants/cross-complainants' property, other than the portions of the property as to which damages are claimed. The judge grants this motion, finding that the probative value of such evidence is substantially outweighed by the probability that its admission will necessitate undue consumption of time and create substantial danger of undue prejudice.

The second motion seeks to exclude lay witnesses from offering expert testimony and to exclude alleged hearsay statements between Dr. Afschin Farzad Mehr and the cross-complainants. The judge denies this motion, finding that it is plagued by defects, including a lack of specific identification of the evidence to be excluded. The judge also finds that the objection is premature, as it cannot anticipate each and every possible question that the opposing party may ask of witnesses at trial. The judge orders that the moving party may assert an objection to the introduction of specific evidence if and when the issue arises at trial.
