MOTIONS IN LIMINE - RULINGS
 



(A)            
  CROSS-COMPLAINANTS’  MOTIONS IN LIMINE




·       
   


MIL No. 1

FOR AN ORDER
  TO PRECLUDE ANY DOCUMENT NOT PRODUCED, CALLING WITNESSES NOT IDENTIFIED AND
  RAISING ANY MATTER OR CLAIM NOT DISCLOSED DURING PENDENCY OF THE ACTION
·       
  Cross-Defendant Opposes
NOT CONCRETE
  OR SPECIFIC:
This motion
  in limine is plagued by the same defects noted by the Court of Appeal in Kelly
  v. New West Federal Savings (1996) 49 Cal.App.4th 659:
On the other hand, many of the
  motions filed by Amtech were not properly the subject of motions in limine,
  were not adequately presented, or sought rulings which would merely be
  declaratory of existing law or would not provide any meaningful guidance for
  the parties or witnesses. For example, motion No. 19 sought to “... exclude
  any testimony of the plaintiffs which is speculative.” No factual support or
  argument was presented to suggest the nature and type of speculative
  testimony which Amtech expected to be elicited from plaintiffs. Motions No.
  8, 20 and 21 sought to exclude evidence of prior incidents unless an
  appropriate foundation was established to show the relevance of such evidence
  or that the prior incidents were similar in nature to the incident involved
  in the suit. Again, no factual support was presented in connection with the
  motions, meaning the court would have to rule in a vacuum. Motion No. 7,
  previously referred to, sought to limit the opinions of plaintiffs experts to
  those “rendered at deposition and in written reports.” Again, there was no
  supporting evidence to suggest what opinions had been rendered at the
  depositions, leaving the court and the parties to guess what opinions during
  trial may be included within the scope of the ruling. Motion No. 6 sought an
  order precluding plaintiffs from calling any witnesses “not previously
  identified in plaintiffs' discovery responses.” Absent a meaningful and
  expressed belief that this may occur, this was a meaningless motion unless
  and until plaintiffs attempted to call such witnesses.
(Kelly v.
  New West Federal Savings (1996) 49 Cal.App.4th 659, 670–671.)
For the same
  reasons stated in Kelly v. New West Federal Savings, the motion in
  limine here is not specific enough for the Court to make a meaningful order.  The motion fails to identify what specific
  evidence the moving party seeks to exclude. 
  As such, the motion in limine also fails to comply with Local Rule
  3.57.  (Super. Ct. L.A. County, Local
  Rules, rule 3.57(a)(1) [“Motions made for the purpose of precluding the
  mention or display of inadmissible and prejudicial matter in the presence of
  the jury must be accompanied by a declaration that includes the following: (1)
  Specific identification of the matter alleged to be inadmissible and
  prejudicial.”].)  Instead of
  identifying the specific evidence that the motion seeks to exclude, this
  motion in limine amounts to little more than a restatement of the law and
  general legal principles.  
Accordingly,
  the Court DENIES the motion in limine. 
  The moving party may at trial assert an objection to the introduction
  of specific evidence if and when this issue arises.

MIL No. 2

FOR AN ORDER TO
  PRECLUDE ARGUMENT, EVIDENCE OR TESTIMONY REGARDING THE CONDITION OF ANY
  PORTION OF DEFENDANTS/CROSSCOMPLAINANTS’ PROPERTY, OTHER THAN THE PORTIONS OF
  THE PROPERTY AS TO WHICH DAMAGES ARE CLAIMED
·       
  Cross-Defendant Opposes
352 EXCLUDE:
The Court has
  weighed the probative value of such evidence against the danger of undue
  prejudice and risk of necessitating undue consumption of time.  The Court has determined that the probative
  value of such evidence is substantially outweighed by the probability that
  its admission will necessitate undue consumption of time and create
  substantial danger of undue prejudice, confusing the issues, and misleading
  the jury.  (Evid. Code, § 352.)  
Therefore, the
  Court GRANTS the motion in limine.

MIL No. 2
TO EXCLUDE ALLEGED HEARSAY STATEMENTS BETWEEN DR. AFSHIN FARZADMEHR AND
  CROSS-COMPLAINTANTS
·       
  Cross-Complainants Oppose
DEFER RULING / PREMATURE:
Pursuant to Los
  Angeles County Superior Court Local Rules, rule 3.57(d), “[t]he court may
  defer ruling upon a motion in limine, and may order that no mention or
  display of the matter that is the subject of the motion be made in the
  presence of the jury unless and until the court orders otherwise.”  (Super. Ct. L.A. County, Local Rules, rule
  3.57(b), emphasis in original.)  
Further, the
  moving party’s objection is premature. 
  The Court cannot anticipate each and every possible question that the
  opposing party may ask of witnesses at trial, and cannot determine at this
  juncture whether such questions will elicit inadmissible hearsay testimony.  In short, the Court cannot sustain the
  moving party’s objection before a witness testifies at trial.  During trial, the moving party may object
  to the testimony of any witness, and the Court will rule on such objection at
  that time.
