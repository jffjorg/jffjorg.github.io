And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling addressing the objections to discovery based on burden and oppression. The judge notes that the Declaration of Girma H. Gebriel contained typos and grammatical errors, which were corrected to ensure understanding. The judge also references relevant California Supreme Court decisions, including West Pico Furniture Co. v. Superior Court, which established guidelines for burden and oppression objections. The judge concludes that the objections based on burden must be sustained by evidence showing the quantum of work required, while objections based on oppression must show an intent to create an unreasonable burden or that the ultimate effect of the burden is incommensurate with the result sought. The judge also applies the attorney-client privilege and work product doctrine, citing Evidence Code section 954 and Code of Civil Procedure section 2018.010, et seq. The judge determines that writings reflecting an attorney's impressions, conclusions, opinions, or legal research or theories are not discoverable, while other work product may be discoverable if denial of discovery would unfairly prejudice the party seeking discovery or result in an injustice.
