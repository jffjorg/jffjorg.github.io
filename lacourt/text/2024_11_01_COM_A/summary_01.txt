```

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the Plaintiffs' Motion to Tax Costs, which was filed late and exceeded the 30-day limit to extend the time for filing. The Plaintiffs had argued that the deadline was not calendared due to unforeseen and unavoidable staffing changes, but the judge found that this was not a sufficient reason to excuse the late filing.

The judge has also continued the hearing on Plaintiffs' Motion for Determination of Costs and Attorney's Fees Regarding Plaintiffs' Motion for Sanctions and Entry of Order. The Plaintiffs are seeking an award of fees totaling $68,450 and costs of $34,857.81, incurred in connection with their motion for sanctions, which the court granted. The Defendant argues that Plaintiffs are not entitled to relief because the jury decided in favor of the Defendant. The judge has ordered the Plaintiffs to comply with a prior order requiring billing and other relevant records and a supplemental declaration 10 court days prior to the hearing.

The judge has also denied the Plaintiffs' request for a stay of further proceedings pending appeal. The Plaintiffs had argued that a stay was automatic, but the judge found that this was not the case under California Code of Civil Procedure Section 916. The judge has ordered the Plaintiffs to file a noticed motion if they wish to request a stay.
