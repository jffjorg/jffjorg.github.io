Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied the Plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction to prevent the Defendants from deviating from section 10.2 of their lease. The Plaintiff, Hawkeye Entertainment, LLC, alleges that the Defendant, Michael Chang, and his company, Smart Capital, LLC, have interfered with the Plaintiff's use and enjoyment of the premises and have breached the lease agreement. The Judge found that the Plaintiff has a likelihood of prevailing on their breach of contract claims related to the lease, but the Plaintiff failed to show that they will be irreparably harmed if the motion is not granted.

The Judge also found that the Defendant's testimony was not credible and that the evidence presented was insufficient to show that the Defendant will continue to interfere with the Plaintiff's business operations. The Judge noted that the Plaintiff has other remedies available to them, such as seeking damages through a civil tort cause of action or a criminal prosecution.

The Judge's decision is based on the analysis of the likelihood of the Plaintiff prevailing on their claim and the potential harm that the Plaintiff may suffer if the motion is not granted. The Judge finds that the Plaintiff has not shown a sufficient likelihood of prevailing on their claim and that the potential harm to the Plaintiff is not irreparable.
