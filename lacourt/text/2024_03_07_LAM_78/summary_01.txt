The Plaintiff seeks to reconsider the Court's order based on five allegedly disputed facts related to whether a reasonable officer would have found probable cause to arrest him. However, the Court finds that the facts presented by the Plaintiff are not new evidence, as they were available at the time the Defendant made its motion for directed verdict. The Court also notes that the Plaintiff fails to allege new or different facts, circumstances, or law which would justify reconsideration under Code Civ. Proc., section 1008. As a result, the Plaintiff's motion for reconsideration is denied.
