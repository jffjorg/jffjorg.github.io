And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering the defendants' objections to the proposed judgment after the jury verdict. The defendants argue that the proposed judgment should be offset to reflect the amounts the plaintiffs received in reduction of their rent from the Rent Control Board. The court agrees that the issue of offsets should be decided prior to entry of judgment, citing cases such as Craig of Calif. v. Green and May v. Miller. However, the court finds that the defendants waived their right to request instructions to the jury concerning the rent reductions by declining an instruction from the court when it was discussed during a hearing on proposed instructions. The court also finds that the defendants cannot now make the request to the court where the jury may have already implicitly included a reduction in rent in determining the amount of compensatory damages they awarded. Therefore, the court overrules the objection and will enter the proposed judgment without offsetting it for the rent reductions.
