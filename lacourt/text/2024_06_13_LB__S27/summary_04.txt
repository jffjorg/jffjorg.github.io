And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The defendant, Costco Wholesale Corporation, has moved for summary judgment or adjudication on the plaintiff's claims. The plaintiff, Betty Jo Crawford, alleges that she was injured when she fell over a trellis in a cart at a Costco store. The defendant argues that it had no actual or constructive notice of any dangerous condition on its property and that the condition was caused by a third party, Parisa Faroutan, who stopped her cart in a crowded store. The court finds that there are triable issues of material fact concerning whether a Costco employee created the allegedly dangerous condition and whether Faroutan's actions were an intervening and superceding cause. Therefore, the defendant's motion for summary judgment is denied.
