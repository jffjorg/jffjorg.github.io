And here is the English text summary of the tentative ruling:

The judge has ruled that the defendants, Jeremy and Bridget Matthews, failed to cure serious problems at the property, including black mold growth, defective plumbing, and infestation. Despite repeated notice, the defendants failed to take necessary repairs, and instead told the plaintiff, Weston Spiro, to fix the problems himself and/or move out without proper notice, without paying relocation assistance, and without returning the security deposit. The court finds that the defendants acted despicably and with a conscious disregard for Spiro's health and safety, which is the definition of "malice" under California Civil Code ยง3294. The defendants are ordered to file an answer to the complaint within 10 days, and to provide notice to all parties.
