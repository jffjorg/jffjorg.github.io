```
Case Number: 23LBCV00427
Judge's Ruling: Tentative Ruling

People-Names:
  - Michael Read (Plaintiff)
  - General Motors, LLC (Defendant)

Case Facts:
  - Plaintiff Michael Read filed a lawsuit against General Motors, LLC for violations of the Song-Beverly Act, breach of implied warranty, and fraudulent inducement - concealment.
  - The operative complaint is the First Amended Complaint, filed on October 5, 2023.

Demurrer:
  - Defendant demurred to the fraud-based causes of action, arguing that they are barred by the statute of limitations, are not pled with the necessary specificity, and do not allege a transactional relationship giving rise to a duty to disclose.
  - Plaintiff argued that the complaint is timely, all essential elements are pled, and a transactional relationship is not required under California law to find a duty to disclose.

Statute of Limitations:
  - CCP ยง338(d) provides for a three-year statute of limitations on a fraud claim.
  - Defendant argued that the action is time-barred, citing paragraphs 11, 20, and 21 of the FAC.
  - Plaintiff argued that the statute of limitations does not act as a bar because (a) Plaintiff had not discovered facts constituting fraud at that point, (b) the fraudulent inducement continued every time he brought the vehicle in for repairs and was told it had been repaired, (c) the delayed discovery rule applies, (d) Defendant's ongoing concealment tolls the statute of limitations on the claim, and (e) the claim is tolled under the delayed repair doctrine.

Specificity:
  - Defendant's second argument is that Plaintiff failed to plead fraud with specificity.
  - Ordinarily, fraud claims are subject to strict requirements of particularity in pleading.
  - However, the specificity rule is intended to apply to affirmative misrepresentations and not to concealment.

Transactional Relationship:
  - The elements of a fraud claim based on concealment are: (1) the defendant must have concealed or suppressed a material fact, (2) the defendant must have been under a duty to disclose the fact to the plaintiff, (3) the defendant must have intentionally concealed or suppressed the fact with the intent to defraud the plaintiff, (4) the plaintiff must have been unaware of the fact and would not have acted as he did if he had known of the concealed or suppressed fact, and (5) as a result of the concealment or suppression of the fact, the plaintiff must have sustained damage.

Conclusion:
  - The Court finds the complaint adequately states a claim for fraud by concealment.
  - The demurrer is overruled.

Motion to Strike:
  - Defendant moves to strike Plaintiff's prayer for punitive damages from the complaint.
  - The prayer for punitive damages is made in connection with the fraud cause of action only.
  - A well-pled cause of action for fraud supports a claim for punitive damages.
  - The motion to strike is therefore denied.
