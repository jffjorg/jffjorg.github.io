And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

"Pursuant to the attached tentative ruling, the court is denying Defendant's motion to disqualify Plaintiff's counsel, Steven Schuman, on multiple grounds. First, Schuman was no longer representing Plaintiff in the marital dissolution proceedings at the time of the second settlement agreement in January 2022. Second, there is no evidence that Schuman was aware of Defendant's handling of the funds entrusted by Plaintiff. Third, Plaintiff's invocation of attorney-client privilege in response to certain of Defendant's discovery requests is not a basis for disqualification. Finally, Defendant delayed unreasonably in bringing the motion, which was filed on March 19, 2024, more than two years after Plaintiff sued Defendant for malpractice.

The court is also granting Defendant's motion to compel further responses to four special interrogatories, requiring Plaintiff to provide additional information about the orders in the martial dissolution proceeding, Barry's appeal of the order setting aside the initial settlement, and the terms of the second settlement agreement. However, the court is denying Defendant's request for an order imposing sanctions against Plaintiff in the form of attorney's fees incurred in filing the motion, as Plaintiff's position was substantially justified."
