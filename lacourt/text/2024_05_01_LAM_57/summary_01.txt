And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has granted the motion to consolidate the three lawsuits: Bernards Builders, Inc. vs. Rescore Hollywood, LLC and Berkley Insurance Company, Carpet U.S.A. vs. Bernards Builders, Inc., Rescore Hollywood, LLC, and Berkley Insurance Company, and Texim, Inc. vs. Bernards Builders, Inc., Rescore Hollywood, LLC, and Berkley Insurance Company. The court finds that the three lawsuits are related to the same construction project, Rise Hollywood, and present similar and overlapping issues. The court believes that consolidation will promote judicial economy by avoiding redundant procedures for the parties, multiple panels of jurors, and the court itself. The court has not been persuaded by the arguments of Carpet U.S.A. and Texim that their claims are sufficiently distinct from the issues in the Bernards Action.
