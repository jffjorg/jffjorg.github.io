And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendants' motion to compel arbitration in this case. The plaintiffs had filed a complaint alleging breach of contract, fraud, and other claims against the defendants, who are a real estate agent, contractors, and an engineering consulting firm. The defendants claimed that the case should be resolved through arbitration, rather than in court, because of an arbitration agreement contained in the Residential Purchase Agreement signed by the parties. The judge found that the defendants had met their burden of showing that the arbitration agreement existed and covered the dispute, and therefore granted the motion to compel arbitration. The judge also granted the defendants' motion to stay the action pending arbitration, meaning that all further proceedings in the case will be put on hold until the arbitration is completed. The judge set a status conference for December 4, 2023, to review the progress of the arbitration.
