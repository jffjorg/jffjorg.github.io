  - "A summons is the process by which a court acquires personal jurisdiction over a defendant in a civil action."
```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the defendant's motion to set aside the default judgment is granted. The default judgment is set aside, and the defendant is ordered to file and serve an answer on or before February 6, 2024. The defendant is notified that the address provided on his motion is his address of record for purposes of receiving notices from the Court and service from the plaintiff. If the defendant's address changes, he must immediately file a MC-040 and serve it on counsel for the plaintiff. The parties are ordered to appear at the hearing, which will be set at a later date. The judge found that the defendant did not have actual notice of the action in time to defend against it, and the plaintiff's failure to serve him at his actual residence was not excusable neglect.
