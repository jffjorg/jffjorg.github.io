And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling denying the plaintiff's motion to compel the deposition of Jennifer Pafiti, a witness for the defendant, and the production of documents. The plaintiff had served a deposition notice on Pafiti, who failed to appear for the deposition, and the plaintiff sought to compel Pafiti's attendance and testimony. The defendant opposed the motion, arguing that the plaintiff had not shown compliance with the requirements of the Los Angeles County Superior Court Guidelines for Civility in Litigation and the State Bar of California Guidelines of Civility and Professionalism. The defendant also argued that the plaintiff was not entitled to the exhaustive list of documents requested in the deposition notice and that Pafiti, as an individual witness, did not have access to the defendant's documents. The court denied the motion, finding that there was no real effort to meet and confer regarding the scheduling of Pafiti's deposition and that the deposition notice was directed to the defendant and was compelling the defendant to produce Pafiti and documents to the deposition. The court also denied the request for sanctions by both parties.
