```

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to strike the defendant's answer and affirmative defenses. The plaintiff filed the motion 60 days after the defendant's answer was filed, which is late. The motion is also procedurally defective because it was not brought at the same time as a demurrer, as required by law. Additionally, the plaintiff failed to meet and confer with the defendant before bringing the motion. The judge notes that the plaintiff's failure to meet and confer is a significant factor in the decision to deny the motion.
