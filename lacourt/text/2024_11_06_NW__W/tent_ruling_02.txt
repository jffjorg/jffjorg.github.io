BACKGROUND
 
This is a lemon law action. Plaintiff
Lonni LZ Inc. filed a complaint against Defendant General Motors LLC on June
23, 2023 for Violation of the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act. Plaintiff
alleges on October 16, 2022, Plaintiff purchased a 2023 Chevrolet Suburban.
However, the subject vehicle has suffered from nonconformities to warranty to, including,
but not limited to, the engine, pistons, check engine light, faulty valve cover
gasket, and other defects.
 
[Tentative] Ruling
 
Plaintiff’s Motion for Attorney Fees and
Costs Pursuant to Civil Code §1974(d) is Granted, in part. 
 
evidentiary OBJECTIONS
 
In reply, Plaintiff submits objections
to the declaration of Cameron Major submitted in support of Defendant’s
opposition to Plaintiff’s motion for attorney fees. 
 
Objection Nos. 1-12 are OVERRULED. 
 
discussion
 
Plaintiff Lonni LZ Inc. moves the court for an order for attorney
fees, costs, and post-judgment interest pursuant to the Judgment and as the
prevailing party. 
 
Under the Song-Beverly Act, Civil Code section 1794(d) “If the
buyer prevails in an action under this section, the buyer shall be allowed by
the court to recover as part of the judgment a sum equal to the aggregate
amount of costs and expenses, including attorney's fees based on actual time
expended, determined by the court to have been reasonably incurred by the buyer
in connection with the commencement and prosecution of such action.” The
lodestar method of calculating fees is appropriate in motions for attorney’s
fees under Civil Code section 1794. (Robertson v. Fleetwood Travel Trailers
of California, Inc (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 785, 818.) 
 
Plaintiff seeks $61,967.50 in attorney
fees representing 156.4 hours of work over more than a year of litigation at
the hourly rate of $595.00 for Joseph Kaufman (Shareholder), $375.00 for Christopher
Hunt (Associate), $475.00 for J. Brian Lynn (Senior Counsel) and $450.00 for
Jushua Ullman (Associate). Plaintiff contends they are entitled to reasonable
attorney fees and costs as the Judgment confirms that Plaintiff is considered
the prevailing party for the purposes of any motion for attorney fees and
costs. Plaintiff also argues they should receive a 1.5 multiplier, amounting
the total fees to $92,951.25. Plaintiff contends Plaintiff’s counsel l obtained
an excellent result for Plaintiff in a case where GM refused to repurchase
Plaintiff’s vehicle, even after being made aware of the vehicle’s numerous
defect. Moreover, Plaintiff’s counsel vigorously pursued Plaintiff’s case for
one year, despite the potential for their efforts to go uncompensated and
counsel litigated this matter from June of 2023 to the present without any
compensation for the costs or the loan of their services.
 
Fees Incurred 
 
In opposition, Defendant opposes the
motion for attorney fees on the grounds Plaintiff seeks an excessive amount of
attorney fees for a routine single-vehicle breach-of-warranty matter that
settled within statutory limits, presented no unique factual or legal issues,
and required no special expertise. Defendant argues a closer look at counsel’s
fee demand, time records and papers shows that the $92,951.25 is inflated and
unreasonable. Rather, a proper award would result in no more than $24,378.20 in
fees. Defendant contends the court should slash counsel’s request by 1/3 fees
on the grounds several time entries are unreasonable or reflect non-compensable
services. 
 
The court finds the following work
duplicative or excessive:
 
The court agrees that the time spent
preparing templated discovery requests to GM is unnecessarily duplicative and
excessive and should be reduced by 2.3 hours or $402.50.  The court strikes the 14 hours ($5648) spent
on the motion to compel GM’s PMQ, as the time spent is excessive and the court
has already found and awarded $1500 as reasonable attorney fees for this
motion.  The court finds the amount
billed for vehicle surrender and settlement disbursement to be excessive and
reduces that amount by 4.0 hour or $1500. 
The time spent communicating with client also appears exaggerated or
excessive for a case of this type, warranting a further reduction of 1.9 hours
of time spent by Christopher Hunt, or $712.50, and .7 hours of time spent by Jonny
Masry, or $122.50.  The amount spent on
scheduling a mediation is also inappropriately billed by counsel as that
routine task should have been done by a secretary, for a reduction of 1.5 hours
($562.50.)   The amount of time spent on
preparing this routine attorney fee motion is also excessive, warranting a
further reduction of 2.6 hours of time spent by Mr. Lynn, for a further
reduction of $1235.  In addition, the
court deducts 2.1 hours spent organizing repair orders by Chris Hunt, for a
further reduction of $787.50, and .2 hours spent by a legal assistant to
understand the local rules re IDCs, for a final reduction of $35.  The total reduction is $11,005.50.
 
Multiplier
 
Next, Defendant argues this case does
not warrant a multiplier. The court agrees. Once the court has fixed the
lodestar, it may increase or decrease that amount by applying a positive or
negative multiplier to take into account a variety of factors.  (Laffitte
v. Robert Half Intern, Inc. (2016) 1 Cal.5th 480, 489.)  The lodestar
amount of attorney’s fees “may be adjusted by the court based on factors
including . . .  (1) the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved,
(2) the skill displayed in presenting them, (3) the extent to which the nature
of the litigation precluded other employment by the attorneys, [and] (4) the
contingent nature of the fee award. [Citation.]”  (Bernardi v. County
of Monterey (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 1379, 1399.) This was a routine lemon
law action and nothing before the court indicates that the case presented novel
issues. Moreover, any contingency risk factor is already accounted for in the
hourly rates. 
 
Hourly Rates
 
Defendant also argues the hourly rates
are unreasonable. The court disagrees. As noted above, Plaintiff’s counsel’s
hourly rates are as follows: $595.00 for Joseph Kaufman (Shareholder), $375.00
for Christopher Hunt (Associate), $475.00 for J. Brian Lynn (Senior Counsel)
and $450.00 for Jushua Ullman (Associate). Generally, a reasonable hourly rate
is prevailing in the community where the case is litigated for similar work. (PLCM
Group v. Dexter (2000) 22 Cal.4th 15 1084, 1095 ["PLCM"]; MBNA
America Bank, N.A. v. Gorman (2006) 147 16 Cai.App.4th Supp. 1, 13.) Here, Plaintiff
has submitted evidence of hourly rates charged consistent with what counsel
seeks based on the same level of experience. 
 
Costs 
 
Plaintiff seeks $1,177.06 in filing and
motion fees; $198.86 in service of process fees, and $15.03 for photocopies,
postage, and purchase of minute order (see other). 
 
Defendant asks for a reduction of
$130.36 for service of deposition subpoena on Keyes Chevrolet. GM argues it
should not be required to reimburse counsel for costs directed at another
party. 
 
Plaintiff argues the motion is untimely.
The court agrees. Any motion to strike or tax costs must be filed and served 15 days
after service of the Cost Memorandum plus any additional days for the manner of
service. (Rules of Court, Rule 3.1700(b)(1).) In this case, Defendant needed to
file and serve its motion challenging Plaintiff’s Cost Memorandum 17 days after
August 26, 2024 (15 days plus 2 for electronic delivery), i.e., September 12,
2024. Defendant failed to do so and filed its request to reduce costs on
October 24, 2024. 
 
Interest
 
Plaintiff seeks $636.71 in post-judgment interest based on 10% of
the judgment, with an interest rate of $22.7397 per day. Defendants do not
address this in their opposition. The post judgment interest will be included
in the award. 
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s
Motion for Attorney Fees and Costs is GRANTED in the REDUCED AMOUNT of $50,962.50
in fees, plus costs of $1390.95.
