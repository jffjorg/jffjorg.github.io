Summary:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on Plaintiff Susan Naimi's motion to compel the deposition of Jennifer Pafiti of Defendant The Oaks of Calabasas Homeowners' Association and production of documents. The motion is denied because the parties did not make a genuine effort to meet and confer regarding the scheduling of Pafiti's deposition. The court finds that the deposition notice is directed to the HOA, and the HOA must properly state whether the documents are no longer in its possession. The court will hear from the parties at the hearing to determine whether a mutually agreed-upon date for Pafiti's deposition can be set.
