And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the motions in limine filed by the defendant, Honeywell, and has issued a tentative ruling. Honeywell's motions include requests to exclude evidence and references related to asbestos exposure, foreign bans, and various government documents. The judge has denied some of these motions without prejudice, allowing the parties to continue to use the evidence at trial, while granting others, such as the motion to exclude evidence of the publication "Doubt is Their Product".

The judge has also denied Honeywell's motions to exclude evidence of working conditions at its facilities and evidence of the publication "Guidance for Preventing Asbestos Disease Among Auto Mechanics", as well as evidence of William Longo and Richard Hatfield's work simulations.

The judge has granted Honeywell's motion to exclude evidence of workers' compensation actions to the extent that the details of the claims would be unduly prejudicial, time-consuming, and confusing to the jury.

The judge has also denied Honeywell's motion to exclude evidence of Bendix's conduct and knowledge after the last exposure, as well as evidence of OSHA and EPA regulations, as these could be relevant to notice.

The judge's tentative ruling does not address some of the motions, including those related to the exclusion of evidence of statements of and proceedings of OSHA, the EPA, and any other governmental agency, as well as arguments that any exposure is a "substantial factor". These motions are deemed denied without prejudice, allowing the parties to continue to use the evidence at trial.

The judge's ruling is subject to change based on further briefing and argument at the hearing scheduled for March 18, 2024.
