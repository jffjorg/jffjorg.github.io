And here is a summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendants' motions in limine, excluding certain evidence from trial. The motions in limine aim to exclude evidence related to foreign bans on chrysotile asbestos, EPA documents, FMSI documents, letters and memos from E.A. Martin, workers' compensation actions, governmental agency statements and proceedings, OSHA regulations, and the Pneumo Abex Asbestos Claims Settlement Trust.

The judge grants some of the motions, such as excluding evidence of foreign bans and excluding certain documents from E.A. Martin, while denying others, such as excluding expert testimony and excluding evidence of punitive and non-pecuniary damages under maritime law.

The judge also notes that some of the motions are too vague or unclear, and therefore denies them without prejudice to objections at trial. The judge emphasizes the importance of relevance, admissibility, and non-prejudice in determining which evidence is allowed or excluded from trial.
