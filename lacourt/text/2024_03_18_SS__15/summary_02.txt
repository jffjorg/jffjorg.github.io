Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled on several motions in limine filed by the parties. The judge will not define the questions that can and cannot be asked in voir dire, as motions in limine are not the proper place to do so. Expressions of sympathy by defense counsel are not evidence and are not prohibited by law.

The judge has also ruled that background exposure to asbestos is relevant and admissible as evidence, and that the government's use of asbestos is too vague to be excluded as evidence. Statements about God or Mother Nature are not prejudicial and are not prohibited by law.

The judge has denied several motions to exclude evidence, including evidence about other defendants not at trial, the complaint, and evidence about foreign governmental investigations and proceedings into talcum powder. The judge has also granted several motions, including the motion to exclude evidence about other diseases caused by talc and the motion to bifurcate punitive damages.

The judge has also ruled that certain evidence may be admissible, including articles, expert testimony, and evidence about industrial talc mines and products. The judge has also ruled that references to internal documents from Johnson & Johnson, Imerys, and Cyprus are too vague to be excluded as hearsay and not relevant.

In summary, the judge has denied several motions to exclude evidence and granted several motions, including the motion to bifurcate punitive damages. The judge has also ruled that certain evidence may be admissible, including articles, expert testimony, and evidence about industrial talc mines and products.
