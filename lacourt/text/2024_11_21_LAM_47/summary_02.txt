And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

Judge Theresa M. Traber has issued a tentative ruling granting Attorney Sally Chan's motion to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff Jonathan Kendrick. The motion was filed on behalf of West Themis Law, PC, citing a breach of the retainer agreement between Plaintiff and counsel. The judge found that the risk of prejudice to the parties is low, as the trial date has not been set and the only other hearing in the matter is a Case Management Conference. The court notes that an attorney may withdraw with or without cause, as long as the withdrawal would not result in undue prejudice to the client's interest. In this case, the judge exercises her discretion reasonably and grants the motion, conditioned on Moving Counsel giving notice to all parties and filing proof of service with the court.
