CASE NO.:                 23STCV26607            
 
MOTION
TO BE RELIEVED AS COUNSEL

 
MOVING PARTY:               Attorney Sally Chan on behalf of West Themis Law, PC
 
RESPONDING PARTY(S): No response on
eCourt as of 11/18/24
 
STATEMENT
OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
            This is a defamation action that was filed on October 30, 2023. Plaintiff
alleges that Defendant accused Plaintiff of fraud in correspondence with one of
Plaintiff’s business associates, damaging that relationship.
 
Attorney Sally Chan, on behalf of
West Themis Law, PC, moves to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff. 
            
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Attorney Sally Chan, on behalf of
West Themis Law, PC, moves to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff. 
 
Moving Counsel filed all three required forms (MC-051,
-052, and -053) and filed proof of service by mail with the Court. Moving Counsel
served the motions on the Plaintiff by mail and confirmed that the address is
current by telephone. (MC-052 ¶ 3(b).) 
 
In general, an attorney may withdraw with
or without cause as long as the withdrawal would not result in undue prejudice
to the client’s interest – i.e., counsel cannot withdraw at a critical point in
the litigation, because that would prejudice client, but can withdraw
otherwise. (Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal. App. 4th 904,
915.) The court has discretion to deny an attorney’s request to withdraw where
the withdrawal would work an injustice or cause undue delay in the proceeding,
but the court’s discretion in this area is one to be exercised reasonably. (Mandell
v. Superior Court (1977) 67 Cal.App.3d 1, 4.)   
            Here, trial in this matter not yet
set. (MC-052 ¶ 6.) The only other hearing in this matter is a Case Management
Conference set to coincide with the hearing on this motion. The risk of
prejudice to Plaintiff is therefore low. Moving Counsel states that withdrawal
is necessary because there has been a breach of the retainer agreement between
Plaintiff and counsel. (MC-052 ¶ 2.) In light of the low risk of prejudice to
the parties at this juncture, the Court finds that Moving Counsel has
demonstrated good cause for withdrawal. 
 
            Accordingly,
Attorney Sally Chen’s Motion to be Relieved as Counsel for Plaintiff is
GRANTED.
 
            This
ruling is conditioned on Moving Counsel giving notice to all parties and filing
proof of service with the Court. 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
