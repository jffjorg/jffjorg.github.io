Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied both the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment and the plaintiff's motion for summary adjudication. The plaintiff, JNM, Inc., sought to recover unpaid rent and breach of contract from the defendant, United Valet Parking, Inc. The judge found that the plaintiff had not established a right to summary adjudication because it failed to demonstrate that it had performed all of its obligations under the lease agreements.

The judge also denied the defendant's motion for summary adjudication of the cross-complaint. The defendant alleged that the plaintiff breached the lease agreements by failing to maintain the property and that the plaintiff was responsible for the flooding of the office spaces. The judge found that the defendant had not established a right to summary adjudication because it failed to demonstrate that the plaintiff had breached the lease agreements.

The judge's ruling is based on the parties' pleadings, declarations, and exhibits, as well as California law and case precedent. The case will proceed to a trial date on February 3, 2025.
