(Phillips Decl., ¶¶ 8-22, Ex. 1.) Plaintiff demonstrates that it is entitled to possession of the Subject Vehicle by providing a copy of its registered title for the Subject Vehicle. (Id. ¶ 10, Ex. 2.) Plaintiff states it is authorized to bring this action on behalf of Plaintiff pursuant to the terms of a separate servicing agreement and power of attorney. (Id. ¶ 11.) Plaintiff establishes that the Subject Vehicle is wrongfully detained by Defendant Baker. (Id. ¶¶ 13-17.) Plaintiff provides that on or about March 12, 2022, Defendant Austin Baker entered into a written motor vehicle lease agreement with BMW of El Cajon, for valuable consideration regarding the Subject Vehicle. (Id. ¶ 8, Ex. 1.) Upon Defendant Baker’s default of failure and refusal to pay the monthly payments, Plaintiff may repossess the vehicle if done so peacefully and the law allows it pursuant to paragraph 3(d). (Id., Ex. 1 p.4.) The vehicle sought to be attached is a 2022 BMW M550XI motor vehicle, Serial No. WBA13BK0XNCJ57333, estimated to be worth between $61,866.00. (Phillips Decl., ¶ 20, Ex. 4.)

Plaintiff has complied with the requirements of 512.030.Issues at Hearing“At the hearing, a writ of possession shall issue if both of the following are found: [¶] (1) The plaintiff has established the probable validity of the plaintiffs claim to possession of the property. [¶] (2) The undertaking requirements of Section 515.010 are satisfied.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 512.060, subd. (a).) “A claim has ‘probable validity’ where it is more likely than not that the plaintiff will obtain a judgment against the defendant on that claim.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 511.090.) A writ of possession shall not issue unless the plaintiff files an undertaking “in an amount not less than twice the value of the defendant's interest in the property or in a greater amount.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 515.010(a).)Plaintiff states that no equity exists for Defendant Baker because Defendant Baker owes more than the value of the Subject Vehicle. (Phillips Decl., ¶ 21.) Plaintiff requests that Defendant Baker be required to post a re-delivery bond in the sum of $71,000.00, which is the account balance, and includes an estimated $1,000.00 for attorney’s fees and court costs. (Ibid.)Plaintiff has established the probable validity of its claim to possession of the property through the registered title for the subject vehicle. (Phillips Decl., ¶ 10, Ex. 2.)
