Roles:

Significant Statements:
  - "Before a court may enter an order permitting discovery of a defendant's financial condition, it must (1) weigh the evidence submitted in favor of and in opposition to motion for discovery, and (2) make a finding that it is very likely the plaintiff will prevail on his claim for punitive damages." (Jabro, supra, 95 Cal.App.4th at 758)
  - "The Court appreciates Defendant Sobol's argument that the instant motion is untimely and should have been brought earlier in this case. That said, if Plaintiff had sought ex parte relief to hear this motion prior to July 14, the Court would have granted that request and advanced the hearing date."
  - "The instant motion is GRANTED, however, disclosure of Defendant Sobol's financial information is limited to Plaintiff's counsel only."
