And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling regarding two motions filed by the plaintiff, Norma Gonzalez, against Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC. The motions seek an order deeming truth of matter in the plaintiff's requests for admission admitted and compelling the defendant to provide responses to special interrogatories and request for sanctions.

The court finds that there appears to be a lack of communication between the parties regarding service and response. The defendant has failed to provide responses to the plaintiff's written discovery requests, despite being served with them. The court orders the defendant to provide substantially code-compliant responses to the written discovery requests within 10 days of the court's order.

The court also declines to impose sanctions on the defendant currently, but warns that if there continue to be discovery disputes, the parties should be aware that the court may order the plaintiff and defendant to provide copies of certain documents, including the "Warranty Policy and Procedure Manual", internal analysis or investigation regarding defects, customer complaints, and other documents.

The court sets a hearing date of August 1, 2024, to further consider the motions.
