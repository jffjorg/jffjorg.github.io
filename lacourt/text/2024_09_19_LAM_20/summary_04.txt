  - "If the employer meets its initial burden, the burden shifts to the employee to 'demonstrate a triable issue by producing substantial evidence that the employer's stated reasons were untrue or pretextual, or that the employer acted with a discriminatory animus, such that a reasonable trier of fact could conclude that the employer engaged in intentional discrimination or other unlawful action.'"

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled on a motion for summary adjudication brought by the defendants, Walmart Inc., Wal-Mart Associates, Inc., and Oscar Mejia, regarding the fourth and fifth causes of action in the plaintiff, Melissa Loyd's, First Amended Complaint. The plaintiff claims retaliation and wrongful termination due to Mejia's alleged harassment and the denial of a promotion to a Coach position.

The court has found that the defendants have presented a legitimate reason for not promoting the plaintiff, which was the elimination of the Assistant Manager (ASM) position nationwide and the creation of limited Coach positions. The court has also found that the plaintiff has failed to show pretext and that her claims of harassment and retaliatory motive are insufficient.

The court has granted the defendants' motion for summary adjudication and sustained their objections to the extent discussed in the ruling. The court has also encouraged counsel to submit on the tentative ruling and to appear by LACourtConnect rather than in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
