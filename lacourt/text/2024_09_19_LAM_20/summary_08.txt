And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion for attorney fees and costs in a lemon law matter brought by Silvia and Keith Gallegos. The plaintiffs are seeking $40,974.00, which includes $26,973.00 in attorney fees for Strategic Legal Practices, APC, a 1.35 multiplier enhancement on those fees, $1,060.45 in costs and expenses for the law firm, and an additional $3,500.00 for the plaintiffs' counsel to review the defendant's opposition, draft a reply, and attend a hearing. The court declines to award a multiplier enhancement because the case was not novel or complex, and also declines to award the full amount for the reply because there was no opposition. The court grants the motion in part, awarding the attorney fees and costs requested, but only for the amounts that were incurred. The court also grants the Request for Judicial Notice.
