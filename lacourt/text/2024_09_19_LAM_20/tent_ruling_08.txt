This is a lemon law matter.  Plaintiffs Silvia and Keith Gallegos now seek “$40,974.00. This amount consists of (1) $26,973.00 in attorney fees for Strategic Legal Practices, APC (“SLP”); (2) a 1.35 multiplier enhancement on the attorney fees (or $9,440.55); (3) $1,060.45 in costs and expenses for SLP; and (4) an additional $3,500.00 for Plaintiffs’ counsel to review Defendant’s Opposition, draft the Reply, and attend the hearing on this Motion (though counsel expects to incur over $3,500.00 in fees on these tasks).”The Court declines to award a multiplier because, among other reasons, this was not a novel or complex matter.  The Court will also not award $3,500 associated with a reply because there was no opposition.  Because the Motion is unopposed, the Court will award the remainder of the fees requested.  The Motion is granted in part as set forth herein.  The RJN is granted.Moving parties to give notice.
