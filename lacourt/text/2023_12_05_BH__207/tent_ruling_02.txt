[1] The heading for the demurrer to the breach of
contract cause of action indicates it is a demurrer to the “first” cause of
action, and the text of that demurrer indicates “Plaintiff’s second cause for
breach of contract[.]”  Because breach of
contract is the third cause of action listed in the SAC, the Court construes
this as demurring to the third cause of action for breach of contract.
 


[2] The Court notes that the Notice of Motion indicates
the Motion is brought pursuant to subdivision (d) on the grounds “that the
causes of action alleged against Defendants fail to state a cause” but the
demurrers themselves indicate they are brought pursuant to subdivisions (e) and
(f).  Subdivision (d) pertains to
misjoinder, whereas subdivision (e) pertains to failure to state a cause of
action, and subdivision (f) pertains to uncertainty.  The Court therefore construes the motion as
being brought pursuant to subdivisions (e) and (f).


[3] Ultimate
facts are those “constituting the cause of action” or those upon which
liability depends, e.g., duty of care, breach of the duty and causation
(damages).  (See Doe v. City of Los
Angeles (2007) 42 Cal.4th 531, 550.) 
“[T]he term ultimate fact generally refers to a core fact, such as an
essential element of a claim. Ultimate facts are distinguished from evidentiary
facts and from legal conclusions.”  (Central
Valley General Hosp. v. Smith (2008) 162 Cal.App.4th 501, 513 [cleaned up];
see also Rodriguez v. Parivar, Inc. (2022) 83 Cal.App.5th 739, 750–751
[“The elements of a cause of action constitute the essential or ultimate facts
in a civil case”].)
