And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling is in response to a demurrer filed by defendants DH Distribution and Larissa Menshikova to a second amended complaint filed by plaintiff Fred Behfarin. The demurrer was made on the grounds that the complaint is uncertain and fails to state a cause of action.

The court has sustained the demurrer to the first, third, and eighth causes of action for specific performance, breach of contract, and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, respectively, as to Larissa Menshikova, without leave to amend. The court has also sustained the demurrer to the fifth and sixth causes of action for intentional and negligent misrepresentation, respectively, as to Larissa Menshikova, without leave to amend.

The court has overruled the demurrer to the second amended complaint as to DH Distribution, but sustained the demurrer to the seventh cause of action for tortious interference with contract, prospective business advantage, without leave to amend.

The court has also granted plaintiff leave to amend the complaint to request injunctive and declaratory relief as remedies, as opposed to causes of action.

The court has ordered plaintiff to file and serve a third amended complaint in conformance with the ruling by January 2, 2024.
