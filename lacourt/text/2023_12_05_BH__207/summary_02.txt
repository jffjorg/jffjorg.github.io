And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer to the breach of contract cause of action. The demurrer is brought by the defendants and challenges the sufficiency of the plaintiff's claims. The judge notes that the demurrer is brought under subdivisions (e) and (f) of the California Code of Civil Procedure, which pertain to failure to state a cause of action and uncertainty. The judge also explains the concept of "ultimate facts," which are the core facts that constitute the cause of action or upon which liability depends. The judge will consider these ultimate facts in determining the validity of the breach of contract cause of action.
