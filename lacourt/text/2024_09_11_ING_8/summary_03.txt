And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the State of California's demurrer to the plaintiff's complaint. The State demurred to the complaint, arguing that it fails to state a cause of action against the State. The judge agrees with the State, holding that the complaint does not allege a claim for statutory liability against the State.

The judge notes that the Government Claims Act requires that a public entity be liable only if a statute declares it to be liable. The plaintiff's complaint does not allege any statutory liability against the State, and instead alleges common law negligence and premises liability. The judge holds that the complaint does not meet the pleading standards under the Government Claims Act and therefore the State is immune from common law claims.

The judge grants the State's demurrer, sustaining it with 30 days leave to amend. The judge also instructs the plaintiff to ensure that any amended complaint is pleaded with specificity and to delineate between allegations against private defendants and public entities.
