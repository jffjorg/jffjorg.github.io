  Case Number:  23TRCV00841    Hearing Date:   September 11, 2024    Dept:  8 Tentative Ruling   HEARING DATE:                 September 11, 2024    CASE NUMBER:                  23TRCV00841  CASE NAME:                      Carlitta  Smith v. Robin Lynn Thompson, et al.   MOVING PARTY:                Defendant, Robin Lynn Thompson RESPONDING PARTY:       Plaintiff, Carlitta Smith TRIAL DATE:                        Not Set.    MOTION:                             (1) Motion to Set Aside  Default   Tentative Rulings:                  (1) ARGUE.      I. BACKGROUND  A.    Factual    On March 21, 2023, Plaintiff, Carlitta Smith  (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Defendants, Robin Lynn Thompson, Terry  Holt as Trustee of the Holt Living Trust dated September 6, 2002, Sandra Hold  as Trustee of the Holt Living Trust dated September 6, 2002, and DOES 1 through  25. The complaint alleges causes of action for: (1) Negligence; (2) Common Law  Strict Liability; and (3) Strict Liability (Dog Bite Statute).     Defendant, Robin Lynn Thompson (“Thompson”) notes that  on April 22, 2021, she received a Letter of Representation from Plaintiff’s  attorney. On April 27, 2021, Thompson notes that a claims adjuster, Jennifer  Wilmoth, spoke with Plaintiff’s attorney, confirming the facts of the incident.  On November 18, 2023, Thompson notes that Plaintiff served a copy of the  summons and complaint to her PO box that she never checks, and did not find the  copy of the summons and complaint until the middle of March 2024.    On February 9, 2024, this Court entered default  against Defendant Thompson.    On June 11, 2024, this Court notes that defense  counsel for Thompson filed a Motion to Strike punitive damages and served this  on the Plaintiff’s attorney via email. This Court DENIED the motion to strike  as Defendant Thompson was effectively not a part of the case as she defaulted.                Now, Defendant Thompson files a  Motion to Set Aside Default.    B.      Procedural    On July 30, 2024, Defendant  Thompson filed a Motion to Set Aside Default. On August 12, 2024, Plaintiff  filed an opposition brief.    On August 12, 2024, this  motion was originally heard. On the Court’s own motion, the hearing was  continued to September 11, 2024. Warren Jr. was ordered to file a declaration  on or before September 9, 2024.  On  August 30, 2024, Linwood Warren Jr. filed the declaration.    II. REQUEST FOR JUDICIAL  NOTICE                With Plaintiff’s opposition brief, she requested this  Court take judicial notice of the following documents:    1.       Plaintiff’s Request for Entry of Default which  was signed and entered into by the court clerk on February 9, 2024. (Exhibit  “D.”) 2.       Plaintiff filed Proof of Service to Defendant  via substituted service which was received by the court on February 9, 2024.  (Exhibit “B.”)   The Court GRANTS this request and  takes judicial notice of the above.    III. ANALYSIS    A.      Legal Standard   Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure §473(b), both  discretionary and mandatory relief is available to parties from a judgment,  dismissal, order, or other proceeding.  Discretionary relief is available  under the statute as “the court may, upon any terms as may be just, relieve a  party or his or her legal representative from judgment, dismissal, order, or  other proceeding taken against him or her through his or her mistake,  inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.  (Code of Civ. Proc. §¿473(b).)   Alternatively, mandatory relief is available when “accompanied by an attorney’s  sworn affidavit attesting to his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or  neglect.”  (Ibid.)  Under  this statute, an application for discretionary or mandatory relief must be made  no more than six months after entry of the judgment, dismissal, order, or other  proceeding from which relief is sought.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 473(b); English  v. IKON Business Solutions (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 130, 143.)     “‘[W]hen relief under section  473 is available, there is a strong public policy in favor of granting relief  and allowing the requesting party his or her day in court…[Citation.]” (Rappleyea  v. Campbell¿(1994) 8 Cal. 4th 975, 981-82.)            B.      Discussion    Mistake,  Inadvertence, Surprise, or Excusable Neglect                At the  previous hearing, the Court notes that the motion was continued because neither  the moving papers nor the previous declaration of Linwood Warren Jr. included  an affidavit attesting to the mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect of  Warren Jr. himself. Since then, on August 30, 2024, Warren Jr. filed a  supplemental declaration where paragraph 12 and 13 have been added and state:  “Plaintiff’s Default was only obtained because of mistake, inadvertence,  surprise, or excusable neglect.” (Supplemental Declaration of Linwood Warren  Jr. (“Warren Jr. Supp. Decl.”), ¶ 12.) Warren Jr. further has stated that he is  requesting this Court grant relieve to his client’s default which was taken by  way of mistake, inadvertence, surprise, and excusable neglect. (Warren Jr.  Supp. Decl., ¶ 13.)    The supplemental declaration does not attest to the mistake,  inadvertence, surprise, and/or excusable neglect of Warren Jr. or any other  identified person. Instead, the declaration merely contends that the default  occurred because of someone’s mistake, inadvertence, surprise, and/or excusable  neglect generally. This is insufficient for Section 473(b) relief.  If Warrren Jr. did not himself make a mistake  or was not neglectful, then he cannot testify under penalty of perjury that the  default occurred due to a Section 473(b) ground.                 Code of  Civil procedure section 473(b) requires a request of mandatory relief to be accompanied by an attorney’s sworn affidavit attesting to his  or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect. The Court seeks oral argument from Warren Jr. on whether  his is able to provide this affidavit or not.
