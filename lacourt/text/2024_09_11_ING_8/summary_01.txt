And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to set aside a default judgment in a case involving a plaintiff, Carlitta Smith, and defendant, Robin Lynn Thompson. The defendant argues that the default was due to mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect, and seeks to have the default set aside. The court notes that the defendant's motion is incomplete because it does not include an affidavit attesting to the mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect of the defendant's attorney, Linwood Warren Jr. The court seeks oral argument from Warren Jr. to determine whether he can provide the necessary affidavit. The court also takes judicial notice of the plaintiff's request for entry of default and proof of service.
