And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by American Honda Motor Co., Inc. (AHM) to the complaint filed by Olga Odell (Plaintiff). The judge has sustained the demurrer without leave to amend, meaning that the Plaintiff's claims are time-barred due to the statute of limitations.

The judge found that the Plaintiff's claims for breach of express warranty and implied warranty of merchantability are time-barred because the Plaintiff did not file the lawsuit until March 6, 2024, which is well after the statute of limitations had expired. The judge also found that the Plaintiff had failed to allege specific facts to show when she discovered the defects and the inability to have earlier discovered the elements of her cause of action.

The judge noted that the Plaintiff had alleged that she brought the vehicle to repair multiple times, including in 2019 and 2021, but did not provide specific facts as to when she discovered that the repairs had failed to cure the claimed defects. The judge also noted that the Plaintiff did not allege any facts that claim the repairs took place prior to the vehicle being driven 60,000 miles, or that tolling that may have taken place prior to the July 16, 2019 date and prior to driving over 60,000 miles on the subject vehicle.

The judge will allow oral argument as to what the Plaintiff contends could be contained in a further amended pleading to address the defects discussed in the tentative ruling.
