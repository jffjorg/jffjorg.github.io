Here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English:

The Judge has denied Defendant Kenneth Childs' motion for a judgment on the pleadings, which was filed as to the three causes of action asserted against him: intentional infliction of emotional distress, attempted extortion, and aiding and abetting attempted extortion. The Judge found that Plaintiff Iris Au has alleged sufficient facts to support her claims, including allegations that Defendant Childs participated in a scheme to extort money from her and posted anonymous online comments damaging her reputation. The Judge also found that Plaintiff has set forth sufficient information to support her basis for believing Defendant Childs to be associated with the anonymous online comments and the anonymous " $" texter. The Judge will not make a factual determination as to whether the conduct rises to the level of extreme and outrageous conduct at this stage.
