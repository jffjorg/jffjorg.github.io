22STCV20863
Defendant’s Motion to Compel the Deposition of Plaintiff Johnish Harrison
 
Tentative
The motion is DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.
Background
On June 27, 2022, Plaintiffs Jennifer Chavez and Johnish
Harrison (collectively “Plaintiffs”) filed their complaint against Jacqueline
Tuggle (“Defendant”), Keishia Caldwell, and DOES 1 through 50, for a negligence
cause of action.
 
On October 30, 2023, Defendant filed an answer. On December 27, 2023,
Defendant filed a cross-complaint against Jennifer Chavez. On May 8, 2024, the
cross-complaint was dismissed.
 
On November 27, 2024, Defendant filed the motion to
compel the deposition of Plaintiff Johnish Harrison. No opposition has been
filed.
 
Legal Standard
Code of Civil Procedure § 2025.450(a)
provides: 
“If, after service of a deposition notice, a
party to the action or an officer, director, managing agent, or employee of a
party, or a person designated by an organization that is a party under Section
2025.230, without having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails
to appear for examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for inspection
any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in
the deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move for an order
compelling the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the production for
inspection of any document, electronically stored information, or tangible
thing described in the deposition notice.” 
 The
motion shall “(1) set forth specific facts showing good cause justifying the
production for inspection of any document, electronically stored information,
or tangible thing described in the deposition notice” and “(2) be accompanied
by a meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040, or, when the deponent
fails to attend the deposition and produce the documents, electronically stored
information, or things described in the deposition notice, by a declaration
stating that the petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire about the
nonappearance.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2025.450(b).) 
“Any party served with a deposition notice
that does not comply with Article 2 (commencing with Section 2025.210) waives
any error or irregularity unless that party promptly serves a written objection
specifying that error or irregularity at least three calendar days prior to the
date for which the deposition is scheduled, on the party seeking to take the
deposition and any other attorney or party on whom the deposition notice was
served.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2025.410(a).)
“A meet and confer declaration in support of
a motion shall state facts showing a reasonable and good faith attempt at an
informal resolution of each issue presented by the motion.” (Code Civ. Proc. §
2016.040.)
A court shall impose monetary sanctions in
favor of the moving party if the motion to compel is granted, unless “the one
subject to sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust. (Code. Civ. Proc., §
2025.450(g)(1).)
Discussion
Defendant
seeks an order compelling Plaintiff Johnish Harrison to appear for deposition
under Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.450.
 
However,
Defendant’s motion is untimely. A motion to compel deposition needs to be
served and filed 16 court days before the hearing. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1005.) For
a hearing on December 19, 2024, the deadline to serve and file was November 25;
Defendant served and filed on November 27. Further, an additional two days for
served would be necessary as the motion was electronically served. (Code Civ.
Proc. § 1010.6.)
 
Accordingly,
Defendant’s motion to compel the deposition of Johnish Harrison is DENIED
WITHOUT PREJUDICE.
 
Conclusion
 
The Court
DENIES WITHOUT PREJUDICE the motion to compel Plaintiff Johnish Harrison’s
deposition filed by Defendant Jacqueline Tuggle. 
 
Moving party is ORDERED to give notice.
