22STCV29482
Plaintiff’s Motion to Set Aside Dismissal 
 
Tentative
 
The motion is
denied without prejudice on procedural grounds.
 
Background
On September 9, 2022, MD Alam (“Plaintiff”) filed a
complaint against Aroldo Barrientos (“Defendant”) for general negligence and
motor vehicle negligence causes of action arising out of an automobile accident
occurring on March 10, 2022.
 
On September 9, 2024, the Court dismissed this matter
based on Plaintiff’s non-appearance for the order to show cause hearing
regarding dismissal for failure to file proof of service. 
 
Defendant has yet to appear in this matter.


On November 26,
2024, Plaintiff filed a motion to set aside the dismissal. No opposition has
been filed.
Legal Standard
Code of Civil Procedure § 473(b) provides for mandatory and
discretionary relief from dismissal. “The court may, upon any terms as may be
just, relieve a party or his or her legal representative from a judgment,
dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken against him through his or her
mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.” Code of Civil Procedure
§ 473(b). Where such an application for discretionary relief is made, the
motion shall be accompanied by a copy of the answer or pleading proposed to be
filed, or the application will not be granted. (Id.) The court must
grant relief from dismissal where the application is accompanied by an attorney
affidavit attesting to his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect.
(Id.) In either case, the application must be made within a reasonable
time, and in no case exceeding six months after the judgment. (Id.) 
Discussion
The Court must deny this motion, without prejudice, on
procedural grounds.  
 
Motions must be filed at least 16 court days before the
hearing. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1005.)  for
a hearing on December 19, 2024, the motion must be filed by no later than
November 25, 2024.
 
This motion was filed on November 26, 2024.
 
Conclusion
 
The Court DENIES, without prejudice, Plaintiff’s motion
to set aside the September 9, 2024 Dismissal. 
 
Moving Party is to give notice.
