And here is a summary in English text:

The judge has denied the defendants' motion to continue the trial, which is currently set for March 3, 2025. The defendants had requested the continuance to accommodate a motion for summary judgment that is set to be heard on March 28, 2025. However, the motion was filed and served late, and the judge has ruled that the defendants do not have the right to have the motion heard before trial. The judge has also considered the factors set forth in California Rules of Court, rule 3.1332, and has determined that the request for a continuance is not justified.
