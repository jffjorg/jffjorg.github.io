And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to set aside the dismissal without prejudice on procedural grounds. The plaintiff filed a complaint against the defendant for general negligence and motor vehicle negligence, but failed to appear for an order to show cause hearing, resulting in the dismissal of the matter. The plaintiff then filed a motion to set aside the dismissal, which was filed one day late. The judge cited Code of Civil Procedure § 1005, which requires motions to be filed at least 16 court days before the hearing, and denied the motion as a result. The plaintiff is allowed to re-file the motion at a later time.
