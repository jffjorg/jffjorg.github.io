And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge regarding a hearing set for December 19, 2024. The case is 22STCV16423, involving plaintiffs Ilsa Miranda, Bryan Miranda, and Erick Ojeda, against defendant Vardui Melkonian. The plaintiffs filed a complaint on May 17, 2022, and the defendant filed an answer on October 4, 2023. The plaintiffs amended their complaint several times, and the defendant filed a cross-complaint, which was later dismissed.

The defendant filed three discovery motions on November 12, 2024, seeking to compel the plaintiff Erick Ojeda to respond to form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and requests for production. The defendant also sought sanctions for the plaintiff's failure to respond. The plaintiff has not opposed the motions.

The judge grants the defendant's motions to compel the plaintiff to respond to the discovery requests, and orders the plaintiff to serve written, code-compliant, verified responses within 10 days of notice. The judge denies the defendant's requests for sanctions, as the plaintiff has not opposed the motions.

The court's findings are based on California Code of Civil Procedure sections 2030.260, 2030.290, 2031.260, and 2031.300, as well as California Rules of Court and case law.
