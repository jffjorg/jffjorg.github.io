23STCV06174
Motion to Compel Deposition of Plaintiff
Tentative
The motion is GRANTED; sanctions are granted
in part.
Background
On March 21, 2023, Brianna Acosta, a minor by and through
her Guardian Ad Litem Maria Acosta (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Los
Angeles Unified School District, Los Angeles Office of Education, Couty of Los
Angeles, City of Los Angles, California Department of Education, and State of
California for premises liability cause of action arising out of a
slipping/tripping incident occurring on April 7, 2022.
 
On October 3, 2023, Los Angeles Office of Education was
dismissed. On October 6, 2023, County of Los Angeles was dismissed. On October
23, 2023, City of Los Angeles was dismissed. 
 
On October 10, 2023, Los Angeles Unified School District
(“Defendant”) filed its answer.
 
On November 12, 2024, Defendant filed the motion to
compel the deposition of Plaintiff. No opposition has been filed.
 
While this litigation has been pending, Plaintiff reached
the age of majority.
 
Legal Standard
“Any
party may obtain discovery … by taking in California the oral deposition of any
person, including any party to the action.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.010.) 
Code of Civil Procedure sections 2025.210 through 2025.280 provide the
requirements for (among other things) what must be included in a deposition
notice, when and where depositions may be taken, and how and when the notice
must be served.  
“The
service of a deposition notice … is effective to require any deponent who is a
party to the action … to attend and to testify, as well as to produce any
document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing for inspection
and copying.”  (Id., § 2025.280,
subd. (a).)
Section
2025.410, subdivision (a), requires any party to serve a written objection at
least three days before the deposition if the party contends that a deposition
notice does not comply with the provisions of sections 2025.210 through
2025.280.
Section
2025.450, subdivision (a), provides:
“If,
after service of a deposition notice, a party to the action or an officer,
director, managing agent, or employee of a party, or a person designated by an organization
that is a party under Section 2025.230, without
having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails to appear for
examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for¿inspection any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the
deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move for an order compelling
the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the production for inspection of
any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in
the deposition notice.”  
Any
such motion to compel must show good cause for the production of documents and,
when a deponent has failed to appear, the motion must be accompanied “by a
declaration stating that the petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire
about the nonappearance.”  (Id.,
subd. (b).)  
When
a motion to compel is granted, “the court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) in favor of the party who noticed
the deposition and against the deponent or the party with whom the deponent is
affiliated, unless the court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust.”  (Id., § 2025.450, subd. (g)(1).) 
In Chapter 7 of
the Civil Discovery Act, section 2023.010, subdivision (d), defines “[m]isuses
of the discovery process” to include “[f]ailing to respond to or to submit to
an authorized method of discovery.” 
Where a party or attorney has engaged in misuse of the discovery
process, the court may impose a monetary sanction in the amount of “the
reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result
of that conduct.”  (Id., § 2023.030,
subd. (a).)
Discussion
Defendant
seeks an order compelling Plaintiff to appear for deposition under Code of
Civil Procedure section 2025.450.
 
On October
23, 2024, Defendant noticed Plaintiff’s deposition for November 6, 2024. (Miller
Decl., ¶ 3.) On the day of the deposition, Plaintiff’s counsel notified
Defendant Plaintiff would not appear; a notice of non-appearance was taken. (Id.,
¶¶ 4, 5.) Defense counsel followed up with Plaintiff’s counsel regarding the
deposition on November 6; Plaintiff’s counsel stated Defendant would need to
file a motion to compel. (Id., ¶ 6.) 
 
All
substantive and procedural requirements for the motion are satisfied.  Defendant noticed the deposition of
Plaintiff, and Plaintiff neither objected nor appeared.  The motion is granted.
 
The request
for sanctions is also granted.  Plaintiff
has not acted with substantial justification, and the imposition of sanctions
would not be unjust.
 
The
Court sets sanctions in the amount of $937.13, calculated based on 1.5 hours of
attorney time, multiplied by counsel’s billing rate of $250 per hour, plus $562.13
in court reporter costs. 
 
Conclusion
 
The Court
GRANTS Defendant’s motion to compel Plaintiff Brianna Acosta to appear for deposition.
 
The Court
ORDERS Plaintiff Brianna Acosta to appear for deposition and to answer
questions under oath on January __, 2025, at 10:00 am, at the Los Angeles Unified
School District Office of General Counsel, 333 South Beaudry Avenue, 20th
Floor, Los Angeles, California 90017.
 
The
Court GRANTS IN PART Defendant’s request for sanctions.
 
The
Court ORDERS Plaintiff Brianna Acosta to pay monetary sanctions under the Civil
Discovery Act in the amount of $937.13 to Defendant (through counsel) within 30
days of notice.
 
Moving party is ORDERED to give notice.
