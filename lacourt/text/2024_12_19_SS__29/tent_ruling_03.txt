21STCV40418
Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Defendant Samantha Sachs’ Responses to
Supplemental Request for Production of Documents 
Tentative
The motion is DENIED AS MOOT. Request for
sanctions denied.
Background 
On November 3, 2021, Yvonne Nesby
(“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Defendants Samantha Sachs and Teri
Sachs (collectively “Defendants”) for motor vehicle negligence cause of action
arising out of an automobile accident occurring on November 17, 2019.
Defendants filed an answer on July 21, 2022.
On November 25, 2024, Plaintiff filed
a motion to compel Defendant Samantha Sachs’ responses to supplemental Request
for Production of Documents. Defendant Samantha Sachs filed an opposition on
December 9. No reply has been filed.
 
Legal Standard
A party must
respond to requests for production of documents within 30 days after service.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260, subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests for
production of documents are directed does not provide timely responses, the
requesting party may move for an order compelling response to the demand. (Id.,
§ 2031.300, subd. (b).) There is no time limit for a motion to compel initial
responses, and no meet and confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2031.300;
Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007)
148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules
of Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In
addition, a party who fails to provide a timely response generally waives all
objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.300, subd. (a).) 
“In addition to
the demands for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling permitted by this
chapter, a party may propound a supplemental demand to inspect, copy, test, or
sample any later acquired or discovered documents, tangible things, land or
other property, or electronically stored information in the possession,
custody, or control of the party on whom the demand is made.” (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2031.050, subd. (a).)
When a party
moves to compel initial responses to requests for production, “the court shall
impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010)
against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the
motion], unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2031.300, subd. (c).) 
In Chapter 7 of
the Civil Discovery Act, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010, subdivision
(d), defines “[m]isuses of the discovery process” to include “[f]ailing to
respond to or to submit to an authorized method of discovery.”  Where a party or attorney has engaged in
misuse of the discovery process, the court may impose a monetary sanction in
the amount of “the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by
anyone as a result of that conduct.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.020, subd. (a).)
"Except as
otherwise provided in this chapter, any party shall be entitled as a matter of
right to complete discovery proceedings on or before the 30th day, and to have
motions concerning discovery heard on or before the 15th day, before the date
initially set for the trial of the action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2024.020, subd.
(a).) 
Discussion
Plaintiff moves
for an order compelling Defendant Samantha Sachs to respond to Supplemental
Request for Production of Documents. 
On August 22,
2024, Plaintiff propounded the written discovery in question on Defendant
Samantha Sachs. (Eiden Decl., ¶ 3.) Responses were served on November 25, 2024.
(Yoakum Decl., ¶ 3.) 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s
motion for an order compelling response to Supplemental Request for Production
of Documents is DENIED AS MOOT. 
As for sanctions, in the chapter of the Civil Discovery Act governing
requests for production, the Legislature has authorized sanctions in the
context of a motion to compel initial responses “against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes” the motion to compel.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (c).) As the motion is denied as moot, Defendant
has not unsuccessfully opposed the motion.
Conclusion
The
Court DENIES AS MOOT the motion to compel Defendant Samantha Sachs’ responses
to Supplemental Request for Production of Documents. 
 
The
Court DENIES the request for sanctions.
 
Moving Party is to
provide notice.
