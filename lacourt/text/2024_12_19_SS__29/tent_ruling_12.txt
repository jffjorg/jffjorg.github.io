(“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Nailington Corp., Doe 1 Cosmetologists
and Does 2 to 20 for general negligence arising out of chemical burns and

On November 20, 2023, Nailington
Corp. (“Defendant”) filed an answer.

Legal Standard
When a plaintiff fails to obey an order compelling answers to
interrogatories, “the court may make those orders that
are just, including the imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction,
or a terminating sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010).  In lieu of or in addition to,
that sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (c).)
When a plaintiff fails to obey an order compelling responses to
requests for production, “the court may
make those orders that are just, including the imposition of an issue sanction,
an evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing
with Section 2023.010).  In lieu of or in
addition to, that sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7.”  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.300, subd. (c).)
In Chapter 7 of the Civil Discovery Act, section 2023.030 provides
for monetary, evidence, issue, and terminating sanctions for any “misuse of the
discovery process,” “[t]o the extent authorized by the chapter governing any
particular discovery method or any other provision of this title.”  A “misuse of
the discovery process” is defined to include (among other things) failing to
respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery; making, without
substantial justification, an unmeritorious objection to discovery; making an
evasive response to a discovery request; disobeying a court order to provide
discovery; and making or opposing, unsuccessfully, a motion to compel without
substantial justification. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subds. (d)-(h).)
The Civil Discovery Act provides for an escalating and
“incremental approach to discovery sanctions, starting with monetary sanctions
and ending with the ultimate sanction of termination.” (Lopez v. Watchtower
Bible & Tract Society of New York, Inc. (2016) 246 Cal.App.4th
566, 604.) Discovery sanctions should be appropriate to and commensurate
with the misconduct, and they “should not exceed that which is required to
protect the interests of the party entitled to but denied discovery.” (Doppes
v. Bentley Motors, Inc. (2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 967, 992.) “If a lesser
sanction fails to curb misuse, a greater sanction is warranted: continuing
misuses of the discovery process warrant incrementally harsher sanctions until
the sanction is reached that will curb the abuse.” (Ibid.; see also,
e.g., Mileikowsky v. Tenet Healthsystem (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th
262, 279-280.) 
Terminating sanctions should be used sparingly. (Doppes, supra, 174
Cal.App.4th at p. 992; R.S. Creative, Inc. v. Creative Cotton, Ltd. (1999)
75 Cal. App. 4th 486, 496.) “Although in extreme cases a court has the
authority to order a terminating sanction as a first measure, a terminating
sanction should generally not be imposed until the court has attempted less
severe alternatives and found them to be unsuccessful and/or the record clearly
shows lesser sanctions would be ineffective.” (Lopez, supra, 246
Cal.App.4th at p. 604.)  But where discovery violations are
“willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less
severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the
trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction.” (Doppes, supra, 174
Cal.App.4th at p. 992.) Repeated and willful violations of discovery orders
that prejudice the opposing party may warrant a terminating sanction. (Creed-21
v. City of Wildomar (2017) 18 Cal.App.5th 690, 702; Los
Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 377, 390; Biles
v. Exxon Mobil Corp. (2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1327; Lang v.
Hachman (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 1225, 1246; Collisson X Kaplan
v. Hartunian (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 1611, 1617-1622.)
The
primary purpose of discovery sanctions is to obtain compliance with the Civil
Discovery Act and the Court’s orders. It is not to punish. (Newland v.
Super. Ct. (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 608, 613; Ghanooni v. Super
Shuttle of Los Angeles (1993) 20 Cal.App.4th 256, 262.) A discovery
sanction should not create a “windfall” for a party or place a party in a
better position than it would have been if the opposing party had simply
complied with its obligations under the Court’s orders and the Civil Discovery
Act. (Rutledge v. Hewlett-Packard Co. (2015) 238 Cal.App.4th 1164,
1194; see also 2 Weil & Brown, California Practice Guide: Civil Procedure
Before Trial (The Rutter Group 2023), ¶¶ 8:2214-2220.)
A
“terminating sanction issued solely because of a failure to pay a monetary
discovery sanction is never justified.” 
(Newland, supra, 40 Cal.App.4th at p. 615.) 
Discussion
On June
12, 2024, the Court granted Plaintiff’s discovery motions and ordered Defendant
to respond to Plaintiff’s form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and
requests for production within 45 days of notice.  Plaintiff gave notice on June 18, 2024.
Defendant
did not comply with the Court’s order. 
(Rosenberg Decl., ¶ 5.)
Plaintiff
now seeks terminating sanctions for Defendant’s failure to follow the Court’s order
and failure to provide code-compliant, verified responses to written discovery.

For terminating sanctions, a party must
present evidence of repeated and willful misuse of the discovery process, as
well as evidence that less severe sanctions have
not (or likely will not) lead to compliance with the discovery rules.  Plaintiff has not, on this record at this
time, made such a showing.  There has not been a showing of a history or pattern of
willful abuse or repeated violations that have not been (or cannot be) cured by
lesser sanctions. 
Moreover, a discovery sanction should not
create a “windfall” for a party or place a party in a better position than it
would have been if the opposing party had simply complied with its obligations
under the Court’s orders and the Civil Discovery Act. (Rutledge, supra, 238
Cal.App.4th at p. 1194.)  
Here, at this time, a terminating sanction
would create such a windfall for Plaintiff. 
Second, Plaintiff requests, as issue
sanctions, that the Court find and declare that Defendant was negligent toward
Plaintiff as alleged in the complaint, and that Plaintiff sustained injuries as
the proximate result of Defendant’s negligence. The Court finds that these requested
issue sanctions would also provide a windfall to Plaintiff.
Third, Plaintiff requests evidentiary
sanctions establishing that (1) Defendant has no facts to supports its denial
of negligence or any affirmative defense, and (2) Defendant has no facts to
support that Plaintiff’s injuries were caused by any other person or party
other than Defendant and its agents/employees. 
These requests are granted in part.
Defendant has engaged in serious discovery
abuse.  Defendant has failed to comply
with its obligations under the Civil Discovery Act to respond to discovery
propounded more than one year ago.  Defendant
has failed to comply with a court order requiring it to respond to the
discovery by early August 2024 – more than four months ago.  Defendant’s misuse of the discovery process
has caused substantial prejudice to Plaintiff, as trial is scheduled to begin
in approximately five weeks.  Serious
sanctions are warranted for this serious misconduct by Defendant
As an evidence sanction, the Court rules as
follows: Defendant is precluded from presenting evidence, at or before trial:
(1) to support any of the affirmative defenses set forth in its Answer or (2)
to support any contention that any of Plaintiff’s injuries were caused by the
negligent or otherwise wrongful conduct of any third party.
In addition, the Court grants in part
Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions, as Defendant’s misuse of the
discovery process has caused Plaintiff to incur unnecessary costs, including
those associated with this motion.
The Court sets monetary sanctions in the
amount of $1,310, calculated based on 2.5 hours of attorney time, multiplied by
counsel’s reasonable billing rate of $500 per hour, plus a $60 filing fee.  (See Rosenberg Decl., ¶¶ 7-8.)
Conclusion
The Court GRANTS IN PART and DENIES IN PART Plaintiff’s
motion.
The Court DENIES the requests for terminating
and issue sanctions.
The Court GRANTS IN PART the request for evidence
sanctions.
The Court ORDERS that Defendant
is PRECLUDED from presenting evidence, at or before trial: (1) to support any of
the affirmative defenses set forth in its Answer or (2) to support any contention
that any of Plaintiff’s injuries were caused by the negligent or otherwise wrongful
conduct of any third party.
The Court GRANTS IN PART the request for
monetary sanctions.
The Court ORDERS Defendant Nailington Corp.
and its attorney of record Kevin A. Gordon, Esq., jointly and severally, to pay
monetary sanctions under the Civil Discovery Act in the amount of $1,310 to
Plaintiff (through counsel) within 30 days of notice.
Moving
Party is ordered to give notice.
