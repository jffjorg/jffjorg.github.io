21STCV11173
Motion for Summary Judgment filed by Defendant 940 Figueroa, LLC.
Tentative
The Motion for Summary Judgment filed by Defendant
940 Figueroa, LLC is GRANTED.
Background
On March 23, 2021, Jeconiah Ethridge
(“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against City of Los Angeles (“City”), County of
Los Angeles (“County”), Los Angeles Department of Water & Power (“LADWP”),
Southern California Edison (“Edison”), and Does 1 through 50, asserting causes
of action for premises liability and general negligence arising out of an
incident on April 17, 2020, in which, Plaintiff alleges, she stepped on an
exposed pothole or a broken or deteriorating sidewalk, tripped, fell, and was
injured.
On January 20, 2022, County filed an answer.
In February and March 2022, the Court, at the
request of Plaintiff, dismissed all causes of action against County and Edison.
On February 22, 2022, City, for itself and
acting through and by LADWP, filed an answer. City also filed a cross-complaint
against Roes 1 through 10.
On March 11, 2022, Plaintiff amended the
complaint to name 940 Figueroa, LLC (“Figueroa”) as Doe 1.
On October 12, 2022, Figueroa filed an answer
to the complaint. The same day, Figueroa also filed a cross-complaint against
Roes 1 through 100.
On December 4, 2023, Plaintiff amended the
complaint to name Pacific Bell Telephone Company (“Pacific Bell”) as Doe 2. The
Court, at the request of Plaintiff, dismissed all causes of action against
Pacific Bell on April 18, 2024.
On August 2 and September 6 and 10, 2024,
Plaintiff amended the complaint to name “Charter Communications and Frontier”
as Doe 3, to name “Frontier” as Doe 4, and to correct the name of Doe 3 to
“Charter Communications.”
On October 23, 2024, Frontier California, Inc.
(erroneously sued as Doe 3/Charter Communications and Frontier) filed an answer
to the complaint and a cross-complaint against Roes 101 through 125. 
On December 18, 2024, Spectrum Pacific West LLC
(erroneously sued as Charter Communications) filed an answer to the complaint.
As it relates to the matter on calendar for
December 19, Figueroa filed this motion for summary judgment on May 14, 2024. The
motion was initially set to be heard on July 30, 2024. Plaintiff filed an
opposition on July 16, and Figueroa filed a reply on July 24. 
In the wake of a cyberattack on the Los Angeles
County Superior Court, the hearing on the motion was continued to September 24,
2024. On September 24, the Court granted the request of Plaintiff for a continuance
of the hearing under Code of Civil Procedure section 437c, subdivision (h). 
Plaintiff filed a further opposition on
December 5. Figueroa filed a further reply on December 13.
Legal
Standard
“The
purpose of the law of summary judgment is to provide courts with a mechanism to
cut through the parties’ pleadings in order to determine whether, despite their
allegations, trial is in fact necessary to resolve their dispute.” (Aguilar
v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.) Code of Civil
Procedure section 437c, subdivision (c), “requires the trial judge to grant
summary judgment if all the evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably
deducible from the evidence’ and uncontradicted by other inferences or
evidence, show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that
the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” (Adler v.
Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.) “The function of
the pleadings in a motion for summary judgment is to delimit the scope of the
issues; the function of the affidavits or declarations is to disclose whether
there is any triable issue of fact within the issues delimited by the
pleadings.” (Juge v. County of Sacramento (1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 59, 67, citing
FPI Development, Inc. v. Nakashima (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 367, 381-382.)
As to
each cause of action as framed by the complaint, a defendant moving for summary
judgment or summary adjudication must satisfy the initial burden of proof by
presenting facts to show “that one or more elements of the cause of action ...
cannot be established, or that there is a complete defense to the cause of
action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2); see also Aguilar, supra,
25 Cal.4th at pp. 850-851; Scalf v. D. B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th
1510, 1520.) Once the defendant has met that burden, the burden shifts to the
plaintiff to show that a “triable issue of one or more material facts exists as
to the cause of action or a defense thereto.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd.
(p)(2); see also Aguilar, supra, 25 Cal.4th at pp. 850-851.)
A
plaintiff or cross-complainant moving for summary judgment or summary
adjudication must satisfy the initial burden of proof by presenting facts to
show “that there is no defense to a cause of action if that party has proved
each element of the cause of action entitling the party to judgment on the
cause of action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(1).) Once the plaintiff
or cross-complainant has met that burden, the burden shift to the defendant or
cross-defendant to show that a “triable issue of one or more material facts
exists as to the cause of action or a defense thereto.” (Ibid.)
The
party opposing a motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication may not
simply “rely upon the allegations or denials of its pleadings” but must instead
“set forth the specific facts showing that a triable issue of material fact
exists.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subds. (p)(1) & (p)(2). To establish a
triable issue of material fact, the party opposing the motion must produce
substantial responsive evidence. (Sangster v. Paetkau (1998) 68
Cal.App.4th 151, 166.)
Courts
“liberally construe the evidence in support of the party opposing summary
judgment and resolve doubts concerning the evidence in favor of that party.” (Dore
v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc. (2006) 39 Cal.4th 384, 389.)
Objections
to Evidence
Each party objects to some of the
evidence submitted by the other. Evidence presented in support of, or in
opposition to, a motion for summary judgment must be admissible. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 437c, subd. (d); Perry v.
Bakewell Hawthorne LLC (2017) 2
Cal.5th 536, 541-43.) 
The Court must “consider all of the evidence set forth in the papers,
except the evidence to which objections have been made and sustained.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (c).)
Plaintiff
asserts 6 objections to the declaration of Val Muraoka. The objections are
OVERRULED.
Figueroa
asserts 22 objections to Plaintiff’s evidence. The objections are OVERRULED.
The Court notes, however, that discovery responses of parties other than
Figueroa are not treated as admissions by Figueroa. 
Figueroa
also asserts objections to Plaintiff’s separate statement. The objections are
OVERRULED. The Court makes its ruling based on the evidence, not based on any
parties’ characterization of the evidence.
Discussion
On
April 17, 2020, Plaintiff was standing next to a food truck located in front of
940 S. Figueroa Street in Los Angeles, the building owned by Figueroa. (Defendant’s
Statement of Undisputed Material Facts [“DSUMF”], Nos. 1-3.) When Plaintiff
stepped out of the way of a passing bicycle, she stepped into a hold and was
injured. (DSUMF, Nos. 4-5.)
In the
Complaint, Plaintiff asserts causes of action for premises liability and
negligence against Figueroa. The basic elements of a cause of action for
negligence and premises liability are the same: (1) the existence of a
legal duty; (2) breach of that duty; (3) causation; and
(4) resulting damages. (Brown v. USA Taekwondo (2021) 11
Cal.5th 204, 213; Kesner v. Superior Court (2016) 1 Cal.5th
1132, 1158; Castellon v. U.S. Bancorp (2013) 220 Cal.App.4th
994, 998.) The existence and scope of duty are legal questions for the
court. (Brown, supra, 11 Cal.5th at p. 213; Annocki v.
Peterson Enterprises, LLC (2014) 232 Cal.App.4th 32, 36.)
Figueroa
moves for summary judgment under the Sidewalk Accident Doctrine. Figueroa
argues that it is a private owner of property abutting the sidewalk on which
the accident occurred: absent evidence that it owned, controlled, or maintained
the sidewalk, Figueroa argues, it did not owe a duty of care to Plaintiff or
other members of the public who used the sidewalk.
The general rule
governing duty is set forth in Civil Code section 1714: “Everyone is
responsible, not only for the result of his or her willful acts, but also for
an injury occasioned to another by his or her want of ordinary care or skill in
the management of his or her property or person, except so far as the latter
has, willfully or by want of ordinary care, brought the injury upon himself or
herself.” (Civ. Code, § 1714, subd. (a).) This establishes what the California
Supreme Court has described as the “default rule” that every person has a legal
duty “to exercise, in his or her activities, reasonable care for the safety of
others.” (Brown, supra, 11 Cal.5th at p. 214.)
Those
who own, possess, or control property generally have a duty to exercise
ordinary care in managing the property to avoid exposing others to an
unreasonable risk of harm. (Annocki v. Peterson Enterprises, LLC (2014)
232 Cal.App.4th 32, 37.) If a dangerous condition exists, the property owner is “under a
duty to exercise ordinary care either to make the condition reasonably safe … or
to give a warning adequate to enable [others] to avoid the harm.” (Bridgman
v. Safeway Stores, Inc. (1960) 53 Cal.2d 443, 446.)
The
law regarding the liability of landowners with regard to defects or dangerous
conditions on sidewalks abutting their property is well established in numerous
appellate cases. “Under
the common law, a landowner does not have any duty to repair abutting sidewalks
along a public street, and does not owe any duty to pedestrians injured as a
result of a defect in the sidewalks.” (Jordan v. City of Sacramento
(2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 1487, 1490 (citing Schaefer v. Lenahan (1944) 63
Cal.App.2d 324, 325).) By statute, specifically Streets and Highways Code
section 5610, abutting property owners have an obligation to repair defects in
the sidewalk, regardless of whether they created the defects. (See Jones v.
Deeter (1984) 152 Cal.App.3d 798, 803.) Nonetheless, the so-called
“Sidewalk Accident Doctrine” provides that abutting property owners have no
duty to members of the public in tort law, and are not liable to members of the
public, unless the property owner created the defect or exercised dominion or
control over the abutting sidewalk. (Lopez v. City of Los Angeles (2020)
55 Cal.App.5th 244, 255; Jordan, supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1490-91
[Section 5610 “imposes a duty of repair on the abutting property owners for
defects in sidewalks, regardless of who created the defects, but does not of
itself create tort liability to injured pedestrians or a duty to indemnify
municipalities, except where a property owner created the defect or exercised
dominion or control over the abutting sidewalk”]; see also Contreras v.
Anderson (1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 188, 196; Jones, supra, 152
Cal.App.3d at pp. 802-803.)  
Thus, for more than 150 years the general rule has been that “in
the absence of a statute, a landowner is under no duty to maintain in a safe
condition a public street or sidewalk abutting his property.” (Lopez, supra,
55 Cal.App.5th at p. 255.) “[A] person’s ownership or occupancy of property,
without more, is insufficient to impose a duty to maintain abutting, publicly
owned property. (Id. at p. 256; see also Isaacs v.
Huntington Memorial Hospital (1985) 38 Cal.3d 112, 134 [“A defendant
cannot be held liable for the defective or dangerous condition of property
which it did not own, possess, or control.”]; Williams v. Foster (1989) 216
Cal.App.3d 510, 521 [“we are unwilling to find the duty to maintain the
sidewalk established by section 5610 is owed to members of the public in the
absence of clear and unambiguous legislative language, especially in view of
the long-standing judicial determination that abutters ordinarily have no such
duty”].) 
This general
rule of no duty has an important exception: when the abutting property owner
has “exercised control” over the otherwise public property. (Lopez, supra,
55 Cal.App.5th at p. 255.) For this exception to apply, the abutting owner must
take some affirmative action regarding the public property, such as when the
abutting owner has created the hazard or asserted “dominion and control over
the … publicly owned property by effectively treating the property as its own.”
(Id. at p. 256.)
Along with its
moving papers, Figueroa presents the declaration of Val Muraoka, director of
Asset Management for Robhana Management, Inc., Figueroa’s authorized agent.
Muraoka testifies that Figueroa did not own, lease, occupy, or control the
sidewalk. (Muraoka Decl., ¶ 2.) Further, Muraoka testifies that Figueroa did
not alter or repair the sidewalk, or create the alleged defect in the sidewalk
that is at issue in this action. (Id., ¶¶ 4-5.)
With this
evidence, Figueroa meets its initial burden, as a defendant moving for summary
judgment, of showing that an element of Plaintiff’s causes of action (duty)
cannot be established. (See Code
Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2).) This shifts the burden to Plaintiff to “set
forth the specific facts showing that a triable issue of material fact exists.”
(Ibid.) 
The Court
has considered all of the evidence submitted by Plaintiff and concludes that Plaintiff
has not met this burden.
Plaintiff
relies, in part, on Figueroa’s discovery response in which Figueroa states that
it maintains the property “in a reasonable and safe condition” and that an
engineer, property manager, and security company inspect the property. (Fradkin
Decl., Exh. A.) And Muraoka, in her deposition, also testified that Figueroa regularly
inspects the interior and exterior of the building. (Fradkin Decl., Exh. E.) This
is not evidence that Figueroa exercised control over the public sidewalk
abutting its property.
Plaintiff cites
to the discovery responses of City. (Fradkin
Decl., Exhs. C & D.) But City’s statements of its
contentions and its legal theories with regard to the duties of an abutting
property owner (even assuming that they are admissible as against Figueroa) are
not evidence and are not “specific facts showing that a triable issue of
material fact exists.”   
Plaintiff also
relies on the declaration of its expert witness, Eris J. Barillas. Her
testimony, however, focuses on the allegedly dangerous condition of the
sidewalk. (Barillas Decl., ¶¶ 8-11, 15.) Barillas opines that Figueroa, as
the abutting property owner, had a duty to inspect the sidewalk; that Figueroa knew
or should have known of the dangerous condition; that Figueroa had a duty to maintain
the sidewalk in a reasonably safe condition; and that Figueroa could have and
should have mitigated the safety hazard. (Id., ¶¶ 12-14, 16.) The law,
as set forth above, is to the contrary as it relates to the duties and
obligations of an owner of abutting property – absent evidence that the
property owner exercised control over the sidewalk, which Barillas does not
provide.
The Court has
considered the evidence in the record and the argument of both sides.  Viewing the evidence in the light most
favorable to the Plaintiff, and drawing all reasonable inference in her favor,
the Court concludes that Figueroa has shown as a matter of law that it did not create
the dangerous condition and did not own, possess, control, or exercise dominion
over the public sidewalk abutting its property. Under the Sidewalk Accident
Doctrine, as a matter of law, Figueroa owed no duty of care to Plaintiff and
other members of the public.
Accordingly, the
motion for summary judgment is granted. 
Conclusion
The Court GRANTS the motion for summary
judgment filed by Defendant 940 Figueroa, LLC.
Moving party is ordered to give notice.
