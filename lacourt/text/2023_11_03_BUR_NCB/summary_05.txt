And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling in the case of Rashyn R. Reynolds v. Hillsides and Dr. Kimberly Charlton. The case involves a claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress by Hillsides against Reynolds. Hillsides filed a demurrer to the complaint, arguing that it did not engage in extreme and outrageous conduct, and that the complaint lacks sufficient facts to support a claim of IIED. The judge has sustained the demurrer with leave to amend, meaning that Reynolds has 20 days to revise the complaint to include more specific allegations of Hillsides' conduct. The judge has also denied Hillsides' request to dismiss the action, as Reynolds has not yet had the opportunity to appear at the next Case Management Conference.
