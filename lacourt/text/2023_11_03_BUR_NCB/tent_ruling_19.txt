In paragraph
44(b), Plaintiff alleges that Defendant Santopietro changed the locks on the
property, preventing Plaintiff from entering the property which she claims
constituted fraudulent conduct so that Defendant Santopietro could sell the
property.  However, it is unclear how
this constitutes fraudulent conduct. 
Nevertheless, there is at least one viable basis for this cause of
action to go forward.
