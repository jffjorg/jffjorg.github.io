 [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
motion to compel vehicle inspection 



 
 
BACKGROUND
A.    Allegations 
Plaintiff Juan Chavarria (“Plaintiff”) alleges
that he purchased a 2019 Honda Accord on November 15, 2019, which was
manufactured and/or distributed by Defendant American Honda Motor Company, Inc.
(“Defendant”).  Plaintiff alleges that he
took possession of the vehicle and, during the warranty period, the vehicle
contained or developed defects that impaired the use, safety, and/or value of
the vehicle.  Plaintiff alleges that the
vehicle had a defective engine, lighting system, body system, ignition system,
mechanical system, and other complaints. 
(Compl., ¶12.)  
 
The complaint, filed February 8, 2022, alleges causes of action for: (1)
violation of Civil Code, § 1793.2(d); (2) violation of Civil Code, § 1793.2(b);
(3) violation of Civil Code, § 1793.2(a)(3); (4) breach of express written
warranty (Civil Code, §§ 1791.2(a), 1794); and (5) breach of the implied
warranty of merchantability (Civil Code, §§ 1791.1, 1794).  
B.     Motion on Calendar
On May 30, 2023, Defendant filed a motion
to compel a vehicle inspection of Plaintiff’s vehicle within 30 days of the
hearing on the motion.  
The Court is not in receipt of an
opposition brief.
On October 26, 2023, the Court held a
Final Status Conference.  At the FSC, the
Court continued the trial date from November 6, 2023 to June 17, 2024.  Pursuant to the oral stipulation of counsel, discovery
deadlines were not extended to the new trial date.  
LEGAL STANDARD
            CCP §
2031.260(a) states: “Within 30 days after service of a
demand for
inspection, copying, testing, or sampling, the party to whom the demand
is directed shall serve the original of the response to it on the party making
the demand, and a copy
of the response on all other parties who have appeared in the action, unless on
motion of the party making the demand, the court has shortened the time for response, or unless on motion of the party to whom the
demand has been directed, the court has extended the time for response.”  
            CCP §
2031.300(b) states that if a party to whom a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling
is directed fails to serve a timely response to it, the party making the demand
may move for an order compelling response to the demand.
            CCP §
2031.320(a) states that “If a party filing a response to a demand for
inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling under Sections 2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230, 2031.240, and
2031.280 thereafter fails to permit the inspection, copying, testing, or
sampling in accordance with that party's statement of compliance, the
demanding party
may move for an order compelling compliance.”  
DISCUSSION 
Defendant moves to
compel Plaintiff to produce his 2019 Honda Accord for a vehicle
inspection.  
Defense counsel,
Mahfam Sadeghi, states that Plaintiff served a demand for inspection of the
vehicle on Plaintiff on March 28, 2023, but Plaintiff did not provide any
response to the demand.  (Sadeghi Decl.,
¶¶2-3, Ex. A.)  Mr. Sadeghi states that
on April 5, 2023, he inquired from Plaintiff’s counsel about the availability
of the subject vehicle and Plaintiff’s counsel presented some inspection dates,
but Defendant’s expert had a conflict on the provided dates.  (Id., ¶4, Ex. B.)  On April 25, 2023, defense counsel again
inquired about possible dates and Plaintiff’s counsel responded that the
vehicle would not be available for inspection until September 2023 because he
had summer vacation plans.  (Id.)  
Defendant argues
that Plaintiff’s refusal to produce the subject vehicle for an inspection until
September 2023 is not justified in light of the initially set trial date of
November 6, 2023.  The Court notes that
on October 26, 2023, the trial date was continued to June 17, 2024.  However, CCP § 2024.020(a)
states: “Except as otherwise provided in this
chapter, any party shall be entitled as a matter of right to
complete discovery proceedings on or before the 30th day, and to have motions concerning discovery heard on or before the
15th day, before the date initially set for the trial of the action.”  This motion was initially set to be heard on
November 3, 2023.  At the time the trial
was continued to June 17, 2024, the parties orally stipulated not to extend
discovery deadline to the new trial date. 
As such, this motion is technically untimely as it was not reserved at
least 15 days prior to the initially set jury trial date.  Thus, the motion is
procedurally untimely and may be denied on this basis. 
However, the Court
notes that Defendant filed this motion on May 30, 2023, months prior to the
initially set trial date.  (It is unclear
why Defendant did not apply ex parte to advance the hearing date.)  Further, Plaintiff has not filed an
opposition to this motion and, based on Defendant’s representations, does not
appear to oppose producing his vehicle for inspection; rather, Plaintiff’s
counsel lacked availability to be present at the time of the inspection if it
took place during the summer.  As such, to
avoid further delays in this case and to promote the parties’ efforts to settle
the case during their private mediation, the Court will consider the
substantive merits of this motion and grant the motion so that Plaintiff is
ordered to produce the vehicle promptly for inspection.  
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
Defendant American
Honda Motor Company, Inc.’s motion to compel a vehicle inspection is granted.  The parties are ordered to meet and confer to
schedule a mutually agreeable date for the inspection of Plaintiff’s vehicle
that is subject to this action.  The
parties should agree upon a date within 30 days of this order, unless the
parties mutually agree otherwise. 
Defendant shall
provide notice of this order.
