And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to quash service of the summons and complaint. The defendant argued that he was not validly served with process because he no longer lived at the address where service was effectuated in April 2023. The judge found that the defendant had not lived at that address since October 2021 and that the process server did not attempt to serve him at his current address. The plaintiff did not oppose the motion to quash, so the motion is granted. As a result, the demurrer is taken off-calendar, and the plaintiff must effectuate service on the defendant at his new address or determine if defense counsel is willing to accept service on his behalf. The defendant may refile the demurrer once proper service has been effectuated.
