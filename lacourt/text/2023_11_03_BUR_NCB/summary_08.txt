* "The sole statutory regulation within the scheme concerning the selection of arbitrators is Code of Civil Procedure section 1281.6, which provides that courts must enforce the method of selecting arbitrators set forth in the agreement." (Khorsand v. Liberty Mutual Fire Ins. Co.)
* "The parties shall have 5 days to jointly select an appraiser. If the parties fail to select an appraiser from the list, the Court shall appoint an arbitrator from the list of nominees."
