And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has considered the motions to compel further responses filed by the Plaintiff, Yegishe Torosyan, and has granted the motions as to SROG Nos. 26-27, 29-30, 32-33, 35-36, 38-39, 41-42, 44-45, 47-48, 50-51, 53-54, 56-57, and 59-60, as well as RPD No. 32.

The Court finds that the Defendant, Adil A. Barakat, et al., failed to provide sufficient responses to the special interrogatories and requests for production of documents, and therefore, the motions to compel further responses are granted.

The Court declines to award sanctions to the Plaintiff in light of the issues related to the Plaintiff's service of the motion papers on the Defendant.

The Defendant is ordered to provide further responses within 20 days of notice of this order.
