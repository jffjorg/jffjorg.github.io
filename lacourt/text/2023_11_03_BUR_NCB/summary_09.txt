And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion to dismiss filed by Defendant Aiten Levy, arguing that the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction to hear the unlawful detainer complaint since Defendant has vacated the property and possession is no longer at issue. However, the judge finds that the motion is improper and that the action may be converted to an ordinary civil suit to determine the issue of damages. The judge denies the motion to dismiss and orders Defendant to give notice of the order. The judge also notes that leave to amend the complaint is not at issue and that the Court will not grant Plaintiff leave to amend the complaint at this time.
