And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has tentatively ruled in favor of the plaintiff, Brian Whitaker, to set aside the dismissal without prejudice of the entire action of all parties and all causes of action. The court finds that there is substantive merit to the motion and that the motion was timely brought within 6 months of the dismissal and unopposed. The court is concerned about the event that threatened the integrity of the court's electronic file and has ordered defense counsel, Manuel Eli Gonzalez, to show cause why he should not be sanctioned in an amount not to exceed $5,000 for filing the dismissal in this case without authorization. The court has set an order to show cause for December 12, 2023 at 8:30 a.m. in Department B of the court.
