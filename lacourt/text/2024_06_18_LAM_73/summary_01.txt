The judge has denied the motions to be relieved as counsel for both Dos Potrillos LLC and David Romero. The motions were filed on May 21, 2023, and the supporting declarations were also filed. However, no opposition or other response has been filed. The judge has discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw, but the motion must meet certain requirements, including notice of motion, service of the notice and declaration on all other parties, and a proposed order relieving counsel. In this case, the proposed orders were not filed. Therefore, the motions are denied.
