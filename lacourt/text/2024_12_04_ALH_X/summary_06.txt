And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion to be relieved as counsel filed by Attorney Aaron Fairchild, who represents Defendant Jason Arrow. The motion was made on the grounds that there has been a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship, making further representation untenable. The judge found good cause to grant the request and noted that Defendant Arrow will not be prejudiced by the withdrawal of counsel. The judge also ordered counsel to file proof of service of the signed order within five court days.
