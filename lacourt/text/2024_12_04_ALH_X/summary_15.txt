Summary:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling denying the Plaintiff's application for a temporary restraining order and/or preliminary injunction to prevent the foreclosure sale of his home. The Plaintiff, Yerkanyan, filed the application alleging that the Defendant, Real Time Resolutions, Inc. and MTC Financial Inc. dba Trustee Corps, cannot sell the property as their rights under the lien are extinguished and the lien is unenforceable. The Plaintiff argues that the Defendant failed to comply with the statutory requirements of Civil Code section 2923.5 and that the lien is unenforceable due to the statute of limitations under Code of Civil Procedure section 882.020. The Defendant argues that the Plaintiff has not demonstrated a reasonable likelihood of success on the merits of his claims and that the enforcement of the Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) Deed of Trust is not time-barred. The Court agrees with the Defendant's argument and finds that the Plaintiff has failed to sufficiently demonstrate some probability of success to obtain a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction.
