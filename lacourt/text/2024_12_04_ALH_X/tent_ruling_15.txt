 Case Number:  24NNCV05462    Hearing Date:   December 4, 2024    Dept:  X DEFENDANTS’ APPLICATION FOR A TRO/PRELIMINARY INJUNCTIONPlaintiff filed an ex parte application for a temporary restraining order and/or preliminary injunction to prevent the foreclosure sale of his home.This action arises out of a lien agreement between Plaintiff Yerkanyan and Countywide Bank, N.A. in the amount of $73,400 for the property located at 10914 Hillhaven Avenue, Los Angeles, California.  (Compl., ¶ 6.)  The lien agreement is attached to the complaint as Exhibit A, and the deed of trust is attached as Exhibit B.  (Compl., ¶ 7.)  The parties to the lien agreement effectuated the deed of trust for the property in the amount of $73,400.  (Ibid.)The complaint alleges Defendant Real Time Resolutions, Inc. purchased the lien held by COUNTRYWIDE BANK, N.A.  (Compl., ¶ 8.)  For the period of approximately 18 years, Real Time Resolutions, Inc. allegedly failed to send any notice of deficiencies and/or notice of transfers to Plaintiff notifying him of the transfer of the lien or that no payments were made on the lien and that Plaintiff was in default.  (Compl., ¶ 9.)  Then in 2023, Real Time Resolutions sent Plaintiff a correspondence demanding repayment for the principal balance of $73,400 along with interest.  (Compl., ¶ 10.)  Defendants Real Time Resolutions and MTC Financial Inc. dba Trustee Corps issued a Notice of Sale of the subject property claiming Plaintiff was in default under the Lien Agreement and Deed of Trust dated September 7, 2005.  (Compl., ¶ 11, Exh. C.)  The Notice of Sale regarding the property was scheduled for sale on November 5, 2024 at 10:00AM.The complaint alleges Defendants cannot sell the property as their rights under the lien are extinguished and the lien is unenforceable.  (Compl, ¶ 13.)  The complaint explains further:The LIEN AGREEMENT executed on September 8, 2005 provided that the final maturity date on the Lien Agreement is 60 months for said agreement.  (Exhibit A).  Specifically, the Lien Agreement provides in paragraph 1 that “…you agree to lend money to me from time to time until the last day of the sixtieth (60th) consecutive calendar month following the date set forth above (“Initial Draw Period”).”  (Exhibit A.)  Here, 60 consecutive months following 09/08/2005 would be September 8, 2010.  Thereby, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure §882.020 the lien expires 10 years after the September 8, 2010 date which would be September 8, 2020.(Compl., ¶ 12.)The complaint filed on October 30, 2024 alleges four causes of action: (1) violation of Code of Civil Procedure section 882.020, (2) violation of Homeowner Bill of Rights, (3) wrongful foreclosure, and (4) declaratory relief. On October 31, 2024, Plaintiff filed an ex parte application for a temporary restraining order restricting the Defendants’ November 5, 2024 sale of the subject property.  Since then, the opposition maintains that no sale took place.On December 2, 2024, the Court entered Plaintiff’s request to dismiss the cause of action for wrongful foreclosure only, leaving the three remaining causes of action pending against Defendant Real Time.Tentative RulingThe Court denies Plaintiff’s application for a temporary restraining order and/or preliminary injunction to prevent the foreclosure sale of the property pending further litigation on the merits of the case.Legal AnalysisThe court may issue a temporary restraining order to preserve the status quo or prevent irreparable harm pending the hearing of an application for preliminary injunction on notice.  (Gray v. Bybee (1943) 60 Cal.App.2d 564, 571.)  Where a temporary restraining order (“TRO”) is sought, the court may issue the TRO and at the same time order the defendant to “show cause” why a preliminary injunction should not be issued.  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1150(c).)“[T]rial courts should evaluate two interrelated factors when deciding whether or not to issue [a restraining order].  The first is the likelihood that the plaintiff will prevail on the merits at trial.¿ The second is the interim harm that the plaintiff is likely to sustain if the [restraining order] were denied as compared to the harm that the defendant is likely to suffer if the [order] were issued.”  (Church of Christ in Hollywood v. Superior Court (2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 1244, 1251.)  “The trial court’s determination must be guided by a ‘mix’ of the potential-merit and interim-harm factors; the greater the plaintiff’s showing on one, the less must be shown on the other to support [a restraining order]. . . .¿ Of course, ‘[t]he scope of available preliminary relief is necessarily limited by the scope of the relief likely to be obtained at trial on the merits.’¿ . . .¿ A trial court may not grant a [restraining order], regardless of the balance of interim harm, unless there is some possibility that the plaintiff would ultimately prevail on the merits of the claim.”¿(Id., at pp. 1251-1252.)The Court first considers Plaintiff’s likelihood of succeeding on the merits.  Plaintiff argues that Defendants’ foreclosure on the Subject Property was illegal, as Defendants did not comply with the statutory requirements of Civil Code section 2923.5.  Section 2923.5 requires a mortgage servicer, mortgagee, trustee, beneficiary, or authorized agent to “contact the borrower in person or by telephone in order to assess the borrower’s financial situation and explore options for the borrower to avoid foreclosure” before recording a notice of default.  (Civ. Code, § 2923.5.)  Plaintiff alleges that no such contact occurred as the Defendants “recorded a notice of default on the property without first contacting the Plaintiff[.]”  (Compl., ¶ 28.)  Additionally, Plaintiff attaches to the complaint the Notice of Sale.  (Compl., Exh. C.)In opposition, Defendant argues Plaintiff has not demonstrated a reasonable likelihood of success on the merits of his claims.  Defendant argues that injunctive relief is an “extraordinary and drastic remedy” that requires the moving party to show a reasonable probability of prevailing on the merits of the action and the existence of irreparable injury.  Defendant contends that Plaintiff has not demonstrated a reasonable likelihood of success on the merits of his claims, and therefore the injunctive relief should be denied.  Defendant argues that the enforcement of the Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) Deed of Trust is not time-barred under Code of Civil Procedure section 882.020(a)(2), contrary to Plaintiff’s assertion that enforcement is time-barred under section 882.020(a)(1). When a recorded deed of trust does not reflect the maturity date of the underlying promissory note, the 60-year period of Civil Code section 882.020(a)(2), applies to it, rather than the 10-year period of section 882.020(a)(1).  (Robin v. Crowell (2020) 55 Cal.App.5th 727, 750.)  Defendant argues the maturity date or last date fixed for payment is not apparent on the face of the recorded Deed of Trust (Compl., Exh. B.), so section 882.020(a)(2) applies, and the lien expires 60 years after the Deed of Trust was recorded.  Therefore, Defendant concludes the time limit in section 882.020(a)(1) is not applicable and enforcement of the HELOC Deed of Trust is not untimely.Also, Defendant contends that Plaintiff’s HBOR claims are based on the unenforceability of the HELOC Deed of Trust due to the statute of limitations, which Defendant argues is not applicable for the reasons above.  Defendant argues that Plaintiff’s claims for violations of sections 2923.55, 2924.9, and 2924.11 of the HBOR fail because those sections only apply to first lien mortgages or deeds of trust, and Plaintiff’s HELOC loan is a junior lien.  Defendant cites to Stephens v. World Sav. Bank (N.D. Cal. Feb. 22, 2013) 2013 WL 664615, *7, where the court found that the HBOR sections cited by the plaintiff did not apply to a second deed of trust.  Finally, Defendant argues that Plaintiff’s section 2924.11 claim also appears to be time-barred, as it seems to rely on conduct in 2008, and Real Time Resolutions was not involved in any modification in 2008.  Defendant further asserts section 2924.11 was not enacted and not operative in 2008.Plaintiff notes that irreparable harm exists here.  Plaintiff argues his family (his wife and two children) are at risk of homelessness, psychological and emotional damages, and disruption of family life.  There is a chance Plaintiff’s family would be without a home while the instant litigation is pending.  Meanwhile, no major hardship will befall Defendants by temporarily preventing further encumbrance on the subject property.Regarding the likelihood of success on the merits, the Court must consider the conflicting interpretations of the statute of limitations under section 882.020.  Defendant has pointed out that the Deed of Trust (Compl., Exh. B) is the pertinent document to consider under section 882.020, not the Home Equity Credit Line Agreement (Compl., Exh. A) which Plaintiff relies on to calculate the date the lien expires.  The Court agrees.  Here, the recorded HELOC Deed of Trust attached to the Complaint as Exhibit B is the security instrument for Plaintiff’s line of credit, and it does not identify a maturity date.  Thus, per Civil Code section 882.020, subdivision (a)(2), the 60-year statute of limitations applies.  Defendant’s right to conduct nonjudicial foreclosure proceedings will not expire until 60 years after the date the instrument that created the security interest was recorded (September 7, 2005), i.e., September 7, 2065. As Plaintiff has failed to sufficiently demonstrate some probability of success to obtain a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction, the Court denies Plaintiff’s application.
