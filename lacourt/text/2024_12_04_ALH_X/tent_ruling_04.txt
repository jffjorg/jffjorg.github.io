 Case Number:  23AHCV02049    Hearing Date:   December 4, 2024    Dept:  X MOTION
TO VACATE DISMISSAL (8791)

RELIEF
REQUESTED
Plaintiff moves to vacate the order of
dismissal. 
 
BACKGROUND
Plaintiff failed to appear at a hearing for an Order to Show
Cause re: Failure to File Proof of Service on November 6, 2023.  The FAC was dismissed. 
 
TENTATIVE RULING
Plaintiff’s motion
to vacate the dismissal is denied.
 
LEGAL STANDARD
Code of Civil Procedure section 473(b) provides for two
types of relief— commonly differentiated as “discretionary” and “mandatory”—
from a default.  Under the discretionary
relief provision, on a showing of mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable
neglect, the court has discretion to allow relief from default.  Under the mandatory relief provision, on the
other hand, upon a showing by attorney declaration of mistake, inadvertence,
surprise, or neglect, the court shall vacate any resulting default judgment or
dismissal entered.”  (Leader v. Health
Industries of America, Inc. (2001) 89 Cal.App.4th 603, 615-616.)  The application for relief must be made no
more than six months after entry of judgment and must be “accompanied by a copy
of the answer or other pleading proposed to be filed therein.”  (Id.)  The law strongly favors trial and disposition
on the merits.  Therefore, any doubts in
applying section 473 must be resolved in favor of the party seeking relief.  When the moving party promptly seeks relief
and there is no prejudice to the opposing party, very slight evidence is
required to justify relief.  (Mink v.
Superior Court (1992) 2 Cal.App.4th 1338, 1343.)
 
DISCUSSION
Plaintiff Jerome
Vaughn, in pro per, has filed a motion to vacate the dismissal of his case
against Defendant Monrovia Police Department, pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 473(d). 
 
On
November 6, 2023, the Court heard an Order to Show Cause Re: Failure to File
Proof of Service.  There was no
appearance by/for the plaintiff and no proof of service of the proceedings on
the named defendant. (11/6/23 Minute Order).  For plaintiff's failure to appear and for
failing to serve the complaint the Court ordered the first amended complaint
dismissed without prejudice.  (11/6/23
Minute Order.)
 
On
November 17, 2023, Plaintiff filed an amended motion to vacate order of
dismissal, which was denied on February 7, 2024. (2/7/24 Minute Order.)  On August 23, 2024, Plaintiff filed another
amended motion to vacate order of dismissal, which was denied on October 7,
2024. (10/7/24 Minute Order.)
 
Here, Plaintiff has filed
the same motion as before – to vacate the dismissal order so that the case can
be reinstated.  Dismissal of the first amended
complaint was entered on November 6, 2023, due to Plaintiff’s failure to file
the Proof of Service of the complaint on Defendant. 
 
Plaintiff’s motion
relies on the Declaration of Jerome Vaughn, but no declaration is attached to
the motion attesting to the facts asserted in the motion.  Without a declaration supporting Plaintiff’s
motion, the Court cannot consider the assertions in the motion as evidence.  As such, Plaintiff’s motion is denied.
 
CONCLUSION
Plaintiff’s motion
is denied.
