Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the motions and has denied the plaintiff's motion to compel as moot since the deposition has been completed. The request for sanctions has also been denied as the court determines that the imposition of sanctions would be unjust. The court has scheduled an informal discovery conference (IDC) for January 23, 2025, and has ordered the parties to meet and confer prior to the conference. The parties are also required to exchange certain discovery documents related to the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act.
