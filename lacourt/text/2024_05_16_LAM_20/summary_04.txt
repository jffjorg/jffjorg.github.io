And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to compel initial responses from the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs have failed to provide discovery responses, and the defendant has requested that certain information be deemed admitted. The judge has deemed admitted certain requests for admission and has ordered the plaintiffs to provide responses to the interrogatories within 30 days. The judge has also awarded sanctions in the amount of $900. The judge has strongly encouraged counsel to submit their objections to the tentative ruling through LACourtConnect rather than in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
