And here is the English-text summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge has made a tentative ruling in the case between Whitestone Builders, Inc. (Plaintiff) and Valerie Taylor and Derek Taylor (Defendants) regarding a dispute over renovations to a duplex. The Plaintiff seeks to compel further responses to special interrogatories from the Defendants and Pier Pjerin Prenga, while the Defendants seek to identify documents and individuals who possess them. The Judge finds that the objections lack merit and the supplemental responses are evasive and incomplete. The Judge grants the Motions and orders the parties to provide further responses within 30 days. The Judge declines to award sanctions and encourages counsel to submit their appearance via LACourtConnect rather than in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
