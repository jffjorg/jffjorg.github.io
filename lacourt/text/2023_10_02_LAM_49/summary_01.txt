Summary:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge Randolph M. Hammock in a case involving a motion for reconsideration of an order compelling arbitration. The Plaintiff, Juan S. Marcial, purchased a 2014 Chrysler Town and Country from Defendant Scott Robinson Chrysler Dodge Jeep Ram in 2016. Plaintiff sued Defendant for violations of the Song-Beverly Act, and Defendant moved to compel arbitration, which was granted. Plaintiff now moves for reconsideration of the order, arguing that there has been a change in law due to recent Court of Appeal decisions. The Judge denies the motion for reconsideration, finding that there has been no change in law, only a split between two Court of Appeal decisions. The Judge also finds that the arbitration provision is enforceable by the nonsignatory manufacturer.
