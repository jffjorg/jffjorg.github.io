**English Summary:**

Judge Hammock has issued a tentative ruling denying Plaintiff Juan Marcial's motion to reconsider the court's previous order compelling arbitration.  The court believes that the manufacturer, FCA US, LLC, is a valid third-party beneficiary of the arbitration provision in the sales contract, despite a recent appellate decision, *Ochoa*, which appears to contradict this. Judge Hammock suggests that the parties consider delaying the arbitration proceedings until the California Supreme Court issues a decision in *Ochoa*, which is currently under review.

Summary:
The plaintiff, Juan S. Marcial, moved for reconsideration of the court's order compelling the parties to binding arbitration. Marcial purchased a 2014 Chrysler Town and Country from the defendant, Scott Robinson Chrysler Dodge Jeep Ram, and sued the dealer and manufacturer for violations of the Song-Beverly Act. The court granted defendants' motion to compel arbitration and stayed the matter pending arbitration. Marcial now moves for reconsideration, but the motion is denied as untimely. The court suggests that the parties stipulate to stay the current arbitration proceedings pending a decision by the California Supreme Court in Ford Motor Warranty Cases (2023) 89 Cal. App. 5th 1324 (Ochoa). There has been no change in law, only a split between two separate Court of Appeal decisions. The arbitration provision is enforceable by the nonsignatory manufacturer.
