And here is the English summary:

The tentative ruling is in response to a demurrer filed by Mercedez-Benz USA, LLC (Defendant) to the complaint filed by Jin Young Kim (Plaintiff). The court granted the demurrer, but with leave to amend, meaning the Plaintiff has 30 days to revise the complaint. The court found that the Defendant did not comply with the meet and confer requirement before filing the demurrer, despite sending an email at 9:02 pm and filing the demurrer at 9:11 pm the same evening. The court also found that the complaint was uncertain and lacked reasonable particularity in its allegations. The court ordered the defendant to give notice of the demurrer and provided guidance on how to revise the complaint to address the issues raised.
