And here is a summary in English text:

This tentative ruling is regarding a motion by the defendants to enforce a waiver of jury trial in a case between K Republic Entertainment Group (the plaintiff) and South Atlantic Investment LLC, Wei "Jason" Chen, Coung "Robert" Luu, Global Indemnity Insurance Agency LLC, and Does 1-100 (the defendants). The defendants argue that the plaintiff waived its right to a jury trial by failing to make a demand for a jury trial, failing to pay the advance jury fee, and entering into an agreement to waive jury trial in a 2015 lease agreement. The court denies the motion, finding that the plaintiff did not waive its right to a jury trial and that the defendants failed to provide a statutory basis for the enforcement of a predispute waiver of jury trial. The court also notes that the right to a jury trial is a fundamental right protected by the California Constitution.
