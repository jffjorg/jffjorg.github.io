[1]However,
the Court rejects the “seriously inconvenient” standard advanced by Plaintiff
for the reasons set forth in Fox Factory,
Inc. v. Superior Court (2017) 11 Cal.App.5th 197, 374.) 
 


[2]
This section states: All actions not included in
§§ 16-56-104 (special actions, assault/battery, false imprisonment, slander,
home inspection report consumer), 16-56-105 (contract, rent arrearages,
trespass to land, libel, trespass to chattels), 16-56-108 (recovery of
statutory penalties), and 16-56-109 (actions against sheriffs, coroners, and
other officials) shall be commenced within five (5) years after the cause of
action has accrued. If this is true, then Plaintiffs’ limitations period has
not yet expired. No one cited to this code section.


[3] Defendants position would be stronger if they agreed
to a formal stipulation. (See Stangvik v.
Shiley Inc., supra, 54 Cal.3d at p. 752 [noting that the court must be
willing to accept the defendant’s stipulation that he will not raise a statute
of limitations defense in the second state.)


[4]The Court will note that it took Plaintiffs eight months
to serve Defendant with the Complaint. Thereafter, Defendants filed this motion
 five months after service. 


[5]The Uniform Interstate Depositions and Discovery Act
(UIDDA), which Arkansas adopted, allows reciprocal enforcement of discovery
subpoenas. Defendant is still correct that California could not compel Arkansas
citizens to attend trial in California.


[6]Although Defendants can make this a non-factor by immediately,
voluntarily disclosing this evidence to Plaintiffs.
