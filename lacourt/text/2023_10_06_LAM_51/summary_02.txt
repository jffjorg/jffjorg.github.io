```

And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in this case, rejecting the plaintiff's "seriously inconvenient" standard for determining the statute of limitations. The Judge notes that the Uniform Interstate Depositions and Discovery Act (UIDDA) allows reciprocal enforcement of discovery subpoenas, but also points out that California cannot compel Arkansas citizens to attend trial in California. The Judge suggests that the defendant's position would be stronger if they agreed to a formal stipulation, and notes that the plaintiff took eight months to serve the defendant with the complaint, with the defendant filing the motion five months after service. The Judge also suggests that the defendant can make the issue of disclosing evidence a non-factor by voluntarily disclosing the evidence to the plaintiff.
