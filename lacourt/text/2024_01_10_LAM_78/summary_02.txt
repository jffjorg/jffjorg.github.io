And here is the English-text summary:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to amend the judgment nunc pro tunc. The motion was filed by the plaintiff, MICHAEL L. JOHNSON, who seeks to amend the judgment to include prejudgment interest. The Court previously denied the request for prejudgment interest because a calculation of interest was not included with the documents submitted in support of the application for default judgment. However, the Court has found that a calculation of interest was included in the plaintiff's declaration. The Court has decided that the error was not a clerical error, but rather a judicial error, and therefore has the power to change its own order. The Court has granted the motion and ordered the plaintiff to file an amended JUD-100 within five days. The Court has also set a nonappearance date of January 26, 2023, to review the amended JUD-100.
