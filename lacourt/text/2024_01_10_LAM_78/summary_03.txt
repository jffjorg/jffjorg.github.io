And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge Jill Feeney regarding a motion to compel further responses to requests for production of documents in a lemon law case. The case involves Plaintiffs Mihaela Dcu and Andrei Gaina, who allege that their 2022 Chevrolet Bolt vehicle was delivered with defects that General Motors could not repair. The Plaintiffs filed a motion to compel Defendant General Motors to produce responsive documents, which the Defendant had failed to produce. The Court grants the motion in part and denies it in part, ordering the Defendant to produce documents related to the vehicle's warranty policy, internal analysis of defects, customer complaints, and other relevant documents. The Court also declines to impose sanctions, but notes that the motion was avoidable by both sides. The case will proceed with the production of the ordered documents, and the parties are ordered to meet and confer regarding the dispute.
