Background
 
On August 20, 2021, Raul
Raygoza (“Plaintiff”) filed a lemon law action against General Motors LLC
(“Defendant” or “GM”) and Does 1 to 10 for (1) Violation of Civ. Code §
1793.2(d); (2) Violation of Civ. Code § 1793.2(b); (3) Violation of Civ. Code §
1793.2(A)(3); (4) Breach of Express Written Warranty (Civ. Code §§ 1791.2(a),
1794); and (5) Breach of Implied Warranty of Merchantability (Civ. Code §§
1791.1, 1794, 1795.5). 
 
On December 4, 2023, a Notice of
Settlement was filed. On July 9, 2024, Plaintiff’s motion for attorney’s fees
was granted in the sum of $20,982.00. 
 
On July 1, 2024, Plaintiff filed a
memorandum of costs for $1,615.71. 
 
Defendant GM now moves to strike costs.
Plaintiff opposes the Motion. The matter is now before the court. 


 
motion to
strike costs
 
I.               
Legal Standard
 
CCP § 1033.5 sets forth the costs recoverable by the
prevailing party. To recover a cost, it must be reasonably necessary to the
litigation and reasonable in amount. (Perko’s Enterprises, Inc. v. RRNS
Enterprises (l992) 4 Cal.App.4th 238, 244.) " If the items appearing
in a cost bill appear to be proper charges, the burden is on the party seeking
to tax costs to show that they were not reasonable or necessary. (Ladas v.
California State Automotive Assoc. (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 761, 773-74.) “On
the other hand, if the items are properly objected to, they are put in issue
and the burden of proof is on the party claiming them as costs.” (Ibid.) 
 
The losing party may dispute any or all the items in the
prevailing party’s memorandum of costs by a motion to strike or tax costs.
(CRC, rule 3.1700(b).) A motion to strike challenges the entire costs
memorandum, whereas a motion to tax challenges particular items or amounts. 
 
II.        Discussion
 
Defendant
GM seeks to strike the memorandum of costs on the grounds it is untimely and
seeks unreasonable costs. 
 
A.        Timeliness
of Memorandum of Costs
 
Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1700(a) states: 
 
A
prevailing party who claims costs must serve and file a memorandum of costs
within 15 days after the date of service
of the notice of entry of judgment or dismissal by the clerk under Code of
Civil Procedure section 664.5 or the date of service of written notice of entry
of judgment or dismissal, or within 180 days after entry of judgment, whichever
is first. The memorandum of costs must be verified by a statement of the party,
attorney, or agent that to the best of his or her knowledge the items of cost are
correct and were necessarily incurred in the case.


Defendant
GM asserts that because a CCP § 998 settlement is the functional equivalent of
a dismissal, Plaintiff had 15 days from then to file a memorandum of costs.
“[T]he term ‘judgment’ in section 998 is meant to include its functional
equivalents, such as dismissal of a case with prejudice.” (Madrigal v.
Hyundai Motor America (2023) 90 Cal.App.5th 385, 400, review granted].) 
 
The
Court disagrees for three reasons. 
First, Madrigal does not stand for the proposition that the 15-day
deadline to file a memorandum of costs begins to accrue at the time a party
accepts a 998 Offer. In DeSaulles v. Community Hospital of Monterey
Peninsula (2016) 62 Cal.4th 1140, the California Supreme Court explained
that for purposes of enforcing a settlement, a 998 Offer was the equivalent of
a dismissal and made no assertion that 998 settlements start the accrual of the
15 day deadline under CRC, rule 3.1700(a). 
“‘[A]s between the parties thereto and for purposes of enforcement of
settlement agreements, a compromise agreement contemplating payment by
defendant and dismissal of the action by plaintiff is the legal equivalent of a
judgment in plaintiff's favor.’ [Citation.]” (DeSaulles, p. 115.)  
 
Neither
Madrigal nor DeSaulles stand for the proposition that acceptance
of a 998 Offer triggers the 15 day deadline to file a memorandum of costs.
“Cases are not authority for propositions not considered.” (KCSFV I, LLC v.
Florin County Water Dist. (2021) 64 Cal.App.5th 1015, 1032.) 
 
Second,
Rule 3.1700 applies only to allowable costs under CCP § 1033.5(a) and not
statutory costs permitted under Civ. Code § 1794(d). (See Anthony
v. City of Los Angeles (2008) 166 Cal.App.4th 1011,
1015.)  Third, time provisions related to
the filing of a memorandum are mandatory, but not jurisdictional. (Sanabria
v. Embrey (2001) 92 Cal.App.4th 422, 426.) Accordingly, the court has the
discretion to consider an untimely memorandum of costs. (Anthony, supra,
166 Cal.App.4th at p. 1015, fn. 2.) 
 
The
court does not find Plaintiff’s memorandum of costs untimely and Defendant has
cited no authority that precludes the court from awarding costs even if the
memorandum was untimely filed. 
 
B.        Discrepancy
In Costs Sought 
 
Defendant
GM objects to the $1,615.71 sought in the memorandum of
costs on the grounds that Plaintiff’s motion for attorney’s fees sought costs
in the sum of $1,296.86 but now the memorandum of costs seeks $318.85 more.
Defendant GM fails to cite case law holding that the fact the memorandum of
costs seeks additional costs is a sufficient basis to strike those costs or
that the $318.85 sought by Plaintiff is not a recoverable cost under Civ. Code
§ 1794(d). “If the items on a verified cost bill appear proper charges, they
are prima facie evidence that the costs, expenses and services therein listed
were necessarily incurred.” (Seever v. Copley Press, Inc. (2006)
141 Cal.App.4th 1550, 1557.)
 
The
fact that the memorandum of costs seeks additional costs from Plaintiff’s
motion for attorney’s fees and costs does not mean that the costs were not
reasonably incurred.  Moreover, Defendant
cites no basis that would permit the court to strike those costs. 
 
C.        Item
2: Jury Fees 
 
Defendant
GM objects $150.00 in costs for jury fees on the basis the case was settled and
never went to trial. Plaintiff asserts that if he did not pay jury fees, he
would have waived the right to a jury trial, and until the action was settled,
Plaintiff had the obligation to continue to prepare for trial. 
 
The
court finds that Defendant GM has failed to show that Plaintiff’s jury fees
costs were not reasonably incurred nor necessary to the conduct of the
litigation. Therefore, the court will not strike jury fees from Plaintiff’s
memorandum of costs. 


 
D.        Item
16- Other Costs
 
Defendant
GM objects to the $37.70 sought by Plaintiff’s counsel for filing a Notice of
Change of Address or Other Contact Information. Defendant GM asserts that the
change of address was unnecessary and is not properly compensable. Plaintiff
asserts that the Change of Address motion is an allowable cost and Defendant GM
has not shown that the cost was unreasonable. (CCP, 1033.5(a)(1); see Jensen
v. BMW of North America (1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 112, 137-138 [examining the
legislative history of Song-Beverly to determine that the “costs and expenses”
language was to be interpreted broadly to include such things as filing fees,
expert witness fees, marshal’s fees, etc., to “‘open the litigation process to
everyone.’”].) 
 
The
court agrees that Defendant GM has failed to show that the filing of Notice of
Change of Address or Other Contact Information was merely convenient or
beneficial and not necessary to the conduct of the litigation. Therefore, the
$37.70 will not be taxed. 
 
Defendant
GM also objects to the $97.95 in costs incurred from courtesy copies related to
“the 3/2/2023 stipulation and order and 4/9/2024 motion for attorney’s fees”
because courtesy copies are not required by the court. (Motion, at p. 6:18-21.)
While the court does not require courtesy copies, the court accepts courtesy
copies of motion papers. Plaintiff also cites authority that delivery fees are
compensable at the court’s discretion because they are not a disallowed cost
under section 1033(b). (See Ladas v. California State Automobile Association
(1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 761, 776.)
 
“[A]
party's ‘mere statements in the points and authorities accompanying its notice
of motion to strike cost bill and the declaration of its counsel are
insufficient to rebut the prima facie showing [that the costs were necessarily
incurred].’ (Jones, 63 Cal.App.4th at p. 1266 citing Rappenecker v.
Sea-Land Service, Inc. (1979) 93 Cal.App.3d 256, 266.) The court finds that
the courtesy copies and fees associated with the delivery were reasonably
incurred and will not be stricken from the memorandum of costs. 
 
Defendant
GM’s motion to tax costs is denied. 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant
GM’s motion to strike costs is denied. Plaintiff to give notice.
