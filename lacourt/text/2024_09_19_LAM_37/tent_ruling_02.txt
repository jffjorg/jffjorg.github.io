Background
 
On August 24, 2023, Holy Oil Partnerships (“Plaintiff”)
filed a Complaint against Stephen Hightower (“Hightower”); Stephen Hightower II
(“Hightower II”); Hightowers Petroleum Company (“HPC”) (collectively
“Defendants”) and Does 1 to 100. 
On March 1, 2024, Plaintiff filed the First Amended
Complaint (“FAC”) alleging the following six causes of action: 
1)    
Breach of Contract;
2)    
Breach of Implied Covenant of Good
Faith and Fair Dealing;
3)    
Promissory Estoppel; 
4)    
Intentional Interference with
Prospective Economic Advantage; 
5)    
Negligent Interference with Prospective
Economic Advantage; and 
6)    
Breach of Fiduciary Duty. 
 
On
June 3, 2024, the court sustained Defendants’ demurrer with leave to amend as
to the first, second, third, and sixth causes of action and overruled as to the
fourth and fifth causes of action. 
 
On
July 3, 2024, Plaintiff filed the operative Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”)
alleging the same six causes of action as the FAC. Defendants filed a demurrer and
move to strike the SAC. Plaintiff opposes the Motions. The matter is now before
the court. 
 
demurrer[1]
 
I.         Legal Standard
 
A.        Demurrer 
 
A demurrer is an
objection to a pleading, the grounds for which are apparent from either the
face of the complaint or a matter of which the court may take judicial notice.
(CCP, § 430.30, subd. (a); see also Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d
311, 318.)¿“To survive a demurrer, the complaint need only allege facts
sufficient to state a cause of action; each evidentiary fact that might
eventually form part of the plaintiff’s proof need not be alleged.”¿(C.A. v.
William S. Hart Union High School Dist. (2012) 53 Cal.4th
861, 872.)¿For the purpose of testing the sufficiency of the cause of action, the
demurrer admits the truth of all material facts properly pleaded.¿ (Aubry v.
Tri-City Hospital Dist. (1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 966-967.)¿A demurrer “does
not admit contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law.”¿(Daar v.
Yellow Cab Co. (1967) 67 Cal.2d 695, 713.)¿¿ 
 
B.        Motion to Strike 
 
¿Any party, within the time allowed to respond to a pleading
may serve and file a notice of motion to strike the whole or any part thereof.
(CCP § 435(b)(1); CRC, rule 3.1322(b).) The court may, upon a motion or at any
time in its discretion and upon terms it deems proper: (1) strike out any
irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading; or (2) strike
out all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the
laws of California, a court rule, or an order of the court. (CCP § 436(a)-(b); Stafford
v. Shultz (1954) 42 Cal.2d 767, 782 [“Matter in a pleading which is not
essential to the claim is surplusage; probative facts are surplusage and may be
stricken out or disregarded”].)¿¿¿¿ 
 
C.        Leave to Amend 
 
“Where the defect raised by a motion to strike or by demurrer
is reasonably capable of cure, leave to amend is routinely and liberally
granted to give the plaintiff a chance to cure the defect in question.” (CLD
Construction, Inc. v. City of San Ramon (2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 1141, 1146.)
The burden is on the complainant to show the Court that a pleading can be
amended successfully. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.)¿¿¿ 
 III.     Discussion
 
A.        First Cause of Action - Breach of
Contract
 
The elements of a claim for
breach of contract are: “(1) the existence of the contract, (2) plaintiff’s
performance or excuse for nonperformance, (3) defendant's breach, and (4) the
resulting damages to the plaintiff.” (Oasis West Realty, LLC v. Goldman (2011)
51 Cal. 4th 811, 821.) In addition, the complaint must demonstrate damages
proximately caused by the breach. (St. Paul Ins. v. American Dynasty (2002)
101 Cal.App.4th 1038, 1060.) Furthermore, “the complaint must [also] indicate
on its face whether the contract is written, oral, or implied by conduct.” (Otworth
v. Southern Pac. Transportation Co. (1985) 166 Cal.App.3d 452, 458-59
citing CCP, § 430.10(g).)
 
Defendants
assert that Plaintiff fails to allege the existence of an oral contract as the
contract lacked express terms and mutual assent. “Under California law, a
contract will be enforced if it is sufficiently definite (and this is a
question of law) for the court to ascertain the parties' obligations and to
determine whether those obligations have been performed or breached.” (Ersa
Grae Corp. v. Fluor Corp. (1991) 1 Cal.App.4th 613, 623.)
 
The
SAC alleges that Plaintiff and Defendant formed a partnership and entered a
contract “based on the roles and commitments of the three parties made during
the Partnership Meeting and the Proposal[.]” (SAC, ¶¶ 52, 53.) “On March 18,
2022, Plaintiffs, City’s Mayor, and Hightower II conducted a video conference
(“Partnership Meeting”). The parties discussed the “City Gas” branded station
as well as other components of the P3 Project.” (Id., ¶ 39.) The SAC
asserts that “[t]he parties engaged in a thorough discussion of the Proposal
and confirmed the roles, ideas, and commitments of the parties outlined in the
Proposal.” (Id., ¶ 39.) 
 
Plaintiff
fails to state what the Proposal outlined and what role each of the Defendants
agreed to take. Plaintiff fails to state what contractual responsibilities
Defendant Hightower II agreed to complete pursuant to the Proposal. (SAC, ¶
28.) Instead, the SAC asserts contractual obligations were made orally by the
Parties at the March 18, 2022 Partnership Meeting. (Id., ¶ 39.) The SAC
asserts that Defendant Hightower II also agreed to secure the funding necessary
for the P3 Project but fails to state when the funding had to be obtained and
if the funding required Hightower II to find investors or secure personal loans
for the P3 Project. Plaintiff states Hightower II on behalf of Defendant HPC
agreed to “deploy smart grid technology” but fails to state whether a date was
provided for this project, if Defendants were required to obtain permits or
leases, and whether the approval by the Adelanto City Council was a condition
precedent to Defendants’ performance. (SAC, ¶ 42.) 
 
Plaintiff
further states that Defendant Hightower II agreed to handle the daily
operations of the City Gas station, but the SAC fails to state if the City Gas
station had been built and Defendants’ performance is now due. (SAC, ¶ 44.)
According to Plaintiff’s proposed asset development, Plaintiff had spoken with
the owners of the land for “the proposed Fueling Station” and the owners were
willing to move forward to the sale of the land. (Id., 29, Ex. 3.) The
SAC asserts that the land acquisition would be handled by the City of Adelanto,
but the SAC fails to state whether the acquisition was in fact completed. (Id.,
¶ 51.) 
 
“In contract law, a ‘condition
precedent’ is ‘either an act of a party that must be performed or an 
uncertain event that must happen
before the contractual right accrues or the contractual duty 
arises.’ [Citations.]” (Wm. R.
Clarke Corp. v. Safeco Ins. Co. (1997) 15 Cal.4th 882, 885, fn. 1.) 
According to the facts alleged in
the SAC, the City of Adelanto must first purchase the land, and the City Gas
station built, before Defendants are obligated to deploy smart grid technology
to the first location as part of the P3 Project. (SAC, ¶¶ 42, 50.) Moreover,
Defendants were not obligated to handle the daily operations or bring in
Operational Partners to handle the daily operations of the City Gas station
when the gas station had not yet been built and no land was purchased. (SAC, ¶
44.)  Therefore, Defendants cannot be
liable for breach of performance when the conditions precedent to their
performance have not occurred. Furthermore, the SAC does not allege that the
City’s performance was contingent on Defendants’ acquiring funding and
continuing to be part of the P3 Project. 
 
The remaining breach
alleged by the SAC is that Defendants agreed to take the lead on the P3 Project
and secure funding, but the SAC fails to state when Defendants’ performance was
due and how much funding Defendant agreed to procure for the P3 Project. (SAC,
¶¶ 40, 44.) “To be enforceable, a promise must be definite
enough that a court can determine the scope of the duty and the limits of
performance must be sufficiently defined to provide a rational basis for the
assessment of damages.” (Ladas v. California State Auto. Assn. (1993) 19
Cal.App.4th 761, 770.) Without an estimation of how much funding Defendants
agreed to procure for the P3 Project and when performance was due, the court
cannot find that the terms of the oral contract were sufficiently definite that
a contract existed between the parties. 
 
Lastly,
the SAC alleges that “[t]here was no definitive date in which the Contract
would be performed by.”  (SAC, ¶ 55.)
“Plaintiffs are informed and believe that, given the resources and relative
capabilities of the parties, that the Contract could be performed within one
year.” (SAC, ¶ 56.) Defendants assert that Plaintiff’s breach of contract claim
is barred by the statute of frauds. (Civ. Code, § 1624.) The statute of frauds
applies “only to those contracts which, by their terms, cannot possibly be performed
within one year.” (White Lighting Co. v. Wolfson (1968) 68 Cal.2d 336,
343.) 
 
The
facts in the SAC do not support the finding that the Contract/P3 Project could
be performed within a year because there are no facts showing that the City
could purchase the land within a year, the City Gas station could have been be
built within a year, that Defendants could deploy the smart grid technology as
part of the first phase of the P3 Project within one year, that Defendants
could oversee daily operations of the City Gas station within one year, and
that within one year Defendants could have obtained funding for the P3 Project.

 
Based
on the facts above, the court finds that Plaintiff has failed to allege the
existence of an oral contract that is valid and enforceable against Defendants.
The demurrer to the first cause of action is sustained with leave to amend. 
 
B.        Second Cause of Action – Breach of Implied Covenant of Good
Faith and Fair Dealing
 
“Every contract contains an implied covenant of
good faith and fair dealing providing that no party to the contract will do
anything that would deprive another party of the benefits of the contract.¿The
implied covenant protects the reasonable expectations of the contracting
parties based on their mutual promises.” (Digerati Holdings, LLC v. Young
Money Entertainment, LLC (2011) 194 Cal.App.4th 873, 885.) The
covenant thus cannot “ ‘be endowed with an existence independent of its
contractual underpinnings.’ ” (Waller v. Truck Ins. Exchange,
Inc. (1995) 11 Cal.4th 1, 36
quoting Love v. Fire Ins. Exchange (1990)
221 Cal.App.3d 1136, 1153.) “It cannot  impose substantive duties or
limits on the contracting parties beyond those incorporated in the specific
terms of their agreement.” (Guz v. Bechtel Nat. Inc. (2000) 24
Cal.4th 317, 349–350.) 
 
As Plaintiff failed to plead
the existence of a valid oral contract, the demurrer to the second cause of
action is sustained with leave to amend. 
 
C.        Third Cause of Action – Promissory
Estoppel 
 
“‘The elements of a promissory
estoppel claim are ‘(1) a promise clear and unambiguous in its terms; (2) reliance
by the party to whom the promise is made; (3)[the] reliance must be both
reasonable and foreseeable; and (4) the party asserting the estoppel must be
injured by his reliance.’ [Citation.]” (Advanced Choices, Inc. v. State
Dept. of Health Services (2010) 182 Cal.App.4th 1661, 1672, citing US
Ecology, Inc. v. State of California (2005) 129 Cal.App.4th 887, 901.)
“Conceptually, promissory estoppel is distinct from contract in that the
promisee's justifiable and detrimental reliance on the promise is regarded as a
substitute for the consideration required as an element of an enforceable
contract.” (Signal Hill Aviation Co. v. Stroppe (1979) 96 Cal.App.3d
627, 640.)
 
The court finds that the SAC
fails to plead a clear and unambiguous promise as the SAC fails to state what
Defendants’ obligations were in taking the lead on the P3 Project and how much
and by what means Defendants were to obtain the funding for the P3 Project.
(SAC, ¶ 40.) Plaintiff further asserts that they
justifiably relied on Defendants’ promise by securing additional partners and
reached agreements with Kowrii Bank and Lincoln Avenue Brewery to support the
P3 Project and incurred substantial expenses by conducting extensive research,
engaging with potential partners, and covering costs to advance the P3 Project,
all in reliance on Defendants’ assurances. (SAC, ¶¶ 58-60.) 
 
The
SAC fails to show that Plaintiff’s agreement with Lincoln Avenue Brewery was
reasonable given the fact that the plot for the City Gas station had not been
sold, the City had not approved the purchase, and the gas station had not yet
been built. Moreover, the agreement with Kowrii Bank was finalized on or about
February 12, 2021, as evidenced by the cashier’s check. (SAC, ¶ 59.) However,
the SAC asserts that the agreement was reached on March 18, 2022, therefore
Plaintiff could not have relied on Defendants’ promises related to the Kowrii
Bank transaction when the Promise had not yet been made. (SAC, ¶ 37.) 
 
The
demurrer to the third cause of action is sustained with leave to amend. 
 
D.        Sixth Cause of Action – Breach of
Fiduciary Duty
 
“‘[B]efore a person
can be charged with a fiduciary obligation, he must either knowingly undertake
to act on behalf and for the benefit of another, or must enter into a
relationship which imposes that undertaking as a matter of law.’” (Hassov.
Hapke (2014) 227 Cal.App.4th 107, 140 (quoting Committee on Children’s
Television, Inc. v. General Foods Corp.(1983) 35 Cal.3d 197, 221).) “A
fiduciary duty under common law may arise ‘when one person enters into a
confidential relationship with another.’” (Id.) A¿partnership
relationship is a fiduciary relationship. (See Cleveland v. Johnson
(2012) 209 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1338.)
 
Defendants’ demurrer
to the sixth cause of action on the basis that the SAC fails to plead the
existence of a fiduciary relationship because there was no Partnership
Agreement. 
 
While the SAC alleges
the existence of a contract, the terms of the contract are not definite and do
not support the finding that Defendants entered a fiduciary relationship with
Plaintiff. Therefore, the demurrer to the sixth cause of action is sustained
with leave to amend. 
 
            E.        Defendant Stephen Hightower’s Individual Demurrer
 
Defendant Stephen
Hightower demurs to the entire SAC because the SAC failed to allege any
specific allegations against him. The court previously sustained the demurrer
as to Defendant Stephen Hightower because the FAC was devoid of factual
allegations as to his wrongful conduct. (6/03/2024 Order.) Plaintiff’s
opposition also failed to address Defendant Hightower’s contentions that the
SAC was insufficiently pled as to him. All that the SAC states are that
Defendant Hightower is the chief executive officer and president of Defendant
HPC but there are no allegations as to how Defendant Hightower ratified
Defendants HPC or Hightower II’s conduct. 
 
Accordingly, the
demurrer as to him is sustained without leave to amend. 
 
MOTION TO STRIKE
 
I.         Discussion
 
Defendants move to
strike the SAC request for punitive damages as alleged in Paragraphs 113, 137,
and Paragraph 3 in the Prayer for Relief. As the demurrer has been sustained,
the motion to strike is also granted with leave to amend. 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendants’
demurrer is sustained with leave to amend. Defendant Stephen Hightower’s
demurrer is sustained without leave to amend. The motion to strike is granted
with leave to amend. Plaintiff
is granted 30 days leave to amend. The court sets the OSC RE: Amended Complaint
for _, at 8:30 a.m. Defendants to give notice.
