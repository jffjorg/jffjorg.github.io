And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendant's motion to strike costs. The defendant, General Motors, LLC, seeks to strike the plaintiff's memorandum of costs, which includes $1,615.71 in costs. The judge denies the motion, finding that the memorandum of costs is timely and that the costs claimed by the plaintiff are reasonable and necessary.

The judge rejects the defendant's argument that the plaintiff's memorandum of costs is untimely, citing case law that the 15-day deadline to file a memorandum of costs begins to accrue at the time of entry of judgment, not at the time of acceptance of a settlement offer. The judge also finds that the plaintiff's jury fees and other costs are reasonable and necessary, and that the defendant has failed to show that they were not properly incurred.

The judge notes that the parties agreed to settle the case, and that the plaintiff's motion for attorney's fees was granted. The judge concludes that the defendant's motion to tax costs is denied, and that the plaintiff is entitled to the costs claimed in their memorandum of costs.
