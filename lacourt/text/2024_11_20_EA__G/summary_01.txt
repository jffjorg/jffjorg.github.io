And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge's Tentative Ruling is to continue the hearing on Malik Crawford's Motion for Approval of Private Attorneys General Act (PAGA) Settlement Agreement and Release, Award of Attorneys' Fees and Costs, General Release Fee, and Settlement Administration Costs. The motion was filed on October 14, 2024, and the hearing is set for November 20, 2024.

The court's review of the settlement will consider factors such as the strength of Crawford's case, the risk of litigation, the complexity of the case, and the settlement amount. However, the court has not received sufficient information to evaluate the fairness and reasonableness of the proposed settlement. Specifically, Crawford's counsel has not provided an estimate of the defendants' potential PAGA penalties exposure or compared it to the amount obtained in the proposed settlement.

Therefore, the court orders Crawford's counsel to provide supplemental briefing on the estimated PAGA penalties exposure and a comparison of that amount to the amount obtained in the proposed settlement. The court will then review and consider the revised information before making a decision on the motion.
