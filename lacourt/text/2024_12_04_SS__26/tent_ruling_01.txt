 Petitioner George Fenton (“Petitioner”) filed the instant
Petition for Release of Mechanic’s Lien against Respondent Lamar Molina (“Respondent”)
on June 21, 2024. No response to the Petition has been filed to date.
Discussion
Petitioner moves to have the mechanic’s lien recorded
against their property by Respondent released. Under Civil Code section 8484
the petition for release order must be verified by the petitioner and allege
the following:
(a) The date of recordation of the
claim of lien. A certified copy of the claim of lien shall be attached to the
petition.
(b) The county in which the claim of
lien is recorded.
(c) The book and page or series number
of the place in the official records where the claim of lien is recorded.
(d) The legal description of the
property subject to the claim of lien.
(e) Whether an extension of credit has
been granted under Section 8460, if so to what date, and that the time for
commencement of an action to enforce the lien has expired.
(f) That the owner has given the
claimant notice under Section 8482 demanding that the claimant execute and
record a release of the lien and that the claimant is unable or unwilling to do
so or cannot with reasonable diligence be found.
(g) Whether an action to enforce the
lien is pending.
(h) Whether the owner of the property
or interest in the property has filed for relief in bankruptcy or there is
another restraint that prevents the claimant from commencing an action to
enforce the lien.
(Civil Code, § 8484.) The Petition contains all the above
information, as required. However, Civil Code section 8486, subdivision (b)
also requires service of the Petition and Notice of Hearing to “be made in the
same manner as service of summons, or by certified or registered mail, postage
prepaid, return receipt requested . . . .” (Civ. Code, § 8486, subd. (b).) The
proof of service of the Petition and Notice of Hearing is inadequate. The
Petition and Notice of Hearing were served by mail but the proofs of service do
not indicate compliance with requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section
415.30. The proof of service filed on Judicial Council form POS-040 merely
indicates service by United States mail. (Proof of Service, filed 10/21/24,
¶6.) The proof of service filed on Judicial Council form POS-010 states that
service was accomplished by other means, described as “California Code, CCP
415.30. California Code, CCP 1013.” (Proof of Service by Mail, filed 10/21/24,
¶5d.) Proof of service of a summons by mail must be set forth under paragraph
5c to demonstrate compliance with Code of Civil Procedure section 415.40, which
pertains to mail service on a person outside of California. The Court cannot
reach the merits of the Petition without Petitioner’s compliance with the
statutory service requirements.
Conclusion
Therefore, Petitioner George Fenton’s Petition to Release
Property from Mechanic’s Lien is CONTINUED TO MARCH 3, 2025 AT 10:00 AM IN
DEPARTMENT 26 IN THE SPRING STREET COURTHOUSE. BY FEBRUARY 11, 2025, PETITIONER
IS TO FILE PROOF OF SERVICE OF THE PETITION AND NOTICE OF HEARING IN COMPLIANCE
WITH THE STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS. FAILURE TO DO SO MAY RESULT IN THE PETITION
BEING DENIED.
