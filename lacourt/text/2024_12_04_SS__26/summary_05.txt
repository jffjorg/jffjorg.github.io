And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the defendant's demurrer to the plaintiff's first amended complaint is sustained without leave to amend. The plaintiff, Melyssa Terry, filed a complaint against the defendant, Trophy Universal City Group, LLC dba Universal City Nissan, alleging a breach of contract. However, the first amended complaint fails to state a cause of action because it does not contain any factual allegations to support the claim. The defendant filed a demurrer, arguing that the complaint does not meet the requirements of California Code of Civil Procedure section 430.10, and the plaintiff did not file an opposition to the demurrer. As a result, the judge has sustained the demurrer and the plaintiff will not be allowed to amend the complaint to cure the deficiencies.
