And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Petitioner, George Fenton, has filed a petition to release a mechanic's lien against his property. The lien was recorded by the Respondent, Lamar Molina, but the Petitioner is seeking to have it released. The Court has reviewed the petition and has found that it is incomplete due to inadequate proof of service of the petition and notice of hearing. The Court has ordered the Petitioner to file proof of service that complies with the statutory requirements by February 11, 2025. If the Petitioner fails to do so, the petition may be denied. The petition is continued to March 3, 2025, at 10:00 AM in Department 26 in the Spring Street Courthouse.
