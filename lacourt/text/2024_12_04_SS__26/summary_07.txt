And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the defendant, Hui Ying Chen, may amend her admissions and request relief from the waiver of objections and monetary sanctions. The defendant had failed to respond to the requests for admissions, but argues that this was due to mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. The judge finds that the defendant has shown that she struggled to find an attorney to represent her in the action and was mistaken in believing no response to the discovery was necessary. As a result, the judge grants the defendant's motion and orders her to serve amended responses to the requests for admissions within 20 days.
