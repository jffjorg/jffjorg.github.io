ANALYSIS:
On January 16,
2024, Plaintiff DD Partners, LLC (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against
Defendants Arthur Davis (“Defendant Davis”) and Evian Reviere (“Defendant
Reviere”). On April 18, 2024, the Court entered Defendants’ default due to
their failure to file a responsive pleading.
Plaintiff filed
the instant Motion to Enforce the Settlement Agreement and for Entry of
Judgment in Plaintiff’s Favor Pursuant to Code Civ. Proc § 664.6 and for Costs
on October 3, 2024. No opposition has been filed to date.
Discussion
Defendants in
this action are currently in default, as entered by the clerk on April 18,
2024. Contrary to the representation in the Motion, default judgment has not yet
been entered against Defendants. A defendant in default is out of court. (See Sporn
v. Home Depot USA, Inc. (2005) 126 Cal.App.4th 1294, 1301.) Plaintiff is
required to seek default judgment against Defendants within 45 days of entry of
default. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.110(h).) The Motion does not provide
authority for the Court to enter a judgment under the parties’ settlement
agreement while default of the Complaint is pending against Defendants. 
Conclusion
Plaintiff DD
Partners, LLC’s Motion to Enforce the Settlement Agreement and for Entry of
Judgment in Plaintiff’s Favor Pursuant to Code Civ. Proc § 664.6 and for Costs
is DENIED.
