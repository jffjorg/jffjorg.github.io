 Case Number:  24STLC02429    Hearing Date:   December 4, 2024    Dept:  26 TENTATIVE RULING: 
Defendant Delta-JC, LLC’s Motion
to Vacate Default and Default Judgment is DENIED.                                                                                                             
ANALYSIS: 
On April 3, 2024, Plaintiff Jose Estrada (“Plaintiff”) filed
the instant action against Defendant Delta-JC, LLC (“Defendants”). Following
Defendant’s failure to file a responsive pleading, the Court entered their
default on May 22, 2024, and default judgment on May 28, 2024. 
Defendant filed the instant Motion to Set Aside Entry of
Default and Default Judgment on October 23, 2024. Plaintiff filed an opposition
on November 6, 2024 and Defendants replied on November 20, 2024.
Discussion
Defendant moves to vacate the entry of default and default
judgment on two grounds. First, that Plaintiff did not warn it in advance of
obtaining default, and second, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 473,
subdivision (b).
Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b)
An application for discretionary relief pursuant to Code of
Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b) must be made within a reasonable
time, no more than six months after entry of the order from which relief is
sought, and must be accompanied by an affidavit of fault attesting to the
party’s excusable mistake, inadvertence, surprise or neglect. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 473, subd. (b); English v. IKON Business Solutions (2001) 94
Cal.App.4th 130, 143.) The motion must also be accompanied by a copy of the
moving defendant’s proposed pleading. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b).) This
can be corrected if the defendant submits a proposed responsive pleading by the
hearing date. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b); Carmel, Ltd. v. Tavoussi
(2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 393, 403.)
The Motion is supported by the declaration of Defendant’s
manager, who declares that Defendant failed to file a timely response because
it believed its tenant would defend the action. (Motion, Gabay Decl., ¶2.)
Specifically, because the table in this action that was allegedly not in
compliance with the disability statutes belonged to Defendant’s restaurant
tenants. (Ibid.) By the time Defendant’s manager heard back from the
tenant that it did not own the table and would not defend the action, default
had already been entered. (Id. at ¶3.) In opposition, Plaintiff disputes
that Defendant’s conduct was reasonable because the manager left the task of
communicating with the tenant to an unnamed staff member and thereafter did
nothing to ensure the tenant would actually defend the action in a timely
manner. Plaintiff also argues this is unreasonable because Defendant did not
request an extension of the time to respond from Plaintiff and ignored the
express warning on the Summons to respond within 30 days. The Court agrees that
Defendant’s evidence does not show that its conduct was excusable.
The Motion explains that “excusable” conduct “must have been
such as might have been the act of a reasonably prudent person under the same
circumstances.” (Elms v. Elms (1946) 72 Cal.App.2d 508, 513.) However,
Defendant does not explain how leaving the matter to an unnamed staff member
and failing to follow up within 30 days of service of the Summons was the
conduct of a reasonably prudent person under the same circumstances. In the
reply, to which no additional declaration is attached, Defendant argues that
its conduct was reasonable because its tenant was obligated to defend the
action under the lease agreement. This, however, does not address the other
factors discussed above including leaving the matter to be handled by an
unnamed staff member and the lack of any follow-up.
Additionally, the Court finds
the Motion is not timely. It is not simply a matter of filing the Motion within
six months, as Defendant contends. Where the statute requires that “ ‘ “the
application must be made within a ‘reasonable time’ … what is a reasonable time
in any case depends upon the circumstances of that particular case.” While in
“the determination of that question, a large discretion is necessarily confided
to [the trial] court” ... there must be some showing—some evidence—as the basis
for the exercise of such discretion.’ ” (Caldwell v. Methodist Hospital
(1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 1521, 1524 [citing Carrasco v. Craft (1985) 164
Cal.App.3d 796, 805].) The Motion does not demonstrate that moving for relief
five months after entry of default is “reasonable.” 
To the extent doubts regarding a motion for relief from
default must be resolved in favor of allowing the matter to be heard on the
merits, Defendant has not shown that any doubts
regarding the above factors exist. (See Lasalle v. Vogel (2019) 36
Cal.App.5th 127, 134.) Therefore, relief under Code of Civil Procedure section
473, subdivision (b) is denied. 
Ethical Obligations of Plaintiff’s Counsel
Defendant also moves to vacate the default and default
judgment on the grounds that Plaintiff’s counsel violated their ethical
obligations to warn Defendant of Plaintiff’s intention to take Defendant’s
default if a response to the Complaint is not filed. There is no authority for
such an obligation, however. The case to which Defendant cites refers to an
ethical obligation to warn defense counsel if a defendant is represented
prior to seeking default.
“The quiet speed of plaintiffs’
attorney in seeking a default judgment without the knowledge of defendants'
counsel is not to be commended.” (Smith v. Los Angeles Bookbinders
Union (1955) 133 Cal.App.2d 486, 500, 284 P.2d 194 (Bookbinders).) 
 
In contrast to the stealth and speed
condemned in Bookbinders, courts and the State Bar emphasize warning and
deliberate speed. The State Bar Civility Guidelines deplore the conduct of an
attorney who races opposing counsel to the courthouse to enter a default before
a responsive pleading can be filed. (Fasuyi v. Permatex, Inc. (2008) 167
Cal.App.4th 681, 702, 84 Cal.Rptr.3d 351 (Fasuyi), quoting section 15 of the
California Attorney Guidelines of Civility and Professionalism (2007).)
Accordingly, it is now well-acknowledged that an attorney has an ethical
obligation to warn opposing counsel that the attorney is about to take an
adversary's default. (Id. at pp. 701-702, 84 Cal.Rptr.3d 351.)
 
In that regard we heartily endorse the
related admonition found in The Rutter Group practice guide, and we note the
authors’ emphasis on reasonable time: “Practice Pointer: If you're representing
plaintiff, and have had any contact with a lawyer representing defendant, don't
even attempt to get a default entered without first giving such lawyer written
notice of your intent to request entry of default, and a reasonable time within
which defendant's pleading must be filed to prevent your doing so.” (Weil &
Brown, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter Group
2008) § 5:73, p. 5-19 (rev. #1, 2008) as quoted in Fasuyi, supra, 167
Cal.App.4th at p. 702, 84 Cal.Rptr.3d 351.)
 
(Lasalle v. Vogel (2019) 36 Cal.App.5th 127, 135
[emphasis added].) It is clear that the obligation runs only to those
defendants who are represented by counsel prior to entry of default, if the
plaintiff’s attorney is aware of the representation. To hold that a warning should
be provided to every defendant regardless of representation would be an
unwarranted expansion of the rule. The request to vacate default and default
judgment on these grounds is also denied.
Merits of the Action
Finally, Defendant argues that it should be granted relief
from the default and default judgment because this action is without merit. No
authority is cited for the merits of the action being a basis for relief.
(Motion, p. 3:5-12.)
Conclusion
Defendant Delta-JC, LLC’s Motion
to Vacate Default and Default Judgment is DENIED.
Court clerk to give notice.
