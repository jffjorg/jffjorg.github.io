And here is the English-text summary:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on Plaintiff Sushant Gupta's Motion to Recuse Judicial Officer. The Court has denied the motion, citing that the Plaintiff's preemptory challenge to judicial officer was previously denied, and the assignment of the action to a new judicial officer renders the requested relief moot. The Plaintiff filed the Complaint against Defendants Lee Ann DiSalvo, Intuitive Healing Institute, LLC, and Kristen Lahey, and later voluntarily dismissed the action without prejudice. The Defendants filed Motions to Deem Plaintiff a Vexatious Litigant, which were granted by the Court. The Plaintiff then filed a Motion to Recuse Judicial Officer, which is now denied.
