And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has placed off calendar the plaintiff's renewed motion to discharge the interpleader stakeholder from liability and awarding costs and fees. The plaintiff, California Injury PLC, initiated an interpleader action against several defendants, but default was entered against them after they failed to file responsive pleadings. The plaintiff then filed a motion to discharge the interpleader stakeholder from liability and award costs and fees, which was initially set for hearing on October 24, 2024, but was continued to December 2, 2024. On November 25, 2024, the defendants filed a renewed motion to discharge the interpleader stakeholder from liability and award costs and fees, but no opposition was filed. The judge did not consider the renewed motion due to the plaintiff's failure to provide sufficient notice, as required by law. The plaintiff is admonished for this failure and may reserve a hearing date in accordance with the Code of Civil Procedure.
