And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to enforce a settlement agreement and enter judgment in their favor. The motion was filed by DD Partners, LLC against Arthur Davis and Evian Reviere, who are currently in default after failing to respond to the complaint. However, the judge notes that default judgment has not yet been entered against the defendants, and the plaintiff has not sought default judgment within the required 45-day period. The judge has instead set an order to show cause for February 5, 2025, to address the plaintiff's failure to enter default judgment.
