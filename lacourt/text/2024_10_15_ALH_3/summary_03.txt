And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has considered the petition for approval of a compromise with a special needs trust and has made several findings. The Court finds that the settlement amount is fair and reasonable, and that the requested attorney's fees, which amount to approximately 27% of the settlement amount, are also fair and reasonable. The Court has also reviewed the proposed trust instrument and finds it meets the requirements set forth in California Rules of Court and Local Alhambra Superior Court rules. However, the Court has identified two areas that need to be modified: the investment standard and the requirement for a bond from the co-trustees. The Court will require the co-trustees to provide a $1,756,000 bond and will continue the hearing to a later date to allow for the proposed order to be revised.
