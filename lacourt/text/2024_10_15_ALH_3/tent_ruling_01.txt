          On May 24,
2024, plaintiff Luz Mercado (“Plaintiff”) filed this motion for an order
compelling defendant ADP Technology Servies, Inc. (“Defendant”, erroneously
sued as “Automatic Data Processing, Inc.”) to serve further responses to Requests
for Production of Documents, Set Five, Nos. 140 and 141. Plaintiff also seeks
sanctions in the amount of $2,551.02 against Defendant and its counsel of
record. 
           On May 31, 2024, Defendant served supplemental
responses to RFP Nos. 140 and 141. 
          On October 8,
2024, Plaintiff filed a reply brief acknowledging that supplemental responses
were served to RFP Nos. 140 and 141 and does not raise issues with the content
of the supplemental responses. Plaintiff’s remaining complaint is that it did
not appear that Defendant had produced documents responsive to RFP No. 140. However,
a motion to compel compliance is different than a motion to compel a further
discovery response. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.320.) Therefore, Plaintiff’s
dissatisfaction with Defendant’s document production is not grounds for
granting Plaintiff’s motion. Accordingly, Plaintiff’s motion is DENIED. 
          Plaintiff’s
request for sanctions is DENIED. Defendant’s request for sanctions is GRANTED.
Plaintiff sent a meet and confer letter on May 7, 2024, identifying
deficiencies with Defendant’s responses to RFP Set Five, including RFP Nos. 140
and 141, and demanding supplemental responses by May 13, 2024. (Perelshteyn
Decl., Ex. A.) The next day, May 8, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel informed
Defendant that they reserved an IDC for June 4, 2024, in order to address this
set of document requests and demanded that Defendant serve a joint statement in
5 days. On May 16, 2024, Defendant’s counsel sent a letter agreeing to
supplement responses to RFP Nos. 90 through 131 by May 31, 2024. However, despite
having reserved an IDC, Plaintiff filed this motion 8 days later on May 24,
2024, without any further discussion of RFP Nos. 140 and 141. There is also no
indication that Plaintiff requested an extension to its deadline to file a
motion to compel further responses and that Defendant refused to grant such an
extension. Therefore, the motion was filed prematurely without substantial
justification. However, although defense counsel declares that her hourly rate
is $780 and that she has spent 4 hours on Defendant’s opposition, $3,120 is an excessive
amount in sanctions given that the motion lacks legal or factual complexity. 
Accordingly, sanctions are imposed on
Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s counsel, jointly and severally, in the amount of
$1,000, consisting of 2 hours at a reasonable rate of $500 per hour, to be paid
within 10 days of the date of this Order. 
Dated
this 15th
day of October, 2024
