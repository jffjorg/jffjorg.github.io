```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to requests for production, as the plaintiff's dissatisfaction with the defendant's document production is not grounds for granting the motion. The plaintiff's request for sanctions is also denied. The judge grants the defendant's request for sanctions in the amount of $1,000, consisting of 2 hours at a reasonable rate of $500 per hour, to be paid within 10 days of the date of this Order. The motion was filed prematurely without substantial justification, and the plaintiff failed to request an extension to its deadline to file a motion to compel further responses.
