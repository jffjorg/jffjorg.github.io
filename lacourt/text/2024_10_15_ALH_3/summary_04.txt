And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by defendant Edwin Castro to plaintiff Brandy Milliner's complaint. The plaintiff alleges that the defendant stole a winning lottery ticket from him, and the defendant argues that the plaintiff's claims for intentional and negligent interference with prospective economic relations fail to state sufficient facts.

The judge has sustained the demurrer, finding that the plaintiff's claims fail because no economic relationship between the plaintiff and the California Lottery could have existed at the time of the defendant's allegedly tortious conduct. The judge has also determined that the probability of economic advantage resulting from a lottery ticket purchase is inherently low.

The judge has ordered that the demurrer be sustained without leave to amend, and that the parties who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the court indicating their intention to submit as directed by the court's instructions.
