And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants HRC Defendants' motion for leave to file a cross-complaint against co-defendants ACRC, Li, and Zang. The judge finds that the proposed cross-complaint arises out of the same transaction as Plaintiffs' claims and that HRC Defendants are acting in good faith. The judge also disagrees with ACRC, Li, and Zang's claim that allowing the cross-complaint will be prejudicial to them, noting that ACRC admits that the proposed cross-complaint is "a wholly unnecessary exercise" that does not assert any additional cause of action or theory of recovery. The judge orders HRC Defendants to file the proposed cross-complaint within 5 days of the date of this Order.
