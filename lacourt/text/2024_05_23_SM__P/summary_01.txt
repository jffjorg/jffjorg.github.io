And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English:

The Judge's tentative ruling is a summary of the legal issues and disputes in the case. The case involves a student who was allegedly dropped and/or mishandled by a bus driver and a special education aide while being transported to school, resulting in a tibia fracture. The student's parents have filed a lawsuit against the school district, the bus company, and the bus driver and special education aide, alleging causes of action for assault, battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress, negligent infliction of emotional distress, and violation of the Ralph Civil Rights Act and the Unruh Civil Rights Act.

The Judge has ruled that the demurrer to the student's complaint (SAC) is overruled as to the first, second, fourth, and fifth causes of action, which means that these causes of action may proceed to trial. The demurrer is sustained as to the sixth through tenth causes of action, which means that these causes of action may not proceed to trial. The Judge has also denied the defendants' motion to strike punitive damages and has sustained the defendants' motion to strike negligent hiring, retention, and supervision.

The Judge's ruling is a summary of the legal issues and disputes in the case and is intended to guide the parties in preparing for trial.
