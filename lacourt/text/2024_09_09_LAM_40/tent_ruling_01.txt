 [TENTATIVE] RULING RE:
Defendant John
  Grondorf’s Demurrer to Plaintiff’s Complaint 



 
I. Background
A. Pleadings
On February 29, 2024, Plaintiff
Abigail Beckett (Beckett) filed a complaint against The Big Fix, LLC dba The
Craftsman Bar & Kitchen, John Grondorf, Xonatitlan Luques, Harris
Echevarria and Does 1-20 (collectively, Defendants) alleging causes of action
for (1) Sexual Battery [Civ. Code § 1708.5]; (2) Sexual Harassment [Gov. Code §
12940(J)]; (3) Constructive Discharge in Violation of Public Policy; (4)
Failure to Prevent Harassment [Gov. Code § 12940(K)]; (5) Retaliation for
Exercising Rights Under the FEHA; (6) Whistle-Blower Retaliation [Lab. Code §
1102.5]; and (7) Civil Code §§ 51.7 and 52. 
Beckett worked as a server at The
Craftsman Bar & Kitchen in Santa Monica (the Craftsman) from August 2022
until April 9, 2023. (Compl. ¶ 9.) She alleges that throughout her employment, other
Craftsman staff members including two cooks, Defendants Xonatitlan Luques
(Luques) and Harris Echevarria (Echevarria), sexually harassed her and touched
her inappropriately. (Compl. ¶¶ 12-17.) Beckett alleges that she initially reported
these incidents to her managers, but no action was taken (Compl. ¶¶ 13, 19.) As
a result of reporting the incidents, Beckett alleges that her hours were cut,
and her shifts were reduced (Compl. ¶¶ 13, 25, 27, 29.) Further, Beckett
alleges that managers, including Defendant John Grondorf (Grondorf), were
readily aware that Luques and Echevarria were sexually harassing female staff
members and that the Craftsman had a culture of protecting the two cooks and
firing female servers who complained about their conduct. (Compl. ¶¶ 18-19.) Eventually
Luques and Echevarria were transferred to another bar. (Compl. ¶ 30.) On April
9, 2024, Beckett resigned. (Compl. ¶ 32.) She alleges that she was
constructively terminated, suffering economic, non-economic, and emotional
damages. (Compl. ¶ 32.) 
B. Motion Before the Court 
On May 24, 2024, Defendant Grondorf
filed this demurrer to the complaint and a meet and confer declaration in
support of the demurrer. 
On August 21, 2024, Beckett filed a
first amended complaint (FAC). Proof of service filed with the Court shows that
the FAC was served on Grondorf on August 22, 2024.  
No answers, oppositions, or replies
are on file with the Court.
 
II. Motion
A. Legal Standard
“A party may amend its pleading once
without leave of the court at any time before the answer, demurrer, or motion
to strike is filed, or after a demurrer or motion to strike is filed but before
the demurrer or motion to strike is heard if the amended pleading is filed and
served no later than the date for filing an opposition to the demurrer or
motion to strike. A party may amend the pleading after the date for filing an
opposition to the demurrer or motion to strike, upon stipulation by the
parties.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 472, subd. (a).) “All papers opposing a motion so
noticed shall be filed with the court and a copy served on each party at least
nine court days … before the hearing.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1005, subd. (b).)
“[T]he filing of an amended complaint moots a motion directed to a prior
complaint.” (JKC3H8 v. Colton (2013) 221 Cal.App.4th 468, 477; see also Sylmar
Air Conditioning v. Pueblo Contracting Services, Inc. (2004) 122
Cal.App.4th 1049, 1054 [“The filing of [a] first amended complaint render[s] [a
movant’s] demurrer moot since “‘an amendatory pleading supersedes the original
one, which ceases to perform any function as a pleading”’” (citations
omitted)].) Accordingly, a “demurrer [directed to the original pleading] should
[be] taken off calendar” when an amended complaint is filed. (People ex rel.
Strathmann v. Acacia Research Corp. (2012) 210 Cal.App.4th 487, 506.) 
However, this right is limited to the amendment
of a complaint initiating an action into a first amended complaint; otherwise
stated, a party cannot amend an already amended complaint as a matter of course
even though a demurrer has been directed to the operative and already amended
pleading. (Hedwall v. PCMV, LLC (2018) 22 Cal.App.5th 564, 572-579
[holding, as a matter of first impression, that a party’s right to amend a
pleading as a matter of course under Code of Civil Procedure section 472,
subdivision (a) is limited to the original pleading commencing the action].)
Further, one defendant’s filing of an answer did not divest the plaintiff of
the right to amend the complaint with respect to the causes of action brought
against other demurring defendants. (Barton v. Kahn (2007) 157
Cal.App.4th 1216, 1219-1221.) 
B. Analysis
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
sections 472, subdivision (a), Plaintiff was entitled to, as a matter of right,
file a FAC as of  August 26, 2024, nine
court days prior to this hearing. 
Beckett filed the FAC on August 21,
2024, which was before the date on which Beckett’s opposition to the present
demurrer was due. Thus, Beckett’s filing the FAC renders the subject demurrer
moot. (See CCP § 472 subd. (a); JKC3H8,
supra, 221 Cal.App.4th at 477.)
III. Conclusion
Defendant John Grondorf’s Demurrer to Plaintiff’s Complaint is OVERRULED
as MOOT.
