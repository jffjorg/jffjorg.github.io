And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on Defendant John Grondorf's demurrer to Plaintiff Abigail Beckett's complaint. The Court finds that the filing of the first amended complaint (FAC) on August 21, 2024, renders the demurrer moot. The FAC was filed before the date on which Beckett's opposition to the demurrer was due, and therefore, the demurrer is OVERRULED as MOOT.
