And here is the English text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses several issues in the case between ADR Inc. (Plaintiff) and KAIO Construction Group, Inc. (Defendant). The court signed an amendment to the complaint in error, which attempted to change the name of the plaintiff. The judge intends to vacate this amendment as void.

The judge also ruled on Defendant's demurrer to the Complaint, which argued that the Plaintiff is not a duly licensed contractor and cannot seek enforcement of the contract. The judge found that this argument is misstated, as the statute only prohibits unlicensed contractors from performing certain acts, not from seeking enforcement of a contract.

Additionally, the judge addressed Defendant's request for judicial notice, which argued that the Plaintiff was a suspended corporation at the relevant times. However, the judge found that this contention was unsupported, as no evidence was presented to support this claim.

The judge ultimately overruled the demurrer, finding that the Complaint's only cause of action for breach of contract was proper. The judge also granted the request for judicial notice, but only insofar as it related to factual matters outside of the four corners of the pleading.
