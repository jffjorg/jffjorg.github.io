And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Kendra Olivera vs. Evelyn Castillo. The case involves a breach of contract and a claim of exemption by the defendant, Evelyn Castillo. The court has determined that Castillo's claim of exemption for the personal injury settlement proceeds is denied, in part. The court has also granted Castillo's claim of exemption for the proceeds received from insurance for the loss, damage, or destruction of a motor vehicle up to the amount of $7,500.00.

The court has calculated that Castillo will have sufficient funds from her personal injury settlement to pay the judgment owed to Olivera, plus interest, and will have approximately $24,572.27 left over. The court has determined that these funds are sufficient to support Castillo and her two daughters, and that the personal injury settlement proceeds do not qualify for a claim of exemption.

The court has ordered the case to be continued to January 21, 2025, for status of settlement of Castillo's personal injury claim. The court has also ordered Castillo to file and serve documentation regarding the status of settlement by January 10, 2025.
