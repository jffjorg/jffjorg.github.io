  Case Number:  22NWCV00618    Hearing Date:   January 21, 2025    Dept:  C Judgment Debtor’s Claim of Exemption is DENIED, in part.Judgment Debtor to give notice.BackgroundThis is an action for breach of contract. On July 21, 2022, Plaintiff Kendra Olivera (“Plaintiff” or “Judgment Creditor”) filed this action against Evelyn Castillo (“Defendant” or “Judgment Debtor”). The Complaint alleges Plaintiff paid Defendant the total of $27,861.00 based upon an agreement that Defendant would provide certain goods. The Complaint alleges Defendant never provided such goods and failed to pay Plaintiff back. Plaintiff sent a demand letter giving Defendant until March 8, 2022 to pay the amount in full. On March 7, 2022, the parties allegedly signed a contract stating Defendant would pay $1000 monthly and would provide lump sums to be paid in March, August, and December of 2022. Defendant allegedly paid $2000 for the months of March and May 2022, but failed to pay thereafter. The parties thereafter agreed to alternative payment arrangement, but Defendant failed to abide by that agreement. Defendant allegedly failed to make payments in accordance with the Contract.On October 24, 2022, the Court entered default judgment against Defendant in the amount of $25,291.00.On August 10, 2024, Defendant filed the instant claim of exemption, seeking to exempt all proceeds she received due to a car accident, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 704.101 and 704.140.On August 27, 2024, Judgement Creditor filed the instant notice of hearing on claim of exemption, opposing Judgement Debtor’s claim of exemption. Judgment Creditor claims that monies received from the Law Offices of Wiesman Piran and/or Infinity Insurance in relation to the car accident are not exempt.Legal StandardThe claim of exemption must be executed under oath and include the name and mailing address of the claimant, a description of the property claimed to be exempt, a financial statement as required by section 703.530, a citation of thestatute on which the claim is based, and a statement of facts necessary to support the claim. (Code Civ. Proc., § 703.520, subd. (b).) A financial statement is required where property is claimed as exempt pursuant to a provision exempting property to the extent necessary for the support of the judgment debtor and the spouse and dependents of the judgment debtor. (Code Civ. Proc., § 703.530, subd. (a).) The financial statement must be executed under oath by the judgment debtor and the debtor’s spouse unless the same are living separate and apart, and must include the following:(1) The name of the spouse of the judgment debtor;(2) The name, age, and relationship of all persons dependent upon the judgment debtor or the spouse of the judgment debtor for support;(3) All sources and the amounts of earnings and other income of the judgment debtor and the spouse and dependents of the judgment debtor;(4) A list of the assets of the judgment debtor and the spouse and dependents of the judgment debtor and the value of such assets; and(5) All outstanding obligations of the judgment debtor and the spouse and dependents of the judgment debtor.(Code Civ. Proc., § 703.530, subds. (b)(1)-(5), (c).)The hearing on the motion shall be held not later than 30 days from the date the notice of motion was filed with the court unless continued by the court for good cause. (Code Civ. Proc., § 703.570, subd. (a).)The claim of exemption is deemed controverted by the notice of opposition to the claim of exemption, and both shall be received in evidence. (Code Civ. Proc., § 703.580, subd. (c).) If no other evidence is offered, the court, if satisfied that sufficient facts are shown by the claim of exemption (including the financial statement if one is required) and the notice of opposition, may make its determination thereon. (Code Civ. Proc., § 703.580, subd. (c).) If not satisfied, the court shall order the hearing continued for the production of other evidence, oral or documentary. (Code Civ. Proc., § 703.580, subd. (c).)DiscussionThis matter was heard on October 15, 2024. (See 10/15/2024 Minute Order.) The Court granted the claim of exemption under Civil Code of Procedure section 704.010, subd. (a)(3) for any proceeds received from insurance for the loss, damage, or destruction of a motor vehicle up to the amount of $7,500.00. As to the claim under Civil Code of Procedure section 704.140, the Court held the following:Under CCP § 704.140, subd. (b), an award of damages or a settlement arising out of personal injury is exempt to the extent necessary for the support of the judgment debtor and the spouse and dependents of the judgement debtor. Castillo lists her monthly income as $1,051.00 from CalWorks. (Claim Exemption Form ¶ 2(d).) Castillo also receives $600.00 in food stamps. (Claim Exemption Form ¶ 4(b).) Castillo states that she pays $500.00 for rent, $150.00 for clothing, $150 for transportation and auto expenses, and $100 for laundry and cleaning. (Claim Exemption Form ¶¶ 4(a),(d),(i), (k).) Castillo also lists two children ages 11 and 10. (Financial Statement ¶ 1(b), (c).) Given that her monthly income is $1,051.00, the Court determines that the settlement is exempt to the extent necessary to support Castillo’s dependents. Olivera argues that Castillo will receive insurance proceeds of $100,000, consisting of $25,000.00 for each daughter and $50,000.00 for Castillo herself. The Court finds that the $50,000.00 for each daughter shall not be garnished. Olivera alleges the current amount owed is $29,733.13. Of the remaining $50,000.00 in insurance proceeds, the Court finds $7,500 is automatically exempt under CCP § 704.010(a)(3) leaving a remaining balance of $42,500 to pay the judgment of $24,291.40. After the $24,291.40 is paid, Castillo will have a remaining balance of $25,708.60 from her settlement funds. The Court determines that these funds, together with the daughters’ insurance proceeds, are sufficient to support Castillo and her two daughters.At the hearing, Olivera clarified that she is seeking $24,291.40 plus interest, which is $6.93 per day. As of today’s date, Olivera is seeking interest in the amount of $5,017.32, for a total of $30,308.22. At the hearing, Castillo stated that she has only received $15,000 in insurance proceeds so far, and that money has been placed into a trust. Plaintiff states her claim with her insurance company is still unresolved. Castillo appeared pro per at today’s hearing, but she states she is represented by an attorney in the personal injury action (Wiseman Pirian) who recommends that this matter be continued 90 days for status of settlement. Based on this, Judgment Debtor Evelyn Castillo’s Claim of Exemption is CONTINUED to January 21, 2025 at 9:30 a.m. in Dept. SE-C for status of settlement of Castillo’s personal injury claim. Judgment Debtor is ORDERED to file and serve documentation (e.g., a letter from counsel) regarding the status of settlement by January 10, 2025.(10/15/2024 Minute Order.)On January 7, 2025, Judgment Debtor submitted a declaration that over the past two years, she has paid Judgment Creditor $7,699. Attached to the initial demand letter stating Debtor owed $26,861. Judgment Debtor also attached a draft of the settlement distribution for her personal injury settlement stating that she would receive $55,559.63 from the Law Offices of Wiesman Pirian. Judgment Debtor requests the Court allow her to pay $19,162 to Judgment Creditor, the remaining balance without interest. Judgment Debtor argues she needs the remaining funds from the settlement to pay her living expenses and to support her children, as she has been unable to work.The Court initially finds that Judgment Debtor’s request to allow her to pay $19,162 without interest is inappropriate at this hearing.The Court finds that, with the proposed settlement amount of $55,559.63, Judgment Debtor will be able to pay the $30,308.22, plus interest to today’s date, for a total of $30,987.36. Judgment Debtor will have approximately $24,572.27 left of the personal injury settlement payout. Judgment Debtor submits no updated list of monthly expenses or other proof to show her personal injury proceeds are needed to cover her expenses, above those expenses covered by CalWorks and CalFresh income. The Court thus determines that these funds are sufficient to support Castillo and her two daughters, and the personal injury settlement payout does not qualify for a claim of exemption.According, the Court denies, in part, the Judgment Debtor’s Claim of Exemption as to the personal injury settlement proceeds. The Court reaffirms its holding that any claim of exemption as to any proceeds received from insurance for the loss, damage, or destruction of a motor vehicle up to the amount of $7,500.00 is granted.
