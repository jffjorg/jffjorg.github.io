Plaintiff requests monetary
sanctions against Defendant and its counsel of record, Erskine Law Group, in
the amount of $1,860.00 for Defendant’s failure to comply with this Court’s 12/4/23

Background 
On
November 16, 2022, Plaintiff filed his operative complaint against GM alleging three
causes of action: (1) Violation of Song-Beverly Act- Breach of Express
Warranty; (2) Violation of Song-Beverly Act- Breach of Implied Warranty; and
(3) Negligent Repair.  (See Complaint.)
On
September 19, 2023, when Plaintiff served Defendant with a Notice of Deposition
of Defendant’s Person(s) Most Qualified (“PMQ”) and Custodian(s) of Records for
October 17, 2023. Plaintiff’s Notice of Deposition identified with reasonable
particularity 4 matters for examination and 6 requests for document production.
Plaintiffs’ matters for examination included matters related to GM’s
pre-litigation analysis as to whether the Subject Vehicle should be
repurchased, all repairs and service performed on the Subject Vehicle. GM’s
policies and procedures for determining whether a vehicle qualifies for a
repurchase or replacement under the Song-Beverly Act, and GM’s training for evaluating
a pre-litigation repurchase request under the Song-Beverly Act. Plaintiff
requested in the email to which the deposition notice was attached that
Defendant’s counsel provide alternative dates by August 4, 2023, in the event
Defendant or its counsel were unavailable on the noticed date.  (Decl. of Thomas ¶2.)
On
October 4, 2023, Defendant served Objections to Plaintiff’s Notice of
Deposition and stated that no witness would be produced. The parties exchanged
meet and confer emails and letters, but still Defendant refused to produce a
witness. The deposition took place as scheduled on October 17, 2023, but Defendant
did not appear.  (Decl. of Thomas ¶3.)
On
October 30, 2023, Plaintiff filed a Motion to Compel Deposition of Defendant’s PMQ.
 Plaintiff’s Motion was heard on December
4, 2023, and this Court granted Plaintiff’s motion, ordering Defendant to
produce its PMQ for deposition on all noticed matters for examination by
January 15, 2024, and also ordered Defendant to pay sanctions to Plaintiff in
the amount of $2,310.00 by January 15, 2024. 
(12/4/23 Minute Order.)
Defendant
has not offered dates for this deposition to go forward, and no deposition has
taken place. Defendant has also not paid the sanctions it was ordered to pay.  (Decl. of Thomas ¶5).
Plaintiff
filed the instant motion on January 17, 2024. 
On February 7, 2024, Defendant filed its opposition.  Plaintiff filed his reply on February 16,
2024.
 
Legal
Standard
“If
a party filing a response to a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or
sampling under Sections 2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230, 2031.240, and 2031.280
thereafter fails to permit the inspection, copying, testing, or sampling in
accordance with that party’s statement of compliance, the demanding party may
move for an order compelling compliance.” 
(C.C.P. §2031.320(a).)
 
Motion
to Compel Compliance
This
Court granted Plaintiff’s
motion to compel Defendant to produce its PMQ for deposition and Defendant has
disobeyed this Court’s order.  Section
2023.030 of the Discovery Act specifically states that a misuse of the
discovery process occurs when a party disobeys “a court order to provide
discovery.”  (C.C.P. §2023.030(g); see
also Morrie London v. Dri-Honing Corporation et al. (2004), 117
Cal.App.4th 999, 1006.)  Moreover, the
Court has the inherent power to enforce and compel obedience with its orders.  (C.C.P. §128(a)(4); Fairfield v. Superior
Court of Los Angeles County (1966) 246 Cal. App.2d 113.)  Accordingly, “misuse of the discovery process
may result in the imposition of a variety of sanctions…including payment costs,
sanctions barring the introduction of certain evidence, sanctions deeming that
certain issues are determined against the offending party, and sanctions
terminating an action.”  (Karlson v.
Ford Motor
Co. (2006)
140 Cal.App.4th 1202, 1214.)
          Plaintiff’s motion to
compel compliance is granted.  Defendant
is ordered to produce its PMQ within 20 days of this ruling.
 
Sanctions
          “Except
as provided in subdivision (d), the court shall impose a monetary sanction
under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person,
or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel compliance
with a demand, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust.”  (C.C.P.
§2031.320(b).)
          Plaintiff’s request for sanctions
against Defendant and its counsel of record, Erskine Law Group, jointly and
severally, is granted.  Plaintiff’s
counsel declares his hourly rate is $450/hour, and he spent approximately four
hours drafting the instant motion, reviewing the opposition, and appearing for
the hearing, and his office incurred $60.00 in costs for filing the instant
motion.  (Decl. of Thomas ¶¶8-9.)  The Court calculates sanctions as follows:
$450.00/hour x 4 hours = $1,800.00
+ $60.00 = $1,860.00
          Defendant
and its counsel of record, Erskine Law group, is ordered to pay Plaintiff
sanctions in the amount of $1,860.00, jointly and severally, within 20 days.
 
Conclusion
Plaintiff’s motion to
compel Defendant to comply with this Court’s December 4, 2023, Ruling is
granted.  Defendant is ordered to comply
within 20 days of this ruling.
Defendant and its counsel
of record, Erskine Law Group, is ordered, jointly and severally, to pay
Plaintiff sanctions in the amount of $1,860.00, within 20 days.
Moving Party to give notice.
