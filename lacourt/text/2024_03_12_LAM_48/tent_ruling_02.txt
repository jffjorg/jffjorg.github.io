  CASE NO.: 22STCV09181
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING MOTION TO BE RELIEVED
  AS COUNSEL
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
March 12, 2024



 
Barnes
& Thornburg LLP, counsel of record for Defendant A New Journey Eating Disorder
Center (dba EDE CA at Santa Monica, LP), seeks to be relieved as counsel.  Counsel’s declaration states that Defendant is
no longer conducting any business or operations, and it has consented to counsel’s
withdrawal.  Counsel attempted to file a Substitution
form on February 8, 2024, but the court clerk rejected the form, stating that the
“Business can’t represent itself.”  No party
opposed the motion.
Absent
a showing of resulting prejudice, an attorney’s request for withdrawal should be
granted.  (People v. Prince (1968)
268 Cal.App.2d 398, 406.)  Counsel’s motion
complies with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362.  Trial has not yet been rescheduled, and there
is no prejudice to Defendant.
The
proposed order no longer reflects the correct upcoming hearing dates.  Before signing the order, the Court will correct
this information.
The
unopposed motion to be relieved is GRANTED and effective upon filing a proof of
service showing service of the signed Form MC-053 order and this order on Defendant
A New Journey Eating Disorder Center (dba EDE CA at Santa Monica, LP) and all parties
who have appeared.
However,
“a corporation cannot represent itself in a court of record either in propria persona
or through an officer or agent who is not an attorney.”  (Caressa Camille, Inc. v. Alcoholic Beverage
Control Appeals Bd. (2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 1094, 1101.)  Therefore, an Order to Show Cause Re: Failure
to Retain New Counsel for Defendant A New Journey Eating Disorder Center (dba EDE
CA at Santa Monica, LP) is scheduled for May 24, 2024 at 8:30 a.m. in Department
48 at Stanley Mosk Courthouse.  Defendant
A New Journey Eating Disorder Center (dba EDE CA at Santa Monica, LP) must retain
new counsel by that date or the Court will strike its answer and place it in default.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
 
        
Dated this 12th day of March 2024
