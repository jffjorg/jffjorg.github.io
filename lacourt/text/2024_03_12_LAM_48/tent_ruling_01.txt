  CASE NO.: 20STCV06887
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER DENYING MOTION TO COMPEL
  FURTHER RESPONSES
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
March 12, 2024



 
On November 14, 2023, Plaintiff
Clarence Harrell served a Deposition Notice of Varoojan Avedian and Requests for
Production of Documents (“RFPs”) on Defendant City of Pasadena.  (Anglin Decl. ¶ 3.)  Defendant asserted objection-only responses on
November 30, 2023.  (Anglin Decl. ¶ 4.)  After attempting to meet and confer, Plaintiff
filed a motion to compel further responses to the RFPs on February 13, 2024.
If
a deponent fails to produce any document that is specified in the deposition notice
or a deposition subpoena, the party seeking discovery may move the court for an
order compelling that production.  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2025.480, subd. (a).)  “This motion
shall be made no later than 60 days after the completion of the record of the deposition.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.480, subd. (b).)
Plaintiff
asserts that he “received the transcript of the deposition on December 15, 2023,
making this motion timely.”  (Motion at p.
2.)  However, Plaintiff is not seeking to
compel further answers to questions at the deposition, for which the transcript
would be required.  For the production of
documents at deposition, “the 60-day period during which a motion to compel must
be filed, begins to run when the deponent serves objections on the party.  At the time the objections are served, the record
of deposition is complete.”  (Rutledge
v. Hewlett-Packard Co. (2015) 238 Cal.App.4th 1164, 1192; see Unzipped Apparel,
LLC v. Bader (2007) 156 Cal.App.4th 123, 136 (Unzipped) [“The record
was complete as of the date set for the production, December 7, 2005, when Unzipped
received the objections.  Unzipped had 60
days thereafter, until February 6, 2006, to file a motion to compel.  It waited until March 1, 2006, which rendered
the motion untimely.”].)  The 60-day deadline
is mandatory.  (Unzipped, supra, 156
Cal.App.4th at p. 136.)
Here,
the record was complete as of November 30, 2023, when Defendant provided objections
to the RFPs.  Accordingly, Plaintiff’s motion
was due by January 29, 2024.  Plaintiff did
not file this motion until February 13, 2024—15 days after the deadline.  Plaintiff’s motion is untimely.
The
motion to compel further responses is DENIED.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
