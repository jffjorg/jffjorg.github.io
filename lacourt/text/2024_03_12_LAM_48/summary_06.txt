And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the demurrer filed by the defendant, Equity Residential Management, LLC, is sustained with leave to amend. The Judge finds that the plaintiffs have not alleged facts that show the defendant is a landlord under the Investigative Consumer Reporting Agencies Act (ICRAA), and therefore the first cause of action is not viable. The Judge also finds that the plaintiffs have not alleged facts that support an invasion of privacy claim, and the second cause of action is not viable. Additionally, the Judge finds that the plaintiffs have not alleged a controversy that would support a claim for declaratory relief. The Judge grants the motion to strike certain paragraphs of the complaint that seek injunctive relief and punitive damages, as these are not supported by the allegations in the complaint. The Judge gives the parties 30 days to amend their complaint and will review their responses before making a final ruling.
