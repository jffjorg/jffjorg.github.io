And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to Form Interrogatories, specifically Form Rog Nos. 12.1 and 17.1. The plaintiff had served the Form Interrogatories on the defendant, but the defendant had only provided partial and allegedly deficient responses. The plaintiff argued that the defendant's responses were incomplete and evasive, but the judge found that the defendant's responses were sufficient and did not require further action. The judge also found that the plaintiff had not shown how the defendant's responses were insufficient and that the burden of ascertaining identities from the medical records was substantially the same for both parties. The judge ordered the parties to meet and confer on the substantive issues before filing a joint statement, and the plaintiff's motion was denied.
