And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling granting the motion of Defendant's counsel, Barnes & Thornburg LLP, to be relieved as counsel. The motion was unopposed, and the court found that there was no prejudice to the Defendant. The Defendant is no longer conducting business or operations, and it has consented to counsel's withdrawal. The court ordered that the motion be granted and effective upon filing a proof of service showing service of the signed order and this order on the Defendant and all parties who have appeared.

However, the court noted that a corporation cannot represent itself in a court of record, and therefore scheduled an Order to Show Cause Re: Failure to Retain New Counsel for the Defendant. The Defendant must retain new counsel by May 24, 2024, or the Court will strike its answer and place it in default.
