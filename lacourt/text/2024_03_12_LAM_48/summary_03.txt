And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled on a motion for a protective order filed by Defendant Gloria Corrales. The motion seeks to make the protective order entered in a parallel action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (SDNY Action) the governing protective order in this action. The judge has denied the motion without prejudice, meaning that the parties can still agree to a different protective order. The judge notes that the SDNY protective order only governs discovery in New York and would not add any protection to discovery in this case in California. The judge also points out that the SDNY protective order exempts this action and would not restrict the parties' rights to use confidential information produced in this action.
