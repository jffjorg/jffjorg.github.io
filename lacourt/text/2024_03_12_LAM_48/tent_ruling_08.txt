 Case Number:  23STP03883    Hearing Date:   March 12, 2024    Dept:  48 The Court will not post a tentative
ruling.  Instead, the Court will hear oral argument.
 
The Court is particularly interested in the
parties addressing the following issues:
 
1. How Petitioner's interpretation of Labor Code
section 6314(c)'s use of subpoenas can be reconciled with (a)-(b)'s
requirements of consent or a warrant, and how that interpretation of (c) would
or would not supersede (a)-(b) and render (a)-(b) moot.  (See Opposition
at pp. 7-10.)
 
2. Why/how Petitioner has jurisdiction under
Government Code section 11180 with respect to Business and Professions Code
7451, which provides that certain app-based workers are independent contractors
"[n]otwithstanding any other provision of law, including, but not limited
to, the Labor Code."  (See Opposition at pp. 12-13; Reply at pp.
9-13.)
