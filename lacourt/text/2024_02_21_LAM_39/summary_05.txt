And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

**Case Management and Motions**

The judge has scheduled a case management conference and anti-SLAPP motion for March 27, 2024, at 8:30 a.m.

**Arbitration Compel Motion**

The judge has denied the Motion to Compel Arbitration filed by the defendants. The judge found that the defendants did not provide sufficient evidence to demonstrate that the plaintiff signed the arbitration agreement. The defendants are ordered to provide notice and file proof of the denial with the court.

**Special Motion to Dismiss**

The judge has ruled that the defendants' Special Motion to Dismiss under Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16 is flawed. The judge found that the defendants failed to provide sufficient evidence to support their claims and that the motion is premature. The judge also noted that the defendants did not provide a declaration from Christina Dake, which could have strengthened their case.

**Ministerial Exception**

The judge has ruled that the ministerial exception may be raised in this case, but only as a demurrer or motion for judgment on the pleadings, not as an anti-SLAPP motion. The judge also noted that the defendants did not provide authority for raising this issue in an anti-SLAPP motion.

**Next Steps**

The defendants are ordered to file a supplement to their anti-SLAPP motion addressing whether there was publicity concerning this issue and whether the ministerial exception may be raised on an anti-SLAPP motion. The plaintiff is ordered to file a supplemental opposition, and the defendants are ordered to file a supplemental reply.
