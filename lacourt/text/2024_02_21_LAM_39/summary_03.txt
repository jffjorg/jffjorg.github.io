And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted an ex parte application by the defendant, Guillermina Figueroa, to continue the trial date from March 19, 2024 to six months later. However, the court does not have an available trial date within the requested time period, so it has instead advanced and continued the final status conference and trial dates to March 7, 2025 and March 18, 2025, respectively. The parties must prepare and file joint trial documents by February 28, 2025, and identify all witnesses and exhibits they intend to use by the same date.
