And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Fredy Wembe v. Target Stores, Inc., et al. regarding Plaintiff's ex parte application to obtain contact information for certain witnesses. The court has granted the application and ordered Defendant to produce the last known contact information for Hillary Olsen, Guillermo Escareno, and Joshua Portillo within 20 days, unless Defendant's counsel agrees to accept service on their behalf. The court has also denied Plaintiff's request for contact information for all employees who worked at the same worksite during a specific time period, finding the request to be overbroad and unduly burdensome. The court has ordered the parties to meet-and-confer to schedule the depositions and determine whether the hearing on the motion for summary judgment and the trial date must be continued.
