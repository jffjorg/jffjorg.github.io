And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion for reconsideration in a case where the plaintiff, Darren Fuller, is suing Jimmy Lee Hampton and others. The judge has noticed its own motion for reconsideration whether to relate the unlawful detainer case (Case Number 23CMUD01926) to this case. The defendants have filed an opposition, stating that the unlawful detainer case is based on a lease signed on August 3, 2020, between Jimmy Hampton and Darren Fuller. The lease defines the landlord as Jimmy and Ida Hampton and the tenant as Darren Fuller. The judge has found that there is no basis to relate the two cases, as the unlawful detainer case is based on a lease between the parties. The judge has also noted that the plaintiff did not file a response on or before the deadline and did not provide a declaration to set an unlawful detainer case. Therefore, the judge has denied its own motion for reconsideration.
