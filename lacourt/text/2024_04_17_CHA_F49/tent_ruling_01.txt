City of Los Angeles, et al.     Case # 22STCV23442    LOS ANGELES SUPERIOR COURTNORTH VALLEY DISTRICTDEPARTMENT F49  APRIL 17, 2024   MOTION  TO COMPEL DEFENDANT PLAYCORE WISCONSIN INC.’S FURTHER RESPONSES TO PLAINTIFF’S DEMAND  FOR PRODUCTION, SET TWO; REQUEST FOR SANCTIONS Los  Angeles Superior Court Case # 22STCV23442  Motion filed:  12/26/23 MOVING  PARTY: Plaintiff Krystal  Shin, by and through her parent and guardian ad litem (“GAL”) You Sun Jang  (“Plaintiff”)RESPONDING  PARTY: Defendant PlayCore  Wisconsin Inc. (“Defendant” or “PlayCore”) NOTICE: ok  RELIEF REQUESTED: An  order from this Court compelling Defendant PlayCore to produce further  responses to Demand for Production No. 1, Set Two, without objection within 10  days, and imposing monetary sanctions in the amount of $2,400.00 against PlayCore  and its counsel jointly and severally. TENTATIVE RULING: The  motion is deemed MOOT. The monetary sanction is GRANTED IN PART. BACKGROUND This action arises from a  5-year-old Plaintiff’s injuries on February 20, 2022, allegedly caused by the  playground equipment located at a Los Angeles City Community Park, 11075  Foothill Boulevard in Lake View Terrace, California, 91432 (the “Park”). On July 20, 2022, Plaintiff  initiated the present action against Defendants City of Los Angeles and Does 1  through 20. The Complaint alleges the following causes of action: (1) dangerous  condition of public property, (2) negligence, and (3) strict liability. On September 16, 2022,  Defendant City of Los Angeles filed its Cross-Complaint against  Roes 1 to 20 for (1) apportionment of fault, (2) declaratory relief, and (3)  indemnification. On February 8,  2023, Plaintiff filed her Amendment to Complaint, substituting Defendant  PlayCore for Doe 1. On February  16, 2022, Defendant City of Los Angeles filed its Answer. Subsequently, on  March 13, 2023, Defendant PlayCore filed its Answer to the Complaint.              On November 28, 2023, Plaintiff  filed another Amendment to Complaint, substituting Defendant Evergreen  Environment Inc. for Doe 2.             On December 26, 2023, Plaintiff  filed the instant Motion to compel Defendant PlayCore to provide further  responses to Plaintiff’s Demand for Production, Set Two. Subsequently, PlayCore  filed its Opposition on April 4, 2024. On April 8, 2024, Plaintiff filed a  combined Reply.             On April 10, 2024, Plaintiff lodged  the Court with a Joint Report Re: Meet and Confer Conference to Resolve  Discovery Disputes (the “Joint Report”).            ANALYSIS Code of  Civil Procedure section 2030.310 subdivision (a) provides that “[o]n receipt of a response to a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or  sampling, the demanding party may move for an order compelling further  responses to the demand if the demanding party deems that any of the following  apply: (1) A statement of compliance with the demand is incomplete.  (2) A representation of inability to comply is inadequate, incomplete, or  evasive. (3) An objection in the response is without merit or too general.” “[T]he court  shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section  2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or  opposes a motion to compel further response to a demand, unless it finds that  the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that  other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd., (h).) A.     All Procedural Requirements Are Met 1.       45-Day Rule A motion must be brought within 45 days of service of verified responses  or supplemental verified responses unless the parties agree to an extension in  writing.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd., (c).)  Here,  Plaintiff received Defendant’s initial responses on November 27, 2023  (Nazdjanova Decl., ¶ 3), establishing January 11, 2024, as the deadline for  Plaintiff to submit a motion to compel further responses. The instant Motion  was filed on December 26, 2023, thereby meeting the established deadline.  Accordingly,  the Court concludes that the Motion was filed timely. 2.       Meet and Confer “A motion under  subdivision (a) shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under  Section 2016.040.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310,  subd., (b).)              Here,  on November 28, 2023, Plaintiff sent a meet and confer letter to Defendant  describing in detail the issues raised in the instant Motion and requesting  supplemental responses to be served by December 4, 2023. (Nazdjanova Decl., ¶  4.) No supplemental responses were served by the set deadline. (Id., ¶  5.) Plaintiff then extended the deadline to December 8, 2023. (Id., ¶  7.) Despite the efforts, Plaintiff attests that Defendant has refused to serve supplemental  responses at the time of filing the instant Motion. (Id., ¶ 8.)              Based on the above, the Court determines that the  meet and confer requirements have been satisfied. 3.      Separate StatementA  motion to compel further responses to requests for admissions must be  accompanied by a separate statement. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(a)(1).)  “A separate statement is a separate document filed and served with the  discovery motion that provides all the information necessary to understand each  discovery request and all the responses to it that are at issue.” (Cal. Rules  of Court, rule 3.1345(c).)Plaintiff has met the above  requirement by filing a separate statement that clearly explains the requests  for admissions at issue, Defendant PlayCore’s responses, and why further  responses are necessary. B.      Motion to Compel Further Responses to Demand  for Production, No. 1, Set Two Plaintiff’s Demand  for Production No. 1, Set Two, requests, “ALL DOCUMENTS identified by YOU in  response to the Form Interrogatory No. 17.1 concurrently served upon YOU.” (Nazdjanova  Decl., Ex. “A.”)Here, Defendant argues that the instant Motion is moot,  as it has filed verified supplemental responses to discovery on April 1, 2024,  “including Requests for Production, Set Two at issue in this Motion.” (Opp’n.,  at 2.) Furthermore, Defendant maintains that “in reviewing ... all its  responses, Defendant has discovered that three additional ages were  inadvertently not included in the previous production. Defendant will promptly  amend its production to include these three pages.” (Ibid.) Plaintiff  concedes that PlayCore served these supplemental responses to Demand for  Production, Set Two, on April 1, 2024, at 4:16 p.m. (4/10/24 Joint Report, ¶  9.) Furthermore, on April 5, 2024, at 3:49 p.m., PlayCore served Amended  Supplemental Reponses to Demand for Production, Set Two.” (Id., ¶ 12.) Additionally,  Plaintiff has not raised the issue of the insufficiency of Defendant’s  supplemental responses in either the Joint Report or their Reply. Accordingly,  the Court determines that Plaintiff’s request to compel supplemental responses  has been rendered moot for the purpose of this Motion. Next, the  Court will proceed to assess Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions.C.     Monetary Sanctions Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure  section 2031.300 subdivision (c), the  court shall impose a monetary sanction against any party, person, or attorney  who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to a demand  for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling, unless it finds that the one  subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other  circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust. Additionally, “in  lieu of or in addition to this sanction, the court may impose a monetary  sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010).” (Code Civ. Proc.,  § 2031.310, subd. (h).)  Here, Defendant asserts that its initial responses indicated  it had no information to admit or deny the underlying Requests for Admissions.  (Opp’n., at 4.) However, Defendant has failed to substantiate any substantial  justification as to the insufficiency or non-compliance of its initial  responses. Consequently, a monetary sanction is mandatory, in accordance with  Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.310 subdivision (h). Plaintiff  has filed three concurrent motions, all sharing the underlying discovery  Request for Admission, Set One. To avoid redundancy and in view of the totality  of the circumstances, the Court finds that the total and reasonable amount of  attorney’s fees and costs incurred for the instant Motion is $400.00,  calculated at $400.00 per hour for one hour.              Therefore, the Court GRANTS IN PART  the Request for Monetary Sanctions. CONCLUSION Plaintiff’s  Motion to Compel Defendant PlayCore’s Further Responses  to Demand for Production, Set Two, is deemed MOOT. Plaintiff’s Request for Monetary Sanctions is  GRANTED IN PART. Defendant PlayCore’s counsel of record is  ordered to pay $400.00 monetary sanctions to Plaintiff’s counsel within 10  days. Moving party to give notice.  ____________________________________________________________________________________Dept.

(“Defendant” or “PlayCore”)  NOTICE: ok    RELIEF REQUESTED: An  order from this Court compelling Defendant PlayCore to produce further  responses to Plaintiff’s Request for Admissions, Set One, Nos. 9, 12, 15, 16,  17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 24, 27, 28, 29, 30, and 32 without objection within 10  days, and imposing monetary sanctions in the amount of $4,400.00 against PlayCore  and its counsel jointly and severally.   TENTATIVE RULING: The  motion is deemed MOOT. The monetary sanction is GRANTED IN PART.   BACKGROUND   This action arises from a  5-year-old Plaintiff’s injuries on February 20, 2022, allegedly caused by the  playground equipment located at a Los Angeles City Community Park, 11075  Foothill Boulevard in Lake View Terrace, California, 91432 (the “Park”).   On July 20, 2022, Plaintiff  initiated the present action against Defendants City of Los Angeles and Does 1  through 20. The Complaint alleges the following causes of action: (1) dangerous  condition of public property, (2) negligence, and (3) strict liability.   On September 16, 2022,  Defendant City of Los Angeles filed its Cross-Complaint against  Roes 1 to 20 for (1) apportionment of fault, (2) declaratory relief, and (3)  indemnification.   On February 8,  2023, Plaintiff filed her Amendment to Complaint, substituting Defendant  PlayCore for Doe 1.   On February  16, 2022, Defendant City of Los Angeles filed its Answer. Subsequently, on  March 13, 2023, Defendant PlayCore filed its Answer to the Complaint.                On November 28, 2023, Plaintiff  filed another Amendment to Complaint, substituting Defendant Evergreen  Environment Inc. for Doe 2.               On December 26, 2023, Plaintiff  filed the instant Motion to compel Defendant PlayCore to provide further  responses to Plaintiff’s Requests for Admissions, Set One. Subsequently, PlayCore  filed its Opposition on April 2, 2024. On April 8,  2024, Plaintiff filed a combined Reply.                On April 10, 2024, Plaintiff lodged  the Court with a Joint Report Re: Meet and Confer Conference to Resolve  Discovery Disputes (the “Joint Report”).   ANALYSIS   Where  responses to requests for admissions have been timely served but are deemed  deficient by the requesting party, the requesting party may move for an order  compelling the responding party’s further response.  (Code Civ. Proc., §  2033.290, subd. (a).)     “The court  shall impose a monetary sanction … against any party, person, or attorney who  unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a further response … unless  it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial  justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction  unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.290, subd., (d).)   A.     All Procedural Requirements Are Met   1.       45-Day Rule   A motion must be brought within 45 days of service of verified responses  or supplemental verified responses unless the parties agree to an extension in writing.   (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.290, subd., (c).)    Here,  Plaintiff received Defendant’s initial responses on November 27, 2023  (Nazdjanova Decl., ¶ 3), establishing January 11, 2024, as the deadline for  Plaintiff to submit a motion to compel further responses. The instant Motion  was filed on December 26, 2023, thereby meeting the established deadline.    Accordingly,  the Court concludes that the Motion was filed timely.   2.       Meet and Confer   A party moving to compel further responses to requests for admissions  must submit a declaration stating facts demonstrating a good faith and  reasonable effort to informally resolve all issues raised by the motion.   (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.290(b).)                Here,  on November 28, 2023, Plaintiff sent a meet and confer letter to Defendant  describing in detail the issues raised in the instant Motion and requesting  supplemental responses to be served by December 4, 2023. (Nazdjanova Decl., ¶  4.) No supplemental responses were served by the set deadline. (Id., ¶  5.) Plaintiff then extended the deadline to December 8, 2023. (Id., ¶  7.) Despite the efforts, Plaintiff attests that Defendant has refused to serve  supplemental responses at the time of filing the instant Motion. (Id., ¶  8.)                Based on the above, the Court determines that the  meet and confer requirements have been satisfied.   3.      Separate Statement A  motion to compel further responses to requests for admissions must be  accompanied by a separate statement. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(a)(1).)  “A separate statement is a separate document filed and served with the  discovery motion that provides all the information necessary to understand each  discovery request and all the responses to it that are at issue.” (Cal. Rules  of Court, rule 3.1345(c).) Plaintiff has met the above  requirement by filing a separate statement that clearly explains the requests  for admissions at issue, Defendant PlayCore’s responses, and why further  responses are necessary.   B.      Motion to Compel Further Responses to  Request for Admissions   Plaintiff  brings this Motion under the authority of Code of Civil Procedure section  2033.290 subdivision (a). (Mot., at 5.)   Here,  Defendant argues that the instant Motion is moot, as it has filed verified  supplemental responses to discovery on April 1, 2024. (Opp’n., at 2.)  Furthermore, Defendant maintains that its supplemental responses have “provided  detailed and expanded responses ... including admissions where appropriate and  specifying where it still lacks sufficient information to respond.” (Id.,  at 4.)   Plaintiff  concedes that PlayCore served these supplemental responses to Request for  Admissions, Set One, on April 1, 2024, at 4:16 p.m. (4/10/24 Joint Report, ¶  9.) Additionally, Plaintiff has not raised the issue of  the insufficiency of Defendant’s supplemental responses in either the Joint  Report or their Reply.    Accordingly,  the Court determines that Plaintiff’s request to compel supplemental responses  has been rendered moot for the purpose of this Motion.   Next, the  Court will proceed to assess Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions. C.     Monetary Sanctions   Pursuant  to Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.290 subdivision (d), monetary sanctions  are mandatory against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes  or opposes a motion to compel further response, unless the Court finds that the  one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other  circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.   Defendant  states that “it had substantial justification for its initial responses and has  gone beyond what was required by providing comprehensive supplemental  responses.” (Opp’n., at 5.) However, with regard to why the new information was  not available during its initial responses, Defendant’s contention merely  presents that “[i]n attempting to resolve this matter in a good faith attempt,  Defendant has gone above and beyond by reviewing all of the requests providing  supplemental responses on its own initiative.” (Ibid.)    The  responding party is required to make a reasonable investigation of the facts  before answering items. (See Wimberly v. Derby Cycle Corp. (1997) 56  Cal.App.4th 618, 634. [“...where the party lacked personal knowledge but had available  sources of information and failed to make a reasonable investigation to  ascertain the facts, such failure will justify an award of expenses.”])   Defendant’s  reliance on “reviewing all of the requests” indicates that it had sufficient  documents and information within its possession to provide a “complete and  straightforward” answer as the “information reasonably available” during its  initial response (See Code Civ. Procs., § 2033.220), which would have avoided  the expenses incurred by Plaintiff in making the Motion. Furthermore, Plaintiff  correctly points out that a code-compliant answer must state that a reasonable  inquiry concerning the matter in the particular request has been made, and that  the information known or readily obtainable is insufficient to enable that  party to admit the matter. (See generally Pl.’s Separate Statement.)   Consequently,  the Court determines that Defendant has failed to substantiate its claim of substantial  justification.   Utilizing  a lodestar approach, and in view of the totality of the circumstances, the  Court finds that the total and reasonable amount of attorney’s fees and costs  incurred for the instant Motion is $1,000.00, calculated at $400.00 per hour  for 2.5 hours.               Therefore,  the Court GRANTS IN PART the Request for Monetary Sanctions.   CONCLUSION   Plaintiff’s  Motion to Compel Defendant PlayCore to provide further  responses to Requests for Admissions is deemed MOOT.   Plaintiff’s Request for Monetary Sanctions is  GRANTED IN PART.   Defendant PlayCore’s counsel of record is  ordered to pay $1,000.00 monetary sanctions to Plaintiff’s counsel within 10  days.   Moving party to give notice.   ______________________________________________________________________________________________________   Dept.

(2) An exercise of the option to  produce documents under Section 2030.230 is unwarranted or the required  specification of those documents is inadequate. (3) An objection to an  interrogatory is without merit or too general.”    “The court  shall impose a monetary sanction … against any party, person, or attorney who  unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a further response … unless  it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial  justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction  unjust.” (Code Civ.

The instant Motion  was filed on December 26, 2023, thereby meeting the established deadline.    Accordingly,  the Court concludes that the Motion was filed timely.   2.       Meet and Confer   “A motion under subdivision (a) shall be  accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040.”  (Code Civ.

(Nazdjanova Decl., ¶  4.) No supplemental responses were served by the set deadline. (Id., ¶  5.) Plaintiff then extended the deadline to December 8, 2023. (Id., ¶  7.) Despite the efforts, Plaintiff attests that Defendant has refused to serve supplemental  responses at the time of filing the instant Motion. (Id., ¶ 8.)                Based on the above, the Court determines that the  meet and confer requirements have been satisfied.   3.      Separate Statement A  motion to compel further responses to requests for admissions must be  accompanied by a separate statement. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(a)(1).)  “A separate statement is a separate document filed and served with the  discovery motion that provides all the information necessary to understand each  discovery request and all the responses to it that are at issue.” (Cal. Rules  of Court, rule 3.1345(c).) Plaintiff has met the above  requirement by filing a separate statement that clearly explains the requests  for admissions at issue, Defendant PlayCore’s responses, and why further  responses are necessary.   B.      Motion to Compel Further Responses to Form  Interrogatories, No. 17.1, Set Two   Plaintiff  brings this Motion, under the authority of Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.290  subdivision (a), to compel Defendant PlayCore’s further responses to Form  Interrogatories No. 17.1, Set Two, as it relates to Requests for Admissions  (“RFA”) Nos. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14, 22, 25, 26, 31 and 33 without  objection within 10 days. (Mot., at 5.)   Form  Interrogatories No. 17.1 asks, “Is your response to each request for admission  served with these interrogatories an unqualified admission? If not, for each  response that is not an unqualified admission: (a) state the number of the  request; (b) state all facts upon which you base your response; (4) state the  name, ADDRESSES, and telephone numbers of all PERSONS who have knowledge of  these facts; and (d) identify all DOCUMENTS and other tangible things that  support your response and state the name, ADDRESS, and telephone number of the  PERSON who has each DOCUMENT or thing.” (Nazdjanova Decl., Ex. “A.”) Here, Defendant argues that the instant Motion is moot,  as it has filed verified supplemental responses to discovery on April 1, 2024,  “including the Form Interrogatory, No. 17 in relation to the Requests for  Admissions at issue in this Motion.” (Opp’n., at 2.) Furthermore, Defendant  maintains that “[t]hese  supplemental responses included admissions and indicated where Defendant still  lacked sufficient information to respond. In the Supplemental Responses to  Requests for Admission, RFAs Nos. 9, 12, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 24, 27  and 28 have been admitted and thus no response to FROG 17.1 is necessary. As a  result, Plaintiff’s motion on those RFAs are now moot. As to the remainder of  the RFAs relevant to FROG  17.1, Defendant has supplemented its responses.” (Id., at 2-3.) Plaintiff  concedes that PlayCore served these supplemental responses to Form  Interrogatories, Set Two, on April 1, 2024, at 4:16 p.m. (4/10/24 Joint Report,  ¶ 9.) Additionally, Plaintiff has not raised the issue of the insufficiency of  Defendant’s supplemental responses in either the Joint Report or their Reply.   Accordingly,  the Court determines that Plaintiff’s request to compel supplemental responses  has been rendered moot for the purpose of this Motion.   Next, the  Court will proceed to assess Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions. C.     Monetary Sanctions   Pursuant  to Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.300 subdivision (d), monetary sanctions  are mandatory against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes  or opposes a motion to compel further response, unless the Court finds that the  one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other  circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.   Here,  Defendant asserts that its initial responses indicated it had no information to  admit or deny due to its lack of full and complete knowledge of the detailed  matters covered in the Form Interrogatories. (Opp’n., at 4.) However, Defendant  has failed to substantiate any substantial justification as to the  insufficiency or non-compliance of its initial responses. Consequently, a  monetary sanction is mandatory, in accordance with Code of Civil Procedure  section 2030.300 subdivision (d).   Plaintiff  has filed three concurrent motions, all sharing the underlying discovery  Request for Admission, Set One. To avoid redundancy and in view of the totality  of the circumstances, the Court finds that the total and reasonable amount of  attorney’s fees and costs incurred for the instant Motion is $400.00,  calculated at $400.00 per hour for one hour.               Therefore,  the Court GRANTS IN PART the Request for Monetary Sanctions.   CONCLUSION   Plaintiff’s  Motion to Compel Defendant PlayCore’s Further Responses  to Form Interrogatories, No. 17.1, Set Two, is deemed MOOT.   Plaintiff’s  Request for Monetary Sanctions is GRANTED IN PART.   Defendant  PlayCore’s counsel of record is ordered to pay $400.00 monetary sanctions to  Plaintiff’s counsel within 10 days.   Moving  party to give notice.
