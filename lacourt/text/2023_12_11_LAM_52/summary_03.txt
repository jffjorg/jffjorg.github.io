And here is a summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling is that Plaintiff Forrest C. Bennett's motion for attorney fees and costs is denied without prejudice. The reason for this is that the motion is premature, as the plaintiff has not yet prevailed in the action. The judge notes that the plaintiff has entered into a settlement agreement, but the court has not yet entered a judgment and the plaintiff has not filed a notice of settlement or a motion to enforce the settlement. The judge orders the plaintiff to file a notice of settlement on mandatory Judicial Council of California form CM-200 forthwith and may renew the motion after filing a notice of settlement.
