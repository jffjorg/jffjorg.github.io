  Case Number:  22STCV34822    Hearing Date:   December 11, 2023    Dept:  52 Defendants County of Los Angeles and Los Angeles
County Flood Control District’s Demurrer to Third Amended Complaint
Defendants County of Los
Angeles and Los Angeles County Flood Control District demur to the first three
causes of action for negligence alleged by plaintiff Perry Lazar, as an
individual and as trustee of the Plone Trust’s third amended complaint.
Standard of Review on Demurrer
“On demurrer, a court must
accept properly pleaded facts as true, but a demurrer does not admit the
plaintiff’s contentions nor conclusions of law or fact.”  (Czajkowski v. Haskell & White, LLP (2012)
208 Cal.App.4th 166, 173.)  Courts “will
not close their eyes to situations where a complaint contains allegations of
fact inconsistent with attached documents, or allegations contrary to facts
which are judicially noticed.” (Del E. Webb Corp. v. Structural Materials
Co. (1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 593, 604 (Del E. Webb).)  If the plaintiff alleges facts contradicted by
exhibits attached to the complaint, the facts stated in the exhibits will be
given precedence.  (Moran v. Prime
Healthcare Management, Inc. (2016) 3 Cal.App.5th 1131, 1145–1146; Barnett
v. Fireman’s Fund Ins. Co. (2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 500, 505.)  The plaintiff is also barred from alleging
facts contradicted by judicially noticed recorded documents.  (See Jenkins v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.
(2013) 216 Cal.App.4th 497, 536, disapproved on other grounds by Yvanova v.
New Century Mortgage Corp. (2016) 62 Cal.4th 919, 939, fn. 13 (Yvanova);
Poseidon Development, Inc. v. Woodland Lane Estates, LLC (2007) 152
Cal.App.4th 1106, pp. 1117–1118.)
Requests for Judicial Notice
Defendants County of Los
Angeles and Los Angeles County Flood Control District request judicial notice
of four exhibits.  The first exhibit is
plaintiff’s request for judicial notice filed in support of his opposition to defendants’
demurrer to the second amended complaint. 
(Request for Judicial Notice (RJN), Ex. 1.)  The second exhibit includes declarations by
Odalis Suarez and Perry Lazar submitted in support of their motion for summary
judgment in related case No. 21STCV19845. 
(RJN, Ex. 2.)  Both are court
records subject to judicial notice under Evidence Code section 452(d)(1).  Moreover, “courts may properly take judicial
notice of a party’s earlier pleadings and positions as well as established
facts from both the same case and other cases.”  (Cantu v. Resolution Trust Corp.
(1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 857, 877.)  “[T]he
plaintiff may not plead facts that contradict the facts or positions that
the plaintiff pleaded in earlier actions or suppress facts that prove the
pleaded facts false.”  (Ibid.)
The third exhibit is the
declaration of David S. Gould in support of Crescenta Valley Water District’s
opposition to plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment in related case No.
21STCV19845.  It is also a court record
subject to judicial notice.  (Evid. Code,
§ 452(d)(1).)  But because it was “filed on
behalf of [an] adverse party,” the court cannot rely on it “to contradict the
allegations and contentions of the plaintiff.” 
(Del E. Webb, supra, 123 Cal.App.593 at p. 605.)  The court therefore will only take judicial
notice of its existence and legal effects and not the truth of its contents.  (See Williams v. Wraxall (1995) 33
Cal.App.4th 120, 130, fn. 7; Gilmore v. Superior Court (1991) 230
Cal.App.3d 416, 418.)
The fourth exhibit, a portion
of the Los Angeles County General Index of Grantors, is an official act of a government entity and recorded
real property record subject to judicial notice.  (Evid. Code, § 452, subd. (c); see Yvanova, supra, 62 Cal.4th at p. 924, fn. 1.)
            The court grants defendants’ requests for judicial
notice Nos. 1-4.  
            Plaintiff makes seven requests for judicial notice.  All seven requests pertain to court records
subject to judicial notice for their existence and legal effects.  
            The court grants plaintiff’s requests for judicial
notice Nos. 1-7.  
Summary of Allegations
            This case arises from a dispute over real property
identified as Parcel 5867-011-036 (parcel 36). 
(3AC, ¶ 4.)  Plaintiff alleges the
County created that parcel “sometime between 1960 and 1980.”  (Ibid.)  In 1966, part of parcel 36 was conveyed to
defendant Crescenta Valley Water District (CVWD) via a corporation grant
deed.  (Id., Ex. 4.)  The deed shows the grantor conveyed two
interests in real property: “parcel 1,” a fee interest in a portion of the
subject property identified by metes and bounds, and “parcel 2,” “an easement
for ingress and egress” and other purposes over part of the same parcel.  (Id., Ex. 4, p. 2.)  Plaintiff alleges that when the County
created its parcel maps, it did not “indicate, show, or include” the part of
parcel 36 granted to CVWD “without proper land division.”  (3AC, ¶ 4.)  

            In 1980, the County sold parcel 36 via tax deed to Bruce
Cook and William Devin.  (3AC, ¶ 4, Ex. 5.)  The tax deed purports to transfer the entire
parcel without accounting for the portion previously conveyed to CVWD.  (Ibid.)   
In 2004, plaintiff purchased
parcel 36.  (3AC, ¶ 5.)  When he did so, his title insurance company
“did not identify any fee interest owned by CVWD.”  (3AC, ¶ 11.) 
Plaintiff attempted to sell the property in 2019 but faced problems
related to title and the property’s legal description.  (Ibid.)  Plaintiff filed an action against his title
insurance company.  (3AC, ¶ 12.)  
Plaintiff alleges, “[I]n or
about late December of 2021” he “discovered CVWD claimed a fee interest in
approximately some 85,000 square feet of” parcel 36.  (3AC, ¶ 12.) 
Plaintiff alleges he did not know about CVWD’s claimed fee interest due
to: “a) improper division of the proper[ty] by way of a metes and bounds
description that fell outside of the chain of title, b) the County’s improper
preparation and investigation in the creation of the Parcel Map and survey of
Parcel 36, (c) Defendants’ failure to maintain property records as required by
statute, (d) Defendants’ … failure to properly index the 1966 corporate deed by
the county recorder and (e) Defendant’s transfer of Parcel 36 to Devin and
Cook.”  (3AC, ¶ 13.)  Plaintiff further alleges he “is unable to
sell the property … until the issues regarding the ownership and title to the
property are resolved, CVWD removes the cloud on title and defendant County
establishes how Parcel 36 was created and the basis of the transfer of said
land to Cook.”  (3AC, ¶ 17.)
Statute of Limitations
The statute of limitations
bars plaintiff’s first, second, and third causes of action for negligence.  A demurrer should be sustained where “the
complaint shows on its face that the statute [of limitations] bars the
action.”  (E-Fab, Inc. v. Accountants, Inc. Services (2007) 153
Cal.App.4th 1308, 1315.)  The
court must determine which statute of limitations applies and when the claim
accrued.  (Id. at p. 1316.)  The statute of limitations for negligence is
two years.  (CCP § 335.1.)  Plaintiff filed this action on November 1,
2022.  The first three causes of action
are therefore untimely if they accrued before November 1, 2020.
Plaintiff
alleges three causes of action for negligence. 
First, plaintiff alleges defendants are liable for failing to
investigate and prepare accurate parcel maps (3AC, ¶¶ 24-32) and failing to
maintain records and surveys for the division of land (3AC, ¶¶ 33-38).  Second, plaintiff alleges “negligent transfer
of property that the County did not own.” 
(3AC, p. 16, ¶¶ 40-45.)  Third,
plaintiff alleges negligent “failure to abide by the Code of Ordinances for the
division of land.”  (3AC, p. 18, ¶¶
46-56.)
All
three causes of action for negligence accrued no later than (a) 2004, based on
constructive notice, or (b) 2011, based on actual notice.  They arise from the same injury: CVWD claims
an ownership interest in part of parcel 36, which constitutes a cloud on
plaintiff’s title.  (3AC, ¶¶ 27-32, 38, 42-45,
49-50, 55-56.)    Plaintiff suffered
injury in 2004 when he bought the property (3AC, ¶ 5) because the seller
purported to sell a fee interest to the entire parcel 36 despite not owning the
entire parcel.  Any subsequent negligence
in failing to prepare accurate parcel maps or comply with requirements for
dividing land could not have harmed plaintiff. 
Correcting any such negligence after the sale would be too late to
change plaintiff’s interest in the property or remove the cloud on his
title.  The second cause of action,
meanwhile, expressly alleges the County negligently transferred property it did
not own.  The County last transferred the
subject property in 1980.  Any cause of
action against the County arising from that transfer therefore accrued in
1980.  
Plaintiff relies on the
delayed discovery rule.  To do so, a
plaintiff “must specifically plead facts to show (1) the time and manner of
discovery and (2) the inability to have made earlier discovery despite reasonable
diligence.”  (Fox v. Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc. (2005) 35 Cal.4th 797, 808.)  The discovery rule does not apply here
because recorded real property instruments gave plaintiff constructive
knowledge of “information which would put a reasonable person on inquiry” (Kline
v. Turner (2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 1369, 1374) of these causes of action
against defendants.
A.
Constructive Notice from Recorded Deed
Subsequent purchasers have constructive
notice of the contents of recorded real property instruments.  (Civ. Code, § 1213.)  “The recordation of real property conveyances
gives constructive notice to subsequent purchasers and is the equivalent of
actual notice.”  (City of Anaheim v.
Metropolitan Water Dist. of Southern Cal. (1978) 82 Cal.App.3d 763,
771.)  As a result, “ ‘knowledge of [a
conveyance’s] contents is conclusively presumed.’ ”  (Citizens for Covenant Compliance v.
Anderson (1995) 12 Cal.4th 345, 355.)
The recorded conveyances’
contents show that the creation of parcel 36 and the sale by tax deed to Cook
and Devin in 1980 failed to account for the fee interest transferred to CVWD in
1966.  The corporation grant deed
recorded in 1966 shows conveyance of a fee interest in real property (as well
as an easement) to CVWD.  (3AC, Ex. 4, p.
2 [“parcel 1”].)  The tax deed recorded
in 1980 shows conveyance of a fee interest in real property that included some
of the same land already conveyed to CVWD. 
This inconsistency constitutes information that would put a reasonable
person on inquiry that the parcel maps were inaccurate, that defendants failed
to maintain records and surveys for the division of land, that the County
purported to transfer land it did not own, and that defendants violated the
Code of Ordinances for the division of land. 

Plaintiff relies on the rule
that “a bona fide purchaser of real property has constructive notice of only
those matters that could be located by a diligent title search.”  (Dyer v. Martinez (2007) 147
Cal.App.4th 1240, 1243 (Dyer).)  In
his opposition, plaintiff inaccurately adds to this quote the words “at the
time of purchase.”  (Opp., p. 12.)  This rule applies when a recorded document
has not “been properly indexed.”  (Dyer,
at p. 1246.)  
The third amended complaint alleges
“the 1966 deed is outside of the chain of title and improperly indexed.”  (3AC, ¶ 8.) 
This allegation, however, is contradicted by a judicially noticed
document, namely a portion of the Los Angeles County General Index of Grantors,
which shows that the 1966 deed was in fact properly indexed.  (RJN Exh. 4.)
The third amended complaint further
alleges that the 1966 grant deed to CVWD was not found in an investigation by
First American Title Insurance Company in 2004 (¶ 8(a), Ex. 7), an
investigation by Lawyer’s Title Insurance Company in 2010 (¶ 8(b), Ex. 8), an
investigation by Old Republic Title Company (¶ 8(c), Ex. 9), and “[a]
historical review of the County of Los Angeles Grantor/Grantee index and County
recorders.”  Whether third party title
insurance companies actually found the 1966 grant deed, however, is not
relevant to the issue of constructive notice. 
What matters is whether the deed could have been found in a reasonable
inquiry.  
Moreover, the third amended
complaint omits a 2019 preliminary title report that plaintiff himself
requested judicial notice of in opposing the prior demurrer.  (Def. RJN Ex. 1, pp. 7-8, SAC in case No. 20PSCV00596,
Ex. 9.)  That report states a title
insurance policy would exclude “[a]n easement for ingress and egress, pipelines
and miscellaneous purposes as set forth in the document recorded November 29,
1966 as Instrument No. 2368 of Official Records.”  (Id., p. 3, ¶ 6.)  The “document” referred to in the report is
the 1966 deed.  (See 3AC, Ex. 4, pp. 1,
3.)  In that deed, the grantor
transferred both that easement (id., p. 2 [“Parcel 2”]) and a fee
interest in a “portion of Lot 2, tract 4121” (ibid. [“Parcel 1”]).  The preliminary title report therefore shows
the instrument conveying the fee interest to CVWD was within the property’s
chain of title or otherwise could have been located by a diligent title search.  Accordingly, plaintiff had constructive
notice of the contents of the 1966 deed and the 1980 deed and the inconsistency
between them from which the first three causes of action arise.
Plaintiff’s reliance on Dyer
is unpersuasive.  The language
plaintiff quotes from Dyer pertains to the bona fide purchaser doctrine,
not the concept of constructive notice in general.  Dyer does not discuss any statute of
limitations.  The doctrine of “bona fide
purchaser” is a substantive rule on who has good title to property and the
remedies available between parties disputing title.  (Civ. Code, § 1107 [“Every grant of an estate in real property is conclusive against
the grantor, also against every one subsequently claiming under him, except a
purchaser or incumbrancer who in good faith and for a valuable consideration
acquires a title or lien by an instrument that is first duly recorded”]; First
Bank v. East West Bank (2011) 199 Cal.App.4th 1309, 1313 [“a
subsequent purchaser obtains priority for a real property interest by (1)
acquiring the interest as a bona fide purchaser for valuable consideration
with neither actual knowledge nor constructive notice”]; Homestead
Savings v. Darmiento (1991) 230 Cal.App.3d 424, 436 [“a party has no right
to set aside a trustee’s deed as void against a bona fide purchaser for value”].)  
Whether plaintiff was a bona
fide purchaser when he purchased the property in 2004 only affects his
substantive rights in the real property. 
It is irrelevant to whether his causes of action for negligence against
the demurring defendants are barred by the statute of limitations.  Assuming plaintiff was a bona fide purchaser
without notice at the time of purchase, that would not change whether he had
constructive notice of the 1966 deed more than two years before bringing this
action.
B. Notice in 2011
            Documents subject to judicial notice also show plaintiff
had actual notice of the 1966 grant deed in 2011.  In plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment in
related case No. 21STCV19845 (Def. RJN, Ex. 2), the declarations of Odalis
Suarez and plaintiff Perry Lazar state that in or about 2011 (id., Suarez
Decl. ¶ 27; Lazar Decl., ¶ 22), an engineer working for CVWD “provided a copy
of a Corporate deed dated 1966” to Suarez (Suarez Decl., ¶ 29; Lazar Decl., ¶
24).  As discussed above, that deed conveyed
both “Parcel 1”, a “portion of Lot 2, Tract 4121”, and “Parcel 2,” “[a]n
easement for ingress and egress and pipelines and miscellaneous purposes over a
portion of said Lot 2, Tract 4121.” 
(3AC, Ex. 4, p. 2.)  That copy of
the deed gave plaintiff actual notice of CVWD’s fee interest in 2011.  At the latest, therefore, plaintiff’s claims
for negligence accrued 10 years before he filed this action.  His first three causes of action are
untimely.    
Sovereign Immunity  
The first, second, and third causes of action for
negligence also fail due to sovereign immunity. 
“[A]ll government tort liability must be based on statute.”  (County of San Bernardino v. Superior
Court (2022) 77 Cal.App.5th 1100, 1107.)  “ ‘[S]overeign immunity is the rule in
California; governmental liability is limited to exceptions specifically set
forth by statute.’ ”  (Id. at p.
1108.)
Plaintiff
argues defendants are liable under Government Code section 815.2(a), which
provides, “A public entity is liable for injury proximately caused by an act or
omission of an employee of the public entity within the scope of his employment
if the act or omission would, apart from this section, have given rise to a
cause of action against that employee.” 
This statute codifies public entities’ vicarious liability under the
“doctrine of respondeat superior.”  (Mary M. v. City of Los Angeles (1991) 54 Cal.3d 202, 209.)  Defendants
can thus only liable if their individual employees would be liable.  “[A] public employee is liable for injury
caused by his act or omission to the same extent as a private person.”  (Gov. Code, § 820(a).)  
The
third amended complaint does not allege sufficient facts to constitute a cause
of action for negligence against defendants’ employees.  For negligence, a public entity employer can only be liable if its employees
breached a common law duty of care to the plaintiff.  (Hoff v. Vacaville Unified School Dist. (1998)
19 Cal.4th 925, 933.)  
The
third amended complaint does not allege defendants’ employees breached any
duties owed to plaintiff.  The gravamen
of plaintiff’s claims for negligence is that defendants negligently created a
parcel of real property without following the required procedures, including duties
to survey and record maps.  Plaintiff
later purchased the subject parcel, parcel 36. 
Plaintiff cites no authority that public employees owe a duty to future
purchasers of land to comply with these required procedures, such as “to accept
as a dedication a proper parcel or divide the property by way of a parcel map
approved and reviewed by the county engineer” (3AC, ¶ 23) or “to prepare,
consider, and review maps and subdivision of land [and] establish, approve, and
maintain records of Land Use” (3AC, ¶ 48). 
None of the alleged breaches of duty would permit a cause of action for
negligence against defendants’ individual employees.  Defendants therefore cannot be vicariously
liable.  
Plaintiff
also argues defendants are liable under Government Code section 815.6, which
provides, “Where a public entity is under a mandatory duty imposed by an
enactment that is designed to protect against the risk of a particular kind of
injury, the public entity is liable for an injury of that kind proximately
caused by its failure to discharge the duty unless the public entity
establishes that it exercised reasonable diligence to discharge the duty.”  
This
section “requires that the enactment at issue be obligatory, rather than
merely discretionary or permissive, in its directions to the public entity; it
must require, rather than merely authorize or permit, that a particular
action be taken or not taken. 
[Citation.]  It is not enough,
moreover, that the public entity or officer have been under an obligation to
perform a function if the function itself involves the exercise of
discretion.”  (Haggis v. City of Los
Angeles (2000) 22 Cal.4th 490, 498 (Haggis).)  
Plaintiff
relies on several enactments that involve the exercise of discretion.  A duty is not mandatory when, for example, “the
required findings themselves rely on a discretionary application of the” public
entity or officer’s “judgment and expertise.” 
(Department of Corporations v. Superior Court (2007) 153
Cal.App.4th 916, 933.)  A function
involves discretion when the enactment “does not dictate any particular result,
or even provide a standard by which action taken by the” entity or officer “can
be objectively measured.”  (Ibid.)  Determining whether something “is ‘necessary
or appropriate’ ” generally involves discretion.  (Ibid.)
Plaintiff
cites Government Code section 27559 (3AC, ¶ 26), which provides, “In the
preparation of assessors’ maps and block-books the surveyor shall make all
investigations and surveys necessary to provide complete and accurate maps.”  Surveyors must use their judgment and
expertise, and therefore discretion, in deciding what investigations or surveys
are “necessary.”  
Los
Angeles County Code of Ordinances section 21.16.040(A) provides, “The county
engineer shall, upon completion of his examination of the parcel map and
receipt of the reports from county officers and departments … approve the map
if it conforms to the tentative map, as approved, and the conditions of
approval of the tentative map and all applicable requirements of
this Title 21 and of the Subdivision Map Act have been complied
with.”  Determining which requirements
are “applicable” and whether a map “complied with” them involves
discretion.  
Similarly,
Los Angeles County Code of Ordinances section 21.44.040 provides, “Each officer
… shall report in writing to the county engineer as to the compliance or
noncompliance of such map with law as to the matters coming under his or its
jurisdiction, together with a statement of the changes necessary thereon to
cause such map to comply with the law.”  Finding
whether a map complied or not and which changes would be “necessary” also
requires discretion.   
Plaintiff
further cites Business and Professions Code section 8762, subdivision
(b)(1)-(5).  Subdivision (b) provides
that a surveyor or engineer shall file “a record of the survey … if the field survey
discloses any of the following” concerns, including “(1) Material evidence [of]
physical change”, “(2) A material discrepancy with the information contained in
any” map, and “(3) Evidence that, by reasonable analysis, might result in
materially alternate positions of lines or points.”  Determining whether something is “material”
or doing a “reasonable analysis” are inherently discretionary.  
Assuming
plaintiff can show the element of mandatory duty, he does not satisfy the
second element for liability under Government Code section 815.6.  This section “requires the mandatory duty be
‘designed’ to protect against the particular kind of injury the plaintiff
suffered. The plaintiff must show the injury is ‘ “one of the consequences
which the [enacting body] sought to prevent through imposing the alleged mandatory
duty.” ’ ”  (Haggis, supra, 22
Cal.4th at p. 499.)  “That the enactment ‘confers
some benefit’ on the class to which plaintiff belongs is not enough; if the
benefit is ‘incidental’ to the enactment’s protective purpose, the enactment
cannot serve as a predicate for liability under section 815.6.”  (Ibid.)
Plaintiff
relies on enactments that only incidentally benefit property owners.  Their chief purpose is to assist the government
in orderly administration of laws regulating real property.  In analyzing a similar law regulating real
property, the Court of Appeal stated, “The purpose of the Subdivision Map Act
is to give the legislative bodies of local agencies the power to regulate and
control the design and improvement of subdivisions [citation], with
consideration for, among other matters, the location and size of required
easements and rights of way for access for the use of the lot owners and local
neighborhood traffic [citations] and the design of street alignments, grades
and widths.”  (Mikels v. Rager
(1991) 232 Cal.App.3d 334, 354, fn. 3 [deciding to apply general principles of
contract law to dedications of property].) 
The enactments plaintiff alleges defendants violated were similarly
designed to facilitate the government’s control over land.  Plaintiff provides no basis to conclude these
enactments were intended to protect property owners from clouds on title
resulting from inaccurate or incomplete maps or records.
 Plaintiff also cites Revenue and Taxation Code
sections 321-328.  These provisions,
however, were not designed to protect against the injury plaintiff suffered.  Section 321 provides, “Land shall be legally
described for tax purposes pursuant to this chapter.”  The purpose of these provisions is to facilitate
assessment and collection of real property taxes.  As plaintiff argues, his alleged injuries did
not arise from anything done for tax purposes. 
(Opp., pp. 21-22.)  
Leave to Amend
After
a successful demurrer, where “there is a reasonable possibility that the
defects can be cured by amendment, leave to amend must be granted.”  (Stevens v. Superior Court (1999)
75 Cal.App.4th 594, 601.)  The plaintiff
bears the burden of “demonstrat[ing] how the complaint can be amended.”  (Smith v. State Farm Mutual Automobile
Ins. Co. (2001) 93 Cal.App.4th 700, 711.)  “Leave to amend should be denied where the
facts are not in dispute and the nature of the claim is clear, but no liability
exists under substantive law.”  (Lawrence
v. Bank of America (1985) 163 Cal.App.3d 431, 436.)
Plaintiff
does not meet his burden of showing a reasonable possibility of curing the
defects in his first three causes of action. 
Plaintiff already amended the complaint three times.  The opposition argues, “Lazar should be entitled to address” arguments regarding actual
notice of the facts in 2011 “by way of amendment because in 2011 Lazaar did not
have actual knowledge of FEE interest and the allegations of the complaint that
there was no knowledge until late December 2021 remains accurate and
undisputed.”  (Opp., p. 13.)  
Regardless of “the
conclusion of FATCO’s investigation into the 1966 deed” that it only “reflected
an easement” (Opp., p. 13), that does not mean plaintiff could rely on FATCO’s
conclusions to toll the statute of limitations for claims against others.  The 1966 deed does include a fee
interest.  A subsequent purchaser “is
permitted only to rely on the recorded state of title as that state of title
objectively presents itself” and “is not entitled to view the record either
through ‘rose colored glasses’ or with blinders on.”  (Triple A Management Co., Inc. v. Frisone
(1999) 69 Cal.App.4th 520, 530.)  “[H]e is
not entitled to interpret ambiguities in his own favor nor is he entitled to
ignore reasonable warning signs that appear in the recorded documents.”  (Id. at pp. 530-531.)  Assuming the 1966 deed is ambiguous as to whether
it conveyed a fee interest to CVWD, plaintiff was not entitled to interpret
that in his own favor.  At a minimum, the
deed provides reasonable warning signs that CVWD may own a fee interest.  
Disposition    
Defendants County of Los
Angeles and Los Angeles County Flood Control District’s demurrer to the third
amended complaint by plaintiff Perry Lazar, as an individual and as trustee of
the Plone Trust’s first, second, and third causes of action is sustained without leave to amend.  Defendants shall answer the third amended
complaint’s fourth cause of action for trespass within 20 days.
