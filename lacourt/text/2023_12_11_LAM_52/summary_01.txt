In summary, the tentative ruling sustains the demurrer of the defendants, County of Los Angeles and Los Angeles County Flood Control District, to the plaintiff's third amended complaint on the first, second, and third causes of action for negligence. The court found that the plaintiff had constructive notice of the facts in 1966 and 2011, and that the statute of limitations had already expired. The court also found that the defendants are not liable under Government Code sections 815.2(a) and 815.6, and that the plaintiff's claims for trespass are not viable.
