CASE:                         Mural Media, LLC 401k Plan v. Linda J.
Maultsby
 
CASE NO.:                 23STCV25637            
 
MOTION
TO TRANSFER VENUE

 
MOVING PARTY:               Defendant Linda J. Maultsby
 
RESPONDING PARTY(S): Plaintiff Mural
Media, LLC 401k Plan
 
STATEMENT
OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
            This is an unlawful detainer action that was filed on October 20, 2023.
Plaintiff alleges that Defendant refused to permit an inspection of her rental
unit which was necessary for Plaintiff to complete a sale of the property to a
third party. 
 
Defendant moves to transfer venue. 
            
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Defendant’s Motion to Transfer
Venue is DENIED. 
 
DISCUSSION:
 
Defendant moves to transfer venue under
the Court’s discretionary authority pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section
397. 
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 397
grants the Court discretionary authority to change the place of trial in
certain cases, including, as relevant here: 
 
(a)¿When the court designated in the
complaint is not the proper court. 
 
. . . 
 
(c)¿When the convenience of witnesses
and the ends of justice would be promoted by the change. 
(Code Civ. Proc. § 397(a), (c).) Defendant contends
that three material witnesses reside in Marin County, Sonoma County, and Orange
County, and that it would be more convenient for these witnesses to transfer
the matter to a different venue. Defendant fails to specify to which venue she
seeks to transfer this case, and, in any event, her argument is premature. “The
court will not entertain a motion for change of venue on the ground of
convenience of witnesses when the defendant has not filed an answer, for the
reason that until the issues are joined the court cannot determine what
testimony will be material.” (Cholakian & Associates v. Superior Court
(2015) 236 Cal.App.4th 361, 368.)  Defendant has not filed an answer to
the Complaint. Thus, under binding precedent, the Court cannot entertain a
request to transfer venue on this basis. 
 
CONCLUSION:

 
            Accordingly,
Defendant’s Motion to Transfer Venue is DENIED. 
 
            Moving
Party to give notice.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.

            Any party may submit on the
tentative ruling by contacting the courtroom via email at Smcdept47@lacourt.org by no later than 4:00 p.m. the day
before the hearing. All interested parties must be copied on the email. It
should be noted that if you submit on a tentative ruling the court will still
conduct a hearing if any party appears. By submitting on the tentative you
have, in essence, waived your right to be present at the hearing, and you
should be aware that the court may not adopt the tentative, and may issue an
order which modifies the tentative ruling in whole or in part.
