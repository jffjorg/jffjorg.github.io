HISTORY:

     Complaint filed.
12/29/21:
     Linda J. Vitz substituted in for Doe Defendant #1

 
STATEMENT
OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
            This is a habitability defect action. Plaintiff
leased an apartment from Defendants that she alleges contained toxic mold. 
 
Defendant Solimar Homeowner’s
Association moves to transfer this action to Orange County. 
            
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Defendant Solimar Homeowner’s
Association’s Motion to Transfer Venue to Orange County is DENIED. 
 
DISCUSSION:
 
Defendant Solimar Homeowner’s
Association moves to transfer this action to Orange County on the ground that
this action was not commenced in a proper venue, and that it is in the interest
of justice and the convenience of witnesses to litigate this matter in Orange
County.
 
//
 
//
Improper
Venue
 
            Defendant first argues that transfer
of this action is mandatory because Los Angeles is not a proper venue for this
dispute.
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 396b(a)
provides: 
 
(a)¿Except as otherwise provided in
Section 396a, if an action or proceeding is commenced in a court having
jurisdiction of the subject matter thereof, other than the court
designated as the proper court for the trial thereof, under this title,
the action may, notwithstanding, be tried in the court where commenced, unless
the defendant, at the time he or she answers, demurs, or moves to strike, or,
at his or her option, without answering, demurring, or moving to strike and
within the time otherwise allowed to respond to the complaint, files with the
clerk, a notice of motion for an order transferring the action or proceeding to
the proper court, together with proof of service, upon the adverse party, of a
copy of those papers. Upon the hearing of the motion the court shall, if
it appears that the action or proceeding was not commenced in the proper court,
order the action or proceeding transferred to the proper court. 
 
(Code
Civ. Proc. § 396b(a), bold emphasis and underlining added.)  Thus, transfer
is mandatory under section 396b(a) if the action was not filed in the proper
court. On determining the proper court in which to file an action, Code of
Civil Procedure section 395(a) provides: 
 
(a)¿Except as otherwise provided by law
and subject to the power of the court to transfer actions or proceedings as
provided in this title, the superior court in the county where the
defendants or some of them reside at the commencement of the action is the
proper court for the trial of the action. If the action is for injury to person
or personal property or for death from wrongful act or negligence, the superior
court in either the county where the injury occurs or the injury causing
death occurs or the county where the defendants, or some of them reside
at the commencement of the action, is a proper court for the trial of the
action. . . . Subject to subdivision (b), if a defendant has contracted to
perform an obligation in a particular county, the superior court in the county
where the obligation is to be performed, where the contract in fact was entered
into, or where the defendant or any defendant resides at the commencement of
the action is a proper court for the trial of an action founded on that obligation,
and the county where the obligation is incurred is the county where it is to be
performed, unless there is a special contract in writing to the contrary. . .
. 
 
(Code
Civ. Proc. § 395(a) (bold emphasis added).) An action against a corporate
defendant may be brought where its principal place of business is located.
(Code Civ. Proc. § 395.5.) The burden is on the moving party to establish that
the plaintiff’s venue selection is not proper under any statutory grounds. (Fontaine
v. Superior Court. (Cashcall, Inc.) (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th, 830,
836.)
 
            Defendant contends that this is an
action pertaining to real property subject to section 392, which states that
the court in the county where the subject property is located is the proper
court for, inter alia, “the recovery of real property, or of an estate
or interest therein, or for the determination in any form, of that right or
interest, and for injuries to real property.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 392(a)(1).) The
Complaint freely alleges that the rental premises are located in Huntington
Beach, California, and that the central factual allegations concern Defendants’
failure to maintain the subject property, causing the growth of toxic mold.
(See, e.g., Complaint ¶¶ 2, 13-14.) According to Defendant, the gravamen of
this action is an injury to Plaintiff’s rights and interests in land as a
tenant. (See Grocers’ Fruit Growing Union v. Kern County Land Co. (1907)
150 Cal. 466, 472 [Gravamen of complaint was specific performance of contract
for sale of land notwithstanding claim for accounting].) 
 
            Plaintiff, in opposition, argues
that her claims are properly understood as tort and contract claims independent
of her real property rights, and therefore that venue is proper under section
395(a) because Defendant Ernst & Haas resides in Long Beach, within the
County of Los Angeles. (Complaint ¶ 22.) As Plaintiff states, the general rule
is that, when the “main relief sought in a case does not relate to rights in
real property,” section 395(a) applies. (K.R.L. Partnership v. Superior
Court (2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 490, 497.) Indeed, many of Plaintiff’s claims
appear on their face to seek relief for injuries to Plaintiff’s person for
Defendants’ conduct. For example, the fourth cause of action for premises
liability, the seventh and eighth causes of action for intentional and
negligent infliction of emotional distress, and the tenth and eleventh causes
of action for fraud and negligent misrepresentation are tort claims seeking
relief for physical and emotional injuries. (See, e.g., Complaint ¶¶ 156-57.) Further,
the remaining claims, including the first three causes of action for breach of the
implied covenants of good faith, and quiet enjoyment and breach of the implied
warranty of habitability, as well as the ninth cause of action for breach of
contract, are definitionally based in the agreement to rent the property, not
in Plaintiff’s property rights. “The [implied] covenant of good faith and
fair dealing [is] implied by law in every contract.” (Durell v. Sharp
Healthcare (2010) 183 Cal.App.4th 1350, 1369.) Similarly, “[e]very lease
includes an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment protecting the lessee from any
act or omission by the lessor which interferes with the lessee's right to use
and enjoy the premises for the purposes contemplated by the lease.” (Avalon
Pac.-Santa Ana, L.P. v. HD Supply Repair & Remodel, LLC (2011) 192
Cal.App.4th 1183, 1191.) Likewise, the California Supreme Court ruled decades
ago that “modern conditions compel the recognition of a common law implied
warranty of habitability in residential leases.” (Green v. Superior Ct.
(1974) 10 Cal.3d 616, 629.) 
 
            In reply, Defendant argues that the
Court rejected many of Plaintiff’s claims as inadequately pled in ruling on a
demurrer to the Complaint in May 2022, and so the Court should not consider
those claims here. That ruling was issued on May 11, 2022, three months before
this Defendant was named as a Doe Defendant. (See August 17, 2023 Amendment to
Complaint.) Moreover, the Court’s ruling only sustained the demurrer as to the
claims for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing (first
cause of action), breach of contract (ninth), fraud (tenth), and negligent
misrepresentation (eleventh). (May 11, 2022 Minute Order.) The Court overruled
the demurrer as to the claims for breach of the implied covenant of quiet
enjoyment and implied warranty of habitability in the second and third causes
of action. (Id.) Put differently, several of the claims which support
the characterization of this action as grounded in personal injury or in
contract either survived that demurrer, such as breach of the implied covenant
of quiet enjoyment, or were never challenged in the first place, as was the
case for premises liability.
 
            The Court is persuaded by
Plaintiff’s arguments and by the Court’s own review of the allegations in the
Complaint that the gravamen of this action is either an injury to Plaintiff’s
person or a violation of Plaintiff’s rights in contract, not an injury to
Plaintiff’s rights and interests in land. In either case, venue is proper in
any county in which some or all of the Defendants in this action reside. (Code
Civ. Proc. § 395(a).) As an undisputed allegation is that the Ernst & Haas
Defendants have a business address in Long Beach, within Los Angeles County
(Complaint ¶ 22), venue is proper inthe County of Los Angeles. Therefore,
transfer of venue is not required under Code of Civil Procedure section 396b.
 
Discretionary
Transfer
 
Defendant contends in the alternative that
the Court should exercise its discretionary authority to transfer venue to
Orange County for the convenience of witnesses.
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 397 grants
the Court discretionary authority to change the place of trial in certain
cases, including, as relevant here: 
 
(a)¿When the court
designated in the complaint is not the proper court. 
 
. . . 
 
(c)¿When the
convenience of witnesses and the ends of justice would be promoted by the
change. 
 
. . . 
 
(Code Civ. Proc. § 397(a), (c).) 

 
In a motion brought under section 397,
subdivision 3, “the burden [of proof] rests on the party moving for transfer
to establish grounds for change of venue, on the theory the plaintiff lays
the venue and it is presumptively correct. [Citations.]” (Pesses v. Superior
Court (1980) 107 Cal.App.3d 117, 124 [165 Cal.Rptr. 680].) “[It] is not
only necessary that convenience of witnesses be served, but it is equally
essential that the ends of justice be promoted. [Citation.]” (Wirta v.
Vergona (1957) 155 Cal.App.2d 29, 32 [317 P.2d 78].) While a motion made
under this section is addressed to the discretion of the trial court, that
discretion is not unfettered. For instance, except under limited
circumstances, the court may not consider the convenience of the parties or of
their employees in passing upon the motion. (Peiser v. Mettler
(1958) 50 Cal.2d 594, 612 [328 P.2d 953, 74 A.L.R.2d 1] [convenience of parties
not to be considered]; International Investment Co. v. Chagnon (1959)
175 Cal.App.2d 439, 446 [346 P.2d 209] [convenience of a party’s employees not
to be considered].)
 
There is, however, an exception to the
rule prohibiting consideration of convenience to a party when “the serious
illness of a party will prevent his traveling to attend the trial in the other
county and his testimony is material . . . . [Citations.]” (Simonian v.
Simonian (1950) 97 Cal.App.2d 68, 69 [217 P.2d 157]; Kroesen v. Gordon
(1943) 61 Cal.App.2d 385, 387 [142 P.2d 935]; Borba v. Toste (1942) 52
Cal.App.2d 591, 593-594 [126 P.2d 655].) Likewise, a limited exception has
arisen allowing a court to consider the convenience of witnesses who are
employees of a party. That exception obtains when the employees are called as
witnesses by the adverse party rather than on behalf of their employer. (J.
C. Millett Co. v. Latchford-Marble G. Co. (1959) 167 Cal.App.2d 218, 227
[334 P.2d 72] [“. . . when such employees are being called by an adverse party,
the court may properly consider their convenience. [Citation.]”]); Harden v.
Skinner & Hammond (1955) 130 Cal.App.2d 750, 757 [279 P.2d 978] [“. . .
these (employee) witnesses are not being called by their employer to testify
for such employer. They are being called by the adverse party and so are, as to
him, ordinary witnesses.”].)
 
(Lieberman v. Superior Court (1987) 194 Cal.App.3d
396, 401-402 (bold emphasis added).)
 
Section 397, subdivision 3, of the Code
of Civil Procedure provides that the court may, on motion change the place of
trial “When the convenience of witnesses and the ends of justice would be
promoted by the change.” In Willingham v. Pecora, 44 Cal.App.2d 289, 295
[112 P.2d 328], it was held that both of the conditions -- convenience of
witnesses and the ends of justice -- must occur and that the moving party has
the burden of proving that both conditions will be met.
 
The affidavits in support of the
motion for change of venue on this ground must set forth the names of the
witnesses, the nature of the testimony expected from each, and the reasons why
the attendance of each would be inconvenient. (Juneau v. Juneau, 45
Cal.App.2d 14 [113 P.2d 463]; San Jose Hospital v. Etherton, 84 Cal.App.
516 [258 P. 611]; Harden v. Skinner & Hammond, 130 Cal.App.2d 750,
755 [279 P.2d 978].)
 
(Peiser v. Mettler (1958) 50 Cal.2d 594, 607 (bold
emphasis added).)
 
“It is no abuse of the trial court’s
discretion to deny a motion for a change of the place of trial made on the
ground of the convenience of witnesses, if the affidavit of the [party] in
opposition to the motion shows that his witnesses will be inconvenienced if the
change be ordered.” (People v. Spring Valley Co., supra, 109 Cal.App.2d
656, 667; Churchill v. White, 119 Cal.App.2d 503, 507 [259 P.2d 974].)
And “The mere numerical majority of the witnesses on one side or the other does
not necessarily determine the merits of the motion.” (Woods v. Silvers,
35 Cal.App.2d 604, 607 [96 P.2d 366]; People v. Spring Valley Co., supra,
at 667). The motion is addressed to the trial court’s judicial discretion, and “.
. . the moving party must stand upon the strength of his showing rather than
upon the weakness, if any, of the opposition.” (Chaffin Construction Co.
v. Maleville Bros., supra, 155 Cal.App.2d 660, 664.)
 
(Minatta v. Crook (1959) 166 Cal.App.2d 750, 755-57
(bold emphasis added).) 
 
Defendant contends that all complained-of conduct occurred in
Orange County and all witnesses and evidence are likewise located in Orange
County. Defendants therefore argue that the case should be transferred to
promote the convenience of the parties and the interests of justice. Defendant
provides a list of witnesses likely to have information concerning this matter
who reside in Orange County and repeat that the subject property is likewise
located in Orange County, as is Defendant David Haas. (Declaration of Andrew
Scoble ISO Mot. ¶¶ 23-25.) However, Defendant does not provide a single line of
testimony from the witnesses themselves to establish that it would be unduly
burdensome to require them to travel to Los Angeles from Orange County, as so
many others do every day, to testify in this Court. Such a meager showing is
not sufficient to demonstrate that the convenience of witnesses would be served
by transferring this matter to Orange County. 
            
CONCLUSION:
 
Accordingly, Defendant Solimar
Homeowner’s Association’s Motion to Transfer Venue to Orange County is DENIED. 
 
Moving party to give notice, unless
waived.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
