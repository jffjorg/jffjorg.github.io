And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling issued by Judge Theresa M. Traber regarding a motion to transfer venue filed by Defendant Linda J. Maultsby in an unlawful detainer action brought by Plaintiff Mural Media, LLC 401k Plan. The Plaintiff alleges that the Defendant refused to permit an inspection of her rental unit, which is necessary for the Plaintiff to complete a sale of the property to a third party. The Defendant argues that it would be more convenient for the witnesses in this case, who reside in Marin County, Sonoma County, and Orange County, to transfer the case to a different venue. However, the Court finds that the Defendant's argument is premature because it has not filed an answer to the Complaint, and therefore, the Court cannot determine what testimony will be material. As a result, the Court denies the Defendant's motion to transfer venue.
