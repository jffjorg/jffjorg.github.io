And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge has denied Defendant Solimar Homeowner's Association's Motion to Transfer Venue to Orange County. The Judge has determined that the plaintiff's choice of venue in Los Angeles County is proper, as the defendants, including Ernst & Haas Management Co., Inc. and David Haas, reside in that county. The Judge has also found that the convenience of witnesses is not sufficient to justify a transfer to Orange County, as the defendant has failed to provide sufficient evidence to show that it would be unduly burdensome for witnesses to travel to Los Angeles from Orange County to testify in court.
