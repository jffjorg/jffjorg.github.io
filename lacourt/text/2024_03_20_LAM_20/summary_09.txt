And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the demurrer filed by defendants California Physicians Service, Arshad Haqib, and Sandra Griffin to the plaintiff Durant McLeod's harassment claim will be overruled. The plaintiff had alleged that he was subjected to unwelcome harassment based on his Jamaican accent. The judge found that the plaintiff's allegations are sufficient to state a claim and that the harassment must be "sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the condition of the victim's employment and create an abusive environment." The judge also noted that the defendants' demurrer was filed without leave to amend, which is error. The defendants are ordered to file an answer within 20 days.
