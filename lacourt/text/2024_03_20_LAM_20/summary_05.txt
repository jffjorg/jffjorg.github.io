And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling of the Court addresses the demurrer filed by Defendants Roseville Point Health & Wellness Center, LLC, Sol Healthcare, LLC, Rockport Administrative Services, LLC, Shlomo Rechnitz, and Rechnitz Core GP to the wrongful death claim brought by Plaintiffs Nathan Bears, through his successor Karen Bears, and Karen Bears. The Court finds that the wrongful death claim is timely because Plaintiffs moved to add this claim before the statute of limitations expired. The Court also grants the Motion to Strike the references to punitive damages and injunctive relief for the patient bill of rights claim, as these are not applicable. The Court orders that an answer be filed within 20 days and that moving parties give notice. The tentative ruling also notes that counsel are strongly encouraged to appear by LACourtConnect rather than in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
