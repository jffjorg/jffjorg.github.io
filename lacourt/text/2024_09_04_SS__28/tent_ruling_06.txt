 Case Number:  23STCV22965    Hearing Date:   September 4, 2024    Dept:  28 Having  considered the moving, opposition, reply, and supplemental papers, the Court  rules as follows.  BACKGROUND  On  September 21, 2023, Plaintiff Paul Ndawula (“Plaintiff”) filed this action  against Defendants Anthony Lorenzo Alvarez (“Alvarez”),  Zaira Sandoval (“Zaira Sandoval”), Jonathan Sandoval (“Jonathan Sandoval”), and  Does 1-100 for negligence.  On  November 1, 2023, Defendants Alvarez, Zaira Sandoval, and Jonathan Sandoval (“Defendants”)  filed an answer.  On  June 18, 2024, Plaintiff filed (1) a single motion to compel Defendants’ responses  to request for production of documents, special interrogatories (only with  respect to Alvarez), and form interrogatories served on each Defendant and for  sanctions (Plaintiff should have filed seven separate motions, one for each type  of discovery served on each Defendant) and (2) a single motion to deem admitted  matters specified in requests for admission served on each Defendant and for  sanctions (Plaintiff should have filed three separate motions, one for each Defendant).  The motions were set for hearing on July 23,  2024.  On July 10, 2024, Defendants filed  oppositions. On July 16, 2024, Plaintiff filed replies. The Court continued the  hearing to September 4, 2024. On July 24, 2024, Defendants’ counsel filed a  supplemental declaration.  Trial  is currently scheduled for March 20, 2025.  PARTIES’ REQUESTS  Plaintiff  asks the Court to compel Defendants to serve verified code-compliant responses, without objections, to request for production of documents, set one,  special interrogatories, set one, and form interrogatories, set one.  Plaintiff also asks the Court to deem admitted  matters specified in requests for admission served on Defendants and to impose  sanctions on Defendants.  Defendants  ask the Court to deny the motions.  LEGAL STANDARD  A.   Inspection demand  Code  of Civil Procedure section 2031.300 provides:  “If a party to whom a demand for inspection, copying,  testing, or sampling is directed fails to serve a timely response to it, the  following rules shall apply:  “(a) The party to whom the demand for inspection,  copying, testing, or sampling is directed waives any objection to the demand,  including one based on privilege or on the protection for work product under  Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve  that party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following  conditions are satisfied:  “(1) The party has subsequently served a response that  is in substantial compliance with Sections 2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230,  2031.240, and 2031.280.  “(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response  was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.  “(b) The party making the demand may move for an order  compelling response to the demand.  “(c) Except as provided in subdivision (d), the court  shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section  2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or  opposes a motion to compel a response to a demand for inspection, copying,  testing, or sampling, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction  acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the  imposition of the sanction unjust. If a party then fails to obey the order compelling  a response, the court may make those orders that are just, including the  imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating  sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in  addition to this sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under  Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010).  “(d) (1) Notwithstanding subdivision (c), absent  exceptional circumstances, the court shall not impose sanctions on a party or  any attorney of a party for failure to provide electronically stored  information that has been lost, damaged, altered, or overwritten as a result of  the routine, good faith operation of an electronic information system.  “(2) This subdivision shall not be construed to alter  any obligation to preserve discoverable information.”  (Code Civ. Proc., §  2031.300.)  B.   Interrogatories  Code  of Civil Procedure section 2030.290 provides:  “If  a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to serve a timely response,  the following rules apply:  “(a) The party to whom the interrogatories are  directed waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings under  Section 2030.230, as well as any objection to the interrogatories, including  one based on privilege or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4  (commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that  party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following  conditions are satisfied:  “(1) The party has subsequently served a response that  is in substantial compliance with Sections 2030.210, 2030.220, 2030.230, and  2030.240.  “(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response  was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.  “(b) The party propounding the interrogatories may  move for an order compelling response to the interrogatories.  “(c) The court shall impose a monetary sanction under  Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or  attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to  interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted  with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition  of the sanction unjust. If a party then fails to obey an order compelling  answers, the court may make those orders that are just, including the imposition  of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction under  Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in addition to that  sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing  with Section 2023.010).”  (Code Civ. Proc., §  2030.290.)  C.      Requests for admission  Code  of Civil Procedure section 2033.280 provides:  “If a party to whom requests for admission are  directed fails to serve a timely response, the following rules apply:  “(a) The party to whom the requests for admission are  directed waives any objection to the requests, including one based on privilege  or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section  2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that party from this waiver on its  determination that both of the following conditions are satisfied:  “(1) The party has subsequently served a response that  is in substantial compliance with Sections 2033.210, 2033.220, and 2033.230.  “(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response  was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.  “(b) The requesting party may move for an order that  the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the  requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction under Chapter 7  (commencing with Section 2023.010).  “(c) The court shall make this order, unless it finds  that the party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has  served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests  for admission that is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220. It is  mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing  with Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to  serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion.”  (Code Civ. Proc., §  2033.280.)  DISCUSSION  A.   Overview  On November  20, 2023, Plaintiff served requests for production of documents, set one,  special interrogatories, set one, form interrogatories, set one, and requests  for admission, set one, on each Defendant.    Plaintiff  granted Defendants an extension to January 12, 2024 for their responses.  On January 12, 2024, Defendants served  responses to the requests for admission and requests for production of  documents.  The responses consisted of both  objections and unverified responses.   Defendants did not provide timely responses to the interrogatories and  had not provided responses by the time Plaintiff filed these motions.  On July  24, 2024, Defendants’ counsel filed a declaration stating that (1) Zaira  Sandoval has now served responses to all of Plaintiff’s discovery requests and  (2) Jonathan Sandoval has now served responses to Plaintiff’s request for  production of documents, special interrogatories, and requests for admission.  B.   Requests for production of documents  Arguing  that responses without verification are the equivalent of no responses, Plaintiff  asks the Court to compel Defendants’ responses to the requests for production  of documents.  Plaintiff’s  motion to compel Zaira Sandoval’s and Jonathan Sandoval’s responses to the  requests for production of documents is moot because Zaira Sandoval and  Jonathan Sandoval have now served their verified responses.  In  addition, Defendants assert that their January 12, 2024 unverified responses  were “hybrid” responses under Food 4 Less Supermarkets, Inc. v. Superior  Court (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 651 (Food 4 Less).  In Food 4 Less, the Court of Appeal  held that when a party serves a timely response to a request for production of  documents that includes both objections and fact-specific responses, “[t]he  omission of the verification in the portion of the response containing fact-specific  responses merely renders that portion of the response untimely and therefore  only creates a right to move for orders and sanctions under [former]  subdivision (k) of [Code of Civil Procedure] section 2031 as to those responses  but does not result in a waiver of the objections made.”  (Food 4 Less, supra, 40  Cal.App.4th at pp. 657-658, fn. omitted.)   In Food 4 Less, the defendants served timely discovery  responses.  As a result, “[t]he lack of  verification did not render their objections untimely” and the trial court  “erred in finding defendants had waived their objections and in imposing  monetary sanctions upon defendants.” (Id. at p. 658.)  The  Court grants Plaintiff’s motion to compel Alvarez’s responses only to the requests  for production of documents to which Alvarez did not previously object.  With respect to these requests, the Court  orders Alvarez to provide verified code-compliant responses without objections  and to produce the documents,  electronically stored information, and/or other things requested without  objections by October 3, 2024.  With  respect to the requests for production of documents to which Alvarez previously  objected, Alvarez has not waived his objections because the objections were  timely.  (See Food 4 Less, supra, 40 Cal.App.4th at p. 658.)  C.    Special  interrogatories  Arguing that Alvarez did not serve timely responses to  the special interrogatories, Plaintiff asks the Court to compel Alvarez’s  responses to the special interrogatories.   Defendants do not oppose the motion.  The Court grants Plaintiff’s motion to compel  Alvarez’s responses to the special interrogatories and orders Alvarez to  provide verified code-compliant responses to the special interrogatories without  objections by October 3, 2024.   D.   Form interrogatories  Arguing  that Defendants did not serve timely responses to the form interrogatories,  Plaintiff asks the Court to compel Defendants’ responses to the form  interrogatories.  Plaintiff’s  motion to compel Zaira Sandoval’s responses to the form interrogatories is moot  because Zaira Sandoval has now served her verified responses.  The  Court grants Plaintiff’s motion to compel Jonathan  Sandoval’s and Alvarez’s responses to the form interrogatories.  Defendants do not oppose this motion.  The Court orders Jonathan Sandoval and Alvarez  to provide verified code-compliant responses to the form interrogatories  without objections by October 3, 2024.  E.   Requests for admission  Plaintiff  asks the Court to deem admitted the matters specified in requests for admission  served on Defendants.  The  Court may grant a motion to deem admitted matters specified in requests for  admission “unless it finds that the party to whom the requests for admission  have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed  response to the requests for admission that is in substantial compliance with  Section 2033.220.”  (Code Civ. Proc., §  2033.280, subd. (c).)  Zaira  Sandoval and Jonathan Sandoval served verified responses to Plaintiff’s  requests for admission before the September 4, 2024 hearing.  Therefore, the Court denies Plaintiff’s motion with respect to these defendants.  The  Court grants Plaintiff’s motion to deem admitted matters specified in requests  for admission served on Alvarez and deems the matters admitted.  F.    Sanctions  1.    Requests for admission  “It  is mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7  (commencing with Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose  failure to serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated [a  motion to deem admitted matters specified in requests for admission].”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)  Plaintiff  requests $1,760.00 in sanctions against Defendants only (not their counsel) based on  four hours of attorney time at a rate of $425 per hour and one $60.00 filing  fee.  Counsel spent approximately three  hours to prepare the motion and anticipated spending another hour to prepare  for and attend the hearing.  The  Court grants $810.00 in sanctions based on three hours of attorney time at a reasonable  rate of $250.00 per hour and one filing fee and orders Defendants to pay Plaintiff this amount by October 3, 2024.  2.    Motions to compel  Plaintiff  requests $3,035.00 in sanctions on the motion to compel discovery responses.  The Court has granted the motion only with  respect to (1) Plaintiff’s motion to  compel Alvarez’s responses to the requests for production of documents to  which Alvarez did not previously object, (2) Plaintiff’s motion to compel  Alvarez’s responses to the special interrogatories, (3) Plaintiff’s motion to  compel Jonathan Sandoval’s responses to the form interrogatories, and (4) Plaintiff’s  motion to compel Alvarez’s responses to the form interrogatories.  Under  Code of Civil Procedure sections 2030.290 and 2031.300, the Court shall impose  a monetary sanction against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully  makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to interrogatories or a demand  for inspection unless the Court finds that the one subject to the sanction  acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the  imposition of the sanction unjust.  (See  Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (c) [interrogatories], 2031.300, subd. (c)  [demand for inspection].)  Defendants  did not make or oppose a motion to compel responses to the interrogatories.  Therefore, sanctions are not available under Code of Civil Procedure section  2030.290.  Other  statutes addressing misuse of the discovery process do not, by themselves,  authorize a sanctions award for the motion to compel responses to  interrogatories.  In City of Los  Angeles v. Pricewaterhousecoopers, LLP (Aug. 23, 2024) __ Cal.5th __ [2024  WL 3894042, 2024 DJDAR 8056, slip opn. pp. 1-42] (PwC), the Supreme  Court held: “It is already well-established that a court may not rely on [Code  of Civil Procedure] section 2023.030 to override the limitations prescribed by  any other applicable sanctions provision in the Act. A court may invoke its  independent authority to impose sanctions under sections 2023.010 and 2023.030  only when confronted with an unusual form of discovery abuse, or a pattern of  abuse, not already addressed by a relevant sanctions provision. And where it  invokes that authority, it is constrained by the long-settled rules generally  governing the imposition of discovery sanctions under the Act.”  (PwC, supra, __ Cal.5th __  [2024 WL 3894042 at *18, 2024 DJDAR at p. 8066, slip opn. at p. 40].)  Code  of Civil Procedure section 2030.290, subdivision (c), limits the Court’s  authority to impose sanctions when (as here) the non-moving party does not  oppose a successful motion to compel responses to interrogatories.  Because the statute addresses the issue, the  Court may not invoke its independent authority to impose sanctions on the  motion to compel responses to interrogatories under Code of Civil Procedure  sections 2023.010 and 2023.030.  (See PwC,  supra, __ Cal.5th __ [2024 WL 3894042 at *18, 2024 DJDAR at p. 8066,  slip opn. at p. 40].)  Plaintiff  requests $3,035.00 in sanctions against Defendants based on seven hours of attorney time at a rate  of $525.00 per hour and one $60.00 filing fee.   Counsel spent approximately 6 hours preparing the motion and anticipated  spending another hour to prepare for and attend the hearing.  As  noted above, Plaintiff should have filed seven separate motions, one for each  type of discovery sought from each defendant.   Dividing the total time counsel spent (seven hours) by the number of  motions that Plaintiff should have filed (seven), the Court allocates one hour  of attorney time to the motion to compel Alvarez’s responses to requests for  production of documents.  Because Plaintiff  succeeded in this motion only in part, the Court awards $210.00 in sanctions  for this motion based on .5 hours of attorney time at a reasonable rate of $250.00  per hour and one filing fee.  The Court orders Alvarez to pay Plaintiff $210.00 by October 3, 2024. CONCLUSION  The  Court DENIES Paul Ndawula’s motion to compel Plaintiff Zaira Sandoval’s  responses to request for production of documents, set one.  The Court DENIES Paul Ndawula’s motion to compel  Plaintiff Zaira Sandoval’s responses to form interrogatories, set one.  The  Court DENIES Paul Ndawula’s motion to deem admitted matters specified in  requests for admission, set one, served on Plaintiff Zaira Sandoval.  The  Court GRANTS Paul Ndawula’s motion to compel Plaintiff Jonathan  Sandoval’s responses to form interrogatories, set one, and orders Jonathan Sandoval to provide verified  code-compliant responses to the form interrogatories without objections by  October 3, 2024.  The  Court GRANTS IN PART Paul Ndawula’s motion to compel Plaintiff Anthony Lorenzo  Alvarez’s responses to requests for production of documents, set one, and  orders Plaintiff Anthony Lorenzo Alvarez to provide verified code-compliant  responses, without objections, only to the requests to which Alvarez did not  previously object and to produce the documents, electronically stored  information, and/or other things requested (to which Alvarez  did not previously object) without objections by October 3, 2024.  In all other respects, the Court DENIES the motion.  The Court GRANTS Paul Ndawula’s motion to compel  Plaintiff Anthony Lorenzo Alvarez’s responses to special interrogatories, set  one, and orders Plaintiff Anthony Lorenzo Alvarez to provide verified  code-compliant responses, without objections, to the  special interrogatories without objections by October 3, 2024.  The  Court GRANTS Paul Ndawula’s motion to compel Plaintiff Anthony Lorenzo  Alvarez’s responses to form interrogatories, set one, and orders Plaintiff  Anthony Lorenzo Alvarez to provide verified code-compliant responses, without  objections, to the form interrogatories without objections by October 3, 2024.  The Court GRANTS Paul Ndawula’s motion to deem admitted matters specified in requests  for admission, set one, served on Plaintiff Anthony Lorenzo Alvarez and deems  the matters admitted.  The  Court GRANTS in part Paul Ndawula’s requests for sanctions.  On the motion to deem admitted matters  specified in requests for admission, the Court orders Defendants Anthony Lorenzo Alvarez, Zaira Sandoval, and Jonathan Sandoval to pay Plaintiff Paul Ndawula $810.00 in sanctions by October 3, 2024.  On Plaintiff’s  motion to compel discovery responses, the Court orders Defendant Anthony Lorenzo Alvarez to pay Plaintiff Paul Ndawula $210.00 in sanctions by October 3, 2024. In all other respects, the Court DENIES Plaintiff Paul Ndawula’s motions.  The  Court orders Plaintiff Paul Ndawula to pay the Court eight additional filing fees, totaling  $480.00, because Plaintiff filed only two motions where ten were required.  Plaintiff is to pay the additional filing  fees by October 3, 2024.  Moving  party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.  Moving  party is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court  within five days.
