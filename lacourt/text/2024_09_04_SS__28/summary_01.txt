**Significant Statements**
```
The Court shall impose a monetary sanction against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to interrogatories or a demand for inspection unless the Court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.
The Court may not invoke its independent authority to impose sanctions under Code of Civil Procedure sections 2023.010 and 2023.030.
```
And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has considered the motions filed by Intervenor Liberty Mutual Fire Insurance Company to compel Plaintiff Taylor Briscoe's responses to requests for production of documents, special interrogatories, and form interrogatories. The Court grants these motions, ordering Plaintiff to provide verified code-compliant responses and produce the requested documents and information by October 3, 2024.

The Court also denies Intervenor's requests for sanctions, as the statutes governing discovery sanctions limit the Court's authority to impose sanctions in this situation. The Court notes that the Supreme Court has held that a court may not rely on its independent authority to impose sanctions under Code of Civil Procedure sections 2023.010 and 2023.030 if a relevant sanctions provision is already in place.
