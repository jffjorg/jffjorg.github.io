And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion by the plaintiff, Mario Hernandez Gomez, to file a first amended complaint. The original complaint was filed on October 19, 2022, and alleges that the defendants, Belmont Enterprises, LLC and The Saint Agnes Hotel, LLC, were negligent and caused the plaintiff's injuries. The plaintiff is seeking to change the date of the incident from July 10, 2022 to June 12, 2022.

The defendants, Belmont Enterprises, LLC, oppose the motion, arguing that the amendment would not "relate back" to the original complaint due to the statute of limitations. The judge finds that the amended complaint does relate back to the original complaint and grants the motion. The plaintiff is ordered to file and serve the first amended complaint within 10 days of the hearing.
