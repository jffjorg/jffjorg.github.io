And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling is in response to a motion filed by Plaintiff Shamsun Nahar Khan to modify an earlier order denying the continuation or reopening of discovery. The judge also considered Plaintiff's ex parte application to continue the trial due to Plaintiff's counsel's medical condition. The judge denied the motion to reopen discovery, finding that the motion did not comply with the necessary procedures. The judge also denied the ex parte application to continue the trial, as the request was already granted on August 7, 2024, and the judge declined to grant a longer continuance without sufficient evidence or argument. The trial is currently scheduled for October 21, 2024.
