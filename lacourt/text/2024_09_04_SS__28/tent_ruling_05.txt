On
June 7, 2023, Plaintiff filed proofs of service showing substituted service on
Acosta and Hernandez of the summons, complaint, statement of damages, and other
documents on May 31, 2023. 
On
July 24, 2023, Plaintiff filed amended proofs of service. 
On

On

Plaintiff’s request. 
On

medical expenses, $15,000.00 for lost earnings, and $500.00 for property damage
(deductible). 
On August
15, 2024, Plaintiff filed a request for Court judgment. 
PARTY'S REQUEST 
Plaintiff
Maidia Leola Stillitano asks the Court to enter a default judgment against
Defendants Juventina Acosta Funez and Jorge Hernandez. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
A.      Default judgment 
          California Rules of Court, rule
3.1800(a), provides: 
“[With exceptions that do not apply here,] [a] party
seeking a default judgment on declarations must use mandatory Request for Entry
of Default (Application to Enter Default) (form CIV-100) . . . The following
must be included in the documents filed with the clerk: 
“(1)  Except in
unlawful detainer cases, a brief summary of the case identifying the parties
and the nature of plaintiff's claim; 
“(2) 
Declarations or other admissible evidence in support of the judgment
requested; 
“(3)  Interest
computations as necessary; 
“(4)  A
memorandum of costs and disbursements; 
“(5)  A
declaration of nonmilitary status for each defendant against whom judgment is
sought; 
“(6)  A proposed
form of judgment; 
“(7)  A dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not
sought or an application for separate judgment against specified parties under
Code of Civil Procedure section 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each
judgment; 
“(8)  Exhibits
as necessary; and 
“(9)  A request
for attorney fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.” 
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1800(a).) 
B.       Damages 
 The relief granted to a plaintiff upon entry
of a defendant's default cannot exceed the amount demanded in the complaint or,
for personal injury cases where damages may not be stated in the complaint, the
amount listed in the statement of damages. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 580, subd. (a),
585, subd. (b).) “The notice requirement of section 580 was designed to insure
fundamental fairness.” (Becker v. S.P.V. Construction Co. (1980) 27
Cal.3d 489, 494.) The statute insures that “defendants in cases which involve a
default judgment have adequate notice of the judgments that may be taken
against them. [Citation.] ‘If a judgment other than that which is demanded is
taken against him, [the defendant] has been deprived of his day in court—a
right to a hearing on the matter adjudicated.’ ’’ (Id. at p. 493.) A
trial court exceeds its jurisdiction if it awards damages in excess of the
amount specified in the complaint or statement of damages. (Id. at p.
494.) 
DISCUSSION 
          The CIV-100 form lacks the name and signature of a
declarant stating under penalty of perjury that items 4, 5 and 6 are correct.  The Court identified this defect in its May
23, 2024 order. 
In
addition, Section 6 in the CIV-100 form is not filled out. The Court identified this defect in its May 23, 2024
order. 
 The CIV-100 form states that Plaintiff is
requesting a total judgment of $413,026.84. 
The JUD-100 form states that Plaintiff is requesting a total judgment of
$413,026.65.  The figures should be
consistent. 
Plaintiff
requests $30,000.00 in future medical expenses but the application does not
provide evidence supporting the request. 
The
Court denies the application. 
CONCLUSION 
          The Court DENIES without prejudice the application for
default judgment filed by Plaintiff Maidia Leola Stillitano against Defendants Juventina
Acosta Funez and Jorge Hernandez on August 15, 2024. 
Plaintiff
is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Plaintiff
is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court within
five days.
