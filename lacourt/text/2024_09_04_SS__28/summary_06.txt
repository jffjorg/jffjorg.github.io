Summary:

The Court has ruled on a tentative ruling regarding a motion to compel discovery responses and a motion to deem admitted matters specified in requests for admission. The Court granted in part Plaintiff's motion to compel Defendant Alvarez's responses to requests for production of documents, special interrogatories, and requests for admission. The Court also granted in part Plaintiff's motion to compel Defendant Jonathan Sandoval's responses to form interrogatories. The Court denied Plaintiff's motion to compel Defendant Zaira Sandoval's responses to requests for production of documents and form interrogatories, as well as Plaintiff's motion to deem admitted matters specified in requests for admission served on Defendant Zaira Sandoval. The Court ordered Defendant Alvarez to pay Plaintiff $210.00 in sanctions and ordered Defendants to pay Plaintiff $810.00 in sanctions. The Court also ordered Plaintiff to pay the Court eight additional filing fees, totaling $480.00, because Plaintiff filed only two motions where ten were required.
