The Court has found that the Defendants did not owe the Plaintiff a duty of care because they relinquished control of the premises to Tesla, Inc. on October 19, 2017, and did not have actual knowledge of the dangerous condition of the gate. The Court has also found that the Lease Agreement gave Tesla the responsibility to maintain and repair the gate.

The Court has granted the motion for summary judgment and has ordered the moving parties to give notice of this ruling.
