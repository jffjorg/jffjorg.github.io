And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has considered the moving papers and rules as follows. The plaintiff, Angela Walker, filed an action against the defendants, including Joyce Faye Atlas, for negligence, premises liability, and dog bite. Atlas settled with the plaintiff and filed an unopposed application for a determination that the settlement was made in good faith. The Court notes that the overwhelming majority of motions for good faith determination are unopposed and granted summarily by the trial court. The Court finds that Atlas's motion satisfies the requirements of City of Grand Terrace v. Superior Court, which holds that when no one objects, the barebones motion with a brief background of the case is sufficient. Therefore, the Court grants the application and determines that the settlement between the plaintiff and defendant was made in good faith. The Court dismisses all pending and future claims against Defendant Joyce Faye Atlas by the parties served with this motion.
