 Case Number:  22STCV16894    Hearing Date:   February 13, 2024    Dept:  28 Having  reviewed the expedited petitions to approve minors’ compromises, the Court  rules as follows.  BACKGROUND            On May 23, 2022, Plaintiff Maria Sukie Marquez (“Marquez”) filed  this action against Defendants Milagro Gutierrez, Stephanie Gutierrez, and Roes  1-25 for motor vehicle tort and general negligence.            On May 15, 2023, Marquez, as petitioner, filed expedited petitions to approve the compromises of the  claims of minors April Magdelano and Noemi Magdelano.            On July 19, 2023, the Court denied the petitions because the  minors were not parties to the case.            On October 9, 2023, Plaintiffs Marquez, April Magdaleno, and  Noemi Magdaleno filed a first amended complaint against Defendants Milagro Gutierrez, Stephanie Gutierrez, and Roes  1-25 for motor vehicle tort and general negligence.            On November 28, 2023, Marquez filed expedited petitions to  approve the compromises of the claims of April Magdelano [sic] and  Noemi Magdelano [sic].  On  December 13, 2023, the Court denied the petitions because they included  inconsistent requests for distribution of the settlement proceeds.            On November 30, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a notice of settlement.                    On January 12, 2024, Marquez filed expedited petitions to approve the compromises of the  claims of minors April Magdelano [sic] and Noemi Magdelano [sic].  PETITIONER’S REQUESTS            Petitioner Maria Sukie Marquez asks the Court to approve  the compromises of the minors’ claims.  DISCUSSION   A.   April Magdelano [sic]  According  to the petition, total medical expenses for Claimant April Magdelano [sic]  were $4,140.00.  (Section 14a(1).)  The petition states that this amount was  reduced by $2,415.00 as the result of negotiations.  (Section 14a(3).)  The petition does not, however, provide any  evidence supporting the assertion that the medical providers agreed to reduce  their charges by $2,415.00.  Petitioner should provide evidence that the medical providers agreed to reduce their charges by this amount. The  petition also states that $1,825.00 of the medical expenses were paid (Section  14a(2)), but it does not state who paid these expenses or who is going to  receive $1,825.00 in reimbursement from the settlement proceeds (Section 14a(4)).  If none of the medical expenses have been paid to date, Petitioner should  revise Section 14a(2) and 14a(4) of the petition.  Defendant  Milagro Gutierrez has offered to pay $7,700.00 to Claimant April Magdelano [sic]  to settle the case.  $1,825.00 of the  gross settlement amount will pay medical liens and $1,925.00 will pay attorney’s  fees.  The remaining $3,950.00 will be deposited  in an insured, blocked account at Logix Credit Union, 18700 Ventura Blvd.,  Suite 110, Tarzana, CA 91356, subject to withdrawal only on Court  authorization.  The expedited  petition spells Claimant’s last name Magdelano, but the first amended complaint  spells her last name Magdaleno.  Petitioner  should correct the spelling in the expedited petition if it is incorrect or  amend the complaint if it is incorrect.  Petitioner  has used an outdated version of the Judicial Council expedited petition  form.  Petitioner should use the current  version of the Judicial Council expedited petition form.  B.   Noemi Magdelano [sic]  According  to the petition, total medical expenses for Claimant Noemi Magdelano [sic]  were $3,225.00.  (Section 14a(1).)  The petition states that this amount was  reduced by $1,710.00 as the result of negotiations.  (Section 14a(3).)  The petition does not, however, provide any  evidence supporting the assertion that the medical providers agreed to reduce their  charges by $1,710.00.  Petitioner should provide evidence that the medical providers agreed to reduce their charges by this amount.  The  petition also states that $1,515.00 of the medical expenses were paid (Section  14a(2)), but it does not state who paid these expenses or who is going to  receive $1,515.00 in reimbursement from the settlement proceeds (Section  14a(4)). If none of the medical expenses have been paid to date, Petitioner  should revise Section 14a(2) and 14a(4) of the petition.  Defendant  Milagro Gutierrez has offered to pay $6,800.00 to Claimant Noemi Magdelano [sic]  to settle the case.  $1,515.00 of the  gross settlement amount will pay medical liens and $1,700.00 will pay  attorney’s fees.  The remaining $3,585.00  will be deposited in an insured, blocked account at Logix Credit Union, 18700  Ventura Blvd., Suite 110, Tarzana, CA 91356, subject to withdrawal only on  Court authorization.  The expedited  petition spells Claimant’s last name Magdelano, but the first amended complaint  spells her last name Magdaleno.   Petitioner should correct the spelling in the expedited petition if it  is incorrect or amend the complaint if it is incorrect.  Petitioner  has used an outdated version of the Judicial Council expedited petition  form.  Petitioner should use the current  version of the Judicial Council expedited petition form.  CONCLUSION            The Court CONTINUES the hearing on the expedited petitions  and orders Petitioner to file revised petitions addressing the comments above  prior to the continued hearing.  The  Court will provide dates for the continued hearing and the deadline to file the  revised petitions at the February 13, 2024 hearing.            Petitioner is ordered to give notice.
