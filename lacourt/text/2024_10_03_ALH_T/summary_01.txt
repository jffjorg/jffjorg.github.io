And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion filed by Best American Toxicology Testing Services LLC (BATTS) for determination of good faith settlement. The case involves a premises liability claim by Evan McNiel, who fell through a ceiling while working at a property owned by Northwest Industrial Center. BATTS and the plaintiff reached a tentative settlement of $75,000, which was confirmed on August 27, 2024. The judge finds that the settlement was made in good faith, considering the factors set forth in California Code of Civil Procedure § 877.6, including the amount paid in settlement, the allocation of settlement proceeds among plaintiffs, and the financial conditions and insurance policy limits of settling defendants. The judge also finds that there is no indication of collusion, fraud, or tortious conduct aimed at any other party. Therefore, the judge grants BATTS' motion for determination of good faith settlement.
