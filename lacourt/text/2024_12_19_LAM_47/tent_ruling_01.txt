STATEMENT
OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
            This is an action for trespass, nuisance, negligence, and intentional
interference with contract. Plaintiff alleges that Defendants have failed to
comply with local zoning ordinances pertaining to a building materials salvage
yard which they operate. 
 
Attorney Donald A. Velez moves to
be relieved as counsel for all Defendants. 
 
//
            
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Attorney Donald A. Velez moves to
be relieved as counsel for all Defendants. Although Moving Counsel served and
filed a motion and supporting affidavit, neither was presented on the mandatory
Judicial Council forms MC-051 and MC-052 as required by Rule of Court 3.1362
subdivision (a). Moreover, Moving Counsel failed to lodge a proposed order on
mandatory form MC-053 with the moving papers as required by subdivision (e) of
that rule. Moving Counsel’s motion is therefore defective.
 
Accordingly, Attorney Donald A.
Velez’s Motion to be Relieved as Counsel is DENIED. This ruling is without
prejudice to a procedurally proper motion. 
 
This ruling is conditioned on
Moving Counsel giving notice to all parties and filing proof of service with
the Court. 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.

            Any party may submit on the
tentative ruling by contacting the courtroom via email at Smcdept47@lacourt.org by no later than 4:00 p.m. the day
before the hearing. All interested parties must be copied on the email. It
should be noted that if you submit on a tentative ruling the court will still
conduct a hearing if any party appears. By submitting on the tentative you
have, in essence, waived your right to be present at the hearing, and you
should be aware that the court may not adopt the tentative, and may issue an
order which modifies the tentative ruling in whole or in part.
