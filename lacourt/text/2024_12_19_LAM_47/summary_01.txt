The judge, Theresa M. Traber, has issued a tentative ruling on December 19, 2024, regarding a motion filed by Attorney Donald A. Velez to be relieved as counsel for all defendants in the case Stanford Neighborhood Association LLC v. Miranda Logistics Enterprise, Inc. The motion was filed on behalf of the defendants, Miranda Logistics Enterprise, Inc., Grit & Gravel Inc, and United Pacific Waste. The judge has denied the motion due to procedural defects, as the moving counsel failed to file required documents, specifically the mandatory Judicial Council forms MC-051, MC-052, and MC-053. The judge has given notice that this ruling is without prejudice to a procedurally proper motion, and that moving counsel must give notice to all parties and file proof of service with the court.
