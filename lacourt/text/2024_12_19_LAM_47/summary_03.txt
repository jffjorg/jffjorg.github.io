And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has reviewed the Plaintiff's ex parte application for an order shortening time to hear their motion to compel Joseph Davis to produce documents. The Court denies the request for immediate emergency relief, finding that the scheduling issues faced by the Plaintiff are partly due to their own delay in seeking relief. The Court notes that if the Plaintiff had moved faster, they would have benefited from the oversight of Judge Beaudet, who could have adjusted the calendar to shorten time for relief or continued the summary judgment hearing. Instead, the Court continues the hearing on the Plaintiff's ex parte application to January 3, 2025, when Judge Beaudet will be available to consider the scheduling concerns. The Court orders counsel for the Moving Party to give notice, and this ruling will be the final ruling on the matter.
