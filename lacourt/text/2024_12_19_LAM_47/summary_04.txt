And here is the summary in English text:

The court has reviewed an ex parte application by Quantum Corporation to continue the trial for 60 days to the week of May 5, 2025, and to extend all relevant deadlines. The application is based on a motion for judgment on the pleadings filed by Third-Party Defendant Larkin Benefit Administrators, which is set for hearing on January 3, 2025. Quantum speculates that the court's ruling on this motion may require time for the filing of amended pleadings and further motions practice to challenge Quantum's amended pleadings. The court finds that Quantum has not demonstrated exigent circumstances justifying ex parte relief, especially since Department 50 is dark for the holidays. Therefore, the court denies the immediate relief sought and continues the hearing on the ex parte application to January 3, 2025, at 2:00 p.m. in Department 50, along with the motion for judgment on the pleadings.
