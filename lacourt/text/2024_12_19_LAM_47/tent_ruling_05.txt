 Case Number:  23STCV15028    Hearing Date:   December 19, 2024    Dept:  47 The Court has reviewed the ex parte application for an order
compelling the mental examination of Plaintiff or shortening time for hearing
and notice of such a motion.  The ex parte application is denied. 
Given the trial date of June 17, 2025, the Court finds Defendant has failed to
demonstrate exigent circumstances justifying ex parte relief.  That
Defendant’s expert has offered certain dates in January 2025 does not create
any exigency justifying an immediate order.  As to the request for
alternate relief, the Court denies the request for an order shortening time for
hearing and notice of such a motion because Defendant has not yet filed the
proper noticed motion and secured a hearing date that would allow the Court to
evaluate a request for shortened time.  This ruling is without prejudice
to Defendant seeking to advance a noticed hearing after a proper motion has
been filed.
 
Counsel for the Moving Party is ordered to give notice.
 
The Court is engaged in a jury trial and will not be calling
this ex parte for hearing.
