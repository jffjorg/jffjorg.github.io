And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has reviewed the motions for summary judgment and summary adjudication filed by the defendants, Ken Sampson, Dey Sampson, and The Boardroom MDR, LLC. The plaintiffs, Scott Norlund and Kathryn Kavanagh, have objected to certain declarations and exhibits submitted by the defendants.

The Court finds that the defendants have failed to meet their burden of proof in support of their motion for summary judgment or adjudication. The Court rules that certain objections to declarations and exhibits submitted by the defendants are sustained.

As a result, the Court denies the defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment and Motion for Summary Adjudication. The Court finds that the defendants have not demonstrated that the plaintiffs' claims lack merit with respect to any cause of action.

The Court orders that the defendants' motions be denied and that the parties may submit on the tentative ruling by contacting the courtroom via email by the day before the hearing.
