CASE

TRIAL:                      9/26/23 to 10/6/23 (JURY) 

 

 
TENTATIVE RULING
                                             
MOTION: 
    Defendant’s Motion to Tax Costs
                                                     DENIED
 
 
      Plaintiffs
(collectively “P”) won a jury trial regarding injuries sustained by P in an
assault at D’s casino.  The jury awarded
P $7,150 in damages.  P submitted a Cost
Memorandum on 3/15/24, seeking $13,848.53 in costs.  D now brings this motion to tax those costs
in their entirety.  P opposes this motion
as time barred and/or substantively without merit.  
 
 
I.               
Timeliness of motion 
 
Under
Cal.R.Ct. § 3.1700(b)(1), a motion to tax costs must be served and filed 15
days after 
service of
the cost memorandum.  There is no
additional extension under CCP § 1010.6(a)(4), as the date of electronic
service, March 15, 2024, was a court day (Friday).  15 days after 3/15/24 is 3/30/24, but since
that day is a Saturday, CCP § 12a(a) thereby extends the due date for D’s Motion
to Tax to Monday, April 1, 2024.  Here, D
filed the instant motion to tax on 4/2/24, one day beyond the deadline to
file.  As such, D’s Motion is untimely
and is hereby DENIED.
 
II.             
DISCRETIONARY
TAXING OF COSTS
 
Had
D’s motion not been time barred, this Court would have exercised its discretion
under 
CCP § 1033(a)
to substantially reduce P’s claimed costs by at least half.  This Court agrees with D’s argument that this
matter should have been brought as a limited civil (or even small claims) case
given that there was no dispute that the guards who assaulted P were employees
of ACI, owner of the hotel, and not D, the owner of the casino.  Although P did suffer substantial damages,
there should have been no doubt that any rational jury would attribute a
majority (if not all) of the fault to the actual employer of the assaulters,
ACI.  Moreover, it also should have been
foreseen that the offset applied from ACI’s settlement figure to D’s proportion
of economic damages would leave little net economic damages attributable to D
(which indeed happened here).  This case
would have been a good example where the policies behind § 1033 in discouraging
plaintiffs from “over filing” their cases would have been justly served by a substantial
reduction in costs.  Fortunately for P, D
waived this argument by missing their filing deadline.
