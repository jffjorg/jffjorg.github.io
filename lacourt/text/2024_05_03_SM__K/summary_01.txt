Here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendant's motion to tax the plaintiff's costs in their entirety. The plaintiff was awarded $7,150 in damages after winning a jury trial. The defendant sought to tax the plaintiff's costs, which totaled $13,848.53. However, the judge ruled that the defendant's motion was untimely, as it was filed one day after the deadline. Even if the motion had been timely, the judge would have reduced the plaintiff's costs by at least half due to the case's frivolous nature. The judge noted that the case would have been better suited for a limited civil or small claims case and that the plaintiff's costs were excessive.
