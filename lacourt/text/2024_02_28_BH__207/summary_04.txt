Here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The Judge rules that the two lawsuits, Robson v. Doe 1 and Safechuck v. Doe 1, shall be consolidated for a joint trial. The lawsuits were filed by Wade Robson and James Safechuck, who both allege that they were sexually abused by Michael Jackson when they were minors. The cases involve similar defendants, MJJ Productions, Inc. and MJJ Ventures, Inc., and overlapping time frames. The Judge finds that consolidation is warranted due to the common issues of fact and law between the two cases. The Court grants the Plaintiffs' unopposed motions to consolidate the cases and orders that Robson v. Doe 1 shall be designated as the lead case.
