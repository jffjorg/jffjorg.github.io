And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of consolidating two lawsuits, Robson v. Doe 1 and Safechuck v. Doe 1, which were filed by Wade Robson and James Safechuck against MJJ Productions, Inc. and MJJ Ventures, Inc. The lawsuits allege sexual abuse committed by Michael Jackson, the late entertainer, during overlapping time frames. The judge has concluded that the cases present common issues of fact and law regarding the same underlying conduct, involving the same defendants and many of the same witnesses. As a result, the judge has granted the plaintiffs' motion to consolidate the cases for all purposes, with Robson v. Doe 1 designated as the lead case.
