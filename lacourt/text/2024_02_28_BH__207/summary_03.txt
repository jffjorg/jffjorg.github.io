And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled on Ford Motor Company's demurrer to the complaint filed by Eddie Baruta, the plaintiff. The demurrer was filed in response to the plaintiff's claims that the vehicle he purchased from Ford in 2018 had defects that were not disclosed to him at the time of purchase. The judge has found that the plaintiff has adequately alleged that Ford concealed the defects and that the statute of limitations has not run. The judge has also found that the plaintiff has adequately pleaded the required elements for a claim of fraudulent concealment. The judge has overruled Ford's demurrer and ordered Ford to file an answer to the complaint by March 15, 2024.
