And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the motion of Daniel T. Schmaeling, Esq. (Counsel) to be relieved as counsel for Defendant Jun Han. Counsel has filed the necessary forms, including a declaration stating that the motion was filed instead of a consent because the client has accepted the tender of Defendant Jun Han to new counsel. The judge has found that the motion is substantively and procedurally proper. The judge orders Counsel to serve the signed order on Defendant Han and all other parties who have appeared in the action, and to file a proof of service within 10 days of the date of the order. Counsel will remain the attorney of record for Defendant Han until the proof of service is filed.
