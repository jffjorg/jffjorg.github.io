 Case Number:  24VECV00232    Hearing Date:   October 25, 2024    Dept:  T Navasardyan v GM 24VECV00232
Tentative ruling:  The deposition of the Person Most Qualified at GM is ordered to appear for deposition on 11/12/2024 at 9:30 a.m. by Zoom or on any date and time agreed to IN WRITING by counsel.  The categories on which the PMQ is ordered to appear are as follows:  1, 2 (only as to Southern California Cadillacs), 3, 4, 6 (only as to repairs or warranty work), 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 17 (only as to Southern California Cadillacs), 22 (only as to Southern California Cadillacs), 31.  Because there was no separate statement in violation of CRC 3.1345(a)(5), no documents are ordered to be produced.  However, this does not obviate GM’s responsibility to produce documents as the law requires.
Before sanctions are awarded, the court inquires into the argument made by defense counsel that plaintiffs are noticing multiple depositions of PMQ’s in multiple cases on the same days, knowing that they could not possibly cover the depositions.  For instance, when the deposition notice originally went out on this case, were other PMQ’s also noticed for that same date?  There is no documentation of plaintiff’s seeking a date for the deposition before unilaterally noticing this deposition.  There does not appear to be any additional meet and confer prior to the second notice served on 6/5/2024.  Did plaintiff notice other depositions on that date as well? Because of questionable meet and confer tactics, the court will reserve the issue of monetary sanctions.
