  - "Asserting an arbitration provision in the attached Purchase Agreement is not proper grounds for a general demurrer because it is not a defense or bar to recovery."
  - "The arbitration provision, if enforceable, merely dictates the forum within which the claims are to be resolved."
  - "Defendant's argument relying upon the arbitration provision is not persuasive and OVERRULED."
  - "Because the theory of the COA is uncertain, it is not yet possible to determine the proper and relevant SOL."
  - "Because the negligence COA is uncertain as to the factual grounds for the COA, the negligence COA fails to plead sufficient facts as to the element of duty or breach â€“ whether it be a negligent misrepresentation claim or a construction defect claim."

And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by Defendant Matan Laytin to the Complaint filed by Plaintiff Andrew McGinnis. The demurrer was filed in response to the first cause of action (COA) for negligence, the second COA for breach of contract, and the third COA for breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.

The Judge has sustained the demurrer with 20 days leave to amend as to the first COA for negligence, finding that the allegations are uncertain and fail to plead sufficient facts as to the element of duty or breach. The Judge has also sustained the demurrer with leave to amend as to the second and third COAs, finding that the claims are similar to the claims made in an arbitration action pending between the parties.

The Judge has overruled the demurrer as to the "as is" contract provision, finding that it is not applicable to defects hidden from the buyer and known by the seller.

The Judge has granted Plaintiff's request for judicial notice of a Motion in Limine filed by Defendant, but has not judicially noticed any hearsay or disputed facts. The Judge has also granted Defendant's request for judicial notice of two other complaints filed in arbitration actions, but has not judicially noticed any hearsay or disputed facts.

The Judge has ordered the Clerk to give notice of the tentative ruling.
