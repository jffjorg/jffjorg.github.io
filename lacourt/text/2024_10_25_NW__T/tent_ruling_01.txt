  Case Number:  22VECV00477    Hearing Date:   October 25, 2024    Dept:  T 22VECV00477
McGinnis v Basson
Motion to reset the trial McGinnis v Basson/Compass: no opposition was
filed.  If the court resets the trial, it
must be very specifically stated for the record what is being tried.  The court reviewed the memo from the
Arbitrator and understands that the only issues to be tried in this case would
be any duties owed by Basson/Compass to McGinnis vis-a-vis non-disclosures or misrepresentations
concerning the ADU, an unpermitted wall on the Southwest side of the property,
and some problems with the pool fences which caused the pool to not be
permitted.  The court will discuss
further at the hearing.
