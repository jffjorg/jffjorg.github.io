 Case Number:  23VECV01030    Hearing Date:   October 25, 2024    Dept:  T HART V LASALLE 23VECV01030
Tentative rulings for 10/25/2024
These
are tentative.  The court reserves the
right to make any changes it deems appropriate when making its final orders.  
1.         Hearing on Motion to Compel Production
of Documents; Request for monetary sanctions against LaSalle and Ashan Peiris -
filed by plaintiff on 8/27/2024
The
court only addresses the requests identified by number in the Notice of Motion.
Defendant
is ordered to provide a verified response to Nos. 1-9, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17,
18 using Code Compliant language without objection and produce the documents
requested -- or identify by number responsive documents already produced --
within 20 days. The objections are overruled and stricken.
The
court denies as to No. 20.

2.         The Court's Order to Show Cause Re:
sanctions against Ashan Peiris in the sum of $500.00 for his violation of
Evidence Code section 1119
The
court accepts the declaration and discharges the OSC.  No sanctions.

3.         Hearing on Motion to Compel further
responses to Special Interrogatories; monetary sanctions; terminating sanctions
- filed by plaintiff on 9/3/2024
Plaintiff
Shelly Hart moved the court for an order compelling defendant LASALLE
INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT, INC. (“LASALLE”) to serve verified further responses
without objections to Special Interrogatories [Set No. 1] Nos. 1-7, 10-17 and
23.
The
motion is granted as to Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 15, 16 and 23.  The court denies as to Nos. 11, 12, 13, 14
and sustains the objections that the interrogatories are argumentative and
assume facts.
The
request to strike defenses is denied as there has been no violation of a court
order and that would be an inappropriate remedy.
LaSalle’s
counsel indicated they are agreeable to producing responses to special
interrogatory nos. 1 - 7, 16, 17 and 23 without court intervention and that the
further responses will be provided before the hearing on this matter and will
be available at the hearing for review.  However, at the time of posting this tentative,
nothing further has been provided to the court.
Monetary
sanctions are awarded.  The court finds
the explanation that counsel thought they interrogatories were about the other
case to be extremely weak and sloppy. 
Monetary sanctions in the amount of $91.50 are awarded against defendant
LaSalle Investment Management and Ashan Peiris, jointly and severally, pursuant
to CCP section 2023.010, discovery abuse without substantial justification,
payable to Shelly Hart at her address of record by 11/15/2024.

4.         The Court's Order to Show Cause Re:
sanctions against Ashan Peiris in the sum of $250.00 for his violation of the
court’s order of 6/21/2024 pursuant to CCP section 177.5 by continuing to file
and/or serve documents in this case using the Sullivan caption.
Mr.
Peiris has been warned several times.  It
is far past the time for Mr. Peiris to fix this problem and he continues to
sign and file documents with the wrong caption. This is inexcusable neglect and
cannot be sanctioned.  It has resulted in
several documents filed in this case with the incorrect caption.  He has never resubmitted the documents with
the correct caption.  The court finds
that Mr. Peiris willfully violated the court's order of 6/21/2024 and assesses
$250 in sanctions pursuant to CCP section 177.5, payable to the Clerk of the
Court no later than 11/15/2024.
Continued
violation of the court's order will result in additional sanctions of $250
against Mr. Peiris.

5.         Trial Setting Conference
The
Court's intent is to set trial in June 2025.

6.         Hearing - Other Re: Revised Tentative
Ruling on Plaintiff's Motion for Sanctions
The
allegation by plaintiff is that the usual and customary emails which are sent
between employees for work orders and the like are being called "attorney
client privilege" merely because they cc the attorneys on them so that Ms.
Hart cannot see them.  If this is the
case, it is abuse of the privilege and can be a concern for the court.  The court will discuss this further at the
time of the hearing.  One cannot add an
attorney to all of its internal business emails and expect them to be
privileged as a result.  Facts are not
privileged merely because they are told to an attorney.  Moreover, they are not confidential merely
because they cc the attorney.
 
While
Mr. Dupree objects to an evidentiary sanction deeming that he knows who put the
graffiti on the wall, he refused to name the people he spoke with about
it.  Given that there is no other way to
identify potential witnesses as he refuses to give names, the court is
satisfied that the sanction is appropriate.
 
Concerning
the W-9, the court does not believe the evidence establishes that Mr. Dupree
exhausted all possible sources for this information.  Did he talk to the CEO? CFO? Accounting
office? The CPA?  His response does not
indicate who he talked to.  The court
believes the sanction is appropriate.  If
he is unwilling to take all reasonable steps to get this information which
should be available to him, then the sanction is appropriate.
­­__________________________________________________
7.         The Court ordered each party (or groups
of parties) to submit a list of depositions they wish to take in this case with
a time estimate for each person. According to the list, all defendants only
want 2 depositions.  The remainder are
requested by plaintiff.
The
parties are ordered to work out a schedule for the depositions listed.  These lists put all parties on notice that
dates are requested.  Nothing more
needs to be done to indicate that you are awaiting dates.  Parties should then serve notices for these
depositions. If the dates for deposition are not reasonably given, i.e., within
2 weeks of notice, then file motions to compel with request for sanctions.
Concerning
persons who are not employed by the defendants, subpoenas will need to be
personally served for those depositions in order to be enforced.  Concerning the deposition of Mr. Palmer, for
the motion coming up, if he was personally served with a subpoena and then did
not provide dates for his deposition, then the court will order it with the
filing of the proof of service of the subpoena. 
If he was not personally served with the subpoena and he is no longer
working for a defendant, the court cannot order his deposition.  If he was noticed for deposition while he
worked there but no longer works there, a subpoena is required.  The court cannot enforce a notice of
deposition on a person no longer working there because the defendant has no
control to make him appear if he is no longer an employee.  The same applies to Robyn Christy, Michelle
Zapata, or Anabell Borges or any other former employee.  The court cannot make an attorney accept
service on a client.  The court will,
however, enforce discovery to obtain the last known addresses, new employer,
and telephone numbers of these former employees.
The
court notes that Alphonsus Palmer is not on the list.
How
many people will be deposed from the Dept. of Health?  How many Clockwork Contractors? Who are the
neighbors? 
Concerning
the LLC, the court has not ruled that the LLC is not Plaintiff's landlord and
if she does not depose it, it is her decision if she is wrong.
With
a trial being set next year, the court does not want there to be difficulties
in getting depositions set.  The court
will set a review conference every 6 weeks or so to check on the status of depositions.

in filing a new lawsuit, anyone with knowledge is immediately required to file
a Notice of Related cases.
