And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court is considering a request for a temporary restraining order (TRO) to prevent dogs from entering the Rodnunsky property. The court is inclined to grant the TRO, requiring dogs to remain at least 100 yards from the property lines. A hearing on the preliminary injunction is set for November 18, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. The summons and complaint must be served, and the TRO/OSC must be served in the same manner as a summons and complaint, with proof of service filed no later than 2 court days before the hearing. The court will likely issue an order for a bond to issue a preliminary injunction. If the TRO goes beyond November 18, 2024, the court will order a $2,500 bond or cash deposit be provided by the moving party prior to the reissuance of the TRO.
