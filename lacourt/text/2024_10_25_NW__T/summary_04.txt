And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case between T Navasardyan and GM. The judge orders the deposition of the Person Most Qualified (PMQ) at GM to appear on November 12, 2024, at 9:30 a.m. by Zoom or on a date and time agreed to in writing by counsel. The PMQ is required to appear for deposition on specific categories, including Southern California Cadillacs. However, no documents are ordered to be produced, but GM remains responsible to produce documents under law.

The judge is concerned about the meet and confer tactics used by the plaintiff, including noticing multiple depositions of PMQs on the same day, which may have been impossible to cover. The judge also notes that there is no documentation of the plaintiff seeking a date for the deposition before noticing it, and that there was no additional meet and confer prior to the second notice served on June 5, 2024. Due to these questionable tactics, the judge will reserve the issue of monetary sanctions.
