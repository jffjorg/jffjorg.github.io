 Case Number:  24VECV05225    Hearing Date:   October 25, 2024    Dept:  T 24VECV05225
RODUNSKY V MARTIN
 
Request for
TRO: The form of the OSC and TRO will need to be revised but the court is
inclined to grant a TRO for to dogs to remain at least 100 yards from the
property lines of the Rodnunsky property with the hearing on the preliminary
injunction to take place on 11/18/2024 at 8:30 a.m.  The summons and complaint needs to be served
and the TRO/OSC must be served in the same manner as a summons and complaint no
later than 5 court days prior to the hearing with proof of service filed no
later than 2 court days before the hearing. The court will likely issue an
order for a bond to issue a preliminary injunction. If there is a lease
agreement, the court will need to see it. If the TRO goes beyond November 18,
2024, the court will order a $2,500 bond or cash deposit be provided by moving
party prior to the reissuance of the TRO.

or if the party against whom the preliminary injunction is sought has not
appeared in the action. If the responding party has not appeared, the OSC must
be served in the same manner as a summons and complaint.
