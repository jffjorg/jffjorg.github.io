All
further undesignated statutory references are to this code.

Petitioner
dismissed the County of Los Angeles from this proceeding on August 15, 2023.


[3]
Mistake,
inadvertence and/or surprise also serve as grounds to relieve a petitioner from
timely presentation of a claim.


[4]
The
Blumenthal declaration is actually attached to the petition (Exhibit H) as part
of late claim application submitted to the cities and county.


[5]
There
is no evidence before the court about Petitioner’s understanding. The petition
is unverified so it has no evidentiary value. 


[6]
As
noted by the City of Compton, “In finding that petitioner had demonstrated
excusable neglect, the court noted that the petitioner ‘spent the first three
months in the hospital, and the remainder of the six-month period confined to
her bed at home. Depressed, in pain, and under the influence of medication,
[petitioner’s] attention was directed toward learning the basis tasks of
everyday life, such as eating, hold a toothbrush, and controlling her
elimination of waste. During that six-month period, she was unable to even sit
up without assistance, and did not so much as leave her bedroom to watch
television.’ ” (City of Compton Opposition 12:17-24.)


[7]
The
exact number of attorneys with whom the claimant consulted within the 100-day
period is not entirely clear.


[8]
Accordingly,
the court disregards the unsupported claim of what Petitioner may have been
feeling based on the accident. The
court cannot determine whether Petitioner acted as a reasonably prudent person
in her situation without evidence of her situation.

Nilsson
v. City of Los Angeles discussed Viles v. State of
California (1967) 66 Cal.2d 24 in its decision. The petitioner in Viles
v. State of California supported his request of the court with evidence to
explain his delay. (Id. at 27, 29.)
