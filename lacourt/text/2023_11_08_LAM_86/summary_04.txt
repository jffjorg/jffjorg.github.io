And here is the English text summary:

This tentative ruling addresses the Threshold Eviction Ordinance and its potential conflicts with state law. The ordinance aims to mitigate the harm caused by rent increases on tenants of unregulated units by providing relocation assistance. The court notes that the ordinance's purpose is not simply procedural, but rather substantive, as it directly affects the timing of evictions and gives tenants more time to pay rental arrearages. The court also highlights the legislative history, which shows that the ordinance is intended to help tenants who are not protected by state law or the Rent Stabilization Ordinance. The court requests further argument on how the ordinance does not contradict state law, particularly with regards to the Ellis Act relocation assistance.
