And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a petition for relief from the timely presentation of a claim. The petitioner claims that they were excusably negligent in not presenting their claim on time due to hospitalization and confinement to bed after an accident. The judge notes that the petition is unverified and therefore has no evidentiary value. However, the judge is considering the Blumenthal declaration, which is attached to the petition, and the City of Compton's opposition. The judge is also considering the case law, particularly Nilsson v. City of Los Angeles, which discussed the case Viles v. State of California. The judge is weighing the petitioner's situation, including their limited mobility and inability to perform daily tasks, against the need for evidence of their understanding and the lack of evidence about their consultation with attorneys. The judge will make a final decision based on this analysis.
