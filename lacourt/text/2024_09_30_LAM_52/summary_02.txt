And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled to stay the entire action pending resolution of the arbitration proceeding between plaintiff Jad Abulhusn and defendant United Services Automobile Association. The court has vacated the hearing on defendant's motion to compel arbitration. The defendant had moved to compel arbitration of plaintiff's individual claims under the Private Attorneys General Act (PAGA) and stay the representative PAGA claims. The court found that staying the action would serve the interest of judicial economy and prevent inefficient, duplicative litigation. The court also noted that the ongoing arbitration may resolve issues involved in the PAGA action, and that a finding in the arbitration that defendant subjected plaintiff to a violation of the Labor Code could establish plaintiff's standing under PAGA.
