The Judge sustains the demurrer on the grounds that the plaintiff's claims are untimely and uncertain due to the lack of specific dates of events and the failure to allege sufficient facts for fraud, conversion, and negligence. The Judge also finds that the plaintiff's claims are barred by the statute of limitations and the economic loss rule. The Judge grants the defendants 20 days' leave to amend their demurrer.
