 Case Number:  24STCV09856    Hearing Date:   September 30, 2024    Dept:  52 Defendant
United Services Automobile Association’s Motion to Compel Arbitration and Stay
Proceedings; Order to Show Cause Re: Why the Action Should Not Be Stayed
Defendant
United Services Automobile Association moves to compel arbitration of plaintiff
Jad Abulhusn’s individual claims under the Private Attorneys General Act (PAGA)
and stay the representative PAGA claims.  
At
the prior hearing on this motion, the court issued an order to show cause why
this action should not be stayed.  Courts
generally have discretion to stay actions to serve the interest of judicial
economy.  (See Landis v. North
American Co. (1936) 299 U.S. 248, 254; Freiberg v. City of Mission Viejo (1995)
33 Cal.App.4th 1484, 1489.)  The
parties are currently arbitrating a dispute over other employment claims by
plaintiff.  Plaintiff’s amended demand
for arbitration asserts defendant wrongfully terminated him in violation of
public policy, violated the Fair Employment and Housing Act, and violated Labor
Code sections 201, 202, 203, 226, 226.7, 227.3, 510, 512, 1194, 1197, and
2802.  (Chandrashekar Decl., ¶ 6, Ex. D.)  
Staying
this action pending resolution of the arbitration proceeding will serve the
interest of judicial economy.  Assuming
defendant cannot enforce the parties’ arbitration agreement as to any part of
this PAGA action, the ongoing arbitration may resolve issues involved in this proceeding.  “To have PAGA standing, a plaintiff must be
an ‘aggrieved employee’ — that is, (1) ‘someone “who was employed by the
alleged violator” ’ and (2) ‘ “against whom one or more of the alleged
violations was committed.” ’ ”  (Adolph
v. Uber Technologies, Inc. (2023) 14 Cal.5th 1104, 1114.)  A finding in the arbitration that defendant subjected
plaintiff to a violation of the Labor Code could establish plaintiff is an
aggrieved employee with standing under PAGA. 
(See id. at pp. 1123-1124.) 
A contrary finding could establish plaintiff is not an aggrieved
employee and has no standing to bring this PAGA action.  Staying this action is likely to prevent
inefficient, duplicative litigation.
Disposition
            The court hereby exercises its
discretion to stay the entire action pending resolution of the
arbitration proceeding between plaintiff Jad Abulhusn and defendant United
Services Automobile Association.  The
court hereby vacates the hearing on defendant’s motion to compel
arbitration.
