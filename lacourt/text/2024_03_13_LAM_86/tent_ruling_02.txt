[1] All undesignated statutory references are to this
code.


[2] Petitioners do not argue any of these TCN Structures
were approved by City.
 


[3] While it is true Petitioners do not specifically
refer to TCN Structure FF-25 in their arguments about AES-PDF-1, Petitioners’ arguments
would nonetheless be applicable to TCN Structure FF-25. For that additional
reason, the court cannot find Petitioners’ claims related to AES-PDF-1 are
moot.


[4] “Guidelines” refers to
the regulations for the implementation of CEQA authorized by the Legislature (§
21083) and codified in title 14, section 15000 et seq. of the California
Code of Regulations (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15000 et seq.).


[5]
In Tuolomne, the Court of Appeal (Fifth District) asked whether the acts
in question were “related to each other.” (Id. at 1225.) Recently, another
Court of Appeal (Third District) criticized that test noting “[i]f we construe
that line of reasoning broadly, it suggests that two acts close in time and
location and undertaken by the same entity are more likely to be considered
part of a larger whole.” (Planning and Conservation League v. Department
of Water Resources (2024) 98 Cal.App.5th 726, 752 [PCL].) “[C]ourts
have since construed cases relying on this logic [from Tuolomne] as
limited to their facts.” (Ibid.)  


[6] Petitioners report Metro installed the Carson
billboard in 2016. (Opening Brief 11:9-11.) The court agrees the Board Report
supports that inference.  


[7] As Respondents argue, Petitioners also do not show
prejudice as to the environmental review for the three digital billboards in
Downey, Long Beach, and Carson. Because those billboards were installed in
2016, “the time to challenge the scope of the environmental review for the
prior signs expired long ago.” (Opposition 15:1.) Petitioners develop no
argument to the contrary in reply. 


[8] For example, Petitioners assert
“Articles from Dr. Travis Longcore found impacts with light trespass as low as
0.01 fc for rodents (AR 2939 [0.1 lux equals 0.009 fc]), 0.018 fc for fireflies
(AR 2940 [0.2 lux equals 0.018 fc]), and 0.027 fc for songbirds (AR 2940 [0.3
lux equals 0.027 fc]).” (Opening Brief 18:8-10.) However, Petitioners do not
discuss the relevant legal standard for assessing (or challenging) an agency’s
significance threshold selection. To the extent Petitioners suggest Metro
should have selected a lower significance threshold or one that was not based
on the LAMC light regulations, Petitioners do not support that argument with
legal analysis. Accordingly, Petitioners do not show a prejudicial abuse of
discretion under CEQA.  (See Defend
the Bay v. City of Irvine (2004) 119 Cal.App.4th 1261, 1266. [“A reviewing court will not independently
review the record to make up for appellant's failure to carry his burden.”])  
 


[9] The FHWA Critique also reports: “Given the lack of
information provided by the study’s authors about key details of their
research, the apparent internal conflicts in critical data provided, and the
problems with the experimental equipment, a reader is unable to assess the
validity of the findings as presented.” 
(AR 4828.)


[10] While Respondents argue Petitioners did not exhaust
this argument, Petitioners have cited some evidence in reply demonstrating the
issue was raised below. In any event, the court reaches the same result even if
Petitioners did not exhaust the issue.


[11] While neither side has moved to augment the
administrative record with these materials, as the parties all rely on this
extra-record evidence, the court considers them.
