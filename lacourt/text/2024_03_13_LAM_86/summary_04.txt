And here is the English-text summary:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the matter before it. The case involves a subpoena issued by the Office of Independent Review (OIG) and a dispute over its scope. The court notes that the subpoena was issued to the Sheriff, but only named Sheriff Luna as the responding party. The court also notes that PPOA was not a party to the ALADS litigation, but has filed a brief in excess of the page limit. Despite this, the court has exercised its discretion to consider the entire brief.

The court has also considered the ERCOM order, which outlines a process for meet-and-confer between the parties to establish a schedule for negotiations. The order requires the parties to report any agreement as to the schedule for negotiations and provides for the Commission to consider an application by any party to issue a supplemental decision and order establishing the negotiations schedule.

The court has not yet made a final ruling on the matter, but has set forth its thoughts and intentions based on the information presented to it.
