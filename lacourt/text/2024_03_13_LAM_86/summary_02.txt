Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case brought by Petitioners against Respondents. Petitioners are challenging the environmental review for three digital billboards installed in 2016 in Downey, Long Beach, and Carson. The judge has ruled that Petitioners' claims are not moot, as they would still be applicable to the installation of the Carson billboard, which was installed in 2016. The judge has also ruled that Petitioners did not show prejudice as to the environmental review, as the time to challenge the scope of the review had expired long ago. Additionally, the judge found that Petitioners did not discuss the relevant legal standard for assessing an agency's significance threshold selection, and therefore did not show a prejudicial abuse of discretion under CEQA. Finally, the judge considered extra-record evidence presented by both sides, despite neither side having moved to augment the administrative record.
