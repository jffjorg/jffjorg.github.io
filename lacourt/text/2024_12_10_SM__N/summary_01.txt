And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to compel the production of Patrick Nangle's T-Mobile phone records. The plaintiff, Carol Steiner, is seeking records from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2018 and from January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2022 to show that Nangle, the defendant, received a kickback in exchange for brokering a loan. The judge has ordered T-Mobile to produce the records within 30 days. The plaintiff's claim against Nangle is that he brokered the loan while knowing that James Byron Clark had no authority to do so. The judge has limited the scope of the original subpoena, which was deemed overbroad, to seek only the specified records.
