	+ Punitive damages of $75,000,000.00
* Wrongful death:
	+ Economic damages of $2,137,190.25 jointly and severally against the defendants
	+ Non-economic damages of $29,530,000.00, to be awarded separately against each defendant in proportion to their percentage of fault

The judge has also allocated fault among the defendants as follows:

* E.F. Brady Company, Inc.: 10%
* Elementis Chemicals, Inc.: 5%

The judge has granted settlement credit to the defendants in the amount of $668,853.75, which reduces the economic damages award under the survival claim to $0 and the economic damages award under the wrongful death claim to $2,137,190.25. The judge has also required the defendants to pay the non-economic damages separately to each plaintiff in proportion to their percentage of fault.
