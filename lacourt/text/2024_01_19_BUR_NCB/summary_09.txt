And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has reviewed the motion to confirm nonmonetary status filed by Quality Loan Service Corporation (QLS) and has denied the motion. The Court finds that QLS is not simply a trustee in a non-judicial foreclosure and is required to participate in the action. The Plaintiff, Robert D. Moore III, alleges that QLS and Bank of America, N.A. have not sent him a new Notice of Default or Notice of Trustee's Sale and seeks to prevent a pending foreclosure sale and obtain a new loan to pay the settlement amount. The Court has ordered QLS to provide notice of this order.
