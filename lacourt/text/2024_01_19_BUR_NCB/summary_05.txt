English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling on a motion to compel deposition of Dr. Marc Y. Waki, a defendant in a lawsuit filed by Mayra Aguayo, a former employee of Burbank Periodontics, Dental Implants & Laser Surgery. The lawsuit alleges harassment, discrimination, and battery by Dr. Waki and other defendants. The motion to compel deposition was filed after Dr. Waki failed to appear at a previously scheduled deposition date. The court grants the motion and orders the deposition to be set for January 24, 2024, but only if the parties can agree on that date. The court declines to award sanctions to the plaintiff, finding that the parties should have accommodated each other's schedules and that the plaintiff's counsel should have extended the courtesy of accommodating Dr. Waki's schedule.
