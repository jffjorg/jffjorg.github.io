And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has denied the Plaintiff's motion for trial preference, which was filed under CCP § 36(a). The Plaintiff, kathy hurley, is 77 years old and claims to have significant health problems due to the motor vehicle accident on November 3, 2022. However, the motion was not supported by any evidence, and the Judge concluded that the Plaintiff did not make a sufficient showing of her health problems. The Judge accepted that the Plaintiff is over 70 years old and has a substantial interest in the action, but denied the motion due to the lack of supporting evidence. The motion is denied without prejudice, and the Plaintiff shall provide notice of this order.
