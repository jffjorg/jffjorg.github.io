  Hearing Date:  January 19, 2024
 
 [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
motion for terminating sanctions 
 



 
BACKGROUND
A.   
Allegations
Plaintiff Andrius Kantas (“Plaintiff”)
allege that on November 22, 2020, he was operating a scooter owned by Defendant
Neutron Holdings, Inc. (“NHI”) and Defendant Lime.  Plaintiff alleges that he was injured as a
result of the failure of essential safety systems and poor maintenance of the scooter.  
The complaint, filed November 9, 2022,
alleges causes of action for: (1) negligence; (2) strict products liability –
design defect; (3) strict products liability – failure to warn; and (4) breach
of implied warranty of merchantability.
B.    
Motion on Calendar
On November 21, 2023, Defendant NHI dba
Lime (“Defendant”) filed a motion for terminating sanctions. 
The Court is not in receipt of an
opposition brief.  On January 11, 2024,
Defendant filed a notice of non-opposition stating that it did not receive an
opposition brief from Plaintiff.  
LEGAL
STANDARD
CCP § 2023.030 permits the Court to impose
terminating sanctions for discovery misuses, which are defined by CCP § 2023.010
to include the failure to respond to an authorized method of discovery and the
failure to comply with a Court discovery order. 

The Court weighs the following factors
when considering the present motion: (1) defendants’ conduct, indicating
whether their actions were willful; (2) the detriment to the party seeking
discovery; and (3) the number of formal and informal unsuccessful attempts to
obtain discovery.  (Lang v. Hochman (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 1225, 1246.)  Ultimate discovery sanctions are justified
where there is a willful discovery order violation, a history of abuse, and
evidence showing that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with
discovery rules.  (Van Sickle v. Gilbert (2011) 196 Cal.App.4th 1495, 1516.)
DISCUSSION

            Defendant moves for terminating
sanctions against Plaintiff for his failure to obey the Court’s October 13,
2023 order compelling Plaintiff to provide initial responses tp FROG, SROG, and
RPD and to attend his deposition.  
            The following background founds are
relevant to this motion.  On May 5, 2023,
the Court granted Plaintiff’s prior counsel’s motion to be relieved as
counsel.  On October 13, 2023, the Court
granted Defendant’s motions to compel initial responses and to compel Plaintiff
to attend his deposition.  The Court
ordered Plaintiff to provide initial responses within 20 days of notice of the
Court’s order and to schedule a deposition within 25 days of the order.  Defense counsel contacted the legal
coordinator of the prison where Plaintiff is located to inform him of the
results of the October 13, 2023 hearing, and mailed and emailed the notice of
entry of order to Plaintiff and the legal coordinator on October 16, 2023.  Defendant states that it confirmed with the
legal coordinator that Plaintiff’s deposition would go forward on November 2,
2023 and the legal coordinator logged onto the Zoom link on that date, but
Plaintiff chose not to participate in the deposition.  Defendant also argues that it is not in
receipt of any written discovery responses. 

            Based on Plaintiff’s failure to
comply with the Court’s order and lack of opposition to the motion, it appears
that Plaintiff has abandoned this case.  Furthermore,
Plaintiff was aware of his deposition but declined to attend though his legal
coordinator signed onto the Zoom deposition meeting.  In light of Plaintiff’s conduct, there is no
reason to believe that any lesser issue/evidentiary sanctions will force him to
comply with his discovery obligations. 
Accordingly, the motion for terminating sanctions is granted.  
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
Defendant Neutron Holdings,
Inc. dba Lime’s motion for terminating sanctions is granted.  The action will be dismissed with prejudice. 
Defendant shall provide
notice of this order.
