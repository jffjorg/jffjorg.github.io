And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is related to a lawsuit filed by John McGee, Marisol McGee, and Dylan McGee (minor) against Universal City Studios, LLC, alleging that they were subjected to a racist, offensive hand gesture by an employee of the defendant while they were at Universal Studios Hollywood in 2021. The defendants have filed a demurrer to the complaint, arguing that the allegations do not meet the legal requirements for the causes of action.

The Court has ruled that the demurrer is sustained as to the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd causes of action, which are for violation of the Unruh Civil Rights Act, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and negligence, respectively. The Court has given the plaintiffs 20 days to amend their complaint to include sufficient facts to support their claims.

The Court has also declined to take judicial notice of the Anti-Defamation League website, which the defendants had relied on to argue that the hand gesture was a common, harmless gesture. The Court has instead accepted the plaintiffs' allegations as true and has based its ruling on those allegations.
