```

And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The Court has granted Lyft's motion to compel arbitration of the Plaintiff's claims, which stem from a rideshare vehicle accident on August 3, 2021. The Court finds that the Plaintiff has not raised any arguments regarding the enforceability and scope of the arbitration clause, and that the arbitration clause is sufficiently broad to cover the claims in this action. As a result, the Plaintiff's claims against Lyft will proceed to arbitration, and the remainder of the claims alleged against the Lyft driver, Juan L. Estrada, will be stayed pending the outcome of the arbitration.
