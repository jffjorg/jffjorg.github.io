Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Defendant Keino Rutherford, M.D.'s motion for judgment on the pleadings as to the 2nd cause of action for elder abuse, finding that the allegations in the Third Amended Complaint (TAC) are sufficient to plead a claim for elder abuse against Dr. Rutherford. The judge has granted the motion for judgment on the pleadings as to the 3rd cause of action for violation of patient's rights, finding that the allegations in the TAC do not state a viable cause of action against Dr. Rutherford.

The judge has denied the motion to strike the allegations for punitive damages and attorney's fees, finding that the allegations in the TAC are sufficient to support a claim for punitive damages against Dr. Rutherford. The judge has granted the motion to strike the allegations in connection with the 3rd cause of action, as the 3rd cause of action is not directed against Dr. Rutherford.

The judge has ordered Dr. Rutherford to answer the complaint, and has directed that notice of the order be given to all parties.
