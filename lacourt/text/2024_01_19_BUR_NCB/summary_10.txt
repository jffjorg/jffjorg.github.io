And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motions to compel further responses filed by defendant Dillon Roane A Joint Venture, Inc. The motions were filed to compel plaintiff Unite Welding Enterprises, Inc. to provide further responses to special interrogatories and requests for production of documents.

The judge found that defendant's motion to compel further responses to request for production of documents (RPD) No. 4 is moot in light of plaintiff's amended responses. However, the judge granted defendant's motion as to RPD No. 7, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 33, 36, and 45, and SROG Nos. 4, 5, 11, 15, 19, 23, 32, and 44, because plaintiff's responses were insufficient.

The judge also granted defendant's motion to compel further responses as to special interrogatories (SROG) Nos. 7, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 33, 36, and 45, and SROG Nos. 4, 5, 11, 15, 19, 23, 32, and 44, because plaintiff's responses were vague and failed to provide sufficient detail.

The judge ordered plaintiff to provide further responses within 20 days of notice of this order. The judge also awarded sanctions to defendant in the amount of $2,061.65.

The judge noted that plaintiff's amended responses were served after defendant filed the motion to compel, and that defendant's motion to compel further responses is granted as to SROG Nos. 2, 38, 40, and 42 is moot in light of plaintiff's amended responses.
