Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the motion for leave to file a First Amended Cross-Complaint (FAXC) is granted. The FAXC is to be filed by the defendant/cross-complainant Frank Uchalik Jr. (Uchalik Jr.) in response to alleged misconduct by Uchalik Sr., the father of Uchalik Jr. and the former president of Alpha Medical Resources, Inc. (Alpha).

The judge noted that Uchalik Jr. has alleged that Uchalik Sr. engaged in misconduct, including withholding Uchalik Jr.'s duly owed distributions from certain Alpha entities, failing to provide him with notice of the Alpha entities' failure to pay rental, loan, and other business obligations, and causing nonparties FRF Properties, LLC and JDU Properties, LLC to make payments to Cross-Defendants' counsel in this action.

The judge also noted that there are multiple forums involved in this case, including the California Superior Court, the New York Supreme Court, and the Fulton County Superior Court in Georgia. The judge concluded that it is prudent to allow Uchalik Jr. to plead his claims fully in this action, which has a trial date of June 17, 2024, rather than in the other forums.

The judge also rejected arguments by Alpha and Uchalik Sr. that the motion should be denied because the New York and Georgia Actions were filed prior to the California action, and that Uchalik Jr. is attempting to forum shop. The judge noted that the parties have chosen to litigate in multiple forums, and that it is not clear how Alpha and Uchalik Sr. would be prejudiced by allowing amendment in this action.
