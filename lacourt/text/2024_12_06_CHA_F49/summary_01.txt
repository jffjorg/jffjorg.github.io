Here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by a Judge regarding a Motion to Vacate filed by Defendant Charles M. Johnson. The Motion seeks to vacate the Court's January 19, 2024, Order awarding $8,300.00 in attorney fees and costs to Plaintiff's counsel. The Defendant's attorney, Dominic Trutanich, declares that the failure to notify him of the existence of the Plaintiff's Motion for Sanctions and the failure to calendar the hearing of that Motion resulted in the Defendant's attorneys failing to file an opposition or appear at the hearing, ultimately leading to the granting of the Plaintiff's Motion for Sanctions.

The Judge finds that the Motion is untimely, as it was filed after the statutory deadline of July 19, 2024. Additionally, the Judge finds that the mandatory relief provisions of Code of Civil Procedure section 473 subdivision (b) are inapplicable to the Court's January 19, 2024, Order, as it does not constitute a "default, default judgment, or dismissal" under the plain language of the statute. Therefore, the Motion is DENIED.
