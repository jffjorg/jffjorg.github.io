Summary text:

The judge has granted summary judgment to AutoNation Ford Valencia on the sixth cause of action, which is the negligent repair claim. The judge concludes that Plaintiffs have failed to establish a prima facie case as they have not identified any statute or regulation imposing a duty on AutoNation Ford Valencia to repair the vehicle with due care. The judge also finds that the Economic Loss Rule applies to the claim, as Plaintiffs only seek damages for the cost to repair the vehicle and have not alleged any personal injury or physical damage. The judge notes that Plaintiffs have failed to oppose the motion and therefore have waived any response to the arguments presented.
