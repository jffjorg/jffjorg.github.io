BACKGROUND
 
This is an unlawful detainer action.
 
On April 25, 2022, Plaintiff Dunn
Investment Properties, Inc. (“Plaintiff” or “Dunn Investment”) filed this action against
Defendants Charles M. Johnson and Sheila S. Johnson (collectively,
“Defendants”), and Does 1 to 25, for unlawful detainer at 24773 Avenue
Rockefeller, Santa Clarita, CA 91355 (the “Premises”). Subsequently, on January
26, 2023, Plaintiff filed its operative Third Amended Complaint (“TAC”).
 
On March 8, 2023, Plaintiff requested a default entered
against Defendant Sheila S. Johnson (“Sheila”) and all unknown occupants, which
was subsequently entered by the Clerk on the same day.
 
On May 30, 2023, the Court granted Plaintiff’s motion for
summary adjudication, confirming Plaintiff’s right to possession of the
Premises. (5/30/23 Minute Order.) 
On August 8, 2023, the Court denied Defendants’ motion for reconsideration.
(8/8/23 Minute Order.) Subsequently, on January 19, 2024, the Court granted
Plaintiff’s motion for sanctions, awarding $8,300.00 in attorney fees and costs
to Plaintiff’s counsel (the “Order”). (1/19/24 Minute Order.)
 
On July 23, 2024, Defendant Charles M. Johnson (“Charles”
or the “Moving Defendant”) filed the instant Motion to Vacate the January 19,
2024, Order. Subsequently, Plaintiff filed its Opposition on November 22, 2024.

 
No Reply papers have been received by the Court.
 
ANALYSIS
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 473
subdivision (b) provides, in pertinent part, that:
 
“The court may, upon any terms as may be just, relieve
a party or his or her legal representative from a judgment, dismissal, order,
or other proceeding taken against him or her through his or her mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. Application for this relief shall
be accompanied by a copy of the answer or other pleading proposed to be filed
therein, otherwise the application shall not be granted, and shall be made
within a reasonable time, in no case exceeding six months, after the judgment,
dismissal, order, or proceeding was taken .... No affidavit or declaration of
merits shall be required of the moving party. Notwithstanding any other
requirements of this section, the court shall, whenever an application for
relief is made no more than six months after entry of judgment, is in proper
form, and is accompanied by an attorney's sworn affidavit attesting to his or
her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect, vacate any (1) resulting
default entered by the clerk against his or her client, and which will result
in entry of a default judgment, or (2) resulting default judgment or dismissal
entered against his or her client, unless the court finds that the default or
dismissal was not in fact caused by the attorney's mistake, inadvertence,
surprise, or neglect. The court shall, whenever relief is granted based on an
attorney's affidavit of fault, direct the attorney to pay reasonable
compensatory legal fees and costs to opposing counsel or parties. However, this
section shall not lengthen the time within which an action shall be brought to
trial pursuant to Section 583.310.”
 
A.   
Motion to Vacate
 
Moving Defendant brings this Motion under the mandatory
relief provisions of California Code of Civil Procedure section 473,
subdivision (b). (Mot. at pp. 3 and 4.)
 
Moving Defendant’s counsel, Dominic Trutanich (“Trutanich”), declares,
“Between
February of 2001 through November 7, 2023, Bonita E. Banes (“Bonni”)
Defendants’ Attorney of Record’s Office Manager and Paralegal, was the sole
person responsible for opening the law firm’s daily mail, looking at the law
firm’s daily emails, directing all correspondence to the appropriate attorney
and calendaring all upcoming court appearances.” (Trutanich Decl. ¶ 3.) “It did
not come to my attention until on or about November 7, 2023 that Bonni Banes
had been suffering from brain disease for several months. . . . Initially it
looked like Bonni would recover from her brain cancer but unfortunately she
succumbed to her disease on June 4, 2024. Trutanich and Associates has really
struggled to find her replacement.” (Ibid.) “As a direct result of
Bonita Banes’ failure to notify any of the Attorneys of Trutanich and
Associates of the existence of Plaintiff, Dunn Investment Properties, Inc.’s
Motion for Sanctions and her failure to calendar the hearing of that Motion on
January 19, 2024, Defendants’ Attorneys of Record failed to file any opposition
to or appear at the hearing on Plaintiff’s Motion. Without a filed opposition
or appearance against Plaintiff’s motion for sanctions, the Court granted
Plaintiff’s Motion for Sanctions.” (Trutanich Decl. ¶ 4.)
 
Plaintiff opposes the Motion on the grounds that it is
untimely and that the mandatory relief provisions under Code of Civil Procedure
section 473 subdivision (b) are inapplicable to the Court’s January 19, 2024,
Order.
 
1)      Timeliness
 
“[T]he six-month limitations period of the mandatory and discretionary relief
provisions of section 473(b) is either 182 days or six calendar months,
whichever period is longer.” (Jimenez v. Chavez (2023) 97 Cal.App.5th
50, 53, see Code Civ. Proc., § 473.)
 
Here, the Court’s Order was entered on January 19, 2024, establishing
the deadline of July 19, 2024, to file the Motion to Vacate under Code of Civil
Procedure section 473, subdivision (b). The Moving Defendant filed the Motion
on July 23, 2024, exceeding the statutory deadline.
 
Accordingly, the Court finds the Motion untimely and DENIES the Motion
on this basis.
 
2)      Applicability of the Mandatory Relief
Provisions
 
The pertinent
text of subdivision (b) of Code of Civil Procedure section 473 provides:
 
“[T]he court shall ... vacate any (1) resulting default entered by the clerk against his or her client,
and which will result in entry of a default judgment, or (2) resulting default judgment or dismissal entered
against his or her client, unless the court finds that the default or dismissal was not in
fact caused by the attorney's mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect.”
(Underlines added.)
 
In The Urban Wildlands Group, Inc. v. City of Los Angeles (2017)
10 Cal.App.5th 993 (Urban), the Court of Appeal ruled this statute means
what it says and says what it means, which resolves the issue: the statute
covers only defaults, default judgments, and dismissals. The Urban case acknowledged and disagreed with earlier and
contrary authority, which had expanded the reach of the statute to situations
“analogous” to defaults, default judgments, and dismissals. Urban rejected these extensions of the statute as
contrary to its plain language. (Urban, supra, at pp. 998–1001.)
            
Similarly, in Shayan v. Spine Care &
Orthopedic Physicians (2020) 44 Cal.App.5th 167 (Shayan), the Shayan
court agreed with Urban ruling, stating that “[t]he plain language of
the statute is unambiguous and controlling. It would be a disservice to
embroider this language with freeform extensions to “analogous” situations.” (Id.
at p. 170.)
 
            Here, the Court’s January 19, 2024,
Order granted sanctions for attorney fees and costs in favor of Plaintiff. This
Order does not constitute a “default, default judgment, or dismissal” under the
plain language of Code of Civil Procedure section 473 subdivision (b). Consequently,
the mandatory relief provisions are inapplicable to the Court’s January 19,
2024, Order. 
 
            Accordingly, the Court DENIES the
Motion on this alternative ground. 
 
CONCLUSION
 
Defendant Charles M. Johnson’s Motion to Vacate is DENIED.
