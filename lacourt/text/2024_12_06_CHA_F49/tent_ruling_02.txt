REQUESTED: An
order granting Defendant AutoNation Ford Valencia’s
Motion for Summary Judgment on the Negligent Repair Causes of Action in Plaintiffs’
First Amended Complaint.
 
TENTATIVE
RULING: The
motion is GRANTED.
 
BACKGROUND
 
Plaintiffs Taylor Peacock (“Peacock”) and Austin Smith
(“Smith”) (collectively “Plaintiffs”) initiated this action under Song-Beverly
Consumer Warranty Act (Lemon Law), Consumer Legal Remedies Act, and
Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act over alleged defects in their 2020 Ford Expedition
(the “Subject Vehicle”), which was manufactured by Defendant Ford Motor Company
(“FMC”). Plaintiffs allege that they entered into a warranty contract with
Defendant FMC on or about December 19, 2020.
 
On January 31, 2023, Plaintiffs initiated this action.
Subsequently, on May 26, 2023, the Department F47 Court sustained a demurrer
filed by Defendant FMC on April 10, 2023.
 
On June 23, 2023, Plaintiffs filed their First Amended
Complaint (“FAC”) against Defendants FMC and AutoNation Ford Valencia
(“AutoNation Ford”), and Does 1 through 10, alleging the following causes of
action: (1) Violation of Subdivision (d) of Civil Code Section 1793.2, (2) Violation of Subdivision (b) of Civil Code Section
1793.2, (3) Violation of Subdivision (a)(3) of Civil Code Section 1793.2, (4)
Breach of Implied Warranty of Merchantability (Civ. Code §§ 1791.1, 1794,
1795.5), (5) Fraudulent Inducement – Concealment, (6) Negligent Repair, (7)
Violation of Consumer Legal Remedies Act (Civ. Code § 1750 et seq.), and (8)
Violation of the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act. The First through Fifth, and
Seventh through Eighth Causes of Action are alleged against Defendant FMC. The
Sixth Cause of Action is alleged against AutoNation Ford. On December 5, 2023,
the Department F47 Court sustained FMC’s demurrer to the Third and Fifth Causes
of Action without leave to amend.
 
On August 29, 2024, Defendant FMC
filed a motion for summary adjudication on the First, Fourth, and Seventh
Causes of Action in the FAC, which the Court granted on December 3, 2024. 
 
            On the
same day, August 29, 2024, Defendant AutoNation Ford filed the instant Motion
for Summary Judgment on the Sixth Cause of Action for Negligent Repair.
Subsequently, on November 26, 2024, AutoNation Ford submitted a Notice of
Non-Opposition. 
 
No Reply papers have been
received by the Court.   
 
ANALYSIS
 
In reviewing a motion for summary
judgment, courts must apply a three-step analysis: “(1) identify the issues
framed by the pleadings; (2) determine whether the moving party has negated the
opponent’s claims; and (3) determine whether the opposition has demonstrated
the existence of a triable, material factual issue.”  (Hinesley v.
Oakshade Town Center (2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 289, 294.)
 
“A party may move for summary judgment in an action or
proceeding if it is contended that the action has no merit or that there is no
defense to the action or proceeding.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (a)(1).)
 
“The motion for summary judgment shall be granted if all the
papers submitted show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact
and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. In
determining if the papers show that there is no triable issue as to any
material fact, the court shall consider all of the evidence set forth in the
papers, except the evidence to which objections have been made and sustained by
the court, and all inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence, except
summary judgment shall not be granted by the court based on inferences
reasonably deducible from the evidence if contradicted by other inferences or
evidence that raise a triable issue as to any material fact.” (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 437c, subd. (c).) 
 
“[I]f the moving papers establish a prima facie
showing that justifies a [ruling] in the [moving party’s] favor, the burden
then shifts to the [opposing party] to make a prima facie showing of the
existence of a triable material factual issue.’ [Citation.]" (See's
Candy Shops, Inc. v. Superior Court (2012) 210 Cal.App.4th 889, 900,
quoting Rehmani v. Superior Court (2012) 204 Cal.App.4th 945,
950.) “The defendant or cross-defendant shall not rely upon the allegations or
denials of its pleadings to show that a triable issue of material fact exists
but, instead, shall set forth the specific facts showing that a triable issue
of material fact exists as to the cause of action or a defense thereto.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(1).) 
 
A.   
Sixth Cause
of Action: Negligent Repair
 
The Sixth
Cause of Action for Negligent Repair is based on a negligence theory, which
requires the same elements of a negligence cause of action – the existence of a
legal duty of care, a breach of that duty, and proximate causation resulting in
injury. (McIntyre v. The Colonies-Pacific, LLC (2014) 228 Cal.App.4th
664, 671.)
 
A negligence
claim must be based on a duty owed by the defendant to the plaintiff. Absent
such a duty, there is no liability, no matter how easily the injury might have
been prevented. (J.L. v. Children’s Institute, Inc. (2009) 177
Cal.App.4th 388, 396; Bily v. Arthur Young & Co. (1992) 3 Cal.4th
370, 397 [threshold element is existence of duty to use due care toward another].)
 
Plaintiffs have not identified any
statute or regulation imposing a duty on AutoNation Ford to repair the Subject
Vehicle with due care. Without a statutory duty, Plaintiffs ground their
negligence claim on a common law duty. 
 
1)     
AutoNation
Ford’s Initial Burden  
 
Here, AutoNation Ford contends that
Plaintiffs cannot establish one or more essential elements of their claim,
arguing that even assuming that Plaintiffs could prove such allegations,
Plaintiffs’ claim is barred by the economic loss rule.
 
i.                   
Economic Loss Rule
 
The Economic Loss Rule can be
stated as follows: “in general, there is no recovery in tort for negligently
inflicted ‘purely economic losses,’ meaning financial harm unaccompanied by
physical or property damage.” (Sheen v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (2022) 12
Cal.5th 905, 922, citing Southern California Gas Leak Cases (2019) 7
Cal.5th 391.)
 
Courts have established that
"conduct amounting to a breach of contract becomes tortious only when it
also violates a duty independent of the contract arising from principles of
tort law." (Erlich v. Menezes (1999) 21 Cal.4th 543, 551; see also Freeman
& Mills, Inc. v. Belcher Oil Co. (1995) 11 Cal.4th 85, 102). Tort
damages have been allowed in contract cases where a breach of duty directly
causes physical injury; for breaches of the covenant of good faith and fair
dealing in insurance contracts; for wrongful discharge in violation of
fundamental public policy; or where the contract was fraudulently induced. In
these cases, the duty giving rise to tort liability is either completely
independent of the contract or arises from conduct both intentional and intended
to harm (Erlich v. Menezes, supra, at pp. 551–552; Butler-Rupp
v. Lourdeaux (2005) 134 Cal.App.4th 1220, 1227).
 
Here, the FAC alleges that
Plaintiffs delivered the Subject Vehicle to Defendant AutoNation Ford for
substantial repair on at least one occasion. (FAC ¶ 78.) It is undisputed that the repair services
performed by AutoNation Ford were performed under a contractual relationship
between the parties. (Undisputed Material Fact (“UMF”) No. 6.). Additionally,
there are no allegations of fraud or other intentional tort claims independent
of the breach of contract cause of action. (UMF No. 3.) Therefore, this repair service,
whether under warranty or not, establishes the parties in contractual privity,
thereby implicating the Economic Loss Rule.
 
Moreover, it is undisputed that
Plaintiffs did not seek any personal injury damages and only seek damages for
the cost to repair the Subject Vehicle. (UMF Nos. 4-5). Based on these facts, AutoNation
Ford correctly asserts that the Negligent Repair claim is barred by the
Economic Loss Rule, as Plaintiffs only claim economic loss damages and cannot
prove that AutoNation Ford owed them an independent duty in tort.
 
Accordingly, the Court concludes
that AutoNation Ford has demonstrated a prima facie case that there is no
triable issue of material fact and that it is entitled to judgment as a matter
of law. The burden now shifts to the Plaintiffs.
            
2)     
Plaintiffs’
Burden of Showing Existence of a Triable Material Factual Issue
      
No Opposition papers have been filed with the Court. Plaintiffs’ failure
to oppose the Motion constitutes a waiver of any response to the arguments presented
therein. In the absence of contrary evidence, the Court concludes that
Plaintiffs have failed to meet their burden of making a prima facie
showing of the existence of a triable material factual issue.
 
Accordingly, the Court GRANTS the Motion.
 

CONCLUSION
 
Defendant AutoNation Ford Valencia’s Motion for Summary Judgment on the
Sixth Cause of Action in Plaintiffs’ First Amended Complaint is GRANTED.
