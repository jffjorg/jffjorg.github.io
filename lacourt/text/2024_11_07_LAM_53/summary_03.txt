And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling denies the defendant's motions to compel responses to interrogatories, deem admitted requests for admission, and compel responses to requests for production of documents, and to reopen discovery. The court has considered the age of the case, the number of trial continuances, and the current trial date when making its decision. The discovery motion cutoff date has passed, and the defendant has not shown sufficient cause to justify reopening discovery. The court agrees with the plaintiff that the discovery motion cutoff date has passed, and that the defendant has not demonstrated a valid reason for reopening discovery. The court exercises its discretion to deny the defendant's requests and orders the plaintiff to give notice of this ruling.
