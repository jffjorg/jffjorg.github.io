MOVING PARTY:                Defendant Los Angeles Unified
School District
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Plaintiff Eric Jones
Motion for Summary Judgment or, in the Alternative, Summary
Adjudication
The court
considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers filed in connection with
this motion. 
EVIDENTIARY OBJECTIONS  
The court does not rule on plaintiff Eric Jones’s amended evidentiary
objections, filed on October 30, 2024, because they are directed to evidence
that is not material to the court’s disposition of this motion.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (q).) 
LEGAL STANDARD
The purpose of a motion for summary judgment or summary
adjudication “is to provide courts with a mechanism to cut through the parties’
pleadings in order to determine whether, despite their allegations, trial is in
fact necessary to resolve their dispute.” 
(Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co.
(2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.)  “Code
of Civil Procedure section 437c, subdivision (c), requires the trial judge to
grant summary judgment if all the evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences
reasonably deducible from the evidence’ and uncontradicted by other inferences
or evidence, show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and
that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.”  (Adler
v. Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.)
“On a motion for summary judgment, the initial burden is always on
the moving party to make a prima facie showing that there are no triable issues
of material fact.”  (Scalf v. D.B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1510,
1519.)  A defendant or cross-defendant
moving for summary judgment or summary adjudication “has met his or her burden
of showing that a cause of action has no merit if the party has shown that one
or more elements of the cause of action . . . cannot be established, or that
there is a complete defense to the cause of action.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 437c, subd. (p)(2).)  “Once the
defendant or cross-defendant has met that burden, the burden shifts to the
plaintiff or cross-complainant to show that a triable issue of one or more
material facts exists as to the cause of action or a defense thereto.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2).)  “If the plaintiff cannot do so, summary
judgment should be granted.”  (Avivi v. Centro
Medico Urgente Medical Center (2008) 159 Cal.App.4th 463, 467.)  “When deciding whether to grant summary
judgment, the court must consider all of the evidence set forth in the papers
(except evidence to which the court has sustained an objection), as well as all
reasonable inferences that may be drawn from that evidence, in the light most
favorable to the party opposing summary judgment.”  (Id. at
p. 467; Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (c).)
DISCUSSION

Defendant Los Angeles Unified School District (“Defendant”) filed
the pending motion on June 17, 2024, moving the court for an order granting
summary judgment or, alternatively, summary adjudication, in its favor and
against plaintiff Eric Jones (“Plaintiff”). 
The court finds that Defendant has not met its burden to show that
each cause of action alleged by Plaintiff has no merit because Defendant’s
memorandum of points and authorities does not set forth the evidence on which
Defendant relies.  
“The memorandum [of points and authorities] must contain a
statement of facts, a concise statement of the law, evidence and
arguments relied on, and a discussion of the statutes, cases, and
textbooks cited in support of the position advanced.”  (Cal. Rules of Ct., rule 3.1113, subd. (b)
[emphasis added].)  Further, “[a]ll
references to exhibits or declarations in supporting or opposing papers must
reference the number or letter of the exhibit, the specific page, and, if
applicable, the paragraph or line number.” 
(Cal. Rules of Ct., rule 3.1113, subd. (k).)  Here, Defendant’s supporting memorandum of
points and authorities does not set forth the evidence on which Defendant
relies as required.  Instead, Defendant
appears to have inadvertently submitted an incomplete version of the motion
that includes only incomplete citations to its separate statement.  (Memo., pp. 7:12, 7:16, 8:6, 8:26, 9:3, 0:15,
9:25, 10:3, 10:9, 10:13, 10:18, 10:22, 10:23, 11:2, 11:17, 11:24, 12:4, 12:9,
12:16, 12:20, 12:25, 13:4, 13:11, 13:16, 20:3, 20:26, 21:4, 22:12, 23:3.)  
The court finds that Defendant’s failure to cite to the evidence
(including as set forth in the separate statement) is prejudicial and has
deprived the court, and Plaintiff, of the ability to determine whether
Defendant has produced evidence to show that Plaintiff cannot establish
essential elements of each cause of action. 
(Opp., p. 1:2-9 [asserting that Defendant’s moving papers are defective
and therefore prejudicial].)  For
example, Defendant contends that Plaintiff’s determination of Plaintiff’s “benefit-ending-date”
lacked animus because the employee who facilitated that function had no
knowledge of Plaintiff’s alleged protected characteristics.  (Mot., pp. 12:21-13:4.)  But because Defendant has not cited evidence
in support of its motion, the court and Plaintiff cannot determine whether
Defendant has submitted competent evidence to support this argument.  Moreover, Defendant’s compendium of evidence consists
of over 400 pages of evidence, and the court is not required to search the
record to identify the evidence in support of Defendant’s contentions.  (Quantum Cooking Concepts, Inc. v. LV
Associates, Inc. (2011) 197 Cal.App.4th 927, 933 [noting that the
memorandum had no statement of the facts and “no identification of the specific
evidence or arguments on which their challenges to the sufficiency of the
evidence rely”], 934 [“In the face of these omissions, the trial court had no
obligation to undertake its own search of the record ‘backwards and forwards to
try to figure out how the law applies to the facts’ of the case”].) 
Finally, although the court acknowledges that Defendant filed a “Notice
of Errata re: Defendant Los Angeles Unified School District’s Memorandum of
Points & Authorities in Support of Its Motion for Summary Judgment or
Alternatively Summary Adjudication” on October 29, 2024, which includes correct
and complete citations to the record, Defendant served that memorandum on
Plaintiff on October 29, 2024, and therefore did not provide Plaintiff with
75-days’ notice of the moving papers as required.  (Oct. 29, 2024 Notice of Errata, p. 30 [proof
of electronic service on October 29, 2024]; Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (a)(2)
[“Notice of the motion and supporting papers shall be served on all other
parties to the action at least 75 days before the time appointed for
hearing”].) 
Thus, for the reasons set forth above, the court finds that
Defendant’s memorandum of points and authorities is procedurally defective and
therefore insufficient to establish that Defendant has met its burden to show
that each cause of action has no merit.  
The court therefore denies Defendant’s motion for summary judgment
or, in the alternative, summary adjudication. 
ORDER
            The court denies defendant Los
Angeles Unified School District’s motion for summary judgment or, in the
alternative, summary adjudication. 
The court orders plaintiff Eric Jones  to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
