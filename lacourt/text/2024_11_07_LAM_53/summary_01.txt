And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion for summary judgment or, in the alternative, summary adjudication. The defendant, Los Angeles Unified School District, had argued that each cause of action alleged by the plaintiff, Eric Jones, had no merit. However, the judge found that the defendant's failure to cite evidence in support of its motion was procedurally defective and therefore insufficient to establish that each cause of action had no merit. The judge also found that the defendant's failure to provide the plaintiff with 75-days' notice of the moving papers was prejudicial and had deprived the court and the plaintiff of the ability to determine whether the defendant had produced evidence to show that the plaintiff could not establish essential elements of each cause of action. As a result, the court denied the defendant's motion and ordered the plaintiff to give notice of this ruling.
