Case    No.:   23STCV30834               Hearing    Date:   November     7, 2024               Time:          10:00 a.m.                 Order    RE:   (1)      demurrer    to first amended complaint (2)      motionto    strike first amended complaint        MOVING PARTY:                 Defendant Intersolutions, LLC              RESPONDING PARTY:       Plaintiff Martin Ramirez (1)    Demurrer  to First Amended Complaint  (2)    Motion  to Strike First Amended Complaint Plaintiff Martin Ramirez (“Plaintiff”) filed the operative First  Amended Complaint in this action on June 20, 2024, against defendants  California Landmark Group, R3 Lofts LLC, CLG Management, LLC, Intersolutions,  LLC, NPM Staffing, LLC, and Lemonade Insurance Company.  The court notes that there are four sets of responsive pleadings that  are directed to Plaintiff’s First Amended Complaint.  First, on July 10, 2024, defendant Intersolutions, LLC filed a demurrer  and motion to strike directed to Plaintiff’s First Amended Complaint, which is set  for hearing on November 7, 2024.  (Def. Intersolutions’  Dem., p. 1:21-25; Def. Intersolutions’ Mot. to Strike, pp. 1:22-2:2.)  Second, on July 26, 2024, defendant Lemonade Insurance Company filed a  demurrer directed to Plaintiff’s First Amended Complaint, which is set for  hearing on December 17, 2024.  (Def.  Lemonade’s Dem., pp. 1:26-2:3.)  Third, on August 14, 2024, defendants California Landmark Group, Inc.,  R3 Lofts LLC, and CLG Management LLC filed a motion for judgment on the  pleadings directed to Plaintiff’s First Amended Complaint, which is set for  hearing on December 24, 2024.  (Defs.  Mot. for Judgment on the Pleadings, p. 2:1-9.)  Fourth, on September 10, 2024, defendant NPM Staffing, LLC filed a  demurrer and motion to strike directed to Plaintiff’s First Amended Complaint,  which is set for hearing on January 14, 2025.  (Def. NPM’s Dem., p. 1:24-27; Def. NPM’s Mot.  to Strike, pp. 1:24-2:6.)              The court finds that it is in the  interest of judicial efficiency and economy to hear the pending demurrers,  motions to strike, and motion for judgment on the pleadings on the same date,  so that (1) the court may evaluate all challenges to Plaintiff’s First Amended  Complaint at once, and (2) in the event that the court sustains any demurrer  and grants Plaintiff leave to amend, any remaining demurrers or motions to  strike or for judgment on the pleadings will not be rendered moot.  The court therefore finds that it is  appropriate, and exercises its discretion, to reschedule the hearing dates on  the demurrers, motions to strike, and the motion for judgment on the pleadings so  that they may be heard on one date.  ORDER             The court orders that the hearing on  defendant Intersolutions, LLC’s demurrer and motion to strike is continued from  November 7, 2024 to January 22, 2025, at 10:00 a.m., in Department 53.              The court orders that the hearing on  defendant Lemonade Insurance Company’s demurrer is continued from December 17,  2024 to January 22, 2025, at 10:00 a.m., in Department 53.             The court orders that the hearing on  defendants California Landmark Group, Inc., R3 Lofts LLC, and CLG Management  LLC’s motion for judgment on the pleadings is continued from December 24, 2024  to January 22, 2025, at 10:00 a.m., in Department 53.              The court orders that the hearing on  defendant NPM Staffing, LLC’s demurrer and motion to strike is continued from  January 14, 2025 to, to January 22, 2025, at 10:00 a.m., in Department 53.             The court directs the clerk to give  notice of this ruling. IT IS SO ORDERED.   DATED:  November 6, 2024   _____________________________ Robert  B. Broadbelt III Judge  of the Superior CourtRamirez v. California Landmark

minute
order 11/7/24

plaintiff’s
ex parte application

The
court denies plaintiff’s request that the court issue an Order to Show Cause
why defendant InterSolutions, LLC and its attorneys should not be held in
contempt because the declaration submitted in support of the ex parte application
does not state a cause of action for contempt. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1211, subd. (a) [“When the contempt is not committed
in the immediate view and presence of the court, or of the judge at chambers,
an affidavit shall be presented to the court or judge of the facts constituting
the contempt.”].)

“As a
general rule, the elements of contempt include (1) a valid order, (2) knowledge
of the order, (3) ability to comply with the order, and (4) willful failure to
comply with the order.”  (In re Ivey (2000) 85 Cal.App.4th
793, 798.)

First,
to the extent plaintiff requests that the court issue an Order to Show Cause re
contempt for violation of the March 14, 2023 order issued in another case
(21SMCV01968), this case (23STCV30834) is not the proper case in which to seek such
relief.     

Second,
to the extent the declaration alleges that the citees have disobeyed this
court’s October 8, 2024 minute order, the language cited by plaintiff in that
minute order does not constitute an order.

Third,
the declaration does not allege that the citees had knowledge of the order.

Third,
the declaration does not allege that the citees had the ability to comply with
the order.

Fourth,
the declaration does not allege facts that establish the citees willfully
failed to comply with the order.  

The
court also denies plaintiff’s request that the court issue terminating
sanctions under Code of Civil Procedure section 128.7 against defendant
InterSolutions, LLC and monetary sanctions against its attorneys because the
court finds that plaintiff has not satisfied the requirement of California Rules of Court, rule 3.1202, subdivision (c),
that an applicant for an ex parte order must make an affirmative factual
showing in a declaration containing competent testimony based on personal
knowledge of irreparable harm, immediate danger, or other statutory basis for
granting relief ex parte.  

The
court therefore denies plaintiff’s ex parte application.

The court
orders plaintiff to give notice of this order.
