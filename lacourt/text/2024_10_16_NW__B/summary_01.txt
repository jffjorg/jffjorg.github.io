```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendants' motion to quash the plaintiff's Doe amendment, which added Breadbox Co. as a defendant to the action. The defendants had argued that Breadbox Co. did not exist at the time of the underlying incident and that the plaintiff unreasonably delayed filing the amendment, causing prejudice to the defendants. However, the judge found that the defendants did not have standing to bring the motion, as only the named Doe defendant can challenge the amendment. The judge also found that the plaintiff had a reasonable excuse for the delay in filing the amendment and that the defendants had not shown prejudice from the delay.

The case will proceed with a non-jury trial scheduled for December 10, 2024.
