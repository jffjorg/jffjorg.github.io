And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion of defendant Ida Bernice Stewart-Donaldson to compel an independent medical examination (IME) of plaintiff Antonias Romero. The defendant sought the IME to determine the extent and validity of the plaintiff's alleged injuries, which the defendant claims are ongoing and significant. However, the judge found that the defendant failed to show good cause for the motion, as the defendant already conducted a first IME on the plaintiff and the additional IMEs sought were unreasonably cumulative and duplicative. The judge also noted that the defendant's motion was filed on the eve of trial and was likely done to harass and burden the plaintiff. As a result, the judge denied the motion and did not award sanctions to the plaintiff, as the plaintiff's counsel failed to provide supporting facts for the amount of sanctions sought.
