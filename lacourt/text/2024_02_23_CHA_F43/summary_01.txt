The judge has granted Restoration Master, Inc.'s motion to compel a site inspection and non-destructive testing of the residential property in question, but limited the inspection to testing for mold and smoke only. The judge has denied Restoration Master, Inc.'s request for sanctions against David Alfred Amihere, citing Amihere's previous experiences with inspections and the harassment he faced from his contractor as substantial justification for his opposition to the site inspection.
