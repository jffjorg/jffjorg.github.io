And here is the English-text summary:

The court is considering a demurrer filed by Defendant Provident Title Company to the first amended complaint. The court has reviewed the pleadings and finds that Defendant Provident Title Company's demurrer is sustained with leave to amend as to the first, second, and sixth causes of action. The court's decision is based on the following grounds: (1) the first cause of action for breach of contract fails because Plaintiffs fail to allege any contract between themselves and Defendant Provident Title Company; (2) the second cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty fails because Plaintiffs fail to allege facts giving rise to a fiduciary duty; and (3) the sixth cause of action for tort of another fails as a matter of law because Plaintiffs cannot recover attorney's fees and costs under this doctrine. The court is allowing Plaintiffs an opportunity to amend their complaint to cure the defects discussed in this order.
