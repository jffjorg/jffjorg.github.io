 Case Number:  22STCV17709    Hearing Date:   October 24, 2023    Dept:  26 10/24/23
The Court is inclined to grant the parties' stipulation to hold the current discovery and motion cut-off dates while continuing the trial.  However, the Court is dark from March 18, 2024 through March 29, 2024.  While awaiting the case to be called on October 24, 2023, the parties are to meet and confer regarding an alternative trial date.  Once the parties have agreed upon two alternative trial dates, they may call the Court Clerk to let the Court know that the parties are ready for the case to be called.
