And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motions to compel responses to requests for production filed by the plaintiff, The People of the State of California, against defendants Metro Investments Group, Inc. and Anthony Nowaid. The plaintiff is seeking to compel the defendants to respond to the requests for production, which were served on February 23, 2024, and March 15, 2024, respectively. The Judge has found that the defendants failed to respond to the requests, which waives any objection to the requests.

The Judge has granted the motions to compel responses and ordered the defendants to serve verified responses without objections to the requests for production within 20 days. The Judge has also ordered the defendants and their counsel, Mainak D'Attaray, to pay sanctions to the plaintiff in the amount of $1,050 for Metro and $625 for Nowaid.

The Judge has exercised discretion not to consider any untimely opposition to the motions and has found that the defendants did not act with substantial justification in failing to respond to the requests. The Judge has concluded that sanctions are just under the circumstances and has awarded sanctions to the plaintiff.
