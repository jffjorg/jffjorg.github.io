 Case Number:  23STCV07962    Hearing Date:   September 28, 2023    Dept:  85 
Clay Dunn Enterprises, Inc. v. GCX,
LLC, et al., 23STCV07962
Tentative decision on application
for a right to attach order: granted




 
 
            
            Defendant
and Cross-Complainant GCX, LLC (“GCX” or “Contractor”) applies for a right to
attach order against Cross-Defendant Jackson Lewis, PC (“Jackson” or “Law Firm”)
for $5,763,298.19.
            The
court has read and considered the moving papers, opposition, and reply,[1] and
renders the following tentative decision. 
            
            A. Statement of the Case
            1.
First Amended Complaint
            Plaintiff Clay Dunn Enterprises, Inc.,
doing business as Air-Tec (“Air-Tec” or “Subcontractor”), filed the Complaint
against Contractor and Landlord Realty, LLC (“Landlord”) on April 11,
2023.  The operative pleading is the
First Amended Complaint (“FAC”), filed on April 17, 2023 and alleging (1)
foreclosure on a mechanic’s lien against all Defendants, and (2) breach of
contract, (3) account stated, (4) reasonable value of labor and materials, and
(5) open book account only as to GCX.  The
FAC alleges in pertinent part as follows.
            EYP Realty, LLC (“EYP” or “Landlord”)
owns 725 S. Figueroa Street, Los Angeles, California 90017 (“Property”).  Before February 28, 2023, Contractor executed
a written contract and change orders for heating ventilation and air
conditioning labor and materials with Subcontractor for the Property.  On February 10, 2023, to secure its claim
under that contract, Subcontractor recorded a lien against the Property.
            Subcontractor performed all duties
under the contract.  Defendants now owe $1,098,716
plus 10% annual interest accruing beginning on February 28, 2023.  
            Subcontractor seeks damages of $1,098,716,
plus 10% annual interest calculated from February 28, 2023, $103 for fees to
record the lien, sale of the Property with proceeds applied to the amount owed,
as necessary, and attorney’s fees and costs.
 
            2. Cross-Complaint
            On May 15, 2023, Contractor filed the
Cross-Complaint against Landlord and Law Firm, alleging (1) breach of contract, (2) foreclosure of mechanics lien,
(3) unjust enrichment, (4) open book account, (5) account stated, and (6)
quantum meruit.  The Cross-Complaint
alleges in pertinent part as follows.
            Law Firm has a principal office in
Suite 2500 of the Property.  On September
16, 2022, Law Firm and Landlord entered into General Conditions of the Contract
for Construction (“Conditions”) for construction and remodeling of two office floors
for Law Firm’s use (“Project”).  
Also on September 16, 2022, Law Firm and Contractor executed
a Standard Form of Agreement Between Owner and Contractor (“Construction
Contract”).  Under the Construction
Contract, Contractor agreed to construct the Project for $6,397,038.  Law Firm agreed to make progress payments on
the total amount owed based on Applications for Payment (“Application”)
that Contractor submitted and Certificates for Payment (“Certificate”) that Law
Firm issued.  If Law Firm received the
Application before the 25th day of any given month, payment was due by the 25th
day of the next month.  If not, payment
was due 30 days after receipt of the Application.
            Contractor
strictly adhered to the Construction Contract, but Law Firm has failed to pay Contractor
pursuant to the submitted Applications. 
Because Contractor was responsible for hiring subcontractors, these subcontractors
have now sued it.  On April 21, 2023, Contractor
had a lien recorded against the Property to secure its claim.
            Contractor
seeks specific performance of Law Firm’s duty under the Construction Contract.  Contractor seeks $5,763,298.19 plus 10%
annual interest accruing from April 4, 2023. 
It also requests that the court adjudge that sum as a lien on the
Property or so much thereof as necessary, to be sold with proceeds applied to
the amount owed.  Upon prevailing on this
Cross-Complaint, GCX seeks attorney’s fees and costs.
 
            3.
Course of Proceedings
            On April 12, 2023, Air-Tec
served EYP with the Complaint and Summons.
            On April 13, 2023, Air-Tec
served GCX with the Complaint and Summons.
            On May 15, 2023, GCX
filed an Answer to the Complaint.  It
also filed its Cross-Complaint and served it on Air-Tec by email.
            On May 22, 2023, GCX
filed notice of a related case, Comet Electric, Inc. v. GCX, LLC, Case
No. 23STCV11352.
            On June 12, 2023, GCX
served Jackson with the Cross-Complaint.
            On June 23, 2023,
Department 86 (Hon. Mitchell Beckloff) confirmed the appointment of a receiver
in Wilmington Trust et al v. EYP Realty, (“Wilmington”) Case No.
23STCV10983.  Pursuant to the order
confirming the appointment, all claims against EYP and its subsidiaries were
stayed.
            On August 15, 2023, GCX
and Jackson stipulated to submit the dispute in the Cross-Complaint for
arbitration and to stay this action, provided GCX could proceed with this
application for a right to attach order. 
Both parties preserved all rights, defenses, and arguments for this
matter.
 
            B.
Applicable Law
            Attachment
is a prejudgment remedy providing for the seizure of one or more of the
defendant’s assets to aid in the collection of a money demand pending the
outcome of the trial of the action.  See
Whitehouse v. Six Corporation, (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 527, 533.  In 1972, and in a 1977 comprehensive
revision, the Legislature enacted attachment legislation (CCP §481.010 et
seq.) that meets the due process requirements set forth in Randone v.
Appellate Department, (1971) 5 Cal.3d 536. 
See Western Steel & Ship Repair v. RMI, (12986) 176
Cal.App.3d 1108, 1115.  As the attachment
statutes are purely the creation of the Legislature, they are strictly
construed.  Vershbow v. Reiner,
(1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 879, 882.




            A
writ of attachment may be issued only in an action on a claim or claims for
money, each of which is based upon a contract, express or implied, where the
total amount of the claim or claims is a fixed or readily ascertainable amount
not less than five hundred dollars ($500). 
CCP §483.010(a).  A claim is
“readily ascertainable” where the amount due may be clearly ascertained from
the contract and calculated by evidence; the fact that damages are unliquidated
is not determinative.  CIT
Group/Equipment Financing, Inc. v. Super DVD, Inc., (2004) 115 Cal.App.4th
537, 540-41 (attachment appropriate for claim based on rent calculation for
lease of commercial equipment).
            All
property within California of a corporation, association, or partnership is
subject to attachment if there is a method of levy for the property.  CCP §487.010(a), (b).  While a trustee is a natural person, a trust
is not.  Therefore, a trust’s property is
subject to attachment on the same basis as a corporation or partnership.  Kadison, Pfaelzer, Woodard, Quinn &
Rossi v. Wilson, supra, 197 Cal.App.3d at 4.
            The
plaintiff may apply for a right to attach order by noticing a hearing for the
order and serving the defendant with summons and complaint, notice of the
application, and supporting papers any time after filing the complaint.  CCP §484.010. 
Notice of the application must be given pursuant to CCP section 1005,
sixteen court days before the hearing.  See
ibid.
            The
notice of the application and the application may be made on Judicial Council
forms (Optional Forms AT-105, 115).  The
application must be supported by an affidavit showing that the plaintiff on the
facts presented would be entitled to a judgment on the claim upon which the
attachment is based.  CCP §484.030.  
             Where the defendant is a corporation, a
general reference to “all corporate property which is subject to attachment
pursuant to subdivision (a) of Code of Civil Procedure Section 487.010” is
sufficient.  CCP §484.020(e).  Where the defendant is a partnership or other
unincorporated association, a reference to “all property of the partnership or
other unincorporated association which is subject to attachment pursuant to
subdivision (b) of Code of Civil Procedure Section 487.010” is sufficient.  CCP §484.020(e).  A specific description of property is not
required for corporations and partnerships as they generally have no exempt
property.  Bank of America v. Salinas
Nissan, Inc., (“Bank of America”) (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 260, 268.
            A
defendant who opposes issuance of the order must file and serve a notice of
opposition and supporting affidavit as required by CCP section 484.060 not
later than five court days prior to the date set for hearing.  CCP §484.050(e).  The notice of opposition may be made on a
Judicial Council form (Optional Form AT-155). 

            The
plaintiff may file and serve a reply two court days prior to the date set for
the hearing.  CCP §484.060(c). 
            At
the hearing, the court determines whether the plaintiff should receive a right
to attach order and whether any property which the plaintiff seeks to attach is
exempt from attachment.  The defendant
may appear the hearing.  CCP
§484.050(h).  The court generally will
evaluate the attachment application based solely on the pleadings and
supporting affidavits without taking additional evidence.  Bank of America, supra, 207
Cal.App.3d at 273. A verified complaint may be used in lieu of or in addition
to an affidavit if it states evidentiary facts. 
CCP §482.040.  The plaintiff has
the burden of proof, and the court is not required to accept as true any
affidavit even if it is undisputed.  See
Bank of America, supra, at 271, 273.



            The
court may issue a right to attach order (Optional Form AT-120) if the plaintiff
shows all of the following: (1) the claim on which the attachment is based is
one on which an attachment may be issued (CCP §484.090(a)(1)); (2) the
plaintiff has established the probable validity of the claim (CCP
§484.090(a)(2)); (3) attachment is sought for no purpose other than the
recovery on the subject claim (CCP §484.090(a)(3); and (4) the amount to be
secured by the attachment is greater than zero (CCP §484.090(a)(4)). 
            A
claim has “probable validity” where it is more likely than not that the
plaintiff will recover on that claim. 
CCP §481.190.  In determining this
issue, the court must consider the relative merits of the positions of the
respective parties.  Kemp Bros.
Construction, Inc. v. Titan Electric Corp., (2007) 146 Cal.App.4th 1474,
1484.  The court does not determine
whether the claim is actually valid; that determination will be made at trial
and is not affected by the decision on the application for the order.  CCP §484.050(b).
            Except
in unlawful detainer actions, the amount to be secured by the attachment is the
sum of (1) the amount of the defendant’s indebtedness claimed by the plaintiff,
and (2) any additional amount included by the court for estimate of costs and
any allowable attorneys’ fees under CCP section 482.110.  CCP §483.015(a); Goldstein v. Barak
Construction, (2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 845, 852.  This amount must be reduced by the sum of (1)
the amount of indebtedness that the defendant has in a money judgment against plaintiff,
(2) the amount claimed in a cross-complaint or affirmative defense and shown
would be subject to attachment against the plaintiff, and (3) the value of any
security interest held by the plaintiff in the defendant’s property, together
with the amount by which the acts of the plaintiff (or a prior holder of the security
interest) have decreased that security interest’s value.  CCP §483.015(b); see also CCP
§483.010(b) (“an attachment may not be issued on a claim which is secured by
any interest in real property arising from agreement, statute, or other rule of
law…However, an attachment may be issued where the claim was originally so
secured but, without any act of the plaintiff or the person to whom the
security was given, the security has become valueless or has decreased in value
to less than the amount then owing on the claim).  A defendant claiming that the amount to be
secured should be reduced because of a cross-claim or affirmative defense must
make a prima facie showing that the claim would result in an attachment
against the plaintiff.
            Before
the issuance of a writ of attachment, the plaintiff is required to file an
undertaking to pay the defendant any amount the defendant may recover for any
wrongful attachment by the plaintiff in the action.  CCP §489.210. 
The undertaking ordinarily is $10,000. CCP §489.220.  If the defendant objects, the court may
increase the amount of undertaking to the amount determined as the probable
recovery for wrongful attachment.  CCP
§489.220.  The court also has inherent
authority to increase the amount of the undertaking sua sponte.  North Hollywood Marble Co. v. Superior
Court, (1984) 157 Cal.App.3d 683, 691.
            
            C. Statement of Facts
            1. Contractor’s Evidence
            On September 16, 2022, Law Firm as
Owner and GCX as Contractor executed the Construction Contract.  Walker Decl., ¶¶ 9-10, Ex. B.  Under the Construction Contract, GCX agreed
to act as a contractor on the Project for $6,397,038.  Walker Decl., Ex. B.  
            Contractor uses a two-part billing
process.  Walker Decl., ¶6.  First, the Project Administration Team
compiles all services performed into a monthly Pencil Draft Billing with
billing requests from subcontractors and suppliers, Contractor Daily Reports,
and accompanying site photos.  Walker
Decl., ¶6.  The Project’s Management
& Field Staff then reviews the Pencil Draft Billing.  Walker Decl., ¶6.  The Project Team, client representatives, and
the architect of record then review each package to ensure it accurately
reflects construction progress.  Walker
Decl., ¶6.  Once the architect of record
approves the Pencil Draft Billing, Contractor uses it to generate an
Application and Certificates.  Walker
Decl., ¶6.
            Within seven days of receipt of an
Application, section 9.4.1 requires the architect to either issue Law Firm a
Certificate for the full amount of the Application, issue one for the amount
the architect deems due, or withhold certification entirely.  Walker Decl., ¶6(d)(i), Ex. B.  If the architect chooses to withhold
certification in full or part, it must notify Contractor.  Walker Decl., ¶6(d)(i), Ex. B.  The architect never gave such notice.  Walker Decl., ¶6(e).
            Under section 5.1.1 of the
Construction Contract, Law Firm agreed to make progress payments based on
submitted Applications and issued Certificates. 
Walker Decl., ¶6(c)(i), Ex. B.  Under
section 5.1.3, if Law Firm received an Application before the 25th day of any
given month, payment was due by the 25th day of the next month.  Walker Decl., ¶6(c)(ii), Ex. B.  If not, payment was due 30 days after receipt
of the Application.  Walker Decl.,
¶6(c)(ii), Ex. B.
            The Construction Contract incorporates
the Conditions by reference as part of the “Contract Documents.”  Walker Decl., ¶9, Ex. C.  Section 1.1.2 of the Conditions contains an
integration clause limiting any amendment of the Contract Documents to a
Modification.  Walker Decl., Ex. C.  Section 1.1.1 defines a “Modification” as (1)
a written amendment to the Contract Documents signed by both parties, (2) a
Change Order, (3) a Construction Change Directive, or (4) a written order for a
minor change in the Work issued by the Architect.  Walker Decl., Ex. C.  
            Section 6.2 of the Construction
Contract requires arbitration of any dispute between the parties pursuant to
the section 15.4 of the Conditions.   Walker
Decl., Ex. B.  Section 15.4 of the
Conditions requires the initiating party to make a written demand for
arbitration asserting all claims then known to that party.  Walker Decl., Ex. C.
            Between November 2022 and January
2023, Contractor issued four Applications for completed work and
materials.  Walker Decl., ¶¶ 11-14, Exs.
D-G.  On
January 26, 2023, the architect approved the third and fourth
Applications.  Walker Decl., ¶16, Ex. H.  On February 8, 2023, Contractor followed up
with Law Firm via email about outstanding amounts owed under two of the
Applications.  Walker Decl., ¶17, Ex. I.  After various exchanges, on February 21,
2023, Law Firm asserted it was diligently pursuing payment of invoices by Landlord.  Walker Decl., ¶17, Ex. I.  
            On February 22, 2023, Contractor
issued a fifth Application and Certificate, which the architect approved.  Walker Decl., ¶18.[2]
            On February 24, 2023, Contractor
advised Law Firm that several subcontractors had threatened to record a lien or
stop work unless they received payment. 
Walker Decl., ¶17, Ex. I.  Contractor
feared they might act on these threats the following week unless paid
immediately.  Walker Decl., ¶17, Ex. I.
            On March 3, 2023, Contractor spoke
with Law Firm’s counsel about the continued failure to make payments.  Walker Decl., ¶19.  In an email that day memorializing the
conversation, Contractor explained that it would demobilize at the end of the
shift that day if Law Firm could not pay Contractor, which in turn would
prevent Contractor from paying the subcontractors.  Walker Decl., ¶19, Ex. J.  It also expected the subcontractors to file
liens.  Walker Decl., ¶19, Ex. J.  Contractor would hold Law Firm responsible
for any added costs from this delay, including the introduction of a new team
if the current team became unavailable before work could resume.  Walker Decl., ¶19, Ex. J.  On April 5, 2023, Contractor issued a sixth Application
and Certificate.  Walker Decl., ¶20.
            The value of completed work and
materials in the Applications total $5,855,741.69.  Walker Decl., ¶8.  The only payment Contractor has received
under the Construction Contract is a $92,443.50 payment from Law Firm on
November 21, 2022.  Walker Decl., ¶¶
7-8.  This reduces the amount owed for
completed work under the Applications from $5,855,741.69 to $5,763,298.19.  Walker Decl., ¶8; Gizer Decl., ¶3.  Contractor owes this much of this money to subcontractors
for work on the Project.  Gizer Decl., ¶4.  The only purpose of this application is to recover
for the breach of contract.  Gizer Decl.,
¶2.
 
            2. Law Firm’s Evidence
            a. Background
            Law Firm is an employment law firm
with 60 offices nationwide.  Charwat
Decl., ¶4.  It has been a tenant in the
Property for over 20 years.  Charwat
Decl., ¶5.  It currently holds three
client trust accounts with Wells Fargo Bank, with account numbers ending in 2561,
8326, and 3114.  Charwat Decl., ¶11.  
            Law Firm is neither insolvent nor at
risk of insolvency.  Charwat Decl., ¶7.  In 2022, it saw a 5.2% year-over-year revenue
growth from $550.7 million to $579.6 million. 
Charwat Decl., ¶8.  It also saw a
5.4% net income growth to $220 million.  Charwat
Decl., ¶8.  It expects further growth in
2023.  Charwat Decl., ¶9.  It has the financial capacity to pay amounts
owed under the Applications and Construction Contract.  Charwat Decl., ¶10.  It has not done so, but only because it
believes that Landlord owes the claimed amount instead.  Charwat Decl., ¶10; Pareso Decl., ¶11.
 
            b. Landlord’s Liability
            Law Firm’s lease on the Property was
set to expire on September 30, 2023.  Charwat
Decl., ¶6.  To induce Law Firm to renew
it through 2038, Landlord promised to relocate Law Firm to two contiguous
floors and finance tenant improvements of up to $6,931,120 (“Construction
Allowance”).  Charwat Decl., ¶6, Ex. 1; Pareso
Decl., ¶4.  
            In section 8.2 of Exhibit C to Addendum
No. 6 to the lease, dated December 21, 2021, Landlord agreed to disburse the
Construction Allowance periodically to pay construction costs pursuant to a
Draw Request from Law Firm.  Charwat
Decl., ¶6, Ex. 1.  Under section
8.2(c)(1), a Draw Request could direct Landlord to either reimburse Law Firm
for paid invoices or directly pay the contractor with which Law Firm has
incurred outstanding costs.  Charwat
Decl., ¶6, Ex. 1.
            Law Firm verbally told Contractor
that Landlord would pay Contractor instead of Law Firm.  Pareso Decl., ¶5.  Both Landlord and Contractor agreed to
this.  Pareso Decl., ¶5.  It was Landlord that made the $92,443.50
payment pursuant to Law Firm’s Draw Request. 
Pareso Decl., ¶5, Ex. 1.  Law Firm
had requested that Landlord pay Contractor directly for its first Application.  Pareso Decl., ¶5, Ex. 1.  
            On January 16, 2023, Contractor
emailed both Landlord and Law Firm about payment of the second Application.  Pareso Decl., ¶5, Ex. 2.  Landlord, under the name Brookfield
Properties, replied that it was expecting funding within the next two weeks and
would keep Contractor updated.  Pareso
Decl., ¶5, Ex. 2.  Contractor thanked Landlord
for the update and did not object.  Pareso
Decl., ¶5, Ex. 2.  
            On January 27, 2023, Contractor
emailed Law Firm’s Facilities Project Manager Robert Pareso (“Pareso”) about
the third Application.  Pareso Decl., ¶6,
Ex. 3.  Pareso asked Landlord if the provided
information was sufficient to process payment. 
Pareso Decl., ¶6, Ex. 3.  Landlord
replied that it would “go ahead and get this processed.”  Pareso Decl., ¶6, Ex. 3.  
            However, after the first $92,443.50
payment, Landlord refused without explanation to honor its commitment.  Pareso Decl., ¶8.  With the Project over 50% complete and
millions of dollars of outstanding debt, Contractor walked off the job.  Pareso Decl., ¶9.  The Project has been suspended and remains in
jeopardy.  Pareso Decl., ¶10.  
 
            c. Course of Proceedings
            Six related lawsuits are pending.  Bolstad Decl.,
¶4.  One is between Law Firm and Landlord.  Bolstad Decl., ¶4.  Other than Contractor, three subcontractors
have separately filed suit against Law Firm and Landlord as co-defendants.  Bolstad Decl., ¶4.  In the sixth case, Wilmington, Landlord
was placed in receivership.  Bolstad
Decl., ¶4, Ex. 2.
            Due to the disputes in related
actions, Contractor and others have recorded mechanic’s liens against the
Property.  Bolstad Decl., ¶3, Ex. 1.
            After Contractor filed the
Cross-Complaint, Law Firm demanded that the parties stipulate to
arbitration.  Bolstad Decl., ¶¶ 5-6, Ex.
3.  On August 28, 2023, Department 52
(Hon. Armen Tamzarian) ordered the Cross-Complaint stayed pending a final award
in arbitration.  Bolstad Decl., ¶6, Ex.
4.  Pursuant to the parties’ stipulation,
Contractor could still proceed with the instant application for a right to
attach order.  Bolstad Decl., ¶6, Ex. 4.  Both parties preserved all rights, defenses,
and arguments they could raise therein.  Bolstad
Decl., ¶6, Ex. 4.
            Rule R-38(a) of the Construction
Industry Arbitration Rules allows the arbitrator to take interim measures
deemed necessary, including injunctive relief and measures for the protection
or conservation of property and disposition of perishable goods.  Bolstad Decl., ¶7, Ex. 5.
 
            3. Reply Evidence
            Contractor never agreed
to modify the Construction Contract to make Landlord responsible for payment
thereunder instead of Law Firm.  Walker
Reply Decl., ¶4.  Contractor always
submitted Applications to Law Firm and the architect.  Walker Reply Decl., ¶4.  Its cooperation with Law Firm’s efforts to
extract payment from Landlord did not create such a modification.  Walker Reply Decl., ¶4.  Contractor’s email about the third
Application (Pareso Decl., ¶6, Ex. 3) was directed at Pareso as a Law Firm employee.
 Walker Reply Decl., ¶5.
            On April 24, 2023, Contractor
emailed Law Firm to seek amenable resolution of the current dispute.  See Gizer Reply Decl., ¶2.  On May 4, 2023, Contractor’s counsel emailed Law
Firm that it had no choice but to proceed with litigation for breach of
contract and lien foreclosure.  Gizer
Reply Decl., ¶3, Ex. A.  Counsel noted
the arbitration clause in the Construction Contract and asked to discuss the
process for initiating arbitration.  Gizer
Reply Decl., ¶3, Ex. A.  Law Firm never
responded to the request to discuss how to initiate arbitration.  Gizer Reply Decl., ¶4.  
When Contractor
filed the Cross-Complaint and this application for a writ of attachment, it
believed in good faith that Law Firm had waived its right to arbitration.  Gizer Reply Decl., ¶¶ 4, 6.  Despite ongoing negotiations, Law Firm did
not invoke its right to arbitrate until August 2, 2023, after Contractor filed
this application on July 24, 2023.  Gizer
Reply Decl., ¶¶ 5, 7.  
 
            D. Analysis
            Plaintiff
Contractor applies for a right to attach order against Defendant Law Firm in
the amount of $5,763,298.19.
 
            1.
A Claim Based on a Contract and on Which Attachment May Be Based 
            A
writ of attachment may be issued only in an action on a claim or claims for
money, each of which is based upon a contract, express or implied, where the
total amount of the claim or claims is a fixed or readily ascertainable amount
not less than five hundred dollars ($500).  CCP §483.010(a).  
            Contractor’s
application is based on a series of Applications and Certificates issued
pursuant to the Construction Contract. 
Walker Decl., ¶¶ 6(c)(i), 11-14, 18, 20, Exs. B, D-G.  Attachment may be based on this contract
claim. 
             
            2.
An Amount Due That is Fixed and Readily Ascertainable  
            A
claim is “readily ascertainable” where the damages may be readily ascertained
by reference to the contract and the basis of the calculation appears to be
reasonable and definite.  CIT Group/Equipment Financing, Inc. v. Super
DVD, Inc., (“CIT”) (2004) 115 Cal.App.4th 537, 540-41.  The
fact that the damages are unliquidated is not determinative.  Id. 
But the contract must furnish a standard by which the amount may be ascertained
and there must be a basis by which the damages can be determined by
proof.  Id. (citations omitted). 
            Under
section 5.1.1 of the Construction Contract, Law Firm as Owner was required to
make progress payments based on submitted Applications and issued
Certificates.  Walker Decl., ¶6(c)(i),
Ex. B.  Contractor asserts that Law Firm
accrued $5,855,741.69 in Certificates but only paid $92,443.50, for an
outstanding balance of $5,763,298.19. 
Walker Decl., ¶¶ 7-8; Gizer Decl., ¶3. 
Although it purports to submit six Certificates, it inadvertently failed
to attach two of them to its declarations. 
Walker Decl., ¶¶ 6(c)(i), 11-14, 18, 20, Exs. B, D-G.  Because Law Firm does not dispute that the
outstanding balance on the Construction Contract is $5,763,298.19, this defect
is waived.  $5,763,298.19 in damages are
ascertainable.
 
            3.
Probability of Success 
            A
claim has “probable validity” where it is more likely than not that the
plaintiff will recover on that claim.  CCP §481.190.  In determining
this issue, the court must consider the relative merits of the positions of the
respective parties.  Kemp Bros. Construction, Inc. v. Titan Electric
Corp., (2007) 146 Cal.App.4th 1474, 1484.  The court does not
determine whether the claim is actually valid; that determination will be made
at trial and is not affected by the decision on the application for the
order.  CCP §484.050(b). 
            The
only dispute as to the merits is whether Landlord or Law Firm is liable for the
breach.  In an addendum to Law Firm’s lease
for the Property, Landlord agreed to disburse up to $6,931,120 in Construction
Allowances to either Law Firm or to a contractor with which Law Firm incurs
renovation costs.  Charwat Decl., ¶6, Ex.
1.  Law Firm had Landlord make a $92,443.50
payment pursuant to Law Firm’s Draw Request.  Pareso Decl., ¶5, Ex. 1.  It now alleges that Contractor orally agreed
to modify the Construction Agreement so Landlord was responsible for payments
owed thereunder instead of Law Firm. 
Opp. at 13; Pareso Decl., ¶5.  It
further assented to this arrangement insofar as it did not object when Law Firm
deferred to Landlord in emails about future payments.  Opp. at 13; Pareso Decl., Exs. 2-3.
            The
Construction Agreement and accompanying Conditions do not permit oral modification.  Reply at 5; Walker Decl., Exs. B-C.  Additionally, Law Firm’s evidence that
Contractor agreed that Landlord would be responsible for payment both lacks
foundation and does not obviate Law Firm’s liability.  The parties could agree that Landlord would
make direct payments to Contractor without assignment of Law Firm’s
liability.  Further, Contractor’s
cooperation with efforts to extract payment from Landlord does not modify the
contract to exempt Law Firm from liability.  Walker Reply Decl., ¶4.  Contractor has demonstrated a probability of
success on the merits.

Attachment Sought for a Proper Purpose¿ 
            Attachment
must not be sought for a purpose other than the recovery on the claim upon
which attachment is based.¿ CCP §484.090(a)(3). 
Contractor seeks attachment for a proper purpose.

Provisional Remedy Pending Arbitration
            CCP
section 1281.8(b) provides that
a party to an arbitration agreement may apply to the court for provisional
relief in connection with an arbitrable controversy, but only upon the ground
that the award may be rendered ineffectual without provisional relief.  The requirements of CCP section 1281.8 are in
addition to the other elements of proof for provisional relief.  See Woolley v. Embassy Suites, Inc.,
(1991) 227 Cal.App.3d 1520, 1529 (applying section 1281.8 to preliminary
injunction).  The “ineffectual” element
exists to ensure that the court does not invade the province of the arbitrator;
the court is empowered to grant relief only where the arbitrator’s award may be
inadequate to make the moving party whole. 
California Retail Portfolio Fund GMBH & Co. v. Hopkins Real
Estate Group, (2011) 193 Cal.App.4th 849, 856 (citing Woolley).  In the context of attachment, the irreparable
harm requirement for ex parte attachment provides guidance on the issue
of, and is similar to, ineffectual relief under section 1281.8.  Id. at 859.  This includes both insolvency and the
inability to otherwise pay damages that might be awarded in the
arbitration.  Ibid.  
            Section 6.2 of the Construction
Contract subjects any disputes between the parties to arbitration.  Walker Decl., Exs. B-C.  After Contractor filed this
application, the parties stipulated to arbitrate the Cross-Complaint.  Bolstad Decl., ¶6, Ex. 4.  
Law
Firm argues that Contractor’s moving papers do not address CCP section
1281.8 and do not explain why an arbitration award would be rendered ineffectual without
provisional relief.  Law Firm also
presents evidence that the applicable arbitration rules would permit
provisional remedies as part of the arbitration.  Bolstad Decl., ¶7, Ex. 5.
            Contractor replies that that CCP
section 1281.8 does not apply.  In an
email on May 4, 2023, Contractor cited the arbitration clause and asked to
discuss the process for initiating arbitration.  Gizer Reply Decl., ¶3, Ex. A.  When Law Firm did not respond, Contractor
treated it as a waiver of the arbitration agreement.  Reply at 2; Gizer Reply Decl., ¶4.  By the time Contractor filed this
application, it believed in good faith that Law Firm had waived its right to
arbitration.  Gizer Reply Decl., ¶¶ 4, 6.
 Despite ongoing negotiations, Law Firm
did not invoke its right to arbitration until August 2, 2023, after Contractor
filed this application.  Gizer Reply
Decl., ¶¶ 5, 7.  When it did, the parties
stipulated to arbitration, and that Contractor could still proceed with this
application.  Bolstad Decl., ¶6,
Ex. 4.  Reply
at 2.
            This is a circumstance with which
the court is not unfamiliar.  The parties
have an arbitration agreement but a complaint (in this case, a cross-complaint)
is filed by the plaintiff.  The defendant
fails to make any reference to the parties’ arbitration agreement in
discussions before the complaint is filed. 
Because it is perfectly happy to try the case in court, the plaintiff
applies for a right to attach order without referring to CCP section 1281.8 or
trying to show that an arbitration award would be ineffectual without
attachment.  Only when it files the
opposition does the defendant contend that the plaintiff is required to comply
with CCP section 1281.8.  In this
circumstance, the court does not believe it just to allow an ineffectual award defense
to the plaintiff’s application.  Contractor
is not required to show that an arbitration award would be ineffectual.[3]

Secured by Real Property
            Although
it barely raises the issue, Law Firm suggests that Contractor’s claim is ineligible for
attachment because it is secured by a mechanic’s lien on the Property.  Bolstad Decl., ¶3, Ex. 1.  Opp. at 12, n. 2.  
An attachment
may not be issued on a claim which is secured by any interest in real property
arising from agreement, statute, or other rule of law (including any mortgage
or deed of trust of realty and any statutory, common law, or equitable lien on real
property.¿ CCP §483.010(b).¿ An attachment may be issued where the claim was
original secured by real property but, without any act of the plaintiff or the
person to whom the security was given, the security has become valueless or has
decreased in value to less than the amount then owing on the claim, in which
event the amount to be secured by the attachment shall not exceed the lesser of
the amount of the decrease or the difference between the value of the security
and the amount then owing on the claim.¿ CCP §483.010(b). 
            Contractor’s claim is
secured by its mechanic’s lien on the Property. 
A mechanic’s lien is not an interest in real property but is a right to
have property sold or otherwise applied in satisfaction of a debt.  See Civil Code §8440 (lien
attaches to the improvement and the real property on which it is
situated).  The claimant’s recording of a
mechanic’s lien does not affect the right to a writ of attachment.  Civil Code §8468(b).  See San Diego Wholesale Credit Men's Ass'n v Superior Court (1973) 35 Cal.App.3d 458, 463-64 (finding the same for Civil
Code section 3152, section 8468's predecessor).[4]
 
            E. Conclusion
            The
application for a right to attach order is granted in the amount of
$5,763,298.19.  Law Firm may post a bond
to avoid the issuance of a writ of attachment in the next four calendar days.  See CCP §489.310.
