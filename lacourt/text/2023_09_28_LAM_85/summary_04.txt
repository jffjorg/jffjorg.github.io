The judge has written a tentative ruling to address several issues before the court hearing. Firstly, the judge notes that both Jackson and GCX failed to lodge courtesy copies of their filings, in violation of the Presiding Judge's order. The judge admonishes counsel to provide courtesy copies in all future filings. Secondly, the judge points out that the declarant failed to attach exhibits K-M, despite claiming to do so. Thirdly, the judge rules that the court need not consider Contractor's argument that it has fulfilled the requirements of CCP section 1281.8(b) because Law Firm has demonstrated an unwillingness to pay. Finally, the judge notes that Contractor agrees with Law Firm that client trust accounts are not subject to attachment. The judge's ruling is intended to guide the court's decision at the upcoming hearing.
