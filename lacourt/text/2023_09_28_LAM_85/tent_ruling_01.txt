A.B.
v. Rob Bonta et al., 23STCP00529 

Tentative decision on motion
for attorney’s fees: denied



 
 
            
Petitioner A.B. (“A.B.”) moves for an award of $5,000 in
attorney’s fees from Respondent Rob Bonta in his capacity as an Attorney General
of the State of California (“DOJ”).
            The
court has read and considered the moving papers and opposition (no reply was
filed),[1]
and renders the following tentative decision.
 
            A.
Statement of the Case
            1.
Petition
            Petitioner
A.B. commenced this proceeding against Respondent DOJ on February 23, 2023,
alleging a single cause of action for traditional mandamus.  The Petition alleges in pertinent part as
follows. 
            The
DOJ is responsible for determining whether someone is legally eligible to
possess firearms and issuing a Certificate of Eligibility (“COE”).  A.B. is a police officer in Alaska, where he
has a license to possess firearms as part of his law enforcement duties.  
            A.B.’s
sole arrest was on March 8, 2013 as a juvenile, on suspicion of violation of
Penal Code section 245(a)(1).  No
juvenile case was filed against him.  On
April 19, 2016, the Los Angeles Superior Court granted a petition to seal his
juvenile records, which required any agency that had submitted records to the FBI
to recall the same and seal accordingly.
            The
Guadalupe Police Department (“GPD”) in Santa Barbara County has offered A.B.
employment contingent on receiving a COE. 
He moved to California in reliance on this offer.  He then learned that his sealed juvenile
arrest still appeared on his DOJ record.
            On
June 17, 2022, A.B. submitted a Claim of Alleged Inaccuracy or Incompleteness
(“Claim”) to the DOJ, which acknowledged receipt of the Claim on June 20,
2022.  On December 27, 2022, the DOJ denied
the request for a COE because it had identified a record for A.B. in a state or
federal database but arrest or disposition information was missing.  A.B. needed to have his record updated to
include such information.
            After
multiple exchanges, on February 16, 2023, the DOJ sent a letter thanking him for
contacting it about his Claim’s status. 
The DOJ was still processing the claim and would mail a response once
finished.
            A.B.’s
employment offer remains unsecured, and the GPD could withdraw it any time
before he receives a COE.  A.B. seeks a
writ of mandate compelling the issuance of the COE, plus attorney’s fees and
costs.
 
            2.
Course of Proceedings
            On
March 6, 2023, A.B. served the DOJ the Petition and served a second copy by
mail.
            On
May 11, 2023, the parties stipulated that the case be dismissed with prejudice
because the DOJ had granted the requested relief.
 
            B.
Applicable Law
            CCP section 1021.5 (“section 1021.5”) codifies the “private
attorney general” exception to the general rule that each side bears its own
fees unless the parties contracted otherwise.  See CCP §1021. 
Section 1021.5 permits a trial court to award fees to a successful party in any
action that: “has resulted in the enforcement of an important right affecting
the public interest if (a) a significant benefit has been conferred on the
general public or a large class of persons, (b) the necessity and financial burden
of private enforcement are such as to make the award appropriate, and (c) such
fees should not in the interest of justice be paid out of the recovery. 
The issue is committed to the trial court’s discretion.  Flannery v.
California Highway Patrol, (1998) 61 Cal.App.4th 629, 634. 
            Courts
take a “broad, pragmatic view of what constitutes a ‘successful party’” in
order to effectuate the policy underlying section 1021.5.  Graham v.
DaimlerChrysler Corp., (“Graham”) (2004) 34 Cal.4th 553, 565. 
The party seeking attorney’s fees need not prevail on all of its alleged
claims in order to qualify for an award.  Harbor v. Deukmejian,
(1987) 43 Cal.3d 1078, 1103; Daniels v. McKinney, (1983) 146 Cal.App.3d
42, 55.  The party is considered successful under section 1021.5 if the
litigation “contributed substantially to remedying the conditions at which it
was directed.” Planned Parenthood v. Aakhus, (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 162,
174.  In other words, the “successful” party under section 1021.5 is the
party that succeeds on “any significant issue in litigation which achieves some
of the benefit the parties sought in bringing suit.”  Maria P. v. Riles,
(1987) 43 Cal.3d 1281, 1292; see Tipton-Whittingham v. City of Los
Angeles, (2004) 34 Cal.4th 604, 610.  A prevailing party who qualifies
for an award under section 1021.5 are entitled to compensation for all hours
reasonably spent by their counsel.  Serrano v. Unruh, (1982) 32
Cal.3d 621, 632–33. 
            Unlike the
separate substantial benefit doctrine, “the ‘significant benefit’ that will
justify an attorney fee award need not represent a ‘tangible’ asset or a
‘concrete’ gain but, in some cases, may be recognized simply from the
effectuation of a fundamental constitutional or statutory policy.” Woodland
Hills Residents Assn., Inc. v. City Council, (1979) 23 Cal.3d 917,
939.  “[T]he benefit may be conceptual or doctrinal and need not be actual or
concrete; further, the effectuation of a statutory or constitutional purpose
may be sufficient.”  Braude v. Automobile Club of Southern Cal.,
(1986) 178 Cal.App.3d 994, 1011.  Moreover, the extent of the public
benefit need not be great to justify an attorney fee award.  See, e.g.,
Protect Our Water v. County of Merced, (2005) 130 Cal.App.4th 488, 496
(significant public benefit where litigation prompted agency to improve methods
of creating and managing its CEQA records). The trial court determines “the
significance of the benefit, as well as the size of the class receiving
benefit, from a realistic assessment, in light of all the pertinent
circumstances, of the gains which have resulted in a particular case.”  Woodland
Hills, supra, 23 Cal.3d at 939–940. 
            The party
seeking attorney’s fees must show that the necessity for pursuing the lawsuit
placed a burden on the plaintiff “out of proportion to his individual stake in
the matter.” Woodland Hills, supra, 23 Cal. 3d at 941. 
Although cases refer to this requirement as the “financial burden” criterion,
nothing in the language of CCP section 1021.5 limits the consideration of the
necessity and financial burden clause to solely financial interests.  Hammond
v. Agran, (2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 115, 125.  “The idea is that the
litigation for which fees are claimed must transcend one's interests, whether
pecuniary or not.”  Id. at 127.  The question is whether
advancement of the public interest was merely coincidental to the attainment of
the party’s personal goals.  Bowman v. City of¿Berkeley (“Bowman”)
(2005) 131 Cal.App.4th 173, 181.  The party seeking attorney’s fees bears
the burden of establishing that its litigation costs transcend its personal
interests.  Save Open Space Santa Monica Mountains v. Superior Court,
(“Save Open Space”) (2000) 84 Cal.App.4th 235, 247.  The trial
court's application of the financial burden criterion involves a “realistic and
practical comparison of the litigant's personal interest with the cost of
suit.” Families Unafraid to Uphold Rural El Dorado County v. Bd. of
Supervisors (“Families Unafraid”), (2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 505, 515.

Statement of Facts
            On
March 8, 2013, A.B. was arrested on suspicion of violation of Penal Code
section 245(a)(1).  A.B. Decl., ¶9, Ex.
B.  In June 2016, the Los Angeles
Superior Court granted a petition to seal his juvenile records and ordered any
agency which had submitted records to the FBI to recall them.  A.B. Decl., ¶9, Ex. B.  
            As
of March 2022, A.B. had spent a year as a licensed peace officer in Alaska.  A.B. Decl., ¶2.  He was fully authorized to possess and carry
firearms under state and federal law. 
A.B. Decl., ¶2.  He then applied
for a position as a GPD police officer. 
A.B. Decl., ¶3.  
            On
May 3, 2022, GPD conditionally hired A.B. contingent on the DOJ’s issuance of a
COE.  A.B. Decl., ¶4.  The COE would show A.B. has no criminal
history that would disqualify him from firearms possession.  A.B. Decl., ¶4.  A.B. was reasonably assured nothing on his
record would prevent that from occurring, so he relocated to California.  A.B. Decl., ¶5.  The GPD submitted the request for A.B.’s COE
in May 2022.  A.B. Decl., ¶6.
            On
December 27, 2022, the DOJ denied A.B.’s request for a COE.  A.B. Decl., ¶7, Ex. A.  It had identified a record for him in a state
or federal database but there was missing arrest or disposition
information.  A.B. Decl., ¶7, Ex. A.  A.B. needed to have his record updated to
include such information.  A.B. Decl.,
¶7, Ex. A.
            The
2013 incident was A.B.’s only arrest or conviction.  A.B. Decl., ¶9.  He was shocked to learn that his GPD
employment was in jeopardy.  A.B. Decl.,
¶10.  In an email to the DOJ on February
9, 2023, he asked what issues prevented issuance of the COE and what
information the DOJ needed.  A.B. Decl.,
¶11, Ex. C.  This was the latest in a
series of emails and phone calls on the issue. 
A.B. Decl., ¶12, Ex. C.  
            On
February 16, 2023, the DOJ replied that it was still reviewing or researching
A.B.’s Claim.  A.B. Decl., ¶12, Ex.
C.  It would mail a response to the
address on file once finished.  A.B.
Decl., ¶12, Ex. C.  
            Desperate
to keep his GPD employment, A.B. hired counsel and filed the Petition on
February 23, 2023.  A.B. Decl., ¶13, Ex.
D.  The DOJ was served with the Petition
on March 6, 2023.  A.B. Decl., ¶13, Ex.
D.  
            On
March 16, 2023, the DOJ sent A.B. a letter verifying that nothing in his record
would disqualify him from owning or purchasing a firearm.  A.B. Decl., ¶14, Ex. E.  It therefore approved the request for certification
to attend a basic training course.  A.B.
Decl., ¶14, Ex. E.  
            A.B.
requests $5,000 in attorney’s fees based on 2.5 hours for the pre-filing
investigation and review of applicable law, 3.5 hours to draft the Petition,
1.5 hours to communicate with the DOJ to resolve the matter, 1 hour to draft a
stipulation, 4 hours to draft this motion for attorney’s fees, and 3.5
anticipated hours to review the opposition and draft a reply thereto.  Kosnett Decl., ¶¶ 5-6.  Counsel has not billed A.B. for clerical or
paralegal fees.  Kosnett Decl., ¶7.
 
            D.
Analysis
            A.B. moves for $5,000 in attorney’s
fees under CCP section 1021.5.  The DOJ
does not dispute that $5,000 would be a reasonable fee award if A.B. is
entitled to it.
 
1. Procedural
Defect
As a
threshold issue, A.B. cannot sign a declaration without using his name.  An affidavit is a written declaration made
under oath, made without notice to the adverse party. CCP §2003. The true test of the sufficiency of an affidavit
is whether it has been drawn in such a manner that perjury could be charged
thereon if any material allegation contained in the affidavit is false. People
v. Thompson, (1935) 5 Cal. App. 2d 655; Application of Behymer,
(1933) 130 Cal. App. 200; Gee Chong Pong v. Harris, (1918) 38 Cal. App.
214.  Whenever an affidavit is required,
such matter may like force and effect be supported by a declaration under
penalty of perjury, “subscribed by him or her and, if executed within this
state, states that date and place of execution.” CCP §2015.5.  
Thus, a
declaration must be signed by the declarant in a manner that he or she could be
prosecuted for perjury.  Although signed
by him, A.B.’s declaration does not identify who he is and does not subject him
to  perjury prosecution.  As a result, he has presented no
evidence.  The proper procedure would
have been for A.B. to identify his name in his declaration and separately apply
for it to be sealed.  CRC 2.550-51.  A.B. has presented no evidence.
If, arguendo,
the court should consider A.B.’s declaration, the analysis is as follows.
 
            2. Successful Party
            Courts take a “broad, pragmatic view of what constitutes a
‘successful party’” in order to effectuate the policy underlying section
1021.5.  Graham, supra, 34 Cal.4th at 565.  A successful
party under section 1021.5 is the party that succeeds on “any significant issue
in litigation which achieves some of the benefit the parties sought in bringing
suit.”  Maria P. v. Riles, supra, 43 Cal.3d at 1292.  
            The “catalyst theory” permits an
award of attorneys’ fees even when the litigation does not result in a judicial
resolution if the defendant changes its behavior substantially because of, and
in the manner sought by, the litigation. 
A plaintiff must establish that (1) the lawsuit was a catalyst
motivating the defendants to provide the primary relief sought; (2) the lawsuit
had merit and achieved its catalytic effect by threat of victory, not by dint
of nuisance and threat of expense; and (3) the plaintiffs reasonably attempted
to settle the litigation prior to filing the lawsuit. Tipton-Whittingham v.
City of Los Angeles, (2004), 34 Cal. 4th 604, 608.
            A.B. presents evidence that from December
2022 through February 2023, he communicated with the DOJ multiple times about his
pending request for a COE.  A.B. Decl.,
¶12, Ex. C.  He asserts that his attempts
to compel issuance of the COE and address the mysterious obstacle thereto
failed and he therefore had no choice but to file and serve the Petition.  A.B. Decl., ¶13, Ex. D.  Ten days later, the DOJ issued the firearms
clearance.  A.B. Decl., ¶14, Ex. E.  
            The DOJ cites Graham, supra,
34 Cal.4th at 571, which held that a plaintiff seeking attorney’s fees under
section 1021.5 need not engage in lengthy negotiations but must at least notify
the defendant agency of his grievances and proposed remedies and give it the opportunity
to meet its demands within a reasonable time. 
Opp. at 8.  
            A.B.’s February 9 email states it
was the latest of several attempts to resolve the issue.  A.B. Decl., ¶12, Ex. C.  However, the email does not indicate anything
about his proposed remedies.  Instead, he
asked what the issue was that was affecting his eligibility clearance.  Ex. C. 
The DOJ’s response was that it was still processing the application and
would contact A.B. when finished.  A.B.
Decl., ¶12, Ex. C.  The DOJ did not
suggest that it would deny the application. 
A.B. did not make a reasonable attempt to settle the dispute.  
            A.B. asserts his career was in
jeopardy for as long as the DOJ kept his COE application undecided.  A.B. Decl., ¶13.  Mot. at 8. 
This fact bears on A.B.’s sense of urgency but not the reasonableness of
his attempt to resolve the dispute.  
            A.B. is not a successful party under
a catalyst theory for purposes of section 1021.5.
 
            3. Enforcement
of an Important Right Affecting the Public Interest 
            The
first prong of the section 1021.5 test — whether a petitioner’s action has
resulted in the enforcement of an important right affecting the public interest
— requires a determination of the strength or societal importance of the right
involved.  Roybal v. Governing Bd. of
Salinas City Elementary School Dist., (2008) 159 Cal.App.4th 1143,
1148.  The right, whether constitutional
or statutory, must be an important right affecting the public interest, not
something involving trivial or peripheral public policies.  Ibid. 
The societal importance of a right generally is determined by
realistically assessing the significance of that right in terms of its
relationship to the achievement of fundamental legislative goals.  Robinson v. City of Chowchilla, 
(2011) 202 Cal.App.4th 382, 394.  
            A.B.
ties the DOJ’s failure to issue a COE before he filed a Petition to the important
right to follow a lawful occupation.  Those
who work in law enforcement or other fields requiring firearm possession rely
on the DOJ to fairly, accurately, and timely determine firearms eligibility.  Undue delay or unreasonable refusal may and
likely has led to denial of employment to which an applicant would otherwise be
entitled.  Mot. at 8-9.
            The
court will assume that the right to bear a firearm as a policeman is an
important right.
 
            4. Significant Benefit Conferred on
the General Public
            The
second prong of the section 1021.5 test is whether plaintiff’s action has
conferred a significant benefit, whether pecuniary or nonpecuniary, on the
general public or a large class of persons. 
The trial court is required to determine the significance of the benefit
as well as the size of the group favorably impacted by making a realistic
assessment, in light of all the circumstances, of the gains which have resulted
in a particular case.  Bui v. Nguyen, (2014) 230 Cal.App.4th
1357, 1366.
            A.B.
asserts his action could conceivably benefit the general public by ensuring
that the DOJ makes determinations of eligibility fairly, accurately, and in a
reasonably timely manner in individuals with dependent employment interests.  Mot. at 9. 

The word “could” highlights the argument’s deficiency.  A.B. did not enforce any rights other than
his own and conferred no benefit on the general public or a large group of
persons. 
            
            5. Necessity and Financial Burden
of Private Enforcement 
            The
third prong asks whether the necessity and financial burden of private
enforcement are such as to make the award appropriate.  This prong encompasses two issues: (1)
whether private enforcement was necessary and (2) whether the financial burden
of private enforcement warrants subsidizing the successful party’s
attorneys.  Lyons v. Chinese Hospital
Assn., (2006) 136 Cal.App.4th 1331, 1348.
            A.B.
asserts that he was unemployed and could not begin his job with the GPD until
the DOJ granted the COE.  The $5,000 in
fees he paid was significant.  Kosnett
Decl., ¶¶ 5-6.  Mot. at 10; 
A.B. misunderstands this requirement.  At issue is whether the cost of the
litigation outweighs A.B.’s financial stake in bringing this action.  See Millview
County Water Dist. v. State Water Resources Control Bd., (2016) 4
Cal.App.5th 759, 768.  A.B. admits that
his financial stake was his whole livelihood. 
The $5,000 that he incurred is not disproportionate to his stake in the
case.  A.B. has not shown that the
financial burden of private enforcement outweighs his stake in the litigation.
            
            E. Conclusion
            A.B.
has not presented admissible evidence. 
He also does not meet the definition of a successful party under a catalyst
theory, the Petition did not yield a significant benefit to the public or a
large class of persons, and his financial burden in the litigation stems from his
private interests.  The motion for attorney’s
fees is denied.
