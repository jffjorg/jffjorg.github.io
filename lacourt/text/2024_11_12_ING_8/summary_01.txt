Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel medical authorization to be signed by the plaintiff, Tony Talbert, in a case involving a dental malpractice claim. The defendants, Marina Adams, D.D.S. and Marina Adams, DDS, a professional dental corporation dba New Image Dental, subpoenaed records from the Veteran Affairs Greater Los Angeles Health Care System (VA Hospital) as part of discovery in the case. The court is inclined to fashion some relief, but more narrowly tailored to plaintiff's treatment at the VA hospital in connection with the subject assault.

The court notes that it does not have express authority under the Discovery Act to compel a plaintiff to sign an authorization for release of records. The court cites case law on this issue, including Miranda v. 21st Century Ins. Co. (2004) 117 Cal.App.4th 913 and O'Grady v. Superior Court (2006) 139 Cal.App.4th 1423, which suggest that the court has authority to compel a non-party's compliance with a proper deposition subpoena for records.

The court seeks argument from counsel as to whether a narrowed scope of SDT can be prepared, whether plaintiff will or will not sign a medical records authorization form, or whether the court could or should have the Clerk sign such an authorization on plaintiff's behalf. The court is inclined to fashion some relief, but more narrowly tailored to plaintiff's treatment at the VA hospital in connection with the subject assault.
