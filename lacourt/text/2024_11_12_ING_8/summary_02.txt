And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has denied the Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Adjudication, which sought to eliminate the Defendant's defenses to non-willful civil penalties. The Defendant, American Honda Motor Co., Inc., has a national Lemon Arbitration program called NCDS, which does not meet all the parameters of Section 1793.22 of the California Civil Code. The Court found that there is a triable issue of fact as to whether the NCDS program meets all the parameters, and therefore the Defendant's defenses to non-willful civil penalties are not waived.

The Court also noted that the existence of a substantially-compliant program is not a defense to a willful violation, and that the Plaintiff may pursue a willful civil penalty pursuant to Section 1794(c) regardless of the Defendant's national Lemon Arbitration program.

The Court granted the Defendant's request for judicial notice, which sought to have the National Center for Dispute Settlement's Automotive Warranty Disputes FAQs taken judicially notice.

The Court's ruling is based on the following facts: the Defendant's collision mitigation system contains a defect, the Plaintiff alleges that the Defendant failed to repair the defect despite three repair attempts, and the Defendant does not have a California-certified Lemon Arbitration program.

The Court's decision is significant because it clarifies the requirements for a manufacturer to have a substantially-compliant Lemon Arbitration program and the defenses available to a manufacturer in a Lemon Law case.
