I. BACKGROUND¿¿ 
¿¿ 
A. Factual¿¿ 
On November 29, 2023, Plaintiff, Steven J.
Saporito, individually and as Trustee of The Steven J. Saporito Revocable Trust
dated April 23, 2003 (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Defendants,
William J. Martin, an individual Flagstar Bank, FSB, a business entity form
unknown, New York Community Bancorp, Inc., and DOES 1 through 25. The complaint
alleges causes of action for: (1) Partition by Sale
of Real Property; (2) Accounting; (3) Constructive Trust; and (4) Declaratory
Relief. 
 
On February 20, 2024,
Defendant and Cross-Complainant, William J. Martin, filed a cross-complaint
alleging claims for: (1) Breach of Express Contract; (2) Breach of Implied
Contract; (3) Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress; (4) Negligent
Infliction of Emotional Distress; and (5) Declaratory Relief. 
 
On June 14, 2024,
Plaintiff propounded Form Interrogatories, Set One and Form Interrogatories,
Set Two on Defendant Martin. Responses were due by July 17, 2024. Despite
Plaintiff’s counsel requesting responses from Defendant Martin’s counsel,
Steven Stolar (“Stolar” on August 7, 2024, September 9, 2024, and September 16,
2024, Defendant Martin has failed to respond to discovery. Plaintiff states
that although Defendant Martin’s counsel, Stolar, addressed other issues raised
in Plaintiff’s counsel’s September 9, 2024 email, Stolar has yet to address any
of the requests that discovery responses be provided or otherwise promise
discovery responses. Therefore, Plaintiff has brought this motion to compel
initial responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One and Set Two. 
 
B. Procedural¿¿ 
            On October 10, 2024, Plaintiff filed his Motion to Compel
Responses Form Interrogatories, Set One and Set Two. To date, no opposition
briefs have been filed. On November 1, 2024, Plaintiff filed notices of
non-opposition. On November 8, 2024, the Court heard several other discovery
motions which were also unopposed by the Defendant.
 
II. ANALYSIS 
 
A.   
Legal
Standard 
 
A party must respond to
interrogatories within 30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260,
subd. (a).) If a party to whom interrogatories are directed does not provide
timely responses, the requesting party may move for an order compelling responses
to the discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (b).) The party also
waives the right to make any objections, including one based on privilege or
work-product protection. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).) There is no
time limit for a motion to compel responses to interrogatories other than the
cut-off on hearing discovery motions 15 days before trial. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2024.020, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., 2030.290.) No meet and confer efforts are
required before filing a motion to compel responses to the discovery. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2030.290; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific
Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411 (“Sinaiko”).)

B.   
Discussion 
¿ 
Here, because Defendant Martin has failed to comply with discovery
by failing to serve timely responses to Plaintiff’s propounded discovery,
Plaintiff’s Motions to Compel Initial Responses, without objection to Form
Interrogatories, Set One and Set Two are GRANTED. 
C.   
Sanctions 
Code of Civil Procedure
section 2023.030, subdivision (a) provides, in pertinent part, that the court
may impose a monetary sanction on a party engaging in the misuse of the
discovery process to pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees,
incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct. A misuse of the discovery
process includes failing to respond or submit to an authorized method of
discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (d).)¿¿ 
 
Here, because this court has GRANTED Plaintiff’s
Motion to Compel Initial Responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One and Set Two,
this court notes that it will by denying sanctions at this time, without
prejudice, to be sought again if Defendant Martin seeks relief from waiver of
objections. 
 
III.
CONCLUSION 
 
            For the foregoing reasons, this
court GRANTS Plaintiff’s motions. Plaintiff’s requests for monetary sanctions
are DENIED without prejudice, to be asserted again if Defendant Martin seeks
relief from waiver.  
 
            Plaintiff is ordered to provide
notice.
