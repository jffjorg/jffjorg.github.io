And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to compel defendant William J. Martin's responses to form interrogatories, sets one and two. The defendant failed to respond to the plaintiff's discovery requests despite repeated requests. The judge also denied the plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions without prejudice, meaning the plaintiff can seek sanctions again if the defendant seeks relief from waiving objections. The plaintiff is ordered to provide notice.
