And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the plaintiff, Cayden Byrd, and has granted his motion for leave to file a first amended complaint and file a late claim against the County of Los Angeles. The plaintiff, who is a minor, alleges that he suffered injuries due to medical negligence and that his cause of action for medical negligence against the County of Los Angeles did not accrue until Spring of 2024. The court found that the plaintiff's declarations provided sufficient evidence to support his motion and that the County of Los Angeles's arguments were without merit. The court also disagreed with the County's argument that the plaintiff's mother should have suspected her son's injuries were caused by someone doing something wrong in January 2022. The court's ruling is tentative and is subject to change after the hearing on November 12, 2024.
