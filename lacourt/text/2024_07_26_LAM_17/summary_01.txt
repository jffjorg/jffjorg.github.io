And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling sustaining Defendant Arriaga USA, Inc.'s demurrer to Plaintiffs' first amended complaint. The Plaintiffs failed to plead sufficient facts to support their claims against Arriaga USA, Inc. because they did not identify any specific products that they allegedly may have been exposed to. The court relied on the Bockrath v. Aldrich Chemical Co., Inc. case, which requires plaintiffs to plead specific facts about the products they were exposed to and how they caused their injuries. Since the Plaintiffs did not meet this standard, the court granted Arriaga USA, Inc.'s demurrer and gave the Plaintiffs 15 days to amend their complaint.
