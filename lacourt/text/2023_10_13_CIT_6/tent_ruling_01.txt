  Case Number:  22PSCV01039    Hearing Date:   October 13, 2023    Dept:  6 Gentle Carman Auto v. Euro M Tech Transmissions, et al.Plaintiff  Gentle Carman Auto’s Request for Entry of Default Judgment Defendants: Euro M Tech Transmissions, a California Corporation,  and Surong Jiang, an individual  TENTATIVE RULING Plaintiff's Request for Default Judgment is DENIED without prejudice.  BACKGROUND This is a breach of contract case. On September  13, 2022, Plaintiff Gentle Carman Auto, a California Corporation (Plaintiff),  filed this action against Defendants Euro M Tech Transmissions, a California  Corporation (Euro), Surong Jiang, an individual (Jiang) (collectively,  Defendants), and Does 1 to 10. On January 26, 2023, Plaintiffs filed the  operative First Amended Complaint (FAC), alleging causes of action for breach  of contract and conversion. Default was entered against Defendants on March 3,  2023. Plaintiff filed a request for entry of default judgment on August 22,  2023. In the FAC, Plaintiff alleges as  follows: Plaintiff is a licensed used car dealer. Jiang is Euro’s owner and  managing officer. On or around July 14, 2021, Plaintiff contacted JIANG for  repair of a 2018 BMV 530E. JIANG quoted Plaintiff $4,800 for the repair.  Plaintiff paid $4,800 to JIANG's personal account for the repair. The said BMV  has been in EURO from July 2021. On September 24,2021, Plaintiff contacted  JIANG in regards to a 2015 Maserati. JIANG quoted Plaintiff $3,500 for the  repair. The said Maserati has been in EURO from September 2021. Plaintiff made  numerous inquiries about the repairs, and each time, JIANG would make up some  excuses.  LEGAL  STANDARD Code of Civil Procedure section 585  permits entry of a default judgment after a party has failed to timely respond  or appear. (Code Civ. Proc., § 585.) A party seeking judgment on the default by  the court must file a Request for Court Judgment, and: (1) a brief summary of  the case; (2) declarations or other admissible evidence in support of the  judgment requested; (3) interest computations as necessary; (4) a memorandum of  costs and disbursements; (5) a proposed form of judgment; (6) a dismissal of  all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application for separate  judgment under Code of Civil Procedure section 579, supported by a showing of  grounds for each judgment; (7) exhibits as necessary; and (8) a request for  attorneys’ fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties. (Cal.  Rules of Court, rule 3.1800.)   ANALYSIS Plaintiff seeks default judgment against  Defendants in the total amount of $48,873.00, comprised solely of $48,873.00 in  damages. The Court finds that Plaintiff’s request for entry of default judgment  contains some issues that need to be addressed. First, the damage calculations  do not match the allegations of the FAC. Plaintiff contends having paid  $8,873.00 to Jiang’s personal account for repairs to the two vehicles at issue.  (Hou Decl., ¶ 12, Ex. 2.) However, the FAC only alleges Plaintiff having paid  $4500 to Jiang for one of the vehicles. (FAC, ¶ 14.) The FAC mentions having  been quoted $3500 to repair the other vehicle, but contains no allegations that  Plaintiff actually paid that amount to Jiang or Euro. (See FAC, ¶¶  9-10, 13.) These price quotes also do not match the amounts Plaintiff appears  to have actually paid to Jiang. (Hou Decl., ¶ 12, Ex. 2.) Even assuming  Plaintiff did pay the price quotes, $8,873.00 exceeds the $8,000.00 in repairs  as alleged in the FAC.  There are additional discrepancies with the proof of payments. First,  Hou declares and the FAC alleges that on or around July 14, 2021, Jiang quoted  $4,800 for the repair of the 2018 BMW 530e and that Plaintiff paid Jiang for  the repair but the BMV [sic] has been in Euro from July 2021. However, the  invoice attached to the declaration is dated 12/13/21 for repair to the 2018 BMW  530e. (Hou Decl., ¶ 6, Ex. 1.) Thus, the dates do not appear to coincide. Moreover,  Hou’s declaration and the FAC seem to allege that Plaintiff paid for the 2018 BMW  repairs prior to July 2021, but the declaration states the first payment was  made 9/15/21, although it does not specify what the payment was for. Yet, the  invoice, dated 12/13/21, shows a total due of $4,800, which shows that no  payments were received by 12/13/21 for the 2018 BMW.  Second, paragraph 12 of Hou’s declaration states that a payment of  $700 was paid to Jiang on 9/27/21. (Hou Decl., ¶ 12.) Hou attaches a screenshot  of a $700 payment, without a date, but it states for 2014 Maserati 088720. (Hou  Decl., Ex. 2, p. 1.) Thus, the Court cannot determine when Plaintiff made  payments for the BMW or when Plaintiff made payments for the Maserati.  Moreover, as the Court previously noted  in its May 1, 2023 order denying Plaintiff’s request for entry of default  judgment without prejudice, it is unclear how Jiang is personally liable for  the wrongful retention of Plaintiff’s vehicles. The FAC contains no alter ego  allegations against the Defendants. (FAC, ¶¶ 15, 19.) It is not enough for  Jiang to have been the owner and manager of Euro to impose joint liability here.  (FAC, ¶ 4.) “There are two standard requirements for finding alter ego (and  single business enterprise) liability: ‘ ‘(1) that there be such unity of  interest and ownership that the separate personalities of the corporation and  the individual no longer exist and (2) that, if the acts are treated as those  of the corporation alone, an inequitable result will follow.’ ‘ [Citation.] The  doctrine generally applies when upholding the defendant's corporate form will  work an injustice to an innocent plaintiff. [Citation.]” (LSREF2 Clover Prop. 4, LLC v. Festival Retail Fund 1, LP  (2016) 3 Cal.App.5th 1067, 1081.) Without the alter ego liability, it is  unclear how Jiang and Euro could both be in possession of Plaintiff’s vehicles  at the same time.  Finally, Plaintiff has not provided any  evidence to support its claim for $40,000 in lost profits.  CONCLUSION Based on the foregoing, the Court DENIES  Plaintiff’s request for entry of default judgment without prejudice.
