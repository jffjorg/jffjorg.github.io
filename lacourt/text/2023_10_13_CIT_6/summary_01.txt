And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the Plaintiff's request for entry of default judgment without prejudice. The case is a breach of contract dispute between the Plaintiff, Gentle Carman Auto, and the Defendants, Euro M Tech Transmissions and Surong Jiang. The Plaintiff had filed a request for entry of default judgment, but the Judge found that the Plaintiff's case contains several issues that need to be addressed. Specifically, the Judge noted that the damage calculations do not match the allegations in the First Amended Complaint, and that there are discrepancies in the proof of payments. Additionally, the Judge found that it is unclear how Jiang is personally liable for the wrongful retention of the Plaintiff's vehicles, and that the Plaintiff has not provided any evidence to support its claim for lost profits. The Judge ordered that the Plaintiff's request for entry of default judgment be denied without prejudice, meaning that the Plaintiff may re-file the request if it can address the issues identified by the Judge.
