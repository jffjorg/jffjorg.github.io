Motion for Further Instructions and Approval of Interim Fees and Costs.”

P. Beatty’s (“the Receiver”) Motion for Further Instructions and Approval of
Interim Fees and Costs (“Receiver Motion”) has not yet been filed,
but is also scheduled for hearing in this department on April 12, 2024, at 9:00
a.m.; 
3. WHEREAS the Receiver has requested that
the hearings regarding the Former Receiver Application and Receiver Motion,
currently scheduled for April 12, 2024 be continued to May 3, 2024, at 9:00
a.m., or such other date as is convenient for the Court as the Receiver is
currently on medical leave until approximately April 1, 2024.
