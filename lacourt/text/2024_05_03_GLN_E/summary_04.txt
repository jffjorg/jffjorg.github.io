Here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge's tentative ruling is that the plaintiff's motion to compel responses to interrogatories is denied as moot because the defendant has served responses to the special and form interrogatories, set one. However, the issue of sanctions is not moot since the responses were provided after the filing of this motion. The court will hear from the parties regarding sanctions.
