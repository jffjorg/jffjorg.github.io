Case No. 23GDCV02452
Trial Date: UNSET
Case Name: WENDERSON ALEXANDRINO, an individual; v. FCA US LLC, a Delaware
Limited Liability Company, and DOES 1-10, inclusive
TENTATIVE
RULING – COMPEL RESPONSES 
BACKGROUND
Plaintiff, Wenderson Alexandrino, filed a Complaint on 11/17/2023
alleging three causes of action for: (1) Violation of Song-Beverly Act – Breach
of Express Warranty; (2) Violation of Song-Beverly Act – Breach of Implied
Warranty; and (3) Violation of the Song-Beverly Act Section 1793.2.
 
RELIEF REQUESTED¿ 
Plaintiff, Wenderson Alexandrino, moves for an order to compel responses,
without objections, to Plaintiff’s Form and Special Interrogatories, Set One. Plaintiff’s
Interrogatories were initially served and propounded on Defendant by Plaintiff
on January 9, 2024.
 
This Motion is made pursuant to
California Code of Civil Procedure, sections 2033.280, subdivision (a), and
2033.280, subdivision (b), on the grounds that Defendant FCA US LLC
(“Defendant”) has failed to provide any responses to Plaintiff’s
Interrogatories, which seek information directly relevant to their claims under
the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act. Thus, Plaintiff seeks an order
compelling Defendant to produce responses, without objections, within 10
calendar days of the Court’s order.

LEGAL STANDARD –
COMPEL RESPONSES, INTERROGATORIES
Within 30 days after service of interrogatories, the party to whom the
interrogatories are propounded shall serve the original of the response to them
on the propounding party, unless on motion of the propounding party the court
has shortened the time for response, or unless on motion of the responding
party the court has extended the time for response. (CCP 2030.260(a).)
If a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails
to serve a timely response, the party propounding the interrogatories may move
for an order compelling response to the interrogatories. (CCP § 2030.290(b).)
“The party to whom the interrogatories are directed
waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings under Section
2030.230, as well as any objection to the interrogatories, including one based
on privilege or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4 (commencing
with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that party from this
waiver on its determination that both of the following conditions are
satisfied: (1) The party has subsequently served a response that is in
substantial compliance with Sections 2030.210, 2030.220, 2030.230, and
2030.240. (2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response was the result of
mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.” (CCP § 2030.290(a).)
Unlike a motion to compel further responses, a motion
to compel responses is not subject to a 45-day time limit, and the propounding
party does not have to demonstrate either good cause or that it satisfied a
“meet and confer” requirement. (Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v.
Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 404
citing Weil and Brown, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (The
Rutter Group 2006) ¶¶8:1137 to 8:1144, pp. 8F-59 to 8F-60, ¶¶ 8:1483 to 8:1489,
pp. 8H-29 to hH-30 (Weil & Brown).)
 
TENTATIVE RULING 
Plaintiff lumped what should have been two motions
into one motion.
Plaintiff has filed one motion seeking to compel
responses to special interrogatories and form interrogatories, set one. This
motion should have been two motions with two separate hearing reservations and two
separate filing fees. Combining multiple motions under the guise of one motion
with one hearing reservation manipulates the Court Reservation System and
unfairly jumps ahead of other litigants. Moreover, combining motions to avoid
payment of separate filing fees deprives the Court of filing fees it is otherwise
entitled to collect. “[P]ayment
of filing fees is both mandatory and jurisdictional.”  (Hu vs. Silgan Containers Corp. (1999)
70 Cal. App. 4th 1261, 1269.) 

If Plaintiff wants these two motions to be heard, it
can pay the additional filing fee to the Court before the hearing and show
proof of payment of the additional filing fee before the hearing.
Alternatively, Plaintiff is welcome to request the
Court to advance and continue the instant hearing to a date that the other
motion will be scheduled for; however, Plaintiff is warned that all motions
must provide sufficient notice to Defendant. Further, the Plaintiff would need
to clarify which discovery method the instant motion will pertain to on the
future hearing date, i.e., will the instant motion pertain to special
interrogatories or form interrogatories. Presumably, the other motion will
clearly indicate what individual discovery method it pertains to.
On
January 9, 2024, Plaintiff served Special and Form Interrogatories, Set One
(Sogoyan Decl. ¶8.) Plaintiff’s counsel emailed Defendant’s counsel a meet and
confer on March 11, 2024 about overdue responses and how objections were
waived. (Sogoyan Decl. ¶14.) As of the date of Plaintiff’s counsel’s
declaration contained in Plaintiff’s motion [March 22, 2024], Plaintiff’s
counsel has not received responses. (Sogoyan Decl. ¶16.)

Defendant’s
counsel submitted an untimely Opposition on 4/24/2024. The Court will utilize
its discretion and consider the untimely Opposition.
 
In Opposition,
Defendant’s counsel [Vanessa Van Dao] states that responses were served to the
instant discovery requests on April 22, 2024. [Confusingly, although Dao states
that responses were served on April 22, 2024, Exhibit A attached to the
Opposition appears to show that responses were served on April 10, 2024.]
Either way, responses were served after the instant motion was filed on March
22, 2024.
 
Defendant has a
section in its Opposition discussing the reason for its untimely responses and
how it can have relief from waiver of objections because its served responses
that were substantially compliant, and its failure to timely respond was due to
mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. Defendant appears to be under the
assumption that it can be relieved from waiver of objections based on its
Opposition; however, this is incorrect. Whether or not Defendant is relieved
from its waiver of objections, Defendant would have to file a separate motion
for relief from waiver of objections under CCP §2030.290(a)(1)-(2).
 
Assuming Plaintiff
pays the additional filing fee before the hearing and these two motions are actually
heard, since Defendant has served responses to special and form
interrogatories, set one, Plaintiff’s motions are DENIED as moot; however, the
issue of sanctions is not moot since the responses were provided after the
filing of this motion.
 
 
Sanctions - Interrogatories
CCP § 2030.290 states in relevant part:
The court shall
impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010)
against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a
motion to compel a response to interrogatories, unless it finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.
 
(CCP § 2030.290(c).)
 
“The court may award sanctions under the Discovery Act
in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery, even though no
opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to the motion was withdrawn,
or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party after the motion
was filed.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1348(a).) 
Sanctions Ruling


The Court will
hear from the parties regarding sanctions.
