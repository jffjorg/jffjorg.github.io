Horn (2012) 208 Cal.App.4th 641, 652, where the Court of Appeal noted that “we do not accept Horn’s argument that the lodestar amount calculated by the trial court was not reasonable and should be reversed. As stated above, the trial court used the reasonable rates in the local community as a basis for its award. It was also presented with Murphy’s time records and billing statements to show the work done. That Murphy could have provided more detailed billing records and the precise amount it was paid for its services does not render the trial court’s determination an abuse of discretion.”
