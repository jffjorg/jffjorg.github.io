And here is a brief English text summarizing the Tentative Ruling:

The Judge has issued a Tentative Ruling granting FCA's Motion for Terminating Sanctions against Plaintiff Alvin Tate. The ruling comes after FCA alleged that Plaintiff's counsel, Joseph Daniel Davis, repeatedly failed to comply with Court orders regarding discovery. The Court found that Davis's actions were willful and caused detriment to FCA, and that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules. As a result, the Court orders the action to be dismissed. The ruling requires FCA to file and serve a proposed judgment of dismissal within 10 days of the date of the order.
