[1] 
At various times, the court refers to Defendants City and LAPD collectively
as the City or Defendants. The parties generally refer to the two Defendants
interchangeably.   


[2] The notice of motion also
identifies several additional grounds for a new trial.  However, because
Plaintiff does not submit any argument or evidence in support of the other
statutory bases, the court addresses Plaintiff’s “irregularity in proceedings”
argument in the disposition of this motion. 
 


[3] Because Palacios’s retaliation
claim was predicated upon the existence of an ostensible agency between LAPRAAC
and the City, the retaliation claim fails because the court has concluded there
is no triable issue on the existence of such an agency relationship.
