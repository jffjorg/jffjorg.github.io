And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion to quash service of summons filed by defendants Malibu Psychic Spiritual Center, Inc., Alexus Miller, Andrew Adams, Carol Stanton, and Diane Ray. The plaintiff, Malibu Psychic, a d.b.a. of George Merino, and George Merino, filed a Verified First Amended Complaint against the defendants on July 18, 2024. The defendants argue that they were not properly served with the summons and complaint.

The judge notes that the proof of service forms and the attached declaration state that the complaint was filed, but the amended complaint was not properly served. The judge further notes that the defendants' process server, Alexandra R. Rista, submitted a declaration stating that she served Miller with process, but Miller and her cousin Jennifer Dimitro submitted a declaration stating that Rista did not personally serve Miller.

The judge finds that the presumption of proper service is rebutted as to Adams, Stanton, and Ray, and grants the motion to quash as to these defendants. The judge also finds that the presumption of proper service is rebutted as to Miller and will hold an evidentiary hearing to determine whether Miller was personally served.

The judge denies the motion to quash as to Malibu Psychic Spiritual Center, Inc., finding that Rista attached a declaration of diligence indicating she attempted personal service on the company, and that the company was served by substitute service.

The judge sets a hearing date for the evidentiary hearing on Alexus Miller's service and allocates 45 minutes to each side to cross-examine witnesses. The judge also requires the parties to submit declarations and exhibits in a three-ring notebook at least 5 court days in advance of the hearing.
