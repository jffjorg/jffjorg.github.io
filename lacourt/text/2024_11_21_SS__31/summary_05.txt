And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering the plaintiff's unconscionability challenge to the arbitration agreement, but notes that the challenge is not specifically directed at the delegation clause. According to the judge, if the challenge is to the agreement as a whole, the delegation clause will be severed and enforced by the arbitrator, whereas if the challenge is specifically to the delegation clause, the court must first determine its enforceability before delegating the issue to the arbitrator. The judge cites Malone v. Superior Ct. (2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 1551, 1559–60 and Rent-A-Center, supra, 561 U.S. at p. 70 to support this analysis.
