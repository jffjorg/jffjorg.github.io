[1] Plaintiff asserts his
unconscionability challenge as to the agreement to arbitrate and not to the
delegation clause specifically.  (See Malone
v. Superior Ct. (2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 1551, 1559–60 citing (Rent-A-Center,
supra, 561 U.S. at p. 70 [“when a party is claiming that an
arbitration agreement is unenforceable, it is important to determine whether
the party is making a specific challenge to the enforceability of the
delegation clause or is simply arguing that the agreement as a whole is unenforceable.
If the party's challenge is directed to the agreement as a whole--even if it
applies equally to the delegation clause--the delegation clause is severed out
and enforced; thus, the arbitrator, not the court, will determine whether the
agreement is enforceable.  [¶] In
contrast, if the party is making a specific challenge to the delegation clause,
the court must determine whether the delegation clause itself may be enforced
(and can only delegate the general issue of enforceability to the arbitrator if
it first determines the delegation clause is enforceable).”].)
