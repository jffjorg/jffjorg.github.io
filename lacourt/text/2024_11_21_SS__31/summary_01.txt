And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

Judge Kerry Bensinger has issued a tentative ruling denying the Plaintiffs' Motion for a New Trial after Summary Judgment. The case involves allegations that the City of Los Angeles and the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) were negligent in their oversight of the Los Angeles Police Revolver and Athletic Club (LAPRAAC), a private entity that sold firearms and police equipment. The Plaintiffs, all former LAPD officers, purchased firearms from LAPRAAC between 2018 and 2020, but were later informed that their firearms were reported stolen. The Plaintiffs alleged that LAPRAAC was the ostensible agent of the City or LAPD, and that the City or LAPD was negligent in their oversight of LAPRAAC's firearms sales.

The court previously granted the City's motions for summary judgment, finding that LAPRAAC was not the City's nor the LAPD's ostensible agent for the sale of firearms. The Plaintiffs argue that the court improperly shifted the burden to them to prove an ostensible agency relationship, but the court finds that the City met its initial burden to show no triable issue of material fact existed. The court also finds that the Plaintiffs failed to make a prima facie showing of an ostensible agency relationship and that their belief in such a relationship was unreasonable as a matter of law.

The court concludes that the Motion for a New Trial is denied, and orders the Defendant to give notice.
