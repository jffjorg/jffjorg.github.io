And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving Palacios, who brought a retaliation claim against the City and the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD). Palacios's claim was based on an alleged ostensible agency relationship between the Los Angeles Police Relief Association Auxiliary Committee (LAPRAAC) and the City. However, the judge has concluded that there is no triable issue on the existence of such an agency relationship, and therefore the retaliation claim fails. The judge is only addressing Palacios's "irregularity in proceedings" argument in the disposition of this motion, as Palacios did not provide any argument or evidence in support of other statutory bases for a new trial.
