And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for judgment on the pleadings for setting up a case trial schedule. The judge finds that the motion is procedurally anomalous and improper, as it seeks judgment on the pleadings without any defendants having appeared in the action. The judge notes that the remaining defendants, Beck, Delarocha, and Ibanks, have not appeared in the action. The judge sustains the demurrer to the First Amended Complaint and grants judgment in favor of the City, Hinchman, Moore, and Bryant on the Second Cause of Action for Violation of the United States Constitution. The judge orders the clerk of the court to give notice of the ruling.
