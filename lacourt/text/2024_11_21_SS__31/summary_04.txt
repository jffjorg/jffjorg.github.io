And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the motion by Defendant Casey's Cars, Inc. to compel arbitration and stay all proceedings in this action. The Plaintiff, Lorraine Flores, alleges that the Defendant made false representations about the condition of a used 2020 Land Rover Range Rover she purchased from them. The Plaintiff claims that the vehicle required $4,509.19 in repairs shortly after purchase, which the Defendant declined to cover.

The Defendant argues that the arbitration clause in the purchase agreement is valid and should be enforced. The Plaintiff argues that certain terms in the agreement are unconscionable.

The court finds that the arbitration clause is valid and that the Plaintiff signed an agreement to commit questions of arbitrability to the arbitrator. The court therefore grants the Defendant's motion to compel arbitration and stay all proceedings. The action is stayed pending the conclusion of the arbitration.

The court sets a post-arbitration status conference for August 21, 2025, at 9:00 a.m. The Defendant is to give notice.
