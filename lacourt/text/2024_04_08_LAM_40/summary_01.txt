Plaintiff:
  - Name: Joshua Coffman
  - Name: Sunnybyte, LLC

Defendants:
  - Name: Ross Legal Corporation, Inc.

Basis for Tentative Ruling:

Ruling:

  - Demurrer to Sixth Cause of Action (Violations of Civil Code Section 1770(a)(5)): SUSTAINED
  - Motion to Strike: GRANTED

Reasoning:
  - Demurrer to Fourth Cause of Action: The FAC sufficiently alleges concealment of the intent to bill additional fees, and the reliance element is not correctly construed by the moving papers.
  - Demurrer to Sixth Cause of Action: The legal services alleged in the FAC do not fall within the plain language of the CLRA "services" contemplated at section 1770, subdivision (a)(5).
  - Motion to Strike: The Complaint fails to allege actual fraud, and the FAC does not show on its face that any limitations period has run.

Next Steps:
  - Plaintiffs may amend the FAC to address the deficiencies identified in the demurrer.
  - The Court will set a date for a hearing on the motion to strike.
