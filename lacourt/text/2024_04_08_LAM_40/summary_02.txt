  - Summary adjudication of the Complaint's first cause of action is thus DENIED.

Summary of the tentative ruling:

The court has denied plaintiff Waqar Hashim's motion for summary adjudication of the Complaint's first and second causes of action. The court found that the plaintiff failed to carry his burden on summary adjudication of the Complaint's first cause of action, which alleges failure to pay wages in violation of Cal. Labor Code § 201 et seq. The court also found that liability on the second cause of action, which alleges unfair business practices in violation of Cal. Business & Professions Code § 17200, is derivative of liability on the first cause of action. The court therefore denied summary adjudication of both causes of action.
