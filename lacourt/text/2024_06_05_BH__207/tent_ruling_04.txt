[1] The Court notes that Overturf has filed a Motion for
Continuance to Extend Time to file Reply and to Continue Hearing Date scheduled
for hearing on August 1, 2024.  Without
addressing the merits of that motion, Overturf seeks the extension and
continuance to retain counsel.  


[2] The Court of Appeal’s rationale in Pulte Homes was
that “[i]f the judgment were vacated, it would be the duty of the court
immediately to render another judgment of like effect, and the defendants,
still being in default, could not be heard in opposition thereto[.]”  (Pulte Homes Corp., supra, 2
Cal.App.5th 267 at p. 273; but see Schwab, supra, 114 Cal.App.4th at p.
1320 [“A prematurely entered default is invalid, and any judgment entered after
an invalid default is also invalid”], disapproved on other grounds by Sass
v. Cohen (2020) 10 Cal.5th 861.)   
 


[3] Under Code of Civil Procedure section 473, relief
from a default judgment based upon an attorney’s affidavit of fault requires a
trial court to also vacate the underlying entry of default.  (See Sugasawara v. Newland, supra, 27
Cal.App.4th at pp. 295-296.)
 


[4] Overturf filed a Substitution of Attorney-Civil on
April 29, 2024.  According to the
substitution, Overturf is now representing himself.
