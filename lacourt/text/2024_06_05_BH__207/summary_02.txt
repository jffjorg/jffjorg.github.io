The tentative ruling discusses the service of process in a judicial proceeding in the United Kingdom. The UK has declared that it will not object to service of process being made in the UK by a competent person, such as a solicitor. The ruling also notes that while a court may not rely on unpublished California cases, it is permissible to cite to unpublished federal cases as persuasive authority. The ruling is based on a California court's decision in Landmark Screens, LLC v. Morgan, Lewis & Bockius, LLP.
