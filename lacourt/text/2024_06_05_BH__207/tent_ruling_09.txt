[1] “A demurrer shall distinctly specify the grounds upon
which any of the objections to the complaint, cross-complaint, or answer are taken.
Unless it does so, it may be disregarded.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 430.60.)  Although
the Memorandum of Points and Authorities indicates that the demurrer “is
directed to all causes of action” (Demurrer at p. 6), the Demurrer itself only lists
the first three causes of action (Demurrer at p. 3.)  Therefore, the Court finds that Defendants
have only demurred to the first three causes of action.  (See also California Rules of Court, rule
3.1320.)
