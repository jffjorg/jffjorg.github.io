```

And here is the English text summary of the tentative ruling:

The Court has reviewed the complaint and demurrer filed by the defendants, and has concluded that the plaintiff's first cause of action for professional negligence is barred by the statute of limitations, as the plaintiff did not file the lawsuit until December 28, 2023, more than three years after the alleged injury occurred. The court has also concluded that the plaintiff's second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth causes of action are not barred by the statute of limitations, as they are based on intentional misconduct rather than professional negligence. The court has denied the plaintiff's request for leave to amend the complaint to add additional facts and law regarding the issue of her lack of ability to legally consent to the sexual conduct at issue.
