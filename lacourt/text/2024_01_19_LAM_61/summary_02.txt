And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied LA Laser Center, PC's motion to strike the prayer for punitive damages from the complaint filed by Manuel Ruiz. The motion was based on the argument that the prayer for punitive damages was not supported by the facts alleged in the complaint. However, the Judge found that the allegations in the complaint support a conclusion that the Defendant "willfully and consciously retaliated against [Plaintiff], in violation of Colucci's right to complain of discrimination." As a result, the motion is denied.
