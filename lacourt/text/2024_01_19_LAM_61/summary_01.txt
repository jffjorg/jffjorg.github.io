This tentative ruling addresses Plaintiff Mi in Fashion, Inc.'s motions to compel responses to form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and requests for production, as well as to deem matters admitted against Defendants Enk Apparel, Inc. and Jung Y. Kim. The motions were filed on August 31, 2023, with responses due by October 2, 2023. Although responses were not provided, the Defendants argued that the motions are moot with respect to the requests for admission and that Plaintiff's attorney, Chan Yong Jeong, was not authorized to serve the motions. The Judge granted the motions to compel responses to form and special interrogatories, and requests for production, but denied them as moot with respect to the requests for admission. The Judge also denied Plaintiff's request for sanctions, finding that meet and confer efforts could have alleviated the necessity of the present motions.
