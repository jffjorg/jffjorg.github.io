The Judge explained that Culkin did not provide any new information or legal arguments that would justify changing the earlier decision.

### English Text Summary
The court has issued a tentative ruling denying plaintiff Diana Culkin's motion for reconsideration of the court's order granting defendant Inco Builders' ex parte application to expunge lis pendens. The court found that Culkin's motion was timely, but she failed to identify any new or different facts, circumstances, or law that would justify reconsideration of the court's prior order. Additionally, Culkin failed to provide grounds for reconsideration in an affidavit as required by Code of Civil Procedure section 1008. The court denied Culkin's motion without prejudice. The case involves a wrongful foreclosure action filed by Culkin against Inco Builders and other defendants, and the court has previously granted Inco Builders' motion to expunge lis pendens. The court's ruling is based on the application of Code of Civil Procedure section 1008, which governs motions for reconsideration.
