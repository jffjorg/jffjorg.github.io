And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying plaintiff Diana Culkin's motion for reconsideration of the court's order granting Inco Builders' ex parte application to expunge lis pendens. The court finds that Culkin's motion is timely, but fails to identify any new or different facts, circumstances, or law that justify reconsideration of the court's prior order. The court also notes that Culkin fails to provide the required grounds for reconsideration in an affidavit. Therefore, the court denies Culkin's motion without prejudice.
