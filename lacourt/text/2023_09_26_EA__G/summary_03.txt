And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling grants Flagship Credit Acceptance LLC's application for a writ of possession against Robert W. Keeler. The case involves a claim and delivery action related to a 2021 Dodge Challenger, which Keeler purchased from John Elways Claremont CDJR and financed through an agreement with Flagship. Flagship alleges that Keeler failed to make payments on June 23, 2023, and currently owes a balance of $51,833.38. The court finds that Flagship followed the statutory requirements for issuing a writ of possession and demonstrates a right to immediate possession of the vehicle, which remains in Keeler's possession. The court grants the application and orders Keeler to turn over the vehicle to Flagship.
