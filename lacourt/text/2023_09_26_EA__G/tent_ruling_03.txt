for Writ of Possession
Respondent: NO OPPOSITION
TENTATIVE RULING
Plaintiff Flagship Credit Acceptance LLC’s Application
for Writ of Possession is GRANTED.
BACKGROUND
This
is a claim and delivery action. Defendant Robert W. Keeler purchased a 2021
Dodge Challenger from John Elways Claremont CDJR (John Elways) pursuant to a
financing agreement. Subsequently, John Elways assigned the financing agreement
to Plaintiff Flagship Credit Acceptance LLC (Flagship). Flagship then alleges
Keeler failed to make payments due on June 23, 2023, and currently owes a
balance of $51,833.38.
On May
5, 2023, Flagship filed a complaint against Keeler and Does 1-10, alleging the
following causes of action: (1) claim and delivery of personal property and (2)
money on a contract. On May 21, Flagship’s process server personally served
Keeler in Glendora.
On May
23, 2023, Flagship filed the present application. A hearing on the application
is set for September 26, with a case management conference on October 4.
ANALYSIS
Flagship
moves the court for a writ of possession against Keeler with regards to a 2021
Dodge Challenger valued at $30,648. For the following reasons, the court GRANTS
Flagship’s application.
Legal
Standard
“California’s
claim and delivery law (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 511.010-516.050) authorizes the
issuance of a prejudgment writ of possession for specific personal property.” (Sea
Rail Truckloads, Inc. v. Pullman, Inc. (1982) 131 Cal.App.3d 511, 514.)
“Except as otherwise provided this section, no writ shall be issued under this
chapter except after a hearing on a noticed motion.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
512.020, subd. (a).) Prior to the hearing, applicant must serve respondent with
(1) a copy of the summons and complaint, (2) a notice of application and
hearing, and (3) a copy of the application and any affidavit in support
thereof. (Code Civ. Proc., § 512.030, subd. (a).)
The
application for writ of possession must be executed under oath and include (1)
a “showing of the basis of the plaintiff’s claim and that the plaintiff is
entitled to possession of the property claimed” as well as a copy of the
written instrument if the basis of the claim is a written instrument, (2) a
“showing that the property is wrongfully detained by the defendant,” (3) a
showing of “the manner in which the defendant came into possession of the
property,” (4) a showing of “the reason for the detention,” (5) a particular
description of the property and its value, (6) a statement of the location of
the property, including a showing that there is probable cause to believe the
property is located there if alleged to be within a private place, and (7) a “statement
that the property has not been taken for a tax, assessment, or fine” or “seized
under an execution against the property of the plaintiff[.]” (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 512.010, subd. (b).)
Furthermore,
Code of Civil Procedure section 512.060 provides that a writ of possession
shall issue if the plaintiff meets the undertaking requirements of Code of
Civil Procedure section 515.010 and establishes the probable validity of their
claim to possession of the property. Code of Civil Procedure section 515.010
requires the plaintiff to file an undertaking of at least “twice the value of
the defendant’s interest in the property” with the court before the court
issues any writ of possession, unless the court finds defendants have “no
interest in the property.” “No writ directing the levying officer to enter a
private place to take possession of any property shall be issued unless the
plaintiff has established that there is probable cause to believe that the
property is located there.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 512.060, subd. (b).)
Discussion
In
this case, Flagship moves for a writ of possession of its collateral, described
as follows:
“2021
Dodge Challenger, motor vehicle, Vehicle Identification Number
2C3CDZJG6MH664858, with a value of $30,648.00.”
The
court finds Flagship followed the statutory requirements of Code of Civil
Procedure sections 512.030 and 512.010. Pursuant to the vehicle financing agreement
at issue in this action, Flagship may repossess the vehicle at issue if Keeler
defaults on payments. (Kirkley Decl., ¶ 4, Ex. A, § 3(e).) Keeler failed to
oppose Flagship’s application and is currently in default. Because Flagship demonstrated
a right to immediate possession of the subject vehicle and because the vehicle
remains in Keeler’s possession, Flagship’s undertaking requirement is waived
and the undertaking required by Keeler for redelivery or to stay shall be $30,648
(Flagship’s valuation of the property - Kirkley Decl., ¶ 6.) (See Code
Civ. Proc., § 515.020.)
Accordingly,
Flagship’s application for writ of possession is GRANTED.
CONCLUSION
Based
on the foregoing, the court GRANTS Flagship’s application for a writ of
possession. The following collateral is to be turned over from Defendant Robert
W. Keeler to Plaintiff Flagship Credit Acceptance LLC pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 512.070.
-2021
DODGE CHALLENGER, VIN # 2C3CDZJG6MH664858
Failure
to turn over possession of such property to Flagship may subject Keeler to
being held in contempt of court.
