```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the demurrers filed by Defendants Cherrie Chen, Queenie Chiang, and Far Seng Wu to the Plaintiff's complaint. The court has sustained all of the demurrers with 10 days' leave to amend.

The court has found that the Plaintiff's complaint fails to state a cause of action for breach of written contract, fraud and intentional misrepresentation, breach of fiduciary duties, unjust enrichment, promissory estoppel, breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and breach of implied contract.

The court has also found that the Plaintiff's claims are barred by the statute of limitations, as the alleged breaches of contract and fiduciary duties occurred more than three years before the complaint was filed.

The court has given the Plaintiff 10 days' leave to amend its complaint to address the deficiencies identified in the demurrers.

Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in Markdown format:

**Case Number:** 23PSCV01299
**Hearing Date:** September 26, 2023
**Department:** G
**Defendant:** Cherrie Chen's Demurrer to Plaintiff's Complaint
**Respondent:** NO OPPOSITION (Due 9/7/2023)

**Tentative Ruling:** Defendant Cherrie Chen's Demurrer to Plaintiff's Complaint is SUSTAINED with ten (10) days leave to amend.

**Background:** This is a contractual fraud action. In January 2019, Plaintiffs Oscar Zhang and Aveo, Inc. entered into a written and oral agreement with Defendant Suncity Property Management, LLC (Suncity) and Cherrie Chen. Plaintiffs promised to provide renovation services for a property in Rancho Cucamonga in exchange for $50,000. Plaintiffs began the work in February 2019 and finished on May 15. Plaintiffs filed a complaint against Defendants Chen, Queenie Chiang, Far Seng Wu, Yaqiang Gao, Suncity, Eaglecell Group (Eaglecell), and Does 1-50, alleging various causes of action.

**Analysis:**

* **Breach of Written Contract (First Cause of Action):** Chen's demurrer is SUSTAINED with leave to amend. Plaintiffs failed to adequately allege the existence of a contract.
* **Fraud and Intentional Misrepresentation (Second Cause of Action):** Chen's demurrer is SUSTAINED with leave to amend. Plaintiffs' cause of action accrued in August 2019, which is more than three years before this action was filed.
* **Breach of Fiduciary Duties (Third Cause of Action):** Chen's demurrer is SUSTAINED with leave to amend. Plaintiffs failed to establish the existence of a fiduciary relationship.
* **Unjust Enrichment (Fourth Cause of Action):** Chen's demurrer is SUSTAINED with leave to amend. Plaintiffs failed to allege how Cherrie Chen personally benefited from Plaintiffs' services.
