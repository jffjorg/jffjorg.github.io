```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the demurrers filed by Defendants Cherrie Chen, Queenie Chiang, and Far Seng Wu to the Plaintiff's complaint. The court has sustained all of the demurrers with 10 days' leave to amend.

The court has found that the Plaintiff's complaint fails to state a cause of action for breach of written contract, fraud and intentional misrepresentation, breach of fiduciary duties, unjust enrichment, promissory estoppel, breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and breach of implied contract.

The court has also found that the Plaintiff's claims are barred by the statute of limitations, as the alleged breaches of contract and fiduciary duties occurred more than three years before the complaint was filed.

The court has given the Plaintiff 10 days' leave to amend its complaint to address the deficiencies identified in the demurrers.
