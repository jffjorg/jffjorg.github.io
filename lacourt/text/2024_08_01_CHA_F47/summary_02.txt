And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Court has made a tentative ruling on the demurrer and motion to strike filed by the defendants, Mayra Lisbeth Baldwin and Kirby Baldwin, against the plaintiffs, Antonia Escobedo and Jose Canton. The plaintiffs claim that the defendants orally agreed to take "bare legal title" to the property at 522 Harps Street in San Fernando, California, and that the plaintiffs made the down payment, mortgage payments, property tax payments, and homeowners' insurance payments.

The defendants have challenged the First Amended Complaint on several grounds, including the causes of action for Quiet Title - Resulting Trust, Quiet Title - Constructive Trust, Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress, Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress, and Declaratory Relief. The Court has overruled the demurrer as to the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 5th causes of action, but sustained it as to the 4th cause of action, giving the plaintiffs 30 days to try to cure the defects in their pleadings.

The motion to strike is denied, and the plaintiffs are given the opportunity to file a Second Amended Complaint within 30 days.
