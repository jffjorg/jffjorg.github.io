 Case Number:  23LBCV01987    Hearing Date:   May 14, 2024    Dept:  S27 1.    
Background
Facts
Plaintiff, Christopher Graham filed this action against Defendants, City
of Long Beach, Long Beach Yellow Cab, and Ride Yellow for damages arising out
of an automobile accident.  
 
2.    
Motion
for Leave to Intervene
The City paid Plaintiff workers’
compensation benefits as a result of the injuries that give rise to this
litigation.  The City seeks leave to
intervene.  Labor Code §§3852 and 3853
make clear that an employer against whom a claim for worker’s compensation
damages was made may join in an action against a third party arising out of the
incident for which the worker’s compensation payment was made.  §3850(b) defines “employer” to include the
employer’s insurer.  
 
The motion is unopposed and
granted.  Intervener is ordered to file a
separate copy of the complaint-in-intervention within five days. 
 
Intervener is ordered to give
notice.
