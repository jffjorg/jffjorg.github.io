And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering the defendant's motion to vacate the judgment in a case involving a tenant-landlord dispute. The defendant claims he was confused about the trial date and did not attend the trial, which was held on December 2, 2024. However, the judge is not convinced by the defendant's excuse, noting that the defendant should have cleared up any confusion by contacting the court or plaintiff's counsel. The judge is also concerned that the defendant's motion does not present a meritorious defense that would justify setting aside the judgment. The judge notes that the defendant's answer raises several inconsistencies and inaccuracies, and that the court will not rely on the answer. The judge is sympathetic to the defendant's desire to present his case to the court, but also recognizes the plaintiff's right to a speedy trial and to maintain possession of the premises. The judge will consider the motion at the January 3, 2025 hearing date.
