And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case, continuing the matter to allow for additional information to be provided. The court needs answers to several questions, including whether the named plaintiff had a claim that was settled separately, whether counsel is getting fees for individual claims, and how the lodestar calculation was arrived at. The court is also concerned about the $5000 payment to the named plaintiff, given that other aggrieved employees are receiving about $45. The court notes that the declarations filed by counsel suggest that they spent over 126 hours on the case, but the court is not convinced that the lodestar calculation is reasonable. The court wants to see more information before making a decision on the fee award.
