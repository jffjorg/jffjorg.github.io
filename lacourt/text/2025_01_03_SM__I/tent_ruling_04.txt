 Case Number:  24SMCV05114    Hearing Date:   January 3, 2025    Dept:  I The court is confused. 
Defendant has moved to compel arbitration, and that matter is set for
hearing on January 27, 2025.  The court
does not understand how an arbitration is scheduled to be completed on
1/21/25.  It would seem to be a bit
backward.  If the arbitration is not
going to go forward until and unless the court so orders, then there is no
exigency here.  The court would be
inclined to move the motion to compel back to 2/5/25 and hear it with the
“motion to dismiss,” which the court reads as an argument against arbitration.
