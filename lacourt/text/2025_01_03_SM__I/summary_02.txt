And here is the summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling suggests continuing the evidentiary hearing on the validity of the contract, allowing reasonable discovery, and denying the ex parte motion. The respondent has refused to make the client available, and the court finds no good reason for this. The court is aware of the procedural issues in the case and wants to put them aside to focus on moving forward. The respondent is advised to be available for deposition at the petitioner's convenience. Since the hearing will likely be continued, the ex parte motion is denied due to lack of urgency.
