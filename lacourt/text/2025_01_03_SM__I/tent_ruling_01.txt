  Case Number:  21SMCV01441    Hearing Date:   January 3, 2025    Dept:  I At the prior hearing, the court stated that it needed
additional information: (1) did the named plaintiff have a claim that was
settled; (2) is counsel getting fees for any individual claims; (3) what is the
lodestar calculation for the fee award; (4) why is it appropriate to give the
named plaintiff $5000 when each other aggrieved employee is getting about $45
(the court understands some premium, but this seems like a lot unless the named
plaintiff put a lot more time into the matter than the court suspects).   Counsel filed declarations on Tuesday at
about 4:00 pm and they were just uploaded this morning, so the court has not
been able to scrutinize them.  The
declarations suggest that counsel spent over 126 hours on this case and
(although the number is not given expressly) ought to be paid about $500/hour
based on experience.  That seems a bit
high for an attorney who has been in practice for only four years, although the
court cannot say that with certainty nor does the court know how many hours
were worked by which attorneys—there could be some hours worked by more senior
attorneys and some by less senior attorneys. 
The declaration also answers the first question: the named plaintiff did
have a claim that was separately settled. 
However, questions (2) and (4) were not answered, and the court still
has questions about the lodestar amount.
 
The court has no doubt but that settling an individual claim
does not deprive plaintiff of PAGA standing. 
That is settled law.  What it does
do is raise related questions in the court’s mind.  First, were any of the hours used in the
lodestar statement actually hours worked with relation to plaintiff’s
individual claim?  Second, did counsel
get compensated in any of those claims in addition to the compensation being
sought in the PAGA claim?  If the answer
is “yes,” then the court would need to know how that affected the number of
hours in the lodestar.  If the answer is
“no,” then the court would want to know why the entire fee is being shifted to
the PAGA claim.  Third, if plaintiff
obtained a separate settlement, then the court is even more concerned about the
$5000 payment to plaintiff in the PAGA action when the individual aggrieved
employees are getting about $45.  The
court also notes that actual bills are not required, and that counsel’s
declaration is evidence of the amount of time worked.  But this is very thin.  The court is also aware that it can award a
1/3 recovery in cases like this, but it needs the lodestar to check to ensure
that the recovery is reasonable.
 
The court will therefore CONTINUE the matter to allow these
answers to be given—hopefully not in a manner where the court sees them for the
first time on the morning of the hearing. 
The court is not saying it will not approve the settlement; only that it
needs additional information.At the prior hearing, the court stated that it needed
