BACKGROUND¿¿¿¿A. Factual¿¿This is a commercial unlawful detainer case. Plaintiff Eli Mathews (Plaintiff) alleged that he owned a mall space for which Defendants Godson Ihechimere Uduhiri and Da Point Lounge, LLC (collectively, Defendants) had failed to comply with a three-day notice to pay rent or quit possession as well as a three-day notice to perform covenants of the lease or quit possession.B. ¿ ProceduralPlaintiff filed the complaint November 13, 2020. Judgment was entered for Defendants on July 6, 2021.Defendants filed a motion for attorney’s fees on August 18, 2021. The motion was granted on October 13, 2021.Plaintiff appealed the grant of attorney’s fees on October 14, 2021. The decision was affirmed on September 6, 2022.Defendants filed a motion for grant of attorney’s fees on appeal on September 30, 2022. The motion was granted on January 31, 2023 in the amount of $11,250.Defendants subsequently filed a proposed order on April 26, 2024, requesting $22,750 in attorney’s fees.¿¿¿II. ANALYSIS¿A. Legal Standard ¿Code of Civil Procedure section 1032 establishes that a prevailing party in an action, as a matter of right, is entitled to recover costs in any action or proceeding unless a statute specifically states otherwise. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1032, subd. (a)(4).)California Rules of Court, rule 3.1312(b) requires that a prevailing party “promptly transmit the proposed order to the court together with a summary of any responses of the other parties or a statement that no responses were received.”B. Discussion¿ A different judge of the LA Superior Court granted Defendants’ motion for attorney’s fees on October 13, 2021, in the amount of $20,475 and a Minute Order in the court file reflects the same. The grant of attorney’s fees was affirmed on appeal. Later, this Court, i.e., Judge Frank, subsequently granted Defendants’ motion for attorney’s fees on appeal on January 31, 2023, in the amount of $11,250.As Defendants have already been granted attorney’s fees following trial and following appeal, it is unclear for what reason Defendants are currently requesting other, additional, or the same attorney’s fees. Attorney Ikonde has stated in their declaration that Defendants inadvertently failed to file an order; however, orders appear to have been filed already for both grants of attorney’s fees.III. CONCLUSION¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ Defendant is requested to present oral argument as to what remains to be ruled upon.
