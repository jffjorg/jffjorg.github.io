And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion for attorney's fees filed by the defendants in a commercial unlawful detainer case. The plaintiff, Eli Mathews, alleged that the defendants failed to comply with the lease and a three-day notice to pay rent or quit possession. The defendants were granted attorney's fees on October 13, 2021, in the amount of $20,475, and this decision was affirmed on appeal. The defendants then filed a motion for grant of attorney's fees on appeal, which was granted on January 31, 2023, in the amount of $11,250. Now, the defendants are requesting an additional $22,750 in attorney's fees. The judge is unclear why the defendants are requesting additional fees, as they have already been granted attorney's fees twice before. The judge is requesting that the defendants present oral argument to explain their request for additional fees.
