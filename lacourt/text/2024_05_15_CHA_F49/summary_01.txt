And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has ruled that the demurrer filed by Pilot Travel Centers LLC is overruled. The court found that the plaintiffs' first amended complaint (FAC) presents sufficient factual allegations to state a cause of action for general negligence against Pilot. The court also found that the FAC's allegations of fact are not inconsistent with facts alleged in the initial complaint. The court also ruled that the plaintiffs' loss of consortium claim is not defective and is sufficient to state a cause of action. The court ordered the defendant to serve and file its answer to the first amended complaint within 30 days.
