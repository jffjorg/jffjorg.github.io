  Case Number:  23CHCV02211    Hearing Date:   May 15, 2024    Dept:  F49    Dept.    F49      Date:    5/15/24     Case    Name: Jose Antonio Mesa-Marentes, et al. v. JCC Losigtics, Inc., et al.     Case    # 23CHCV02211      LOS ANGELES SUPERIOR COURT NORTH VALLEY DISTRICT DEPARTMENT F49    MAY 15, 2024    DEMURRER  Los Angeles Superior  Court Case # 23CHCV02211    Motion  filed: 3/27/24   MOVING PARTY: Defendant Pilot Travel Centers LLC (the  “Moving Defendant” or “Pilot”) RESPONDING PARTY: Plaintiffs Jose Antonio  Mesa-Marentes and Maria Guadalupe Esquivel-Carreon (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) NOTICE: OK    RELIEF  REQUESTED: An  order from this Court granting Defendant’s demurrer to the First Amended  Complaint.   TENTATIVE  RULING: The demurrer  is OVERRULED.    BACKGROUND   This action arises from alleged personal injury and property  damage sustained by Plaintiff Jose Antonio Mesa-Marentes in a motor vehicle  collision with a vehicle operated by Defendant Driver Steven Bloberg (the “Crash”).  (FAC, ¶ 18.)   On July 26, 2023, Plaintiffs filed their complaint, alleging  against ten named defendants the following causes of action: (1) Motor Vehicle  Negligence; (2) Negligent Entrustment of a Motor Vehicle; (3) General  Negligence; (4) Dangerous Condition of Public Property; and (5) Loss of  Consortium. Subsequently, on September 7, 2023, Plaintiffs amended their  complaint to name the Moving Defendant as Doe Defendant 1.   On January 5, 2024, the Department F51 Court sustained  Pilot’s demurrer to Plaintiffs’ initial complaint with leave to amend.    On February 2, 2024, Plaintiffs filed their operative First  Amended Complaint (“FAC”). Subsequently, on April 2, 2024, Plaintiffs refiled  the FAC, correcting a clerical error on its caption page.   On March 27, 2024, the Moving Defendant filed the instant  Demurrer (the “Demurrer”). On May 3, 2024, Plaintiffs filed their Opposition.  Subsequently, on May 8, 2024, the Moving Defendant replied.     ANALYSIS   “It is black letter law that a demurrer  tests the legal sufficiency of the allegations in a complaint.” (Lewis v.  Safeway, Inc. (2015) 235 Cal.App.4th 385, 388.) A general demurrer is  proper, and typically used, where the plaintiff fails to allege “facts  sufficient to constitute a cause of action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd.  (e); Cloud v. Northrop Grumman Corp. (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 995, 1004.)   “The sufficiency of a cause of action is  evaluated by presuming all of the material factual allegations in the complaint  are true.” (Aubry v. TriCity Hospital Dist. (1992) 2 Cal 4th 962, 966 –  967 (Aubry).) In ruling on a demurrer, a court may consider facts that  are properly subject to judicial notice. (Arroyo v. Plosay, 225 Cal.  App. 4th 279.) In ruling on a demurrer, the allegations of the complaint must  be liberally construed, with a view to substantial justice between the parties.  (Glennen v. Allergan, Inc. (2016) 247 Cal.App.4th 1, 6.) Nevertheless,  while "[a] demurrer admits all facts properly pleaded, [it does] not  [admit] contentions, deductions or conclusions of law or fact." (George  v. Automobile Club of Southern California (2011) 201 Cal.App.4th 1112,  1120, 135.) Additionally, “[a] complaint otherwise good on its face is subject  to demurrer when facts judicially noticed render it defective.” (Evans v.  City of Berkeley (2006) 38 Cal.4th 1, 6.)   “It is error for a trial court to  sustain a demurrer when the plaintiff has stated a cause of action under any  possible legal theory. (Barquis v. Merchants Collection Assn. (1972) 7  Cal.3d 94, 103.) And it is an abuse of discretion to sustain a demurrer without  leave to amend if the plaintiff shows there is a reasonable possibility any  defect identified by the defendant can be cured by amendment. (Blank v.  Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.)” Aubry, supra, 2 Cal. 4th  at 967.)   A.                 Meet and  Confer   A  party filing a demurrer “shall meet and confer in person or by telephone with  the party who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the purpose of  determining whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve the  objections to be raised in the demurrer.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a).)  A failure to meet and confer does not constitute grounds to sustain or overrule  a demurrer. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a)(4).)   On February 27, 2024, Pilot’s  counsel sent a meet and confer letter and requests to Plaintiffs’ counsel,  detailing the issues raised in the instant Demurrer. (Attia Decl, ¶ 7.) As of  the filing of the Demurrer, Pilot’s counsel had not responded. (Id., ¶  8.)    Consequently, the Court finds  that the requirement for in-person or telephonic meet and confer has not been met.   B.                  Third Cause  of Action – General Negligence   'The  elements of a cause of action for negligence are well established. They are  "(a) a legal duty to use due care; (b) a breach of such legal duty; [and]  (c) the breach was the proximate or legal cause of the resulting injury  [damages]." (Ladd v. County of San Mateo (1996) 12 Cal.4th 913,  917.) The absence of any one of the elements is fatal to a negligence claim.  (See Gilmer v. Ellington (2008) 159 Cal.App.4th 190, 195.) Premises  liability is governed by ordinary negligence principles. (Rowland v.  Christian (1968) 69 Cal.2d 108, 118.) Landowners are held to the general  statutory duty to use “ordinary care or skill in the management” of their  property, and are responsible for injuries proximately caused by the failure to  exercise such care, except where injured persons, “willfully or by want or  ordinary care,” brought the injury upon themselves. (Civ. Code § 1714, subd.  (a); Ann M v. Pacific Plaza Shopping Center (1993) 6 Cal.4th 666,  674-675; Becker v. IRM Corp. (1985) 38 Cal.3d 454, 467.)               “Ordinarily, negligence may be  alleged in general terms, without specific facts showing how the injury  occurred, but there are ‘limits to the generality with which a plaintiff is  permitted to state his cause of action, and ... the plaintiff must indicate the  acts or omissions which are said to have been negligently performed. He may not  recover upon the bare statement that the defendant’s negligence has caused him  injury.’ [Citation].” (Berkley v. Dowds (2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 518, 527  (Berkley).) However, there is no requirement that plaintiff identify and  allege the precise moment of the injury or the exact nature of the wrongful  act. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.)                Here, the Moving Defendant argues  that the FAC contains limited new allegations compared to the initial complaint,  which the Department F51 Court found insufficient to state a cause of action  for general negligence. (Dem., at p. 3.) Specifically, Pilot notes that the new  allegations in paragraph 18 of the FAC, which are emphasized in in bold, state that  “[the Crash occurred] at the approximate location of Frazier Mountain Park  Road, 550 feet west of Lebec Road, and the driveway of PILOT and/or TUJHMM  in Unincorporated, California, the County of Los Angeles[.]” (Bold in  original.) Pilot contends that by merely adding “the driveway of PILOT and/or  TUJHMM” indicates that PILOT was operating a business “on the land where” the  accident happened but does not specifically allege the accident occurred on  Pilot’s premises. (Dem., at p. 5.)              The Court disagrees with Pilot’s interpretation under the  standard of review for a demurrer. In reviewing a demurrer, the Court must  presume “all  of the material factual allegations in the complaint are true.” (Aubry,  supra, 2 Cal 4th at pp. 966 – 967.) Pilot seems to concede that the pleading indicates  it was operating a business at the location of the accident. By liberal  construction and reasonable inference, the Court finds that the allegations sufficiently  state that Pilot owes “an ordinary care of management” of its driveway. While  Pilot argues that the “driveway of PILOT” does not explicitly show it is on  Pilot’s premises, the Court finds the description adequate to meet the  standards of pleading in general terms for Negligence claims. (See Berkley,  supra, 152 Cal.App.4th at p. 527.) Further specifics can be developed during  discovery.    Pilot  further contends that the FAC’s allegations improperly contradict the location  of the Crash as stated in the initial complaint, arguing that the conflicting  factual allegations should be disregarded in the amended complaint, citing Del  E. Webb Corp. v. Structural Materials Co. (1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 593, 604.  Specifically, Pilot asserts that the FAC alleges the Crash occurred “approximately  both on Frazier Mountain Park Road” and “the driveway of PILOT,” whereas the  initial complaint only stated that the accident occurred on Frazier Mountain  Park Road only. (Dem., at p. 6.)   The  Court notes that when testing a pleading against a demurrer, courts “will not  close their eye to situations where a complaint contains allegations of fact  inconsistent with attached documents, or allegations contrary to facts which  are judicially noticed.” (See Alphonzo E. Bell Corp. v. Bell View Oil  Syndicate (1941) 46 Cal.App.2d 684.) Contrarily, Plaintiff argues that the additional  information seeks to clarify the location. (Opp’n., at p. 6.) The Court finds  that Defendant’s argument that the additional detail constitutes a  contradiction is unpersuasive.   The  Court agrees with Plaintiff to the extent that it finds nothing in the FAC that  is so inconsistent with facts alleged in the initial complaint as to render the  FAC demurrable.    Consequently,  the Court OVERRULES the Demurrer as to the Third Cause of Action.                C.                 Fifth Cause  of Action – Loss of Consortium   In a cause of action for  Loss of Consortium, the plaintiff must establish the following elements: (1)  valid and lawful marriage between the plaintiff and injured spouse, at the time  of injury; (2) tortious injury to the plaintiff’s spouse; (3) loss of  consortium suffered by plaintiff; and (4) loss proximately caused by  defendant’s act. (Vanhooser v. Superior Court (2012) 206  Cal.App.4th 921, 927; Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 746 n.  2; see also Taylor v. Elliott  Turbomachinery Co., Inc. (2009) 171 Cal.App.4th 564, 596 fn.16, [claim for  loss of consortium fails, where it is derivative of, or dependent upon, other  causes of action that fail.])   Here, Pilot argues that Plaintiffs’ Loss of Consortium  claim fails as a matter of law because they have not stated a valid cause of  action for General Negligence against Pilot, the underlying claim upon which the  Loss of Consortium claim depends. (Dem., at p. 7.)   Given that the Court has already concluded that  Plaintiffs’ FAC presents sufficient factual allegations to state a cause of  action for General Negligence, the Moving Defendant’s argument on this basis  should fail.   Accordingly, the Court OVERRULES the Demurrer as to  the Fifth Cause of Action.              CONCLUSION              The  Moving Defendant Pilot Travel Centers LLC’s Demurrer is OVERRULED.   The  Moving Defendant Pilot Travel Centers LLC is ordered  to serve and file its Answer to the First Amended Complaint within 30 days.   Moving  party is ordered to give notice.
