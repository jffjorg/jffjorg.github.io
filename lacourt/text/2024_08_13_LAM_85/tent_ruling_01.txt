  Case Number:  22STCP03914    Hearing Date:   August 13, 2024    Dept:  85 
M&A Gabaee v. City of Hawthorne and Hawthorne City
Council, 22STCP03914

Tentative decision on petition for mandate: granted




 
 
Petitioner M&A Gabaee (“Gabaee”) seeks a writ of administrative
mandamus compelling Respondents City of Hawthorne (“City”) and City Council
(collectively, “City”) to grant its renewal applications for business licenses.  The court has read and considered the moving
papers, opposition, and reply, and renders the following tentative decision.
 
A. Statement of the Case
1. Petition
            Petitioner Gabaee commenced this
proceeding against Respondents City and City Council on October 31, 2022,
alleging claims for (1) mandamus and (2) violation of due process.  The Petition alleges in pertinent part as
follows.
            Gabaee is the owner of the site of
the former Hawthorne Mall (“Mall”) and its adjacent multi-level parking
structure (collectively, the “Property”). 
The previous owners closed the Property in 1999.  When Gabaee bought the Mall in 2000, looters
had stolen almost all the fixtures. 
Gabaee sought to reposition the Mall for redevelopment into a more
viable use.  The condition of the Mall has
not materially changed since then.
            Gabaee holds a Commercial Rental
License and a Commercial Rental for Filming License for the Mall (collectively,
“business licenses”).  Gabaee now leases
part of the Mall to the County of Los Angeles (“County”) Department of Public
Social Services, Crystal Stairs, Inc., and a live scan and notary services
business owned by Harold Utomakili. 
Gabaee also leases part of the parking structure to Tesla and licenses
portions of the Mall for filming events. 

            Two of Gaabaee’s tenants have rented
space since 2002 and have not complained about safety concerns.  The only known incident involves a trespasser
who fell and injured his leg about ten years ago.  Recent changes have made the Property safer
as only one gate is open and only the tenants and invitees can access the
Property per their lease agreements. 
Although the City falsely claims that homeless people encamp on the
Property, none of the tenants have alleged as much.
            In 2018, the City and Gabaee
disputed whether a portion of the Property should be used for a residential
development or big box retail.  The City
blamed Gabaee for their failure to reach a plan for redevelopment.  Former City Manager Arnie Shadbehr wanted to
end Tesla’s use of the Property and urged the City’s enforcement officers to
increase the number of citations issued to Gabaee, and they did so.  By 2020, the citations issued to Gabaee had
accrued $2,000 in fines per day, a total of over $1,000,000.  Gabaee challenged these fines in three
administrative proceedings at which some citations were upheld and others were
rejected.  De novo review of the
two 2020 administrative rulings is pending in Department 62, and Gabaee also
filed an appeal from the third ruling.
            In March 2021, the City and Gabaee
entered into an Interim Agreement.  Under
its terms, the City would have full access to the Property and would send
Gabaee correction notices with an opportunity to resolve the issues
therein.  The City failed to do so by the
time the Interim Agreement expired on June 1, 2021.  
On November 24, 2021, the City filed a nuisance complaint
against Gabaee, LASC No. 21TRCV00869 (“Nuisance Action”).  The Nuisance Action alleges that Gabaree
committed unlawful business practices, nuisance per se, public nuisance, and
violations of the Hawthorne Municipal Code (“HMC”).  Many of the conditions cited in the complaint
have existed since 1999, but this was the first time the City stated that they were
a nuisance.
            On March 7, 2022, the City emailed
Gabaee a letter dated February 24, 2022. 
The letter informed Gabaee that the City would not renew its business licenses.  The City asserted that Gabaee failed to
comply with unspecified statutes and ordinances, did not operate in an orderly
and businesslike manner, and conducted business in a manner which endangers the
public welfare.  The City set a hearing on
the business licenses revocation for March 29, 2022.
            On March 23, 2022, Gabaee applied ex
parte in the Nuisance Action for a temporary restraining order enjoining
the City from revoking the business licenses. 
The City asserted that the two proceedings were unrelated and the court
denied the ex parte application.
On March 30, 2022, the hearing officer in the business
licenses revocation issued a decision with a one-paragraph “Findings and Order”
that the revocation was justified.  The
decision did not discuss or quote the provisions of the HMC Gabaee had
violated, explain how Gabaee violated those provisions, specify what evidence
supported the decision, explain how any of the Property’s conditions constitute
a danger, or address any of Gabaee’s contentions.
            On April 11, 2022, Gabaee appealed
the hearing officer’s decision to the City Council.  The HMC provides that the City Council must
hear an appeal within 15 days.  After
Gabaee’s counsel argued that any biased City Council member should recuse
himself, the City Council referred the appeal to JAMS.  Gabaee agreed to the referral under a
reservation of rights.
            In a supplemental brief for JAMS,
Gabaee argued that suspension of a business based on a curable nuisance is a
violation of due process.  All the HMC
provisions Gabaee supposedly violated have express notice, cure, and appeal
provisions that the City ignored.  Gabaee
also reiterated that the basis for revocation was the same as the test for
nuisance in the Nuisance Action.  
            At the hearing on May 31, 2022, the
parties agreed that the standard for appeal was de novo independent
review.  The hearing officer granted the
City permission to submit additional evidence and it did so on June 7,
2022.  This evidence cited conditions
that had existed at the Property for over 20 years, alleged non-specific
violations of the HMC, and claimed that the Property was dangerous without explaining
how.
            On September 15, 2022, the hearing
officer issued a decision.  Despite the
parties’ agreement that the proper standard of review was de novo, the hearing
officer applied the substantial evidence standard.  The hearing officer also determined that she lacked
jurisdiction to consider Gabaee’s due process or other legal arguments.
            The City revoked Gabaee’s longstanding
business licenses without live testimony, with two declarants identified only as
“X” and “Z,” and before any ruling in the Nuisance Action.  Gabaee requests a peremptory writ of mandamus
directing the City Council to vacate the revocation of the business licenses
and to renew them after receipt of the appropriate fee.  Gabaee also seeks attorney’s fees and costs.
 
            2. Course of Proceedings
            On October 31, 2022, Gabaee filed a
notice of related cases for (a) Gabaee v. City, (“Gabaee I”)
(2020), Case No. 20STCP02652; (b) Gabaee v. City, (“Gabaee II”)
(2020), Case No. 20STLC09160; and the Nuisance Action.
            On November 1, 2022, Gabaee served
the City and City Council with the Petition and Summons.
            On December 16, 2022, Department 62
declined to relate this case to Gabaee I, Gabaee II, and the
Nuisance Action.
            On February 16, 2023, this court
denied Gabaee’s ex parte application for a stay of the business licenses
decision for lack of an emergency.  The
court noted that Gabaee could make a noticed motion for a preliminary
injunction to that effect.
            On March 28, 2023, pursuant to a
stipulation, Gabaee withdrew without prejudice a noticed motion for stay of the
administrative decision under review.  On
April 3, 2023, pursuant to the same stipulation, Gabaee agreed to reserve for a
renewed motion to stay the administrative decision to June 13, 2023.  On that date, the court continued the hearing
date for the motion for a stay of the administrative decision under review to
September 28, 2023.  No stay motion was
filed or heard, and it was taken off calendar.
 
B. Standard of Review
CCP section 1094.5 is the administrative mandamus provision
which structures the procedure for judicial review of adjudicatory decisions
rendered by administrative agencies.  Topanga
Ass’n for a Scenic Community v. County of Los Angeles, (“Topanga”)
(1974) 11 Cal.3d 506, 514-15.  
CCP section 1094.5 does not in its face specify which cases
are subject to independent review, leaving that issue to the courts.  Fukuda v. City of Angels, (“Fukuda”)
(1999) 20 Cal.4th 805, 811.  In cases
reviewing decisions which affect a vested, fundamental right the trial court
exercises independent judgment on the evidence.  Bixby v. Pierno, (“Bixby”) (1971)
4 Cal.3d 130, 143.  See CCP
§1094.5(c).  In other cases, the
substantial evidence test applies.  Mann
v. Dept. of Motor Vehicles, (1999) 76 Cal.App.4th 312, 320; Clerici v.
Dept. of Motor Vehicles, (1990) 224 Cal.App.3d 1016, 1023. 
A right may be deemed fundamental based on either (1) “the
character and quality of its economic aspect; (2) the character and quality of
its human aspect.”  Amerco Real Estate
Co. v. City of West Sacramento, (“Amerco”) (2014) 224 Cal.App.4th
778, 783 (citation omitted).  This is a
case-by-case determination.  Termo
Company v. Luther, (2008) 169 Cal.App.4th 394, 398-99 (independent judgment
test applies where implementation of the agency’s decision and order to shut
down and abandon oil wells would shut down the petitioner’s oil well business
that had been in existence for 20 years). 
Compare Standard Oil v. Feldstein, (1980) 105 Cal.App.3d
590, 604 (substantial evidence test applied where there was no contention oil
company will be driven to ruin by the agency action); Mobil Oil Corp. v.
Superior Court, (1976) 59 Cal.App.3d 293, 305 (same).
“[A]s a general rule, when a case involves or affects purely
economic interests, courts are far less likely to find a right to be of the
fundamental vested character."  JKH
Enterprises, Inc. v. Department of Industrial Relations, (2006) 142
Cal.App.4th 1046, 1060 (impact of agency’s decision to issue an administrative
stop work order and penalty for violation labor relations was purely economic
and the substantial evidence was appropriate standard of review).  In contrast, a court will apply its
independent judgment where the administrative decision will drive the owner out
of business or significantly injure its ability to function.  Amerco, supra, 224 Cal.App.4th
at 784 (land use decision that U-Haul could not maintain overlarge sign
governed by substantial evidence test). 
The parties disagree whether the court’s review should be independent
or substantial evidence review.  Compare
Pet. Op. Br. at 10 and Opp. at 8-9. 

Although the case involves Gabaee’s purely economic interest,
Gabaee may have a fundamental right to renewal of its license that had been in place
for 20 years.  This is particularly true
because HMC sections 5.15.020 and 5.02.100(A) may be interpreted to make a
non-renewal of a license the equivalent of a revocation.  These HMC provisions state as follows:
 
“Any
license may be renewed without application upon payment of the required license
fee, subject to the other provisions of this code, except in cases where a recommendation has been for revocation of the
license by the city manager, city attorney, police chief, fire chief or
building official based upon grounds stated in Hawthorne Municipal Code Section
5.16.020.”  HMC §5.02.100(A); AR
69 (emphasis added).
 
Any
license or permit may be revoked or suspended “for a failure to comply with
any regulatory provision contained in the statutes of the state or in the
ordinances of the city regulating such business, or for any failure to
operate such business in an orderly and businesslike manner, in obedience to
such orders, rules and regulations as may be applicable thereto under the
provisions of this code or statutes of this state, or for conducting such business
in an illegal, improper or disorderly manner or in a manner which endangers the
public welfare.”  HMC §5.16.020; AR 70
(emphasis added).
 
Read collectively, HMC sections 5.15.020 and 5.02.100(A) may indicate
that the City’s license revocation procedure applies to non-renewal of a
license.  Thiis conclusion is supported
by the fact that all parties refer to the administrative proceedings as a
license revocation.  See, e.g., AR
685, 2477. The standard of review for license revocation is independent
judgment.  Griffiths v. Superior Court,
(2002) 96 Cal.App.4th 757, 767.
The court need not decide whether it should use its
independent judgment to review the facts because the hearing officer applied
the wrong standard to her review and also failed to consider all the evidence.  As a result, the court lacks proper
underlying findings from which to evaluate the facts and determine the
sufficiency of the evidence.  See post.  
The agency’s decision must be based on the evidence presented
at the hearing.  Board of Medical
Quality Assurance v. Superior Court, (1977) 73 Cal.App.3d 860, 862.  The hearing officer is only required to issue
findings that give enough explanation so that parties may determine whether,
and upon what basis, to review the decision. 
Topanga, supra, 11 Cal.3d at 514-15.  Implicit in section 1094.5 is a requirement
that the agency set forth findings to bridge the analytic gap between the raw
evidence and ultimate decision or order. 
Id. at 515.
            An agency is presumed to have
regularly performed its official duties (Evid. Code §664), and the petitioner
therefore has the burden of proof.  Steele
v. Los Angeles County Civil Service Commission, (1958) 166 Cal.App.2d 129,
137.  “[T]he burden of proof falls upon
the party attacking the administrative decision to demonstrate wherein the
proceedings were unfair, in excess of jurisdiction or showed prejudicial abuse
of discretion.”  Afford v. Pierno,
(1972) 27 Cal.App.3d 682, 691.
 
C. Governing Law
“Any license may be renewed without application upon payment
of the required license fee, subject to the other provisions of this code, except in cases where a recommendation has
been for revocation of the license by the city manager, city attorney, police
chief, fire chief or building official based upon grounds stated in Hawthorne
Municipal Code Section 5.16.020.” 
HMC §5.02.100(A); AR 69, 1192 (emphasis added).
A business license may be revoked or suspended “for a failure
to comply with any regulatory provision contained in the statutes of the state
or in the ordinances of the city regulating such business, or for any failure
to operate such business in an orderly and businesslike manner, in obedience to
such orders, rules and regulations as may be applicable thereto under the
provisions of this code or statutes of this state, or for conducting such
business in an illegal, improper or disorderly manner or in a manner which
endangers the public welfare.”  HMC
§5.16.020; AR 70.
 
D. Statement of Facts



1. Petitioner’s
Evidence
Petitioner Gabaee, a California limited partnership, is the
owner of the Property, consisting of the Mall and its adjacent multi-level
parking structure.  AR 332.  Gabaee purchased the Mall in 2000 and purchased
the parking structure from the City in 2020. 
AR 332.  Gabaee has had a
commercial rental license issued by the City since 2000.  AR 343. 
The license renews automatically each year upon payment of a fee.  AR 343. 
The same is true of the filming license issued by the City each
year.  AR 343.
The Property was the City’s first redevelopment project.  AR 331. 
In or about 1977, the Property became an indoor mall that housed stores
such as Broadway, JCPenney, and Montgomery Ward.  AR 331. 
By the 1990s, the Property was in serious decline due to economic
changes in the local economy and, following two shootings, which gave rise to a
perception that the Mall was unsafe.  AR 332.  Tenants of the Property began to leave with
the last of the big-box anchors, JCPenney, leaving in or about 1998.  AR 332. 
The Property closed its doors for good around 1999.  AR 332.
When Gabaee acquired the Mall, the building was completely
vacant, and its fixtures and non-structural elements had been totally ransacked
and looted.  AR 332.  The Mall was a magnet for crime and presented
serious health and safety hazards due to trespassers, squatters, vandalism, and
trash.  AR 332.  
Over the years, Gabaee has done considerable work cleaning
up, securing and maintaining the Property, and repositioning the Property for
redevelopment as a mixed-use project with residential units, including
affordable housing, but such efforts have proven unsuccessful.  AR 332. 
Nonetheless, Gabaee has leased substantial portions of the Property to
various parties, including the County and film production companies.  AR00333. 

The Property is divided into (1) the original structure of
the Mall and (2) the adjacent multi-level parking structure.  AR 335. 
The Mall has approximately 935,000 square feet of gross floor area, with
approximately 147,000 square feet (or 1/5 of the total square footage) under
lease for use as commercial office space. 
AR 335.  The remaining portion is approximately
780,000 square feet and is unoccupied, although occasionally used for filming.  AR 335. 

The exterior of the Mall fronts onto Hawthorne Boulevard and
faces the City’s Police Department.  AR 336.  The exterior of the Property is secured
against unauthorized entry by walls, fencing, barbed wire, and other security
barriers, devices, and structures.  AR 336.  the escalators that transported customers
from the ground-level parking area up into the interior of the Mall are now
inoperable, but nevertheless lead to the unoccupied portion of the Mall.  They have been completely fenced off to
prevent trespassers from gaining unauthorized access to the interior of the Property.  AR 336. 
Similarly, all other entryways to the interior of the unoccupied portion
of the Property, inclusive of foot bridges and former docking bays, are fenced
off and/or sealed from the public.  AR 337.
The unoccupied and occupied spaces are completely separated
by floor-to-ceiling walls.  AR 335.  No part of the Property, including the
parking structure, is open to the general public.  AR 335. 
Use of the Property is expressly restricted to the tenants and their
customers or visitors, in accordance with the terms of their lease agreements.  AR 335.
The occupied portions of the Property are maintained in good
and marketable condition including a fully functioning commercial-grade fire
suppression sprinkler system.  AR 336, 338.  Gabaee is not aware of any current complaint
by the tenants regarding the conditions of the Property.  AR 336. 
The fire system is periodically inspected by the County Fire Department,
regularly tested, and is in good operating condition and repair.  AR 338. 
In fact, the County Fire Department has used the Property to run training
drills and exercises.  AR 338.  
As to the unoccupied portion of the Property, the only
plumbing used for the unoccupied portion is associated with the fire suppression
systems.  AR 337.  The plumbing, despite being exposed, does
nothing to create any safety hazards or risks. 
AR 337. 
There is no electrical power to the interior of the
unoccupied portion of the Mall.  Thus, any
exposed electrical wiring is long-dead and does not create any risk of fire,
shock, or other safety hazards on the Property. 
AR 337.  The skylights were long
ago broken or stolen by illegal trespassers. 
AR 337.  They have been covered
with sturdy coop wiring to prevent birds from entering the interior of the
Property.  AR 337.  The unoccupied portion of the Property is not
infested by birds or vermin.  AR 338. 
Although the interior of the Mall has been subject to
graffiti over the years, the graffiti does not in any way compromise the
structural integrity of the Mall.  Nor is
the graffiti visible from the outside of the enclosed structure.  AR 338. 
The graffiti is also a highly desired characteristic for commercial
filming.  AR 338.
The parking structure is secured against unauthorized entry
by walls, heavy gauge fencing, barbed wire, and other security barriers,
devices and structures.  AR 338.  Even though there were two fires in the
parking area at the ground level beneath the unoccupied portion of the Mall in
January 2022, they were started by illegal trespassers, one of which appeared
to be an act of arson and was so identified by the County Fire Department.  AR 341, 1387. 
The fires triggered the fire suppression system, which performed as
designed, and the fires were ultimately extinguished by the County Fire
Department (AR 341); and no structural damage resulted.  AR 342. 
Homeless occasionally use the Property for shelter but there are no
homeless encampments on the Property and security protocols prevent these
encampments.  AR 342.
As for personal injuries on the Property, Gabaee is only
aware of one incident approximately ten years ago where an illegal trespasser
suffered a fall from inside the unoccupied portion of the Property.  AR 342-43. 
As a result of that incident, Gabaee installed safety fencing designed
to prevent any reoccurrence.  AR 343.  There have been no deaths at the Property
during Gabaee’s ownership.  AR 343.  
Finally, there has been no non-permitted construction on the
Property, nor has the City identified any. 
The Property is not dilapidated decaying, demolished, or falling
down.  AR 342-43.  On the contrary, the Property is stable,
secure, and sound.  AR 342.
On or about March 25, 2021, Gabaee consented to an inspection
of the Property.  AR 339.  Following the inspection, in November 2021, the
City filed the Nuisance Action against Gabaee, and others, concerning the
Property.  AR 339.  Although Gabaee vigorously disputes the
allegations in the Nuisance Action, commencing in January 2022 Gabaee upgraded
its maintenance of the Property to include removal of debris, removal of
graffiti (exterior), upkeep of landscaping, fortifying external fencing and
security structures, installation of security cameras, etc.  AR 339-41. 
Pictures taken by the Property’s property manager, Cesar Casillas, during
the upgrade in maintenance procedures compare favorably to the City’s pictures
at time of the inspection (March 2021).  AR
245-46, 248-52.
On February 24, 2022, the City gave Gabaee expedited notice
that its longstanding business licenses would not be renewed.  AR 1, 343. 
Despite Gabaee’s improvements to the Property over the years (AR00332),
the City’s refusal to renew was based upon HMC section §5.16.020.  AR 1.  The
City’s refusal to renew Gabaee’s business licenses has prevented Gabaee from
using the Property in the same manner it has done for more than 20 years,
thereby preventing Gabaee from making any economic and commercial profitable
use of the Property.  AR 344.  The City has never provided Gabaee with a
detailed listing of the specific matters that the City contends violate the HMC.  AR 336.
 
2. The City’s Evidence 
In 2017, Gabaee was issued a commercial rental license.  AR 18-19. 
In 2021, Gabaee was issued a commercial rental filming license.  AR 18-19.
On March 25, September 28, and October 7, 2021, City
inspectors from the Code Enforcement Department and Department of Building and
Safety conducted inspections of the Property, wherein they observed several unlawful,
dangerous, and substandard conditions at the Property.  AR25-34, 43-51.  The Property had mold, trash, debris, animal
waste, pervasive fire hazards, inoperable and inadequate fire extinguishing
equipment, partial construction, and vermin intrusion.  AR 25-34, 43-51, 100-183.  These substandard conditions violate the HMC,
Health and Safety Code, the Building code, the Uniform Code for Abatement of
Dangerous Buildings, the Plumbing Code, the Electrical Code, and the Fire Code.  AR25-34, 43-51.
The Property has become a hub for crime, break-ins by
transients and youths, illegal trash dumping, the burning of refuse, and the
occupation of the premises by persons experiencing homelessness, all of which
have resulted in the consistent deterioration of the Property.  AR23-24, 41-42.  The Property “is a magnet for criminal
activities” and has an “established reputation in the neighborhood, and within
the community, as a place where teenagers and homeless individuals camp or
loiter, consume alcohol, and ingest drugs.” 
AR 57.  Several fires have broken
out at the Property, including a massive fire on January 26, 2022.  AR 24, 28, 5-36, 184-96.  The January 26, 2022 fire originated from a
large rubbish fire in the underground parking structure and quickly escalated
into a third-alarm fire, with over 100 firefighters on the scene working to
douse the flames.  AR 35-36, 52, 184-96.  
In light of the dangerous and substandard conditions of the
Property, the City has received numerous and persistent complaints from the
public --i.e., approximately 500 calls between 2017 and 2022.  AR 23-24, 57-58, 197-218.  These calls were for crimes and disturbances
including the illegal explosion of fireworks, burglary, juvenile disturbances,
vandalism, intoxicated persons, and several structural fires.  AR 58. 
Consequently, on February 24, 2022, the City informed Gabaee that
the City would not be renewing Gabaee’s business licenses.  AR 1-2. 
Thereafter, a revocation hearing was scheduled for March 29, 2022.
 
3. The Administrative Hearing 
On March 29, 2022, hearing officer Brian Poldosky (“Poldosky”)
conducted an administrative hearing on whether the City could refuse to renew Gabaee’s
business licenses under HMC section 5.16.020. 
AR 554.  The participants were
counsel for the parties (AR 554), and they were placed under oath.  AR 559. 
Briefs were submitted, oral argument was heard, objections stated, and
evidence entered into the record.  AR 554-632.  
The following day, hearing officer Podolsky rendered his
decision, holding that Gabaee “…failed to comply with numerous regulatory
provisions of the City and State and has failed to operate its business in an
orderly and businesslike manner endangering the public welfare,...”  AR 685. 
He also found “that violations of the California Health and Safety Code,
the California Building Code, Uniform Code for Abatement of Dangerous Buildings
(Section 302), California Plumbing Code, California Electrical Code and the
California Fire Code do exist.... “  AR 685.  The hearing officer decided that Gabaee’s
business licenses should be revoked.  AR 685.
 
4. The Administrative Appeal 
On April 11, 2022, Gabaee appealed to the City Counsel the
decision rendered from the first administrative hearing.  AR 687. 
Gabaee claimed that members of the City Council were biased against it (AR
1117-18), and the City Counsel referred the appeal to an outside service.  AR 1405-06. 
The parties entered into a stipulation to the following terms: (1)
Honorable Candace Cooper (retired) (“hearing officer”) would preside over the
second administrative hearing (AR 1411); (2) the issue to be decided was whether
under HMC section 5.16.020 Gabaee’s business licenses should be revoked (not
renewed)(AR 1411); and (3) the procedures to be followed would include the
hearing officer’s independent consideration of the parties’ submissions from
the March 209, 2022 administrative hearing and additional briefing for the appeal.  AR 1411-412.
The administrative appeal occurred on May 31, 2022.  AR 2237. 
Unlike the first administrative hearing, counsel were not placed under
oath and their comments were considered as arguments.  AR 2240. 
The first administrative hearing briefs were submitted, oral argument
was heard, objections stated, and evidence was received.  See AR 2295.  The parties agreed on the record that (1) the
standard of review for the hearing officer would be de novo independent
review and (2) the burden of proof would be by a preponderance of the evidence.
 AR 2295-96.
On or about June 7, 2022, the City submitted a supplemental
brief, which included supplemental declarations.  AR 2313, 2344.  Gabaee submitted an additional brief.  AR 2453-63.
On September 15, 2022, the hearing officer rendered her
decision.  First, she concluded that she
did not have jurisdiction to consider Gabaee’s due process claims.  AR 2470.  The City argued that she stood in the shoes of
the City Council and her review was limited to whether the City had presented
substantial evidence to support revocation of Gabaee’s business licenses.  AR 2469. 
The hearing officer concluded that standing in the shoes of the City
Council meant that she was conducting a de novo hearing at which she
could consider new evidence.  Lagrutta
v. City Council  (1970) 9 Cal.App.3d
890, 894.  AR 2470.  
The hearing officer applied the substantial evidence standard
to review of the evidence (AR 2471) and considered only the City’s evidence (AR
2472-77).  She found substantial evidence
that Gabaee failed to comply with regulatory provisions and conducts its
business in a manner that endangers the public welfare.  AR 2471, 2478.  The hearing officer upheld the City’s
revocation of Gabaee’s business licenses. 
AR 2465-78.
 
E. Analysis
Petitioner Gabaee contends that the hearing officer erred in
upholding the City’s decision not to renew its business license and filming
permit.
 
1. The Hearing Officer Erred by Not Conducting an Independent
Review of the Facts
Gabaee argues that the hearing officer applied the wrong
standard of review.  Pet. Op. Br. at
10.  
The City argues that Gabaee has no fundamental vested right
to a business license.  The City points
out that “[w]here no fundamental vested right is involved, the superior court’s
review is limited to examining the administrative record to determine whether
the adjudicatory decision and its findings are supported by substantial
evidence in light of the whole record.”  Clary v. City of Crescent City,
(2017) 11 Cal.App.5th 274, 284.   “[A]s a
general rule, when a case involves or affects purely economic interests, courts
are far less likely to find a right to be of the fundamental vested
character.”  JKH Enterprises, Inc. v. Department of Industrial Relations,
(2006) 142 Cal.App.4th 1046, 1060 (impact of the Department of Industrial
Relations’ decision to issue a stop work order and penalty for violation labor
relations was purely economic and the substantial evidence standard was the
appropriate standard of reviewing the Department’s decision).  Opp. at 14. 
The City is confusing the court’s review of the hearing
officer’s decision with the hearing officer’s consideration of the evidence at
the administrative appeal.  At the
hearing, the parties and the hearing officer agreed that, although she was
conducting an appeal, it was a de novo hearing.  AR 2295. 
The hearing officer’s decision expressly stated that she was conducting
a de novo review in which she could take new evidence and render her
independent judgment.  See Lagrutta
v. City Council, (1970) 9 Cal.App.3d 890, 894-95 (city council may consider
additional evidence in de novo appeal). 
AR 2470.  Confusingly, she was
persuaded by the City that she should apply a substantial evidence standard to
the evidence.  AR 2469, 2472.  It makes no sense to review the evidence
under a substantial evidence standard in a de novo appeal where new
evidence is taken.  In that circumstance,
no underlying decision-maker has considered that new evidence to reach a
determination.  Nor would parsing old
evidence under a substantial evidence standard and new evidence under
independent review make sense.  Rather,
as the parties agreed, the hearing officer should have independently weighed
all the evidence (AR 2295) and decided the case with Gabaee having the burden
of proof by a preponderance of the evidence (AR 2296). 
Labor Code section 98.2 presents an analogous context of a de
novo superior court hearing (known as a Berman hearing) after the
Labor Commissioner’s administrative wage claim decision.  The trial court’s hearing is de novo, literally
meaning a new trial in which the court hears the matter, not as an appellate
court, but as a court of original jurisdiction with full power to hear evidence
and make a final decision.  Murphy v.
Kenneth Cole Prods., Inc., (“Murphy”) (2007) 40 Cal. 4th 1094,
1116-17.  “The de novo hearing is
‘in no sense a review of the hearing previously held, but is a complete trial
of the controversy, the same as if no previous hearing had ever been held....The
decision therein is binding upon the parties thereto and takes the place of and
completely nullifies the former determination of the matter.”  Arias v. Kardoulias, (2012) 207 Cal.
App. 4th 1429, 1436.  
The same is true here where the hearing officer sat as a
substitute for the City Council’s de novo appeal.  The parties stipulated, and the hearing
officer agreed, to her independent review of the evidence.  AR 2295. 
Under the independent review standard, “the trial court not only
examines the administrative record for errors of law but also exercises its
independent judgment upon the evidence disclosed in a limited trial de novo.”  Bixby v. Pierno, (1971) 4 Cal.3d 130,
143.  The court must draw its own reasonable
inferences from the evidence and make its own credibility determinations.  Morrison v. Housing Authority of the City
of Los Angeles Board of Commissioners, (2003) 107 Cal.App.4th 860,
868.  In short, the court substitutes its
judgment for the agency’s regarding the basic facts of what happened, when,
why, and the credibility of witnesses.  Guymon
v. Board of Accountancy, (1976) 55 Cal.App.3d 1010, 1013-16.  
Plainly, the hearing officer failed to conduct an independent
review of the evidence and determine whether Gabaaee met its burden by a
preponderance of the evidence.  A remand
is required.
 
2. The Hearing Officer Erred by Not Considering
Gabaee’s Evidence
Gabaee also argues that the
hearing officer failed to consider its evidence.  Pet. Op. Br. at 11.  This is correct.
The City wrongly argues that
the hearing officer need only review the City’s evidence for substantial
evidence. The hearing officer specified that she was conducting a de novo
review: “Standing in the shoes of the city council and conducting a de novo
hearing . . . means simply that I am to determine if there is substantial
evidence to support the revocation of the business licenses . . . ‘de novo’
review means that the reviewing body independently examines only the existing
record from below and makes its determinations.”  AR 2470. 
Opp. at 14.  
The City argues that under
the substantial evidence standard, the appellate court is not bound by the
trial court’s determinations but instead conducts a de novo examination
of the administrative record to assess whether there is substantial evidence to
support the administrative agency’s findings and whether the findings support
the agency’s decision.”  Breneric Associates v. City of Del Mar,
(1998) 69 Cal.App.4th 166, 174–75.  Opp.
at 14.
The City argues that the
hearing officer was not required to consider Gabaee’s admissible evidence because
that is not what the substantial evidence standard requires.  An appeal under the substantial evidence
standard begins and ends with whether there is substantial evidence to uphold
the prior decision, even if there is substantial evidence supporting a contrary
conclusion:
 
“‘When a trial court’s
factual determination is attacked on the ground that there is no substantial
evidence to sustain it, the power of
an appellate court begins and ends with the determination as to whether, on the
entire record, there is substantial evidence, contradicted or uncontradicted,
which will support the determination, and when two or more
inferences can reasonably be deduced from the facts, a reviewing court is
without power to substitute its deductions for those of the trial court.  If
such substantial evidence be found, it is of no consequence that the trial
court believing other evidence, or drawing other reasonable inferences, might
have reached a contrary conclusion.’”  Sander
v. Superior Court, (“Sander”) (2018) 26 Cal.App.5th 651,
669–70 (citation omitted).
 
The City
concludes that, even if Gabaee had substantial evidence that its business
licenses should have been renewed, that substantial evidence would not meet its
burden.  Gabaee was required to
demonstrate that there is no substantial evidence in support of the City’s
decision not to renew his business licenses and the hearing officer correctly
concluded that substantial evidence supports the City’s decision, which is beginning
and ending of the substantial evidence test. 
AR 2472-77.  Opp. at 15.
The City is
incorrect.  Aside from the hearing
officer’s incorrect conclusion that she should review the evidence under the substantial
evidence standard in her de novo review, she was required to consider
all the evidence.  The City’s own
citation to Sander proves as much “the determination as to whether, on the entire record, there is
substantial evidence….”  Sander, supra,
26 Cal.App.5th at 669-70 (emphasis added).  In determining whether there is substantial
evidence, the trial court considers all evidence in the administrative
record, including evidence that detracts from evidence supporting the agency’s
decision.  California Youth Authority
v. State Personnel Board, (2002) 104 Cal.App.4th 575, 585.  “‘[T]he test of substantiality must be
measured on the basis of the entire record, rather than by simply
isolating evidence which supports the board and ignoring other relevant facts
of record which rebut or explain that evidence.’ [Citations.]” Martori Brothers Distributors v. Agricultural
Labor Relations Bd., (1981) 29 Cal.3d 721, 727 (italics added.)” 
It is clear from the hearing officer’s decision that she
looked only at the City’s evidence to determine if it was substantial.  AR 2472-77. 
This is improper.  The hearing
officer was required to look at all evidence, including evidence detracting
from the City’s evidence, and decide whether Gabaee met its burden of proof by a
preponderance of the evidence.  
 
3. There Was No Due Process Violation
Gabaee argues that it was deprived of the due process right
of notice and opportunity to cure any alleged deficiencies.  
 
a. Due Process
Due process is a
“flexible concept” and the safeguards necessary under specific circumstances
vary.  Ryan v. California
Interscholastic Federation-San Diego Section, (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 1048,
1072.) “Elasticity” is required to “tailor the process to the particular
need.”  Id.  When the government seeks to deprive a
person of property, it must at a minimum provide notice and an opportunity to
be heard.  Beaudreau v. Superior Court, (1975)
14 Cal.3d 448, 458; Krontz v. City of San Diego, (2006) 136 Cal.App.4th
1126, 1141.  
In California, the specific process required in a particular circumstance
generally requires consideration of (1) the private interest that will be
affected by the official action, (2) the risk of an erroneous deprivation of
such interest through the procedures used, and the probable value, if any, of
additional or substitute procedural safeguards, (3) the dignitary interest
in informing individuals of the nature, grounds and consequences of the action
and in enabling them to present their side of the story before a responsible
governmental official, and (4) the governmental interest, including the
function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional
or substitute procedural requirement would entail.”  People v. Ramirez, (1979) 25 Cal.3d 260, 269. 
Except for the additional “dignitary interest”
factor, this balancing test is nearly identical to the one articulated by the
United States Supreme Court in Mathews v. Eldridge,
(1976) 424 U.S. 319, 335.  “Thus we must look to and weigh the various
interests at stake before deciding what procedures are constitutionally
required.” 
Saleeby v. State Bar, (1985) 39 Cal.3d 547, 565.
“The requirements of due process extend to administrative
adjudications.”  Today’s Fresh Start, Inc. v. Los Angeles
County Office of Education, (“Today’s
Fresh Start”) (2013) 57 Cal.4th 197, 214.  While the due process right to a fair and
impartial administrative hearing is absolute, the protections of due process
are far less rigorous in the administrative hearing context: “the bar against
financially interested adjudicators applies with as much force to
administrative adjudicators as to judicial officers.  In many other respects, however,
administrative hearings need not be conducted with the same rigor demanded of
judicial proceedings: “‘(D)ue process allows more flexibility in administrative
process than judicial process.’”  Id.
A due process violation requires a showing of
prejudice.  Krontz v. City of San Diego, (2006) 136 Cal.App.4th
1126, 1141 (delay in notice and opportunity to be heard requires
prejudice).  Prejudice will not be presumed; actual prejudice must be
shown in order to be balanced against a due process violation.  People
v. Belton, (1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 1425, 1433 (delay in filing
criminal charges requires balancing of prejudice against justification for
delay).  “Reversible error requires demonstration of prejudice arising
from the reasonable probability the party ‘would have obtained a better
outcome’ in the absence of the error”.  Fisher
v. State Personnel Bd., (2018) 25 Cal.App.5th 1, 20. 
 
b. Property Right
Gabaee argues that the City violated its due process
rights.  In both administrative hearings,
it argued that its business licenses were property under the 14th
Amendment and subject to due process protection.  AR 232, 1430, 2455, 2463.  The hearing officer concluded that she did
not have jurisdiction to consider this due process claim.  AR 2470. 
Pet. Op. Br. at 11.
The City argues that Gabaee does not have a protected
property interest in the discretionary renewal of its business licenses.  “‘The first inquiry in every due process
challenge is whether the plaintiff has been deprived of a protected interest in
‘property’ or ‘liberty.’  Only after
finding the deprivation of a protected interest do we look to see if the
State's procedures comport with due process.’” Today’s Fresh Start, supra, 57 Cal.4th at 214
(citation omitted).  If an agency has discretion
to grant or deny the benefit, it is not a protected property interest under the
due process clause: “A benefit is not a
protected property interest under the due process clause if the decision maker
has the discretion to grant or deny the benefit.”  Las
Lomas Land Co., LLC, v. City of Los Angeles, (2009) 177 Cal.App.4th 837,
853.  “Whether such discretion exists is
determined by reference to state and local law.”  Id. 
Opp. at 16-17.
The City concludes that, in light of the unsafe conditions
and numerous code violations, the City’s Building Official and Police Chief
exercised their discretion to issue recommendations against the renewal of Gabaee’s
business licenses.  AR 53, 59, 2473-74,
2478.  The City’s ability to exercise its
discretion in either renewing or not renewing the business licenses precludes
them from qualifying as protected property interests under the due process
clause.  Because the City had the
discretion to grant or deny the renewal of Gabaee’s business licenses, it does
not have a protected property interest and the due process inquiry ends.  Opp. at 16-18.
The City would be correct for a simple business license
application or non-renewal not linked to revocation.  But the HMC scheme treats non-renewal as a
revocation in HMC sections 5.15.020 and 5.02.100(A), thus creating a property
right in renewal of a longstanding business license.  The court will assume the existence of a property
right for purposes of analysis.
 
c. The City Provided Due Process
Gabaee argues that it was deprived of the due process right
of notice and opportunity to cure any alleged deficiencies.  The City has never provided Gabaee with a
detailed listing of the specific matters that the City contends separately and
individually constitute purported violations of the HMC.  AR 336 (Gabay, Decl, ¶35).              Gabaee
argued this omission in both the first and second administrative hearing.  AR 232, 1430. 
Gabaee identified several statutes relied upon by the City that statutorily
require notice and opportunity to cure (AR 1430)[1]
and the City disagreed on the basis that its ordinances
do not require notice and opportunity to cure deficiencies (AR 2330).  Pet. Op. Br. at 11.
Gabaee argues that HMC section 5.16.020 provides several
grounds for refusing to renew (or revoking) a business license.  The City does not have to comply with the due
process rights of notice and opportunity to cure to the extent its reason for non-renewal
(or revocation) is based on a reason to which the legislative body has not attached
a due process right of notice and opportunity to cure deficiencies in the applicable
ordinance (e.g., false statement).  On the other hand, as in this case, where the
City refuses to renew (or revoke) the business license for failure to comply
with provisions that include the due process right of notice and opportunity to
cure deficiencies, the City cannot use HMC section 5.16.020 to unlawfully
circumvent Gabaee’s rights.  Pet. Op. Br.
at 12.
The City satisfied the requirements of due process because Gabaee
had the opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner,
which is what is required.  HMC section 5.16.030
required the City to give Gabaee five days’ notice of the grounds for
revocation or suspension and the time and place of hearing for Gabaee to show
cause why the licenses should not be revoked. 
AR 2.  That is what occurred.  On February 24, 2022, the City sent Gabaee a written
notification of the basis for the proposed action not to renew its business
licenses.  AR 1-2.  The notice was well before the March 29, 2022
hearing.  See AR 683-84.  Thus, prior to the March 29, 2022
administrative hearing, Gabaee knew the bases for the City’s proposed refusal
to renew its business licenses and had the opportunity to respond in writing
and present oral argument.  AR 219-553 (written
opposition and evidence), 554-657 (transcript of March 29, 2022 hearing).  The City then provided Gabaee with a de
novo appeal on May 31, 2022.  AR 2240,
2465.  Again, Gabaee had the opportunity
to be heard in a meaningful manner, and it presented extensive oral and written
argument and evidence.  AR 1421-29 (supplemental
authorities and evidence), 2236-312 [transcript of May 31, 2022 hearing),
2453-64 (Petitioner’s reply brief).  
By allowing Petitioner to be heard at a meaningful time and
in a meaningful manner, the City complied with Petitioner’s due process rights.  Opp. at 18-19.  Gabaee does not really dispute that it had
adequate notice and opportunity to be heard. 
Instead, it relies on a nebulous right to cure.  Yet, Gabaee fails to show both that due
process requires an opportunity to cure and what statutes or ordinances provide
a cure opportunity.  Gabaee was not
denied due process.
 
4. Sufficiency of the Evidence
The City argues that there
is sufficient evidence to uphold the City’s refusal to renew Gabaee’s business
licenses.  On March 25, September 28, and
October 7, 2021, City inspectors from both the Code Enforcement Department and
Department of Building and Safety conducted inspections of the Property,
observing and confirming a litany of unlawful, dangerous, and substandard
conditions at the Property: 
·                    
the Property has
accumulated mold, trash, debris, and animal waste; 
·                    
the Property is
replete with exposed and loose electrical wires and fixtures and exposed
electrical switches and outlets, increasing the risk of fires and electric
shock; 
·                    
the exterior and underground
parking lot are filled with large amounts of accumulated and scattered trash
and debris, posing sanitation hazards and vermin and insect infestation risks; 
·                    
the Property is
replete with fire hazards, including loose and dangling electrical wiring,
accumulated junk and debris that would fuel any fire, and inoperable and
inadequate fire extinguishing equipment including unsecured fire hose cabinets
with missing covers and hoses; 
·                    
the exterior of
the Property is dilapidated and has been improperly maintained with graffiti,
urine, feces, pungent odors, and signs of water intrusion; 
·                    
the Property is
completely gutted in a state of partial construction and demolition with
missing and dilapidated walls, floors, ceilings, and railings and having only
bare structural elements, compromising the integrity of the entire building and
exposing entrants to falling and safety hazards; 
·                    
the Property has
incomplete and unpermitted structural work; 
·                    
the Property has
obstructed egress routes, increasing the risk of injury to occupants and first
responders during an emergency and preventing first responders from efficiently
responding to an emergency; 
·                    
the ceiling of
the Property is missing and unfinished, exposing the interior, electrical
wiring, air ducts, and other components leading to water damage, vermin
intrusion, and mold growth; 
·                    
the interior of
the Property is filled with stagnant water puddles, feces, and urine; 
·                    
the Property has
exposed, broken, and dilapidated plumbing throughout, which does not protect
against leaks or other defects and can cause water and sewer leakages;
·                    
the Property
shows signs of water intrusion and damage, including water stains and
electrical shortages caused by water intrusion, which weaken the structural
components of the building, cause mold growth, and create fire and electrical
hazards; and
·                    
the Property has
missing light fixtures throughout the interior, posing tripping and falling
hazards due to the lack of light.  AR
25-34, 43-51, 100-83.  
These
conditions not only violate the HMC but also the Health and Safety Code, the
California Building Code, the Uniform Code for Abatement of Dangerous
Buildings, the California Plumbing Code, the California Electrical Code, and
the California Fire Code.  AR 25-34,
43-51.  The Property also has become a
hub for crime, break-ins by transients and youths, illegal trash dumping, the
burning of refuse.  AR 23-24, 41-42.  The Property “is a magnet for criminal
activities” and has an “established reputation in the neighborhood, and within
the community, as a place where teenagers and homeless individuals camp or
loiter, consume alcohol, and ingest drugs.” 
AR 57.  Several fires have broken
out at the Property, including a massive fire on January 26, 2022.  AR 24, 28, 35-36, 184-96.  The City has received numerous and persistent
complaints from the public about the Property -- approximately 500 calls
between 2017 and 2022.  AR 23-24, 57-58,
197-218.  Opp. at 10-12.
In response to Gabaee’s
contentions that it had remediated these violations after the March 29, 2022
hearing, the City conducted inspections of the exterior of the Property from
public rights-of-way on June 6 and June 7, 2022.  Gabaee would not allow City staff to inspect
the interior of the Property.  AR 2343,
2348, 2353-54.  Code Enforcement Officer
Alex Martinez observed numerous deficiencies. 
AR 2353-54, 2358-401.  Code
Enforcement Officer Lugo and Building Inspector Shahryari reviewed the permit
records and other files and records on the Subject Property and noted that
Petitioner had not applied for and obtained any of the necessary permits that
would have been required to rehabilitate the Property and any unpermitted work
would still leave the Property in substandard and dangerous condition in
violation of HMC section 5.16.020.  AR
2342-44, 2347-50.  Opp. at 12-13.
The City’s evidence is
admissible and relevant to establish violations because the declarations and
supporting exhibits are all based on staff’s training, expertise, personal
knowledge, and observations.  AR 22-25,
36, 39-43 (Oscar Lugo, Code Enforcement Officer), 55-57 (Michael Ishii, Police
Chief), 2341-42 (Lugo), 2346-47 (Khosrou Shahryari, Building Inspector, 2352-54
(Alex Martinez, Code Enforcement Officer). 
Opp. at 13.
            Gabaee argues that the City’s declarations
comprise of nothing more than inadmissible speculation, assumptions, legal
argument and conclusions, and inadmissible lay and expert conclusions without
any foundation.  They are also misleading.  The City is fully aware that the Property has
been vacant (except for the occupied portion) and reduced to its primary
structural elements for over 20 years. 
There is no electricity nor water (except for the fire suppression
system) in the unoccupied portion.  The
City’s declarations of risks of electrical shock and from exposed plumbing therefore
lack factual support.  Pet. Op. Br. at
13.
The Calls for Service to 12000 Hawthorne Blvd fail to
describe the nature of the call.  The
court and parties can only speculate as to the reason for any police response
to the Property – e.g., jaywalking, loitering, graffiti, and/or traffic
stops.  The accuracy of the Police
Chief’s declaration also is suspect when he refers to “family disturbances” considering
the nature and vacancy of the Property.  AR
58.  Lastly, the Property was a magnet
for crime long before Gabaee acquired the Mall and made improvements.  Pet. Op. Br. at 13-14.
            Gabaee argues that the pictures are
the only real evidence.  AR 100-18 (March
2021 Inspection Photos), AR 119-58 (September 2021 Inspection Photos), AR 159-83
(         January 2022 Photos), AR
2358-401 (June 7, 2022 Photos).  However,
the earlier pictures in March and September 2021, and in January 2022, show
only the accumulation of debris and trash in the interior left by the last film
crew, and an exterior left by passer-byers, an over-grown landscape, and gating
needing repairs.  No dangerous condition,
vacancy or unreasonable use of the Property is shown.  The pictures also fail to account for the continuous
maintenance of the Property; the June 2022 pictures show the improved results
of Gabaee’s updated maintenance.  Contrary
to the City’s baseless allegations, the Property is not dilapidated, decaying,
demolished or falling down.  There are no
infestations of birds, vermin, or homeless encampments.  For over 20 years, the Property has had and
presently has an excellent safety record. 
Pet. Op. Br. at 12-14.
The court cannot address the parties’ arguments concerning the
sufficiency of the evidence -- meaning whether Gabaee met its burden of proof.  As stated ante, the hearing officer is
required to consider all the evidence, including Gabaee’s evidence undermining
the City’s evidence, as well as its arguments distinguishing the occupied and
unoccupied areas of the Property and improved maintenance.  Yet, the hearing officer applied the wrong
standard to her review and also failed to consider all the evidence.  As a result, the court lacks proper
underlying findings from which to evaluate the facts and determine the
sufficiency of the evidence.
 
F. Conclusion
The hearing officer failed to proceed in the manner required
by law and the Petition is granted.  A
judgment and writ will issue remanding the matter to the City and directing it to
independently consider and evaluate all the evidence and determine whether
Gabaee has met its burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence.
Petitioner Gabaee’s counsel is ordered to prepare a proposed
judgment and writ, serve them on the City’s counsel for approval as to form,
wait ten days after service for any objections, meet and confer if there are
objections, and then submit the proposed judgment and writ along with a
declaration stating the existence/non-existence of any unresolved objections.  An OSC re: judgment is set for September 19,
2024 at 9:30 a.m.
