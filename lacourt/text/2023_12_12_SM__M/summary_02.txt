Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motions to compel the plaintiff's responses to special interrogatories, form interrogatories, and request for inspection demands. The judge has also granted the motion to deem requests for admissions as admitted by the plaintiff. The plaintiff failed to respond to the discovery requests, and the judge has ordered the plaintiff to respond without objections within 10 days.

The judge has also granted the defendant's request for sanctions in the reduced total amount of $1,815.00, inclusive of costs, against the plaintiff. The plaintiff failed to oppose the motion for sanctions, and the judge has found that the plaintiff acted without substantial justification. The sanctions are to be paid to the defendant's counsel within 30 days.
