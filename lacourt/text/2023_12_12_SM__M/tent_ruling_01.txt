HEARING DATE:   12/12/2023

 
Legal
Standard
 
            A receiver must present by
noticed motion or stipulation of all parties: (1) a final account and report;
(2) a request for the discharge; and (3) a request for exoneration of the
receiver's surety.  (CRC 3.1184(a).)  Notice of the motion or of the
stipulation must be given to every person or entity known to the receiver to
have a substantial, unsatisfied claim that will be affected by the order or
stipulation, whether or not the person or entity is a party to the action or
has appeared in it.  (CRC 3.1184(c).) Any objections must be brought
at the discharge hearing, otherwise they are waived. (Aviation Brake
Systems, Ltd. v. Voorhis (1982) 133 Cal.App.3d 230, 232, 235.) The
trial court has the discretion to fix the compensation for a receiver. (Melikian
v. Aquila, Ltd. (1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 1364, 1368.) Generally, a receiver's
compensation is chargeable on and is to be paid from the fund in the receiver's
possession. (Stanton v. Pratt (1941) 18 Cal.2d 599, 603 [if the
fund be insufficient, “he may then look to the parties at whose instance he was
appointed”].)
 
Receivers are entitled to compensation for their own
services and the services performed by their attorneys. (Venza v. Venza
(1951) 101 Cal.App.2d 678, 680.)¿Generally, the costs of a receivership are
paid from the property in the receivership estate. (Andrade v. Andrade
(1932) 216 Cal. 108, 110.) In the court’s discretion, the receiver costs may be
imposed on a party who sought the appointment of the receiver or who benefited
from the receivership. (Baldwin v. Baldwin (1947) 82 Cal.App.2d 851,
856.)¿ 
 
Analysis
 
Court-appointed Receiver Ryan C.
Baker moves for approval of his final report, discharge of the receivership,
exoneration of the receiver’s bond and approval of the receiver’s final request
for attorneys’ fees.
 
            The instant motion is
unopposed. In the Receiver’s Final Account and Report, as well as the
Receiver’s prior nine monthly reports, the Receiver demonstrates that he has
fulfilled his appointed duties to safeguard and maximize value of the
receivership property for the secured creditor’s benefit. Specifically, the Receiver’s
declaration and reports show that he fulfilled: (1) maintaining and marketing
the Licenses; (2) obtaining the City’s and the Court’s approval to sell the
Licenses; (3) completing a sale of the Licenses and other personal property to
a buyer who was qualified to operate a cannabis retail operations and completed
construction on the Premises; and (4) administering the remaining assets by
assigning such assets to the Plaintiff in partial satisfaction of its Aeon
Loan. (Baker Decl., ¶ 11.) The Receiver was able to realize significant
recovery for Aeon WeHo’s secured creditor. (¶ 12.) The Court concurs that
without the Receiver’s actions, the Licenses would have likely had zero value
to the estate.
 
As to fees, the Receiver’s counsel,
ArentFox Schiff LLP, provided monthly invoices. Such invoices were covered by
the monthly Receiver Reports and were paid without objection by the Receiver.
(Baker Decl., ¶ 16.) Since the inception of the receivership case on October
13, 2022, through October 31, 2023, the Receiver incurred $216,778.07 in fees
and expenses. (Baker Decl., ¶ 14.) Of these fees, $209,291.31 are paid, leaving
an unpaid balance of $5,176.76. (Id.) Since its engagement in March 2023, ArentFox
incurred $216,710.95 in fees and expenses. (Baker Decl., ¶ 15.) Of these fees,
$214,571.45 have been paid, leaving an unpaid balance of $2,139.50. (Id.) The
details of the fees and costs incurred by the Receiver and his counsel for the
period October 2022 through October 2023 have been circulated to the Plaintiff
through the Receiver’s monthly reports filed with the Court. As noted, there
are no objections submitted to the fees and expenses of the Receiver and his
counsel. Reviewing the records, and given the success of the receivership, the
Court finds these fees reasonable and approves payment of the unpaid balances
identified above. 
 
The Receiver established a reserve
of $800,000. The Court approves the Receiver’s authority to disburse the
remaining reserve funds to Plaintiff after payment of all administrative
expenses, including the Receiver’s and his professional’s fees and costs. 
 
Receiver also demonstrates that all
interested persons have been given notice of this motion. (Baker Decl., ¶ 17.) 
 
Accordingly, the Court will approve
the Final Report and Accounting, fully discharge the Receiver, and exonerate
his bond as requested.
