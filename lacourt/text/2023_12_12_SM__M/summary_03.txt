And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by the defendant, Penz LLC, to the complaint filed by the plaintiff, Whitaker. The defendant argued that the plaintiff failed to state a claim for relief under the Unruh Civil Rights Act and the California Disabled Persons Act, and that the plaintiff lacked standing to bring the suit. The judge has ruled that the demurrer is OVERRULED.

The judge found that the plaintiff has pled sufficient facts to establish a nexus between his disability and the alleged barrier, and that the complaint complies with the requirements of CCP section 425.50. The judge also found that the plaintiff has alleged a genuine intent to patronize the defendant's business, and that the demurrer to injunctive relief is improper.

The judge noted that the plaintiff is a physically disabled quadriplegic who uses a wheelchair for mobility, and that the defendant operates "Main Squeeze" in Santa Monica. The judge found that the plaintiff alleged that he was denied full and equal access because the defendant failed to provide accessible dining surfaces, and that this violation also violates the ADA accessibility standards. The judge concluded that the plaintiff has pled sufficient facts to state a claim for relief under the Unruh Act and the ADA, and that the demurrer is OVERRULED.
