Legal
Standard
 
            A
demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the complaint states a cause of action.
(Hahn v. Mirda (2007)
147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) When considering demurrers, courts read the
allegations liberally and in context. In a demurrer proceeding, the defects
must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial notice. (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co.
(2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not
the evidence or other extrinsic matters. Therefore, it lies only where the
defects appear on the face of the pleading or are judicially noticed. (CCP §§
430.30, 430.70.) At the pleading stage, a plaintiff need only allege ultimate
facts sufficient to apprise the defendant of the factual basis for the claim
against him. (Semole v. Sansoucie
(1972) 28 Cal. App. 3d 714, 721.) A “demurrer does not, however, admit
contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law alleged in the pleading,
or the construction of instruments pleaded, or facts impossible in law.” (S. Shore Land Co. v. Petersen
(1964) 226 Cal.App.2d 725, 732, internal citations omitted.)
 
            A
special demurrer for uncertainty is disfavored and will only be sustained where
the pleading is so bad that defendant cannot reasonably respond—i.e., cannot
reasonably determine what issues must be admitted or denied, or what counts or
claims are directed against him/her. (CCP § 430.10(f); Khoury v. Maly’s
of Calif., Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.) Moreover, even if
the pleading is somewhat vague, “ambiguities can be clarified under modern
discovery procedures.” (Ibid.)

 
            “Liberality in permitting amendment
is the rule, if a fair opportunity to correct any defect has not been given.” (Angie
M. v. Superior Court (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1217, 1227.) It is an abuse of
discretion for the court to deny leave to amend where there is any reasonable
possibility that plaintiff can state a good cause of action. (Goodman v.
Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 349.) The burden is on plaintiff to
show in what manner plaintiff can amend the complaint,
and how that amendment will change the legal effect of the
pleading. (Id.)
 
Analysis
 
Defendant Penz LLC demurs to the entirety of the complaint on the grounds
that Plaintiff fails to state a claim for relief under the Unruh Civil Rights
Act (Civ. Code §§ 51-53) or the California Disabled Persons Act (Civ. Code §
54). The Unruh Act is
a public accommodations statute that focuses on discriminatory behavior by
business establishments. (Civil Code § 51(b); Stamps v. Superior Court
(2006) 136 Cal.App.4th 1441, 1452.) The Unruh Act provides that all persons in
California are entitled to the full and equal accommodations, advantages,
facilities, privileges, or services in all business establishments of every
kind whatsoever, “no matter what their sex, race, color, religion, ancestry,
national origin, disability, medical condition, genetic information, marital
status, sexual orientation, citizenship, primary language, or immigration
status…” (Civ. Code, § 51(b); see also § 54.1 [entitling disabled individuals
to full and equal access to public accommodations].) Anyone who “denies, aids
or incites a denial, or makes any discrimination or distinction contrary to
[Unruh]” is liable for damages and penalties.¿(Civ. Code,¿§§ 52(a); 54.3.) 
 
Generally, a plaintiff seeking to
establish a case under Unruh Act must plead intentional discrimination in
public accommodations in violation of the terms of the Act. (Harris v.
Capital Growth Investors XIV¿(1991) 52 Cal.3d 1142, 1175.)  However, there is no requirement to prove
intentional discrimination under Unruh provisions incorporating rights under
the Americans with Disabilities Act. (Munson v. Del Taco, Inc. (2009) 46
Cal.4th 661.) Thus, if plaintiff demonstrates a violation of the ADA, plaintiff
need not allege intentional discrimination.
 
The ADA prohibits discrimination against
disabilities in the full and equal enjoyment of services, facilities, and
accommodations of a place of public accommodation by any person who owns,
leases, or operates a place of public accommodation. (42 U.S.C. § 12182(a).)
Discrimination under the ADA includes “a failure to remove architectural
barriers, and communication barriers that are structural in nature, in existing
facilities… where such removal is readily achievable…” and a failure to provide
auxiliary aids and services, unless it would result in an undue burden. (42
U.S.C. § 12182(b)(2)(A)(iii), (iv).) Whether a facility provides full and equal
access is defined in part by the ADA Accessibility Guidelines. (28 C.F.R. pt.
36, app. A; Chapman v. Pier 1 Imports (U.S.) Inc. (9th Cir. 2015)
779 F.3d 1001, 1006.)  
 
Defendant argues that Plaintiff fails to plead his disability and
connect that disability to a pled barrier. To the contrary, the complaint alleges that Plaintiff is a physically
disabled quadriplegic and uses a wheelchair for mobility. (Compl., ¶ 1.) Defendant
operates “Main Squeeze” located in Santa Monica. (¶¶ 2-3.) On February 18, 2023,
Plaintiff went to Main Squeeze to avail himself of its goods, services,
privileges or advantages, motivated in part to determine if Defendant
complied with disability access laws. (¶ 8.) While there, Plaintiff observed
that there was “not enough knee and toe clearance under the outdoor dining
surfaces”. (¶ 11.) Plaintiff was denied full and equal access because Defendant
failed to provide accessible dining surfaces and was therefore unable to eat or
drink without difficulty. (¶¶ 13.) Plaintiff also pleads throughout the
complaint that the accessibility issue also violates the ADA accessibility
standards. (¶¶ 10, 12, 14, 26, 30, 33.) The cited barrier is “easily removed
without much difficulty or expense” and there are alternative accommodations
that could be made to provide a greater level of access. (¶ 19.) These
averments provide, in plain terms, that there was a nexus between his
disability (being a wheelchair-bound quadriplegic) and the pled barrier
(insufficient clearance knee and toe for the wheelchair). Therefore, the required
nexus is well pled.
 
Defendant argues that Plaintiff has not pled compliance with CCP section
425.50. However, the complaint provides each of the statutorily required
statements. Plaintiff states that he qualifies as a high-frequency litigant. (¶
24.) In the preceding year, he filed approximately 421 lawsuits alleging
violations of construction-related accessibility standards. (¶ 25.) On February
18, 2023, Plaintiff was in the area, in part, because he was acting as a
“tester” visiting businesses “in the same manner as a potential customer” to
confirm Defendant’s compliance with accessibility laws. (¶ 26.) “Plaintiff visited
the subject business for the purpose of testing facility compliance with
accessibility laws with the intention to use the Benefits of the facility in
the same manner as a customer.” (¶ 27.) Further, Plaintiff expressly pleads
that he had an “intent” to use Defendant’s facilities, including its goods and
services. (¶¶ 8, 31.) Thus, the complaint complies with section 425.50.
 
Defendant argues that Plaintiff does not have standing to bring this suit
unless he alleges a genuine intent to patronize the business. Recent caselaw reveals
that an Unruh Act plaintiff would need to prove such intent to win their case
at trial. (Thurston v. Omni Hotels Management Corporation (2021)
69 Cal.App.5th 299, 309; see also Smith v. BP Lubricants USA
Inc. (2021) 64 Cal.App.5th 138, 149 [Unruh claims are appropriate where the
plaintiff “was in a relationship with the offending organization similar to
that of the customer in the customer-proprietor relationship”].) Defendant
points to Plaintiff’s intent to be a “tester.” However, Plaintiff pleads that
this was only part of his motivation for going to Main Squeeze. Plaintiff also
expressly pleads an “intent” to avail
himself of Defendant’s goods and services. (¶¶ 8, 27, 31.) There is no
requirement that Plaintiff allege the specific service or good sought, only
that he genuinely intended to patronize Defendant. The factual allegations of
Plaintiff’s intent meet this requirement and cannot be disputed at the pleading
stage.  
 
Finally, Defendant argues that
Plaintiff cannot seek injunctive relief because Plaintiff has not alleged a
future desire to patronize the Defendant's business. However, a demurrer is only
proper when it attacks an entire cause of action. Striking this relief would
not defeat an entire cause of action. Therefore, the demurrer to injunctive
relief is improper.
 
Accordingly, the demurrer is OVERRULED.
