LLC v. Noorani, et al.
CASE NO.:                23SMCV01384
MOTION:                  Motion
to Compel Initial Discovery Responses 
HEARING DATE:   12/12/2023

 
Legal
Standard
 
Where
there has been no timely response to a Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) section 2031.010
inspection demand, the demanding party must seek an order compelling a
response. (CCP § 2031.300.) Failure to timely respond waives all objections,
including privilege and work product. Thus, unless the party to whom the demand
was directed obtains relief from waiver, he or she cannot raise objections to
the documents demanded. There is no deadline for a motion to compel responses.
Likewise, for failure to respond, the moving party need not attempt to resolve
the matter outside court before filing the motion. Where the motion seeks only
a response to the inspection demand, no showing of "good cause" is
required.
 
If a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to
serve a timely response, the propounding party may move for an order compelling responses and for a monetary sanction. (CCP § 2030.290(b).) The
statute contains no time limit for a motion to compel where no responses have
been served. All that need be shown in the moving papers is that a set of
interrogatories was properly served on the opposing party, that the time to
respond has expired, and that no response of any kind has been served. (Leach
v. Superior Court (1980) 111 Cal. App. 3d 902, 905-906.) 
 
Pursuant to CCP section 2033.280(b), a party may move for
an order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters
specified in the requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). “Failure to timely
respond to RFA does not result in automatic admissions. Rather, the propounder of the RFA
must ‘move for an order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of
any matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a
monetary sanction’ under § 2023.010 et seq.” (CCP, § 2033.280(b).) The court
“shall” grant the motion to deem RFA admitted, “unless it finds that the party
to whom the requests for admission have been directed has served, before the
hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests for admission that
is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220.” (CCP, § 2033.280(c).) 
 
Analysis
 
            Defendant Behnaz Noorani moves to
compel Plaintiff Elm Drive LLC’s responses to the following sets of discovery:
1) Special interrogatories, set one; 2) Form interrogatories, set one; and 3)
Request for Inspection Demands, Set One. Defendant also moves to deem Requests
for Admissions, set one, as admitted by Plaintiff. As to each motion, Defendant
requests sanctions of $1,050.00 against Plaintiff.  
 
            On May 19, 2023, Defendant served
Plaintiff the above sets of discovery. (Michalak Decls., ¶¶ 5, Exs. A-B.) To
date, Plaintiff has not responded to the above discovery. Given Plaintiff’s failure
to respond, the motions to compel are GRANTED and the motion to deem matters
admitted is GRANTED.  Further responses
are due without objections within 10 days.
 
Monetary sanctions are mandatory,
unless the imposition of sanctions would be unjust or the party subject to the
sanctions acted with substantial justification. (CCP § 2030.290(c).) Plaintiff
failed to oppose, and therefore failed to justify their non-response to the
discovery. 
 
Defendant requests $1,050.00 per
motion in sanctions. Defense counsel declares that each motion took
approximately 1.5 hours to prepare, serve, and file, and that he anticipates
the hearing on the motions to take at least an additional .5 hour, at an hourly
rate of $525.00. (Michalak Decl., ¶¶ 10.) The Court finds the requested fees
excessive and duplicative considering that the motions were relatively simple
and substantially overlapped. Accordingly, Defendant’s request for sanctions is
GRANTED in the reduced total amount of $1,815.00, inclusive
of costs, against Plaintiff. Sanctions to be paid to Defendant’s counsel within
30 days.
