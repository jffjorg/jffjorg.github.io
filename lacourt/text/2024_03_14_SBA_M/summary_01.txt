And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants the plaintiff's motion to vacate the dismissal of the case due to the mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect of the plaintiff's counsel. The plaintiff's counsel failed to properly calendar a hearing on July 13, 2023, resulting in the case being dismissed. The judge finds that the dismissal was caused by the counsel's neglect and not by the defendant's alleged delays in proceeding with procedural requirements. The case is restored to the active calendar, and the plaintiff is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
