The demurrer to the second cause of action for violations of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act is sustained with 20 days leave to amend, as plaintiff has failed to allege specific facts to state a cause of action.

The demurrer to the third cause of action for violations of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act is sustained with 20 days leave to amend, as plaintiff has failed to allege any facts to show that she was discriminated against due to a protected class.

The demurrer to the fourth cause of action for usury is overruled, as plaintiff has alleged sufficient facts to state a cause of action.

The demurrer to the fifth cause of action for violations of California Business and Professions Code ยง 17200, et seq. is overruled, as plaintiff has alleged sufficient facts to state a cause of action.

The demurrer to the sixth cause of action for financial abuse of elder is sustained with 20 days leave to amend, as plaintiff has failed to allege specific facts to state a cause of action.
