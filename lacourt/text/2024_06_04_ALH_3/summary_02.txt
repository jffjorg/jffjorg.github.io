The plaintiff, Uni-Glory Development, Inc., has alleged that the defendant, Fairview East, LLC, and others, have breached their contracts and caused damages. The plaintiff has submitted supporting papers, but the Court finds that the application for default judgment is deficient in several ways.

The Court has ordered the plaintiff to revise and resubmit the supporting papers, and has continued the hearing to July 12, 2024.
