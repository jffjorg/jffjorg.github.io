And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

"The Court grants the motion to seal portions of the Orloff MSJ Declaration and Exhibit BB. The motion was made by the defendants, Harley-Davidson Motor Company Group, LLC, and TMCHB, Inc. dba Huntington Beach Harley-Davidson, to protect confidential information regarding the seat mounting system for the motorcycle model. The information is labeled as restricted and confidential and includes engineering drawings for the motorcycle seat. The Court finds that there exists an overriding interest in maintaining the proprietary and confidential nature of the information, and that the defendants' interest in sealing the information overcomes the right of the public access to the records. The proposed sealing is narrowly tailored and the least restrictive means available to protect the defendants' interest. The motion is granted, and the following portions of the Orloff MSJ Declaration are sealed: page 4, lines 12 through 18, page 8, lines 1 through 8 and 21 through 27, page 10, lines 3 through 10, and Exhibit BB."
