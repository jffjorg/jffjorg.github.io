1.              
Minor’s
Compromise (i.e., as to Sawyer S.)
 
Legal
Standard
 
Court approval is required
for all settlements of a minor’s claim.  (Prob. Code §§ 3500, 3600, et
seq.; Code Civ. Proc., § 372.) 
California Rules of Court Rule 7.950 provides that a petition “must be
verified by the petitioner and must contain a full disclosure of all
information that has any bearing upon the reasonableness of the
compromise.”  (See Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 7.950.)  Rule 7.950 states that the
Petition must be filed on a completed Petition for Approval of Compromise of
Claim or Action or Disposition of Proceeds of Judgment for Minor or Person With
a Disability (form MC-350).

The court
has reviewed the Petition to Approve Compromise of Disputed Claim of Minor. The
court finds the settlement reasonable, but a petition for minor claimant Sawyer
S. has not been filed which precludes the court from granting the petition at this
time.
 
The petition
is DENIED.
