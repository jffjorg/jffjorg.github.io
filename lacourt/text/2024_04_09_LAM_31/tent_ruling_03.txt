MOTION
TO VACATE CONDITIONAL DISMISSAL AND FOR ENTRY OF JUDGMENT PURSUANT TO CODE OF
CIVIL PROCEDURE SECTION 664.6



 
MOVING PARTY:               Plaintiff
American Express National Bank
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     No opposition
 
 
I.          BACKGROUND
 
            This is a collections case. 
On October 10, 2023, Plaintiff, American Express National Bank, filed a complaint
against Defendants, Jonathan Dahan and MMC Agency Inc.
 
            On December
12, 2023, Plaintiff filed the parties’ Stipulation for the Court to Dismiss the
Case and Retain Jurisdiction Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure Section 664.6
(“Stipulation”).  On the same day, the court
dismissed the case without prejudice and retained jurisdiction to enforce the terms
of the settlement and enter judgment in the event of default. 
 
            On February
9, 2024, Plaintiff filed this Motion to Vacate the Conditional Dismissal and
for Entry of Judgment Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure Section 664.6. 
 
            The motion
is unopposed.
 
II.        LEGAL STANDARD
 
“If parties to pending litigation
stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties outside the presence of the court
or orally before the court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the
court, upon motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the
settlement.¿ If requested by the parties, the court may retain jurisdiction
over the parties to enforce the settlement until performance in full of the
terms of the settlement.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6.)¿¿¿ 
 
In hearing a section 664.6 motion,
the trial court may receive evidence, determine disputed facts, and enter terms
of a settlement agreement as a judgment.¿ (Bowers v. Raymond J. Lucia
Companies, Inc. (2012) 206 Cal.App.4th 724, 732.)¿ The court may interpret
the terms and conditions to settlement (Fiore v. Alvord (1985) 182
Cal.App.3d 561, 566), but the court may not create material terms of a
settlement, as opposed to deciding what terms the parties themselves have
previously agreed upon (Weddington Productions, Inc. v. Flick (1998) 60
Cal.App.4th 793, 810).¿ The party seeking to enforce a settlement “must first
establish the agreement at issue was set forth ‘in a writing signed by the
parties’ (§ 664.6) or was made orally before the court. [Citation.]”¿ (Harris
v. Rudin, Richman & Appel (1999) 74 Cal.App.4th 299, 304 [holding that
a letter confirming the essential terms of a settlement agreement was not a
“writing signed by the parties” sufficient to satisfy the requirements of
Section 664.6].)¿ 
 
III.      DISCUSSION
 
A. Retention of Jurisdiction 
 
“‘[V]oluntary dismissal of an action or special proceeding
terminates the court’s jurisdiction over the matter.’  (Conservatorship
of Martha P. (2004) 117 Cal.App.4th 857, 867) [12 Cal.Rptr.3d 142.) ‘If
requested by the parties,’ however, ‘the [trial] court may retain
jurisdiction over the parties to enforce [a] settlement until performance in
full of the terms of the settlement.’ (§ 664.6, italics added.)”  (Mesa
RHF Partners, L.P. v. City of Los Angeles (2019) 33 Cal.App.5th 913,
917.)  “‘Because of its summary nature, strict compliance with the
requirements of section 664.6 is prerequisite to invoking the power of the
court to impose a settlement agreement.’”  (Ibid. (quoting Sully-Miller
Contracting Co. v. Gledson/Cashman Construction, Inc. (2002) 103
Cal.App.4th 30, 37).) 
 
“A request for the trial court to retain jurisdiction under
section 664.6 ‘must conform to the same three requirements which the
Legislature and the courts have deemed necessary for section 664.6 enforcement
of the settlement itself: the request must be made (1) during the pendency of
the case, not after the case has been dismissed in its entirety, (2) by the
parties themselves, and (3) either in a writing signed by the parties or orally
before the court.’”  (Ibid. (quoting Wackeen v. Malis (2002)
97 Cal.App.4th 429, 440).)  “The ‘request must be express, not implied
from other language, and it must be clear and unambiguous.’” (Ibid. (quoting
Wackeen, supra, 97 Cal.App.4th at 440).) 
 
Here, the parties signed a Stipulation containing the
parties’ agreement for the court to retain jurisdiction pursuant to Code of
Civil Procedure section 664.6 to enforce the terms of the Stipulation and enter
judgment in the event of default.  (Stipulation ¶¶ 12,¿13.)  Prior to the
dismissal of this action, the Stipulation was signed by the parties and
submitted to the court. (Ibid.)  On December 12, 2023, the court
dismissed the entire case pursuant to the Stipulation.  The court has jurisdiction to enforce the
terms of the Stipulation.
 
B. Entry of Judgment 
 
The Stipulation provides that Plaintiff and Defendant agree
to dismiss the action without prejudice on the premise that Defendant will
compensate Plaintiff for the settlement amount of $391.937.67, consisting of monthly
payments of $500.00 from December 2023 to May 2024; thereafter, monthly
payments of $1,000 from June 2024 to November 2024; thereafter, monthly
payments of $15,955.73 from December 2024 to October 2026; then, one final
payment of $15,955.88 due on or before November 6, 2026. (Stipulation, ¶ 6.) 
All parties signed the Stipulation. 
 
The Stipulation also provides that in the event Defendants
fails to make timely payments, Plaintiff will give Defendants written mail
notice of the default and ten (10) days from the mailing to cure the default.  If the default is not cured, the court can
enter a judgment against Defendants pursuant to motion in the amount of $391,937.67
plus costs; Defendants shall receive a credit for any payments made under the
Stipulation.  (Ibid. at ¶¶ 5, 12, 13.)  
 
Defendants have not made any payments under the
Stipulation.  Plaintiff now seeks an
order vacating the conditional dismissal and entering judgment against
Defendants in the sum of $393,370.67, consisting of $391,937.67 in damages and
$1,433.00 in costs.  
 
Plaintiff substantiates the damages sought.  On January 26, 2024, Plaintiff sent written
notice to Defendants to cure the default. 
(See Pyle Decl., Ex. B.) 
Defendants have not cured the default. 
However, Plaintiff has not submitted a Memorandum of Costs to support the
request for costs of $1,433.00.
 
IV.       CONCLUSION 
 
Accordingly, the motion is CONTINUED to May 3, 2024 to allow
Plaintiff to file a Memorandum of Costs. 
 
 
Moving party to give notice.
