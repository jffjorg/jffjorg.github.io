Here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge Kerry Bensinger regarding a motion to compel further responses to discovery requests. The case, Ian W. Brooks v. Russell S. Balisok, et al., is a legal malpractice action arising out of Defendants' representation of Plaintiff in an underlying elder abuse action. The Plaintiff seeks to compel further responses to requests for production of documents, Set Two, Nos. 17-20, which were served on September 27, 2023. The Defendants, Russell S. Balisok and Balisok & Associates, Inc., responded to the requests on December 27, 2023, but their response was incomplete and inadequate. The Plaintiff filed a motion to compel further responses, which was opposed by the Defendants. The court finds that the motion is timely and that the Defendants' responses were incomplete and inadequate. The court grants the motion and orders the Defendants to provide further responses to the requests for production of documents within 30 days of this order.
