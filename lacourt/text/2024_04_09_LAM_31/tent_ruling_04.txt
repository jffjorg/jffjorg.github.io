MOTION
FOR ORDER FOR APPRAISAL OF REAL PROPERTY



 
MOVING PARTY:               Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant
Cynthia Makin
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     Defendant/Cross-Complainant
George Cashman
 
 
I.          Background
 
This is a partition action concerning the real property
commonly known as 2 Crest Road East, Rolling Hills, County of Los Angeles,
California 90274 (the “Property”).  The
property is owned in equal parts by siblings Cynthia Makin (“Makin”) and George
Cashman (“Cashman”), as individuals and co-trustees of the GFC Administrative
Trust (the “Trust”).  
 
On December 29, 2022, Makin, in pro per, filed a Verified
Complaint for Partition in Kind of Real Property, against Cashman.  The Complaint seeks partition in kind of the
Property.
 
On April 28, 2023, Cashman filed a Verified Cross-Complaint,
seeking Partition by Sale of the Property, Declaratory Relief, and Accounting. 
 
            On March 7,
2024, Makin filed this Motion for Order for Appraisal of Real Property.  
 
            On March 18,
2024, Cashman filed an opposition.
 
            On April 2,
2024, Makin replied.
 
II.        Judicial
Notice
 
            Cashman requests judicial notice of four documents.  Because the court does not rely on the
documents to resolve this motion, the court declines to rule on Cashman’s
request.
 
III.       Discussion
& Legal Standard 
 
            Makin moves
the court for an order for appraisal of the Property.  She argues the court must order the appraisal
because Cashman’s demand for partition by sale triggers a mandated appraisal under
the Partition of Real Property Act (PRPA). 

 
            The PRPA is
codified at Code of Civil Procedure section 874.311, et seq.  Section 874.311 states, in part, “This
act applies to real property held in tenancy in common where there is no
agreement in a record binding all the cotenants which governs the partition of
the property.”  (Code Civ. Proc., §
874.311, subd. (b).)  “[The PRPA] act
applies to actions for partition of real property filed on or after January 1,
2023.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 874.311,
subd. (c).)  
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 874.317 further provides: “If
any cotenant requested partition by sale, the court shall, after the
determination of value under Section 874.316, send notice to the parties that
any cotenant except a cotenant that requested partition by sale may buy all the
interests of the cotenants that requested partition by sale.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 874.317, subd. (a).)
 
            Tenancy-in-common
            
“[The PRPA] applies to real property held in tenancy in
common where there is no agreement in a record binding all the cotenants which
governs the partition of the property.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 874.311, subd. (b).) 
Here, it is undisputed that the Property is held as tenants-in-common.[1]  Makin and Cashman each hold 3.5% interest in
the Property; the remaining 93% interest is held by the Trust.  (See Makin Decl., Exs. B, C, D.)  It is further undisputed that there is no
agreement which governs the partition of the Property. 
 
Application of the PRPA
 
“[The PRPA] act applies to actions for partition of real
property filed on or after January 1, 2023.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 874.311, subd. (c).) 

 
The parties disagree over whether the PRPA applies to this
action.  Makin argues the PRPA applies
because Cashman filed a Cross-Complaint demanding partition by sale on April
28, 2023.  
 
Cashman disagrees.  He
argues Makin cannot rely on the filing date of the Cross-Complaint because
under the doctrine of relation back, the date of Makin’s Complaint—December 29,
2022—controls.[2]  
 
Makin misconstrues the relation back doctrine.  “Under the relation-back doctrine, in
order to avoid the statute of limitations, the amended complaint must:
rest on the same general set of facts as the general complaint, refer to the
same accident and same injuries as the original complaint, and refer to the
same instrumentality as the original complaint.  [Citation.]”  (Scholes
v. Lambirth Trucking Co. (2017) 10 Cal.App.5th 590, 597-598, emphasis added.)  In other words, the relation back doctrine
functions to make timely a claim that would otherwise be untimely.  As Makin correctly points out a
cross-complaint is a separate action.  “A
cross-complaint is a separate pleading, based on an independent cause of
action.  It must be drawn with the same
completeness and sufficiency of allegations as the complaint on an independent
cause of action.”  (Wilson, McCall
& Daoro v. American Qualified Plans, Inc. (1999) 70 Cal.App.4th 1030,
1036.)  By filing a cross-complaint for
partition (by sale, no less), Cashman triggered the mandatory appraisal
provision under the PRPA. For this reason as well as those argued by Makin, the
PRPA applies and requires an appraisal. 
 
IV.       Conclusion
 
The motion is GRANTED.  If the parties cannot agree on the value of
the Property, or on an appraiser, the parties are each to submit a list of
three (3) disinterested real estate appraisers, with their respective resumes, who
are licensed in the State of California. 
The court will appoint an appraiser from the parties’ list.  The court sets a Status Conference re: Appraisal
under CCP Section 874.316 for May 3, 2024 at 9:00 AM.  
 
Moving party to give notice.
