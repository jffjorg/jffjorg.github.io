And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the motion for an order for appraisal of real property filed by Cynthia Makin. The case concerns the partition of a real property held in tenancy in common by Makin and George Cashman, who each hold 3.5% interest in the property. Cashman filed a cross-complaint for partition by sale, which triggers the mandatory appraisal provision under the Partition of Real Property Act (PRPA). The judge finds that the PRPA applies to the case and requires an appraisal of the property. The parties are required to submit a list of three disinterested real estate appraisers, and the court will appoint an appraiser from the list. The next court date is set for a status conference on May 3, 2024.
