```

And here is the English-text summary:

The Court's tentative ruling notes that the parties have stipulated to withdraw certain evidence, including the Hang Declaration, paragraph 13, lines 22-26. The Court also references previous cases, such as Reid v. Google, Inc. and Johnson v. United Cerebral Palsy/Spastic Children's Foundation, to establish the standard for avoiding summary judgment in discrimination cases. The Court notes that the Plaintiff, Ms. Maravilla, must produce substantial evidence to show that the Defendant's, ATE, stated nondiscriminatory reason for terminating her employment was untrue or pretextual, or that ATE acted with a discriminatory animus. The Court also references Ms. Hang's declaration, which states that ATE is a nationwide freight forwarder company with offices in the US and Asia. The Court's ruling suggests that the case will turn on whether Ms. Maravilla can produce sufficient evidence to support her claims of discrimination.
