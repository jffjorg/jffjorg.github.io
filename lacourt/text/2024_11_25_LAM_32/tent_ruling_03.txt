  order RE:
plaintiff vism studio’s demurrer to
  second amended cross-complaint (CRS# 7744)




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On September 5, 2023, Plaintiff and
Cross-Defendant VISM Studio filed this action against Defendants and
Cross-Complainants Woo-Jin Choi and Eunmi Song, alleging breach of contract. The
complaint alleges that Choi and Song breached their employment contracts by
abandoning their positions at VISM’s tattoo studio, causing lost profits.  
            Choi and Song have cross-complained
against VISM, with the operative Second Amended Cross-Complaint (SACC) filed on
June 5, 2024. The SACC asserts causes of action for (1) breach of the implied
covenant of good faith and fair dealing, (2) intentional misrepresentation, (3)
negligent misrepresentation, (4) unfair business practices, and (5) common
count – goods and services rendered. The SACC alleges that Choi and Song were
induced into working for VISM through false promises. VISM also allegedly required
Choi and Song to pay VISM’s staff for overtime and allegedly instructed Choi
and Song to stop working before May 15, 2023 to prevent them from receiving
certain commissions for the month of April 2023.
            On October 29, 2024, VISM filed the
instant demurrer to the SACC. Song and Choi filed their opposition on November
7, 2024. VISM filed its reply on November 12, 2024.  
LEGAL STANDARD
A demurrer for sufficiency tests whether
the complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) When
considering demurrers, courts read the allegations liberally and in
context. (Taylor v. City of Los
Angeles Dept. of Water and Power (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1228.)
In a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of the
pleading or by proper judicial notice. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.30, subd.
(a).) A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other
extrinsic matters. (SKF Farms v. Superior
Court (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 902, 905.) Therefore, it lies only where the
defects appear on the face of the pleading or are judicially noticed. (Ibid.) The only issue involved in a
demurrer hearing is whether the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with
extraneous matters, states a cause of action. (Hahn, supra, 147 Cal.App.4th at 747.)
MEET AND CONFER
Before filing a demurrer or a motion to
strike, the demurring or moving party is required to meet and confer with the
party who filed the pleading demurred to or the pleading that is subject to the
motion to strike for the purposes of determining whether an agreement can be
reached through a filing of an amended pleading that would resolve the
objections to be raised in the demurrer. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 430.41, 435.5.)
The Court notes that VISM has complied with the meet and confer requirement. (See
Satnick Decl.) 
DISCUSSION
            VISM demurs to the first, fourth,
and fifth causes of action. In response, Choi and Song concede the first and
fifth causes of action. Thus, the only issue is the fourth cause of action for
unfair business practices. 
            Business and Professions Code
section 17200 prohibits unlawful, unfair, or fraudulent business acts or
practices. Each of the three prongs is an independent basis for relief. (Smith
v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. (2001) 93 Cal.App.4th 700,
718.) Unlawful conduct is defined as any practice forbidden by law. (Farmers
Ins. Exchange v. Superior Court (1992) 2 Cal.4th 377, 383.) UCL actions
alleging unlawful conduct “borrow” from other statutes or common law causes of
action outside Section 17200. (Klein v. Chevron U.S.A., Inc. (2012)
202 Cal.App.4th 1342, 1383.)     A UCL
claim may be maintained “by a person who has suffered injury in fact and has
lost money or property as a result of the unfair competition.” (Bus. &
Prof. Code, § 17204.) 
VISM argues that because it was not
obligated to pay Choi and Song commission for April 2023, Choi and Song
suffered no injury in fact. However, the UCL claim incorporates all prior
allegations (SACC ¶ 52), and VISM does not challenge the fraud claims. The
conduct underlying the fraud claims sufficiently caused harm for standing under
the UCL. 
VISM argues that the fraud allegations are
insufficient because “fraud” under the UCL means conduct that is likely to
deceive the public. (See Committee on Children's Television v. General Foods
Corp. (1983) 35 Cal.3d 197, 211.) VISM argues that the fraud alleged here
only involves itself and Choi/Song. However, the alleged fraud may constitute
“unlawful” conduct. Common law torts may be considered unlawful under the UCL.
(Klein, supra, 202 Cal.App.4th at p. 1383.)    
Lastly, VISM argues that because the UCL
only permits equitable remedies, Choi and Song must allege the inadequacy of
legal remedies. The cited authority does not stand for this proposition. The
court in Bush v. California Conservation Corps (1982) 136 Cal.App.3d
194, 204 held that “[s]ince the administrative remedies were nonexistent and/or
constitutionally inadequate, there was no obligation on plaintiffs' part to
exhaust them prior to bringing the action.” This has nothing to do with legal
or equitable remedies, and the case does not mention the UCL at all. In
reality, the UCL expressly states that “the remedies or penalties provided by
this chapter are cumulative to each other and to the remedies or penalties
available under all other laws of this state.” (Bus. & Prof. Code, §
17205.) 
Thus, the SACC adequately alleges a UCL
claim. 
CONCLUSION
            VISM’s demurrer is SUSTAINED without
leave to amend as to the first and fifth causes of action and OVERRULED as to
the fourth cause of action.
