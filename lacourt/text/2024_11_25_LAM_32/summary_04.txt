And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by the defendants to the complaint. The complaint alleges that Sophia Patterson, the defendant, breached her contract with Bimbo LLC, the plaintiff, by secretly forming Gemini Management Inc. and using Bimbo LLC's trade secrets. The complaint also alleges that Patterson induced Bimbo LLC's clients and employees to breach their contracts with Bimbo LLC and join Gemini Management Inc. instead.

The judge overruled the demurrer as to the first and second causes of action, which alleges breach of contract and inducing breach of contract. The judge also overruled the demurrer as to the third and fourth causes of action, which alleges interference with contractual relations and inducing breach of contract.

The judge sustained the demurrer as to the seventh cause of action, which alleges unjust enrichment, finding that it is preempted by the California Uniform Trade Secrets Act (CUTSA).

The judge also found that the defendants' argument that Gemini Management Inc. cannot be liable as an alter ego of Sophia Patterson is without merit, and that Gemini Management Inc. is a valid defendant.

The judge granted leave to amend the demurrer as to the seventh cause of action.
