  Case No.:  19STCV08038
  Hearing Date:  November 25, 2024
 
     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
defendants’ motion to set aside default 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On March 8, 2019, Plaintiff Kap Soon
Moon filed this action against Defendants Sung Joo Na, Kyonga Nam, Jongju Na,
and Leading Town SDUS, Inc. 
            On November 26, 2019, default
judgment was granted for Plaintiff against Defendants. 
            On September 3, 2024, Defendants
Sung Joo Na, Kyonga Nam, and Jonju Na filed the instant motion to set aside the
default. Plaintiff filed his opposition on November 14, 2024. Defendants filed
their reply on November 18, 2024.
DISCUSSION
I.
Void Judgment
Lack of proper service renders the Court
without jurisdiction, and the judgment is void. (Renoir v. Redstar Corp.
(2004) 123 Cal.App.4th 1145, 1154.) A void judgment may be set aside at any
time. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473(d); Paterra v. Hansen (2021) 64
Cal.App.5th 507, 539.)
Defendants aver that they have never been
served with any document in the case, including the summons and complaint and that
they did not learn about the case until January 2022 or January 2024. (S. Na
Decl. ¶¶ 5-6; Nam Decl. ¶¶ 6-7; J. Na Decl. ¶¶ 5-6.) Defendants argue that “the
court file is completely devoid of any record that defendant was, in fact, ever
allegedly served with the Summons and Complaint.” (Mtn. 18:19-24.) However, the
proofs of service executed by a registered process server demonstrate service
on the Defendants.
In Renoir, the case cited by
Defendants, the judgment was “void on its face because the defect—the failure
to serve a summons—is ascertainable from the record.” (Renoir, supra,
123 Cal.App.4th at p. 1154.) Here, there is no defect on the face of the
record. Again, the proofs of service facially demonstrate proper personal
service on each defendant. Defendants have not presented evidence sufficiently
rebutting the presumption of valid service. (See Evid. Code, § 647.) Therefore,
the judgment is not void. 
II.
Equitable Relief
            “A final judgment may be set aside
by a court if it has been established that extrinsic factors have prevented one
party to the litigation from presenting his or her case.” (In re Marriage of
Park (1980) 27 Cal.3d 337, 342.) “When a default judgment has been
obtained, equitable relief may be given only in exceptional circumstances”
because “there is a strong public policy in favor of the finality of judgments.”
(Rappleyea v. Campbell (1994) 8 Cal.4th 975, 981.) “To set aside
a judgment based upon extrinsic mistake one must satisfy three
elements. First, the defaulted party must demonstrate that it has a
meritorious case. Second, the party seeking to set aside the default must
articulate a satisfactory excuse for not presenting a defense to the original
action. Last, the moving party must demonstrate diligence in seeking to set
aside the default once discovered.” (Id. at p. 982, internal citations
omitted.)   
            Defendants alternatively request
equitable relief. However, Defendants point to no facts which could be
considered extrinsic mistake or fraud justifying relief from the judgment.
Defendants merely reiterate their argument that “defendant was never properly
served, nor served at all.” (Mtn. 22:23-24.) As discussed above, the record
facially indicates proper service, and Defendants have not rebutted the
presumption of valid service. Defendants fail to provide evidence or to
elaborate on their claim of “fraud contain within Plaintiff’s declaration.”
(See Mtn. 22:26-23:1.) Defendants do not explain how Plaintiff’s unspecified
declaration deprived them of a proper hearing. 
            Furthermore, Defendants make no
attempt to satisfy the elements for equitable relief from a judgment. (See Rappleyea,
supra, 8 Cal.4th at p. 982.) Defendants only argue that they promptly moved
for relief upon discovering the default, but two of the defendants admit that
they discovered the case back in January 2022. (S. Na Decl. ¶¶ 5-6; Nam Decl.
¶¶ 6-7.) In any case, that only addresses one of the three elements. Thus, the
Court finds no basis for equitable relief.   

CONCLUSION
            The motion to set aside default
filed by Defendants Sung Joo Na, Kyonga Nam, and Jonju Na is DENIED.
