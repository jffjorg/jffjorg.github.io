  order RE:
defendant ramin aminian’s motion to
  enforce settlement




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On June 22, 2021, Hamid Hariri,
Nahid Hariri, and H and N Property Management, LLC (collectively “Plaintiffs”)
filed the operative Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”) against Cashbloom LLC and
others (collectively “Defendants”) alleging breach of promissory note and eight
other causes of action arising from loans Plaintiffs made to Cashbloom.  
            On July 16, 2024, Plaintiffs settled
with Defendant Ramin Aminian in the amount of $185,000. (Hamid Hariri Decl.,
Ex. 1.) The settlement agreement called for a cashier’s check made to H and N
Property Management, LLC. (Ibid.) However, Defendant’s former counsel
(Shahin Motallebi) claims that Plaintiffs’ counsel (Henry David) emailed him
alternate instructions to wire the funds to a bank. (Motallebi Decl. ¶ 5, Ex.
C.) Subsequently, Messrs. David, Aminian, and Motallebi purportedly exchanged
emails culminating in instructions to wire the money to Regions Bank. (Id.,
¶¶ 6-8, Ex. D.) Pursuant to these instructions, Defendant Aminian wired the
$185,000 to Regions Bank. (Id., ¶ 10.) 
            Mr. David denies sending any
instructions to wire the funds to Regions Bank and denies participating in the
purported email exchange. (David Decl. ¶¶ 35, 46-48.) Plaintiff contends that
Defendant Aminian and his counsel were “spoofed” and received emails from a
scammer posing as Mr. David. Plaintiff has not received any of the settlement
money. (Hamid Hariri Decl. ¶ 12.)
            The parties have filed three
separate motions centered on the question of whether Defendant Aminian has
satisfied the judgment through the $185,000 wire transfer to Regions Bank.
First, Defendant Aminian moves to enforce the settlement. Second, Defendant
Aminian moves to hold Mr. David in contempt for misrepresenting the amount owed
and the status of payment. Third, Plaintiff moves to compel production under a
subpoena on the grounds that Defendant Aminian has not satisfied the
judgment.      
            The Court addresses the first motion
herein. Defendant Aminian filed the motion to enforce settlement on October 31,
2024. Plaintiff filed its opposition on November 12, 2024. Defendant filed his
reply on November 18, 2024.   
LEGAL STANDARD
“If parties to
pending litigation stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties outside the
presence of the court or orally before the court, for settlement of the case,
or part thereof, the court, upon motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the
terms of the settlement. If requested by the parties, the court may retain
jurisdiction over the parties to enforce the settlement until performance in
full of the terms of the settlement.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6.) A settlement
agreement is a contract, and the legal principles which apply to contracts
generally apply to settlement contracts.¿(Weddington Productions, Inc. v.
Flick (1998) 60 Cal. App. 4th 793, 815.) 
When ruling on a
section 664.6 motion, the trial court acts as a trier of fact to determine
whether a settlement has occurred, which is also an implicit authorization for
the trial court to interpret the terms and conditions to settlement. (Skulnick
v. Roberts Express, Inc. (1992) 2 Cal. App. 4th 884, 889.) “Trial judges
may consider oral testimony or may determine the motion upon declarations
alone.” (Osumi v. Sutton (2007) 151 Cal.App.4th 1355, 1360.)
DISCUSSION
            The
terms of a settlement agreement may be modified by subsequent communications.
(See Charnay v. Cobert (2006) 145 Cal.App.4th 170, 186 [“parole evidence rule excludes only extrinsic evidence
of prior or contemporaneous oral agreements, not subsequent oral agreements”].) Here, Mr. Aminian
followed wiring instructions that he reasonably believed were from Mr. David
after the settlement agreement was executed. The emails originated from the
correct email address for Mr. David, occurred over a period of time, and were
consistent. (See Motallebi Decl., Ex. C-E.) Mr. David also confirms that emails
from his phone contain a notice at the end stating, “Sent via the Samsung
Galaxy S23+ 5G, an AT&T 5G smartphone.” (David Decl. ¶ 52.) Multiple emails
from “Henry David” in the email chain contain this footer, including the July
17, 2024 email that initiated the discussion on wiring the funds, and the July
24, 2024 email containing the wiring instructions. (Motallebi Decl., Ex. C-E.) 
            Mr.
David argues that he would not have directly communicated with a represented
litigant, and points out that the emails contain grammatical errors and
phrasing not normally used by him. Mr. David also contends that Messrs. Aminian
or Motallebi should have called him instead of relying solely on the emails.
However, Mr. David confirms that he has communicated directly with Mr. Aminian
before. (David Decl. ¶ 49, fn. 5.) Additionally, Mr. Motallebi was copied on
each of the subject emails. (Motallebi Decl., Ex. C-E.) Messrs. Aminian and
Motallebi had no reason to know what phrases Mr. David uses or does not use and
had no reason to assume fraud based on grammatical errors. The emails
originated from the correct email address for Mr. David, the same email that
Messrs. Aminian and Motallebi had communicated with before. Furthermore, Mr.
Aminian did call the correct phone number for Mr. David to discuss the wiring
instructions, and spoke with someone identifying himself as Mr. David. (Aminian
Supp. Decl. ¶ 7.) Within minutes of that call, “Henry David” sent an email referencing
the call. (Id., Ex. B.) Thus, Mr. Aminian reasonably relied on subsequent
communications as a modification of the payment terms.   
            Ultimately,
Mr. Aminian settled with Plaintiff for $185,000 and paid that amount according
to instructions originating from the email for Plaintiff’s counsel. Thus, Mr.
Aminian did as he was told and fulfilled his obligations under the settlement.   
CONCLUSION
            Defendant Ramin Aminian’s motion to
enforce settlement is GRANTED.

  order RE:
plaintiff’s motion to compel production 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On June 22, 2021, Hamid Hariri,
Nahid Hariri, and H and N Property Management, LLC (collectively “Plaintiffs”)
filed the operative Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”) against Cashbloom LLC and
others (collectively “Defendants”) alleging breach of promissory note and eight
other causes of action arising from loans Plaintiffs made to Cashbloom.  
            On July 16, 2024, Plaintiffs settled
with Defendant Ramin Aminian in the amount of $185,000. (Hamid Hariri Decl.,
Ex. 1.) The settlement agreement called for a cashier’s check made to H and N
Property Management, LLC. (Ibid.) However, Defendant’s former counsel
(Shahin Motallebi) claims that Plaintiffs’ counsel (Henry David) emailed him
alternate instructions to wire the funds to a bank. (Motallebi Decl. ¶ 5, Ex.
C.) Subsequently, Messrs. David, Aminian, and Motallebi purportedly exchanged
emails culminating in instructions to wire the money to Regions Bank. (Id.,
¶¶ 6-8, Ex. D.) Pursuant to these instructions, Defendant Aminian wired the
$185,000 to Regions Bank. (Id., ¶ 10.) 
            Mr. David denies sending any
instructions to wire the funds to Regions Bank and denies participating in the
purported email exchange. (David Decl. ¶¶ 35, 46-48.) Plaintiff contends that
Defendant Aminian and his counsel were “spoofed” and received emails from a
scammer posing as Mr. David. Plaintiff has not received any of the settlement
money. (Hamid Hariri Decl. ¶ 12.)
            The parties have filed three
separate motions centered on the question of whether Defendant Aminian has
satisfied the judgment through the $185,000 wire transfer to Regions Bank. First,
Defendant Aminian moves to enforce the settlement. Second, Defendant Aminian
moves to hold Mr. David in contempt for misrepresenting the amount owed and the
status of payment. Third, Plaintiff moves to compel production under a subpoena
on the grounds that Defendant Aminian has not satisfied the judgment.      
            The Court addresses the third motion
herein. Plaintiff H and N Property Management, LLC filed the motion to compel
production on October 28, 2024. Defendant Aminian filed his opposition on
November 12, 2024. Plaintiff filed its reply on November 18, 2024.   
LEGAL STANDARD
“If a subpoena requires the attendance of
a witness or the production of books, documents, electronically stored
information, or other things …, the court, upon motion reasonably made by [a
party] . . . may make an order quashing the subpoena entirely, modifying it, or
directing compliance with it upon those terms or conditions as the court shall
declare, including protective orders.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1987.1, subd. (a),
(b).)    
DISCUSSION
            On
September 16, 2024, Plaintiff issued a subpoena to Defendant Aminian for the
production of documents at his judgment debtor examination. (David Decl. ¶ 3,
Ex. 6.) Defendant objected to each request on the same grounds: that he has
already satisfied the judgment through his wiring of $185,000 to Regions Bank.  
            As
discussed in the Court’s concurrent ruling on Defendant’s motion to enforce
settlement, Defendant satisfied the terms of the settlement by paying $185,000
according to instructions originating from Mr. David’s email. The subpoena
seeks documents to be produced at Defendant’s judgment debtor examination to
aid in enforcement, but Defendant has already satisfied the judgment. Thus,
there is no basis to compel production. 
CONCLUSION
            Plaintiff H and N Property
Management, LLC’s motion to compel production is DENIED.

BACKGROUND
            On June 22, 2021, Hamid Hariri,
Nahid Hariri, and H and N Property Management, LLC (collectively “Plaintiffs”)
filed the operative Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”) against Cashbloom LLC and
others (collectively “Defendants”) alleging breach of promissory note and eight

            On July 16, 2024, Plaintiffs settled
with Defendant Ramin Aminian in the amount of $185,000. (Hamid Hariri Decl.,
Ex. 1.) The settlement agreement called for a cashier’s check made to H and N

emails culminating in instructions to wire the money to Regions Bank. (Id.,
¶¶ 6-8, Ex. D.) Pursuant to these instructions, Defendant Aminian wired the
$185,000 to Regions Bank. (Id., ¶ 10.) 
            Mr. David denies sending any
instructions to wire the funds to Regions Bank and denies participating in the
purported email exchange. (David Decl. ¶¶ 35, 46-48.) Plaintiff contends that
Defendant Aminian and his counsel were “spoofed” and received emails from a
scammer posing as Mr. David. Plaintiff has not received any of the settlement
money. (Hamid Hariri Decl. ¶ 12.)
            The parties have filed three

satisfied the judgment through the $185,000 wire transfer to Regions Bank. First,
Defendant Aminian moves to enforce the settlement. Second, Defendant Aminian
moves to hold Mr. David in contempt for misrepresenting the amount owed and the
status of payment. Third, Plaintiff moves to compel production under a subpoena
on the grounds that Defendant Aminian has not satisfied the judgment.      
            The Court addresses the second
motion herein. Defendant Aminian filed the motion for an order to show cause re
contempt on October 31, 2024. Plaintiff filed its opposition on November 12,
2024. Defendant filed his reply on November 18, 2024.  
LEGAL STANDARD
            “The
following acts or omissions in respect to a court of justice, or proceedings
therein, are contempts of the authority of the court: . . . (3) Misbehavior
in office, or other willful neglect or violation of duty by an attorney,
counsel, clerk, sheriff, coroner, or other person, appointed or elected to
perform a judicial or ministerial service . . . (4) Abuse of the process or
proceedings of the court, or falsely pretending to act under authority of an
order or process of the court . . . (5) Disobedience of any lawful judgment,
order, or process of the court . . . (9) Any other unlawful interference with
the process or proceedings of a court.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1209(a).) 
DISCUSSION
            Defendant
Aminian argues that Mr. David committed contempt of court by making false
representations in a September 11, 2024 declaration in support of a subpoena
for records. In that declaration, Mr. David averred that “Judgment
Debtor/Defendant Ramin Aminian owes Judgment Creditor H and N Property
Management, LLC of nearly $300,000, but has paid nothing towards that sum.” Defendant
argues that this is an intentional misrepresentation because Defendant
satisfied the judgment by wiring $185,000 to Regions Bank. 
            As
discussed in the Court’s concurrent ruling on Defendant’s motion to enforce
settlement, Defendant satisfied the terms of the settlement by paying $185,000
according to instructions originating from Mr. David’s email. However, there is
no indication that this issue arose from intentional deception by Plaintiff or Mr.
David.  
            The
charging documents and accompanying declarations do not demonstrate
contemptuous conduct by Mr. David. Plaintiff has consistently denied receipt of
the settlement funds. There is no evidence that Plaintiff actually received the
settlement payment. It is undisputed that the money was wired to Regions Bank,
and Defendant has no evidence that Plaintiff maintains an account at Regions
Bank or has access to the $185,000 that was wired there. The fact that the
subject emails were consistent and occurred over a period of time, and Mr.
David confirms receipt of some emails in the chain, is not evidence that Mr.
David fabricated the wiring emails or concocted a scheme to make Defendant pay
more than $185,000. 
Thus, the record
does not support the charge that Mr. David made a knowingly false declaration
by averring that Mr. Aminian has not paid the settlement. Without payment being
received by Plaintiff, Mr. David reasonably asserted that Defendant owed the full
judgment amount because he breached the settlement agreement. The Court entered
judgment against Defendant Aminian for $251,623.87, plus prejudgment interest.
Thus, the “nearly $300,000” claim is not intentionally false.  
            In
sum, the Court does not find sufficient cause for an OSC re contempt. 
CONCLUSION
            Defendant Ramin Aminian’s motion for
an order to show cause re contempt is DENIED.
