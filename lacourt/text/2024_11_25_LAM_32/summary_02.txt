Summary:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses three motions: Defendant Aminian's motion to enforce settlement, Plaintiff's motion to compel production, and Defendant Aminian's motion for an order to show cause re contempt. The court finds that Defendant Aminian satisfied the terms of the settlement by paying $185,000 according to instructions originating from Mr. David's email. The court denies Plaintiff's motion to compel production as there is no basis to compel production since the judgment has been satisfied. The court also denies Defendant Aminian's motion for an order to show cause re contempt as there is no evidence that Mr. David made a knowingly false declaration.
