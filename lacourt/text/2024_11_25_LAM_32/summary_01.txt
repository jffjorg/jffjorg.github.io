Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled on the defendants' motion to set aside the default judgment. The defendants argue that the default judgment is void because they were never served with the summons and complaint. However, the judge finds that the proofs of service demonstrate proper personal service on each defendant. The judge also finds that the defendants have not presented sufficient evidence to rebut the presumption of valid service.

The judge also considers the defendants' request for equitable relief, citing Rappleyea v. Campbell (1994) 8 Cal.4th 975 and In re Marriage of Park (1980) 27 Cal.3d 337. The defendants argue that they were deprived of a proper hearing due to the lack of service, but the judge finds that the record does not support this claim. The judge also finds that the defendants have not satisfied the elements for equitable relief, including demonstrating a meritorious case and articulating a satisfactory excuse for not presenting a defense to the original action.

As a result, the judge denies the motion to set aside the default judgment.
