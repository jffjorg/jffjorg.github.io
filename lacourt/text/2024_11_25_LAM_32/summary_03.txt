And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by VISM STUDIO to the Second Amended Cross-Complaint (SACC) filed by Woo-Jin Choi and Eunmi Song. The SACC alleges causes of action for breach of implied covenant, intentional misrepresentation, negligent misrepresentation, unfair business practices, and common count - goods and services rendered. The judge has sustained the demurrer as to the first and fifth causes of action, but overruled it as to the fourth cause of action for unfair business practices. The judge found that the SACC adequately alleges a claim under the Unfair Competition Law (UCL), and that VISM STUDIO's arguments that the fraud allegations are insufficient and that the UCL only permits equitable remedies are without merit.
