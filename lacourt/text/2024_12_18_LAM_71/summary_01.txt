And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Husam Asi vs. Hollywood Foreign Press Association. The Defendant, Hollywood Foreign Press Association, has moved to compel responses from the Plaintiff, Husam Asi, to its Request for Production (RFP) of documents, electronically stored information, and other things requested. The Judge has granted the motion, ordering the Plaintiff to provide verified responses and produce the requested documents within 20 days. The Judge has also ordered the Plaintiff to provide all communications with third-party individual David Quinto about the case, which the Plaintiff had previously withheld on the basis that Quinto is an attorney (although not the Plaintiff's attorney). The Judge has ruled that the Plaintiff's communications with Quinto are not privileged because there was no attorney-client relationship between the two individuals.
