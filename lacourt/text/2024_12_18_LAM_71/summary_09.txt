And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a request from Cathay Bank (the plaintiff) for a default judgment against Wholesale Parts Distributor LLC and Eun Sook Min (the defendants). The plaintiff filed a complaint against the defendants in March 2024, alleging breach of a written promissory note and business loan agreement, breach of a written guaranty, and other claims. The defendants were served and failed to respond, resulting in a default judgment being entered against them. The plaintiff is now seeking a judgment of $43,894.69, which includes damages, late charges, prejudgment interest, costs, and attorneys' fees. The judge has reviewed the evidence submitted by the plaintiff and has found sufficient evidence to justify the requested award. Therefore, the judge is granting the plaintiff's request and entering a judgment of $43,894.69 against the defendants.
