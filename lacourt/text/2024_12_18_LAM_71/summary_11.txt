And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion to compel responses from Kingsford Street Investors, LLC and Lysa Grigorian to their Request for Production of Documents (Set One). The defendants are ordered to provide verified responses and produce the requested documents, electronically stored information, and/or other things without objections within 20 days of this ruling.

The judge has also denied the request for monetary sanctions against the defendants, as the notice of motion does not comply with the requirements of California Code of Civil Procedure (C.C.P.) §2023.040. The notice of motion must identify every person, party, and attorney against whom the sanction is sought and specify the type of sanction sought.

The judge has ordered the moving parties to give notice of this ruling.
