And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by a Judge regarding a petition filed by Petitioners against Mt. SAC. The Judge has reviewed the evidence presented and is considering the arguments made by both parties. The Judge notes that Mt. SAC's final point of opposition claims that Petitioners failed to serve Mt. SAC with notice of the hearing, but the Proof of Service indicates that Mt. SAC was served on June 13, 2024.

The Judge also references several legal principles, including the modern trend in California law favoring granting relief and the need to examine denials of relief more rigorously than grants of relief. The Judge cites several cases, including Munoz, Tackett v. City of Huntington Beach, and Marriage of Khera & Sameer.

The Judge also notes that the rejection dates of the application are unclear and that Petitioners waited nearly 5 months to file their petition. The Judge has not made a final ruling on the petition and is awaiting further briefing from the parties.
