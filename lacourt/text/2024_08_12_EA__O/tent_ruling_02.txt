[1] In opposition, Mt. SAC’s final point as to why the petition
should be denied is that Petitioners purportedly failed to serve Mt. SAC or its
counsel with notice of the hearing. (Opp. p. 3:10-12.) The June 13, 2024 Proof
of Service indicates otherwise in that Mt. SAC was served with all pertinent
papers, including, ‘Notice of Hearing on Petition’, via substituted service on
6/13/24 at 10:09 AM by serving the administration specialist, Vivian Ruiz. 


[2] As the court in Munoz explained, “[t]he old
doctrine of strict and literal compliance, with its attendant harsh and unfair
results, has disappeared from California law…the modern trend of judicial
decisions favors granting relief.” (Ibid.) “Thus, a denial of such
relief by the trial court is examined more rigorously than where relief is
granted and any doubts which may exist should be resolved in favor the
application.” (Ibid.)
 


[3] The rejection dates are somewhat unclear. It is
unclear as to whether the application was denied on 12/15/23 (Petruzziello
Decl., Ex. 2 [rejection letters] p. 18 of 27 of PDF) or January 11, 2024.
(Petruzziello Decl., p. 13 of 27 of PDF.) 


[4] After counsel was retained, the attorneys learned that the
perpetrator, James Milliken (who held the same job as decedent), named Decedent
in a social media tirade about his time as an employee of MT. SAC and, among
other things, mentioning Decedent by name and stating that he had submitted a
human resources complaint to MT. SAC’s human resources which had been
“intentionally leaked.” (Petruzziello Decl., p. 3.) (Plaintiffs contacted
Richard Alpers of Alpers Law Group who then contacted Greenberg and Rub Injury
Attorneys, APC.) 
 


[5] In opposition, Mt. SAC argues that no specific reason is
given. (Opp. pp. 3, 9 citing Tackett v. City of Huntington Beach (1994)
22 Cal.App.4th 60, 66 [“It is impossible for a Court to characterize neglect as
excusable when the attorney has not described the neglect was.”].)
 


[6] Points raised for the first time in a reply brief ordinarily
will not be considered because such consideration would either deprive
respondent of an opportunity to counter the argument or require the effort and
delay of additional brief by permission. (See, e.g., Marriage of Khera
& Sameer (2012) 206 Cal.App.4th 1467, 1477 ["Obvious reasons
of fairness militate against consideration of an issue raised initially in the
reply brief[.]"].)


[7] Even with this petition, Petitioners waited nearly 5
months to file it.
