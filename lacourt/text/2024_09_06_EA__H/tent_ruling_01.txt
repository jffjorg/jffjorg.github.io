  Case Number:  23PSCV01127    Hearing Date:   September 6, 2024    Dept:  H Plaintiffs Ricky Trujillo and Gina
Trujillo’s Motion to Compel Attendance of Defendant General Motors, LLC’s
Person(s) Most Qualified and Custodian(s) of Records is CONTINUED to October
18, 2024 at 8:30 a.m. The Court orders the parties to engage in a good faith
meet and confer in the interim.
Background
Plaintiffs
Ricky Trujillo and Gina Trujillo (“Plaintiffs”) allege that in April
2022, they purchased a new 2022 Chevrolet Silverado that suffers from various
defects, which have not been repaired within a reasonable number of attempts.

On April 17, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a
complaint, asserting causes of action against General Motors, LLC (“GM”),
Martin Automotive, Inc. dba Chevrolet of Glendora (“Glendora Chevrolet”) and
Does 1-40 for (1) breach of express warranty, (2) breach of implied warranty,
(3) failure to repair, and (4) negligent repair.Pending
before the Court is Plaintiffs’ motion for an order (1) compelling GM to
produce a Person(s) Most Qualified and Custodian(s) of Record (“PMK”) and (2)
issuing sanctions against GM and/or its counsel of record in the amount of
$4,110.00. For the reasons stated herein, the Court concludes that the parties did
not engage in a meaningful meet-and-confer session prior to the filing of the
motion. Accordingly, the Court continues the hearing to October 18, 2024, at 8:30
a.m. so the parties can meet and confer as to the issues raised in Plaintiffs’
motion. The parties are ordered to file
a Joint Status Report, outlining the parties’ meet and confer efforts and identifying
what specific categories of requested testimony and document requests remain in
dispute by no later than October 7, 2024.
 
Discussion“If,
after service of a deposition notice, . . . a person designated by an
organization that is a party under Section 2025.230, without having served a
valid objection. . ., fails to appear for examination, or to proceed with it,
or to produce for inspection any document, electronically stored information,
or tangible thing described in the deposition notice, the party giving the
notice may move for an order compelling the deponent’s attendance and
testimony, and the production for inspection of any document, electronically
stored information, or tangible thing described in the deposition notice.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (a).)A
motion to compel a deponent’s attendance and testimony must be accompanied by a
meet and confer declaration. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (b).)Plaintiffs’
counsel Laura R. Schwartz (“Schwartz”) represents, and/or the accompanying
exhibits reflect, as follows:

On February 13, 2024, Plaintiffs
served GM with a “Notice of Deposition of General Motors, LLC’s Person(s) Most
Qualified and Custodian(s) of Record” (“Notice”), setting the deposition for
April 25, 2024; said Notice was comprised of 50 categories of matters for
examination and 46 document production requests. (Schwartz Decl., ¶ 3, Exh. 1.)
On April 19, 2024, GM served its “Objection to Plaintiffs’ Notice of Deposition
of the Person Most Qualified for General Motors, LLC and a Delaware Limited
Liability Company and Custodian(s) of Record” (“Objection”); this Objection stated
that no witness would be produced for examination categories nos. 2, 6, 9, 11,
12, 14-20, 23-26, 28-41, 43 and 45-50 and that no documents would be produced for
document requests nos. 2, 3, 5-10, 12, 15-20, 22, 23, 26-42 and 44-46. (Id.,
¶ 5, Exh. 3.)
Schwartz’s office thereafter emailed
GM’s counsel to obtain alternative deposition dates or alternatively
clarification on if GM would be producing a PMK at all (i.e., based on GM’s
statement in the Objection that it “may produce [its PMK] at a mutually
convenient time and place”), but did not receive a response. (Id., ¶¶
8-11, Exh. 4). On May 14, 2024, Schwartz filed a Request for an Informal
Discovery Conference (“IDC”), which the Court granted and scheduled for June 4,
2024. (Id., ¶¶ 12-13, Exhs. 5 and 6). GM’s counsel failed to appear at
the June 4, 2024 IDC; at that time, the Court granted Plaintiff permission to
file the present motion. (Id., ¶ 15, Exh. 8.) The motion was filed on
June 5, 2024.GM,
in opposition, asserts that Plaintiffs failed to properly meet and confer. The
Court agrees. The email string attached as Exhibit 4 to Schwartz’s declaration reflects that Schwartz’s office simply requested
alternative deposition dates or clarification as to whether GM planned to
produce a PMK at all. (Id., ¶¶ 9-11, Exh. 4.) Schwartz’s office made no
attempt to address the substance of any of GM’s objections made with respect to
specific categories of requested testimony and document requests in GM’s Objection,
as is now set forth in its 253-page separate statement. Although
Plaintiffs assert that they reached out to GM “multiple times, not only
requesting alternative dates that GM purportedly was agreeable to providing,
but also to schedule a telephonic meet and confer regarding the scope of the
deposition and the matters for examination that GM was objecting to” (Reply,
3:17-19), Schwartz’s declaration is devoid of any mention of efforts to contact
Plaintiffs’ counsel telephonically to discuss the substance of GM’s Objection.Accordingly, the Court will continue the hearing, to
October 18, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. to allow the parties to engage in a meaningful
meet-and-confer session. The meet-and-confer session should be conducted in
person or over the telephone.The parties are directed to file and serve by no
later than October 7, 2024, a Joint Status Report, outlining the parties’ meet-and-confer
efforts and identifying what specific categories of requested testimony and
document requests remain in dispute.
