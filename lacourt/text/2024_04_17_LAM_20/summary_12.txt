And here is the summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling is in response to a motion by Plaintiff Massamilano Valladares to strike the Answer of Defendants Black Executive Security Inc. and George Flaviu Pop. The judge rules that Black Executive Security Inc. cannot represent itself in court as it is an unrepresented corporation, and therefore strikes its Answer. The judge grants 30 days leave to amend for Black Executive Security Inc. to obtain counsel. On the other hand, George Flaviu Pop, a natural person, can proceed in propria persona and the judge denies the motion to strike his Answer. The judge encourages counsel to submit their responses remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
