```

And here is the English summary of the tentative ruling:

The Court has denied the defendants' motions for new trial or judgment notwithstanding the verdict. The defendants had argued that the May 8, 2023, judgment was not final, and therefore, the February 27, 2024, judgment triggered new rights. However, the Court has ruled that the motions are improper reconsiderations that fail to explain why the arguments could not have been raised earlier. The Court has also denied the defendants' request to quash the outstanding levies issued under the May 8, 2023, judgment.
