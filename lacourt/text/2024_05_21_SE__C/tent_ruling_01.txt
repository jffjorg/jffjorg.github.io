Tentative Ruling 
Defendants Affluent Staffing, LLC and Office
Chairs, Inc.’s Motion to Set Aside Default is GRANTED.  The Answer received on May 8, 2025 is deemed
filed as of today’s date.  
Defendants to give notice. 
 
Defendants Affluent Staffing, LLC and Office Chairs, Inc.
(“Defendants”) move to set aside default on the grounds of mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect under CCP § 473(b).  
Background 
This is a wrongful termination action filed by Plaintiff
Fredy Tobar (“Plaintiff”) against Defendants. 
The matter was set for trial on February 27, 2024, with a
Final Status Conference set for February 13, 2024.  At the FSC, the Court noted that “Substitution
of Attorney as to both defendants were filed on 02/09/24” and “The defendants
are corporate defendants and cannot be self-represented.” (See, 2/13/24 Minute
Order.) Neither Defendant appeared at the FSC. (Id.) Consequently, on
its own motion, the Court scheduled an OSC re striking of the answer filed by
both Defendants for failing to appear at the FSC. (Id.) The Order provided
that declarations for the OSC could be filed five days before the hearing. (Id.)
The OSC was scheduled for February 27, 2024, and the Court also made the
following order: “Counsel for plaintiff to give notice.” (Id.)
Neither Defendants nor their counsel appeared for the
scheduled OSC on February 27, 2024 and no declarations were filed. The Court
noted the nonappearance, struck the answers, entered defaults and scheduled a prove-up
hearing for March 20, 2024. (See, 2/27/24 Minute Order.)
The default prove up hearing was continued to May 21, 2024
to allow the instant motion to be heard. 
Legal Standard 
“The court may, upon any terms as may be just, relieve a
party or his or her legal representative from a judgment, dismissal, order, or
other proceeding taken against him or her through his or her mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. Application
for this relief shall be accompanied by a copy of the answer or other pleading
proposed to be filed therein, otherwise the application shall not be granted,
and shall be made within a reasonable time, in no case exceeding six months,
after the judgment, dismissal, order, or proceeding was taken.” (CCP § 473(b).)

Discussion 
As a preliminary matter, the Court notes that three
separate motions to set aside default were scheduled for this date. However,
the pleadings appear to have been filed jointly. The Court also finds the
motion is timely because default was entered on February 27, 2024 and
Defendants filed their motion on March 7, 2024, within the statutory
period.  
Affluent and OCI contend they were not given notice of the February
13, 2024 ruling. The declarations of Kevin Charco (on behalf of Affluent) and
Joseph Klapper (on behalf of OCI) both attest that neither they, nor anyone in
their office, were advised either orally or in writing by either their former
attorney (Mr. Sands), or by plaintiff’s counsel of the scheduled OSC hearing on
February 27, 2024, or of the possibility of filing a declaration. (Charco Decl.
¶¶ 2 and 3, Klapper Decl. ¶¶ 2 and 3.) The Court, in reviewing the case file,
notes that notice of the February 13, 2024 Minute Order by Plaintiff was not
filed. Therefore, the Court is inclined to find that default was entered as a surprise
to Defendants based upon lack of notice of the OSC ruling.  
On May 7, 2024, this Court continued the hearing to this
date finding that relief could not be granted at that time because Defendants
had not attached a proposed answer or other responsive pleading to their
motion. (See 5-7-24 Minute Order.) “Application for this relief shall be
accompanied by a copy of the answer or other pleading proposed to be filed
therein, otherwise the application shall not be granted …” (CCP § 473(b),
italics added.)
On May 8, 2024, the Court received Defendants Affluent and
OCI’s Answer.  
Accordingly, the Motion to Set Aside is Default is GRANTED.
