And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants summary adjudication in favor of the plaintiff on the first, fourth, fifth, and sixth causes of action, which relate to the plaintiff's claims for unpaid wages, inaccurate wage statements, unpaid overtime wages, and unfair business practices. The judge denies the defendant's motion for summary judgment on these causes of action. The judge also denies the plaintiff's motion for summary adjudication on the second and third causes of action, which relate to the plaintiff's claims for unpaid meal periods and rest breaks. The judge finds that the plaintiff has made a prima facie showing that the defendants failed to pay all wages, issue accurate wage statements, and pay overtime wages. The judge also finds that the defendants failed to produce reliable evidence of the precise amount of work performed or reliable evidence negating the reasonableness of the inference to be drawn from the employee's evidence.
