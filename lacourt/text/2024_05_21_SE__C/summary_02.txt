And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to compel further response to requests for production of documents, set two. The defendant had argued that the plaintiff's response was insufficient and late, and that the plaintiff had waived its objections. However, the judge has granted the plaintiff's request for relief from waiver, finding that the plaintiff's late response was the result of a mistake and that the plaintiff's further and amended responses were sufficient. The judge has also reviewed the plaintiff's responses to specific requests for production and has found that they comply with the minimum requirements. Therefore, the defendant's motion is denied.
