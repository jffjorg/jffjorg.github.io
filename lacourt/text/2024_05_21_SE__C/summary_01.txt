```

And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The court grants the motion to set aside the default judgment. The defendants, Affluent Staffing, LLC and Office Chairs, Inc., contend that they were not given notice of the February 13, 2024 ruling, which led to the default judgment. The court finds that the default was entered as a surprise to the defendants based on lack of notice of the OSC ruling. The court also notes that the defendants filed their answer on May 8, 2024, which is deemed filed as of today's date.
