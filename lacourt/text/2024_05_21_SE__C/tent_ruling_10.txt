Diaz vs Samjai Gip, et al., Case No. 24NWCV00327
This is a
personal injury action. Defendant Tina Ngol Nguyen seeks an order to set aside
default on the grounds that the default was entered through inadvertence
mistake or surprise, or excusable neglect pursuant to CCP § 473. 
A party may
seek ex parte relief upon an affirmative factual showing "irreparable
harm, immediate danger, or any other statutory basis for granting relief ex
parte." (Cal. R. Ct. 3.1202(c).)  Here, Defendant does not
demonstrate entitlement to relief on an ex parte basis.  
Plaintiff is also advised that the Court typically requires
litigants to file noticed motions after first making a reservation on the
Court’s reservation system.  A party may then seek ex parte relief if
necessary. 
Accordingly,
the ex parte application is DENIED.
