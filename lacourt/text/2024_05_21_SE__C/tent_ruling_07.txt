Background 
Plaintiff Tawana Jean Cooper (“Plaintiff”) sues for
employment discrimination, among other causes of action, related to her job as
a part-time medical screener for Defendant Octapharma Plasma, Inc. (“Defendant
OPI”). Plaintiff also sues Defendant Caitlin Ryan, individually, alleging that
Defendant Ryan willfully breached an oral contract under California Civil Code
§ 1622.   
The operative First Amended Complaint (“FAC") was
filed on July 3, 2023. On August 30, 2023, Plaintiff served her Request for
Production of Documents (Set One) and Requests for Admissions (Set One) on
Defendant Ryan. Defendant Ryan served responses on October 2, 2023. In this
motion to compel, Plaintiff argues the responses were unverified and,
therefore, untimely. 
Request for
Production of Documents
Legal Standard 
A party may make a demand for
production of documents and propound interrogatories without leave of court at
any time 10 days after the service of the summons on, or appearance by, the
party to whom the demand is directed, whichever occurs first. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2031.020, subd. (b); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.020, subd. (b).) The demand for
production of documents is not limited by number, but the request must comply
with the formatting requirements in Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.030. 
The
party whom the request is propounded upon is required to respond within 30 days
after service of a demand, but the parties are allowed to informally agree to
an extension and confirm any such agreement in writing. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.060, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.060, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.070, subd. (a) – (b); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.070, subd. (a) – (b).)
If a
party fails to timely respond to a request for production or interrogatories,
the party to whom the request is directed waives any right to exercise the
option to produce writings under Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.230, and waives any
objection, including one based on privilege or on the protection for work
product. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290,
subd. (a).)

Discussion 
In her motion, Plaintiff argues that there are several
inadequacies in the responses to the request for production namely: (1) that
the responses are unverified due to the oath requirement only being on a
verification page. 
Plaintiff argues that CCP § 2031.250(a) should be
interpreted to mean that if the oath is on the verification page, and not on
the response itself, the response should be deemed unverified. However, the
Code’s oath requirement is typically satisfied by a signature on the
verification page. The Code only requires responding party to “sign the
response under oath.” (Code Civ. Proc., §2031.250, subd. (a).) In practice, the
responding party may sign a verification form attached or inserted at the end
of the answers stating that that the party: “certify and declare under penalty
of perjury under the laws of the State of California that the foregoing answers
are true and correct.” (See CCP § 2015.5.) (Wiel & Brown, Cal. Practice
Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter Group 2020) ¶ 8:1103; see also
Cal. Judges Benchbook: Civil Proceedings – Discovery (CJER Sept. 2022)
Inspection Demands, § 19.15.)
Here, the verification form is signed by Defendant Caitlin
Ryan. (Horner Decl., ¶ 4, Ex. B.) The Court finds the response is verified.
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Response to
Request for Production of Documents is DENIED.
 
Motion to Deem
Answers Admitted 
Legal
Standard 
Where there has been no timely response to requests for admissions,
a “requesting party may move for an order that the genuineness of any documents
and the truth of any matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted, as
well as for a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with section
2023.010).”  The court “shall” grant the
motion to deem requests for admission admitted “unless it finds that the party
to whom the requests for admission have been directed has served, before the
hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests for admission that
is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280(c).)
Discussion 

Plaintiff relies on the same arguments made above as to why
the discovery motion should be granted. 
Here, it is clear the verification form is signed by Defendant
Caitlin Ryan. (Cooper Decl., Ex. D.) The Court finds the response is verified.
Sanctions
Legal
Standard
The
party who propounded the discovery request may bring a motion to compel and the
court shall impose a monetary sanction against any party, person, or attorney
who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to a demand
for production of documents or interrogatories, unless the court finds that the
one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.300, subd. (c); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (c).)

Plaintiff’s request for Sanctions
Plaintiff requests sanctions in the amount of $10,000.00 in
connection with the cost of filing this motion and willful misuse of discovery.
The motion is denied and therefore the sanctions are moot. 
However, the Court also notes that a party litigating in
propria person “may not be awarded monetary discovery sanctions based on
compensation for time and effort expended as a result of a misuse of the
discovery process.” (Argaman v. Ratan (1999) 73 Cal.App.4th 1173,
1180-1181.)
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s request for sanctions is DENIED.
Defendant’s Request for Sanctions
The Court may impose a monetary sanction against any party
who unsuccessfully makes such a motion to compel without substantial
justification. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.320, subd. (b).) The sanctions are
authorized to “pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred
by anyone as a result of that conduct.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd.
(a).)
Defendant requests sanctions against Plaintiff in the
amount of $5000.00 per motion to compensate Defendant for reasonable attorney’s
fees in opposing the motion.  That amount
is excessive.  Presently, the Court
determines it is in the interest of justice to address Plaintiff’s serial
motions to compel by adjusting its calendar, not by imposing monetary
sanctions.  
Accordingly, Defendant’s request for sanctions is
DENIED.
