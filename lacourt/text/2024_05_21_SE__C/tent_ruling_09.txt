suit against Defendant Rabi Jamil Mouton (“Defendant”) for (1) Declaratory
Relief; (2) Breach of Contract; and (3) Partnership Dissolution. 
Plaintiff moves
ex parte for an order advancing the hearing on Plaintiff’s Demurrer to the
Cross-Complaint, currently scheduled for Tuesday, September 24, 2024, and
Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Defendant Rabi Jamil Mouton’s Deposition,
currently scheduled for Thursday, February 13, 2025.  
A party may
seek ex parte relief upon an affirmative factual showing "irreparable
harm, immediate danger, or any other statutory basis for granting relief ex
parte." (Cal. R. Ct. 3.1202(c).)

demurrer is ADVANCED from September 24, 2024 to today’s date and CONTINUED to
