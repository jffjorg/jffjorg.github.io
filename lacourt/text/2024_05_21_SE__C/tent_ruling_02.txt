Tentative Ruling 
Defendant College Hospital, Inc.’s Motion to
Compel Further Response to Request for Production of Documents (Set Two) is
DENIED. 
Plaintiff to give notice. 
 
Defendant moves to compel further response to request for
production of documents (set two) on the grounds that the response was insufficient
and Plaintiff has waived objections. 
Background
On March 7, 2023, Plaintiff Jane Doe (“Plaintiff”) filed
her Second Amended Complaint against Defendant College Hospital, Inc.
(“Defendant”) alleging causes of action for: 1) Dependent Adult Abuse &
Neglect; 2. Professional Negligence; 3. Unfair Business Practices; 4.
Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress; and 5. Breach of Fiduciary Duty.  
On November 29, 2023, Defendant propounded Request for
Production of Documents, Set Two, on Plaintiff. On December 27, 2023, Defendant
granted Plaintiff an extension to respond to January 11, 2024. 
On January 17, 2024, Plaintiff served a response which
included objections, which Defendant asserts have been waived. 
On February 29, 2024, Defendant filed the instant motion to
compel further response on the grounds that Plaintiff’s January 17, 2024 response
was insufficient and Plaintiff has not provided full and complete discovery
responses as requested. 
On May 7, 2024, Plaintiff served further and amended
responses to Defendant’s discovery request. (Musante Decl. ¶ 5, Ex. C.) 
Meet and Confer Requirement 
A motion¿to compel further responses to requests for
production “shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration.”¿ (Code Civ.
Proc. § 2031.310(b)(2).)¿ The declaration must state facts showing a reasonable
and good faith attempt at an informal resolution of each issue presented in the
motion.¿ (Code Civ. Proc. § 2016.040.)¿  
The Court finds that parties have met the meet and confer
requirement. 
Separate Statement 
A motion to compel further response requires a separate
statement.  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1345(a).) Defendant properly filed separate statements.
Legal Standard 
A party may make a demand to propound interrogatories
without leave of court at any time 10 days after the service of the summons on,
or appearance by, the party to whom the demand is directed, whichever occurs
first. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.020, subd. (b).) 
The party whom the request is propounded upon is required
to respond within 30 days after service of a demand, but the parties are
allowed to informally agree to an extension and confirm any such agreement in
writing. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.060, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.060,
subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.070, subd. (a) - (b); Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.070, subd. (a) - (b).) 
If a party fails to timely respond to interrogatories, the
party to whom the request is directed waives any right to exercise the option
to produce writings under Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.230, and waives any
objection, including one based on privilege or on the protection for work
product. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a);
Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).) 

On receipt of a response to a demand for inspection,
copying, testing, or sampling, the demanding party may move for an order
compelling further response to the demand if the demanding party deems that any
of the following apply:
(1) A statement of
compliance with the demand is incomplete.
(2) A representation of
inability to comply is inadequate, incomplete, or evasive.
(3) An objection in the
response is without merit or too general.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (a).)
Discussion 
In its moving papers, Defendant contends that Plaintiff’s
January 17, 2024 response was past the deadline and therefore objections must
be waived. Defendant also argues that the response was insufficient and to date
Plaintiff has not provided full and complete discovery responses as requested. 
Plaintiff, in opposition, contends that Defendant’s
position is extreme and unfair because Plaintiff’s January 17, 2024 response
was served only six days after the agreed-upon deadline. (Mot. at 4.)  Plaintiff seeks waiver from objections under
CCP § 2031.300.  “The court, on motion,
may relieve that party from this waiver on its determination that both of the
following conditions are satisfied:
(1) The party has
subsequently served a response that is in substantial compliance with Sections 2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230, 2031.240, and 2031.280.
(2) The party’s failure to
serve a timely response was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable
neglect.”
(CCP § 2031.300, subd. (a).)
Plaintiff makes no attempt to explain why she served an untimely
response.  However, in the interests of
judicial efficiency, and because the response was only six days late and
amended responses have been served, the Court grants Plaintiff’s request for
relief from waiver.  
Request for Production Nos. 56, 72, 74, 75, 77,
and 79
Defendant contends that Plaintiff’s response to Request for Production Nos. 56, 72, 74, 75, 77, and 79
are insufficient because a statement of inability to comply must (1) state that
a diligent search and reasonable inquiry has been made and (2) indicate whether
the particular item or category has never existed, has been destroyed, has been
lost, misplaced, or stolen, or has never been, or is no longer, in the
possession, custody, or control of the responding party. 
As to these requests, the Court has reviewed Plaintiff’s
Further and Amended Responses and determines that they comply with the minimum
requirements. Thus, there is nothing for this Court to compel as to Request for
Production Nos. 56, 72, 74, 75, 77, and 79.
Request for Production Nos. 76, 78, and 85-90
As to Request for Production Nos.
76, 78, and 85-90, the Court finds that Plaintiff has complied. For
example, in response to Request for Production No. 76, Plaintiff replies, “Plaintiff
incorporates by reference the General Objections and Objections to Definitions
as though fully set forth herein. Without waiving, and subject to the foregoing
general objections, Plaintiff will produce all documents responsive to this
Request that are in her possession, custody, or control, and to which no
objection is made.” (Separate Statement, Response to Request for Production No.
76.) Plaintiff has made a legally adequate statement
of compliance and an objection to the particular
demand.¿ (See Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.210,
subd. (a).)
 
Accordingly, Defendant’s Motion
to Compel Further Response to Request for Production of Documents (Set Two) is
DENIED. 
 
Finally, no sanctions are
imposed because none have been requested.
