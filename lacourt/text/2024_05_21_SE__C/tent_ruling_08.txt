Tentative Ruling 
Plaintiff J.V.C. Truck Lines, Inc.’s Motion to
Compel Request for Production of Documents (Set One) and Request for Special
Interrogatories (Set Two) are MOOT.  Sanctions
are imposed upon Defendant and Counsel, jointly and severally, in the
reasonable sum of $1,170.00, payable within 60 days.  
Moving party to give notice.
 
Background 
This is a breach of contract action which alleges that Plaintiff
J.V.C. Truck Lines, Inc. (“Plaintiff”) delivered goods for Defendant E.
Mishan & Sons., Inc. (“Defendant”) in exchange for payment from May 4, 2020
to May 31, 2022.  The Complaint alleges
that Defendant failed to pay amounts associated with the delivery of goods for
a total of $1,122,378.88. 
On October 18, 2023, Plaintiff served Request for
Production of Documents and Things, Set One, on Defendant. On December 15,
2023, Plaintiff served Special Interrogatories, Set Two, on Defendant. No
responses were received as of the filing of the motion.
Legal Standard 
A party may make a demand for production of documents and
propound interrogatories without leave of court at any time 10 days after the
service of the summons on, or appearance by, the party to whom the demand is
directed, whichever occurs first. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.020, subd. (b); Code
Civ. Proc., § 2030.020, subd. (b).) The demand for production of documents is
not limited by number, but the request must comply with the formatting
requirements in Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.030. 
The party whom the request is propounded upon is required
to respond within 30 days after service of a demand, but the parties are
allowed to informally agree to an extension and confirm any such agreement in
writing. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.060, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.060,
subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.070, subd. (a) – (b); Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.070, subd. (a) – (b).)
If a party fails to timely respond to a request for
production or interrogatories, the party to whom the request is directed waives
any right to exercise the option to produce writings under Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.230, and waives any objection, including one based on privilege or on the
protection for work product. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a); Code Civ.
Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).)
Discussion 
On October 18, 2023, Plaintiff served Request for
Production of Documents and Things, Set One, and Special Interrogatories, Set
One, on Defendant.   
On December 15, 2023, Plaintiff served Special
Interrogatories, Set Two, on Defendant. The documents requested include
documents that support the “Customer Chargebacks” identified in the Bill of
Particulars and how the calculations set forth in the Bill of Particulars were
determined. 
Written responses to the Request for Production were due on
or before November 21, 2023. (See C.C.P. § 1010.6(a)(2)(B).) Written responses
to the Special Interrogatories were due on or before January 18, 2024. (See
C.C.P. § 1010.6(a)(2)(B).) Plaintiff asserts that no written responses have
been served by opposing counsel. 
In opposition, Defendant contends that on April 17, 2024, it
provided complete verified responses, without objection, to Plaintiff’s second
set of special interrogatories and first set of request for production of
documents. Defendant argues that the motion is now moot. 
The Court notes the responses were provided April 17, 2023,
one-half year after the Request for Production was propounded and four months
after the Special Interrogatories were propounded. In reply, Plaintiff does not
contest that discovery was provided. Accordingly, the Court finds the motions
are MOOT. 
Sanctions
The party who propounded the discovery request may bring a
motion to compel and the court shall impose a monetary sanction against any
party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to
compel a response to a demand for production of documents or interrogatories,
unless the court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (c); Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2030.290, subd. (c).)
Plaintiff requests sanctions in the combined amount of
$11,740.00.  That amount is
excessive.  Given the simplicity of the
motions and their overlapping content, sanctions are imposed upon Defendant and
Counsel, jointly and severally, in the reasonable sum of $1,170.00, payable
within 60 days.
