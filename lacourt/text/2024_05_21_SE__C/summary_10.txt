And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

"This is a personal injury action, and Defendant Tina Ngol Nguyen seeks to set aside the default on the grounds that the default was entered through inadvertence, mistake, or surprise, or excusable neglect. However, Defendant does not demonstrate entitlement to relief on an ex parte basis. The Court typically requires litigants to file noticed motions after making a reservation on the Court's reservation system. As a result, the ex parte application is denied."
