And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling granted the plaintiff's motion to compel the defendant's responses to form interrogatories. The plaintiff served the interrogatories on November 30, 2023, and the responses were due on January 4, 2024, but none were served. The plaintiff filed the motion to compel on April 18, 2024, and no opposition was filed. The court found that the defendant's failure to respond to the interrogatories was a misuse of the discovery process, and granted the plaintiff's request for sanctions in the amount of $810.00. The court ordered the defendant to serve responses to the interrogatories within 20 days and to pay the sanctions to the plaintiff's counsel within 20 days.
