SUMMARY OF ACTION 
Plaintiff Chinyere Valerie Ibe (Plaintiff) filed her
First Amended Complaint (FAC), in pro per, on March 25, 2024. Plaintiff’s
complaint alleges seven causes of action for (1) Breach of the Duty of Good
Faith and Fair Dealing; (2) Bad Faith Denial of Insurance Claim; (3) Breach of
the Contractual Duty to Pay a Covered Insurance Claim; (4) Intentional
Misrepresentation; (5) Violations of Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code §§ 17200, et. seq.; (6)
Unjust Enrichment; and (7) Defamation.
 
The First through Third Causes of Action are only against
Defendant Bamboo Insurance Services, Inc. The Fourth through Seventh Causes of
Action are against all Defendants. Defendant 818 Restoration and Construction,
LLC (818 Restoration) is the demurring Defendant in this instance. 818
Restoration demurs to the Fourth through Seventh Causes of Action.
 
Plaintiff’s FAC alleges that the water heater in the
garage of her home burst. This caused the garage to flood, damaging the drywall
and items that were stored in the garage. Plaintiff’s FAC alleges that on Marh
24, 2023, Defendant Bamboo Insurance sent out a leak detector from 818
Restoration to take pictures of the damaged drywall in the garage. (FAC, ¶ 21.) She also alleges that
water was still trickling out of the water heater when the leak detector from
818 Restoration came out. (FAC, ¶ 25.) She also alleges that 818 Restoration
was working with Bamboo to create a story that Plaintiff falsely reported that
the water heater flooded the garage. (FAC, ¶ 34.) Plaintiff also alleges that
Bamboo, using its contractors, including 818 Restoration, found ways to deny
her claim. (FAC, ¶ 61.) The last allegations in Plaintiff’s FAC related to 818
Restoration is that it made one or more defamatory statements about Plaintiff to
a person other than Plaintiff. (FAC, ¶¶ 100, 103.) There are no other specific
allegations related to 818 Restoration.
 
818
Restoration filed its demurrer on May 28, 2024. Plaintiff filed an opposition
on June 26, 2024, with proof of service by mail. On July 1, 2024, 818
Restoration filed a notice of non-opposition to its demurrer, as it apparently
had no knowledge of the opposition that was filed by Plaintiff with the Court
and had not yet received the opposition in the mail. 
 
Plaintiff’s
opposition only argues that she was not validly served with the demurrer
because she had not consented to service of the demurrer via email, which is how
she claimed she received the demurrer. However, the proof of service filed with
Defendant’s demurrer indicates that Plaintiff was served via U.S. Mail, so it
is unknown why she did not receive the demurrer in the mail. Plaintiff also
argues that Defendant did not meet and confer, but Defendant’s demurrer
indicates that it attempted to meet and confer with Plaintiff, but Plaintiff did
not respond to attempts to meet and confer with her. Plaintiff’s opposition
contains no arguments regarding the merits of the demurrer and motion to
strike.
 
The
Court will address the merits of the demurrer and the motion to strike.
 
ANALYSIS
A demurrer is an objection to a pleading, the grounds for
which are apparent from either the face of the complaint or a matter of which
the court may take judicial notice. (CCP § 430.30(a); see also Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311,
318.) The purpose of a demurrer is to challenge the sufficiency of a pleading
“by raising questions of law.” (Postley
v. Harvey (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 280, 286.) “In the construction of a
pleading, for the purpose of determining its effect, its allegations must be
liberally construed, with a view to substantial justice between the parties.” (CCP
§ 452.) The court “ ‘ “treat[s] the demurrer as admitting all material facts
properly pleaded, but not contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law…”
’ ” (Berkley v. Dowds (2007) 152
Cal.App.4th 518, 525.) In applying these standards, the court liberally
construes the complaint to determine whether a cause of action has been stated.
(Picton v. Anderson Union High School
Dist. (1996) 50 Cal.App.4th 726, 733.)
 
            Fourth
Cause of Action for Intentional Misrepresentation
Defendant 818 Restoration demurs to Plaintiff’s cause of
action for intentional misrepresentation on the basis that it fails to plead
any specific allegations against 818 Restoration.
 
“The elements of intentional misrepresentation are (1) a
misrepresentation, (2) knowledge of falsity, (3) intent to induce reliance, (4)
actual and justifiable reliance, and (5) resulting damage.” (Aton Center,
Inc. v. United Healthcare Ins. Co. (2023) 93 Cal.App.5th 1214, 1245.)
Notably, “in California, fraud must be pled specifically; general and
conclusory allegations do not suffice.” (Lazar v. Superior Court (1996)
12 Cal.4th 631, 645.) “This particularity requirement necessitates pleading
facts which show how, when, where, to whom, and by what means the
representations were tendered.” (Id.)
 
There are no specific allegations against 818 Restoration
under this cause of action. Instead, Plaintiff just alleges that “Defendants”
made misrepresentations regarding what would be covered by Plaintiff’s
insurance policy. (FAC, ¶ 78.) 818 Restoration was not Plaintiff’s insurance
provider. It was simply an inspector hired by Plaintiff’s provider, Bamboo
Insurance. There are no allegations under this cause of action for any
misrepresentations made specifically by 818 Restoration.
 
Defendant’s demurrer to Plaintiff’s Fourth Cause of Action
is sustained with leave to amend.
 
            Fifth
Cause of Action for Violation of Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code §§ 17200 et. seq.
818 Restoration demurs to this cause of action on the basis
that there are insufficient facts against 818 Restoration to support this cause
of action.
 
Cal. Business & Professions Code § 17200 et seq. includes
the California Unfair Competition Law and provides consumers with remedies when
businesses engage in unfair or fraudulent practices.
 
Plaintiff’s FAC does not contain any allegations indicating
that 818 Restoration violated the Business and Professions Code. The only
specific allegation against 818 Restoration under this cause of action is that
Bamboo used it to find ways to deny Plaintiff’s claims. This is not sufficient
to indicate that 818 Restoration itself engaged any acts that would constitute
a violation of the Business and Professions Code.
 
Defendant’s demurrer to Plaintiff’s Fifth Cause of Action is
sustained with leave to amend.
 
            Sixth
Cause of Action for Unjust Enrichment
818 Restoration demurs to this cause of action on the basis
that it does not allege sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action
against 818 Restoration.
 
The theory of unjust enrichment requires one who acquires a
benefit at the expense of another to either return the thing or its equivalent
to the aggrieved party so as not to be unjustly enriched. (Lyles v.
Sangadeo-Patel (2014) 255 Cal.App. 4th 759.)
 
Though Defendant does not raise this argument, the Court
will note that there is no cause of action for unjust enrichment in California.
(Melchior v. New Line Productions, Inc. (2003) 106 Cal.App.4th 779, 785,
793 (“unjust enrichment is not a valid cause of action under California law”).)
 
Unjust enrichment is not a valid cause of action.
Furthermore, Plaintiff’s FAC contains no allegations indicating how 818
Restoration was unjustly enriched.
 
Because unjust enrichment is not a valid cause of action,
Defendant’s demurrer to Plaintiff’s Sixth Cause of Action is sustained without
leave to amend.
 
            Seventh
Cause of Action for Defamation
818 Restoration demurs to this cause of action on the basis
that it does not allege facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action for
defamation.
 
Defamation is an intentional tort that requires proof that
the defendant intended to publish the defamatory statement. (Stellar v.
State Farm General Ins. Co. (2007) 157 Cal.App 4th 1498.) California law
requires that any words constituting an alleged defamation must be specifically
identified, if not pleaded verbatim, in the complaint. (ZL Technologies,
Inc. v Does 1 – 17 (2017) 13 Cal.App. 5th 603.)
 
The only allegations that Plaintiff has against 818
Restoration under this cause of action is that it “noted that a potential slab
leak had occurred in the garage as the water did not reflect a failed water
heater” in the April 14, 2023, denial of benefits letter to Plaintiff, and that
“818 Restoration made one or more of the states to a person other than Ms.
Ibe.” (FAC, ¶¶ 100, 103.) There is nothing in Plaintiff’s FAC to indicate how 818
Restoration defamed Plaintiff, as the letter would have been issued by
Plaintiff’s insurance provider, nor does Plaintiff specifically identify the
alleged defamation.
 
Defendant’s demurrer to Plaintiff’s Seventh Cause of Action
is sustained with leave to amend.
 
Motion to Strike
Defendant had moved to strike Plaintiff’s request for
punitive damages.
 
This Court may strike from the complaint any irrelevant,
false, or improper matter. Under CCP § 435, “[a]ny party, within the time allowed
to respond to a pleading may serve and file a notice of motion to strike the
whole or any part thereof.” Under CCP § 436(a), “[t]he court may, upon a motion
made pursuant to Section 435, or at any time in its discretion, and upon terms
it deems proper . . . [s]trike out any irrelevant, false, or improper matter
inserted in any pleading.” 
 
Punitive damages are governed by Civ. Code § 3294: “In an
action for the breach of an obligation not arising from contract, where it is
proven by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant has been guilty of
oppression, fraud, or malice, the plaintiff, in addition to the actual damages,
may recover damages for the sake of example and by way of punishing the
defendant.” (Civ. Code § 3294(a).) 
 
To state a prima facie claim for punitive damages, a
complaint must set forth the elements as stated in Civ. Code § 3294. (Coll.
Hosp., Inc. v. Superior Court (1994) 8 Cal.4th 704, 721.) “Malice is
defined in the statute as conduct intended by the defendant to cause injury to
the plaintiff or despicable conduct which is carried on by the defendant with a
willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” (Id.
at 725.) Oppression is “despicable conduct that subjects a person to cruel and
unjust hardship in conscious disregard of that person’s rights.” (Civ. Code §
3294(c)(2).) Fraud is defined as “an intentional misrepresentation, deceit, or
concealment of a material fact known to the defendant with the intention on the
part of the defendant of thereby depriving a person of property or legal rights
or otherwise causing injury.” (Civ. Code § 3294(c)(3).)¿ 
¿ 
Plaintiff has requested punitive damages as part of her
prayer for relief, but nowhere in her FAC does she allege that 818 Restoration
acted with malice, fraud, or oppression. Because she has not alleged that it
acted with malice, fraud, or oppression, she cannot maintain a claim for
punitive damages against 818 Restoration.
 
Defendant’s motion to strike Plaintiff’s request for
punitive damages is granted for 818 Restoration only. It could still apply to
other Defendants.
 
CONCLUSION
Defendant’s demurrer to Plaintiff’s Fourth, Fifth, and
Seventh Causes of Action is sustained with leave to amend. Defendant’s demurrer
to Plaintiff’s Sixth Cause of Action is sustained without leave to amend.
 
Defendant’s motion to strike is granted.
 
Moving party to give notice to all parties.
