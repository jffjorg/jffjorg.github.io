SUMMARY OF
ACTION
On November 30,
2023, Plaintiff Allison M. Harada (Plaintiff) served form interrogatories on Defendant
Carlos Martinez, Jr. (Defendant). Responses to the form interrogatories were
due on January 4, 2024. No responses were served by that date.
 
Plaintiff never
received any responses to her discovery requests. Plaintiff filed this motion
to compel discovery responses to the form interrogatories on April 18, 2024. No
opposition has been filed. Plaintiff also requests sanctions in the amount of
$810.00 against Defendant.
 
Form
Interrogatories
The propounding
party may move for an order compelling responses and monetary sanctions if a
party to whom the interrogatories are directed fails to respond. (CCP §§ 2030.290,
2030.300; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 404.) Responses to interrogatories
are due within thirty days from the date of service of the interrogatories. (CCP
§§ 2030.260(a), 2016.050.) The responding party waives any objections to the
interrogatories by failing to serve responses in a timely manner. (CCP § 2030.290(a).)
 
Defendant has
failed to respond to Plaintiff’s Form Interrogatories. Plaintiff has moved for an
order compelling Defendant’s response to these Interrogatories. The Court
grants Plaintiff’s motion to compel responses to the Form Interrogatories.
 
Sanctions
CCP § 2023.030
authorizes the Court to issue sanctions against a party engaging in conduct
that is a misuse of the discovery process. Failure to respond to discovery,
evasive responses, and objections lacking substantial justification are
“misuses of the discovery process.” (CCP § 2023.010, subd. (d)-(f).)
 
Plaintiff has
requested sanctions in the amount of $810.00 against Defendant. The amount was
based on Plaintiff’s counsel spending 0.5 hours preparing this motion at $750
an hour; an anticipated 0.5 hours reviewing the opposition, preparing a reply,
and attending the hearing, plus the $60 filing fee. (Young Decl., ¶ 9.) While
no opposition was filed, Plaintiff did file a notice of no opposition and will
attend the hearing on this motion; therefore, the Court grants the sanctions in
the full requested amount.
 
Plaintiff’s
request for sanctions against Defendant is granted in the total amount of
$810.00.
 
ORDER
1.      Plaintiff’s
motion to compel responses to the form interrogatories is granted.
2.      Defendant
is ordered to serve responses within twenty (20) days.
3.      Defendant
is ordered to pay sanctions in the total amount of $810.00. Defendant is
ordered to pay these sanctions to Plaintiff’s counsel within twenty (20) days.
