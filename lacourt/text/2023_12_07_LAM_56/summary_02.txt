```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiffs' motion to disqualify Brian Paya as defendants' counsel. The motion was based on the advocate-witness rule, which states that an attorney should not act as an advocate in a trial in which the attorney is likely to be a witness unless certain conditions are met. The judge found that the motion did not provide sufficient evidence or argument regarding whether the plaintiffs intend to call Brian Paya as a witness during the upcoming trial, and that the motion did not explain why disqualification was not sought earlier in the proceedings. The judge also noted that the parties have a strong interest in representation by counsel of their choice and in avoiding the expense and effort involved in replacing counsel. As a result, the judge denied the motion and ordered the moving party to give notice of the ruling.
