And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted a motion filed by Leonard G. Cruz, counsel for Worldwide ATM, Inc., to be relieved as counsel. The motion was unopposed and the court found that the attorney-client relationship had broken down, resulting in the plaintiff terminating Cruz on July 27, 2023. The court has discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw, but will not grant the motion where withdrawal would prejudice the client. In this case, the court finds that the breakdown of the attorney-client relationship is an adequate basis for withdrawal. The court will hold an OSC regarding Plaintiff's representation on January 9, 2024, and will also grant an OSC regarding Plaintiff's representation at a later date.
