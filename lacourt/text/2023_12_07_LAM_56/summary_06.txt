Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the demurrer and motion to strike filed by the defendants, Southern California Immediate Medical Center, et al. The plaintiff, Jane Doe, alleges invasion of privacy, sexual battery, negligent hiring and retention, and premises liability. The defendants argue that the complaint fails to state sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action and seek to strike the complaint and dismiss the action.

The judge finds that the plaintiff's opposition explains the correction of the employee's job title in the complaint and that the defendants' alleged conduct falls within the ambit of CCP section 425.13, subdivision (a). The judge therefore overrules the demurrer to the first cause of action and sustains the demurrer to the fourth cause of action without leave to amend.

The judge also grants the motion to strike the punitive damages allegations, finding that the alleged conduct is directly related to the rendition of professional services. The plaintiff may seek a court order in accordance with CCP section 425.13 if she wishes to pursue punitive damages.
