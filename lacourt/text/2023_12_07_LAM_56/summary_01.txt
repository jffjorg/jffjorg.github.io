And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to seal certain documents that contain personnel records of third-party employees. The documents were filed in support of the plaintiff's opposition to the defendant's motion for summary judgment and the defendant's reply papers. The judge found that the defendant has satisfied its burden to justify the partial sealing of the documents, citing the legally protected interest of public employees in their personnel files. The judge also noted that the documents are not opposed and that the burden rests on the party seeking to deny public access to the records to establish compelling reasons why and to what extent the records should be made private.
