      CASE NO.: 21STCV06362
 
[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER RE: MOTION TO SEAL

            MOVING
PARTY: Defendant The Board of Trustees of the California State University
(“Moving Defendant”)
 
            The
Court has considered the moving papers. 
No opposition papers were filed. 
Any opposition papers were required to have been filed and served at
least nine court days before the hearing under California Code of Civil
Procedure section 1005, subdivision (b). 
 
BACKGROUND
This action arises out of an employment
relationship.  The currently operative
second amended complaint (the “SAC”) alleges: (1) discrimination; (2)
harassment; (3) retaliation; (4) failure to prevent, investigate and remedy harassment and
discrimination; (5) whistleblower retaliation; and (6)
reprisal/retaliation.  
 
On October
13, 2023, Moving Defendant filed a motion to seal (the “Motion”) portions of documents
that were filed in support of Plaintiff’s opposition to Moving Defendant’s
motion for summary judgment and Moving Defendant’s reply papers.  
 
DISCUSSION
Under California
Rules of Court (“CRC”), rule 2.550 (c), unless confidentiality is
required by law, court records are presumed to be open.  (CRC, r. 2.550 (c).) 
Subject to certain exceptions, a court record must not be filed under seal
without a court order.  (Overstock.com, Inc. v. Goldman Sachs Group,
Inc. (2014) 231 Cal.App.4th 471, 486.)  A party requesting that a
record be filed under seal must file a motion or an application for an order
sealing the record.  (CRC, r. 2.551
(b).)  The motion or application must be
accompanied by a memorandum and a declaration containing facts
sufficient to justify the sealing.  (Id.)  In order for records to be sealed, a trial
court must hold a hearing and expressly find that: (1) there exists an
overriding interest supporting closure and/or sealing; (2) there is a
substantial probability that the interest will be prejudiced absent closure
and/or sealing; (3) the proposed closure and/or sealing is narrowly tailored to
serve the overriding interest; and (4) there is no less restrictive means
of achieving the overriding interest.  (Universal City Studios, Inc. v.
Superior Court (2003) 110 Cal.App.4th 1273, 1279.)  Since
court records are public records, the burden rests on the party seeking to deny
public access to those records to establish compelling reasons why and to what
extent these records should be made private.  (Mary R. v. B. & R.
Corp. (1983) 149 Cal.App.3d 308, 317.)  
 
 
            The Motion concerns documents that
contain personnel records of third-party employees. Public employees have a
legally protected interest in their personnel files.  (BRV, Inc. v. Superior Court (2006) 143
Cal.App.4th 742, 756.)  The Court
finds that Moving Defendant has satisfied its burden to justify the partial
sealing of the identified documents.  For
this reason and because it is unopposed, the Court GRANTS the Motion.  (Sexton v. Superior Court
(1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410.)  
 
Moving party is ordered to give notice
of this ruling.
 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed
by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive an email
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off
calendar.

day of December 2023
