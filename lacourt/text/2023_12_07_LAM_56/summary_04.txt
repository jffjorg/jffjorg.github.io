And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion to file a third amended complaint (TAC) that adds Oxnard Tires Inc. (OTI) as a party to the sixth cause of action for fraudulent transfer. The plaintiff, Julio Mendez, seeks to amend the complaint to add OTI as a party, which was inadvertently omitted from the current second amended complaint (SAC). The judge has considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers and finds that the Motion sets forth sufficient facts to permit the filing of the TAC. The judge grants the Motion with five days leave to file the TAC.
