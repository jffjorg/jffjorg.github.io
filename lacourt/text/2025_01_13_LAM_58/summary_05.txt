Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer and motion to strike in the case between Calon Golubski (Plaintiff) and General Motors LLC (GM). The Plaintiff alleged that GM failed to repair a 2023 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 in compliance with the warranty and engaged in fraudulent conduct. The Plaintiff also claimed that GM had a duty to disclose the defects in the vehicle.

The judge sustained the demurrer to the fifth cause of action for fraud, finding that the Plaintiff's allegations did not adequately state a claim for fraud. The judge also granted the motion to strike the request for punitive damages, finding that the Plaintiff did not have a viable fraud-based claim to support the request.

The judge gave the Plaintiff leave to amend the complaint and ordered the Plaintiff to file an amended pleading by February 13, 2025.
