Background
 
            On October 29, 2021, Plaintiff Anderson Hill, individually and behalf of
all aggrieved employees, filed a representative action complaint against
Fashion Nova, LLC, Fashion Nova, Inc., Nova Fashion, Inc., and Fashion Nova
Holdings, LLC. The Complaint alleges a violation of the California Labor Code
Private Attorneys General Act (PAGA) based on allegations that the companies
failed to maintain adequate temperatures in the workplace. 
 
            On November
20, 2024, Plaintiff filed a motion to approve a settlement under PAGA. The
Settlement Agreement defines “aggrieved employees” as “all current and former
hourly, non-exempt employees who worked for Defendant from August 24, 2020
through earlier of the date this settlement is approved by the Court or
November 18, 2024 (PAGA Period).” (Rhodes Decl., Ex. A [PAGA Settlement Agreement], ¶ 1.4.)
The breakdown of the settlement is as follows: 
 
Gross Settlement Amount:                                         $500,000.00  
Plaintiff’s Counsel’s Fees:                                          $175,000
(35%)
Plaintiff’s Counsel’s Litigation Costs:                       $10,788.30
Plaintiff’s Service Award:                                          $10,000.00  
Settlement Administration Costs:                               $32,550.00  
Net Settlement Amount (PAGA Penalties):               $271,661.70
 
Labor Workforce Development Agency (75%):             $203,746.27
Aggrieved Employees (25%):                                    $67,915.43 
 
            Plaintiff seeks court approval of the
PAGA settlement.  
 
Legal Standard
 
            The Private Attorneys General Act is
“a procedural statute allowing an aggrieved employee to recover civil
penalties—for Labor Code violations—that otherwise would be sought by state
labor law enforcement agencies.”  (Amalgamated
Transit Union, Local 1756, AFL-CIO v. Superior Court (2009) 46 Cal.4th 993,
1003.)  The statute provides a mechanism
for private enforcement of Labor Code violations for the public benefit.  (See Arias v. Superior Court (2009) 46
Cal.4th 969, 986.) The statute incentivizes aggrieved employees by providing 25
percent of the recovered civil penalties, while the remaining 75 percent is
distributed to the Labor and Workforce Development Agency (LWDA) “for
enforcement of labor laws…and for education of employers and employees about
their rights and responsibilities under [the Labor Code].”  (Lab. Code, § 2699, subd. (i).)  
 
            “The superior court shall review and
approve any settlement of any civil action filed pursuant to this part [Labor
Code Private Attorneys General Act of 2004].” (Lab. Code, § 2699, subd. (l)(2).)

 
            “[A] trial court should evaluate a
PAGA settlement to determine whether it is fair, reasonable, and adequate in
view of PAGA’s purposes to remediate present labor law violations, deter future
ones, and to maximize enforcement of state labor laws.”  (Moniz v. Adecco USA, Inc. (2021) 72
Cal.App.5th 56, 77.) A court should consider factors used in evaluating class
action settlements, such as the strength of the plaintiff’s case, the risk, the
stage of the proceeding, the complexity and likely duration of further
litigation, and the settlement amount. (Ibid.) Other factors that may be
useful in determining fairness include whether (1) the settlement is the result
of arm’s length bargaining, (2) investigation and discovery are sufficient to
allow counsel and the court to act intelligently, (3) counsel is experienced in
similar litigation, and (4) the percentage of objectors is small.  (Nordstrom Com. Cases (2010) 186
Cal.App.4th 576, 581; Wershba v. Apple Computer, Inc. (2001) 91
Cal.App.4th 224, 245.)  In considering
the amount of settlement, the court is mindful that compromise is inherent and
necessary in the settlement process.  (Wershba,
supra, 91 Cal.App.4th at p. 250.) 
 
Discussion
 
Service on the Labor and Workforce Development Agency
 
            Plaintiff asserts that the proposed
settlement was electronically served on the Labor and Work Force Development
Agency. (Rhodes Decl., ¶ 27, Ex. E.)
 
Fair, Reasonable & Adequate
 
            The Court finds the proposed
settlement is fair, reasonable, and adequate to all concerned parties and is not
the product of fraud, collusion, or overreaching.
 
            Here, the parties attended a
full-day, private mediation, with Monique Ngo-Bonnici, an experienced mediator
with wage-and-hour class and representative actions. (Rhodes Decl., ¶ 21.)  Prior to the mediation, the parties exchanged
informal discovery. (Rhodes Decl., ¶ 21.) This included information on temperature
tracking data, employee handbooks and policy manuals, and employee counts and
pay period data. (Rhodes Decl., ¶ 21.) Although the matter did not settle at
mediation, the parties continued to work towards a reasonable resolution and were
able to reach an arms-length settlement following extensive negotiations, by
and through the mediator. (Rhodes Decl., ¶ 21.) This satisfies the requirement that
the settlement was a result of arms-length bargaining.
 
            Plaintiff’s counsel also avers that
he thoroughly investigated the facts and risks associated with the case. He concedes
the risks with the case. (Rhodes Decl., ¶ 21.) Specifically, Defendant, at all
times, denied the claims. (Rhodes Decl., ¶ 21.) Further, the law is unsettled
as to Plaintiff’s temperature claims. (Rhodes Decl., ¶ 21.) 
 
            Plaintiff also provides a detailed
breakdown of the potential exposure. Defendant estimated there were 12,000
employees affected during the PAGA period. (Rhodes Decl., ¶ 10.) Based on the
risks of establishing the case on the merits, the amount offered in settlement
is reasonable
 
The Court finds that Plaintiff’s counsel has conducted
adequate investigation and use of discovery.
 
Payment Procedures
 
            Within 30 days of the effective
date, Defendants shall pay the $500,000 with the Settlement Administrator. (Rhodes
Decl., Ex. A, ¶ 4.3.) Within 14 days of receiving the gross amount, the
Settlement Administrator will distribute the 25% of the PAGA fund to aggrieved
employees. (Rhodes Decl., Ex. A, ¶ 4.4.) Checks will be valid for 180 days and
any uncashed amount will be sent to the Unclaimed Property division of the
California State Controller’s office in the name of the aggrieved employee. (Rhodes
Decl., Ex. A, ¶¶ 4.4.1, 4.4.4)
 
            The Settlement Administrator will
issue IRS Form 1099s for each settlement payment.  (Rhodes Decl., Ex. A, ¶ 3.2.4.1.)
 
Experience of Counsel
 
            Rhodes attests to his firm’s extensive experience in
class actions and labor and employment cases. 
(Rhodes Decl., ¶¶ 7, 18.)  
 
Attorney’s Fees and Litigation Costs
 
            Plaintiff requests $175,000 in
attorney’s fees and $10,788.30 in costs.
 
            Labor Code section 2699, subdivision
(g)(1) provides “[a]ny employee who prevails in any action shall be entitled to
an award of reasonable attorney’s fees and costs . . . .” (Lab. Code, §
2699(g)(1).)
 
            The Court finds that Plaintiff is
represented by experienced counsel and that the requested attorney fee award is
fair, adequate, and reasonable. The fee requested, $175,000, represents 35% of
the gross settlement, an amount routinely awarded in California courts in class
and PAGA actions. (Chavez v. Netflix, Inc. (2008) 162 Cal.App.4th 43,
66, fn. 11.) None of the parties have objected to this amount. The Court finds
that $175,000 in attorney’s fees is appropriate.
 
            As to costs, Plaintiff provides an
itemized statement. (Rhodes Decl., Ex. C.) The total incurred was $10,788.30,
of which the bulk was the mediation fee ($8,995). These costs are approved.
 
Plaintiff’s Service Award
 
            Plaintiff also requests $10,000 as a
service award for her time and effort exerted on behalf of the aggrieved
employees. (Hill Decl., ¶ 8.) He asserts that he has been actively involved in
the case by engaging in regular communication with the attorneys by discussing
litigation strategy, witnesses, and updates. (Hill Decl., ¶¶ 4-6.) The Court
finds that this amount is reasonable in exchange for a general release of
claims and for a release pursuant to Civil Code section 1542. 
 
Settlement Administration Costs
 
            The parties have agreed to engage ILYM
Group, Inc. (ILYM) as the third-party settlement administrator and requests
court approval of $32,550.00 for administration
costs.  (Rhodes Decl., ¶ 26.) Plaintiff submits ILYM’ bid for settlement administration,
which contains an itemized statement of the various tasks that ILYM will
undertake; ILYM will conduct data analysis, perform skip-tracing as
necessary, calculate and disburse payments, provide tax reporting, re-issue
checks, and perform other administrative tasks. (Rhodes Decl., ¶ 26, Ex. D.)
 
            The Court approves the requested $32,550
in settlement administration costs.
 
Release
 
            The Court finds the release under
the Settlement Agreement is fair and reasonable.  (Rhodes Decl., Ex. A, ¶ 5.)  
 
Conclusion 
 
            The motion to approve settlement of
claims brought under the Private Attorneys General Act is granted.
