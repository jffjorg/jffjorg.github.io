Demurrer to Second Amended Complaint
The court

this demurrer. 
DISCUSSION
Plaintiffs Cecilia Hailey (“Hailey”), Chekarey Byers (“Byers”), and
Timanii Meeks (“Meeks”), on behalf of themselves and other aggrieved employees
(collectively, “Plaintiffs”), filed the operative Second Amended Complaint in
this action on October 19, 2023 against defendants Donda Academy, Inc., and
Kanye West. 
Defendant Ye (f/k/a Kanye West) (“Defendant”) now moves the court for
an order sustaining his demurrer to the sixth and eighth causes of action. 
The court sustains Defendant’s demurrer to plaintiffs Hailey and
Byers’s sixth cause of action for violation of Labor Code section 558.1 because
it does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action since Hailey
and Byers have not alleged facts establishing that Defendant may be held
personally liable for the alleged violations of Labor Code sections 201 and 226
under section 558.1.  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 430.10, subd. (e).)
“Any employer or other person acting on behalf of an employer, who . .
. violates, or causes to be violated, Sections 203, 226, 226.7, 1193.6, 1194,
or 2802, may be held liable as the employer for such violation.”  (Lab. Code, § 558.1, subd. (a).)  As used in this statute, “the term ‘other
person acting on behalf of an employer’ is limited to a natural person who is
an owner, director, officer, or managing agent of the employer, and the term
‘managing agent’ has the same meaning as in subdivision (b) of Section 3294 of
the Civil Code.”  (Lab. Code, § 558.1,
subd. (b).) 
“[T]o be held liable under section 558.1, an ‘owner’ . . . must either
have been personally involved in the purported violation of one or more of the
enumerated provisions; or, absent such personal involvement, had sufficient
participation in the activities of the employer, including, for example, over
those responsible for the alleged wage and hour violations, such that the
‘owner’ may be deemed to have contributed to, and thus for purposes of this
statute, ‘cause[d]’ a violation.”  (Usher
v. White (2021) 64 Cal.App.5th 883, 896-897.)  “However, that does not necessarily mean the
individual must have had involvement in the day-to-day operations of the
company, nor is it required the individual authored the challenged employment
policies or specifically approved their implementation.  But to be held personally liable he or she
must have had some oversight of the company’s operations or some influence on
corporate policy that resulted in Labor Code violations.”  (Espinoza v. Hepta Run, Inc. (2022) 74
Cal.App.5th 44, 59.)
Here, Plaintiffs have not alleged that Defendant is their
employer.  Instead, they have alleged
that Defendant is the founder, owner, and Chief Executive Officer of nonmoving
defendant Donda Academy, Inc., which is alleged to be their employer.[1]  (SAC ¶¶ 1, 11, 13-14, 29.)  As an owner of their employer, Defendant may
be held liable for violations of certain statutes provided that he was
personally involved in those violations, “had sufficient participation in the
activities of the employer . . . , such that [he] may be deemed to have
contributed to, and thus for purposes of this statute, ‘cause[d]’ a
violation[,]” or “had some oversight of the company’s operations or some
influence on corporate policy that resulted in Labor Code violations.”  (Usher, supra, 64 Cal.App.5th
at pp. 896-897; Espinoza, supra, 74 Cal.App.5th at p. 59.)  The court finds that plaintiffs Hailey and
Byers have not alleged facts establishing Defendant’s personal involvement in
the alleged violations or his oversight or influence on Donda Academy, Inc.’s
operations or policy that resulted in the alleged violations of the Labor Code.  (Ibid.) 
The court acknowledges that Hailey and Byers have alleged that
Defendant “has engaged in a pattern and practice of continuously providing
Plaintiffs with inaccurate and untimely wage statements.”  (SAC ¶ 102.)  However, that allegation is conclusory is not
supported by the facts alleged.  (Travelers
Indemnity Company of Connecticut v. Navigators Specialty Insurance Company (2021)
70 Cal.App.5th 341, 358 [courts do not, on demurrer, “‘assume the truth of
contentions, deductions or conclusions of law’”].)  The court also acknowledges that they have
alleged that Defendant influenced the operations of Donda Academy, Inc.
regarding (1) the lack of cleaning staff and requirements on cleaning supplies
(SAC ¶ 21), (2) the lunches eaten by the students (SAC ¶ 22), and (3) the
subjects taught, restrictions on assignments, dress codes, and other rules (SAC
¶ 25).  The court, however, finds that
these allegations are insufficient to establish that Defendant (1) was
personally involved in the alleged wage and hour violations (i.e., failing to
provide Plaintiffs with accurate and timely wage statements), (2) had
sufficient participation in Donda Academy, Inc.’s activities such that he may
be deemed to have contributed to those wage and hour violations, since he is
alleged to have had oversight of the school policies and not its employment
practices, or (3) had oversight of Donda Academy, Inc.’s operations or policy
“that resulted in” the alleged Labor Code violations.  (Usher, supra, 64 Cal.App.5th
at pp. 896-897; Espinoza, supra, 74 Cal.App.5th at p. 59.)
Thus, the court finds that plaintiffs Hailey and Byers have not
alleged facts establishing that Defendant may be held personally liable for the
alleged Labor Code violations pursuant to Labor Code section 558.1.
The court sustains Defendant’s demurrer to Plaintiffs’ eighth cause of
action for violation of Labor Code section 2698 because it does not state facts
sufficient to constitute a cause of action. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (e).)
The court agrees, as noted by Plaintiffs in their opposition papers,
that aggrieved employees may recover civil penalties under the Private
Attorneys General Act of 2004 (PAGA) (Lab. Code, § 2698 et seq.) if “a party other
than the employer ‘violates, or causes to be violated’ the overtime laws
([Lab. Code,] § 558(a) ) or ‘pays or causes to be paid to any employee’ less
than the minimum wage ([Lab. Code,] § 1197.1(a) ) . . . .”  (Atempa v. Pedrazzani (2018) 27
Cal.App.5th 809, 820 [emphasis in original], 812 [concluding that PAGA
“authorizes an aggrieved employee to recover these civil penalties in lieu of
the” Labor and Workforce Development Agency].)  

However, Plaintiffs do not appear to base their request for civil
penalties on either Labor Code section 558 or Labor Code section 1197.1.  (SAC ¶ 118 [Plaintiffs are entitled to
civil penalties “for violations of California Labor Code §§ 98.6, 1102.5,
6310, 200, 201, 202, 203, 204, 221, and 226(a)”].)  Moreover, even if Plaintiffs’ eighth cause of
action were based on those statutes, Plaintiffs did not allege facts
establishing (1) Defendant “violate[d], or caused to be violated, a section of
this chapter” under Labor Code section 558, subdivision (a), or (2) that
Defendant, in acting as an officer, agent, or employee of another person (i.e.,
Donda Academy, Inc.), “pa[id] or cause[d] to be paid to any employee a wage
less than the minimum fixed by an applicable state or local law, or by an order
of the commission” under Labor Code section 1197.1, subdivision (a).  Thus, the court finds that Plaintiffs have
not alleged facts establishing that they may recover civil penalties from
Defendant under PAGA. 
The
burden is on the plaintiff “to articulate how it could amend its pleading to
render it sufficient.”¿ (Palm Springs Villas II Homeowners Assn., Inc. v.
Parth (2016) 248 Cal.App.4th 268, 290.)¿ To satisfy that burden, a
plaintiff “must show in what manner he can amend his complaint and how that
amendment will change the legal effect of his pleading.”¿ (Goodman v.
Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 349.) 
Plaintiffs have asserted that they can allege specific facts
establishing Defendant’s involvement in the financial decisions of Donda
Academy, Inc.  (Opp., pp.
8:26-9:23.)  Thus, the court finds that
Plaintiffs have met their burden to show how they can amend their pleading and
therefore grants their request for leave to amend.
ORDER
            The court sustains defendant Ye
f/k/a Kanye West’s demurrer to (1) plaintiffs Cecilia Hailey and Chekarey
Byers’s sixth cause of action for violation of Labor Code section 558.1, and
(2) plaintiffs Cecilia Hailey, Chekarey Byers, and Timanii Meeks, on behalf of
themselves and other aggrieved employees’ eighth cause of action for violation
of Labor Code section 2698. 
            The court grants plaintiffs Cecilia
Hailey, Chekarey Byers, and Timanii Meeks, on behalf of themselves and other
aggrieved employees 20 days leave to file a Third Amended Complaint that cures
the defects in the sixth and eighth causes of action discussed above. 
            The court orders defendant Ye f/k/a
Kanye West to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
