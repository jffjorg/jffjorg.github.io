And here is the English-text summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge is considering a motion by Andrew J. Knez, counsel for defendant James Jones, to be relieved as counsel for defendant. The motion is unopposed and the Judge has reviewed the moving papers filed in connection with this motion. The Judge finds that the motion should be granted and that the attorney-client relationship between defendant and counsel can be terminated without undue prejudice to the client's interests. The Judge also finds that counsel has shown sufficient reasons why the motion should be granted and why counsel brought the motion under Code of Civil Procedure section 284, subdivision (2) instead of filing a consent under section 284, subdivision (1). The Judge orders Andrew J. Knez to be relieved as counsel for defendant James Jones effective upon the filing of proof of service of the signed "Order Granting Attorney's Motion to be Relieved as Counsel - Civil" on the client.
