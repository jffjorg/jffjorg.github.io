MOVING PARTIES:              Plaintiffs AWI Builders, Inc.,
Construction Contractors Corporation, Zhirayr “Robert” Mekikyan, and Anna
Mekikyan                    
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Unopposed
Motion to Substitute Estate of Susan Masako Nakagama in Place of
Deceased Defendant
The court
considered the moving papers filed in connection with this motion.  No opposition papers were filed.
DISCUSSION
Plaintiffs AWI Builders, Inc., Construction Contractors Corporation,
Zhirayr “Robert” Mekikyan, and Anna Mekikyan (“Plaintiffs”) move the court for
an order substituting the “Estate of Susan Masako Nakagama” (the “Estate”) in
place of deceased defendant Susan Nakagama (“Defendant”) in this action. 
First, as a threshold matter, the court notes that Plaintiffs lodged,
on April 18, 2024, a “Joint Stipulation and [Proposed] Order” purporting to
stipulate to the substitution requested by Plaintiffs in this motion.  However, the stipulation is incomplete.  Specifically, the parties’ stipulation (1)
leaves blank the spaces identifying counsel for the relevant parties, and (2)
states that the parties stipulate “that the court enter an order that _______
is substituted [for] Susan Nakagama.” 
(Joint Stip., p. 2:1, 2:10-12.) 
While the court notes that the stipulation further states that “there is
no opposition or objection by the parties to the substitution requested” by
Plaintiffs in connection with their pending motion, the court (1) notes, as set
forth below, that Plaintiffs have not cited authority establishing that the Estate
is a proper party, and (2) cannot enter an order on an incomplete
stipulation.  (Joint Stip., p. 2:9.) 
Second, the court denies Plaintiffs’ motion to substitute the Estate
in this action in place of Defendant.  
“[A] cause of action against a decedent that survives may be asserted
against the decedent’s personal representative or, to the extent provided by
statute, against the decedent’s successor in interest.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 377.40.)  “On motion, the court shall allow a pending
action or proceeding against the decedent that does not abate to be continued
against the decedent’s personal representative or, to the extent provided by
statute, against the decedent’s successor in interest, except that the court may
not permit an action or proceeding to be continued against the personal
representative unless proof of compliance with Part 4 (commencing with Section
9000) of Division 7 of the Probate Code governing creditor claims is first
made.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 377.41.)

As set forth above, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections
377.40 and 377.41, surviving causes of action against a decedent may be
asserted against “the decedent’s personal representative” or, if allowed
by statute, “the decedent’s successor in interest[.]”  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 377.40, 377.41
[emphasis added].)  These statutes do not
authorize the court to substitute the Estate, which is not a legal entity and
ordinarily cannot be sued, in place of Defendant.  (Gee v. Greyhound Lines, Inc. (2016) 6
Cal.App.5th 477, 481, n. 2 [“‘An “estate” is not a legal entity and is neither
a natural nor artificial person.  It is
merely a name to indicate the sum total of the assets and liabilities of a
decedent . . . .  [Citations.]  An “estate” can neither sue nor be
sued.’  [Citation.]”].)  Further, Plaintiffs have not cited any
authority establishing otherwise.[1]

Third, the court notes that Plaintiffs have argued that one plaintiff
has complied with the requirements of Probate Code section 9370, which provides
that an action “may not be continued against a decedent’s personal
representative unless” three conditions are satisfied.  (Mot., pp. 5:16-6:3; Prob. Code, § 9730,
subd. (a) [emphasis added].)  However,
Plaintiffs’ motion does not request that the court substitute Defendant’s
personal representative in place of Defendant. 
Instead, as set forth above, Plaintiffs have requested that the court
enter an order “substituting the ‘Estate of Susan Masako Nakagama’ in place of
Defendant ‘Susan Nakagama’, an individual[.]” 
(Notice of Mot., p. 2:5-11.) 
Thus, compliance with Probate Code section 9370 by any plaintiff does
not support their request for an order substituting the Estate in place of
Defendant.  (Prob. Code, § 9730,
subd. (a).) 
The court therefore denies Plaintiffs’ motion, without prejudice to
Plaintiffs’ filing a motion that requests that the court make a proper
substitution in place of Defendant. 
ORDER
            The court denies, without prejudice,
plaintiffs AWI Builders, Inc., Construction Contractors Corporation, Zhirayr
“Robert” Mekikyan, and Anna Mekikyan’s motion to substitute estate of Susan
Masako Nakagama in place of deceased defendant Susan Nakagama.
            The court orders plaintiffs AWI
Builders, Inc., Construction Contractors Corporation, Zhirayr “Robert”
Mekikyan, and Anna Mekikyan to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
