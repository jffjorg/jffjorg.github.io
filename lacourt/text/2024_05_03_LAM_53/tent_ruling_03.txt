  Order RE:
 
plaintiff’s motion to compel further
  responses to requests for admission
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                 Plaintiff Seran Ng, D.M.D.,
Inc.
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Defendant Yang Lu
Motion to Compel Further Responses to Requests for Admission
Plaintiff Seran Ng, D.M.D. Inc. (“Plaintiff”) filed the pending motion
to compel further responses on January 16, 2024, moving the court for an order
(1) compelling defendant Yang Lu (“Defendant”) to serve further responses to
Plaintiff’s Requests for Admission, Set Nine, numbers 106-113, and (2) awarding
monetary sanctions in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant in the amount of
$5,261.65.
The court notes that, on December 20, 2023, Defendant filed a motion
for a protective order seeking an order that Defendant need not respond to
certain discovery requests propounded by Plaintiff.  (Def. Mot. for Protective Order, p.
9:18-20.)  The court has advanced the
hearing on Defendant’s motion to June 28, 2024. 
(April 26, 2024 Minute Order, p. 1.) 
The court finds that it is appropriate, and exercises its discretion,
to continue the hearing on Plaintiff’s pending motion to compel Defendant’s
further responses so that it may be heard on the same date as Defendant’s
motion for a protective order. 
ORDER
            The court orders that the hearing on
plaintiff Seran Ng, D.M.D. Inc.’s motion to compel further responses to requests
for admission is continued to June 28, 2024, at 10:00 a.m., in Department 53.
            The court orders plaintiff Seran Ng,
D.M.D. Inc.  to give notice of this
ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
 
DATED:  May 3, 2024
