MOVING PARTY:                 Michael L. Tusken
 
RESPONDING PARTY:        Unopposed
(1)  
Motion
to be Relieved as Counsel for Defendant Shahram Elyaszadeh
(2)  
Motion
to be Relieved as Counsel for Defendant E&E Mortgage Bankers Corporation
The court
considered the moving papers filed in connection with each motion.  No opposition papers were filed.
DISCUSSION
Michael L. Tusken (“Defendants’ Counsel”) separately moves to be
relieved as counsel for (1) defendant Shahram Elyaszadeh (“Elyaszadeh”) and (2)
defendant E&E Mortgage Bankers Corporation (“E&E”).  In the interest of efficiency, the court
discusses the two motions to be relieved as counsel for Defendants together. 
“The
question of granting or denying an application of an attorney to withdraw as
counsel (Code Civ. Proc., § 284, subd. 2) is one which lies within the sound
discretion of the trial court ‘having in mind whether such withdrawal might
work an injustice in the handling of the case.’”¿ (People v. Prince
(1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398, 406 [internal quotations omitted].)¿ The court
should also consider whether the attorney’s “withdrawal can be accomplished
without undue prejudice to the client’s interests.”¿ (Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994)
21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915.)¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
For
a motion to be relieved as counsel under Code of Civil Procedure section 284,
subdivision (2), California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362 requires (1) a notice
of motion and motion directed to the client (made on the Notice of Motion and
Motion to be Relieved as Counsel -- Civil form (MC-051)); (2) a declaration
stating in general terms and without compromising the confidentiality of the
attorney-client relationship why a motion under Code of Civil Procedure section
284, subdivision (2) is brought instead of filing a consent under Code of Civil
Procedure section 284, subdivision (1) (made on the Declaration in Support of
Attorney’s Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel -- Civil form (MC-052)); (3)
service of the notice of motion and motion, declaration, and proposed order on
the client and on all other parties who have appeared in the case; and (4) the
proposed order relieving counsel (prepared on the Order Granting Attorney’s
Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel -- Civil form (MC-053)).¿¿ 
The court finds that Defendants’ Counsel has served (1) defendant
Elyaszadeh with the moving papers at Elyaszadeh’s last known address, which
Defendants’ Counsel has confirmed within the past 30 days is current, (2)
defendant E&E with the moving papers at E&E’s last known address, which
Defendants’ Counsel has confirmed within the past 30 days is current, and (3)
counsel for plaintiff Manoucher Sarbaz[1]
with the moving papers as required by rule 3.1362.  (MC-052 as to Elyaszadeh, ¶ 3, subds.
(a)(2), (b)(1)(c); MC-052 as to E&E, ¶ 3, subds. (a)(2), (b)(1)(c);
Proofs of Service.)  The court also finds
that Defendants’ Counsel has shown sufficient reasons why the motions should be
granted, and why counsel brought the motions under Code of Civil Procedure
section 284, subdivision (2) instead of filing a consent under section 284,
subdivision (1).  (MC-052 forms, ¶ 2.) 
The court therefore grants Defendants Counsel’s (1) motion to be
relieved as counsel for defendant Shahram Elyaszadeh, and (2) motion to be
relieved as counsel for defendant E&E Mortgage Bankers Corporation. 
Michael L. Tusken will be relieved as counsel for defendants Shahram
Elyaszadeh and E&E Mortgage Bankers Corporation effective upon the filing of the proof of service of the
signed “Order[s] Granting Attorney’s Motion to be Relieved as Counsel – Civil”
on the clients.
The court orders Michael L.
Tusken to give notice of this
ruling and the signed “Order[s] Granting Attorney’s Motion to be Relieved as
Counsel – Civil” to defendants Shahram Elyaszadeh and E&E
Mortgage Bankers Corporation and to all other parties who have appeared in this
action. 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
