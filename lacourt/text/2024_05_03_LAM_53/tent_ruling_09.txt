The court notes that Defendants’ Counsel appears to have served counsel for
plaintiff at the incorrect mailing address. 
Specifically, Defendants’ Counsel served counsel for plaintiff at the
address 35 N. Lake Avenue, Suite 700, Pasadena, California, 91101.  (MC-051 forms, Proof of Service; MC-052
forms, Proof of Service.)  But on January
23, 2024, counsel for plaintiff filed a “Notice of Change of Address or Other
Contact Information,” updating counsel’s address to 200 E. Carrillo Street,
Suite 100, Santa Barbara, California, 93101. 
(Jan. 23, 2024 Not. of Change of Address, ¶ 2.)  However, Defendants’ Counsel also served
counsel for plaintiff at the correct email address and therefore has satisfied
rule 3.1362, subdivision (d).
