Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted cross-complainant Kiewit's motion for leave to amend its cross-complaint to add a claim for express indemnity against cross-cross-defendant CST Industries, Inc. Kiewit seeks to add this claim because it has discovered a contract between itself and Conservatek, the manufacturer of the tank covers, which contains an indemnification provision. Kiewit argues that it has acted in good faith and that the amendment is timely. The court finds that Kiewit complied with the rules governing motions to amend and that the amendment will not prejudice cross-defendant CST. The court also finds that the dispute should be resolved in one case rather than in separate lawsuits. The motion is granted, and cross-complainant Kiewit is ordered to file its First Amended Cross-Complaint within five days.
