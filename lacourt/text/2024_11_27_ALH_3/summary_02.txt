The judge has sustained the demurrer to each of these causes of action, finding that they do not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. The judge has also granted Fortner's motion to strike the prayer for punitive damages in connection with the First Cause of Action for financial elder abuse. The judge has given plaintiff 20 days to amend the Complaint. The case is set for a hearing on the demurrer on November 27, 2024.
