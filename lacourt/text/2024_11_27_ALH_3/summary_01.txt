And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to compel responses to Special Interrogatories (Set One) and for monetary sanctions. The defendant, XiaoYan Chen, served the interrogatories on the plaintiff, Henry Huang, and Powastar, Inc., but no responses were received. The defendant then filed a motion to compel responses and for sanctions. The plaintiff argues that responses were served on August 21, 2024, but the judge finds that the motion to compel is denied as moot since responses have been served.

The judge also grants the request for sanctions against the plaintiff and counsel of record, jointly and severally, in the amount of $461.65. This is because the plaintiff failed to serve timely responses and did not exercise diligence in monitoring their email inbox. The judge also orders the plaintiff's counsel to show cause why they should not be reported to the State Bar for violating their duty of candor by citing to manufactured case law.

The judge schedules an OSC for December 4, 2024, to address the issue of whether the plaintiff's counsel should be reported to the State Bar.
