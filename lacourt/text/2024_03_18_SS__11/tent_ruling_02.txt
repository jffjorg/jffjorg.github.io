Plaintiff claims Kaiser’s notices of privacy practices expressly state that
Kaiser will get the user’s express consent before disclosing personal health
information.  (See id. at p. 7.)  The notices are not part of the record, and
there is no request to judicially notice them. 
The

The Court is judicially noticing Exhibit A because it is a public document
filed with the federal government.

Federated is distinguishable.  The
Federated complaint alleged that the defendant “merely s[old] and
install[ed] the recording system.”  (Federated,
supra, 2015 WL 13273308, at *10.) 
Plaintiff’s complaint alleges interception, collection, and transmission
to Defendant’s servers.

Defendant claims “Plaintiff did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy
because Kaiser squarely disclosed in its Privacy Statement that data is shared
with third-party providers like Adobe.” 
(Motion, p. 13.)  This argument is
discussed in the consent section.  To repeat,
consent is a factual issue.

of the right-of-privacy and intrusion elements “is effectively identical” such
that both claims often get analyzed together. 
(Google, supra, 428 F.Supp.3d at 196.)

Plaintiff also cites paragraphs 31, 32, and 52. 
(See Opposition, p. 16.)  They say
nothing about Defendant’s purported knowledge of receiving stolen property.  (See Complaint, ¶¶ 31, 32, 52.)


[7] The Court agrees with Defendant that the damages
allegations are conclusory.  Paragraph 89
states that unauthorized access to Plaintiff’s private information “has
diminished the value” of the data. 
(Complaint, ¶ 89.)  Paragraph 190
states that Plaintiff has been “damaged[.]”  (Id. at ¶ 190.)  Plaintiff should amend to add facts
explaining the alleged diminishment.  (See
Motion, pp. 14-15; see also Reply, pp. 7-8.)
