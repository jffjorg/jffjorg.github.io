BACKGROUND:
 
On February
7, 2024, Petitioner Progressive Insurance Company (“Petitioner”) filed its Petition
to Open Superior Court File for Purposes of Obtaining Jurisdiction Over
Uninsured Motorist Matter (“Petition”) against Respondent Philip Turner
(“Respondent”). The underlying issue in this matter involves an ongoing
arbitration regarding an uninsured motorist claim. 
 
On February
15, 2024, Petitioner filed two copies of Judicial Council Form POS-020, Proof
of Personal Service—Civil. 
 
On February
23, 2024, Petitioner filed: (1) Motion to Compel Verified Answers without
Objections to Interrogatories (No. 2) [and] Request for Sanctions (“SROGs
Motion”); and (2) Motion to Compel Verified Answers Without Objections to
Demand for Identification and Production of Document (No. 2) [and] Request for
Sanctions (“RPDs Motion”). 
 
No
oppositions or other responses have been filed regarding the discovery motions.

 
ANALYSIS:
 
I.         
Legal Standard
 
California Code of Civil Procedure requires a
response from the party to whom form interrogatories, special interrogatories,
and demand requests are propounded within 30 days after service of the
requests, unless the time is extended by agreement of the parties. (Code Civ.
Proc., §§ 2030.260, subd. (a), 2030.270, subd. (a), 2031.260, subd. (a),
2031.270, subd. (a).) If a party fails to serve timely responses, "the
party making the demand may move for an order compelling response to the
demand.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (b).) By failing to respond, the
offending party waives any objection to the demand. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.290, subd. (a).)
 
For a motion to compel, all a propounding
party must show is that it properly served its discovery requests, that the
time to respond has expired, and that the party to whom the requests were
directed failed to provide a timely response. (See Leach v. Super. Ct.
(1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 902, 905, 906.) Indeed, "[o]nce [a party] 'fail[ed]
to serve a timely response,' the trial court had authority to grant [opposing
party's] motion to compel responses." (Sinaiko Healthcare Counseling,
Inc. v. Pac. Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 405.)
 
The court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel motions for
interrogatories or requests for production, unless the Court finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust. If a party then fails
to obey an order compelling answers, the court may make those orders that are
just, including the imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a
terminating sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In
lieu of or in addition to that sanction, the court may impose a monetary
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). (Code Civ. Proc.,
§§ 2030.290, subd. (c), 2031.300, subd. (c).)
 
II.      
Discussion
 
A.      The
Discovery Requests
 
“[T]he uninsured motorist law grants the superior court the exclusive
jurisdiction to hear discovery matters arising under uninsured motorist
arbitrations.” (Miranda v. 21st Century Ins. Co. (2004) 117 Cal.App.4th
913, 926, italics in original, citing Ins. Code, § 11580.2, subd. (f).)
 
        Here, Petitioners moves the Court to compel
Respondent to serve responses to special interrogatories (“SROGs”) and requests
for production of documents (“RPDs”) that were served by Petitioner on
Respondent on November 13, 2023. (SROGs Motion, Exh. A, Proof of Service; RPDs
Motion, Exh. A, Proof of service.)
 
        Respondent has not opposed or other
responded to the motions. 
 
        Petitioner’s Counsel declares that no
such responses have been served. (SROGs Motion, Decl. Calendo, ¶¶ 10, 14; RPDs
Motion, Decl. Calendo, ¶¶ 10, 14.)
 
        The Court GRANTS the SROGs Motion.
 
        The Court GRANTS the RPDs Motion.  
 
        Respondent shall serve responses to the
SROGs and RPDs within thirty (30) days of the issuance of this Order. 
 
 
B.      Sanctions
 
Petitioner requests $781.65 in monetary sanctions for each of
the motions.
 
Petitioner’s Counsel declares: (1) that they charge $180.00 per hour;
(2) that they incurred three hours of work for each of the motions; and (3)
that they incurred $61.65 in costs for each of the motions. (SROGs Motion, Decl. Calendo, ¶ 15;
RPDs Motion, Decl. Calendo, ¶ 15.)
 
        However, it appears that Respondent
is in pro per.  To the pro per
litigant, “interrogatories, requests for admissions, law and motion
proceedings, and the like” are “baffling devices.”  (Bruno v. Superior Court (1990) 219
Cal.App.3d 1359, 1363, quoting Burley v. Stein (1974) 40 Cal.App.3d 752,
755, fn. 3.)
 
        The Court declines to award sanctions.
 
 
III.     Conclusion
 
The SROGs Motion is GRANTED. 
The RPDs Motion is GRANTED.  The
request for sanctions is DENIED.
 
        Respondent shall serve responses to the SROGs
and RPDs within thirty (30) days of the issuance of this Order.
