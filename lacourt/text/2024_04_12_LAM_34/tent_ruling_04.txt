ANALYSIS:
 
I.         
Legal Standard
 
“Except as otherwise expressly
provided by statute, a prevailing party is entitled as a matter of right to
recover costs in any action or proceeding.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1032, subd.
(b).)
 
Prevailing
parties seeking to claim costs must comply with California Rules of Court, rule
3.1700(a), and parties seeking to contest costs must comply with California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1700(b). 
 
The Court separately considers each category of contested costs,
including: (1) whether they are specifically allowable or specifically
prohibited; (2) whether they were incurred (irrespective of whether or not
paid); (3) whether they were reasonably necessary to the conduct of the
litigation rather than merely convenient or beneficial to its preparation; and
(4) whether they are reasonable in amount. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1033.5, subds.
(a), (b), and (c)(1)–(3).
 
“Items not mentioned in this section and items assessed upon
application may be allowed or denied in the court’s discretion.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (c)(4); see also Foothill-De Anza Cmty. Coll.
Dist. v. Emerich (2007) 158 Cal.App.4th 11, 30.)
 
II.      
Discussion
 
A.      The Parties’ Arguments
 
Defendant claims $16,709.68 in costs,
which are comprised of:
 
(1)       $452.40 in filing and motion fees;
 
(2)       $9,452.85 in deposition costs;
 
(3)       $123.00 in service costs;
 
(4)       $45.00 in witness fees;
 
(5)       $2,847.25 in interpreter fees;
 
(6)       $40.00 in electronic filing or service fees; and
 
(7)       $3,749.18 in “other” costs. 
 
(KLF Memorandum, p. 1.)
 
        Plaintiff moves the
Court to tax: (1) $2,100.00 in deposition fees for the depositions of Sarah Lee
and Steve Chang; (2) $1,196.00 in a deposition room fee; (3) $159.69 for a
hotel fee; and (4) $2,100.00 in mediation fees. (Motion to Tax Costs, pp. 3:22,
4:22, 5:6, 5:14.)
 
        Defendant disagrees,
arguing that all of these costs were necessary and reasonable. (Opposition, p.
3:4–6, 5:8–10, 5:1–2, 6:5, 7:1–2.)
 
B.      The Deposition Costs
 
1.      Legal Standard
 
“The following items are allowable as costs under Section 1032: . . .
Taking, video recording, and transcribing necessary depositions, including an
original and one copy of those taken by the claimant and one copy of
depositions taken by the party against whom costs are allowed.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (a)(3)(A).)
 
2.      Discussion
 
The deposition costs, including those for
copying the transcripts and the room to allow the transcripts to be taken, are
allowable. After considering the arguments made by both sides, the Court finds
that these costs were reasonable and will allow them. 
 
C.      The Hotel Costs
 
1.      Legal Standard
 
“The following items are allowable as
costs under Section 1032: . . . Travel expenses to attend depositions.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (a)(3)(C).)
 
2.      Discussion
 
The hotel fee was incurred in relation
with taking a deposition. Thus, this cost is allowable. After considering the
arguments made by both sides, the Court finds that this cost was reasonable and
will allow it. 
 
D.      The Mediation Costs
 
Mediation is not a cost that is
specifically allowed or disallowed. 
 
The Court did not order mediation. The
Court declines to exercise its discretion to allow the mediation costs. 
 
III.

The Motion to Tax Costs is GRANTED in part. Defendant KLF Logistics,
Inc.’s costs are TAXED by $2,100.00, as indicated in the spreadsheet below.
