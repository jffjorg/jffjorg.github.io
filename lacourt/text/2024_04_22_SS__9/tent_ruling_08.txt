 Case Number:  24STCP00279    Hearing Date:   April 22, 2024    Dept:  9 The petition and OSC are continued to May
20, 2024 at 9:30 am because the Court’s concerns regarding an arrest dated June
1, 2019 in Alhambra have not been adequately addressed. The March 11, 2024 minute order provided:
“The criminal history assessment is somewhat unclear as to the disposition of
an arrest dated June 1, 2019 in Alhambra. The hearing on this matter is
continued to April 22, 2024 at 9:30 a.m. for the Court Clerk to attempt to run
a more comprehensive criminal history for Petitioner, including the outcome of
the case for which Petitioner was arrested on June 1, 2019 in Alhambra.”  The Clerk’s Office has not re-run the criminal
history as requested since the March 11 minute order.  Accordingly, the Court hereby again orders
the Clerk’s Office to re-run the criminal history assessment no later than one week
prior to the continued hearing date.   In addition, the Court orders
Petitioner to (1) file a Declaration under penalty attesting to the outcome of
the June 1, 2019 arrest in Alhambra, including any further investigation of
which Petitioner is aware, whether charges were ever filed, and the outcome of
any such criminal proceedings; and (2) to appear either in person or remotely
via LACourtConnect at the continued hearing to answer any further questions that
the Court may have upon reviewing Petitioner’s declaration.  Petitioner must file the declaration no later
than one week prior to the continued hearing. 
Failure to timely file the declaration or to appear at the continued
hearing may result in denial of the petition. 
Court
Clerk to give notice.
