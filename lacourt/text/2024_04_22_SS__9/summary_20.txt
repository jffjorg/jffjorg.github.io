And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the petition for a name change. However, the judge has specified that the proposed decree must be corrected to ensure that the new name is clearly written and correctly spelled. If the proposed decree is not corrected, the petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. Once the proposed decree is signed, it cannot be amended without a new petition to change name. A copy of the signed decree will be available in the Clerk's Office seven days after the hearing date.
