And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

"The court grants the petition to modify the proposed decree. The petitioner must ensure that the new name is clearly written and correctly spelled on the proposed decree. If the new name meets these requirements, no appearance is necessary. However, if the new name is not clearly written and correctly spelled, the petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. A copy of the signed decree will be available in Room 112 of the Clerk's Office seven days after the date of the hearing. Once the proposed decree is signed, it cannot be amended without a new petition to change name."
