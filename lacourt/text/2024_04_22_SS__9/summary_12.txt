If satisfied, no appearance is necessary. However, if the new name is not clearly written and correctly spelled, the Petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. Once the proposed decree is signed, it cannot be amended without a new petition to change the name. A copy of the signed decree will be available in Room 112 of the Clerk's Office seven days after the hearing date.
