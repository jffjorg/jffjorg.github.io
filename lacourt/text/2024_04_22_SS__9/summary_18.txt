The judge has tentatively ruled to continue the petition to June 3, 2024, at 9:30 am. The petitioner is required to file proof of publication no later than one week before the continued hearing date. Failure to do so will result in the denial and dismissal of the petition without prejudice. Additionally, the petitioner must file proof of service on the other parent or a declaration explaining why such service could not be made no later than 10 days before the continued hearing. The Court Clerk will give notice of this ruling.
