And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

"In a pending case, the court has ordered the Clerk's Office to re-run a criminal history assessment on the Petitioner. The original assessment on March 11, 2024, yielded a vague notation of 'no information found', which is unclear as to whether it means the Petitioner cannot be identified or has no arrests or convictions. The court has continued the petition to April 29, 2024, and instructed the Clerk's Office to provide a clear notation on any convictions, including those requiring sex offender registration. The court will reconvene on April 29, 2024, at 9:30 am."
