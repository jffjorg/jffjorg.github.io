And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is a response to the Petitioner's petition. The Judge expresses concern about the ambiguity of the Clerk's Office's notation on March 7, 2024, which states "no information found." The Judge is unsure whether this means that the Petitioner cannot be identified or if the Petitioner has no arrests or convictions. The Judge orders the Clerk's Office to re-run the criminal history assessment and provide a clearer notation on the Petitioner's criminal history, including any offenses that require sex offender registration. The Judge schedules the petition for a hearing on April 29, 2024, at 9:30 am.
