TENTATIVE RULING

HEARING DATE


March 14, 2024




CASE NUMBER


23STCV09936




MOTION


Motion to Seal Minor’s Compromise Petition




MOVING PARTY


Plaintiffs Janine Paredes and Jacob Alexander Paredes




OPPOSING PARTY


None



 
MOTION
 
              Plaintiffs
Janine Paredes and Jacob Alexander Paredes (“Plaintiffs”) move to seal Jacob
Paredes’s Minor’s Compromise Petition (MC-350), and the corresponding Order
(MC-351) and proof of deposit. No opposition has been filed.  
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
To grant a motion to seal, the court must expressly find
that: (1) an overriding interest exists that overcomes the right of public
access to the record; (2) the overriding interest supports sealing the records;
(3) a substantial probability exists that the overriding interest will be
prejudiced if the record is not sealed; (4) the proposed sealing is narrowly
tailored; and (5) no less restrictive means exist to achieve the
overriding interest.  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.550(d); see¿McGuan v.
Endovascular Technologies, Inc.¿(2010) 182 Cal.App.4th 974, 988.)  
 
Unless confidentiality is required by law, court records
are presumed to be open to the public, pursuant to a potent “open court” policy
undergirded by the First Amendment and favoring the public nature of court
proceedings.  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.550(c); see NBC
Subsidiary (KNBC-TV), Inc. v. Superior Court (1999) 20
Cal.4th 1178, 1199-10.)  Consequently, pleadings, motions, discovery
documents, and other papers may not be filed under seal merely by stipulation
of the parties; filing under seal requires a court order.  (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 2.551(a); see H.B. Fuller Co. v. Doe¿(2007) 151
Cal.App.4th 879, 888.) “Policy reasons to restrict access are ‘anything which
tends to undermine that sense of security for individual rights, whether of
personal liberty or private property, which any citizen ought to feel has a
tendency to be injurious to the public or the public good.’ [Citation.]” (Copley
Press, Inc. v. Superior Court (1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 367, 373.)
 
In Hinshaw v.
Superior Court (1996) 51 Cal.App.4th 233, 242, the court found that
private, non-governmental parties have a privacy interest in maintaining
confidentiality of settlement agreements that contain personal financial
information. The court has also found that the public at large may have an
interest in knowing settlement terms when a public entity settles a lawsuit,
especially when it involves how public funds are spent. (See Copley Press,
Inc. v. Superior Court (1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 367, 376.) 
 
A sealing order must be sought by means of a motion (or
application) and accompanied by a memorandum of points and authorities, as well
as evidence and testimony containing facts sufficient to justify the mandatory
findings required to support a sealing order.  (Cal. Rules of Court, rules
2.550(d) and 2.551(b).)  The proponent of the sealing order must also
conditionally lodge the unredacted matter to be sealed with the
court.  (Id., rule 2.551(b)(4).) 
 
DISCUSSION
 
             Here, Plaintiffs advance the Declaration of Mark
Peacock who asserts that Jacob Paredes has a right to privacy regarding
financial information and that he could become subject to solicitations from unscrupulous
individuals if the petition is not sealed. (Peacock Decl. ¶ 5-6.) The Court
notes the settlement is between private parties, Plaintiffs and Defendant
Siesta Inn. (Id. ¶ 3.) The Court finds that there exists an overriding interest
that overcomes the right of public access to the records, the overriding
interest supports sealing the records, and a substantial probability exists
that the overriding interest will be prejudiced if the records are not sealed. 
 
The proposed sealing is narrowly tailored because this motion only
concerns the petition for a minor’s compromise and documents supporting the
petition. Because Plaintiffs must file minor’s compromise petitions to proceed
with settlement, there are no less restrictive means available.   
 
Plaintiffs have filed redacted versions of the documents to be sealed
and lodged unredacted copies with the Court.
 
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
 
Therefore, the Court GRANTS Plaintiffs’ motion to seal. The following
documents in their unredacted form are to be filed under seal: (1) Jacob
Paredes’s Minor’s Compromise Petition, (2) Order Approving Minor’s Compromise,
and (3) Proof of Deposit.
 
Plaintiffs shall give notice of the Court’s order, and file proof of
service of such.
