And here is a summary in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling in the matter of Maria Lozano Medina and Margarito Esparza Islas, where their counsel, Brian E. Claypool, is seeking to be relieved as counsel due to a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship. The Court finds that this is a valid reason for withdrawal, but notes that Counsel has not included information about future proceedings in the motion. The Court orders Counsel to file updated proposed orders within 5 calendar days, and to serve the signed orders within 10 days. The Court grants the motion conditionally, pending Counsel's compliance with these requirements.
