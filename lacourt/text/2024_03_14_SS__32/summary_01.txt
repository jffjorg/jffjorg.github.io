And here is the English text summary:

The court has issued a tentative ruling granting the defendant's motion to dismiss the plaintiff's complaint with prejudice. The plaintiff, Mamie Russell, filed a complaint against the defendant, Pomona Healthcare & Wellness Center, LLC, alleging elder abuse and neglect under the Elder Abuse and Dependent Adult Child Protection Act and a violation of the Patient Bill of Rights. The defendant demurred to the complaint, and the court granted leave to amend the complaint if an application for a guardian ad litem or proper appearance was made within 20 days. However, the plaintiff failed to amend the complaint and did not file an opposition to the motion to dismiss. Therefore, the court grants the motion to dismiss and dismisses the entire complaint with prejudice. The defendant is ordered to provide notice and file a proof of service of the dismissal.
