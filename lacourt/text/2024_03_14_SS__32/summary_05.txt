And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling grants the motion to seal the Minor's Compromise Petition (MC-350), Order Approving Minor's Compromise (MC-351), and Proof of Deposit filed by Plaintiffs Janine Paredes and Jacob Alexander Paredes. The petition is related to a settlement between private parties, and Plaintiffs argue that Jacob Paredes has a right to privacy regarding financial information and that sealing the documents is necessary to prevent solicitations from unscrupulous individuals. The Court finds that there exists an overriding interest that overcomes the right of public access to the records and grants the motion to seal.
