And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to quash a notice to appear at trial and demand for production filed by Defendant Murietta Paradise, Inc. The motion was unopposed. The Judge granted the motion because the notice to appear did not specifically identify a witness, as required by law.

The case involves a complaint filed by Plaintiff Steven Varkony against several defendants, including Murietta Paradise, Inc., alleging habitability issues while Varkony was a tenant. The notice to appear was served on December 11, 2023, but did not identify a specific witness.

The Judge relied on California Code of Civil Procedure sections 1987(b) and 1987.1(a) to decide the motion. The Judge held that the notice to appear was insufficient and granted the motion to quash. Defendant Murietta Paradise, Inc. is required to provide notice of the Court's ruling and file proof of service.
