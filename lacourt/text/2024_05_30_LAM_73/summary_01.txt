```

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied the defendant's motion for terminating or evidentiary sanctions against the plaintiff. The defendant had argued that the plaintiff's conduct during his deposition, including his admission that he had been on notice of the claims since 2011 and his lack of capacity to pursue the claims, warranted the sanctions. However, the court found that the defendant had not made any further attempts to depose the plaintiff or seek discovery before filing the motion, and therefore, the plaintiff's conduct did not amount to misuse of the discovery process.
