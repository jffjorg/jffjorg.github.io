JC Form CIV-100 must be used to request court
judgment. On June 27, 2023, Plaintiff submitted her JC Form CIV-100. However, Plaintiff failed to
fill out item number two of the form identifying her damages and the total
amount that Plaintiff is seeking. Plaintiff also failed to fill out item number
seven. Thus, Plaintiff’s request for entry of default judgment form is
incomplete. 
 
On
November 29, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel, Samvel Setyan (“Setyan”), filed a
declaration in support of Plaintiff’s request for default judgment. Setyan states
he spent 8.5 hours on the case and his hourly rate is $550. (Setyan Decl., ¶¶ 6-8.) Thus, multiplying Setyan’s hourly fee and hours he worked on the
case, Plaintiff is seeking $4,675.00 in total for attorney’s fees. (Setyan
Decl., ¶ 8.) He states
Plaintiff is also seeking $641.95 for filing and service costs. (Setyan Decl., ¶ 9.)
 
On
February 6, 2024, Plaintiff filed an Amended Statement of Damages. Plaintiff
states she is seeking judgment “in an amount according to proof but estimated to be no less than
$96,760.00, in a money judgment representing compensatory damages including
lost wages, earnings, commissions, retirement benefits, and other employee
benefits, and all other sums of money, together with interest on these amounts;
for other special damages; and for general damages for mental pain and anguish
and emotional distress and loss of earning capacity. Plaintiff will also seek
attorneys’ fees and costs estimated in the amount of $5,331.00.” (Amended
Statement of Damages, p. 1.) Plaintiff further states she “reserves the right
to seek $1,000,000 in punitive damages when Plaintiff seeks a judgment in the
suit.” (Amended Statement of Damages, p. 1.) The Amended Statement of Damages
does not indicate how Plaintiff calculated $96,760.00 in total amount of
damages. 
 
On April 12,
2024, Plaintiff filed an Amended Declaration in which she states she is seeking
the total amount of $96,760.00 for her emotional distress damages and loss of earnings.
Plaintiff requests emotional distress damages in the amount of $75,000. Plaintiff states
as a result of Defendant’s conduct, she has suffered depression; inability to
sleep; inability to concentrate; and her termination took a toll on her family
and her relationship with her children. (Angle Decl., ¶¶ 9-12.) Plaintiff also seeks $21,760.00
in loss of earnings, calculated based on her weekly pay of $680 for the 32
weeks she was unemployed following her termination. (Angle
Decl., ¶ 16.)
 
Plaintiff’s
Amended Statement of Damages states she “reserves the right to seek” punitive
damages, but her request for $1,000,000 in punitive damages contains no evidentiary support at all. An
award of punitive damages, even on default, must be supported by proof of the
Defendant’s financial condition. (See Soto v. BorgWarner Morse TEC Inc.
(2015) 239 Cal.App.4th 165, 195 (“[e]vidence of a defendant's financial
condition is a legal precondition to the award of punitive damages”).
Ordinarily, financial condition is determined by comparing assets with
liabilities, or income with expenses. (Id. at 194.) Plaintiff has
supplied no such information.
 
Accordingly,
Plaintiff’s request for default judgment is DENIED for failure to complete
CIV-100 and failure to show entitlement to punitive damages. 
 
III. CONCLUSION 
 
Plaintiff’s request for default judgment is DENIED without
prejudice.
