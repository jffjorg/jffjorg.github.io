And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling denies Plaintiff's request for default judgment without prejudice. The Plaintiff, Janet Angle, filed a request for default judgment against SDLA Courier Service, Inc., alleging causes of action including discrimination, retaliation, and wrongful termination. The Plaintiff seeks compensatory and punitive damages, as well as attorneys' fees and costs. The tentative ruling finds that the Plaintiff's request is denied due to the failure to complete the required form (JC Form CIV-100) and the lack of evidence to support the award of punitive damages. The Court notes that an award of punitive damages requires evidence of the Defendant's financial condition, which has not been provided.
