And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling concerns a motion for a determination of good faith settlement filed by defendants Sherman Escrow, et al. with plaintiff Linda Martinez. The motion was initially served by mail on January 19, 2024, which was 16 days and 4 calendar days before the hearing date of February 15, 2024. However, the court ruled that the service was untimely due to a court holiday on February 12, 2024. The court ordered the moving parties to serve a new notice of hearing on all parties and file proof of service within 7 calendar days. Despite this order, no new notice of hearing was filed, and the court assumes the moving parties disregarded the order. As a result, the court takes the motion off-calendar and requires the moving parties to file a new motion on all parties if relief remains sought.
