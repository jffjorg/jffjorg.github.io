And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted defendant Dean Ziroli's petition to compel arbitration of plaintiff Vida Arbab's claims and to stay the action. The judge has also deemed Dean Ziroli's motion to strike portions of Vida Arbab's First Amended Complaint moot.

The judge's ruling is based on the terms of the residential purchase agreement, which includes an arbitration provision. The provision states that any disputes arising out of the agreement or resulting transactions shall be decided by neutral, binding arbitration.

The judge rejected Vida Arbab's arguments that the arbitration provision is unenforceable due to fraud and concealment. The judge found that Vida Arbab failed to provide evidence that the arbitration provision itself was fraudulently induced, and that any allegations of fraud were directed at the underlying contract, not the arbitration provision.

The judge concluded that Dean Ziroli established that Vida Arbab's claims are subject to the arbitration provision, and that Vida Arbab failed to establish any defense to the enforcement of the arbitration provision. Therefore, the judge granted Dean Ziroli's petition to compel arbitration.
