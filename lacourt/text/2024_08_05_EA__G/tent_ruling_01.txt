Trinhnology Enterprise, Corp., Howard Trinh, and Cloud & Sky Enterprises’ Motion to Strike Portions of First Amended
Cross-Complaint is deemed MOOT.
BACKGROUND
This
is an action for breach of contract and fraud. In August 2019, Plaintiff
Trinhnology Enterprise, Corp. (Trinhnology) entered into an alleged oral
agreement with Defendant Philip Chatalos in which Trinhnology agreed to pay a
monthly design fee and sales commissions to Chatalos in exchange for Chatalos’s
sale of Trinhnology’s clothing products. In September 2022, Trinhnology ended
its business relationship with Chatalos. Trinhnology alleges Chatalos breached
their agreement by failing to repay advances on Chatalos’s commission that
Trinhnology had paid. Trinhnology also alleges Chatalos overcharged Trinhnology
for product samples or requested reimbursement for samples that had not been
purchased. Last, Trinhnology alleges Trinhnology alleges Chatalos failed to
follow up with a client to ensure they made payments for previous orders and
reinstated orders that had been cancelled.
On
March 29, 2023, Trinhnology filed a complaint against Chatalos and Does 1-30,
alleging the following causes of action: (1) breach of oral contract, (2)
common counts, (3) breach of oral contract, (4) common counts, (5) fraud, (6)
negligence, (7) common counts, (8) negligence, and (9) negligence.
On
April 21, 2023, Chatalos filed a cross-complaint against Trinhnology, Howard
Quoc Trinh, Cloud & Sky Enterprises (Cloud & Sky), and Does 1-50,
alleging (1) breach of contract and (2) a violation of the California
Independent Wholesale Sales Representative Contractual Relations Act. On July
11, 2023, Chatalos dismissed the cross-complaint without prejudice.
On
November 2, 2023, after obtaining leave from the court, Chatalos filed a
cross-complaint against Trinhnology, Howard Trinh, Cloud & Sky, and Does
1-50, alleging (1) breach of contract and (2) a violation of the California
Independent Wholesale Sales Representative Contractual Relations Act.
On
March 25, 2024, Chatalos filed a First Amended Cross-Complaint (FACC) against
the same cross-defendants alleging the following causes of action: (1) breach
of oral contract, (2) violation of the California Independent Wholesale Sales
Representative Contractual Relations Act, (3) tortious breach of the covenant
of good faith and fair dealing, (4) intentional misrepresentation, (5)
intentional interference with contractual relationship, (6) conspiracy to
engage in intentional interference with contract, and (7) conspiracy to breach
the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.
On
June 12, 2024, Trinhology, Trinh, and Cloud & Sky (collectively, Trinh Defendants)
filed the present demurrer and motion to strike. On July 11, 2024, the Court
continued the hearing on the demurrer and motion to strike in order for parties
to meet and confer. On July 17, 2024, the Trinh Defendants’ counsel met and
conferred telephonically with Chatalos’s counsel and was unable to reach a
resolution. (Strecker Suppl. Decl., ¶ 3.)
A
hearing on the present demurrer and motion to strike is set for July 11, 2024,
with a post-mediation status conference/trial setting conference on October 29,
2024.
REQUEST FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE
The
Trinh Defendants’ request for the Court to take judicial notice of Chatalos’
previous pleadings is GRANTED.
ANALYSIS
The
Trinh Defendants demur to Chatalos’ entire FACC. For the following reasons, the
court SUSTAINS IN PART the Trinh Defendants’ demurrer to Chatalos’ sixth cause of action against
Trinhnology and the seventh cause of action without leave to amend and as to the
first, second, fourth, and fifth causes of action, as well as the sixth cause
of action against Trinh, with leave to amend. Further, the Court OVERRULES IN
PART the
Trinh Defendants’ demurrer to Chatalos’ third cause of action.
Legal Standard
A
party may demur to a complaint on the grounds that it “does not state facts
sufficient to constitute a cause of action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd.
(e).) A demurrer tests whether the complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn
v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747 (Hahn).) When considering
demurrers, courts accept all well pleaded facts as true. (Fox v. JAMDAT
Mobile, Inc. (2010) 185 Cal.App.4th 1068, 1078.) In a demurrer proceeding,
the defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial
notice. (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968,
994.) “A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other
extrinsic matters. Therefore, it lies only where the defects appear on the face
of the pleading or are judicially noticed.” (SKF Farms v. Superior Court
(1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 902, 905.) “The only issue involved in a demurrer hearing
is whether the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous matters,
states a cause of action.” (Hahn, supra, at p. 747.)
Breach of Oral Contract (First Cause of Action)
The
Trinh Defendants argue Chatalos’ first cause of action for breach of oral
contract fails to plead sufficient facts to state a claim. The court agrees.
Legal Standard
To
state a cause of action for breach of contract, a plaintiff must be able to
establish “(1) the existence of the contract, (2) plaintiff’s performance or
excuse for nonperformance, (3) defendant’s breach, and (4) the resulting
damages to the plaintiff.” (Oasis West Realty, LLC v. Goldman (2011) 51
Cal.4th 811, 821.) If a breach of contract claim “is based on alleged breach of
a written contract, the terms must be set out verbatim in the body of the
complaint or a copy of the written agreement must be attached and incorporated
by reference.” (Harris v. Rudin, Richman & Appel (1999) 74
Cal.App.4th 299, 307.) In some circumstances, a plaintiff may also “plead the
legal effect of the contract rather than its precise language.” (Construction
Protective Services, Inc. v. TIG Specialty Ins. Co. (2002) 29 Cal.4th 189,
198-199.) “[T]he vital elements of a cause of action based on contract are
mutual assent (usually accomplished through the medium of an offer and
acceptance) and consideration.” (Division of Labor Law Enforcement v.
Transpacific Transportation Co. (1977) 69 Cal.App.3d 268, 275.)
Discussion
In
this case, the Trinh Defendants argue the FACC is fatally uncertain because it
is unclear which party entered into a contract with Chatalos. (Demurrer, p. 8:9-22.)
They rely on paragraph eleven (11) of the FACC which alleges Chatalos “worked
for Cross-Defendants as a wholesale sales representative to design and sell Cross-Defendants’
products.” (FACC, ¶ 11.) But the first cause of action is only alleged against
Trinhnology. It also alleges the agreements at issue were between Chatalos and
Trinhnology. (FACC, ¶ 392-394.) Because specific allegations control over
general allegations, the court finds any uncertainty is cured by the
allegations in the first cause of action. (Perez v. Golden Empire Transit
Dist. (2012) 209 Cal.App.4th 1228, 1235-1236.)
The
Trinh Defendants also argue this cause of action is defective because it does
not allege the verbatim terms or provide a copy of the initial written
agreement between Trinhnology and Chatalos. (Demurrer, p. 10:9-16.) In
opposition, Chatalos argues this is unnecessary because the FACC alleges a
cause of action for breach of oral contract and Chatalos does not allege a
breach of the initial written agreement. (Opp., p. 4:1-12.) But in considering
the allegations of a complaint, the allegations control over a party’s titles
or labels. (See Estergen v. Sager (1940) 39 Cal.App.2d 401, 404 (Estergen).)
Here,
the FACC alleges Chatalos and Trinhnology entered into a written contract on
July 20, 2020, in which Chatalos agreed to serve as Trinhnology’s wholesale
sales representative. (FACC, ¶ 392.) Two weeks later, the FACC alleges Chatalos
and Trinhnology entered into an oral modification of the contract in which
Trinhnology agreed to increase Chatalos’ commission in exchange for a reduction
in the flat monthly rate owed to Chatalos and to make payment upon receiving
payments from customers. (FACC, ¶ 394.)
Subsequently,
the FACC alleges Trinhnology failed to pay commissions owed pursuant to their
oral agreement and failed to reimburse Chatalos’ expenses. (FACC, ¶ 397.) But
while the alleged oral modification does not address reimbursement of expenses,
the initial written contract included a provision that guaranteed Trinhnology’s
monthly reimbursement of Chatalos’ expenses. (FACC, ¶ 12.) Based on these
allegations, Chatalos’ first cause of action is not limited to breach of the
alleged oral agreement since it also alleges breach of the initial written
agreement’s reimbursement provision. Thus, Chatalos must provide either the
verbatim terms or a copy of the initial written agreement.
Accordingly,
the Trinh Defendants’ demurrer to this cause of action is SUSTAINED with leave to amend.
Violation of the California Independent Wholesale
Sales Representative Contractual Relations Act (Second Cause of Action)
The
Trinh Defendants contend Chatalos’ second cause of action for violation of the California
Independent Wholesale Sales Representative Contractual Relations Act (IWSRCRA)
fails to plead sufficient facts to state a claim. The court agrees.
In
this case, the Trinh Defendants first contend the allegations of the FACC are
contradictory as to whether there was a written contract since this cause of
action alleges Cross-Defendants violated Civil Code section 1738.13 by hiring
Chatalos as a sales representative without entering into a written contract. (Demurrer,
p. 11:2-12, citing FACC, ¶ 406.) But while the FACC has alleged the existence
of an initial written contract, the FACC also alleges the parties subsequently
made an oral modification to the contract. (FACC, ¶ 392, 394.) IWSRCRA requires
contracts to be in writing and one of the required terms is “the rate and
method by which the commission is computed” and “the time when commissions will
be paid.” (Civ. Code, § 1738.13, subd. (b)(1)-(2).) By alleging the rate of
commission and time of payment were subsequently modified by an oral agreement,
the FACC adequately establishes a violation of IWSRCRA’s written contract
requirement. (FACC, ¶ 394) Furthermore, the Trinh Defendants do not point to
any authority that holds oral modifications of these required terms complies
with IWSRCRA.
Next,
the Trinh Defendants contend there are no allegations to establish how Trinh
and Cloud & Sky entered into a contract to hire Chatalos as a sales
representative. (Demurrer, p. 11:12-25.) In opposition, Chatalos contends the
second cause of action is not alleged against Trinh and Cloud & Sky. (Opp.,
p. 5:15-23.) But while the title of this cause of action states it is against
Trinhnology, the supporting allegations collectively reference the Trinh
Defendants. (FACC, ¶ 402-403, 406-409.) Thus, the court agrees this cause of
action is contradictory, unclear, ambiguous as alleged.
Accordingly,
the Trinh Defendants’ demurrer to this cause of action is SUSTAINED with leave to amend.
Tortious Breach of the Covenant of Good Faith and Fair
Dealing (Third Cause of Action)
The
Trinh Defendants maintain Chatalos’ third cause of action for tortious breach
of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing fails to plead sufficient facts
to state a claim. The court disagrees.
Legal Standard
“[T]he
factual elements necessary to establish a breach of the covenant of good faith
and fair dealing are: (1) the parties entered into a contract; (2) the
plaintiff fulfilled his obligations under the contract; (3) any conditions
precedent to the defendant's performance occurred; (4) the defendant unfairly
interfered with the plaintiff's rights to receive the benefits of the contract;
and (5) the plaintiff was harmed by the defendant's conduct.” (Rosenfeld v.
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (N.D. Cal. 2010) 732 F.Supp.2d 952, 968, citing
BAJI No. 325.) A breach becomes tortious if an independent tort is
involved. (Innovative Business Partnerships, Inc. v. Inland Counties
Regional Center, Inc. (2011) 194 Cal.App.4th 623, 631-632.)
Discussion
In
this case, the Trinh Defendants maintain this cause of action fails because Chatalos’
remedy lies in contract and not tort. (Demurrer, p. 5:23-6:14.) But the FACC
fails to allege how Trinhnology committed an independent tort and instead suggests
the alleged breach is contractual. (FACC, ¶ 414-415.) Because the specific
allegations control over a party’s labeling or mislabeling of causes of action,
the court finds this cause of action adequately states a cause of action for
contractual breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing. (Estergen,
supra, 39 Cal.App.2d at p. 404.)
The
Trinh Defendants also maintain this cause of action is duplicative of the first
cause of action. (Demurrer, p. 13:9-20.) The court acknowledges there is a
split of authority on whether a demurrer can be sustained on grounds that a
cause of action is duplicitous. In Blickman Turkus, LP v. MF Downtown
Sunnyvale, LLC (2008) 162 Cal.App.4th 858 (Blickman Turkus), the
Sixth District Court of Appeal held a demurrer could not be sustained on
grounds that it is duplicative pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section
430.10. (Id., at p. 890.) In Palm Springs Villas II Homeowners Assn.,
Inc. v. Parth (2016) 248 Cal.App.4th 268 (Palm Springs Villas), the
Fourth District Court of Appeal held the opposite, noting a duplicative cause
of action is grounds upon which a demurrer may be sustained according to Rodrigues
v. Campbell Industries (1978) 87 Cal.App.3d 494, 501 (Rodrigues). (Palm
Springs Villas, supra, 248 Cal.App.4th at p. 290.)
Code
of Civil Procedure section 430.10 authorizes a party to bring a demurrer on
eight different grounds, none of which explicitly include grounds that a cause
of action is duplicative or superfluous. In Rodrigues, the Fourth
District Court of Appeal noted the cause of action at issue merely combined all
the previous causes of action and did not add anything to the complaint by way
or fact or theory of recovery. (Rodrigues, supra, 87 Cal.App.3d
at p. 498, 501.) However, the court finds the reasoning in Blickman Turkus more
persuasive. Noting the jurisprudential maxim that “superfluity does not
vitiate” (Civ. Code, § 3537), the court held “[t]his is the sort of defect
that, if it justifies any judicial intervention at all, is ordinarily dealt
with most economically at trial, or on a dispositive motion such as summary
judgment.” (Blickman Turkus, supra, 162 Cal.App.4th at p.
890.) Thus, the court declines to consider whether this cause of action is
duplicative or superfluous.
Accordingly,
the Trinh Defendants’ demurrer to this cause of action is OVERRULED.
Intentional Misrepresentation (Fourth Cause of Action)
The
Trinh Defendants argue Chatalos’ fourth cause of action for intentional
misrepresentation fails to plead sufficient facts to state a claim. The court
agrees.
Legal Standard
“To
establish a claim for deceit based on intentional misrepresentation, the
plaintiff must prove seven essential elements: (1) the defendant represented to
the plaintiff that an important fact was true; (2) that representation was
false; (3) the defendant knew that the representation was false when the
defendant made it, or the defendant made the representation recklessly and
without regard for its truth; (4) the defendant intended that the plaintiff
rely on the representation; (5) the plaintiff reasonably relied on the
representation; (6) the plaintiff was harmed; and (7) the plaintiff's reliance
on the defendant's representation was a substantial factor in causing that harm
to the plaintiff.” (Manderville v. PCG&S Group, Inc. (2007) 146
Cal.App.4th 1486, 1498.)
The
facts constituting the alleged fraud must be alleged factually and specifically
as to every element of fraud, as the policy of “liberal construction” of the
pleadings will not ordinarily be invoked. (Lazar v. Superior Court (1996)
12 Cal.4th 631, 645.) In alleging a cause of action for fraud, “[t]he
specificity requirement means a plaintiff must allege facts showing how, when,
where, to whom, and by what means the representations were made, and, in the
case of a corporate defendant, the plaintiff must allege the names of the
persons who made the representations, their authority to speak on behalf of the
corporation, to whom they spoke, what they said or wrote, and when the
representation was made.” (West v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (2013) 214
Cal.App.4th 780, 793.)
Discussion
In
this case, the Trinh Defendants argue the FACC fails to allege fraud with specificity
including when the representations were made, where the representations were
made, and what was specifically said. (Demurrer, p. 14:24-15:2.) The court
notes, however, there are no actionable representations alleged in the first
place. “It is hornbook law that an actionable misrepresentation must be made
about past or existing facts; statements regarding future events are merely
deemed opinions.” (San Francisco Design Center Associates v. Portman
Companies (1995) 41 Cal.App.4th 29, 44.) Here, the FACC alleges Trinh and
Trinhnology represented they would pay a six percent commission to Chatalos for
all sales made to Forever 21. (FACC, ¶ 419.) Because this representation
involves a promise of future conduct rather than a statement of existing fact,
it does not qualify as an actionable representation.
Accordingly,
the Trinh Defendants’ demurrer to this cause of action is SUSTAINED with leave to amend.
Intentional Interference with Contractual Relationship
(Fifth Cause of Action)
The
Trinh Defendants contends Chatalos’ fifth cause of action for intentional
interference with contractual relationship fails to plead sufficient facts to
state a claim. The court agrees.
Legal Standard
The
elements of a cause of action for intentional interference with contractual
relations are “(1) a valid contract between plaintiff and a third party; (2)
defendant’s knowledge of this contract; (3) defendant's intentional acts
designed to induce a breach or disruption of the contractual relationship; (4)
actual breach or disruption of the contractual relationship; and (5) resulting
damage.” (I-CA Enterprises, Inc. v. Palram Americas, Inc. (2015) 235
Cal.App.4th 257, 289.)
Discussion
In
this case, the Trinh Defendants contend the FACC fails to allege how Cloud
& Sky took any action to prevent performance of an alleged contract between
Trinhnology and Chatalos. (Demurrer, p. 15:4-16.) The FACC alleges Trinhnology’s
employees instructed Forever 21 to send its purchase documents and payments to
Cloud & Sky for Chatalos’ sales so that Trinhnology would not be credited
with them. (FACC, ¶ 432.) But the FACC fails to coherently explain how Cloud
& Sky acted to interfere beyond passively receiving documents and payments
from Forever 21. (FACC, ¶ 432.) Instead, the FACC’s allegations suggest Trinh
and Trinhnology were the ones who were responsible for directing sales to Cloud
& Sky. (FACC, ¶ 421.) The FACC also fails to allege how Cloud & Sky
acted with the intent to disrupt or breach Chatalos’ agreement with Trinhnology
and instead appears to attribute that intent to Trinh and Trinhnology. (FACC, ¶
421.)
Accordingly,
the Trinh Defendants’ demurrer to this cause of action is SUSTAINED with leave to amend.
Conspiracy Claims (Sixth and Seventh Causes of Action)
The
Trinh Defendants maintain Chatalos’ sixth cause of action for conspiracy to
engage in intentional interference with contract and seventh cause of action
for conspiracy to breach the covenant of good faith and fair dealing fail to
plead sufficient facts to state a claim. The court agrees.
Legal Standard
“Conspiracy
is not a cause of action, but a legal doctrine that imposes liability on
persons who, although not actually committing a tort themselves, share with the
immediate tortfeasors a common plan or design in its perpetration.” (Applied
Equipment Corp. v. Litton Saudi Arabia Ltd. (1994) 7 Cal.4th 503, 510-511.)
“The elements of a civil conspiracy are (1) the formation of a group of two or
more persons who agreed to a common plan or design to commit a tortious act;
(2) a wrongful act committed pursuant to the agreement; and (3) resulting
damages.” (City of Industry v. City of Fillmore (2011) 198 Cal.App.4th
191, 212 (City of Industry).)
Discussion
In
this case, the Trinh Defendants maintain these causes of action do not state a
claim because conspiracy is not a cause of action. (Demurrer, p. 15:19-16:7.) In
opposition, while Chatalos concedes conspiracy is not a standalone cause of
action, Chatalos maintains the mere fact that Chatalos separately alleged this
theory of liability does not subject it to demurrer. (Opp., p. 13:7-21.) The court
agrees as courts have long departed from considering a pleading’s form over its
substance. (Barquis v. Merchants Collection Assn. (1972) 7 Cal.3d 94,
103.)
Next,
the Trinh Defendants maintain Chatalos cannot state a cause of action for
conspiracy to engage in intentional interference with contract against
Trinhnology because Trinhnology was a party to that contract. (Demurrer, p. 16:7-18.)
In support of this argument, the Trinh Defendants cite Applied Equipment
Corp. v. Litton Saudi Arabia Ltd. (1994) 7 Cal.4th 503 (Applied
Equipment), where our supreme court held “the tort cause of action for
interference with a contract does not lie against a party to the contract.” (Id.,
at p. 514.) In that case, our supreme court rejected the claim that a
contracting party can be held liable in tort for conspiracy to interfere with
its own contract. (Id., at p. 507-508.) In opposition, Chatalos
acknowledges Applied Equipment’s applicability and fails to distinguish
it or point to any contrary legal authority. (Opp., p. 14:22-25.) Thus, as a
matter of law, Chatalos cannot allege Trinhnology was a conspirator to Cloud
& Sky’s alleged interference with the contract between Chatalos and
Trinhnology.
Turning
to the FACC’s allegation that Trinh was also a conspirator to Cloud & Sky’s
alleged intentional interference with contract, the Trinh Defendants maintain
there are no facts establishing Trinh was personally bound by the duty to
perform the alleged contract. (Demurrer, p. 16:19-25.) Civil conspiracy cannot
be established “if the alleged conspirator, though a participant in the
agreement underlying the injury, was not personally bound by the duty violated
by the wrongdoing and was acting only as the agent or employee of the party who
did have that duty.” (Doctors’ Co. v. Superior Court (1989) 49 Cal.3d
39, 44 (Doctors’ Co.).) Here, the FACC alleges Trinh was Trinhnology’s
owner and agent. (FACC, ¶ 5, 10.) In opposition, Chatalos maintains the FACC
alleges Trinh acted in an individual capacity to interfere with the contract at
issue. (Opp., 15:2-5.) But the paragraphs cited do not include this purported
language. (FACC, ¶ 439, 440.) Instead, by alleging Trinh and Trinhnology acted
together and referencing the communications of Trinhnology’s employees, it
appears Trinh was acting as Trinhnology’s agent when Trinh allegedly
interfered. Because there are no allegations to establish Trinh was acting in
an individual capacity, this cause of action is insufficiently pled as to
Trinh.
Last,
the Trinh Defendants maintain the seventh cause of action for conspiracy to
breach the covenant of good faith and fair dealing fails for the same reasons
the underlying claim fails and because conspiracy is not a separate cause of
action. (Demurrer, p. 16:28-17:8.) But while these arguments fail for the
reasons noted above, the court notes conspiracy requires the commission of a
tort. (See City of Industry, supra, 198 Cal.App.4th at p. 211-212.)
As noted above in the section discussing Chatalos’ third cause of action for
breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, this breach is
contractual and not tortious. Because the underlying breach was not tortious, the
court finds there is no underlying tort to support a conspiracy theory of
liability against Cloud & Sky and Trinh.
Accordingly,
the Trinh Defendants’ demurrer to these causes of action is SUSTAINED with leave to amend as to
the sixth cause of action against Trinh and without leave to amend as to sixth
cause of action against Trinhnology and as to the seventh cause of action.
CONCLUSIONBased on the foregoing, the Trinh Defendants’ demurrer to
Chatalos’ FACC is SUSTAINED IN PART without leave to amend as to the
sixth cause of action against Trinhnology and the seventh cause of action and
with twenty (20) days leave to amend as to the first, second, fourth, and
fifth causes of action, as well as the sixth cause of action against Trinh.
The demurrer is OVERRULED
IN PART as to the third cause of action.
Based on the analysis above, the Trinh Defendants’ motion
to strike portions of Chatalos’ FACC is deemed MOOT.
