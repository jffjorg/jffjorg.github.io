Elysienne, LLC v.

Hearing Date: May

Cross-Defendant
Elysienne, LLC’s Motion for Issue and/or Evidence Sanctions against Cross-Complainant
Zadeh & Pineapple Ventures for Failure to Comply with Discovery Orders and
Request for Monetary Sanctions – UNOPPOSED
 
Vincent Zadeh and
Pineapple Ventures cross complained for breach of an interior design service
agreement for the design of an office space and retail store. Elysienne brings
this motion for issue, evidentiary, and monetary sanctions for Zadeh and
Pineapple Ventures’ failure to comply with the court’s December 19, 2023 minute
order regarding discovery. The motion is unopposed. 
 
Where a party
willfully disobeys a discovery order, courts have discretion to impose
terminating, issue, evidence or monetary sanctions. Code Civ. Proc., §§
2023.010(g), 2030.290(c); R.S. Creative, Inc. v. Creative Cotton, Ltd.
(1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 486, 495. 
“Discovery sanctions must be tailored in order to remedy the offending
party's discovery abuse, should not give the aggrieved party more than what it
is entitled to, and should not be used to punish the offending party.” Karlsson
v. Ford Motor Co. (2006) 140 Cal.App.4th 1202, 1217.  Discovery sanctions “should be appropriate to
the dereliction and should not exceed that which is required to protect the
interests of the party entitled to but denied discovery.” Deyo v. Kilbourne
(1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 771, 793.
 
Code of Civil
Procedure §2030.040 requires “[a] request for a sanction shall, in the notice
of motion, identify every person, party, and attorney against whom the sanction
is sought, and specify the type of sanction sought.”  Furthermore, the notice of motion shall be
supported by a memorandum of points and authorities and accompanied by a
declaration setting forth facts supporting the amount of any monetary sanction
sought. Monetary sanctions may be imposed. Code of Civ. Proc. §2030.030(a).
 
Issue sanctions
may be imposed “ordering that designated facts shall be taken as established in
the action in accordance with the claim of the party adversely affected by the
misuse of the discovery process. The court may also impose an issue sanction by
an order prohibiting any party engaging in the misuse of the discovery process
from supporting or opposing designated claims or defenses.” Code of Civ. Proc.
§2030.030(b).
 
Evidence sanctions
may be imposed “by an order prohibiting any party engaging in the misuse of the
discovery process from introducing designated matters in evidence.” Code of
Civ. Proc. §2030.030(c).
 
Elysienne argues
Zadeh and Pineapple Ventures should be precluded from introducing evidence of
any claims that are the subject of its interrogatories and requests for
production due to the failure to comply with the court’s order compelling
responses to the discovery requests. The court ordered Zadeh and Pineapple
Ventures to provide verified, objection-free responses within 20 days. 12/19/23
Minute Order. Elysienne’s counsel states on March 1, 2024, he sent
correspondence to Zadeh and Pineapple Ventures’ counsel requesting responses.
Morrow Decl. ¶ 9; Exh. L. They have not done so. Id. ¶ 11.
 
There is no opposition.
Vincent and Pineapple Ventures failed to comply with the court order. The court
finds no basis for the failure to comply with the court’s order, which is a
misuse of the discovery process. GRANTED.
 
Elysienne seeks $5,510.00
in monetary sanctions for 19 hours of attorney time spent preparing the motion,
subsequent reply (which was not needed, as no opposition was filed) and
attending the hearing at the rate of $290.00/hr. Id. ¶ 12. Given the
motion's simplicity and lack of opposition or reply, the amount requested is unreasonable.
Sanctions are GRANTED for 8 hours for preparation and appearing at the hearing
at $290/hour. Zadeh and Pineapple Ventures are order to pay sanctions to
Elysienne’s counsel within 30 days.
