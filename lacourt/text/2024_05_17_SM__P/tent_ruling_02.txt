Sheldon v. Kohn,
et al. Case No. 24SMCV00825 
Hearing Date: May 17,
2024
Defendants Kohns’ Demurrer
to Plaintiff’s Complaint
 
Plaintiff Sheldon filed
this unlawful detainer action against defendants Matt and Sharon Kohn for
failure to pay rent. Defendants demurrer for failure to state a claim. 
 
“The basic
elements of unlawful detainer for nonpayment of rent ... are (1) the tenant is
in possession of the premises; (2) that possession is without permission; (3)
the tenant is in default for nonpayment of rent; (4) the tenant has been
properly served with a written three-day notice; and (5) the default continues
after the three-day notice period has elapsed.” KB Salt Lake III, LLC v.
Fitness Intern., LLC (2023) 95 Cal.App.5th 1032, 1045. 
 
The complaint is completed
on a UD-100 form and alleges the parties entered a written 1-year lease, later
a month-to-month lease, for $3,300.00 per month. Compl. p. 2 ¶ 6. The rent
later increased to $3,835.00 per month. Id. The tenancy was terminated
due to the Kohns’ failure to pay rent, and plaintiff alleges past due rent of
$31,340.00. Id. ¶¶ 8, 12. The Kohns were served with a 3-day notice to
pay rent or quit the premises by posting, by giving a copy to a person found
residing at the premises, and by US mail. Id. ¶¶ 9(a). As of February 14,
2023, the Kohns failed to comply with the requirements of the 3-day notice. Id.
¶ 9(b). 
 
On demurrer, all
factual allegations must be treated as true. Plaintiff uses the form complaint
and alleges all elements of the claim for unlawful detainer. OVERRULED. Defendants
must answer within 5 court days.
