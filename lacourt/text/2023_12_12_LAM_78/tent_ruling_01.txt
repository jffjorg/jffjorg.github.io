Plaintiff alleges that she is a former employee of Defendant and worked as a secretary for outpatient surgery and then as a secretary/monitor technician for the orthopedics department. In June 2020, Plaintiff complained to her manager that her workload was increased and that she was working well-past her scheduled hours because the hospital was short-staffed. Plaintiff also complained that she was experiencing workplace bullying. In August 2020, Plaintiff was transferred to a different department where she began being verbally harassed by her new manager who accused her of not helping out with patient care despite the fact that she was not a nurse. Plaintiff’s work environment became unbearably hostile, and her manager would not relieve her for lunch or breaks. When Plaintiff complained, the manager yelled and berated Plaintiff in front of other employees. In September 2020, Plaintiff complained to human resources about her department’s lack of personal protective equipment. Plaintiff’s manager began making threatening gestures to her which she believed was retaliatory. In November 2020, Plaintiff became unwell at work and was tested for COVID-19. After she returned to work after receiving her test results, she was subjected to burdensome work conditions. In early December, 2020, Plaintiff fell ill and took medical leave in January 2021. When Plaintiff returned, she was terminated for taking medical leave. PROCEDURAL HISTORYOn December 21, 2021, Plaintiff Annette Brewer filed her Complaint against Defendant Methodist Hospital of Southern California.On March 18, 2022, Defendant answered.On August 18, 2023, the parties participated in IDC.On September 15, 2023, Plaintiff filed this motion to compel Defendant’s further responses to Requests for Production.DISCUSSION Plaintiff moves to compel Defendant’s further responses to Requests for Production (“RPDs”).I. Legal StandardUnder Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.310, the Court may order a responding party to serve a further response to a request for production when the Court finds that any of the following apply: 1. A statement of compliance with the demand is incomplete; 2. A representation of inability to comply is inadequate, incomplete, or evasive; or3. An objection in the response is without merit or too general. To prevail, the party moving for the order must first offer specific facts demonstrating “good cause justifying the discovery sought by the demand.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (b)(1).) This burden “is met simply by a fact-specific showing of relevance.” (TBG Ins. Servs. Corp. v. Superior Court (2002) 96 Cal.App.4th 443, 448.) If “good cause” is shown by the moving party, the burden shifts to the responding party to justify any objections made to document disclosure. (Kirkland v. Superior Court (2002) 95 Cal.App.4th 92, 98.) Code Civ. Proc., section 2031.310, subdivision (h) authorizes a mandatory issuance of sanctions against “any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a further response to interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc., section 2031.310, subd. (h).) Sanctions may be imposed for misuse of discovery process. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (a). ) Failing to respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery constitutes a misuse of the discovery process. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (d).)II. DiscussionPlaintiff’s counsel testifies that she originally propounded RPDs on Defendant on October 26, 2022. (Banker Decl., ¶1.) On January 3, 2023, Defendant served its responses to the RPDs. (Id., ¶2.) On February 3, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel sent a meet and confer letter to Defendant’s counsel regarding deficiencies in its responses. (Id., ¶3.) On March 7, 2023, Defendant’s counsel agreed to produce further documents at the end of March and agreed to extend the deadline to file a motion to compel further responses to 10 days after Defendant produced additional documents. (Id., ¶4.) On April 3, 2023, Defendant represented it would produce documents by April 10, 2023. (Id., ¶5.) Plaintiff inquired after the missing responses again on April 18, 2023, May 11, 2023, and June 28, 2023. (Id., ¶¶6-7.) At an IDC in August 2023, Defendant’s counsel stated he would be producing documents shortly. (Id., ¶9.) As of the date of the filing of this motion, Defendant had not produced any documents. (Id., ¶10.) Defendant’s counsel represents that he served supplemental responses on November 27, 2023. (Garcia Decl., ¶¶3-4.) The responses are verified. (Opp., Exh. B.)Plaintiff argues that the responses are still incomplete because Defendant failed to produce documents responsive to RPD 13. RPD 13 requests any and all documents referring to any insurance policies that may provide coverage for Defendant for the claims asserted by Plaintiff in this case. Because Defendant failed to respond completely to this request, Defendant must produce the declaration to its insurance policy. Plaintiff also argues that Defendant failed to produce records of communications between Plaintiff, her supervisor and Human Resources. Plaintiff refers to RPD numbers 26 and 28 which request documents referring to communications between Plaintiff and Kelly Rivers and Plaintiff and Anahid, respectively. Defendant’s further verified responses are confusing to the Court. Defendant must clearly state that no responsive documents exist, if that is the case. If any communications do exist, they must be produced. To the extent that the requested documents call for privileged information, a privilege log must be produced.Plaintiff argues that the responses are not bates stamped and Defendant does not identify the specific request number to which the produced documents respond in violation of Code Civ. Proc., section 2031.280(a). Defendant must reproduce bates stamped responsive documents and indicate which request numbers the documents respond to.With respect to sanctions, Defendant did not serve supplemental responses until November 2023, three months after Defendant agreed to produce supplemental responses. Additionally, Defendant provides no basis for failing to respond to RPD numbers 13, 26, and 28, and failing to serve bates stamped documents identified by request. The Court finds that Defendant’s conduct amounts to misuse of the discovery process. Plaintiff’s request for $1,350 in sanctions for three hours of attorney time at a rate of $450 per hour is granted.DATED:  December 12, 2023______________________Hon.
