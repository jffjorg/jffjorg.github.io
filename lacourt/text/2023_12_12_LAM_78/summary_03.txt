The court's tentative ruling addresses the plaintiff's motion for attorney's fees. The defendants propose to deduct 186.3 hours from the plaintiff's counsel's proposed billing, but the court finds that the defendants have not provided sufficient information to support their claims. The court requires the defendants to provide a detailed chart of each billing entry they challenge, including the date, description, name of the attorney, number of hours billed, and reasons why the time is unreasonable. The parties are ordered to appear remotely or in person to set a further briefing schedule.
