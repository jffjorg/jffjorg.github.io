## English Text Summary

The judge's tentative ruling denies the petitioner's request. The reason for the denial is that the petitioner failed to provide identification with a fingerprint, which is required for a criminal history assessment by Probation. 

The court had previously continued the petition on August 14, 2023, specifically addressing this issue and instructing the petitioner on how to provide the necessary identification. However, the petitioner did not comply with the court's order. 

The denial is "without prejudice," meaning the petitioner can submit a new petition once they have provided the required identification.
