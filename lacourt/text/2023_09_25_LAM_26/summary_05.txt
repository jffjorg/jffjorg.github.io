And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the matter of Petitioner's petition for name change. Due to the Probation Office's criminal history assessment, it has been revealed that Petitioner has an active outstanding warrant. The Probation Officer has noted that the warrant is for case #W052681429 and was issued on July 10, 2023. As a result, the Court will not rule on the petition for name change until the outstanding warrant is cleared. Petitioner must file evidence of the cleared warrant by November 20, 2023, at the latest. If this is not done, the OSC and hearing on the petition will be taken off calendar. The Probation Office will run a new criminal history assessment prior to the continued OSC to verify that the bench warrant has been cleared. The Court Clerk will provide notice to all parties.
