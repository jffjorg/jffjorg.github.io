The judge has temporarily ruled that a hearing on a name change petition will be continued until November 20, 2023. This is because the petitioner has an outstanding bench warrant in Kansas. The judge will only consider the name change petition once the petitioner provides proof that this warrant has been cleared.  The petitioner must submit this proof at least two weeks before the continued hearing. If the warrant is not cleared, the hearing will be removed from the court's schedule.
