 Case Number:  23STCP01957    Hearing Date:   September 25, 2023    Dept:  26 Petitioner has failed to provide any
form of identification tied to a fingerprint on file, which is necessary for
Probation to run a criminal history assessment. 
On August 14, 2023, the Court continued the petition explicitly noting
this issue and ordered Petitioner to provide Probation with some form of
identification verified by a fingerprint to enable Probation to run a criminal
history assessment and identified how this may be done.  However, Petitioner failed to do so.  Accordingly, the instant petition is DENIED
WITHOUT PREJUDICE. Petitioner may submit a new petition addressing the lack of
identification tied to a fingerprint for Probation to run a criminal history
assessment.
Court Clerk to give notice.
