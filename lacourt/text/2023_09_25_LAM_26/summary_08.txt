## English Summary

The Judge issued a tentative ruling in a case where the Petitioner is seeking a name change. The ruling states that the Judge will not rule on the petition until the Petitioner clears all outstanding bench warrants in Virginia, Ohio, and California.

The Probation Office discovered these warrants through a criminal history assessment. The warrants involve charges ranging from assault and larceny to flight and escape. 

The hearing on the name change petition has been continued to November 20, 2023. The Petitioner must provide written proof that all warrants have been resolved by two weeks before the continued hearing. Failure to do so will result in the case being dismissed without prejudice, meaning it can be refiled once the warrants are cleared.  The Probation Office will run a new criminal history assessment before the continued hearing to verify that the warrants have been cleared.
