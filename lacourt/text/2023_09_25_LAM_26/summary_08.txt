And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Petitioner's petition for a name change. The Judge has found that the Probation Office's criminal history assessment reveals that Petitioner has active outstanding warrants in Virginia, Ohio, and California. The warrants include charges such as assault, failure to appear, and petit larceny. The Judge has ordered Petitioner to clear all of the outstanding bench warrants and file evidence of such before the Court will rule on the petition. The OSC and hearing on the petition for name change have been continued to November 20, 2023 at 9:00 am. Petitioner must file written proof that the outstanding bench warrants have all been fully addressed and resolved no later than two weeks before the continued OSC and hearing. Failure to do so will result in the OSC and hearing being taken off calendar without prejudice to be placed back on calendar upon filing of proof that all outstanding warrants have been cleared.
