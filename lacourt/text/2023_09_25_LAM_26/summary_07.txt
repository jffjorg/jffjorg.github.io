And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a preliminary decision about a petition for a name change. The petition is pending because the petitioner has an active outstanding warrant for their arrest. The warrant was issued in another case and has a bail amount of $5,000. The petitioner must clear this warrant before the court will rule on their petition. The petitioner must also file written proof that the warrant has been fully addressed and resolved at least two weeks before the next hearing. If this proof is not filed, the hearing will be taken off the calendar without prejudice, meaning the petitioner can still file the proof and have the hearing reinstated. Additionally, the petitioner must file proof of publication of their name change notice at least one week before the next hearing. If this proof is not filed, the petition will be denied and dismissed without prejudice.
