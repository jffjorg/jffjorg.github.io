And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is issuing a tentative ruling in a case where a petitioner is seeking to change their name. However, the Probation Office has revealed that the petitioner has an active outstanding warrant with a bail of $5,000 issued in a different case. The judge is requiring the petitioner to clear this outstanding warrant and file evidence of such before they will rule on the petition for name change. The petitioner must also file written proof that the warrant has been fully addressed and resolved two weeks before the continued hearing date. Failure to do so will result in the hearing being taken off calendar. Additionally, the petitioner must file proof of publication one week before the continued hearing date, or the petition will be denied and dismissed without prejudice. The court clerk is to give notice to all parties.
