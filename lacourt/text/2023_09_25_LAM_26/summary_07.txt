And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a preliminary decision about a petition for a name change. The petition is pending because the petitioner has an active outstanding warrant for their arrest. The warrant was issued in another case and has a bail amount of $5,000. The petitioner must clear this warrant before the court will rule on their petition. The petitioner must also file written proof that the warrant has been fully addressed and resolved at least two weeks before the next hearing. If this proof is not filed, the hearing will be taken off the calendar without prejudice, meaning the petitioner can still file the proof and have the hearing reinstated. Additionally, the petitioner must file proof of publication of their name change notice at least one week before the next hearing. If this proof is not filed, the petition will be denied and dismissed without prejudice.

## English Summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in this name change case.  The ruling states that the petitioner must first clear an outstanding bench warrant with a $5,000 bail in a separate case (LAM9MP01857-01).  The petitioner must provide proof to the court that the warrant has been resolved before the court will consider the name change petition.

The court has continued the hearing to November 20, 2023. The petitioner must also file proof of publication (likely required for name change proceedings) one week before the hearing. Failure to comply with either requirement will result in the case being dismissed without prejudice, meaning it can be refiled later.
