And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling denies the petition filed by the Petitioner without prejudice, meaning the Petitioner may re-file the petition once the identification issue is resolved. The Petitioner failed to provide identification tied to a fingerprint, which is necessary for Probation to run a criminal history assessment. The Court had previously continued the petition and ordered the Petitioner to provide identification, but the Petitioner did not comply. The Petitioner will need to address this issue and provide the required identification in order to proceed with the petition.
