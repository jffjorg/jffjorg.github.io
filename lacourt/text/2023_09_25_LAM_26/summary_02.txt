However, the petitioner failed to provide identification with a fingerprint,  which is necessary for Probation to complete the assessment.  The court had previously continued the petition on August 14th and specifically ordered the petitioner to provide this identification.  Because the petitioner did not comply, the petition is denied without prejudice, meaning the petitioner can refile with the required documentation.
