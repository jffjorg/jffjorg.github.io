## English Text Summary

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the Petitioner's petition. The reason for the denial is that the Petitioner failed to provide evidence showing that an outstanding warrant against them had been cleared, as ordered by the Court.  The Petitioner had an active warrant stemming from a 2019 criminal case.  The Court gave the Petitioner two weeks before the continued hearing to clear the warrant and provide evidence. The Petitioner did not do so, leading to the denial of the petition. Importantly, this denial is *without prejudice*, meaning the Petitioner can refile their petition once they have cleared the outstanding warrant and provided the necessary evidence to the court.
