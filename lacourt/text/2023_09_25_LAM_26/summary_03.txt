And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the petition filed by Petitioner is denied without prejudice because Petitioner failed to provide evidence that the outstanding warrant has been cleared. The warrant, which is for $30,000, was issued on June 12, 2019, and Petitioner was ordered to provide evidence to clear it two weeks before the continued hearing date. Since Petitioner failed to do so, the petition is denied. However, Petitioner may re-file the petition with evidence showing that the warrant has been cleared.
